  "body_text": "Election Day is here. Voters are gearing up to head to the polls to cast their ballots for either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris in one of the nation’s most historic presidential races. They’ll also be determining which party will control the House and Senate.\nHere’s the latest:\nIn Ohio, Moreno pledges to win over those who didn’t vote for him\nIncumbent U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown said his loss to Republican Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno in Ohio “is a disappointment, but it is not a failure.”\nThe three-term Democrat gave his concession speech in Columbus.\n“It will never be wrong to fight for organized labor, it will never be wrong to fight for the freedom of women to make their healthcare decisions, it surely will never be wrong to fight for civil rights and human rights,” he said.\nIn Cleveland, Moreno praised former President Donald Trump and pledged to help advance his agenda in Washington. He said he would work to win over those who didn’t vote for him.\n“We talked about wanting a red wave. I think what we have tonight is a red, white and blue wave,” he said.\nTrump campaign comments on Harris’ watch party mood\nA Trump campaign spokesperson is weighing in as the mood has shifted over at Harris’ watch party.\n“Sounds like the joy has left the building,” posted Karoline Leavitt, a campaign spokeswoman on X.\nThe Harris campaign turned off its projected CNN broadcasts at its election night watch party at Howard University as midnight approached. And some Harris supporters began leaving the event.\nTrump is en route to his watch party from Mar-a-Lago\nHe’s expected to speak tonight to his gathered supporters.\nHarris isn’t planning to speak tonight\nVice President Kamala Harris is not planning to address the public during the night, according to a person familiar with the White House spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter.\nDemocrats gain redistricted seat in Alabama\nDemocrats have picked up a seat in Alabama that was redistricted to ensure fair representation for Black voters. It’s the second flipped seat for Democrats tonight.\nDemocrats Shomari Figures in Alabama prevailed over Republican Caroleene Dobson to give Democrats an important pickup in the race for House control.\nRepublicans have also benefited from redistricting, especially in North Carolina where they picked up three House seats redrawn by the state’s GOP-controlled General Assembly to favor Republican candidates.\nNancy Pelosi headed back to House\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, the first woman to serve as House speaker, has been reelected to a 20th term serving a San Francisco-based congressional district.\nPelosi has had two stints as House speaker, both lasting four years. In the second stint, she agreed to limit herself to two terms as the lead House Democrat as part of a compromise to secure the votes needed for her to gain the gavel.\nShe has the ceremonial title of speaker emerita and continues to hold sway even as Democratic members turn to a new generation of leadership.\nHer husband, Paul, was seriously injured in October 2022 by an intruder who struck him in the head with a hammer. The attacker intended to hold Pelosi hostage, though she was not home at the time.\nHarris’ Howard party cuts CNN, resumes music as tough race calls roll in\nAs midnight approached on the East Coast, the Harris campaign turned off its projected broadcasts of CNN at its election night watch party at Howard University. Instead, various high-energy remixes blared from speakers alongside floodlights flickering in tempo to hype the crowd.\nThe cheers in the crowd had become less frequent as more results came in from battleground states showing a tight race or victories for Trump.\nSome attendees began leaving the event though the vast majority of rallygoers remained. It is unclear if Harris will make an appearance at her alma mater.\nMelania Trump shows image of her son Barron voting\n“Voted for the first time - for his dad,” she shared on X.\nBarron Trump turned 18 years old in March and began his freshman year at New York University this fall.\nRepublicans secure Senate control\nThe GOP has won control of the Senate as Sen. Deb Fischer secures reelection in Nebraska.\nWith at least 51 Senate seats secured, Republicans will retake control of the chamber for the first time in four years. It gives the party a major power center in Washington and important power in confirming the next president’s Cabinet, as well as any Supreme Court justice if there is a vacancy.\nWith a handful of battleground races yet to be decided, Republicans still have an opportunity to grow their majority.\nGOP senators have already been looking at ways to extend tax cuts that were passed during Donald Trump’s first term, as well as sending funding towards toughened border security measures.\nHowever, the extent of Republicans’ power in Washington will also be determined by the results of the presidential and House races.\nRashida Tlaib wins reelection in Michigan House race\nRep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., the only Palestinian American in Congress, has won a fourth term in the House.\nTlaib represents a district with a large Arab-American population. She has been highly critical of Israel in its war against Hamas, describing its actions in Gaza as genocide.\nBut her comments have also evoked outrage from many of her colleagues. The Republican-led House voted last year to censure her for her statements regarding the war.\nTlaib said her criticism was directed toward Israel’s government and its leadership under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and vowed she “will not be silenced.”\nSen. Ted Cruz calls victory in Texas a mandate for tougher border measures\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas says he considers his reelection victory over Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred a mandate for stronger enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border.\nDuring a victory speech in front of supporters in his hometown of Houston, Cruz praised strong support from Hispanic voters. He singled out South Texas, where Cruz was performing much better in large border counties than he did during a narrow victory in 2018 over Beto O’Rourke.\n“Tonight we are witnessing incredible results, especially with Hispanics across the state of Texas,” Cruz told the crowd. “And we are seeing tonight generational change in South Texas. The results tonight, this decisive victory should shake the Democratic establishment to its core.”\nElection security official says bomb threats were all deemed noncredible\nJen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure and Security Agency, told reporters late Tuesday night that the election process endured “minor disruptive activity throughout the day” but that that activity was anticipated and planned for.\n“At this time, we’ve seen no evidence of malicious activity impacting the integrity … of election infrastructure,” she said.\nEasterly also said the bomb threats reported in multiple states were all deemed noncredible and did not affect the ability of voters to cast ballots.\nRepublicans gain steam towards Senate control\nThe GOP’s victory in the Ohio Senate race puts them on track to gain a Senate majority as long as they keep their seats in Texas and Nebraska.\nIn Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno defeated three-term Sen. Sherrod Brown.\nThe long-serving Ohio Democrat had tried to appeal to working-class voters and make access to abortion a top priority, but Moreno, a Cleveland businessman, cast Brown as too liberal for the conservative state, tying the long-serving Ohio Democrat to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\nAs long as Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Deb Fischer of Nebraska secure reelection, the GOP will have the Senate in hand.\nOhio sends its first Latino to U.S. Senate\nBernie Moreno will be the first Latino that Ohio has sent to the U.S. Senate, thanks to his victory over Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown.\nMoreno was born in Bogota, Colombia. He moved with his family to the United States at age 5 and became an American citizen when he was 18.\nHe built his fortune as a luxury car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur and will come to the Senate as one of its wealthiest members.\nWhy it’s possible for Nebraska and Maine to split their electoral votes\nForty-eight states and Washington, D.C., award all their presidential electoral votes to the candidate who wins statewide. And then there’s Nebraska and Maine.\nThe two states each award two electoral votes to the winner of the statewide vote, as well as one electoral vote to the popular vote winner in each congressional district. Nebraska has three congressional districts and five total electoral votes, while Maine has two congressional districts and four total electoral votes. This means that, although Nebraska is reliably Republican in statewide elections, a Democratic candidate could poach one electoral vote from the 2nd Congressional District, which includes the Democratic-friendly population center of Omaha.\nMeanwhile, Maine votes reliably Democratic in statewide elections, but Republicans are competitive in the more conservative 2nd Congressional District.\nRead more about how these states divvy up their electoral votes\nMusk vows to take on the size of the government if Trump wins\nElon Musk said he would seek to reduce the number of federal agencies if Trump wins the White House and gives the billionaire businessman a role in his administration.\nSpeaking on Tucker Carlson’s online show from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, Musk said he wanted to help Trump make government more efficient. Musk, a key Trump supporter, is the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the owner of X, formerly Twitter.\n“We’ve got a gigantic bureaucracy, we’ve got overregulation,” Musk told Carlson. “We need to let the builders of America build.”\nTrump’s North Carolina win gives him options toward 270 threshold\nBy winning North Carolina, Trump maintains options to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold.\nTrump can reach the magic number by carrying Georgia and Pennsylvania or by carrying Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin. He also can win by carrying Wisconsin and Arizona, as well as other combinations involving Nevada.\nBut that would require him to crack the blue wall of northern states Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\nTrump blitzed North Carolina in the final days of the campaign, stopping in four cities over four days and finishing his North Carolina campaign in Raleigh on Monday.\nHarris’ Howard night energy turns from festive to fretting as race calls roll in\nThe mood at Harris’ election night party at Howard University shifted from electric to anxious as race calls began rolling in. The musical performances and triumphant speeches on display earlier in the evening have been replaced by occasional DJ mixes and broadcast race calls.\nAnxious faces and hushed talk spread through the crowd as the night stretched on and the tightness of the race became apparent.\nThe still-packed crowd periodically went quiet as attendees watched returns come in on a giant projection of CNN. Rallygoers cheered and waved American flags as solidly blue states like Harris’ native California were called in her favor.\nHarris campaign chair stresses patience to nervous Democrats, staff watching vote totals\nHarris’ campaign chair stressed patience and resolve in a message to all campaign staff obtained by The Associated Press, arguing that the “closeness of the race is exactly what we prepared for” and predicting the race won’t “come into focus until the early morning hours.”\nThe message from campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon was meant for an audience beyond campaign staff, too, as nervous Democrats nationwide watch the race between Harris and Trump narrow to a handful of key battleground states.\n“As we have known all along, this is a razor thin race,” wrote O’Malley Dillon, citing turnout in Philadelphia and early vote totals in suburban Bucks County, Pennsylvania; outstanding votes in Detroit; and uncounted vote in Dane and Milwaukee counties in Wisconsin, two Democratic strongholds.\nWhile the longtime Democratic operative noted forthcoming counting in Nevada and Arizona, the memo highlighted how central the so-called “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania are to Harris’ path to victory.\n“We’ve been saying for weeks that this race might not be called tonight,” she wrote, adding later, “This is what we’ve been built for, so let’s finish up what we have in front of us tonight, get some sleep, and get ready to close out strong tomorrow.”\nTrump loses Colorado after railing against Aurora\nTrump turned the Colorado suburb of Aurora into part of his message against illegal immigration. In the end, he failed to capture the Mountain State, which has become increasingly Democratic in recent years.\nTrump likened Aurora to a “war zone” overrun by a Venezuelan gang that had taken over multiple buildings. Authorities pushed back against that characterization, saying it was a single block and the area was once again safe.\nColorado is one of the several states Trump visited down the stretch outside the seven most competitive states. In recent weeks, he also campaigned in California, New Mexico and, memorably, in New York for the rally at Madison Square Garden.\nAfter Senate loss, former Maryland governor calls for divided Americans to ‘believe in each other’\nLarry Hogan, a popular Republican who lost his bid for a U.S. Senate seat to Democrat Angela Alsobrooks, said in a speech to supporters that he congratulated Alsobrooks on her victory.\nHogan said “we can all take pride” in electing Alsobrooks as the first Black U.S. Senator from Maryland.\nHe said Americans are convinced that the country is “hopelessly divided” and that Washington is “completely dysfunctional.”\n“No matter what happens in this election, we as a country must move beyond talking only with those we agree with, and we need to stop dismissing or even hating those we disagree with,” Hogan said.\n“We have got to find a way to come together,” he said.\nMichigan’s top election official refutes Trump’s Detroit claims\nMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson refuted Trump’s social media claims of “heavy law enforcement” in Detroit on Tuesday before polls closed, calling them “not true.”\n“The former president said there was a strong law enforcement presence in Philadelphia and Detroit,” Benson said. “That was not true. We quickly debunked it.”\nAt a news conference in downtown Detroit after Michigan’s polls closed, Benson praised the election as “very successful,” and noted minimal issues. She added that the state is on track for record-breaking turnout.\nAustralian prime minister vows strong partnership with future US president\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told Parliament on Wednesday that his government will forge a strong partnership with whoever becomes U.S. president.\n“The election of a new President of the United States is always a moment of profound consequence for the world, for our region and for Australia,” Albanese said.\n“Our government will seek and build a strong partnership with whoever the American people choose as their next president. The alliance between Australia and the United States has always been bigger than individuals,” he added.\nThe crowd wants Babydog\nA few minutes into his speech after winning his U.S. Senate race, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice was joined on stage by his wife, children and grandchildren. But something was still missing.\nThe crowd at the Greenbrier Resort started chanting, “Babydog! Babydog!”\nSoon, Justice’s English bulldog, wearing a purple bow, trotted onstage to applause and took her usual spot in a chair next to him.\nJustice, a two-term governor, has regularly brought his 5-year-old dog to public appearances, including at his State of the State address in 2022 and at the Republican National Convention in July. Babydog even has her own bobblehead and appeared in new murals under the golden dome of the state Capitol.\n“What an incredible, incredible time we’ve had together,” Justice said. “She absolutely can makes you smile, and she loves everybody.”\nGOP sees House gains in North Carolina\nRepublicans have picked up three seats in North Carolina that were redistricted by the state’s GOP-controlled General Assembly.\nRepublicans Addison McDowell, Brad Knott and Tim Moore all won seats that were previously controlled by Democrats.\nThe victories give Republicans an early and potentially crucial boost in their bid to keep control of the House.\nBut redistricted seats are not all favorable to the GOP. Democrats are hoping to pick up a seat each in Louisiana and Alabama thanks to redistricting.\nAnxiety pools for Harris supporters at Detroit church watch party\nA “pray and watch party” is underway at Detroit’s Historic King Solomon Baptist Church, which features a rotating group of pastors saying a prayer as results roll in and about two dozen attendees.\nWhen TV coverage of the election goes to commercial, a pastor takes to the pulpit and says a few words.\n“I am so glad we are here,” said the Rev. Charles Williams II, the event’s host. “If I was at home, I would turn off the TV and go to bed. “Because this is challenging,” Williams said, reflecting the anxiety in the room filled with Harris supporters.\nMontana could be linchpin in race for Senate control\nRepublicans have banked their bid for a Senate majority on defeating Sen. Jon Tester in red-leaning Montana.\nThere have been no surprises in congressional races so far, but polls are closing in the Treasure State, as well as in Arizona and Nevada.\nDemocrats are hoping to somehow run the table in all three states.\nIn Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy, a retired Navy SEAL and businessman, is looking to flip the only statewide office that Democrats still hold there.\nIn Nevada, Democratic Sen. Jackie Rosen is trying to win reelection over Republican Sam Brown. And in Arizona, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is looking to make the leap to the Senate over Republican Kari Lake.\nVoter Voice: ‘Christmas is going to be really tight this year’\nTrump won North Carolinian Jordan Voigt’s vote because she believes he will make life safer for her children by curbing child sex trafficking and illegal immigration, the 34-year-old single mom told AP at a GOP watch party in Asheville, North Carolina.\n“Any time we go to a playground, my senses are very up,” Voigt said.\nAlso at stake is the economy: Voigt said she has been feeling the squeeze financially in the last two and a half years, and Hurricane Helene made things worse. Voigt said she and her family spent 18 days without power after the storm.\n“There is no wiggle room” in Voigt’s budget. “Christmas is going to be really tight this year,” she said.\nWhat to watch as polls are closing in Nevada\nResults could take a while since the state doesn’t release anything until the last person in line has voted. First updates usually include mailed and early votes. The state will add mailed ballots that arrive through Nov. 9, and these have gone strongly Democratic in the past. In recent elections Nevada has added more than 15% of its vote after Election Day. In a closely-watched Senate race, Democratic incumbent Jacky Rosen is facing Republican Sam Brown\nHours extended at nine precincts in eastern Arizona county\nA judge has ordered polling places to remain open two extra hours in nine precincts in an eastern Arizona county after a rocky start to Election Day that included malfunctioning equipment and a lack of printed ballots.\nApache County Superior Court Judge Michael Latham agreed to keep the polls open at the request of the Navajo Nation, which filed a lawsuit asking for extended hours due to the problems.\nMeanwhile, bomb threats to polling places at schools in neighboring Navajo County prompted some to close momentarily and one to evacuate and send students home for the day.\nAuthorities said they received email bomb threats at four locations in Navajo County, including at least three polling sites. They determined the threats were not credible.\nDemocrats send out the famous people\nDemocrats deployed celebrities to keep their voters fired up while they wait in long lines to cast their ballots.\nPaul Rudd handed out water to students at Temple University in Philadelphia. Jennifer Garner, Josh Gad, Mark Cuban and Demi Lovato communicated with voters via FaceTime in various battleground states.\nRepublicans have also encouraged their voters to stay in line, even after polls close.\n“Hi, Republicans. We’re doing really well,” Donald Trump said in a social media video. “If you’re in line, stay in line.”\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson reelected to a fifth term in the House\nJohnson became speaker a little more than a year ago after eight Republicans joined with Democrats in booting Kevin McCarthy from the job.\nThe social conservative inherited many of the same troubles that plagued his predecessor when it comes to unifying the conference. He has had to rely on Democratic votes to keep the federal government open and needed their help to prevent the kind of mutiny that toppled McCarthy.\nJohnson tied his political fortunes to Trump, showing up at the latter’s hush-money trial in New York and embracing his claims of political persecution.\nJohnson will be favored to remain as speaker if House Republicans maintain their majority, but could face a serious challenge as the Republican leader should the Democrats take control of the chamber.\nHistoric change as 2 Black women elected to Senate\nOnly three Black women have held Senate seats in the nation’s history, but that is about to change.\nDemocrats Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland have won Senate seats, and they will be the first Black women to serve together in the Senate.\nThe other Black women who have served as senators are Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, Laphonza Butler of California and current Vice President Kamala Harris of California.\nOhio key to Democratic hopes of holding Senate\nOhio is sending its electoral college votes to Donald Trump, but the state is also key to Democrats’ bid to keep control of the Senate and win the House.\nSen. Sherrod Brown, the only Democrat to win a nonjudicial statewide race in Ohio in over 10 years, is running for a fourth term by appealing to working-class voters and making access to abortion a top priority.\nHe is being challenged by Republican Bernie Moreno, a wealthy businessman backed by Donald Trump.\nThe state could have big consequences for the House as well. Democrats are defending a trio of House seats that are seen as competitive.\nNo surprises as polls close. Eyes now turn to Eastern battlegrounds\nThere has been little surprise in results so far with polls across most of the country having closed.\nTrump won Republican-leaning states including Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas, while Harris won a swath of New England and the Northeast including New Jersey and New York.\nMeanwhile, attention is gravitating toward the Eastern battleground states of Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries reelected to a seventh term\nJeffries succeeded Rep. Nancy Pelosi as the lead House Democrat after Republicans gained control of the chamber in the 2022 mid-terms and Democrats looked for a generational change in leadership.\nJeffries made sure Democrats delivered the votes necessary to prevent a federal default and to subsequently keep the government open.\nBut he declined to provide Kevin McCarthy with the Democratic votes he needed to stay on as speaker when eight members of the GOP revolted against McCarthy.\nIf Democrats are able to gain the House majority, he would almost assuredly be elected the next House speaker.\nKim, elected to Senate from New Jersey, says he’s ‘humbled and grateful’\nDemocratic Rep. Andy Kim, who won election to Senate from New Jersey, said that “as a son of immigrants” he never imagined he would become the first Korean American to serve in the chamber.\n“I’m deeply humbled and grateful to NJ and for everyone who got us here,” Kim wrote on X, the website formerly known as Twitter. “I promise I’ll serve with honor and integrity as a public servant for all.”\nBiden congratulates Democrats on their victories\nPresident Biden made a round of congratulatory calls to Democrats who have emerged victorious on Election Day.\nAccording to the White House, he’s called Lisa Blunt Rochester, who won a U.S. Senate seat in his home state of Delaware, and Matt Meyer, who was elected the state’s governor. He also called the outgoing governor, John Carney, who was elected mayor of Wilmington.\nOther calls went to Andy Kim, who will be a senator from New Jersey, and Josh Stein, the next governor of North Carolina.\nChinese accounts boost Russian election disinformation\nRussian disinformation aiming to reduce trust in the U.S. election received some last-minute help from China, according to research from the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.\nInvestigators identified several videos linked to Russia that made false claims about voting. Some of the videos mimicked legitimate U.S. news outlets and featured fake audio clips of law enforcement officials supposedly acknowledging widespread voter fraud.\nThe researchers found the videos were being amplified by a network of fake social media accounts that originated in China. The accounts had spread pro-China propaganda in the past and shifted their focus to the U.S. election only recently.\nRepublican Mark Robinson loses North Carolina gubernatorial bid after tumultuous campaign\nMark Robinson, the North Carolina Republican gubernatorial candidate rocked by a CNN report indicating he posted racist and explicit messages on a pornography site more than a decade ago, has lost his race against Democrat Josh Stein, AP projects.\nThe loss is a cap on a turbulent run for Robinson, the state’s lieutenant governor, who rocketed to conservative fame in 2018 by seizing on Trump’s MAGA movement.\nHis campaign was continually tagged with controversial comments Robinson made about everything from abortion to race to gay rights. Trump compared Robinson to Martin Luther King Jr. before his pornography site scandal, and did not explicitly back away from him after the scandal engulfed the North Carolina Republican’s campaign.\nStein, the state’s Attorney General, will succeed Roy Cooper, North Carolina’s popular two-term governor who was term-limited. The race was one of the most closely watched governor’s races in the nation this year.\nPennsylvania officials urge patience when it comes to a lengthy vote-counting process\nState officials are preaching calm and patience in the counting of votes in the face of large voter turnout across the state and a spate of disruptive bomb threats at polling locations and government buildings.\nGov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said at a Tuesday night news conference that every legal, eligible vote will be counted. He says that takes time and that the state’s goal is to do it right and accurately.\nAl Schmidt, the state’s top elections official, said in-person turnout numbers will not be available Tuesday night. He said the state’s counties could not even begin processing and opening the millions of returned mail ballots until 7 a.m. EST Tuesday and that the last of them would not have been received until 8 p.m. EST.\nConstitutional amendment that protects abortion fails in Florida\nA measure that would have protected abortion rights in Florida’s state constitution failed Tuesday after not meeting the 60% threshold to pass.\nThe rejection of the measure makes Florida the first state where a measure protecting abortion rights failed after Roe V. Wade was overturned in 2022.\nThe initiative would have prevented lawmakers from creating and enforcing restrictions or prohibitions on abortions before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health.\nAmendment supporters were hoping to overturn Florida’s current six-week abortion ban.\nThe rejection of the measure makes Florida one of the first states where voters opposed protecting abortion rights after Roe V. Wade was overturned in 2022.\nThe Associated Press declared the amendment was rejected at 9:06 p.m. EST.\n‘No credible threat’ in Pennsylvania, says Gov. Shapiro\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said there had been multiple bomb threats called into polling locations across the state, but said so far there is “no credible threat” to the public.\nShapiro, a Democrat, spoke at a news conference. In a statement, the Pennsylvania State Police said they were working with local partners to respond, if needed.\nNeither Shapiro nor police gave more details about who might be behind the bomb threats or why Shapiro believed there was no threat to the public.\nPolls closed in the presidential battleground state at 8 p.m. EST, except for two jurisdictions where judges granted requests for extensions.\nJim Jordan wins reelection to House\nRep. Jim Jordan, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a Donald Trump loyalist, has won reelection to a 10th term in the House representing a conservative district in central Ohio.\nJordan has spent the run-up to the election campaigning for Republicans across the country. Many see his activities as a shadow race of sorts to become GOP leader, particularly if it loses the majority and members seek a fresh start.\nJordan denies he’s running for any leadership job.\nJordan made an unsuccessful bid to become speaker when eight Republicans joined with Democrats in ousting then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\nTrump endorsed Jordan, but more centrist Republicans viewed him as too extreme and objected to rewarding someone on the party’s right flank after some had helped oust McCarthy.\nFlorida rejects abortion measure, further limiting access in the South\nFlorida voters reject abortion rights amendment and keep in place Gov. Ron DeSantis’ 6-week ban as the initiative fails to reach the required 60% threshold. The measure faced an uphill battle in the deeply red state where Trump, a Florida resident, said during the campaign that he would vote against it.\nAlmost every region of Florida shifted to the right\nIn comparison to 2020, nearly all of Florida has moved right during this presidential election cycle.\nMiami-Dade County saw the greatest increase, with an 18 percentage point shift right. It was enough to move the county from the Democrats’ column in 2020 to the Republicans’ this year.\nSome precincts in Boston ran out of ballots\nIn Massachusetts, the group Lawyers for Civil Rights warned that multiple precincts in Boston ran out of ballots, including in the city’s Hyde Park, Roslindale and West Roxbury neighborhoods.\nIn some locations, ballots were replenished but only after wait times of up to two hours, the group said.\nThe secretary of the commonwealth’s office said the Boston Elections Department opted not to send all their ballots to polling places.\nSecretary of State William Galvin told the department to send ballots using police cars. Poll workers were also told get contact information for voters who chose not to wait. Those voters have been contacted and anyone in line at 8 p.m. will be able to vote.\nOnce the bellwether, Florida quietly slides to Trump\nFlorida is the third-biggest prize of the night in electoral votes, but Trump’s win is no surprise since Florida has been trending Republican for the past decade.\nThe last Democrat to carry Florida was Barack Obama in 2012, but it since has slipped decidedly into GOP ranks in statewide elections.\nRon DeSantis won reelection by nearly 20 percentage points in 2022, a political lifetime after the contested 2000 presidential election came down to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to stop the recount in the race between Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush.\nHarris’ election watch party becomes another homecoming at Howard\nThe election night event is channeling the spirit of HBCU homecomings with a kickoff from Howard’s “Showtime Marching Band.” The energy continued with various line dances including “Wobble” by rapper V.I.C., Beyoncé’s rendition of Maze & Frankie Beverly’s “Before I Let Go” and “Jerusalema” by Master KG and Nomcebo Zikode.\nHomecoming season is a sacred tradition at many HBCUs. Although Howard had its homecoming in mid-October, the live music and dancing is reminiscent of the annual festival that fills the same yard on campus and brings students, alumni and community members together to celebrate.\nRepublicans shore up Florida’s Senate seat\nRepublicans holding control of Florida’s Senate seat means that the race for control of the chamber is still hotly contested.\nDemocrats are defending seats across the map, including in Michigan, Montana, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\nIf Republicans can win one of those, it will put them in prime position to take control of the chamber.\nDemocrats have a long-shot bid to win Texas if they can somehow unseat Sen. Ted Cruz, a firebrand conservative.\nDisinformation videos impersonate the FBI\nThe FBI is warning that several fabricated videos are misusing its name and insignia to promote false claims of problems at the polls.\nA written statement purported to come from the FBI urges media and bloggers not to publish information about attacks at polling stations, saying dissemination of stories about violence could cause such incidents to increase. The FBI says that statement is false and did not come from the bureau.\nOne fabricated video that impersonates the FBI and a federal government agency urges schools to suspend educational activities through November 11 because of the risk of violence, shootings and riots. Another claims the FBI received 9,000 complaints about malfunctioning voting machines. The FBI says neither video came from the bureau and the contents of both are false.\nThe FBI did not identify who might be responsible for the manufactured videos, but it’s the latest warning of disinformation that’s being spread and the latest instance of the FBI singling out the misuse of its name and insignia to promote false narratives.\nPennsylvania offers several key House races in fight for majority\nPennsylvania is not just a major player in the the presidential race.\nIt will also go a long way in deciding who controls the majority in the House next year.\nThree Democratic incumbents look to fend off Republican challengers in competitive races.\nRep. Matt Cartwright is seeking reelection to a seventh term in a district that Trump carried in 2020. Another perennial Republican target is Rep. Susan Wild. They represent neighboring districts with similar geographies: small cities, suburbs and stretches of rural eastern Pennsylvania. First-term Democratic Rep. Chris Deluzio is also in a competitive race in the western part of the state.\nMeanwhile, Democrats are hoping to unseat hard-right Republican Rep. Scott Perry, a Trump loyalist and the former chairman of the most conservative wing within the GOP majority — the House Freedom Caucus.\nMissouri election workers killed in flash flood\nTwo election workers in southern Missouri died when their cars were swept away by a fast-flooding creek. The deaths were among five in Missouri blamed on flash floods that followed torrential rains across the state.\nIn Wright County, vehicles driven by a 70-year-old man and a 73-year-old woman were swept away by flooding Beaver Creek around 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said. The bodies were found more than four hours later.\nWhat to watch as polls are closing in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Michigan\nPennsylvania: Many of the earliest results will include mailed ballots, which have tended to favor Democratic candidates in the past. The state reported almost twice as many registered Democrats as Republicans voted in advance this year. But any early advantage could change later as more Election Day votes are counted.\nMichigan: Polls are about to close across most of Michigan. In the past, initial returns sometimes favored Republicans because Democratic-dominated Wayne County, the state’s largest and home to Detroit, was slow to report mailed votes. But this year, counties may process mailed ballots earlier. That’s expected to make the count go faster.\nMaryland: The first results will include early in-person and absentee votes, which could mean an early lift for Democrat Angela Alsobrooks since those votes typically have favored Democrats in the past. That margin could shrink if Election Day votes arrive with a greater makeup of Republicans. Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan is trying to become Maryland’s first GOP U.S. senator in over 30 years.\nAn update on bomb threats at Georgia polling places\nOf the 177 polling places in Georgia’s Fulton County, 32 received bomb threats Tuesday, county Police Chief W. Wade Yates said. Some of the threats were called directly into the locations where voting was happening, while others were called into 911 or received by email, he said.\nAs a result, voting hours were extended at five polling places in Georgia’s Fulton County that were briefly closed because of bomb threats that were determined to be non-credible.

Sherrod Brown, as well as three battleground House seats.\nRepublicans are also trying to make gains in North Carolina, where redistricting has tipped three House seats in their favor.\nThey could also pick up a fourth House seat in the state if Republican Laurie Buckhout can unseat incumbent Rep. Don Davis, a Democrat.\nTrump adviser projects confidence\nSenior Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski is projecting confidence as polls begin to close.\n“He feels great,” he said of Trump, speaking at the former president’s watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida. “We are ready, when the election is called, to begin the transition to put this country back on track.”\nTrump’s campaign sees its easiest path to the nomination running through Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n“Donald Trump has momentum,” he argued.\nAs for the persistent gender gap in polls, he says, “Women do not vote only on their gender … It’s a fallacy.”\nSenate control deadlocked\nDemocrats’ hope of keeping control of the Senate is hanging by a thread after the seat flip in West Virginia.\nTo win control of the chamber, Republicans need to pick up a seat in any one of several battleground states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Montana or Nevada.\nDemocrats’ best chance at flipping a seat back in their favor is likely in Texas, where Democrat Colin Allred, a current House member, is challenging Sen. Ted Cruz.\nWhat to watch as polls are closing in Ohio\nPolls are closing in Ohio, where initial results arrive shortly after polls close.\nThose results are usually advance votes that historically tend to favor Democrats.\nIn 2020 and 2022, Democratic presidential and Senate candidates took early leads that eroded over the course of the night. Republicans ended up winning both races.\nIncumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing a tough challenge from Republican Bernie Moreno.\nMAGA hats have taken over the Palm Beach County Convention Center\nTrump is holding a massive watch party at the convention center tonight. The former president himself will be watching the results come in at Mar-a-Lago, with family members and club members.\nIt’s TBD when — or even whether — Trump will decide to motorcade over to the venue.\nIncumbents trying to swap Georgia House districts\nCourt-ordered redistricting in Georgia has substantially changed both the state’s 6th and 7th House districts, and the parties could potentially trade control of the seats.\nAfter redistricting, the Republican-held 6th district leans toward Democrats, while the GOP believes it will gain the Democratic-controlled 7th district.\nEven the respective incumbents for those seats are trying to pull off the swap.\nRepublican Rep. Richard McCormick is running for the 6th district, and Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath, who previously represented the 6th district, is running for McCormick’s old seat.\nFederal cybersecurity officials say no evidence to back up claims of widespread fraud in Pennsylvania\nA senior official at the federal cybersecurity agency says no nationwide security problems are threatening the integrity of the elections, and is pushing back on claims of fraud in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania.\nCait Conley, a senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told reporters that though officials have responded to bomb threats, disinformation and other problems, there are no major incidents with a national-level impact.\nAsked about claims of widespread fraud in Pennsylvania being advanced by Donald Trump and some of his supporters, Conley said federal officials had been in close contact with their state and local counterparts across the country and “we see no data or reporting to support these claims.”\nMultiple Pennsylvania officials, including Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, have also said they had not seen any signs of cheating and have called the election secure.\nPolls closing in key Virginia races\nAs polls close in Virginia, a pair of competitive House races could give an early hint of who is faring better in the race for House control.\nIn northern Virginia, Democrat Eugene Vindman and Republican Derrick Anderson, both Army veterans and lawyers, are vying for a House seat.\nIn the military-heavy southeast part of the state, Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans is running for reelection against a fellow Navy veteran, Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal. Meanwhile in Georgia, Democrats and Republicans are poised to swap control of a pair of redistricted House districts.\nWhat to watch as polls are closing\nFlorida: First polls are about to close in much of Florida, which reports votes quickly. The first votes released will be early in-person and mailed votes. Those have tended to favor Democrats in the past, but it’s not clear that trend will hold this year. Florida adds Election Day votes soon after and counts few votes after election night, so races tend to wrap up quickly.\nGeorgia: Polls are about to close in the battleground state of Georgia. The first votes reported have historically included at least some cast before Election Day. We don’t know if the advance vote this year will favor Democrats as it has in the past. Voters don’t register by party in Georgia.\nPolls are closing soon in 6 states\nAt 7 p.m. EST, polls will close in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia, though some areas of Indiana and Kentucky closed at 6 p.m.\nAt 7:30 p.m. EST, polls will close in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia.\nVermont’s Republican governor says he voted for Harris\nPhil Scott, Vermont’s Republican governor, told reporters outside his polling place that he voted for Harris over Trump, his party’s presidential candidate.\nScott said it was “not an easy thing to do being the Republcian sitting governor and voting against your party’s nominee,” according to video from NBC 5. But Scott said he “came to the conclusion that I had to put country over party.”\nScott voted for President Joe Biden in 2020.\nMusk says his PAC will expand its work after Election Day\nBillionaire Elon Musk said his pro-Trump super PAC will continue its work after the election, focusing on the 2026 midterms as well as local prosecutorial races.

Musk repeated his support for Trump and said that a Trump victory would reflect an electorate eager for change.\n“I think there’s a sea change in the country,” said Musk, the owner of Tesla and SpaceX. “I hope I’m not wrong about that.”\nDetroit police patrol convention center where ballots are being counted\nMore than a dozen Detroit police officers were milling around late afternoon inside Huntington Place and in the area immediately outside the doors to the massive convention room where election workers were to count ballots.\nBarricades are up outside the room and escalators to and from the area have been shut off.\nEveryone entering has to go through metal detectors. Any bags they have are being checked by security.\nDetroit police said there were no reported issues inside or outside of Huntington Place. As of 6 p.m. EST, traffic outside the center was light with no protesters in sight.\n“It’s all hands on deck,” Deputy Chief Franklin Hayes told The Associated Press last month. “We have a comprehensive plan.”\nPennsylvania officials deny Trump’s cheating claim\nOfficials associated with both political parties are denying Trump’s claim of “massive cheating” in Philadelphia.\nOn social media, one of three Philadelphia election board members, Seth Bluestein, a Republican, said there is “absolutely no truth to this allegation. It is yet another example of disinformation.” Voting in the city is “safe and secure,” he said.\nDemocrat Gov. Josh Shapiro’s Department of State said, “Pennsylvania counties, including Philadelphia, are running a safe and secure election.”\nTrump provided no details about the alleged cheating. His spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment about what he meant.\nMore bomb threats at Atlanta-area polling places\nAnother metro Atlanta county has seen voting disrupted by bomb threats. About an hour before polls were to close, officials in DeKalb County said they received bomb threats against five polling places.\nOfficials in the overwhelmingly Democratic suburb said voting had been suspended at those locations until police confirm there are no bombs. County officials say they’re seeking a court order to extend voting, which is routine in Georgia when a polling place is disrupted. Some polling places in Fulton and Gwinnett counties were targeted earlier Tuesday. Those threats were found to be false.\n“Rest assured that we are working quickly to ensure every voter will have an opportunity to cast their ballot despite these bomb threats,” DeKalb elections director Keisha Smith said in a statement.\nJudge blocks improper hand count at Pennsylvania polling place\nTrump’s allies appeared worried about turnout among men today, urging them to vote as Election Day drew to a close.\n“If you know any men who haven’t voted, get them to the polls,” Stephen Miller, a longtime adviser to the Republican nominee, posted on X at 5:58 p.m. EST\nCharlie Kirk, the leader of the conservative group Turning Point, seemed concerned earlier in the day. “Turnout is mixed and not where we want it to be,” he wrote on X. “We need more people to vote. We can’t let turnout flatline.”\nHe struck a more positive note at 4:11 p.m. EST “The men are arriving,” he posted. “Turnout is SURGING.”\nTrump allies urge men to cast their ballots\nTrump’s allies appeared worried about turnout among men today, urging them to vote as Election Day drew to a close.\n“If you know any men who haven’t voted, get them to the polls,” Stephen Miller, a longtime adviser to the Republican nominee, posted on X at 5:58 p.m.\nCharlie Kirk, the leader of the conservative group Turning Point, seemed concerned earlier in the day. “Turnout is mixed and not where we want it to be,” he wrote on X. “We need more people to vote.

This year there was a surge in support from members of these groups, many of whom were excited by Harris’ historic presidential run despite being barred from endorsing candidates.\nThe vice president is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., which was founded at Howard University in 1908. Harris pledged as a senior at Howard in 1986.\nA technical glitch meant long waits in Apache County\nA technical glitch in ballot printers at more than a dozen polling places in Arizona’s rural Apache County meant long waits for voters.\n“Poll workers were encouraging people to leave and come back later in the day when the printer was fixed,” said Zane James, who voted in the community of Wheatfields after waiting 2 1/2 hours in 40-degree weather.\nThe printer was fixed, “but five to 10 people left and I don’t know if they are coming back,” he said.\nRita Vaughan, the Apache County elections director, said technicians fixed the problem after it emerged early Tuesday. She said polling places stayed open and people voted with paper ballots or accessible voting devices used by people with disabilities or language issues.\nThe Native vote helped push Biden over the top in Arizona in 2020. Trump drew a diverse crowd, including Navajo families from neighboring Arizona, when he visited New Mexico last week.\nHours at Georgia polling places extended following bomb threats\nVoting hours have been extended at five polling places in Georgia’s Fulton County that were briefly closed earlier in the day because of bomb threats that were determined to be noncredible.\nEach voting location’s hours have been extended for as long as they were closed. The extensions range from 10 minutes at one location to 45 minutes at two locations.\nJudge in Georgia calls Republican lawsuit ‘frivolous’\nA federal judge Tuesday scolded Republican Party attorneys for what he called a “frivolous” lawsuit that accused election officials in seven Georgia counties of breaking the law by letting voters hand-deliver their absentee ballots over the weekend.\nAn attorney for the Republican National Committee and the Georgia Republican Party told U.S. District Court Judge R. Stan Baker he wasn’t trying to stop the 1,300 ballots from being counted but wanted them kept separate from other ballots.\nThe groups previously indicated they wanted the ballots as potential evidence for future litigation.\nThe GOP lawyers argued it was illegal for county election officials to accept mail ballots dropped off in person after early voting ended Friday.\nBaker said Georgia law clearly states that county election officials are required to accept absentee ballots until the polls close on Election Day.\nJudge declines to extend voting hours in Louisville after morning delays\nA judge has declined to grant a two-hour extension of voting hours in Kentucky’s most populous county after problems with electronic poll books led to delays at some precincts.\nElection officials in Jefferson County, which includes Louisville, said delays involved loading poll books to include the 113,000 early voters who cast ballots before Election Day.\nAshley Tinius, a spokesperson for the Jefferson County Clerk, said no voters were turned away and the electronic issues were resolved later Tuesday morning.\nThe Kentucky Democratic Party asked a judge to extend voting from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The party’s motion said, “Delays caused by the e-polling books crash caused some voters to leave their place in line and forego casting a ballot.”\n“There were numerous instances of voters unable to be checked-in and issued ballots,” the motion reads.\nThe state Republican Party opposed the motion, arguing that only the Kentucky General Assembly can set election times and any vote cast after 6 p.m. would be illegal.\n‘Human error’ forces recount of 30,000 absentee ballots in Milwaukee\nElection officials in Milwaukee are recounting more than 30,000 absentee ballots because doors on the ballot tabulators were not properly sealed.\nThe recounting was being done “out of an abundance of caution,” said Melissa Howard, spokesperson for the Milwaukee Election Commission.\nThere was no reason to believe that any ballots already counted had been tampered with, she said.\nHoward said they were taking the step of recounting all of the ballots in an effort to be “completely, fully transparent.” The problem was due to human error, she said.\nThe decision will delay the reporting of about 105,000 absentee ballots that could determine whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump win Wisconsin.\nA small set of polls in Indiana and Kentucky close at 6 p.m. EST\nPolls in a few Indiana districts across the state and polls on the eastern side of Kentucky are the first to close in the nation.\nThe first large poll closing comes at 7 p.m. EST. That closure includes most of Florida, all of Georgia and Virginia, among others.\nPennsylvania county goes to court to block improper hand count\nFayette County has gone to court to block a local judge of elections from doing a unilateral hand count of ballots in violation of the state’s election code.\nMarybeth Kuznik, director of the Fayette County Bureau of Elections, says in a court filing that Washington Township Judge of Election Vincent Manetta “reported that after polls close today, he intends to remove the ballots from the ballot box and audit or hand count the votes cast for each presidential candidate.”\nCompleted ballots are supposed to be run through tabulating equipment.\nKuznik asked a judge to order Manetta to comply with state election law. The judge has yet to rule.\nA white substance was found on a ballot envelope in Salt Lake County, Utah\nThe envelope was sequestered, tested and found to not be harmful, according to police. Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, who oversees elections statewide, commended the county clerk and her employees for acting swiftly to ensure the safety of those in the area.\n“This incident will be fully investigated. Anyone attempting to intimidate election workers or disrupt election administration in any way can expect to face criminal charges,” Henderson said.\nGeorgia voting sites receive bomb threats\nBomb threats to Georgia voting sites were made over the internet and included Cyrillic letters, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said. That gave election officials a clue about the origins of the threats, he said at an early evening briefing in Atlanta.\n“We jumped on it quickly and then the FBI then followed our lead,” he said. He said that once the FBI released a statement about the matter earlier Tuesday, the threats “kind of tapered off.”\nHe said of the culprits: “I guess they realized that dog won’t hunt today in Georgia.”\nSenior Harris campaign official says the VP has an advantage with late deciders\nHarris senior campaign adviser Stephanie Cutter said in an MSNBC appearance that the vice president stayed focused in the final weeks of the campaign on how she aims to “make your life better” while Trump seemed consumed by grievances.\nIndeed, Trump in the final stretch remarked that he wouldn’t mind if an assassin had to “shoot through the fake news” to get to him. He raised eyebrows by vowing to protect women “whether the women like it or not.” And his campaign had to clean up after a comedian warming up the crowd at Madison Square Garden rally referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.”\n“I’m not going to make any predictions,” Cutter said.” “But I do think that we finished very strong. And if you were making your decision in the last couple weeks of this campaign, I think, you know, by significant margins, people were deciding for Vice President Harris.”\nEmpire State Building lights will mark swing state winners as results roll in\nThe lights on the Manhattan icon will change color every time The Associated Press declares a victor in one of the decisive swing states, according to a post on its official account on X, formerly Twitter.\nThe 103-floor skyscraper’s tower lights will shine blue for five minutes if Harris claims one of the battlegrounds and shine red for five minutes if Trump wins one.\nWhen one of the candidates reaches the winning threshold of 270 electoral votes, the Art Deco landmark will again be lit up to correspond to the victorious political party: red for Republican Trump or blue for Democrat Harris.\nBarring a major surprise, the seven states where the race for the White House will likely be decided are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\nRudy Giuliani seen in a Mercedes similar to the one he was ordered to turn over\nRudy Giuliani was not shy as he drove up to a polling station in Palm Beach, Florida, in a blue Mercedes that appeared to be the one a federal judge ordered him to turn over to the two Georgia election workers who won a defamation lawsuit against the former mayor of New York.\nSitting in the passenger seat of what appears to be a 1980 Mercedes-Benz 500SL, Giuliani smiled and waved to supporters and photographers at the polling place where Trump cast his ballot as he tried to reclaim the presidency.\nIt could not be immediately confirmed if Giuliani was riding in the same car he was supposed to turn over. The judge gave the staunch Trump supporter until October 29 to do so. U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman has ordered Giuliani to appear in a New York courtroom on Thursday to explain why he missed a deadline.\n“Our lawyers have requested documentation to transfer over the title of the vehicle, and haven’t heard back from opposing counsel,” said Giuliani spokesman Ted Goodman.\nDoug Emhoff’s ex-wife casts ballot for Harris\nKerstin Emhoff, second gentleman Doug Emhoff’s ex-wife, posted a video casting a vote for Harris.\n“I’ve been so moved by watching emotional videos posted by people after voting for Kamala & Tim,” she wrote. “Voting for our daughters, wives, sisters, from red and blue states. This is that moment. I proudly cast my vote for my friend and family Kamala Harris!”\nKerstin Emhoff has been a vocal supporter of Harris’ campaign, including attending the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\nResults for 2 North Carolina counties delayed briefly as precincts close later\nTwo counties in battleground North Carolina will delay turning in their results by 30 minutes after the State Board of Elections agreed to extend the close of voting at two precincts due to technical problems there on Tuesday morning.\nThe board voted to push the closing time at one precinct in Burke County and another precinct in Wilson County to 8 p.m.\nAccording to election officials, likely voters at the Wilson County precinct were unable to cast ballots for almost an hour and a half because a printer needed to generate voter authorization forms wasn’t working. And in Burke County, people couldn’t vote for potentially 30 or 40 minutes when a precinct laptop computer with the official pollbook had a problem.\nThe state board won’t publish unofficial results from Burke and Wilson counties until voting ends at the precincts. Results in the state’s other 98 counties can be reported at the normal closing time.\nJacksonville voters briefly diverted after suspicious package found in polling place\nVoters arriving at a polling place in Jacksonville, Florida, were diverted to another voting location for a short time Tuesday after a suspicious package was found outside.\nSupervisor of Elections Jerry Holland said in an email that about 20 voters were sent to other locations for about 40 minutes before operations at the polling place resumed. The package ended up being the personal belongings of a homeless person, he said.\nDenver-area authorities look into ballot issues at adult day care facility\nAuthorities in the Denver area are investigating after election officials discovered “discrepancies” with signatures on several mail ballots sent from an adult day care facility in the city.\nThat’s according to Denver clerk and recorder Paul Lopez in a statement.\nElection workers in Colorado check the signatures on mail ballots against voter signatures on file to make sure they’re submitted by the voter the ballot was sent to. Lopez said his office notified law enforcement and the Denver district attorney’s office was investigating. He also said law enforcement in nearby counties were also investigating but did not explain why.\nDenver’s KMGH-TV, which first reported the investigation, said ballots from the facility were sent to six counties.\nColorado overwhelmingly votes by mail.\nVoting machines malfunction in central Iowa county\nIn Central Iowa’s Story County, home to about 100,000 people and the city of Ames, voting machines at some precincts malfunctioned, portending possible delays to reporting results.\n“We are aware of technical issues regarding tabulators in some precincts in Story County,” said Ashley Hunt Esquivel, a spokesperson for Iowa Secretary of State’s Office. “The auditor is working with the vendor and our office to resolve it. It is not stopping anyone from casting a single ballot. It may impact how quickly we can report results.”\nStory County Auditor Lucy Martin told the Des Moines Register that machines did not read “certain ballot styles” at about 12 of the county’s 45 polling locations. Election workers would have to count ballots at those locations by hand, according to local Democratic and Republican Party officials. The machines were tested and the cause of the technical difficulties was unknown, Martin added.\nHarris urges North Carolinians who haven’t voted to get going\n“The path to the White House runs through North Carolina,” Harris said in an interview on Raleigh’s Foxy 107.1. “And it’s a tight race. We are tied. Every vote matters.”\nHarris told host Karen Clark she plans to work the phones until polls close to get out every vote she can.\n“This is about turning the page and bringing in a new generation of leadership for America,” Harris said.\nHarris visits Democratic National Committee phone bank in Washington on Election Day\nKamala Harris used her visit to a phone bank hosted by the Democratic National Committee on Tuesday to both thank the supporters working to turn out the vote and make calls herself.\n“This truly represents the best of who we are,” Harris told the supporters making calls at the phone bank. She was then handed a cell phone and joined in the phone bank.\n“I am well,” Harris told the person. “Have you voted already?”\nThe person responded, to which Harris said, “You did? Thank you.”\nIn Richmond, Virginia, Electoral Board removes precinct chief over complaints\nIn Richmond, Virginia, the local Electoral Board held an emergency meeting to remove a precinct chief.\nBoard Chair Starlet Stevens said in a telephone interview that 11 voters were given ballots that only had the presidential race and not local races.\nBecause they cast the ballots, they were unable to redo their votes with the correct ballots.\nStevens said the Board voted to remove the precinct chief not for the error but because the chief was being “disrespectful.”\nThe Board also received a complaint that the precinct chief refused to help a person who wanted to vote curbside, something that Virginia law allows for anyone 65 and older or physically disabled.\nElection stressed? Here’s what some experts recommend\nThree out of four American adults believe this election is vital for the future of democracy. They believe that the stakes are high — and for some, so are their stress levels.\nBut there’s more you can do than doomscroll and hold your breath between news alerts.\nSome experts advise using meditation and mindfulness to ease their stress. Headspace, a mental health company and app, has a whole series of guided meditations called its “politics without panic” collection.\nIt’s also important to be mindful of news intake and social media use and vetting news sources to ensure you’re not consuming inflammatory misinformation. Experts said “self-care” is critical, too, including eating well, exercising and getting enough sleep.\nChurches also are drawing on meditation and breathing practices to help their congregants.\nAt an Episcopal church in Pennsylvania’s heartland, the Rev. David Peck has led a weekly gathering called “Contemplative Citizenship,” which guides apply ancient techniques of prayer and meditation that enable people to respond to conflict more deliberately\n‘My faith in this country has been so restored,’ Walz says of 2024 experience\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz told reporters Tuesday that his experience as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate “restored” his faith in the nation.\n“This is truly a remarkable thing we do every four years,” he said in a conversation with reporters outside his campaign plane. “It’s democracy. It’s messy. It’s beautiful. It’s the people.”\n“My faith in this country has been so restored,” he added.\nWalz said he had not talked with Harris on Election Day but projected confidence that they would prevail over former President Donald Trump.\n“I just can’t describe the difference in the vibe that is out there with folks and how hungry they are for something different,” he said\nFor funny man Ken Jeong, this Election Day is serious\nKen Jeong is funny. But not on Election Day. Today, he’s serious.\nThe actor and comedian (who also is a doctor) was working the phone banks to support Harris, calling voters to make last-minute pushes in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Georgia.\n“It’s been quite inspiring,” Jeong said. “I’ve never been on something like this on such a grand scale.”\nJeong said most of the people he called didn’t know who he was, but he randomly connected with a man in Michigan who had attended one of his standup shows.\nAnd some of the people he called didn’t agree with him politically, which Jeong had no problem with.\n“Even on these phone calls and phone banking, I listen to opinions that are completely different from mine,” Jeong said. “And I don’t discount anybody.”\nDo you want more Steve Kornacki? Peacock has you covered tonight\nComing around 6 p.m. Eastern: Kornacki Cam.\nThe super-popular NBC News National Political Correspondent Steve Kornacki will be part of a multiview experience put together by Peacock and is expected to last until around 2 a.m.\nAlso part of the multiview (basically, some of the same technology NBC utilized during the Paris Olympics) is a live stream of NBC News coverage and analysis, projected Electoral College results — and lots and lots of Kornacki, who’ll be at his big board to break down all the numbers.\n“We’re caffeinating and hydrating him. We’re making sure he’s eating,” NBC’s Craig Melvin wrote on X. ”@SteveKornacki, the national treasure, is rested and eager for his quadrennial Super Bowl.”\nNatural gas leak prompts the closure of a polling place outside Detroit\nOfficials in Northville, Michigan, closed a polling place at midday and sent voters to another precinct in the Detroit suburb because of a natural gas leak. Consumers Energy was investigating the leak.\nAfter missing amendments, corrected ballots are being sent to St. Clair County, Alabama\nBallots sent to some polling locations in St. Clair County, Alabama, for Tuesday’s election were missing a state amendment and a local amendment, local probate judge Andrew Weathington said at a news conference Tuesday.\nJudge Weathington said the first round of corrected ballots had been ordered from Birmingham and estimated they would arrive just before 2 p.m. CT.\n“I’m as frustrated as anybody, and I understand that we have to take off work and all that stuff to go vote. And I apologize. I don’t know what else to say other than we’re very, very sorry,” Weathington said.\nThe local circuit court judge ordered polling locations across the country to stay open for two additional hours this evening, until 9 p.m. to accommodate the error. Weathington said ballots that had already been cast would still be counted. There are just over 95,000 residents in St. Clair County, according to the 2023 U.S. Census.\nOfficials warned residents to continue to expect long lines at polling locations.\nAlabama Secretary of State Wes Allen said in an email that his office is aware of the delays and stressed that his office is not involved in inspecting and printing the ballots.\nFBI says bomb threats to several states came from Russian email domains, deemed non-credible\nThe FBI did not identify the states in question, but Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said earlier Tuesday that the state’s election process had snuffed out some bomb threats that he said came from Russia.\nOfficials in Fulton County, Georgia, said they received “multiple calls” and the threats forced a brief closure of two polling places.\nThe bomb threats were among multiple disturbances that U.S. officials are tracking.\nBut Cait Conley, a senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told reporters on a call Tuesday there were no national-level security incidents that were threatening to disrupt the election on a wide scale.\nOfficials continue to warn of what they say is an unprecedented level of foreign influence and disinformation that they expect will persist beyond Election Day.\nAnother way that Trump is very ‘on line’\nMany Americans will urge voters to stay in line and wait to vote today. Or will they say stay “on” line?\nThe slight variation — on vs. in — is a regional difference. The vast majority of Americans say “stay in line,” while those from the broader New York area often say “stay on line.”\n“For much of the last several decades … on line has been viewed as peculiar to New York City (and the Hudson Valley),” according to Merriam-Webster.\nThe difference is clearest on the Republican ticket.\nTrump, a native New Yorker, urged Republicans on Tuesday to, “Stay on Line. Do not let them move you. STAY ON LINE AND VOTE!” The presidential candidate has also used “in line.”\nHis running mate, Sen. JD Vance, a Republican who was born in Ohio, pressed people to, “Get in line, stay in line, and VOTE.”\nNetanyahu chooses US Election Day to fire rival Yoav Gallant\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long been rumored to be weighing the sacking of Gallant, the defense minister and his political rival. The two have clashed over Netanyahu’s handling of the multi-front war in Gaza and Lebanon.\nNetanyahu fired Gallant once before in March 2023, months before Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the current conflict. Biden administration officials expressed concern to Netanyahu over his decision at the time.\nThe move then was spurred by Gallant’s criticism of the Netanyahu government’s contentious plan to overhaul the judiciary. Netanyahu reversed the decision weeks later.\nThe White House on Tuesday had no immediate reaction to Netanyahu’s move to oust Gallant once again.\nPolice have arrested a man trying to enter the US Capitol with a torch and flare gun\nU.S. Capitol Police say the man was stopped Tuesday during a security screening at the Capitol Visitor Center. Authorities say he smelled of fuel and was carrying the flare gun and torch.\nOfficials have canceled public tours of the Capitol for the remainder of the day.\nPolice say they are still investigating.\nThe arrest comes as authorities are on heightened alert for security issues around the nation’s capital and have increased patrols in areas downtown and near the White House around Election Day.
