The 95th Academy Awards took place on Sunday night (March 12) Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.\nThe annual ceremony saw Michelle Yeoh make history as Everything Everywhere All At Once took home a clutch of major awards. The multiverse sci-fi epic, directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, claimed seven prizes including three acting gongs, best directing and best picture, the biggest of the night.\nYeoh claimed the Oscar for best leading actress, fending off competition from two-time Oscar winner Cate Blanchett to become the first woman from an Asian background to win the prize. Taking to the stage, she said: “For all the little boys and girls who look like me, this is a beacon of hope and possibilities.\n\"Dream big, dreams do come true. Ladies, never let anyone tell you you are past your prime.\" She added: \"This is history in the making.\" Yeoh’s co-star Jamie Lee Curtis, 64, won her first Oscar, for supporting actress, and paid tribute to all the special people in her life. The actress, who is the daughter of Hollywood stalwarts Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, added: \"And my mother and father were both nominated for Oscars in different categories, I just won an Oscar.\"\nThe Oscars were, of course, the hot topic of conversation on Monday morning's GMB and as Susanna Reid and Ed Balls appeared live in the London studio, North American correspondent Noel Phillips was out trying to grab the stars while also giving a run-down of the glitzy event.\nNoel told the hosts and viewers: \"The Oscars might have been a slightly quieter affair with no punches thrown, but it was still a historic night.\" He continued: \"It’s worth saying this year’s ceremony wasn't the most memorable or eventful, which will be a huge relief to the Academy, especially after the last 12 months they have had.\n\"Nonetheless it was an historic night. We saw Everything Everywhere All At Once winning seven of its 11 nominations. Here on the red carpet, one storyline which got a lot of guests talking about as they walked down this champagne-coloured carpet was the row between the BBC and Gary Lineker.\"\nIt comes after Match of the Day aired on Saturday night with no host or pundits after Gary 'stepped back' from his hosting role following an impartiality row with the BBC. The former footballer did not appear on the football highlights programme after he was told to stand down from the role when he compared language used to launch a new Government asylum seeker policy with 1930s Germany in a Tweet.\nFootball coverage on BBC TV and radio shows was hit across the weekend as fellow pundits, presenters and reporters – including Alan Shearer, Ian Wright and Alex Scott – walked out in \"solidarity\" with Gary. Match Of The Day aired for only 20 minutes on Saturday without accompanying commentary or analysis from presenters, with Sunday’s edition following a similar format and running for a reduced 15 minutes.\nCoverage of the Women’s Super League match between Chelsea and Manchester United aired without a pre-match presentation on Sunday, and Radio 5 Live replaced much of its usual live sports coverage over the weekend with pre-recorded content. The BBC announced on Monday that Lineker would return this weekend.\nWhile out on the Oscars beat for GMB, Noel spoke with Emily in Paris star Lucien about the impartiality row and he simply turned to the camera and said: \"F*** the Tories\" which was bleeped out in the ITV pre-recorded clip and appeared to spring a rude feature with his hand as it was blurred.\nNoel also spoke to music legend Niall Rogers about the row, as the Chic star said: \"If somehow caring about people offends somebody, you know what I say to that? It's not good for television.\"\nThe BBC has already issued an apology for the disturption caused to its sport programming over the weekend. In a statement, a BBC spokesperson said: \"The BBC will only be able to bring limited sport programming this weekend and our schedules will be updated to reflect that. We are sorry for these changes which we recognise will be disappointing for BBC sport fans. We are working hard to resolve the situation and hope to do so soon.\"\nREAD NEXT:\n- Dancing On Ice fans complain 'sort it out' as they point out the same issue with the final and the 'true winner'\n- ITV Dancing On Ice final in chaos as Phil and Holly forced to halt the show as other viewers baffled by filming 'blunder'\n- Dancing On Ice fans 'obsessed' as Holly Willoughby wears unexpected plunging ice dress for the final\n- Gemma Atkinson and daughter Mia cheer on Gorka Marquez on stage in Manchester after almost missing show\n- Kym Marsh told 'you look like sisters' with lookalike daughter as fans agree they're 'two of the most beautiful women in the UK'",
