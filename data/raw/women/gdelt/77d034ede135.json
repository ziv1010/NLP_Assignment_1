  "body_text": "“I think I’m behind,” Keira Walsh remembers, gazing at a picture of England lifting the European Championship trophy last summer. She has always operated best in the background. “Jill (Scott) can be centre stage — that’s fine. I’m still buzzing.”\nThe Lionesses’ triumph was the most significant moment in the history of women’s football in the United Kingdom. The image of the England team lifting the trophy is one that, it was hoped, would lead to a change in the way the game is viewed and treated. To an extent that has happened, helped by the players urging the government to increase access to sport in school for girls.\nGO DEEPER\nDid England’s Euro 2022 win leave a lasting legacy for grassroots football in the UK?\nMonday is the first anniversary of that day, with England currently in Australia for the World Cup, preparing for their final group-stage game against China. To mark that date, in recent months The Athletic has asked the Lionesses how that photo makes them feel.\nAdvertisement\nOnly 365 days on, Sarina Wiegman has a very different squad at her disposal. Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Fran Kirby are all injured. Ellen White and Scott have retired.\nWalsh, speaking in the spring, points to best friend Williamson.\n“Sad I would say,” she adds. “I think it’s been strange for me personally not having her here; it’s difficult. Obviously as captain as well she takes on a lot with conversations behind the scenes — she was very proactive at the Euros. I think at some point I’ll have to get over it and move on. I’m not sure I’m there yet!”\nThe pathos of this moment is that Walsh is there but also not really there now, having suffered a serious knee ligament injury against Denmark in England’s second game, damage that surely threatens her involvement in the rest of the tournament. She has won every honour in the game — except a World Cup. Now, England will likely have to do it without her.\n“I relish and hope we can give everyone a similar picture in a few months’ time,” says centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy.\nWalsh’s injury is just one reason why the coda to the Euros photo — the potential for its World Cup equivalent — could be similarly bittersweet.\n“There’s a lot of new faces now,” says Lucy Bronze, before pausing. “I guess it’s just another moment in all our careers — but probably one of the best moments to date!”\nGO DEEPER\nA narrative of prosperity has developed around women's football. Is it a mirage?\nBronze is England’s most experienced player with 106 caps. She knows the ebbs of squads, however successful, and her excitement is nuanced. For 23-year-old goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck, the excitement still appears overwhelming.\n“It’s not that it doesn’t feel real, because the impact has been massive — but living in that moment, it was such a crazy, crazy day that you’re like, ‘Did that really happen?’,” she says.\nBut though the result was heady, Roebuck knows what that feeling was built on. Think of the head-swimming elation after a marathon effort.\nAdvertisement\n“I think that captures a lot of hard work, to be honest with you,” she adds. “It was a long summer. I think that’s the moment everybody remembers. But for me, that was six weeks of just the team grafting, trying to keep focus. There were so many factors. To just come to that and then be able to achieve something that big was incredible.”\n“This photograph speaks to everything we went through to get to that point,” adds Wubben-Moy. “More so to focus on the rest of the stadium, like having blown the final whistle, the celebrations, how many people were still in that stadium.”\nRoebuck and Wubben-Moy did not start a single game that tournament — Wiegman named an unchanged XI throughout the competition. Defender Alex Greenwood was in the same position, though she has now ascended to a starting position in Australia, playing left-back against Haiti before moving inside against Denmark.\n“No one looks at that and goes, ‘Who didn’t play and who played?’,” says Greenwood. “The whole squad there was so important for us lifting that trophy. Whether you played no minutes, came off the bench or played every single minute of every game, it was a squad and team collective effort. It’s a photo I’ll smile at every time I look at it.”\nPart of that is down to Wiegman, who manages to ensure the edges of the squad feel just as integral as the core. Think back to the moment the final whistle blew in that final — and back-up striker Beth England sprinting into the arms of the Dutch coach.\n“I didn’t even realise at the time I had done it,” England remembers. “I think it was more just the elation, the relief of it — we’ve actually done it. I was so happy.\n“I think I just made a beeline for her and she was the first person I saw. I was so excited and I just embraced her, because it’s not just tough for the players, it’s tough for the manager making selections — who to play, who not to play. I just think she has got a way where everyone just wholeheartedly trusts and believes in her.”\nAdvertisement\nEngland says her memories of the night afterwards are foggy — before quickly qualifying that she is joking. For her, the most important thing is that these memories are reflected in tangible improvements to the women’s game — and that they don’t fade away with the summer.\n“That was a huge day,” she states. “Not just for us, but for women’s football, for women’s sport in England, and I think it has proven that in the last 12 months with how much everything has grown — the media coverage, helping the schools, getting girls into sport, grassroots, refereeing.\n“Everything now just has more investment and we are hopefully on a path where we are constantly building these blocks to make the sport better than when we first started out.”\nThe Athletic only spoke to one current England player who was not part of that squad — Brighton & Hove Albion winger Katie Robinson. In many ways, her progression over the past 12 months is proof of that group’s success.\n“I was watching it with my partner back in a local pub,” laughs the Cornwall-born 20-year-old, who could not get tickets for the final. It did not dampen how she felt.\n“A massive amount of joy. I think that picture shows how far the game has come for England and the FA. There’s immense pride.”\nIt is remarkable how quickly that photograph now feels sepia-toned. The squad’s turnover has been rapid and Wiegman is insistent the Euros must not affect the now, snapping at one reporter who asked her a question about that tournament: “That was the Euros, this is the World Cup. It doesn’t matter.”\nThat is not quite true, though. There have been lasting changes in the United Kingdom. Many of the players involved have changed and perhaps that success will never be repeated — but the Lionesses in this World Cup squad, plus some who aren’t, are still driven on by the events of July 31 last year and all that it took to get to that point.\n(Top photo: Getty Images)",
