Biden’s administration has also declared that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s scientific report about climate change “does not present sufficient cause” to halt a massive expansion of fossil fuel drilling.\n“It is deeply disheartening to see the Biden administration claim that Americans have ‘no constitutional right to a stable climate,’” Julia Olson, lead counsel for the Juliana plaintiffs, told the Lever. “When President Biden ran for office, he promised America’s youth that he would take bold action to combat climate change, but instead the United States is leading the world on producing fossil fuels, the very thing that is furthering climate change. Instead of fighting these young people at every turn, the US Department of Justice should let youth have their day in court.”\n-\nWhen PACs don't bulk buy the book you cooperated with and tried to hype.\nA much-hyped biography of the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson has struggled to find favour with readers, a leading US publishing authority said, listing just over 3,000 copies sold in the first week of its release.\nAccording to Publishers Weekly, Tucker by Chadwick Moore sold just 3,227 copies in its first week after publication on 1 August\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/15/tucker-carlson-biography-chadwick-moore\n-\nKurt Campbell, Deputy Assistant to President Biden and Co-ordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs, also Puppett Master of Joe, Yoon and Fumio, of the Order of Brilliant Star with Special Grand Cordon for services to Taiwan-United States relations.

It will see it as yet another attempt by the US to \"contain\" its influence, no matter how much the White House denies this.
