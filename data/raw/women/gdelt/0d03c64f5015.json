And yes, some of them are surefire choices, but others are definitely not.\nIn the end, it's always about time.

Bright, Gary Halvorson, Michael Lembeck, James Burrows, Gail Mancuso, Peter Bonerz, David Schwimmer, Robby Benson, Shelley Jensen, Terry Hughes, Dana De Vally Piazza, Alan Myerson, Pamela Fryman, Steve Zuckerman, Thomas Schlamme, Roger Christiansen, Sheldon Epps, Arlene Sanford, David Steinberg, Joe Regalbuto, Mary Kay Place, Paul Lazarus, Sam Simon, Todd Holland\n- Writers\n- Jeff Astrof, Mike Sikowitz, Brian Boyle, Patty Lin, Bill Lawrence, R. Lee Fleming Jr.\nCast\n-\nRachel Green\n-\nMonica Geller\nFriends is the popular sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, released back in 1994 and ran for ten seasons. The show follows a group of six twentysomethings through their lives in New York City and their time spent between their two apartments and their local coffee shop. The show features the group navigating tricky relationships with one another and comical misadventures.\n- Main Genre\n- Comedy\n- Seasons\n- 10\nThe adventures of six friends living in modern New York City were enough of a concept to give life to a sitcom that calling it a modern classic is an understatement. Friends is the ultimate TV show with enough seasons to make for a solid rewatch every couple of years, and although it hasn’t aged flawlessly, its fanb ase is one of the most faithful in TV history.\nA Modern TV Classic for Binging\n‘90s sitcoms were easy to watch. And even though Seinfeld may be an audience favorite from a critic’s perspective, Friends is simply easier to approach. Its stories are fresh and light and play like turn-off-your-brain fun most of the time. There’s a very low chance you haven’t watched Friends, but if you have, try using it as \"background,\" and you’ll see how much fun you end up having. You can start your holiday binge today.\n19 Luther (2010 - 2019)\nModern-day Sherlock Holmes John Luther, played by Idris Elba, uses his brilliant detective skills to solve murder cases with the unlikely help of murderer Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson). The BBC crime thriller aired for five seasons and continued with the 2023 feature film Luther: The Fallen Sun.\n- Seasons\n- 5\nThe thriller series starring Idris Elba, Luther, tells the story of John Luther, a London-based detective whose methods are anything but traditional. Luther gets into enough trouble to make you wonder how he’s still there, but after a couple of episodes, you’ll see the villains call for a workaround, and Luther actually gets punished at some point.\nOne of the British TV Thrillers in History\nThe seasons are short, and fortunately, the show never takes the direction of a repetitive procedural. It seems risky from a showrunner’s point of view, but every season saw him progress into a different man, clouded by his demons and suffering from the world he was forced to always face. The pilot is very, very good and will convince you to give the show a go with its ending. If police procedurals are your fix, this British gem will be your cup of tea.\n18 The Office (2005 - 2013)\nIn The Office, the employees of the paper-selling company Dunder Mifflin are the subject of a mockumentary in which their daily, mundane lives are documented. And not much else. They’re led by manager Michael Scott, a man so vile and disgusting that you won’t believe he can actually be so kind and innocent at some point. The Office was based on the show from the U.K. with the same name.\nYou Will Restart The Office as Soon as It Ends\nIt’s safe to say The Office is already part of pop culture. And if not, it’s on its way to become just that, given how many reruns are available in syndication all the time. You don’t even have to stream it, as regular old TV will take care of that. It’s also convenient that continuity is not really a thing in the show, so unless you want to learn by memory all the character arcs, you’re good to go to start with any episode.\n17 Sex and the City (1998 - 2004)\n- Release Date\n- 1998 - 2004-00-00\n- Network\n- HBO\n- Showrunner\n- Darren Star\nCast\n-\nSamantha Jones\n-\nCarrie Bradshaw\n-\nMiranda Hobbes\n-\nCharlotte York\n- Seasons\n- 6\nIn Sex and the City, Miranda, Carrie, Samantha, and Charlotte are four New Yorker women whose friendship is consolidated by how they perform in a sexually-obsessive society. The very funny dramatic comedy by HBO still feels all too relevant considering how restricted the world outside cable television is. Inside HBO, anything could be said, and this show proved it.\nHumor for Grownups that Goes By in a Flash\nIt was inevitable that sex would be talked about very openly on TV at some point. The positive thing about Sex and the City is that its treatment feels fresh, compelling, and smartly written to engage people in observing how present and important the sexual aspect of society is. You can start watching this one on any day, at any time, and the result will be the same: absolute comedy bliss by iconic TV characters.\n16 Mare of Easttown (2021)\n- Release Date\n- 2021 - 2021-00-00\n- Network\n- HBO\n- Showrunner\n- Brad Ingelsby\nCast\n-\nMarianne 'Mare' Sheehan\n-\nHelen Fahey\n-\nJulianne NicholsonLori Ross\n-\nAngourie RiceSiobhan Sheehan\n- Seasons\n- 1\nIn the HBO miniseries Mare of Easttown, a town is struck by a horrific murder involving a teenage mother. It takes Mare, the town’s detective, to the past, when she wasn’t able to solve an eerily similar case. But this isn’t Mare’s only problem. Her disconnection from her family dynamics is a huge burden to carry as well.\nFamily Drama and Crime Thriller, All in One\nKate Winslet is extraordinary in Mare of Easttown, and she should be reason enough to watch the show. But Mare of Easttown is also a great show to watch anytime because it isn’t exactly set within four walls of dread and darkness, like Nordic crime shows. This miniseries is curiously easy to watch, and it’s due to its very well-written character arcs that feel logical and quite honest. If you have a thing for miniseries, this is it.\n15 Prison Break (2005 - 2017)\n- Release Date\n- 2005 - 2017-00-00\n- Network\n- FOX\n- Showrunner\n- Paul Scheuring\n- Directors\n- Paul Scheuring\n- Writers\n- Paul Scheuring, Nick Santora\nCast\n-\nCurtis Lum\n- Seasons\n- 5\nIn Prison Break, Michael Scofield can’t do much to get his brother out of prison. He’s sure Lincoln is innocent and shouldn’t be there. So he puts himself to the test. He gets himself imprisoned and uses all his intelligence to break him and Lincoln out. The problems are too many, as they will face the wrath of other inmates who also want in on the deal.\nCare for Cliffhangers? This is What You're Looking For\nPrison Break was the show that presented audiences in the 2000s with a cliffhanger element. Similar ones like 24 and even Lost also made good use of this narrative tool, but Prison Break cleverly included it in just about every episode. If you’re in the middle of a selection panic, Prison Break will satisfy your craving for good genre TV that, fortunately, has commercial cuts. Otherwise, the tension would be too much to bear.\n14 The Afterparty (2022 - 2023)\nCreated (and sadly cancelled) by Apple TV+, The Afterparty is a quick comedy watch that centers around a murder that occurs after a party. To Detective Danner, everyone’s a suspect until proven otherwise, and they all have to remain inside the home where the crime scene is. The show is told using a Rashomon style of narration, in which every partygoer provides their own version of the events.\nMurder Mystery Comedy Done Right\nThe murder mystery show is very clever and provides laughs non-stop from the very beginning. Both seasons are led by Tiffany Haddish and Sam Richardson in stellar comedic performances that will impress every viewer who’s not familiar with their work. Given how effective and well-adapted the premise is, both seasons of The Afterparty are the quick watch you didn’t know you could count on.\n13 The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (2017 - 2023)\n- Release Date\n- 2017 - 2023-00-00\n- Network\n- Amazon Prime Video\n- Showrunner\n- Rachel Brosnahan\n- Directors\n- Rachel Brosnahan\nCast\n-\nCaroline Aaron\n- Seasons\n- 5\nPrime Video's The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel tells the story of Miriam \"Midge\" Maisel, a Jewish woman living in 1950s New York City. Midge's husband leaves her and their two kids, and she's forced to make ends meet by using any talent she has. Suddenly and unexpectedly, the mother of two discovers she has a natural ability for stand-up comedy, and she tries to do it against all odds.\nWitty and Clever Comedy that's Also Endearing\nContrary to what people expect from it, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel isn't formatted as a sitcom. No 20-minute episodes, and no single camera with a laugh track. This one looks like drama, but it's exactly the opposite. It's a light-hearted modern comedy led by a natural comedian who checks every item on the list to become a memorable performer. In the case of a feel-good show with relevant themes, you can't go wrong with the adventures of Midge.\n12 The Simpsons (1989 - Present)\n- Release Date\n- December 17, 1989\n- Network\n- FOX\n- Showrunner\n- Al Jean\n- Directors\n- Steven Dean Moore, Mark Kirkland, Rob Oliver, Michael Polcino, Mike B. Anderson, Chris Clements, Wes Archer, Timothy Bailey, Lance Kramer, Nancy Kruse, Matthew Faughnan, Chuck Sheetz, Rich Moore, Jeffrey Lynch, Pete Michels, Susie Dietter, Raymond S. Persi, Carlos Baeza, Dominic Polcino, Lauren MacMullan, Michael Marcantel, Neil Affleck, Swinton O. Scott III, Jennifer Moeller\n- Writers\n- J. Stewart Burns, Michael Price, Brian Kelley, Bill Odenkirk, Dan Vebber, Kevin Curran, Stephanie Gillis, Dan Castellaneta, Deb Lacusta, Billy Kimball, Jessica Conrad, Cesar Mazariegos, Daniel Chun, Jennifer Crittenden, Conan O'Brien, Valentina Garza, Elisabeth Kiernan Averick, Christine Nangle, Broti Gupta, Loni Steele Sosthand, Megan Amram, Bob Kushell, David Isaacs, David Mandel\nCast\n-\nDan CastellanetaHomer Simpson / Abe Simpson / Barney Gumble / Krusty (voice)\n-\nJulie KavnerMarge Simpson / Patty Bouvier / Selma Bouvier (voice)\n- Main Genre\n- Animation\n- Seasons\n- 37\nThe television classic The Simpsons is the longest-running show on the list, and there is a reason. The animated sitcom created by Matt Groening in the late '80s tells the story of a family in Springfield dealing with just about every issue the dumb husband and father can come up with. So far, it's the most important piece of animation in television history.\nThe Classic Animated TV Show for the Whole Family\nIt's hard to find a show that's currently so embedded in pop culture. The Simpsons makes for a great watch to distract you from anything that may be going on because of its usual structure of the family overcoming every problem they get into. It's also great to play in the background while you do something else, but Homer's extremely idiotic shenanigans are incredibly magnetic and distracting. Don't say we didn't warn you.\n11 Rick and Morty (2013 - Present)\n- Release Date\n- December 2, 2013\n- Network\n- Adult Swim\n- Showrunner\n- Dan Harmon\n- Directors\n- Bryan Newton, Dominic Polcino, Anthony Chun, John Rice, Stephen Sandoval, Jeff Myers\n- Writers\n- Tom Kauffman, Wade Randolph, Eric Acosta, David Phillips, Erica Rosbe, Sarah Carbiener, Matt Roller, Michael Waldron, Caitie Delaney\nCast\n-\nSpencer GrammerSummer Smith (voice)\n-\nJustin RoilandRick Sanchez / Morty Smith\n- Main Genre\n- Animation\n- Seasons\n- 8\nWhile we're in the animated world, let's continue with Rick and Morty, the modern animated TV show for adults that tells the story of Rick Sanchez, a mischievous scientist who gets into all sorts of trouble alongside his more naive grandson Morty. When we mention \"trouble,\" we're probably understating what the scientist and his inventions can do. From traveling to other dimensions for his own benefit to altering the course of history because he's just too drunk to make things right.\nA Very Creative Journey Without Limits\nThe very popular Rick and Morty is especially appealing to sci-fi and '80s fans because of how excessive it is when winking at pop culture. It's the reason for its existence, and the extremely absurd storylines become secondary as the show progresses. It has only a handful of seasons, so you will probably finish it quickly, although you might want to take your time with it.",
