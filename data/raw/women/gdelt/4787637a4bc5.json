Obviously we'd love to beat them this time around.\n\"We've had to go about it the hard way again just to make the grand final but now that we're here, we're looking to make the most of the opportunity.\n\"It's still early in the week but we will get more excited closer to the game and come up with a game plan to hopefully get us over the line.\"\nGrand finals were nothing new for his Gerringong counterpart Scott Stewart, who was looking to guide the Lions to a third premiership in their fourth-straight decider.\nStewart was banking on his team's big-game experience to come to the fore on Sunday.\n'I think [our big-game experience] will help us,\" he said.\n\"Those guys have stood up, we've got a few blokes that have been there numerous times and know what's required to win those big games.\n\"We've also got a lot of guys who will be playing their first [grand final]. I think we've got eight different players from last year's grand final, which is a big turnover.\n\"We lost a lot of blokes early in the year to season-ending injuries, which gave these younger guys the opportunity to play all year and early on.\n\"They're probably learning a little bit about it, but now they're all on board.\n\"As such we'll definitely be relying on those experienced guys, but there's also a lot of guys going in for their first one as well, which is a good thing because they bring enthusiasm, which is always important.\"\nFierce rivals:\nTo add to the drama, Shellharbour and Gerringong will also play each other in the reserve-grade grand final on Sunday.\nStewart wasn't surprised to see the two fierce rivals battling each other in both the first and reserve-grade deciders.\n\"This history between the two clubs goes back a long way,\" he said.\n\"If you go back to the seventies, back when Ron Costello and Michael Cronin and those were playing, they used to meet each other in grand finals all the time.\n\"So it's probably a little bit similar to that.\n\"We respect them. They got the club championship this year and we missed out on it by just a couple of points. So it's certainly a rivalry across all grades there between the two clubs.\"\nThis view was shared by Atallah, who said it was a big day for both teams and their fans.\nKeys to victory:\nMoments defined last year's thrilling 12-10 victory for Gerringong in the decider played in summer-like conditions where the temperature reached over 30 degrees.\nIt's expected to be much cooler this Sunday but both coaches expect a similarly hot and tight encounter in this year's showpiece.\nStewart said for Gerringong to win back-to-back titles the Lions would have to play as good, if not better than they did when they beat the Sharks in the penultimate round of the 2024 season.\n\"I think that day we played probably our best football of the year and we're gonna have to do that again on grand final day,\" he said.\n\"If we're anything under what we played against them, which was easily our best performance of the year, well we're gonna be in trouble, so we've got to reproduce that same effort. If we do, I think we can get them.\n\"But if we're a bit below that, I'm sure we're really gonna be up against it because they'll be desperate not to feel the same pain they did in last year's grand final.\n\"They will come out fired up to beat us.\n\"We're not doubting that, but we're defending our premiership as well, so we've got that motivation.\n\"We've got young guys coming in who haven't won one before also and I just know how competitive our group is and they'll certainly be ready to go.\"\nAtallah said his players would also be ready to deliver on the big stage and hopefully end the club's six-year wait for a first-grade premiership.\n\"Defence has been our hallmark all year and it will be again on Sunday,\" he said.\n\"But in saying that there's not too much difference in points scored against both of us. Both teams are heavily focused on defence.\n\"Gerringong have got a lot of attacking weapons across the park as well so we're gonna need to be defensively really good again.\n\"But more than that when opportunities do arise, we're gonna have to ice our moments as well.\"\nThe first-grade grand final starts at 3pm.\nGrand final day at Centenary Field starts with the under 18s decider between Albion Park Oak Flats Eagles and Warilla Lake South Gorillas from 10am.\nThis game will be followed by the open women's tackle grand final between Milton Ulladulla Bulldogs and the Shellharbour Sharks from 11.45am before the reserve-grade decider between Shellharbour Sharks and Gerringong Lions kicks-off at 1.15pm.",
