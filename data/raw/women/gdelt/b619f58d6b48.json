  "body_text": "Super Falcons coach Justin Madugu has cleared the air on the exclusion of BAY FC forward, Asisat Oshoala, from the list of players that will prosecute Saturday’s international friendly against France in Angers, tagging the player as priceless to the national team.\nThe Nigeria Football Federation on Sunday released a 20-player list for the high-profile friendly but the 30-year-old was conspicuously missing from the squad which has 15 foreign pros and five home-based players.\nIn the wake of the queries by fans which were aired by PUNCH Sports Extra, Madugu has said the player’s absence was simply due to logistics.\n“Asisat Oshoala remains an integral part of the Super Falcons and an invaluable player in our squad,” the coach said via ESPN.\n“Her absence is purely due to logistical reasons and not a reflection of her talent or importance to the team.\n“Unfortunately, her (USA) visa and work permit expired and she is in the process of renewing them. Until these are finalised, she is unable to join us for the friendly in France.\n“Asisat’s contribution to the team is immense and we look forward to welcoming her back once her situation is sorted.”\nOshoala teamed up with Bay FC at the start of the just concluded National Women’s Soccer League, helping the expansion side to the NWSL playoffs where they were stopped by the Washington Spirit.\nThe striker who had previously excelled in Europe and Asia had a debut season to remember in the USA, setting four records for her club.\nOshoala’s official debut was remarkable, scoring the club’s first NWSL goal in their 1-0 win over Angel City FC at BMO Stadium, Los Angeles, California, on March 18. Incidentally, the 17th-minute effort was the club’s first away goal in the league.\nShe also scored the club’s first goal in their NWSL play-off’s 2-1 extra-time defeat to Washington Spirit at Audi Field, Washington, District of Columbia earlier this month.\nThe striker is a record six-time winner of the CAF Women’s Player of The Year award.",
