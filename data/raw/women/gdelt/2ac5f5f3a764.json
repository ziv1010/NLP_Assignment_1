We are not going to get into the situation where there is any room for anyone to seek to avoid responsibility by saying, 'It was their fault.'\n'So we pursue Harrods, and we focused on Harrods at this stage, because of the collective corporate responsibility and vicarious liability that these acts and the evidence we have come across shows clearly.'\nArmstrong added: 'I hold out a challenge to Harrods that if Harrods are going to seek to say to us these claims should be barred on the basis of limitation, then they are effectively adopting the argument that threats will always win the day.\n'We will not accept that argument and we are pretty confident the courts won't either.'\nHarrods said in a statement: 'We are utterly appalled by the allegations of abuse perpetrated by Mohamed Al Fayed. These were the actions of an individual who was intent on abusing his power wherever he operated and we condemn them in the strongest terms.\n'We also acknowledge that during this time as a business we failed our employees who were his victims and for this we sincerely apologise.\n'The Harrods of today is a very different organisation to the one owned and controlled by Al Fayed between 1985 and 2010, it is one that seeks to put the welfare of our employees at the heart of everything we do.'\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Woman kills two while speeding just weeks after driving test\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein",
