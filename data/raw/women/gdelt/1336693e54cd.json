Specifically, study authors found that for hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia who had experienced C. diff infections in the prior year, the use of doxycycline, instead of the more commonly used azithromycin, reduced the development of new C. diff infections by 45%. More than a third of patients who suffer a C. diff infection will go on to have another in the future. For patients who are admitted to a hospital with pneumonia, clinical guidelines typically recommend the... -\nFBI = Following Biden's Instructions?\nDoes “FBI” now stand for “Following Biden’s Instructions”? The FBI is doing backflips to boost Joe Biden’s re-election campaign. Unfortunately, federal courts don’t recognize law enforcement shenanigans as a violation of the Voting Rights Act.The FBI is categorizing Donald Trump’s supporters as terrorist suspects, according to a new report in Newsweek. The FBI created “a new category of extremists that it seeks to track and counter: Donald Trump’s army of MAGA followers,” Newsweek revealed. The FBI is relying on the same counterterrorism methods honed to fight al Qaeda to go after the incumbent president’s political opponents.Naturally, the latest Washington crusade... -\nAmerica's Immigration Daydream Is Coming To An End: The country is Balkanizing, and politics have become radical and violent...\nThe Atlantic, one of the most prestigious and reliably liberal publications in America, has a new article semi-frankly acknowledging the downsides of the last half century of unrestricted immigration.Author David Leonhardt, a regular columnist for the New York Times, confronts – or rather, politely circumambulates – the “unintended” consequences of the landmark 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which fundamentally remade America’s immigration process by opening the floodgates to the Third World.Leonhardt focuses chiefly on the economic impact of mass immigration on working class wages and rising inequality between the poor and the middle class. There is nothing groundbreaking here, as... -\nElection Group Slapped With RICO Says It Can Prove Trump Won Georgia In 2020\nFormer Black Voices for Trump leader Harrison Floyd’s legal team intends to prove his innocence of claims he unlawfully participated in an election subversion plot in Fulton County, Georgia, by showing that former President Donald Trump won the state’s 2020 presidential election.Harrison Floyd, as seen in an undated mugshot, is the only one of the 19 Fulton County defendants to be held in jail without bond. (Fulton County Sheriff's Department)Mr. Floyd was charged on Aug. 14 alongside the 45th president and 17 other co-defendants with violating Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, conspiracy to commit solicitation of false... -\nNutraceutical acne treatment meta-analysis suggests better nutraceutical acne treatment studies are required\nA meta-analysis has found a possible role for nutraceutical supplements in treating acne, one that will require better research practices to reveal their effectiveness. In a paper, the team reviews 42 articles encompassing various nutraceutical effects on acne. The collective meta-analysis included 3,346 participants across diverse methods and treatments tested. Zinc was the most studied nutraceutical, with approximately half of the studies showing efficacy, especially at higher doses. Zinc also had the highest rate of adverse effects, primarily gastrointestinal. Vitamins A and B5 showed some effectiveness. The vitamin dosages in the studies analyzed were often well above daily recommended use,... -\nAnti-Israel protesters vandalize White House gates, try to scale fence\nOne of the organizers of the protest published a post about event with the text \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!\"Pro-Palestinian protesters vandalized the gates of the White House with red paint and attempted to scale the fence around the president's residence early Sunday morning, according to footage shared from the scene. -\nHamas Cries Uncle, Makes Desperate Hostage Offer: Proposes release of all hostages in exchange for just a five-day pause in hostilities.\nHow do you know Hamas is on the ropes as Israeli forces continue to encircle Northern Gaza? Because they are making offers like this. According to a new report, the terrorist government has offered to release all the civilian hostages it took on October 7th in exchange for just a five-day pause in hostilities. Although the terms have varied in recent weeks, Hamas has indicated most recently that it would release all civilian hostages in exchange for a five-day pause, according to diplomats familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive matter. Israeli military... -\nAnti-Israel Protesters Storm Port of Oakland and US Ready Reserve Ship to Stop Weapons to Israel\nWe've seen a lot of anti-Israel protesters. We saw some who stormed a New York City store because it had flyers of the kidnapped Israelis out front, and police had to protect the building and the people. But the folks who stormed into the Port of Oakland managed to do something that everyone should find more than a little troubling. Somehow they were able to get through a fence and onto the grounds of the port area. At least three of them got onto the ladder for the U.S. Ready Reserve Force roll-on/roll-off vessel MV Cape Orlando, thinking it was... -\nEMP Weapons: How China Will Punch Out Our Lights\nOn 6 July China’s dictator-for-life, Xi Jinping, ordered his military to “deepen war and combat planning.” At the same time, the Biden administration (and most of Congress) will not recognize that the CCP has already declared war on them and the rest of America. As a result, our international and domestic defenses are vulnerable in many vital areas.To match Xi Jinping’s preparations for war we must accelerate rebuilding our navy with more ships and submarines, we must create a real ICBM defense, we must stop thousands of Chinese illegals now flooding across our borders, and we must round up those... -\nDemocrats, Squad Drawing Primary Challengers Over Hamas Support\nThe war in Gaza and the resultant pro-Hamas protests spreading across America are already having an impact on next year’s elections. Most members of Congress have admirably stood up for Israel and its right to defend itself, but not all of them. Among the loudest and proudest of the pro-Hamas caucus has been “squad” member Cori Bush of Missouri. She has been presumed to be in a safe seat, but now a leading Democratic Senate candidate in her state has dropped out of that race and announced a primary bid against Bush. And Democrats in other states are already being... -\n2005: Hastings Arthur Wise, workplace shooter\nOn this date in 2005, Hastings Arthur Wise was executed in South Carolina for a shooting rampage at his workplace. Or rather — and this was the problem — his former workplace. Canned from his machine-operator job of four years at the Aiken County R.E. Phelon engine manufacturing plant that July, Wise warned that he’d be back. On September 15, 1997, he turned up packing a 9 mm pistol and exacted his revenge — just another of America’s endless cavalcade of mass shootings. He shot a guard to get into the plant. The guard survived, but four others were not... -\nBrawl Breaks Out Between Attendees at Seaside High School Football Game, Police Say\nSeaside High School is quelling rumors that came out after an incident requiring law intervention broke out at the Battle of the Bay football game between Monterey and Seaside High Schools Friday night. Seaside High School Principal Aaron Sanders sent a letter out to families that said the incident was between adult attendees. This required additional officers to arrive to prevent any physical violence. \"You may have heard misinformation about a stabbing or a gunshots, but there were no reports of injury by a weapon,\" said Principal Sanders. Seaside Police Chief Nick Borges said a \"significant brawl\" broke out at... -\nU.S., European officials broach topic of peace negotiations with Ukraine, sources say\nWASHINGTON — U.S. and European officials have begun quietly talking to the Ukrainian government about what possible peace negotiations with Russia might entail to end the war, according to one current senior U.S. official and one former senior U.S. official familiar with the discussions. The conversations have included very broad outlines of what Ukraine might need to give up to reach a deal, the officials said. Some of the talks, which officials described as delicate, took place last month during a meeting of representatives from more than 50 nations supporting Ukraine, including NATO members, known as the Ukraine Defense Contact... -\nJanitor at New Jersey elementary school is arrested after 'lacing canteen food with bleach, urine and FECES - and posting lewd acts with inanimate objects on social media while working' - as children have reported diarrhea and vomiting\nA janitor at a New Jersey elementary school has been arrested over accusations he laced the food in the canteen with bleach, urine, saliva and feces. Giovanni Impellizzeri, 25, has been charged with child endangerment, aggravated assault and tampering with the food at Elizabeth Moore School in the Upper Deerfield School District. School authorities contacted the police on Monday after receiving a tip about posts on social media in which Impellizzeri was allegedly performing sex acts with 'inanimate objects' in the building. Investigators claim he contaminated the food and utensils in the school cafeteria with bodily fluids which included urine,... -\nRepublican Speaker Mike Johnson on Migration: ‘We’re Going to Force the Issue’\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson is promising to push the House’s H.R. 2 immigration stabilization bill to protect Americans’ right to a secure border, amid open-borders advocacy at the White House and the Senate. The promise was made as the GOP and Democrats draft rival end-of-year spending bills for government migration agencies, for aid to embattled Israel, and for continued war against Russian forces along the Ukraine-Russian border. Democrats “opened up the border under [border chief Alejandro] Mayorkas’s direction and President Biden himself,” Johnson told Fox Business, adding: They allowed for this serious situation that we have, and now, the... -\nPhoenix finally clears giant 15-block encampment of up to 2,000 homeless people known as 'The Zone' ahead of today's court deadline\nThe city of Phoenix has cleared out its largest homeless encampment and displaced thousands of people after a court ruling declared the camp a 'public nuisance'. City officials successfully finished their clean-up of 'The Zone,' a 15-block homeless encampment near downtown, at the cost of $20 million and moved nearly 2,000 people out of the area. The sweep comes after a judge imposed a November 4 deadline to remove tents, trash and makeshift structures and told the city to find alternative housing for people experiencing homelessness. Some of the people who were displaced had lived in the area for years... -\nPro-Palestinian protesters seen shaking White House gate vandalized with red paint: 'F-- Joe Biden'\nA White House fence was vandalized Saturday night with red paint as pro-Palestinian protesters shook the gate to one entrance to the executive mansion as some chanted \"F--k Joe Biden,\" the New York Post reported. The demonstrators also covered the General Marquis de Lafayette Statue in nearby Lafayette Park with graffiti and Palestinian flags, according to social media posts. The protesters were rallying against the Biden administration's support of Israel in the war against Hamas. Some outside the White House were heard chanting \"F--k Joe Biden.\" Demonstrators also canted \"Free, free Palestine!\" and \"Cease-fire now!\" The U.S. Secret Service said... -\nMALE FIELD HOCKEY PLAYER SEVERELY INJURES HIGH SCHOOL FEMALE PLAYER: ‘LISTEN TO THE SCREAMS’\nA male high school field hockey player severely injured a female athlete during a recent game in Massachusetts, prompting outcry from women’s sports advocates. Video of the incident was posted to social media, showing, from a distance, one player launching a shot that hit the female player in the face. Teammates and other players can be seen reacting to the shot, which reportedly knocked out several of the female player’s teeth. The female victim can be heard screaming in train after getting hit. The ICONS X account, representing an organization dedicated to protecting women’s sports, posted the video and tagged... -\nWhite House cartoon-in-chief, Kamala Harris, wages war on hate: We hate hate!\nIsrael’s got their Hamas. Ignorant college kids have their anti-semitic pro-Palestinian mantras. Rashida Tlaib and Omar Ilhan have their anti-Jewish ethnic cleansing causes. But the White House? For this White House, the war’s on hate. And President Joe Biden has set his trusty-wusty VP Kamala Harris as commander-in-chief of this war. -\nLee Harvey Oswald’s Two Wallets #shorts\nLee Harvey Oswald’s Two Wallets #shorts https://youtube.com/shorts/2w5u8IMBJJg?si=bURUXfZ5RAeLPzdS\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected!
