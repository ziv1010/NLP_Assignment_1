  "body_text": "Ahead of Sunday’s Adobe Women’s FA Cup Final between Chelsea and Manchester United, Mitre has unveiled the official match ball - the Ultimax Pro Adobe Women’s FA Cup 2024-25 Final Ball.\nThe teams meet at Wembley Stadium connected by EE on Sunday 18 May (1.30pm BST), and will face off with a ball worthy of such a historic occasion as the new creation combines cutting-edge performance technology with a design that honours the rich heritage of the competition.\nIts striking, yet minimalist off-white design, has gold and silver detailing and subtle design touches emphasise the prominence of the Adobe Women’s FA Cup trophy and its proud history in the game.\nWith the trophy emblem in gold, prominently featured on each intricately designed Delta chevron, the addition of the date and location of the Final marks its place in footballing history.\nDrawing inspiration from the 1971 Mitre Challenge Trophy ball - the first-ever Women’s FA Cup Final - this match ball is a tribute to Mitre’s long-standing legacy in supporting women’s football at every level.\nIn 1971, the ‘Mitre Challenge Trophy’ ball graced the pitch at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. Now, 54 years later, the Ultimax Pro will take its place on the hallowed Wembley Stadium turf in front of a bumper crowd as two teams compete for glory in the Adobe Women’s FA Cup Final.\nEngineered with performance at its core and built from decades of knowledge in the game, it features a unique four-panel design, reducing seams to create a larger sweet spot. This innovation ensures maximum power, improved control and a better connection with every strike. The ball is FIFA Quality Pro certified, guaranteeing its elite level of performance.\nThe ball is thermally bonded with HyperSeal, ensuring superb shape retention, durability, and zero water absorption. Its Hyperflow debossed grooves have been specifically designed for inflight stability, ensuring consistency across all speeds of play. Inside, the Hyperfoam elastic cushioning offers optimal power, close control, and a responsive touch.\nSimon Rowe, senior vice president of Mitre and global sports marketing at Pentland Brands said: “This special Final deserves a ball that is just as exceptional, and we believe the Ultimax Pro is a thing of beauty.\n“Mitre’s commitment to the women’s game remains as strong as ever, and with the Ultimax Pro, we’re proud to support the next chapter in the Adobe Women’s FA Cup’s rich legacy.”\nMitre will also be launching a supporters’ training level replica ball, to commemorate the Final and release of the Ultimax Pro ball – so all football fans can play like their heroes.\nThe Ultimax Pro Adobe Women’s FA Cup and replica balls are available to buy from mitre.com now.",
