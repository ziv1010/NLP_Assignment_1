The original version was published on Monday, October 10.\nAfter initial testing at the start of the fall semester, the presence of lead in some water fixtures at UNC has led the university to conduct widespread assessment of its water quality. Three water fountains in the historic Wilson Library initially returned tests with noticeable levels of the chemical in late August, prompting UNC to shut down the fixtures and begin testing similar ones across campus. Since then, several other fountains and sinks at the university have similarly returned test with lead detection.\nWhat Does It Mean?\nLead in drinking water is typically attributed to three sources: lead pipes, lead solder and lead brass fittings. If plumbing materials are corroded, lead can enter the water near the exit from the fixture, although this does not impact other pipes in a building. Blake Hodge, the communications specialist the Orange Water and Sewer Authority (OWASA), said the issue is localized to the various fixtures on campus and the broader region’s water quality is not at risk. While OWASA is supporting the university in their sampling efforts, he said sampling of water leaving the Jones Ferry Road treatment plant and in homes around the service area is coming back clear of lead. “We certainly understand that seeing these repeated results can be concerning for the community,” said Hodge, “so we want to assure everybody that the water we are providing is meeting all state and federal regulations.” Hodge said lead often enters the water not from its distribution source, but from plumbing materials in fixtures or infrastructure, like pipes, lead solder and lead brass fittings. Whenever water sits in a fixture or pipe for an extended period of time, he said there is a chance the chemical will leech from the item into the water. While it takes a significant amount of lead to be ingested to cause health problems, the Environmental Protection Agency states there is no safe exposure to the toxic metal in water and exposure can cause health problems. The Centers for Disease Control also have a group of people considered “high risk” for falling ill due to lead exposure. UNC says that anyone in the “high risk” category, as well as people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or work in the affected buildings, may want to consider being tested for the lead levels in their blood. After initially prioritizing those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, the university now has health tests for lead available to all faculty, staff and students who have used the affected buildings. Faculty and staff who are seeking testing should contact the University Employee Occupational Health Clinic, while students and post-doctoral fellows should call Campus Health. Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz told Chapelboro on September 29 that while the addressing of these infrastructure and water quality issues is going to be a long and “evolving process,” he assured the campus community that “we’ve got the best people working on it.” “There’s a lot of work that’s been done over the past few weeks,” said Guskiewicz. “We’re pleased that those individuals who have been tested, there’s been no detectable levels found [in them] and we continue to test the actual drinking fountains and water in these buildings.”\nWhat Testing Phase is UNC Currently On?\nThe Environment, Health and Safety division’s lead testing across campus is being conducted in phases, according to UNC. Phase One, which consisted of checking water fixtures that potentially had lead components due to their age and construction, is reportedly complete. UNC said Phase Two is the review and testing of water fixtures in buildings built during or before 1930. The final phase will be testing water fixtures in buildings built in or prior to 1990. UNC Environment, Health and Safety said it completed Phase Two of testing on Friday, October 28. Work on Phase Three is in progress.\nSites With Reported Lead\nAs part of its response, UNC’s department of Environment, Health and Safety established a web page tracking the lead contamination alerts shared to the campus community. The drinking fountains listed at the buildings have been taken out of service while the university works to improve the quality. UNC said sinks with detectable levels of lead will not be shut off for washing hands, but will have signage around them urging people to not drink from the sink.\nBelow is a comprehensive list of which UNC buildings the university says have returned tests with detectable lead, with the specific fixture that failed the test and the date an alert was publicly shared.\nKENAN FOOTBALL CENTER\n- Seafood sink near Room 234, break room sink near Room 429, two drinking fountains near Room 523 (March 24)\n—————–\nLOUDERMILK CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE\n- Drinking fountain near Room 3213A, kitchen sink near Room 3117 (March 20)\nCHASE DINING HALL\n- Kitchen sink near Room D105A (March 20)\n—————–\n1600 BAITY HILL (Graduate and Family Housing)\n- Kitchen sink in Room 314 (February 27)\n—————–\nMEDICAL BIOMOLECULAR RESEARCH BUILDING\n- Sink in Room 2301, breakroom sink in Room 6202 (February 17)\nNC AREA HEALTH EDUCATION CENTER\n- Breakroom sink in Room 308, breakroom sink in Room 409 (February 17)\n—————–\nANDERSON STADIUM\n- Breakroom sink near Room 105 (February 14)\n—————–\nNEUROSCIENCES RESEARCH BUILDING\n- Breakroom sink near Room 2121, drinking fountain near Room 5103 (February 9)\n—————–\nMARSICO HALL\n- Drinking fountain near Room SB026, breakroom sink in Room B245, drinking fountain in Room 2121, drinking fountain in Room 6222, breakroom sink in Room 6222, breakroom sink in Room 7003, drinking fountain near Room 7006 (February 1)\nKOURY ORAL HEALTH SCIENCES BUILDING\n- Two drinking fountains near Room B416E (February 1)\n—————–\nMcCASKILL SOCCER CENTER\n- Breakroom sink near Room 216 (January 30)\nGENETIC MEDICINE RESEARCH BUILDING\n- Two drinking fountains near Room 3040, drinking fountain near Room 3088, drinking fountain near Room 5040 (January 30)\n—————–\nALLEN EDUCATION CENTER\n- Breakroom sink in Room C110 (January 26)\nHOMESTEAD OPERATIONS CENTER\n- Two drinking fountains in hallway, drinking fountain near Room 1000A-B (January 26)\n—————–\nCAUDILL LABS\n- Drinking fountain near Room 340 (January 19)\nCHAPMAN HALL\n- Breakroom sink in Room 118 (January 19)\nFIELD HOCKEY PRESS BOX in KAREN SHELTON STADIUM\n- Water dispenser near Room F201 (January 19)\nSTUDENT and ACADEMIC SERVICES BUILDING (SASB) NORTH\n- Drinking fountain near Room 1129 (January 19)\n—————–\nMcCOLL BUILDING\n- Breakroom sink in Room 2406, drinking fountain near Room 5200 (January 17)\nITS MANNING\n- Breakroom sink in Room 1106, breakroom sink in Room 2200, breakroom sink in Room 5001 (January 17)\nMEADOWMONT STABLE at 130 DUBOSE HOME LANE\n- Breakroom sink in Room 101 (January 17)\n—————–\nTAYLOR RESIDENCE HALL\n- Kitchen sink in Room 4202, kitchen sink in Room 4505 (January 5)\n—————–\nHILL ALUMNI CENTER\n- Two kitchen sinks in Room 118, kitchen sink in Room 140, breakroom sink in Room 149, kitchen sink in Room 223, drinking fountain near Room 333 (January 4)\nLOUDERMILK HALL\n- Kitchen sink in Room 23 (January 4)\nCAMPUS Y\n- Kitchen sink in Blue Ram Café Room 001A (January 4)\n—————–\nDUBOSE HOME PLACE\n- Kitchen sink in Room 106 (January 3)\nKENAN CENTER\n- Two kitchen sinks in Room 115, kitchen sink near Room 116, drinking fountain near Room 116, kitchen sink in Room 130, breakroom sink in Room 210, two drinking fountains in Room 221, breakroom sink in Room 318, drinking fountain near Room 318, breakroom sink in Room 409, breakroom sink in Room 527, breakroom sink in Room 535 (January 3)\n203 BRANSON STREET\n- Kitchen sink in Room C (January 3)\n—————–\nBOSHAMER STADIUM\n- Drinking fountain near Room 1007, breakroom sink in Room 3004, breakroom sink in Room 3006, breakroom sink in Room 3007, breakroom sink in Room 3008 (December 13)\nBOSHAMER STADIUM CONCESSSION STAND\n- Kitchen sink (December 13)\nEDDIE SMITH FIELD HOUSE\n- Sink near Room 110 (December 13)\nCOGENERATION FACILITY\n- Drinking fountain near men’s restroom, drinking fountain by stairs below trash can (December 13)\n- COGENERATION BOILER 8: Ice maker (December 13)\n- GORE BUILDING at 575 W.
