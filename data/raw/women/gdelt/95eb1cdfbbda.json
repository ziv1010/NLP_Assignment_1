They haven’t contacted me, and we are the largest statewide organization.”\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker took over this month as the NCAA’s sixth full-time president — and the first to come from the world of politics rather than higher education.\nHe set a tone for compromise when asked during an interview with The Associated Press about the NCAA’s stance on transgender athletes, who’ve been at the center of a heated debate since Lia Thomas, who had transitioned from male to female while at Ivy League Penn, won a national title in women’s swimming last year.\n“I think our championships need to reflect the fact that we’re in all 50 states, but the people who actually host those championships need to make sure that every kid who participates in them gets the kind of positive experience out of it that they should get,” Baker told the AP.\nSankey senses that someone such as Baker assuming the role as president “is probably a good opportunity for the NCAA to evaluate how it uses its leadership position in an effective way while also making sure it focuses on its core function, which is supporting high-level competition and educating young people.”\nJon Steinbrecher, who has been commissioner of the Mid-American Conference since 2009, noted how difficult it is to match political sentiments with expanding and ever-changing conference alignments,\n“I’ve got a league of 12 public institutions from five different states and they’ve got different viewpoints across the board and different majorities across those states,” he said. “You have to pick your battles. If you want to stand up for something, then make sure it’s a broad enough issue that it’s worth the fight.”\nGood luck finding an issue that has broad support across political and cultural lines in today’s divided America.\nBesides, the NCAA finds itself largely consumed with issues such as Name, Image and Likeness and the transfer portal, which have quickly revolutionized the way the college game is played.\nAdding to the complexity of NIL are states considering their own laws governing the benefits an athlete can receive through endorsement deals or even outright payments.\n“With name, image and likeness, which isn’t a moral issue, but this state does this and that state does that, which makes it a challenge,” Steinbrecher said.\nParrot is wondering whether college athletes will be willing to take their newfound clout into the political arena.\n“If they’re saying that student athletes have the right to choose where they go to school, how they earn NIL money, how they use the transfer portal,” she said, “what happens when they choose to hold events in locations that don’t allow, let’s say, women making a decision about the autonomy of their own bodies?”\nParrot pointed to a recent survey that showed 25% of students had ruled out an institution based on the laws and policies of the state where it was located.\nOf course, she quickly noted, college athletes likely have far different priorities than the student body as a whole. For top-level recruits in sports such as football and basketball, signing with a school that enhances their chances of getting to the pros is sure to remain the top priority.\n“If there’s an issue that as a team we want to stand up for, then we’ll do it,” said UConn freshman Alex Karaban, whose team is headed to the men’s Final Four. “But as of now, we’re focused on the basketball side of it.”\nThere also could be a difference between the attitudes of male and female athletes, especially regarding abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade.\n“It’s going to be interesting to see if any of this influences where student athletes enroll,” Parrot said, “and where they don’t.”\n___\nPaul Newberry is a national sports writer for The Associated Press.
