  "body_text": "By the time Alexei Navalny came to New Haven in 2010, he had already earned a law degree and was actively fighting against authoritarianism and corruption among Russian oligarchs.\nHe arrived on campus as a Yale World Fellow, part of an impressive class of activists who were similarly dedicated to changing the world by empowering women in India, by bringing equality from Sudan, by working to address climate change everywhere — and, in his case, by bringing democracy to Russia. In the storied halls, Mr. Navalny reveled in daily discussions, and experienced first-hand what an American liberal arts education can do, said Edward “Ted” Wittenstein, executive director of Yale’s International Security Studies and a lecturer in global affairs, who was also in the 2010 class.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nYale changed Mr. Navalny. At the end of the program, he left “determined to undertake a far more ambitious project at great personal risk: to investigate, expose, and organize worldwide opposition to the criminally repressive Putin regime,” Wittenstein said.\nNot for the first time, he returned to Russia carrying a message that appealed to people old enough to remember glasnost, and young enough to believe that Russia could change.\nThe Russian government quickly pushed back, and he was jailed after a December 2011 protest against the party of the then-president, Dmitry Medvedev. Among his other supporters, 2010’s fellows reached out to Russian embassies around the world seeking his release, which came after 15 days.\nTake control of your search results\nThe imprisonments, harassment, and assaults never stopped. At a fellows’ reunion last year, organizers left a front-row empty chair for Mr. Navalny, who was in jail on fabricated charges meant to silence his efforts.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nHe would not be silenced.\nIn New Haven, Mr. Navalny and Wittenstein bonded over Yale football, though at first Mr. Navalny did not understand why players’ roles were so specialized — say, why a cornerback couldn’t also play center. But Mr. Navalny was a quick study, said Wittenstein, and soon he was discussing American football strategy like a champ.\nTen years later, after Mr. Navalny was poisoned with Novichok, a medical-grade nerve gas, he told a concerned Wittenstein that he would not “play armchair quarterback.” Subsequent reports laid his poisoning directly at the feet of Russia’s Federal Security Service.\nHe eventually recovered in a Berlin hospital and ignored friends who begged him not to return to Moscow. And again, he returned and was detained because to do otherwise was impossible for him.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n“He was determined to return to Russia, confront his attempted killers, and demonstrate his defiance to Putin — knowing full well that doing so would lead to his imprisonment or worse,” Wittenstein said.\nThen the worst happened. News of his Feb. 16 death was as painful as it was predictable. Official reports from the Arctic prison where he’d been held on sham charges said the lead Russian opposition leader collapsed after a walk — though a video taken just hours before showed a laughing and smiling Navalny, 47, joking that his judge and jailers should transfer money into his prison account.\n“I am running out of money and thanks to your decisions, it will run out even faster,” Mr. Navalny said in the video.\nUpon the announcement of his death, another of 2010’s fellows, Sergey Lagodinsky, a German lawyer who serves in the European Parliament, posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter: “Alexei's death is a shock for me & everyone who doesn't give up on Russia's democrats.” He also wrote: “We will keep fighting.”\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nDespite his long stints in jail, Mr. Navalny had a robust presence on social media, including on X and Facebook. As recently as Valentine’s Day, Navalny’s X account let supporters know he’d been sentenced to 15 days in a “punishment cell,” his fourth such cell in two months.\nHis posts were smart, funny, soulful — yet deadly serious. Always looming over his unabashed love of country was the puffy face of a despot president hell-bent on quelling opposition.\nLast December, Mr. Navalny’s supporters lost track of him for two weeks and team members quickly spread word on social media. After filing, said one team member, 680 requests with Russian authorities, they found Mr. Navalny in the harsh penal colony in Siberia, the one where he died.\nAll around Russian, protesters have created street memorials for Mr. Navalny — sometimes at their own peril. A video from TV Rain, a Russian independent television network based in the Netherlands, shows a series of people of all ages being surrounded and rough-handled by officers. Their crime? Laying flowers at street memorials to Alexei Navalny.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nRussia is barreling toward what passes for a president election in mid-March. The game is fixed. Putin will win, but Mr. Navalny, responding to a tough question about his inevitable murder in the Oscar-winning documentary, “Navalny,” said, “You’re not allowed to give up.” Mr. Navalny left a legacy of persistence and love of country. No matter where we live, we should consider that our altar call. Grieve the dead. Pursue justice for the living. But you’re not allowed to give up.\nSusan Campbell is the author of “Frog Hollow: Stories from an American Neighborhood,” “Tempest-Tossed: The Spirit of Isabella Beecher Hooker” and “Dating Jesus: A Story of Fundamentalism, Feminism and the American Girl.” She is Distinguished Lecturer at the University of New Haven, where she teaches journalism.",
