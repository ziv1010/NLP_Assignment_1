The Grammy Award-winning singer and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end have a rom-com worthy romance that began with Kelce \"playing Cupid\" in 2023. Two years later, he says their relationship developed \"organically,\" simple as that.\n“When I say it was so organic, we fell in love just based off the people we were sitting in a room together with,\" he told GQ. \"We are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values. It kind of just took the fuck off.”\nOf course, Kelce and Swift—or \"Traylor\" or \"Swelce\" as the Swifties call them–have been under the watchful eye of millions of fans ever since they coupled up.

He added, \"If you’re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets, and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it.\"\nSwift later revealed that they started \"hanging out\" shortly after Kelce adorably put her \"on blast.\"\nSeptember 20, 2023: Travis Kelce's brother Jason confirms the NFL star and Taylor Swift are dating.\nFollowing weeks of dating rumors, Travis Kelce's older brother Jason fanned the flames by saying that the speculation was \"100 percent true.\"\nWhen asked about how Travis and Taylor were doing during an interview on the WIP Morning Show, the Philadelphia Eagles star told the hosts that while he tries to stay out of his brother's love life, he thinks the rumor mill is \"all 100% true,\" before quickly clarifying: \"No, I'm joking, I don't know what's happening.\"\nSeptember 24, 2023: Taylor Swift accepts Travis Kelce's invitation to see the Chiefs.\nKelce invited Swift to watch him play at Arrowhead Stadium, telling the singer verbatim, \"I've seen you rock the stage at Arrowhead [Stadium].

So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for because we got to get to know each other.\"\nShe continued, \"By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game. We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date. When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there, and we don’t care. The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”\nDecember 17, 2023: Taylor Swift supports Travis Kelce in Massachusetts.\nReunited, and it feels so good.

My first album went gold in 13 weeks,\" Swift explained on MTV News in 2015. \"My first No. 1 song had a 13-second intro. Every time I've won an award I've been seated in either the 13th seat, the 13th row, the 13th section, or row M, which is the 13th letter.
