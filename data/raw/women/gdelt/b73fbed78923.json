With a twin brother and a dad who coached the local team, it was an easy way into football and I never looked back. I trained with my dad’s team for a few years before I joined a girls’ team, but I’d still love playing with the boys at summer tournaments. I grew up in Bexley, but when I started secondary school we moved to be closer to football.\n\"I’ve been at the club from the age of nine and a lot of that is down to an Arsenal legend: Gemma Davison. She used to coach kids when she was playing here and after one of her sessions, the Academy technical director approached me to ask if I wanted to join Arsenal! I’ve called it home ever since.\n\"I’m a defensive midfielder who loves controlling and building out from the back, under pressure. When you’re a kid on a five-a-side pitch, positions are fluid. But as the pitch got bigger, I found my space. I didn’t notice much of a difference physically until I started training with the boys at Hale End, where everything is done at a faster pace. I’d train with the boys twice a week, get in the car, wolf down my dinner and join the girls for an evening session.\n\"I was one of two girls to train at Hale End for three seasons and it’s an experience that has hugely shaped me as a player, particularly when it comes to competitiveness. Stepping into a set-up that doesn’t ordinarily include girls means you have to let the football do the talking. It’s not always easy at that age, but once the boys saw we could play they welcomed us. A lot of the guys we trained with have now moved up to Sobha Realty Training Centre, so it’s nice to see them around the training ground.\n\"Kim Little was a massive influence for me. Now I train alongside her!\"\n\"When I first trained with the first team, it was surreal. I’d dreamed of that moment, I’d grown up watching these players and now I was competing with them in training! That’s particularly true for Kim Little, who was a massive influence for me growing up as a central midfielder. I get the opportunity to train alongside her every day and watch the small details, which is incredible.\n\"I was a pretty nervous 15-year-old, but everyone was so welcoming. I’d had a meeting with Jonas before, but it really hit home when I arrived at the training ground.\n\"I realised the hard work had paid off, but that this was also just the beginning. I just focus on my football, wearing the same headband I’ve had since I was nine, and thanks to the players and staff I feel more comfortable in the environment every single day.\n\"It has been amazing to go on this journey alongside the other girls. Katie [Reid], Viv [Lia] and Freya [Godfrey] have been here since they were about 13 and Michelle [Agyemang] has been at Arsenal forever! The pathway from academy to senior squad is probably clearer than ever right now with the sheer number of us making that switch.\n\"Making my Arsenal debut during the Australian tour was a lovely way to end the season. The support out there was incredible – I didn’t know what to expect but it definitely wasn’t that! It just shows how worldwide Arsenal is. I’d had a taste of that atmosphere on the bench for the 2023 Champions League semi-final. Looking up at the sold out crowd and feeling how far our game has come was an amazing feeling.\n\"It’s great that the club supports us during international camps because the schedules often clash. I captained the U17 Lionesses at the European Championships recently, which was my proudest moment as a footballer so far. We were the runners-up, so it also means we’ve qualified for the World Cup in October. Captaining your country comes with a lot of responsibility, but I relish that.\n\"Ultimately, my aim is to become a regular starter for Arsenal but that doesn’t happen overnight at 17! This season, I’m going to push myself physically and technically in first-team training. Hopefully, I’ll go out on loan when I turn 18 to get some more senior exposure and match minutes, and when I come back I’ll be ready to compete.\"\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
