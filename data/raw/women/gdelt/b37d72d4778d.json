For those who were alive in the early 1970’s, it was an edifice as a model. When it was inaugurated in the age of Yakubu Gowon as head of state, Nigerians who loved soccer remember its first match and how a pass from wily schemer Haruna Ilerika set up its first ever goal by the stocky winger, Yakubu Mambo.\nIt was a rallying point of sports but it was also an icon of culture. The stadium would later etch many moments in national history, including sports festivals, the stimulants of our own premier league and challenge cup and, of course, the All-Africa Games.\nMany sports men and women have snatched glory on the turf and tartan tracks, from Segun Odegbami to Mary Onyali. By now, we should be debating how to improve it into an architecture of envy around the world and playing host to the world’s marque sports events like Olympics or FIFA World Cup.\nBut what we have today is a broken cathedral. No football team, not to speak of even school sports event, can thrive for a minute of rivalry. Rather, as a report by The Guardian newspaper exposes, its next phase of decline after sports seemed to expire on its grounds was culture scenarios. It played host to religious bodies in terms of crusades and vigils. In fact, from a spot of sports entertainment, it took the cassock of a holy place. It was the citadel of miracles and visceral raptures in the holy ghost.\nLater, it became carnal. Social gatherings like weddings, birthdays, funeral parties throbbed within its walls. That attracted street urchins, squatters and hawkers. Its new phase is that of bar operators and sex workers.\nThere were indications that the place would be taken over by the Lagos State government, but it seems the Federal Government would not let go. A glimmer of hope peeped on the place a few years ago, when the present sports minister Sunday Dare visited the place and promised that work to revamp it was on the way.\n“It’s high time we had a familiar ground for our national teams. The Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, and the National Stadium, Lagos, will be ready to host matches next year (2021) and it will be a major plus to our teams when they have a familiar ground. We discussed with a philanthropist and lover of sports, Sir Adebutu Kessington who was convinced about the proposal,” he said.\nIt was a million-dollar commitment. After the COVID-19 lockdown, work seemed to begin. Illegal structures came down, and the minister said by May 21, 2021, the place would enjoy a face-lift. Some officials, according to the report, said some progress has been made, but it is like a progress that exposes inefficiency and stamps despair. There has been uplift on the football pitch, tartan track and scoreboard, apparently. No one is sure of the scoreboard because there is no electricity to verify the claim.\nBut what is the point of field of play without a terrace to watch a man score a goal, or a dressing room for the player to wear a uniform? Report has it that about 20 drums of chemicals for the work has gathered dust and cobwebs for being outside the gate since January 2021. The VIP lounge roof is a skeletal scene with only iron barebones. Cracks mark the terraces walls and the fences are coming apart. The executive players lounge has been abandoned, with leather seats in wear and tear. The toilets and bathrooms are in disrepair and caked over and rodents run wild. The offices have no light, and water is non-existent.\nThis is not the National Stadium that Yakubu Mambo scored. If the scoreboard ever flashes today, it will probably read, Nigeria – zero.",
