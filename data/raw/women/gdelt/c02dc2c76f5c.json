  "body_text": "England goalkeeper Mary Earps has insisted that she will continue to push for more visibility and ensure Nike produce replicas of her goalkeeper shirt in future.\nEarps earned the Golden Glove award for a series of outstanding displays at the recent Women’s World Cup where the Lionesses fell to a 1-0 defeat against Spain in the final despite her heroic penalty save.\nThroughout the tournament, however, fans of the Manchester United player were unable to buy her shirt after the sportswear manufacturer failed to make them available for purchase due to a ‘commercial decision.’\nA petition against the sportswear giant’s decision reached over 150,000 signatures with Nike eventually announcing after the tournament that ‘limited qualities’ would be made available for sale but, for Earps, it is evidence that more still needs to be done.\n‘I feel really strongly that there’s a large group of people who are not being served by our main sponsor,’ the 30-year-old told ITV News.\n‘It’s a really damaging message to send to young kids. And that again, just ties into my passion for football, my passion for goalkeeping. I feel really strongly about you know, making goalkeeping cool and make it accessible to people.\n‘I never expected to make any sort of change. I just guess I wanted to feel like a little bit heard and I wanted also the fans to know that I have really been trying hard and fighting for them. I do think that’s a responsibility when you do have, you know, some success it’s important to use your voice for good and not evil.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

And I’m sure if we all want that we’ll all have a positive conclusion.\n‘We’re due to meet up really soon. And I think that’ll be now everyone’s had a little bit of time to rest and digest and process we can pick up those conversations and move forward as a collective.’\nSarina Wiegman’s side are set to face Scotland in their first match of the newly formed UEFA Women’s Nations League on September 22.\nMORE: Arsenal to make improved bid for England World Cup star Mary Earps\nMORE: Nike make U-turn over Mary Earps England goalkeeper kit controversy\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
