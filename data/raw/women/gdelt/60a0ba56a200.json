  "body_text": "Anthony Joshua has paid an emotional tribute to his two friends, Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele, who died in the car crash in Nigeria last month.\nThe 36-year-old was involved in a devastating crash on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway on December 29.\nJoshua was pulled from the wreckage and was seen wincing in pain before he was taken to hospital for treatment. Ghami and Ayodele were both pronounced dead at the scene.\nGhami and Ayodele were close friends of Joshua and both were members of the former two-time heavyweight champion’s team.\nIn his tribute on Instagram, Joshua wrote: ‘Thank you for all the love and care you have shown my brothers. I didn’t even realise how special they are.\n‘I’ll just be walking with them and cracking jokes with them, not even knowing God kept me in the presence of great men. 100% it’s tough for me, but I know it’s even tougher for their parents.\n‘I have a strong mind, and I believe God knows their hearts. May God have mercy on my brothers.’\nEarlier on Thursday, footage emerged on social media of Joshua speaking to UFC fighter Kamaru Usman before an MMA event in Lagos, Nigeria on December 30.\nJoshua’s video conversation with Usman was recorded by a third party which was then included in a video on the UFC fighter’s YouTube channel, however, the clip was subsequently removed.\nIn the segment, Joshua is heard telling Usman, ‘obviously, two of my close friends passed away’.\nWho were Anthony Joshua's friends Latif Ayodele and Sina Ghami?\nThroughout his time in boxing, Anthony Joshua has kept a close-knit circle of friends and associates around him, plenty of those working silently behind the scenes during his ascent to the summit of the sport.\nBoth Ghami and Ayodele were part of that group, considered good friends having worked closely with him for years.\nWho is Latif ‘Latz’ Ayodele?\n‘Latz’ is a long-time friend of Joshua’s and has been part of the AJ team going all the way back to his maiden world title victory over Charles Martin in 2016.\nAyodele was Joshua’s personal trainer and a dedicated Muslim having converted to Isam in 2012.\nHis Instagram feed is littered with images and videos of him alongside Joshua in the gym and relaxing away from it.\nJust hours before the crash, he shared a video on Instagram of him and Joshua smiling and laughing over a game of table tennis.\nLatif worked with a number of other prominent sports men and women with New Zealand rugby legend Sonny Bill Williams among those paying tribute.\nAccording to his Facebook profile, he attended St Joan of Arc Catholic School in Rickmansworth, a few miles from Joshua’s hometown of Watford.\nWho is Sina Ghami?\nGhami was Joshua’s strength and conditioning coach, a role he held for more than a decade.\nHe was also the co-founder of Evolve Gym in London. Their website states Ghami was a qualified sports and exercise rehabilitator who specialises in musculoskeletal injuries and corrective exercise.\nGhami was at Joshua’s side throughout his career, including his crowning moment against Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in 2017.\nHis last Instagram story appeared to be a shot of Joshua’s motorcade through Lagos.\nWhen Usman asked if Ghami and Ayodele had been seated in the front of the Lexus when it crashed, Joshua replied: ‘One was in the front and one was behind him, on the right side. They both passed away. It still hasn’t sunk in. It still hasn’t hit me yet.’\nAfter Usman expressed his relief that Joshua had survived the crash, Joshua said: ‘Life is short man, life is short. And now look, I get to speak with you for the first time.’\nUsman later issued a statement claiming he was unaware that his conversation with Joshua was recorded.\n‘After seeing what’s being written it’s quite heartbreakin,’ Usman said.\n‘Being on camera that whole day in preparation for The AKO show, it completely slipped my mind that my conversation was recorded. I realised after and asked about it. I take full responsibility for not properly watching.’\nMeanwhile, Joshua’s long-time promoter, Eddie Hearn, insists the boxer needs ‘time and privacy’ before considering any potential return to the ring.\n‘I think to be honest at this stage, it’s definitely a no comment from us,’ Hearn told talkSPORT.\nMore Trending\n‘Just because of the respect to Anthony. Obviously with everything he’s been through with the tragic loss of Sina and Latz.\n‘At the moment, Anthony needs time. Time and privacy. There will be no conversations from us about a career, any moves, what’s next.\n‘This is a terrible tragedy and Anthony’s going to need his own time, physically and emotionally.\n‘And at the moment, there’s nothing to discuss or say. Let’s give him his time and pray for him and of course all the families involved in this terrible incident.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Anthony Joshua to ‘retire from boxing’ after car crash that killed friends, claims uncle\nMORE: Tyson Fury’s daughter Venezuela, 16, reveals her wedding date this summer\nMORE: Jake Paul speaks out on ‘tough’ recovery from Anthony Joshua defeat",
