  "body_text": "A paramedic who \"brazenly\" stole more than £75,000 from Manchester City while working at the football, including players' items and medical equipment.\nDavid McNally, 47, who had served as a paramedic for the North West Ambulance Service for 27 years, appeared at Manchester Crown Court on Monday, March 10, after stealing items from the Premier League champions while working at its Etihad Stadium on matchdays.\nThe offending, which took place over the span of four years, saw McNally taking items including medical equipment, football kits, boots belonging to the club's star players, nutritional equipment and fashion items, before selling them on his eBay account for profit.\nSome equipment, including a hyperised recovery system, was sold for £500.\nThere were hundreds of items listed or sold that belonged to the club and items worth £24,676 were unrecoverable.\nAn additional £20,000 worth of items were found at McNally's address in Cherry Tree Way,He was caught in March 2023, after the women’s football department were made aware that a tracksuit had gone missing days before.\nCharlotte Rimmer, prosecuting, said: “The medical equipment that was sold or for sale was identical to equipment that belonged to the club that had gone missing.\n\"From academy through to first team, this is high-value equipment belonging to the club.”\nShe said there was a significant amount of planning and resources put into the thefts by McNally, and he had \"clearly broken the trust of the club\".\nIn mitigation, Dan Calder said his client was a man of previous good character, and he put on public record his apology and remorse for what he had done.\nHe explained McNally’s offending began as something opportunistic, where he would take relatively trivial items that were not being used, but this later escalated into more serious items.\nJudge Kate Cornell said: “In 2019, you began this offending; you stole an item from the changing room, some piece of kit, and you knew you were not entitled.\n\"These were not being immediately used, and you took them nonetheless and sold them for personal benefit.\n“Fortunately, none of the items were of no significant personal value nor irreplaceable. Some items were personalised, which made them more calculated thefts.\n“You were a well-trained and respected paramedic doing a worthy job in the community for many years.\n“You have thrown away your career, and for what?”\nMcNally had told probation he had stolen the items to supplement his income, and he hid his behaviour from his family until police arrested him in 2023.\nMr Calder said: “The consequences have been significant, and his medical career is over.\n“There are a number who worked with him and speak in terms which can be described as glowing, not only in his regular employment but also additional work in the community and with young people.\n“Of particular consequence is the shame he has brought upon his family. His reputation lies in tatters. He has put his liberty and family security in jeopardy.\n“Since his arrest, he has taken the steps to put his family’s life on track.”\nNow working in construction, McNally has not reoffended since his arrest, and the court heard that if he did go to prison his family was at risk of losing their home.\nIn sentencing Judge Kate Cornell said: “You have brought embarrassment and disgrace to your family.\n\"The high-profile nature of the club has put the case into the public eye and had a knock-on effect on your children.”\nMcNally was in tears as he was sentenced to 10 months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work.\nHe is also handed a curfew between 5am and 9.30pm for the next three months.\nREAD MORE: Speeding van driver had speed and cannabis in his system\nREAD MORE: Trial date set for man after entering not guilty pleas to wounding\nJudge Cornell added: “This incident is a personal tragedy for you, and you allowed greed to overcome your better judgment.\n“Don’t let this happen again. Your family deserve to have you present and supporting them. It was unnecessary and needless, ensure it is never repeated.”\nMr McNally will appear before the court at a later date to discuss the remediations for the offence.\nManchester City FC have been contacted for comment.",
