This format protects rivalries, increases competitive balance.\nWhat Does The New SEC Conference Schedule Mean For LSU?\nEach university will play three permanent rivals and six additional conference opponents on a rotating basis under the new arrangement. The SEC has played eight conference games for decades, but discussions over a nine-game schedule were rekindled by playoff expansion and rising broadcast income.\nThe SEC could be a trend setter on this decision. Nine games could become the norm in the Power Four conferences as a result of the SEC's decision, which might encourage the ACC to do the same. The CFP selection committee would find it simpler to compare resumes if there was such alignment.\nAdditionally, a nine-game schedule generates more high-profile games, which should increase TV ratings, fan interest, and conference teams' chances of making the playoffs.\nREAD MORE: Former LSU Football Star Says He’s Not Retiring After Viral Fake Social Media Post\nREAD MORE: Louisiana Women Accused Of Stealing Over $42,000 From Youth Football Organization\nTo read more on this story, click here.\nTop 10 LSU Tigers Drafted by the New Orleans Saints\nGallery Credit: Scott Prather",
