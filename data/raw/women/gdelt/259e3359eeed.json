  "body_text": "Publivery: Heineken® brings fans matchday ritual and their lucky pub - with them to Lisbon for the UEFA Womens Champions League final\nHalf of football fans have matchday rituals and nearly as many (46%)* believe their superstitions can influence the score. For two Arsenal fans, that ritual meant watching every game from the same corner of The Twelve Pins bar in North London - same seats, same beers, same pre-match routine. So, when their team reached the UEFA Womens Champions League final, Heineken did what needed to be done: packed up their lucky pub setup and shipped it to Lisbon. Rebuilt inside a truck, it gave the two women the ultimate matchday experience - ready for the game at the Estádio José Alvalade, ritual and all.\nFor years, London-based Amelie Margaret Kirk and Sophie Hurst have made The Twelve Pins their matchday home - pints in hand, seats unchanged. As part of its ongoing celebration of footballs most devoted hardcore fans and the womens game, Heineken transformed their personal tradition into a portable pre-match pub experience.\nPainstakingly recreated and transported over 2,200 kilometres from North London to the heart of Lisbon, every detail of their ritual was brought to life - beermats, bar stools, pint glasses and all - so they could follow the same routine they believe helps set their team up for success. For these two superstitious fans, its not just a pub - its a travelling talisman.\nOf course, it wouldnt be a real pub without Heineken on tap. Football legend and former Lioness, Jill Scott MBE, will be hitching a ride to raise a glass with two of footballs most superstitious fans.\nIve seen plenty of matchday rituals over the years some hilarious, some heartfelt, but all completely serious to the person who believes in them. I love that Heineken is matching the energy of superstitious fans at the UEFA Womens Champions League final. It makes me happy to see hardcore fans of the womens game being acknowledged and celebrated in this way.Jill Scott MBE, former England midfielder Who are we to stand between superstitious fans and their matchday rituals? From recreating a lucky pub at the UEFA Womens Champions League final to shining a light on the fans who make the game what it is, Cheers to the Superstitious Fans is all about celebrating fandom in all its forms.
