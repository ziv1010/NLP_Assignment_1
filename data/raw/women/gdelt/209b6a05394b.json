Here, TEAMtalk summarises the most significant rumours and confirmed deals to keep up to date with.\nEXPECTATION GROWS OVER LIVERPOOL STRIKER SIGNING\nLiverpool have agreed a club-record deal to sign Sophie Roman Haug from Italian champions AS Roma, according to reports.\nHaug, who scored a hat-trick at the Women’s World Cup for Norway against the Philippines this year, has become a target for Liverpool in recent days as they look to add another attacker to their ranks.\nDue to the speculation surrounding her future, Roma have left her out of their squad for their last two pre-season friendlies, most recently a 3-2 loss to Chelsea on Sunday.\nIn the wake of that match, an update from Il Messaggero confirmed that Haug will decide her future either today or tomorrow. As things stand, the expectation is that she is more likely to move to Liverpool than to stay at Roma.\nAnd it is now being reported by Everything LiverpoolFC Women that Liverpool have agreed a fee with Roma to sign Haug.\nThe 24-year-old will cost the club more than £100k, including add-ons, which would make her the record signing in Liverpool Women history.\nThe latest update indicates that Liverpool want to secure an agreement with Haug for personal terms by the end of the week. Should all go to plan, they will offer her a first taste of English football.\nPreviously, she came through the ranks at LSK Kvinner before moving to Roma in January 2022 in a deal that broke a record for the selling club.\nAt Roma, though, she is behind Valentina Giacinti – the experienced Italian striker who top scored for the Serie A winners in her debut season there last time out – in the pecking order for a place up front. She has made 41 appearances for the club, but actually has more goals (13) to her name than starts (12).\nHer contract in the Italian capital is supposed to be valid until 2025, but she is now set to be bought out of it and added to Matt Beard’s squad, who finished seventh in their first season back in the WSL last term.\nCHELSEA COMPLETE CAPTIEN CAPTURE\nChelsea have completed the signing of Dutch midfielder Wieke Kaptien from FC Twente on a four-year contract, the club have announced.\nThe first of those four years will be spent back on loan with Twente, after which Kaptien will aim to be ready to make an impression for Emma Hayes’ side.\nWelcome to Chelsea, Wieke Kaptein! ✍️\n— Chelsea FC Women (@ChelseaFCW) September 4, 2023\nAfter being the youngest player in the Dutch squad for the World Cup, the 18-year-old will now hope to fulfil her potential at Chelsea in the long term.\nShe told the club’s official website: “It’s a really big club and I’m very honoured to be here. I’m looking forward to playing football for Chelsea.\n“I can’t wait to meet the players and fans, but I am happy I can develop myself one more year in the Eredivisie.”\nMeanwhile, Hayes added: “Wieke is a top young midfield player. She has brilliant energy in the middle of the park, but she’s also a player who can play between both boxes really well.\n“She likes to get forward, she’s tenacious and her style of play will suit the WSL. She needs to go and keep developing and we look forward to her in the future.”\nKaptein already has more than 50 appearances to her name for FC Twente, including some experience in the Women’s Champions League.\nMAN UTD SIGNING TIPPED TO BE ‘COLOSSAL THREAT’\nManchester United are finalising the addition of Hinata Miyazawa, who won the Golden Boot at the World Cup recently while playing for Japan.\nThe Manchester Evening News revealed on August 30 that Miyazawa was signing for Manchester United from Mynavi Sendai.\nNow, the same source has confirmed that, although yet to be announced, the deal is still very much on for Marc Skinner’s side after they fended off competition from Liverpool.\nThe latest piece describes Miyazawa as someone who could be a ‘colossal threat’ on the wing. She will essentially be a replacement for Alessia Russo, who went to Arsenal.\nMiyazawa will be the first player from Japan to play for Manchester United Women once her move is announced.",
