  "body_text": "This NFL season, all eyes are on brothers Travis and Jason Kelce. After going head-to-head in Super Bowl LVII, they've once again taken center stage on and off the field this season. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis is rumored to be dating the most famous pop star in the land, while older brother Jason (center for the Philadelphia Eagles) just premiered a documentary about his life on Prime Video. Each week, the two sit down on their New Heights podcast to talk football, family, and, occasionally, fashion.\nTravis is known for his pregame fits (last week, he paired a shirt custom made from Chanel scarves with Cartier sunglasses and white calfskin boots by Alessandro Vasini), while Jason typically takes a more casual approach. Travis called out his brother for the outfit he wore to his Kelce documentary premiere (a black T-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops), and Jason tried to blame it on his wife, Kylie, who is the mother of three children under age 4. But Travis wouldn't let him get away with it.\nThe brothers shared the hilarious exchange on their podcast. Jason said, \"I was going to have jeans on, but Kylie was running late. I came straight from football, Kylie was going to bring the jeans. Kylie was late.\"\nTravis immediately called out Jason, saying, \"Jason, why didn't Jason bring jeans for Jason?\" He laughed and pointed out that Kylie was probably \"too busy putting jeans on the three girls.\"\nJason admitted that he shouldn't blame the situation on his wife: \"She was too busy getting the entire family situated with the babysitter, and then getting herself ready, and making sure her parents were with her.\"\nFans loved seeing Travis take up for Kylie and left comments like:\n- \"Travis understanding and explaining the mental load is my favorite part of this!!!\"\n- \"🤣🤣 difference between a single man and married one. 'Why didn’t Jason bring jeans for Jason' 🤣🤣🤣. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\"\n- \"Travis- From all women everywhere… THANK YOU. 🙏🏻☠️\"\n- \"☠️- freaking love that @killatrav called it out! 😂\"\nListen to New Heights on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, and see more of the family on the Kelce documentary on Prime Video.\nKatie Bowlby is Digital Director at Country Living, where she covers pop culture news including country music, Yellowstone, and all things HGTV, plus gift guides and product reviews.
