  "body_text": "BuffZone writer Pat Rooney discusses three topics on CU Buffs athletics with the football season kickoff finally on deck.\nSpecial expectations\nOn more than a few occasions early last season, I remarked to my BuffZone colleague, Brian Howell, that I wouldn’t be surprised if the Buffaloes took back a kick or two over the course of the year.\nIt made sense. The Buffs had an array of skill position players ready to field kickoffs and punts, and head coach Deion Sanders himself was one of the NFL’s all-time great returners. That never came to fruition, but Sanders hopes it’s a different story this season.\nDuring CU’s annual Kickoff Luncheon on Friday, Sanders offered the thought that his team’s improved depth should make the special teams units more formidable. He expounded on that thought during a press conference the following day, citing potential starters filling roles on special teams while touting punter Mark Vassett as a future pro.\n“Those (kickers) are really good. Now, finding the coverage teams. You have so many athletes, you have probably five starting corners. So those guys will fill the special teams,” Sanders said. “You’ve got probably four starting safeties. You transfer those guys into special teams. You’ve got so many guys with talent.\n“What I do is, guys that I feel like has pro aspirations, we give them the nod. They’re going to have to prove that they can’t do it, not that they can. We’re going to give them the nod to try and go out there and fulfill their dreams and aspirations. So if it’s a senior, a guy like (LaVonta) Bentley. Not only is he a linebacker but if he makes, when he makes, the NFL, he’s gonna have to play special teams. So you get him started with that now.”\nLast year’s win at Arizona State on Oct. 7 — the last time the Buffs have won a game — featured a 51-yard punt return by Xavier Weaver in the fourth quarter that set up an Alejandro Mata field goal. CU eventually won by three points. Making similar special teams impacts more frequently this season might make the difference in a number of contests shaping up to be ‘coin flip’ games.\nInternational intrigue\nDuring his media session on Monday morning, CU defensive coordinator Robert Livingston inadvertently uttered “Trevor Reilly” when trying to reference linebacker Trevor Woods.\nThe mistake was both honest and understandable, as the details of the Reilly story have been difficult to shake.\nFor those who by some miracle missed the drama last week, Reilly, the former quality control analyst who left the CU program earlier in the preseason, revealed he had sought NIL funding for CU football in the Middle East, soliciting potential investors in Saudi Arabia and Jordan.\nReilly himself admitted he was acting of his own accord, and there was nothing illegal about the endeavor. Still, several aspects of the story don’t add up. While Reilly was on this Middle East excursion, where did Sanders and his staff think he was, and what did they think he was doing? Did the guy who went public crying poverty over his $90,000 salary really fund a Middle East journey on his own?\nLike anything else, the product on the field might determine the fate of this story. Win big in 2024, and Reilly and his strange endeavors become a footnote. Fall short of expectations yet again, and all of the sudden the Reilly fiasco becomes the starting point when 2024 went awry.\nHuskies hovering\nNone of CU’s athletic teams have played a Big 12 game yet in the return season in the conference, and already the Buffs might be looking at welcoming a new (distant) neighbor.\nOver the weekend, reports surfaced that Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark once again is pursuing UConn, which boasts powerhouse men’s and women’s basketball teams but whose addition would buck the trend of conference expansion fueled exclusively by football value. UConn reportedly could join immediately for basketball (as in 2025-26) but not join in football until 2031, when the league’s media rights deal expires.\nYormark has been consistent in the message that he believes basketball is an undervalued asset. Many of the league’s recent additions — Arizona, Houston and even CU — bring more competitive cache on the hardwood than the gridiron. The addition of UConn would present a scheduling nightmare, especially for the Huskies. The nearest Big 12 campus to UConn is in Morgantown, W.V., more than 500 miles away. The next closest is Cincinnati, nearly 800 miles away. Boulder is about 1,900 miles away. Salt Lake City is 2,300 miles away and the Arizona schools are about 2,500 miles away.\nBut if the Big 12 lands UConn, might Yormark eventually angle for a basketball super league with other refugees from the Big East? The East Coast, old school basketball programs (like St. John’s, Seton Hall and Providence) have survived Big East defections before. If UConn gets on board, might the Big 12 basketball brand be willing to bring in other programs led by basketball brands that are in sizeable markets closer to the Big 12’s median geography like Butler (Indianapolis), Marquette (Milwaukee) and Creighton (Omaha)?",
