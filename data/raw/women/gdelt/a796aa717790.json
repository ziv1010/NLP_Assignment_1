  "body_text": "After opening the 2025 SheBelieves Cup with victories over Colombia (2-0) and Australia (2-1), the United States Women’s National Team is pursuing another trophy at the tenth edition of the competition. Despite coming off of a major title, an addition to the cabinet would further enhance Emma Hayes’ young tenure. The schedule closes out with a match against Japan, which should provide a stern test on the long road to the 2027 World Cup. San Diego, California’s Snapdragon Stadium – a 35,000-seat venue with a recently installed Ready Play Grass Bermuda surface – is set to host.\nUSA vs. Japan, 2025 SheBelieves Cup: Scouting Japan\nThe USWNT closes the tournament against a sometime rival.\nThis is the 42nd all-time meeting between the two nations, with the USMNT holding a 32-1-8 advantage and claiming victory in the quarterfinal round of last summer’s Olympic Football Tournament (1-0). Ranked eighth internationally by FIFA, Japan finished runners-up in Group C at the Paris Games with a defeat to Spain (1-2) and wins over Brazil (2-1) and Nigeria (3-1) before falling to the eventual champions. An October friendly ended in a rout (4-0) against South Korea. In the current competition, なでしこジャパン (Nadeshiko Japan) drubbed Australia (4-0) and Colombia (4-1).\nFor the first time in program history, the Japan Football Association appointed a foreign manager to head the women’s side, hiring Nils Nielsen due to his “style of football that involves good passes and ball movement.” The 53-year-old Greenland native had stints leading Denmark and Switzerland, claiming a second-place finish with the former nation at the 2017 Women’s European Championship, before most recently serving as the director of football at Manchester City. His stated intent is to “become the best in the world once again” by “always being a contender for titles.”\nNielsen named a 23-player roster for the SheBelieves Cup, a first-choice group featuring most of the usual suspects. The manager stressed the need for selections “who are in good condition during the season and have a lot of international experience.” Manchester City defender Risa Shimizu remains out after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament rupture during the Olympics.\n***\nGOALKEEPERS (3): Ayaka Yamashita (Manchester City), Chika Hirao (Albirex Niigata), Akane Okuma (INAC Kobe Leonessa)\nDEFENDERS (7): Saori Takarada (Leicester City), Moeka Minami (Roma), Saki Kumagai (London City Lionesses), Hana Takahashi (Urawa Reds), Tōko Koga (Feyenoord), Hikaru Kitagawa (BK Häcken FF), Rion Ishikawa (Urawa Reds)\nMIDFIELDERS (10): Hinata Miyazawa (Manchester United), Kiko Seike (Brighton & Hove Albion), Fuka Nagano (Liverpool), Yui Hasegawa (Manchester City), Aoba Fujino (Manchester City), Momoko Tanikawa (Bayern Munich), Maika Hamano (Chelsea), Honoka Hayashi (Everton), Narumi Miura (Washington Spirit), Yuka Momiki (Leicester City)\nFORWARDS (3): Riko Ueki (West Ham United), Mina Tanaka (Utah Royals), Remina Chiba (Eintracht Frankfurt)\n***\nNielsen will alternate between 4-3-3 and 4-4-2 formations but has a player-first style that adapts to the needs of the roster. His style is said to fit with Japan, utilizing a fast and “free-flowing approach, which cherishes synchronized passing and possession with intent.” He prioritizes in-form, two-way call-ups who “win aerial battles in any situation” while attempting to mix both youth and veterans along with “various techniques and tactics.” There is an emphasis placed on “individuality” and selfishness that suggests a change from Japan’s traditional holistic mentality.\nAyaka Yamashita remains the number one and should continue to hold onto the role for the foreseeable future. After a highly-decorated run in the domestic league, the 29-year-old joined Manchester City and has been in a fight for the starting role, adapting to the high-possession system and taking an advanced position off of her line. She has “confidence in making the first pass” when building out of the back, picking the right decisions under pressure and providing fantastic service if given sufficient time. Her handling can sometimes result in a few errors, but her coverage is mostly solid and composed with intelligent positioning and deft footwork.\nRoma’s Moeka Minami is “confident building out from the back” and has improved her “speed and physicality” in Italy with strong one-on-one defending, all of which coalesces into a complete profile. She will step forward and take the available space, constantly scanning her options while waiting for the right moment to play a long pass into the final third. Completing the partnership in the first two fixtures, Tōko Koga has the versatility to deploy in multiple positions and “brings a sense of stability to the defense with calmness and accurate situational judgment.” The 19-year-old Feyenoord generalist has “fighting spirit, duel [success], running ability, and technique,” aiding the cause by covering large amounts of ground and hitting long-distance passes.\nHikaru Kitagawa had a breakthrough 2024 with Japan and scored the insurance goal in the 3-1 victory over Nigeria at the Olympics, covering the length of the field and hitting constant crosses into the box. She is strong on the dribble and looks to push the tempo at every possible opportunity with just enough skill to force opposing defenders into giving her a cushion of space. Hana Takahashi of Urawa Reds is likely to become the inked-in starter in the coming years, boasting “sound judgment, physicality, and positional awareness” with “commitment to tackles” and “composure when faced with an unstable situation.” The Guardian praises the former forward as being “blessed with speed, excellent athletic ability, and good footwork,” while also serving as a productive presence who will latch onto free kicks and corners.\nDespite entering her mid-30s, Saki Kumagai continues to hold down a key spot and recently signed with London City Lionesses, bringing key versatility, leadership, and “the ability to read the game and perform in high-pressure moments.” The 34-year-old midfielder-defender is “an expert in deciding when to step up aggressively, when to fall back, and how to direct her teammates in stressful situations,” taking an active role with accurate passing and putting in a hard challenge when necessary. Fūka Nagano “creates scoring chances” when operating as a “deep-lying distributor” for Liverpool, serving as an unselfish “key cog” who complements a system by hanging back and enabling teammates to push into the final third. Despite standing at five-foot-three, her first instinct is to throw herself tackles without drawing fouls or putting herself in danger and also deftly shouldering away larger strikers. Manchester City’s Yui Hasegawa is praised by the manager as having fantastic skill on the ball, a tactical eye, and excellent reading of the game but also racks up steals despite “not tackling much.” She seemingly can do anything in possession with an endless array of dribbling moves, neat flicks, and long-range distribution that cut through opponents along with a powerful line-drive shot. The Golden Boot winner at the 2023 World Cup, Hinata Miyazawa, has failed to recreate that searing form for club or country but can still make an impact as a “dynamic midfielder” who puts in hard work on defense and maintains a high passing accuracy. The “magic mini Luka Modric” has morphed into a “central figure from which the rest of the team emerges and flourishes” at Manchester United, playing the ultimate facilitator while adapting to the physicality of England.\nAfter twice winning Most Valuable Player in the domestic league, Aoba Fujino moved to Manchester City, carrying a reputation as “a blisteringly quick attacker with a calmness in front of goal” and “a constant threat when creating and finishing chances.” She typically plays as “a wide right-sided forward” and a more traditional winger who “sprints along the byline before delivering an accurate cross” or “cutting into the box for some incisive passing combinations.” Maika Hamano has enjoyed a standout campaign with Chelsea, finding the back of the net five times, taking an active role in running the show, and forcefully regaining possession. Her role can float a bit around the field, although most of her damage is done when working in concert with a hold-up striker or midfielders who ping quick combination play. Momoko Tanikawa is the program’s big young star, back with Bayern Munich after a sterling year on loan at FC Rosengård that saw the versatile wunderkind score 17 times in 23 appearances. The 19-year-old from Aichi is a dynamic presence with “excellent ball carries and accelerations,” gliding around the field with seemingly impossible agility, smoothly turning away from opponents, and boasting impressive leg strength and shot placement. Riko Ueki will likely never recapture the unbelievable form of 2022, but the West Ham forward can still crash the net and create chances with excellent speed. Whether lining up on the inside or the outside of the formation, her hard work to press and harry back lines enables her to wreak havoc and pounce on every mistake.\nThailand-born Mina Tanaka was not an immediate smash hit when joining the Utah Royals last summer but should become more of a productive presence in the NWSL after getting a preseason under her belt. The 30-year-old forward scored four times in the past two matches, looking “energetic and dangerous as the spearhead in attack” with “a wide variety of shots in her arsenal.” She thrives in transition with intelligent runs in behind the back line but can also carve out crucial yards of space in the box and create her own shot with tight dribbling. Total Football Analysis notes her “pace, energy, and link-up play with the midfield,” demonstrating the ability to “drop deep and assist” when called into a supporting role.\nJapan is growing increasingly removed from the glorious decade of 2008 through 2018, but there are signs that things have turned in a positive direction. The player pool has deepened with a group of talented young prospects who should continue to develop and mesh with the current squad. With a few close results and some key players absent, the USWNT might be vulnerable to end up on the wrong side of an upset.\nThe match is scheduled for Wednesday, February 26th at 10:30 p.m. Eastern, 7:30 p.m. Pacific. Viewing options include TBS, Universo, Max, Peacock, and FUBO TV (free trial).",
