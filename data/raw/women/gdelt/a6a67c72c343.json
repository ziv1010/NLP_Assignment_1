  "body_text": "RANKED: The 10 best WSL midfielders on current form\n- The Women's Super League has just ten games left of the 2024/25 season\n- Ella Toone, Frida Maanum and Maika Hamano have all starred for their clubs\n- 90min have ranked the top 10 midfielders in the WSL right now\nThe turn of the calendar year has seen some bright displays from some of the best midfielders in the Women's Super League (WSL).\nMidfielders are the heart of football, tying together the defence and the attack in the search for success. Without our central maestros, the beautiful game would be far less beautiful.\nWith ten games left to go in the 2024/25 season, WSL clubs are relying on individual brilliance to inject success into their campaigns.\nHere, 90min have ranked the most in form midfielders in the WSL right now...\n10. Ruby Mace (Leicester City)\nThe 21-year-old raised questions when she departed WSL giants Manchester City over the summer to join Leicester, but Ruby Mace has since silenced the critics. The midfielder has adopted a strong leadership role in the centre of the park for Leicester, where she was previously on loan, dictating the play with her composed demeanour.\nMace's mature playing style has earned her back-to-back call ups to Sarina Wiegman's Lionesses squad over recent months.\n9. Maika Hamano (Chelsea)\nAt just 20 years old, Maika Hamano has been one of Chelsea's brightest sparks over recent months. The Japanese midfielder often makes her impact from the bench and has been executing her role to perfection.\nThe youngster brings a creative flair to Chelsea, working in cohesion with the bright forwards in order to breakdown opposition defences.\n8. Yui Hasegawa (Man City)\nManchester City would be lost without Yui Hasegawa as the anchor in the centre of their midfield. The Japanese international has started every game of the 2024/25 WSL season and is integral to Gareth Taylor's game plan.\nHasegawa's ability to control the tempo of the game is unmatched, and she has the potential to be heralded as the best in her position on the globe. City's inconsistency in the centre of the park has hindered her form, but she has still found the ability to shine.\n7. Honoka Hayashi (Everton)\nHonoka Hayashi has made a real impact for Brian Sorensen's Everton over recent weeks, ranking in the top 15% of the league for successful passes and successful dribbles. Not only this, but her defensive attributes continue to shine, ranking in the top 5% of WSL midfielders for duels won.\nEverton have themselves a real versatile asset in Hayashi and she continues to raise the levels in Sorensen's midfield.\n6. My Cato (Crystal Palace)\nDespite Crystal Palace's continual struggles in the WSL, My Cato has had an exceptional campaign. The 22-year-old has raised her levels this season, picking up three goals for her efforts in the centre of the park.\nNot only can she provided the Eagles with an attacking spark going forward, Cato's defensive attributes have been rock-solid for the side. Her ability to recover ground and regain possesion has gotten Palace out of trouble on more than one occasion.\n5. Hinata Miyazawa (Man Utd)\nAfter enduring a turbulent campaign due to injury struggles last season, Hinata Miyazawa has found her feet in 2025. Playing with confidence and flair, the midfielder has added impressive depth to the United midfield.\nThe World Cup Golden Boot winner has dislodged the talented Grace Clinton from the starting XI and has held her spot after a string of good form. Miyazawa works well to break the lines going forward, but also drops back to aid the full-backs who tend to press up higher up the pitch.\n4. Frida Maanum (Arsenal)\nAfter struggling to make her way into the starting XI last season, Frida Maanum has become the beating heart of the Arsenal midfield this campaign.\nThe Norweigan brings an attacking edge to the Gunners, working in tandem with the forwards to terrorise oppostion defences. Scoring six goals as a midfielder is no easy feat, but Maanum is doing it with brilliance.\n3. Sjoeke Nusken (Chelsea)\nSjoeke Nusken may well be the most versatile player in the WSL, which made it hard to put her in the midfielders list. The German talent can play up front, in defence, or ply her trade in the centre of the pitch.\nShowcasing her best work in the midfield, Nusken has been the glue for Chelsea this season. The 24-year-old's ability to split lines and break open defences with her pinpoint passes has been integral to Chelsea's success across all four competitions. Sonia Bompastor is working with gold and Nusken may just be the brightest of the bunch.\n2. Kyra Cooney-Cross (Arsenal)\nArsenal fans were rightfully concerned as they entered 2025 without Kim Little and Lia Walti, but Kyra Cooney-Cross settled the nerves immediately. The Australian has forged her way into Renee Slegers's starting team, proving her worth at the centre of the park every week.\nCooney-Cross's exceptional form was rewarded after she received the award for Arsenal's January Player of the Month. An ability to locate players with a long ball is unparalleled, and her ball carrying skills add further depth.\n1. Ella Toone (Man Utd)\nAfter a harsh calf injury sidelined her in the closing stages of 2024, Ella Toone has returned to football at her very best. Scoring six goals in 2025 alone, she is showcasing her worth week in and week out.\nThe England star has silenced the critics that were calling her inconsistent, and is ramping up the levels with each new week. Her firing form has arrived in perfect time as the Lionesses aim to defend their European title this summer.",
