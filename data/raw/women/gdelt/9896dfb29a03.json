That figure also has him joint leader for most tries in a season for the Blues.\nSititi thrust his name firmly in the All Blacks frame with one of the great individual performances in Super Rugby history so far.\nBorn in Samoa, raised in Scotland, Japan and New Zealand, named after William Wallace, the lead character in the movie Braveheart, Sititi overshadowed Hurricanes No 8 Brayden Iose, one of this year's standouts, to signpost his compelling future.\nBoth are fighting to join Ardie Savea as the second-choice number eight in the All Blacks.\nCotter believes his Fijian giant has improved in leaps and bounds.\n\"He has gotten better every game and he now plays a key role for us. Definitely a game-breaker now.\"\nChiefs mentor Clayton McMillan said Sititi has played well throughout the season and had a big game against the Hurricanes in the semi-finals last weekend in the capital.\n\"Definitely a big player he has become for us. I know he will be a key for us in the final.\"\nOn record this year, Sotutu seems to have the advantage. He made 138 carries, compared to Sititi's 125, beat 30 defenders against his Samoan compatriot's 23 and scored 12 tries while Sititi got two so far.\nBut Sititi carried 393 metres in post-contact carries, compared to 347m for Sotutu and has 93% successful contact rates. That's against 88 percent for his Fijian opponent.\nThe two are part of the group of Pasifika heritage players who have been named in the two match-day 23s.\nThe Blues have Ofa Tu'ungafasi, Patrick Tuipulotu, Akira Ioane, Sotutu, Caleb Clarke, AJ Lam, Rieko Ioane, Mark Tele'a, Joshua Fusitu'a, Angus Ta'avao and Taufa Funaki.\nChiefs have Jimmy Tupou, Tupou Vaa'i, Samipeni Finau, Sititi, Emoni Narawa, and Quinn Tupaea.\nTuipulotu returns for final\nMeanwhile, the hosts have received a major boost with the return of captain and All Black Tuipulotu for Saturday's decider.\nTuipulotu has made a timely recovery from an MCL injury suffered in the quarter-final win over the Fijian Drua.\nIt was originally rumoured that the injury would keep him out until the start of the Test season.\nHowever, the Blues have named their captain to return in place of Josh Beehre in the second row.\n\"Patty's a Blues man through and through and came to us this week pretty keen to play in a Grand Final,\" Cotter said.\n\"He tested the knee on Monday in the gym, then on the grass yesterday. He's pulled up well and has the all-clear from our medical team - he's a welcome addition to our pack, our talisman lock and leader.\"\nChiefs are counting the cost of a physical semi-final after losing All Blacks hooker Samisoni Taukei'aho.\nTaukei'aho suffered a leg injury in the win over the Hurricanes, coming off after the 20th minute.\nMcMillan has made one change to the bench, with Manaaki Selby-Rickit in for Naitoa Ah Kuoi.\nBlues match-day 23: 1 Ofa Tu'ungafasi, 2 Ricky Riccitelli, 3 Marcel Renata, 4 Patrick Tuipulotu (c), 5 Sam Darry, 6 Akira Ioane, 7 Dalton Papali'i, 8 Hoskins Sotutu, 9 Finlay Christie, 10 Harry Plummer, 11 Caleb Clarke, 12 AJ Lam, 13 Rieko Ioane, 14 Mark Tele'a, 15 Stephen Perofeta; Reserves: 16 Kurt Eklund, 17 Joshua Fusitu'a, 18 Angus Ta'avao, 19 Josh Beehre, 20 Adrian Choat, 21 Taufa Funaki, 22 Bryce Heem, 23 Cole Forbes\nChiefs match-day 23: 1 Aidan Ross, 2 Tyrone Thompson, 3 George Dyer, 4 Jimmy Tupou, 5 Tupou Vaa'i, 6 Samipeni Finau, 7 Luke Jacobson (c), 8 Wallace Sititi, 9 Cortez Ratima, 10 Damian McKenzie, 11 Etene Nanai Seturo, 12 Rameka Poihipi, 13 Anton Lienert-Brown, 14 Emoni Narawa, 15 Shaun Stevenson; Reserves: 16 Bradley Slater, 17 Jared Proffit, 18 Reuben O'Neill, 19 Manaaki Selby-Rickit, 20 Simon Parker, 21 Xavier Roe, 22 Quinn Tupaea, 23 Daniel Rona\nMatch kick off: 7:05pm\nReferee: Nic Berry; Assistants: Jordan Way and Damon Murphy\n*Live blog coverage on RNZ Sport\nFiji eyes OFC Nations Cup\nFiji will be gunning for a good win over Tahiti in their OFC Nations Cup Group B game in Suva.\nHead coach Rob Sherman knows a win will see them top the group, with a possible semifinal clash against either Vanuatu or New Zealand, FBC News reported.\nTahiti and Papua New Guinea, who play Samoa in an earlier game, will also be looking for a win each, as a loss willl rule them out of the semifinals.\nTahiti just needs just a draw against Fiji to qualify for the semifinals, while PNG will need to beat Samoa by at least seven goals to nil.\nSherman said they have been preparing well and are determined to continue with the momentum gained.\n\"That's really what happens in international football.
