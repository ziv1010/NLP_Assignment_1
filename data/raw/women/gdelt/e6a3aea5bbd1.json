It’s not saying that only Westerners can do science or that it’s only done in the West.\nI was in a twitter conversation recently about Mātauranga Māori, where a comparison had been made between rejection of Mātauranga Māori and acceptance of Traditional Chinese Medicine practice of acupuncture.\nSomeone pointed out that chi, one of the core concepts used in traditional acupuncture practice, had never been tested/evidenced in a repeatable experiment. I don’t know if that’s true, but the idea that if chi hasn’t been measured by Western Science, it doesn’t exist, strikes me as irrational.\nBy all means hold a belief that chi doesn’t exist, and make an argument for that belief. But presenting it as a fact rather than a belief is, well, not very scientific. It’s like belief is seen as a dirty word, which is part of the problem with this debate. Belief is used to cast aspersions but there’s also a fair amount of denial of the rationalist caster’s personal beliefs. Let’s just be honest about our biases and see how we get along.\nIf we can say that chi doesn’t exist in the absence of evidence that it does, does this mean that bacteria didn’t exist before the advent of microscopes? Humans could definitely observe and study bacterial infections before that time, so they even in the absence of being able to see bacteria, they knew that something was going on that led to particular outcomes. Contrary to the belief of some of the science is god people, humans also knew how to treat bacterial infections before the advent of either microscopes or antibiotics.\nSomeone posted this article as an example of the problems with teaching Mātauranga Māori alongside Western Science: Mātauranga Māori and science, from a government-funded science learning hub,\nThis paragraph in the piece was given as an example of mythology being presented as fact,\nFrom chaos sprang Papatūānuku, the Earth mother. Then Papa-matua-te-kore, the parentless, appeared. She mated with Rangi-a-Tamaku. Their firstborn was Putoto, whose sister was Parawhenuamea, the personified form of water. Putoto took his sister, Parawhenuamea, to wife. She gave birth to Rakahore, who mated with Hinekuku, the clay maiden. Hinekuku gave birth to Tuamatua. Tuamatua was the guardian of the different stones and gravel found on sea coasts. The younger brother of Tuamatua, Whatuaho, typified greywacke and chert. Next came Papakura, the origin of volcanic stone…\nHowever, when one reads the whole article, it becomes clear that this is being used as an example of how Māori traditionally passed on knowledge of the natural world within an oral culture that didn’t have written records. It’s describing both a categorisation system, and how that was communicated across generations. It’s not saying to teach ‘Papatūānuku created greywacke by giving birth to Putoto’ as literal truth.\nFurther, it goes on to say this,\nThere has been debate as to whether mātauranga Maori can be referred to as Māori science. Some suggest that mātauranga Māori is not science. Science and mātauranga Māori do not seek to do the same thing. Mātauranga Maori is knowledge – knowing about things (such as preparing poisonous karaka berries for eating). Science is about finding out why and how things happen (such as why and how karaka berries are poisonous and how preparation removes the poison).\nWhich is an excellent explanation of both how Mātauranga Māori and Western Science can be used together, as well as the value of Mātauranga and Western Science each in their own right. It also somewhat dispels the notion that proponents of Mātauranga are intent on teaching religion as science.\nAs it turns out acupuncture is relatively well studied by Western Science, but the science is underutilised. Back in the day, science is god people used to disparage acupuncture as woo in similar ways as people currently talk about Mātauranga Māori.\nWriting off a discipline as woo isn’t critique. It’s biased thinking at best, outright bigotry at worst. The arguments back in the day against acupuncture weren’t science based, they were ignorant and irrational, stemming from the Western mind’s inability to grasp concepts from different thinking systems, and some people’s unwillingness to bridge the cultural gap. I don’t think that all concerns about teaching Mātauranga Māori are like that, but some definitely are.\nBoth Traditional Chinese Medicine and Mātauranga Māori require conceptual literacy that is not common in Westerners. It’s like speaking two languages with someone who isn’t even aware that the other language exists but where both languages are need to discuss certain concepts. If this sounds snobby, consider talking with a theoretical physicist or mathematician without knowing what physics or maths is.\nWe’re seeing scientists with no expertise or even basic understanding of Te Ao Māori talking about it in disparaging ways (looking at you too Dawkins). The presumption is that because they are scientists their opinion on Mātauranga Māori is somehow relevant despite their profound ignorance of it. It’s hard not to see this as a long standing hubris from science culture that is also systemically racist. In addition to people of influence promoting that ignorance, they’re also feeding into the strong political narrative of racism in New Zealand.\nSo much of the ongoing debate about Mātauranga Māori is based on belief, and often unevidenced belief about what Mātauranga Māori is and how it is being used. I think we can do better than this. If we want to shift out of the polarisation, we have to use evidence-based arguments, examine our own biases, and be prepared to learn ways of thinking that are novel.\nFurther reading:\nProfessor Ella Henry, Director of Māori Advancement at the AUT Business School in Auckland, has a piece at The Spinoff Busting the myths about mātauranga Māori\nSociologist and author Scott Hamilton writes at North and South, As a Matter of Fact\n- Comments are now closed\n-\n\"Someone pointed out that chi, one of the core concepts used in traditional acupuncture practice, had never been tested/evidenced in a repeatable experiment. I don’t know if that’s true, but the idea that if chi hasn’t been measured by Western Science, it doesn’t exist, strikes me as irrational.\"\nUmmm…. noone who is familiar with the concept of the scientific method would EVER make a statement that Chi doesn't exist. This is essentially trying to prove a negative which is not what science is about.\nWhat you can state is that the concept of Chi has not got sufficient weight of scientific evidence behind it so the theory is therefore weak and does not have the support of being part of the scientific mainstream thinking.\n-\n-\nIt is not for the people who don't accept Chi exists to prove it doesn't exist and neither would I expect they would do so. It is from those that do think there is something behind Chi to show that this is the case using scientific principles.\n-\n-\n-\nWhat people who argue for great inclusion of Mātauranga Māori in science ignore is that science is not merely about knowledge. It is a process for gaining that knowledge.\nIf Mātauranga Māori is subjected to the EXACT same process that is used to ascertain other forms of scientific knowledge then it is science. It is as simple as that.\nWhat you can't claim is that it is science on it's own. The process used to reveal the knowledge is as important as the knowledge itself.\nRichard Dawkins doesn’t need to have an indepth knowledge of Te Ao Māori (or even a basic one) to understand this.\n-\nI agree, Gosman.\nSo does this practitioner and teacher of Mātauranga Māori:\nhttps://twitter.com/TeHenare/status/1633716470147596289?s=20\n-\n-\nI took the implication from your preamble \"Western Science refers to the lineage of how this form of science developed over time and geography. It’s not saying that only Westerners can do science or that it’s only done in the West.\" and the current conversation about the practice of inclusion of Mātauranga Maori in science curriculum. Apologies if that was a redirect away from your post.\n(I find https://twitter.com/TeHenare an interesting follow on this topic, giving a reasoned view rather than a purely negating one.)\n-\n-\n\"I definitely don't hold WS as a god.\" – As an atheist, neither do I.\n\"What I'm asking is that when people make the argument against \"the practice of inclusion of Mātauranga Maori in science curriculum\" they give examples that we can work with. The assertion that it is happening is insufficient for having the debate.\"\nFair enough. I have done this on previous comments, and if I have the time will find and repost.\n-\nBut Weka we do give examples and you don't want to listen. I've repeatedly raised the concept of Mauri, which is part of MM and is explicitly being put in to the science curriculum. One minute of searching gives these links:\nhttps://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=mauri\nhttps://pesaagora.com/access-vol-41/bringing-maori-concepts-into-school-science-ncea/ and https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/02/NZ-mauri-chemistry-kilmartin-seminar.html\nThis is just wrong.\nI actually have a Chemistry degree and this is false, not scientific and against all the core principles and findings of chemistry. There is simply no evidence anywhere, from all the other worlds cultures, that something like Mauri exists. ‘Western’ culture actually used to belief in it and discarded it because all the ‘proofs’ for its existence were falsified.\nYou are creating a strawman of the WS as God. it's not western science for a start and you're transferring something onto scientists that doesn't exist. Anything that meets the criteria for being science is science by definition. The 'ways of knowing' you seem so fond either meet the criteria and become part of science, or they don't.\nI feel you have this backwards. It's the 'Ways of Knowing' people who have some sort of 'god' fixation on believing their belief system sits outside of science and is superior. Read Karl Wixon's post on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6972283670992732160/)- it’s a great view into the MM God mindset and truly gobsmacking in its insanity.\nScientists on the other hand are the ones truly open to the mutability of their theories – everything in science is up for falsification, and that's the key here. MM doesn't want to go through the falsification test because it may be found wanting. Science is always ready to be falsified – 'strong beliefs loosely held'.\n-\nDid your university look at Dr. Masarau Emoto during your degree?\nThis fits my understanding of mauri.\nhttps://thewellnessenterprise.com/emoto/\n-\nyes it did and it's magical thinking, nothing replicates so not science.\n-\n-\n-\n\"I use the term 'science is god people' as a shorthand that I explained at the beginning of the post. I don't believe that those people think science is a god, I'm pointing out that they treat science as the one true way. And yes there are people who actually say that.\"\nThis was already addressed in your previous post on the topic. When Jerry Coyne says science is the only real way of knowing we have that is as far as I am aware true. We don't have any another way of categorizing theories about the natural world into true and untrue statements, except what we refer to as scientific methods. You are of course welcome to refute this statement at any time with a single counter example. Good luck with that.\nOn the other hand what I do see being incorporated with the introduction of the term western science into the debate is a complete strawman. The claim being that Coyne, Dawkins etc are allegedly wanting to remove any hint of Maori culture from the NZ science curriculum. This argument has never been made by any of these figures arguing that, they have always said anything which can be demonstrated as true knowledge could be included in the NZ science curriculum. When people want to say traditional navigation practices could be discussed in the NZ curriculum they are not saying anything Coyne or Dawkins don't agree with them on.\nYou ended your previous post with a comment that some people may have a valid concern here.\nI hate to break it to you, but those people have the exact same point as Coyne and Dawkins do.\nAnd you've found that point to also be demonstrated by discussions under this post,\n.https://thestandard.org.nz/did-bacteria-exist-before-we-had-microscopes/#comment-1938869\nAt this stage you should probably realize that people like Coyne and Dawkins have been quite reasonably publicizing some stuff which is simply not fit to include in the NZ science curriculum, in agreement with and in discussions with people at the margins of its development. They are lending their international notoriety to a worthy cause here.\n-\n-\nYou are clearly having great difficulty with that first statement. The claim is that anything we actually (correctly) know to be an effective model of the universe is scientifically verifiable. The claim is not that we only know things due to science. The supposed analogy you've tried to integrate into this post about bacteria just makes no sense and is nothing anybody believes.\nAt the roots of this there is essentially a claim that science works as a method because we observe the actual universe, and not a simulation of the universe. There is also the implication that we all observe the same universe. The implication for these combined claims is that what has been observed as repeatable will continue to be repeatable in related cases. Also what is going on is independent to what we think is going on. We may change our mind about what we think is leading to observations, but just thinking differently doesn't alter the phenomenon.\nA common alternative is that the universe exists in some way, shape or form due to the will of a deity. In this case they could potentially change their mind at any point and the rules of our universe will apparently be revised. This is functionally equivalent to believing that the universe is simulated and were not observing it in reality but are observing the simulated outcomes instead, or to believing that the universe you or I experience is not shared in common.\nWhen Coyne talks about science being the only real way of knowing we have this is a background concept in philosophy of science. The counter case is to find actual things which we \"know\" to be true despite them not being scientifically verifiable. Some people have a religiously held belief in the existence of god. This is based on the philosophy where some things can be unobservable and known to be true.\nSo ultimately this is all that statement says, its just saying if were teaching knowledge as science in science classes that doesn't include religious beliefs, its very minimal and its something you agree with.\nSo feel free to find all the traditional knowledge you like, feel free to suggest that navigation becomes a major block in the curriculum. You can do all that and your not challenging what Coyne, Dawkins et-al are saying at all.\nNow this would be basically reasonable if despite what I said was the argument, Coyne, Dawkins were actually going around and disparaging including anything into the curriculum which included traditional knowledge. But they are not, or rather do go ahead and find examples. What they have been doing is going through examples of concepts we know to be incorrect and better understood outside of Matauranga Maori (such as Mauri). And explanations where the model is either patent nonsense or describing a religiously held (traditional) belief.\nThis is precisely the same stuff that people involved in the NZ science curriculum has been highlighting (and forwarding on) as not fit to be in the NZ science curriculum. So again, if they have a point, they have exactly the same point as everybody else making that point.\n\"I just think that Coyne and Dawkins create more problems than they are trying to solve.\"\nAgain you could try to find some actual problems created. I know there is a lot of blather on social media but actual problems, I see none that they have created. On the contrary they do seem to have been of some assistance to people working on the NZ science curriculum in that the MoE (quietly) backed down from some of the more ridiculous materials. I would assume that you agree, life-force is infused in all atoms, probably shouldn't be part of the curriculum, over the objection of a significant number of chemistry biology and science teachers, anyway.\nAnyway so references. Well you didn't really manage to explain to me why Coyne is a shitty person to reference so we will start there.\nHere's an article alleging Dawkins motivation is racism and Colonization of the curriculum. De-colonization being addition of native perspectives into the curriculum, so Colonization meaning stripping those perspectives out.\nhttps://whyevolutionistrue.com/2023/03/04/the-new-zealand-herald-does-a-hit-job-on-dawkins/\nOr closer to home. Allegedly again Dawkins wants to strip any notion of native culture from the NZ science curriculum. There is a brief exchange where another Twit (wrong word?) points out this is a complete straw man and we find out that its apparently all tied back to defending the Listener 7, even if Dawkins didn't say anything of the sort.\nhttps://thestandard.org.nz/did-bacteria-exist-before-we-had-microscopes/#comment-1938998\n-\nScratch that. Its comment 18 from this page I was talking about.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nHow about everyone who comments in the media, like this:\nhttps://thespinoff.co.nz/atea/01-06-2022/the-place-for-matauranga-maori-is-alongside-science\nhttps://thespinoff.co.nz/atea/14-11-2022/busting-the-myths-about-matauranga-maori\nThey all claim examples like navigation and horticulture as matauranga knowledge, without going the extra steps needed to be science:\n1. observation that leads to a theory or hypothesis (knowledge generation)\n2. some form of experimentation to test the hypothesis\n3. replication – you can repeat your observations and hypothesis to others so they can independently verify you didn’t just make shit up\n4. falsification – you need to be open to testing under what conditions your hypothesis fails. Religion by definition is against this because it relies on faith and is not open to being questioned.\n-\n-\nRichard Dawkins is not really a poster boy for science. E O Wilson explains.\n-\nGosman melanesians and polynesians invented the sextant up to 6,000 years before europeans figuring out the angles therefore trigonometry as well and maintained that knowledge without a written language for hundreds of generations.Sailing over vast areas of oceans while Europeans still believed the earth was flat. and barely left the sight of land.Gaslights were only invented barely 200 years ago and are no longer used but you still use them all the time.\n-\nHear hear, well said Gosman. Weka's argument is another straw man designed to say that science can't understand/know this particular indigenous way of knowing. The reality is that if it can be shown to be scientific it's science. So please show us what we're missing.\nThis whole debate reads as one group (MM) trying to cloak itself in the mana of Science without doing the hard work required to gain access to more resources (a MM researcher at Uni is valued 7x any other researcher for funding). When push comes to shove I look at a few test – points to validate the MM proponent arguments:\n1. What we see is explicitly religious concepts like Mauri being pushed into the curriculum rewrite, and this isn't science. If there is a life force, show us please because w've obviously missed something in existing science. Otherwise stop this push because you are devaluing something important.\n2. Very strong proponents like Tara McAlister (in NZ Herald) and Karl Wixon (MM advisor to the MoE) crying racism, conflating knowledge with science (not necessarily the same thing) and in the case of Wixon, disparaging 'Western' science as following MM and making obviously false or deranged statements like Maori being able to see galactic structures invisible to the naked eye.\n3. NZ students are showing substantially declining scores in maths, literacy and science. We need to deal with this but instead we see a woke push to devalue and debase science with religious and cultural discourses that are nothing to do with the problem. This needs addressing but the MoE has it's head up it's butt and is not dealing with it. This. Is. Serious.\n4. Collectively. this approach does nothing to instil confidence that MM is actually science and is likely to at best not deal with the real issues, and at worse, make the situation a whole lot worse.\n-\n-\nsure, got it.\n-\n-\n-\nFrom his linkedIn post linked elsewhere: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6972283670992732160/\n\"TAKARANGI Science catching up with Māori knowledge.\nThe NASA images from the James Webb Telescope of a galaxy being formed are simply stunning, but what is also interesting is how NASA and the Science Community is slowly catching up with Māori knowledge. Ironically, the academic community of scientists in New Zealand was recently in a tangle debating whether our traditional knowledge could be accepted as science, to be honest I really don't give a f**k what they think due to evidence like this\"\nThat's conflating and disparaging (points 2 and 3). I can't find the post for 1 so will concede. Re point 4- the whole post says that the images from JWST are behind MM because the swirly patterns he presents is \"evidence that our ancestors knew about the formation of the universe, galaxies, our planet and tectonics well before modern science\". These structures are not visible to the naked eye – it's physically impossible, and given how old the patterns are it's extremely unlikely he knows what they were created for or to represent. Ergo he's making it up or invoking religion/magical thinking, in which case why is he advising the MoE because our Education Act is supposed to separate church from state when it comes to education.\n-\nMaybe Karl Wixon could tell us something we don't have a telescope for yet? There's a Nobel prize in it for him, though he would of course be attributing it all to the ancestors who told him of this.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nI suspect that any resistance to Te Ao Māori is not fundamentally about its status as a science or a non-science. More likely, it's a fear that a Maori worldview might contain concepts that are hostile to treating the natural world primarily as a place where self-interest may be pursued and capital accumulated. In this view, what is sacred is not the world itself, but private property rights. The argument that \"it's all primitive mumbo jumbo anyway\" just provides convenient cover for eliminating an older conception of the sacred and privileging another more contemporary one.\n-\nGiven that Māori have a diversity of views, and also have the natural range of personality traits as non-Māori, I suspect the current accepted form of Te Ao Māori is a curated one, crafted to promote certain political objectives under the guise of honouring Te Tiriti.\nMāori and non-Māori are not discrete groups.\nIn fact, most – if not all – with Māori ancestry – would fit inside the group for \"Other ancestry\" on a Venn diagram. More relevant is the fact that contemporary Māori have a diversity of world views.\nSo the current use of \"Te Ao Māori\" not just as descriptor for curated traditional views but as justification – is fundamentally flawed.\n-\nI think you are drawing a rather long bow there.\nI think there are elements of Maori knowledge that is scientific in some sense, as is the case with many ancient cultures. But to attempt to align it with \"Western\" science that has produced the likes of computer science, brain surgery, and space travel is ludicrous.\nThat doesn’t mean that studying Te Ao Maori isn’t useful. Just that it isn’t on the same level of science that has produced far greater technological outcomes.\n-\n-\nI didn't intend to ridicule Maori knowledge.\nBut, rather I see it as one of the many strands that has contributed to modern knowledge. And, I agree, there are still some aspects that are brought to light today, such as knowledge about the properties of indigenous plants. But, these days, I expect that even that knowledge will be subjected to the lense of scientific research, as will be the team NZ boat you pointed to.\nAll this sort of stuff is facinating from the perspective of understanding how we have got to where we are. But the vast number of strands from around the world, including Maori knowledge, form the foundation for the scientific method as we have it today.\nSo, to equate one of the strands (Maori knowledge) as equivalent to the combination of all the strands, is ridiculous.\n-\nwell said. No one in this whole sorry process of shitting on the Listener 7 etc has ever said that MM has no place in education, quite the contrary.\nIt's the violent overreaction of the MM crowd that keeps this debate going and enrages those of us who value all of science and all cultures, and want to see all the beauty and diversity of both strands of all parts of the human diaspora kept alive.\n-\n-\nThis seems false. The Catamaran was also invented by the Chinese, various European cultures like the Greeks etc, before Polynesia was explored.\n[I’ve popped you into premod, because you’ve made a lot of comments and it’s going to take time to work through them. I’ll remind you of this comment from me about evidence https://thestandard.org.nz/why-do-rationalists-position-science-against-matauranga-maori/#comment-1932400 If you want to make claims of fact, then please provide the evidence to support them. Otherwise we’re just trading reckons. In this case, please provide the evidence for the claim about catamarans.\nI’m also seeing you saying stuff about my arguments that is just false. I will address these elsewhere, but my suggestion is to slow down, and make time to check out what people mean rather than going on the offensive – weka]\n-\n-\ntsmithfield modern science is barely 400 years old if not for the Medicis you would be still a serf now stuck in the dark ages.yet your gaslighting every other race ,it was only 138 years ago that primary education became widespread.Maori had the first schools in New Zealand 50 years before the New Zealand govt introduced free primary education .Maori were better educated in their language than most of the European migrants in their language who arrived here. Had you been born in the !800’s you probably could have been a child labourer stuck down a coal mine.trying to light some gas.\n-\nWhat a spurious position to take. How is this relevant to the question is MM science? You are now playing the person, not the issue – one of the weakest forms of debate possible.\n-\n-\nAncient cultures is a slur a colonial gaslighting term.\n-\n-\nNo, it's because it's trying to push non-science concepts like Mauri in to science, which will confuse students and contribute further to our declining literacy, maths and science performance as a nation. You know, facts.\n-\n-\nIf we can say that chi doesn’t exist in the absence of evidence that it does, does this mean that bacteria didn’t exist before the advent of microscopes?\nExactly the same principle applies. At the point in time that there was no evidence that bacteria exist, the best that could be said is there is no evidence that bacteria exist. But now there is such evidence, unlike Chi. So, the best we can say about Chi is that there is still no evidence that it exists, and theories and evidence around cell biology etc are a sufficient explanation in themselves, without invoking “Chi”.\nThere is no evidence that pots of gold at the end of the rainbow don’t exist either. So, maybe they do exist.\n-\n-\nThere is however credible theory for the existence of chi.\nDo you really think \"chi\" qualifies as a theory? Afterall, the theory of Chi existed far earlier than our knowledge of human cell biology. And now, medical experts tend to think any positive effect of acupunture is actually due to its effects on key muscles and nerves etc.\nFrom the article:\nIn contrast, many Western practitioners view the acupuncture points as places to stimulate nerves, muscles and connective tissue. Some believe that this stimulation boosts your body's natural painkillers.\nSo, acupuncture may work to some extent, but based on modern knowledge, more likely to be due to known biological effects rather than the earlier notion of \"Chi\".\n-\n-\nBut, what you describe still isn't a theory in a scientific sense. It is a belief.\nIf it were a scientific theory, then the core aspect of \"chi\" would be defined. It would be possible to make predictions on what evidence would be found for the flow of \"chi\". For instance, how it might appear in a scan, or where in the body it is received, how it interacts with cell biology, or whatever. Then we could look for those effects as evidence that \"chi\" is real.\n-\n-\n\"Pretty sure\" and \"I would guess\" doesn't sound like you are that confident.\nI guess the real test would be what Chinese themselves prefer in their own medical research etc. If TCM is so awesome, then I guess they would have dumped all that Western science nonsense and will be leading the world with amazingly transformational TMC results.\n-\n-\nI was being a bit faceous.\nBut, I think the onus is on you to actually come up with some of the research you were assuming exists. Otherwise you are just making an unsupported assertion.\nIf what you say is correct, then sooner or later the will be an insersection of TMC and science.\nOne of the key components of western science is that it produces outcomes that are reliable, repeatable, and predictable. If you can show me that from studies into TMC, at a similar level that is acceptable in western science, then I would probably say that TMC is western science.\nBut if it doesn't produce results that meet those standards, then I would argue that it is not really that useful until it meets those standards, and effectively becomes part of western science.\n-\nWhat's good for the goose is good for the gander. Show us this research please, otherwise you are engaging in magical thinking.\n-\nJust look around you. Pretty much every made thing you see and use is the result of science at some point.\n-\n-\n-\n-\nI would guess there is theory now for how it [chi] interacts with cell biology.\nThat comment piqued my interest, so did some googling.\nQi (pronounced chi; googling chi in 'sciencey' searches also finds X-related pages, whereas googling qi gets a fair number of 'Quite Interesting' hits) is \"is believed to be a vital force forming part of any living entity.\"\nBelievers in qi describe it as a vital force, the flow of which must be unimpeded for health. Qi is a pseudoscientific, unverified concept, and is unrelated to the concept of energy used in science (vital energy [vital force] itself being an abandoned scientific notion). The historian of medicine in China Paul U. Unschuld adds that there \"is no evidence of a concept of 'energy' – either in the strictly physical sense or even in the more colloquial sense – anywhere in Chinese medical theory.\"\nMaybe 'placebo' plays a part in the beneficial effects of TCM? Here are three examples of recent efforts by researchers in China and Korea to integrate TCM/HM (herbal medicine) 'theory' and WS:\nInfrared Imageries of Human Body Activated by Tea Match the Hypothesis of Meridian System [5 January 2023]\nHuman meridian (Jingluo) system was hypothesized by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for thousands of years, suggesting 12 normal meridian channels going through respective organs, carrying fluid and energy, and laying thermal effects. Some treatments based on meridians have been proved effective. However, existence of meridians has never been confirmed, let alone the lack of measurement for meridian phenotypes.Exploring the Biochemical Basis of the Meridian Tropism Theory for the Qi-Invigorating Traditional Chinese Medicine Herb Panax ginseng [26 February 2021]\nWhile some skeptics believe that these researchers have found ways to fool themselves, the possibility that WS can (eventually) reveal mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of TCM remains in play.\n-\n-\nWikipedia’s page on Qi states that \"Qi is a pseudoscientific, unverified concept\", which seems fair, given that the explanatory power of Qi (in regard to the beneficial effects of TCM) is currently insubstantial.\nPhilosophers debate the nature of science and the general criteria for drawing the line between scientific theories and pseudoscientific beliefs, but there is widespread agreement \"that creationism, astrology, homeopathy, Kirlian photography, dowsing, ufology, ancient astronaut theory, Holocaust denialism, Velikovskian catastrophism, and climate change denialism are pseudosciences.\"\nHappy to be convinced otherwise re Qi – would be very exciting.

Instead of such an empirical criticism, the author sustains a comparably stronger epistemic contention, namely: even if the clinical results of TCM fared better than they actually do, that observation alone would not be a good reason to consider this branch of traditional medicine as a scientifically respectable endeavor.There's more than one way to look at TCM and the concept of Qi – my way is through a 'western' science lens, but I'm open-minded.\nUnless TCM is claiming to be scientific, I can’t see how the term pseudoscience applies.\nTens of thousands of Chinese scientists are investigating the scientific basis of observed TCM effects/outcomes – e,g. the PDF @3:32 pm.\nAnother recent comparative study [PDF], of a drug (pidotimod) and a TCM treatment (YPF), prompted a (imho) balanced 'western' comment:\nLost in translation: Evaluating traditional Chinese medicine by western standards [17 August 2022]\nAlthough the pathophysiologic concepts of TCM and western medicine may well be mechanistically irreconcilable, empiric findings of beneficial effects of therapeutics can still be rigorously tested. The trickiest part may not be reconciling the presumed mechanisms, but defining outcomes that both disciplines can agree upon. Still, studies like that of Xu et al. are an excellent step toward addressing western skepticism.I will be retaining the curiosity, skepticism and open-mindedness that have served this science head well so far.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nProblem with this treatment of scientific theory and knowledge is that its backwards. If someone wants to hold up Chi as a scientific theory first they need to propose a falsifiable theory (applying Chi). Then you can check it against known examples and discover if its false. You can't prove its true, though it might well be the best known explanation in its class.\nTheories involving bacteria had a similar period of development before it was possible to see them more or less directly using a microscope. They would be false had they said bacteria exist at this scale causing this phenomena and when that scale became observable none were observed.\n-\n-\nA belief system confers powerful healing properties, just ask anyone who believes in the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost.\n-\n-\nThere isn't any doubt that the placebo effect can be very powerful. But the problem is that it isn't reliable or predictable on a case by case basis.\nSo, it would be serious malpractice for a medical practioner to advise a patient to give up their medicine because the patient sincerely believed in the healing power of their pet rock or whatever. But, it could be useful to enhance the effect of proven medications etc.\n-\n-\nYes, that is true. Doctors do that. But, usually in cases where there isn't a proven effective medicine available, but the patient wants a pill anyway. It isn't as if the doctors prefer unproven treatments over proven ones.\n-\nAny GP who routinely prescribes antibiotics for a viral infection is acting unethically – and is contributing to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/patientsafety/features/be-antibiotics-aware.html\nI would be highly surprised if this practice is widespread.\n[link fixed – Incognito]\n-\nViral infections also lead to bacterial infections and the prescribing of antibiotics is proactive in these cases.\n-\nNot unless you are in exceedingly poor health, apart from the viral infection, and are almost certain to develop a life-threatening secondary bacterial infection.

For example, the universal benefit of widely-prescribed statins is debatable, with side effects outweighing benefits for those not affected by heart disease. And some people may be more resistant to a drug's action than others. Don't think that placebo is not used by the medical profession, just under another guise.\nhttps://www.thehealthy.com/heart-disease/do-statins-work-cardiologist/\n-\nHaving (sadly) had a fair degree of familiarity with serious and (in some cases) terminal medical care – that is exactly what the medical specialists did.\nDiscussed the medical care options (and the consequences – because there always are side effects) – and then discussed some non-Western treatments which some people have found ameliorates the side effects (accupuncture is a common one) – and asked if there was anything that the patient wanted to try in conjunction with the medical treatment.\nThe specialists have always said that any not-taken-by-mouth therapies are fine to try, but that we should check anything recommended to eat/drink with them to make sure it doesn't conflict with any other drugs being given.\n-\n-\nSo belief that God will protect you against Covid – is just as valid as a vaccination.\nIf you get sick and die, then clearly, your belief wasn't strong enough.\nThis is not a world I, personally, want to live in.\n-\n-\nFaith 'healing' contributes to the death of people every year, from diseases/conditions that medical science can easily cure or ameliorate.\nEquating it with medical science is profoundly dangerous.

I'm a (retired) science (biochemistry, mostly non-medical) head, and the evolving expert scientific and medical consensus opinion on the placebo effect is that it can have \"weak to moderate intensity\" positive effects under the right conditions, approaching and, in some cases, exceeding the positive effects of more conventional medical interventions.\nIf nothing else, 'placebo' is an area of interest and active research for some.\nIn studies and in real life, placebos have a powerful healing effect on the body and mind [14 March 2022]\nSometimes called “sugar pills”, the concept has been around since the 1800s.Placebo: a brief updated review [9 August 2022]\nPlacebo, in addition to its use in the clinical trial, should be considered another therapeutic remedy either as stand alone or in association with treatment, and could be useful in certain circumstances.Imaginary pills and open-label placebos can reduce test anxiety by means of placebo mechanisms [4 February 2023]\nPlacebos have been shown to be beneficial for various conditions even if administered with full transparency. Hence, so-called open-label placebos (OLPs) offer a new way to harness placebo effects ethically.Open-label placebos—a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies with non-clinical samples [4 March 2023]\nIn conclusion, OLPs appear to be effective when examined in experimental studies. However, further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying OLPs.Science is in a cleft stick – moving too slowly in some areas and too quickly in others (depending on one's PoV), but I'm confident that 'Western' science will get there eventually, provided current conventional research can continue.\nPlacebos expert Kathryn T Hall: ‘The effect can rival painkillers like ibuprofen or even morphine’ [8 October 2022]\nWhite People Who Got Placebo From White Doctors Felt Better, Study Says [10 August 2022]\nThe power of the human mind eh – still, to err is human.\n-\nThat's not a problem with medical science, its a problem with ethics if anything. The medical science (including statistics) can tell you if the medicine has a better record than chance. What you do with that information is a question of medical ethics.\nYou are of course welcome to purchase a copy of Ken Rings annual weather forecasts and apply to your needs. They have a broadly similar track record to placebo effects.\n-\nActually the medical science and psychology fields consider the Placebo Effect to be very powerful, as proved in science using double blind trials.\n-\n-\n-\nMorgan Godfrey's musing while mowing the lawn are worth reading in this context.\nhttps://twitter.com/MorganGodfery/status/1634686779482853376?s=20\n… western knowledge is normally separated and categorised. that’s as true for science as it is for, say, law (e.g. private vs public law and the subcategories within). but mātauranga māori doesn’t necessarily make distinctions between the descriptive, normative, and cosmological this is the beauty of mātauranga māori – it’s an all encompassing system capable of testing hypotheses and explaining and manipulating natural and technological systems (i.e science!) as well as being a cosmological system capable of integrating metaphysical narratives so obviously mātauranga māori is capable of being scientific but it’s more than that too – it can be a cosmological and normative system…\nThe whole thread is worth a read.\n-\n-\nI thought so too. I love a bit of context around a big, big concepts.\n-\n-\n-\nMy response to Morgan Godfery:\nValid points for academics arguing the philosophy of science. But NZ educators should be seeking to *include* indigenous themes not exclude on the dubious grounds of scientific purity\nI tend to agree with AB on this. Objections to MM are little more than Pakeha insecurity, unwilling to cede a tiny part of culture to Māori. And yes there's a Pakeha elite that benefits from spreading hate and fear so that the lower classes do not see where the true class war lies. Happy to spread FUD about co-governance and Māori elites, but when it's Pakeha elites like the banking sector flagrantly ripping off Kiwis then David Seymour heroically swings into action throwing around words like \"xenophobia\"\nThe billionaires in the America's Cup, and their local lapdogs, are the Pakeha elite. We are supposed to celebrate and worship the gods of capitalism. Fuck that\n-\nI largely agree with your point about pākehā insecurity. I don't see Morgan Godfrey's musings as pandering to that. I like the way he's situated mātauranga māori as something more than, but included in, western scientific concepts.\n-\nWhat rubbish. How is spreading religion like Mauri into Chemistry class warfare? Come on!\n-\nIt’s a peculiar Kiwi colonial habit to sideline Māori voices from the discourse because NZ is founded upon a massive fraud and theft of indigenous land. That’s the initial class war, but it is ongoing, perpetrated by the right wing who find the status quo of massive inequality suits them just fine, it’s quite profitable\nhttps://twitter.com/thedailyblognz/status/1635460876844007424?s=61&t=4nyjBVbo16PbRZPJZdlgag\n-\n-\nhe starts of wrong from the get go: \"western knowledge is normally separated and categorised\". It's not fucking western for a start, it's pan-cultural. Secondly, any body of knowledge sufficiently large needs to be categorised in some way and advancement of that body can only occur by linking to other bodies or deepening the body under study. This is EXACTLY what science does. All of science is underpinned and linked by Physics and Maths – everything, so indigenous ways of knowing gods like Weka are flat out wrong when they believe their pet WoK is superior because it's holistic. If MM evolves and grows at the rate that science does, you would see it also become categorised. There's this thing called the tyranny of 7 + or – 2 – you just can't hold that much in your head so need organising and categorising principles and systems to keep track of large bodies of knowledge.\nAgain, NZ'ers have a woefully poor understanding of science.\n-\nNZers also have a woeful understanding of Matauranga Māori., There is a rich body of knowledge there, and we are not doing ourselves, or our rangatahi any favours by suppressing it\nhttps://twitter.com/te_taipo/status/1631193482789527553?s=61&t=4nyjBVbo16PbRZPJZdlgag\n-\n-\n-\n\"This paragraph in the piece was given as an example of mythology being presented as fact,\n…\nHowever, when one reads the whole article, it becomes clear that this is being used as an example of how Māori traditionally passed on knowledge of the natural world within an oral culture that didn’t have written records.\"\nIf this is in the context of including Matauranga Maori into the science curriculum, then this just amounts to shifting the goal posts to win an internet argument. Congratulations on that, its a powerful tactic for winning internet arguments.\nBut on the other hand that context implies considering including this into the science curriculum. This discussion makes perfect sense in a social studies context, but I don't see the actual relevance of Maori cultural practices to Geology. I don't think I've learned any Geology from reading that paragraph.\n-\n-\nNo, you've understood my point quite correctly. The question is why your teaching history in science class. If your discussing the involvement of Matauranga Maori in the science curriculum, that's clearly implicit in the debate.\nYou don't get a lot of history of science in the school curriculum either, because there is not so much time, and more importantly because keeping track of the changes in the particular theories and their development is a bit bewildering for students who don't have a good grip on the actual concepts yet.\n-\n-\nagain, I've tried to show you the concept of Mauri is being pushed into science and is unscientific.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nHow do you think Maori found out that karate berries could be made safe to eat?\nI would say they would have used basic scientific methods,\nIe; if we soak these can we eat them , (I can guess how they tested it but wont)\nSo as far as I'm concerned if there's anything in matauranga Maori then surely it'll stand up to the modern methods of science.\n-\nWhere did science rise from? The significant evolutionary advantage that trying out new foods/agricultural practices/social cohesion models gave to individuals and to societies. Keep a close eye on your crop, increase your harvest, increase your clan's chances of surviving the next hard winter. Scientific curiosity is just human curiosity, but with 500 years of cumulative knowledge and debate cemented in a cross-referenced written record.\nTeaching science to primary school kids is about hooking into that curiosity. However, these days applying science to solve problems effectively requires 10 years of advanced training and gathering knowledge about your system, at least. Is some of the science/non-science debate really about a difference in the scale of time and information needed?\n-\nTeaching science to primary school kids is about hooking into that curiosity.\nIdeally school curriculums/teachers would foster curiosity and skepticism – my twin pillars for doing research. Tap in to the excitement of exploration and discovery.\n-\n-\nBwaghorn. They would have been desperate, is how. The NZ bush is designed to support avian, and not mammalian life. Away from a productive seashore, plant food resources in native forests are pitiful. Hence the molars of pre-colonial Māori with a lifetime of eating pounded fernroot that are ground down to the nerve. Thinks, a bird ate a karaka berry – maybe we can too.\n-\nI think autocorrect got the better of you there. There's a thing on them from The Spinoff:\nHow to prepare the delicious – but poisonous – karaka berry | The Spinoff\n-\nThat and failing short range eyesight,\n-\n-\nTrial and error is not science.\n-\n-\nWhat? Do you actually understand what the scientific method is? How on earth can you call this comment lazy? What is lazy is not bothering researching the epistemology of science and understanding that it has a rich history of methodological innovation and evolution, which is so far and away beyond 'trial and error' that your comment is simply laughable.\nI respectfully suggest you learn a bit about the topic before commenting in such a manner. It's quite offensive.\n-\n-\nI am well aware of the role of this in science, I have a science degree and come from a family of scientists so [deleted] for your put down. I watched my father do trial and error experimentation within the full set of scientific processes, and have done so in Chemistry research myself so I actually do fucking know what I’m talking about.\nI'm offended because I present a reasoned argument throughout this thread, then you say it's a lazy comment. Yours is the ill-informed comment.\nWhat you are in effect saying is that trial and error, without anything else present, is science and that's a ridiculous position to take, that's like saying cooking is science.\nYou need at least 4 processes in play to be science:\n– hypotheses\n– observation\n– replication\n– falsificationBy itself, trial and error AT BEST uses observation and replication (but not always) and by itself it's not science because it leads to things like mistaking correlation with causation i.e. just because two things occur at the same time doesn't mean one causes the other, plus a lot of other biases. To not fool ourselves we need at least all four processes.\n-\nNah, some things are not so clear cut once you start looking closely\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTrial and error is the basis of science….all theories must be tested and replicated.\nHaving noted that, not all trial and error is science as the term 'science ' implies understanding….observation is not necessarily understanding.\n-\nMeasurement ans testing are an important part of developing theories, but a lot of science practise is simply observation and taxonomy. Astronomy, biology, geology, paleontology have historically been based on lifetimes of study and collecting evidence. Not every scientist is out there inventing new theories.\n-\n-\n-\n-\nThis is yet another discussion of this topic that ignores one of the core issues: what the NZ Ministry of Education put into the NCEA Level 1 Chemistry and Biology curriculum, which began the discussion of atoms and particles with \"Mauri is present in all matter. All particles have their own mauri…\" The NCEA Glossary makes clear that this is talking about life force.\nWhy shouldn't scientists and science educators react skeptically to this? This is not some personal belief statement, this is the government-endorsed curriculum in an introductory science class aimed at students aged about 14-15.\n-\n-\n-\n-\nExplanatory Note 4 from the above link states:\nMauri is the vital essence, life force of everything: be it a physical object, living thing, or ecosystem. In this Standard, mauri refers to the health and life-sustaining capacity of the taiao, on biological, physical, and chemical levels.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nIf we can say that chi doesn’t exist in the absence of evidence that it does, does this mean that bacteria didn’t exist before the advent of microscopes?\nIsaac Asimov said that a caveman could have said that an invisible component of sunlight was causing his sunburn, and we would consider him to be correct. But the caveman also could have said that an invisible component of sunlight was filling him with divine power and gave him the right to rule, with just as much evidence as the sunburn.\n-\n-\nYou might like the Black Widowers mystery story where a sympathetic character insists that his centuries-old traditional knowledge will be accepted as true once science has advanced enough. None of the rational Black Widowers agree, but he keeps defending his beliefs. Of course, he wasn't talking about Traditional Chinese Medicine or mātauranga Māori. He was a minister, and he was talking about Christianity.\n-\nReminds me of a quote about Big Bang cosmology (I could rave on a lot more on this)\n“This is an exceedingly strange development, unexpected by all but the theologians. They have always believed the word of the Bible. But we scientists did not expect to find evidence for an abrupt beginning because we have had until recently such extraordinary success in tracing the chain of cause and effect backward in time….at this moment it seems as though science will never be able to raise the curtain on the mystery of creation. For the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock and he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.”\n–Robert Jastrow, NASA\n-\n-\n-\n-\nThe question is not whether the wider public accept Matauranga Maori as science or not…it is what are the practicalities of such.\nWhat and how are the funding implications of accepting MM?…be it in education , health or whatever…and how does it impact options/choice?\nResources are limited and how and on what we apply them is critical….increasingly so.\n-\nHi — sorry for slow reply.\nThe basics were all explained back in February 2022 here — Chemistry prof. Paul Kilmartin gave a seminar on the topic, I wrote it up: https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/02/NZ-mauri-chemistry-kilmartin-seminar.html\nHe also wrote an very good article on the topic in August 2022:\nPaul Kilmartin (2022). \"Mātauranga Māori and chemistry teaching: 'mauri is present in all matter.'\" Chemistry in New Zealand, 86(4), 157-164. Free link: https://nzic.org.nz/unsecure_files/cinz/2022-86-4.pdf\n…He did a podcast also I think, and the NZ Chemistry society had a session on it in November 2022.\nWhy all this effort? The history seems to be:\nFirst draft of NCEA Level 1 Chem/Bio (google-accessible 2021-late 2021): no mauri in the main standards\n2nd draft: Adds \"Mauri is present in all matter\", apparently this occurred over the heads of the Subject Expert Group (SEG), which did not suggest this. Went through a round of review, got dozens of negative reviews from science teachers (available on the MoE website), the Ministry comes back and says, basically, the policy is mana orite: equal status for mātauranga Māori, so teachers shelve your criticisms\n~November 2021: the v2 standards, with \"Mauri is present in all matter\" etc., are publicly released, to be piloted in 5 schools in 2022, with the plan being to roll them out nation-wide in 2023\nJan/Feb 2022: scientists start learning what is going on, Paul Kilmartin give his talk, later podcast, article, more talks, etc.\nIn addition to the public criticisms, I have gathered that there was some concerted behind-the-scenes lobbying from science teachers. A lot of people have had to put a lot of time into addressing this issue.\nDecember 2022: Mauri-in-particles is taken back out of Chemistry, and (IIRC) that the whole rollout of the standards is being pushed back a year. No explanation is given from the Ministry about who made this decision or why. While mauri-in-particles is removed from the main standard text and the Learning Matrix PDFs, it currently remains throughout e.g. the example lesson plans currently on the NCEA website right now. E.g.: https://twitter.com/NickJMatzke/status/1630356533619081216\nTo see the history of versions 2 and 3, see the wayback machine:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20210815000000*/https://ncea.education.govt.nz/science/chemistry-and-biologySo – as someone who has followed this closely, it looks like a lot of MM-and-science discussion online has been either blissfully unaware, or just avoiding, the mess occurring at the implementation level in NZ science teaching. It sure looks like a political directive steamrolled the good scientific judgment of subject experts and chemistry teachers, and this was only rolled back with great effort, and now the whole rollout of the revised curriculum is way off schedule and has been pushed back by a year.\n-\n-\nRe: Māori input — I don't have any inside view the details of what happened, but within the NCEA curriculum reform process there is an NCEA Māori Panel and Mātauranga Māori Expert Reviewers panel, I believe.\n(Please note, I would definitely not attribute any of this to them, who knows what happened. When I talk to real MM experts, e.g. Charles Royal, they are pretty strongly against the mauri-in-particles thing.)\nI do know one of the teachers who objected in the review phase said that they were Māori.\n-\n-\nThis is how the MoE rolls. Look at their 'evidence based approach' to open plan classrooms and whole-context-reading. Hint, there's no evidence in either. In the former case, the whole business community has been moving away from open plan offices for over a decade because they seriously impede concentration and learning, and in the latter, well, it doesn't work and has likely contributed seriously to our literacy decline.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOne of the points that often accompanies the idea of science existing outside the West is the idea that without a written language ideas cannot exist or if they are tracked that they have less validity than the ideas where they have been written down. Some people see them as less valid having been passed on orally and where all the proof of actions has been passed around orally.\nThis remined me of a very chilling exchange I had with a fellow HR practitioner/lawyer who was involved with me in a case involving an employee in a very new startup organisation. Her words were. 'If it is not written down, it does not exist'.\nNow I know that practice as opposed to policy is possibly harder to determine but this does not mean that it does not exist.\nI see echoes of this view every time we discuss the idea of science, in its widest sense, existing in other than Western civilisation. Oral traditions and tracking actual practice are very much thought to be the lesser than if it was written down.\nI often wonder if this person finds herself in agreement, still, with this idea. Perhaps though her law practice now accepts that practice can be documented later, it is more time consuming, possibly less efficient but it does exist. .\nExploring the origins leads me to a software engineer called Phillippe Kruchten\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/619681.Philippe_Kruchten-\n-\nYes of course you are correct. My understanding/knowledge and expressed the way I usually present it! Not necessarily only agreements but the state of the (person's) world, expectations, understandings at the time\nThe anti everything Maori especially science-related sometimes calls on the view that if an idea could not be written down and then passed on down in writing, it did not exist or if it did exist in oral practice it was inferior in some way.\nIf this idea somehow got through this lawyer's law school and law practice, and has stuck with her, and she did not hesitate to express it, how many other people don't believe that ideas can be passed down orally?\nTo be honest at the time (in the 1990s) I found the concept chilling & concerning.\nI reflect that she probably feels 'at home' with the concept that things don't exist unless they are written recorded and has been able to make her way forward with this damaging world view.\n-\n-\nIf you ever watched \"The Story of English\" they recounted how in ancient England story tellers were highly prized because they moved town to town recounting ancient tales. Science has long given weight to this sort of knowledge transfer e.g. psychology, anthropology, medical science.\n-\n-\n-\n-\nStraw man argument again. I have never seem science say that because it's not written down it's not science, quite the opposite in fact. Look at medical science – they often try to investigate efficacy of plants etc indicated from oral histories. Hell, that's how Aspirin came about.\n-\n-\nThis is what we were taught in Chemistry. How about you do a 1 minute search instead of a snarky post…\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_aspirin\n\"In the 19th century, as the young discipline of organic chemistry began to grow in Europe, scientists attempted to isolate and purify alkaloids and other novel organic chemicals. After unsuccessful attempts by Italian chemists Brugnatelli and Fontana in 1826, Johann Buchner obtained relatively pure salicin crystals from willow bark in 1828;[4][16][17] the following year, Pierre-Joseph Leroux developed another procedure for extracting modest yields of salicin.[16][18] In 1834, Swiss pharmacist Johann Pagenstecher extracted a substance from meadowsweet which, he suggested, might reveal an \"excellent therapeutic aspect\", although he was uninterested in increasing the number of chemicals available to pharmaceutical science.[16][19] By 1838, Italian chemist Raffaele Piria found a method of obtaining a more potent acid form of willow extract, which he named salicylic acid.[20][21] The German chemist who had been working to identify the Spiraea extract, Karl Jacob Löwig, soon realized that it was in fact the same salicylic acid that Piria had found.[22][23][3]: 38–40 \"\n[stop telling an author/mod what to do. Please also read the other mod notes in this thread, use the Replies tab and see where I have replied to you – weka]\n-\n-\nThere was a very long, multi-cultural oral history of the efficacy of willow bark for various ailments, mostly pain and fever. Researchers hypothesised there was a chemical in willow bark that had medicinal properties, so used organic chemistry disciplines to extract and purify it, then later synthesise it and later still create artificial analogues that were more powerful. There are a bunch of cool organic chemistry processes involved but it meets the test of science in the four areas I outlined above.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nIt is important for Maori that their contribution to scientific thought is not ignored and is recognised if we are to continue to attract young Maori to science. The cultural context cannot be ignored because it will simply stop young Maori from wanting to be in this space.\nOf course this idea itself can be tested using the scientific method. Has recognising the contribution of Maori to scientific thought attracted more young Maori to science? If there's no evidence of that, should we stop doing it?\n-\n-\nWeka, further to discussion above about TCM, something I would be surprised if you embraced or agreed with in TMC is the use of tigers in TCM. So, it seems to me there is a fair degree of subjective picking and choosing when it comes what anyone decides is valid from TCM, without any way to sort the wheat from the chaff.\nOn the other hand, scientific methods and processes are self-correcting in that later research will replace earlier research that is found to be incorrect.\n-\n-\nThe reason I don't support the use of tiger parts in TCM is because they're endangered.\nWell, I have good news for you on that front. China is now farming tigers for the purpose of medicine. So, if farmed tigers are being used, there is no need to endanger the wild populations.\nThis is different than than whether the parts are effective.\nThat is where a bit of \"Western Science\" would come in handy. It looks like a problem crying out for a double-blind study. Give one group ground tiger bone, and the other group ground beef bone, and see what the effects are. It doesn't seem that hard. In fact, a placebo effect could come in handy there, if the positive benefits are found to be due to placebo effects. Give people ground beef bone, and tell them it is tiger bone, and all will be good.\n-\n“If you think WS is somehow godly and pure, I have a lot to explain to you about that.”\nYep. This is where postmodern critiques add valuie; by questioning the power structures motivating establishment narratives. It’s quite obvious (to me) that the Economics profession is hopelessly corrupted by vesteed interests. The saga of Mike Joy’s water quality studies demonstrates the willingness of big business to suppress inconvenient scientists waving around evidence of their polluting extractive ways. Not to.mention big oil, big tobacco, etc etc.\n-\nBut what you are pointing out is not the problem with the science itself. But rather the interests that try and control the outcomes. That could be a problem with any field, scientific or not, including TCM and MM. So, I don't really see that as a problem specific to western science (I hate that term so much. Science is science which ever culture does it).\nAnd there are many other problems, especially in softer sciences.\nFor instance, research that finds no effect is just as valuable as research that finds an effect. But journals tend to be biased towards studies that show an effect. Hence distorting the true picture. But again, not a problem so much with the science itself, but rather journals that want to show exciting information rather than boring stuff showing no effect.\nHarder sciences such as chemistry tend not to have those problems so much because things tend to either work or not. Bridges bear a given load or they don't. Aerodynamics specifies wing structures that ensure a plane will fly at a given speed etc. So, a lot less room for subjectivity.\nMy field is psychology. Again, even there, there is huge amounts of variation. Psychology that leans into neuroscience tends to be at the harder end of science, where as discursive psychology is much more at the art end of science.\nAnd some areas call themselves science (e.g. marketing science) that are really just science in drag IMO.\n-\n-\nHow much of psychology is actually in reality chemistry?\nUndoubtably, a lot, in terms of chemical interactions at nerve synapses etc.\nThough, a number of serious scientists don't think that brain chemistry is sufficient to explain consciousness. For example David Chalmers and Donald Hoffman.\nTo some extent this is my point earlier and the drumming documentary. The inclusion of Maori in science should be to encourage more Maori to be interested in science.\nI don't think anyone would object if it was phrased as something like \"including Maori scientific discoveries\" in science teaching. That is broad enough to encompass ancient nagivigation by the stars, and current research and accomplishments by Maori scientists.\nBut, if it means teaching that Maui fishing up the North Island is on an equal footing with plate techtonics and geology, then it is just plain nonsense.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nWhat really angers me in this whole debate is that everyone seems to lose track of what's best for kids. Confusing them by adding religion into chemistry through Mauri is not going to improve learning outcomes, and we know they are getting worse over time when looking at measures like Pisa. As someone with kids at school now I see this every day.\nWhere is the evidence that injecting MM into science will improve outcomes for kids? Or that being proficient in maths requires Te Ao Maori and Pacifica world views as per the new curriculum?\nThere is no evidence so why do it? Just to appease some Woke Wellingtonians?\n-\nWhere is the evidence that injecting MM into science will improve outcomes for kids?\nThat would require western science to discover that. So, probably not likely to happen soon.\n-\nwhat are you talking about? there has been a huge amount of work documenting MM and developing topics for school learners. we can’t measure outcomes of something that hasn’t been implemented yet\nhttps://ojs.victoria.ac.nz/nzsr/issue/view/866\nhttps://ojs.victoria.ac.nz/nzsr/issue/view/865\nhttps://ojs.victoria.ac.nz/nzsr/article/view/7815/6957\nMātauranga Māori and science aren’t in conflict, believes Waikato molecular biologist Dr Jonni Koia, who is currently working on the potential of rongoā plant extracts for the treatment of diabetes. In terms of health, each knowledge system has something to offer that could improve health outcomes for everyone.\nAs for “what’s best for the kids” there have been many studies of outcomes for Maori and Pasifika kids, our current system isn’t working for them, but teaching in a more culturally relevant way has worked much better (3rd link above mentions this, but google for the studies at your leisure)\n-\nMātauranga Māori and science aren’t in conflict, believes Waikato molecular biologist Dr Jonni Koia, who is currently working on the potential of rongoā plant extracts for the treatment of diabetes.

And now this is part of the \"western science\" regime because it is applying \"western science\" methodology to rongoa plant extracts. This is the same sort of process that has been applied to plant extracts from numerous countries I expect.\nAs I have said before, science is science. It is culture and colour blind.\n-\nWhich studies? I have whanau that have never even heard of Matauranga Maori, so I'd be interested to see if this has really been studied or not.\nI read (can't find the link, will keep looking) that this is actually a class based issue i.e. lower SES kids are across the board doing poorly in maths, literacy and science. My hunch from seeing how kids are taught, it is mostly due to the 'whole word/context' literacy style in vogue in NZ which results in something like 25% of kids not learning to read properly. Everything goes downhill from there because they feel inadequate as learners. Then there's how they teach Maths – practicum riddled with errors, no attempt to mark completed work and feed back to kids what worked and what didn't, throwing 'strategies' at kids then not bothering to find out what worked for each individual child.\n-\n-\n-\nLocal historian Scott Hamilton joins the fray. A good review of MM and its interactions with WS from an historical perspective\nhttps://twitter.com/sikotihamiltonr/status/1635584461059534848?s=61&t=4nyjBVbo16PbRZPJZdlgag\n-\nI am not sure that Dawkins was attacking everything. Rather, the inclusion of the non-scientific aspects of MM in science.\nMy understanding of the scientific method is that it is research and experimentation that produces valid, reliable, predictable, and repeatable outcomes. So, navigating by the stars obviously meets criterea, obviously, because Maori are here.\nAnd, because it seems likely there wasn’t only one trip using the stars, it definitely seems to meet the test of predictability and reliability.\nAspects of MM or anything else that doesn't meet that criteria isn't science and shouldn't be included in teaching science. So, we shouldn't, for example, be teaching students that Maui fished up NZ as part of a science course when plate techtonics and geology provide better explanations.\n-\n-\n-\nNot everything may be described by rationalist intellection. For example, the claim that \"science will one day explain everything\", or the experience of a mother's love, both require a degree of faith\n-\nSure. There are lots of things science may never know.\nFor instance, will science ever solve the hard problem of consciousness?; is there life after death?; is the multiverse a real thing?; what existed before the current universe; etc etc.\nAnd I would never decry someone's faith. So long as it is recognised that faith is not science. In fact, if science already knew everything, faith would not be needed.\n-\n-\n-\nI think there is a degree to which we are talking past each other here. I don't think Dawkins or many others would disagree with scientific aspects of MM, TCM, or anything else being taught as part of a science clase.\nThe main objection is that, as far as I can see, proponents of the argument for including MM mean including MM as a whole, including all the myths and legends as well.\nIf we are going to do that, then we might as well chuck the Bible in as well. Because, that predicted the universe had a beginning before modern science did, and in fact, quite accurately describes the conditions at that time. That is formless and void, and that light was the first thing to exist in a visible form, anyway.\nAnd, I am sure has other aspects of science sprinkled through it as well if one were to look for it.\n- Comments are now closed",
