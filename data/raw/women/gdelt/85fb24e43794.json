However, during takeoff, eyewitnesses reported hearing a loud noise, which resulted in the pilots aborting takeoff and steering the Boeing 737-800 back into a parking position on the apron. The players were immediately evacuated from the plane.\nArsenal issued this official statement, via the Guardian:\n“Our aircraft developed a technical issue prior to take-off in Germany on Sunday evening,” Arsenal said.\n“As a result, we remained in Wolfsburg overnight on Sunday before flying back to England on Monday afternoon. We would like to thank the staff on board the aircraft and on the ground at the airport for their assistance.”\nThe airport spokesperson stated that fire officials promptly responded to the incident, but no intervention was required. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries. The spokesperson also mentioned that a bird strike might have been the reason behind the engine fire. As per Bild, it is probable that multiple birds collided with the airplane engine.\nAfter the incident, the team stayed in a nearby hotel for the remainder of the evening before traveling on a substitute plane back to London on Monday.\nThank goodness our Gunners are OK!\nFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Womens Team!\nDo you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?
