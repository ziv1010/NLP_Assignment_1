The outdoor ceremony took place on Wednesday, September 4, at FDNY Headquarters (9 MetroTech Center in Brooklyn). The ceremony can be viewed live on the Department’s website at www.nyc.gov/FDNY or at www.youtube.com/@OfficialFDNY/streams.\nThe Department has lost more than 360 members to World Trade Center illnesses.\nThe following names were added to the Memorial Wall:\nLieutenant James K.

Tucker; Acting Chief of Department John Esposito; and FDNY members and families.\nMOMENT OF SILENCE IN NYC SCHOOLS ON 9/11:\nNew York State Assemblywoman Stacey Pheffer Amato reached out to the principals of the schools throughout the community, along with the Chancellor of the NYC Board of Education, and Commissioner of the New York State Department of Education, to remind them of a law she passed in 2019 with regards to commemorating the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Pheffer Amato succeeded in passing legislation with NYS Senator Joseph Addabbo Jr. that would require all public schools throughout the State of New York to observe a moment of silence and discuss the event of September 11, 2001.\n“The terrorist attack had, and still has, a deep impact on our State’s history and was felt by so may in our community, and across our great State. As no student currently in K-12 was alive during the attack, it is imperative that our public education system take the time to educate students on both the loss and heroism experienced on September 11th. By mandating a brief moment of silent reflection every year on September 11th, we ensure that future generations will better understand this day and its place in our history,” said Assemblywoman Pheffer Amato.\nThe unique law passed both chambers with survivor groups praising Pheffer Amato for her commitment to ensuring that all school children would forever understand and learn how to honor the victims of 9/11, while also commemorating the survivors and heroes. The bill A.1801 (2019) amends the New York State Education law to make a special provision for the observance of a “brief period of silence” each September 11th at the start of the school day in schools state-wide. According to the language in the bill, this would provide students with the “opportunity for silent prayer or for silent reflection” on the anniversary day.\nAssemblywoman Pheffer Amato, who is known as one of the most successful legislators for 9/11 victims and first responders, was also responsible for ensuring the longevity of the September 11th Workers Protection Task Force (A.10249, 2020) as the task force created the pension benefits for first responders who participated in the rescue, recovery, and cleanup of Ground Zero. In addition, Pheffer Amato was the sponsor and led the legislation that ensured that public employees involved in the rescue and cleanup of the World Trade Center would have unlimited line of duty sick leave for any 9/11 related illnesses (A.7819, 2019).\nFIREFIGHTER JACK BOYLE HONORED:\nCouncil Member Robert Holden announced that a street co-naming ceremony was held to honor John “Jack” Boyle, a decorated firefighter with FDNY Rescue Company 1, former NYC Transit Police Officer and a Vietnam War veteran who served in the United States Army. Boyle was a first responder at Ground Zero and named “Man of the Year” by the FDNY Holy Name Society in 2002. The event took place on Saturday, September 7, at the corner of 78th Street and Furmanville Avenue, Middle Village (near 65-02 78th St, Middle Village, NY 11379)\nExpected to attend were Council Member Robert Holden, FDNY, United States Army, family, friends, and community members.\nFor more info on Jack Boyle, visit https://www.firehero.org/fallen-firefighter/jack-boyle/\n$10B FOR HEALTH INSURANCE TO 1.5M NY’ERS:\nExpanded Eligibility Under Federal State Innovation Waiver Ensures More New Yorkers Are Now Covered Under State’s Essential Plan\nNew Enrollees in Essential Plan Will Save Over $6,100 Per Year\nNew York Receives Nation’s Largest State Innovation Waiver Award to Date\nFunding Received Through Affordable Care Act\nGovernor Kathy Hochul announced that New York State received a final commitment of $10 billion from the federal government to provide high-quality, affordable health insurance to approximately 1.5 million New Yorkers. Following sustained advocacy by the Governor, New York secured this funding through the federal State Innovation Waiver. The $10 billion commitment marks the nation’s largest State Innovation Waiver award to date.\n“By securing this nation-leading investment, we’re expanding affordable health insurance for New Yorkers and continuing to address the cost of living in communities statewide,”Governor Hochul said. ”I’ll never stop fighting to ensure New Yorkers get the affordable, quality care they need.”\nThis funding commitment follows through on the Governor’s previous announcement that New York expanded eligibility levels for the Essential Plan, a public health insurance program offered through the NY State of Health. The expanded eligibility ensured that more than 200,000 additional New Yorkers are newly covered under the Essential Plan this year, making a total of approximately 1.5 million covered statewide.\nNew enrollees in the Essential Plan are estimated to save over $6,100 each year compared to what they would have paid for commercial coverage.\nStatewide enrollment includes 919,107 people in the NYC metropolitan area.\nThe $10 billion in federal funding for 2024 includes approximately $1 billion made possible because of the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA extended the availability of enhanced premium tax credit subsidies, which are set to expire in 2025 if Congress does not act. IRA-enhanced premium subsidies have been a critical funding source, enabling New York to expand affordable coverage and achieve record enrollment.\nOn April 1, 2024, New York expanded eligibility levels for the Essential Plan, a public health insurance program offered through the NY State of Health. The Essential Plan is now available to New Yorkers with incomes up to 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, $37,650 annual income for an individual in 2024. This expansion resulted from New York’s Section 1332 State Innovation Waiver application, approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Treasury on March 1, 2024. Thanks to the waiver, approximately 1.5 million New Yorkers across the State are getting health plan coverage with $0 premiums and low or no cost-sharing. New York has received interim payments in April and August that allowed an on-time launch of the program’s expansion in April 2024.\nSection 1332 State Innovation Waivers allows states to pursue innovative strategies for providing residents access to high-quality, affordable health insurance. New York’s waiver was approved for five years, from 2024 through 2028. Funding amounts for 2025 through 2028 will be determined on a year-by-year basis.\nComplementing New York’s recently approved 1115 Medicaid Demonstration waiver, this 1332 waiver New York also seeks to address social determinants of health for Essential Plan enrollees. Waiver funding will support grants that address food insecurity, including through food pharmacies and medically tailored meals, and will support enrollees with persistent asthma by providing them with air conditioners to protect their health and reduce the number of Emergency Department visits. This waiver will also support grants to insurers to increase access to behavioral health providers and services, including mobile crisis units, crisis diversion centers and crisis respite centers.\nNew York’s high coverage levels are also a result of the State’s fully integrated marketplace model, across public and private health insurance products, which allows the State to maintain higher coverage levels because individuals can seamlessly change programs when their incomes or family circumstances change.\nFor more information about the NY State of Health Marketplace, please visit: https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/ or call Customer Service at 1-855-355-5777, TTY: 1-800-662-1220 or find an enrollment assistant.\nAMERICAN HOSTAGE KILLED:\nAssemblyman David Weprin released the following statement on the death of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin: “I was devastated to learn the news that American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, along with 5 other Israeli hostages kidnapped on October 7th, were brutally murdered by Hamas in cold blood. I had the opportunity to speak with Hersh’s parents, Jon and Rachel, while in Chicago at the DNC, and their pain and suffering through this difficult time have been unimaginable. We are all heartbroken by this news. Hamas must release all the remaining hostages. May Hersh’s memory be a blessing.”\nCHINESE SPY REVEALED:\nNew York State Conservative Party Chairman Gerard Kassar released the following Statement regarding the discovery of a Chinese spy working in a New York government office: “This is no one-day news story: A spy for the Chinese Communist Party has been captured after working for years at some of the highest levels of New York State government. The situation demands an immediate and exhaustive federal and state investigation to determine just how much damage this spy network has done. “The story doesn’t begin here. Last year we learned that the Chinese Communist Party was establishing ‘police precincts’ in New York and elsewhere to track and harass anti-communist Americans, Chinese expatriates, citizens of the democratic Republic of China (ROC) living in the U.S., and others. (We) now learn that a former Deputy Chief of Staff to two New York State governors was an agent for the Chinese Communist Party the whole time she served. The situation is intolerable.\n“The relationship between the U.S. and Communist China has been spiraling downward for years, yet our defenses against their attempts to penetrate U.S. government entities haven’t kept pace with that reality, as is clearly evidenced in New York. Any attempts to sweep this national security threat under the table will be equally intolerable. We need answers, and we should spend all the time needed to unearth and unravel the damage that’s been done. The stakes couldn’t be higher.”\nDESTINATION RECEPTION ASSISTANCE ACT:\nLegislation provides resources and basic needs that ease the burden on communities welcoming new immigrants\nRepresentative Grace Meng (NY-06), Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Representative Delia Ramirez (IL-03), and Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) introduced the Destination Reception Assistance Act, legislation to expand the federal government’s role in the reception of new arrivals by establishing the Destination Reception Services Program, a new fund to promote self-sufficiency; reduce costs of extended emergency shelter; provide diversion from homelessness; and promote the effective navigation and compliance of the immigration process. The new program would complement the existing Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Shelter and Services Program that provides critical support such as food, water, shelter, and medical treatment to new immigrants following their release from the Department of Homeland Security.\nBy promoting self-sufficiency, the Destination Reception Services Program will take pressure off states, localities, and non-profit emergency providers and free up public resources for everyone. Access to shelter, housing, workforce development, and other support services will allow our neighbors and communities to thrive.\n“Immigrants come to the United States in search of safety and refuge, many of them fleeing from dangerous conditions in their home countries and making arduous journeys,” said Representative Meng. “Our immigration system needs the resources to process and receive all the people who come here in humane and orderly ways. This increasingly includes the work of local and state government agencies as well as non-profit organizations, like those in my home state of New York, which serve individuals who are navigating the immigration process.\n“The Destination Reception Assistance Act would ensure that the federal government is doing its part to support communities welcoming immigrants and providing them with temporary housing, legal aid, job training, and other help they may need. I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this long-overdue legislation to make our immigration system more orderly, efficient, and welcoming.”\nThe Destination Reception Assistance Act would establish in the Office of Refugee Resettlement a new Destination Reception Services Program New Arrival Services Board and authorize a grant program to provide funding for medium-term services to asylum seekers and parolees, including noncustodial housing services, rental and utility assistance, and workforce development services. The New Arrival Services Board would award competitive grants and federal block grants to communities that provide eligible services to asylum seekers and parolees. Communities receiving funding through federal block grants would be eligible to receive $1 of federal funding for every $1 of non-federal funding.\nNEW SCHOOL BUILDINGS OPENED:\nBuildings Include More Than 11,000 New Seats, Modern Classrooms,\nInnovative Learning and Community Spaces, Advanced Technology\nAdministration Opens Most New K-12 Seats in Two Decades\nDetails on Each New Building Available Online\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams, New York City Public Schools Chancellor David Banks, and New York City School Construction Authority (SCA) President and CEO Nina Kubota announced the completion and opening of 24 new school buildings, including 11,010 new seats, across the city, each set to welcome students for the first day of the 2024-2025 school year. This marks the most new K-12 seats opened by the SCA since 2003 and comes in addition to over 20,000 student seats previously added over the course of the Adams administration. Additionally, the newly adopted 2025-2029 Capital Plan provides funding for another 33,417 seats. This significant expansion will provide students with state-of-the-art facilities and resources essential for their continued academic success and overall development.\n“Our administration is committed to giving our children a first-class education, and a crucial part of a great education is having access to great facilities,” said Mayor Adams. “The 24 new buildings we’re opening ahead of this school year — with the most K-12 seats the city has opened in two decades — will provide 11,000 additional students with seats and set our children and our communities up for success. With modern and flexible spaces, state-of-the-art technology, science labs, music rooms, sensory gyms, and more, these new schools are going to be incredible spaces for students and staff alike, will play a crucial role in fostering a sense of well-being for our children, and will help us build a safer, more affordable, and more livable city.”\n“School buildings are the physical representation of the investment we make in our children and our city as we cultivate the next generation of leaders,” said Public Schools Chancellor Banks. “These new buildings will provide 11,000 new classroom seats, creating more space for bright starts and bold futures. We are truly grateful to our partners at SCA and City Hall for standing alongside us in this vital effort to expand opportunities for our students.”\n“The SCA’s mission has always been to create and maintain safe, nurturing, and inspiring learning environments. These new schools are more than just buildings; they are vibrant, dynamic spaces where young minds can explore, create, and grow,” said SCA President and CEO Kubota. “They also underscore the SCA’s dedication to providing equitable access to quality education for all New York City children, highlighting the importance of investing in educational infrastructure as a foundation for student success.”\nNew school buildings have been completed in four boroughs, with six in Queens, nine in Brooklyn, eight in the Bronx, and one in Manhattan. With a commitment to fostering an enriching educational environment, the new school buildings feature modern classrooms, advanced technology, and versatile learning spaces to ensure that they meet the diverse needs of New York City’s student population. They are also constructed with green spaces and environmentally-friendly materials, promoting sustainability and environmental stewardship. Key features of the new school buildings include:\nInnovative Learning Spaces – Classrooms equipped with the latest educational technology, flexible space and furniture, and collaborative workspaces, including:\nReading and speech resource rooms\nArt and music classrooms\nScience lab and prep rooms\nSpecial education classrooms\nLibraries\nGymnasiums and auditoriums\nCommunity Integration – Multi-purpose spaces designed to serve students, staff, and the surrounding community, fostering stronger community ties and support networks, including:\nMedical, guidance counselor, and administrative suites\nParent and community rooms\nIndoor and outdoor play spaces\nStaff lunch and conference rooms\nSCA will continue to invest in creating new seats, not only in areas of current overcrowding and projected growth, but also to help schools comply with state legislation requiring smaller class sizes. SCA will also continue its work promoting healthier school environments, advocating for better health and nutrition, and broadening opportunities for physical education, as well as investing in existing infrastructure to provide better facilities for New York City’s students, teachers, and staff.\nAs part of SCA’s Public Art for Public Schools Program, 21 new, site-specific pieces of artwork were installed in the new buildings this year by artists Afruz Amighi, Julia Whitney Barnes, Joell Baxter, Joe Bochynski, Chris Bogia, Deborah Czeresko, Dennis Redmoon Darkeem, Delano Dunn, Ghost of a Dream, Taraneh Hemami, Johannah Herr, Wendy Letven, Diana Sofia Lozano, Katherine Tzu-Lan Mann, Tijay Mohammed, John O’ Connor, Jason Rohlf, Sarah Sharp, Pranav Sood, Kirsten Kay Thoen, and Marela Zacarias. The pieces were created using a wide range of materials, including hand-blown glass, porcelain enamel, ceramic tile, metal, lenticular and vitreous glass, cast resin, acrylic, powder-coated aluminum and steel, painted and printed glass, c-prints, stone, and found objects. Images are available online.\n“Education opened every door for me, and now I am a proud champion of the largest school system in the nation,” said New York State Assemblymember Jenifer Rajkumar. “Working with Mayor Adams, we have made unprecedented investments in education, and I passed the historic Diwali School Holiday bill so that our children could celebrate the day without missing school. Today we embark upon a new school year with 24 new school buildings to accommodate over 11,000 young scholars—in addition to the 20,000 seats we have already built in this administration. I am proud to partner with the mayor, Chancellor Banks, and SCA President and CEO Kubota, providing them the resources from the state to continue building more schools and meet the educational needs of all our children.”\n35 NEW HYDROPONICS CLASSROOMS:\nNY Sun Works Executive Director Manuela Zamora congratulates the city’s school children returning to class and announced the opening of 35 new hydroponic labs, bringing the total number of NYC public schools equipped with NY Sun Works Hydroponic Classrooms to 350 and students reached to over 130,000.\n“Today, we wish every student a successful academic year. At NY Sun Works, we are especially proud that more students will return to schools equipped with a NY Sun Works Hydroponic Classroom. Thirty-five new labs are opening today across the five boroughs, providing K-12 students hands-on learning through urban farming. We are also proud to serve more special education students and English Language Learners this school year. Our commitment to inclusivity is unwavering, which is why we are bringing our innovative technology and curriculum to students of diverse backgrounds.”\n“A sustainable future begins in the classroom. Together with our NYC public school partners, we are cultivating the next generation of scientists empowered to create solutions to global climate challenges. We wish everyone a fantastic school year filled with curiosity and discovery!”\nBelow is a list of all 35 schools where labs will open in Queens this fall: PS71 Forest, PS/IS 78, PS 131 Abigail Adams, PS 144 Col. Jeromus Remsen, Q400 August Martin HS, Q585 Maspeth HS. NY Sun Works is a not-for-profit organization that builds Hydroponic Classrooms in city schools to teach the science of sustainability through urban farming. “Through our comprehensive curriculum, we engage K-12th grade students and educators in hands-on, standards-based sustainability and climate education. We are dedicated to bringing high-quality education to the communities where it’s most needed and envision a generation of environmental innovators, empowered to create solutions to 21st-century climate challenges. Our first Hydroponic Classroom opened in 2010; today, we’re partnered with over 350 schools and reach over 130,000 students annually in New York City and the metro area.”\nMAJOR SCHOOL INVESTMENTS: As students and guardians prepare for another exciting school year, Assemblywoman Nily Rozic (D,WF-Fresh Meadows) is back with another round of funding announcements for our local schools. This year, Assemblywoman Rozic allocated a collective $745,000 in state funding to three schools in education District 25 and District 26.\nThroughout the year, students and faculty will start to notice upgrades and improvements to their buildings starting with P4Q@179 which received a $175,000 grant to renovate the school’s auditorium.\nM.S.74 received $320,000 to upgrade their declining Public Announcement system, and students at P.S. 213 will soon enjoy a completely remodeled and enhanced library thanks to a $250,000 state funded grant.\nP4Q is a District 75 multi-site school which provides highly specialized instructional support for students with special needs in various locations.\nP.S.179 in Fresh Meadows houses a P4Q program, this grant is intended to serve all the students who occupy the building including P.S. 179 students and the entire P4Q multi-site student body. New window and stage curtains will be installed in the next couple of weeks followed shortly after by upgrades to the lighting, audio, and visual equipment.\nM.S.74 requested funding to replace the public announcement (PA) system which was malfunctioning throughout the building. Hallway and classroom speakers will be upgraded so students and faculty can clearly and loudly hear announcements, bells, and drills. Installation of this new system will begin next month.\nLastly, P.S. 213 received a grant of $250,000 to renovate the school library replete with new furniture, a new paint job, and supplies. This project is slated for completion before the end of year. The library, a high traffic area in the heart of the school, had not been renovated in decades and was in dire need of modernization.\n“Every year I work with the school community to identify how we can improve the buildings that shape our youth and where they spend most of their time,” said Assemblywoman Nily Rozic. “This year I am honored to allocate state funding to PQ4@179, M.S. 74, and P.S.213 for their diverse needs. Modernizing communal spaces in these buildings and providing a new state-of-the art PA system will allow students to foster creativity, confidence, imagination, and maintain safety and order in these respective schools.”\n“We are so grateful to Assemblywoman Nily Rozic for this grant that will enable the much-needed upgrades to our auditorium. These improvements will significantly enhance our students’ learning experiences and provide a better environment for our school events. We thank Assemblywoman Rozic for her continued support to the P4Q school community,” said P4Q Principal Dr. Denise D’Anna.\n“Middle School 74 is thrilled to announce that thanks to the generous support of Assemblywoman Nily Rozic, we have secured the funding necessary to upgrade our public address and clock system. These vital improvements will enhance communication capabilities throughout our school, ensuring the safety and well-being of our students and staff,” said M.S. 74 Principal Brandon Contarsy. “Effective communication is essential for maintaining a safe and orderly learning environment. Our outdated systems were hindering our ability to quickly disseminate important information during emergencies or routine announcements. With the new upgrades, we will be able to promptly alert everyone to potential threats, provide timely updates on school closures or delays, and share important announcements.”\n“We are deeply grateful to Assemblywoman Nily Rozic for her generous support in funding our library renovations. Her commitment to enhancing community resources will have a lasting impact, ensuring our library continues to serve as a vibrant space for learning and connection at The Carl Ullman School,” said P.S. 213 Interim Principal Odalis Dejesus.\nP4Q operates at seven different sites throughout Queens and serves students from pre-kindergarten to grade eight. The P4Q@179 location is on Peck Avenue in Fresh Meadows. P.S. 213 is located on 67th Avenue in Bayside and serves pre-kindergarten to grade five. M.S. 74 is located on Oceania Street in Oakland Gardens and serves students from grade six to grade eight. Additional community investments recently announced by Rozic include $125,000 to upgrade the community center at the Chinese-American Planning Council in Flushing and $50,000 for senior wellness programming at the Selfhelp NORC in Fresh Meadows. Rozic also attended a ribbon cutting at P.S.162 before summer break to celebrate upgrades to their auditorium on account of her state allocated $250,000 grant.\n***CRIME BLOTTER***\nFATAL DRIVE-BY SHOOTING IN WOODHAVEN:\nDefendant Allegedly Fired at Victim While Driving;\nFaces up to 25 Years to Life if Convicted\nQueens District Attorney Melinda Katz announced that Johnathan Rice was indicted by a grand jury and arraigned on one charge of murder in the second degree for the 2018 shooting death of 35-year-old Frank Snyder, a rapper and party promoter known as “Hollywood Play.” Snyder was fatally struck outside the Tavern Lounge in Woodhaven, where he was hosting an event for a friend’s birthday.\nDistrict Attorney Katz said: “My office does not give up on cases. After a long-term investigation, we secured an indictment charging Johnathan Rice with the senseless 2018 murder of Frank Snyder. The defendant is alleged to have fatally shot the victim as he stood outside a Woodhaven bar where he worked as a promoter. I thank my prosecutors and the NYPD members who diligently investigated this cold-case homicide.”\nRice, 43, of 178th Street in Jamaica, was arraigned on an indictment charging him with murder in the second degree.\nSupreme Court Justice Kenneth Holder ordered the defendant to return to court on November 14. If convicted, he faces up to 25 years to life in prison.\nAccording to the charges:\n- On October 7, 2018, at approximately 3:15 a.m., video surveillance showed Snyder, 35, and a group of individuals standing outside the Tavern Lounge at 97-07 Jamaica Avenue in Woodhaven.\n- A black sedan can be observed on video drive by the entrance of the bar, with multiple muzzle flashes coming from the front passenger side window before the car sped off.\n- Snyder, who was the only one hit by the gunfire, fell to the ground. He was taken to a local hospital with a gunshot wound to his left torso and left thigh and died from his injuries.\n- Motor vehicle registration records showed that Rice owned a black Lexus that matched the description of the car seen on video.\nDuring the investigation, cell phone records for Rice were obtained that placed him in the vicinity of the Tavern Lounge at the time of the shooting.\n***\nWOMAN FATALLY STABBED IN FLUSHING:\nCouncilmember Sandra Ung issued the following statement regarding the recent murder of a woman in Flushing in an apparent domestic violence incident:\n“I was deeply shocked and heartbroken by the tragic incident that took place yesterday in Flushing, where a woman was allegedly brutally stabbed and killed by her husband at her place of work. My thoughts and prayers are with the victim’s family, friends, and co-workers during this incredibly difficult time. This tragedy is a stark reminder of the devastating impact of domestic violence, an issue that is often shrouded in silence within our Asian community. As an attorney, I worked with domestic violence survivors in the Asian community. I know that too many victims suffer in silence, unable to speak out due to cultural stigmas and fear of shame, or they are unaware of where to find help or worry that their language barriers will prevent them from getting the support they need. I urge anyone facing domestic violence to reach out and seek help. No one should have to stay in a situation where they are being harmed because they do not know where to turn. Our community must come together to prevent such tragedies from occurring again. We must support those in need, speak out against violence, and ensure that every person knows they have a place to go for help.”\nDEMANDS ACTION ON ROOSEVELT AVE:\nHiram Monserrate, Democratic District Leader (35th A.D.) held a press conference on Thursday September 5, at the corner of 91st Street and Elmhurst Avenue (90-20 Elmhurst Ave.). His announcement was entitled “Community Under Siege Demands Action on Roosevelt Avenue”. Monserrate released the following statement: “The recent revelations by the NY Post have again brought light to the plight endured by the residents and the small business owners of the Roosevelt Avenue corridor which traverses through Corona, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights. The Roosevelt Avenue Corridor is under criminal siege and a total sense of lawlessness abounds. The City is not in control of Roosevelt Avenue, it is currently under the command of various organized crime entities, drug rings, human traffickers, pimps, prostitutes, shoplifting syndicates, illegal marijuana shops, and hundreds upon hundreds of unlicensed street vendors.”\nHIGH-QUALITY CHILD CARE MADE MORE ACCESSIBLE:\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams and leadership of the New York City Council announced a historic joint effort to strengthen early childhood education across the five boroughs and address longstanding systemic issues, while boosting enrollment and connecting families with more Pre-K and 3-K seats. The strategic plan — developed by an unprecedented joint Adams administration-Council working group, chaired by Deputy Mayor for Strategic Initiatives Ana J. Almanzar and Speaker Adams — will be anchored by $100 million in new city investment allocated in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Adopted Budget to implement an action-oriented roadmap for outreach and seat allocation across the city. With the new $100 million investment, the total investment in the FY25 city budget for early childhood education is $3 billion, comprised of $2 billion for early childhood education programming for children aged zero to five and approximately $1 billion for preschool special education.\nIn the two months since the budget was announced and voted on, New York City Public Schools added more than 1,500 additional 3-K seats in high-demand areas of the city to support families for the 2024-2025 school year. Since May 2024, New York City Public Schools has continued to drive down waitlists — reaching 100 percent of families who applied before the application deadline with first-round offers by mid-August. The Adams administration’s joint effort with the City Council will strengthen the city’s early childhood education system to better allocate resources and connect families with seats.\n“All families deserve to live in a city with a safe, nurturing, and affordable place to leave their children, while being given the opportunity to pursue their dreams,” said Mayor Adams. “Access to affordable child care is one of the largest drivers of economic mobility, especially for women. That’s why our administration has delivered an expanded and more equitable early childhood education program, and, with this plan, we are presenting our vision for how to strengthen it even further into the future. Despite early childhood applications more than tripling from five years ago, there has been a 350 percent increase in families receiving offers. This year alone, 100 percent of families that applied on time have received an early childhood offer. But we know there is work to be done. That’s why we have invested $100 million in this historic plan with the City Council to fix lingering systemic problems and usher in a new and improved program. Our plan focuses on better allocating resources to meet needs, conducting robust family outreach, supporting providers, and expanding access for students with disabilities, as well as undocumented families. Every day, we will continue to build a city focused on supporting working-class people, that is safer, more prosperous, more affordable, and, most importantly, that invests in our children. I thank Speaker Adams and our partners on the Council for helping to deliver a better product for New York families.”\nDespite inheriting major structural challenges, particularly associated with a mismatch in available seats to demand, the Adams administration has been committed to improving the city’s early childhood education system. Under the leadership of Mayor Adams, early childhood enrollment is at the highest level ever, with over 150,000 children across New York City’s early childhood system. This includes children in New York City Public Schools, as well as programs run by the New York City Administration for Children’s Services and the New York City Human Resources Administration, speaking to how the city is serving families in early childhood education across a range of agencies, programs, and services. For the first-time ever, 3-K has been made available in every school district with more families applying and getting seats than ever-before. is at the highest it has ever been, with over 53,000 available seats across the New York City Public Schools system— an increase of approximately 17 percent in 3-K capacity since the onset of the Adams administration.\nRecently, the Adams administration announced the appointment of Simone C. Hawkins as New York City Public Schools’ new deputy chancellor of Early Childhood Education. To continue building on this success and accomplish a comprehensive re-imagining of the early childhood education system in New York City, the Adams administration and the City Council have created a 10-point plan that will be executed by New York City Public Schools, the Mayor’s Office of Child Care and Early Childhood Education and multiple city agencies, in partnership with the Council.\nBILL: FREE BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER:\nOnly 8 States Provide Universal School Meals: California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, and Vermont\nU.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand recently stood at M400 High School for Environmental Studies in NYC to advocate for the passage of the Universal School Meals Program Act, which would provide free breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack to all schoolchildren regardless of income. The bill would also expand access to free meals over the summer and eliminate school meal debt. She was joined by NYS Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas, CEO of Hunger Free America Joel Berg, Senior Executive Director of the NYCDOE Office of Food and Nutrition Services Chris Tricarico, and M400 High School for Environmental Studies staff.\n“In the richest country on earth, it is unacceptable that millions of kids go hungry each day. The Universal School Meals Program Act would provide funding for free breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack for students who need them and slash burdensome red tape for school administrators,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This bill would make our families and communities healthier and stronger, keep kids in school, and work to fight the stigma too often associated with meal programs. I’m proud that New York City is leading the charge in providing universal school meals, and I look forward to passing this critical legislation so every child in the United States has the food they need to succeed.”\n“We cannot teach hungry children. But the reality is that there is a food insecurity crisis across our nation and here in New York one in six children confront hunger. I’m proud to carry the universal school meals bill in the New York State Assembly and that we successfully secured $135 million in our last budget to cover 86% of students. However, achieving universal school meals and combating hunger must be a national priority so I am pleased to stand with Senator Gillibrand in calling for the passage of her Universal School Meals Program Act with Representative Ilhan Omar. We are one of the wealthiest nations in the world and it is our responsibility to care for our students. This legislation will help us to do so and should be passed and funded immediately,” said Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas.\nFree school meals are associated with a variety of positive outcomes, including improved attendance rates and school performance, fewer behavioral incidents, lower suspension rates, better health outcomes, and reduced financial stress for students and families. Research shows that for every dollar spent in the United States on school food, more than two dollars are earned in human health and economic benefits annually. The return on investment in student nutrition helps support schools, kids, communities, and the economy.\nThe Universal School Meals Program Act would:\n- Permanently provide free breakfast, lunch, and dinner to all schoolchildren regardless of income and put an end to burdensome application paperwork that poses a barrier to enrollment in meal programs.\n- Increase the reimbursement rates for school authorities participating in the food and nutrition programs to more accurately reflect the true cost of providing meals.\n- Reduce stigma associated with meal programs by eliminating meal debt and prohibiting school food authorities from discriminating against or overtly identifying a child participating in the free meal program.\n- Expand the summer food service program and Summer EBT program by making all children eligible to participate in the programs. Currently, only communities where 50 percent of children are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch can operate a summer meals program; the Universal School Meals Program Act would make all communities eligible regardless of income.\nSenator Gillibrand has long supported childhood nutrition. She leads the bipartisan MODERN WIC Act, which would make WIC benefits more accessible to low-income families by allowing them to certify and recertify for WIC services remotely. She also leads the bipartisan Summer Meals Act, which would provide meals to children and teens in low-income areas during the summer months when school is not in session.\nHISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH AT QPL: Queens Public Library announces Hispanic Heritage Month at QPL: Community Art Exhibit, Author Talks, Music and More!

This project will improve the greenway along the Cross Island Parkway, and most importantly, will begin the process of removing the unpopular jersey barriers along Northern Boulevard with a full redesign.

I am grateful for Council Member Moya, for always showing up for our communities and partnering with the East Elmhurst-Corona Civic Association. I want to thank the partners for making our wrap-up event possible, as well as my board members and the volunteers for doing all they do for our families and seniors, and Southern Baptist Church for all they do to bring such events to their church,” said Larinda Hooks, President of the East Elmhurst-Corona Civic Association.\nThis initiative is part of Councilman Moya’s ongoing commitment to ensuring students have the necessary tools they need to succeed in the upcoming academic year.
