Elijah DeWitt, an 18-year-old football player at Jefferson High School who had already garnered recognition from NFL quarterback Cam Newton, was shot and killed Oct. 5, 2022, in the parking lot of a Dave & Buster's at Sugarloaf Mall, located in Lawrenceville, a suburb about 30 miles... -\nSVB collapse: Bank fallout shines spotlight on $620 billion hole in banking sector\nFallout from the Silicon Valley Bank collapse has directed attention to a $620 billion ticking time bomb in the banking system that has the potential to spell doom for the financial system. SVB's meltdown was partly caused by a chasm between its assets and what they were worth in the market. Eventually, SVB sold some of those assets, spooking investors and triggering a run on the bank. But SVB isn't alone, as banks across the United States were sitting on $620 billion in unrealized potential losses at the end of last year, per the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That hole... -\nHow Biden's New Washing Machine Regulations Could Ruin Laundry Day\nWhen Cincinnati firefighter Ed Wallace bought a high efficiency Whirlpool washing machine, he came to regret the decision almost immediately. The machine used less water—not enough to clean Wallace's work clothes—and his colleagues at the firehouse quickly took notice. \"I walked past my guys and they say, 'Dude, you stink!'\" Wallace said. \"I smelled myself, and yeah, that's me stinking.\" Now, President Joe Biden is pushing regulations that could force Wallace's stinky situation upon millions of Americans. Biden's Energy Department last month proposed new efficiency standards for washing machines that would require new appliances to use considerably less water, all... -\nThe recent Kadyrov-Putin face to face clown show -- 45 second video\nThese guys should be in Vaudeville. Both are sickly looking, but not defenestrated, yet. -\nFeds knew for years fentanyl-tainted pills from Mexican pharmacies were killing Americans\nOfficials at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and State Department have known for more than three years that some pharmacies in Mexico are selling counterfeit medications laced with illicit fentanyl — and that American tourists are overdosing and dying from them. A California medical examiner first alerted federal authorities in the spring of 2019, when 29-year-old Brennan Harrell died of a fentanyl overdose after he and a friend bought pills at a drug store in Cabo San Lucas. Afterward, his parents said, they cooperated with the DEA during a months-long investigation they say ended with the agency promising to take... -\nPeople Are Ordering Catering Instead of Groceries to Save Money. Is It Really Cheaper?\nThe internet is divided over people ordering catering from chains like Chipotle to hack their weekly meal prep. We crunched the numbers. In a TikTok video from January, fashion influencer Madi Webb unboxes an enormous catering delivery from a nearby Brazilian restaurant. “I feel like I just cracked the code,” she says, explaining that the order of chicken and veggies cost only $100 for a week of lunches. Since then, all over social media, people like Webb are claiming they’re ordering catering from local restaurants and big chains to hack their weekly meal prep. They take the food home, portion... -\nJoe Biden Calls Florida Barring Transgender Procedures on Children ‘Close to Sinful’ in ‘Daily Show’ Interview\nPresident Joe Biden (D) has blasted Florida’s rule barring hormone therapy, sex change surgery, and other irreversible transgender procedures on children, calling the state’s action “close to sinful” during an appearance on Comedy Central’s The Daily Show. Biden sat down with Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle star Kal Penn, who served as guest host for the episode set to air Monday. In a sneak preview clip, Penn, who worked in the Obama administration, asked Biden what the federal government can do for LGBTQ children, “especially transgender kids who are dealing with all these regressive state laws that are... -\nOut-Dated Covid Travel Rules Defended [semi-satire]\nThe continued refusal to allow the world's top-ranked tennis player Novak Djokovic to enter the US to play in the Miami Open tournament defies common sense. The hang-up is that he hasn't received a covid vaccine. The current scientific evidence indicates that (1) the vaccines are not effective in preventing infection or transmission of the virus, (2) Djokovic has already had and recovered from the disease, which means he has natural immunity that is as good as or better than any vaccine-induced resistance to the disease, and (3) vaccination is not required for the millions who have illegally entered the... -\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) Explains How the Federal Reserve Enabled Silicon Valley Bank's Failure\nAs America's economic turmoil continues to spread fear among consumers and depositors, U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) took to Twitter to explain how the clumsy hand of government — specifically the Federal Reserve — enabled both the \"malfeasance\" and \"failure\" of Silicon Valley Bank. First, Massie explained the Fed's role as \"Santa Claus\" by setting and keeping interest rates \"artificially low\" for years. That spurred economic growth and \"nudged\" those with cash to spend into venture capital which in turn necessitated an institution like Silicon Valley Bank. Let’s review the Federal Reserve Bank’s many roles, & how each of them... -\nIs Biden Trying to Overthrow Netanyahu?\nThe ongoing demonstrations in Tel Aviv and other parts of Israel are about more than just opposing the specific policies that make up the government’s judicial reform package. They are about removing from power Benjamin Netanyahu, whom protesters say is a dictator and a criminal who cannot legitimately hold the office of prime minister.And according to some Israeli and American officials, those domestic opponents bent on overthrowing Netanyahu are being fueled by money from the US Administration of President Joe Biden.Last week US Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) charged Biden and the Democratic Party with “trying to sabotage Netanyahu.”Citing a report... -\nMilitia Training and Education Books Collection (Vast Collection of FREE pdf Manuals for Download)\nIf you are able and over the age of 18 in the US, you are a member of the Constitutional (Part II) Militia.

Video shared by Fox News reporter Bill Melugin showed the 'bilateral show of force' on the border, which included armed security forces in riot gear, barbed wire, concrete blocks and mesh fence on the Paso Del Norte Bridge. It was shared hours after different footage showed hordes of migrants charging past a line of Mexican officials at the border between Juarez, Mexico, and El Paso, Texas. Photos captured the... -\nCNN Edits Out Oscar Winner's Slap At Don Lemon For His 'Past Her Prime' Insult\nIn a transparent attempt to protect beleaguered co-host Don Lemon, CNN This Morning committed very flagrant bias by omission. At last night's Oscars ceremony, Best Actress winner Michelle Yeoh, 60, capped her acceptance speech by saying [video]: \"Ladies, don't let anybody tell you you are ever past your prime.\" Yeoh's statement was a clear slap at Don Lemon. CNN recently suspended Lemon and subjected him to sensitivity training for having insisted that Nikki Haley, 51, \"isn't in her prime.\"But in CNN This Morning's Oscars coverage today, the show cut out the part of Yeoh's speech in which she uttered her... -\nTrump claims Biden win would cause depression despite economists forecast (2020)\nOctober 2020 Trump; \"The policies of the left would unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions,\" Mr. Trump said, claiming that a Democratic win would lead to sharply higher taxes and \"destroy our country.\" \"We will go into depression,\" the president said. -\nJohn Travolta Gets Choked Up Introducing Emotional 2023 Oscars 'In Memoriam' Tribute Featuring Lenny Kravitz\nGone but not forgotten.

Federal prosecutors said that to secure the loan for the $1.3 million home in Paramus, Whitehead, 44, made it appear that an LLC he controlled had an average balance of more than $2 million when the account actually held less than $10. Government officials said he also applied for a $250,000 business loan for the LLC based on fraudulent information, per the New York Post. Whitehead, who has ties to New York City Mayor Eric... -\nPutin's nemesis 'poisoned in jail and is close to death' (ex-pres. of Georgia)\n<p>Mikheil Saakashvili, who was leader of Georgia’s pro-Western government when Russia invaded in 2008, said his weight has almost halved in recent weeks.</p><p>He was recently transferred from prison, where he’s been serving time since 2018 for alleged corruption and abuse of power, to a secure clinic.</p>\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected!
