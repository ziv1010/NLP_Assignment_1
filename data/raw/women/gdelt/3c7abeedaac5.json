  "body_text": "Football legend David Beckham has opened up about his mental health condition in a new and upcoming tell-all documentary. Titled ‘BECKHAM,’ the docu-series reveals an \"unfiltered story of one of the most celebrated and scrutinized athletes of all time\".\nNetflix gave a glimpse of the show at the Edinburgh TV Festival last month, The Mirror reports. Now, an official trailer has dropped and the date fans can expect to tune in.\nIn preview clips, David seemingly opens up about his obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In the footage he can be seen cleaning and tidying his family home every single night, even cutting used wicks from the his and wife Victoria Beckham's candle collection.\nHe goes on to share his pet peeves when sorting out the family's sprawling Cotswolds home, admitting he dislikes a 'messy house'. The former England captain is also filmed cleaning the kitchen so it is spotless before he goes to bed.\n\"It’s tiring going round every single candle cleaning it, clipping the wick,\" he told the interviewer. \"I clip the candle wicks. I clean the glass. That’s my pet hate, the smoke around the inside of the candle. I know it’s weird.\"\nDavid has spoken in the past about his compulsions. In an ITV interview in 2006 he said: \"I've got this obsessive compulsive disorder where I have to have everything in a straight line or everything has to be in pairs. I'll put my Pepsi cans in the fridge and if there's one too many then I'll put it in another cupboard somewhere.\"\nIn the four-part series, coming out October 4, David also touches on his humble working-class upbringing in East London, his notorious England game red card and falling in love with his future wife, Posh Spice. Fellow football icons such as Alex Ferguson and Rio Ferdinand also appear in the documentary.\nWhat is OCD?\nAccording to the NHS, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours. OCD can affect men, women and children. People can start having symptoms from as early as six years old, but it often begins around puberty and early adulthood.\nOCD can be distressing and significantly interfere with your life, but treatment can help you keep it under control. If you think a friend or family member may have OCD, try talking to them about your concerns and suggest they get help. It's unlikely OCD will get better without proper treatment and support.\nSymptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder:\nIf you have OCD, you'll usually experience frequent obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours.\n- An obsession is an unwanted and unpleasant thought, image or urge that repeatedly enters your mind, causing feelings of anxiety, disgust or unease.\n- A compulsion is a repetitive behaviour or mental act that you feel you need to do to temporarily relieve the unpleasant feelings brought on by the obsessive thought.\nFor example, someone with an obsessive fear of being burgled may feel they need to check all the windows and doors are locked several times before they can leave their house.",
