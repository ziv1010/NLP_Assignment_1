  "body_text": "The scoreline perhaps wasn’t reflective of the balance of play at Meadow Park on Tuesday night.\nDespite just beating FC Twente by a one-goal margin in the UEFA Women’s Champions League, it was one-way traffic for most of the night as we went about searching for a second.\nIn the end, it was Mead’s 10th-minute curler that sent us up to seventh in the standings with nine points from five games.\n“I thought we dominated the game,” she said. “I think they started off really well. Twente are a very good team. They defended very, very well as well.\n“It was nice to get the goal in the first half. We played some good football, but didn't quite have that ruthless edge to get a few more, which we probably could have done a little bit better tonight.”\nAsked if attack can be the best form of defence, as we restricted Twente to very few real chances, Mead added: “I think so. I think our reaction off the ball when we lost it, we got round it quickly, we won it back quickly and then they found it really hard to get into their game plan.\n“Credit to us, credit to the girls getting round the ball and the energy. That helped us within the game.\n“Obviously it's been a little bit of a rollercoaster so far [in the Champions League], but again, that win tonight has put us in a good position and we've got three more points to get. Hopefully it'll put us in an even better position going forward.”\nLastly, we quizzed Mead on the novelty of Saturday’s trip to Goodison Park - our first ever WSL match there against Everton.\n“It’s a very historic, cool stadium,” she said. “I’m looking forward to being able to play there in front of our fans and hopefully getting three points again.”\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
