  "body_text": "Manchester United Women has added another winter window signing to the books as they look to reinforce for the second half of the campaign. On Thursday, the club announced the signing of Sweden international Ellen Wangerheim, joining from Hammarby IF.\nUnited Women sign forward Ellen Wangerheim\nWangerheim, 21, made more than 100 appearances for the Swedish club, winning a league and cup double in 2023, and helped them qualify for the UEFA Women’s Champions League proper. She played against United back in August in Stockholm, where the Reds won 1-0.\nThe new Red forward also made her international debut in 2025 after playing for the Sweden youth national teams from 2021-2023.\n“I am so excited. It feels amazing to be here. It’s a huge club with big history,” Wangerheim said in the club press release. “So sitting here in this shirt is a proud moment for me. It’s always been my dream to move abroad and to play in another country, in Europe and in a really big football club.”\nWangerheim joins Hanna Lundkvist and Lea Schuller as the latest transfers in a busy winter period for the club, boosting an underperforming front line as the Reds look to push for European qualification again on top of mounting a charge in knockout competitions, including the Champions League knockout stages for the first time in United’s history.",
