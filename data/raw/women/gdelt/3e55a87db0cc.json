  "body_text": "According to data from FIFA, the transactions carried out in January 2025 provided Portuguese clubs with a profit equivalent to 169.5 million euros (ME), the fourth largest, surpassed only by the French (357.3 ME), German (217.7 ME) and English (175.3 ME).\nDespite being one of the countries that signed the highest number of players, Portugal was only the 12th biggest spender in this transfer window, with 38.7 million euros, a long way behind England, which heads the list with a total of 599.3 million euros.\nWith more than double that of Germany, the second country that spent the most money (285.1 ME), the English teams were mainly responsible for the record registered in the 'winter market' of 2025, which recorded revenue of 2.26 thousand ME.\nThis value exceeded the previous maximum by 47.1% (1.54 thousand ME, established in January 2023) and represents a growth of 57.9% compared to 2024, corresponding to the number of players transferred, which totalled 5,863, 942 more than last year (19.1%), also a new record.\nPortuguese clubs also made an important contribution to that result, as they were the third most active, having signed 207 football players, a number that was only surpassed by Brazil (471) and Argentina (265).\nPortugal drops to fifth place in FIFA's study in terms of player departures, with 170 leaving Portuguese clubs, in a parameter led by Argentina (255), followed by Brazil (212) and England (211).\nIn women's professional football, there were also new highs, both in the overall amount that clubs spent to retouch their squads, which reached 5.55 ME (an increase of 180.6% compared to 2024), and in the number of athletes involved (455, 22.6% more).\nAs happened in the men's sector, England clearly leads the list of the biggest spending countries, with around half of the total (2.21 ME), with the United States being the biggest beneficiary, receiving 2.65 ME, while Portugal did not contribute to this statistic.",
