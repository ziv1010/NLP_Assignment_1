Paramount+ has at its disposal an impressive library of past and current blockbuster movies as well as new shows that are perfect viewing for Halloween. The Viacom-owned streamer is a treasure trove for anyone interested in not just quick scares, but also entertainment, sports, and pop culture.\nSome of the highlights of the October 2023 Paramount+ programming schedule include the series reboot of Frasier with Kelsey Grammer, the horror prequel Pet Sematary: Bloodlines with David Duchovny, the sweeping historical drama mini-series Fellow Travelers with Matt Bomer and Jonathan Bailey, and the premiere of the late William Friedkin‘s final film, The Caine Mutiny Court Martial.
