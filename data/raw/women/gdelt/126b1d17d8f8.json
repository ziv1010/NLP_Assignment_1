We’ve done the work for you with some betting trends, key stats and historical facts about all 68 teams in the men’s NCAA Tournament.\nAdvertisement\nWe teased out trends like which teams are on a run, which teams are ending tourney droughts and which teams have been hot against the spread. While what follows is a thoroughly researched piece with something useful on each team, this is meant to provide a broad view of the tournament field, with a bit of a betting slant, in an easily digestible format. This is not a super in-depth breakdown of the teams.\nHere’s the deeper stuff from our college basketball writers and experts:\n- Preview capsules on all 68 teams in the field\n- The 10 most likely first-round upsets\n- CJ Moore’s bracket picks\n- Everything to know about the women’s NCAA Tournament\nWe also have printable brackets for both the men’s tournament and the women’s tournament.\nFind the best ticket deals on StubHub to see your favorite team.\nEAST\nNo. 1 UConn vs. No. 16 Stetson\nUConn Huskies (31-3, 18-2 Big East)\nIt’s easy to say nice things about the Huskies, who are not only the defending national champions but also the top overall seed in this tourney and the top-rated team on KenPom. This year’s team plays slower than last year’s, ranking outside the top 300 in tempo. The Huskies were the underdog once this season, for a Dec. 1 loss at Kansas.\nStetson Hatters (22-12, 11-5 ASun)\nThis is a debut tournament appearance for the Hatters. Coach Donnie Jones was an assistant to Billy Donovan when Florida won back-to-back national titles in 2006 and 2007. Stetson has won nine of its last 11 games.\nNo. 8 Florida Atlantic vs. No. 9 Northwestern\nFlorida Atlantic Owls (25-8, 14-4 AAC)\nAfter making the Final Four last year, the Owls are back. All five starters from the Final Four game against San Diego State returned to FAU this season. The record isn’t as pretty as last year’s, but this team has wins against Butler, Texas A&M, Virginia Tech and Arizona. The Owls had never made the NCAA Tournament until 2022 but have now been three times in a row.\nNorthwestern Wildcats (21-11, 12-8 Big Ten)\nNorthwestern has never been to consecutive NCAA Tournaments before. This is only the third appearance for the Wildcats ever, all coming since 2017 under Chris Collins. The Wildcats are 2-0 in the first round. Graduate guard Boo Buie is the program’s all-time leading scorer with more than 2,000 career points.\nAdvertisement\nNo. 5 San Diego State vs. No. 12 UAB\nSan Diego State Aztecs (24-10, 11-7 MWC)\nLast year’s runner-up brought back just two starters from the national title game but is dancing for the fourth straight year. The Aztecs made the Mountain West final but have not exactly set the world on fire recently. SDSU is 4-4 in its last eight and 2-6 against the spread in that span.\nUAB Blazers (23-11, 12-6 AAC)\nSince Jan. 14, the Blazers are 15-4 against the spread and have covered in five straight games. This is UAB’s fourth-straight season with more than 20 wins, a run which included a tourney appearance in 2022, but the Blazers haven’t won a game in the dance since 2005.\nNo. 4 Auburn vs. No. 13 Yale\nAuburn Tigers (27-7, 13-5 SEC)\nThe Tigers claimed their third SEC tournament title (1985, 2019) with a dominant showing in Nashville. Their average margin of victory across three games was 16 points. Then again, winning big is nothing new for Bruce Pearl’s team. Only one of their 27 victories has come by less than 11 points this season. Pearl also coached the 2019 team that followed up the SEC title with a run to the Final Four.\nYale Bulldogs (22-9, 11-3 Ivy)\nThe Bulldogs made the NCAA Tournament three times from the formation of the tournament (1939) through 2015. Yale has made it four times since 2016, including a win against a No. 5 seed Baylor that year. This year’s team plays at a slow tempo, among the 40 slowest in the country.\nNo. 6 BYU vs. No. 11 Duquesne\nBYU Cougars (23-10, 10-8 Big 12)\nIt was a solid first year in the Big 12 for the Cougars, which posted a winning record in arguably the best conference in the country. The Cougars are 6-2 against the spread in their last eight games. BYU hasn’t made it to the Round of 32 since 2011 and is 2-11 in the Round of 64 since 1995.\nDuquesne Dukes (24-11, 10-8 A-10)\nIt’s been 47 years since the Dukes went dancing. It’s been 55 years since the Dukes won a game in the tourney. This team lost five in a row in January, but has won eight straight and 10 of 11. The Dukes are 9-2 against the spread in their last 11 games.\nAdvertisement\nNo. 3 Illinois vs. No. 14 Morehead State\nIllinois Fighting Illini (26-8, 14-6 Big Ten)\nIllinois hasn’t made the Sweet 16 since Deron Williams and Dee Brown led the Illini to the national title game in 2005. That drought includes a No. 1-seeded team in 2021 and No. 4 seeds in 2006 and 2022. With Terrence Shannon Jr. averaging more than 22 points per game, the Illini have one of the most efficient offenses in the country (rated third on KenPom) and a chance to make the second week.\nMorehead State Eagles (26-8, 14-4 OVC)\nThe Eagles have a decent NCAA Tournament history, with two Sweet 16 appearances (1956, 1961) and, most recently, a win against a No. 4 seed Louisville in 2011. This year, the Eagles played four power conference teams (Alabama, Purdue, Penn State, Indiana), losing all four but having a game-winner buzzer-beater attempt miss in a one-point loss at Indiana.\nNo. 7 Washington State vs. No. 10 Drake\nWashington State Cougars (24-9, 14-6 Pac-12)\nThe last time the Cougars made the NCAA Tournament, Virginia coach Tony Bennett was in charge. The Cougars made the Sweet 16 in 2008. Even Klay Thompson didn’t go to the tourney with Wazzu. This year’s team not only ended that drought, but matched the school record for conference wins in a season.\nDrake Bulldogs (28-6, 16-4 Missouri Valley)\nDrake enters the tournament having won 10 of its last 11 games, but the Bulldogs are also on a roll in close games. The Bulldogs have won their last seven games by single digits. Drake is 4-2 in its opening games at NCAA Tournaments.\nNo. 2 Iowa State vs. No. 15 South Dakota State\nIowa State Cyclones (27-7, 13-5 Big 12)\nThe Cyclones are the top-rated defense on KenPom and showed that off by holding Houston to 41 points on 26.8 percent shooting in the Big 12 Tournament final. Strong defense and low betting totals go hand-in-hand. The under has hit in seven of the last eight Iowa State games.\nSouth Dakota State Jackrabbits (22-12, 12-4 Summit)\nIt’s been more than two months since the Jackrabbits were underdogs in a game, but they enter the tournament having covered the spread in seven of their last eight games (with the under hitting in the last five). South Dakota State is 0-6 all-time in the Division I tournament, including a nine-point loss to a No. 4 seed Providence two years ago.\nWEST\nNo. 1 North Carolina vs. No. 16 Howard/Wagner\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels (27-7, 17-3 ACC)\nThe ACC regular-season champions boast ACC Player of the Year RJ Davis, one of the nation’s most prolific scorers, but Hubert Davis’ team has gotten the job done on defense, too. North Carolina is ranked in the top 10 of adjusted defensive efficiency per KenPom, its best rating since the 2010-11 season, when the Tar Heels lost in the Elite Eight.\nAdvertisement\nHoward Bison (18-16, 9-5 MEAC)\nIt’s two straight tourney appearances for the Bison, who lost to No. 1 seed Kansas last year. The last two times Howard made the tourney (1992), a top-seeded Kansas was the first-round opponent. This is the first time Howard has made it to consecutive NCAA Tournaments.\nWagner Seahawks (16-15, 7-9 NEC)\nDon’t expect a high point total in any Wagner games. The Seahawks average 63.9 points per game and are allowing 63 points per game, making them one of the slowest-tempo teams in the country (360 out of 362 on KenPom). The under has hit in the last six Wagner games.\nNo. 8 Mississippi State vs. No. 9 Michigan State\nMississippi State Bulldogs (21-13, 8-10 SEC)\nThe Bulldogs are making consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances for the first time since 2008-09 and for just the sixth time in program history. This team lives up to its moniker on defense, which it will need to continue to do, considering its struggles shooting the ball from long range (32.5 percent) and the foul line (67.2 percent).\nMichigan State Spartans (19-14, 10-10 Big Ten)\nA preseason top-five team that failed to win 20 games in the regular season, Michigan State is in the field despite losing five of its last seven games, including home losses to bubble teams Ohio State and Iowa. The under is 2-6 in the last eight Michigan State games. Coach Tom Izzo, who has more than 700 career wins, is making his 25th NCAA Tournament appearance.\nNo. 5 Saint Mary’s vs. No. 12 Grand Canyon\nSaint Mary’s Gaels (26-7, 15-1 WCC)\nAfter a 3-5 start to the season that included a loss to Weber State, the Gaels got things going in a big way, especially in conference play. Saint Mary’s beat Gonzaga in two out of three meetings, including most recently in the WCC title game, and is 12-4 against the spread in the last 16 games.\nGrand Canyon Lopes (29-4, 17-3 WAC)\nThis is the third time in the last four years Bryce Drew has guided the Antelopes to the NCAA Tournament, but this is probably the best team to make it. Grand Canyon set a new program record for wins this season and has a win against San Diego State on its resume. The Antelopes have covered the spread in their last five games.\nNo. 4 Alabama vs. No. 13 Charleston\nAlabama Crimson Tide (21-11, 13-5 SEC)\nThe No. 1 scoring team in the country, the Crimson Tide have gone over 100 points on nine different occasions this season. They are not shy about shooting 3-pointers and this strategy is fairly effective (36.5 percent) considering the volume (30.3 attempts per game). But Bama is just 2-7 against ranked teams, so will they need to hit their treys to make a deep run.\nAdvertisement\nCharleston Cougars (27-7, 15-3 CAA)\nPat Kelsey is a name to watch if your team is looking for a head coach. Kelsey, 48, is a former Wake Forest and Xavier assistant who has earned an automatic bid to the tournament in five of the last eight years, including winning the 2020 Big South tournament before that NCAA Tournament was canceled. Kelsey guided the Cougars to the Big Dance last year and made it three times during his tenure at Winthrop.\nNo. 6 Clemson vs. No. 11 New Mexico\nClemson Tigers (21-11, 11-9 ACC)\nThe Tigers are coming off their worst loss of the season, a 21-point defeat to Boston College in the ACC tournament, but they claim wins over South Carolina and Alabama and on the road against North Carolina in conference play. Clemson also is 11-0 this season when shooting at least 40 percent from 3-point range.\nNew Mexico Lobos (26-9, 10-8 MWC)\nNew Mexico went from being squarely on the bubble to in with an automatic bid. The Lobos, who have covered in six straight games, started the year 18-3 but finished the regular season 4-6 before winning four games in the conference tournament. It’s been 10 years since New Mexico was in the NCAA Tournament.\nNo. 3 Baylor vs. No. 14 Colgate\nBaylor Bears (23-10, 11-7 Big 12)\nThe Bears have the toughest strength of schedule in the country, according to KenPom. Baylor beat Auburn, Florida and Seton Hall, but lost to Michigan State and Duke before running through the tough Big 12. The Bears came out the other end of that schedule with 23 wins and an impressive 18-11-3 record against the spread.\nColgate Raiders (25-9, 16-2 Patriot)\nThis is the fifth-straight NCAA Tournament appearance for the Raiders, who stayed within single digits in losses to No. 2 seed Tennessee in 2019 and No. 3 seed Wisconsin in 2022. The Raiders are the juggernaut in the Patriot League and were favored in every conference game, both regular season and tournament, this season.\nNo. 7 Dayton vs. No. 10 Nevada\nDayton Flyers (24-7, 14-4 A-10)\nThe Flyers went undefeated at home this season and don’t have any bad losses on the resume, but they enter the tournament with a 5-4 record in the last nine games and a shocking one-and-done in the Atlantic 10 tournament. Dayton last won an NCAA Tournament game in 2015. The over is 6-1 in Dayton’s last seven games.\nNevada Wolf Pack (26-7, 13-5 MWC)\nAfter a 15-1 start to the season, the Wolf Pack have struggled a bit more in the last couple of months. Still, Nevada is 6-2 against the spread in its last eight games, and the over has hit in the last six.\nAdvertisement\nNo. 2 Arizona vs. No. 15 Long Beach State\nArizona Wildcats (25-8, 15-5 Pac-12)\nThe Wildcats picked up wins against Duke, Michigan State, Wisconsin and Alabama in non-conference play and then won the Pac-12 regular season title. However, Arizona has weird losses to Stanford and Oregon State and enters the tourney having lost two of three. Arizona has been reliable against the spread with a 21-11-1 mark.\nLong Beach State Beach (21-14, 10-10 Big West)\nEntering the Big West tournament, the Beach had lost five straight games. Weird things happen in March, though, and here LBSU is. The Beach won three in a row to get the automatic bid and picked up wins against two teams they lost to earlier this month. The Beach last made the NCAA Tournament in 2012, and last won a game in the tourney in 1973.\nSOUTH\nNo. 1 Houston vs. No. 16 Longwood\nHouston Cougars (30-4, 15-3 Big 12)\nPoints are usually at a premium when playing the Cougars. They have the No. 2-rated defense on KenPom and play at a slow pace on top of that. The 28-point loss to Iowa State in the Big 12 Tournament final was shocking because the Cougars’ previous three losses had been by a combined 18 points. Houston has been favored in every game this season.\nLongwood Lancers (21-13, 6-10 Big South)\nSince moving up to Division 1 in the 2004-05 season, Longwood is making its second tournament appearance. The Lancers lost 88-56 to Tennessee two years ago. This year’s team started 12-1, then lost 10 of 12 before rallying to win seven of eight to make the field of 68. At 6-10, the Lancers have the fewest conference wins of any team in the field.\nNo. 8 Nebraska vs. No. 9 Texas A&M\nNebraska Cornhuskers (23-10, 12-8 Big Ten)\nNebraska’s famous football team hasn’t made a bowl game since 2016, but its infamous basketball team is making its first NCAA Tournament since 2014. Part of the Cornhuskers’ hardwood infamy is due to the program being the only power conference school to have never won an NCAA Tournament game. The 23 wins is Nebraska’s most since 1991.\nTexas A&M Aggies (20-14, 9-9 SEC)\nDespite featuring average length, Texas A&M is the No. 1 team in the country in both offensive rebounds per game and percentage. The Aggies also have made a habit of beating the total, hitting the over in five straight games and 11 of their last 13.\nNo. 5 Wisconsin vs. No. 12 James Madison\nWisconsin Badgers (22-13, 11-9 Big Ten)\nTrends and this Wisconsin team are fleeting. The Badgers started the season 16-4 and were ranked in the top 10. Wisconsin lost its next four games and finished the regular season 3-8. Suddenly, early season Wisconsin reemerged at the Big Ten tournament, where the Badgers beat Purdue and made the final.\nAdvertisement\nJames Madison Dukes (31-3, 15-3 Sun Belt)\nAfter the football team started 10-0, the basketball Dukes started the season 14-0, including a season-opening win at Michigan State. The Dukes enter the tourney on a 13-game winning streak but are only 6-7 against the spread during that streak. James Madison has been an underdog in just three games this season and has won two of them.\nNo. 4 Duke vs. No. 13 Vermont\nDuke Blue Devils (24-8, 15-5 ACC)\nThe Blue Devils lost their last two games but are as talented as any team in the country. Duke is one of the top perimeter shooting teams (37.7 percent for the season), but this also has been their downfall. Jon Scheyer’s team shot 33.5 percent on 3-pointers in its eight losses compared to 39.1 percent in wins. Duke also has connected on at least one 3-pointer in 1,220 straight games. That’s the second-longest streak in the country.\nVermont Catamounts (28-6, 15-1 Am. East)\nThe Catamounts not only have a unique nickname, but a history of being a tough out in the NCAA Tournament. As a No. 13 seed in 2005, Vermont knocked off Syracuse. They also lost by seven to Florida State in 2019 and by four to Arkansas in 2022, both as a No. 13 seed. This is Vermont’s third straight appearance.\nNo. 6 Texas Tech vs. No. 11 NC State\nTexas Tech Red Raiders (23-10, 11-7 Big 12)\nCoach Grant McCasland turned North Texas into a perennially dangerous team and has Texas Tech back in the NCAA Tournament in his first year in charge. He has the Red Raiders playing a slower tempo, but they also rank in the top 50 in both offensive and defensive efficiency. Tech is not shy about shooting 3-pointers and makes them 36.5 percent of the time.\nNC State Wolfpack (22-14, 9-11 ACC)\nThe Wolfpack completely flipped the script in March, going from losing four in a row to end the regular season to reeling off five straight victories to win their first ACC tournament title in nearly 40 years (1987). NC State had one Quad 1 win before its ACC tourney run. Is this an indication of a veteran team peaking at the exact right time, or just a tease?\nNo. 3 Kentucky vs. No. 14 Oakland\nKentucky Wildcats (23-9, 13-5 SEC)\nScoring is not a problem for the Wildcats, which is partially why the over has hit in 23 of 32 games. UK averages nearly 90 points per game. The ‘Cats shoot 41.2 percent on 3-pointers and aren’t afraid to jack them up. The problems come when the shots aren’t falling because Kentucky doesn’t shoot a large volume of free throws, and this is not a team known for its defense.\nOakland Golden Grizzlies (23-11, 15-5 Horizon)\nThe Golden Grizzlies have been an underdog in just two games in 2024 but were tested in non-conference play with a schedule that included Ohio State, Illinois, Drake, Xavier (a win), Michigan State and Dayton. Coach Greg Kampe is in his 40th year at the helm, making him the longest-tenured coach in men’s college basketball.\nAdvertisement\nNo. 7 Florida vs. No. 10 Boise State/Colorado\nFlorida Gators (24-11, 11-7 SEC)\nThe Gators fell to Auburn in the SEC Tournament final but are back in the Big Dance for the first time in three years. Florida is one of the nation’s top-scoring teams, averaging 85.1 points per game, and has gone over 100 on three different occasions. Opponents will have their work cut out for them on the glass too. One of the taller teams in the country, the Gators rank in the top five nationally in rebounding.\nBoise State Broncos (22-10, 13-5 MWC)\nThis is the third consecutive appearance for the Broncos, but Boise State has still never won an NCAA Tournament game at the Division I level. The Broncos are 0-9 in the tourney all-time. The last four appearances have featured a winnable game too. Boise was in the First Four in 2013 and 2015, was a No. 8 seed in 2022 and a No. 10 seed last year.\nColorado Buffaloes (24-10, 13-7 Pac-12)\nSince the NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, Colorado has not made the Sweet 16. The Buffaloes have just three tourney wins in the last 54 years. Tad Boyle has taken Colorado to six tourneys since he took over in 2010, and one more win would give him 25 wins in a season for the first time during his tenure.\nNo. 2 Marquette vs. No. 15 Western Kentucky\nMarquette Golden Eagles (25-9, 14-6 Big East)\nShaka Smart has led the Golden Eagles to 54 wins in the past two seasons, which already matches the most in program history. This is Smart’s 10th time making the NCAA Tournament, but he hasn’t made the Sweet 16 since that famous Final Four run with VCU in 2011, his first tourney appearance.\nWestern Kentucky Hilltoppers (22-11, 8-8 C-USA)\nGet ready for a high point total in Western Kentucky games. The Hilltoppers play the fastest tempo in the country and average just over 80 points per game. WKU lost its last four games before the Conference USA tournament but cruised to the title after the top two seeds lost before the Hilltoppers had to play them.\nMIDWEST\nNo. 1 Purdue vs. No. 16 Montana State/Grambling State\nPurdue Boilermakers (29-4, 17-3 Big Ten)\nTournament losses to Little Rock, North Texas, Saint Peter’s and Fairleigh Dickinson, all since 2016, have given the Boilermakers a reputation for being vulnerable to upsets. However, Purdue has made the second weekend in four of the last six tournaments. This is the second straight year Purdue has been a No. 1 seed and the fifth time ever.\nMontana State Bobcats (17-17, 9-9 Big Sky)\nThe Bobcats make their third straight NCAA Tournament appearance but are 0-5 in the dance. This year’s team hadn’t won three in a row all season but got three consecutive wins in the Big Sky tournament to get here. The Bobcats are 6-2 in their last eight, both overall and against the spread. Montana State is the only team in the field without a winning record.\nAdvertisement\nGrambling State Tigers (20-14, 14-4 SWAC)\nThis is Grambling State’s first time in the NCAA Tournament at the Division I level. The SWAC is far from a strong conference, but the Tigers did see quality competition in non-conference play (Colorado, Iowa State, Dayton, Drake, Florida) even if none of those games against tourney teams were all that competitive. The Tigers have won nine of their last 10 and the only loss came on the road in overtime.\nNo. 8 Utah State vs. No. 9 TCU\nUtah State Aggies (27-6, 14-4 MWC)\nDon’t be surprised if the Aggies play a close game or two in the tourney. Utah State played four overtime games, winning three. The Aggies played eight more games decided by five points or fewer decided in regulation and won all eight.\nTCU Horned Frogs (21-12, 9-9 Big 12)\nThis is the first time TCU has made it to three consecutive tournaments in program history. The Horned Frogs haven’t made it to the Sweet 16 since an Elite Eight run in 1968, but have been close to breaking that streak. Last year they lost by three to Gonzaga in the second round and the year before Arizona knocked them out in overtime in the same round.\nNo. 5 Gonzaga vs. No. 12 McNeese\nGonzaga Bulldogs (25-7, 14-2 WCC)\nThis isn’t the juggernaut Gonzaga teams of recent years, but the Bulldogs still have a top-10 rated offense on KenPom. The Bulldogs were favored in all but four games this season: neutral court losses to Purdue and UConn before the calendar turned to 2024 and wins at Kentucky and Saint Mary’s later in the season. Even with that one win against Saint Mary’s, the Gaels are the only team to beat Gonzaga in the last two months, and did so twice.\nMcNeese Cowboys (30-3, 17-1 Southland)\nLSU is still down a scholarship thanks to sanctions from when Will Wade was the Tigers’ coach, but Wade is in the tournament with the Cowboys in his first year at McNeese. The Cowboys have 30 wins, but only one of them is against a NCAA Tournament team (UAB). McNeese’s best wins came on the road against VCU and Michigan.\nNo. 4 Kansas vs. No. 13 Samford\nKansas Jayhawks (22-10, 10-8 Big 12)\nThe Jayhawks haven’t been one-and-done in the Big Dance since 2006 (upset by No. 13 Bradley) but they enter the tournament with losses in four of their last five games. KU desperately needs to get leading scorers Hunter Dickinson and Kevin McCullar Jr. back in the lineup, or a season that started with national championship aspirations could end with a whimper. Bill Self’s team is also just 13-19 against the spread.\nSamford Bulldogs (29-5, 15-3 SoCon)\nSamford lost by 43 at Purdue in its season opener and then lost at VCU before rattling off 17 straight wins for a streak that lasted more than two months. This is the third NCAA Tournament appearance for the Bulldogs, which lost by double figures in both of the previous two (1999, 2000).\nAdvertisement\nNo. 6 South Carolina vs. No. 11 Oregon\nSouth Carolina Gamecocks (26-7, 13-5 SEC)\nThe Gamecocks feasted on a cupcake-filled non-conference schedule that ranks in the 330s nationally. But they also held their own against quality competition (5-5 vs. Quad 1 teams) and have fared well in close games with a 13-4 record in contests decided by eight points or less. South Carolina also has an impressive 23-10 record against the spread.\nOregon Ducks (23-11, 12-8 Pac-12)\nWhen the Ducks were 13-3 and 5-0 in Pac-12 play in mid-January, it didn’t seem like a stretch Oregon would be in the field of 68. Then the Ducks went 7-8 in the next 15 games. Oregon rediscovered its early season form at the Pac-12 tournament. The Ducks beat UCLA, Arizona and Colorado after going 1-5 against those teams in the regular season. Oregon has made at least the Sweet 16 in its last four tourneys (2016, 2017, 2019, 2021).\nNo. 3 Creighton vs. No. 14 Akron\nCreighton Bluejays (23-9, 14-6 Big East)\nThe Bluejays have made the NCAA Tournament eight times since 2012 and are 6-2 in the Round of 64 during that span, including an Elite Eight run last year. Creighton is 7-2 against the spread in its last nine games and has a 19-point win against UConn during that run.\nAkron Zips (24-10, 13-5 MAC)\nThe Zips are 0-5 in the NCAA Tournament all-time, although they gave UCLA a scare in a four-point loss as a No. 13 seed two years ago. Akron was 3-5 in the eight games before the MAC tournament and is just 2-7-1 against the spread in its last 10 games, but escaped two close finishes to earn the auto bid.\nNo. 7 Texas vs. No. 10 Virginia/Colorado State\nTexas Longhorns (20-12, 9-9 Big 12)\nPlaying in the stacked Big 12 and with non-conference games against UConn and Marquette (both losses), Texas has seen plenty of tough opponents this season. However, the Longhorns were just 2-7 against teams with winning records in the Big 12. Texas is also 12-19-1 against the spread this season.\nVirginia Cavaliers (23-10, 13-7 ACC)\nThe Cavaliers are a team of extreme contrasts. They rank near the top of the leaderboard in scoring defense (59.6 points per game allowed) but sit near the bottom regarding their point production (63.6 per game). This is largely a byproduct of playing the country’s slowest pace, but it doesn’t help that UVA struggles shooting the ball, especially from the free-throw line (63.7 percent).\nColorado State Rams (24-10, 10-8 MWC)\nThe Rams started the season 13-1 with wins against Creighton, Colorado and New Mexico, but were up and down in Mountain West play. They sneak into the tournament for the second time in three years, but haven’t won an NCAA Tournament game since 2013. CSU is 1-6 against the spread in its last seven games.\nAdvertisement\nNo. 2 Tennessee vs. No. 15 Saint Peter’s\nTennessee Volunteers (24-8, 14-4 SEC)\nTennessee’s success in the Big Dance will likely come down to how well senior guard Dalton Knecht performs. The All-American and SEC Player of the Year ranks among the national leaders with 21.1 points per game. More importantly, Knecht has been responsible for more than a quarter of UT’s scoring (26.6 percent) this season. Speaking of scoring, seven of Tennessee’s past eight games have hit the under.\nSaint Peter’s Peacocks (19-13, 12-8 MAAC)\nIt’s been just two years since the Peacocks’ shocking run to the Elite Eight as a No. 15 seed. Four players from that team (Latrell Reid, Brent Bland, Oumar Diahame, Mouhamed Sow) are on this year’s roster. None of them were major contributors two years ago, although Reid is the second-leading scorer on this year’s team.\n(Photo of Tristen Newton: Sarah Stier / Getty Images)",
