We had tremendous external interest in this position, but Heather has earned the trust of our staff and I could not be more pleased to remove ‘Interim’ from her title. She will be an outstanding leader for our organization.”\nAccording to the Timbers, Davis is a born and raised Oregonian and was first hired as the organization’s general counsel in May 2022. When Paulson stepped down as CEO, she was selected as the interim replacement. Before the Timbers, Davis previously worked for the National Football League for nine years.\n“I am incredibly grateful for the support of our staff and for the confidence that Merritt has shown in me to lead this club,” said Davis in the statement provided by the Timbers. “It is an extraordinary privilege to be entrusted to lead such a storied and successful franchise that means so much to so many in my home state. We will continue to do the work to be a first-in-class club that everyone can be proud of.”",
