  "body_text": "Volleyball\nLast season’s expectations:\nHistorically an impressive volleyball team, the Badgers were expected to do well last season. The volleyball team consistently posts winning records and deep runs in the Big Ten Championship, NCAA Tournament and National Championship. Wisconsin fans were in for an exciting season.\nLast season’s reality:\nThe volleyball squad is always a fun Wisconsin team to watch, and this season was no exception. The Badgers made their 10th-straight NCAA Tournament appearance. Unfortunately for Badger fans, they lost in the Regional Finals to Pittsburgh. Nonetheless, they won their ninth overall Big Ten Championship, notching their fourth straight Big Ten title. These Badgers demonstrate the pinnacle characteristics of a team: unity, trust and ferocity.\nThis season’s expectations:\nVolleyball has been consistent with their winning streaks and tournament appearances, putting them at the top of the rankings throughout the season. While the team is likely to make another appearance at the NCAA Tournament and the Big Ten Championship game this upcoming season, their challenge will be winning another NCAA title — something they are definitely capable of.\nWomen’s Hockey\nLast season’s expectations:\nPrior to this year’s NCAA title, the women’s hockey team won six national titles, tied with Minnesota for the most of any NCAA women’s hockey team. Going into last season, the team had a lot of potential to make it to the national title game again, but this time with newcomers Laila Edwards, Caroline Harvey and Kirsten Simms.\nLast season’s reality:\nThe team had a rollercoaster of a season with a bit of a slump in January, but that didn’t deter them. The Badgers went all the way to the national title game and won it, picking up their seventh championship win. They now hold the record for most national titles in all of NCAA women’s hockey.\nThis season’s expectations:\nThe team has some increasingly exceptional players including Harvey, who continues to outshine her opponents and was named Bob Allen Player of the Year by USA Hockey in May for her outstanding play. With Harvey returning and a team stacked full of energetic freshmen and sophomores, the Badgers have a good chance of making it far in the 2023-24 season.\nMen’s Basketball\nLast season’s expectations:\nFresh off of a Big Ten regular season championship, the Badgers harbored high hopes for another season of surprising success in a highly competitive conference. Sophomore Chucky Hepburn was set to lead the team alongside senior Tyler Wahl in hopes of back-to-back top finishes in the conference.\nLast season’s reality:\nThe Badgers started off the season strong, opening with a fierce 11-2 record against top teams such as USC and Maryland. However, once Big Ten play picked up in the winter and spring, Wisconsin found themselves on the wrong side of countless close games. As the team became littered with injuries, they missed the NCAA Tournament for just the second time in 22 years.\nThis season’s expectations:\nGreg Gard seems to have avoided the boot after sitting on the hot seat for most of the season. He is bringing in two three-star freshmen, a four-star freshman and a four-star transfer from St. John’s. On top of that, every member of this past season’s squad will be available in 2023, providing a hopeful combination of experience and youth.\nWomen’s Basketball\nLast season’s expectations:\nGoing into her second season as head coach, Marisa Moseley had an opportunity to develop the Badgers into a well-rounded Big Ten team. Led by senior guard Julie Pospisilova and freshman forward Serah Williams, the Badgers held a favorable home schedule with a chance to break through the Big Ten and make their first NCAA tournament since 2009.\nLast season’s reality:\nPospisilova lived up to her hype all season long, averaging 14 points, five rebounds and four assists per game. She also became just the 28th player in the Badgers’ women’s basketball history to reach the 1,000 career point mark and the first international player to do so. Despite the extraordinary accomplishment, the Badgers struggled through a difficult road schedule and finished in the bottom half of the conference.\nThis season’s expectations:\nBecause the Big Ten already has at least five predicted Top-25 teams for this upcoming season, the Badgers certainly have their work cut out for 2023. Williams is set to lead the team alongside senior guard Brooke Schramek, and the Badgers will look to work their way up the Big Ten standings and the Big Ten Tournament.\nFootball\nLast season’s expectations:\nHopes were high for the Badgers in the fall of 2022. Quarterback Graham Mertz headed the offense alongside star running back Braelon Allen and wide receiver Chimere Dike in a rather weak Big Ten West. All eyes were on the Big Ten Championship Game in Indianapolis.\nLast season’s reality:\nWisconsin’s 2022 football season was shocking, to say the least. The Badgers fired head coach Paul Chryst halfway through the season, dropped games under interim head coach Jim Leonhard, hired Luke Fickell weeks later and won a bowl game in Arizona to finish with an underwhelming 7-6 record.\nThis season’s expectations:\nWith Luke Fickell taking over as head coach at Camp Randall, this coming season’s expectations are through the roof. Fickell brought with him a plethora of assistant coaches, transfers and recruits to build a brand-new Badger football look. Wisconsin has been at the forefront of dark horse picks in the Big Ten for the 2023 season with a Big Ten West Championship in sight.\nMen’s Cross Country\nLast season’s expectations:\nThe Badgers have enjoyed a mass of successes in recent years. Head coach Mick Byrne continues to keep Wisconsin at the top of the Big Ten since he arrived in 2008 and expectations for the 2022 season were no lower than the top.\nLast season’s reality:\nLed by runners Bob Likely, Evan Bishop, Jackson Sharp and more, the Badgers dominated every competition they raced in throughout the season. Six first place team finishes out of eight competitions overall saw the Badgers win their 53rd Big Ten Championship, a first place finish in NCAA Great Lakes Regional qualifiers and a top-10 finish at the NCAA National Championships.\nThis season’s expectations:\nThe best of the best is nothing less than expected for the Badgers in 2023. Wisconsin will be chasing their sixth National Championship title and will only lose five of their 16 runners. Although the losses of Sharp and other seniors will be significant, Byrne is expected to earn success with his squads for years to come.\nWomen’s Cross Country\nLast season’s expectations:\nJust as he’s done with the men’s team, Byrne consistently guides the Badgers’ women’s team to success. After the departure of team legend and current Olympian Alicia Monson in 2019 and a canceled season in 2020, the Badgers were slowly regaining momentum toward the top of the Big Ten.\nLast season’s reality:\nLed by Shea Ruhly, Emma Watcke, Samantha Stieve and others, the Badgers finished in the top five in over half of the season’s races, including a third place team finish at the Big Ten Championships and a first place team finish at the Illinois Open and the Loyola Lakefront Invitational. The team also finished in the top 20 at the NCAA Championships.\nThis season’s expectations:\nAs expected, Wisconsin is continuing to gain momentum after COVID-19 cancellations. However, just under half of the 2022 roster held a status of senior or higher, meaning the team will be losing some of its most experienced runners. Nonetheless, Byrne’s consistent success speaks for itself and the Badgers are expected to enjoy — and possibly surpass — similar levels of success in 2023.\nMen’s Golf\nLast season’s expectations:\nAfter a tumultuous 2021 season, Wisconsin looked to bounce back into the Big Ten and national scene. Graduate students Maxime Legros and Clayton Tribus headlined Michael Wilson’s 12-man team with both individual and team success in mind.\nLast season’s reality:\nThe Badgers played their way into the Big Ten Championship, where they took home third place — their best finish since the 1995-96 season. Legros and Tribus led the way for the team, while Cameron Huss and Coalter Smith also contributed to the impressive finish. Legros earned All-Big Ten Second Team honors at the end of the season and led Wisconsin to 12th place in the NCAA regional qualifiers at the end of the season.\nThis season’s expectations:\nAlthough last season’s team was headed by two experienced golfers, the next group of leaders is set to take over — including Huss and Graham Moody. Aspirations for the 2023 season are high as Wisconsin will look to equal or better their historic finish to last season.\nWomen’s Golf\nLast season’s expectations:\nThe Badgers entered the season with a comparatively young roster built of mostly sophomore golfers — including Chloe Chan and Gia Feliciano. After a ninth place finish at the 2021 Big Ten Championships, head coach Todd Oehrlein’s team had all to play for last season.\nLast season’s reality:\nSenior Emily Lauterbach led the Badgers all season, finishing top five twice throughout the year, including a tied-second place finish at the Big Ten Championships. Backed up by play from Vanessa Ho and Alexia Siehl, the Badgers finished fifth out of 14 teams at the Big Ten Championships — their best finish since 2016.\nThis season’s expectations:\nWhile the team leader held senior eligibility last season, Oehrlein’s squad will not be faulted in 2023. The strong junior core is expected to lead the team toward the top of the Big Ten once again with even more improvement in mind for this season’s placements.\nMen’s Hockey\nLast season’s expectations:\nIt’s been nearly two decades since this team has seen an NCAA title game. Since their last championship appearance in 2006, the team has been unmistakably outplayed by their opponents and struggled to records around .500 every season since.. But while expectations for this past season may have been low, each season offers the team a fresh start.\nLast season’s reality:\nDisappointing reality struck Badger fans again last season as the team notched another poor losing record. Their opponents were faster, sharper and more determined to win, leaving a lot of work for the players and coaching staff in this upcoming season.\nThis season’s expectations:\nAfter a rough season, new coaching styles may be what this team needs. The Badgers replaced Tony Granato with new Head Coach Mike Hastings and acquired USHL Coach of the Year Nick Oliver on their coaching staff. With many seniors and graduate students departing, Hastings has the potential to make an impression on younger freshmen and sophomore players for upcoming seasons.\nMen’s Rowing\nLast season’s expectations:\nThe men’s rowing team is another consistent Madison squad. While the team has always been able to hold their own among their opponents, they tend to slip during their races and regattas. The rowing team tends to be between 10th and 12th in terms of ranking nationally each season, so the hope for last season was to continue to improve.\nLast season’s reality:\nThe rowing team competed in the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship on June 2 to June 4 this year. They finished in third place across their races to secure a 15th place finish overall as a team.\nThis season’s expectations:\nWisconsin offers a lot of opportunities for rowing for the men’s and women’s team. Additionally, the program model allows a lot of room for rowers to build on their skills and find the perfect team. The goals this season are to continue to expand the team’s skill sets and work toward higher rankings in their events.\nWomen’s Rowing\nLast season’s expectations:\nThe women’s rowing team is consistently ranked high in the Big Ten Conference. While the Badgers have their ups and downs each season, the team is always making improvements and continuing to do well against their opponents.\nLast season’s reality:\nThe team placed 6th at the Big Ten conference with their novice eight. They also made an appearance at the IRA Championship, where they secured a strong fifth place finish. The team did well in their events leading up to the Big Ten Championships and the IRA, continuing to improve and make adjustments that benefit the rowers.\nThis season’s expectations:\nHead Coach Bebe Bryans is stepping down for the upcoming rowing season. The rowing program will definitely miss Coach Bryans and her impact on the program as they start the new season.\nMen’s Soccer\nLast season’s expectations:\nThe last time that the men’s soccer team won a national championship was in 1995, and the last time they won the Big Ten Tournament was in 2017. The team has been consistent with holding their own among their opponents, but they fail to capitalize in big games. That being said, they were expected to build their team last season and work on new strategies.\nLast season’s reality:\nThe men’s soccer season ended in a loss in the first round of the Big Ten Tournament to Rutgers in penalty kicks. While the team had a losing record in terms of conference play, the season was positive in developing the team’s skill sets and working on new plays for future seasons.\nThis season’s expectations:\nThe team is welcoming two newcomers this season, Markie Hrvojevic and Birgir Baldvinsson. Head coach Neil Jones is confident about the young players’ contributions to the team.\n“[Their] mentality, demeanor, and personality would fit well with our program and expectations,” Jones said in a press statement last month. Additionally, Jones believes Baldvinsson is a standout student-athlete who will bring strong skills to the team.\nWomen’s Soccer\nLast season’s expectations:\nThe women’s soccer team is consistent with their winning records and end-of-season tournament appearances, and they tend to go far in the NCAA tournament and the Big Ten Tournament. However, their biggest obstacle — like many other teams — is winning it all. The last time they won the Big Ten Tournament was in 2014.\nLast season’s reality:\nThe women’s soccer team had an exciting season last year, ending with a winning record. However, they had a disappointing end to the season when they lost the Big Ten Tournament to Penn State in a one goal game. The women’s team finished this season ranked an impressive third among their Big Ten opponents.\nThis season’s expectations:\nThe Badgers are expected to do well this season. The team said goodbye to a few seniors last year. While the team will have to adjust accordingly, the transition gives some underclassmen a chance to grow and build skill sets to contribute to the team’s play.\nMen’s Swim and Dive\nLast season’s expectations:\nAfter a string of strong finishes in the Big Ten over the last three years, the Badgers entered the season with expectations to repeat their success near the top of the conference.\nLast season’s reality:\nTo no surprise, the Badgers performed well throughout last season to finish undefeated in the Big Ten, including a win over rival Minnesota. Wisconsin finished as the 20th-best team in the nation and took fourth place in the Big Ten Championships.\nThis season’s expectations:\nConsistency in the water is the expectation for Wisconsin, and the 2023 season should prove to be similar to those of the past. Head coach Yuri Suguiyama, entering his sixth year with the team, will look to trend toward adding more Badger athletes to his growing list of Big Ten and NCAA individual champions.\nWomen’s Swim and Dive\nLast season’s expectations:\nJust as he has done with the men’s swim and dive program, Suguiyama fronts the women’s swim and dive team and leads them to consistent success. After a top-five finish for Wisconsin’s women’s team in the Big Ten Championships the season before, the Badgers looked to continue their successes.\nLast season’s reality:\nShort-distance star Abby Carlson — alongside Paige McKenna, Phoebe Bacon, Mallory Jump and more — held it down for Wisconsin last season. The Badgers took home third place in the conference last season led by multiple first place finishes from Bacon and Carlson at the Big Ten Championships.\nThis season’s expectations:\nAlthough some of the team’s top performers last season were seniors, the rest of the team is sure to continue Wisconsin’s success in the water. The team will certainly be shooting for another top three finish in the conference and another appearance at the national championship competitions.\nSoftball\nLast season’s expectations:\nAfter a three-round run in the 2022 NCAA Tournament, the Badger softball team was poised for another successful season. Led by head coach Yvette Healy, the team expected to finish even higher in the Big Ten than their eighth place finish in 2022.\nLast season’s reality:\nWith 33 RBIs and 10 home runs from power hitter Kayla Konwent throughout the season, offensive play powered the Badgers to a fifth place finish in the Big Ten. Maddie Schwartz’s leading pitching performance of 140 innings led Wisconsin’s late-season push toward the top.\nThis season’s expectations:\nAlthough the team’s leaders were mostly graduate students during last season’s successes, there is little doubt regarding this upcoming team. Healy will be entering her 14th season and continues to be credited with the turnaround of UW’s softball program. She is expected to lead her team to yet another strong season in a competitive conference.\nMen’s Tennis\nLast season’s expectations:\nAfter making it all the way to the Big Ten quarterfinals in 2021, the Badgers expected to put on another strong display last season. A strong team of experienced players on both singles and doubles teams were prepared for more success at the Nielsen Tennis Stadium.\nLast season’s reality:\nSenior Sebastian Vile led the team in singles wins with a strong 18-14 record. In the doubles category, Vile and his partner Robin Parts dominated the competition with a 19-6 overall record. As a team, the Badgers posted a strong home record all season but were unable to replicate their strong Big Ten Tournament run from the season before.\nThis season’s expectations:\nAlthough some of the team’s top performers held senior and graduate student status last season, there is no doubt Wisconsin will find more players to fill the gaps. Head coach Danny Westerman — who is entering his ninth season with the men’s team — finds constant success with international recruiting and will continue to utilize his unique roster this coming season.\nWomen’s Tennis\nLast season’s expectations:\nWhile the program went into a short decline in the aftermath of COVID-19 cancellations, head coach Kelcy McKenna looked to solidify her team within the collegiate tennis world for good in her seventh season with Wisconsin. With top players such as senior Ava Markham returning, Wisconsin looked poised for a strong season.\nLast season’s reality:\nThe Badgers worked their way to a #22 national rank by the end of last season, earning an NCAA Tournament bid. Led by Markham — a unanimous All-Big Ten nominee — the team made their deepest run in the NCAA Tournament since 2002 and finished with a 20-7 record, their best since the 1996-97 season.\nThis season’s expectations:\nMcKenna has returned the Badgers to the spotlight after COVID cancellations took out a strong start to the 2019-20 season. Sophomore Maria Sholokhova, the team’s second All-Big Ten nominee in the 2022-23 season, will lead a team with hopes of another groundbreaking season in mind.\nMen’s Track and Field\nLast season’s expectations:\nMuch like Wisconsin’s cross country teams, Mick Byrne has kept the men’s track and field team in the national spotlight since his arrival over 15 years ago. Therefore, the bar was high last season, both for high jumpers and the team’s expectation.\nLast season’s reality:\nTo no surprise, the Badgers took first place at the Big Ten Indoor Conference and placed in the top 20 nationally. The outdoor season brought similar success as the men’s team took fourth place at the outdoor conference championships and qualified four individual runners for the national championship meet. The four runners will represent 17th ranked Wisconsin in Austin, Texas on June 7-9. Results can be found on the NCAA’s flash results page.\nThis season’s expectations:\nAfter the NCAA Outdoor Championships meet, the team will face a quick turnaround as they prepare to start the upcoming season less than six months after finishing their previous outing. As is the case with any team coached by Byrne and his staff, there is no doubt the Badgers will continue to stay in the conversations surrounding track and field next season.\nWomen’s Track and Field\nLast season’s expectations:\nAfter top-five finishes in indoor and outdoor conference meets in the 2021-22 season, the women’s track and field team looked to extend their consistent high-quality performances in last season’s meets.\nLast season’s reality:\nA sixth place team finish at the Big Ten Outdoor Championships meant that two Badgers — thrower Josie Schaefer and hurdler Destiny Huven — will be heading to the national championship meet in Texas. The two athletes will be competing on June 8 to June 10 for a shot at topping national competition in their respective races. Results can be found on the NCAA’s flash results page.\nThis season’s expectations:\nA quick offseason for the team will see Mick Byrne enter his 16th season as the head coach of the program. His consistent success with all of the running programs — including women’s track and field — leaves minimal doubt that the Badgers will be back on the national stage this coming season.\nWrestling\nLast season’s expectations:\nIn a conference such as the Big Ten, which is loaded with wrestling stardom across all rosters, the Badgers had nothing to lose last season. With the Big Ten being such a high quality wrestling conference, Wisconsin’s expectations were less than impressive.\nLast season’s reality:\nDespite facing the likes of #1 Penn State, #2 Iowa, #5 Nebraska, #5 Michigan and more national Top-25 teams all season, Wisconsin managed to pull out an 8-8 record on the season and an eighth place finish at the Big Ten Championships. Two of the team’s captains, Dean Hamiti and Trent Hillger, took 6th and 8th place respectively at the national level.\nThis season’s expectations:\nAfter navigating the stacked Big Ten last season, there is no limit for the Badgers in the upcoming season. Head coach Chris Bono will continue to navigate the difficult conference schedule while returning almost all of his wrestlers — including Hamiti, last season’s top performer.",
