There isn't enough words I can possibly say to sum up the person you were, but I'm grateful you were my nanna.\n\"All those years ago when you put a bet on at the bookies that I would play for England one day and on the day you leave us, we bring it home again. You always knew it.\"\nHer father Nick was diagnosed with prostate cancer the day after his daughter scored for the Lionesses against Germany in their Euro 2022 final success at Wembley.\nToone said she did not \"actually grieve\" until a period on the sidelines through injury two months after his death - and lost her love for the game.\nShe made six appearances for England at the Euros in Switzerland, scoring against the Netherlands and Wales in the group stage.\nToone played 87 minutes of the final against world champions Spain before being replaced by Beth Mead.\nEngland goalkeeper Hannah Hampton also lost her grandfather two days before the final, and she saved two penalties in the shootout following a 1-1 draw to help her side defend the title they won in 2022.\n- Published30 July 2025\n- Published28 July 2025\n- Published27 July 2025",
