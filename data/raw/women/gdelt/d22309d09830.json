Follow along as we track their progress as they prepare both mentally and physically for a chance to shine on the game’s biggest stage.\nAs cool as you think Jun Endo is, the truth is she’s cooler.\nAdvertisement\nOn a bright winter day in Los Angeles, Japanese national team player and Angel City winger Endo sat down for an interview with The Athletic alongside her translator. She understands English better than she speaks it at the moment, but she’s working on it. Endo previously picked up some Korean — partly so she could better enjoy one of her favorite K-pop bands — and is also getting an introduction to Spanish through her boyfriend. Amidst all this, she is entering another season with Angel City as its likely starting left winger, while also fighting for a spot on the Japanese national team roster for the 2023 World Cup.\nEndo grew up in the Fukushima Prefecture in Japan, the daughter of a soccer coach and a teacher. She was one of four and the youngest, with nine years between herself and her oldest sibling. All of them played soccer — that was her childhood, she said. Just soccer. It wasn’t the strictest environment growing up, according to Endo. Her parents let her grow up “freely,” as she describes it.\nBut when she was 10 years old, the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, tsunami and subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown changed the course of her childhood. She was only in fourth grade, but was still able to spend that summer watching the Nadeshiko win the 2011 Women’s World Cup in Germany.\nEndo said right after the disaster, she wasn’t allowed to go outside, or basically do anything at all. There was no outdoor training for a full year. She and her teammates had to avoid certain areas due to nuclear radiation. Though it was a difficult time, Endo said she wants to remember it. “So I can let others know what happened,” she said through her translator.\nThe area where Endo lived was farther from the ocean and therefore not impacted as much — at least leaving her family with a place to stay. But more than 10 years later, other areas in the prefecture still haven’t been rebuilt. And after a recent visit home, Endo said progress had significantly slowed.\nAdvertisement\nShe said she wants to highlight that there is still some exclusion of residents based on where they lived during the earthquake, if not outright discrimination. Fukushima’s local industries have also been impacted. After the disaster, Endo said people would reject products from the area, which includes fruit and rice production.\n“They’d be like, no thank you, we don’t want anything,” she said, an attitude that US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez highlighted as still ongoing during a recent visit to Japan.\nEndo went from being inspired by that 2011 World Cup win to now bringing important energy and offensive options to the Japanese national team. During the 2023 SheBelieves tournament, Nadeshiko head coach Futoshi Ikeda highlighted her importance as a left-footed player who can bring speed to the team’s left wing and operate well on her own, should the team open any space at all on the left.\nThe goal below for Japan against Canada is almost a direct replica of the goal Endo scored for Angel City in its 2022 home opener against the North Carolina Courage.\nThough she alternated between being used as a substitute and a starter for Japan, it was very clear that Endo was a player Japan could use in its 3-5-2 formation to help pry open defenses with her tempo and ability to bypass lines.\n“With every game I feel that I’ve been fitting more into that formation,” she said.\nYou could see it in the way Japan played its way into SheBelieves, opening scoreless 1-0 against Brazil, unable to quite find the rhythm they needed, and again losing 1-0 to the United States but looking sharper, before finally putting together a confident 3-0 win over Canada. Even in the first two losses, Endo said the team felt they could have won, specifically with games crucial for World Cup preparation.\n“We have to make every single game count and those mistakes can’t be happening,” she said.\nAdvertisement\nEspecially against the U.S., Endo said she felt less nervous and scared thanks to her time in the NWSL. She started and played 22 games in the 2022 season for Angel City, racking up 1,925 minutes and landing in the team’s top five players for both shots and shots on goal. Now she has more confidence to get involved and be active in national team games against any opponent.\nNWSL is also a league much further along in its development than Japan’s club scene, where the Nadeshiko league and the WE League are still fighting for fans and sponsors.\n“The women’s team is doing just as well (as the men) and because this year is the World Cup, (we) want to make the point that women’s or men’s does not matter. It’s soccer,” Endo said.\nShe would like to see the Japan Football Association put equal effort and resources into their national teams and knows that 2023 will be important in leaving an impression on the federation and fans alike in order to keep driving attention to the women’s game. It’s a lot of pressure on anyone, let alone a 22-year-old who’s still finding her footing with both the national team and professional club.\nSo on her off days, when Endo has no soccer at all, she wanders Los Angeles. The beach is a favorite for relaxing and walking her two dogs — an American Pit Bull and a Pit Bull mix — with her boyfriend, a local soccer coach and scout.\nView this post on Instagram\nHer boyfriend isn’t quite conversational in Japanese, and Endo is improving her English. But they don’t have problems communicating, Endo said. They keep their language simple and uncomplicated with each other and find mutual understanding that way. They play soccer too, but Endo likes just walking together.\nShe especially likes window shopping, just going to the mall and not thinking about the game. Clothes are a favorite. Endo’s instagram is filled with looks ranging from streetwear to glam to retro and vintage. There are outfits that fit in at the nightclub and the skate park, and anywhere else cool in between.\nAdvertisement\nEndo’s other big shopping draw is perfumes. She likes going around in scent shops using all the testing strips to sample the smells.\n“I won’t buy it but I’m like, it smells nice,” she said. She likes how people can mix scents to make their own personalized fragrances and wants to try it herself one day. A signature Jun Endo fragrance is, according to her, about evoking a particular image.\n“The image of a cool lady,” she said. Nothing super sweet or fruity; she’s looking for an almost masculine fragrance, more like a cologne.\nShe’d also buy a house she said, while on the topic of things she fantasizes about. A big house in Los Angeles, no particular neighborhood, but just for her with no roommates and nothing else around except her boyfriend and the dogs.\nThe day after our interview, Endo ran out for Angel City’s preseason friendly against Liga MX Femenil side Club América with freshly-dyed lollipop pink hair. In her second season with the club, she said she’s pushing to express herself more with her teammates and communicate better on the field — hence the English practice.\nAgainst América, Endo was a conduit in the midfield for her teammates, playing in the space underneath forward Alyssa Thompson and moving in and out of the wide area or tucking more central as needed. She looked like she was having fun. The communication, it seems, is coming along just fine.\nThe Journey to the Cup series is part of a partnership with Google Chrome.
