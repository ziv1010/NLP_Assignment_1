  "body_text": "Jurgen Klopp has hailed Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou as a \"top bloke\" in the build-up to Liverpool's top-of-the-table clash with Spurs - and it appears the feeling's mutual.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nPostecoglou has won a host of new admirers since he brought his down-to-earth persona and attacking playing ethos to White Hart Lane, with Klopp evidently among the Australian's fan club.\n\"Spurs doing well, Ange seems a top bloke, looking forward to meeting him,\" said Klopp before bringing Liverpool to London for a clash on Saturday (Sunday AEDT) between two unbeaten sides in the league this season.\n\"I think they (Tottenham fans) were all desperate for offensive football - he's doing it.\n\"Everyone knew when they saw Celtic play in recent years, what kind of coach he is. Tottenham fans were all desperate for offensive football and in a year when Harry Kane has left, he has done extremely well. It will be a real test for both of us.\"\nBut Postecoglou was quick to repay the compliment later on Friday, saying: \"Jurgen is an outstanding manager, one of the managers I think it's fair to say who has made an impact on the competition, not just on his club.\n\"Because when he came in, with the way Liverpool went about things, he challenged quite a few of the conventions about the Premier League and introduced a new style of play that others have followed.\n\"It's a great test for where we are at the moment in terms of our development.\"\nThe Reds, currently second behind leaders Manchester City, are unbeaten in all competitions so far this season, winning five of their first six league games as well as winning in the League Cup and Europa League.\nYet Spurs too haven't yet lost in the league under Postecoglou as they lie fourth, just two points behind.\nThe clash at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is another huge examination for Spurs just six days since they showed how much progress they've made under Postecoglou with their resilient 2-2 draw in the north London derby at Arsenal.\nThe good news for Postecoglou is that captain Son Heung-min and key midfielder James Maddison are in line in play after both had to be substituted late on at Arsenal after knocks.\nThey both trained on Friday, but new signing Brennan Johnson will miss out with an injury that's \"nothing too serious\".\nMeanwhile, Postecoglou's influence at Spurs even seems to be rubbing off on the club's Women's Super League team, with new coach Robert Vilahamn saying he's determined to get them playing in the same sort of attacking, free-flowing style of football that the Australian is fostering.\n\"We have an identity that looks like Tottenham. Tottenham want to play a style with the men's team and the women's team, academy and I think me and Ange try to do the same stuff with how to play,\" said Swede Vilahamn.\nWith PA\nAustralian Associated Press",
