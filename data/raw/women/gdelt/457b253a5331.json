  "body_text": "A moment more than two years in the making occurred at the 72-minute mark of Launceston United's Women's Super League season-opening game.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nStepping onto Taroona Football Club's Kelvedon Park was substitute Montana Leonard, replacing Danielle Gunton, as she prepared herself to play her first WSL fixture since rupturing her left anterior-cruciate ligament in September 2022.\nThe Canadian import spent all of 2023 out injured as a result of that injury and looked set for a big 2024.\nBut after just 27 minutes of Summer Cup pre-season action for United, Leonard then ruptured her right ACL and meniscus, ending her campaign before it began.\n\"It is a long rehab, just for one injury, but to do it back-to-back, it's a really mentally-draining process,\" Leonard said.\n\"There were definitely times that I doubted if I'd be able to come back, but I think even though it was only 20 minutes this weekend, it definitely was good for my confidence and gave me a bit more belief than I had before.\"\nSurviving the remainder of the match without injury was the first priority, but the prolific forward managed far more than that, scoring twice to help United to a 6-0 demolition of the hosts.\nInitially concerned whether she would return as the same player post-injuries, Leonard said her confidence was helped by the club's constant support while she was going through rehab.\n\"The team has been amazing on and off the field in terms of supporting me, so it was nice to just go out there, I could feel them all cheering me on,\" she said.\n\"I didn't have too much pressure, but as soon as I did score the goal, immediately they were all surrounding me.\"\nLeonard, who coached the WSL team for the back end of last season, said relief was the prevailing emotion when she saw the ball go into the back of the net the first time, but insisted that Saturday's dominant win was just the start.\n\"We're ready to get back into that top part of the league. Our goal is to win it, so I think that was a really good start to the season and a great building block for us,\" she said.\nImports fire City to NPL summit\nThey might be only one game into the season but coach Daniel Syson's Launceston City look a formidable outfit in NPL Tasmania.\nSitting atop the ladder after defeating Launceston United 5-0 on Friday night, City's Prospect Park win was enjoyed by a healthy crowd who watched plenty of fresh faces make their first impression.\nUnited signing Sungung Choi looked a lively addition alongside English duo Kingsley Eshun and David Owusu, but it was City's imports that stole the show from minute one to minute 90, quite literally.\nAn Australian who has spent most of his career overseas, Angus Taylor's signature was met with plenty of fanfare by Syson.\nAnd he delivered from the outset, scoring in the first minute, before adding a second in the 60th.\nThierry Swaby opened up his season tally with a powerful header from a corner that beat United 'keeper Daniel Nash, while Shota Fujishiro came on as a substitute and put the final nail in United's coffin with his first goal for the club in the 90th minute.\nWhile left-back Kazuki Hashimoto didn't score on debut, he was arguably the most impressive, with his mazy runs through midfield causing his opponents plenty of problems and almost led to a stunning goal.\nUnited's despair wasn't felt alone on the weekend, with Riverside enduring losses on both NPL and WSL fronts.\nThe men's team hung in with league powerhouses Devonport Strikers for more than an hour but ultimately lost 3-0, while the women's side were crushed 12-0 by their North-West opponents.",
