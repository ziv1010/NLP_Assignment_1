Readers are asked to send additional information to the ASA office or asa@asa3.org. ASA members are drawn to the organization for diverse reasons. They join the ranks of Christians; scientists, philosophers, biblical scholars, and other thoughtful persons over many centuries who have reflected on the interaction of science and the Christian Faith. Some have been able to participate in the discussion, others take the discussion to the church and the general public where science touches human values. We honor here a portion of those who have joined our fellowship.\nOBITUARIES\ntop\nJohn Leo Abernethy (1901-1973) Chemistry.\nJohn was emeritus professor of chemistry from California State Polytechnic University in Pomona and had been living in La Verne Manor in La Verne, with severe impairment of his vision. Born in San Jose, California, John received a B.A. from U.C.L.A. and an M.S. (1938) and Ph.D. (1940) from Northwestern, followed by postdoctoral work at the Radiation Laboratory at U. C. Davis and back at U.C.L.A.\nHe was a member of the American Chemical Society and Sigma Xi, and had served on the editorial board of J. Chem. Ed. He had also done consulting work for International Chemical & Nuclear Co., and in 1962-63 was a Fulbright Fellow at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru.\nHe was introduced to ASA by one of its founders, Alton Everest. John Abernethy's research on enzyme chemistry focused on reactions catalyzed by papain and similar photolytic enzymes. A series of his papers in Bioorganic Chem. continued into the 1980's in spite of his disability.\nHe contributed an article \" A personal God, viewed scientifically\" to a 1950 collection evidence-god-expanding-universe, (1958). His paper, \"The Concept of Dissymmetric Worlds\" J. Chem. Education 49 (7), 455-461 (July 1972), embodies a teaching concept he has worked out over the years. At California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, \"Jack\" Abernethy uses \"mirror spellings\" of words to drive home to organic chemistry students the significance of chirality (optical activity). Thus, a world enantiomorphic to our present world is referred to as a \"d1row\" in which 'snamuh' and other forms of \"efil\" are made up of 'sdnuopmoc' that are mirror images of those in our own bodies. Jack included in his paper a section on philosophical implications, stating that some scientists would include deity in their total picture of the origin of living matter. This modest assertion managed to survive the editing and refereeing process, although a referee had been critical of an earlier form of the paper. Jack says he is still getting reprint requests from all over, including one from Leningrad State University and one from the Organic Division of the Siberian Section of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. We like a quotation Jack included from G. N. Lewis's The Anatomy of Science (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1926): \"The scientist does not speak of the last analysis but rather the next approximation.\" Newsletter *\ntop\nRobert M. Adams (1913-1985) Mathematics.\nOf Dallas, Texas, died of cardiac arrest on 22 November 1985, at age 72. Born in Rome, Georgia, Bob received a B.S. in mathematics from John B. Stetson University in Florida in 1938 and did graduate work at the U. of Texas in Austin, where he taught for many years. He was a member of various mathematics and engineering societies and of Scofield Memorial Church of Austin, where a memorial service was held on November 25, \"befitting the passing of a believer.\"\nBob Adams was an effective witness on the U. T. campus, a man of deep faith, broad interests, and ready wit. He is survived by his wife Annie Jo, a brother and sister, sons Bob, Jr., and Charles, three grandchildren-and a large extended family. Bob cared about people and was a good companion. For the past ten years, since his retirement, Bob had worked at the center in Dallas where, young people are trained to become Wycliffe Bible translators. Newsletter*\ntop\nRoy M. Adams (1920-2003) Chemistry.\nRoy passed away March 26, 2003 at age 83. He was born in Hong Kong of missionary parents and graduated Summa Cum Laude from Sterling C. He took his doctoral work at U. Kansas in two installments, interrupted by military service as pilot and navigator. He was professor of chemistry at Geneva C. in PA from 1947 until his 1985 retirement.\nHe edited the textbook Boron, Metallo-Boron Compounds and Boranes. Roy held eleven patents and encouraged more than 100 students to earn PhD or MD degrees. His sons tell us that, to the end, his memory was near photographic, his wit sharp and dry, and his health good enough to feed cows every day. He often quoted the verse, \"The Earth is the Lord 's and the fullness thereof,\" and practiced stewardship and recycling long before these became popular. We know that when these gentlemen met their Maker, they heard, \"Well done, good and faithful servant. Geneva College in Beaver Falls, PA is the school of the Reformed Presbyterian Church.\nInternationally known boron researcher and prof. emeritus Roy Adams was paid tribute at a dinner on Sept. 16, 2000, for his 45 years of service to the college. Nearly 300 people attended. The 26,000 sq. ft. Adams Chemistry Center is the next building to be built on campus. C&EN reported (16 Oct 2000, p. 56) that \"Adams told supporters that his accomplishments were never done for his own glory. Rather, it was his commitment as a Christian scholar that drove his research and mentoring of students.\" He did his graduate work at the U. of Kansas, and started teaching at Geneva in 1946. He held eleven patents.\" Newsletter*\ntop\nRobert J. Albers (1938-1985) Chemistry.\nProfessor at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, died of stomach cancer at age 47 on 3 September 1985. A Calvin graduate, Bob received his Ph.D. at the U. of Connecticut (under ASA member Roy Gritter, now at IBM) and did postdoctoral work at Leiden in the Netherlands and at Florida State in Tallahassee. He had also taught at Northern Illinois in De Kalb before joining the Calvin faculty in 1972. Bob did collaborative research with Fritz Rottman, a Calvin classmate on the biochemistry faculty at Case Western Reserve; they began publishing together when Rottman was at Michigan State.\nBob Albers was a long-time member of ASA. He is survived by his wife and three children. (Our thanks for much of this information to Bob's brother-in-law, Calvin biologist Uko Zylstra. Uko is the brother of Bernard Zylstra of Toronto's Institute for Christian Studies, whose illness was also diagnosed as stomach cancer.-Ed.) Newsletter*\ntop\nMelvyn P Albright (1945-2020) Chemistry/Missionary/High school teacher\nMel Albright, 75, of Knoxville, TN, formerly of Egg Harbor, NJ, passed away peacefully and into the arms of his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ on July 15, 2020. His message: 'I don't want to be in heaven without you. If you never trusted Christ as your Savior, please receive Him now.'\nMel was born in Norristown, PA, received a chemistry education degree from The King's College formerly of Briarcliff Manor, NY, and a Master of Divinity from the former Biblical Theological Seminary (now Missio Seminary in Philadelphi, PA). He spent 38 years teaching and influencing high school students in both classroom and on field trips at The Pilgrim Academy (NJ), Christian Academy of Knoxville (TN) and Evangelical Christian Academy (Madrid, Spain).\nMel was a member of Cedar Springs Presbyterian Church since 1981, active in Sunday School classes, boys' Stockade, choir, and refugee ministry.. His hobbies include vegetable gardening, fishing, reading maps, traveling, hiking, camping, and European art appreciation. His gifts were teaching, imparting wisdom, helps, and hospitality.\nMel joined the ASA in 1967 as a chemistry student at the King’s College in NY. He served in a leadership role at the Evangelical Christian Academy in Madrid, Spain. With his chemistry background, he maintained an interest and connection to science and faith through the ASA, sharing these views with the high school students to whom he ministered.\ntop\nCraig R. Allen ( -2000) Electronics Engineer.\nJerry Albert reports that on March 4, 2000 Craig R. Allen died after a\nthree-month's convalescence following a stroke last November which left him with right-side paralysis. He was an electronics engineer retired from San Diego's Naval Ocean Systems Center. He received his A.A, from Compton Junior College and his B.S.E.E. from California State Polytechnic College. Craig was a long-time ASA member, faithfully read the journal, and attended many annual meetings with his wife Jackie and was a founder of the southern CA local section.. He is also survived by two sons and a daughter.\nNewsletter*\ntop\nFrank Allen (1874 -1965) Physicist.\nOn November 19, 1965, Dr. Frank Allen, Emeritus Professor of Physics at the University of Manitoba died at the age of 91. He rests from his labours and his works follow him. A descendent of the Tuttles who came from London, England, on the Planter, the vessel following the Mayflower. Frank Allen was born in New Brunswick, his later ancestors having moved into Canada among the United Empire Loyalists. He graduated from the University of New Brunswick in 1895 with highest honours in Physics and Chemistry and a Gold Medal in Latin, and was appointed High School Principal the same year at the remarkably early age of 21. In 1897 he received his M.A. from New Brunswick, in 1900 his A.M. from Cornell, and in 1902 his Ph.D. also from Cornell, the last for work on physiological optics, a subject which interested him for the rest of his life. It might well have been otherwise for at Cornell he became interested in the newly discovered thermionic diode but allowed himself to be dissuaded by his professor from investigating the effect of adding a third or grid, electrode as developed by Lee de Forest a few years later. After a short period of high school teaching, he accepted the founding chair of physics in the new University of Manitoba in 1904 and remained there all his life, serving as Head of the Physics Department until his retirement in 1944. He was elected to Fellowship in the Royal Society of Canada in 1912 and was awarded the Society's H. M. Tory Gold Medal for Scientific Research in 1944.\nOther honours included honorary degrees of the University of Manitoba and the University of New Brunswick, membership in Canada's National Research Council and honorary membership in the Optical Society. On a very small research budget, he and his students enthusiastically undertook research and in his lifetime Professor Allen contributed about 300 research papers, mainly on physics Professor Allen was not only a creative research scientist but also an inspiring teacher. A former student describes his first lecture in Physics thus:\n\"Uneasy and diffident, I climb to the very back, the room fills, the lecture starts . . . The professor talks quietly but even where I am sitting every word is clear. Every now and again he pauses and apparently looking beyond the walls lays a fresh vision before us. Soon I forget my self-consciousness, then myself; the room fades, the very earth becomes but a speck in a great immensity beckoning for study. Within the hour I had become a physicist.\"\nProfessor Allen constantly stressed the importance of science and the excitement of discovery, while for relaxation he delighted to write and converse in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. He joined the ASA in its early days and was elected a Fellow soon afterwards. He contributed the chapter The Witness of Physical Science to the Bible\" to our book \"Modem Science and Christian Faith\" and was the author of ASA Monograph III on \"The Eye as an Optical Instrument\". He was one of the Affiliation's four honorary members. In 1903 he married Sarah Estelle, daughter of D. S Harper.\nHe received a Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1902 and joined the University of Manitoba as Professor of Physics in 1904. He was one of the original six professors at the University of Manitoba. He was elected a member of the Royal Society of Canada in 1909. Allen was awarded an L.L.D. from the University of Manitoba in 1924 and from the University of New Brunswick in 1944. In 1944 he retired as Professor Emeritus from the University of Manitoba. During his esteemed career, he published sixty articles and two critically acclaimed books.\nCustodial history: The academic papers of Professor Frank Allen came into the possession of University of Manitoba Archives & Special Collections in 1979 through the efforts of his daughter Professor Lillian Allen. MSS SC 184 was donated to University of Manitoba Archives & Special Collections in 1990 by Audrey Kerr of the University's Medical Library.\nNewsletter, Brian P.

Genetics.\nBorn\nSeptember 6, 1921,\ndied on\nMarch 9, 2014 in Stillwater, Minnesota. Preceded in death by parents,\nEdwin and Olga Anderson; sister, Virginia and grandson Rowan. Survived\nby wife, Carol; son, Carl Anders on; three daughters, Catherine\n(Jay) Sleiter, Christine (Richard) Anderson- Sprecher, Martha\n(Christopher) Anderson; six grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\nAnderson was born in Stromsburg, NB, worked in his family's funeral home\nbefore enrolling at Bethel Seminary in St. Paul, where he met his wife,\nCarol. At the urging of a professor, he took a class in zoology that\nchanged his life.\nOriginally headed headed for the mission field Elving\nattended (then) Bethel Jr. College. During his second year he was an\nassistant in the Biology Lab. He next enrolled in\nBethel Seminary where he made a (radical) change to a career path in biology. He\ntransferred to the University of Minnesota and earned the\nBS, MS and Ph.D (Zoology) while\nteaching part-time at Bethel. After graduation he served Bethel as head\nof the the biology department, temporary faculty dean and dean of\nstudents. In 1960 he took a post - doc appointment at the NIH in\nWashington to work on study on the inheritance of disease in prenatal\nchildren. Hooked on genetics he made a second radical move to\naccept an offer from his doctoral advisor and joined him the Dight\nInstitute of Genetics and on the University faculty where he had a\ndistinguished career investigating the genetics of breast cancer and\nepilepsy. Years later, he would tell an interviewer: \"I can see\nhow God was leading me step by step into human genetics research.\"\nElving never forgot his Christian roots and lectured\nat many Christian colleges in a period when Christian education was\nemerging from the Bible college period. He joined the ASA and was\nvoted to the ASA Council in 1960. One of his more\nimportant books On Behalf of God:\nA Christian Ethic for Biology\nand an article \"Imaged Through the Lens\nDarkly:\nHuman Personhood\" written with Bruce\nReichenbach for the ETS and his early JASA article: \"Personal Decisions in\nBiomedical Research,\" reflect the wide range of his interests.\nOn\nbehalf of God explored two of the subjects closest to\nhis heart. \"His idea was always that there's no inherent contradiction\nbetween the two,\" said his son, Dr. Carl Anderson, a child psychiatrist\nin New York. In fact, he was entirely at home in both worlds, his family\nsaid, at a time when religious groups and scientists were often in\nconflict. Anderson often found himself in the role of peacemaker, trying\nto help them find common ground, his son said. \"He was really very\ngifted in that.\"\nAnderson's youngest daughter, Martha Anderson, a scientist in Silver\nSpring, Md., said her father was \"quiet and understated\" and would often\ntalk at home about his love of science. \"He was just the consummate\nprofessor,\" she said. \"He was a teacher at work and at home.\"\nPresident of Sigma Xi, American Scientific Affiliation, Behavior Genetics Association, and a founder of the Institute for Advanced Christian Studies.

Tim Wallace, Newsletter.*\ntop\nOliver Barclay (1919-2013) Zoology, UCCF General Secretary, Research Scientists Christian Fellowship\n(later CIS)\nOliver Barclay's career in student ministry took him beyond his original interest in teaching biology in China yet he would play a critical role in developing organizations that sought to relate science and Evangelical Christianity and was an encouraging influence to the \"cousins\" across the water. In appreciation for his pioneering work, with the Research Scientists Christian Fellowship (later Christians in Science) he elected by the ASA as an Honorary Fellow of the ASA. He fostered the 1965 \"select\" meeting of RSCF and ASA in England and general meetings of the organizations in an 1985 meeting at Oxford\nHe was born in Kobe, Japan, on 22 February 1919, the son of Joseph Gurney Barclay (who served with what is now the Church Mission Society). His great grandfather was the MP Thomas Fowell Buxton who campaigned with William Wilberforce as part of the influential Clapham Sect.\nOliver first joined the small IVF team in 1945, having completed a doctorate in zoology. His original hope was to teach in one of China's newer universities, but Douglas Johnson, IVF founding General Secretary (always known as DJ), persuaded him to defer his departure by two years. As Oliver's newly-created role as Assistant Secretary took shape, it soon became clear that the universities of Britain and Ireland would instead be his life's work.\nOliver Barclay served for two years as a wartime President of the Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union (CICCU) and as Chairman of the students' national IVF Executive Committee. From his days in Trinity College, Cambridge, he formed a lifelong friendship with John Stott, also at Trinity, and two years his junior.\nAs Chair of the student national IVF Executive, Oliver was privy to DJ's plans that the IVF should found a Centre for Biblical Research in a university town, to strengthen the roots of the church in the then very liberal Theology faculties of the universities. What would soon become Tyndale House, Cambridge (secured in 1944 and opened in 1945) had originally belonged to a member of the Barclay family. When Oliver heard it was to be sold, he conferred straight away with DJ, as he could see the strategic benefit of its location, close to Ridley Hall and the Cambridge University Library. Financial help from John Laing (later Sir John Laing of J W Laing Construction) and others made the purchase possible, and Tyndale House now hosts one of the finest libraries for biblical research in the world.\nIn 1953, Oliver became the first IVF Universities Secretary, supporting the IVF travelling secretaries [now UCCF staff workers] around the four nations. The liberal hold in the university theology faculties, and in the churches, created much opposition to evangelical influences among students. When news broke in 1954 of the invitation by the CICCU to the US evangelist Billy Graham to lead the 1955 triennial university mission, with John Stott as his Chief Assistant Missioner, The Times carried a lengthy correspondence on the matter. This was of such substance that it was later published (by The Times) as a separate booklet.\nIn 1963 the government's Robbins Report was published, which led to massive expansion in higher education. In 1964 Oliver Barclay succeeded Douglas Johnson as IVF General Secretary. This was the same year his first wife, Dorothy, a consultant surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital (whom he had married in 1949) died of cancer, leaving four children. The following year, Oliver married Daisy Hickey, a family friend.\nOliver Barclay steered the Inter-Varsity Fellowship through its own significant expansion to engage with the times, as new universities and colleges were founded, and as a surge of change swept through societal norms. In 1974, under Dr Barclay's leadership, the IVF office was relocated from Bedford Square in central London to De Montfort Street, Leicester, and in 1975 the movement's name was changed to the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship (UCCF) to reflect the growing work in the polytechnics and colleges of education. Its publishing wing, by then known as Inter-Varsity Press (IVP) was the UK's leading evangelical publishing house.\nOliver Barclay urged clear-thinking evangelical graduates to consider two major directions: to pursue an academic career; or if ordained to apply for vacant churches in university towns. Gradually the tide of liberalism began to turn.\nIn retirement, Dr Barclay continued to serve on the IVP long-range planning group, and was instrumental in the founding of the UCCF Research Council to oversee the work of Tyndale House in Cambridge and the new Whitefield Institute in Oxford. He was co-founder in 1989 of the journal Science and Christian Belief, joint organ of the Victoria Institute and of Christians in Science, formerly the Research Scientists Christian Fellowship, which traced its roots back to a small group of research scientists Oliver had first drawn together in his student days.\nOliver Barclay wrote several books including Evangelicalism in Britain 1935-1995 (IVP, 1997) to which he brought a unique perspective. For some titles he adopted the pseudonym A N Triton. In the 1980s he edited a book series entitled When Christians Disagree himself contributing to the volume on Pacifism and War. Here he showed how, now more informed than in his student years when he espoused the pacifist convictions of his Quaker forebears, he had moved to adopt the Just War theory.\nHe had no formal theological training but developed in himself � and cultivated in his staff � the ability to 'think theologically'. He read through Calvin's Institutes each year and prayed daily for a deeper understanding of the meaning of the death of Christ. He never lost sight of his dual task, to strengthen a witness to Christ both in the student world and among faculty.

Dick's career as cleric-naturalist was more characteristic of the British tradition of the 18th and 19th centuries than than in the USA. Before his second birthday, his parents moved to Tucson, Arizona, where his father had been called to pastor the First Baptist Church. In 1941, he married Wilma Juhree (Billie) Gibbons of Tucson. After graduating from Dallas Theological Seminary in 1941 Richard entered the ministry, first becoming pastor of the Grace Baptist Church of Phoenix, then of the First Baptist Church of Flagstaff, Arizona.\nIn 1947, convinced God had given him gifts for teaching rather than the pastorate, he began a teaching career at Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California. While there, his first son, Richard III, was born. In 1948, he took a teaching position at the San Francisco Baptist College, and began work on a Ph.D. degree at the University of California in entomology. On completing his doctorate, he became a professor of systematic theology at Denver Seminary while searching for a position in biology.

That office belonged to Hessel “Bud” Bouma III, 64, who died on Saturday, May 2, after a brief battle with an aggressive metastatic melanoma. That illumination in DH 221 represented Bouma’s dedication to the institution he served for 36 years. “He was somebody who was disciplined, detail-oriented and hard working,” said Arlene Hoogewerf, chair of the biology department at Calvin College. “If he was in charge of putting something together, he would have done it really, really well.”A leader in his field\nBouma joined the biology department at Calvin College in 1978 after\nreceiving his Ph.D. from the University of Texas and completing a\npostdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Diego.\nHe regularly taught cellular biology courses, but as his interests\nevolved, he took a leadership role with the department, college,\ncommunity and denomination in the field of medical ethics. Bouma published\na book and numerous book chapters and articles considering the\nethics of many current societal issues, including capital\npunishment, genetic testing, human sexuality, reproductive\ntechnologies, end-of-life issues, genetically modified organisms and\nembryonic stem cell research. He regularly taught “Perspectives in\nMedicine” as a capstone course and the non-majors “Human Biology”\ncourse where he developed a Moral Issues Readers that has been used\nboth at Calvin and other universities as a way to help students\nstudy, discuss and make Christ-centered informed moral choices on\nvarious biomedical ethical dilemmas relevant to today’s\nsociety. While Bouma’s expertise on medical ethics was sought after\nby media, church groups, synodical committees and hospital boards,\nhe never lost sight of his primary audience: his students.\nAn encouragement to students\n“He was a kind, understanding and warm man,” said Rebecca Ajuonuma,\na senior organizational communication major, who took a class with\nBouma last summer. “The last day of the summer session was a hectic\none for me. I had to take the third test for the class, my final\nexam, and head to the airport right afterwards. Professor Bouma did\neverything he could to make sure my stress level was reduced. He\neven drove me to the airport because I didn’t have a ride and I was\ngoing to take a taxi.” Erika Steensma, a junior biology major\nremembers the advice Bouma gave her when she agreed to work as a lab\nassistant in his Biology 115 lab: “‘Make sure you take the time to learn\nall of the students names. It really helps to build a connection\nwhen you can call someone by his or her name. And if you see them\noutside of class, make sure to greet them or give them a wave, so\nthat you can start to build relationships with the students.’ This\nwas the approach that Professor Bouma took with his students; he\nreally strove to make each person feel special and cared for.”\n“He was an absolutely remarkably sensitive professor and I often thought he would have made an awesome grandfather,” said Calvin senior biochemistry major Marcia Beare. “He just had that gentle way about him.” “I think one thing that continually amazed me was how he kept track and in contact with a number of students after they graduated,” said Rich Nyhof, a longtime colleague of Bouma’s in the biology department. “When something came up in a department meeting he would say, ‘oh this is what this person is doing now.’ He knew them. He knew the details of their lives. He kept up with a lot of students.”A servant of his colleagues\nAnd while his colleagues remember him as a man who cared for his\nstudents, they also appreciate him for the work he did on their\nbehalf, serving on numerous department-wide (scholarships and\nhospitality) and college-wide (professional status, faculty senate,\nplanning and priorities) committees. “He was really quite a\nservant,” said Hoogewerf. “He would always prepare, always come to\nthose committee meetings having read, done the homework, thought\nabout questions that had to be asked.” “Bud will be deeply missed at\nCalvin College, and I think it will be nearly impossible to replace\nthe unique gifts, talents and perspectives that he brought to our\ndepartment and the rest of the college,” wrote biology professor and\nlongtime friend John Ubels. “He was one professor that left a mark\non my life and I will never forget him. I will miss him greatly,”\nsaid Ajuonuma.\nBud joined the ASA in 1974. He was very active in national meetings and with the local section and published inPSCF.

Chris Beling, a professor of physics at the University of Hong Kong, suffered heart failure as he swam out to rescue his younger brother Jeremy from the sea on June 18. His brother survived but Chris, 54, was pronounced dead at the scene, despite efforts to revive him by his teenage daughter Cathy and paramedics. An inquest will not be held as the death was by natural causes, according to the coroner's office.\nProfessor Beling leaves a widow Evelyn, daughter Cathy and son John. He was the son of retired Paignton vicar David Beling and his wife Anne. The funeral service\nwas held at St Paul's Church. Friends and family from across the world are expected to attend the service of thanksgiving followed by interment at Torquay Cemetery.\nProfessor Beling was educated at Torquay Grammar School and won a scholarship to study physics at Keble College, Oxford, from where he graduated with a first-class honours degree. He later moved to Hong Kong and took a post as assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong where he spent 23 years.\nSon John, a second year physics student at Liverpool University, said, \"My dad not only taught his students with passion, but also wanted them to think critically and challenge their beliefs concerning matters of science and faith and their relationship with Christianity.\" \"My dad became very interested in the theory of intelligent design, which is the assertion or belief that physical and biological systems observed in the universe result from purposeful design by an intelligent being rather than from chance or undirected natural processes. He always tried to voice his opinion on the subject and try to bridge the gap between Christianity and science, believing that science and Christianity were not in conflict with one another\". He added: \"We have received many messages and phone calls after the news of dad's death reached his students. They all said what a passionate professor and lecturer he was, and how much they appreciated his openness for discussion inside and outside lectures.\" \"My dad always made time for his students and sometimes there would be very little family time together. But when we did have it, we appreciated the time we had with him. \"He loved us so much because he really always had our best interests in mind, and always told me the importance of making time for others. He told me to continue to fight for freedom of thought in the scientific community.\" \"My dad saw no conflict between science and Christianity. He loved Jesus with all his life, and even risked his life to save his agnostic brother.\" Chris joined the ASA in 2003.\nMemorial: A Great Loss to the Department of Physics by Professor F C Zhang, Head of Physics\nChris came to Hong Kong from The University College London where he was a lecturer. It was a time when the department had not yet assumed the role it would play in research, and Chris' s active and pioneer studies in positron physics contributed significantly to that transition. His more lasting contribution was the spirit of research in experimental physics that he cultivated in the department, through his mentoring of research students and encouragement to technical staff. Undergraduate students were by no means ignored. Chris' kind and unselfish readiness to interact with them made him a popular teacher. Despite his profound interest and deep understanding of his subject, Chris was one of those of unusual spiritual conviction. It was of no surprise to see him on the opposite side of an argument with colleagues, but his willingness to listen to different voices always ensured respect for his position. In the midst of his hectic schedule,\nChris could always spare time to be a model husband and father. All these incidents truly reflect Chris's outstanding personal qualities devoted, conscientious, kind, hard-working, unassuming, patient and modest. He lacked the slightest hint of arrogance which sometimes characterizes professors, and it was this humility that especially endeared him to all his students and colleagues.\nNewsletter, Memorial.*\ntop\nPaul Bender (1899-1990) Physics\nFrom Goshen, Indiana, born on Jun 26 1899, died on September 13 at age 91.

On to her next adventure.\n*This obituary was originally published in the Star Tribune.\nMarie joined the ASA in 1961 while she was at Northwestern College. She was active in many ways in ASA. The Feb/Mar 1980 ASA Newsletter reports that\n“Once again we had to choose between two outstanding candidates nominated for membership on our five-person Executive Council. The candidate with the smaller number of votes this time was Marie H. Berg, an ASA member since 1961 and a former president of the North Central local section… Marie is the first woman ever nominated for the ASA Executive Council. Of course, we aren't the first organization to overlook the gifts God has given \"the other half\" of the human race… In our churches and in science the situation is equally bad. Among the 200,000 scientists in the 1960 National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel, only 7 percent were women. That proportion was 9 percent in 1970 and is estimated to be about 14 percent in 1980. We're glad to see more women joining our Affiliations and hope we'll see more women in leadership roles in the future. Meanwhile, we're grateful to Marie Berg for standing for this year's council election, for her faithfulness to Jesus Christ, and for the energy she has channeled into ASA causes.”\nThe October 1970 ASA Newsletter reported on the ASA 1970 annual meeting with the accolade “Of course hard-working Marie-Berg (chemistry) was there giving everybody a hand with everything, and then she even wrote up the Convention press release to send to Christian periodicals immediately afterward.”\nIn the March 1971 issue of PSCF, page 28, Marie Berg is quoted as saying “I refuse to look upon the Scriptures as a scientific textbook…” in the section on Reacton and Rebuttal to the “Symposium: The Relationship Between the Bible and Science” which was summarized in the December 1969 issue of JASA, page 27.\ntopPeter G. Berkhout MD (1895-1966)\nPhysician was killed instantly on 19 July 1966 in the Colorado Rockies when his car plunged off the road and was dashed against a boulder 30 feet below. Mrs. Berkhout, who was driving, was unhurt, their 16-year old daughter was treated for shock. Dr. Berkhout, the only occupant of the car not wearing a seatbelt was thrown out and crushed between the car and boulder. Dr. Berkhout had practiced medicine in Paterson, New Jersey, for 33 years and was an outstanding leader in community affairs and in the Christian Reformed church. He was a trustee of Calvin College and active in the affairs of the New York section of the ASA.\nHoward Mattson puts it this way: \"We will miss him here. He had been active in ASA affairs since the local chapter was formed, and he was elected to our executive committee this year. He had also been active in the Christian Reformed churches in the area with discussions on 'The Bible of Nature'. He used the term to include \"all that God has revealed to us outside the Scriptures.\" He further maintained that we are wrong in our tendency to throw out anything which science discovers that appears to be out of harmony with what we find in Scripture; that we should no more be dogmatic here than with the \"apparent contradictions\" we find in Scripture itself. In sum, he said: \"Let us not be satisfied until we have put all (the truths and facts the Bible of Nature offers us) into the framework of the Holy Bible. *\ntop\nGeorge J.

George got his BSEE from Purdue U. in 1951 and a Th.M. from Dallas Seminary in 1957. George was first introduced to ASA by Hendrick Oorthuys at Purdue. George considered that ASA's main effort should be to deal with issues and work with students. His wife of 44 years died in 2000.\nE. Paul Arveson.\ntop\nAllen H. Bilderback (1915-2002) Pastor, Missionary, Social Worker\nBorn Nov. 3, 1915 in Seattle, WA and passed away February 23, 2002\nin Tacoma, WA. Graduate of Lincoln High School, Seattle Pacific University and the University of Washington. Twenty-five-year ASA veteran Allen Bilderback died of pneumonia at age 87. He was a Free Methodist missionary to Burundi, then pastor and finally social worker.\nHis favorite article in\nJASA (predecessor of Perspectives) was Edward Kessel's \"A Proposed Biological Interpretation of the Virgin Birth\" (Sept. 1983). He found the possible explanation of parthenogenesis liberating and handed out many copies of this article in his Sunday school class. His son Don Bilderback comments: As an amateur scientist and a student of the Scriptures, dad found many connections between science and faith issues that I've never heard others talk about. His astronomical dating of the book of Revelation from the vision of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in Rev. 6:1-8 is unique. He interpreted the vision in terms of planets and constellations, making the ordinary assumptions for the story of the stars known for thousands of years. He concluded that the vision was seen around Nov. 4, 96 AD plus or minus 10 days (Allen Bilderback,\nRevelation and Apocalyptic Symbols [Puyallup, WA: Valley Press, 1991], partially online at www.lightlink.com/donald). He interpreted Ezekiel's vision of wheels as halos around the Sun due to refraction of light from ice crystals... Dad gave a paper on these findings at one of the ASA annual meetings (Eastern U. in PA, I believe) and the material was received as being on the\ncutting edge.Bio.*\ntop\nJohn C. W.

Awarded a life membership by the Assoc. of Midwestern Biology Teachers in 1978. Served as President Nebraska Academy of Science 1965-66. He was born March 10, 1913 in Waterloo, Iowa to August and Caroline (Kolm) Bliese. He graduated from East Waterloo High School in 1931 and received his bachelor degree in biology from Iowa State Teachers College in 1935. He received a masters degree from Columbia University in 1936, and his doctorate in economic zoology from Iowa State College in 1953. He also receive additional schooling at the University of Southern California, the University of Michigan, State University of Iowa, Colorado State College and the University of Colorado.\nHe taught biology and physical sciences at Cedar Falls High School and at Teachers College High School, both in Cedar Falls, Iowa.\nHe was an instructor of biological sciences at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, and Iowa State College in Ames. He moved to Kearney, NE, in 1953 where he was a full-time biology professor at Kearney State College until retiring in 1983. He served as head of the biology department from 1962 to 1966. The John C.

Buried in Kearney Cemetery, Buffalo Co., NE*\nRex Vernon Blumhagen (1920-2012) MD\nOf West Chicago IL.\nRex Vernon Blumhagen, who later in life helped start the emergency room at Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield, brought health care to rural areas of Afghanistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. With a fearless sense of adventure and an approachable personality, Dr. Blumhagen made inroads in remote regions where people rarely had access to health care. \"My father was unbelievably friendly with people,\" said his daughter Susan Fullerton. \"He could never speak the language in Afghanistan, but he could always communicate by his manner and his friendliness and his sheer ability to connect with people.\" Dr. Blumhagen, 92, died of malignant melanoma on Friday, Feb. 24, 2012 at his home in West Chicago, his daughter said.\nHe was born in Montana and grew up in Washington state, receiving a bachelor's degree from Whitworth College in Spokane, Wash. There he met his wife, Jeanne, to whom he was married in 1943. Dr. Blumhagen was in the Army during World War II and received his medical degree from Northwestern University in 1946.\nHe was enamored with Afghanistan from a young age. After medical school, he worked with the Frontier Nursing Service in Kentucky, caring for the poor in rural Appalachia. \"He felt that Kentucky would be good training for the rural medical world,\" his daughter said. After working first at a county hospital in California and then in private practice in Madera, Calif.,\nDr. Blumhagen went to Afghanistan in 1960. He worked as a doctor in the U.S. Embassy, treating the American community in Kabul. He remained in Kabul for four years, returning to California briefly before signing up to work with a nongovernmental organization in Afghanistan that providing medical care in rural areas. He worked to establish clinics and a hospital in the countryside. \"He was just so adventurous,\" his daughter said. \"When they first went there, they bought an old school bus and they would drive all over the country on these tiny little roads and would set up a clinic in a town. The people there had absolutely no medical care, so when he would come they would just flock to him.\" What Dr. Blumhagen lacked in language skills, he could not speak Persian or Pashto he made up for with a winsome personality. As a term of respect and endearment, Afghans would call the bearded Dr. Blumhagen \"Whitebeard,\" his daughter said. In 1973, with the overthrow of Afghanistan's monarch and growing Islamic power, Dr. Blumhagen and his wife were ejected from the country. They returned to the U.S. and settled near their children in Wheaton, and he became one of Central DuPage Hospital's founding emergency room doctors.\n\"Emergency was the best place for him, since he had been away and in a place like Afghanistan where he had exposure to doing all different kinds of medicine that people in the States hadn't been doing,\" his daughter said. Wheaton real estate agent Mary Kane, who was the office manager for the hospital's emergency room in the 1970s, recalled Dr. Blumhagen's caring manner with patients and his enthusiastic interest in others. \"The thing that always bothered him the most was if a parent wasn't taking care of their children,\" Kane said. \"He was emphatic about that.\" Dr. Blumhagen retired from Central DuPage Hospital in 1986. He and his wife subsequently started an\ncare clinic, Stratford Urgent Care, in Bloomingdale, IL. He had been an\nASA member for the past 15 years. Chicago Tribune.*\ntop\nJohn L.

He had served on the ASA Executive Council from 1968-72, was a consulting editor for the ASA's Journal for many years, and was president when ASA employed its first full-time executive secretary. At the 1987 Colorado Springs Meeting, he gave a paper and first felt a symptom of the cancer that took his life a year and a half later.\nBorn in Adria, Washington, Don grew up in Fillmore, California. When he was\nfifteen, his mother and a sister were among the 600 flood victims\nwhen the St. Francis dam burst. Perhaps that influenced him to study geology. After a year at Biola, he\ntransferred to Wheaton College. In 1938, he graduated and married\nBetty Baillie, went on for an M.S. at the U. of Iowa and a Ph.D. at\nWisconsin. Don was a member of many professional societies and a\nFellow of the Geological Society of America reconstructed by Don and students over an 11 year period Don Boardman was a born teacher. He\ntaught geology at Wheaton College from 1940 to 1979, with 1942-46 out for service in the Pacific in WWII. On Saipan he was \" president\"\nof \"Saipan U.,\" teaching illiterate enlisted personnel to read and write despite opposition from bigoted Navy brass.\nBack at Wheaton, he chaired the Geology Dept. for many years and directed the Wheaton Science Station in South Dakota's Black Hills (where ASA held its Annual Meeting in 1952). On leave from Wheaton in 1959-60, he went to Peshawar, Pakistan, as a SEATO Professor to establish a department geology. In 1974-75 he went back to the same department as a Fulbright Professor, driving from Germany to Pakistan and back, 6,800 miles way, camping more than half the nights. (Betty: \"An interesting and entertaining man to be married to.\") Don was active in the College Church and at times in Wheaton politics. In the late '60s and throughout the '70s the Boardmans threw their support behind inner-city LaSalle Community Church in Chicago. When Don retired in 1979, they moved to San Diego and became active in Rancho Bernardo Community Presbyterian Church. They celebrated their 47th wedding anniversary in England at the ASA Oxford Meeting, with the whole family on hand. The family was together again at Lake Tahoe in August 1988 to celebrate their Golden Anniversary. Don leaves three children: science teacher Ann Hein (Mrs. Robert H.), a second-generation ASA member; Barbara, married to Richard Herd, geologist and CSCA member, Donald, Jr.; and six grandchildren.

Brackbill (1891-1962)\nMathematics Professor emeritus of mathematics at Eastern Mennonite College, died Sep. 18, 1962. Professor Brackbill was born May 11, 1891, near Lancaster, Pa., the son of Aldus and Lizzie Brackbill. He received a BA at Hesston College and a BS and MA in astronomy at the University of Virginia. He also took graduate work in astronomy at the Universities of Kansas and Michigan. He was married to Ruth Mininger in 1932 and she preceded him in death on April 30, 1962. They had no children. Professor Brackbill joined the faculty of Eastern Mennonite College in 1919. He taught a wide variety of courses ranging from agriculture to zoology in the fledgling institution. He was appointed head of the department which he designated\nPhysastromath and was chairman of the Division of Natural Sciences until he suffered a stroke in Jan. 1956 which ended his teaching career.\nHe joined the ASA in 1949 and later was elected to the grade of fellow. He served as host to the 9th convention which met on the EMC campus in 1954. Although most of his education was in mathematics and astronomy, his special interest in literature and ability in speech was demonstrated in many ways. His reading of Dickens A Christmas Carol became an annual treat to the student body. He cherished the idea that the Bible, being the word of God, possesses supreme literary quality; however his ultimate concern in the scriptures was spiritual and not merely literary. He saw beauty in mathematics, particularly geometry, and was deeply interested in the integration of scientific knowledge and the scriptures. A classroom discussion of a neat mathematical concept was often the cue for the interpretative reading of a corresponding scriptural gem.\nHis laboratory was a maze of intriguing wires and hand-made gadgets which aroused students curiosity. He delighted in collecting simple toys with a lot of physics in them, such as dunking ducks, topsy-turvy, etc. He had little faith in ordinary toggle switches, and being endowed with dry skin, he was unable to understand or appreciate the apprehension of many of his students at the use of open knife switches on 110 volts A. C. Because of a perennially small budget, he made much of the demonstration apparatus. The only recompense for these hundreds of hours in the shop was a sort of fierce satisfaction in having made something better and for less cost then from Cenco.\nM. T. Brackbill's greatest interest in life began in 1910 when he saw Halleys comet. Of this experience he wrote in characteristic fashion, Saw Halleys comet in the early morning beyond the barn in the southeast. Not having read the newspaper I missed the privilege of being badly frightened by the alarming new. � His fascination by astronomy increased with the purchase of a 2-inch telescope in 1929. In 1930 he founded the Astral Society, a student extracurricular club with six charter members. In 1934 he published the Astra-Guide, a 13-inch adjustable planisphere. M. T. Brackbill was an imaginative writer, particularly in the area of popular astronomy. Among his publications are the following:\nHeaven and the Glory of the Sunset (Mennonite Publishing House, Scottdale, Pa., 1924), 45 pp.\nChristian Companion (YCC), a series of articles in 1937-38. (Mennonite Publ. House). Evenings with the Stars, 1943-44; reprinted as a booklet, 1945 (Mennonite Publ. House).\nStars from Starrywood, YCC Series in 1948-50. JASA, Vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 22-27, March 1951.\nIf the Stars Appeared Only One Night in a Thousand Years, The Sky, Vol. 1, no. 10, p. 15, Oct. 1937.\nSky and Telescope, Vol. 2, no. 11, p. 15, Sep. 1943. The Heavens Declare (Moody Press, Chicago, 1959), 128 pp.\nThrough his persistence and charm he was able to develop astronomical facilities at the college second in the state only to those at the University of Virginia. The existence of Vesper Heights Observatory, the Astral Hall, and associated instruments valued at over $25,000 in the frugal economy of the eastern Mennonite constituency is an amazing tribute to his ability to communicate his love of the stars to laymen. Professor Brackbill was a poetic and imaginative soul. Scientific facts could not remain cold fish to him but were manifestations of the glory of God and fit subjects to be rhapsodized upon in verse. A sample of his whimsical verse is given below. He was truly a celestial citizen and his ability to transcend ones thoughts from the mundane materialistic to the glories of the heavenly will be missed by those who knew him. Robert\nC.

After\ncompleting two semesters of linguistic training offered by the\nSummer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) at the University of Oklahoma,\nHank and Bobbi joined Wycliffe Bible Translators and went to Mexico\nin 1955 to translate the Bible for the Mixtec Indians of southern\nMexico.\nOver the next 25 years, along with the help of about\n15 local Mixtec men, Hank and Bobbi completed the translation of the\nNew Testament into the Jicaltepec dialect of Mixteco. With the New\nTestament in their language, the Mixtec church grew from less than a\nhandful of believers to several thousand believers in about 20 or so\ndifferent congregations, reaching to all the villages where the\nlanguage is spoken. The Mixtec church is now well into its third\ngeneration of believers.\nDuring this time Hank and Bobbi also\ndid a number of other things related to their work among the Mixtecs.\nThese included earning advanced degrees in linguistics and\nanthropology, serving their colleagues in Mexico in a variety of\nelected and appointed positions, and teaching linguistics and\ntranslation skills to aspiring Bible translators each summer at one\nor another of the Summer Institutes of Linguistics sponsored by\nWycliffe. Hank also taught anthropology at Judson College in Elgin,\nIL for a period of six years when he and Bobbi needed to be in the\nUS. After that time Hank was asked to serve as the international\nanthropology coordinator for Wycliffe and SIL in Dallas, which he\ndid for nine years. He was also asked to help in a special situation\nin Southeast Asia, which he did for another three years.\nIn\nAugust 1999, several years after Bobbi’s diagnosis with leukemia,\nHank and Bobbi moved to Wheaton to be near their sons and\ngrandchildren. They retired from active status with Wycliffe in\n2001. Bobbie died July 28, 2001.\nOn August 16, 2003, Hank\nmarried Grace E. Woodberry, a Wheaton College classmate whose\nparents served on the mission field in China.\nThrough the\nintervening years Hank never forgot the Mixtec people in Jicaltepec,\nMexico, and when the younger believers there decided in the mid\n2000’s that they would like to translate the Old Testament into\ntheir language, Hank was pleased to assist them. He served as a\nconsultant for a team of Mixtec national translators. That work is\nnot yet complete, but the Mixtec translators are carrying on. In\nHank’s own words, “This latest development shows how far they have\ncome in their educational and spiritual growth in the last 20+ years\nsince we lived there.”\nHe is survived by his wife, Grace; his\nfive sons, Charles \"Brad\" (Pamela) Bradley, Jr. of Wheaton, IL, Dave\n(Karen) Bradley of Kenya, Africa, Mark (Sarah) Bradley of Wheaton,\nIL, Eric (Mitzi) Bradley of Elgin, IL and Scott (Debbie) Bradley of\nWheaton, IL; 19 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.\nHe joined ASA in 1962 and was a lifetime member. . Hultgrenfh Obituary,\ntop\nWalter L. Bradley (1943-2025) Engineering\nWalter L. Bradley December 27, 1943 went to be with the Lord peacefully on July 2, 2025, at the age of 81. Walter was born on December 27, 1943, in Dallas and grew up in Corpus Christi, TX. He attended the University of Texas, where he earned both a B.S. and a Ph.D. in Engineering and Materials Science in 1968. While in Austin, he met his wife and lifelong companion, Carol Ann James, to whom he was married for 60 years.\nWalter was an internationally recognized Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at three universities. He had a profound impact on the lives of many—on campus, in the community, and in broader society. Alongside a distinguished professional and service career, Walter prioritized people and was known for his kindness and genuine interest in others, which led to many friendships and mentoring relationships across the United States and around the world.\nWalter served as a Mechanical Engineering faculty member for over 45 years at the Colorado School of Mines, Texas A&M University, and Baylor University, achieving tenure by the age of 27. He was an internationally recognized professor who pioneered work in metallurgy, composite materials, polymers, and natural composites. Walter advised 41 M.S. theses and 17 Ph.D. dissertations, with his former students making significant contributions at universities and industries across the country.\nAt the same time, Walter was a leading voice on the connections between faith and science. He spoke at hundreds of universities across the U.S. and coauthored, with Roger Olsen and Charles Thaxton, the seminal book The Mystery of Life’s Origin, which remains in publication today. He was also one of the founding professors of Campus Crusade for Christ’s (CRU) Faculty Commons ministry, pioneering ways for faculty to effectively share their Christian faith on college campuses.\nHe joined the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) in 1973 after learning of the organization from a friend and the Journal of the ASA. He became an ASA Fellow and served on the ASA Executive Council from 2005-2010. Walter was an avid and active advocate for science and faith in the ASA, giving countless talks at universities and conferences.\nWalter’s first two articles published in the Journal of the ASA were “Problems of Chemical Evolution Not Solved by Prigogine” in 1979 and “Thermodynamics and the Origin of Life” in 1988. These two topics continued to be his interest and emphasis throughout his life. Walter was a regular attendee of the ASA Annual Meetings and gave talks at seven of them from 2007 to 2018. In 2013 he published a Communication in PSCF on “Science and Technology in Service of the Poor: The Case of the Coconut” which reflected his passion to advocate for coconut oil as a positive health product. He published one more article in PSCF on “The Fine Tuning of the Universe: Evidence for the Existence of God?” which lead to a published exchange of letters with Randy Isaac. That dialog led to an invited exchange with Walter and Randy at the 2019 ASA Annual Meeting on “Fine-Tuning of the Universe and Methodological Naturalism,” of which the audio is still available.\nWalter was best known for his work on origins, emphasizing issues of thermodynamics. His work laid the groundwork for Bill Dembski and Steve Meyer to elucidate the concepts of Intelligent Design. More than that, he was renown for his energy and enthusiasm coupled with a warmth and friendship with everyone, independent of their viewpoint. He loved to engage with people at every opportunity.\nAfter retiring from Baylor, Walter and Ann relocated to Georgetown, TX, where they continued to speak at conferences and teach in local churches. Walter and Ann were not ones to sit still for long; they traveled extensively and regularly entertained visitors at their home.\nFamily was at the heart of Walter’s life. He took immense pride in his family. Walter dedicated countless hours to supporting their pursuits and celebrating their milestones. Most importantly, he sought to nurture and encourage the faith of his children and grandchildren, guiding them toward a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ through his example, wisdom, and steadfast love. His legacy of faith continues to inspire his family to walk closely with the Lord.\nHe is survived by his loving wife, Ann; his two children, seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.\nMemorials may be made to:\n● Faculty Commons, CRU’s faculty ministry\n● Greater Love, an India orphanage and school supported by Walter and Ann\n● Baylor University Student Scholarship (go to “Search Funds” and select “Dr. Walter Bradley Polymer and Materials Science Endowed Fund\")\nPaul Brand (1914-2003) Medical Doctor\nWhen Dr. Paul Brand met his first leprosy patients, he was told, \"Nothing can be done with hands - or feet - or faces like this. It's just leprosy.\" Translation: You can't fight the inevitable. But \"just leprosy\" was not in Brand's vocabulary. He found leprosy deformities were correctable; he performed surgeries on thousands, and taught his skills to others who outlive him. He died July 8. Brand saw the body as God's ally in healing. He declared: I have come to realize that every patient ..., every newborn baby, in every cell of its body, has a basic knowledge of how to survive and how to heal, that exceeds anything that I shall ever know ... God ... has made our bodies more than we could ever have devised. His med. school professors called the thymus a \"vestigial organ\" whose usefulness humans had outgrown. Brand commented: Today we can see from the victims of AIDS, that people cannot survive without those immune cells from the thymus and bone marrow. A lot of biologists still cling to the idea of evolution by chance, and now it is scientists from mathematics, information theory and computers that are forcing us to recognize that chance alone cannot possibly account for the code of DNA and the wonders of life. All of science points toward a creator.\nBrand spoke at ASA's 1993 Annual Meeting at Seattle Pacific U., presenting Sunday morning worship and Monday devotions. Carol Aiken recalls, \"He so impressed me that I went to the book-store and bought his book for my daughter who was in Gordon College. at that time.\"\nBrand was knighted Commander of the Order of the British Empire. But CRISTA president Jim Gwinn pays an even higher tribute: \"To know Paul Brand is to know Christ better. He evidenced his compassion, grace and mercy to all.\" In a final expression of frugality and modesty, he chose to be buried in a plain plywood box with the lid nailed shut. His last message was, \"Only one life, 'twill soon be past. Only what's done for Christ will last.\" For further reading: \"Noted Surgeon and Author Paul Brand Dies at Age 89\",\nChristianity Today, Breakpoint*\nRaymond H Brand (1928-2020) Biology\nRaymond Howard Brand, age 91, a resident of Windsor Park in Carol Stream, Illinois, died May 23, 2020, at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield, Illinois. Ray was the beloved husband for 62 years to Shirley.\nRay was born in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up attending Ward Presbyterian Church. Even as a child he researched animals and made collections of insects. He pursued his love of biology at Wheaton College while working at various jobs, playing varsity tennis and soccer, and courting Shirley, a literature major. They married in 1951, as Ray began graduate work. He first earned an MA in zoology, then received an MS in biological science from the University of Michigan, going on to complete work on the ecology of small mammal populations for his PhD in animal ecology. Starting in 1955, he spent four years as the chairman of the biology department of Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California, teaching in an old two-car garage that served as the biology building until the campus was further developed. In 1959 he returned to Wheaton College and subsequently spent over thirty years teaching there, during that period chairing the Department of Biology and Division of Science and always sharing his love of nature and field research with his students as a professor of biology until his retirement in 1993.\nRay joined the ASA in 1952 while he was a graduate student. He would remain an active life-long member for 68 years, contributing leadership and warm friendship to all. After he came to Wheaton, he was co-chair of the Chicago-area section of the ASA and was elected an ASA Fellow. In 1985 he presented a paper at the ASA annual meeting in Oxford, England. The paper was published as an article titled “At the Point of Need” in PSCF. In 1987 he was program chair for the annual 1987 ASA meeting at Colorado College on the theme “Global Resources and the Environment.” Ray was on the editorial board of PSCF, a member of the 1964 joint ASA/ETS committee, and was chair of the Global Resources & Environment Commission. He served on the ASA Executive Council from 1992 to 1997. At the 1991 annual meeting at Wheaton College, celebrating ASA’s 50th anniversary, Ray and Shirley put together an impressive historical display of ASA memorabilia. In 2019, Ray attended the public lecture at the recent ASA annual meeting at Wheaton College where he was recognized as the distinguished longest standing member in attendance. His friendly smile and words of encouragement inspired many of us.\nThroughout his career, he continued to conduct environmental research, and while collecting samples of springtails in the restored prairies of the Chicago suburbs, he discovered a new species of the arthropod. Ray wrote and published many articles about environmental issues in Illinois. He was a research associate at the Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Illinois, until 2018, and coauthored two books: Whatever Happened to Eden? (1980) and Redeeming Creation: The Biblical Basis for Environmental Stewardship (1996).\nHe enjoyed playing tennis and participating in book clubs well into his eighties, but his greatest passions were his humanitarian interests, following and contributing extensively to over a dozen organizations, including Immanuel Presbyterian Church, the ASA, the Salvation Army, Habitat for Humanity, Doctors without Borders, the National Wildlife Foundation, the American Red Cross, AARP Foundation, National Parks Foundation, National Resource Defense Council, Defenders of Wildlife, Environment Illinois, University of Michigan Sigma X, and the Alzheimer’s Association.\nIn recent years, he was proud of establishing the fountains at his home at Covenant Living Windsor Park in memory of his wife, Shirley, and contributing to the purchase of the Immanuel Presbyterian transportation van so Covenant residents could attend worship on Sundays.\ntop\nDavid S.

Bube, one of the most prominent contributors to the ASA and the study of the relationship between science and Christian faith, passed away on June 9, 2018 at the age of 90. He was Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. A memorial service has been scheduled for 7:30 p.m. in the evening of Tuesday, July 10, at Foothill Covenant Church (1555 Oak Ave., Los Altos, CA).\nBorn on August 10, 1927 in Providence, RI, \"Dick\" received his Sc.B. degree in Physics from Brown University in 1946 and his Ph.D. in Physics from Princeton University in 1950. Between 1948 and 1962 he was a member of the research staff at the RCA David Sarnoff Research Laboratories in Princeton, NJ. He joined the faculty of Stanford University in 1962, serving 30 years as Professor in the departments of Materials Science and Electrical Engineering until his retirement in 1992. From 1975 to 1986 he was Chairman of the Department of Materials Science. His research was concerned with the photoelectronic properties of materials, including photoconductivity, luminescence, photovoltaic effects, semiconductors, and solar energy conversion. Dr. Bube is the author of six scientific books and over 300 research publications, and 56 Ph.D. students earned their degrees under his direction. In 1948, he married the first love of his life, Betty Jane, and they had four children, Mark, Ken, Sherri, and Merry. Their loving marriage lasted over 48 years until Betty Jane was called home to her Lord in 1997. In 2000, he met and married the second love of his life, Mary Anne. Mary Anne and Dick have shared over 18 loving years together.\nAt the age of 11, he heard a clear presentation of the Christian Gospel through the ministry of St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church in Providence. He wrote, \"My heart said 'Yes' to God almost immediately, and I began my walk with Christ as one for whom he had died and risen again.\" His whole life reflected this commitment. He was known for his gentle and patient spirit as he sought to encourage people to grow in their faith and understanding. He worshiped most recently at Foothill Covenant Church in Los Altos and the Palo Alto Christian Reformed Church. He has taught adult education classes at numerous churches, and has lectured on science and Christianity at over 60 colleges and universities.\nAs he contemplated his passing, he wrote, \"Trusting that death is but one stage in God's plan for me through Jesus Christ, I enter into this new adventure holding firmly to my Lord and Savior.\" He is survived by his loving wife, Mary Anne, his four children and five grandchildren.\nAs both a dedicated Christian and a dedicated scientist, he wrote seven books and over 100 articles on issues in science and Christianity. Seeing no conflict between genuine science and authentic Christianity, he strove to help scientists understand Christianity and help Christians understand science. He was a faculty sponsor for the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship at Stanford University and taught an Undergraduate Seminar at Stanford on the interaction between science and Christianity for 25 years.\nHe was a Fellow of the American Scientific Affiliation, a society of scientists who are Christians, serving as editor of the Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation (JASA) from 1969 to 1983.

Roger was one of ASA's Newletter Editor Walt Hearn's biochemistry students at Baylor University He recommended Roger to colleague R. Guillernin who subsequently shared the 1977 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine (for unraveling the structure of the first \"brain hormone\") with rival scientist Shalley, and also with Rosemary Yalow. Burgus was instrumental in key achievements needed to win the prize. The story is told in more detail in Nicholas Wade's book,\nThe Nobel Dual: Two scientists' 21 year race to win the world's most coveted research prize, Anchor Doubleday, 1981. After the Prize, the book states, in the chapter called \"Parting of the Ways\": With all the praise he was getting for the work on GIF and the other releasing factors, he [Guillemin] seemed to forget, or perhaps he remembered too well, the extent to which his colleagues had helped achieve these successes. \"Before his operation, he would understand the debt he owed to someone like Burgus, but after he had received so much of the credit Burgus should have gotten, time after time, award after award, he just seemed to forget, and started to relax in his attitude toward Burgus,\" says a member of the group. [p. 247].\nThe book includes a photograph, of Roger and even acknowledges his religious faith (while going out of its way to avoid using the word \"Christian\") In its opening chapters,\nThe Nobel Duel also describes Walter Hearn's role as the first biochemist to work with physiologist Roger Guillemin on the problem (at Baylor medical school). That work began in 1954.\nLater, at Iowa State University, Roger did his Ph.D. research under Hearn on an entirely different problem. At the end of the book, after chronicling the break-up of Guillemin's group soon after the Prize was awarded, the author says that Burgus \"became more interested in the long-held religious beliefs which his biochemistry professor, Walt Hearn, had helped reawaken. He studied religious healing, and was himself the beneficiary of a process in which it happened that his sight, which had been partially lost in his left eye, was restored.\nThe Nobel Duel is a model of accurate, fascinating science writing. Scientific investigations seldom have as much drama as that particular one, and Christians seldom have an opportunity to play such a crucial role. Schally is quoted as saying that Burgus \"did tremendous, beautiful work. A lot of credit for what was done at the Salk Institute must go to Burgus. Guillemin used Burgus and gave him very little credit.\" Guillemin is quoted as saying, \" Burgus is one of those people who is the salt of the earth, Burgus and honesty are the same word.\" At one point \"Dr. Burgus tells of the time when he was sequencing an unknown protein and his vacuum system started leaking- -If air got at my unknown, it would have oxidized it. and weeks of work would be lost. I prayed pretty hard there. and immediately the vacuum was restored. How many times does a high vac system heal itself? I consider that a miraculous intervention of the Holy Spirit.\"\nIn mid-1977 Burgus left the Salk Institute and moved to the medical school of Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma,\" where he was head of the school's peptide structure laboratory. Burgus was a professor of biochemistry at the medical school of Oral Roberts University in Tulsa for over ten years. A Sept 1989 announcement that the entire medical complex would close down, caught him by surprise. Most of the med students found places in other schools, but many faculty members were simply out of work. A toxicology lab Roger ran continued to do drug testing for a few outside clients after the Nov 1989 closure, but it, too, soon shut down. When we (Hearn) talked to him, Roger was pondering what God wanted him to do, with research or consulting among the possibilities. His wife Jackie's opportunities for writing and speaking on spiritual renewal have grown beyond the U.S. and both were open to serving Christ overseas. Roger says that the peace he has about the situation really \"passes understanding-just like the Bible promises.\" Burgus, R., Ling, N., Butcher, M., and Guillemin, R. 1973. Proc. Nat. Acad.

Russ Bush (1944-2008) Philosophy\nAfter a two-year battle with cancer, L. Russ Bush III, noted philosopher, apologist, author, professor, pastor and friend of Southern Baptists, went to be with the Lord on Tuesday evening January 22, 2008. Bush, who was born in 1944, spent his life serving the church, the Southern Baptist Convention and the greater evangelical community in a number of capacities. He served most recently at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C., as the Director of the L. Russ Bush Center for Faith and Culture and as Distinguished Professor of Philosophy of Religion. His time at Southeastern marked a turning point in the leadership of the institution, and his contributions to the academic environment of Southeastern will continue on. When he first began at Southeastern, during the presidency of Lewis A. Drummond, Bush was one of the few conservative voices at the institution. Due in large part to his direction of the faculty, Southeastern was able to band together for the cause of reclaiming a sound theological heritage. Bush wrote\nThe Advancement: Keeping the Faith in an Evolutionary Age (Broadman & Holman, 2003) .\nIn 1980, at the beginning of the \"conservative resurgence\" in the Southern Baptist Convention, Bush and (fellow professor at the time) Tom Nettles wrote Baptists and the Bible, a book which called for the return to Biblical inerrancy as a core belief of the denomination. \"Russ Bush was a champion and faithful warrior for the cause of Christ and the Gospel,\" said Daniel Akin, president of Southeastern. \"His work Baptists and\nthe Bible was a landmark in the battle for the Bible that engulfed our denomination. Its impact is still being felt today.\" \"Their book was timely, urgent, controversial and filled with ample documentation,\" said Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. \"It changed history - quite literally\".\nAt the time of Bush's appointment as academic vice president and Dean of the Faculty at Southeastern, Paige Patterson, current president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, said Southeastern \"was undergoing a metamorphosis as it returned to the faith of its fathers.\" \"Bush accepted the responsibility ...even though the entire faculty voted against the appointment,\" Patterson said. \"It was one of the most incredibly difficult times anyone could have ever gone through. He was cursed ... and accosted ... By the time I arrived at Southeastern some years later, I discovered that he had won over the hearts even of those who were his bitterest enemies.\" David Dockery, president of Union University in Jackson, Tenn., said, \"No one will ever fully know all that Russ Bush did to keep the doors of Southeastern Seminary open during the turbulent years of transition in the late 1980s and the early 1990s.\"\nIn more recent times, Bush's guidance was instrumental in developing the Center for Faith and Culture, an initiative to connect culture and the church by being an example of a redeemed community. The Center was named for Bush during its creation in 2006, because he \"embodies the vision of, and models the ministry of, this Center.\" In October of 2007, Bush and the Center brought together the culture and the church as Southeastern hosted a conference on \"C.S. Lewis: The Man and His Works.\" \"Russ Bush was my teacher, colleague and friend. He was a man of absolute integrity and a consistent witness to the Christ he loved so dearly\" Akin said. \"My love and respect for him goes beyond words. I will miss him, but I rejoice knowing I will see him again in glory.\" Bush is survived by his wife of 39 years, Cynthia Ellen.

Norman Carlson (1922 - 1993) Metallurgy.\nProfessor of metallurgy at Iowa State University, Ames, died at 72 years on Friday 10 Sep 1993. Former Newsletter editor Walter Hearn, who was also a professor at ISU, thinks he might have recruited Norm into the ASA. Carlson was internationally known for his work on high-purity metals (especially vanadium), phase equilibria and mass transport in solids, having published more than 120 papers, two books and chapters of others - another full and productive scientific career. A native of rural Mitchell, South Dakota (home of the Corn Palace), he got his bachelor's degree at nearby Yankton College in 1943 and his doctorate in chemistry at ISU in 1950.\nWhat brought Norm to ISU was the Manhattan Project (1943-1945), which Norm reflected on in an Ames Laboratory\nNewsletter interview in 1984: \"The lab was an exciting place to be in the early years, particularly for a young scientist. The morale was high; it was an important and exciting mission. We were on the forefront of a new and rapidly developing field. Nuclear engineering was a `fair-haired boy' and it was prestigious to work in the field.\" During a forum on Hiroshima a year later, Norm said he \"believed the time will come when we will see that nuclear energy can be a blessing to mankind.\" No sooner had he graduated at ISU than Norm joined the chemistry faculty, only to be appointed chairman of the newly formed Department of Metallurgy. Later in 1961, he was made chief of the metallurgy division of Ames Laboratory, where he continued his work after retirement in 1987. A colleague, Jack Smith, said some kind words about Norm: \"He was just a very fine individual, very conscientious about his work. He stayed at it. ... He was the kind of guy that was easy to get along with. He was well-liked.\" Besides membership in societies in his field, Norm was yet another Sigma Xi member and was involved in community service. A long-time member of the Bethesda Lutheran Church, he served on the Foundation Board of University Lutheran and was also on the Board of Regents of Waldorf College.\n*Virginia Carlson, Walt Hearn\nRichard Eugene Carlson (1934-2020) Veterinarian/Otolaryngologist\nDick Carlson passed away early morning on Friday, July 17th at Family Life Memory Care in Nampa, Idaho after a courageous battle with Parkinson's disease. Dick was born on November 11, 1934 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the eldest son of Iner and Elizabeth Carlson. He grew up on a farm in Sandstone, Minnesota, and he was active in Future Farmers of America and played trumpet in the high school band. After graduating from Sandstone High School, he went to the University of Minnesota, where he earned a bachelor's degree followed by a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine in 1958 – the same year he married Lois Westafer. After practicing as a veterinarian for several years, he went back to medical school, earning his MD degree from the University of Minnesota in 1966. He completed a one-year medical internship in San Francisco, California, followed by a surgical residency in Baltimore, Maryland. Dick (and Lois) moved to the Seattle, Washington area in 1971. He worked for the Public Health Service for two years, and then he started an otolaryngology practice in Kirkland, Washington, where he was on medical staff at Evergreen Hospital. He also envisioned and co-founded the Evergreen Surgical Center.\nIn 1982, he left the Seattle area and subsequently practiced medicine in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Willmar, Minnesota and Nashville, Tennessee until his first retirement from medicine in 1989. He earned an MBA degree from Eastern University near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1991 (serving as campus physician while in school), after which he volunteered with several Christian organizations near Washington, D.C. and resumed part-time medical work. He was always committed to medical missions, working with several organizations in a number of countries over many decades. He (and Lois) moved to the Denver, Colorado area in 1996 and later to Boise, Idaho in 2003. Always a lifelong learner with a passion to try new things, he later obtained a real estate license and developed a new hobby of woodworking and making pens. He was also an avid gardener who, working with Lois, created beautiful outdoor spaces in many locations.\nDick joined the ASA in early 1966 during his last year of medical school. While at Tulsa in the 80’s, he was at the City of Faith at Oral Roberts where he had the privilege of knowing Bob Herrmann who would go on to become the executive director of the ASA. Dick enjoyed being part of the ASA and interacting with other Christians interested in the sciences. He and his wife, Lois, attended the ASA annual meeting at George Fox U in Oregon in 2008. He encouraged his daughter, Marcy, at the University of Wisconsin, to become an ASA member in 1998.\nDick was known for his gentle manner, his compassion toward others, his deep Christian faith, his wise perspective, his personal integrity, his wry sense of humor, his tenacity and commitment to hard work, and his 'gift of gab' – he could talk to anyone about anything. Dick truly embraced the fullness of life and positively impacted countless numbers of people over his lifetime.

You might find Dick Caster researching and writing for the Federal Way Historical Society, taking a trip to Ocean Shores, or learning the latest line dance. At 84 years old, Dick liked to keep active, and living at Village Green filled the bill perfectly. He really enjoyed keeping fit, so, the yoga exercise classes and walking with his miniature schnauzer, Katie, on these beautiful grounds were wonderful activities for him.\nGrowing up in Seattle, Dick earned a bachelor’s in chemical engineering from Seattle University and went on to get his master’s in the same field at the University of Washington. Another master’s in biblical studies at Faith Seminary in Tacoma rounded out his education. After two years in the Army, Dick was at Weyerhaeuser for 35 years where he worked with structural gluing of wood products.\nAs treasurer of the Village Green Resident Council, Dick contributed to the “voice” of the residents and, together, the group decided on projects to support. Dick’s other interests included biblical archaeology, history, and traveling. He visited 22 countries and counted Israel and Egypt as two of his top destinations. He was a Greek scholar and taught Bible classes.

Charles was a faithful member of Forward Baptist Church of Toronto. He was an enthusiastic and involved member of the Toronto Field Naturalists, the Bruce Trail Conservancy , Senior Hikers of Toronto, Canadian Scientific & Christian Affiliation, Senior College at the University of Toronto, and Cosburn Park Lawn Bowling Club. He was a valued volunteer with the Herbarium at the Royal Ontario Museum.\nCharles Chaffey has been an active and faithful member of the ASA and CSCA, becoming recently recognized for his 50 year membership. He was one of the most loyal attendees at CSCA annual meetings, and, along with his support for local events for the Hamilton Chapter, was well- known for his combining of public transport and his bicycle to attend all these Hamilton events, from his Toronto location. Throughout the years, he submitted a number of book reviews to PSCF, ranging from such topics as mathematics and environmental issues, to old earth geology. In more recent years through a series of talks he filled in a critical gap in the Canadian science and faith theme through his explorations of the historic scene in French Canada and the issue within that Province’s Roman Catholicism. Charles was always known and respected for his engaging comments and questions at CSCA meetings and talks. He will be dearly missed.\nCharles was one of the original members of the CSCA and maintained a keen sense of the founding principles and historical development of the CSCA over the span of his career and into retirement. With a modesty that was so characteristic, Charles was always quick to draw attention to the contributions of others, while overlooking his own very considerable role in establishing the CSCA as highly respected academic ministry in Canada. This characteristic modesty is illustrated in his reflections on the founding years of CSCA. There will be no surprise when Charles hears the words of his Lord: “Well done you good and faithful servant”.\ntop\nJohn T.

He earned a PhD in physics at the U. of Oklahoma and had a post-doctoral appointment at Ohio State U. In 1952 he and his family moved to Wheaton, IL, where he was a professor at Wheaton College until retiring in 1980.\nDr. Claassen conducted research on inert gases at Argonne National Laboratory. On a two-year leave there in the early 1960s, he was the leader of a group that was the first to obtain a simple (two-element) compound of xenon, leading to a change in the name of inert gases in many textbooks to noble gases. By mixing xenon and fluorine at high temperature, outer electrons in the filled shells of xenon atoms were raised to a higher energy level where they could react with fluorine to produce xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4). The result was in the form of clear crystals, which were featured on the cover of the Journal of the American Chemical Society when the discovery was published in September of 1962. For this work Dr. Claassen was named Chicago Scientist of the Year and nominated for a Nobel Prize. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1966 to do research at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He published many scientific papers and a 1966 book entitled The Noble Gases.\nWhile at Wheaton he established the Human Needs and Global Resources (HNGR) program, which sends students for six-month internships to developing countries. He introduced a number of students to ASA and nominated ASA Executive Director Randy Isaac for Fellow. Howard served the ASA on the Council and as Presidenti in the 1970s. In 1989 he and his wife moved to Tacoma, WA, and he helped Habitat for Humanity for ten years with his carpentry and plumbing skills.

Most of his working life was spent in Teachers Colleges and Colleges of Advanced Education. He began as a Lecturer at Mercer House in Melbourne.\nAfter his marriage in 1964, he moved to Alexander Mackie College and then Sydney Teachers College, where he was appointed Senior Lecturer in Science. He was involved in the opening of Westmead Teachers College, which later became Nepean College of Advanced Education (now the University of Western Sydney) where he taught student teachers for many years. In each of these colleges, he was involved in mentoring and encouraging the Christian student groups, giving advice and assistance. He always advised student teachers to contact the Teachers Christian Fellowship (T.C.F.) and to get involved wherever possible. While Bill lived in Victoria he served for several years as Chairman of T.C.F. Victoria and when he moved to Sydney he soon joined the T.C.F committee. During the 1970s and 1980s, Bill played a significant role in the local Blue Mountains T.C.F group. Bill was deeply interested in relating his scientific knowledge with his knowledge of Scripture and was concerned that so many Christian students believed that Science and Scripture were incompatible. He loved to talk to students about all aspects of the Christian faith and despite failing health, he continued to do this until his final illness.

He spent two years as a chemist at an oil refinery in nearby Avon before returning to UC Berkeley to earn a Ph.D. A year of research at the National Institute for Medical Research in London, and two at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City preceded his joining the Biochemistry Department at UC Berkeley in 1958. He retired as Professor of Molecular and Cell Biology in 1990, and as Assistant Dean in the College of Letters and Science in 1992. The University presented Dave the Berkeley Citation in 1992.\nThe research Dave did with his students throughout his career concerned the structure and function of proteins - hormones, enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, and especially chromosomal proteins. He published more than 200 articles and book chapters on his research. He was in that first generation of biochemists who revolutionized the field in the 60’s and 70’s.\nAs a Westmont College trustee for 12 years, he especially encouraged the college to continue strengthening an excellent science program and assisted faculty in writing grant proposals. “Serving on the board at Westmont has been one of the high points of my life,” David said in 2009.\nAs an ASA member and very much interested in faith and science connections, he authored several chapters and articles on theological and ethical implications of genome research, for example, “In Whose Image? Faith, Science, and the New Genetics” (1989). He taught many Sunday School classes over the years on faith and science. He did not hesitate to educate and correct the public on issues of science in gracious and beautifully written letters to the editor of the Santa Barbara News Press, “\nWhile Dave had numerous professional accomplishments, he never talked about them and those are not the things he will be most remembered for. He will be remembered for his humility, his sense of wonder and gratitude, his love for God, his whole-hearted and unconditional love - that extended not only to his immediate family, but also to his students, colleagues, church, and extended family and friends.

Cowperthwaite (1904-1999) Chemistry\n(picture 1947) by F. Alton Everest. One of the five founders of the ASA, Irving Cowperthwaite died of cancer on May 27, 1999 at age 94. Irving was formerly the chief engineer at Thompson Steel Co. in Mattapan, MA. Born in Worcester, Irving earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry at MIT and doctorate ant Columbia U. He taught chemistry at Columbia from 1930-37, then joined Thompson Steel. He retired in 1969. It is with sorrow and with great respect that we note that Irving Cowperthwaite is dead but it is with joy that he is now with the Lord he loved and served. Irving was one of the five who met in 1941 and organized the American Scientific Affiliation.\nWhile the attention of the nation was on war and preparation for war, this tiny band, each in some branch of science, had aspirations of helping the local church to understand the new language of science and especially to help young people meet the spiritual challenges to their faith that science seemed to be making. Some of the first five fell by the wayside very soon. Irving was one who faithfully took up his responsibility and became an important early member of the ASA. He served as Secretary/Treasurer for the years 1942 and 1943, and was on the Executive Council, which directed all ASA affairs for those very formative years. He was faithful in contributing to and attending all the early conventions. Irving received the BS degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in chemistry in 1926. About that time Prof. D.A. MacInnes left MIT for Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research and he took Cowperthwaite with him. For the next four years Irving was a research chemist at Rockefeller Institute in New York City while pursuing a full graduate Ph.D. program at Columbia University. In 1937 Irving left Columbia University to become Chief Engineer and Metallurgist at Thompson Wire Company in Boston. He retired from Thompson in 1969 with an impressive list of scientific papers to his credit. Irving married Fae Irene Poore, a graduate student at Teachers College, in 1931 whom he had met at Calvary Baptist Church of New York City. An interesting twist: Will H. Houghton was pastor of Calvary at that time. It was in Dr. Houghton's Board Room at Moody Bible Institute that ASA \"first saw the light of day.\" F. Alton\nEverest*\ntop\nJames H.

After earning his BS from Wofford College and serving as a US Army meteorologist in World War II, he came to Chapel Hill as a graduate student and earned his PhD in chemistry.\nCrawford's professional career was based in two institutions. Oak Ridge National Laboratory, from 1949 until 1967, and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, from 1967 until his death.\nAt Oak Ridge he served as assistant director and then associate director of the Solid State Division. He conducted extensive research on the effects of high-energy radiation on the electrical and structural properties of crystalline and glassy solids, including\npioneering investigations of the effects of fast neutrons and gamma rays on semiconductors. Along with related efforts by the Lark-Horovitz group at Purdue, these experiments provided the first detailed information on the electron donor-acceptor states due to point defects in germanium and silicon.\nIn 1961, Crawford and Douglas Billington wrote Radiation Damage in Solids, which described these effects. In 1967, Crawford became the chairman of the physics and astronomy department at the University of North Carolina. He returned to full-time teaching and research in 1977, and recently became the first chairman of a new cross-disciplinary curriculum in applied science. During his tenure at North Carolina, Crawford maintained a vigorous and internationally recognized program of research on lattice defect phenomena in ionic crystals. His work on lattice imperfections and ion transport in doped fluorite-type crystals provided valuable insights into the behavior of conventional nuclear fuel materials, which are less amenable to experimental study but have analogous crystal structures and defect properties. During recent years his interests were focused on the effects of high energy radiation on crystalline oxides and on the complex color-center interactions in these materials.\nCrawford was the editor of the Journal of Applied Physics (1960-64). He enjoyed teaching courses at the fringes of physics: photographic science, which allowed him to capitalize on one of his hobbies; and \"Physics and archeology,\" which gave him an opportunity to acquaint students with the growing use of physical techniques in archaeological explorations.\nCrawford's scientific work was closely intertwined with his activities outside the laboratory and the university. He loved the outdoors and was especially fond of the mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee. Quite a few of his scientific papers were written in campgrounds in the mountains. He had a deep religious faith that was combined with humility, dedication and compassion. More than his many good works and accomplishments,\nthose who knew him will miss his loving and gentle spirit. \"He had been a member of the ASA only a short time before his death.\" ed. E.

Crichton (1937-1999) Physics and Engineering\nA professor at Seattle Pacific U., Crichton discovered a mass in his abdomen while at ASA99 last year, diagnosed as a metastatic melanoma. He died on Dec. 18, 1999 at age 62. He grew up in Seattle, where SPU physics prof. Roger Anderson was his childhood friend. A beloved SPU professor since 1965, Jim Crichton was born and raised in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood and attended Seattle Pacific College. Yet long before he graduated summa cum laude in 1959, and long before he earned a 1965 doctorate in physics from the University of California-Berkeley, people noticed his quick mind. \"I met Jim when I was 11 and he was 4,\" says Roger Anderson, SPU professor emeritus of physics. Shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor, 11-year-old Anderson and other kids were on a local street corner, talking about growing world tensions. A 4-year-old made an \"unusually bright remark,\" recalls Anderson. \"So I went over and quizzed him.\" He asked the boy about world leaders, and a 4-year-old Jim Crichton reeled off the names of Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler and Mussolini.\nYears later, in addition to teaching physics and engineering to countless Seattle Pacific students, Crichton gained international recognition by disproving a long-held opinion pertaining to quantum physics and \"phase shifts.\" His view became known as the \"Crichton Ambiguity.\"\nYet his interests went beyond science. Crichton was passionate about classical music, baseball, and sports statistics - including Falcons stats. He also hiked, climbed 180 mountains, ran marathons, and reached 22 official U.S. state elevation \"high points.\" He frequently climbed with his students and with longtime friends such as Anderson, Professor of Music Eric Hanson, Professor of Chemistry Grayson Capp and Professor of Chemistry Paul Lepse. After scientific conferences, he and Lepse often climbed nearby state high points, including Humphries Peak in Arizona and Mauna Kea in Hawaii.\nCrichton never shied away from grappling with faith and science. \"I learned a lot from him about things like the Big Bang theory and how that relates to God as the creator,\" says Lepse. Anderson had similar experiences. \"He was truly a spiritual inspiration to me,\" he says. \"He faced hard questions continuously.\" James Crichton is survived by his wife, Evelyn Vander Pol Crichton, also of the class of '59; two children; three grandchildren; and one sister.\nHe earned his physics doctorate at U.C. Berkeley. Known from childhood as unusually bright, Crichton disproved a long- held opinion regarding quantum physics and \"phase shifts\"- a view known as Crichton ambiguity. Jim was also into classical music, baseball, and mountain climbing, having climbed 180 of them. And he did not shy away from sci/Xny issues. \"He was truly a spiritual inspiration to me,\" said Anderson. \"He faced hard questions continuously.\"; Jay Hollman, Seattle Pacfic College.*\nJohn Cruzan (1942 - 2004) Zoology\nBorn in Bridgton NY January 6, 1942 ; joined ASA in 1965, the year he graduated from King's C., Briarcliff Manor, NY. After earning his Ph.D. in zoology at the University of Colorado in 1968, he joined the faculty at Geneva C., where he taught biology, ecology and environmental science. His most recent research involved developing techniques for surveying nocturnal mammalian predator/scavengers in the Mojave Desert. He was exploring a procedure to collect hairs from nocturnal animals, extract DNA from hair follicle cells and identify individual animals by DNA fingerprinting. Dr. John Cruzan, biology professor and biology department chair, died of cancer on July 28, 2004, shortly after the disease was diagnosed.\nWhen I reflect on my years at Geneva, I realize how much of a positive impact Dr. John Cruzan had on my life. During my sophomore year, he took a special interest in me and gave me many opportunities to learn under his leadership, mentoring, and guidance. I had the privilege of being his student, working with him on his research and assisting him in the lab. Before I took his ecology class, I had little direction as far as career goals, but after that first class I recognized that this was what I wanted to do with my life. Since then, I have realized more than a few times in the course of my own work and research how many of the things I have experienced and accomplished can be traced back to his\ninfluence and guidance. I am so grateful that he believed in me and took it upon himself to mentor and encourage me to believe in my own abilities. During my senior year at Geneva, Dr. Cruzan invited me to go with him and his wife to California for a 10-day research trip in the Mojave Desert. The one occasion that defined for me what Dr. Cruzan was all about happened on this trip. We usually worked in the mornings and then hiked and explored the desert in the afternoons. Dr. Cruzan had a passion for the unique setting of the desert and he enjoyed hiking and climbing the mountains and rock formations. One day we hiked about three miles up to Ryan Mountain, one of the highest points in Joshua Tree National Park. After a pretty strenuous climb we reached the summit and beheld an amazing panoramic view. As we stood there catching our breath and taking it all in, I remember looking over at Dr. Cruzan. He was standing on top of that mountain with a look on his face that seemed to say that he knew that this was where he was supposed to be. It said he was doing what he was meant to do, and he was content despite the obstacles he had to overcome to make it there. That picture has stayed in my mind throughout the years, and I see it in my mind's eye whenever I think about him. Dr. Cruzan served the Lord through his work, protecting and caring for the creation. I have been blessed to have that kind of example in my life.\" Luanne Seffy, Geneva College '99.

He was born October 25, 1925, in Taxila, India (now Pakistan). Tom is survived by his four children, ten grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren, and was preceded in death by his wife for 67 years, Mary.\nHe completed a Ph.D. in Chemistry at Case Institute of Technology. In 1952 he took a position in the Chemistry Department at Westminster College in New Wilmington, PA. In 1955 he moved to Peoria, IL, where he taught in the Bradley University Chemistry department for 42 years, retiring in 1997 at the age of 72. He earned Bradley's Putnam Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1990. He spent the 1987-88 sabbatical year at the Analytical Institute in Vienna, Austria. In 1973, he returned to the US from his sabbatical year at Birmingham, England, via a 26-foot sloop. Crossing the Atlantic Ocean by a small boat was no small feat, as recounted by his wife in the December 1974 ASA Newsletter.\nTom was an ASA Fellow Emeritus, having joined ASA in 1953.

Robert\nwas a full member and had a Ph.D. in physics.\n(Incomplete)\nArthur C. Custance (1910-1985) Anthropology, Education.\nFrom Brockville, Ontario, died on 22 October 1985. Arthur had not been a member for many years, but he attended Annual Meetings when he was just beginning to self-publish his long series of\nDoorway Papers. Those papers were eventually collected in a massive multivolume hardcover series by Zondervan. His last four books were\nSovereignty of Grace, Seed of the Woman, Journey Out of Time, and\nTwo Men Called Adam. Although his writings demonstrated great breadth of scholarship, he regarded himself primarily as an orientalist and anthropologist. Some years ago he visited the Kirklands in Bethesda; his secretary, Evelyn White, sent Glenn a copy of the program from the October 27 memorial service. It included a passage from Journey Out of Time in which Arthur anticipated his meeting with the Lord as \"a day of rejoicing.\"\nArthur C. Custance was born and educated in England and moved to Canada in 1928. In his second year at the University of Toronto he was converted to faith in Christ. The experience so changed his thinking that he switched courses, obtaining an honours M.A. in Hebrew and Greek. In his 13 years of formal education, he explored many facets of knowledge and was particularly interested in anthropology and origins. He completed his Ph.D. (education) at the University of Ottawa in 1959 while serving as head of the Human Engineering Laboratories of the Defence Research Board in Ottawa (Canada) and was engaged in research work for 15 years. During that time he also wrote and published The Doorway Papers, and in retirment in 1970, he wrote 6 major books.\nDuring the 15 years with the Defence Research Board, he worked briefly on the respirator mask programme, developed a mask-sizing meter and an anthropometric facial countour measuring device. He then pursued, until his retirement, an active research programme into physiological stress under combat operations, using voluntary military personnel as subjects.\nHe held several patents in the area of applied physiological instrumentation, including the Custance Sudorimeter which permits exceedingly accurate measurement of levels of sweating (caused not only by heat stress but by emotional and mental as well). He presented numerous classified papers before scientific and military audiences, and his significant research in physiological heat stress resulted in a score of government reports as well as publishing in scientific journals. His was recognized as the authority on human thermoregulation. His writings are characterized by an eclectic combination of scholarly thoroughness and biblical orthodoxy. He had an on and off relationship with the ASA and would be found in that group of anti-evolotionists that preceeded the creation science movement. He held a gap-theory position for Genesis 1.\nBiography, Newsletter.*\nJimmy Henry Davis (1948-2025) Chemist\nJimmy Henry Davis, a resident of Germantown, TN passed away on November 2, 2025, at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis, TN.\nJimmy was born on March 22, 1948, on a beautiful farm near Natchez Trace State Park between Lexington and Parsons, TN. He was the only son of Maxine and Henry Davis who predeceased him. They were wonderful parents who helped Jimmy make room in his busy life to read and study, laying the groundwork for his future success. He graduated from Lexington High School. In 1970 he obtained his BS in chemistry at Union University (UU) in Jackson, TN and graduated summa cum laude. A mentor of Jimmy’s and the head of UU’s Department of Chemistry, encouraged many of her bright chemistry students to shoot for the stars enhancing their chemical knowledge and skills by going to graduate school. Thus, in 1976 Jimmy obtained his Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Illinois (U of Ill), Urbana-Champaign. But before graduating, he met his future wife, Christine Menzel, while both were teaching assistants at the U of I. Christine cherished Jimmy and promised she would do all she could to help advance his work and bring happiness to their lives. They were married on May 11, 1974.\nAfter a short time working in advanced chemistry projects at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Jimmy began his lifelong work at UU in 1978. He has strived to advance the mission of UU to provide Christ-centered education by focusing on its core values. He held a number of important administrative offices at UU, including dean of the Memphis Campus, director of institutional research, associate provost, and vice president. He has always strived for excellence in his teaching, scholarship, and service. Excellence in teaching is reflected in his award of the Alumni Outstanding Teaching Award; his more than ten presentations to other educators on how to teach chemistry using demonstrations; his presentation in China on the future of higher education; and his being awarded the Hammons Chair in Pre-Medical Studies for excellence in teaching pre-medical students.\nJimmy learned about the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) at a Templeton Foundation workshop related to his course award. He then received an ASA grant to bring guest speakers to campus in support of the course. Jimmy joined the ASA in 1999. He presented papers at the ASA annual meetings in 2012, 2017, and 2022. His achievements resulted in his being appointed an ASA Fellow in 2012.\nHe was most happy to teach UU’s science and faith course with Hal Poe, an ASA Fellow and former board member. They explored the major scientific concepts guiding modern science in relationship to the major faith commitments of the Christian faith to produce constructive dialogue that will mutually inform the two ways of knowing between the Word of God and science. Their course won a Templeton Course Award in 1998. Their work resulted in the publication of five books on different issues of science and Christian faith. Their course formed the basis of their first book, Science and Faith: An Evangelical Dialog (2000) which was also published in Romania. The second book, The Designer Universe, won the 2003 Christianity Today Award of Merit. Their third book, Chance or Dance: An Evaluation of Design, was published in 2008 by the Templeton Foundation Press. Their final book, God and the Cosmos: Divine Activity in Space, Time, and History, was published by InterVarsity Press in 2012.\nDavis was a committed Christian, who saw his calling as helping others understand that they are worshiping God by studying the sciences, Philippians 4:8. He has incorporated deliberate activities in his classes that caused his students to integrate their science knowledge to their faith.\nDavis has been people-focused both in and out of the classroom as well as when he was an administrator at Union University. This focus was also shown when, for many years he worked in the Germantown Environmental Commission. Also, it showed when participating with other groups, such as, the planning committee at Germantown Baptist Church and his Sunday School class. He believed that valuing people reflects that all people are created in the image of God. He has always taken time to listen and help those in need.\nLastly, Jimmy and Christine have had many adventures in life, but none were as interesting as the birth, in 1986, of Patrick Menzel Davis and participating in his development. Jimmy was so happy in 2024, when Patrick married Eva (Harrison) Davis; both are nurses and, like Jimmy, very kind and generous people.\ntopFrom Stanwood, Washington, died 1990.

A note from his wife Hazel says that Del \"suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage on Sunday morning, January 24, had surgery, and went into a deep coma until the Lord took him home.\"\nDel had worked as a physicist at Argonne National Laboratory in Argonne, Illinois, for the past twenty years, working right up to January 22. He graduated from Illinois State Normal U. in 1935 and obtained his M.S. in physics at Illinois Institute of Technology in 1947. At the time he joined ASA he was employed as a research chemist at Armour and Company in Chicago. He worked as a physicist at Urgonne National Laboratories.\n\"Delbert N. Eggenberger, editor of Journal ASA in its formative years, designed such things as particle accelerators, X-ray imaging equipment, and breeder reactor instrumentation at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois.\nHe was a member of the Evangelical Free Church and a member of the Instrument Society of America, the American Scientific Affiliation, Sigma XI, American Chemical Society, National Association of Evangelicals, American National Red Cross, Physics Club of America and American Association of Physics Teachers. His first scientific publications were a series of papers in J. Am. Chem. Soc. on electrical conductivities and other properties of aqueous solutions of quaternary ammonium salts of faty acids-hot new detergents in those days. Del also began publishing reviews of significant developments in physics in JASA. \"Garnow's Theory of Element Building\" appeared in the sixth issue of JASA (Vol. 2, No. 3, Sept 1950) and \"Methods of Dating the Earth and the Universe\" in the eighth issue (Vol. 3, No. 1, Mar 1951). With the tenth issue (Vol. 3, No. 3, Sept 1951), he became editor of JASA, replacing the first editor, Marion D. Barnes. Eggenberger continued in that post through Vol. 13 (1961), then served as associate editor under David 0. Moberg and then under Russell L. Mixter (through 1968) until Richard H. Bube became editor. During Delbert Eggenberger's ten-year tenure as editor, our Journal grew from a rather primitively-stapled mimeographed format into a distinguished printed publication. Del also served on the ASA Executive Council in the years 1952-56. Many of us old-timers knew Del Eggenberger as a soft spoken but effective servant of Jesus Christ and of our Affiliation.

He contributed as a scientist to the safe harnessing of nuclear energy through his studies of deuterium (heavy water) with the Manhattan Project during World War II. He studied the application of the electron microscope to scientific investigation and led the initial successful efforts to chemically add fluoride to toothpaste in order to prevent cavities. As an educator, Robert Fischer taught thousands of students as they prepared for careers in many fields, helped create a new university at Cal State Dominguez Hills, and led the transformation of Biola College to Biola University. He wrote scores of scholarly articles and authored textbooks about electron microscopy and quantitative chemical analysis.

He earned a B.S. in chemistry from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1949, and then a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1953. After a stint as a postdoctoral fellow and then assistant professor of biochemistry at Cornell University Medical College, he returned to the University of California, Berkeley, from 1956 to 1960, before joining the Upjohn Company as a researcher from 1960 to 1971.\nAlong the way he became an avid anti-evolutionist and left the scientific community in 1971, he became the vice president of the Institute for Creation Research, founded by Henry Morris. In 2005, Gish retired, becoming the ICR's Senior Vice President Emeritus. A prolific writer, his most famous book was Evolution: The Fossils Say No! (Master Books, 1973), entitled in later editions Evolution: The Challenge of the Fossil Record (Master Books, 1985) and Evolution: The Fossils Still Say No! (Master Books, 1995). His most recent book was Letter to a Theistic Evolutionist (ICON, 2012).\nBut Gish was famous, or notorious, principally on account of his debates with scientists, including such opponents as George Bakken, Kenneth R. Miller, Massimo Pigliucci, Kenneth Saladin, Michael Shermer, and William Thwaites. \"If the mild-mannered professorial Morris was the Darwin of the creationist movement,\" wrote Ronald L. Numbers in The Creationists (2006), \"then the bumptious Gish was its T. H. Huxley.\" Gish boasted of having engaged in over three hundred debates. He was certainly a lively debater, whose style involved a rapid delivery of arguments on widely varying topics; his debate style was dubbed the \"Gish Gallop\" by NCSE's executive director Eugenie C. Scott in 1994. But scientists quickly concluded in the words of Karl Fezer, writing in 199, that \"Gish will say, with rhetorical flourish and dramatic emphasis, whatever he thinks will serve to maintain, in the minds of his uncritical followers, his image as a knowledgeable 'creation scientist.\"' Gish spoke to the biases of a segment of Christendom that discounted science for a biblicist understanding of God and nature. --abstracted from bio, Newsletter.*\ntop\nRobert P.

They went down from the north rim, located a narrow deer trail down the precipitous cliffs and brought the three fliers out in good health. The story made Time and other magazines, and all the newspapers. MacRae used the many invitations to speak of the adventure to drive home a gospel application to thousands in many different kinds of organizations and settings.\nIn 1971, he joined Jack W.

In the midst of differences, he tried to stay focused on the principles rather than the personalities. The cause of Christ was what mattered to him.\"\nMacRae had also done work for the NIV Bible translation, was president of Evangelical Theological Seminary, and was an honorary fellow of the ASA.

Moon (1918-1986) Science Educator, Evangelist\nDied on 7 May 1986 at age 78 and was buried in Placenia, California. He is survived by his wife Margaret and four children. Irwin was known throughout the world as producer and host of the famous Moody science films. He founded the Moody Institute of Science, a branch of Moody Bible Institute, Dr. Irwin A. Moon presented his famous million-volt demonstration before hundreds of thousands in his unique Sermons from Science lectures and directed it until his retirement in 1972. Under his direction MIS produced 39 educational films, which won 27 national and international awards. After retirement he remained active in its work as an advisor and friend of the staff.\nWorking with youth as a young pastor in Los Angeles, Moon found the visual approach especially effective in reaching young people with the gospel. He devised a set of the old 31/4 by 41/4 inch glass slides entitled, \"The Microscope, the Telescope, and the Bible.\" That presentation eventually formed the basis of the first Moody science film, \"The God of Creation.\"\nIn the 1930's according to Alton Everest, \"The American Scientific Affiliation owes its existence directly to Irwin Moon. He saw that many of the students he counseled had questions about the relationship of science to Christian faith. He convinced Will H. Houghton, president of Moody Bible Institute, of the need to do something. Houghton then arranged that first meeting in 1941 from which sprang the ASA.\"\nOut of a flood of memories, Alton was surprised to find one in particular that kept coming back, from a time when they were working together 40 years ago on the film, \"Voice of the Deep.\" Alton wrote, \"We were both in Navy deep-sea diving outfits on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean at Emerald Cove, Santa Catalina Island. Suddenly the reassuring throb of the engine driving the air compressor sped, leaving only a couple of minutes of air in our suits. Also eliminated was the usual method of ascent by blowing up the suit and shooting up like a balloon. Now it was grunt work, hand over hand up a line. When we finally reached the line, I motioned for Irwin to climb up first. He motioned for me to do the same. That Alfonso-Gaston procedure went ' on for some time, wasting precious seconds, until I realized anew that Irwin would rather suffocate than give in. Not being endowed with such competitive drive and rather yearning for a breath of air, I gave in. \"That was the Irwin we knew and loved, and whose talents and ability we respected. He is gone now, but the institutions he established continue to do the Lord's work.\" Newsletter, Also, Everest, History of the ASA. *\ntop\nHenry M. Morris (1918-2006) Civil Engineer\n(Oct 6, 1918 - Feb 25, 2006) Ccreationist leader, dies at Age 87. Henry M. Morris died February 25 after a series of strokes. Eugenie C. Scott told the New York Times that Morris was the most important creationist of the 20th century, much more so than William Jennings Bryan. As director of the National Center for Science Education, Scott dismissed Morris books as having no scientific merit, but she recalled his cordial, gentlemanly manner and said: I feel he was absolutely sincere about his convictions that the Bible was literally true and that science would support it and creation science was good science.\n\"Morris grew up in Texas in the 1920s and 1930s. He graduated from Rice University with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1939. He married Mary Louise on January 24, 1940, and they later had six children. After his graduation in 1939, and through 1942, he was a hydraulic engineer working with the International Boundary and Water Commission. He returned to Rice, teaching civil engineering from 1942 until 1946. In 1946 he wrote a short book entitled That You Might Believe (1946). From 1946 through 1951, he studied at the University of Minnesota, where he was awarded a master's degree in hydraulics (1948) and a Ph.D. in hydraulic engineering (1950). In 1951 he became a professor and chair of civil engineering at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\" Wikipedia After fifteen years in faculty positions at Rice U., U. of Minnesota, U. of Southern Louisiana, and Southern Illinois U., Morris became head of the civil engineering department at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. During his thirteen years there, the school program grew to become one of the nation's largest. His 1963 textbook on applied hydraulics is still in use.\nWhen his book The Genesis Flood (co-authored with theologian John Whitcomb) became popular, a new administrator decided Morris was too controversial. In the words of the Los Angeles Times, When he was asked to drop his creationist writings from his resume, Morris knew it was time to move on He founded the Institute for Creation Research and co-founded what is now San Diego Christian C. His biographical listings appear in Who's Who in Science, Antiquity to Present; Who's Who in America; American Men of Science; Who in Engineering; Who's Who in Science and Engineering; Who's Who in the World and Contemporary Authors.\nMorris was an ASA member and Fellow during its early years. His passing is an opportunity for those of us in ASA to demonstrate our appreciation for differing perspectives and interpretations. In the spirit of Robert Fischer's book, God Did It, But How, we may differ in the methods and the timeframe in which the Creator did it, but we show solidarity with anyone who acknowledges, It is he who has made us, and not we ourselves.

Doug's obituary noted that \"His faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour was the central theme and primary philosophy of his life and determined his decisions and actions.\"\nDoug addressed the Guelph graduating class two months before he died, wishing them success as he defined it: \"Over 2,000 years ago, a Hebrew writer penned what I believe to be a true description of success. He wrote: 'And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.' This definition acknowledges God and presupposes absolutes.\" He then explained these three character qualities.

Jim Neidhardt (1934-1993) Physics\nJim, an active ASA member, died unexpectedly at age 59 of a sudden heart attack on July 15 1993, in bed. His recently published book, coauthored by James E. Loder, was The Knight's Move: The Relational Logic of the Spirit in Theology and Science, Helmers & Howard, 1992. He was an influential physics professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ for 31 years and an active member in the local NY ASA section.\nJim befriended numerous scientists and theologians from various countries at the Center for Theological Inquiry in Princeton and helped many seminarians and graduate students at several universities. Jim was author of numerous JASA papers and a promoter of Michael Polanyi's ideas. Many of us will remember his frequent use of graphic illustrations to explain various relationships.\nTribute was paid Jim by his co-author of The Knight's Move, Dr. James Loder, in a memorial service on 20 Jul 93. Loder emphasized in his eulogy that, as a whole person, Jim did not detach his intellect from his heart\" and loved to place himself in the biblical tradition \"so the labor of his mind was generated in and from his heart.\" His remarkable energy \"was matched by genuine humility and a delightful sense of humor. His humor seemed usually to embody the comment from Niels Bohr that he loved to repeat Bohr's comment to a young physicist who complained that there was too much humor at the Bohr Institute. \"People should be more serious,\" the young physicist exclaimed. To which Bohr replied, \"Some things are so serious that they must be taken with a sense of humor.\" I think this was the source of Jim's humor. He took serious things seriously and that was the source of much of his humor about lesser things. Jim also \"seemed to have more sorrow or compassion rather than anger at those physicists, theologians, scientists who apparently could not see or comprehend the grace of God\" but also, \"nothing gave him more joy than the triumph of a sound Biblically-based theological argument in the face of a reductionist and secularized concept of humanity, nature, cosmology.\"\nBelieving, as his mentors Tom Torrance and Harold Nebelsick, in the contingency in all things upon the grace of God, his \"service was rendered most of the time in an atmosphere of scientific hostility, to the deepest conviction of his- heart, that science and theology belonged together.\" In closing, Loder alluded to the good that could continue from Jim's effort, though he is no longer among us. And indeed, even now in the ASA, such fruit is being manifested. Robert T. Voss was introduced to the ASA by Jim and has recently relocated from the New York-New Jersey ASA local section (of which Jim Neidhardt was a member) to Pittsburgh, where a new local section is in formation.

Ted Davis, Newsletter*\nEugene A. Nida (1914-2011) Linguistics\nRevolutionized Bible Translations, Dead at 96 his name might not be prominent, but Eugene A. Nida's influence can be found in most Christian homes-more specifically, in their Bibles. Nida, one of the leading advocates for dynamic equivalence translation, died August 25, 2011 at a hospital in Brussels, Belgium. He was 96.\nDynamic equivalence translation (a phrase which Nida coined) is a \"meaning-based\" approach to biblical translation; it focuses on translating \"thought-for-thought\" rather than \"word-for-word.\" In a 2002 interview with Christianity Today, Nida said that this shift in translation was his most important contribution: \"To help people be willing to say what the text means, not what the words are, but what the text means.\" Nida's career in translation began in 1936, when he graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles with a B.A. in Greek and a minor in Latin.\nThe summer after he graduated, Nida attended the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), a faith-based nonprofit that serves language communities by using research, training, and development to \"build capacity for sustainable language development.\" After his introduction to SIL, Nida returned every summer from 1937 to 1953 to teach there. Nida continued his studies at the University of Southern California, where he earned a master's degree in New Testament Greek. He completed a doctorate in linguistics at the University of Michigan in 1943. That same year, he was hired by the American Bible Society as associate secretary of versions. He became the executive secretary for translations in 1946, a position that he held until his retirement in 1980. He was present at the founding conference of the United Bible Societies in 1946, and in 1949 he founded The Bible Translator, a journal featuring articles about the theory and practice of Bible translation.\nBy the late 1960s, Nida had published two books, Toward a Science of Translating (Brill, 1964), and The Theory and Practice of Translation (Brill, 1969, with C.R. Taber), advancing his new dynamic equivalence theory. He had also published a first edition of the Greek New Testament, which became a basis for other translators in their work. Nida spent much of his career traveling around the globe. By 1952, he had traveled to more than 30 countries and encountered more than 80 languages. In his travels, he met and trained teams to help them in their translation work. In 1978, he was praised by the Christian Herald as a man who \"has done more than any one person to provide people with Scripture they can read in their own language.\" The popularity and positive reception of The Good News Bible (also called the Today's English Version) lent credence to Nida's work, as it was translated using dynamic equivalence theory. Other versions, such as the New Living Translation and Contemporary English Version, are also heavily influenced by Nida's approach.\nIn his work, Nida emphasized the importance of cultural context - both the cultural context of Bible and the cultural context of the language into which the Bible is being translated. One example he liked to use was the parable of the sheep and the goats in Matthew 25, where the sheep represent those who have done the Lord's will, and the goats are those who haven't. \"Look out, because in most of Africa, sheep are regarded as very bad animals!\" he said in his 2002 interview. \"The translator, of course, cannot change all the sheep into goats and the goats into sheep. But you've got to have footnotes to explain the cultural difference. Otherwise, you're going to give an entirely wrong impression.\" However, Nida also emphasized something over the need for multiple, relatable translations: a desire to understand and spread the meaning of the Bible. \"What is really needed is for people to take the message seriously and share it with other people, focused primarily on what this message has meant to me,\" he said. \"So many Christians love to argue about the Bible rather than take it seriously as a message that is important for their own lives.

Harold graduated in chemistry from what is now the U. of Rhode Island and was employed in the dyeing and electrical industries before his retirement. He was active in \"people-to-people\" peace efforts between the U.S. and U.S.S.R., which he described in papers at our 1987 and 1988 Annual Meetings. It's hard to think of chemist Harold Northrup of Pawcatuck, Connecticut, as an \"old-timer\" even though he's an octogenarian. After all, immediately after the Colorado Springs meeting he went to China on the ASA tour.\nHis paper on \"Pathways to Good Will between Hostile Countries\" was based on his own experience traveling to the Soviet Union with a group exploring \"citizen diplomacy.\" He showed slides of his trip and handed out a bibliography on peace and peacemaking efforts. Harold urged ASA members not to overlook \"the influence for good of a single individual.\"How did Harold Northrup get interested in \"waging peace\"? For many years he did goal-oriented research in the storage-battery industry. Even after retirement he has been called back from time to time to help solve problems. It occurred to Harold that the Lord had given him a gift for solving problems, and he couldn't think of a more important problem than world peace. So he thought he'd take a crack at it. He knows its a tough problem but that's the kind he likes best. Besides, he says, all the easy problems have already been solved. He went on the ASA tour to China in 1987.

The first application world-wide of this formulation was on 1964 model Cadillacs and Buicks. In pure science with a co-investigator (Richard D. Spencer) at the University of Illinois, he determined the lifetime of the fluorescent excited state of coenzyme NADH, under half-a-billionth of a second. It is now an internationally-accepted constant in biochemistry. Using this constant, the time needed to conduct a rate experiment involving NADH in living systems was reduced from two or more weeks to two to four hours, a significant saving in research time and materials. As a direct consequence of using the constant within a decade of publication six hereditary metabolic diseases were either controlled or cured through research at established research stations in the United States and Europe. Dr. Scott, along with other professional experts in his field, authored \"Synthetic Procedures in Nucleic Acid Chemistry,\" and \"Spectroscopic Model Studies of NAD(H),\" Nicotinamide-Adenine Dinucleotide (Reduced). Today, he continues to study the created order and consults periodically with active professionals.\n*Taken from Marquis Who’s Who, https://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/436241\ntop\nRaymond J.

He published a dozen articles in PSCF and gave numerous plenary and contributed talks at ASA annual meetings local chapter meetings. He served on the ASA History and Philosophy of Science commission in the early ‘70’s. With his soft-spoken, mild-mannered style, he influenced countless students and ASA members. He excelled in a broad range of disciplines in the natural sciences as well as in the history and philosophy of science. “A Christian view of the physical world sees nature in the light of Scripture and with a concern for culture. This involves a creative view of nature that recognizes the world as real and good,” he wrote in a chapter of The Making of a Christian Mind: A Christian World View & The Academic Enterprise. Joe and Marilyn often had Wheaton College students over to their home and hosted dinners for Sigma Pi Sigma (SPS physics honors society) inductees in the Wheaton College Chapter.

Bob was born on March 14, 1936, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and was educated in the public schools. He received an AB degree from Oberlin College, and a Master’s and PhD from the University of Illinois in inorganic chemistry. During his graduate studies, he worked four summers as an inorganic chemist at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C.\nBefore getting his doctorate, Bob spent a year at Wheaton Graduate School studying biblical literature. He said the experience helped him decide between a professional Christian ministry and chemistry, though his lifelong religious involvement never flagged. He believed, he said, “that there’s a very close interaction between science and religion.”\nHe played a founding role in the establishment of Chesterton House, a center for Christian studies at Cornell, and for more than 40 years was faculty adviser for the Cornell chapter of the Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. Bob joined the ASA as a member in 1997, after subscribing to Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith since 1982. He was elected an ASA Fellow in 2012. The Winter 2012 issue of the ASA Newsletter announced his election and said the following about him:\nRobert Fay was a science textbook author and professor emeritus at Cornell University. Bob came to faith in Christ at a young age, in part due to the faith of his Christian parents, who explained the gospel to him and modeled what it means to follow Jesus.\nWhen Bob went to study at Oberlin College, where there were very few Christians, he was challenged to reexamine the foundations of the faith he had accepted as a child. Through serious study of the gospels and with the help of the ministry of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Bob became convinced that the claims of Christ were credible. Christ became very real to Bob at Oberlin, and he began to wonder if God’s call for the future was in teaching chemistry or, perhaps, in pastoral ministry.\nA year as a teaching fellow in the chemistry department at Wheaton College made clear that God was leading Bob into an academic vocation. For the past 50 years, he has had the great joy and privilege of serving the Lord at Cornell. In teaching, research, writing, and interactions with students and colleagues, he has sought to be faithful. And God? He is always faithful.\nAmong his ASA activities, Bob coordinated John Polkinghorne’s three-day visit to Cornell in April 2004, where Polkinghorne presented several lectures and seminars, including a Templeton/ASA Lecture to some 450 students and faculty.\nOne of Bob’s favorite ASA memories was the history tour of England, Scotland, and Ireland after a joint ASA/CiS meeting in Cambridge. The tour was a wonderful learning experience and a rich time of fellowship with other Christians in science.\nKarl Johnson and Keith Yoder published an interview with Bob in the December 2009 issue of Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith. It was titled “Chemist as Complementarian: An Interview with Robert C. Fay” and is available at this link.\nTogether with his wife, Carol, he attended almost every ASA annual meeting in the last 15 years. He was an enthusiastic support of the ASA.\n“He thought far beyond the frame of a chemist and saw the deeper challenges and opportunities for someone of his faith convictions to speak wisely to the big questions that truly launch all inquiry, including scientific inquiry,” said Vivek Matthew, executive director of Chesterton House. “Beyond that, the warmth and devoted care that he and his wife Carol provided to our organization were pivotal to getting us to where we are today.”\ntopGeorge H.

For lay readers seeking to properly integrate science and faith, he wrote Science, Man, and Society as well as God Did It, But How? (2 Eds. English, a 3rd. in Spanish, a 4th in German ) and Who Is God?\nRobert Fischer met God personally during his childhood and sought to serve Him faithfully throughout his life. He demonstrated his faith daily. He taught Bible classes and preached in several churches and was active at different times at College Church (Wheaton, Illinois), Twin Cities Bible Church (Urbana, Illinois), United Presbyterian Church (Bloomington, Indiana), Peninsula Baptist Church (Palos Verdes, California), Rolling Hills Covenant Church (Palos Verdes, California), and Evangelical Free Church (Fullerton, California).

Though orphaned of his own father and raised by a single mother, Robert Fischer was himself a role model of a loving father and faithful husband. He was survived by his wife of 66 years Mary Ellen (Mitchell) (Fullerton, California) and his five children.--Phil Fischer, Newsletter*\ntop\nDavid Ernest Fisher, age 85, of Wheaton, finished his work on Earth and moved to his heavenly home on September 22, 2021. He was born on October 23, 1935 in Lakewood, OH to Ernest Albert and Dorothy Mary (Deeks) Fisher, and graduated from North Olmsted High School.\nOn June 23, 1956 he married Doris Jane Sholes, then earned a Bachelor’s degree from Roberts Wesleyan College in Rochester, NY in 1957, followed by a degree in Missionary Technical Radio from Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, IL in 1960. He gained practical experience as a radio engineer and announcer at WDAC in Lancaster, PA, where he met many listeners who became faithful supporters over the ensuing decades. In 1963 Dave and Doris joined Trans World Radio (now TWR) and served in Monaco (Europe) 1963-1973, Swaziland (Africa) 1973-1976 and Guam 1976-1978. He served in a technical capacity preparing broadcasts to be aired in dozens of dialects, so that people of many tribes and nations could hear the Good News of Jesus in their heart language. It was from hearing responses from listeners behind the Iron Curtain, who had been taught that science invalidated faith, that he was inspired to spend a few hours per week writing radio scripts that addressed their concerns and questions. In 1978 the family moved to Wheaton, so he could focus full-time on showing secular listeners the coherence between science and Christian faith, via interviews with notable scientists with a strong Christian faith, as well as exposés of synergies between science and the Bible. Over the years, from its start for Hungarian, then Russian and Mandarin-speaking listeners, the Truth in the Test Tube (TTT) program has been produced and broadcast by TWR in 13 languages, drawing responses from around the globe. He also served in the World by 2000 project at the US Center for World Mission in the late 90s. He marked 58 years of service with TWR in June 2021.\nAfter 52 years of marriage, Doris was promoted to heaven in 2008. Eleanor Weiberg became his wife and ministry partner in 2011, celebrating his 50 years with TWR with him in 2013. They would have celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary this November.\nIn 1985, he earned an M.A. in Intercultural Studies and Missions from Wheaton College. His print publications include co-authorship of Scientists Who Believe (Moody Press, 1984), translated into five languages and selling over 50,000 copies, chapter contributions to Ambassadors for Christ (Moody, 1994), numerous articles in Young Ambassador magazine, and frequent contributions to Chuck Colson’s BreakPoint broadcast.\nDave joined the American Scientific Affiliation in 1979. He actively recruited ASA members for science-faith material to use in his broadcasts. That plus his penchant for puns is illustrated in the June/July 1982 issue of the ASA Newsletter. It recounts the way Dave drew on information from astronaut Jack Lousma (commander of the third Columbia space shuttle mission) on his broadcast and urged ASA members to contribute similar stories. The newsletter concludes\n“As a headline for this story Dave Fisher suggested \"AN APOLLO-GETIC APPROACH,\" because of our \"perverse and persistent penchant for puns.\" Where did he get that idea? Even so, it's good to see a young fellow show respect for a senior's old-age penchant.-Ed.”\nHe frequently submitted news items for the ASA Newsletter. Then he served as co-editor, with Margaret Towne, of the newsletter of the ASA from 2002 to 2011. Dave continued to volunteer with the ASA for the remainder of his life. He frequently recorded all the sessions he attended at the annual meetings and would regularly submit calendar items for posting on the ASA website. He was elected an ASA Fellow in 1995 in recognition of his contributions.\nHe enjoyed spending time with family and friends, attending lectures by visiting scientists, notably at Fermilab and Wheaton College, keeping fit, traveling to visit supporting churches in the Eastern US and to attend conferences, as well as playing board games and word games. And puns!! He prayed for his children and grandchildren every day.\ntop\nCharles Flynn ( -1994) Chemistry died quietly in his condo on Oct. 28, 1994, while resting after dinner. Chuck published his annual Flynn Frizzer at Christmas time, and word of his death came in the final issue (vol. 8), written by brother Geoff, whose cover letter offers some insight into Chuck's personality: \"While the loss of Chuck is difficult to accept it is comforting to know that he is now with our Lord, dancing and running and I'm sure also exchanging puns.\" Chuck worked as a chemist at the U.S. Bureau of Mines' Research Center in Reno, Nevada, and his fellow employees put together a retirement party for him, including a ballad that two coworkers wrote.\nThe reader might be indulged for a verse or two that provides some insight into Chuck's delightful character (sung to the tune of the Beverly Hillbillies' song):\nCome and listen to a story `bout a man named Flyn\na-notched chemist, and a warm-hearted friend\nHe's a scholar and a Christian\nAnd he's always got a pun.\nWell, here's to you Chuck, it's been great fun!\nRahr, that is...fight the fat...entropy\nIf you ask about his hobbies, we'd say he's had a few\nWhen it comes to classic music, composer birthdays what he knew\nHis computer's been abuzzin'|\nCause Chuck's on his way to be a Mathcad hero!\nChuck, that is...Dr. Flynn...we'll miss him.\n(from The Ballad of Chuck Flynn, written by Debbie Bluemer and Sandy McGill, USBM)\nGeoff recounts one of his favorite stories about Chuck in the final Frizzer. In high school, Chuck entered and won first prize in a science contest, which was a four-year scholarship to Caltech. The awards ceremony was held in the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, where Chuck was awarded the prize by Werner Von Braun. As part of the offering, he was allowed to ask Von Braun a question. Geoff recounts: \"Our parents were quietly praying in the audience that Chuck would keep quiet. But you know Chuck. He did in fact ask a question which resulted in a period of silence from Dr. Von Braun. Our parents thought Chuck's question must have been extremely basic and Dr. Von Braun was trying to think of a nice way to respond without embarrassing Chuck. Dr. Von Braun's response indicated that the auditorium was filled with many noted scientists and that only a handful probably even understood the question and maybe only three knew the answer! He then proceeded to answer Chuck's question. Needless to say we never doubted Chuck's brilliance after that.\" During the funeral service, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony was played, and afterwards \"we gathered to share stories and of course pizza and soda. What else would you expect to be served at a party to honor Chuck?\"\nNewsletter*\ntop\nWayne Frair (1926-2015) Zoologist of Basking Ridge, NJ\nWayne Frair passed away on Thursday, Jan. 29, 2015. He was born in Pittsburgh, Pa., on May 23, 1926. He received a BA in zoology from Houghton College, a BS in zoology from Wheaton College, an MS is embryology from U of Massachusetts, and a PhD in biochemical taxonomy from Rutgers University. Except for a sabbatical at Rutgers, his entire career was as a professor of biology and chairman of the biology department at King’s College in Briarcliff Manor, NY. He was an expert in sea turtles and on baraminology.\nWayne became a Christian while in the US Navy in 1946 and then became interested in issues of science and faith. He joined the ASA in 1952 and became an ASA Fellow, remaining with the ASA until 2005. He was an advocate of young-earth creationism, having been influenced by George Mooreland at Houghton. He served on the board and was president of the Creation Research Society from 1986 to 1993. He wrote several books including “A Case for Creation.” While other creationists left the ASA a few years after the Creation Research Society was founded, Wayne remained active in the ASA and was an outstanding example of civil discourse with opposing views. Walt Hearn was one who remembered Wayne as “a good friend, one of the brightest, certainly the gentlest, YEC I knew in ASA. At ASA Annual Meetings we had many good discussions about creation/evolution, but never an argument.”\ntop\nJohn H Freer (1938-2017) Psychiatrist\nDr. John H.

While speaking at a charismatic conference in Brighton, England, last December, he developed a hoarseness which was soon traced to a thyroid malignancy. After chemotherapy the cancer subsided, then came back beyond medical control.\nBorn in Vancouver, Washington, Bob graduated from Reed College in Oregon, earned an M.A. and Ph.D. (1952) in biology at Rice, stayed on in Houston to teach anatomy at Baylor College of Medicine. He later taught biology at Evangel College in Missouri, Westmont and Southern California colleges in California, and Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma, where he chaired ORU's Dept of Natural Sciences. In 1970 he resigned to take up full-time writing and speaking. For several years he also taught at Melodyland School of Theology in Anaheim, California. Bob contributed articles to a number of periodicals and was a contributing editor to\nNew Covenant, a Catholic charismatic magazine. Speaking at the 1960 Annual Meeting at Westmont College: \"Dr. Frost then asked the question., \"To what extent is the Christian biologist a mechanist?\" His answer pointed out the Christian's commitment to a transcendent God Who established the laws and supervises their operation and Who is also the Author and Finisher of the moral and spiritual life, as well, The Christian biologist sees beyond the mechanistic operation to the author beyond, much as a person can look through a glass window or focus attention on the glass itself\". He wrote about the \"Spirit-filled life\" in a series of books from Bridge Publishing, Inc.

Newsletter*\ntop\nGeorge Giacumakis Jr. (1937-2019) History, Middle East Studies\nGeorge Giacumakis Jr was born on July 6, 1937, and died April 6 following heart surgery. Dr. Giacumakis’ love for Israel and the Jewish people went back to when he was a college student studying Hebrew and Greek. The newborn state of Israel was only ten years old at the time and was the subject of much attention amongst his fellow Bible students. When awarded a scholarship by Brandeis University, he studied at the largely Jewish school and earned both a Master’s and a Ph.D. degree in Mediterranean Studies (Near East and Islamic Studies).\nAfter graduation, in 1963 he joined Cal State Fullerton’s Irvine campus in the department of history. He became a Danforth Foundation Fellow in 1968. He was department chair from 1972-1975 and in 1978 left campus to head the American Institute of Holy Land Studies (now called Jerusalem University College) in Jerusalem. He returned to the Irvine campus in 1984 and also became an adjunct professor of history at Biola University. He was director of the university’s first south county branch in 1989 until his retirement in 2007.\nGeorge joined the ASA in 1961 and beginning in 1966 he served several years on the executive council of the Southern California section of the ASA. He was also active on the social science commission of the ASA. In 1966 he published the book The Akkadian of Alalah on ancient tablets found in the Syrian city of Alalah. He was a founding director of Song of Israel and founded the Museum of Biblical and Sacred Writings at Biola. He led many tours to the Middle Eastern countries. He also was an editor of Young’s Bible Dictionary and the International Standard Version of the Bible. One of the chapters of Protest and Politics - Christianity and Contemporary Affairs, edited by Robert G. Clouse, et. al., was written by George and titled “Christian Attitudes Toward Israel.”\ntop\nOwen Gingerich (1930-2023) Astronomer\nOne of the greatest Christian scholars of his generation, Owen Jay Gingerich died on May 28, 2023, at age 93. Born in March 1930 to devout Mennonite parents, he grew up in Iowa, Kansas, and Indiana with an early fascination for the stars. His father Melvin, the only member of his family who finished high school, became a history teacher and later (after completing a doctorate at the University of Iowa) a college professor. As a graduate student, Melvin brought home astronomy books from the university library for his son, including one about how to build a telescope. Together they made one good enough to see Saturn’s rings from a mailing tube, eyeglass lenses, and a magnifying lens for the eyepiece. As a teenager, Owen joined his father on a trip to Poland in 1946, bringing livestock to war-torn countries on behalf of the United Nations. A Polish astronomer who learned about it invited Owen to visit Poland again, resulting in Owen’s involvement in preparations for the Copernican quinquecentennial in 1973—an experience that helped re-shape his academic career.\nWhen Melvin accepted a faculty position at Goshen College, Owen left high school a year early to enter Goshen, from which he graduated in 1951 with a degree in chemistry. That is where he encountered physicist H. Harold Hartzler, a leading ASA member, whom Owen considered “one of my most influential undergraduate teachers.” At that time, he was pondering how a person who wanted to serve Christ could justify doing “something so useless as astronomy.” Hartzler offered this advice: “We can’t let the atheists take over any particular profession. If you feel that you have a calling to go into astronomy you should go for it.”\nFollowing a summer job at Harvard Observatory, Owen was admitted to Harvard as a graduate student in astronomy, earning a master’s degree in 1953. He made his first appearance in the old ASA journal in September 1953, when Hartzler forwarded a six-paragraph summary of cutting-edge work on the size and age of the universe that Owen wrote. Although Hartzler credited it to Owen, the piece was published under Hartzler’s name. At the same time, he became a teaching fellow under I. Bernard Cohen, the first American to receive a Ph.D. in history of science and a student of George Sarton, founder of the History of Science Society. Decades later, Owen became a professor in that illustrious department. The following year, Owen married fellow Goshen graduate Miriam Sensenig, a nurse. They would have three sons.\nOwen eventually earned the Ph.D. from Harvard in 1962, with a dissertation on stellar atmospheres supervised by Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin. To support his growing family along the way, he taught for three years at the American University of Beirut (fulfilling his obligation as a conscientious objector) and for one year at Wellesley College. Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory hired him shortly after he completed the doctorate. There he spent the rest of his career, retiring in 2000 although he kept his office at the observatory. The hundreds of scientific papers he wrote included two widely cited articles on standard models for the solar atmosphere.\nFor much of his professional life, however, Owen functioned more as a historian than as an astronomer. A key moment came in 1970, when he ran across a heavily annotated copy of Copernicus’s De revolutionibus (1543) in the library of the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh. The notes contradicted a claim by the famous author Arthur Koestler, that De revolutionibus was “the book nobody read,” a phrase that became the title of one of Owen’s books. Over the next three decades, he tracked down 600 copies of the first and second editions, examining the marginalia to learn (if possible) who had actually read the book, when they did so, and what they thought. No other book in the history of science has been studied in a comparably exhaustive manner. In the process, he became a leading expert not only on Copernicus, but also on Ptolemy, Kepler, Tycho Brahe, and Galileo. Nor did he neglect modern developments, such that he served for many years as an associate editor of the Journal for the History of Astronomy. He also became a highly knowledgeable collector of rare and often valuable scientific books, which he stored in two safes in his office and eagerly showed to friends.\nA major theme in Owen’s historical work was the role of Christian beliefs in the lives and careers of many great scientists, especially Kepler (see the March 2011 issue of PSCF). He wrote and spoke frequently, with equal eloquence, in too many places to count. It is fair to say that his general education course, “The Astronomical Perspective,” was legendary: those qualified to have an opinion regarded him as the finest teacher in his department and one of the best at Harvard. His essays, books, and public talks were always exquisitely illustrated with wonderful images, often from his own camera.\nPerhaps his best-known lecture, published in multiple versions, was called, “Dare a Scientist Believe in Design?” Although he always answered that question affirmatively, his approach was more subtle than the often-strident claims of Intelligent Design advocates: in his view, the existence of a designer was a reasonable but modest conclusion from the evidence, hardly a slam dunk. This drew ire from both hard-core atheists, such as the staunchly positivistic philosopher of science Adolf Grünbaum who took him to task at a colloquium in Pittsburgh, and ID proponents, such as Phillip E. Johnson, with whom Owen had a spontaneous, very lively exchange at the 1992 ASA meeting in Kona, Hawaii. Owen’s plenary address on “The Future of Physical Science—Ethical and Theological Implications,\" was unrelated to ID, but a few weeks earlier his critical review of Johnson’s book, Darwin on Trial, had appeared in PSCF. Johnson’s plenary the next day, “Science and Scientism in 21st Century Education,” questioned the validity of “the Darwinian theory” and blamed “scientific naturalism” for undermining traditional values. Their public disagreement led Owen to clarify his position in the December 1992 issue: “To invoke God’s active agency as the explanation for slow, long-term changes in the biological record will be no more efficacious as a scientific theory than to say that the moon orbits the earth or apples fall from trees because of God’s sustaining activity in the universe. While I believe both to be true, they do not pass as scientific explanations. In reading Darwin on Trial, I am left with the impression that Johnson wishes they would.”\nThis attitude drove the two short books he wrote in the final part of his life, God’s Universe and God’s Planet, both published by Harvard University Press, the latter with a foreword by former ASA Executive Director Randy Isaac. Acutely aware of his mortality, Owen focused on finishing them as soon as he could, without sacrificing quality. He also continued to serve the ASA in various ways. He gave a plenary address at the 2002 meeting in Santa Barbara, published an eloquent sermon on natural theology in the June 2014 issue of PSCF, and was still on the editorial board at his death. Having first been identified as the consulting editor for astronomy in June 1969—a run of fifty-four years—Owen Gingerich gave more to the ASA than almost anyone else. I need not say that his expertise, counsel, and courage will be sorely missed.\n*contributed by Ted Davis\ntop\nDuane T. Gish (1921-2013) Biochemistry\nJoined the ASA in 1960, was elected a fellow soon after for his contributions to the ASA and science. Gish died on March 5, 2013, at the age of 92, Born on February 17, 1921, in White City, Kansas, he served in the U.S. Army from 1940 to 1946 in the Pacific Theater of Operations, attaining the rank of captain. He earned a B.S. in chemistry from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1949, and then a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1953. After a stint as a postdoctoral fellow and then assistant professor of biochemistry at Cornell University Medical College, he returned to the University of California, Berkeley, from 1956 to 1960, before joining the Upjohn Company as a researcher from 1960 to 1971.\nAlong the way he became an avid anti-evolutionist and left the scientific community in 1971, he became the vice president of the Institute for Creation Research, founded by Henry Morris. In 2005, Gish retired, becoming the ICR's Senior Vice President Emeritus. A prolific writer, his most famous book was Evolution: The Fossils Say No! (Master Books, 1973), entitled in later editions Evolution: The Challenge of the Fossil Record (Master Books, 1985) and Evolution: The Fossils Still Say No! (Master Books, 1995). His most recent book was Letter to a Theistic Evolutionist (ICON, 2012).\nBut Gish was famous, or notorious, principally on account of his debates with scientists, including such opponents as George Bakken, Kenneth R. Miller, Massimo Pigliucci, Kenneth Saladin, Michael Shermer, and William Thwaites. \"If the mild-mannered professorial Morris was the Darwin of the creationist movement,\" wrote Ronald L. Numbers in The Creationists (2006), \"then the bumptious Gish was its T. H. Huxley.\" Gish boasted of having engaged in over three hundred debates. He was certainly a lively debater, whose style involved a rapid delivery of arguments on widely varying topics; his debate style was dubbed the \"Gish Gallop\" by NCSE's executive director Eugenie C. Scott in 1994. But scientists quickly concluded in the words of Karl Fezer, writing in 199, that \"Gish will say, with rhetorical flourish and dramatic emphasis, whatever he thinks will serve to maintain, in the minds of his uncritical followers, his image as a knowledgeable 'creation scientist.\"' Gish spoke to the biases of a segment of Christendom that discounted science for a biblicist understanding of God and nature. --abstracted from bio, Newsletter.*\ntop\nRobert P.

Hamilton, MA, passed quietly on February 12, 2020, at the Masconomet HealthCare Center after a brief illness. Son of John W. Haas, Sr. and Ada Bowles Haas, “Jack” was born in Philadelphia, PA, on February 19, 1930. He received his BS degree in chemistry from King’s College, DE, where he also met his future bride, Ann Sutliff Haas, beloved wife of 66 years. Jack went on to achieve MS and PhD degrees in physical chemistry from the University of Delaware in preparation for his career as a college chemistry professor and scientific researcher at Grove City and Gordon Colleges. Jack was an elder and deacon in the First Presbyterian Church Northshore, where he also played the organ for over 40 years. An active community member, he served on the Hamilton Conservation Commission, Historical Society, and Chebacco Woods and Lake Associations.\nJack heard about the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) while he was a King’s College student from his science professor, Omar Olney. He joined the ASA in January 1957, when he was a graduate student at the University of Delaware, and remained a member for 63 years. When Olney went to Gordon College in 1960 as the sole biology professor, he arranged for Jack to get an interview to start the chemistry department at Gordon. Jack joined Gordon in 1961 and within two years he was chairman of the New England section of the ASA.\nJack was an avid advocate of the ASA and its mission of expanding the discourse on science and Christian faith. He was a visionary and often identified leading-edge possibilities for the ASA. His first letter published in PSCF in 1971 urged the ASA to produce 5-minute radio broadcasts for widespread use on Christian radio stations, although there is little evidence that this was done. Later, in 1994, Jack brought the ASA to the digital world when he convened an impromptu gathering at the annual meeting to consider starting an ASA website. Terry Gray was a new member who attended and offered to take the lead in implementing it. In 1996 Jack helped found the ASA Press which published several books. He had a deep passion that ASA should provide resources to churches and the public that taught good science. He had the idea of creating an online Members in Glory page. He faithfully filled in all the information he could and he is now the latest entry.\nASA had the fortune of having Jack on the executive council from 1973 to 1978. In 1980, when Bill Sisterson suddenly resigned as executive director and Bob Herrmann expressed interest in taking that role if he could return to the Boston area, Jack stepped in. He and Dean of Faculty Judson Carlberg worked with President Dick Gross to arrange for Bob to have a joint appointment as an adjunct professor and pre-med advisor at Gordon College. As a result, the ASA offices relocated from Elgin, IL, to Ipswich, MA, in Bob’s home. Jack continued to work closely with Bob and the relationship between ASA and Gordon College grew productively.\nIn late 1989 when Wilbur Bullock resigned as editor of PSCF, Jack agreed to succeed him. Jack had been a frequent reviewer of articles for the journal. In addition to his specialty of chemistry, he was deeply interested in philosophy and history of science, making him a natural for the position. In 1995, Jack retired from Gordon College, allowing him to devote even more time to the work of the ASA. He continued as editor until 1999 when Roman Miller succeeded him. Jack authored more than 50 letters, articles, and commentaries in PSCF.\nJack continued to spend much time in the ASA office, particularly focusing on helping build the ASA website. When Terry Gray scanned and did an OCR on the articles in all the ASA journals, Jack worked to edit and format the articles. Jack felt that there should be a lot of discussion about science and faith on the internet. He personally put together a large number of topical discussions that are still available online (see links below), though somewhat outdated now. For many years until the last few months of his life, Jack would search the internet for new news in science and faith and post four articles each day M-F on the ASA Facebook page and Twitter. He felt there should be an archive of tributes in memory of ASA members who had passed into glory. He started the obituary page, now called Members in Glory, and patiently scanned the internet for information to create as complete a compilation as possible. He maintained the page until a year before his death. He is the latest entry, for now.\nWhen I succeeded Don Munro as ASA Executive Director in 2005, Jack was very influential in working with me to help me understand the mission of ASA and the big picture of science and faith. We became close friends, meeting virtually every week for coffee and discussion. These discussions moved from the ASA office to Williams Bakery, then Sofia’s coffee shop, and finally to Jack’s home until our last meeting on January 14, 2020. I helped him attend many local lectures and travel to many ASA annual meetings, his last, other than Gordon College, being the 2012 meeting at Point Loma.\nIn addition to his many accomplishments and acts of service, Jack will be especially remembered as a devoted and faithful husband, a loving and present father who passed on the important things of life to his children, a loyal friend, one who took joy in intellectual banter, and a man who loved and served his God with his whole life.\nSelected links to key papers or work by or about Jack Haas:\nFamily obituary\nASA Eulogy for Jack Haas by Dick Wright\nASA Eulogy for Jack Haas by Randy Isaac\nASA Eulogy for Jack Haas by Vicki Best\nTopical Discussions\nList of all ASA journal publications by Jack Haas\nThe ASA at 50\nThe ASA in Transition\nA Golden Moment (half-century of the ASA Journal)\nThe Journal of the ASA at 50\nOn Intelligent Design, Irreducible Complexity, and Theistic Science--1997\nComplementarity and Christianity--An Assessment:\nPart 1: Classical Complementarity\nPart 2: Logical Complementarity\nCorrection to \"Complentarity and Christianity\"\nRandy Isaac\nASA Executive Director Emeritus\ntop\nFrederick H Hafner (1912-2014) Food Chemist\nFred H.

He became active in ASA, for example, leading a discussion at the 1969 annual meeting at Gordon College on “Can a Christian Accept a Mechanistic Origin of Life?” In 1974 he lectured at Gordon College on “Christian Faith and the Scientific Mind.” Together with more than a dozen other ASA members, Bob was a member of the Federation Christian Fellowship subgroup of the American Societies for Experimental Biology. He was elected to the ASA Executive Council in 1978 while he was on the faculty at the Oral Roberts University School of Medicine. He was serving as president of the council when, in 1981, the council was informed that Bill Sisterson was unexpectedly resigning as executive director. Bob was eager to go back to the Northeast and was also very interested in leading the ASA which was then located in Elgin, Illinois. Sensing an opportunity, Jack Haas at Gordon College helped construct a package deal that would give Bob an adjunct professor and pre-med advisor position at Gordon as well as being Executive Director of the ASA, if ASA would move its headquarters to the Northeast. The deal was accepted and the Herrmanns moved to Ipswich, MA. His house became the ASA headquarters, which later moved to leased space in downtown Ipswich.\nThe ASA was privileged to have Bob serve as Executive Director from 1981 to 1994. He was a major factor in revitalizing the ASA. An unfortunate office fire in 1979 had destroyed many records and the sudden departure of Executive Director Bill Sisterson left the ASA in a difficult situation. Harry Lubansky served as an interim director until Bob was able to move to Ipswich and take the reins.\nPerhaps Bob is best known for pursuing the John Templeton connection to ASA. While perusing the membership list for possible sources of funding, Bob noticed that John M. Templeton was a member. Knowing of his investment prowess, Bob visited him at Lyford Cay in the Bahamas while Bob was vacationing there. John immediately solicited Bob’s help in reviewing a book he was writing. Soon their relationship blossomed, leading to five jointly authored books. Meanwhile, John became a fan of the ASA, supplying both some funding as well as additional visibility and members from the Unity Church. In 1987 Bob helped John found the John Templeton Foundation (JTF) which currently is one of the largest sources of funding for research in science and faith. Bob published eight articles in PSCF, four of which were co-authored with John Templeton.\nOne of the most significant ventures that Bob initiated and led was the ASA/Templeton Lecture series. Funded by the JTF, the ASA managed a nation-wide series of lectures at colleges and universities on science and faith, raising awareness of both the ASA and issues of science and faith. When Bob retired in 1994, Don Munro succeeded him as executive director and continued working out the logistics of the lecture series which concluded around 2003.\nHe loved his family and enjoyed birdwatching, boating, the company of dogs, and discussions on science and Christian faith. He will be greatly missed and remembered with affection.\nFor those of us who knew him personally, Bob was a great inspiration. I recall attending both annual meetings and local chapter meetings of the ASA where Bob took specific interest in me, welcoming and encouraging me. The JTF and Gordon College continue to sponsor an annual lecture series in his honor, sustaining the work that he dearly loved.\nRandy Isaactop\nJohn Hiben (1925-1984) Psychology of Parsons, Kansas,\nDied in July 1984 at age 59, according to a note from his wife, Marian. Born in Minneapolis, John graduated from Bethel College and did graduate work in psychology at Minnesota and Kansas, earning an M.A. in 1961. At the time of his death he was a clinical psychologist at the Parsons State Hospital and Training Center, and an active participant in the First Baptist Church of Parsons.\ntop\nFrederick Slocum Hickernell (1932-2016) Physicist\nFred S Hickernell went to be with the Lord on July 5, 2016. He was born on January 16, 1932. He is survived by his wife, Thresa, of 62 years and four children and seven grandchildren.\nHe earned a bachelor’s degree in education from Arizona State College, the forerunner of Arizona State University (ASU), and studied meteorology at UCLA for a year. He served as a weather officer in the Air Force for several years, eventually rising to the rank of major in the Air Force reserve. He worked for Motorola for over 38 years. While working for Motorola he completed his advanced degrees, earning a Master’s degree in science and a PhD in physics, both from ASU. Fred was elected a Fellow of the IEEE for contributions to the development of acoustic and optical surface wave devices for electronic systems applications.\nFred became a member of the American Scientific Affiliation in 1968. He had a very special association with fellow ASA members because they were from all different educational backgrounds. Coming together with their knowledge of Christ as it associated with their scientific understanding was a great learning experience. Fred was elected Fellow and served twice on the Executive Council of the ASA. He was elected to the council in 1991 for a five year term. In 2001 he rejoined the council for two years to fill in for Bill Cobern who resigned from the council at that time.\nFred was the program chair for the highly successful 1999 ASA annual meeting at John Brown University. Bill Phillips was the featured speaker, talking about his recent Nobel prize in physics. Fred and Thresa attended many annual meetings. He frequently led the ASA Fellows lunch and was a great encouragement to all those in attendance.\ntop\nWilliam H. Hildemann (1927- 1983) Immunogenetics\nAmyotropic lateral sclerosis (\"Lou Gehrig's disease\") claimed his life of on 8 Sept. 1983 after two years of severe illness. An internationally known authority on the comparative genetics of the immune system, he was a professor of microbiology and immunology at UCLA Medical School in Los Angeles. His immunological work helped lead the way to heart and kidney transplants. Bill Hildemann was born in Los Angeles in 1927.\nAfter obtaining his bachelor's degree and an M.S. at USC he served as a First Lieutenant in the First Marine Division during the Korean War. He returned to earn a Ph.D in immunogenetics at Cal Tech, then spent a postdoctoral year in London before joining the UCLA faculty in 1957. He eventually served as chair of the Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology and as director of the UCLA Dental Research Institute. Bill helped to found two international journals and published almost 200 papers in his 26 years at UCLA. An interest in aquatic life began with his Ph.D. work on immune responses in fish. Bill continued to study the phylogeny of the immune response in such organisms as corals and sponges.\nHe had a great love for the South Pacific and at one time served as dean of Hilo College at the U. of Hawaii. Bill's widow, Mrs. Dorothy Hildemann, wrote to us about her husband's lifelong participation in the Lutheran church. A Sunday school teacher for many years, he was also active in the Lutheran Campus Council at UCLA. He and Dorothy met in church and were attending Village Lutheran Church in Westwood. Because Bill had been a jogger, swimmer, and scuba diver, his debilitating disease was a heavy burden to him, she said, \"but his faith in God never wavered.\" Bill Hildemann joined ASA in Aug. 1982, perhaps after one of our readers called his attention to mention of his name in the Jun/Jul issue of the Newsletter. We had quoted a letter he wrote in Science (5 Mar. 1982) on the creation/evolution controversy, and a later letter responding to his. We thought Bill's final rejoinder was superb. In fact we planned to quote it in a story we still haven't found room for, on articulating Christian faith in secular journals.\nBill said he did not advocate \"mixing religion with science instruction,\" as charged by his critic. Instead he advocated \"teaching concepts of evolution in a manner that avoids unnecessary strife\" - in a country where perhaps 40 million people perceive evolution as \"ant-God.\" After quoting Judge Overton's decision in the Arkansas Balanced Treatment case, to the effect that such a perception is mistaken, Bill concluded: \"I would add that concepts of creation and evolution are quite compatible if evolution is viewed as a creative process continuing over many millions of years. Individual writers or lecturers could, of course, say much more about divergent beliefs or theories concerning origins, depending on the audience. The integrity of science is not compromised by stating that 'ultimate origins of life and matter are unknown and open to conjecture.' Indeed, evolutionary scientists, among whom I count myself, could well take greater care in separating facts from conjecture.\"Dorothy Hildemann said that response to Bill's letters in Science was very large, running about 9 to 1 in favor of his stand. She also said that coming issues of Immunology Today, Transplantation; and Developmental & Comparative Immunology would all contain special memorial tributes to her husband.

Five years later he became chairman of the college’s Division of Social Sciences. In 1977 he was named Professor Emeritus of Biology.\nDr. Hoover was a highly respected and greatly loved college professor. His well-prepared class presentations were laced with humor and interesting stories. He took a keen interest in students, who regarded him as a mentor. He followed many of his students after their graduation from Messiah College. Several of his students he encouraged to do post-graduate work and later arranged for them to join the college faculty. Younger faculty also saw him as a mentor as well as a father figure. Both former students of the college and faculty members have referred to him as a true servant leader.\nHis hobbies included hiking and bird watching. Especially young people enjoyed walking with him in rural areas, learning about birds and plants. He and the late Clifford Jones spent many hours together, binoculars in hand, enjoying their common interest in birds.*\nKen joined the ASA in 1962 and in 1978 he was elected emeritus by the council, reflecting his emeritus status at Messiah. This gave him lifetime membership in the ASA.\n*From Conklin Funeral Home\ntop\nReijer Hooykaas (1906-1994) Historian of Science\nDutch historian of science and author of Religion and the Rise of Modern Science, died on Jan. 4, 1994, as reported by Christians in Science in Britain. They say:\n\"He was at his best when surrounded by a group of research students in animated discussion. He constantly stressed the need for intellectual humility before the data of both Scripture and the natural world that God has given us, urging us to `sit down before the facts like a little child.' He warned us of the danger of `a fresh idolatry of our minds. This,' he said, `is really the liberal disease, whether it takes the form of orthodoxy or not.'\"\nHooykaas co-taught the Regent C. summer course (Vancouver, BC) on \"Christian Faith and Natural Science\" with his good friend from across the Channel, the late Donald M.

Howell\n(1914-1980) Biology.\nProfessor of biology at Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky, died on January 4, 1980, at age 66, evidently of a heart attack. He had served as professor of biology at Asbury for 22 years, and although retired in 1979 he was still teaching classes at the time of his death. Born in Birmingham, Alabama, he had received an A.B. at Birmingham-Southern College, an M.S. in biology from Auburn, a B.D. from Asbury Theological Seminary, and a Ph.D. from the U. of Alabama. He was a member of a number of scientific societies, especially the American Fisheries and Wildlife Society. He had been president of the Midwest Benthological Society and general secretary of the Kentucky Academy of Sciences. In a memorial service at the Wilmore United Methodist Church, of which he was a member, it was said of Henry Howell that \"he was no isolated or insulated or alienated scientist. His love for God's world and nature was always combined with a love for people. He used his love of nature and the creation to get into the hearts of young people.\" He helped organize the Jessamine County-Wilmore Planning and Zoning Commission, which he chaired for 9 years. Tributes came from county residents who appreciated his efforts to stop pollution of local streams. He was the first Asbury faculty member to receive as a sabbatical grant to study the Jessamine Creek Gorge for recreational and environmental benefits.\nHenry Howell is survived by his wife Irene, two daughters, two sons, a sister, brother, and one granddaughter. Irene Howell wrote to us, saying that Henry had wanted to attend the 1979 ASA Annual Meeting at Stanford, but had not yet adjusted to the pacemaker he had worn since May 1979. He taught fall quarter and the first four days of winter quarter this year.

He was buried on September 4 in Guelph, Ontario, where his parents and siblings were already buried. John received his M.B. in 1915 and his M.D. in 1928, both at the U. of Toronto. He specialized in psychiatry and eventually retired as superintendent of Ontario Hospital in Port Arthur. In addition to membership in various medical societies he was a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and of the American Psychiatric Association. A very-long-time member of ASA (later CSCA), he attended almost every Annual Meeting, generally assisted by his nephew, surgeon John Stewart. According to John Howitt's niece Barbara Stewart Ferguson, the few times when \"Unc\" was physically unable to attend, she listened avidly to her brother's reports of the meetings. John Howitt was a model Christian gentleman of \"the old school\" but he had a twinkle in his eye and a sparkle in his speech. Born on February 29 in a leap year (1892), John often joked about his missing birthdays, including the one he felt cheated of in 1900. Maybe that's what kept him so young. He was remarkably tolerant of young squirts who held views sometimes radically different from his own.\nEd Huff, 90, died Tuesday, January 12, 2021. He was born in Pawtucket RI on August 21, 1930, the youngest of three children of Edward Alonzo and Louise Mary (Remick) Huff. He grew up through first grade in Pawtucket, RI, then moved with his parents to the Huff place in Lyman, ME. He walked a mile to school through 8th grade. He and his parents moved to Kennebunk when he attended Kennebunk High School, graduating in 1948. He graduated from the University of Maine in 1952 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering.\nAfter serving in the Army in New Jersey and Germany, he married Ellen Lewis of Jamaica Plain, MA. He worked as an engineer for General Electric Company for 6 1/2 years, then taught at Wentworth Institute in Boston for 1 1/2 years. In 1962 he moved to Maine with his wife and young daughter, where he got an MS in Agricultural Engineering at the University of Maine in 1966. He taught in that department, later called Bio-Resource Engineering, until his retirement in 1997, with two years taken off to obtain his PhD from the University of Nebraska in 1979 and to work at Valmont Industries in Valley, Nebraska.\nEd joined the American Scientific Affiliation in 1985 and attended the annual meetings frequently. He actively taught and supported the harmony of science and Christian faith in classes at his church, the United Baptist Church of Old Town, and contributed significantly to ASA projects on knowing creation. He was also a member of the Peniel Bible Conference of Lake Luzerne, NY, The American Society of Agricultural Engineers, and was a registered Professional Engineer. He was known for his energy, curiosity, humor, and dedication to God, science, and his family. *Dignity Memorial Obituary\nCarroll Karkalits (1916-2013) Chemical Engineer\nMary H Korte (1946 -2023) Environmentalist\nMary Hurn Korte passed to eternal life in her sleep at home on Sunday, July 30, 2023, at age 77 after a 10-year struggle with heart failure. She was born on March 5, 1946, in Boston, MA, to Eugene W. Hurn and Lola (Gates) Hurn of Henrietta, TX. She is survived by her husband of 54 years, Don W. Korte, Jr., her son Don “Trey” Korte III, her son-in-law Jamie Schounard, and her grandchildren Lizzy, Brooke, and Erin.\nAs the daughter of a US Navy Commander, Mary lived in Boston, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Tokyo, northern Virginia, and then Carmel, CA, where she graduated from high school. She attended The College of William and Mary where she excelled both academically and in women’s athletics. She was a four-year starter in field hockey and three in lacrosse and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society. More importantly, William and Mary was where she met Don whom she married after completing her master’s degree at Southern Illinois University in 1969.\nBefore the birth of Trey, Mary worked as a high school teacher and medical researcher. Her research at St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital in Memphis, TN, was instrumental in determining the calcium-dependence of an important regulatory molecule now known as calmodulin. As an Army wife, Mary established homes in Silver Spring, MD; Presidio, CA; San Francisco, CA; and Columbus, OH, for Don and Trey and did not resume teaching (at Columbus State Community College) until Trey was in high school.\nAfter the Army, Mary and Don took positions in the Department of Natural Sciences at Concordia University Wisconsin. While at Concordia, Mary completed a doctorate from Trinity College/Liverpool University. For over twenty years, Mary taught a variety of science courses at Concordia and was also Director of the Master of Science-Environmental Education program. In addition to science, Mary loved theology obtaining a diploma in Christian Apologetics from The International Academy of Apologetics, Evangelism, and Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. After her retirement, she thoroughly enjoyed being a docent at the Milwaukee County Zoo.\nMary immensely enjoyed all aspects of God’s creation especially when she could experience it firsthand. Her favorite activities were raising/showing dachshunds, riding horses, and being at the beach and the ocean whether sailing on it or snorkeling in it. Some of her happiest times were conducting fish surveys for the Reef Environmental Education Foundation in the Caribbean and the Hawaiian and Society Islands. Mary was a consummate teacher whose passion was to infuse her students—whether secondary, collegiate, or at the zoo—with the same love, respect, and awe for nature that she had.\nMary joined the ASA in 2000. She presented a paper at the 2010 ASA annual meeting on “Faith and Science in Environmental Policy-Making.” At the 2011 ASA annual meeting she co-authored a paper with her husband, Don Korte Jr, on “Bluff Restoration and the Concordia Center for Environmenal Stewardship.”\nJ.

As a teenager, he spent summers working on farms in upstate New York, and one winter he learned how, with horses, to collect sap from maple trees and boil it down in huge iron pots to make syrup. Intending to become a farmer, he was awarded a full scholarship to Cornell University, but allergies led him into Agricultural Economics instead. During his graduate studies in Marketing at Northwestern University, he was active in InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. In January 1971, he started teaching at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. A teacher with high expectations, he also loved research, publishing often in journals of other disciplines, such as mathematical psychology, such that he was part of both the psychology and geography departments in addition to marketing. A regular recipient of grants from the National Science Foundation grants, David and his colleague, psychologist Jerry Zinnes, developed the Proscal software.\nA daily reader of the Bible, David was a charter member of Christ Community Church in Bloomington, where he was an elder and an adult Sunday School teacher. David learned about the ASA from Ted Davis, who joined the same church when he was a doctoral student at Indiana and attended a Bible study led by David. Together, they started an academic discussion group for Christian graduate students and faculty that met weekly in the university library and continued after Ted graduated until David’s death. Although David did not attend ASA meetings and did not publish in the journal, he was a member for more than 43 years, consistent with his lifelong interest in apologetics.\nIn 1968, David married Carole Bartlett from Lafayette, California, a nursing student in Chicago whom he met on a blind date.

Millie, his wife\nof 69 years, and family were with him. He was 93.\nJohnston designed the first atomic bomb detonator and is believed to be the only\neyewitness to all three 1945 atomic explosions - at White Sands, N.M., and in\nJapan at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, events that killed some 200,000 people and\nended World War II. Johnston was assigned to measure the impact of the bombs.\nJohnston had just completed his bachelor's degree and begun graduate work at\nUniversity of California, Berkeley in 1940, when he agreed to follow his mentor,\nNobel-prize-winning Luis Alvarez, to Boston to help develop microwave radar at\nMIT's Radiation Laboratory. By 1943, Johnston had helped develop a\nground-controlled-approach radar blind landing system for airplanes, an\ninvention critical to the success of World War II Battle of Britain and the\npost-war Berlin Airlift.\nBoth Alvarez and Johnston then moved to Los Alamos,\nN.M., to help develop the atomic bomb.\nBack at Berkeley after the war, Johnston helped Alvarez build a new type of\nproton linear accelerator. Johnston then headed construction of a larger version\nof it at the University of Minnesota, and worked on another at Stanford\nUniversity. In 1967, the Johnston's moved to Moscow where he served as physics\nprofessor at the University of Idaho until 1988. He focused on nuclear physics,\nlasers and molecular spectroscopy. After retiring, Johnston continued to give\ntalks about his experiences to all ages, from elementary school children to\nscientists. A natural teacher, Johnston used many occasions as teachable\nmoments. When fishing, gutting fish meant also examining contents of the fish's\nstomach and asking his kids to decipher its last meal. \"Hmm, caddis fly larvae.\"\nFriends and family teased Johnston that his interest in explosives went back to\nhis birth on Chinese New Year - known for its fireworks - Feb. 11, 1918, in\nShantung Province, China, to Christian missionaries. A picture at age 3 shows\nhim grinning and holding a large Chinese firecracker. The family spent Larry's\nfifth summer traveling across the USA in a Model-T Ford, paying farmers 25 cents\nto camp on their property and visiting national parks. Ever after, Larry loved\ncamping and the outdoors.\nJohnston was asked in post-war years whether he regretted working on the A bomb.\n\"My answer,\" Johnston told an MIT interviewer in 1991, \"is that I felt very\nprivileged to be part of an effort that promised to end the war abruptly, and\nwhich had the prospect of saving many lives, both Japanese and American.\"\nJohnston, known for his wit and kindness to all, held this view even during\nheated debate over the ethics of the bomb in more recent decades.\nJohnston devoted much of his retirement to improving the relationship between\nmodern science and the Bible. He was a member and later a fellow of the ASA from 1950 until his\ndeath in 2011. A proponent of intelligent design, Johnston sought\nunderstanding of evolutionary biology from the University of Idaho's Holly Wichman and James Foster through weekly lunchtime sessions that continued until\nhis death.\nHe enjoyed jousting with younger ASAer's on the list serve.\nMillie and Larry treasured two trips to Israel where they worked on Biblical\narcheology projects and Larry helped Israeli scientists use sonar to locate\npotential dig sites.

Grace can still walk but can now speak only short sentences. She becomes confused and disoriented and does not always recognize Glenn. \"I am so grateful for the help God provides through the Christian family,\" The fellowship of ASA meetings means a lot to Glenn, whose stress-tested faith could cheer anyone through dark days, weeks, months-or years.

Born19 October 1884 28 30 Frederiksberg Denmark. Death: 16 March 1962 Plainfield, New Jersey. A native of Denmark who came to the U.S. in 1912. Married Ida Jepperine Hansen 20 December 1912.\nLangmack taught physical education., physics., mathematics and character building in such institutions as Minnesota State Teachers, College, University of Minnesota, New Jersey State Teachers College, Battle Creek and the Naval Academy at Annapolis. After his retirement, Dr. Langmack devoted his time to philosophical research, particularly the unification of science and religion through a concept of mathematical relativity. His publications include:\n\"God and the Universe\", \"Let There Be Light\", \"God's World and Science\", and\n\"Scientific Faith and Logical Science\", and to be published \"Science By The Way of The Cross\".\nHe founded and directed the Kolding Ny Realskole before immigrating to the United States with his recently-married wife, who like himself was a skilled gymnast and whom he met at the 1912 Olympics where, as a representative of Denmark, she placed second in gymnastics.\nHis American career began with the teaching of Danish gymnastics and physical education in Hutchinson, Minnesota (1913-1915). This was followed by physical education teaching positions and professorships at Seward Junior High School in Minneapolis, Minnesota State Teachers College, the University of Minnesota Summer School, New Jersey State Teachers College in Trenton, Savage College in New York City, and briefer appointments at such institutions as Cornell and Temple Universities. He also served as physical culture specialist at Battle Creek College (1926-1928). From 1928 to 1954 he was specialist in physical culture and character education at Paul Junior High School in Washington, DC, during which period he also lectured at the University of Maryland, George Washington University, and the U.S. Army Parachute School at Ft. Benning, Georgia. After his retirement in 1954, he devoted much time to his life-long interest in the unification of science, philosophy, and Christianity.\nThe most prominent publications of Mr. Langmack are his books entitled\nFootball Conditioning (NY: A. S. Barnes Co., 1921), which presents a progressive exercise program based upon Danish gymnastics and carries an introduction by Knut Rockne, the famous football coach at Notre Dame University, and\nGod and the Universe (NY: Philosophical Library, 1953) which outlines the story of creation using mathematical symbolism and concepts of relativity and absoluteness from the fields of physics and biology.\nThe following statements from the tribute to his memory presented by his friend, Dr. Spencer Miller, Jr., former Undersecretary of Labor (under Eisenhower), at his funeral indicate the great respect in which he was held by his friends:\nWhen I first met Holger Christian Langmack I was immediately attracted to him by his dynamic energy, the catholicity of his interests, the spiritual depth of his thought, and his utter dedication to the service of Almighty God. As our acquaintance developed into a loving friendship I came to value his intellectual integrity and his moral courage in addition to the four other qualities of his sterling character No movement for human betterment was alien to his spirit. Our last such pilgrimage together was the Annual Presidential Prayer Breakfast in Washington and the Annual Conference of International Christian Leadership. What an inspiration it was to him and Ida and what a joy for him to meet so many Christian leaders the world around. They recognized in him one of their own. When I introduced him to Billy Graham and Abraham Vereide his eyes sparkled as he met these two great spiritual leaders and outstanding examples of God-guided lives.\nTo Washington he carried a draft letter to the President of the United States which outlined a plan to meet the threat of atheistic communism by the establishment of an Academy of International Freedom under God. It was a unique and profound conception. It would have heartened President Kennedy and Holger had he been able to present this inspired idea in person to the President\nOn the lapel of his coat he wore a gold yoke-fellow button� the symbol of the universal ministry as developed by Dr. Elton Trueblood. He could subscribe whole-heartedly to the six-fold discipline of this ministry because it was the pattern of his life. When Our lord said,\n\"take my yoke upon you,\" it was a symbol of our shared Burden. The yoke is not an extra weight to bear but is actually a means of support to ease the load.\nHis life was Christ centered. He never seemed so truly himself as when he was praising and thanking God by song or the spoken word. In all he has written over a hundred songs of praise At the close of his book, God and the Universe, are two lines of his which are the testament of his faith and his belief in the Victory of Christ:\nNewsletter, JASA, June 1963, pp. 65-66 *\ntop\nT.

Health reasons for brother,\nLeonard had the family moving to a more rural environment in Los\nAltos Hills. They lived among the fruit trees. They\nattended a one-room schoolhouse, Ken through 8th grade. Ken had a\ndelightful life in the country, playing with and growing up with\nyounger brother, Leonard. Those were really good years amidst\nthe depression. At age 15, he went back to the city, in Palo\nAlto, California. Ken was a boys scout, attaining the honor of\nbecoming an Eagle Scout. This is also the time he started to\nplay the trombone.\nKen spent two years at San Jose State College and twelve years at\nStanford Uniersity where he received his Ph.D. in Physical\nchemistry. In between he spent some time in the US Navy.\nWhile studying for his graduate degree, he did research for Kaiser\nAluminum Corp. He then went to work at the Navy Lab in San\nFrancisco and finally to NASA at Moffett Field, retiring from there\nin 1995.\nIt was significant that the Jupiter Galileo\nspacecraft Ken worked on when he began at NASA in 1970 arrived at\nthe planet after he retired. At the onset, most of his time\nwas spent research heat-shield materials for the probe, that part of\nthe dual spacecraft designed to plunge into the dense atmosphere of\nJupiter. He was also part of the team that managed the design\nof the probe and accommodation for the six on-board instruments.\nThe probe was scheduled to be launched from the Space Shuttle\nearlier, but the Challenger accident resulted in a delay of 3-4\nyears. It was launched from another shuttle in 1989.\nRecently, he shared his main\npassions:\nMusic had a special place for Ken, specifically\nbeing part of the band, playing his trombone. As mentioned, he has\nplayed since junior high. He was in his high school orchestra\nand band, the Stanford band and Primetime band. Dance music\nfavorites included Stardust and Deep Purple, In the mood, Sleepy\nLagoon.\nNotes from the ASA Newsletter: Attended ASA Luncheon\nat AAAS meeting in 1967. By 1975\nKen was employed at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field,\nCA. Ken had been earth-bound so far, doing mass spectrometric studies\nof laser vaporization of high-temperature materials, thern drawn\ninto the proposed Pioneer mission to Jupiter. Target date of\nthe \"launch window\" to Jupiter was late December 1981\n(actually 1989). The light weight of Pioneer-class spinning\nspacecraft allows an atmospheric probe and an orbiter mission to\nJupiter to be combined into a single launch. So if all went well, a\ncomprehensive exploration of Jupiter, its atmosphere, the\nsurrounding physical environment, and its extensive satellite system\ncan be made. The trick is to put together an orbiting spacecraft\n\"bus\" and an atmospheric probe designed to survive a descent to a\npressure of 10 bars or more. The scenario will then be something\nlike this: \"The probe is released about 57 days prior to encounter\nwith the planet; the spacecraft is retargeted after probe separation\nto a closest approach and phased to communicate\nwith the probe. The probe enters the atmosphere on the light side of\nthe planet, decelerates, and relays in-situ data to the over-flying\nspacecraft during the 30-40 minute descent to 10 bars or more.\nShortly thereafter the spacecraft retro, propulsion system (RPU) is\nignited to inject the spacecraft with its science payload into\norbit about Jupiter and proceeds on its three-year mission of\nplanetary observation.\"\nData from this\nchoreography would help reconstruct the radial, chemical, and\nthermal structures of the primordial solar nebula. Of particular\ninterest was Jupiter's enormous, fast-rotating magnetic field with\nits associated trapped environment. Ken's responsibility was the mass spectrometer on the\natmospheric Entry Probe. He is technical monitor for the preliminary\nexperiments, conceptual designs, contracts, and anything else\nrelated to the mass spectrometer.

The seventh child of The Reverend EH\nLindquist and Esther Nyberg Lindquist, he spent his childhood all over\nthe western United States in communities where his father pastored and\nhis family hosted missionaries. These included Georgetown, Texas;\nStromsburg, Nebraska; Seattle, Washington, where he graduated from\nBallard High School; and Kingsburg, California. While attending Fresno\nState College, he courted Ingrid Adele Walden from Kingsburg. In 1940\nthey married for life, until she passed away in 2004.\nAfter teaching school for one year at John Muir Elementary in Fresno, he spent a year\nas a USDA fruit inspector. He was drafted in 1942, but the army delayed\nhis induction until after his first son Douglas was born, in 1943. During basic\ntraining, and based on his short career as a food inspector, his captain\nmade him a Medical Aid Man, assisting the medic. After a few months in England, his unit\ncrossed over Omaha Beach five days after D-Day. Attached to an Artillery\nDivision, he worked his way across northern France, and into Belgium. During the battle around\nAachen, Germany, he and his medic leader were seriously injured in a\nminefield. His lower legs were shattered, and he eventually lost his\nright eye, injuries which earned him the Purple Heart. It was six weeks\nbefore Ingrid received a telegram that he was alive. After almost a year\nof convalescence, he was discharged from the army. Although doctors said\nhe would never walk again, with determination and faith he lived an\nactive life, including building family cabins, traveling, horseback\nriding, fishing, and attending grandson's soccer games.\nWhile originally\nwanting to pursue studies in education, Stan's interests turned toward\npsychology as a way of helping others. At the University of Chicago he\nmajored in physiological and comparative psychology, minored in\nexperimental psychology and took a second full major in clinical\npsychology. He completed a Ph.D. in 1950. He did all this while\nsupporting his young family by teaching at Trinity Bible College and\ndirecting their choir.\nResponding to a call to be a Christian\nprofessor in a state school, he and his young family returned to Fresno\nwhere he became the third faculty member of the new Psychology\nDepartment at Fresno State College in 1953. He served many years as the\nPsychology Department Chairperson, and was a professor at the University\nuntil\nretiring in 1990. He was a positive influence on his colleagues and the\nyoung adults he taught. He always enjoyed hearing from former students\nHe shared a\ngreat family adventure with his wife and three sons when they\naccompanied him on a sabbatical in Europe in 1961-62. There he felt led\nto reach out as a counselor to missionaries and pastors who\nwere experiencing struggles in their cross-cultural ministry. After\nreturning to Fresno, with encouragement from Ingrid and other close\nfamily members, he established Link Care Center in 1964. Link Care was\ndeveloped to serve pastors and missionaries around the world who had\nneed for\nChristian oriented counseling and psychotherapy. While it has also\nserved as a counseling resource to the greater central California area,\nover its 49 years, Link Care has served over 5,000 pastors\nmissionaries, and families.\nStan was a man of great energy and desire to\nget things done. In addition to teaching at CSU, Fresno, his work with\nLink Care, and private counseling practice, Stan was an active lifelong member of the\nEvangelical Free Church of Fresno, one of the churches his father\nfounded. He greatly loved singing in the choir and as a soloist. He made\ntime for hobbies and exhibited his love of wood turning through some\nbeautiful bowls and vases. He also dabbled in other forms of fine art,\nwith various degrees of success. He was never idle and never complained about the\naches and pains from his wartime injuries. Stan was a true 'citizen of the world,' and he and Ingrid traveled extensively, always\nwith an eye for the needs of pastors and missionaries in other regions.\nEven in his late eighties, he took an extensive trip to Africa, where he applied his newfound\nskills with digital photography to capture wildlife. Later, he took a\nriver cruise in Russia.

Died October 14, 2010.\n\"WHEN most\npeople think of semiconductors, the devices which ushered in the computer age, they think of somewhere like Silicon Valley in California. But home-grown scientist Lawrence Lyons was considered one of the very greatest minds in what is hoped to be the next generation of the devices, organic semiconductors. His seminal work,\nOrganic Semiconductors, co-authored with Felix Gutmann and published in 1966, was so influential that a pirated edition was even published in the USSR in 1970.\nA supplementary volume Professor Lyons co-authored, which came out in 1983, underpinned the emerging field of molecular electronics - the science of manipulating polymers, or plastics, so they act as transistors and sources of light\"\n\"These days it is an important field which holds out hope of helping solve the global warming challenge, among other things. Cheap organic materials might one day form the heart of low-cost solar panels, to name just one use. Professor Lyons' pioneering work into making very thin, pure organic films which could capture the energy of the sun set benchmarks for the research taking place around the world today.\nBorn in Sydney in 1922, he developed an interest in academia from his paternal grandfather, who was a school teacher. His younger brother, Lloyd, was also academically minded and later read medicine at Sydney University. Professor Lyons was a bright student from his earliest days at Sydney Boys High School. After matriculation, he studied science at Sydney University, winning the Liversidge Scholarship in 1939 and then the Caird Scholarship. His scientific efforts were to be put to practical use from the outset because of the outbreak of war.\"\n\"At the time, Australia had embarked on a project to build the nation's first military aircraft, the Wirraway. This required lightweight alloys, so Professor Lyons was tasked with leading a team focused on developing aluminium alloys. He served with the RAAF, then won the British Ramsay Fellowship for chemistry before deciding to pursue a doctorate at University College, London, one of the world's most prestigious tertiary institutions (at that time it boasted two Nobel Prize winners in chemistry).\nHe duly returned from Britain with the title Dr Lyons and was appointed lecturer at Sydney University, rising to senior lecturer and then reader in chemistry. While working there he met his wife-to-be, Alison, an arts graduate at the university. In 1963 he moved north of the Tweed after being appointed to the chair of physical chemistry at the University of Queensland, a position he held until his retirement in 1987. His research over the years garnered him two Fulbright scholarships, in 1957 and 1979, the HG Smith Medal for Chemistry (1968) and the Burfitt Prize for Chemistry (1968). He was also made a Leverhulme senior fellow at the University of Tokyo and Debye lecturer at Cornell University in the United States, as well as working at Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard and Princeton, among many other institutions. Capping a lifetime of achievement, in 1971 he was elected a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, the highest scientific honour Australia offers its scientists, while in 1987 the University of Queensland appointed him an emeritus professor. Apart from his science, a driving force in his life was his Christian faith.\nWith his wife and other evangelical academics, he founded three Anglican residential halls at Sydney University and New College at the University of NSW.

His son, John, said that \"he was always thankful to be a part of the ASA and to contribute to it.\" Allan was a prof. of systematic theology and apologetics at Biblical Theological Seminary. He studied under R. A. Torrey, who advised him to go to Princeton Theological Seminary. There, he studied under Robert Dick Wilson and J. Gresham Machen, and became convinced of the necessity of a scholarly defense of the inspiration of the Scriptures. Later, during his time at the U. of Berlin, he made a trip to Palestine, where he met archaeologist Sir Flinders Petrie and studied under William F. Albright. With Albright, he participated in the exciting discovery of the biblical city of Ham (Gen. 14).\nAfter returning from Europe, he assumed a professorship of Old Testament at Westminster Theological Seminary for eight years, then completed his Ph.D. at the U. of Pennsylvania under Ephraim A. Speiser. In 1937, he joined with Carl McIntire and others, with no resources but faith, to form Faith Theological Seminary, and served as its first president. Among the members of the entering class were Vernon Grounds, John W. Sanderson Jr., Norman Jerome and Jack W. Murray.\nDuring the 1943-44 school year, a student, Grace E. Sanderson, became his wife. During their honeymoon in the Grand Canyon, three army fliers parachuted out of a failing bomber, floated into the canyon and spent the next ten days on an isolated plateau. The search for these airmen drew nationwide attention. A veteran park ranger, aware that MacRae, a veteran of many long Canyon trips, was there at the time, sent word to join him in the rescue attempt. They went down from the north rim, located a narrow deer trail down the precipitous cliffs and brought the three fliers out in good health. The story made Time and other magazines, and all the newspapers. MacRae used the many invitations to speak of the adventure to drive home a gospel application to thousands in many different kinds of organizations and settings.\nIn 1971, he joined Jack W. Murray in establishing the Biblical School of Theology, and retired as its president in 1983. Some of his former students include: Francis A. Schaeffer, Joseph T. Bayley, Vernon Grounds, Kenneth S. Kantzer, Arthur F. Glasser, G. Douglas Young, Samuel J. Shultz, Jack W. Murray, R. Laird Harris, and Paul Gilchrist. Allan's boyhood friend, John's Uncle Phil, told him that one of the things he appreciated about his father was that he had never heard him demeaning other people or groups. John said: \"My father was involved in several church conflicts, but I never heard him denouncing other believers. In the midst of differences, he tried to stay focused on the principles rather than the personalities. The cause of Christ was what mattered to him.\"\nMacRae had also done work for the NIV Bible translation, was president of Evangelical Theological Seminary, and was an honorary fellow of the ASA. He participated in the early conventions of the ASA and encouraged other conservative theologians and biblical scholars to join the organization.

During those years, he worked at a can factory, raced velodrome bicycles, and ran track and field.\nAfter graduating with a Master’s Degree in physics, he enrolled in the Navy as an officer in the Canadian services and served on the Camperdown, a destroyer of the 19th Destroyer Flotilla, British Pacific Fleet. He was the chief radar officer on his ship, and one of the first radar experts in the Navy. Prince Philip was the chief radar officer of the fleet, and he and Frank shared daily phone calls to calibrate their clocks and their radar positions.\nHe subsequently attended Purdue University to study physics, where he was on a team of researchers that built the first synchrotron, precursor to the cyclotron. It was there he met his future wife Anne through Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship, was married, and Lisa and David were born. Late in life, one of his favorite memories was a visit to the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, where one of his guides was his grand-nephew, grandson of his brother Stephen. He never lost his love of nuclear physics!\nFrank took a teaching position at the Colorado School of Mines before he finished his doctorate. Summers were spent working on research projects for the National Bureau of Standards, DECO Electronics, the U.S. Navy, US AID and the American Scientific Affiliation. His travels took him to far- flung destinations experiencing local living conditions, and challenging projects – some classified, some pertaining to alternative energy generation. Some of his research projects involved sea ice flows, low frequency radio wave transmission for submarine communications as well as deep space radio astronomy.\nIn 1964, joined a PhD program in Geophysics in the Oceanography Department at Oregon State University. His focus of research was the Sicilian volcano, Mt. Etna. His advisor was a renowned Icelandic vulcanologist, and he spent months on the slopes of Mt. Etna collecting data before writing his dissertation. Collecting data meant lying next to the hot lava flows wearing an Asbestos and foil body suit measuring electromagnetic currents using probes inserted into the flowing lava to determine pyroclastic potentiality. He loved that the Italian Nonna (grandmothers) would send baskets of food up the mountain for lunch and dinner via cable car.\nBack in Colorado after graduating from OSU, Frank was involved in setting up the Colorado Solar Energy Research Institute, and taught the first course in Solar Energy at CSM.

Newsletter*\ntop\nJohn Warwick Montgomery (1931–2024) Barrister, Apologist, Theologian\nJohn Warwick Montgomery passed away on September 25, 2024. He was born on October 18, 1931, in Warsaw, New York, to Maurice Warwick Montgomery and Harriet Smith Montgomery. John's father owned a retail feed company, so when they discovered that young John had severe, life-threatening allergies to farm animals, he was sent to live with his grandmother, who was a believing Christian and a Fundamentalist Baptist with a very high view of Scripture and its accuracy.\nJohn attended Cornell University and majored in classics, and it was while at Cornell that he first encountered serious orthodox and evangelical theology. He was converted to Christianity in 1949. Montgomery immediately sought to determine which expression of Christianity most clearly mirrored the Scriptures, so he set the Greek text of the New Testament alongside the thirty-nine Articles of the Anglican Church of England, the Reformed Heidelberg Catechism, and the Lutheran Augsburg Confession. He concluded that Lutheranism adhered most closely to the biblical text and promptly became a confessional Lutheran, later operating within the conservative Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod. Montgomery appreciated how Lutheran theology emphasized the doctrine of justification as the central doctrine on which the church rises or falls, and early in his academic studies he decided to focus on the defense and proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ while advocating for the total reliability of the Scriptures.\nMontgomery finished his studies at Cornell University, graduating in 1952 with distinction and a degree in philosophy and classics. His academic studies were far from over, as he later earned an additional eleven degrees, including: a BLS (1954) and MA (1958) from University of California-Berkeley, an MDiv (1958) and STM (1960) from Wittenberg University, a PhD (1962) from the University of Chicago, a ThD (1964) from the University of Strasbourg, an LLB (1977) from LaSalle University, a diploma (1978) from the International Institute of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, an MPhil (1983) from the University of Essex, an honorary doctorate (1999) from the Institute for Religion and Law in Moscow, an LLM (2000) and LLD (2003) from Cardiff University in Wales. A full and extensive obituary of him is available at the Apologetics Academy. In summary, John Warwick Montgomery's impact can be best understood by seeing him as an evangelical, evidential, and confessional Lutheran apologist.\nJohn Montgomery joined the ASA prior to 1960. He was elected an ASA Fellow and joined the Journal editorial board in 1965. He presented a highly rated plenary session at the 1965 ASA annual meeting at King’s College in Briarcliff Manor, NY. He organized a well-attended (~90 people) \"Birthplaces of the Reformation\" tour of Europe in 1970 which was repeated the following year. He authored about 50 books and wrote extensive articles. Four articles were published in the Journal of the ASA as well as one letter to the editor.\ntopIrwin A. Moon (1918-1986) Science Educator, Evangelist\nDied on 7 May 1986 at age 78 and was buried in Placenia, California. He is survived by his wife Margaret and four children. Irwin was known throughout the world as producer and host of the famous Moody science films. He founded the Moody Institute of Science, a branch of Moody Bible Institute, Dr. Irwin A. Moon presented his famous million-volt demonstration before hundreds of thousands in his unique Sermons from Science lectures and directed it until his retirement in 1972. Under his direction MIS produced 39 educational films, which won 27 national and international awards. After retirement he remained active in its work as an advisor and friend of the staff.\nWorking with youth as a young pastor in Los Angeles, Moon found the visual approach especially effective in reaching young people with the gospel. He devised a set of the old 31/4 by 41/4 inch glass slides entitled, \"The Microscope, the Telescope, and the Bible.\" That presentation eventually formed the basis of the first Moody science film, \"The God of Creation.\"\nIn the 1930's according to Alton Everest, \"The American Scientific Affiliation owes its existence directly to Irwin Moon. He saw that many of the students he counseled had questions about the relationship of science to Christian faith. He convinced Will H. Houghton, president of Moody Bible Institute, of the need to do something. Houghton then arranged that first meeting in 1941 from which sprang the ASA.\"\nOut of a flood of memories, Alton was surprised to find one in particular that kept coming back, from a time when they were working together 40 years ago on the film, \"Voice of the Deep.\" Alton wrote, \"We were both in Navy deep-sea diving outfits on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean at Emerald Cove, Santa Catalina Island. Suddenly the reassuring throb of the engine driving the air compressor sped, leaving only a couple of minutes of air in our suits. Also eliminated was the usual method of ascent by blowing up the suit and shooting up like a balloon. Now it was grunt work, hand over hand up a line. When we finally reached the line, I motioned for Irwin to climb up first. He motioned for me to do the same. That Alfonso-Gaston procedure went ' on for some time, wasting precious seconds, until I realized anew that Irwin would rather suffocate than give in. Not being endowed with such competitive drive and rather yearning for a breath of air, I gave in. \"That was the Irwin we knew and loved, and whose talents and ability we respected. He is gone now, but the institutions he established continue to do the Lord's work.\" Newsletter, Also, Everest, History of the ASA. *\ntop\nStanley Wayne Moore (1937–2022), Political scientist\nStanley Wayne Moore, age 84, of Pasadena, California, passed away on Wednesday, January 5, 2022. Stanley was born February 11, 1937, in New Jersey. He was a member of the Political Science faculty of Pepperdine University.\nStan joined the ASA in 1973. He and his wife, Nancy who was a Presbyterian minister, faithfully and enthusiastically supported the ASA for the rest of his life. They attended many annual meetings, most recently the 2012 and the 2016 meetings at Point Loma and Azusa Pacific, respectively.\nStan was the program chair for the ASA annual meeting at Pepperdine in 1988. That meeting included Richard Bube as a plenary speaker. Stan was the local arrangements chair when the ASA annual meeting was once more held at Pepperdine in 2002.\n(Oct 6, 1918 - Feb 25, 2006) Ccreationist leader, dies at Age 87. Henry M. Morris died February 25 after a series of strokes. Eugenie C. Scott told the New York Times that Morris was the most important creationist of the 20th century, much more so than William Jennings Bryan. As director of the National Center for Science Education, Scott dismissed Morris books as having no scientific merit, but she recalled his cordial, gentlemanly manner and said: I feel he was absolutely sincere about his convictions that the Bible was literally true and that science would support it and creation science was good science.\n\"Morris grew up in Texas in the 1920s and 1930s. He graduated from Rice University with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1939. He married Mary Louise on January 24, 1940, and they later had six children. After his graduation in 1939, and through 1942, he was a hydraulic engineer working with the International Boundary and Water Commission. He returned to Rice, teaching civil engineering from 1942 until 1946. In 1946 he wrote a short book entitled That You Might Believe (1946). From 1946 through 1951, he studied at the University of Minnesota, where he was awarded a master's degree in hydraulics (1948) and a Ph.D. in hydraulic engineering (1950). In 1951 he became a professor and chair of civil engineering at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\" Wikipedia After fifteen years in faculty positions at Rice U., U. of Minnesota, U. of Southern Louisiana, and Southern Illinois U., Morris became head of the civil engineering department at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. During his thirteen years there, the school program grew to become one of the nation's largest. His 1963 textbook on applied hydraulics is still in use.\nWhen his book The Genesis Flood (co-authored with theologian John Whitcomb) became popular, a new administrator decided Morris was too controversial. In the words of the Los Angeles Times, When he was asked to drop his creationist writings from his resume, Morris knew it was time to move on He founded the Institute for Creation Research and co-founded what is now San Diego Christian C. His biographical listings appear in Who's Who in Science, Antiquity to Present; Who's Who in America; American Men of Science; Who in Engineering; Who's Who in Science and Engineering; Who's Who in the World and Contemporary Authors.\nMorris was an ASA member and Fellow during its early years. His passing is an opportunity for those of us in ASA to demonstrate our appreciation for differing perspectives and interpretations. In the spirit of Robert Fischer's book, God Did It, But How, we may differ in the methods and the timeframe in which the Creator did it, but we show solidarity with anyone who acknowledges, It is he who has made us, and not we ourselves.

He then directed research for Maple Leaf Mills, Ltd. until 1971, when he became professor and chairman of the dept. of animal and poultry science at the U. of Guelph until his retirement in 1992. His research area was the nutrition of animals. Doug had a foundational role in the CSCA and was also recent (1999) CSCA Executive Director. Doug's obituary noted that \"His faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour was the central theme and primary philosophy of his life and determined his decisions and actions.\"\nDoug addressed the Guelph graduating class two months before he died, wishing them success as he defined it: \"Over 2,000 years ago, a Hebrew writer penned what I believe to be a true description of success. He wrote: 'And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.'

He was an active participant on the ASA listserv. Ted Davis noted “A former YEC who published many articles in creationist journals, Glenn became an OEC after very thorough research into some of the scientific problems with the YEC view of a global flood.

He lost his battle to aggressive lymphoma but finished his final race by entering Heaven to run the streets of gold.\nBorn on June 10, 1940, in North Plainfield, New Jersey, John was the son of the late John Clingman Munday and Anna Fegley Munday. He grew up in Cranford, New Jersey and participated in cross-country and track, Boy Scouts, and music activities. He was a trained classical pianist and an Eagle Scout. John was valedictorian in high school and graduated from Cornell University (Sigma Alpha Epsilon) with a B.A. in Physics. He earned his Ph.D. in Biophysics from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.\nEstablishing a distinguished career as both an instructor and a published research scientist, John taught science and environmental policy—among other subjects—at both graduate and undergraduate levels over a span of nearly 50 years. He held teaching positions at the University of Toronto and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science at William & Mary before becoming one of the founding faculty members of Regent University’s Robertson School of Government (originally the School of Public Policy) in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\nThroughout his career, he served in various academic roles, including adjunct professor, interim dean, and department chair. His final full-time appointment was as Professor of Natural Sciences in the College of Arts and Sciences at Regent University. In May 2016, Dr. Munday was honored with the title of Professor Emeritus by Regent University.\nHundreds of students have attested to the profound and lasting impact of his teaching, mentorship, and guidance throughout their education. He was a deeply respected and beloved professor, dedicated to sharing his love for science and its integration with matters of Christian faith. John joined the ASA in 1984 shortly after joining Regent University in Virginia. He learned about ASA from the dean. He presented a talk at three consecutive ASA annual meetings from 2009 to 2011. A fourth paper was accepted for 2017 but illness prevented him from presenting it. He was a member of the DC chapter of the ASA.\nIn addition to his respected status in academia, John was known for his love and devotion to his wife and family. Judi met John in Massachusetts in 1964, and a lifelong journey of their covenant marriage and deep love of family spanned the decades. Together, they had 3 children, whom they raised in New Mexico, Canada, and Virginia. The family enjoyed numerous trips to the Midwest, countless journeys to the ocean and mountains, and opportunities to prioritize visits with extended family. Family memories included hiking the Grand Canyon, camping in Rocky Mountain National Park, and holiday visits to John and Judi’s home state of New Jersey.\nJohn played piano and stringed instruments in a wide variety of settings—from pizza parlors and mountain chalets to churches and ragtime festivals. The family’s dearest memories are the worship songs, love songs, folk music and ragtime pieces he played on his grand piano. He led worship in local prayer meetings and home groups and encouraged the music education of his children. Having composed 14 ragtime pieces over the span of 50 years, it was his lifelong, crowning achievement to receive the published copy of this ragtime portfolio just four days before he entered glory.\nAs a lifelong local runner, John completed 13 marathons, 26 half marathons—including New York and Boston—and numerous sprint triathlons. He was deeply grateful for his Tidewater Striders community, with whom he logged countless miles on the road. Lasting friendships were forged along the running paths, and encouragement to race to the finish was always mutual. His commitment to health and nutrition enabled him to live an active, vibrant life—culminating in his final half marathon in March 2024 at the remarkable age of 83.\nWhat words could encompass the life of this most beloved man, but to describe him as the most compassionate, gentle, humble and dedicated husband, father, and servant to his Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, his family, and his career. John lived selflessly, becoming the hands and feet of Christ to those in need. He cherished nature and all of God’s creation, and he reflected God’s love to everyone who knew him.\nLeft to cherish his memory and carry on his legacy are his faithful and dedicated wife of 60 years, Judith B. Munday, his three children, ten grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.\ntopDonald William Munro, 81, of Secane, Pennsylvania, passed away on September 3, 2019.

Jim Neidhardt (1934-1993) Physics\nJim, an active ASA member, died unexpectedly at age 59 of a sudden heart attack on July 15 1993, in bed. His recently published book, coauthored by James E. Loder, was The Knight's Move: The Relational Logic of the Spirit in Theology and Science, Helmers & Howard, 1992. He was an influential physics professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ for 31 years and an active member in the local NY ASA section.\nJim befriended numerous scientists and theologians from various countries at the Center for Theological Inquiry in Princeton and helped many seminarians and graduate students at several universities. Jim was author of numerous JASA papers and a promoter of Michael Polanyi's ideas. Many of us will remember his frequent use of graphic illustrations to explain various relationships.\nTribute was paid Jim by his co-author of The Knight's Move, Dr. James Loder, in a memorial service on 20 Jul 93. Loder emphasized in his eulogy that, as a whole person, Jim did not detach his intellect from his heart\" and loved to place himself in the biblical tradition \"so the labor of his mind was generated in and from his heart.\" His remarkable energy \"was matched by genuine humility and a delightful sense of humor. His humor seemed usually to embody the comment from Niels Bohr that he loved to repeat Bohr's comment to a young physicist who complained that there was too much humor at the Bohr Institute. \"People should be more serious,\" the young physicist exclaimed. To which Bohr replied, \"Some things are so serious that they must be taken with a sense of humor.\" I think this was the source of Jim's humor. He took serious things seriously and that was the source of much of his humor about lesser things. Jim also \"seemed to have more sorrow or compassion rather than anger at those physicists, theologians, scientists who apparently could not see or comprehend the grace of God\" but also, \"nothing gave him more joy than the triumph of a sound Biblically-based theological argument in the face of a reductionist and secularized concept of humanity, nature, cosmology.\"\nBelieving, as his mentors Tom Torrance and Harold Nebelsick, in the contingency in all things upon the grace of God, his \"service was rendered most of the time in an atmosphere of scientific hostility, to the deepest conviction of his- heart, that science and theology belonged together.\" In closing, Loder alluded to the good that could continue from Jim's effort, though he is no longer among us. And indeed, even now in the ASA, such fruit is being manifested. Robert T. Voss was introduced to the ASA by Jim and has recently relocated from the New York-New Jersey ASA local section (of which Jim Neidhardt was a member) to Pittsburgh, where a new local section is in formation.

Nida's influence can be found in most Christian homes-more specifically, in their Bibles. Nida, one of the leading advocates for dynamic equivalence translation, died August 25, 2011 at a hospital in Brussels, Belgium. He was 96.\nDynamic equivalence translation (a phrase which Nida coined) is a \"meaning-based\" approach to biblical translation; it focuses on translating \"thought-for-thought\" rather than \"word-for-word.\" In a 2002 interview with Christianity Today, Nida said that this shift in translation was his most important contribution: \"To help people be willing to say what the text means, not what the words are, but what the text means.\" Nida's career in translation began in 1936, when he graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles with a B.A. in Greek and a minor in Latin.\nThe summer after he graduated, Nida attended the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), a faith-based nonprofit that serves language communities by using research, training, and development to \"build capacity for sustainable language development.\" After his introduction to SIL, Nida returned every summer from 1937 to 1953 to teach there. Nida continued his studies at the University of Southern California, where he earned a master's degree in New Testament Greek. He completed a doctorate in linguistics at the University of Michigan in 1943. That same year, he was hired by the American Bible Society as associate secretary of versions. He became the executive secretary for translations in 1946, a position that he held until his retirement in 1980. He was present at the founding conference of the United Bible Societies in 1946, and in 1949 he founded The Bible Translator, a journal featuring articles about the theory and practice of Bible translation.\nBy the late 1960s, Nida had published two books, Toward a Science of Translating (Brill, 1964), and The Theory and Practice of Translation (Brill, 1969, with C.R. Taber), advancing his new dynamic equivalence theory. He had also published a first edition of the Greek New Testament, which became a basis for other translators in their work. Nida spent much of his career traveling around the globe. By 1952, he had traveled to more than 30 countries and encountered more than 80 languages. In his travels, he met and trained teams to help them in their translation work. In 1978, he was praised by the Christian Herald as a man who \"has done more than any one person to provide people with Scripture they can read in their own language.\" The popularity and positive reception of The Good News Bible (also called the Today's English Version) lent credence to Nida's work, as it was translated using dynamic equivalence theory. Other versions, such as the New Living Translation and Contemporary English Version, are also heavily influenced by Nida's approach.\nIn his work, Nida emphasized the importance of cultural context - both the cultural context of Bible and the cultural context of the language into which the Bible is being translated. One example he liked to use was the parable of the sheep and the goats in Matthew 25, where the sheep represent those who have done the Lord's will, and the goats are those who haven't. \"Look out, because in most of Africa, sheep are regarded as very bad animals!\" he said in his 2002 interview. \"The translator, of course, cannot change all the sheep into goats and the goats into sheep. But you've got to have footnotes to explain the cultural difference. Otherwise, you're going to give an entirely wrong impression.\" However, Nida also emphasized something over the need for multiple, relatable translations: a desire to understand and spread the meaning of the Bible. \"What is really needed is for people to take the message seriously and share it with other people, focused primarily on what this message has meant to me,\" he said. \"So many Christians love to argue about the Bible rather than take it seriously as a message that is important for their own lives.

Northrup ( ) Chemistry\nASA has been notified of the August 24 death of Harold J. Northrup of Pawcatuck, Rhode Island, at age 82. Harold graduated in chemistry from what is now the U. of Rhode Island and was employed in the dyeing and electrical industries before his retirement. He was active in \"people-to-people\" peace efforts between the U.S. and U.S.S.R., which he described in papers at our 1987 and 1988 Annual Meetings. It's hard to think of chemist Harold Northrup of Pawcatuck, Connecticut, as an \"old-timer\" even though he's an octogenarian. After all, immediately after the Colorado Springs meeting he went to China on the ASA tour.\nHis paper on \"Pathways to Good Will between Hostile Countries\" was based on his own experience traveling to the Soviet Union with a group exploring \"citizen diplomacy.\" He showed slides of his trip and handed out a bibliography on peace and peacemaking efforts. Harold urged ASA members not to overlook \"the influence for good of a single individual.\"How did Harold Northrup get interested in \"waging peace\"? For many years he did goal-oriented research in the storage-battery industry. Even after retirement he has been called back from time to time to help solve problems. It occurred to Harold that the Lord had given him a gift for solving problems, and he couldn't think of a more important problem than world peace. So he thought he'd take a crack at it. He knows its a tough problem but that's the kind he likes best. Besides, he says, all the easy problems have already been solved. He went on the ASA tour to China in 1987. Harold was active in the Central Baptist Church of Pawcatuck hosting a ASA Talk there in late 1990.

Nyborg(1917–2011) biophysics.\nBorn May 15, 1917, in rural Ruthven, Iowa, he was the last of six children born to Isaac Nyborg and Leva Larson. He died on September 24, 2011, at the age of 94. As a child, He lived on a farm before rural electrification was widely available and was taught in a one-room schoolhouse\nHe earned B. S. in Physics and Mathematics at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, which was founded by Norwegian immigrants. He earned an M.S. in 1944 and a Ph.D. in 1947 in physics from the Pennsylvania State University. His research there had an application of ultrasonic signaling for the U.S. Army Signal Corps.\nIn 1945 he married Beth, his wife of 44 years, until her death in 1989. His physics dissertation was titled “High Frequency Whistles: Edge Tones and Resonance,” with adviser Harold K. Schilling. He helped Wes form his own style of teaching and research, including striking a balance between the aims of science and religion. \"Wes was also a deeply religious man who loved God and tried to serve Him. He was active in his church (Community Lutheran) and in his community, and gave freely and generously to many charities. He loved to sing, and was in a barber shop quartet as a young man and in church choirs for many years thereafter.\" He had been an ASA member since 1989.\nHe was an assistant and associate professor at Brown University from 1950 to 1960, and since 1960 was a professor and on retirement, an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Vermont.\nWes’ career was devoted to biophysical acoustics, first at low frequencies and since the early 1950s primarily at ultrasonic frequencies of biomedical interest. He made significant contributions in many areas of ultrasound biophysics. His early work established a basis for much of our current knowledge of nonthermal mechanisms by which ultrasound interacts with biological materials—particularly important is the basic information that he had provided on the effects associated with acoustically driven bubble activity. He developed the theoretical basis of acoustic streaming, and he extended his work to investigating all sorts of ultrasonically induced movements and other nonthermal effects of ultrasound\nAs an ultrasound beam traverses tissue, it causes the local temperature\nto rise. The underlying theory was worked on by Wes, and he derived\na number of important relationships that we use today in determining the\nanticipated temperature elevation that can result from medical\napplications of ultrasound.\nIn addition to being elected into membership of the\nNational Academy of Engineering, he has been honored with the\ntitle\nfellow by the Acoustical Society of America, the American Institute of\nUltrasound in Medicine (AIUM), and the American Association for the\nAdvancement of Sciences. He has served on the editorial boards of the Journal\nof Biological Physics, Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology, Ultrasonics,\nand Clinics in Diagnostic Ultrasound. He has written many chapters in\nscientific books and published many papers in scholarly journals.\nFor 22 years, Wes was the chair of National Council on Radiation\nProtection and Measurements Scientific Committee No. 66, devoted to\nestablishing guidelines for the safe use of ultrasound in medicine.\nThree volumes were published: (1)Biological Effects of Ultrasound:\nMechanisms and Clinical Implications, in 1983; (2) Exposure\nCriteria for Medical Diagnostic Ultrasound: I.\nCriteria Based on Thermal Mechanisms,\nin 1992; and (3) Exposure Criteria for Medical Diagnostic Ultrasound:\nII. Criteria Based on All Known Mechanisms, in 2002. These volumes are\nconsidered the most authoritative documents in this field. It should be\nemphasized that Wes was not only the leader of this effort but also the\nmajor contributor of concepts and scientific input.

When all the tests were in, the doctor characterized the cancer as 'angry'.\" Too far gone for hospital care, Ed's last four days were spent in a hospital bed in the living room of the Olson home in Spokane, WA.\nEd was born 74 years ago in Gary, Indiana, grew up in Pittsburgh, PA, majored in chemical engineering at the U. of Pitt., and then worked for DuPont. In 1950, through the influence of two DuPont colleagues, he became a Christian. He left engineering in 1953 to attend seminary and teach chemistry and physics at Northwestern C. in Minneapolis, MN. He married Marlene, a student there, in 1954. They moved to New York in 1954, where Ed entered the doctoral program at Columbia U., in geochemistry, with a specialization in radiocarbon dating. He received his doctorate in 1963. Ed joined the Whitworth C. faculty in 1960, and established the Dept. of Geology.\nEd was a member of Trinity Baptist Church for nearly forty years.\nStephen C. Meyer of Whitworth C. included in his tribute to Ed: \"Somehow he saw potential in me that others didn't and that interest transformed me. He told me he liked reading my tests because my essays were clearly written. Now I write about science as a central part of my profession. During a term that Ed was faculty president, he asked me to teach his structural geology lab. Now I teach as a professor at Whitworth C. The summer after my sophomore year, Ed wrote me a letter encouraging me as a Christian and as a budding scientist. I remember reading the letter sitting on a tractor in the middle of a Montana alfalfa field, stunned that a professor would take the time in the middle of his summer to write me. Ed was never too full of himself to see potential in others. That's why I say he was humble. He was other directed. And his interest in others inspired them. And it changed lives.\"\nAn ASA Fellow, Ed was a ASA Council member (1984- 1988) and was interested in the science and politics of the environment.

He lived independently until three months prior to his passing at age 80 from complications of acute kidney failure and sepsis.\nKen was born on December 5, 1942, and grew up in Longmont, Colorado, where he played on the high school tennis team and played trombone in band and orchestra. The first in his family to attend college, Ken attended Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California, and received his BA in Chemistry in 1964. During his college years, he enjoyed competing on the tennis team, tutoring in chemistry, working on the grounds crew, and playing the trombone in the college pep band. Ken earned an MS in both Biochemistry and Microbiology from Oregon State University in 1967. He then moved across the country to launch his career as a biochemist at Hoffman LaRoche (Nutley, NJ) in nucleic acid enzymology, from 1967 to 1979.\nHis career path took him to Genentech (South San Francisco, CA) from 1979 to 1997, as a scientist with a focus on recombinant DNA technology. He was one of the original 50 employees who had a vision to change the way that drugs were produced. One of his longtime colleagues stated, “You are a real icon in the biotechnology business” and “you turned a page of history.” He developed novel methods of protein purification and helped develop manufacturing processes for recombinant protein drugs, including Protropin (human growth hormone), Nutropin, Interleukin 12, and Somavert (PEG-Growth Hormone Antagonist).\nAfter Genentech, from 1999 to 2008 he served as Director of Research and Development at Allergan Pharmaceuticals in Fremont, CA. He led the development program for human collagen using fibroblasts from cell culture to the FDA-approved drugs CosmoDerm and CosmoPlast. In 2008, he began consulting services for multiple biotech companies in product development, process, and regulatory support. In his early retirement, he continued to share his expertise, mentoring the next generation of scientists.\nKen joined the ASA in January of 1965 while he was at Oregon State University. During his career at Hoffman LaRoche in New Jersey, he was very active in the ASA Metropolitan New York City chapter. He gave a plenary talk on “Development of Therapeutic Proteins by Recombinant DNA Technology” at the ASA Gene Splicing Conference at Eastern College in 1987. He served on the ASA Executive Council and was the founding donor of the ASA Endowment Fund. He and Eunice attended many ASA annual meetings, and he has been a dedicated advocate for and contributor to ASA.\nHis commitment to God and his ministry was widespread and lifelong. Over the years, as a member of his home church, he served as a church deacon, served in youth ministries, taught men’s Bible study, and, most recently, was involved in Seniors’ ministry at Quail Lakes Baptist Church. He supported many missionary families and organizations globally. He took his role seriously and lived a lifetime of stewardship. He was always willing to share a meal and open his home for missionaries as they traveled, with his wife, Eunice, graciously hosting. He coordinated singers and concert opportunities at his church home. His was a quiet and kind presence that spoke to others of God’s grace and love for his neighbors.\nHe was consistent in providing for his family and was well known for being the father of five girls. He allowed his silly side to come out, with his mischievous grin, dry humor, and Dad jokes. Ken loved to travel, and instilled this in his family as they would navigate across the country, from coast to coast. He visited all 50 states and traveled overseas for conferences and for tours, such as The Holy Lands and the Wesley Heritage and Hymns Tour in England. Later in life, he and Eunice enjoyed taking cruises, especially when they were able to hear some of their favorite gospel groups sing and to join up with fellow church friends.\nHe was preceded in death by his wife of 58 years, Eunice (Boldt) Olson. Ken was clear in mind as he faced his final weeks and was at peace knowing that he had done what he wanted to accomplish in life. He was confident in his faith and continued to read his Bible daily and minister to others. “Well done, good and faithful Servant.”\ntop\nDied on July 22, 1996 at age 86 of an acute heart attack.

Hendrik received his degrees in electrical engineering at Oregon State U. where he and F. Alton Everest were fellow students.\nAlton taught at OSU but when he was called to work in the Navy Electronics Laboratory in San Diego at the outset of WWII, Hendrik took over his teaching. Alton subsequently recruited Hendrik to work with him at the Lab from 1944-46. Hendrik was an EE prof. at Purdue U. from 1946-57, then returned to OSU until his retirement in 1975.\nHe married Ruth Denney in 1950 and had three sons and a daughter. Hendrik and Ruth were involved in a ministry to inmates at the Oregon State Prison. Hendrik attended First Baptist Church of Corvallis, where former ASA president and biologist David L. Willis taught Bible class. One of David's students at First Baptist was also an EE student at OSU, the Editor, who would record his articulate and inspiring lectures. I took no courses from Hendrik, however, but recall him to often be in the motor lab, the EE dept's \"fishbowl.\" I readily concur with Dave when he wrote: \"Hendrik was a most enthusiastic person. ... He was always cheerful and hopeful. He is remembered locally as \"the Flying Dutchman,\" because to the end of his life he could be seen daily on the city streets furiously pedaling his bicycle here and there.\" David also added, \"He was a dear Christian friend and a strong supporter of ASA.

With this\neducational background, she became equipped to teach at various institutions\nstarting as an instructor at UCLA, then as an assistant professor at the\nUniversity of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and finally moving to the University\nof Calgary where she was granted the associate and later full professor status.\nShe served this institution for 26 years until her retirement. During some\nsummer sessions, she had the opportunity to teach at the University of\nLethbridge in Alberta, University of Regina, in Saskatchewan, and West Virginia\nUniversity in Morgantown, WV. Apart from this wide teaching experience, she was\nalso a visiting professor at the University of the Philippines, a visiting\ncolleague at the University of Hawaii, and an Honorary Research Fellow at the\nUniversity of Birmingham in England.\nShe joined the ASA as early as 1968\nand was appointed a consulting editor for JASA in 1977. She\nattended several Annual meetings in the 70s and 80s.\nBecause of her honest desire in improving the teaching of Philosophy of Education and the development of a better understanding of what the Department of Foundations of Education under the Faculty of Education is through her dedicated teaching and extensive writing, she received various kinds of honors, certificates of recognition, and awards. She was not only an author and co-author of books, but also a contributor to a number of books. Her involvement in both national and international journals on philosophy of education, values, and religion ranged from being editor, co-editor, book review editor, advisor, and contributor resulted in her being known and admired by local, national and international colleagues. Her other areas of interest in addition to philosophy of education in general were analytic philosophy of education, in particular, philosophical basis of moral education, existential philosophy, Pragmatism, Ethics, and later on she included the areas of religion, Christian mind, religious pluralism, interreligious dialogue, morality and values. Her main concern in teaching was to teach her students to think clearly and understand what university education is about. In addition to her distinguished academic career, Evelina was devoted to her family and friends, known for her generosity and love of art, the performing arts, classical music and collections of old books.\nHer clear thinking also applied rigorously to her Christian beliefs as shown in leading Bible Studies both in a number of churches she attended and in individual homes where sharing or caring groups met weekly. The members of every group showed their appreciation and thanks for the marvelous lessons learned from her, in terms of a verse by verse study and clarification, in each book being studied, and an increasing love for reading the Word of God. And because she believed in God distributing gifts to His people, we can say that she used her gifts from God to the fullest extent that she could.\nThe family received friends at the Reformation Orthodox Presbyterian Church, 450 Arch Street, Morgantown, WV on Saturday, August 16th from 9:30 AM until the time of the funeral service at 11 AM with Rev.

Osepchuk, passed away on Thanksgiving afternoon, November 28, 2024, at the age of 97. He was born on February 11, 1927, in Peabody, MA, to Moses and Mary Osepchuk, who had immigrated from Russia’s Ukraine region. He spent his childhood in Peabody but spent most of his life (nearly 60 years) in Concord, MA. John is predeceased by his wife Shirley Greenwood Osepchuk in 2011.\nJohn’s parents’ emigration from Volinski province in northwestern Ukraine was complicated by both WWI and the Russian Revolution, but Moses, a tailor, and his wife Mary managed to settle and thrive in a diverse neighborhood of Peabody where John and his siblings grew up as staunch members of the Baptist Church (later called the Calvary Baptist Church). During his formative years, John and his older brother Philip also worked in a leather factory before or after school. In 1944 while still in high school, John enlisted in the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program and was trained as a high-speed radio operator. After being discharged from the army in early 1946, he received Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in engineering from Harvard University in 1949, 1950, and 1957, respectively. He joined Raytheon Company in 1950, met Shirley Greenwood Small in the fall of 1955 and married her in June 1956. The couple then lived 1.5 years in Paris, France, where John helped facilitate post-war industrial reconstruction efforts by working at the CSD Company on behalf of Raytheon. They returned to the United States in late 1957 and had three children over the next decade.\nJohn had an outstanding career focused primarily on microwave tubes (magnetrons) and related heating applications (such as ovens) and bioeffects (safety factors). His accomplished career began in 1950, when he was hired by Raytheon as a power tube division development engineer. He was later promoted to become a liaison engineer in the company’s microwave and power tube division and a principal research engineer and consultant scientist in the research division. Writing extensively as a result of his research, John disseminated much of his findings in over 80 scholarly journal articles, and edited a book published in 1983 entitled \"Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Radiation\". He also acquired approximately 50 patents, including many magnetron-related patents that have had a considerable impact on the the entire microwave oven industry. From the 1970s, he was a prominent figure in countering rising concerns about potential health/safety problems related to diverse applications of electromagnetic energy.\nJohn retired from Raytheon in 1995, at which time he established Full Spectrum Consulting to continue providing services related to magnetrons and microwave safety issues. Supported by several pertinent organizations, John was an elected fellow and past president of the International Microwave Power Institute. He was also an elected fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE,) where he served on several committees and chaired the standards coordinator committee. He was a member of the Microwave Society of the IEEE, an advisor to the board of directors of the Electromagnetic Energy Police Alliance, and a member of the American Science Affiliation (ASA) and the Bioelectromagnetics Society.\nJohn joined the ASA in 1952 while working at Raytheon, having learned of the ASA from various church members. John published 4 letters in PSCF, all warning against bad science that alleges harm in technologies such as microwave radiation, low frequency electromagnetic radiation, genetically modified organisms, and global warming. He was instrumental in founding the ASA Affiliate of Christians in Engineering, Science, and Technology, of which he served as vice-president and later as president. He was elected an ASA Fellow and remained an ASA member for a record 72 years.\nA dedicated community advocate, John was long a member of the Republican town committee in Concord since 1974. He also served as a clerk and trustee at Park Street Church in Boston. In his leisure time, he was an avid tennis player, an aficionado of cats, and until a very advanced age he enjoyed doing diverse yard and home maintenance work. Travel played a big part in his life, and he visited many places such as France, and the rest of Europe, Latin America and especially Japan, where his son Jonathan has been employed since the 1980's as a translator. John was a man of strong faith in Christianity who strived to apply his strict conceptions of Christian morality with respect to science and electromagnetic radiation-related social issues.\ntopDaniel Harcourt Osmond\n(1934 - 2015) Physiology, Medicine\nIt is with\ngreat sadness that I share with you news of the sudden passing of Dan\nOsmond last Saturday.

Page (1903-1992) Physics\nOf Minneapolis, he died of heart failure on 15 May 1992 at the age of 88. A physicist and former research director of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), he had been decorated by four U.S. presidents. In 1946 President Harry Truman awarded him the Certificate of Merit and in 1960 President Dwight Eisenhower presented him with the Presidential Award for Distinguished Civilian Service. Born in St. Paul, the son of a Methodist minister, Bob Page entered Hamline University to study religion but in his senior year switched to physics.\nAfter graduating in 1927 he joined the staff of NRL, which had been established only four years earlier. With colleagues there he invented the technology to make pulsed radar effective; also the planned position indicator (die now common PPI scope, with radial beam sweeping the circular face of a cathode ray tube to locate radar echoes from planes, ships, or hurricanes) and Project Madre, the first radar capable of \"seeing\" over a horizon. His contributions, pooled with those of British scientists in 1940, were crucial to winning WWII. Later, Project Madre improved surveillance of long-range missile launches during the cold war with the Soviet Union. Bob Page earned an M.S. degree from George Washington U. while working at NRL, where he was research director from 1957 to his retirement in 1966. He also received an honorary doctorate from Hamline.\nHe was a long-time member and Fellow of ASA. During his tenure at NRL he was active in ASA's Washington-Baltimore local section, and in the sixties participated in a number of ASA Annual Meetings. Robert M. Page, Director of Research at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington (and the first man to send a message by reflecting it off the moon, he casually informed us during a talk), presented a fascinating picture of what science has learned about extra-terrestrial phenomena through different types of research. He taught Bible classes and frequently lectured on the relationship of science and Scripture. According to his son, Rev. John Robert Page of Medford, Oregon, he had recently been working on a full-length study on that subject. ASA old-timers will remember Bob's striking appearance: a tall, thin, white-haired man with a distinctive goatee. Others (especially anyone who worked on early radar gear) might know his 1962 Doubleday Anchor paperback,\nThe Origin of Radar.\nIn addition to his son, Bob is survived by a niece in Minnesota, a brother in Texas, and one grandson. Page closed nearly forty years of service as he retired as Director of Research of the Naval Research Laboratory at the end of 1966. At NRL, Dr. Page was instrumental in maintaining the laboratory as one of the nation's outstanding physical science research institutions. As director of research he planned long-range programs and provided leadership to a staff of 1500 scientists, engineers and technicians. Prior to his latest post, Dr. Page served five years as Associate Director of Research in electronics and seven years as Superintendent of a Radio Division.

Myers, FL. He was born on October 24, 1920 in Rochester, NY, to Rev. Wesley Parmerter and Mable (Winegard) Parmerter. He earned a BS degree in chemistry from Greenville (IL) College, and MS and PhD degrees in chemistry from the University of Illinois in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. Later he obtained a JD from the John Marshall Law School in Chicago and had a successful career as a patent attorney.\nStanley married Ellen Barton, his college sweetheart, in 1943. They were married for 76 years until her death, preceding him by only 9 months. After graduation, he performed research at the William S. Merrell Company and then worked for the Eastman Kodak Company. In 1952 the Parmerter family moved to Wheaton, IL, where they lived for over forty years. Stanley taught chemistry at Wheaton College for eleven years before he returned to industrial employment with CPC International in Argo, IL. There he was employed in research, administration, and finally as a patent attorney. For many years the Parmerters were active members of the Wheaton Bible Church where they both taught Sunday School classes and where he served as an Elder for several terms.\nIn January of 1952, Stanley joined the American Scientific Affiliation. It is not clear how he learned about the ASA, presumably while he was working at Kodak. Perhaps it was through the ASA that he met key ASA leaders such as Russell Mixter, and perhaps those connections led him to join the chemistry department at Wheaton College in the fall of 1952. He would later serve as chair of the science division at Wheaton. During his tenure there, he held discussions on science and faith in his home which directly influenced a Wheaton grad student in biblical theology by the name of Robert Fay. Bob went on to follow in Stanley’s footsteps by earning a PhD in chemistry and completing a great teaching career at Cornell.\nStanley was also awarded a research grant by the Alumni Association of Wheaton College. In 1961 Stanley moderated a panel called “Origins and Christian Thought” as part of the larger Wheaton symposium by that name organized by Russell Mixter who had just edited the seminal book Evolution and Christian Thought Today. This influential symposium resulted in considerable controversy in the larger Christian community beyond the campus. The reaction led to concerns that rose to the level of the college’s trustees and ultimately resulted in a modification of the Wheaton Statement of Faith. A footnote was added stating that Adam and Eve were created directly and not from previously existing forms of life. This new condition of employment prompted several faculty to leave, including Stanley Parmerter, in 1963. It should be noted that the specification “not from previously existing forms of life” was removed in 1992. (ASA Newsletter July 1960 and History of the Chemistry Department—private communication)\nStanley published extensively in his field of organic chemistry. He was the author and agent for many patents. Though he did not publish in PSCF, he was an effective servant of Christ in his frequent interactions with students and colleagues. He was a 68-year member and supporter of the ASA, faithfully submitting his dues and adding a donation every year, even at the age of 99. One of his friends at Shell Point, where he spent his final years, remarked “Stan Parmerter was a wonderful man, a scientist with a warm heart for God.”\ntop\nMark S.

Phillips (1950-2000) Theology\nAssociate Professor of Theology at Wheaton C. at 50 years of age, went to be with the Lord on Sept. 27, 2000 after suffering a long bout with cancer. Timothy graduated from Wheaton C., completed the M.T.S. from Gordon Conwell Seminary, and the Ph.D. in Theology from Vanderbilt U.\nIn 1986, he returned to Wheaton C. to teach classes in historical and systematic theology where he wrestled with questions about life and death with students. The struggle was always centered in God's self-disclosure in Jesus Christ and Scripture and Tim never let anyone get away with glib answers. One of Tim's legacies to his students is his insistence that they understand and respond to how others outside the evangelical community deal with theological issues. He was a valuable participant in the \"Evangelical and Catholics Together\" meetings and mentored his love for Christ's people to the larger Church.\nA co-author/editor of four books with friend, Dennis Okholm, Tim pressed on to engage thinking about theology and culture. In this endeavor and passion, he helped initiate the annual Theology Conference at Wheaton. He entitled the most recent and very successful conference, \"The Relationship of Theology and Science.\" Tim valued teaching, scholarship, and service to others in Christ's name. His influence is felt in churches and educational institutions around the world. His international grad. students in Wheaton and his trips to Nigeria and Kenya brought many closer to their Lord. According to Dennis Okholm, one of Tim's best friends, Tim considered himself as a modest scholar with a lifelong agenda, who was in love with the God he studied.

Post (1896-1992) Chemistry\nOf Getzville, New York, died on 19 Feb 1992 at the age of 95. He was an emeritus professor of organic chemistry from the State University of New York at Buffalo. He received his B.S. and M.S. from Syracuse and his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins (1927). His research on organometallics and especially on organosilicons was published in some 85 technical papers and two books. Howard W. Post; Silicones and Other Organic Silicon Compounds; (Reinhold Publishing Corp., N. Y.; 1949).\nFrom a Buffalo News article: \" Always interested in international good will, Howard has become an \"ambassador extraordinaire\", partly by maintaining contact with fellow scientists in other countries. One of his \"extra mile\" gestures of friendship was recently reported in a Buffalo newspaper.\nBack in 1958-59, Dr. Isao Shiihara, a chemist at the Industrial (National) Research Center at Ikeda City (near Osaka), Japan, spent a postdoctoral year with Howard Post on a Fulbright grant. Over the years, as Shiihara rose to become director of his institute, Post continued to correspond with him and the two even collaborated at a distance on research projects. Besides publishing four joint papers from that work, Post wrote a chapter for a book edited by Shiihara and helped edit the English of a number of institute manuscripts written in English. Within the past year Post's friend resigned to take a VIP position with a Japanese chemical manufacturing company in Tokyo.\nHoward Post is a history buff. Digging through old archives saved by his father, from whom Howard got his interest in history, he found a Syracuse newspaper dated May 29, 1905. It carried an account, with drawings, of the battle of Tsu-Shime on that date, in which Admiral Togo destroyed almost all of what was left of the navy of Imperial Russia. The Czar had sent his Baltic squadron around western Europe, the Cape of Good Hope, and through the Indian Ocean in hopes of turning the tide in the Russo-Japanese War.\nThinking that his Japanese friend might be interested in the newspaper, Post sent it to him and received \"a veritable outburst of thanks\", also learing that Shiihara was a captain in the Japanese Naval Reserve, having served with the scientific sector in WWII. Shiihara took the old newspaper to the official Museum of the Imperial Japanese Navy at the naval base of Maizuru, where it was mounted permanently along with a Japanese translation of the account. Howard Post's own album now contains several photographs of the museum exhibit he contributed, the naval base and its commandant, Admiral Kato, and of course, his friend Isao Shiihara.\nHoward has worked with the U.S. government in various ways to build better relations with other countries. Of his 20-year friendship with a now-prominent Japanese scientist he says, \"I think it's an excellent example of the ties we could set up if we were willing to try hard enough, both personally and nationally, to develop international good will.\" For years Howard was active in the Williamsville United Methodist Church, where he taught Sunday school to high schoolers.

To his A.B. from Washington he added a B.D. at Eastern Baptist Seminary, and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in philosophy at the U. of Southern California. While studying at USC he taught a course in science and religion at Biola College. He later served on the faculties of Bethel College and Seminary, Baylor University, American Baptist Seminary of the West (Covina), Eastern Baptist Seminary, and American Baptist Seminary of the West (Berkeley), and taught at a number of other schools, including Haigazian College in Beirut, Lebanon.\nFor other details of Bernie's life, and the impact of his writing on others, see the Dec 1979 issue of\nJournal of the ASA, a Festschrift marking the 25th anniversary of publication of The Christian View of Science and Scripture.

He wrote prolifically on topics concerned with biblical hermeneutics, religion and science, Christology, and apologetics. The hermeneutical principles presented in his 1956 book Protestant Biblical Interpretation influenced a wide spectrum of Baptist theologians. During the 1970s he was widely regarded as a leading evangelical theologian as well known as Carl F.H. Henry. His equally celebrated and criticized 1954 book\nThe Christian View of Science and Scripture was the theme of a 1979 issue of the Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation, while a 1990 issue of Baylor University's\nPerspectives in Religious Studies was devoted to Ramm's views on theology.\nRamm's tertiary education included a B.A. (University of Washington), initially studying chemistry then switching to philosophy of science in preparation of ministry, B.D. (Eastern Baptist Seminary), M.A. in 1947 & Ph.D in 1950 (University of Southern California). He also undertook additional studies at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Basel, Switzerland (1957-1958 academic year with Karl Barth), and the Near Eastern School of Theology, Beirut, Lebanon.\nHis academic teaching career began in 1943 when he joined the faculty at the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (now Biola University, La Mirada, California). He became Professor of Philosophy at Bethel College and Seminary, and then Professor of Religion at Baylor University, Texas. Most of his academic teaching was conducted at the American Baptist Seminary of the Wet at Covina, California, where he taught between 1958-74 and again from 1978-86. At that seminary he held the post of Professor of Systematic Theology. Ramm wrote eighteen books, contributed to chapters to other books, and composed over one hundred articles and book reviews in various theological periodicals.\nIn his contributions to Christian apologetics, Ramm began his career in the evidentialist camp. However his later work reflected a shift in viewpoint over to a modified form of\npresuppositional apologetics that had some affinity with the work of Edward John Carnell.\nIn spite of harsh criticisms of Karl Barth from other theologians such as Cornelius Van Til, Gordon Clark, and Carl F. H. Henry, Ramm would explore much of Barth's theological viewpoint, eventually embracing Barth's theology almost wholeheartedly as outlined in Ramm's own book\nAfter Fundamentalism (Harper & Row, 1983) Ramm did not utilize the classical or Thomist approach in arguments for God's existence. He maintained that apart from faith God was unknowable. He likewise emphasized that the noetic effects of sin rendered the theistic proofs useless. For Ramm the proof of God's existence is in Holy Scripture.\nIn some respects Ramm's emphasis on the inner witness of the Spirit reflected the view of John Calvin, but it also reflected the influence of Karl Barth under whom he studied in Switzerland. Near the end of his life Ramm was honored with a book of essays by his colleagues and younger contemporaries.---Wikipedia,\n[Five]Personal Reminiscences [on the influence of The Christian View of Science and Scripture] Everest, Carpenter, Willis, Haynes, Yamauchi From:\nJASA 31 (September 1979).\n.\ntop\nWalter C.

(Jack) Richardson died peacefully in his sleep on December 16, 2025, following an eight-month journey with pancreatic cancer. He was a devoted husband of 35 years to Marion (Ryder) Richardson. Jack was born to Wilfrid and Elda (Wemp) Richardson on a farm in Wallaceburg, Ontario, on September 2, 1939. His affinity for building things and fascination with electronics from an early age led him to Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering in 1963. He later earned an MBA at the University of Toronto. Jack was a life-long student of the Scriptures and kept a rich library of his favorite Christian authors and theologians.\nThe day after he submitted his undergraduate thesis at MIT, Jack began working at Digital Equipment Corporation as an engineer in a “very new field called the computer field.” There, Jack enjoyed a 37-year career with Digital in a variety of roles, including sales, marketing, and education. He also produced conferences for major customers worldwide. At his core, he was a teacher—teaching customers how computers could improve their business, helping sales and marketing employees be more effective, and engaging with customers to see what future needs Digital could meet.\nIn 2000, Jack retired from Digital and began working at Vision New England, a Christian non-profit that supports and encourages churches and individuals across New England. He originally planned to stay for 5 years before settling into retirement, but found the work fulfilling and meaningful. Jack was dedicated to developing leadership skills in pastors and many other members of church leadership. He stayed on in an official capacity for 25 years until December 2024 and remained involved until his death.\nJack deeply valued both family and friendships. He always made time for family vacations near and far, and often included friends on his adventures. He was a good listener, asking thoughtful questions and remembering details years later. Friends often would describe his humility, integrity, dependability, and ability to make anyone feel like they had known each other for years within minutes of meeting. In 2017, he began volunteering at Joni and Friends Family Retreats, serving as a one-on-one with campers impacted by disability. In this role, he built relationships with campers of all ages and actively invested in these friendships throughout the year outside of camp.\nJack was a faithful follower of Jesus. He developed a personal relationship with Christ during his sophomore year of college at MIT, served in a local church wherever he lived, and particularly found meaning in teaching adult Sunday School classes to those new to the Christian faith. For over 20 years, he participated in and often led lessons with a men’s Bible study that met at 7am on Saturday mornings. His interest in both his faith and his engineering expertise led him to join the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) in 1963. He frequently attended ASA annual meetings and local Boston area ASA chapter meetings. He remained a member until his death.\nJack had a lifelong love of the outdoors, which spanned from his childhood years on the banks of the Sydenham River in southwestern Ontario to multi-week long canoe trips in Northern Canada and the US for decades in adulthood. Recent travels included Waterton Lakes and Banff National Parks, the Alaskan Highway, and Prince Edward Island and the Bay of Fundy. Jack continued to pick up new outdoor pursuits late in life with enthusiasm, including learning to downhill ski at the age of 65 and trying rock climbing for the first time in his 80s. From his childhood chickens to woodland creatures he encountered while hiking, and the birds and squirrels he faithfully fed in the yard for over 45 years, Jack cared for all “little animals” in the natural world. Jack also enjoyed classical music, especially Bach, and appreciated it most with others by attending concerts, musicals, operas, and singing in a choir. He had a keen interest in astronomy, and many may remember his delight in sharing the wonders of the night sky with those of all ages.\nFollowing a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in April 2025, Jack took it upon himself to live his life to the fullest, in the same way he had throughout the past 85 years. He approached the terminal nature of his disease with an extraordinary depth of peace, witty pragmatism, and joy at the promise of being united with his Lord and Savior.

A couple years following their marriage, Anne and Richard had their only child, Stephen. When asked how he would describe Richard as a father, Stephen remarked that he was “loving, caring, playful, engaging, present, attentive, and a mentor.” Some of Stephen’s favorite memories with his father surrounded playing pickup basketball with the neighborhood kids, going to Lake Weddington to collect sticks, and having Sunday picnics after church. In his later years, Richard was an equally excellent grandfather, and spent as much time as he could with his granddaughters, playing games, singing songs, sharing his knowledge, and engaging in their lives.\nA worldly man with a passion for God and spreading messages of love and kindness, Richard also served as the pastor at Highland Community Church for 30 years. When he wasn’t preaching, studying, or spending time with family, you could find Richard traveling the world, collecting artifacts and learning about the cultures that existed in Europe and the Middle East.\nWhile at JBU, Richard joined the American Scientific Affiliation in 1966. He became an ASA Fellow and was the most prolific writer of book reviews published in the Journal of the ASA. It was no surprise that in 1987, when the name of the Journal of the ASA was changed to Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, that Richard was named the book review editor for PSCF. He served in that capacity for over 20 years until 2008.\nRichard is survived by his wife (Anne), son (Stephen), daughter-in-law (Lori) and two granddaughters (Ella and Olivia). He will be missed tremendously, and his family finds peace knowing that he finally has the answers to all of life’s lingering questions.\ntopJames P Runyon (~1938-2021) Chemist; Engineer\nJames Philip Runyon, age 73, of Noblesville, Indiana (formerly of Wheaton, Illinois), passed away on November 26th, 2022 surrounded by his family at St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana.\nJames (Jim) was born October 25, 1949 in Alma, Michigan to Lawrence and Leilah (Hartgerink) Runyon.

Gordon Scott (1941-2018) Organic chemist\nTo prepare for a career in chemistry, Dr. Scott earned a Bachelor of Arts (Chemistry) from the University of Pennsylvania in 1963, a second Bachelor of Arts (Natural Science) from Cambridge University in 1965, a Master of Arts from Cambridge University in 1970, and a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois. He has remained at the top of his field through his professional memberships with the American Chemical Society, the Cambridge University Chemical Society, and the American Scientific Affiliation which he joined in 1967.\nRetired since 2009, Dr. Scott dedicated more than 45 years to the field of education. With a focus on the field of science, he concluded his career as an associate professor of chemistry at Winston-Salem State University (NC), a role that he held for five years. Previously, he excelled as an adjunct instructor of pharmacology at National College, adjunct professor of natural sciences for Danville Community College (VA), associate professor of chemistry at Jarvis Christian College (TX), associate professor of chemistry at Union College (KY), associate professor of chemistry at Knoxville College (TN), associate professor at Bryan College (TN), assistant professor of chemistry at Alderson Broaddus University (WV), and lecturer of biochemistry at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He also served as visiting professor at Louisiana College and (interim) assistant professor at Oberlin College (OH). In addition, Dr. Scott served in roles at the secondary level as an instructor of mathematics at Winona Independent School District in Texas, and supervisor of secondary studies at Westminster Academy (PA).\nAlong with his work inside the classroom, Dr. Scott is known for two prominent contributions to chemistry, both with international effect. In applied science, (R&D) with Dupont he developed an efficient process for production of a resin that would successfully bind glistening acrylic pigments for use as automotive finishes. The first application world-wide of this formulation was on 1964 model Cadillacs and Buicks. In pure science with a co-investigator (Richard D. Spencer) at the University of Illinois, he determined the lifetime of the fluorescent excited state of coenzyme NADH, under half-a-billionth of a second. It is now an internationally-accepted constant in biochemistry. Using this constant, the time needed to conduct a rate experiment involving NADH in living systems was reduced from two or more weeks to two to four hours, a significant saving in research time and materials. As a direct consequence of using the constant within a decade of publication six hereditary metabolic diseases were either controlled or cured through research at established research stations in the United States and Europe. Dr. Scott, along with other professional experts in his field, authored \"Synthetic Procedures in Nucleic Acid Chemistry,\" and \"Spectroscopic Model Studies of NAD(H),\" Nicotinamide-Adenine Dinucleotide (Reduced). Today, he continues to study the created order and consults periodically with active professionals.\n*Taken from Marquis Who’s Who, https://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/436241\ntop\nRaymond J.

Smalley, who as a young American linguist, anthropologist and missionary sat with the ancient Hmong peoples in the mountains of Laos, listened to the patterns of their speech and helped them develop their first permanent written language, died on Dec. 16, 1997 in New Haven. He was 74 and lived in Hamden, Conn. Mr. Smalley, a retired professor of linguistics at Bethel College in St. Paul, died at the Hospital of St. Raphael after a heart attack, his wife, Jane, said. It was during the early 1950's, when Laos was a French colony and torn by war with the Communist Pathet Lao, that Mr. Smalley, who was working toward his doctorate at Columbia University, did his work with the reclusive Hmong. The Hmong had developed their own dialect and tradition of oral speech but had no lasting system of written language except for a few signs and symbols sewn into quilts or dresses. Hundreds of thousands of them were driven out of China in the 19th century and trekked south to the mountains of Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.\nNYTimes\n\"William A. Smalley was born April 4, 1923 in Jerusalem, Palestine. His parents were American missionaries for the Christian and Missionary Alliance, working among Arabs in Jerusalem and Transjordan. In 1934, Smalley and his family moved back to the United States. In reflecting upon his upbringing, Smalley writes, My parents were thoroughly, deeply devoted both to Christ and to the Alliance, but they drew their boundaries more widely than many. According to Smalley, My home was intellectually more open than some Alliance homes; my upbringing was somewhat less doctrinaire. (Smalley 1991) Smalley attended Houghton College, where he developed an interest in anthropology, which he saw as relevant to missionary work. After graduating from Houghton in 1945 with a degree in English literature, he attended the Missionary Training Institute (1945-46) and received linguistic training in Bible translation at the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) at the University of Oklahoma (1946, 1947). In 1946 he also enrolled in Columbia University graduate program in anthropology with a concentration in linguistics. According to Smalley, he discovered his intellectual niche studying at SIL, while the anthropological training at Columbia gave linguistics a broader cultural context. \"I became absorbed in the challenge to understand my faith in Christ in light of all I was learning about human culture. (Smalley 1991)\nIn 1950, Smalley was sent to Vietnam by the Christian and Missionary Alliance. There, Smalley worked on language analysis problems in the southern region of the country. The following year, he was sent to Luang Prabang, Laos to analyze the Khmu language and prepare language lessons for other missionaries to learn the language. While in Laos, Smalley also worked with Reverend G. Linwood Barney and Father Yves Bertrais in developing a writing system for the Hmong people. Together, they developed the Hmong Romanized Popular Alphabet (RPA), which is the most widely used Hmong writing system today.\nWith the outbreak of civil war in Laos, Smalley and his wife were forced to return to the United States in 1954. He completed his dissertation on the Khmu language and was awarded his doctorate in 1956. An abbreviated version of his dissertation was later published in 1961 as\nOutline of Khmu Structure. Over the next several years, Smalley worked primarily in Southeast Asia as a translation consultant for the American Bible Society (1954-1969) and as a regional translations coordinator (1969-72) and translation consultant (1972-77) with the United Bible Societies. Due to his work, he resided in Thailand from 1962 to 1967 and from 1969 to 1972. (He also lived in Thailand as a Fulbright research fellow in 1985 and 1986.)\nIn 1977, he decided to leave the United Bible Societies after 23 years.\nUnable to find employment, he worked briefly at a discount toy store. In 1978, Smalley relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota to accept a position as professor of linguistics at Bethel University (1978-87). In Minnesota, he unexpectedly found that thousands of Hmong refugees were also settling in the Twin Cities, which guided his research over the next decade. As an Honorary Fellow (1982-84) with the University of Minnesota Southeast Asia Refugee Studies Program, he took part in a project studying Hmong adaptation to life in the United States, publishing\nAdaptive Language Strategies of the Hmong: From Asian Mountains to American Ghettos: Stages of Hmong Cultural\nAdaptation (1986). He also studied the different Hmong scripts that had developed since RPA, in particular Pahawh Hmong script, which was created in 1959 in Laos by Shong Lue Yang. Smalley published two books on the script and its creator\nMother of Writing: The Origin and Development of a Hmong Messianic Script\n(1990) and The Life of Shong Lue Yang: Hmong Mother of Writing (1990), both of which he co-authored with Chia Koua Vang and Gnia Yee Yang. (1949).\nIn 1955, Smalley took over editorship of Practical Anthropology (now known as Missiology), which he edited from 1955 to1968. He also served as associate editor for Bible Translator (1957-59) and Language Sciences (1983-92).\nWhen he retired from Bethel College in 1987, he was awarded the college first annual Distinguished Teaching Award. In his retirement, he continued to write extensively and also edited Jacob A. Loewen's book, The Bible in Cross-Cultural Perspective, for which he wrote an introduction. He was involved with the ASA in the 1950s. In 1997, Smalley died of a heart attack at the age of 74.\"\nBiographical Notes: http://www.nmnh.si.edu/naa/fa/smalley.pdf, Register to the Papers of William A.

Smith, age 88, a resident of Windsor Park in Carol Stream, formerly of Winfield, Illinois, went to be with the Lord on Wednesday, February 10, 2021. He was born February 14, 1932, in Gasport, New York, to Albert and Marion Smith.\nAfter losing his father at a very early age, Albert, who preferred to be called Al, was a hard-working, diligent young man who worked for local farm families and excelled in his studies. In high school, while living with a local family, Al began attending church and accepted Jesus as his Savior. His pastor encouraged him to pursue a career in ministry and suggested he attend Wheaton College. At Wheaton, he took a biology class to meet a general requirement and it became his chief area of study as he and his wife, Audrey, planned to pursue full-time ministry combining education and missions.\nAfter receiving his BS in biology with highest honors in 1953, he attended Northern Baptist Theological Seminary and went on to teach at Elgin Academy in Elgin, IL, as well as pastoring a church and working for the post office. During the early years of his career, he earned his MS in ecology from Northern Illinois University and set up the biology department at the newly formed Judson College, also in Elgin, IL, where he taught from 1964–1967.\nIn 1967, he returned to Wheaton College as a biology professor and was thrilled to be working with some of the same professors who had encouraged him as a student. He was awarded a National Science Foundation Science Faculty Fellowship which enabled him to complete his PhD from the University of Chicago. During his 32 years on the faculty at Wheaton, Al taught genetics, bioethics, environmental ethics, and creation/evolution and supervised teacher education. For many summers, he taught and directed Wheaton’s Science Station in the Black Hills of South Dakota. He also taught at Wheaton’s Honey Rock campus in Wisconsin. His many accomplishments were recognized when he was awarded the Senior Teacher of the Year in 1979 and the Faculty Emeritus award in 1999.\nIn 1965 Al joined the American Scientific Affiliation. At that time he was at Judson College in Elgin, IL, which was then the home of the ASA office. Al served as secretary of the Chicago-area ASA local chapter. He worked on various local ASA projects and gave a paper at the 1973 Annual Meeting. He became a Fellow and was a candidate for the ASA Executive Council in 1980. He was designated a Fellow Emeritus in 2015.\nLooking back on his career, Al reflected, “There were numerous ways in which God had guided us. Often, we did not know it as such but in each of these experiences—Wheaton College, NBTS, Judson College, Valley View Baptist Church, Elgin Academy—God was preparing me to minister to many of the future leaders in evangelical Christianity by being able to show how learning methods such as science and theology could be integrated. This was a far greater ministry than the pastorate would have been. I am overwhelmed to find out one by one what some of our graduates are doing. For me, this is especially true of the teachers we have trained as we hear from near and far of their work in the Kingdom.”\nAfter retirement, Al stayed active in ministry to seniors in his local Evangel Baptist Church congregation and enjoyed his lifelong hobbies of gardening and traveling with his beloved wife, Audrey. He and Audrey first met in the 4th grade as classmates but attended different high schools. In 1950, after a “chance encounter,” Al invited Audrey to a high school graduation party and they soon became sweethearts for life, marrying in 1953. Clearly committed to his wife and children, Al took great pleasure in watching their children and grandchildren and great grandchildren grow up and express themselves as individuals. He was able to participate and even officiate in many of their marriages and newcomers to the family were always greeted with the warmest of hugs from “Dad,” “Father Dear,” and “Grandpops.”\nHis entire family is forever grateful for the loyalty and deep faith that he exemplified throughout his life as he humbly followed God’s lead. In his own words, “Looking back over the years, I am seeing more and more of how God has directed even though I haven’t understood how he was doing it at the time. My earnest conviction is that he is in charge and that anything accomplished will be up to him.”\nHe is survived by his wife of 67 years, Audrey, and 22 descendants in 3 generations.\ntopJohn L.

Stoner (1888-1980) Astronomy\nOnone of the 5 founding members of the ASA, died March 21, 1980, in Long Beach, California. Born in 1888, he would have been 92 in June.\nHe was an emeritus professor of science retired from Westmont College in Santa Barbara. He had an M.S. from the U. of California (1910). Alton Everest, first ASA president, and wife Elva attended Peter's funeral at Leisure World Community Church, preceding burial in the Santa Barbara Cemetery.\nHere is Alton's tribute: \";Peter Stoner was the Complete Teacher, a man of quiet dignity and deep Christian faith. During the halcyon days of the Los Angeles ASA section in the 1960s a planning meeting was held in Peter's home in Altadena. The meeting dragged on and at 10 p.m. sharp Peter rose, told us we could stay as long as we wished but that he was going to bed. Something of a night-owl in those days, I was shocked that anyone would go to bed at 10 p.m. At long last I understand. I'm now the age Peter was at that time and by 10:15 1 droop like last week's crocus. Peter was high on principle but low on prestige, form, and ritual. Knowing the teaching positions he held, people are surprised to learn that he didn't have a Ph.D. Here's the story on that. At a world-renowned California university he had finished all requirements for his doctorate in mathematics when his committee discovered that his completed and approved dissertation on a subject from his minor field of astronomy should have been in his major. Realizing their oversight, they apologetically agreed that all he would have to do to get his degree Was to construct some geometrical models for instructional use. That sop to university regulations was a bit too much for Peter-so, no degree, but lots of peace of mind. While Peter was in graduate school the pastor of the Presbyterian church he was attending came to him asking if he would take a class of 12 science students from China. Realizing America's strength had something to do with her spiritual underpinnings, the students had told the pastor they wanted to learn about Christianity, although they had no interest in becoming Christians. Peter accepted the challenge, and all 12 accepted Christ before returning to China. Many years ago Peter was invited to teach a Science and Scripture course at the Moody Bible Institute summer school. He informed the class that his door was continually open for personal conferences. Day and night for the rest of his stay he was deluged by a steady stream of students with questions. That was surely one of the highlights of his life, remembered with grateful satisfaction in his later years as a solid contribution to the spiritual strength of young people. \"At Pasadena City College Peter was Chairman of the Department of Mathematics, Astronomy, and Architecture. He taught there for 41 years. Roger Voskuyl, then president of Westmont College, pulled Peter back from the brink of a well-earned retirement to teach at Westmont. Teaching mathematics led to astronomy and then to head of the Science Department and building an observatory for Westmont's 16-inch reflecting telescope. In 1963 he left the haunting smell of chalk dust, having completed 50 years of teaching. \"Peter Stoner's lifelong views on the relationship of science and the Bible are set forth in his chapter, \"Astronomy and the First Chapter of Genesis,\" in the ASA's first book, Modern Science and Christian Faith. The same general thrust is in his book originally titled From Science To Souls and soon changed to Science Speaks published first by Moody Press and later by Van Kampen Press. Robert C. Newman, Ph.D. in astrophysics, is listed as co-author in recent editions. That book has sold over 350,000 copies in English and has been published in six languages. \"I have before me a copy of Peter's unpublished manuscript, God's Dealing With One Man, for which I wrote, in the preface, I have known and loved Peter Stoner for almost four decades. In observing him through the years one principle of God's leading is illustrated over and over ... that God guides by deflecting the course of His children who are already under way rather than boosting the indolent into the orbit of His choosing.\"\nAlton Everest Tribute*\ntop\nCharles\nDinwiddie Stores (1906 - 1985) Patent Attorney\nof Cocoa Beach, Florida, died of cancer on 4 July 1985 at the age of 79. \"Din\" was a chemical patent attorney who retired from Exxon Corporation after writing some 300 patents issued to Exxon inventors.

After preliminary correspondence, an invitation from Dr. Houghton brought five men to Chicago in September of 1941: Everest, Sturgis, Irving A. Cowperthwaite, Peter W. Stoner and John P. Van Haitsma.\nOnly a few months later the American Scientific Affiliation had a name and a constitution--and the U. S. entered World War II, making national meetings impossible for the ASA's first few years. Subsequent growth has demonstrated that the five \"founding fathers\" laid a good foundation, and we honor Russell Sturgis-as one of the five. ASA News is indebted to Mrs. Russell D. Sturgis, now of Princeton, N. J., and to F. Alton Everest for this information. Mrs. Sturgis wrote of her late husband's regret that he lacked the time and energy to participate in ASA activities in spite of his interest in the work of the Affiliation.

In 1952, he won a Rhodes Scholarship. He met his first wife, Elizabeth, while at Oxford and became deeply involved with different Christian student groups. It was here he committed himself to Christ. After marrying, the couple moved to Philadelphia, where Pat completed his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania. Their two eldest children were born during this time. Next stop was Cambridge for a post-doc and then Vancouver, where Pat took up a position as assistant professor of physics at UBC. Some five years later, with three children in tow, the family moved to London, Ontario, where Pat would join the brand-new Biophysics Department at the University of Western Ontario. He spent the rest of his career at UWO, retiring at the age of 65.\nScience in general and biophysics in particular were far from Pat's only interests. He was a devout Christian, often giving talks about the relationship between Christianity and science, and he spent a lot of his time on campus meeting and encouraging Christian students, especially international students. His love of music centered on two passions: country dancing and bagpipes. He heard his first bagpipes in Scotland at the age of 8 and never looked back. His love of dance began with square dances held in the family home in Toronto and over the years branched out to Scottish and English country dance, Morris, Playford and even Swedish country dance. Travel-to Japan, China, Turkey, Ireland, Greece, Mexico, Australia, Alaska, and many other lands-was another of his pleasures.\nPat joined the ASA in 2001 and was active in discussions of science and faith. Though there was no ASA chapter in the London area, Pat participated in talks and other activities in nearby chapters. He was warm, humble, and happy to be of service. He was also a very loyal and solid financial supporter of the CSCA, to the time of his passing.\nAt the age of 85, some 17 years after Elizabeth's death, Pat remarried. He spent his final years with his new wife Jeanine, dancing, playing duets, attending church together, and fully enjoying each other's company. His was a full life and a rich one, and he was grateful for every bit of it.\ntop\nJohn Marks Templeton (1912 - 2008)\nPhilanthropist died July 8, 2008 in Nassau, Bahamas, at age 95.

Sir John pioneered the use of globally diversified mutual funds. He was deeply involved in a multitude of philanthropic missions.\nHe established the John Templeton Foundation to encourage the use of scientific methods to discover more about the spiritual realm. In 1972, he created the Templeton Prize for Progress toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities. In 1987 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in recognition of his extensive charitable work. He collaborated with Robert Herrmann in writing numerous books and articles on faith-science themes. Sir John was a lifelong member of the Presbyterian Church and served as a trustee on the board of Princeton Theological Seminary for 42 years. He also served on the American Bible Society board.

Dr. Templeton\nwas 75 years old at the time of his passing, finally succumbing to his\nbattle with cancer.\nTempleton was the oldest of three children\nof Sir John Templeton. He began considering a career in medicine during\na summer internship in 1960 at a Presbyterian medical mission in\nCameroon. He received his MD from Harvard Medical School in 1968 and\ncompleted his internship and residency in surgery at the Medical College\nof Virginia in Richmond in 1973.\nDuring his time at Children’s\nHospital, the hospital gained an international reputation for\nits patients with conjoined twinning. Templeton performed numerous\nsurgeries on conjoined twins. He trained in pediatric\nsurgery at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia from 1973 to 1975\nunder the hospital’s surgeon-in-chief, C. Everett Koop, who later became\nU.S. surgeon general from 1982 to 1989. After serving for two years in\nthe Navy he returned to Children’s Hospital where he was the\ntrauma program director. During his tenure the hospital gained an\ninternational reputation for its patients with conjoined twinning.\nTempleton performed numerous surgeries on conjoined twins.\nDr. Templeton, known as “Jack,” retired from\nmedicine in 1995 to assume leadership of his father's namesake\nfoundation, the John Templeton Foundation.\nThe John Templeton\nFoundation serves as a philanthropic catalyst for discoveries on what\nscientists and philosophers call the big questions of human purpose and\nultimate reality, a vision derived from Sir John Templeton’s optimism\nabout the possibility of acquiring “new spiritual information” and from\nhis commitment to rigorous scientific research and related scholarship.\nThe Foundation’s primary funding areas include science and the big\nquestions, character and virtue development, individual freedom and free\nenterprise, genetics, exceptional cognitive talent and genius, and the\nTempleton Prize. Recent grants have explored topics such as gratitude,\nbeneficial purpose, exoplanets, and religious liberty.\nDuring Dr. Templeton’s 20 years at the helm of the Foundation, the endowment grew from $28 million to $3.34 billion, with 188 grants awarded in 2014 primarily to major universities and scholars worldwide. A total of $966 million in grants and charitable activities have been funded since the Foundation’s creation in 1987.

Dr. Tinkle taught at LaVerne College and for many years at Taylor University. Following this, he taught at Ball State Teachers College retiring about 1960. He published 11 papers in JASA in the period 1950-1963. He was an early participant in organizing the ASA but left it in 1961 to help recruit the pioneers of the Creation Research Society. Tinkle opposed evolution and Darwinian theory, but was an enthusiastic proponent of eugenics, and published several articles on the subject.\nIn his 1939 textbook \"Fundamentals of Zoology\" he devotes a section to \"The Need of Human Betterment\", where he laments the existence of\"defective families\" who \"give birth to offspring like themselves\" , producing \"persons of low mentality, paupers and criminals in much greater ratio than the general population\"[8, p. 130]. Negative eugenics via institutionalization seems to have been his preferred eugenic solution: His antievolution works include: Heredity: A Study in Science and the Bible, St. Thomas Press, 1969; Heredity (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1970); and God's Method in Creation (Nutley, NJ: Craig Press, 1973. see: William J.

From the Ivy League to community colleges, she taught everything from Anatomy and Physiology to Critical Thinking and the art of Calligraphy.\nBorn and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Margaret earned two degrees in biology from the University of Michigan (Go Blue!) and attended Princeton Theological Seminary, where she met her husband, Vernon. The couple would celebrate 55 years of marriage and raise two daughters, Cheyan and Jannay.\nMargaret joined the American Scientific Affiliation in 1997 and was elected a Fellow in 2005. She became a co-editor of the ASA Newsletter in 2002. She served in that role until 2011. The Nov/Dec 2002 issue of the newsletter published this introduction of her:\n“Margaret G Towne has taught biology for over twenty-five years at several institutions, from a community college to an Ivy League university. Presently she teaches at the U. of Nevada, Las Vegas. She has always felt called to being a Christian biology teacher and took a leave of absence early in her career to attend Princeton Seminary in order to become more grounded in that ministry. She earned her B.S. and M.S. in biology from the U. of Michigan. Her doctoral dissertation at Montana State University was titled, “The Influence of Critical Thinking on Christians’ Belief and Belief Change with Reference to the Polarities of Creationism and Organic Evolution.”\nThe world-famous paleontologist of Jurassic Park and The Lost World fame, Jack Horner, was on her doctoral committee. Margaret has participated in the Science and Religion Course Program through the Center for Theology and Natural Science in Berkeley, CA. She and Jack Horner won an award with their course titled “Bridging Science and Religion: A Critical Approach.” From January 1999 to May 2001, she was a “Distinguished Visiting Professor in Science and Religion” at Juniata College in Huntingdon, PA. She has been involved with bridging science and faith in Adult Education programs in churches at the local and national levels.

He graduated from Calvin College and received a PhD in chemistry from Michigan State University. On September 17, 1953, he married the minister’s daughter, Mary Huissen, in Grand Rapids. They moved to Washington, DC, where Bob held a research position at the US Naval Research Lab. In 1956 the lure of teaching led him to accept a chemistry professor position at Belhaven College, a small Christian college in Jackson, Mississippi.\nIn 1959 Bob took on the task of teaching chemistry at a brand new college in Chicago, Trinity Christian College, where he became Academic Dean. In 1974 the family moved to Toronto, where Bob assumed an executive position with the Institute for Christian Studies until his retirement. Over the years, Bob also played key roles in the establishment of King’s University in Edmonton, AB, and Redeemer University College in Hamilton, ON. After retirement, Bob served as part-time Executive Director of Global Scholars Canada.\nBob had a lifelong interest in the connections between Christianity and science and in Christian higher education which honored both. He was a long-time member of the American Scientific Affiliation which he joined in 1956. He published several articles in the ASA journal, most notably Is Scientific Research Value Free? and An Essential Religious Unity. In 2008 Bob published his highly acclaimed, A University for the People: A History of the Institute for Christian Studies. This work marked a capstone in his work of fostering Christian academic community through his vivid narration of the talents and contributions of all those associated with the early years and growth of the Institute.\nOn his arrival in Toronto, Bob threw his support behind the fledgling Canadian branch of the ASA, the Canadian Scientific and Christian Affiliation (CSCA) established in 1973. In 1982 he was appointed as the first President of the CSCA, a position he held with great enthusiasm for 10 years. During this period Bob helped the CSCA mature as a distinctly Canadian ministry active in most major universities through close association with the Christian Reformed Campus Chaplaincy. Bob’s passion was for building up Christian academic ministry wherever possible. He was a consummate community builder, and laid the groundwork for much of the CSCA's success during the 80s and 90s.\nThrough his tenure as president of the CSCA, Bob chaired the CSCA Executive Council meetings in the Board Room of the ICS where he sought to develop strong linkages between his tradition of Reformed Christian scholarship and the work of the CSCA. Whenever a new member would join the CSCA, Bob would be in touch and encourage them to become active in the organization. It was through Bob’s outreach that I myself joined the CSCA in the mid 80s, and served as campus resource associate (1985-1987), and joined the CSCA Executive Council in 1992. My debt to Bob here is very considerable.\nBob was a consummate practitioner of servant leadership, and his vision for the CSCA lives on in many aspects of the organization. It is not a matter of coincidence that the current Executive Director of the CSCA, Arnold Sikkema, comes out of the same Reformed tradition that nourished Bob’s passion for a robust engagement of Christian faith with aspects of learning, especially the interaction between faith and science.\n*Hultgren Funeral Home and Cremation Services\ntop\nKarl K. Turekian (1927-2013) Geochemistry\nBorn Oct. 25, 1927, Turekian was raised in New Jersey and the Bronx, the son of Armenian immigrants and genocide survivors. He served in the U.S. Navy, received his bachelors from Wheaton College in 1949, and then, in 1955, earned one of the first doctorates in geochemistry awarded by Columbia University. He was a student there under Larry Kulp, an early ASA Fellow.\nHe joined the Yale faculty the next year and married his wife, Roxanne, in 1962.\nOver the next five decades, his trademark became the inventive use\nof trace elements, natural radioactive elements, and radiogenic\nisotopes for understanding processes of the Earth, its atmosphere,\nand oceans. He examined an uncommonly broad range of planetary science including the sediments of the deep seas, the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park, meteorite strikes, and the composition of moon rocks, died March 15 in Branford. He was 85. The cause was cancer.\nHe shed light on acid rain, cosmic dust flux, sediment accumulation, the global transport of metals through the atmosphere, the circulation of Long Island Sound, the composition of the continental crust, and the origin of the solar system, among other phenomena. His research bolstered the idea that a giant meteorite strike led to the extinction of the dinosaurs, and he advanced new methods for testing models of atmospheric circulation and identifying art forgeries.\nKarl Turekian was at the forefront of expanding the scope of questions that could be addressed by geochemistry and developing new techniques to answer them said Bill Graustein, who studied under Turekian and remained a close friend. He consistently used his encyclopedic knowledge of the study of the Earth to take techniques developed in one area and apply them to unsolved problems in other areas.\"\nTurekian fondly recalled dozens of former students and fellow researchers by name in a 2005 autobiographical piece published in the\nAnnual Review of Earth and Planetary Science. My undergraduate and graduate students brought excitement to my life at Yale then and this has continued to the present day. He wrote. Over a long career, Turekian who at the time of his death was Sterling Professor of Geology & Geophysics Emeritus, Yale highest faculty rank wrote hundreds of journal articles and five books, including \"Oceans,\" \"Man and the Ocean\" (with Yale geologist B.J. Skinner), \"Chemistry of the Earth,\" \"Oceanography\" (with C. Drake, J. Imbrie and J. Knauss), and \"Global Environmental Change.\" Turekian served in editorial positions of eight scholarly journals and in a wide variety of administrative roles at Yale.\nHe was chair of the Department of Geology & Geophysics for most of the 1980s; curator-in-charge of meteorites and planetary science at the Peabody Museum of Natural History; director of the Center for the Study of Global Change; and director of the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, among other learned societies, and received many honors during his career. These included the Goldschmidt Medal of the Geochemical Society, the Maurice Ewing Medal of the American Geophysical Union and the Wollaston Medal of The Geological Society of London, and, from the Yale College Phi Beta Kappa chapter, the William Clyde DeVane Medal for distinguished teaching and scholarship.\nTurekian is survived by his wife, Roxanne; two children, Karla Ann Turekian and Vaughan Charles Turekian; a daughter-in-law, Heather Leigh Turekian; two grandchildren, Aleena Marie Turekian and Charles (\"Chip\") Henry Turekian; and many cousins, nieces, and nephews.

Born in Zandeweer in The Netherlands, he completed a thesis on spectroscopy at the U. of Gronigen at age 24, then joined the Natuurkundig laboratorium of N.V. Philips, where he developed a lifelong interest in electronics and \"noise.\"\nAldert and his family endured the Nazi occupation of Holland, emigrated to the U. of British Columbia, Canada, in 1947, then to Minnesota in 1950. He advised over 80 doctoral students and published hundreds of research papers, continuing his research activity after becoming Emeritus in 1980. Since 1968 he had also taught part-time at the U. of Florida in Gainesville.\nAldert wrote some 15 textbooks and two books on science and religion:\nThe Natural Sciences and the Christian Message (1960) and\nGenesis and Scientific Inquiry (1965). He received many honors, including two honorary doctorates and membership in the National Academy of Engineering. He had once participated actively in the North Central section of ASA and contributed to ASA's Journal. Aldert Van der Ziel\nwas the 1975 recipient of the American Society for Engineering Education. Vincent Bendix Award, its preeminent award for distinction in engineering research.\nBorn and raised in the Netherlands, Aldert received his Ph.D. in physics at the University of Groningen in 1934. After a stint as electronics physicist at the Philips Research Laboratory in Eindhoven, Holland, he joined the faculty of the University of British Columbia in 1947. In 1950 he moved to the U. of Minnesota, where he is professor of electrical engineering. He also serves as a graduate research professor at the U. of Florida. Through his research, consulting, and teaching, Aldert has become one of the world's authorities on noise in a wide variety of solid state devices. His classic text on noise first published in 1959 quickly established his preeminence in the subject. He has published six other books and well over 200 technical papers, while seeing more than 50 students through their Ph.D degrees.\nOne nominator for the Bendix Award pointed out that Aldert's scholarly production has continued to increase. Averaged over 42 years, he has published about five or six papers a year, but in recent years he has produced over ten per year--a sizeable number of them as sole author. The nominator added: \"There is no argument that Professor van der Ziel is the world's outstanding authority on noise in electron devices. Whether he has contributed more of lasting value to this subject than all other scientists and engineers taken together could be argued, but perhaps it is not a far exaggeration. In 1955, he gave the first rigorous treatment of shot noise in junction diodes and transistors. In 1962, he provided the first rigorous discussion of noise in junction field-effect transistors; and, in 1963, he identified the mechanism contributing gate noise in this device. In 1964, he pointed out a source of noise in gas lasers that has proved to be of great practical significance. \"From my association with Professor van der Ziel during the past five years, I have found that he combines brilliance and enthusiasm with humility--a rare combination. By doing so, he sets a model for both students and his colleagues. In my experience, he constantly encourages and supports the efforts of others.\" Another nominator added that Alder \"has made, in addition, a meaningful contribution to the dialogue between science and religion, and has taught and written in this demanding area.\n\"In addition to all the technical societies to which he belongs, Aldert van der Ziel is a Fellow of the American Scientific Affiliation. We congratulate our brother for receiving this distinguished award and thank God for Aldert's example to us.

He attended Calvin College, graduating in 1960. He earned his PhD in physics at Michigan State University in 1965. For two years he did post-doctoral research at the University of California at Riverside while also teaching at the University of Redlands. His research experience included both solid-state physics and millimeter-wave astronomy. In 1967 he joined the physics faculty at Calvin College where he taught for 31 years.\nHoward joined the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) on January 28, 1980. He was elected a Fellow and then elected to the ASA Executive Council in 1987 where he served for five years. Howard published 7 articles in Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith and was actively involved in many dialogs on controversial issues such as evolution and intelligent design.\nHe published a seminal book in 1986 called The Fourth Day: What the Bible and the Heavens are Telling Us about the Creation. He argued that evolution did not contradict the biblical doctrine of creation, focusing on the meaning of the fourth day of creation and his own knowledge of stellar evolution. He joined colleagues Davis Young and Clarence Menninga in publishing Science Held Hostage: What's Wrong With Creation Science and Evolutionism in 1988. In 1990 he was the lead author of the book Portraits of Creation: Biblical and Scientific Perspectives on the World's Formation including contributions from colleagues Robert E. Snow, John H. Stek, and Davis A. Young. Howard joined 3 co-authors in 1999 to publish Three Views on Creation and Evolution (Counterpoints), cementing his prowess in dialog with various viewpoints.\nHoward also proposed the concept of the Robust Formational Economy Principle (RFEP) according to which at the beginning of the universe all the potential to form our universe and life on this earth was present. While the name hasn’t survived the test of time, his core idea is alive and well.\nVan Till was one of the founding members of the International Society for Science and Religion. In addition to the ASA, he was a member of the American Astronomical Society and an advisory board member for the John Templeton Foundation. Howard and Betty created a scholarship in Howard's name for students at Calvin University pursuing degrees in physics and biological sciences.\nHis approach to biblical interpretation in The Fourth Day generated significant backlash, particularly from the Christian Reformed Church leaders, though the Calvin College leadership supported him. It was a very helpful book for me (Randy Isaac) personally as well as many in the ASA. His broader support for evolution stimulated valuable discussions in many venues. The intensity of the opposition, however, had a significant effect on Howard’s own views. Over time, he moved toward a more liberal understanding of the Scriptures. In 2002 he requested that his ASA membership be changed from Fellow to Friend and then let his membership expire in 2005.\nThrough all the turmoil over his ideas, he remained respectful, listening to other viewpoints and patiently explaining his own views and opinions of other views. He has influenced a wide audience and challenged all of us to think about new ideas.\nHoward is survived by his wife Betty, his four children: Steve (Robin), Roger (Mary), Nancy, and MaryBeth (Scott) as well as eight grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren.\n*by Randy Isaac\nGordon J. Van Wylen of Holland, MI, died on Thursday, November 5, 2020, having reached the century mark on February 6, 2020, when he turned 100 years-old. As a devoted and doting husband, a dedicated, loving, and playful father, a person of deep and abiding faith, a respected and appreciated Hope College president, and an impactful community contributor, his earthly life will be sorely missed.\nGordon's Christian faith was his defining dimension. It shaped his family, work, and community life. He drew upon it as his personal foundation and motivation, and in turn this was a catalyst and inspiration for many others. In all things, he saw his ultimate purpose to be an avenue for God's love and to realize, both individually and in community, the grace known through Jesus Christ.\nBorn in Grant Township, Van Wylen grew up in Grand Rapids and graduated from Ottawa Hills High School. He attended Calvin University on the 3-2 engineering program with the University of Michigan, graduating in 1942 with joint degrees from both institutions.\nAfter graduation, Gordon enlisted in the US Navy, receiving a commission as Ensign in 1943. He joined the Submarine Service and was assigned to the USS Hardhead, upon which he served for two years, completing six war patrols in the Pacific during WWII. In honor of his military service, he received on-court recognition through the University of Michigan's Toyota Hero of the Game program during the university's basketball game versus UCLA in December 2018. In 1988, Gordon learned that a Japanese naval officer from a Japanese light cruiser that the Hardhead had sunk on its first patrol had written a book in Japanese that told the story of how some 190 survivors rowed 300 miles in lifeboats, under very difficult circumstances, to safely reach the Philippines. Believing that this story would be of interest to American readers, Gordon, in conjunction with Japanese colleagues, translated and rewrote the story by merging it with the Hardhead's experience. This book, with two Japanese co-authors, was published in 1994 under the title, Encounter at Sea.\nAfter the war, Gordon completed a master's degree in engineering at the University of Michigan in 1947 and his doctorate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1951. Subsequently, he joined the faculty in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Michigan. After moving through the academic ranks to be a Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Department Chair, he served as Dean of the College of Engineering from 1965-72. In 1959 he published a textbook, Thermodynamics, which was widely used in the United States and translated into a number of foreign languages, remaining in print, eventually by co-authors, for 60+ years.\nIn 1972, Gordon was appointed the ninth president of Hope College; he served in this role until 1987. During his tenure, there was an increase in enrollment, growth of the endowment, several campus buildings were built/renovated, 12th Street was closed with the resulting expansion of the Pine Grove, and an emphasis on academic excellence in the context of the Christian faith built Hope's national reputation. In recognition of the many contributions to Hope College by Gordon and his wife Margaret, the library that was completed shortly after his retirement was named the Gordon and Margaret Van Wylen Library.\nGordon's commitment to excellence certainly did not end with his retirement from Hope College. Upon retirement at the age of 67, few would have guessed that he was just beginning the longest \"job\" of his career, as for the next 30 years he worked with Holland city officials and community leaders to revitalize downtown Holland and the surrounding central city. Snowmelt, a hallmark of downtown Holland, was installed through the ingenuity and determination of Gordon and others who built an impressive public/private partnership for this and many other projects that are foundational to Holland's currently thriving downtown and surrounding neighborhoods. Homecor was started by Gordon, providing urban renewal and affordable housing to the central city. Along with wife Margaret, Gordon was the grand marshal for Holland's Tulip Time Volksparade in May 2005. To recognize Gordon's contributions to the community, the Gordon Van Wylen Green at Chamber Pointe was established in 2019.\nOver the years, Gordon served as a member, and sometimes as chairperson, of the Boards of a number of organizations including InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Holland Community Foundation, Words of Hope, Bethany Christian Services, Homecor, Pine Rest Christian Hospital, and Van Andel Education Institute.\nGordon joined the American Scientific Affiliation in January of 1960 while he was on the faculty at the University of Michigan. In December of 1964 he gave a talk on “Thermodynamics and Theology” at the Western Michigan section of the ASA. He was remembered by many Christian engineers for this quote in several editions of his textbook on thermodynamics:\n“A final point to be made is that the second law of thermodynamics and the principle of increase in entropy have great philosophical implications. The question that arises is how did the universe get into the state of reduced entropy in the first place, since all natural processes known to us tend to increase entropy? ... The author has found that the second law tends to increase his conviction that there is a Creator who has the answer for the future destiny of man and the universe.”\nIn 1978 Hope College hosted the ASA Annual Meeting and Gordon was pleased to be able to personally welcome the attendees as both Hope College president and ASA member.\nIn 1978 Hope College hosted the ASA Annual Meeting and Gordon was pleased to be able to personally welcome the attendees.\nAlways active in church life, Gordon was instrumental in establishing the Ann Arbor Christian Reformed Church in the 1950's and in the rejuvenation of Pillar Church as a joint Reformed Church of America/Christian Reformed Church congregation just a few years ago.\nIn 1951, Gordon married Margaret DeWitt, and the two remained life and faith partners for 66 years until Margaret's death in 2018.\n*Langeland Sterenberg Funeral Home\n(founding ASA member) was born 1 April 1884 in Zutphen, Michigan, to Mr. and Mrs. Peter J. Van Haitsma When he was eight, the family moved to Grand Rapids where he received his early education. His high school training was at Central High School and the preparatory department of Calvin College. He attended the University of Michigan where he received his AB and AM degrees, specializing in the natural sciences. In 1909, when Calvin College was expanding its curriculum, he was appointed to teach science. This later narrowed down to organic science.\nWhen Calvin became a full-fledged college, Van Haitsma became head of its organic science department. During this period he continued his studies at the University of Michigan and the University of Chicago. For several summers he attended the biological station of the University of Michigan at Douglas Lake, working toward a PhD which he received in 1928. In the course of his research in parasitology, he discovered two new species of fish parasites which he described in his dissertation. In 1942, shortly after the ASA was organized, he privately published a book, The Supplanter Undeceived, which involved the heredity of the ringstreaked and spotted sheep and goats in Labans conception of prenatal influences.

He had gone into the hospital a week earlier for severe abdominal pain which was diagnosed as pancreatitis. He developed renal shutdown, could not be dialyzed without a fall in blood pressure, He was cathaterized to check central venous pressure but lost consciousness and did not recover.\nKurt's death will leave a big hole in many people's lives. He was a big man, both physically and spiritually, but a modest man who expressed his love for Jesus Christ by sharing his faith with others and serving them in practical ways. An active witness for Christ among students and colleagues, he was one of the founders of the Federation Christian Fellowship, which for almost thirty years has met at the annual meeting of FASEB (Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology).\nKurt Weiss learned of ASA in 1956 from biochemist Walt Hearn when they met on an airport bus in Brussels, Belgium, at the 20th International Congress of Physiology. Elected to the ASA Executive Council in 1977, Kurt became president of ASA in 1979 -- the year the building containing our national office (in Elgin, Illinois) burned down, destroying most ASA records. The ASA found itself deeply in debt. Kurt not only saw us through that troubled year but accepted a second term as president to get ASA on its feet again. (Hany Lubansky, Jr. stepped in as interim executive officer, preceding Bob Herrmann.)\nWho could forget Kurt's moving presidential message at one Annual Meeting, and a reprise of it at another one, telling of his personal spiritual history. Born a Jew in the Catholic city of Graz, Austria, Kurt barely escaped the Nazi terror by immigrating to the U.S. as a teenager. A labored, often simplistic witness of fellow students at Oklahoma Baptist University introduced him to Jesus Christ, whom Kurt took as his own Lord and Savior during a stint in the U.S. Army.\nHis B.S. from O.B.U. was followed by an M.S. from the U. of Tennessee in 1950 and a Ph.D. from Rochester in 1953. Kurt's areas of specialization were gerontology and endocrinology. He was the author of many technical papers and a chapter on \"The Physiology of Aging\" in Greenfield's\nSurgery in the Aged (1975). He served on the councils of the Society for Experimental Biology & Medicine and the Gerontological Society and had been vice president of the latter and president of the Southwestern Section of the American Physiological Society. He served the University of Oklahoma and its medical school in many ways and was on the Governor's Advisory Committee on Aging. Kurt's colleagues all admired his teaching and his concern for students. On learning of his serious illness, President Horton notified the Dean of the medical school that Dr. Weiss had been awarded the David Ross Boyd Professorship for outstanding teaching and guidance of students.\nProfessor Roger Thies, when informing ASA of his colleague's death, called that a fitting tribute to such a caring teacher, adding, \"I will remember him for how much he loved other people.\" The Weiss's son Tom and Kurt's brother from Virginia flew to Oklahoma City before Kurt died. Many of us had also come to love Mary Weiss, at her husband's side at ASA Annual Meetings. We prayed with them for the recovery from cancer of their daughter- in-law and rejoiced in the birth of their \"miracle grandchild.\" We share Mary's grief, but also her comfort in knowing that Kurt is with the Lord.\nKurt Weiss, having just begun a sabbatical to learn about the use of computers for student learning, died in February, 1987, of complications of pancreatitis. This indicated his life-long dedication to students and their learning.\nDr. Weiss was born in Graz, Austria, and grew up as a Jew, the son of a physician. He was sent to Dachau concentration camp as a teenager, but was soon released and sent to London and then to New York City as World War II was developing. He later attended Oklahoma Baptist University on a scholarship for a year before joining the U.S. Army. He became a Baptist and served as a medical technician and interpreter for three years. After the war he returned to Oklahoma Baptist University for his B.S. degree and married a nursing student from Oklahoma. He received his M.S. degree from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville in 1950 and his Ph.D. from the University\nof Rochester in 1953. He published on the endocrine responses to cold exposure and the physiology of aging. He taught at the University of Miami, was chairman of Biology at Oklahoma City University, and finally spent over two decades in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City.\nKurt Weiss was a friend to students and colleagues. He cared about every person whom he contacted and would cordially welcome strangers into groups where he was present. His later years were spent as an administrator and counselor of students, coordinating up to four different courses within his department. He had a knack for remembering the names of hundreds of students, and would inquire about their progress years after having them in class.\nThe University of Oklahoma awarded him a David Ross Boyd Professorship posthumously, for outstanding teaching, guidance, and leadership of students.\nKurt Weiss also served on many university and civic boards and for many national organizations. He was book editor for the\nJournal of Gerontology for five years and Chairman of the National Membership Committee of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine from 1975 until his death. He had many offices in the American Scientific Affiliation and was a director of the Larry Jones (Feed the Children) International Ministries for 16 years.\nKurt Weiss was a gentleman who could listen, encourage, and help everyone accomplish their goals. We will miss his immediate acceptance, kind words, and continuing support. We will remember him as someone who could love all persons.\nRoger Thies, Ph.D., Associate Professor, University of Oklahoma*\ntop\nC. Bruce Wenger (1942-2002 Environmental Medicine\nC.

They were high school sweethearts, were married in 1952 and lived “hand in hand” throughout their lives. They enjoyed the happiness of being married to their best friend. Having met in Columbia, SC, life took them to Knoxville, TN; Athens, GA; Huntsville, AL; Newport, RI; Dahlgren, VA; Durham, NC; Tallahassee, FL; Auburn, AL; Edinburgh, Scotland; Alexandria, VA; and back to Columbia in 1998.\nLeland held degrees in mathematics from the University of South Carolina, the University of Georgia, and Duke University where he obtained a PhD. He found himself at the right time and with the right background to be a leader in the creation of a new profession: computer science.\nLeland applied his math skills to work at Redstone Arsenal and testing rocket fuses at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, VA, where he earned the rank of Lieutenant JG. He was a proud Navy Veteran. He was a math and computer science professor and computer center director at Florida State University and Auburn University. Most of his career was then spent leading TUCC (Triangle Universities Computation Center), the shared mainframe computer center for Duke University, the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State University. During that time, he was also a visiting advisor to the computer center at Edinburgh University. His final position took him to the Naval Research Laboratory where he worked on supercomputer planning with all branches of the military.\nHe was active in many national professional groups which were vital to the emergence of computer science. In 2006 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Special Interest Group on University and College Computing Services (SIGUCCS) of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM). He was a member of the BITNET Executive Committee and Board of Trustees: BITNET was a predecessor to today’s internet and email for universities, worldwide.\nPerhaps his longest and fondest professional association was with the American Scientific Affiliation of which he was a Fellow. The ASA is an international network of Christians in the sciences. Leland would say:\nGod reveals himself both through his natural creation and through the Bible. Science is man’s attempt to understand natural creation and theology is man’s attempt to understand the God who is revealed in the Bible. Since God is the author of both, they cannot conflict. When they appear to do so it is either because science or theology has erred in its interpretation.\nLeland joined the ASA in 1962. In the June 1966 issue of the Journal of the ASA, he published the article “A Christian View of the Computer Revolution.” In 1974, he helped organize and then served as president of the Research Triangle section of the ASA. He was elected an ASA Fellow and awarded the status of Fellow Emeritus in 2012. He attended many annual meetings and was a faithful supporter of the ASA throughout his life.\nHis friends, family, and associates recognized him as Durham’s Father of the Year. His faith, his sense of civic duty, and his and Cornelia’s love of the arts led him to serve in many capacities in the church and community. Just a few include Golden K Kiwanis Club, Eastminster Presbyterian Church elder, Stephen Minister, footcare ministry, hurricane Katrina recovery and Habitat for Humanity projects, English Speaking Union, Evening Music Club, a dental clinic in Dominica, Chairman of Deacon Boards, Sunday School Director and teacher, Boy Scout Troop Committee Chairman, Washington Symphony Orchestra Vice President.\nIn recent, post-retirement life his passion has been evangelism. He introduced and led Alpha at Eastminster Presbyterian Church, of course with Cornelia’s support.

He was 84. Winter stepped onto the world stage in 1974 at the International Congress on World Evangelization in Lausanne, Switzerland. There he issued a call for other Protestant evangelists to proselytize to the world's \"unreached people,\" those who had not been exposed to Christianity. In identifying mission fields, Winter looked for \"ethnic pockets,\" isolated areas where language, ethnicity, culture and social status as well as religion had hindered the spread of the Christian Gospel.\nHe began his career as a Presbyterian missionary in Guatemala in 1956. Ten years later he returned to the United States to become professor of missions at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena. At Fuller he trained missionaries, sharing with students his experiences working with the indigenous Maya people of Latin America. In 1976 he decided to leave the classroom to become a strategist for Christian outreach, founding the interdenominational U.S. Center for World Mission on the former campus of Pasadena Nazarene College. A year after establishing a research institute there, he founded the related William Carey International University.\nWinter was born in South Pasadena in December 1924, the middle son of Hugo H. Winter, a prominent freeway designer with the Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering, and his wife, Hazel. He earned a bachelor's degree in civil engineering at Caltech before serving in the Navy during World War II. After his discharge, Winter switched gears and studied for a doctorate in linguistics, anthropology and mathematical statistics at Cornell. He then attended Columbia, where he received a master's degree in teaching English as a second language, and Princeton Theological Seminary, where he was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1956.\nBy then he was prepared for his missionary calling to Guatemala, setting out with his wife, Roberta, a registered nurse whom he had married in 1951. They had four daughters, all of whom became involved in missionary work. Roberta died in 2001. Winter is survived by his second wife, Barbara; daughters Elizabeth Gill, Rebecca Lewis, Linda Dorr and Patricia Johnson; 14 grandchildren; one great-grandchild; and two brothers, Paul, a structural engineer, and David, president of Westmont College in Santa Barbara. --claire.noland@latimes.com*\ntop\nHarold Winters (1932-2016) Physicist of San Jose, CA\nHarold Winters passed away on January 21, 2016.

Newsletter, Wheaton Archives 2-3-03*\ntop\nJames Wylie Jr (????-2019) Chemistry\nJames Wylie Jr, an environmental chemist, passed away on November 8, 2019. He joined the ASA in 1977 and was an ASA member for more than 40 years. He was a member of the Southern California local chapter of the ASA.\nJim Wylie was a friend of mine. And he was the one who introduced me to ASA many years ago. In 1965 Jim interviewed me to teach at Orange Coast College where he taught until 1984, I think and I taught until 2002. I remember him telling me once that they were in a movie theater and a woman he didn't remember identified herself as a former student and said that she had become a follower of Jesus. He was pleased with that. Jim learned Japanese during the end of WWII and would speak some to his Japanese students in their language. And for the unknowns in General Chemistry lab, he used Japanese characters for the numbers of the unknowns. His students earned him a very good reputation as a teacher with chemistry departments at local universities.\nHe was a Baptist and we joined that church to attend his young adult Sunday School class. Then we both moved to Trinity United Presbyterian church where he played the piano for children's choirs and for his adult SS class. Jim was a sponsor of the IV chapter at OCC for a number of years, but it was difficult having a chapter at a two-year college.\nGiny and I went to Jim's and Barbara's home to watch mankind's first step on the moon because we didn't have an operating TV. Jim never attended an ASA annual conference, as far as I know, probably because of family circumstances and teaching summer school. Jim is survived by his wife, Barbara, a son, and some grandchildren.\n*Bill Roundy\ntop\nWilliam H. Wymer (1920-2015) Entomology.\nBill Wymer passed away peacefully at his home in North Potomac, MD, on April 2, 2015, with his devoted wife at his side. He is survived by his wife, Judith, of 63 years and their five children and twelve grandchildren. He received his Bachelor’s degree at Louisiana State University in entomology. He served as a Ship’s Officer in the US Army Transport Service during World War II and was later employed as a civilian entomologist at the US Navy Bureau of Yards and Docks and then with the Federal Drug Administration. He was a member of the Emmanuel Lutheran Church in Bethesda, MD, and joined the ASA in August 2006.\ntop\nDavis A. Young (1941-2024) geologist\nDave had a distinguished academic and professional journey. He earned an undergraduate degree from Princeton in 1962, a Master's degree from Penn State in 1965, and a Ph.D. in Geology from Brown University in 1969. He taught at New York University from 1968-1973 and then at U of North Carolina-Wilmington from 1973-1978. In 1978 he began a 26-year career teaching at Calvin College. His contributions to the field extend beyond teaching, with several publications exploring the history of geology and its intersection with Christianity, reflecting a deep engagement with both his discipline and personal faith.\nDavis joined the American Scientific Affiliation in 1972 while still at NYU. He published 9 articles in the journal of the ASA from 1979 to 2009. He wrote or co-wrote a dozen books: a biography of his renowned father, OT scholar E.J. Young, 8 books on the relationship between science and faith and 3 books on the history of igneous petrology for which he won the Mary Rabbitt Award from the Geological Society of America. Creation and the Flood, published in 1977, had a very broad impact (especially on me personally, Randy). In 1982 he wrote Christianity and the Age of the Earth which was updated in 2008 with Ralph Stearley as The Bible, Rocks and Time: Geological Evidence for the Age of the Earth. These books were powerful resources for studying evidence concerning the age of the earth and the Genesis Flood.\nOutside of his professional life, he loved classical music. He also pursued birding, a hobby that demonstrates his appreciation for the natural world, complementing his geological expertise with a passion for the diversity of life. His legacy will be found in the quiet kindness, love and generosity of spirit he modeled to his family and friends, his academic contributions, and in the students he has inspired throughout his career.\nHis colleague and co-author, Ralph Stearley wrote this appropriate tribute for him: \"I first became acquainted with Dave Young remotely, by reading, in 1978, his 1977 book, Creation and the Flood. [the book jacket included a photo of Dave, so at least I knew what he looked like!] Then I read his 1982 book, Christianity and the Age of the Earth, as I was changing careers to geology and earning my M.S. The books were an enormous encouragement to me and to an entire generation of younger evangelical scientists during the 1980's…\nAs I completed my Ph.D. At Univ. Michigan, 1985-1990, I had opportunities to meet personally with Dave as well as other Calvin geology faculty. Eventually, God opened up doors for me to join in 1992 and I became a close colleague and good friend to Dave. Eventually, we rewrote Christianity and the Age of the Earth, as The Bible, Rocks and Time (IVP, 2008, 510 pp.). That book is kept in print and is still influencing a younger generation of Christian scientists…\nDave was soft-spoken and very humble. He had a wry sense of humor and was adept with a pun. Besides his love of minerals, which began in his teen years, he was a dedicated birdwatcher. You may know already that his father was the highly regarded Old Testament scholar, Edward J. Young, of Westminster Seminary. Dave wrote a warm biography of his father, and his family life while growing up. Growing up in Philadelphia, Dave had a particular fondness for the Adirondacks and the Appalachian Mtns. After retirement in 2004, Dave and Dottie lived for 10 years in Tucson and he fell in love with that landscape and its geology and natural history, as well.\nDave's faith informed his classroom teaching on a daily basis, as well as his collegial relationships and his guidance of our department during his time as chair.”\n*Ralph Stearley\nOf Toronto, Ontario, died on 4 March 1986 at age 51, after a ten-month battle with cancer. Zylstra received an LL.B. degree from the\" University of Michigan\" He received a S.J.D. from the Free University where he studied under Herman Dooyeweerd. Zylstra's dissertation was on the political theory of Harold Laski. Later, Zylstra would publish the relate From Pluralism to Collectivism: The Development of Harold Laski's Political Though in 1968.\nHis younger brother, Calvin College biology professor Uko Zylstra, paid tribute to him at a memorial service held on March 7 in Yorkminster Park Baptist Church. \"Bernie\" had been principal or presidentand the professor of political theory of the Institute for Christian Studies (ICS) from its founding in 1967 until ill health forced him to resign in 1985. He was an alumnus and former staff member in political science of the Free University of Amsterdam. Liturgist at the memorial service was his former theology professor, Lewis Smedes of Fuller Theological Seminary, who had performed the wedding ceremony when Bernie married his wife Jocina in 1959. Bernie's work prospered and ICS developed into a Canadian Christian graduate school in the Reformed tradition. to; he was a member of the editorial board of The International Reformed Bulletin He was also president of the Association for the Advancement of Christian Scholarship from 1983.\nHis contribution to the ASA was in philosophy, especially at the 'world view' level.
