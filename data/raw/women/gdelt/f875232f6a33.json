But rarely in college sports, or even education more broadly. The reason, of course, is that the academic calendar runs August through May at most schools across the country, and thus the year's milestones are thought of in that time frame.\nGetting myself into that mindset this past week as I remembered the year that was in Murfreesboro has been tougher than I thought for that very reason. So much of the beginning of 2022 feels like years ago, compared to the new school year we started this summer, and especially compared to the football season just capped off with a Hawai'i Bowl win, the first time ever the Blue Raiders have won back-to-back bowl games.\nBut taking myself back, it's evident just how much of the foundation for the future of Middle Tennessee Athletics was laid in 2022.\nThe beginning of the year was a magical time in the Glass House, with both the Blue Raiders and Lady Raiders dominating on the Murphy Center court. It all started, funny enough given the winter vortex that just tore through the mid-state this past week, with a snowstorm that moved the usual Thursday/Saturday slate to a Friday/Sunday schedule, with two dominant Lady Raider wins over Rice and North Texas starting off 2022 in style for MTSU.\nYes, it was a winter to remember in 2022 for Blue Raider Nation, as the crowds in the Murphy Center swelled with each win, culminating in several fantastic nights of basketball. The men's team clinched the C-USA East Division title against Western Kentucky on Senior Night. Rick Insell earned his 400th career win on Senior Day a week later against Old Dominion. And of course, there was the return of post-season basketball to the Murphy Center, with the Lady Raiders' run to the WNIT Semifinals.\nBoth programs have bigger goals, NCAA Tournament hopes in 2023. But the success and foundation laid in 2022, both in the previous season and strong start for each team in the current one, has positioned them well to make a run in 2023.\nThe winter was also marked with mourning, however, as we lost our great coach and great friend Dean A. Hayes, who passed away on January 7. With Hayes in our hearts, the Track and Field program continued its excellence through the indoor and outdoor seasons, with Blue Raider greats like Eusila Chepkemei, Alaba Akintola, Esther Isa and Benjamin Onyekwelu earning individual C-USA titles in 2022. Keith Vroman was promoted from interim to full-time head coach of the program, and is continuing that legacy alongside so many great Blue Raiders.\nWinter turned to spring at the Adams Tennis Complex, where Jimmy Borendame's Men's Tennis program earned MTSU its first national seed in the 21st century when they were selected as the No. 1 seeded team in the Raleigh Regional (No. 16 overall nationally) after winning their third-consecutive C-USA title. A first-round sweep over UNC Wilmington would give MTSU just its third-ever appearance in the Round of 32 at the NCAA Tournament, the program's first since 2003.\nOut on the golf course, Michael Barnard became the C-USA Champion in men's golf, winning by one stroke at the 2022 C-USA Championships in Texarkana, Texas. It was the first individual medalist for the Men's Golf program since 2007.\nAll of those events seemed to occur so long ago to me, it's remarkable to remember they all happened in 2022! Perhaps that feeling is buoyed by the amount of change MTSU's athletic facilities have experienced over the summer into the new school year in the fall.\nIt all started with the glass replacement at the Murphy Center, replacing the building's original glass with new Smart Glass from SageGlass, a process that started during the 2021-22 basketball season with completion prior to the 2022-23 season tipping off. The auto tinting features of the Smart Glass have completely changed the way a mid-afternoon game plays on the court in the Monte Hale/Jimmy Earle Arena.\nThe court itself was also resurfaced, giving it a new look for the 50th anniversary season in the Glass House. One that continues to get rave reviews months later as clips of games matriculated online.\nBut most exciting was the start of construction on the new outdoor tennis complex, which broke ground on September 15 and has slowly made progress over the rest of the year. It will be a great on-campus home for Men's and Women's Tennis programs, providing a championship atmosphere for matches and a world-class practice facility for the teams to access after class every day.\nApproval was given for the Student Athlete Performance Center, built into Floyd Stadium where the current weight room is located, with groundbreaking scheduled in early 2023 (January 19th, to be exact!), continuing the progress the Build Blue campaign helped create in 2022.\nOf course, no 2022 MTSU Athletics recap would be complete without the \"butt kickin'\" the Blue Raiders gave the Miami Hurricanes in Hard Rock Stadium this September, putting Middle Tennessee on a national stage. It's easy for us directly involved with MTSU to celebrate the 45-31 win, the Blue Raiders' first against an opponent ranked in that week's AP Poll. But I suspect the ramifications of the upset will linger in the minds of many folks who might not have a connection to our school. I know I certainly got a lot more texts from folks I hadn't talked to in a while that week!\nOf course, that win wouldn't have mattered as much had the football program not ended the season strongly, winning their last four games, including the Hawai'i Bowl, to earn back-to-back bowl wins for the first time in program history. It was a season with goals still to be attained, no question, but one that sets a foundation to build on for the future.\nAt the end of this year, that's what lingers with me about 2022 in Middle Tennessee. So much of what was done helped position the Blue Raiders for their future. There were highlights, no question. Stories that will be told for generations to come, accomplishments to be found decades from now by whoever is working in athletic communications in the basement of the Muphy Center (or maybe the second floor, if the offices get rearranged).\nAbove all else, foundations were built. I can't wait to see what builds up from that as the progress continues in 2023.\nGetting myself into that mindset this past week as I remembered the year that was in Murfreesboro has been tougher than I thought for that very reason.
