  "body_text": "Manchester United retain a huge advantage that could potentially help them secure the services of Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite before the current month ends.\nBranthwaite is believed to be United’s number one target to reinforce the defensive department. More than a week ago, the Red Devils lodged a bid for the player, which was swiftly rejected by Everton.\nUnited’s offer was worth around a fixed fee of £35 million plus a further £8 million in add-ons. Everton considered the proposal derisory and are holding out for a sum in excess of £70 million. On their part, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have made it clear that they have no intention of forking out that kind of money for Branthwaite.\nThe 20-time English champions have asked Everton to name a realistic price and if this doesn’t happen, United will walk away from the deal and pursue alternative targets.\nA recent report covered by The Peoples Person relayed that Everton are growing increasingly confident that they will be able to hold on to Branthwaite amidst United’s dithering to open their chequebook.\nHowever, it’s still not a foregone conclusion that United will miss out on the England international and in fact, Erik ten Hag’s side may even land the player in the next few days. This is because of Everton’s financial troubles and their need to ensure they’re compliant with the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules by June 30th.\nNo top-flight outfit has suffered the effects of PSR more than Everton, who were hit with two points deductions in the same season due to financial breaches.\nEverton are also currently in the middle of a takeover with the current owner Farhad Moshiri having reportedly agreed a deal with US billionaire Dan Friedkin. American-based firm 777 Partners were the favourites to assume control of the Toffees but their bid eventually fell apart.\nThe future appears positive for Everton fans but in the meantime, the club needs to ensure they’re in line with PSR before the current financial year ends on June 30.\nWhat happens between now and June 30 will effectively determine whether Everton will face further punishment next term – an unfathomable situation for the team.\nThe Liverpool Echo says on this, “PSR, which will be replaced by a squad cost ratio rule similar to the one that UEFA have in place after the end of the coming season, permits clubs to lose a maximum of £105m over three years. Clubs have a certain amount of allowable deductions that they can add in, with losses attributable to investment into infrastructure, the academy, the women’s team, or community activity, all able to be written off against the £105m limit.”\n“The impact of the pandemic was also an allowable deduction, but that drops off the three-year assessment period for the forthcoming PSR consideration. Everton’s heavy losses in recent years have been well documented. The actual loss for 2021/22 stood at £38m, with it rising to £89.1m for the 2022/23 accounting period. That means a combined loss of around £127m for the two years.”\n“Everton would require a financial year of £61m in losses or under in order to remain PSR compliant without the need to sell. But given that losses are estimated to be a little higher than that figure, there is likely to be the need to player trade before June 30, although the club is in a stronger position than may have been anticipated by some.”\nEverton’s most saleable asset and his sale before June 30th – considering his minimal book value – would solve most of the club’s financial woes.\nThis is where United comes in. United are largely expected to make a second and improved bid for the 21-year-old centre-back. Considering Everton’s predicament and their need to desperately raise cash, they may find themselves in a situation where their hands are tied and they will have no choice but to do business with United.\nAnother player Everton are braced to receive offers for is midfielder Amadou Onana. The Belgian has also been linked to United as a potential replacement for the declining Casemiro. Everton value Onana at £50m.\nIn recent days, Everton are one of three Premier League teams who have been spending money on each other’s young and untested players before the season accounting deadline of June 30. As pointed out by journalist Colin Millar below, all three clubs can record immediate profit of sale while spreading out expenditure of outgoings in several instalments.\nThree Premier League clubs spending big money on each other's untested youth players before season accounting deadline of June 30.
