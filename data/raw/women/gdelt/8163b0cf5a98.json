We owed it and worked hard at it and today that dream is achieved. This is an inspiration to every African girl that if you dream it, you can achieve it. It doesn’t matter where you are coming from. I come from a humble home and here I am a product of grace achieving greatness.”\nThe goal was to win the tenth WAFCON title to solidify Nigeria’s place in history and they did in blood and tears, giving everything to bringing home the new coveted trophy and the improved $1milion winners’ cheque.\nThe 25-year-old said the triumph wouldn’t have been possible if the girls haven’t dreamt and played like one. “This is a victory for all. We dreamt and played like one. It is a victory for all Nigerian girls and all Nigerians. Together, we can achieve success.”\nTears of Joy\nNicknamed ‘Mummy GO’ by his colleagues, Ajibade is also inspired to reach for the heavens by his strong faith in God.\nAfter leading Super Falcons to qualify for the final and adjudged the Woman of the Match against Banyana Banyana, the girl from Mushin broke down in tears of joy savoring the moment. She later took to the social media to credit fans, her teammates and Jesus for the victory.\nNigeria beat South Africa 2-1 in the 12th Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) played at the LarbiZaouli Stadium in Casablanca, Morocco\nAjibade scored the opening goal for the Super Falcons in the encounter, which is her first of the tournament\nIn a post on X, the former FC Robo star said her performance during the match can be attributed to the collective effort of the team.\nShe acknowledged the efforts of the fans who cheered the team to victory since the beginning of the WAFCON tournament in Morocco. She said:\n“I don’t deserve it, to be honest, but God’s grace found me. All of this Woman of the Match, I dedicate it to my teammates; this is teamwork and not about me carrying this award, but team effort and the fans roaring.\n“We couldn’t have done it on our own and with strength, but all glory to God. Thank God, thank Jesus Christ for his grace and mercies.”\nPrayer Warrior\nA leader on and off the pitch, Ajibade is not only the skipper but also the prayer warrior.\nMichelle Alozie, the team’s strong defender and winner of the winning goal against South Africa wrote on X after the semi-final clash. “Our mummy GO.\nI remember when she said ‘let’s pray’ after the first 45 minutes. God bless the captain. We trust your leadership.”\nCaptain fantastic in every aspect, Ajibade has been instrumental in inspiring the Super Falcons to a historic achievement – winning 10 of 13 editions.\nFrom the opening whistle to the final game, she stood tall even when the odds looked like they were against her. Just like the leader that she is, she displayed her relentlessness and embraced the moment and never looked back.\nWhen she was invited to the photoshoot with the new WAFCON trophy prior to the start of the tournament at the iconic Hassan II Tower, she looked at it and promised herself that Nigeria would lift this beautiful crown. It is that will to gather her troops every time that they walked onto the field that led her to this moment – the moment where Nigeria once again, conquered Africa.\nFrom strength to strength\nVocal on and off the field, Ajibade has shown her quality every time that she has stepped onto the field of play. The blue-haired girl from Lagos poured her heart into this campaign, often seen urging her teammates to stay locked in even if it helps that they are already motivated.\nWhen her team needed a spark, she lit it. In whatever role she was assigned, she scanned for spaces occasionally, made passes in the tightest of angles and kept Nigeria’s opponents guessing.\nShe exploited the athleticism of her team in ways that came face-to-face with the weaknesses of their opponents and with that, she dictated the tempo of each game.\nShe earned three Woman of the Match Awards against Botswana, Zambia and South Africa while finding the back of the net once – a penalty against South Africa’s Andile Dlamini who was yet to score until that point. This is the second time that Ajibade is being awarded at the WAFCON after she walked away with the Joint Top Scorer Award at the 2022 edition – tied with Ghizlane Chebbak of Morocco and South Africa’s Hildah Magaia.\nLegacy attained\nFor Ajibade, two WAFCON titles in the bag and a silver medal on top of the individual awards, this is the stuff of dreams. The stage was set in Morocco and this time, the Nigerians achieved their revenge. The Atlas Lionesses had stunned the Super Falcons in the semifinals three years ago (5-4 penalties; 1-1) after the latter went down by two players.\nAs Ajibade received her award inside the Olympic Stadium in Rabat, emotional after this achievement, she appreciated the recognition. An inspiration to many a girl in Africa and the world, Ajibade continues to write her own chapter in a sea of success at home and abroad.\nRead Also: WAFCON 2024: Ajibade, Alozie, Nnadozie, Okoronkwo named in Best XI\n“These are the kind of games we want to play,” Ajibade said with firm conviction after the match.\n“Getting to the semifinal shows the effort the team put into every game. We try to improve ourselves in each match. We might have issues behind the scene, but we don’t let that get to us, we do our job. We are doing this for those girls aspiring to be here one day.”\nCaptain fantastic\nIn the midst of superstars, Ajibade was entrusted with the captain’s band due to her commitment and leadership ability.\n“Rasheedat has done well for the team so far,” Madugu told Cafonline.com after his team defeated South Africa in the semi-final.\n“This accounted for her making the Team of the Group Stage and winning two Woman of the Match awards in four games. She has been carrying the team along with her energy and exemplary leadership on the field of play.”\nHe added that her selection as captain wasn’t a coincidence but a deliberate act based on observable leadership attributes.\n“Yes, we saw the leadership qualities in her—her commitment, relationship with the players and the commanding, encouraging, and inspiring role she plays on the field,” he explained. “Some persons are born with innate leadership qualities which when recognized early can be exploited. We were inspired by those qualities and felt she could hold the team together.”\nFrom Skating to football\nBefore taking to football professionally, Ajibade was a skater and later conquered the streets of Lagos and the continent as a freestyle football champion. That fearless spirit carried her through the ranks of FC Robo Queens, where she spent five defining years and served as captain.\nShe’s the fourth product of the Lagos-based Nigeria Women Football League outfit alongside six-time CAF Women’s Player of the Year AsisatOshoala, FolashadeIjamilusi and ShukuratOladipo in the Super Falcons’ WAFCON 2024 squad.\nIt was at Robo that she honed her skills and leadership qualities, impressing her longtime coach and manager Emmanuel Osahon, who remains one of her biggest admirers, noting that she is truly proving her worth on the continental stage.\nHe praised her charisma and all-round contribution as a creative midfielder who effortlessly connects with her teammates, highlighting her leadership and technical abilities. “I am so excited for her and give glory to God. She really proved her worth at this WAFCON. I am impressed,” he told CAFOnline.com.\nReflecting on her development, Osahon recalled Ajibade’s time at FC Robo Queens, where she once captained the side, and how he constantly encouraged his players to aim for the top.\n“At FC Robo Queens, I told them that they can get to the peak of their career. She was the captain of FC Robo Queens for some times. In the Super Falcons team, every player that is FC RoboQueens product are captains,” he remarked. From Robo, she moved to Norway’s Avaldsnes before her most recent stint at Atlético Madrid in Spain, which she has now exited after almost five years, poised for her next adventure.",
