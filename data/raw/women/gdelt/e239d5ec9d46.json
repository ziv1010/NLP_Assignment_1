The lads will wear it for the first time this Sunday as we face Everton at St. James’ Park.\nThe new home kit will be available from 9:00am on Thursday 29 May at the club’s official online shop and all official club retail stores; St. James’ Park, Metro Centre and Fenwick Newcastle.\nTo support the club’s community efforts, Newcastle United will donate £5* from every adult home, away, third, and goalkeeper shirt sold via official channels before the end of August to the Newcastle United Foundation. The funds will directly benefit grassroots and social impact initiatives across the North East.\nThis season’s shirt draws inspiration from a classic northern motif – the shepherd’s check – blending it seamlessly with our historic vertical stripes to create something fresh, and undeniably Newcastle.\nBlack shorts and socks complete the kit, featuring the iconic adidas three-stripes and a clean white NUFC finish. A full-colour club crest sits proudly on the chest, with ‘Howay the Lads’ on the back of the neck – a call to arms that means everything in the stands, the streets, and on the pitch\nWe’re also proud to announce the launch of a dedicated women’s range later this year – arriving just in time for the start of the 2025/26 WSL 2 season. This new collection, featuring a ‘Howay the Lasses’ sign-off, is a celebration of our commitment to the women’s game and to every supporter who wears the badge with pride. It’s another big step in making sure all fans – no matter who they are – feel represented in black and white.\nCrafted with both performance and comfort in mind, the authentic kit is built with cutting-edge fabric to handle every challenge, whilst the replica version features AEROREADY technology – perfect for matchday, away days, or just showing your colours with pride.\nPeter Silverstone, Chief Commercial Officer at Newcastle United, said:\n“This season’s kit launch is about more than just what our players wear on the pitch – it’s about supporting our community. Building on our home kit foundation donation initiative of last year, this year, for every adult home, away and third shirt sold through official club channels before the end of August we’ll be donating £5 to the Newcastle United Foundation. It’s a way for supporters to not only wear the badge, and the beautiful new kits with pride, but to directly contribute to the life-changing work the Foundation does across the region. Together, we’re making a difference – on and off the pitch.”\n* For adult shirts, the donation will be the net of VAT value of £5 of the purchase price, which is £4.17 per shirt.’\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
