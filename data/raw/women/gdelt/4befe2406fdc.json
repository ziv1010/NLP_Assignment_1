Chelsea will be aiming for yet another WSL title, Arsenal will be determined to make up for their disastrous early Champions League exit and the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City and Aston Villa will all be looking to push themselves further up the table this term.\nHere is your guide to the first WSL fixtures of the 2023/24 season.\nAston Villa vs Manchester United\n- Location: Birmingham, England\n- Stadium: Villa Park\n- Date: Sunday 1 October\n- Kick-off Time: 12:30 BST / 07:30 ET / 04:30 PT\n- Referee: Rebecca Welch\nMan Utd finished just two points off WSL winners Chelsea last season, winning 18 of their 22 matches. The Red Devils will want to push the Blues all the way again this campaign, but have lost a number of key players in the transfer window.\nWhile they managed to keep hold of Mary Earps, the likes of Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle have departed, leaving Marc Skinner with some question marks ahead of the new season.\nAston Villa finished fifth last year and perhaps pose the greatest threat to last season's top four, with 2022/23 WSL top scorer Rachel Daly still at the club. It promises to be an exciting opener to the new campaign.\nEverton vs Brighton & Hove Albion\n- Location: Liverpool, England\n- Stadium: Walton Hall Park\n- Date: Sunday 1 October\n- Kick-off Time: 13:00 BST / 08:00 ET / 05:00 PT\n- Referee: Kirsty Dowle\nBrighton managed to avoid relegation from the WSL last season, finishing 11th and five points above Reading. While newly-promoted Bristol City will be the favourites for the drop, the Seagulls cannot afford any complacency.\nWhile not the toughest opening day fixture, a trip to Merseyside to face Everton will still be a tough test for Melissa Phillips' side.\nEverton finished mid-table last campaign, accumulating 30 points from a possible 66, and will be hopeful of pushing the likes of Aston Villa slightly further this season. The Toffees have lost both of their pre-season friendlies, however, with high-scoring defeats to Man City and Leicester City a concern.\nBristol City vs Leicester City\n- Location: Bristol, England\n- Stadium: Ashton Gate\n- Date: Sunday 1 October\n- Kick-off Time: 14:00 BST / 09:00 ET / 06:00 PT\n- Referee: Jane Simms\nThis could prove an incredibly early relegation six-pointer in this season's WSL, with newly-promoted Bristol hosting Leicester.\nThe Foxes managed a sensational turnaround last season to ensure their WSL survival, with manager WIllie Kirk guiding them to safety after his arrival in November. Leicester's top-flight status was only secured on the final day of the campaign, but nine new summer signings could give the Midlands side some impetus heading into the start of the season.\nBristol have spent two seasons out of the top division, with their first game on their return potentially a good indicator of how far they have come. A win against Leicester would put them in a strong position on the opening weekend.\nArsenal vs Liverpool\n- Location: London, England\n- Stadium: Emirates Stadium\n- Date: Sunday 1 October\n- Kick-off Time: 14:00 BST / 09:00 ET / 06:00 PT\n- Referee: Emily Heaslip\nJonas Eidevall will demand a reaction from his Arsenal players this weekend following the Gunners' disastrous exit from the Champions League in the qualifying rounds. Paris FC knocked out last season's third-placed WSL side, who now have to firmly focus on the league.\nThe good news for Arsenal is that Beth Mead may earn her first minutes in a red shirt since her season-ending ACL injury, albeit they will likely come from the bench.\nLiverpool's coach Matt Beard has just signed a new contract with the club and will want to celebrate with a positive result in north London. However, the Reds will be significant underdogs for their WSL opener.\nWest Ham United vs Manchester City\n- Location: London, England\n- Stadium: Chigwell Construction Stadium,\n- Date: Sunday 1 October\n- Kick-off Time: 15:00 BST / 10:00 ET / 07:00 PT\n- Referee: Abi Byrne\nHaving missed out on European qualification last season on goal difference alone, Man City have a point to prove this year. Gareth Taylor's side will be clear favourites for their trip to London, with the Sky Blues putting seven past West Ham across both games last campaign.\nMan City had a quiet transfer window, but will be happy with the acquisition of Wolfsburg midfielder Jill Roord. Hayley Raso could be a big miss for Taylor, however, following her move to Real Madrid.\nRehanne Skinner will be hopeful of getting her tenure off to a flying start on Sunday having taken over from Paul Konchesky this summer, but West Ham will have to be at their best to get anything from the game.\nChelsea vs Tottenham\n- Location: London, England\n- Stadium: Stamford Bridge\n- Date: Sunday 1 October\n- Kick-off Time: 17:30 BST / 12:30 ET / 09:30 PT\n- Referee: Cheryl Foster\nThe defending champions have a London derby to get their teeth stuck into this Sunday and they will want to avoid a surprise defeat like they suffered on the opening day against Liverpool last season.\nThe likes of Sam Kerr, Guro Reiten and new captain Millie Bright will want to get off to a fast start, especially considering Chelsea lost both Magdalena Eriksson and Pernille Harder in the summer. While the duo will prove a big miss for the Blues, they should have more than enough expeirence and quality to cope without them.\nTottenham have likely been written off for this clash already, and perhaps justifiably so given they lost all three encounters with Chelsea last season. This is not the kind of game that will prove definitive in Spurs' season given the gulf in quality, but they will want to put in a respectable performance regardless.",
