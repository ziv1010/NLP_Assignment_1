Stop trying to make out you want a private life.\n'How many friends do you want to blame?\n'It's come back to me what horrific things you have been calling my son. (Words I wouldn't wish to repeat because I wouldn't want it out there for him to read when he's older).'\nShe finished the post by saying: 'Just remember what goes around comes around.'\nThe stance appeared to be a show of solidarity to Rebekah, who is involved in a row with Annie after accusing her of 'playing the victim' earlier this week.\nThe wife of Jamie Vardy, 41, branded Annie, 30, a 'doormat' and accused her of deflecting attention as her husband Kyle Walker, 32, is facing a police probe after allegedly flashing and kissing another woman in a Vodka Revolution bar.\nAnnie was reportedly annoyed at Becky, thinking she made a pointed barb in relation to her post breaking her silence on her marriage drama. Annie's original post read: 'I think it's important to remember that no matter how good you are to people, it won't make them good to you.'\nBecky had written on Instagram: 'The gift that keeps on giving' but later said the post was nothing about Annie, who is 'obsessed' with her.\nUploading a response, a furious Becky wrote: 'Waking up this morning to my name being associated with this delightful story in yet another opportunity to attack me!\nMarriage: The model shares three children with Walker, who she first met when they were both in their teens\nLow-key: Annie went makeup free during the outing, showing off her natural beauty, while scraping her raven tresses back into a ponytail\nCasual: Annie bundled up in a blue padded coat which she wore over a black top and skin-tight leggings\nTense: It comes after Annie's husband was seen apparently pulling down his trousers in the venue, believed to be in Wilmslow, Cheshire, during 90 minutes of alleged lewd behaviour on Sunday\n'Stop igniting the flame': Lauryn Goodman has weighed in on the current feud between close friend Rebekah Vardy and Annie Kilner, the wife of her former flame Kyle Walker\n'Funny though isn't it that it's my name she wants to use rather than the people actually laughing at her for being a doormat.\n'Art of deflection to a T… great at playing the victim is our Annie.\n'I think she needs to focus with what's going on in her own life instead of trying to attack me by bringing me into her drama (laughing emoji).\n'Believe me had it been about her I would have tagged her! She's obsessed… I'm literally tired of being nice to people with short memories.\n'I've stayed silent while she's bashed me in the media made lies up about me in her little community like a group of playground bullies! Just leave me alone.'\nBecky accompanied the post by Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal, with the lyrics: 'Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?'\nPals close to Annie told The Sun the WAG is 'furious Becky is dragging her name through the mud'.\nThey said: 'She's always disliked but now she despises her and doesn't care who knows it. Annie has kept a dignified silence but Becky mocking her as a ''victim'' has made her see red.\n'Annie is furious that someone like Becky has had the audacity to run her down in public like this. She has kept a dignified silence throughout and now Becky has come out swinging.\n'Calling Annie a 'doormat' and the rest of her vitriol is the straw that has broken the camel's back. She thinks Becky is just using her attention because, as Annie says, Becky thrives off the limelight.'\nMailOnline has contacted Becky's representative for comment.\nAnnie previously defended Coleen Rooney in Vardy's famous Wagatha Christie legal battle .\nThe WAG weighed in on the war between Rooney and Vardy in 2020 and said Becky wanted to be 'the next Victoria Beckham' who 'enjoys the limelight'.\nAnnie, who is friends with Coleen Rooney, was dragged into the Wagatha libel trial between her and Becky in 2022.\nDuring her High Court legal battle, Becky said that Annie was behind a posed photo at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Annie did not comment publicly at the time.\nBecky's fury comes after the brunette beauty shared a cryptic message on her Instagram about the drama surrounding her marriage, after Man City star Kyle allegedly flashed and kissed another woman in a Vodka Revolution bar.\nThe £150,000-a-week England star was seen apparently pulling down his trousers in the venue, believed to be in Wilmslow, Cheshire, during 90 minutes of alleged lewd behaviour on Sunday.\nFurious: Rebekah has ignited another WAG feud as she hit out at Kyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner in an impassioned post on Instagram and Thursday\nAnnoyed: 'I think she needs to focus with what's going on in her own life instead of trying to attack me by bringing me into her drama (laughing emoji)', Becky wrote\nWAG war: Annie was reportedly annoyed at Becky thinking she made a pointed barb after her post: 'I think it's important to remember that no matter how good you are to people, it won't make them good to you'\nNot long afterwards, on Monday evening, Annie shared the post with her thousands of followers which read: 'I think it's important to remember that no matter how good you are to people, it won't make them good to you.'\nThe model shares three children with Walker, who she first met when they were both in their teens.\nCheshire Police on Thursday confirmed it is investigating Walker for alleged indecent exposure - but MailOnline understands that Manchester City believe Walker has not broken any club rules and deem it a private matter.\nKyle is training as usual before the Premier League champions travel to face Crystal Palace in London on Saturday.\nA police spokesman said: 'On Wednesday March 8, Cheshire police were made aware of a video circulating on social media in relation to an indecent exposure which allegedly occurred in the Wilmslow area.\n'Enquiries in relation to the incident are in the early stages and no arrests have been made at this time.'\nThe Sun reports that the woman he appears to touch on the breasts and kiss is not his wife because the woman in the CCTV is blonde and Ms Kilner has brown hair.\nMailOnline has asked Manchester City, Mr Walker's agent and Greater Manchester Police to comment.\nThe Sun published footage of the incidents.\nThe Manchester City defender, 32, appears to grind behind the woman while at the Manchester venue, which he arrived at with male friends at 5.20pm on Sunday after they had some drinks.\nRevellers on a night out were reportedly shocked by the horrific behaviour which went on for around 90 minutes until 7pm.\nWalker reported on time for Manchester City training on Tuesday morning before controversial footage of a night out hit the headlines.\nCity's players were given two days off following the weekend victory over Newcastle United, with many of the squad travelling abroad for short breaks.\nWalker remained in the North West and was back in training with Pep Guardiola's squad before they travel to face Crystal Palace on Saturday.\nThe drunken footballer appeared to drop his tracksuit bottoms and reveal himself near drinkers in the bar in footage seen by The Sun.\nIn response, one of the two women in his group screamed and pointed as Walker laughed with a friend.\nThe England and Man City football star then appears to expose himself again after just a few minutes - and only a few feet away from two other women sitting in a booth at the bar, according to the Sun's report.\nHe is then said to have walked over to shake their hands and say hello.\nMore videos from the night seem to show him 'pawing' at one of his female friends' breasts and kissing her. His wife was not in any of the footage seen by the Sun.\nFootball: Walker was seen back in training with City on Thursday before their match against Crystal Palace on Saturday\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured",
