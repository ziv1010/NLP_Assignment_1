The Blues were originally down to travel to Leicester the following day with the match due to start at 3pm.\nThe games have been switched “after consultation with Sky Sports, the BBC and the clubs involved” with a number of matches set to broadcast as the season comes to an end with promotion, play-off and relegation issues all still possibly up in the air by that time.\nMeanwhile, fans are reminded that Town’s home match against Reading, scheduled for Tuesday 8th March, could be postponed if the Royals draw their FA Cup fifth round tie against Everton at Goodison Park on Tuesday 1st March. If a replay is required it would be played on day of the Town game.\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nMoving 12 matches in one go should be done at the beginning of the season !\nThen again I don't know why anyone is surprised - they gave up considering people who actually GO TO THE GAMES years ago.\nThis is the problem with bringing women to football, they're so bloody organised. If i had it my way we wouldn't have been booking our train tickets until we got the the station in the morning.\nBloody women and football league.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
