  "body_text": "ITV announces major changes as Lorraine slashed in schedule shake-up with GMB, This Morning and Loose Women\nITV has announced big changes to the scheduling and production of its daytime shows\nITV has announced changes to the scheduling and production of its daytime shows, which includes Lorraine Kelly's self-titled show being slashed.\nFrom January 2026, Good Morning Britain will be extended by 30 minutes to run from 6am to 9.30am daily, and will transfer to be produced by ITV News at ITN at their base at Gray’s Inn Road in London.\nGMB will be made by a dedicated team within ITV News at ITN. According to The broadcast, the change will see ITV bring all its national news gathering into one hub.\nThey say GMB will benefit from the journalistic and production resources already in place for national news bulletins, for the website and for digital platforms including ITVX.\nMeanwhile, Lorraine, This Morning and Loose Women will continue to be produced by ITV Studios and will be broadcast from a new location in central London.\nITV Studios is set to consult with its Daytime teams about a proposal that from 2026 would see the three editorially distinct shows produced by one team sharing resources and operations.\nITV says that the efficiencies gained from the changes in the production of these shows will be reinvested in other genres while ensuring viewers will continue to see all of the live, topical Daytime shows they know and love.\nThe changes will help to fund additional investment in dramas, like Mr Bates vs The Post Office, and in coverage of the biggest sporting events, like next year’s football World Cup as well as the UK’s biggest reality and entertainment shows.\nKevin Lygo, Managing Director of ITV’s Media and Entertainment Division, explained the changes: \"Daytime is a really important part of what we do, and these scheduling and production changes will enable us to continue to deliver a schedule providing viewers with the news, debate and discussion they love from the presenters they know and trust as well generating savings which will allow us to reinvest across the programme budget in other genres.\n\"These changes also allow us to consolidate our news operations and expand our national, international and regional news output and to build upon our proud history of trusted journalism at a time when our viewers need accurate, unbiased news coverage more than ever.\"\nIn ITV’s 2026 Daytime schedule, Lorraine will run from 9.30am to 10am, on a seasonal basis for 30 weeks of the year, which aligns with the lead Daytime presenters who host their shows around a seasonal pattern rather than throughout the year. During the weeks Lorraine is not on air, Good Morning Britain will run from 6am to 10am.\nThis Morning will remain in its 10am-12.30pm slot on weekdays throughout the year, while Loose Women will be in the 12.30-1.30pm slot, again on a seasonal basis for 30 weeks of the year - the schedule it occupied for over a decade until 2016.\nKevin Lygo added: \"I recognise that our plans will have an impact on staff off screen in our Daytime production teams, and we will work with ITV Studios and ITN as they manage these changes to produce the shows differently from next year, and support them through this transition.\n\"Daytime has been a core element of ITV’s schedule for over 40 years and these changes will set ITV up to continue to bring viewers award-winning news, views and discussion as we enter our eighth decade.”\nAccording to ITV, the expanded Good Morning Britain will continue its mix of news, interviews, debate and competitions while \"allowing for the inclusion of more regional news, more agenda-setting investigations and exclusives and more reporting on and analysis of the biggest stories of the day around the UK and the world.\"\nFollowing the 30 minute expansion of ITV’s early evening news in 2022, ITV will have provided a 20% increase in scheduled national and regional news each week day.\nThe change will form part of a renewed agreement between ITV and ITN, for ITN to produce national, international, London and digital news for ITV for the next five years, with options to extend.",
