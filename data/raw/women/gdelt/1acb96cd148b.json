M.E.N chief reporter Neal Keeling reports on their journey\nOn a slightly overcast August morning, club volunteer, and \"the slowest left winger in history\", Ivan Cooper, is crouched painting the perimeter walls of a football pitch white. On the pristine turf, groundsman Billy Quarmby is ensuring the surface is immaculate for the new season.\nInside a hut, five yards from the pitch, I am talking to Paul Hilton, the chairman of Radcliffe FC, formed in 1949 as Radcliffe Borough. Expectations are high that the men's team will win promotion from the Northern Premier League to the National League North, and they have got off to a storming start.\nWhatever the men's team achieve, the 2023/24 season is already historic. At 7.45pm on August 23rd, another team graced the drizzle-drenched grass at the club's Neuven Stadium. It was Radcliffe FC Women - the first ever women's side to represent the town. In a tough home baptism and their second game of the season they lost 4-1 to a strong Mancunian Unity in front of 310 spectators. A few days earlier they had beaten arch rivals Fleetwood 2-0 - just hours after the Lionesses' charge for glory ended in pain against Spain.\nThe arrival of a women's football at the club has been achieved through Hilton's four-year quest - and is an indirect consequence of Bury FC's triumphant return to Gigg Lane.\nIn 2019 Bury FC was expelled from the English Football League following financial collapse. But its women side, Bury FC Women's Foundation, stepped into the ground the men vacated, Gigg Lane, and would go from strength to strength - achieving back-to-back promotions in the last two seasons.\nMeanwhile, the men's team would re-emerge as phoenix side, Bury AFC. The new outfit acquired Gigg Lane as their home ground, which meant Bury FC Women's Foundation had to return to playing home games at Goshen Sports Centre.\nIn addition, Bury AFC, as part of their rebirth, started a new women's side, Bury AFC Women. To complicate matters further, the new Bury AFC Women's team was allowed by the FA to change their name to Bury FC Women, just as the associated men's side have reclaimed the historic name.\nThis meant Bury FC Women's Foundation had to find a new identity - and a new ground. But, in the confusion Hilton saw an opportunity.\nHe had become chairman of Radcliffe FC in 2016 and, since 2019, had wanted to bring women's football to the stadium. He twice opened negotiations with two existing women's teams in the north west for such a move, but those proposals came to nothing. Then, finally, the stars aligned.\n\"If you are involved in local football like me you know that Bury FC Foundation is a major women's football team in the town, and has been for 20 years, It is a well known organisation,\" he said. \"The rebranding of Bury AFC to Bury FC - both their men and women's sides - created an anomaly, there was already a Bury FC Women's Foundation side which ended up having their name taken away by accident almost.\n\"Being in the area I know a lot of people who knew each other and got told of some stress in the organisation. I said 'well, lets have a conversation'. People didn't know that I had been wanting to bring women's football to Radcliffe for years and I just had everything on pause - the desire never went away.\"\nThe upshot of a conversation between Hilton and Diana Golding, chair of Bury FC Foundation, was a new identity and new start for Bury FC Women's Foundation. Their first and second team became Radcliffe FC Women after Hilton and Golding used their clout and know-how to navigate FA protocol and managed to land the name change after the normal deadline.\nNow playing in the North West Women's Division One North, Hilton sees the delayed arrival of women's football at the club as a blessing. \"We want to take it as far as we can. The point is now the team has an identity, a platform, we can try and take them into the women's national league. The good thing about women's football is that it is blossoming. We have got involved so we can be part of that revolution. We currently find ourselves in tier six of the women's game - that is a good place to build from.\n\"The one thing we can deliver for the women, is, whereas before they were involved in a predominantly grassroots organization, now they are involved in a professional organisation in terms of them being under our wing.\"\nThe women's set up will also benefit from two nurseries for up and coming players wanting to break into the senior side. Girls currently playing for Radcliffe Juniors and Bury FC Foundation teams will have the chance to follow a path to Radcliffe FC Women.\nHilton's passion is authentic. Aged 42 he has been involved in local football for 25 years. A goalkeeper, he played for Bury FC youth team, and Radcliffe Juniors, and men's teams before injury curtailed his playing in his early 20s. He then switched to football administration and \"randomly\" one day walked into the then Radcliffe Borough in 2015 - whose chairman at the time was Bernard Manning Junior.\nHe discovered a club rooted in the doldrums. Each season was spent hovering just above relegation and only \"sixty blokes and a dog\" were watching the games. Six months later Hilton became chairman as Manning indicated he wanted step down. The club now average 750 spectators for each home game and is three promotions away from the Football League.\n\"I knew I could drive the club forward. We had a semi-professional team not doing that well and a community of 40,000 people - you have to try and embrace the community. It is the reason I came through the door in the first place - it was about building progression. If you don't identify with the younger element of your town your fanbase will die off, \" said Hilton, an IT manager for Manchester-based holiday company, On The Beach.\nHe has dropped \"Borough\" from the club's name. \"Radcliffe has not been a Borough since 1974 - it wasn't a relevant name anymore.\" The club badge is no longer an expired coat of arms, but includes town landmarks - St Thomas's Church and the Mount Zion waterwheel. A bird and the sun represent \"new beginnings\".\nWomen's football is integral to the modern club he wants to create. He has ordered new women's cut kits, and the team will have their own physiotherapist. But it is what Hilton and his staff have already achieved at the club which suggests the women's team could be at the dawn of an epic journey.\nWhen he took over seven years ago the club had no senior men's squad and no manager - and just two players. His first real act as chairman was to make entrance for all under 16s free \"to arrest the issue of a small, ageing fanbase\". That policy remains today.\nPaul Hilton spent 18 months rebuilding the club infrastructure internally – getting the finances settled and improving the ground. He brought in junior football. In 2018/19 the men's team won promotion. During covid, seasons were cancelled but improvements were made to the sports bar and kitchens. High profile signings have been made, yet season ticket prices held at pre-pandemic costs in view of the cost of living crisis.\nLast season, the team missed out on the playoffs on the last day of season, but achieved the highest placed finish in the club's history. The club now has a men's first team; Under 21s; Under 18s; fifty junior teams; veterans team; women's first team; women's development; girls' junior football (through Bury FC Foundation); women's vets walking football; and deaf football.\nIn mid-September, work will start on a £2.5m training complex on Redbank field, opposite the stadium, financed by the Football Foundation, Lancashire FA and Bury Council. At the weekend the men's team beat FC United 5-0, and broke a stadium record for attendance with a crowd of 2,338. \"Ultimately – we are now a strong club on very strong foundations, growing as a whole organisation,\" said Hilton.\nLuke Haughey, one of Radcliffe FC Women's three coaches, said: \"I believe this is definitely an opportunity for the team to flourish and move forwards. It's fantastic and refreshing to be part of a club which the fans are the heartbeat of, with togetherness and unity.\n\"It has given the players across our whole women's provision a sense of fire and hunger to be part of such an amazing club. The club have backed us and supported us in many ways and the players want to repay that back to the club and the fans who have openly welcomed the players immediately. The transition to Radcliffe FC isn't something that happened over night, it has been a long and extensive process with several club members for months and we got it done.\n\"Although it's our first season in this league since 2019, our aims are to go into every game with the intention to win. This is a very competitive league with some experienced opponents and the players know that they have to give everything individually and as a squad.\n\"We have grown some long established relationships with Bury FC across the years in which they have supported us in several ways, however, in football things are ever changing. When one door closes, a bigger one opens. The players are ecstatic to be given the opportunity to call the Neuven their home stadium and we hope to bring some success over the next few years\"\nDiana Golding, chair of Bury FC Foundation, said: \"We had to do what is right for the women and what gives them the best opportunities to progress. The conversation with Paul at Radcliffe came at the right time and we were both open to how it could work. As a result we got the best outcome.\n\"Our new era as Radcliffe FC Women builds on what we have already created at Bury FC Foundation. It allows our women's teams to continue to develop, climb the women's pyramid and experience the fantastic facilities at the Neuven Stadium.\n\"This in turn is now backed by a strong female player pathway with the Foundation offering opportunities for girls to play football from age 3 years all the way through to adult and being able to watch the senior players at Radcliffe will continue to inspire generations to come.\n\"Two women's teams are now backed in the same way as the men's teams at Radcliffe FC and the work that has been undertaken at the club is remarkable. We all have the same aspirations and ambitions going forward, which can only lead to further success on and off the pitch.\"\nOn Wednesday the women's team suffered a chastening 7-0 defeat away to a talented, aggressive, and pacey Haslingden side. It was an education. After two successful seasons they now require resilence and a fighting spirit as well as flair. The team are on a tough road to progress - but, crucially, they are on it.",
