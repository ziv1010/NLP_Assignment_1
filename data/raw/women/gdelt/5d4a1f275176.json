  "body_text": "STATE COLLEGE – Penn State director of athletics Pat Kraft said Tuesday that the temporary seats above the west stands at Beaver Stadium are “good to go.”\nMany Nittany Lions fans have expressed concern about the safety of the seats after seeing photos and videos of the three sections. Kraft tried to allay their worries at a press conference.\n“The structure is safe,” he said. “It’s been looked at. It’s been inspected. L&I (licensing and inspection) has to approve any construction process. They’ve signed off. We’re in that building and off and running. We’re good to go.\n“They’re awesome seats. The view is spectacular from there. I get that there has been a lot of fanfare around that. Before and after every game, it will continue to be inspected. We don’t just throw things up and leave them there.”\nKraft said the west-side temporary seating was installed by InProduction, which is the largest provider of temporary seating and structure in the United States. Its clients include the PGA Tour, Formula One, Women’s Tennis Association, NASCAR and the Kentucky Derby.\nIts college football clients include Florida State, Northwestern and Hawaii.\nThe temporary seating has been inspected by an engineering firm, InProduction and an independent third party, Kraft said.\nPenn State opens its season against Nevada Aug. 30 at Beaver Stadium.\n“We are ready to go,” he said. “It was very important to me and our team that we did not want anything to get in the way of the greatest environment in all of sports.”\nPenn State began the $700 million Beaver Stadium renovation project last year. Kraft said it remains on schedule and under budget. It is expected to be completed before the 2027 season.\n“I think we’re in the second quarter,” he said. “We’re really in a good spot. … I’m really, really happy with where we are.”\nKraft said the official capacity for the 2025 season will be 106,304, a few hundred under the former capacity of 106,572. Penn State has sold 94,000 season tickets. Only a “handful” of single-game tickets remain, he said.\nPenn State also has added temporary seating on the concourse at the northeast and southeast corners of the stadium.\n“Our fans who have sat on the west side for a long time have been incredible,” he said. “It’s a testament to Penn State and the people we are. That’s hard. They’ve been sitting in those seats (a long time). I’d say 99% of the people have been really understanding.\n“I cannot express enough how great our fans have been.”",
