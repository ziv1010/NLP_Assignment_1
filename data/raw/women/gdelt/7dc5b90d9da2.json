She shares her experience with concussion to emphasise the importance of listening to your body and seeking professional medical care following a concussion.\nYou can’t see the injury, but you know the symptoms are there.\nThat’s the scary thing about concussion, said Football Fern Indiah-Paige Riley.\nIt’s your brain and it takes time to recover.\nThe attacker has had five concussions in the past six years; the most recent at the end of last year.\nIt took Riley two months to recover.\n“It’s not like an ankle injury where you can kind of push your recovery along,” said Riley.\n“It’s your brain and you can’t muck around with your brain.\n“You need that to live, to function daily.”\nWhen people think of concussion in sport, they often think of close-contact sports like rugby union or rugby league, but it is an issue in football as well.\nIn 2024, ACC accepted 50 football related concussion injuries in the Bay of Plenty region. In 2025, up until June 16, ACC accepted 24 football related concussion injuries in the Bay of Plenty region.\nNationally, ACC accepted 1221 football related concussions which came at a cost of $3.4 million to help people recover.\nACC paid out 11,386 days of weekly compensation to people for football-related concussions, which cost $1.4 million.\nOne of the main causes of concussion in football is heading the ball, said Riley.\n“This is scary because it happens so often in football, and you have to do it so often.”\nFootball Fern Indiah-Paige Riley is hoping to help Crystal Palace get back to the top tier of the Women’s Super League in England.

I was so scared and thought ‘oh no, not again’.\n“Luckily I was fine, but you just have to be so careful.”\nRiley has a big career ahead of her for club and country. She has played 29 internationals for the Ferns and scored seven goals. It was a scary feeling to have ongoing concussion symptoms.\n“I have a lot I still want to achieve so it has freaked me out a bit. I try not to worry about it and any time I have symptoms I manage them well and put my wellbeing first.”\nThe Ferns have performed well of late – defeating Costa Rica in a two-match series and beating Venezuela in their latest game in June. Riley is excited about what the team can achieve under new coach Michael Mayne.\n“The main thing he is stressing is buy-in from the players,” she says.\n“It’s a long road to the World Cup [in 2027] and he has been talking about being all-in so we can understand each other and the style of play he wants to implement.”\nNew Zealand's Indiah-Paige Riley, Grace Jale and Jacqueline Hand before the Oceania qualifier against Samoa, in Samoa in 2024.

The partnership has a focus on improving concussion management.\n“The investment into this partnership will deliver important resources. It will help ensure there is clarity on how to manage concussion in football and put player welfare first.\n“We are trying to change the culture around concussion in sport.”\nRiley said it’s important for young players to install good habits early when it comes to recognising and reporting concussion.\n“The younger that people get that support the more beneficial it will be,” said Riley. “I never really understood how serious they were, and I’ve had so many now.”\nRiley’s advice to anyone experiencing concussion symptoms is to trust their body and seek professional medical care.\n“Listen to how you feel. It’s not something to rush, or to push, because they are so serious and they can be really dangerous if you don’t treat them right.\n“Be honest and report your symptoms if you feel like anything is not quite right.”\nNational Concussion Guidelines\nThe guidelines present an opportunity to improve the health outcomes and wellbeing for people who play community sport by introducing a standardised approach to managing concussion.\nThe key changes are: (1) When a player suffers a concussion, they must be symptom-free for 14 days post-injury before a graduated return to play. (2) They must complete a minimum period of 21 days away from full competition before clearance to return. (3) Medical clearance must be obtained prior to return to play.\nThe Four Rs of Concussion Management\nRecognise (the signs and symptoms of concussion)\nRemove (the person from play)\nRefer (to a medical doctor to confirm diagnosis and provide treatment)\nRecover (before returning to school/work and sport)\nFor more information visit:National Concussion Guidelines",
