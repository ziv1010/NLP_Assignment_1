That was very much not the case in the early decades of British television. Programmes were often treated as fleeting stage productions rather than archival objects, and when recordings were made, tapes were often wiped or film reels junked, leaving frustrating gaps in our cultural memory.\nEarlier this month I spent a day at Derby Quad which is devoted to Nigel Kneale’s pioneering Quatermass stories, and spoke to actor, writer and comedian Toby Hadoke. This newsletter is about the enduring appeal of seeking out these lost fragments in time, why certain programmes still cast such a long shadow, and why our chances of recovering missing episodes may now be running out. But first, here are the headlines.\nFive big stories\n-\nUkraine | EU leaders have pledged a €90bn loan for Ukraine to meet urgent financial needs, but failed to agree on the preferred option for many of securing that loan against Russia’s frozen assets in the bloc.\n-\nUK news | Boys as young as 11 who show misogynistic behaviour will be taught the difference between pornography and real relationships, as part of a multimillion pound investment to tackle misogyny in English schools.\n-\nUK news | The Bank of England has cut interest rates to 3.75%, giving a pre-Christmas boost to the UK’s struggling economy.\n-\nUS news | Democrats have released a new batch of photos from the estate of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, among them photographs of what appear to be lines from Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Lolita written on different parts of a woman’s body.\n-\nSport | A full-throated “Rory roar” reverberated around MediaCity in Salford as Rory McIlroy became the first golfer in 36 years to win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award – and tie a bow on a year for the ages.\nIn-depth: Inside the search for the TV that time forgot\nWhen I arrived at the Quatermass event, I immediately spotted Doctor Who scarves and Hitchhiker’s Guide T-shirts, and knew I was with my people. It was the kind of event where you might bump into someone who co-wrote one of your favourite cult comedies in the toilets – I did – or notice a raffle winner whose voice you recognise from sci-fi audio dramas you’ve bought.\nToby Hadoke writes lovingly researched obituaries of cult TV and film figures, and is a stalwart of the extra features that appear on the Doctor Who releases. He is also among the leading experts on Nigel Kneale and Quatermass, which he has just published a book about (pictured below being signed by Toby at the event).\n“Television back then went out once, then it was gone. That’s part of why these stories still haunt us,” Toby says.\nWhy do some ‘missing’ television programmes continue to have currency?\nBefore Toby ever saw a frame of Quatermass, the series had an almost mythical quality. “My parents’ generation talked about it in hallowed terms,” he says – scarcity seemed to give it “the innate power of a sacred relic.”\nDiscovering old TV in his youth was “a kind of archaeology”. You might glimpse a late-night repeat or find a fuzzy VHS to watch when everyone else had gone to bed. That effort, he says, gave the experience a romance that instant access can’t replicate. “I don’t envy young people who have it all at the touch of a button – part of the magic was in the hunt.”\nFor his book, Toby unearthed dozens of previously unseen production photos, expanding the visual record of those missing episodes far beyond the handful known for decades.\nWhy don’t we have a complete TV archive?\nThe final four episodes of the original Quatermass Experiment were never recorded after a technical fault during episode two. But many other shows were deliberately wiped. Videotape was expensive, storage was limited and there was no home media market to anticipate.\nProbably the most prominent example of this, and the one closest to my own heart, is Doctor Who – with 97 episodes missing from the William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton years – but Top of the Pops, Dad’s Army, The Likely Lads, Hancock’s Half Hour, The Avengers and many more items of cultural significance all have incomplete preservation. “Television wasn’t seen as something with future value,” Toby says.\nAre people still looking to find things and rediscover lost TV?\nYes – but in a different way to the meticulous archive searches of the 80s and 90s. Toby says the most active effort now comes from Film Is Fabulous, a volunteer network created not as a treasure hunt, but as a last-ditch safeguard. Their aim is to intercept film collections at risk of being thrown away when collectors die or downsize.\nRecently unearthed, for example, was a nine-minute BBC recording from an internal directors’ course – never intended for broadcast, but a fascinating insight into how the corporation worked. And several missing episodes of ITV’s Emergency Ward 10 have recently resurfaced, while the BFI’s annual Missing Believed Wiped day continues to showcase new recoveries.\nAs Toby puts it, “a collector might see a rusty film can as a curiosity; an archivist sees ‘the only surviving copy of something’.”\nWhy is there a race against time to preserve this heritage?\nPrivate film collecting, Toby says, “is very much an old man’s game”. Many collectors are now dying without leaving instructions about what they own. A family clearing a house might keep an antique cabinet – “but a rusty film can in the corner means nothing to you if you don’t know what it is”.\nComplicating matters, collectors often weren’t TV experts. They liked the mechanics of projection and the thrill of “swapping reels like Panini stickers”. Some ended up with missing episodes purely by accident. “The difference between an episode of Z-Cars the BBC retains and one it doesn’t isn’t obvious if you’re not into Z-Cars,” Toby says. “And that’s how things end up in a shed for 50 years – or in a skip.”\n“Film has to be carefully stored, and it ages,” he adds. “If it has survived 50 years, it might not survive a whole lot longer unless it’s in professional facilities.”\nWould we make these mistakes again?\nPreservation in the digital era isn’t straightforward either. Last year Jason Okundaye wrote movingly about trying to track down an episode of The Black Bag, a 1990s Channel 4 documentary about Dennis Carney, a Black gay man living in Brixton. He eventually paid £100 to digitise Carney’s personal VHS copy because no archival version could be found.\nRights issues can block access, too: several early Doctor Who stories exist, but remain unavailable on iPlayer due to unresolved agreements with the estates of deceased writers.\nAnd some shows simply vanish because tastes change. Two series of the early-2000s bleakly satirical animation Monkey Dust have never had a commercial release or streaming run.\nEven digital formats are fragile. When I visited the BBC’s Windmill Road archive in 2004, they were already grappling with the looming obsolescence of D3 tape – the format chosen in the 1990s to preserve older stock.\nEchoes of transmission\nAt Derby I spoke to a 78-year-old man called Ken, who remembered watching The Quatermass Experiment when it was first broadcast in 1953, and wanted to come and see it again on the big screen. He told me: “It wasn’t just about the horrors or the scares, it was about the way that Kneale wanted to broaden the way that people – and the BBC itself – thought with those Quatermass stories.”\nThe science fiction dream is that in the future people will find a way to travel faster than light, and find all these old TV signals bouncing faintly around the cosmos. “I think that would be a wonderful inspiration to go to the stars,” Toby says. “I went into outer space, and all I came back with was television.”\nWhat else we’ve been reading\n-\nIt doesn’t have as many jokes as one of my quizzes, but the King William’s College quiz has appeared in the Guardian since 1951. Here is this year’s edition. You have until 13 January to complete it. Martin\n-\nI enjoyed this wry take, by Emma Brockes, on how many big names have paid the price for their association with Jeffrey Epstein. You can probably guess the answer. Karen\n-\nThom Waite writes for Dazed asking, with the internet “hacking our limbic system better than ever”, was 2025 the year of peak ragebait? I’ll go out on a limb. No. 2026 will be worse. Martin\n-\nPhoebe Weston looks into the depths of Lake Geneva, to examine how millions of quagga mussels, among the planet’s most potent invasive species, have altered it for ever. Karen\n-\nAt one point I had to ban Overcooked 2 in our household because it sparked too many angry shouts of “You’re burning the rice!”. Usually at me.

Martin\nSport\nCricket | Australia shut down England’s attempted fightback as they moved into a commanding lead on day three of the third Ashes Test in Adelaide. Travis Head was leading the way, with England’s energy waning in the field.\nFootball | Crystal Palace missed a chance to advance directly to the Conference League round of 16 when it was held to a 2-2 draw with Finnish club KuPS on Thursday.\nFootball | Saudi Arabia’s 2034 World Cup preparations have hit delays after several architecture firms were asked to resubmit stadium designs, with sources telling the Guardian initial plans were rejected for being too expensive.\nSomething for the weekend\nOur critics’ roundup of the best things to watch, read, play and listen to right now\nTV\nFallout season two | ★★★★☆\nThe west doesn’t get much wilder than in Fallout. The show takes place 200 years into a post-nuclear apocalypse where most humans are scratching out an existence in a stricken wasteland California of sand dunes, outlaw gangs and mutated monsters. Resources are scarce. Life is cruel. Death is a constant. It should be terrifying. Instead, it’s often hilarious. A wicked sense of humour elevated the first season of Prime Video’s well-received, no-expense-spared adaptation of the long-running video game franchise. Flashes of satirical glee give it an edge over gloomier post-apocalyptic shows such as The Walking Dead or The Last of Us, and season two adds excellent guest spots from Justin Theroux, Kumail Nanjiani and Macaulay Culkin. Graeme Virtue\nFilm\nHong Kong Mixtape | ★★★☆☆\nDotted with towering corporate skyscrapers, the skyline of Hong Kong attests to its global reputation as a financial hub; this image is profoundly challenged by San San F. Young’s passionate documentary. Turning her camera to the streets and taking us into artists’ studios, the film-maker captures the vibrant creative scene of the city. The turmoil of the protests against the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill, along with the draconian laws that followed, hangs heavy over every frame. In the midst of political turbulence, art emerges as a powerful, transformative tool of collective resistance. In an engaging and personable voiceover, Young weaves in stories from her own life growing up in Hong Kong as a rebellious teenager. Her youthful disenchantment only makes Hong Kong Mixtape more moving as a hybrid of autobiography and documentary. Phuong Le\nTheatre\nIndian Ink at Hampstead theatre | ★★★★☆\nIndian Ink grew from a radio play, its title In the Native State a very Stoppardian pun encompassing both the painting of nudes and the regions of British India permitted some self-government – both pivotal to the story. It has deep notes of grief and love, which Jonathan Kent’s production sounds perfectly from a cast in which Gavi Singh Chera is powerful as Das, who can love an Englishwoman but not the British. Irvine Iqbal smoothly doubles Indian leaders of two periods and Donald Sage Mackay’s Pike amusingly pops up all around the auditorium, putting his footnotes in it. Ruby Ashbourne Serkis is amusing and moving as Flora, doomed with literary and sexual sensibilities ahead of her times, but the core draw is Felicity Kendal, the Flora on Radio 3 and in the 1995 stage premiere, who graduates to Mrs Swan (played previously by Peggy Ashcroft and Margaret Tyzack.) Mark Lawson\nGames\nSimogo Legacy Collection: PC, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2; Simogo | ★★★★★\nSimogo Legacy Collection represents the Swedish indie studio’s first seven games, released across its first five years for iPhone and iPad from 2010 to 2015. Like all of the studio’s work, this anthology of games is smartly designed, its contents arranged on a homescreen made to look like a smartphone’s – except, you know, full of wonderful little games and not horrid social media apps. And oh, these games remain remarkable, all these years later. The brief, heady days of App Store brilliance are over; the world that allowed Simogo to flourish is now extinct. How fortunate it was that Simogo got the chance they did; that they’re still with us, and able to assemble this inspiring little collection we can play in perpetuity. These games, in all their varied playfulness, are full of longing: for a lover, for meaning, for a chance to write your own ending. Play them and dream about a world where it all went differently.

She, and many others, dealt with everyday sexism, discrimination and prejudice on an “unbelievable scale” from colleagues.\nThen, Brayfield found her own way of reporting on developments in the women’s liberation movement, setting up interviews with radical feminists and other big hitters. Joining the pressure group Women in Media, she challenged sexism in the industry and beyond, and played a key role in the campaign for equal pay and opportunities, and outlawing sex-based discrimination. This generation of second-wave feminists are somewhat overlooked, but this article shares the stories of Brayfield, and the many women like her.\nSign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday\nBored at work?\nAnd finally, the Guardian’s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day.
