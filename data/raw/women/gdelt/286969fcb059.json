  "body_text": "To celebrate St Andrew's Day, we've taken a look back at some of the greatest players to represent both Scotland and Arsenal down the years.\nFrom classy captains to double winners, we're taking a dip into the history books to mark the annual celebration in style!\nFrank McLintock\nFrank joined us from Leicester City in 1964 and went on to have a legendary nine years in north London.\nNamed captain in 1968, Frank guided us to our first European trophy a season later, winning the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup by beating Anderlecht in the final.\nA season on would be the Scottish international's crowning moment, helping us to the double with a league title and FA Cup triumph over Liverpool. His incredible campaign saw him win the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year award for 1971.\nKim Little\nKim Little's impact on Arsenal knows no limits. Joining us for an initial five-year stint from 2008-2013, Kim returned to north London in 2017 and hasn't looked back.\nWith more than 300 appearances across two spells in N5, our skipper has picked up an incredible 16 honours, including last season's Women's Champions League.\nLittle, who has 140 caps for Scotland to her name, has featured in four WSL Teams of the Year, most recently in 2024/25, as well as winning individual awards, including PFA Women's Players' Player of the Year in 2013 and FA Women's Player of the Year in 2010.\nBob Wilson\nThe former keeper's affiliation with the club stretches back to 1963, encompassing 308 appearances, nearly three decades as a coach, and charity and community work.\nCapped twice for Scotland, Wilson's playing career at Arsenal saw him win the double in 1970/71 alongside McLintock, winning the league at White Hart Lane for the first time in our history.\nHis memorable campaign in 1970/71 saw Bob named Arsenal Player of the Season. His final season at the club came in 1974, marking 11 remarkable years between the sticks.\nCharlie Nicholas\nThe Scottish international arrived at Highbury in June 1983 to a huge fanfare. Nicholas had hit 50 goals for Celtic the previous season, scooping the Footballer and Young Footballer of the Year awards north of the border. Now the 21-year-old was expected to lift the gloom which was starting to descend on Arsenal after four seasons without silverware.\nNicholas could not bring the trophies that his new fans craved but 'Champagne Charlie' served up enough flair and flamboyance to keep them entertained. Two goals in his second appearance set the tone, and while his time with us only yielded one trophy, his legacy has not been forgotten as he netted twice, including the winner in a 2-1 win over Liverpool in the League Cup final.\nGeorge Graham\nWhile his exploits as our manager in the 1980s and 1990s are fondly remembered, George Graham was also part of a successful Arsenal team during his playing days.\nA man-of-the-match performance in the FA Cup final in 1971 helped form one half of the famous double. Graham went on to make over 300 appearances in Arsenal red and 13 for Scotland.\nGraham then returned as our manager in 1986, where he'd spend a further nine years, winning six major honours including the famous 1989 title at Anfield.\nJen Beattie\nA remarkable 143 caps for Scotland, Jen Beattie enjoyed two magnificent spells at Arsenal.\nJoining us from Celtic in July 2009, Jen's first stint for us lasted four years, during which she won four league titles, two FA Cups and a FA WSL Cup.\nJen then returned in 2019 for a further five years, making over 100 appearances and adding another League Cup to her medal collection.\nKieran Tierney\nVery few Scottish players have turned out for us in Premier League history, but one to do so was Kieran Tierney, who joined us from Celtic in 2019.\nKieran's first season saw him claim the FA Cup in 2020 under Mikel Arteta. KT started as part of a back three alongside David Luiz and Rob Holding as we defeated Chelsea 2-1 at Wembley.\nWhile injuries hampered his time at N5, Kieran signed off in style, netting in his final game for the club in a 2-1 win over Southampton in May 2025. His career at Scotland hit the highest of highs in November 2025 when he netted in injury time against Denmark to send Scotland to the World Cup for the first time since 1998.\nWillie Young\nA towering 6’3” central defender, the red-haired Young began his first-team career at Aberdeen before heading south in 1975 and spending two years playing under Terry Neill at Tottenham. During a feisty north London derby in November 1976, he was dismissed after a hefty challenge on our striker Frank Stapleton.\nWhen former captain Neill joined us as manager in the summer of 1976, he signed Young for £80,000 the following year. The colourful and often outspoken Scot admitted that he had “a massive job on my hands to win over the Arsenal supporters”, but Willie succeeded in his task over the next five years, turning himself into an unlikely Highbury cult hero.\nWillie would go onto make over 200 appearances for us, winning the FA Cup in 1979.\nAlex James\nFamed for his baggy shorts, Alex James opened the scoring in the 1930 FA Cup final to set Arsenal on their way to a first major trophy. He left after another FA Cup win in 1936 and also racked up four titles during his time at Highbury.\nJames played as an inside forward, providing the ammunition for the likes of Cliff Bastin, Ted Drake and David Jack to fill their boots. The Scot's impeccable passing made him the perfect supply line for Herbert Chapman's prolific Arsenal sides. He would cap off his time at the club with four league titles and two FA Cup medals.\nJulie Fleeting\nForward Julie Fleeting enjoyed an eight-year spell with the Gunners, hoovering up titles and accolades in the process.\nIn her first season in 2004, Fleeting scored a hat-trick in the FA Women's Cup Final win over Charlton Athletic, just a day after suffering a calf injury while playing the full game for Scotland and scoring against reigning World Champions Germany.\nBalancing work as a PE teacher in Scotland with her career in north London, Julie started the 2007 UEFA Women's Cup final against Umea, defeating the Swedish side 1-0 to win our first European crown.\nCapped 121 times for Scotland, the forward has a whopping 17 honours to show for her time in north London.\nAlex Forbes\nSigned in March 1948 for a fee of £15,000, Alex Forbes helped us to league glory just months later as we picked up the 1947/48 title, finishing seven points clear of Manchester United and Burnley.\nDundee-born Forbes would play a key role in our FA Cup triumph of 1950, starting at wing-half in a 2-0 win over Liverpool in front of 100,000 at Wembley Stadium. Forbes' final trophy success with us came in 1953 when we finished ahead of Preston North End on goal average to claim the league.\nEmma mitchell\nKirkaldy-born Emma Mitchell joined us from SGS Essen in July 2013 and enjoyed seven years in N5.\nThe left-back was a pillar of consistency, winning the FA Cup in her first season and playing the full 90 minutes in the final against Everton. Having been named in the PFA Team of the Year for 2014/15, Emma then started the 2016 final, helping us keep a clean sheet in a 1-0 victory over Chelsea at Wembley Stadium.\nHer final trophy at Arsenal game in 2018/19, making 11 appearances in our successful title campaign, finishing ahead of Manchester City by seven points.\nEmma, who has made 74 appearances for Scotland, departed us in 2020, having made over 100 appearances across all competitions.\nJimmy Logie\nThe inside forward played 328 times during his career at Highbury after joining from Lochore Welfare for £75 in June 1939.\nEdinburgh-born Logie served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War but returned to first-class football with Arsenal after being demobbed.\nThe attacking midfielder was almost ever-present for the next eight seasons and picked up two Division One winners' medals in 1948 and 1953.\nLogie, a bricklayer by trade, also lifted the 1950 FA Cup, setting up both goals in the 2-0 win over Liverpool.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
