  "body_text": "Kalen DeBoer, “A More Balanced Playing Field Helps Us”\nMany coaches across the country are providing their opinions on revenue sharing and NIL, and how the two are affecting the landscape of college football positively and negatively.\nAccording to Ross Dellenger, Georgia announced its revenue sharing breakdown with 75 percent of the revenue going towards football, 15 percent going toward men's basketball, five percent going toward women's basketball, and five percent to others. Dellenger reports that the Georgia model mirrors the house settlement back pay distribution model.\nOn Thursday, Alabama head coach Kalen DeBoer provided his take on revenue sharing, citing it as a major contributor to help Alabama return to a level of dominance Crimson Tide fans have become accustomed to,\n\"Having a more balanced playing field helps our situation,\" DeBoer said to Pete Nakos of On3 Sports. \"It allows us to get where it was at one point just a few years back. Where recruiting was real recruiting, not just someone who's gonna put in the highest bid.\"\nAlabama finished the 2025 recruiting class as the No. 3 overall class according to 247 Sports Composite. The Crimson Tide signed three five stars. It was Kalen DeBoer's first full recruiting class as the Alabama head coach.\nA fourth five-star, Ty Haywood, was committed to Alabama before flipping to the Michigan Wolverines on national signing day in February. It was reported that NIL played a major factor in Haywood's commitment.\nKalen DeBoer also mentioned to Nakos that he supports a shorter transfer portal window.\n\"Guys know if they're looking to move on and find another opportunity,\" DeBoer said. \"I don't think it takes 30 days to try and figure that out.\"\nRight now, the rules are that players can transfer for 30 days total with the winter and spring transfer portal window. Players can also transfer for 30 days when their head coach leaves a program.\nWyatt Fulton is the Tide 100.9 DME and Brand Manager, primarily covering Alabama Crimson Tide football and men's basketball.
