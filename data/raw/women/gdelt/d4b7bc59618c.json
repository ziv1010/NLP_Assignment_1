Will the momentum gained have been stunted?\nLeicester and Man City met in the Conti Cup just over a fortnight ago, with the Sky Blues needing a last minute winner to edge to a 1-0 victory.\n\"I think that may go against us, as they will not take us lightly,\" Kirk said of the pair's cup clash. \"But that just means we must up our performance. I think we’re capable of doing that.\"\nLeicester vs Man City\nWhen is kick off? Saturday 4 February, 11:30 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played? King Power Stadium\nTV channel/live stream?

Amy Fearn\nCan Brighton get their first WSL win under Jens Scheuer?\nBrighton will be looking to put a bit of daylight between themselves and basement side Leicester when they face Aston Villa on Sunday - the second WSL match under new boss Jens Scheuer.\nThe former Bayern Munich manager's tenure got off to a nightmare start as the Seagulls were beaten 3-0 by relegation rivals Leicester to drag them closer to the drop zone. Scheuer secured his first win as Brighton boss against National League outfit West Brom in the FA Cup last time out, but he remains on the hunt for his maiden WSL victory.\n\"The results are improving,\" he said. \"We are working hard in training and the squad is adapting quickly. We have been together four weeks now and you can see what we are doing well already.\"\nAston Villa vs Brighton\nWhen is kick off? Saturday 4 February, 12:30 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played?

Louise Saunders\nAll eyes on Alessia Russo\nManchester United resisted Arsenal’s multiple world record approaches for Alessia Russo on the final two days of the January transfer window, with Everton this weekend her first outing since then.\nRusso has been such a pivotal figure for United since the early stages of the 2021/22 campaign and is again the team’s top scorer in the WSL this season. To let her go, even with less than six months remaining on her contract and no guarantees of signing a new one, would have massively weakened United at the same time as strengthening a direct top three and title rival.\nAll eyes will be on Russo come Sunday to see what, if any, toll the saga has taken.\nUnited boss Marc Skinner wasn’t involved in the process when the Arsenal bids were coming in, but he spoke to Russo the morning after the transfer deadline that he said was an ‘easy conversation’. From Skinner’s perspective there is no issue with her attitude or questions about being unsettled.\n“We’ve had a really good meeting, really positive. I can’t stress enough that Alessia is the nicest person, the best kid, great attitude, exactly someone we are looking to keep here and keep in negotiations around that. She wants to win here,\" he explained.\n“I can’t speak any higher of her attitude and the way she gets on with her job. We’ve shared a real good moment, she was really positive and she has trained really well.”\nMan Utd vs Everton\nWhen is kick off? Sunday 5 February, 12:00 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played?

Emily Heaslip\nThe (WSL) return of Bethany England\nSunday's clash with Chelsea could be Bethany England's fourth outing since since joining Tottenham from the Blues in January - half of her appearances will have come against her former employers.\nEngland won seven major trophies with Chelsea and was particularly instrumental in their 2019/20 WSL title triumph. But with her playing time reduced and the 2023 World Cup on the horizon, the forward moved to Spurs to help force herself back into Sarina Wiegman's squad. She has netted twice in her three appearances thus far in north London.\n\"She's going to bring goals to that team,\" Emma Hayes said. \"She links well, I think her leadership from the front, her experience being at a team like ours, she'll be bringing a lot to Tottenham's front line and we certainly know the threats she'll pose our defence.\"\nTottenham vs Chelsea\nWhen is kick off?

Abigail Byrne\nHow will Liverpool's forward line shape up?\nLiverpool have been dealt a series of blows in forward areas this term; last season's top scorer Leanne Kiernan suffered an ankle injury on the opening day of the season and is expected to be out until at least March, while marquee summer signing Shanice van de Sanden saw her first half of the campaign disrupted by an Achilles problem.\nThe Dutch international has since suffered a knee injury during the warm up ahead of the WSL fixture that never was between Liverpool and Chelsea, and is set to be sidelined for up to two months.\nLiverpool signed striker Natasha Dowie on deadline day - the second member of Matt Beard's 2013 and 2014 title-winning Liverpool side to rejoin the club this window, following Gemma Bonner's arrival in December.\n\"January's a difficult window - there weren't many forwards that were signed during the window,\" said Beard. \"Natasha's agent contacted us to see if there was any interest and that was on the same day we got the results back on Shanice's scan, so we worked really hard to make it happen. She's had a big impact already and the girls' reaction to her coming back has been fantastic.\"\nLiverpool vs Reading\nWhen is kick off?

Jane Simms\nHow will Arsenal deal with failing to sign a striker in January?\nJonas Eidevall was very public about his hopes of signing a prolific goal scorer throughout the January window, with the Gunners seeing world record bids for Alessia Russo rejected by Manchester United as the window ticked towards the deadline.\nArsenal ultimately failed to add to their forward line, with recalled youngster Gio Queiroz and Stina Blackstenius their only recognised central strikers until the end of the campaign.\n\"I think you can have results, or you can have excuses. I don't think you can have both,\" Eidevall said when quizzed on the impact it could have on the title race. \"And I want to try having results.\"\nWest Ham vs Arsenal\nWhen is kick off?
