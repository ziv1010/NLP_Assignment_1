Another Orlando City match is upon us, and with it comes a chance for the Lions to extend their unbeaten run to five games on the bounce. To do so, they’ll need to equal or better the result they got earlier in the season against the New York Red Bulls in the first game between the two sides, which finished in a 2-2 draw.\nA visit from the Red Bulls means that I spoke to Mark Fishkin, who hosts the always excellent Seeing Red Podcast. As usual, Mark was helpful in bringing us up to speed on how things have gone for the Red Bulls since these two teams last met.\nNew York has been one of the better defensive teams in the league. They’ve only given up seven goals in seven games and have kept two clean sheets. What’s been the key to the good defensive start?\nMark Fishkin: Formation and experience. RBNY has mostly played this season in a 3-4-3 with newcomer and Bundesliga vet Alexander Hack as one of the three centerbacks, and he’s been (mostly) solid. The wingbacks offer a ton of help defending. An in-form Carlos Coronel has single-handedly kept NY in games with quick-reaction saves as well.\nLike Orlando City, the Red Bulls are currently hovering around the midtable of the Eastern Conference with a 3-2-2 record and 11 points. What needs to happen for this team to make the leap from being a good team in the East, to a great one?\nMF: Given both teams are only four points off the top of the East, it’s evident that there’s a ton of quality sides right now for this early in the season. Both teams have points in five of seven games, and without a last-second PK at the Revs, New York would be (slightly) higher. More clinical finishing is needed for the Red Bulls to enter the elite MLS tier.\nAside from the big names of Erik Choupo-Moting and Emil Forsberg, who is a guy that we should have our eyes on come Saturday afternoon?\nMF: Young players Omar Valencia, New York’s Panamanian international left back, who made the MLS Team of the Week bench with stellar defensive play and a game-winning assist, and Serge Ngoma, an RBNY Homegrown winger who is back after 18 months of injuries — who headed in Valencia’s cross last week to beat Chicago. On a team that added experience in the off-season, these young players delivered a jolt into the New York attack.\nWill any players be unavailable due to injury, suspension, etc.? What is your projected starting XI and score prediction?\nMF: Lewis Morgan continues to rehab from knee surgery, but if RBNY plays in a 4-2-2-2, the lineup could look like:\nCarlos Coronel; Dylan Nealis, Noah Eile, Tim Parker, Omar Valencia; Felipe Carballo, Daniel Edelman; Serge Ngoma, Emil Forsberg; Erik Choupo-Moting, Mohammed Sofo.\nThe Red Bulls have played to the level of their opponents for a month now. Saturday afternoon is no different. Another 2-2 draw is in order.\nThank you to Mark for helping us get caught up on the Red Bulls. Vamos Orlando!\nOpinion\nLikes and Dislikes from the Fifth Week of Orlando City Preseason\nLet’s examine some good and some bad from this week of Orlando City’s preseason preparations.\nWe’ve (almost) made it to the end of another week, with Orlando City’s final preseason match against the Colorado Rapids looming large Saturday night. The season opener will be here before you know it, and things will only speed up from there. For the final time this preseason, let’s take a look back at the week that was and talk about what I liked, and what I didn’t.\nLikes\nA New Signing\nOrlando City announced the long-awaited signing of Brazilian center back Iago on Saturday, making him the third and presumably final MLS U22 Initiative arrival of the off-season. While he’s only 20 years old, he’s likely to be one of the two starting center backs on opening day alongside David Brekalo, so him getting a couple weeks of preseason to get settled in is vital. It of course would have been ideal for him to have even more time, but transfer dealings with Brazilian clubs rarely seem to be straightforward affairs, and two weeks is better than none at all. Crucially, Iago played over 5,000 minutes for Flamengo’s senior and U-20 sides, so he’s no stranger to the professional game, and hopefully that helps him to hit the ground running as a Lion.\nA New Kit\nContinuing the trend of shiny new things, the Lions unveiled their new away kit on Tuesday. It’s a gold jersey with purple shorts that’s been dubbed the ‘Sunken Treasure’ kit, and it’s the club’s first jersey to heavily use the team’s secondary color of gold. All things considered, I quite like the new threads. As with a lot of jerseys these days, the finer details like the Lion in the background of the front and the two patches, won’t be visible unless you’re up close to it. That being said, those details look pretty nice in the close-up shots of the jersey that the club provided, and when viewed from a distance, the shirt is striking. I also like the decision to go with purple shorts, as I think going with gold all the way would be a bit too much.\nDislikes\nAll Quiet on the Rumor Front\nThings have gone a little quiet when it comes to transfer rumors regarding Orlando City. The club still has a Designated Player slot that it intends to use on an attacker, but we haven’t seen any hints as far as who the brass might be looking at. It’s not necessarily a reason to panic, as the team has made it a habit to be methodical in the transfer window and hasn’t been afraid to take its time pursuing players it thinks will be the right fit, rather than rushing business and potentially making an unwise signing as a result. All the same, it’s always nice to hear that a specific name is being pursued, particularly when OCSC still has a DP slot burning a hole in its proverbial pocket in addition to some areas of the field that need to be strengthened with additional depth. I trust the business to get done and done well, but I’m also not going to pretend I wouldn’t love a juicy signing rumor or two right about now.\nWith a little luck, next week will bring a couple of positive transfer rumors and three points to start the season off on a strong note. Vamos Orlando!\nLion Links\nLion Links: 2/13/26\nHannah Anderson challenging herself in Orlando, Luana called up by Brazil, broadcasting changes ahead of MLS season, and more.\nToday is Friday the 13th, so make sure to steer clear of black cats, ladders, and any other bad omens out there. Orlando City’s season opener is next weekend and the last thing we need to do is accumulate bad luck before the Lions take the field. Let’s keep our fingers crossed and dive into today’s links!\nHannah Anderson Prepares for First Season in Orlando\nDefender Hannah Anderson was drafted by the Chicago Stars in the third round of the 2024 NWSL Draft and spent two seasons there before the Pride traded for her in January for $70,000 in intraleague funds. Chicago conceded twice as many goals as Orlando last season, and now Anderson is challenging herself with an opportunity to improve as a defender with the Pride.\n“I don’t really look at it as pressure, I think it’s an opportunity,” she said. “The challenge is what’s going to help me grow. When you’re never challenged, you can’t grow. It’s kind of like how you see that challenge. Yeah, it could be pressure, but I also think it’s exciting to be a part of a group that’s been there, because the experience will help you get there again.”\nThe 24-year-old also spoke on what it’s like to go up against Orlando’s attacking stars in training, as well as her decision to join the Pride while engaged to Chicago Cubs pitcher Jack Neely. With Emily Sams on the other side of the country, hopefully Anderson can have a breakout year to help fill the void.\nLuana Returns to Brazil National Team\nOrlando Pride midfielder Luana was called up for Brazil’s friendlies against Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Mexico in a few weeks. It’s great to see her back with the national team after all she’s been through and Head Coach Arthur Elias spoke on her return.\n“Calling up Luana is a joy, but the greater joy was when she overcame cancer, a disease diagnosed during a period with the National Team. It was a huge shock for all of us. Luana has an incredible history in football, she is a woman of great strength, who showed this and set many examples for those around her,” he celebrated.\nShe will bring some experience to a Brazil roster that doesn’t include any other Pride players, although former Pride player Adriana was called up. Brazil has already secured qualification for the 2027 Women’s World Cup as its host, so the focus will be on playing quality opponents until then.\nGetting Ready for More MLS on Apple TV\nWe’re gearing up for the fourth MLS season streamed through Apple TV and the biggest difference this time around is that MLS Season Pass is a thing of the past. It’s a major boon for fans, as all games will be through an Apple TV subscription rather than a separate platform at an additional cost. For those of us who like to watch MLS games at our favorite bar, an agreement with EverPass Media should increase the reach of the league in commercial venues. Saturday night matches with increased production value, announcers returning to the actual stadiums to call games, and the removal of the Spanish version of MLS 360 are some of the other notable changes heading into this season.\nNottingham Forest Fires Manager…Again\nJust a day after Thomas Franks was fired by Tottenham, Nottingham Forest sacked Sean Dyche following the club’s scoreless draw with Wolverhampton this week. Dyche joined the club in October and was just nominated for Manager of the Month for his team’s results in January. However, Forest is just three points above the relegation zone and has now fired its third coach of the season. Vitor Pereira will reportedly replace Dyche as the club’s fourth coach of the season, which would be a league record. ESPN dove into how English Premier League teams that made multiple firings in the same season performed and it’s grim news for Forest.\nFree Kicks\n- Orlando City goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau went under the microscope to field a variety of questions. I’m pretty interested in why Duncan McGuire would be the first person he’d call if he found a dead body in his hotel room.\n- Construction is underway at Camping World Stadium as it begins its $400 million renovation to expand seating and improve the facilities.\n- Atletico Madrid put Barcelona to the sword in the first leg of their Copa del Rey semifinal, winning 4-0 thanks to four goals in the first half.\n- Raheem Sterling has joined Feyenoord as a free agent after a mutual agreement with Chelsea to terminate his contract last season.\n- The draw for the UEFA Nations League was completed and Spain was drawn into a group with England, Croatia, and the Czech Republic.\nThat’s all I have for you on this fine Friday. I hope you all have a lucky day and that all of your Valentine’s Day plans this weekend go off without a hitch!\nOrlando City\nRanking Orlando City’s MLS Away Kits\nWhere does the new Sunken Treasure kit rank all time?\nWith the release of Orlando City’s newest away kit, I thought it appropriate to rank all of the Lions’ MLS-era away kits to see how the new “Sunken Treasure” kit stacks up against those from the past. As I said last year regarding the home kit rankings, I’m no fashion guru, but I do know what I like.\nI welcome everyone’s opinions on this topic, but since I’m writing the article, I get final say. Let’s rank Orlando City’s away kits.\nSeventh Place\nThe Heart and Soul kit has the misfortune of coming in last place in the rankings. It is not a bad or ugly kit, I just think the others are better. For me, it’s the stark shoulder separation that I don’t like. It feels disjointed, like the color on the front was an add-on or that someone forgot to extend it up to the rest of the kit. While I don’t mind the three stripes being oriented front to back on just one side, I like the more traditional two-sided Adidas stripes formation.\nSixth Place\nThe look of the second-ever away kit was so close to being fantastic. First the good. The purple sleeves look great, especially with the gold ring near the cuff. And seeing the original Orlando Health logo certainly brings back memories. Now the not so good. I always prefer to have the Adidas stripes on the shoulder, though they’re not horrible running down the sides. The faux collar is the downfall of this kit. If it had a real collar it would be much higher up the rankings.\nFifth Place\nThe Sunshine Kit brought the first splash of color other than purple to the away kit. The way it blended into — or more accurately out of — the purple shorts looked very good. It also didn’t have the cutoff shoulder feel of the Heart and Soul kit. In fact, we get the traditional stripes with a ringer around the collar. It’s a nice touch.\nFourth Place\nThere is definitely something to be said about an almost completely white kit. The Origin Kit was so clean that it only needed two colors. Even the crest is monochromatic purple rather than the usual gold, purple, and white. Purple-accented Adidas stripes, cuff rings and a thin ringer at the V-neck are the only splashes of color to be found. It’s the type of kit you can wear out to a nice dinner. Just don’t order the spaghetti.\nThird Place\nYou never forget your first…away kit. The amount of thought that went into the Inaugural City kit is impressive. It is seemingly simple and straightforward but full of little details. I love the overlapping collar with just a bit of gold. The Adidas stripes in the proper place and the original Orlando Health logo make this the classic it deserves to be. It might be at third place in the rankings, but it will always be the first.\nSecond Place\nThe new Sunken Treasure kit is striking. It is the first kit that uses gold as the primary color. The sublimated lion head is picturesque in detail. The Adidas stripes are in the right place, and the triple stripe at the cuffs and neckline are a nice touch. Paired with the purple shirts, I know that this is going to be a sought-after jersey for years to come. My only personal issue is I don’t look good in yellow. However, as I said on The Mane Land PawedCast, I will reserve final judgment on my potential purchase of the kit until I see it in person. I also want to add that the social media release of the kit was very well done.\nFirst Place\nAs much as I like the new kit, it will be hard to ever top the Legacy Kit. We have the return of the Three Lions crest and the red color from the USL days. The very light purple used as the primary color is subtle, original, and looks really good. I like the three-color combo and button on the collar. The matching shorts bring the whole thing together like The Dude’s rug. This is such a departure from normal away kits that I literally have it framed on my wall.\nThere you have it. As for the kits, I’d love to hear how you rank them in the comments below. For now, you can select the spot where you’d place the Sunken Treasure kit in the poll below.
