It’s taken from then until now to see the potential [in the sport], and a number of different things have allowed that to happen, like the London Olympics in 2012 and the introduction of the Women’s Super League. You can really see the growth of the game now.\nLittle celebrates with Gunners teammates [Jayde Chamberlain/SPP]\n“There are very different elements to the game now, like more media commitments that add to your workload, and matches are shown live on TV. That can add to the pressures, but I see it as a healthy thing, too – to have all these people behind you, supporting you. It’s a very special feeling.”\nPerhaps offering an insight into why the midfield maestro is so mesmerising out on the pitch, Little added: “Football is a form of entertainment, it’s a performance. People are paying to be entertained; for me, that makes you want to play well and put in a good performance, and you want to win.”\nArsenal go into Sunday’s showdown sitting third in the WSL table, three points behind joint leaders Chelsea and Manchester City. With just eight games left to go – including two titanic away days against Chelsea and City – the Gunners know they can ill afford any more slip-ups, like the one they suffered away to Spurs back in December when they lost 1-0 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nLittle said: “It’s a huge game for us, the north London derby is always a must-win. The last one didn’t go our way, we were disappointed that we didn’t make the most of the chances that we created. We know this time we need to be better, it’s really important to win and maintain the form that we’re on.”",
