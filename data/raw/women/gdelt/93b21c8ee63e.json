A Biblical Christmas Song and Video!\nDear friends, A Christmas Choir song and video about the birth of our Lamb and Propitiation, Yeshua Jesus! Gen. 3:15, John 3:16-16, Micah 5:2, Isaiah 7:14; 9:6-7, Matt. 1:21; 1 John 4:7-10 -\nIsraeli Study Reports 100% One-Year Survival Using New -Protocol for Advanced Hodgkin’s - ‘A true revolution in Hodgkin lymphoma care.’\nIsraeli researchers have reported a new treatment for advanced‑stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma (a type of cancer of the white blood cells) that achieved a 100% one‑year overall survival rate in a large cohort of patients participating in their program. Israeli researchers have unveiled an innovative treatment for advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma that they say resulted in a one-year survival rate of 100 per cent, representing a “true revolution” in caring for people with the disease. While traditionally the management of patients with advanced-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma has relied exclusively on chemotherapy, the new treatment combines advanced chemotherapy with targeted biological therapy.... -\nHouse passes bill nullifying Trump’s anti-union EOs\nThe House voted 231-195 on Thursday to pass legislation that would nullify President Trump’s efforts to strip more than 1 million federal workers of their collective bargaining rights, sending the measure over to the Senate, where its prospects are less rosy. Twenty Republican lawmakers broke ranks to support the Protect America’s Workforce Act (H.R. 2550) on the floor. Introduced by Reps. Jared Golden, D-Maine, and Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., the measure effectively nullifies Trump’s March executive order barring unions at more than 40 federal agencies under the guise of national security and bars federal agencies from terminating any union contracts that... -\nWoman who helped build the World Economic Forum’s Great Reset exposes ESG labels we’re all a scam based on nothing to make money\nWoman who helped build the World Economic Forum’s Great Reset exposes ESG labels we’re all a scam based on nothing to make money “They're lying to the public. They've manufactured a climate crisis. It's a multi-trillion dollar industrial complex.” She explains how ESG labels were slapped onto funds with no data, no evidence, and no accountability. Desiree Fixler “In 2020, I got my dream job as the chief sustainability officer at Deutsche Bank. That’s when I saw the fraud, everything was a marketing scam. The bottom line is this: we could not issue this annual report. It was a legal... -\nPolice say person of interest in custody over fatal shooting at Brown University\nRhode Island police say they have a person of interest in custody in connection with the Brown University campus shooting that left two students dead and nine others injured, Fox News has learned.Investigators plan to release more details at a 7 a.m. news conference. -\nAndrew Bolt: It seemed inevitable that the normalising of an insane Jew hatred would have deadly consequences, and here they are (Australia)\nThe war on Jews has spread from Israel to the bloodied sands of Bondi. This is our October 7. So with more than 12 people reportedly murdered in Australia’s worst terrorist attack can we finally stop it with the lies and the evasions? Here’s lie one. Standing on the scene of the carnage, a rabbi reportedly dead, a shocked local councillor was still telling a journalist the area was so wonderfully, peacefully multicultural. That, frankly, is bullshit. Multiculturalism has become a curse. We have become a nation of tribes, and we’ve seen very clearly that one of those tribes includes... -\nTRULY WICKED: Obama Judge Lavishly PRAISES Illegal Alien Who R*ped and Sodomized Helpless Woman with Cerebral Palsy – Refuses to Add More Years to His Sentence\nA wicked judge recently proved that the next step from toxic empathy is pure evil as the third branch of government continues to sabotage the Trump Administration. The Detroit News reported on Friday that a violent illegal alien from Honduras who sexually assaulted a woman with cerebral palsy in a Michigan laundry room will be released from prison as early as July 2028, less than three tears from now thanks to a federal judge appointed by Barack Obama. The illegal, 30-year-old handyman Edys Renan Membreño Díaz was previously caught sneaking into the U.S. at least seven times since 2019. He... -\n2025 HANUKKAH MASSACRE\n2025 HANUKKAH MASSACRE How will they justify it? Has the Australian Jewish community invaded Gaza or taken “innocent lives”? Of course not—because this has never been about Gaza. It has always been about the very existence of the Jewish people—everywhere and at all times. Tonight, we light the first Hanukkah candle and declare with clarity and conviction: Am Yisrael Chai — the people of Israel live. -\n14 December 2025 | News Analysis of video showing a bystander taking out an active shooter\nIncident Analysis (High-Level, Non-Instructional) 1. Nature of the Event The video depicts an active terrorist attack in a civilian environment. A non-uniformed civilian (bystander) responds reactively, not offensively. The action occurs during the attack, not afterward—this is critical for legal and moral context. 2. Use of Environment The bystander uses a vehicle as hard cover, not merely concealment. This indicates instinctive or learned understanding that: Distance and barriers matter Exposure must be minimized before action The car serves as a temporary survivability position, not a pursuit platform. 3. Decision-Making Under Stress The bystander does not flee blindly nor rush... -\nWATCH: Trump Receives Hero’s Welcome at Army-Navy Game, Participates in Coin Toss\nPresident Donald Trump received a hero’s welcome at the Army-Navy football game at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore on Saturday, where he tossed the coin to decide the kickoff.

LOUIS (KTVI) — Budweiser is rewarding adults who have received the COVID-19 vaccine with a free round of beer.

As The Gateway Pundit reported earlier this week, ICE has already begun making arrests in what locals call “Somali-land Minnesota,” a region with one of the largest concentrations of Somali immigrants in the United States. The Gateway Pundit previously reported that during Tuesday’s press conference, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara warned residents that masked individuals detaining people in Somali neighborhoods were “possibly kidnapping people,” urging the city’s enormous Somali enclave to dial 911 if... -\nDilbert Creator Scott Adams Delivers a Heartbreaking Update from the Hospital as He Battles Advanced Prostate Cancer (VIDEO)\nDilbert creator Scott Adams has revealed that his health has taken a turn for the worse, though there is still hope he could recover with the help of doctors. As The Gateway Pundit reported, Adams announced earlier this year he had stage 4 prostate cancer that had metastasized to his bones back in May. “I have the same cancer that Joe Biden has,” Adams said at the time. “I also have prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones. I’ve had it longer than he’s had it – well, longer than admitting that he’s had it, so my life... -\nUpdate: Wounded West Virginia National Guardsman Andrew Wolfe Released From Hospital-Moved to Inpatient Rehab Facility\nOn Saturday morning, The Gateway Pundit reported on the tremendous progress of Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24. Wolfe was patrolling alongside Spec. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, when a gunman opened fire on them. Beckstrom succumbed to her injuries the following day. Last week, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey noted, “His parents report that his head wound is slowly healing and that he’s beginning to ‘look more like himself.’” On Friday, the West Virginia National Guard provided an update on social media, noting that Wolfe is reaching new milestones in his recovery, including being able to breathe on his own. His move... -\nNew Mexico Abortion Clinics Killed One Woman, Injured Over 50 in Botched Abortions\nAbortion Free New Mexico (AFNM) is sounding the alarm as abortion tourism into New Mexico reaches unprecedented levels, driven in large part by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and other state leaders who have aggressively expanded abortion access while dismantling safeguards, oversight, and accountability. As a result, New Mexico has become a national destination for unregulated, high-volume abortions, drawing women and minors from across the country—often without parental knowledge, without medical transparency, and without any meaningful state monitoring to ensure patient safety.

Some are predicting the end of Gov. Tim Walz’s political career, as this went down under his watch, and it’s been revealed that Rep. Ilhan Omar (MN-05) held her campaign victory party in 2018 at a restaurant owned by a man who was convicted in March on 21 counts related to the scandal, including wire fraud, federal programs bribery and money laundering. Not a... -\nThe Wheat and the Tares - Evangelical Caucus/Devotional\n“‘The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away. But when the wheat sprouted and bore grain, then the tares became evident also. The slaves of the landowner came and said to him, “Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?” And he said to them, “An enemy has done this!” The slaves said to him, “Do you want us, then, to go and gather them...\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected!
