Sean Soanes, now 58, was a teenager when he committed the offences in Newcastle in the early 1980s.\nThe victims lived with the consequences of Soanes’ actions for most of their lives and sought the courage to report the assaults to police in 2023. He denied the offences when interviewed by officers and was subsequently charged with six counts of indecent assault on a girl under 14 years and one count of gross indecency with a girl under 14 years - being that the offences occurred before the Sexual Offences Act was introduced in 2003.\nHowever, ahead of the case going to trial, Soanes, of Malvins Road, Blyth, entered a guilty plea for seven offences. He was jailed for four years with a requirement to serve a minimum of 32 months.

Lying on the ground behind a council vehicle, Chalmers was carrying out the dirty deed in plain view. Security staff were sent to the scene at Manors Car Park and when they got there he was still lying on the ground in an exposed state.\nIt was just after 7pm one evening last June that Chalmers was seen by CCTV operators. Neil Pallister, prosecuting, said: \"They saw the defendant lying in Manors car park masturbating, which was clearly seen on the CCTV.\n\"While masturbating, the CCTV shows a number of members of the public entering and leaving the car park, who could easily have seen him. After he stopped masturbating, he continued lying on the ground with his penis exposed until security officers arrived in a van and spoke to him.\"\nThe court heard Chalmers has 74 previous convictions, including being jailed for 102 months in 2015 for sex offences. He was also given a suspended sentence for failing to comply with his sex offender registration requirements last year.\nFor the latest incident, he pleaded guilty to outraging public decency. Having served time in custody on remand, Judge Stephen Earl extended the previous suspended sentence's operational period by six months and imposed an 18 month community order.
