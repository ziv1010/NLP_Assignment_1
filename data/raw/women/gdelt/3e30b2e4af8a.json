Even before last year's realignment, I said we had to be in Vegas and a little more west. This is the entertainment and sports capital of the world right now. It's incredibly important for our brand and business, and we'll continue to explore opportunities to take some of our tent-pole events, championship events, more to the west coast if the opportunity presents itself and if it makes sense.\"\nBig 12 commissioner Brett Yormark on the state of the conference as it expands to 16 teams with additions of Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah:\n— Sean Walker (@ActuallyDSW) July 9, 2024\n\"We're one of the three best conferences in America — and we're getting better.\"\nFull 🎥 https://t.co/UpeP1v7G4Wpic.twitter.com/9lw2pJv4Am\nLas Vegas presents plenty of opportunities for the league, which will be represented by Utah during the Vegas Kickoff Classic against Miami in 2027. The commissioner didn't mention basketball as a landing spot for the league, but he did mention another postseason affiliation with the city.\n\"I'm confident at the right time we will have a formal affiliation with the Las Vegas Bowl,\" Yormark said bluntly. \"This market is critically important. Scott Draper (Big 12 chief football and competition officer) is working on that, but I'm very comfortable and confident in what that outcome will bring for our conference. We need to be here in Vegas for all the right reasons. I said earlier it is the entertainment and sports capital of the world, so critically important marketing for us in the future.\"\nThe third-year commissioner added that additional \"tent-pole\" conference events could be held in the west \"if it makes sense,\" but was quick to stamp down any immediate plans to expand further west.\nObviously, in the world of conference realignment, no doors are permanently shut, but after taking over a 10-team conference in 2022 that swelled to 14 last year and will formally grow to 16 on Aug. 2 despite losing Texas and Oklahoma, Yormark is bullish on the future of his league.\n\"I say this often: We're one of the three best conferences in America, and we're getting better,\" he said. \"Think about where we were just 24 months ago, and think about where we are today. I will not stop until we're the No. 1 conference in America. That's my ambition; I shouldn't have anything but that, but that's the ambition of our conference, of our presidents, of our ADs.\n\"Why would we be doing what we're doing if we don't aspire to be No. 1? But we're continuing to get better, and I like where we're going.\"\nYormark has previously \"doubled down\" on Kansas City, extending the conference's basketball tournament with T-Mobile Arena through 2031 while adding a two-year deal with CPKC Stadium to host the women's soccer championships in 2024 and 2025.\nHe's also bullish on the league's core footprint in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, renovating the league offices in Dallas and extending the conference baseball tournament with GlobeLife Field through 2028.\nThe league also continues to look for new revenue streams, including a potential naming rights sponsor for the conference, new sponsorship and ticketing measures implemented for football and basketball, and potential partnerships with private capital.\nOne stream could include more international games: Kansas State and Iowa State will open the 2025 football season in Ireland, which could signal a move away from portions of the previously announced Big 12 Mexico initiative.\nThat initiative, Yormark added, will focus immediately on women's soccer and baseball. So the league won't be afraid to move around — both geographically and with vaguely hinted \"new television windows\" — to get more eyeballs on its teams.\nAt the same time, Yormark wants moves that make sense — like the additions of Utah to pair with archrival BYU and the Territorial Cup rivalry in Arizona did.\n\"I think rivalries are critically important,\" he said. \"We have a scheduling committee, and they have been focused on the rivalries that mean something, not only to the history of the conference but also to our fans. I think we landed in a great place.\"",
