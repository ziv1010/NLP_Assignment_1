  "body_text": "FC Barcelona defeated Atlético Madrid 2-0 in the 2025 Copa de la Reina final at Estadio de El Alcoraz on Saturday, adding the Spanish women's cup title to their Liga F and Supercopa de España Femenina triumphs. The win completes a domestic treble and marks Barcelona's eleventh Copa de la Reina title.\nDespite limited preparation time following the international break and missing Rolfö due to injury, Barcelona controlled possession and tempo from the opening whistle. Atlético Madrid adopted a defensive posture, keeping most players deep to limit space and frustrate Barcelona’s attacking formation.\nBarcelona believed they had taken the lead in the opening half after a potential own goal, but the play was ruled out as the assist came from a ball delivered out of bounds. The breakthrough came shortly afterward when Clàudia Pina scored from the edge of the box in the 24th minute, continuing her productive campaign.\nPina scores twice to secure Copa de la Reina win\nThe first half closed with a narrow 1-0 lead for Barcelona, with Ewa Pajor narrowly missing a header. Pajor remained active early in the second half, while Atlético threatened with occasional efforts from Ajibade and Gio Queiroz. Barcelona goalkeeper Cata Coll made key interventions to maintain the lead.\nClàudia Pina extended the lead in the 73rd minute, capitalizing on a high defensive clearance. She volleyed the ball past Atlético’s Lola Gallardo from outside the box, securing her 25th goal of the season and second of the final. Pina nearly completed a hat trick but was unable to add a third goal before full-time.\nThe win gives Barcelona their third trophy of the 2024–25 season, reinforcing their dominance in Spanish women’s football. This marks the club’s fourth domestic treble and their continued success in national competitions.\nBarcelona maintain control in final minutes to seal victory\nIn the closing stages, substitutions by head coach Pere Romeu ensured stability and game management. Atlético introduced several late changes but failed to mount a comeback. Barcelona’s defense, led by Irene Paredes and Ingrid Engen, remained solid throughout the match.\nClàudia Pina was the standout performer, contributing both goals and constant attacking threat. The victory confirms Barcelona’s continued superiority within domestic women’s football and adds another title to the club’s expanding trophy cabinet.\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily International News Updates.\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily International News Updates.",
