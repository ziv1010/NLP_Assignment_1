In 2019, she made history as the first female referee to take charge of a Ligue 1 match and in August the same year she was the first to take charge of a major men’s European match. In 2020, she was the first woman to officiate a men’s UEFA Champions League match.\nWelch’s appointment has already drawn praise, with Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino telling reporters that he was “really happy.”\n“Already in France, Stéphanie is a female referee and she is really good,” he said. “And why not, if the capacity is there? I am so happy to see that in football, which people sometimes say is so closed, but I think we open our minds.”\nOn December 26, Sam Allison will become the first Black referee for 15 years to oversee a Premier League match.\n“Sam deserves his chance as well. Maybe that will serve as a role model for other young people who maybe previously thought refereeing might not be for them,” Webb said.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",
