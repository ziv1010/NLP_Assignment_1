(WBRC) - For the first time ever, The Biggest Party of the Summer is a two-night event.\nThe 38th annual SummerSlam, widely seen as WWE’s second biggest event of the year, is set to take place at the home of the New York Jets and Giants, Metlife Stadium, Aug. 2 and 3.\nThis year’s event will see the much anticipated WrestleMania rematch between the WWE Undisputed Champion John Cena and former champion and 2025 King of the Ring Cody Rhodes.\nAfter a months-long hiatus from the company, Rhodes is looking to take back the top spot in WWE.\nMeanwhile, Jelly Roll - yes, THAT Jelly Roll - is set to team with Randy Orton to take on Logan Paul and Drew McEntyre. the attraction of seeing Jelly Roll in a WWE ring is sure to attract even the most casual of fans.\nIn other action, CM Punk will look to capture his first championship since leaving All Elite Wrestling in 2023 when he challenges Gunther for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.\nNaomi will look to secure her place as the top woman on the Raw brand when she defends against Rhea Ripley and Iyo Sky while on the SmackDown side, Jade Cargill looks to end Tiffy Time and knock off the WWE Women’s Champion, Tiffany Stratton.\nPredictions\nWWE Undisputed Championship\nStreet Fight\nCody Rhodes vs. John Cena (c)\nIn a rematch from their widely panned WrestleMania 41 main event, the 2025 King of the Ring Cody Rhodes looks to recapture the WWE Championship. John Cena, amidst his historic 17th world title reign, is still looking to “ruin wrestling” and leave with the title in December.\nAshlee: I’m going to be real with you all, this John Cena heel turn just hasn’t done it for me. With the exception of some of the work with CM Punk leading up to their match in Saudi Arabia, it’s just been lackluster. So Cena has to drop the title to someone and begin his redemption arc before his final show in December. The problem is that Cody Rhodes’ championship run, to me, felt flat as well. Rhodes wins, but not sure what then. Winner: Cody Rhodes\nJonathan: I was one of the few people who didn’t dislike their WrestleMania match-up (sans the inclusion of Travis Scott). However, I can’t say I’m too enthused about this rematch. I believe Cena will drop the title here, but it’s unclear what his road to redemption will look like. I believe Cody does have a chance for a better title run this time around. Winner: Cody Rhodes\nWWE World Heavyweight Championship\nCM Punk vs. Gunther (c)\nCM Punk won a gauntlet match at Legacy Arena in Birmingham - with a little help from Roman Reigns - to secure his spot in this match. Gunther is coming off a career-defining win against Goldberg at Saturday Night’s Main Event, but The Second City Saint is ready to kick off another Summer of Punk at the Biggest Party of the Summer.\nAshlee: This is fun. These two have been working together in dark matches for a while now, presumably building to this match. I think at some point Punk has to get that signature win or else he loses credibility as the “Best In The World.” Plus, Rollins is still sitting on the Money in the Bank briefcase. How great would it be for him to cash in eventually on a champion Punk. Winner: CM Punk\nJonathan: Any time Gunther is in a ring, I know I’m in for a solid match, and those odds go up with the addition of CM Punk. It’s a toss-up for me. While I believe Gunther is an excellent champion, I’d like to see Punk walk out with a title win at the biggest event of the summer. Winner: Toss-up\nWWE Women’s World Championship\nTriple Threat Match\nRhea Ripley vs. Iyo Sky vs. Naomi (c)\nRhea Ripley and Iyo Sky put on an all-time classic at Evolution. And then Naomi used her Money in the Bank briefcase to make tit a triple threat and pinned Sky to win the WWE Women’s World Championship. Raw General Manager Adam Pierce wasted no time is pitting the three women in a rematch for the title in Jew Jersey.\nAshlee: The rivalry between the very different Rhea Ripley and Iyo Sky has turned out to be extremely entertaining, with their match at Evolution stealing the show. Naomi, meanwhile, has nailed it as a heel since turning on Jade Cargill. I don’t think they take the title off Naomi that quickly, unless Cargill or Bianca Belair interfere. Winner: Naomi\nJonathan: Naomi’s cash-in at Evolution was one of my favorite moments of the year. She’s put in the work as a heel and deserves more time as champion. Rhea and Iyo should make the match a showstopper, but expect Naomi to walk out with the title wrapped in caution tape. Winner: Naomi\nWWE Women’s Championship\nJade Cargill vs. Tiffany Stratton (c)\nBy winning the 2025 Queen of the Ring crown in Saudi Arabia, Jade Cargill punched her ticket to SummerSlam to challenge for the WWE Women’s Championship. Tiffany Stratton has overcome all challengers since cashing in her Money In The Bank briefcase against Nia Jax. But, can Tiffy Time survive the storm that is Jade Cargill?\nAshlee: This one is hard. Cargill hasn’t lived up to her hype and I can’t figure out why. She looks like s chiseled goddess and he improved her in-ring since jumping from AEW to WWE, but something just isn’t clicking. I think the timing is as good as ever to see if she can carry the title, especially if she is to continue working with Bianca Belair, leading to a friends-turned-rivals program for the title. Winner: Jade Cargill\nJonathan: Following her win at Queen of the Ring, Jade has the momentum to justify a win here. But Stratton has picked up a big win against legend Trish Stratus at Evolution. This is a push, and I just hope both can showcase their athleticism in the ring while still telling an interesting story. Winner: Tiffany Stratton\nWWE Women’s Intercontinental Championship\nLyra Valkyria vs. Becky Lynch (c)\nSince returning at WrestleMania and subsequently turning on her former friend, Becky Lynch has helped elevate the young WWE Women’s Intercontinental Championship and the former champion, Lyra Valkyria. Valkyria has a chance to recapture her title in New Jersey.\nAshlee: WWE is looking for the biggest opportunity and stage for Valkryia to recapture the Intercontinental Championship and I can’t imagine them putting if off until WrestleMania. I think a huge win for the babyface, but not the end of this rivalry. Winner: Lyra Valkyria\nJonathan: The feud over this title has gone on for a while now. Valkyria is a worthy challenger here, but I don’t see her getting the title back from Becky at this time. Winner: Becky Lynch\nWWE Tag Team Championship\nSix-Pack TLC Match\nThe Street Profits vs. The Motor City Machine Guns vs. #DIY vs. Fraxiom vs. Andrade & Rey Fenix vs. The Wyatt Sicks (c)\nIt’s been 25 years since Edge & Christian, The Dudley Boyz, and the Hardy Boyz competed at the first-ever TLC match at SummerSlam 2000. Now, WWE looks to run it back and make it bigger. The Wyatt Sicks haven’t long been champions. and with a match like this, they may not have long left as champions.\nAshlee: Chaos. That’s my prediction, just chaos. For fans of the old Attitude Era and wrestlers throwing caution to the wind, this should be right up their alley. In the end, this comes down to four teams - #DIY, The Street Profits, MCMG, and the Wyatt Sicks. I feel like between those four, this is a toss up. I’m going to lean the Machine Guns only because the story has been them trying to get the titles back. Winners: The Motor City Machine Guns\nJonathan: I love tag team wrestling, and all of the teams in this fray are capable of putting on a show. I’m still getting over the Street Profits dropping the titles. However, I’m also ready for one of them to get a singles push finally. I’d like to see the Wyatt Sicks retain here; it would be good to have a singular dominant team in the division for others to chase. Winners: The Wyatt Sicks\nWWE Women’s Tag Team Championship\nCharlotte Flair & Alexa Bliss vs. The Judgement Day (Raquel Rodriguez & Roxanne Perez) (c)\nThe unique and unexpected pairing of Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss continues on as the pair look to capture tag team gold after failing to do so at WWE Evolution. But hey, they technically didn’t lose at that event, right? With Liv Morgan still out due to injury, Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez of The Judgement Day continue to dominate the tag team division.\nAshlee: While I think The Judgement Day will continue to reign atop the women’s tag division in the long term, Bliss and Flair will capture the titles - only to lose them back down the road setting the odd pairing to splinter and lead into a feud headed into 2026 and perhaps even WrestleMania 43. Winners: Charlotte Flair & Alexa Bliss\nJonathan: The odd couple of Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss have potential as a tag team, but The Judgement Day’s domination of the tag division should continue here. Winners: The Judgement Day\nWWE Intercontinental Championship\nAJ Styles vs Dominik Mysterio (c)\nIt’s time to throw the doctor’s note out the window as AJ Styles will finally get his hands on Dominik Mysterio one-one-one. The Phenomenal One looks to become a two-time Intercontinental Championship while Mysterio looks to keep the gold in The Judgement Day.\nAshlee: Styles is at that point in his career where he it making younger talent look, well, phenomenal. I don’t know if I see WWE putting the championship on Styles, and with me thinking so other matches going with babyface winners, I think Mysterio leaves New Jersey the same way he came in, as Intercontinental Champion. Winner: Dominik Mysterio\nJonathan: Now that Mysterio is finally cleared, expect AJ to go on the attack. AJ is always a great performer and will surely make this a quality match. I still think Mysterio should hold onto the title for a little longer. Winner: Dirty Dom\nRandy Orton & Jelly Roll vs. Drew McEntyre & Logan Paul\nJelly Roll - yes, that Jelly Roll - will make his in-ring debut in New Jersey when he teams with the Viper Randy Orton to take on Logan Paul and Drew McEntyre. Jelly Roll has gotten physical in recent weeks leading up to SummerSlam\nAshlee: This isn’t up for debate. If I were a girl to bet on things, I’d bet the house. The only question will be how much has Jelly Roll’s training has paid off. Winners: Randy Orton & Jelly Roll\nJonathan: With Randy Orton and Jelly Roll as the “face” pairing in this feud, this is an easy choice. Though I’m interesting in seeing how physical the match will get, considering Jelly Roll’s size and the talent of the other “celebrity” turned wrestler, Logan Paul. Winners: Randy Orton & Jelly Roll\nRoman Reigns & Jey Uso vs. Bronson Reed & Bron Breakker w/ Paul Heyman\nRoman Reigns’ former wise man Paul Heyman is looking to take out two member of the OG Bloodline in fell swoop with the OTC teams with Jey Uso to take on Bronson Reed and Bron Breakker.\nAshlee: Bron Breakker is a bonified future World Heavyweight Champion. And Paul Heyman is precisely the manager to give him the boost he needs. While I’m still not sold on Reed, it does nothing for Uso and Reigns to win here. And despite the injury, I’d be surprised if Rollins isn’t somehow still involved here to further get at Reigns. Winners: Bronson Reed & Bron Breakker\nJonathan: No, Rollins means the spotlight will be on Breakker and Reed to hold down the fort, accompanied by The Oracle, Paul Heyman. Personally, I was more partial to “The Wiseman” nickname, but I digress. I would expect Jey and Roman to win here, but it’s likely that said Oracle --and Rollins-- will have something planned. Winners: Bronson Reed & Bron Breakker\nMetlife Stadium\nThe home of WrestleMania 29 and 35 is getting set to host it’s first-ever SummerSlam.\nAfter having first opened in 2010, Metlife Stadium is the home to two NFL franchises, the Jets and Giants. In addition to two WrestleMania events, the 93,000 seat stadium has hosted the Super Bowl, soccer, college football and countless concerts featuring the likes of Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, and Beyonce.\nFans making the trip north to New Jersey should make themselves aware of items that are prohibited inside the stadium, including non-clear bags exceeding 4.5″x6.5″.\nFirst Alert Weather\nw/ WBRC First Alert Meteorologist Matt Daniel\nThe weather is looking fantastic if you plan on attending SummerSlam this weekend.
