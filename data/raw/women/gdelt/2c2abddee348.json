  "body_text": "Fran Kirby has announced her retirement from international duty with immediate effect ahead of England’s European Championship campaign.\nJust a month out from the Lionesses’ opening group-stage contest against France, Kirby outlined her intention to depart the international stage with her ‘head held high’.\nThe 31-year-old Brighton attacking midfielder has been instrumental in England’s progress over the last decade and was a key part of Sarina Wiegman’s squad that won the 2022 Women’s Euros.\nBut Kirby, who scored 19 goals in 77 appearances for her country, had been told she would not be included in Wiegman’s party for this summer’s tournament in Switzerland.\nThe news comes a week after Kirby’s long-time team-mate Mary Earps called it quits, with the PSG goalkeeper having lost her place to Hannah Hampton as Wiegman’s number one.\n‘It is something I have been thinking about for over a year,’ Kirby told BBC Sport of her decision.\n‘I knew this was going to be my last major tournament.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?
