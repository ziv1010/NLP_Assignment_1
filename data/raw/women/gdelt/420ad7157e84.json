  "body_text": "—NET Rankings Update (men’s): No. 176.\nMonday afternoon Cardinal news and notes\nMy guy Project Pat living his best life at the most magical place on Earth: NuLu. I think that’s NuLu.\n—NET Rankings Update (women’s): No. 20.\n—The Louisville softball team opened its 2024 season with five wins in Florida. The 5-0 start is the best for the program since 2012. The Cards face Florida International today at 5 p.m.\n—Eric Crawford writes about Sunday’s screw job in Syracuse.\nI’ve seen about everything, and experienced some pretty bad behavior by coaches, players, even fans. Once, my umpiring partner ended a game prematurely because he wasn’t going to listen to any more of it.\nSo, before anyone accuses me of bashing officials, I think someone needs to speak in their defense. It’s a thankless job, even when you do it well. And when you don’t – and there were times I didn’t – it’s not pretty.\nWhich brings us to the end of the University of Louisville women’s basketball team’s 73-72 loss at Syracuse on Sunday.\nSyracuse had the ball in the closing seconds, with Louisville leading 72-71. Dyaisha Fair, one of the best offensive players in the ACC, had the ball 35 feet from the basket with less than five seconds left. Louisville had two fouls to give. Olivia Cochran of Louisville, as Fair drove, reached out to make contact to give a foul that would stop the clock and force a Syracuse inbounds play.\nYou see it at the end of every game when a team needs to foul. Two hands extended, maybe a semi-wrap up, and a whistle. Almost every game.\nExcept this time, when the whistle blew, the official raised both arms, crossed, to signal an intentional foul. And that was the game. Fair made two free throws, then Syracuse got the ball and dribbled out the clock.\nThe rule book is pretty clear on intentional fouls. But the game of basketball, over several decades, has been even more clear. That foul, by rule, is intentional. But unless it’s excessively rough, it’s a common foul.\nThis was a divergence. A game-deciding divergence. Louisville coach Jeff Walz had other words for it.\n“It was a God-awful call,” Walz said. “It was terrible officiating. They should be embarrassed. But you know, I’ll get my fine. I’m sure I’ll get a letter of reprimand. But at this point, somebody has to start holding the officials accountable. That call was the worst call I’ve seen in my 29 years of coaching. If we’re going to start calling that, every foul at the end of a game when a team has to foul, it’s intentional. Every foul is. We all know it is. But to call it in a one-point game with 2.5 seconds left, it’s just awful. It’s atrocious. It’s embarrassing. It’s embarrassing for our league. But we’ll never hear anything about it because it’s such a sacred society that we can’t ever reprimand publicly an official, God forbid. But we’ll reprimand coaches and players will be called out. But there’s three people out there, God forbid, if we came out and we actually said a league made a statement that it was a blown call, a bad call. We won’t do that.”\n—On Friday, the ACC announced the host sites for 40 future conference championship events.
