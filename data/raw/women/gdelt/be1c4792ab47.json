  "body_text": "No matter what else happens in the football career of Nosikho “Bellah”, she will forever be celebrated as the player who scored the University of Fort Hare’s first ever Hollywoodbets Super League goal.\nReceiving the ball on the edge of the box, she fired in a powerful long-range shot that the TUT ‘keeper did well to parry away. However, it was not enough to prevent the 24-year-old wing from burying the ball on her second attempt.\n“It was a great feeling being able to contribute to the success of the team,” she said of her historic goal on Saturday. “I was panicking that I would be failing them if I didn’t score.”\nMagqaza’s strike early in the second half drew her side level and laid the foundations for the famous win to come.\nThe goal represented a milestone moment for the final-year Bachelor of Commerce student, who had been determined to help her team achieve Super League status from the moment she joined the club in 2022.\nBeing able to open her side’s account on their debut in women’s football’s elite competition could not have been more fitting.\nFort Hare qualified by coming through the second-tier Sasol League’s coastal, provincial and national playoffs – a journey of around 30 unbeaten matches that tested them in every department last year.\n“[Winning on Saturday] was the best feeling knowing the fight we had to be at this level. It was not easy to get here so we are giving it our all,” the star from Dutywa said.\nFort Hare face University of Pretoria in the latter’s backyard this weekend and the playmaker knows that more of that fight will be needed if they are to make it two wins from two.\nShe expected Tuks to bring a lot of energy to the clash, especially after slumping to a loss against Durban Ladies in the opening round.\nThe Tshwane outfit are known for having uber talented individuals in their ranks, including some who have been capped at national level.\nMagqaza was not fazed, however, as UFH were extremely “hungry” for positive results in their maiden season at the top.\n“We are not afraid of them. We are ready. We have prepared for all of this,” she said defiantly.\n“We can identify the strengths and weaknesses of our opponents. This is what we did [last Saturday]; we capitalised on TUT’s vulnerabilities.”\nBeing able to spot deficiencies in their rivals had a lot to do with the arrival of Fort Hare’s new signings, she said.\nSince most had played Super League football before, they knew many of the opposition players and could tell their teammates what to look out for. This insight proved invaluable in their win against TUT.\n“It’s incredible to have them around,” Magqaza said.\nThe wing makes no bones about her ambition to be called up for Banyana Banyana one day, and now that she is playing among the elite of the elite she has every chance of catching the selectors’ eye.\nFor now, though, she is just enjoying life under coach Asanda Mnakaniso and alongside her teammates – and making family, friends, neighbours, classmates and fans proud motivated her no end.\nThe match takes place on Saturday with kick-off scheduled for 3pm.",
