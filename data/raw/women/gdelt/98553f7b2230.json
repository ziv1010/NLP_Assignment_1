  "body_text": "HOW DID THIS happen?\nThat is the big question in the aftermath of Ireland’s 4-0 drubbing to Slovenia in League B of the Nations League.\nWas it just a calamitous half of football? Write it off as a night to forget?\nOr should we be surprised, as deeper issues begin to manifest?\nThat has often been asked following men’s national team shockers in recent years, linking the side’s downfall to how poorly the game has been managed here.\nBut this was an uncharacteristic, alarming result for the women’s team, against opposition ranked 14 places inferior.\nIt was their worst defeat since 2019, and heaviest competitive loss in over 12 years.\nExtenuating circumstances must be noted: new management, new system, limited time together, player changes, conditions, a potential hangover from Euro 2025 qualification heartbreak, and the fallout continuing from the end of the previous regime.\nSelection and tactical decisions backfired in Carla Ward’s second game — and first loss — at the helm. Fundamental errors and mistakes were glaring as Slovenia sauntered to a landmark win in Koper; the Irish players’ desire and passion has since been questioned, and apologies issued.\nA ‘wake-up call’ and ‘reality check’ is how Ward and some of her squad have assessed it.\nThis column is not to be reactionary. Yes, it was a horrendous result and another poor performance, but it’s early days in a new era, and perhaps just a blip overall. It’s not exactly a long-standing pattern. That said, there are more questions than answers after Ireland’s first international window of 2025 — along with plenty to consider when you scratch past the surface.\nAt first glance at the world rankings, this is a shocking defeat. 39 trumps 25. And comprehensively so.\nBut Slovenia’s positioning may be unjustified. They are a nation on the rise, having invested heavily into their women’s programme. That Uefa President Aleksander Čeferin hails from the Balkan country must help, but their federation has gotten their house in order and they appear to be reaping the benefits at all levels as women’s football booms worldwide.\nAs Ward warned: “Slovenia are a very good side, they’re progressing in all the age groups as well as the first team. In [League C] qualification last time around, six out of six, didn’t concede a goal. They’re a very, very good side.”\nThey’re a young outfit too, with players at Eintracht Frankfurt, Paris FC, Roma and Fiorentina, gaining invaluable Champions League experience.\nTheir manager Saša Kolman is an impressive operator, who cites Jim McGuinness as an influence following their encounter at the Celtic Academy. Kolman has had previous dealings with the FAI, calling Head of Coach Education Niall O’Regan a good friend and learning from what he perceives to be one of the best coach education models in Europe.\nWhile Ward took full ownership for the horror show in her post-match TV interview, she shared some interesting thoughts with reporters at Bonifika Stadium.\n“Yes it is a reality check,” she said. “We have to be realistic about where we are at as a nation. There’s no harm in saying I believe it was an overachievement to get to the last World Cup.\n“They did fantastically well to get there. We have to recognise where we’re at and move that expectation. And really understand we are in a transition period and building with a younger squad.”\nStarting with the last point: Are they? That may be the direction Ward wants to take, but there was no such evidence in the opening two games against Türkiye and Slovenia.\nHeather Payne was the youngest player in both XIs, the 25-year-old winning her 50th and 51st senior international caps. Eight of the starters used are 29 and over. The average ages of the starting teams were 29.1 and 27.9, and that’s following the retirements of Niamh Fahey, Diane Caldwell and Julie-Ann Russell.\nKatie McCabe and Denise O’Sullivan are 29 and 31 respectively. Ireland’s world-class duo have much more to offer — but have clocked up the mileage, and can’t spearhead this team forever.\nAbbie Larkin was the only player under the age of 20 used in this window, with concerns growing around the lack of those coming through.\nIndeed, there are some talented underage stars, and others sidelined with injury, but developmental and grassroots issues have been well documented.\nThe widening gap from U19 to senior international level has been a hot topic in recent months, along with a perceived disconnect with the Women’s League of Ireland. A development group convened last week following the discontinuation of home-based training sessions, but it’s unclear whether this is a permanent measure. An U23 international team is needed, but financial constraints are unlikely to allow for its introduction.\nAmong the many grievances away from the senior spotlight is the removal of regional development centres amid the disbandment of the Emerging Talent Programme, leaving elite youngsters lacking top-level contact and a clear pathway in their early teens.\nFAI Head of Women and Girls’ Football Hannah Dingley is due to unveil a plan, but hasn’t spoken to the media since her appointment last April.\nFears are growing about the direction of Irish women’s football, the risk of 2023 World Cup qualification being a one-off becoming more and more real.\nWhatever you think of Ward’s “overachievement” statement — whether blunt honesty in the heat of the moment or a ploy to temper expectations — the focus is very much on the present for this wounded Irish team.\nForget reaching the 2027 World Cup or instead building for the next Euros, Nations League promotion is now front and centre.\nThe new head coach insists she won’t change her system or style, but short-term pragmatism may be required as opposed to long-term idealism. The more defensive, direct approach used by her predecessors wasn’t pretty, but it was effective.\nWith a double-header against Greece a little over a month away, some will think Ireland might be better off setting up to get results, and parking possession-based plans. Or will it be a case of temporary pain for long-term gain?\nOne remembers Ruesha Littlejohn’s passionate call for a complete overhaul on RTÉ after the Wales play-off defeat; Eileen Gleeson’s vow that Irish women’s football would “not stand still” as the sport grows exponentially worldwide.\nThe FAI must show us that, not just tell. Action, and reaction, is needed.\nInterest levels are higher than ever. Participation numbers continue to rise at grassroots, with 45,000 women and girls registered as playing regular competitive football in Ireland. There’s talent there, which needs to be harnessed in the correct way.\nIrish women’s football has had great days. The hope is they will come again.\nBut last Tuesday night in Koper must be a wake-up call, for more than just this team.",
