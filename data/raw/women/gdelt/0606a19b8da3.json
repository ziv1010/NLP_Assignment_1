Initiations involve societies or sports clubs “welcoming” new freshers to the club by forcing them to drink insane amounts of alcohol and often making them do disgusting acts.\nUniversity initiation scandals have caused the tragic deaths of four UK students in the last decade and, as of 2021, students who take part in toxic initiations could be jailed for torture.\nUniversities UK, the body that represents higher education institutions across the UK, wrote to university leaders in 2021 to remind them of the legal repercussions of hosting initiations. It said: “Following this incident and the investigation into it, a report by the head of security (an ex-police officer) raised the point that false imprisonment carries a maximum jail sentence of 15 years and torture has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.\n“The defence of, ‘But I’m a student’ would also not stand up in court if matters went that far. Behaviours such as problem initiations will only serve to exacerbate the poor mental health of many students, risking both their future participation in sport and also their place at university.”\nBut there has been a wide range of grim initiations on uni campuses across the UK over the years. From apple-bobbing with dead rats and being forced to eat maggots and dog food to sliding around in excrement, here is a rundown of the most appalling university initiation scandals of all time.\nStudents had to ‘watch porn sitting on newspapers’\nLast year, a university society initiation allegedly involved students having to watch porn whilst sitting on newspapers.\nMost Read\nA viral TikTok video shows an interviewer approaching two students at an event.
