  "body_text": "COMPARISON DOES NOT WORK\nThe Macquarie Point stadium proposal should not go ahead.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nI am a fan of AFL football, but our understandable desire for a Tasmanian team in the AFL should not come at the expense of further worsening our state's dire financial debt situation.\nAttempts by various spokespersons to equate Macquarie Point to the Adelaide Oval are spurious, at best.\nAdelaide Oval is the only major stadium in South Australia.\nIt sits in the heart of a city of 1.4 million people.\nIt caters for more than 60 events a year, including AFL, SANFL, test match and BBL cricket and music concerts.\nIt has two established AFL teams with enormous fan bases which, during the season, can fill the Adelaide Oval each week.\nHobart, on the other hand, has a population of roughly 200 000, only a fraction of whom would attend football regularly.\nDistance and cost would prevent most people in the North and North-West of the state from attending events in Hobart, no doubt accounting for the fact that a survey showed two-thirds of this community are against building the stadium.\nThere is no way in which our case stacks up against Adelaide's.\nAs was shown in the Gruen Report, the stadium makes no financial sense.\nLet's face it.\nThe AFL doesn't really want a 19th team in their competition.\nIf they did, they wouldn't have placed such a ridiculous stipulation on Tasmania's entry.\nThe Rockliff government should have the 'ticker' to can it.\nSteve Puccetti, Ambleside\nDEFENDING MEN'S FOOTBALL\nEarlier this month, this newspaper published a story featuring a female footballer, who in support of elevating match day game time for women's football, went on a free swinging, accusatorial smackdown of men and men's football.\nHow dare she, but more incredulous was that the newspaper saw fit to publish such unsubstantiated junk.\nAmong other hyperbolic claims, the female player said, \"It's about eradicating sexism and misogyny in sport and in general, and views that people are lesser based on gender\" Really?\nWhat sexism and misogyny exists in Coastal football - please tell me? Fact - she and her teammates are not lesser persons, and a newsflash - no-one thinks it.\nEqually fact - their product is way inferior to the men's and always will be. In the pursuit of virtuous equality, must we in the 2020's bow to that irrefutable fact being swamped by feigned indignation?\nAgain Fact.\nAnd this - \"It leaves a big question for us girls and we want to know why we aren't given the same respect\".\nRespect.....really? What respect (or lack of) did she mean?\nIf she took that \"respect\" gripe to its furthest point, why not rotate women's and men's senior starting time of second each Saturday?\nTry it, and watch those forced 'eyeballs' find something better to do every second week.\nDale Perry, Devonport\nED'S NOTE: We're proud to provide a platform for \"female footballers\", and women generally and, indeed, all of our readers, to have their say. We'll leave it to our readers to judge if sexism and misogyny exist in Coastal football.\nA GOOD WATER USE POINT\nKaren Lamb makes a good point: where will those thirsty nuclear power plants get their water (Adv., Feb 23)?\nThere may be a lot of water around in some parts of the country, but in other parts precious little.\nWhere the rain falls is becoming more unpredictable.\nNuclear plants need a constant supply of cooling water.\nAnd they need to discharge that heated water back into the environment. In the heatwaves that Europe experienced in 2022, nuclear plants had to power down to protect the rivers which supplied their water.\nThis is a risky business for Australia, our wide brown land.\nFor those living near a nuclear plant, very risky indeed.\nFiona Colin, Malvern East\nWhat do you think?
