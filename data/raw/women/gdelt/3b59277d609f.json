  "body_text": "Abu Dhabi Childhood Authority (ECA) has launched a system that collates data from different aspects of children's lives and can flag up if there is a need to intervene for the child's well-being.\nThe system, which applies to all children in Abu Dhabi up to the age of 18, has been introduced to answer the question: how do we know if a child is thriving? It will work by collating information from health organisations, education bodies and social services. Cross-referencing this data will allow the ECA to identify any problems affecting a child's well-being and their performance in other aspects of their life.\nWho will benefit\nThe Thriving Child Index will act as a guide for decision-making on everything from children's education, health, culture and emotional well-being, a senior figure involved with the project said.\nIt will ensure that policies affecting children are grounded in evidence and real-world impact, and that progress can be measured over time, said Laila Al Hassan, director of outreach and partnerships with the ECA. She gave obesity as a clear example of where better data was urgently needed.\n\"With this index, we can track if our efforts, from policy to urban planning, are actually working,\" she said. \"And if they’re not, we’ll know we need to shift direction.”\nShe shared two recent cases that illustrate how cross-sectoral data can change lives – names have been changed for confidentiality. “Farah is 11. Every morning she watched her neighbours head to school while she stayed home, because her mother couldn’t drop her off until late. She was caring for Farah’s ill grandmother. It wasn’t that Farah didn’t want to go, she simply couldn’t,\" said Ms Al Hassan.\nThe family were flagged to authorities with evidence of a pattern of chronic absenteeism, which triggered an intervention.\n\"The Social Support Authority arranged home care for the grandmother, and suddenly Farah could attend school like everyone else. Her attendance improved, her learning improved, and her whole future shifted.”\nAnother case, she said, involved a six-year-old girl named Ayesha. “She was an average student with frequent absences. She also had multiple hospital visits for injuries. Alone, each incident might seem unremarkable. Children fall. Families go through divorce. But together, the data painted a very different picture,” said Ms Al Hassan.\n“Because we’re now looking at children’s lives holistically, connecting health, education, family and social support, Ayesha didn’t fall through the cracks. She was flagged as high-risk and received the attention she needed.\n“These stories aren’t exceptions. They’re examples of what’s possible when government entities share data, collaborate across sectors and follow through. It’s not just about collecting numbers. It’s about translating insight into real help, at the right time.”\nFocus on well-being\n\"Over the past three years, the ECA has convened with global leaders and UAE policymakers to discuss data-driven insights on child well-being,\" said Yousef Al Hammadi, ECA executive director of knowledge and impact.\n“Children’s well-being involves us all – caregivers, parents, teachers, clinicians, and society as a whole. There is already a wealth of data on children’s education, cognitive and social development, early detection of developmental challenges, health care, mental and physical well-being, family cohesion, and financial stability. Our goal is to analyse these aspects holistically, identifying challenges and opportunities with the support of our partners.\"\nTo achieve this, the ECA is working closely with organisations across different sectors, including the Ministry of Education, Abu Dhabi Department of Health, Department of Government Enablement and Department of Community Development. Initial research showed there was no unified definition of a “thriving child”, according to the organisation.\nThere are multiples phases to the index the first of which involves defining the framework and key indicators and is expected to be completed soon. The preliminary analysis is expected to be ready by the end of the year, while the final version of the index is expected to take up to two years.\nGlobal research\nThe ECA is working with international partners from Australia, Europe and the US to ensure the project is in line with with global standards, while still being tailored to the UAE’s specific needs.\nThe UAE has already taken several measures to ensure the physical and mental well-being of children. Earlier this year The National reported how the UAE's first digital detox clinic for children had opened in Abu Dhabi offering a programme to address the growing problem of screen addiction in young people.\nThe challenges facing those tasked with looking after the physical well-being of children were highlighted in a recent report by the medical journal The Lancet, which stated that one in three teenagers in the Middle East is expected to be obese by 2030.\n“One of our major priorities is understanding what it means for a child to thrive. We have identified the characteristics of an ‘aspirational child’ – one who reaches their full potential in a safe and supportive environment,\" said Mr Al Hammadi.\n“This project will not only help policymakers but also provide valuable insights for parents and caregivers. The goal is to ensure that every child in the UAE has the opportunity to thrive in an environment that nurtures their development.\"",
