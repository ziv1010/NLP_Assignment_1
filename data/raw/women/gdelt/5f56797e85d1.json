  "body_text": "WHEN John-Kymani Gordon stepped off the bench to score Colchester United’s late winner in their triumph at Grimsby Town last November, it was a pivotal moment in more ways than one.\nAt the time, the 1-0 win at Blundell Park was heralded in the context of it being the U’s first away victory of the season in League Two but it has proved to have more far-reaching implications for their campaign.\nSince that rainy day in Lincolnshire, Colchester have been in red-hot form, winning 11, drawing eight and losing just three of the 22 league games that have followed.\nREAD MORE: Colchester Women stroll into League Cup quarter-finals\nIt is that superb form that has seen the U’s soar up the table and establish themselves as serious promotion candidates heading into the final weeks of the campaign and the reason why tomorrow night’s home clash with Grimsby, who have similar play-off aspirations.\n“We got on the right side of a very tight game, back in November in really difficult conditions,” said U’s boss Danny Cowley.\n“It was actually maybe the catalyst for the fine form that we’ve been in ever since.\n“Someone actually sent me a stat of the league table after 23 games, which for us is half a season and we were top, just above Bradford.\n“That’s not just six games, eight games, ten games – that’s half a season.\n“So, for the last half a season, we’ve accumulated 45 points and if you put that together as a whole season, you’d be on 90 points and league champions.\n“We’ve been consistent for a long period of time and we know what’s allowed us to be consistent and that’s definitely been about our work ethic, our intensity, our determination and our resilience.\n“They are all good qualities that we’ve shown and that’s given us a level of consistency.\n“Ultimately, we’re enjoying each other’s company, seeing the best in each other and enjoying our football.”\nREAD MORE: How bookies view Colchester United's play-off chances\nColchester host a Grimsby side who lie a point above them in the table, with David Artell’s side currently residing in the final play-off spot.\nCowley said: “It’ll be a great challenge against a very good team and we’ll need to be at our very, very best, that is for sure.\n“Grimsby have had a fantastic season.\n“We’re on a similar points tally but they’ve kind of done the opposite to us – they’ve won and lost, whereas we’ve accumulated quite a lot of our points through draws.\n“They’re a team who know how to win games and you only have to look at the number of games that they’ve won – you have to be a good team to have won that many games, in that division.\n“They’ve got good qualities going forward, they can mix their game up so that they build their play, they can also go more direct into Danny Rose, they’ve got some good athleticism and technical quality in and around him.\n“They score a lot of goals from wide free-kicks and central free-kicks and they also have a really long throw which is a dangerous weapon for them too so there’s a lot to respect, about the opponent.”",
