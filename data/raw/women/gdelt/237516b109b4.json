But in this house we are all obsessed with football. My husband is Australian, but when it comes to football he is another Spaniard.Paloma Fernandez\nIf they don't make it to Sydney, Paloma plans to invite nearly 50 female members of her club, to her home.\n'Show our colours'\nPlenty of fans won't be lucky enough to go to the stadium.\nTania Delgado plans to watch from a bar in Sydney where there´s a big screen and where they are allowed to decorate the whole place with the colours of the team.\nWe are going to wear flags, many painted by the children. We'll have music, we'll make an order for pizzas. Since we're not going to the stadium, it's the best option.Tania Delgado\nDuring the tournament, Tania says she and her group of friends were following games from a campsite using a VPN connection that allowed them to receive a broadcast with Spanish commentary.\n“The broadcast was in Spanish, and it cheered us on even more,” the Real Madrid fan says.\nDespite how difficult it is to get tickets at this late stage of the tournament, many fans are not giving up.\nIrene Lalana is a Madrilenian who lives in Brisbane and has been trying for several days to secure tickets to watch the game from the stands of Stadium Australia.\n“We've been trying to get tickets for two days by all means. There is an official resale on the same FIFA page, but it's very complicated because as soon as the tickets become available, they disappear almost instantly.”\nIrene is also a member of the organising committee of The Australian Spanish Socio-Cultural Association (TASSCA).\nThe group has been calling on the Spanish community in Brisbane to cheer on the team at the fanzone in Southbank, where they expect record crowds.\n“We've been telling people to come join us in the grass area, where there is more atmosphere, we´ll be painting ourselves in red and yellow, and bringing our red and yellow outfits,\" she says.\n“It's expected to get really busy and full so they've put one more screen.”\nIt's a little late for the families, but we're going to be there, because the girls are making history for Spain, we have to support the sport at this highest level.Irena Lalona\nSpain sealed its ticket on Tuesday by defeating Sweden 2-1, and the match on Sunday (20 August) will feature two teams who have never made a Women's World Cup final before.\nAustralia will face Sweden on Saturday in a playoff for third place.",
