  "body_text": "Tura Magic extended their lead to nine points at the top of the FNB Women’s Super League log after collecting maximum points over the weekend.\nMagic were given a tough test by Beauties FC before winning their encounter 3-1 on Saturday, while they romped to an 8-0 win against Okahandja FC the next day.\nIn Saturday’s match, chances were few and far between in the first half with Beauties striker and the league’s top goalscorer Fiola Vliete kept under wraps by Magic’s defence, while at the other end Beauties keeper Melissa Matheus brought off fine save from a long-range shot by Elmarie Fredericks.\nMagic stepped up their attacks in the second half and after Thomalina Adams and Lovisa Mulunga came close to scoring, Memory Ngonda opened their account when she headed in from a corner.\nVliete soon equalised for Beauties when she was fouled in the box and put the spot kick away, but Tura finished stronger and regained the lead after a great strike by Ngonda from the edge of the box.\nJuliana Blou put the issue beyond doubt when she swept in a cross by Ivonne Kooper in the final minute.\nTura Magic winger Adams said they were determined to win.\n“It was very exciting. We expected a tough match because our first leg match was very close and we only won 4-3 after scoring the winner in the 89th minute. So we didn’t underestimate our opponents, we went into the match aiming for the win and managed to do so with hard work and by playing our type of football,” she said.\n“I knew we would win it in the end, because most of the teams lack concentration in the last few minutes and that’s the time when we capitalise on those mistakes. It was a very important win for us, because although we are on top of the log, we needed to increase our goal difference,” she added.\nBeauties striker Vliete, meanwhile, said they will learn from their mistakes.\n“We were well prepared for the game but unfortunely we didnt maintain our focus so that’s it. We had a good game but we didnt maintain the high intensity and pressure, but next time we will do that,” she said.\n“I dont know if we can win the league, but I’d just like my team to finish in the top five,” she added.\nVliete is now well ahead on the top goalscorer’s list, especially after scoring seven more goals in Beauties’ 9-0 win against Rightway Phoenixes on Sunday. That put her on 42 goals for the season and closing in on Anna Shikusho’s record of 55.\n“I feel great to score so many goals, but as I’ve mentioned before I didnt achieve it on my own, my team supported me all the way. But I believe I can reach the record, I’m not afraid of anything,” she said.\nTura Magic thumped Okahandja FC 8-0 on Sunday to move up to 52 points at the top of the log.\nUnam Bokkies went second on the log on 43 points after beating V Power Angels 1-0 on Saturday and then gaining revenge against Nust Babes to win their varsity derby 4-1 on Sunday.\nGirls & Goals, who were inactive over the weekend, are third on 42 points, but with two matches in hand on the leaders. Beauties, meanwhile, dropped off the pace with their defeat to Tura Magic and are now fourth on 38 points, 14 behind Magic.\nIn other matches over the weekend, Ongwediva Queens beat Arrows Ladies 1-0, V Power Angels beat Omaheke Queens 10-0, Arrows Ladies beat Ramblers 2-1, Nust Babes beat Omaheke Queens 7-0, Rightway Phoenixes beat Okahandja FC 1-0 and Ongwediva Queens beat Namib Daughters 8-1.\nIn an age of information overload, Sunrise is The Namibian’s morning briefing, delivered at 6h00 from Monday to Friday.
