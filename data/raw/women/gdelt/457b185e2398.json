gave a green light for them to be sent.\n\"Yes, we delivered Leopard tanks as we announced,\" chancellor Olaf Scholz said in Rotterdam.\n\"We're providing very modern (tanks) which we have now delivered.\"\nKyiv has appealed to its western allies to send heavy machinery required to push back Russian forces, ahead of a possible spring counter-offensive by Kyiv.\nBerlin delivered 18 of the advanced Leopards, with the last of the tanks having left Germany at the end of last week, The Spiegel reported.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky met with UN atomic energy chief Rafael Mariano Grossi in southern Ukraine.\nThe two discussed the precarious situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which has lost several of its power transmission cables during the conflict and on multiple occasions has had to switch to emergency diesel generators.\nMr Grossi, who is director-general of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, plans to visit the plant, which is held by Russian forces, this week.\nKey points\nGermany delivers promised Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine\nZelensky meets UN atomic energy chief ahead of Zaporizhzhia visit\nRussia’s nuclear rhetoric dangerous and irresponsible, says Nato\nGermany delivers promised tanks to Ukraine\n04:15 , Alisha Rahaman Sarkar\nGermany has delivered 18 Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Monday.\nMore in World\nThe delivery of the “very modern” German-made battle tanks comes some two months after Berlin finally gave the green light for them to be sent.\nUkraine has appealed to its Western allies to send the heavy weaponry required to push back Russian forces, ahead of a possible spring counter-offensive by Kyiv.\n“Yes, we delivered Leopard tanks as we announced,” Mr Scholz told a press conference with Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte in Rotterdam.\nRussia fires anti-ship missile at mock target\n03:59 , Alisha Rahaman Sarkar\nThe Russian navy has fired supersonic anti-ship missiles at a mock target in the Sea of Japan, the defence ministry said today.\n“In the waters of the Sea of Japan, missile ships of the Pacific Fleet fired Moskit cruise missiles at a mock enemy sea target,” the ministry said in a statement.\n“The target, located at a distance of about 100 kilometres, was successfully hit by a direct hit from two Moskit cruise missile.”\nBelarus hits out at Poland over border delays\n03:55 , Andy Gregory\nBelarus has accused Poland of causing long delays at its border with the European Union by slowing the movement of trucks, alleging that Warsaw was failing to implement bilateral agreements.\nPoland, a fierce critic of veteran Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, in February closed one of its key border crossings with Belarus, citing security concerns – a decision Minsk called “catastrophic”.\n“Since Friday, a queue in front of the only accessible border crossing point on the Belarusian-Polish border ... has doubled in size and now totals 1,000 vehicles,” the Belarusian border committee said in a statement.\n“The main reason is the failure of the Polish side to implement bilateral agreements on the passage of trucks,” it said, accusing Poland of only processing 61 per cent of the typical number of trucks crossing the border over the weekend.\nPutin taking Belarus as ‘nuclear hostage’, says top Ukrainian official\n02:59 , Andy Gregory\nUkraine's top security official has denounced the Kremlin's plans to station tactical atomic weapons in Belarus, saying that Russia was taking its ally as a “nuclear hostage”, reports Karl Ritter.\nOleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, warned on Sunday that Putin's announcement was “a step towards internal destabilisation” of Belarus that maximised “the level of negative perception and public rejection” of Russia and Putin in Belarusian society.\nThe Kremlin, Mr Danilov added, “took Belarus as a nuclear hostage.”\nUkraine official: Putin taking Belarus as 'nuclear hostage'\nAnalysis | No country can afford to ignore the war in Ukraine\n01:52 , Andy Gregory\nIn case you missed it, our world affairs editor Kim Sengupta wrote last week that the presence of China’s Xi Jinping in Moscow, and the Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida in Kyiv, had “illustrated the global impact of this conflict in the heart of Europe, with old strategic alliances being strengthened and new ones being formed”.\nYou can read his analysis in full here:\nAnalysis: It is becoming clear that no country can ignore the war

Ukraine\nMonday 27 March 2023 23:32 , Andy Gregory\nUkraine’s ambassador to Switzerland has said she expects the nation to change its mind on blocking re-exports of arms to Ukraine – despite its longstanding foreign policy of neutrality.\nAn opinion poll published by the Sotomo Institute in Zurich in late January found that 55 per cent of respondents favoured re-exporting Swiss-made war materiel to Ukraine.\nSpeaking to Reuters, ambassador Iryna Venediktova said she expected Switzerland to change its position very soon as support for the re-export of Swiss arms to her country increases.\n“We need these weapons and ammunition as fast as possible,” she said. “It is a question of survival of our people, our nation, our state.”\nSwiss neutrality should not block re-export of arms to Ukraine, insists ambassador\nMonday 27 March 2023 22:28 , Andy Gregory\nSwitzerland’s tradition of neutrality should not include blocking re-exports of Swiss weapons to Ukraine, Kyiv’s ambassador has insisted, claiming the “whole world expects a fair position” instead.\nSwitzerland’s government reiterated this month it would not change its long-standing policy of banning any country that buys Swiss arms from sending them to the party of a conflict.\nBut speaking to Reuters at the Ukrainian embassy in Bern, Iryna Venediktova said neutrality and the re-export of arms to Ukraine should be viewed as separate issues.\n“I respect Swiss neutrality because it is a pillar of the Swiss state,” she said. “But every day I stress that neutrality and re-export are two absolutely different terms.”\n“We don’t ask, ‘Give your weapons to us directly.’ We just ask not to block [re-exports] ... not to contribute to this crime of aggression,” Ms Venediktova said. “The whole world is watching, and the whole world expects a fair position, nothing more than a fair position.”\nSwitzerland has denied requests from Germany, Denmark and Spain to re-export Swiss war materiel to Ukraine. Switzerland, however, has adopted the European Union’s sanctions against Russia over the invasion, which it has repeatedly condemned.\nEU Council chief vows support, ammunition for Ukraine\nMonday 27 March 2023 22:18 , Andy Gregory\nHere is more information on European Council president Charles Michel’s remarks on Ukraine during his visit to Bucharest today:\nEU Council chief vows support, ammunition for Ukraine\nUkraine says defending Bakhmut a ‘military necessity’ as Russia turns attention to ‘post-apocalyptic’ Avdiivka\nMonday 27 March 2023 21:12 , Reuters\nUkraine’s ground forces commander has said that Kyiv is planning its next move after Russia shifted the focus of its offensive from Bakhmut to Avdiivka, a town some 55 miles south now described as post-apocalyptic, reports Dan Peleschuk.\nColonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi, who said last week that the Ukrainian counterattack could come “very soon”, visited frontline troops in the east on Monday and said his forces were still repelling Russian attacks on Bakhmut.\nDefending the small city in the industrialised Donbas region that Russia has tried to seize for months was a “military necessity”, he said, praising Ukrainian resilience in “extremely difficult conditions”.\n“We are calculating all possible options for the development of events, and will react adequately to the current situation”.\nUkraine says defending Bakhmut a ‘military necessity’\nHungarian parliament approves Finland’s Nato bid after months of delay\nMonday 27 March 2023 20:07 , Andy Gregory\nHungary's parliament has approved a bill to allow Finland to join Nato once its application has been ratified by all 30 members of the alliance – bringing months of delay by Viktor Orban’s ruling Fidesz party to an end.\nThe bill on Sweden's Nato accession remains stranded in the Hungarian parliament. Finland and Sweden asked to join the transatlantic military alliance last year in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But the process has been held up by Turkey and Hungary.\nTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed earlier this month to start ratifying Finland’s bid, but is still refusing to allow Sweden to join the alliance.\nEU will ‘massively ramp up’ ammunition production for Ukraine, vows Michel\nMonday 27 March 2023 19:14 , Andy Gregory\nEuropean Council president Charles Michel has pledged that EU leaders will “massively ramp up” ammunition production to send to Ukraine, and will continue supporting Kyiv “for as long as necessary”.\n“We are again stepping up our military support,” Mr Michel told a news conference in Bucharest’s Cotroceni Palace, where he discussed EU support for Ukraine, security issues in Moldova and Romania’s bid to join the Schengen area with president Klaus Iohannis.\n“Last week, we agreed to urgently deliver one million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine. We will massively ramp up our production capacity,” Mr Michel said.\nLast week, EU foreign and defense ministers approved a plan for a fast-track purchasing procedure for direct negotiations with industrial providers of ammunition in Europe, and plan to send one million rounds to Ukraine within the next 12 months.\nFootage shows devastation in Bakhmut\nMonday 27 March 2023 18:34 , Andy Gregory\nHuge recruitment advert for Wagner Group appears in Moscow\nMonday 27 March 2023 17:29 , Andy Gregory\nA giant recruitment advert for Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has appeared on an office building next to a motorway in Moscow.\nThe advert, which covers 17 storeys, shows the group’s logo and slogans such as “Join the winning team!” and “Together we will win”, along with a picture of a masked man holding a weapon.\nWagner, which fights alongside Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, has sought to replenish troop numbers ahead of a potential Ukrainian counterattack, and is believed to have suffered heavy losses in the frontline city of Bakhmut.\nIts boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, a 61-year-old whose company grew wealthy by catering events and fulfilling contracts for the Kremlin and government ministries, has expressed an aim to recruit 30,000 new fighters by mid-May.\nGermany’s Leopard 2 tanks claimed to have reached Ukraine\nMonday 27 March 2023 16:41 , Andy Gregory\nThe Leopard 2 battle tanks pledged by Germany have arrived in Ukraine, a security source has told Reuters, corroborating a report by Spiegel news magazine.\nIn addition to the 18 main battle tanks, 40 German Marder infantry fighting vehicles, and two armoured recovery vehicles had also reached Ukraine, the security source said.\nThe German army trained the Ukrainian tank crews as well as the troops assigned to operate the Marder vehicles for several weeks on training grounds in Muenster and Bergen in northern Germany.\nBeyond the German vehicles, three Leopard tanks donated by Portugal also reached Ukraine, according to the security source.\nOrlando Bloom praises 'courage and determination' of Ukrainians during meeting with Zelensky\nMonday 27 March 2023 15:34 , Joe Middleton\nZelensky meets UN atomic energy chief Grossi ahead of Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant visit\nMonday 27 March 2023 14:59 , Joe Middleton\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky met with UN atomic energy chief Rafael Mariano Grossi in southern Ukraine on Monday.\nThe two discussed the precarious situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which has lost several of its power transmission cables during the conflict and on multiple occasions has had to switch to emergency diesel generators.\nMr Grossi, who is director-general of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, plans to visit the plant, which is held by Russian forces, this week.\nTwo dead and 29 injured after Russian forces shell Ukrainian city of Sloviansk\nMonday 27 March 2023 14:47 , Joe Middleton\nTwo people have been killed and 29 others were wounded when Russian forces shelled the Ukrainian city of Sloviansk, in the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region, local officials said.\nVideo footage of the aftermath showed damaged residential buildings, debris in the streets and vehicles on fire. Ukraine‘s President Volodymyr Zelensky described the attack as “terrorism”.\nRussian officials have denied targeting residential areas, even though artillery and rocket strikes have hit Ukrainian apartment buildings and civilian infrastructure daily during the war.\nThe Sloviansk attack followed a typical pattern of long-range shelling adopted by the Kremlin’s forces, especially in recent months as the fighting became deadlocked during the bitterly cold winter months.\nIn the eastern Donetsk region, some 10 cities and villages were shelled by Russian forces over the previous 24 hours, Ukraine‘s presidential office reported.\nOn Monday morning, Russian missiles hit the city of Avdiivka, damaging residential buildings, a hotel and a courthouse, officials added.\nAvdiivka mayor Vitali Barabash said utility companies are being evacuated from the frontline city, as it “resembles more and more a landscape from post-apocalyptic movies”.\nAttacks also intensified in the partially occupied south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region, where 14 settlements on the front line were shelled, authorities said.\nZelensky visits frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia\nMonday 27 March 2023 14:12 , Joe Middleton\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky visited frontline positions in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region on Monday, according to his Telegram channel.\n“I am honoured to be here today, next to our military,” he wrote in a post accompanied by a video of him handing out medals to Ukrainian troops.\nA steel plant ready for war shows hit to Ukraine's economy\nMonday 27 March 2023 13:15 , Joe Middleton\nFlak jackets are piled up at Ukraine’s Zaporizhstal steel plant, and anti-tank traps guard the entrance. Whenever air raid sirens sound — and they go off every day — most workers head to one of the 16 bomb shelters scattered across the sprawling grounds.\nBut some keep working — braving not only the intense heat and sparks flying from blast furnaces forging steel used in everything from railway cars to household appliances, but the threat of shelling — to keep the molten metal moving.\nA steel plant ready for war shows hit to Ukraine's economy\nIOC should stick to plan to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes, say Britain, Poland and Baltic states\nMonday 27 March 2023 12:32 , Joe Middleton\nRussian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, according to Poland, Britain and the Baltic states, despite the IOC saying it plans to let them compete as neutrals.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) sanctioned Russia and Belarus after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 but is now reluctant to exclude their athletes from the Olympics entirely for fear of a return to the boycotts of the Cold War era.\nIt set out a pathway in January for competitors from Russia and Belarus to earn Olympic slots through Asian qualifying and to compete as neutral athletes in Paris next year.\n“We strongly believe that now is not the time to consider the opening up of a pathway for Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to the Olympic Games in any status,” the Polish foreign ministry said in a statement issued jointly with Britain, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.\nNeutral athletes are not considered to be representing their nations and their successes are not accompanied by the flying of flags or playing of national anthems.\nThe President of the IOC Thomas Bach has said that the body cannot be a referee in global political disputes. However, the plan has faced opposition, with Germany and others coming out in favour of maintaining the ban.\nKyiv calls for emergency meeting of UN Security Council\nMonday 27 March 2023 11:55 , Joe Middleton\nKyiv has called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to “counter the Kremlin’s nuclear blackmail” after Russian president Vladimir Putin revealed plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.\nIn a statement, Ukraine’s foreign ministry said: “Ukraine expects effective action to counter the Kremlin’s nuclear blackmail by the UK, China, the U.S. and France.\nThe statement added: “The world must be united against someone who endangers the future of human civilization,” the statement said.\nNato has also criticised Russian president Putin for his “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric.\nHollywood star Orlando Bloom hails strength of Ukrainian people on visit to the country\nMonday 27 March 2023 10:52 , Joe Middleton\nOrlando Bloom has praised the strength of the Ukrainian people as he met the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and encouraged him to “go win” the war.\nThe British actor, 46, who is a Unicef Goodwill Ambassador, travelled to Kyiv in his first visit back to Ukraine since 2016.\nIn the meeting, Bloom told Mr Zelensky it is “remarkable to see how you are holding this country” and said it was a “real honour” to meet the Ukrainian president.\nHe said: “(It is) so encouraging in so many ways to see just the remarkably stoic nature of the people of Ukraine. And of course, your messaging that I think is reflected in their courage, and in their determination and in their perseverance and resilience.\n“To see the children, to see in their eyes, it’s palpable the anxiety and yet, the strength of the Ukrainian people is something that is really awe-inspiring in truth and, of course, your messaging is the reason for that.”\nPoland detains foreign citizen for spying\nMonday 27 March 2023 10:21 , Joe Middleton\nPoland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors said on Monday, as the largest country on NATO’s eastern flank finds itself increasingly targeted by Moscow’s intelligence services.\nThe war in Ukraine has plunged what were already strained relations between Poland and Russia to new lows, with Warsaw saying it is frequently the subject of Russian espionage and disinformation.\nProsecutors in the northern Polish city of Gdansk said in a statement that the suspect had been detained on March 21.\n“The findings made in the case show that the suspect acted for the benefit of Russian intelligence by obtaining and collecting information... on critical infrastructure in the Pomeranian and Kuyavian-Pomeranian Regions and on the activities of services and bodies responsible for security,” they said.\n“The information obtained was passed on to the Russian intelligence service,” the statement added.\nThe arrest comes after Poland dismantled a Russian espionage network that had been preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine.\nIf found guilty the suspect could face up to 10 years in prison.\nUkraine’s force continuing to repel Russian troops, says general\nMonday 27 March 2023 09:24 , Joe Middleton\nUkraine‘s ground forces commander said on his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”.\nUkraine‘s military said Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi had acted during a visit to the eastern front line to solve “problematic issues that prevent effective execution of combat tasks” and taken “operational decisions aimed at strengthening our capabilities to deter and inflict damage on the enemy.”\nIt gave no details, and did not say when the visit took place, but Syrskyi’s comments signalled Ukraine‘s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there.\nNato countries are a party to the conflict in Ukraine, says Russian official\nMonday 27 March 2023 08:47 , Joe Middleton\nThe secretary of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, said that Nato countries are a party to the conflict in Ukraine, according to excerpts from an interview with Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta on Monday.\nRossiyskaya Gazeta cited Patrushev as saying: “In fact, Nato countries are a party to the conflict. They made Ukraine one big military camp. They send weapons and ammunition to the Ukrainian troops, provide them with intelligence”.\nPatrushev, a former chief of the FSB internal security service, is widely seen as one of the most hawkish members of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.\nMoscow may seek compensation over Nord Stream gas pipelines explosion - reports\nMonday 27 March 2023 08:00 , Joe Middleton\nMoscow may seek compensation over damage from last year’s explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines, news agency RIA Novosti reported on Monday, citing a Russian diplomat.\nThe pipelines, which connect Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea, were hit by unexplained blasts last September in what Moscow called an act of “international terrorism”.\n“We do not rule out later the raising of the issue of compensation for damage as a result of the explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipelines,” Dmitry Birichevsky, the head of Russia’s Foreign Ministry department for economic cooperation, said in an interview with the news agency.\nHe added that Western countries were opposing a Russia-prepared draft U.N. Security Council resolution urging an independent international investigation of the Nord Stream blasts.\n“Despite this, we intend to continue to insist on a comprehensive and open international investigation with the mandatory participation of Russian representatives,” Birichevsky said.\nICYMI: King Charles says he is determined to visit Ukraine before he 'gets too old’\nMonday 27 March 2023 07:41 , Joe Middleton\nRussia’s nuclear rhetoric dangerous and irresponsible, says Nato\nMonday 27 March 2023 06:16 , Arpan Rai\nNato officials have called Vladimir Putin’s nuclear rhetoric “dangerous” after the Russian president announced plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.\n“Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible,” Nato spokesperson Oana Lungescu said yesterday.\nShe added: “Nato is vigilant and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own”.\nThe Russian president’s “non-proliferation pledge and his description of US weapons deployment overseas were way off the mark”, she added.\nPutin taking Belarus as ‘nuclear hostage’ – Ukraine official\nMonday 27 March 2023 05:34 , Arpan Rai\nUkraine’s top security official denounced the Kremlin’s plans to station tactical atomic weapons in Belarus, saying that Russia was taking its ally as a “nuclear hostage.”\nMoscow said it was making the move in response to the West’s increasing military support for Ukraine.\nRussian president Vladimir Putin announced the plan in a television interview that aired on Saturday, saying it was triggered by a UK decision this past week to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing rounds containing depleted uranium.\nRead the full story here:\nUkraine official: Putin taking Belarus as 'nuclear hostage'\nUkrainian city Avdiivka becoming 'post-apocalyptic' – official\nMonday 27 March 2023 04:43 , Arpan Rai\nUkrainian city in Donetsk is resembling “a place from post-apocalyptic movies” amid heavy Russian bombardment, a local official has said.\n“I am sad to say this, but Avdiivka is becoming more and more like a place from post-apocalyptic movies,” the city’s military administration head Vitaliy Barabash said on the Telegram messaging app.\nAmid intense shelling, the local authorities have ordered nearly a full shutdown of the frontline city located some 90km (56 miles) southwest of Bakhmut.\nHome to more than 30,000 civilians before Russia’s full-scale invasion last year, Avdiivka city now has some 2,000 people left.\nThe official added that the evacuation of the utility workers who are still trapped in the city has begun and mobile reception will be turned off soon as there are “informers of the Russian occupiers in the city”.\nAvdiivka could become a “second Bakhmut”, the Ukrainian military had warned last week as Russia reorganised some of its troops to the city and made gradual gains.\nUN nuclear watchdog chief may head to Russia soon – report\nMonday 27 March 2023 04:27 , Arpan Rai\nThe chief of the UN nuclear watchdog will be heading to Russia in the near future but he will not be travelling to the country this week, an official in Moscow has said.\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director general Rafael Grossi had announced a visit to the Russia-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine to monitor the critical situation.\nAn invite to Mr Grossi for Russia was “quite realistic”, Moscow’s permanent representative to international organisations Mikhail Ulyanov said, reported Russian news agency RIA.\n“Not next week, but somewhat later, the visit of Rafael Grossi to Russia may well take place,” Mr Ulyanov added.\nDrone footage shows smoke-filled Bakhmut city in ruins\nMonday 27 March 2023 04:25 , Arpan Rai\nThe Ukrainian army has released drone footage showing Bakhmut devastated by shelling in the continuing nine-months long Russian offensive.\nThe salt mining city is visibly in ruins after months of fierce fighting on the frontline between Russian forces and the Ukrainian army.\nSmoke can be seen billowing over residential blocks as many houses were destroyed in the conflict.\nA Ukrainian military commander said the battle for Bakhmut is “stabilising” as his forces are pushing back against Russian soldiers.\nIt comes as Vladimir Putin announced Russia will deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.\nWatch the video of Bakhmut here:\nDrone footage shows Bakhmut in ruins\nPutin arrest warrant gives Russian journalist ‘some sort of hope’ for resistance\nMonday 27 March 2023 03:00 , Jonathan Kanengoni\nRussian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova said the International Criminal Court’s decision to issue an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin has given her “some sort of hope” that resistance might be sparked within the country’s elite.\nMs Ovsyannikova worked for the Russian state broadcaster, Channel One Russia TV, for more than 10 years before she decided to stage a protest against the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\nIn March 2022 she interrupted a live evening news broadcast by holding up a sign saying “Stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, here you are being lied to”.\nMs Ovsyannikova, who fled Russia and is now living in Paris, told BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “I think that this is the first signal that the Russian elite should take notice of, and perhaps some kind of resistance will start within the Russian elite, they might plot against him.\n“This is some sort of hope for me.”\nShe added: “Over a long time I realised that Russian TV had become a brainwash.\n“I also have Ukrainian roots, my father is from Ukraine. At one point it was like a huge emotional outburst, I didn’t care what would happen to me.”\nShe claimed that many working in Russia’s state media share her opinions: “This propaganda is made on a very high level. People who are working in the main channels, we don’t really believe it. They have similar views to me.\n“No more than 10%-20% of people are pro-Putin.”\nNew Russian campaign seeks to entice men to fight in Ukraine\nMonday 27 March 2023 02:00 , Jonathan Kanengoni\nRussia has launched a new campaign, seeking volunteers to replenish the country’s troops for the war in Ukraine.\nAdvertisements promise cash bonuses and other benefits, recruiters make cold calls to eligible men, and enlistment offices are working with universities and social service agencies to lure students and the unemployed.\nAs fighting grinds on in Ukrainian battlegrounds like Bakhmut and both sides prepare for counter-offensives that could cost even more lives, the Kremlin’s war machine badly needs new recruits.\nA mobilisation in September of 300,000 reservists - billed as a “partial” call-up - sent panic throughout the country, since most men under 65 are formally part of the reserve. Tens of thousands fled Russia rather than report to recruiting stations.\nThe Kremlin denies that another call-up is planned for what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, now more than a year old.\nBut amid widespread uncertainty of whether such a move will eventually happen, the government is enticing men to volunteer, either at makeshift recruiting centres popping up in various regions, or with phone calls from enlistment officials.\nThat way, it can “avoid declaring a formal second mobilisation wave” after the first one proved so unpopular, according to a recent report by the US-based think tank Institute of the Study of War.\nUkrainian crews complete UK training on Challenger 2 tanks\nMonday 27 March 2023 01:00 , Jonathan Kanengoni\nUkrainian crews have completed training on Challenger 2 tanks in the UK and returned home to continue their fight against Russia’s invasion.\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said the Ukrainian soldiers “return to their homeland better equipped, but to no less danger”.\nMembers of Kyiv’s armed forces travelled to Britain shortly after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced in January that the UK would send 14 Challenger 2 tanks to help oust the Kremlin’s invaders from Ukraine.\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that the training has been completed after UK military officials spent several weeks instructing Ukrainian personnel how to operate and fight with the tanks.\nInstructions included how to command, drive and work together as a Challenger 2 tank crew and effectively identify and engage targets, the MoD said.\nMr Wallace, who visited the Ukrainian troops during their training at Bovington Camp in Dorset last month, said: “It is truly inspiring to witness the determination of Ukrainian soldiers having completed their training on British Challenger 2 tanks on British soil.\n“They return to their homeland better equipped, but to no less danger.\n“We will continue to stand by them and do all we can to support Ukraine for as long as it takes.”\nLieutenant Colonel John Stone, who oversaw the training mission, said: “It has been a privilege for the Combat Manoeuvre Centre team to deliver this training to our Ukrainian partners.\n“We have all been hugely impressed with the level of competence displayed and have no doubt that our friends will use the Challenger 2 tanks most effectively in the battles to come as they fight to defend their homeland.”\nThe MoD described the Challenger 2 vehicles as a “step change in capability” for Ukraine‘s armed forces, saying the machines would offer them some of the most modern and sophisticated gunnery systems in the world.\nThe Ukrainian troops will return with the Western tanks in time for a reported spring counter-offensive by Kyiv that is said to be in the works.\nDrone strikes and border trenches: Russia’s war on Ukraine comes home\nMonday 27 March 2023 00:00 , Martha Mchardy\nRecently built defences give us a roadmap of Russian anxiety, write Janice Kai Chen and Mary Ilyushina\nDrone strikes and border trenches: Russia’s war on Ukraine comes home\nNew Zealand tells China its concern on lethal aid to Russia\nSunday 26 March 2023 23:00 , Martha Mchardy\nNew Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta has expressed concern to China over any provision of lethal aid to support Russia in its war against Ukraine during a meeting with her Chinese counterpart.\nHer press office on Saturday detailed Mahuta’s cautionary remarks in Beijing, days after Chinese President Xi Jinping concluded his trip to Moscow, a warm affair in which Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin praised each other and spoke of a profound friendship.\nMahuta’s four-day trip, which began Wednesday, was the first made by a New Zealand foreign minister to Beijing since 2018 but it came at an awkward time as Xi visited Moscow the same week to give Putin a diplomatic boost after the International Criminal Court said it wants to put him on trial for alleged war crimes.\nRead the full story here:\nNew Zealand tells China its concern on lethal aid to Russia\nUkrainian city of Vuhledar has been ‘completely razed to the ground,’ commander says\nSunday 26 March 2023 22:00 , Martha Mchardy\nThe eastern Ukrainian city of Vuhledar has been “completely razed to the ground” amid ongoing heavy shelling by Russian forces in the area, Nazarii Kishak, commander of the machine gun unit with the 72nd separate mechanized brigade, said on national television.\nHe said: “The enemy continues to use multiple rocket launchers, and shelling not only the immediate front line and Vuhledar but also the surrounding areas.\n“The enemy is constantly shelling all settlements with large caliber weapons. The civilian population is exhausted.”\n“Vuhledar has been completely razed to the ground. Everything is burnt out, the city is almost empty. There are a few civilians who help the military. The police have taken away the rest of the people, especially the children who have been staying in basements for almost a month,” Mr Kishak said.\nThe commander said civillians are living “wherever they can, even in the corridors, hiding from the shelling.”\n“People are in a very exhausted emotional state of despair.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the plan in a television interview that aired on Saturday, saying it was triggered by a U.K. decision this past week to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing rounds containing depleted uranium.\nPutin argued that by deploying its tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russia was following the lead of the United States. He noted that Washington has nuclear weapons based in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey.\nOleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, tweeted Sunday that Putin’s announcement was “a step towards internal destabilization” of Belarus that maximized “the level of negative perception and public rejection” of Russia and Putin in Belarusian society. The Kremlin, Danilov added, “took Belarus as a nuclear hostage.”\nRead the full story here:\nUkraine official: Putin taking Belarus as 'nuclear hostage'\nUkraine says battle for Bakhmut is 'stabilizing'\nSunday 26 March 2023 19:00 , Martha Mchardy\nThe top commander of Ukraine’s military said Saturday that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut, and British military intelligence says Russia appears to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine.\n“The Bakhmut direction is the most difficult. Thanks to the titanic efforts of the defense forces, the situation is being stabilized,” Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi said in a post on Telegram giving a synopsis of a telephone call with Adm. Sir Tony Radakin, Britain’s chief of defense staff.\nThe seven-month battle for Bakhmut, where Russian forces have closed in on three sides, is the longest clash of the war, with Russia deploying both regular soldiers and fighters of the mercenary Wagner Group.

Security Council session to address the move.\nPutin announced the decision on Saturday, saying it would not violate nuclear non-proliferation promises and Russia would not hand off control of the weapons to Belarus.\nIn a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described it as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”.\n“Russia once again confirms its chronic inability to be a responsible steward of nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence and prevention of war, not as a tool of threats and intimidation,” the ministry said.\nIt demanded a Security Council session and also called on the Group of Seven countries and the European Union to warn Belarus of “far-reaching consequences” if it decides to accept the Russian weapons.\nPutin said in his remarks on Saturday that Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko had requested the stationing of the weapons. Minsk has not yet commented publicly on Putin’s announcement.\nThe Belarusian army has not formally fought in Ukraine but Minsk allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine last year. The two countries share a close military relationship.\n“Ukraine calls on all members of the international community to convey to the criminal (P)utin regime the categorical unacceptability of its next nuclear provocations and to take decisive measures to effectively deter and prevent any possibility of the aggressor state’s use of nuclear weapons,” the Ukrainian statement said.\n5 talking points ahead of England’s clash with Ukraine at Wembley\nSunday 26 March 2023 16:00 , Martha Mchardy\nEngland host Ukraine at Wembley on Sunday looking to make it two wins from two at the start of their Euro 2024 qualification campaign.\nHowever, the football will take a back seat as a delegation of Ukrainian refugees and their host families have been invited to the game as war in the country rages on.\nWe a look at some of the talking points ahead of the game as England look to build on their 2-1 win in Italy on Thursday.\n5 talking points ahead of England’s clash with Ukraine at Wembley\nRussia and China are not creating military alliance, Putin says\nSunday 26 March 2023 15:00 , Martha Mchardy\nRussia and China are not creating a military alliance and the cooperation between their armed forces is “transparent”, President Vladimir Putin said in comments broadcast on Sunday, days after hosting Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the Kremlin.\nPutin and Xi professed friendship and pledged closer ties, including in the military sphere, during their March 20-21 summit, as Russia struggles to make battlefield gains in what it calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine.\n“We are not creating any military alliance with China,” Putin said on state television. “Yes, we have cooperation in the sphere of military-technical interaction. We are not hiding this.\n“Everything is transparent, there is nothing secret.”\nChina and Russia signed a “no limits” partnership accord in early 2022, just weeks before Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine. Beijing has refrained from criticising Putin’s decision and has touted a peace plan for Ukraine. The West has dismissed its proposals as a ploy to buy Putin more time to rebuild his forces in Ukraine.\nWashington has said recently that it fears Beijing could arm Russia, something China denies.\nIn his televised remarks, Putin dismissed suggestions that Moscow’s increased ties with Beijing in areas such as energy and finance meant that Russia was becoming overly dependent on China, saying these were the views of “jealous people”.\n“For decades many have desired turning China against the Soviet Union and Russia, and vice versa,” he said. “We understand the world we live in.

The complex contains church, monastic and museum buildings; its oldest parts date back to the dawn of Christianity here a millennium ago.\nThe dispute is part of a wider religious conflict playing out in parallel with the war.\nThe government of Ukraine has already been cracking down on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church over its historic ties to the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leader, Patriarch Kirill, has supported Russian President Vladimir Putin in the invasion of Ukraine.\nThe parliament is considering a “draft law on making it impossible to operate in Ukraine religious organizations affiliated with centers of influence in the Russian Federation” — which could impact the UOC, depending on how it’s interpreted.\nThe UOC has insisted that it’s loyal to Ukraine, has denounced the Russian invasion from the start and has even declared its independence from Moscow.\nBut Ukrainian security agencies have claimed that some in the Ukrainian church have maintained close ties with Moscow.
