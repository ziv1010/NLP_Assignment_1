  "body_text": "There was a time when Fernando Lovo could spot up in the corner of the court and hit a 3-pointer, a skill he once thought might land him on a college basketball roster.\nHe quickly learned, however, that a different path was in store for him, but one thing about his focus never changed.\n“I always knew I wanted to be around sports,” Lovo said Monday at the Touchdown Club after he was officially introduced as the seventh full-time athletic director in University of Colorado history. “I just figured out early on that my own athletic career — if you even want to call it that —probably wasn’t going to be the best path forward. I found another way in. As a student at the University of Florida, I worked as a student equipment manager during some of the most successful years in that football program’s history.”\nLovo, 37, has come a long way from washing towels and folding jerseys at Florida and now is set to lead CU athletics into a challenging future. He replaces Rick George, who is stepping down at the end of the school year but will assist Lovo in the transition.\n“It’s a great day to be a Buff,” said Lovo, who comes to CU after 13 months as the athletic director at New Mexico. “Thank you for the incredibly warm welcome that my family and I have already received from this amazing University of Colorado community. We’re humbled, grateful, and truly honored to be here.”\nLovo will be tasked with navigating CU athletics through what is projected as a significant budget deficit for this fiscal year while a new era of college athletics featuring unrestrained player movement, shifting eligibility rules and direct NIL/revenue payments continues to evolve.\n“There’s a lot that’s been changing by the minute, by the second,” Lovo said. “The good news for me is I can utilize Rick and the knowledge that he’s been able to gather in terms of where we are as an institution, as a department, and as a (Big 12) conference. I think we have a really strong conference. But I think early on we’ve gotta find ways to increase our revenue and to support all of our sports, because we have great coaches here; that much I do know.”\nCU’s coaching roster is headlined by head football coach Deion “Coach Prime” Sanders, who was in attendance at the press conference along with many other CU head coaches, including Tad Boyle (men’s basketball), JR Payne (women’s basketball), Jesse Mahoney (volleyball) and Danny Sanchez (soccer).\n“We need to make sure that we’re providing them with all the resources that they need to excel and win championships,” Lovo said. “I believe this is a brand where we can win championships across the board, and I think it’s become increasingly more challenging in this new age of college athletics to have success holistically across your department. But I’m resolute in my belief and in my desire to have championships across all our sports, and I’m really looking forward to getting to work on that and finding creative and innovative solutions to provide us with a competitive edge over our opponents.”\nGeorge, who sat in the front row with his wife, Nancy, has led CU for nearly 13 years, guiding the Buffs through numerous challenges and changes, including the COVID-19 pandemic, a move from the Pac-12 to Big 12 in 2024, and the hiring of Coach Prime in 2022.\nChancellor Justin Schwartz, who led the efforts to hire Lovo, thanked George for what he has done for CU, while adding that it was important to find a strong leader to take the baton and elevate CU athletics.\n“Fernando is the perfect leader to guide CU athletics into the new era of college athletics marked by dramatic change, including the evolution of name, image, and likeness (NIL), revenue sharing, and unrestricted transfers,” Schwartz said. “In an environment that changes seemingly by the minute, Fernando’s track record of innovation and adaptability makes him uniquely qualified for these complex times.”\nLovo had an eventful and successful 13-month run at New Mexico and thanked a lot of people at UNM for giving him the opportunity to be an athletic director for the first time. He jumped at the opportunity to take a step up, however, when he signed his five-year, $6 million deal ($1.2 million per year) with CU last week.\n“To me, this is a destination job,” Lovo said. “This is an unbelievable, first and foremost, academic institution that has an iconic brand, one that’s recognizable not just here in the United States, but across the globe. Those opportunities don’t come along very often. … This was the just a perfect opportunity for me and for my family.”\nWhile Lovo and his wife, Jordan, begin the process of finding a new home and a school for their two young children, Lovo will hit the ground running at CU.\n“This moment in college athletics demands innovation in how we generate revenue, how we pursue competitive excellence, and how we adapt to change,” he said. “Colorado athletics is uniquely positioned to lead in this space, and I am excited to take advantage of that opportunity.”",
