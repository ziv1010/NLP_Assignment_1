  "body_text": "Carla Ward, the new Irish women’s soccer manager, says she may have a new role for star player Katie McCabe, possibly at left back. Ward said: ‘‘I have seen Katie play a certain role for Arsenal which I think she can also be effective in for the national team. But it’s making sure there are players for other positions. Certainly there are conversations to be had, but I think Katie can be utilized in a different way.’’ The Englishwoman, a former midfielder herself, added: ‘‘You cannot say a Carla Ward team is not exciting. We like the players to play with a lot of freedom. What you will see from the team now compared to previous years is a very different way of playing. Energy is number one. It will be aggressive in some phases, compact in others, but exciting to play and watch.’’\nMeanwhile Irish international Ruesha Littlejohn is looking for a new club after parting ways with London City Lionesses last week. The 34-year-old signed for the Women’s Championship club in August 2023 from Aston Villa, but after being left out of the squad on two occasions this month, she has now departed London City at the season’s mid-way point. The London club, who have Irish internationals Megan Campbell and Grace Moloney on their books, remain in the hunt for promotion to the top-flight and they currently sit in second place. Littlejohn, who hails from Glasgow, has won 85 Irish caps, had previous spells at Glasgow City, Celtic, London Bees and Birmingham. She will be anxious to find a new club before new Irish manager Caral Ward names her squad for next month’s Nations League games against Turkey and Slovenia.\nMURPHY GOES ON\nLOAN TO BOLTON\nIreland under 21 defender Alex Murphy wants to prove he’s ready for regular first-team football after departing Newcastle United for a loan move to Bolton Wanderers. The Galway man will spend the rest of the season on loan at the League One club and is looking to build on his experience at Newcastle so far, having earned his EPL debut under Eddie Howe last season. The 20-year-old from Annaghdown, has established himself as a regular for the Magpies under 21 team since arriving from Galway United in July 2022. After his top-flight debut last term, this season Murphy made four EPL match-day squads before Christmas and was on the bench for the first-team’s FA Cup third round win earlier this month. He was also rewarded with a new long-term contract on Tyneside last May. Now, with Bolton chasing a play-off spot this season, Murphy feels the time is right for him to depart St James’ Park and begin playing regular senior football. He said: “I’ve been around the first team at Newcastle for maybe a year and a bit now, so I have learned a lot from them and training with the first team.’’\nMCMANUS QUITS\nAFTER 18 YEARS\nMonaghan legend Conor McManus has retired from intercounty football. The 37-year-old three-time All Star has informed the Monaghan management of his decision to step away from top flight football. McManus confirmed his retirement in a statement released by Monaghan GAA , saying, ‘‘It has been my privilege of a lifetime to play for Monaghan the past 18 years. Days I will never forget, lifelong memories and friendships made with the boys.’’\nDERRY CITY BOOST\nFROM DERRY GAA\nDerry City has secured permission to train at the Derry GAA’s Center of Excellence in Owenbeg. The decision was rubber stamped at a recent meeting of the GAA’s Central Council and it means that the League of Ireland club can use the facility as a temporary training base until they develop their own purpose-built site. It’s good news for the Candystripes who have been pulled from pillar to post when it comes to securing training pitches in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area in recent years. New Derry City manager Tiernan Lynch reckons this decision will help develop the club’s levels of professionalism.\nIRISH STAR HEADS\nFOR STRASBOURG\nIrish international Andrew Omobamidele has joined French Ligue 1 club Strasbourg on loan from Nottingham Forest until the end of the season. The French club are owned by BlueCo, a consortium led by Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly, and they have an option to buy the player at the end of the season. Strasbourg are managed by Liam Roseinor, who also managed Derby County and Hull City. The Leixlip, Co. Kildare-born defender joined Forest from Norwich for a reported fee of £11 million in September 2023, when the club was managed by Steve Cooper. He figured in 11 Premier League games under new manager Nuno Espirito Santo, but fell out of favor in recent times and wasn’t included in the match-day squad.\nCANNON JOINS BLADES\nSheffield United have signed Republic of Ireland striker Tom Cannon on a four-year deal. The 22-year-old joins from Leicester, having scored 11 goals in 25 appearances during a loan spell at Stoke in the first half of this season. Cannon began his senior club career at Everton, impressed out on loan at Preston North End, where he scored eight times in 20 league appearances.\nThe Aintree-born Cannon, who has won two Irish caps, has agreed a deal until 2029 with the option of an extra year. He made his debut for the Blades on Friday last against Hull City, but it was not a memorable one as United were beaten 3-0 at home. So Leeds United, who were due to play Burnley on Monday night, stay a point clear of Sheffield at the top of the Championship table.\nNEW POST FOR PAUW\nSeventeen months on from being controversially dismissed by the FAI, Vera Pauw is back on the international beat as manager of the United Arab Emirates. Pauw became the first manager to lead Ireland to a major women’s tournament, the 2023 World Cup, but a combination of dressing-room mutiny and historical allegations of verbal abuse to players in the U.S., which she denies, blighted the trip to Australia. The UAE, who are renowned for issues around women’s rights, only started their female international team in 2010 and have sunk to their lowest Fifa ranking of 116th. Pauw said last week: ‘‘I was the first female to hold the UEFA pro-licence in the Netherlands. I am proud of my journey that brought me from the Euros with the Netherlands to the Olympic Games with South Africa and a maiden appearance at the World Cup with Ireland. Now I want to write a new chapter in the history of the game with fantastic people around me in the UAE.” They will compete for a place at the 2027 World Cup in Brazil through the Asian qualifiers.",
