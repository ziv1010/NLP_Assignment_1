FIFA did not run a traditional bidding contest for the 2025 edition -- instead appointing the United States to stage the 32-team event -- and has yet to outline how the 2029 host will be selected.\nCBF president Samir Xaud has framed the talks as ongoing, saying last year: 'It's a subject I discussed with president Infantino... God willing, Brazil will host the 2029 Club World Cup.'\nFor 2029, Brazil already has one club assured of a place in the tournament. Flamengo earned its spot by winning the 2025 Copa Libertadores title.\n--Field Level Media\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nFlip\nEmail\nGet a daily dose of Haiti Sun news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Haiti Sun.\nMore InformationCOLUMBIA HEIGHTS, Minnesota: A five-year-old boy was among four children detained by U.S. immigration officials from the Minneapolis...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: As a powerful winter storm snarls air travel across much of the United States, thousands of passengers are discovering...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: After years of regulatory pressure and legal uncertainty, TikTok has secured a path to remain operational in the...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: Despite many U.S. allies opting not to participate, U.S. President Donald Trump inaugurated his Board of Peace that...\nLOS ANGELES, California: Brooklyn Beckham, the son of David and Victoria Beckham, has accused his parents of trying to sabotage his...\nSYDNEY, New South Wales, Australia - Two foreign nationals are under police guard and facing life imprisonment after allegedly attempting...\nNEW YORK, New York - U.S. stocks edged higher on Monday, but the dollar continued to be hammered, while gold shot up past $5,100 an...\nNEW DELHI, India: After two earlier requests were rejected by the Government of India, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: After years of regulatory pressure and legal uncertainty, TikTok has secured a path to remain operational in the...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: A high-profile legal fight has erupted between the White House and Wall Street, with U.S. President Donald Trump...\nSAN FRANCISCO, California: Google is offering users a deeper level of personalization in its search engine, allowing its artificial...\nSAN FRANCISCO, California: Amazon is preparing to deepen a significant restructuring of its white-collar workforce, with another wave...",
