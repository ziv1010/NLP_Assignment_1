Scores were locked at 0-0 at halftime. Cundletown striker Bee Dargen then got in behind the defensive line to score the only goal of the game.\n\"We had a few opportunities to score from there, but just couldn't convert,'' Cundletown president Carissa Black said.\nThis was the first time the Jets have downed Tuncurry-Forster this season.\n\"The first game was a 0-0 draw and they beat us 2-0 a few weeks ago,'' Carissa said.\n\"Tuncurry's a very strong defensive team and we had to re-think our strategy to get through them.''\nYoungster Eva Greenaway was busy in defence for the Jets while Josie Mays in the midfield did a power of work to get the side going forward.\nThe Jets have appeared in the last eight grand finals. They've played Tuncurry-Forster Gold in seven of them and Gold will start favourites for Friday night's final against Palms. The match will be played at South Street, Tuncurry at 8.20pm.\nGrand finals will be at Tuncurry on Friday, September 13.",
