Soon after all negotiations between the two parties were ended. They have not resumed in the six months since.\nREAD THE STORIES HERE\nRevealed - Birmingham bin drivers offered £10,000 'compensation' to go quietly and end strike\nWhatsApp messages between council chief and Unite boss 'prove commissioners running strike deal’\nThe bin strike has had huge ramifications inside the city council, with fingers pointed at the Labour leadership for their failure to end the dispute.\nThere were more barbs for the current leaders when a list of their selected candidates was revealed to stand in the 2026 election for Labour. Several veteran councillors were axed in a cull, triggering defections and fury. Questions were also asked about the credibility of some of those who had been chosen to stay and fight for Labour.\nSitting MPs were accused of influencing the choices unfairly - with Erdington MP Paulette Hamilton among those later accused of exercising nepotism to get relatives and allies chosen for seats deemed 'safe' for Labour.\nREAD MORE: Massive Labour shocks at Birmingham City Council as veteran councillors axed by party\nREAD MORE: Anger as Birmingham Labour MP faces nepotism claim over choice of council candidates\nThis was also the month when alternatives to the mainstream parties in Birmingham began to plot and prepare for the 2026 local election battles.\nBirmingham MP Ayoub Khan was at the centre of the launch of new left wing party Your Party with Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana. It was to later run into turmoil but Khan remains keen for the project to prosper into 2026.\nMeanwhile, pro-Palestine independents across the city were coalescing around Akhmed Yakoob and Shakeel Afsar, two prominent figures in Birmingham politics.\nLabour defectors were checking out both options - where many of them end up will become clear early in the new year.\nNigel Farage's Reform UK also set out its stall. The party held its conference in the city and its regional director revealed a plan to stand a Reform candidate in every council seat in the region, including all 101 seats in Birmingham.\nReform to stand in every council seat in Birmingham and Black Country in massive push for power\nIn a sudden, unexpected move, the lead commissioner who had been sent in to oversee troubled Birmingham City Council, Max Caller, announced his retirement. He had been a controversial presence in the city, as was clear from the reaction to his departure.\nThe month ended on a low note, when much loved Moseley campaigner and city councillor Kerry Jenkins died after a short but devastating illness.\nAUGUST\nAway from the Birmingham political bubble, I received a tip-off about a children's home in the area that was badly letting down young people left in its care, at considerable public expense. What was then uncovered was a catalogue of misery, with children going missing and unsafe from properties which were utterly lacking in homely comforts.\nThe exposure and the negative headlines forced councils to reconsider placing children with the firm involved and soon after all five of its properties in the West Midlands were shut down.\nBREAKING: Children's homes where kids went 'missing overnight' shut down after sex attack claim\nThe summer sunshine triggered a new phenomenon across city communities - the raising of the flags of the Union and St George on lamp-posts. Before long hundreds of flags had appeared on major routes and housing estates across south Birmingham, rapidly spreading across the country.\nThe flagging of the city posed a massive dilemma for politicians, desperate not to label patriots as racists. They relied on public safety concerns to press for their removal, but that only seemed to inspire more flags to go up.\nNot everyone liked this show of patriotism, nor the clear links that were evident between the flags and right wing politics, particularly anti migrant fervour. Many of those actively putting them up were also involved in protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers. In this article I sought to present the differing views.\nREAD MORE: 'We are patriotic not racist' - passions high as England and Union flags line Birmingham streets\nREAD MORE: West Midlands 'more divided and hateful' warning as racism 'going unchallenged'\nThe biggest concern was that heavily flagged areas gave people the impression of being a 'white British' enclave, with those not happy with them branded as 'non patriots' and 'lefties'. There were later direct confrontations in some parts of the city between those for and against the flagging.\nSEPTEMBER\nIn September the region was shook by a racist rape reported by a young Sikh woman in Oldbury. The case remains unsolved.\nAlso this month, a whistleblower exposed new delays and problems with Birmingham's 'Oracle' IT project - the same one that had already ballooned from a £20 million scheme to one cost in excess of £200 million. My expose about the problem triggered an emergency meeting of the council's audit committee. Worryingly, the issue has still not been resolved.\nRoad safety was on our minds a lot in 2025, after a series of high profile crashes and hit and run incidents resulting in deaths and serious injuries.\nAs a result we launched the first of a series of campaigns on the topic - calling for a lifetime ban for killer and hit-and-run drivers who kill and maim.\nYou can read all about it here: Ban killer drivers for life\nWe also spotlighted some of the worst offenders. The killer drivers so bad we say 'ban them for life'\nOCTOBER\nEarly in the month of October, four Birmingham Labour councillors quit their party in stinging resignations.\nSoon after, the party also had to disown one of its remaining councillors after it was revealed he had attended the wedding of his brother in Pakistan who at the time was a fugitive who had fled justice over a drug running operation out of Birmingham. Saqib Khan was 'unselected' as a 2025 candidate as a result.\nHe wasn't the only councillor to face questions. Cllr Waseem Zaffar was to later deny any wrongdoing himself after pictures emerged of him socialising with a wanted fugitive said to be allegedly involved in a massive drug running operation out of Birmingham Airport. The Labour Party stood by him over the affair, accepting he had no idea about the criminal history of the man.\nWe kept up our focus on road deaths and injuries in the city, telling the heartbreaking story of the Birmingham mum who saw her four year old killed when they were both run down by a driver near their home in Highgate.\nREAD MORE: Birmingham mum relives moment killer driver struck four year old, ending life 'in a second'\nIn mid October another row erupted - this time when a Birmingham council-led safety advisory group and West Midlands Police agreed to ban fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv from a Europa League tie with Aston Villa.\nAmid claims of antisemitism and calls for the police chief to resign, we picked over the details.\nREAD MORE: Missed chances to halt Maccabi Tel Aviv Villa Park fan ban revealed - and why no-one did\nElsewhere, there was a row inside Greater Birmingham Chamber of Commerce over racism.\nA bigger racism furore was stirred up by Conservative MP Robert Jenrick who spoke disparagingly about Handsworth.\nHis comments about a lack of 'white faces' triggered a massive backlash.\nThe continued proliferation of unauthorised flags in parts of the city was also continuing to cause division. One man in Alvechurch tried to do something about it - only to get threats and anger directed at him as a result. Meanwhile, the council began to recruit staff to go out under cover of darkness and take them down.\nSome of our coverage of the flags issue:\nCouncil recruits staff to take them down\nBirmingham flag wars erupt in quiet village as defiant dad faces death threats\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting was in the city just as claims emerged he was mounting a leadership bid to take on Prime Minister Keir Starmer. There will be much more of this in 2026, especially if Labour performs badly in the local elections.\nNOVEMBER\nThe Villa-Maccabi Tel Aviv match furore escalated. The game itself passed off relatively peacefully, with no injuries and a handful of arrests, but the fallout from the ban continues even now.\nAmong the follow up articles about the saga, I pulled together the truth about the intelligence used by West Midlands Police to prompt the ban on Maccabi fans, though that has also now been disputed.\nElsewhere, up in Sutton Coldfield a hotel that once was used as the setting for 1980s soap Crossroads was at the centre of protests over asylum seekers. In this exclusive, I suggested campaigners should pay more attention to the hotel's profiteering owners than its inhabitants, with millions raked in each year from the Home Office.\nREAD MORE: Sutton Coldfield hotel owners make millions from asylum seeker contracts\nBut the big story of the month was the unveiling of the vision for the new Blues stadium in east Birmingham. Knighthead, owners of Birmingham City FC, revealed their extraordinary, iconic new landmark for the city - it divided opinion, but everyone was agreed it would be a gamechanger for the city's prospects.\nBirmingham City new stadium - live\nBlues new stadium is unmistakeably Birmingham - but there's a problem\nDECEMBER\nIt was hardly a festive tale - but it was one that has triggered an outporing of inquiries and tip offs, which will form the focus of a new investigation in the new year into the supported accommodation sector. Administrators brought in to oversee the future of an 'insolvent' Birmingham supported housing firm claim they encountered shocking incidents of threats, harassment, break-ins, arson attacks and deception.\nI also told the story of the skiving Birmingham binman secretly filmed working as bouncer and playing football\nAnd as the new year loomed, Birmingham City Council unveiled its plans to transform its bins services, with or without striking workers. The switch to fortnightly collections will begin in June. READ ALL ABOUT IT HERE\nThe equal pay bill was finally settled by the council - in this long read I shared the story of the union activist who didn't get to see the fruits of her efforts to get justice for women.\nREAD MORE: Birmingham council chiefs told 'come up with urgent plan to end bin strike' by government fixers\nIn a joyous finale to the year, BirminghamLive readers helped us and our partner charities to deliver 14,500 gifts to children in need across Birmingham under our #Brumwish initiative.
