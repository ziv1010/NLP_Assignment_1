FIFA gave away thousands of tickets and some games attracted as few as 7,000 fans, although Football Ferns matches broke records for a soccer crowd in the country.\nFUNDING GAP\nAustralia’s players, who lost 2-0 in a third-place playoff match to Sweden on Saturday, will earn $165,000 each in prize money for this tournament, more than 300 times the A$750 ($480) they received for a quarter-final appearance in 2015.\nBut at the grassroots level, the sport needs more resources, Matildas striker Sam Kerr said after the loss to England on Wednesday.\n“We need funding in our development, we need funding in our grassroots,” she said.\n“We need funding, you know, we need funding everywhere.”\nThe Matildas’ World Cup campaign has led to calls for more support to women’s soccer in Australia, where it lags more popular football codes like rugby league and Australian rules.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese responded on Saturday by promising A$200 million for women’s sport in the wake of the Matildas’ run to the semi-finals.\nAlbanese said the money would be used to improve sports facilities for women and girls, with soccer tipped to receive “significant resourcing”.\nThe government also wants to ensure women’s sporting events are available on free-to-air television, after criticism that most World Cup games not involving Australia were behind a paywall.\n($1 = 1.5618 Australian dollars)\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\nYour children are starving, and you giving away their food to an already fat pussycat.\nFeb 14, 2026\n(Reuters) – Australia were dealt an early blow in their quest to reach the Super Eight stage of the Twenty20 World Cup after the depleted former champions crashed to a 23-run defeat by Zimbabwe...Feb 14, 2026\n(Kaieteur News) – Georgetown has always possessed the air of a place living on memory.
