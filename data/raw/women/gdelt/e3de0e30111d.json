  "body_text": "The Angel City Football Club begins the second half of the 2023 season against Southern California rival San Diego Wave FC.\nThe teams reached the end of the first 11 games of the 22-game season at opposite ends of the NWSL standings. San Diego (6-3-2, 20 points) is tied for first place. Angel City (2-6-3, nine points) is in 11th place, but tied for last on points, one reason why the club made the big move Wednesday of firing Coach Freya Coombe.\nThe second meeting between the teams is set for Saturday (1 p.m., CBS/2) at Snapdragon Stadium.\n“We are at our halfway point right now. We want to take advantage of the remainder of the second half of this season, and I felt that a change was needed at this time and because of that we decided to make sure that we had every opportunity to go into this game this weekend with a focus,” General Manager Angela Hucles Mangano said.\nAngel City enters the game with only one win in the last 12 games, which includes three Challenge Cup games. Injuries have been a factor (Jun Endo is sidelined with a knee injury, Katie Johnson suffered a knee injury last week and will not be available and Christen Press is still working her way back.)\nReplacing Coombe will be Becki Tweed, who joined Angel City as an assistant this season. She was a member of Gotham FC’s staff under Coombe and also an assistant with the U.S. U-20 women’s team last year.\n“I think the energy that she brings, the focus, the attention to detail is already making a great impact with this group,” Mangano said of Tweed.\nMangano said Tweed will be the interim coach “until a permanent head coach is found.”\n“We are going to have a search and we will see what that will bring,” she said. “But again, the focus right now is for Becki to lead this group.”\nAngel City has some work to do as of now to climb into the sixth and final playoff position or better. Angel City is eight points behind sixth-place North Carolina.\n“We have the pieces, but I think so far what we haven’t been able to do is complete performances,” Tweed said. “The goal is to complete a 100-minute performance. You’ve seen spells this season where we’ve been excellent and spells where we’ve taken our foot off the gas. The goal for us is to now move forward and complete performances from minute one to minute 100.”\nThis is the second meeting between the rivals this season. Wave FC defeated Angel City, 2-0, on April 23 thanks to goals in the 70th and 75th minute.\n“It doesn’t take much for our group to get up against San Diego,” Mangano said. “The energy has been very good this week. I think it is going to continue into this week, and using that momentum and the strategy and approach will hopefully wield good results.”\nDefender and captain Ali Riley, a Los Angeles native, repeatedly said during Friday’s media call that the team is focusing on San Diego. She also thanked Coombe for the opportunity to captain the hometown club.\n“Coming home and representing Angel City is something I’m so proud of and feel very privileged and lucky to be experiencing this,” she said. “I’ve gained so much by being here and for (Coombe) to have that belief in me to name me captain, I will always be grateful for that and to her.”\nANGEL CITY FC AT SAN DIEGO\nWhen: Saturday, 1 p.m.\nWhere: Snapdragon Stadium\nTV: CBS (Ch. 2)",
