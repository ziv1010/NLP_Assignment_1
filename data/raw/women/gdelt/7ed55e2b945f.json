  "body_text": "Winning a major tournament is not about your ceiling, it’s about your floor.\nEngland have rarely played exhilarating football at this Women’s World Cup, with the exception of the 6-1 victory over China in the final group game. Against knockout-stage-quality opposition, Sarina Wiegman’s side haven’t offered a performance as majestic as, say, Japan in their 4-0 thrashing of Spain, or Sweden in the first half of their 2-1 win over Japan, or even Nigeria in the second half of their 3-2 win over Australia.\nAdvertisement\nAll those victorious sides, however, have now been eliminated. England have not and, over the course of two years under Wiegman’s management, we have seen how difficult they are to beat, having lost once in 38 games.\nThe list of managers who have tried and failed to beat England during her time in charge is growing by the week. Brazil’s Pia Sundhage watched her side draw the Finalissima at Wembley in April before losing on penalties, and she was impressed with what she saw.\n“They are so good, whatever they do,” she said. “If you look at the passing patterns, we know them but we’re one step behind and there they are. England are so comfortable in the way they play — just look at the Euros. Even if you and I know exactly how it is going to go… the ball is played there, I should be there and everybody knows. But England will be successful.”\nThe Lionesses’ solid base has helped them become an excellent tournament side, not because they always play well, but because they never play terribly. But how?\nFew managers know how to get through major tournaments quite like Wiegman. This is, remarkably, her fourth straight European Championship or World Cup where she’s reached the final — two with the Netherlands and two with England. The common theme has been a fine defensive record. Her Netherlands side conceded once in five matches before a 4-2 win over Denmark in the Euro 2017 final and three times in six matches before a 2-0 loss to the USWNT in the 2019 World Cup final.\nGO DEEPER\nVivianne Miedema: Wiegman has evolved but this is how she will handle World Cup final\nWith England, it was two concessions in five matches before a 2-1 win over Germany in the final of Euro 2022 and this year there have been three concessions in six matches so far. Of those three goals, one was a penalty and two were unstoppable long-range efforts. Overall, in the 22 matches leading up to the final, Wiegman’s sides have kept 13 clean sheets. In nine matches, they’ve conceded once. Never have they conceded twice. Wiegman’s sides don’t always sparkle, but they never collapse.\nDespite her teams being defensively strong, they are never defensive. They generally take the game to the opposition. They are patient in their build-up play, asserting control in the opposition half. They usually defend with a high line. And yet England are rarely caught out, despite — or because of — a major system change midway through the tournament, from 4-3-3 to 3-5-2. We also have to take into account the absence of Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Fran Kirby — three surefire starters.\nAdvertisement\n“I think Sarina Wiegman is exceptional,” says Jill Ellis, who coached the U.S. to success at the previous two World Cups. “She’s made big adjustments within the tournament. And from the Euros to now, you’ve got players like Alessia Russo starting, you had Lauren James starting. These were players that weren’t starting. So she’s not only brought that talent on to be starters a year later, but they’ve shone; they’ve done exceptionally well.\n“I think she’s managed this tournament close to perfect. She’s done a remarkable job and her staff have done a remarkable job, as well as the players they’ve brought in. They adjusted during the tournament when they played China. They found ways to win at times. They’ve come back from being behind. And it’s tough to go out and play in front of 75,000 people that are not cheering for you. So we’ve got to give full credit to England and their staff. Sarina has managed an incredible tournament.”\nGO DEEPER\nHow Sarina Wiegman manages - by those who've experienced it\nBelief is an abstract concept which is hard to measure, but the England players have an aura about them. It is not an arrogant swagger but a gentle breeze of unwavering belief.\n“Sarina makes you feel on top of the world and confidence can go a long way for a footballer,” Beth Mead tells The Athletic.\nDespite the challenges England have encountered in this World Cup, they have never crumbled. Prior to Wiegman’s reign, they would have done.\nThe manager has created a collective who really know each other. One of her buzzwords is “connections” and that is why when she first came in as England boss in September 2021, she created a safe environment so each player and staff member could express themselves.\nThe England manager sent players off in pairs to find out more about each other, the theory being the connections would transcend to the pitch.\nIn high-pressure moments, you need calm heads. Wiegman and her assistant, Veurink, do not yell. The players feel their reassurance on the sidelines and in team talks. Wiegman knows that if she prepares well and has planned for different scenarios, then she’ll feel calm, but, most importantly, she has learned how to conduct herself from experience.\nAdvertisement\nThe Dutch duo are quick to recognise what to do in various situations. Veurink, a very good tactical reader of the game, will spot minor details that can have a big impact. They keep instructions simple and to the point.\nWiegman is also a master of creating a tight-knit team, especially in tournaments. She keeps her squad focused on themselves and never gets carried away with the noise or added pressure from the outside. “She will not leave an opening for anyone who is outside the team,” Arvid Smit, who was Wiegman’s assistant coach with the Netherlands, says. “That’s impossible. That’s what makes her team so strong. You are together with staff and players and there’s nothing going out and in. She manages that really well.”\nAlthough they have not hit top form, England players have a licence to play with freedom and enjoy their football. It sounds simple, but a happy person is a happy footballer. There are patterns of play but it’s not overly prescriptive. Players under Wiegman express themselves.\n“That’s one thing I’ve really loved about her coming in,” said Millie Bright last year. “You don’t feel pressured to play a certain pass — whatever you see it’s your decision and the team goes with it. If it’s wrong, you learn to make a better decision next time. I feel really free to be able to play like that and it gives me confidence. Football changes in every second of the game. You can’t be predictable. We have game plans but being able to express ourselves has taken us to another level.”\nWhen Wiegman was asked why Russo and Lauren Hemp are playing so well together up front in the aftermath of the 3-1 win over Australia, she was keen to stress it is because they have “complementary” qualities.\nThe same might be said of her defence. Last year’s centre-back duo of Bright and Williamson worked so effectively because they offered completely different skills. Bright was the aerially dominant centre-back who was impossible to beat, while Williamson was the reader of the game who distributed the ball forward intelligently.\nThis year’s balance at the back works even better. Now using a back three, Wiegman is fielding three completely different players in defence. Bright remains in position in the middle, always there to clear the ball. To her right, Jess Carter is England’s best one-on-one defender and good at covering ground quickly. On the left, Alex Greenwood offers a left-footed option, particularly important considering that left wing-back Rachel Daly is right-footed.\nEngland also protect the defence very well, regardless of whether Keira Walsh is on her own with two midfielders ahead or Georgia Stanway is positioned alongside her. They have an excellent understanding and England seldom leave space between the lines.\nAdvertisement\nConsistency of selection was a key tenet in Wiegman’s approach last year. Things have varied more at the World Cup with that major system alteration, chopping and changing to find her best XI in the group stage and the absences of James and Walsh through injury and suspension respectively. But since settling on the 3-5-2, Wiegman has kept the same XI together when possible. She’s retained faith in Russo, who was slightly misfiring in the group stage. She’s stuck with Daly at left wing-back, despite concerns about her against the trickery of Nigeria and Colombia.\nMost interestingly, Wiegman has used substitutes very sparingly. In the age of five substitutes, she has used just 2.7 per game, the joint-lowest in the competition. She’s introduced a substitute 17 times in total at this tournament, a significant difference from the approach of Spain boss Jorge Vilda, who has used 29.\nThat’s partly because England’s games have been tighter going into the final stages, whereas Spain’s first four were all over at an early stage. But Wiegman isn’t looking to turn to fresh legs to restore a lead. In the aftermath of the 2-1 win over Colombia, she indicated she was reluctant to use substitutes unnecessarily because they might take time to adjust to the tempo of the game. She believes a consistent XI is more solid.\nConsideration must also be given to England’s set-piece defending. They are yet to concede from a dead-ball situation in tournament football under Wiegman, although Lucy Bronze’s handball against China that led to England’s only concession of the group stage from the penalty spot did come from a corner. Bright and Bronze are England’s best defenders in that sense — Carter and Greenwood are reliable too — while Russo and Daly effectively both bring the aerial power you expect of No 9s.\nIf either side are to put on a true footballing exhibition in Sunday’s final, it is likely to be the tiki-taka specialists from Spain. But great football rarely wins tournaments. Wiegman’s way often does.\n(Top photo: Naomi Baker – The FA/The FA via Getty Images)",
