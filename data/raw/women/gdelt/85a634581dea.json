  "body_text": "Good Monday morning. This is Rosa Prince.\nSCOOP: Respected former BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Danny Shaw starts a new role today as Senior Political Adviser to Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.\nWE GOT YOU: Forgot to watch Laura K? No idea when the Rwanda plan is coming back or what Boris Johnson will say at the COVID Inquiry? Tune into Politics at Jack and Sam’s and let POLITICO’s Jack Blanchard and Sky’s Sam Coates guide you through the week to come.\nDRIVING THE DAY\nTHE GENTLEMAN’S NOT FOR TURNING: Fresh from praising Margaret Thatcher, Keir Starmer today delivers a major speech in which he’ll warn a Labour government would not “turn on the spending taps.” In his first major economic pronouncement since the autumn statement, the Labour leader will paint a bleak picture of the economy he expects to inherit, saying this would lead to “constraints” on the party’s capacity to splash the cash. His words will do little to smooth feathers ruffled by his weekend paean to the Iron Lady.\nDon’t tell Truss: Starmer will put some flesh on the bones of his economic vision, saying: “Growth must become Labour’s obsession.” His words splash the Guardian, which notes the Labour leader and his Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves have not yet decided whether they will ape Tony Blair and Gordon Brown by promising to match Tory spending plans. Here’s the write-up.\n**A message from Airbnb: Airbnb backs new, modern rules for short-term lets in England. Find out more.**\nYou wot? Starmer will outline his theory of “securonomics,” underlined by five principles to secure growth, including competitive business taxes and planning reform.\nNot convinced: In response to the speech briefing, Tory Chair Richard Holden said: “The largest ‘constraint’ to growing the economy would be Labour’s £28 billion a year borrowing plan — which independent economists warn would see inflation, interest rates and people’s taxes rise.”\nHowever … A new YouGov poll to mark the launch of the Inclusive Growth Commission and reported in the Telegraph shows Labour is more trusted than the Conservatives to grow the economy. One in four thinks Labour can get the economy firing again, while only one in five said the Tories had the best policies for growth. That leaves an awful lot who either don’t know, or don’t have much faith in either party to deliver.\nTiming timings: Starmer’s speech takes place before an audience of economists and think tankers at the launch of the Resolution Foundation Economy 2030 event at the QEII at 2 p.m. He’ll then take part in a Q&A with The Economist’s Editor-in-chief Zanny Minton Beddoes, followed by questions from the press. Earlier at the conference, Minton Beddoes has a fireside chat with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt at 10.15 a.m. Other speakers at the event include Tory peer David Willetts and First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford. Full schedule here.\nKEIR HEARTS MAGGIE: Starmer will no doubt be asked during the question and answer session about his praise for Thatcher’s success in “setting loose our natural entrepreneurialism.” His words sparked an angry response both inside and out of the party Sunday, to an extent LOTO perhaps wasn’t entirely prepared for. Starmer will probably worry less about the usual suspects: lefty MPs, the SNP and Momentum, and more about the response from the faithful Mirror, which splashes on the backlash to his words. The tabloid’s leader warns Starmer sternly that he’s “playing with fire” with his Maggie love-in.\nSurely not: Starmer insisted on the BBC’s Broadcasting House that his words don’t “mean I agree with what she did.” TBF, it’s worth pointing out that even pretty left-wing commentators have praised Thatcher in the past — here’s looking at you, Owen Jones.\nIN MEMORIAM: Heartfelt tributes from across the political divide have been paid to Labour peer Glenys Kinnock, who died Saturday after many years with Alzheimer’s. Her husband, former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, was said to be with her at the end. Here’s the announcement from their son, MP Stephen Kinnock. The Mirror’s Matt Roper has a nice obit.\nTributes: Here’s Keir Starmer’s statement on behalf of the entire party; David Lammy remembered watching the inauguration of Barack Obama alongside the Kinnocks; Matt Foot tweeted a fab pic of Glenys with his uncle, former Labour leader Michael Foot. The Green’s Caroline Lucas recalled their time in the European Parliament; Tony and Cherie Blair described her as “full of fun.” Plus Harriet Harman, Sadiq Khan, Rhun ap Iorwerth, Liz Kendall, Pat McFadden, Alastair Campbell and Yvette Cooper all paid tribute.\nABCS BEFORE 123S: Labour may cancel Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s proposed baccalaureate-style Advanced British Standard, the exam the PM wants to replace A-Levels, Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson “hinted” in an interview with the FT. Instead, Phillipson said, she would prefer to improve math in primary schools.\nINTERVENE BEFORE BREAKFAST: My POLITICO colleague Stefan Boscia has interviewed Shadow Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, and reckons his appointment means Labour is up for a spot of “Bidenomics” — aping the interventionist approach of U.S. President Joe Biden. “I do think the world has just changed and we’ve got to reflect that,” he told Stefan.\nBACK TO STARMER: The Labour leader returned from the COP28 summit in Dubai Sunday, having seen world leaders including U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry, Fatih Birol of the International Energy Agency, Hillary Clinton and U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, with whom he discussed the situation in the Middle East.\nKeir in control: Rishi Sunak may have spent less than a day at COP, my POLITICO colleague Suzanne Lynch writes in to say, but Starmer was making the most of his time on the international stage, pressing the flesh all around town. A few hours after Sunak jetted out, Starmer attended an event held by Freuds Friday night (Ed Miliband was also present, as were Stella McCartney and John Kerry). “Everyone just flocked to Keir,” one senior business executive told Suzanne. “You could sense the transfer of power.”\nBilaterals: Starmer also held a bilateral meeting with Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Teresa Ribera — a big deal in the climate change world, and an EU figure with a key role at COP because Spain holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU. Miliband also attended the half-hour meeting. The two spoke about the left’s approach to climate change, a Spanish official told POLITICO, with Starmer interested in the Sánchez government’s initiatives on climate change over the past five years.\nCharm offensive: As well as doing the “prime minister-in-waiting” act by meeting international figures — such as Brazil’s President Lula da Silva, Kerry and the Emir of Qatar (among others) — Starmer also held a roundtable with energy businesses and investors. Top the agenda: Labour’s (extremely stretching) 2030 green investment goal.\nNot the line: Meanwhile, the, er, rather off message suggestion from President of COP28 Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, who also happens to be head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, that there is “no science” to suggest phasing out fossil fuels is needed to limit global warming to 1.5C rather overshadowed the conference at the weekend.\nSUNAK SPEAKS\nCOPPING OFF: Blink and you’d have missed it, but Rishi Sunak was also at COP, although he spent rather more time in an environmentally unfriendly jet than he did on the ground in Dubai. And it seems clear from the embargoed reports of his chats with journalists on the plane that came out overnight that domestic matters were occupying his mind far more than the small matter of saving the planet.\nSORRY AUNTIE: Sunak’s warning during his huddle with hacks jetting to and from Dubai that the BBC must be “realistic” about future license fee increases splashes the Telegraph and the Mail, and gets a big write-up in the Sun. The fee is due to go up by £15 to £173.30 in April, but the PM’s words suggest he may block the move. BBC bosses were said by the Telegraph to be “frustrated” at his intervention, given the corporation has been through a two-year funding freeze.\nWhat will Lucy say? Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer is on the morning round and will no doubt be asked about both the Beeb and the proposed sale of the Telegraph. Timings below.\nBROAD CHURCH NEWS: Sunak seemed in his plane chat to leave the door open to Nigel Farage rejoining the Tories, saying in response to questions that the party was a “broad church.” Here’s the Telegraph’s take.\nThis might change things: Farage was the toast of this year’s Tory party conference, but might hugging the jungle dweller carry risks? The i reports that Sunak risks losing votes to Farage’s Reform Party, with the Brexity party up to a record 11 percent in a new BMG Research poll, which shows Labour benefitting as votes leach to Farage, particularly on the issue of immigration. There’s more Farage fare below.\nELECTION TAX FIGHT INCOMING: My colleague Charlie Cooper, who was in the huddle, writes in to say the PM set out what he sees as the choice for voters at the looming election. “There is a very clear contrast, right?” the PM said, spelling out the Tory offer as “control welfare, control spending, cut taxes.”\nLOOK AWAY NOW, RISHI SUNAK: Sunak is now bottom of the pops in the monthly Cabinet rankings league table of grassroots activists compiled by ConservativeHome. Home Secretary James Cleverly has taken a tumble down the ranks following his apparently less than staunch stance on the Rwanda policy, from first place to 22nd.\nTop of the pops: Topping the chart is Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch. She’s followed by Leader of the House Penny Mordaunt in second and Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer in third.\nTalking of Kemi: The business sec has backed a Policy Exchange report calling for more homes to be built on the green belt to tackle the housing crisis. The Telegraph has more.\nGHOSTS OF PMS PAST: Cracking story from the Mail’s Jason Groves — Boris Johnson asked the security services to draw up a commando style raid on a Dutch vaccine plant to liberate jabs he felt the EU had “stolen” and which should have ended up in British arms. Johnson will apparently refer to the boys’ own tale when he gives evidence to the COVID Inquiry from Wednesday.\nOuch: The Mail also quotes Johnson’s response to the return to government of David Cameron, saying he told a conference in Ontario that his Eton and Oxford frenemy’s return was: “great news for retreads everywhere.”\nMore Boris: The Telegraph says Johnson will reject allegations he was on hols writing his Shakespeare book in the early stages of the pandemic.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: A “wave” of senior Tory MPs will announce their retirement from the Commons after Christmas thanks to worsening polls, the Telegraph’s Ben Riley-Smith reports. He reckons that after chatting the matter over with their nearest and dearest around the tree, a “flurry” of current MPs will declare “Screw this for a game of soldiers,” and decide to stand down.\nIN THE PM’S DIARY TODAY: Nuffin. Well, No. 10 says he’s working from Downing Street. No doubt Sunak will be holed up figuring out the final details on his rejigged immigration plan, which could become clearer in the next few days.\nRwanda you want? Following the Supreme Court’s rejection of his flagship Rwanda scheme, Sunak’s response seems to be coming in two parts — Home Secretary James Cleverly is expected to fly to Rwanda as soon as today or Tuesday to agree a new treaty, while separately Sunak is drawing up legislation to effectively circumnavigate the courts by declaring Rwanda safe for asylum seekers. The question is, how hard will he go to achieve this?\nFirst the treaty: Ben Riley-Smith reports British government lawyers could be stationed in Rwandan courts as part of the new treaty to ensure the African nation keeps its commitment not to return asylum seekers from the U.K. back to their home countries if they would be in danger. Full story here. Rwanda is said to have made clear that a move which looked like the introduction of a “colonial court system” would not be acceptable.\nNot straightforward: There had been speculation in the Sunday papers that the second plank of the government’s plan, fresh legislation, could come as soon as Thursday, although both the Home Office and No. 10 sounded a little doubtful about that timescale when Playbook spoke to them Sunday night. Talks between senior government figures including Sunak, Cleverly, newly hardline Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick and Attorney General Victoria Prentis are said to be continuing.\nRoh roh: The Mail’s Matt Dathan reports on disquiet in the Home Office over any suggestion of “disapplying” asylum law from the ECHR. One official tells him that any legislation is doomed to fail, describing the Rwanda scheme as a “political gimmick that won’t work.” If that wasn’t bad enough, government lawyers are said to have warned that moves to ignore international law could be a breach of the ministerial code, a view the Mail’s Martin Beckford hears is shared with AG Prentis.\nSpring flights? When he does introduce his legislation, Sunak will say he expects to see flights in the air to Rwanda by April — potentially just a few weeks before a May election. Don’t forget, stopping the boats is one of the PM’s five pledges, and the deterrent effect of Rwanda flights are seen as key to showing the public he has a plan.\nRight on cue: Sun doyen Trevor Kavanagh says Sunak is prepared to call a snap election to settle the issue, should the House of Lords or judges block the flights once again in spring.\nHOLDEN: And if an early general election is on the cards, Tory Chair Richard Holden is up for it. He told the Express the party was going onto a “war footing” in the new year, adding that all the red wall seats the party took from Labour in 2019 can be retained. The paper splashes his words, and here’s his tweet.\nBack to the seaside? In his interview with Express Pol Ed Sam Lister, Holden also said he was reviewing other locations as well as Manchester and Birmingham for the party’s annual conference.\nQATARGATE\nQATARGATE INC: Almost a year after police raided offices and properties across Brussels in one of the biggest corruption scandals ever to hit the EU, a vast cache of leaked documents from their investigation — seen by POLITICO — uncovers the extent of the European Parliament’s money-for-influence scandal known as Qatargate.\nFile details: Key suspects including former MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri and his aide Francesco Giorgi meticulously recorded alleged attempts to manipulate the Parliament’s proceedings, according to the police files seen by my colleagues Elisa Braun, Gian Volpicelli and Eddy Wax. Read their story here. The suspects, including former MEP Eva Kaili, were also interrogated by police about their role (or lack thereof) in Qatar and Morocco’s alleged attempts to corrupt the heart of European Union democracy. Find all POLITICO’s Qatargate stories here.\nRight of reply: Morocco’s foreign affairs minister has denied the country’s involvement in the scandal and has not replied to multiple requests for comment from POLITICO. Qatar has rejected allegations it interfered in EU democracy and has also not answered to requests for comment. Cozzolino’s lawyer did not reply to a request for comment. Cozzolino has maintained his innocence. Kaili has denied all wrongdoing. “The investigation shows that Ms Kaili has never spoken of Morocco or Mauritania,” Kaili’s lawyer Michalis Dimitrakopoulos said in an email to POLITICO. “According to documents from the investigation, the Belgian secret services underlined that there was no evidence that Ms Kaili was involved in the network, or that she received any money.” Panzeri has admitted his guilt in a deal he struck with authorities in January; Giorgi has acknowledged his involvement in the schemes according to the files seen by POLITICO.\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\nCONTAMINATION COMPENSATION: Ministers are braced for a major defeat tonight after a number of Tory MPs backed Labour’s move to vote in favor of an amendment to the Victims and Prisoners’ Bill which will speed up compensation for victims of the infected blood scandal. The Sunday Times’ Caroline Wheeler had the scoop that Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves had backed the amendment by Home Affairs Committee Chair Diana Johnson.\nOn their side: Almost nine out of 10 voters think people infected and affected by the contaminated blood scandal should be entitled to compensation, YouGov polling for the Terrence Higgins Trust charity found.\nMPs on EVs: MPs will vote on the Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which requires automakers to ensure a minimum percentage of the cars they produce are electric vehicles from January 1, 2024. Rishi Sunak is pressing ahead with the ZEV despite pushing back the deadline for phasing out the production of new petrol cars (from 2030 to 2035). Around 40 Tory MPs and peers, including former Energy Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg, wrote to Sunak at the weekend, urging him to delay the move.\nCOMMON GOAL: The government has accepted the recommendations from former footballer Karen Carney’s review into women’s football, including the full professionalization of the Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship, as well as establishing a separate Board of Women’s Sports in 2024 — via the Athletic.\nDEFENSE CUTS: Defense chiefs face making further cuts to Britain’s armed forces to fill a £16.9 billion black hole in their finances, a National Audit Office report finds today. The Mail has the full story.\nKNOWING ME, KNOWING EU: Europe Minister Leo Docherty addresses MPs and MEPs at the U.K.-EU Parliamentary Partnership Assembly in parliament, saying the U.K. enjoys a “more productive” relationship with the EU since the Windsor Framework.\nTEACHER’S PET: Teachers should be “properly rewarded” to overcome a recruitment crisis, former Schools Minister Nick Gibb told the i, adding “something has to move.”\nMURKY BUSINESS: Water companies are making sewage pollution disappear from official figures as Environment Agency whistleblowers tell the BBC’s Panorama companies are wrongly downgrading pollution incidents. Labour’s Steve Reed said: “This Conservative Government has wilfully turned a blind eye to corruption at the heart of the water industry.”\nTest the water: Victims suffering sewage sickness would receive compensation under a Lib Dem amendment to the Victims and Prisoners Bill.\nNEW HORIZON: The U.K’s accession to the Horizon Europe research program is expected to be formally approved on Monday, my colleague Joseph Bambridge reports. Full story for POLITICO Pro readers here.\nOBESITY CRISIS: The Times splashes on a report by Frontier Economics commissioned by the Tony Blair Institute which finds obesity costs the economy nearly £100 billion a year.\nSW1 EVENTS: The Royal United Services Institute holds its Serious and Organized Crime Conference with speakers including National Crime Agency Director General Graeme Biggar from 9 a.m. … Reform hosts a discussion on achieving a diverse civil service with speakers including Leveling-Up, Housing and Communities Permanent Secretary Sarah Healey from 4.30 p.m. … and UK in a Changing Europe has an event on U.K.-EU relations in the House of Lords from 6 p.m.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS: Sits from 2.30 p.m. with leveling-up, housing and communities questions … and then the main business is the remaining stages of the Victims and Prisoners Bill.

Register to watch live!**\nBARRAGE OF FARAGE\nNOT ANOTHER ONE: Nigel Farage once again began his day arguing with maître d’ Fred Sirieix on ITV’s I’m A Celeb Sunday night, Playbook’s jungle correspondent Noah Keate writes. Consuming eel risotto for breakfast, Farage blamed overfishing on “European greed” while Sirieix blamed “the world,” later adding “[Farage] never answers the questions … because he’s talking bollocks.”\nLetter from afar: In an admittedly wholesome moment, Farage received a letter from his children which said “nothing has made us prouder than showing people who you really are,” though they were not shocked by him “effortlessly sinking those dirty pints.”\nStill in: The broadcaster fights another day as jockey Frankie Dettori was the first contestant voted out of the jungle — Brexit Party leader Richard Tice’s emailed plea to supporters no doubt helped keep Farage in.\nPolitically homeless: Presenters Ant and Dec said the show should do a year “without any politicians” — your correspondent sympathizes.\n**Brüssel, London, Paris... und jetzt, kommt Playbook nach Berlin!
