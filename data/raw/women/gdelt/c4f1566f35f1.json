Of course for my personally getting the news was a little bit of a shock at the time. Of course we now have to digest that and look at the bigger picture.\n\"I think everyone is going to process this information very different. Some take time, some move on very quickly. Ultimately it's football, and we move forward now.\"\nManchester City currently occupy fourth spot in the Women's Super League (WSL) standings, one point adrift from Arsenal in the Champions League qualification spots. A turbulent run of form has recently seen the Cityzens drop points to West Ham, Arsenal and Manchester United in 2025.\n\"It's a results based business. Of course you never want to see anyone lose their job, people are human beings at the end of the day. But, decisions have been made and that was the decision. The bigger picture now and the short-term picture is what we've got ahead of us,\" reasoned Greenwood.\nThe club have elected former manager, Nick Cushing, as the interim head coach for the remainder of the 2024/25 campaign. The 40-year-old led the Cityzens to WSL, League Cup and FA Cup silverware during his previous tenure at the club, before joining MLS side New York City FC.\n\"He is very much aware of the club, he's a part of the City Group, he's been here before and he knows what it takes to win,\" Greenwood said of Cushing. \"He's made that message very loud and clear right from the start, which has given a little bit of excitement for everyone. He's got a history of winning and a really positive one at this football club so I think it was a very fitting decision to bring him in.\"\nManchester City will now look ahead to a highly anticipated Subway Women's League Cup final as the side prepare to face Chelsea at Derby County's Pride Park Stadium.",
