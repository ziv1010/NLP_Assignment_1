  "body_text": "DYK: Keelon Russell took his first reps under center? And there’s even video of it!\nJumbo Package: Warde Manuel and the Playoff Committee effectively killed an expanded SEC schedule\nBlame that dunderhead, not the SEC schools.\nAs for the QB battle (which I don’t think is going to be a battle at all; I suspect it’s Ty’s unless he loses it on the field):\nRussell is the first-ever Alabama signee to win Gatorade National Football Player of the Year, a well-deserved following a senior season completing 238-of-343 (69.4%) of his passes for 4,177 yards and 55 touchdowns to four interceptions.\n“He’s got a long way to go because I think that’s the way he looks at it,” Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer said after Russell’s debut. “He’s excited about what this growth’s going to be even during this spring. But his ceiling and what he accomplished through what you can see on the high school film, he’s a pretty elite quarterback coming in as a high school senior, current freshman for us.”\nDeBoer isn’t willing to show his hand at the start of spring practice. DeBoer told Bama247 recently that this competition will not “waste reps” during the spring, but all three options will have equal opportunity to show what they’ve got with a chance to impress the coaching staff.\nI say this with some degree of trepidation and more than a little hope that Sheridan’s job title is honorific more than anything, but who wins that QB battle will likely be contingent upon the evaluation of new OC Ryan Grubb. You can tell DeBoer is pumped to have the Riggs back to his Murtaugh, the Robin to his Batman:\n“It’s someone I really trust. We see the game similarly. We’ve talked through — because we’ve been in the staff room together for so many years — the things that we value, what it takes to win, what it takes to be a great offense, how that all meshes and comes together. He’s going to put his stamp on it.”\nKDB’s complete interview appeared on Yogi Roth’s Y-Option podcast, but this is a much more relaxed coach this season, one that is more in command of the expectations of the job and the program. KDB emphasized continuity among the staff and players, the improved character of the team, and a lot of other tangentials that indicate he’s finally getting to run the program his way, with (mostly) the players he wants to go to battle with.\nDoes that mean the rebuild is over? Of course not, particularly along the lines and identifying an impact pass rusher and RB1, but after Year Zero, expect to see a more coherent product this season.\nNext up, some hoops news. And we have to start with injuries. A player we could have used (healthy) for Auburn and Tennessee won’t be available when we could also use him against the No. 3 Florida Gators: Derrion Reid:\nOn Tuesday, before Alabama’s final home game of the year against Florida on Wednesday, Nate Oats updated Reid’s status.\n“Derrion [Reid] has started back doing basketball workouts. He’s still week to week - won’t be playing tomorrow.”\nReid is averaging 7.1 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 0.8 assists per game for Alabama in 18 games so far this season. He is shooting 43.6 percent from the field and 25.7 percent from three-point range, adding another 56.6 percent from the free throw line.\nReid has started three games for Alabama this season. His top performance came against Creighton, scoring 12 points in 21 minutes of play.\nDon’t expect him back until the NCAA tourney begins, honestly. Two weeks ago, I told you one of my #sauces said he was going to be out through the balance of the SEC schedule, and aside from a three-minute gamesmanship appearance, that has held true. Alabama needs to get healthy. Beating Florida is important; advancing far in the tournament matters more.\nUnfortunately, that 3-minute stunt against Auburn, and a few other previous games with limited injury minutes, cost him a chance to medically redshirt, where a player cannot participate in the final half of the season. That is not an issue, however, for Trelly and Mallette, both of whom are expected to breeze through for a medical RS and return next year.\nReid is going to present an interesting NBA case. The physical skills are there, but this is one of the deepest college classes we’ve seen in years, and I just don’t know that it’s going to be worth his time to jump in with both feet: Reid is almost certainly not First Round material. And with the diminishing financial returns and two-way contracts of Second Rounders, he’ll probably make more in Tuscaloosa next season. You hate to see that for him, but selfishly, the Tide could use it.\nUnfortunately, in the Tide’s availability report this morning, 5th Year Sr. Grant Nelson was listed as questionable for tonight’s tilt. As hard as he played for two seasons, he deserves one final ovation in Coleman...and it’s safe to say that with the Gator’s size, Alabama has about a 0.00% chance of winning without the 6’11” Nelson in the lineup and healthy.\nI’m still pissed at Alabama for failing at the one thing that was in their control on Saturday: hitting free throws. I’m so mad about it, I can’t even muster the energy to finish the Florida preview. I literally wrote that the UT game would be decided by who was better at the line...and yet, Alabama decided to shoot its worst percentage in over a month, miss a third of their gimmes, and then add disasterpieces of brainfarts to the mix.\nCoach Oats at least took responsibility for the latter:\n“As the head coach, I’ve gotta do a better job getting us to the finish line,” Oats said. “We went through our end-of-half, end-of-game scenarios. Pointed out where we’ve gotta do better, where I’ve gotta make better decisions, where I could have done better, where they gotta execute a few things better. If we come up with similar scenarios, we’ll have a better plan.\n“The players will understand what we’re trying to do better. I’ll be better for them as a head coach. … We’re gonna own what we should have done better, starting with me. We’re gonna fix it. We’re gonna use it as an opportunity to make us a better team moving forward for the SEC Tournament, for the NCAA Tournament.\n“We will be the most prepared team for end-of-game situations moving forward, and we’ll use that to spur us on to be a better team for our run in March.”\nNo word on whether he had this team of McDonald’s All-Americans shooting 15-footers until their shoulders fell off. I’m still so damn angry about it.\nSpeaking of angry, let’s nurse that SMU grudge a bit more too:\nThe Crimson Tide had just lost the final spot to an SMU team that hadn’t played as rigorous a schedule, so adding another game against the nation’s deepest league over the past few decades didn’t sound appealing.\nNot under the current structure of playoff-team selection.\nByrne spoke to a small group of reporters Monday at the Birmingham Tip-Off Club on a few different topics. The eight- versus nine-game football schedule was among them.\\\n“All I’ll say is that we’ve scheduled a two Power Four, whatever you want to call it, non-conference games starting next year,” Byrne said. “We have Florida State, Wisconsin (next season), we did that in mind of having eight conference games. So nothing has been decided one way or the other. And you know, we’ll, we’ll probably have another discussion here, I’m guessing this spring or two and see where we land with it.”\nI’ve long been a fan of scheduling tough games, moving to 9- (even 10-game) SEC schedules and the like. (That 2020 season was so much fun, when every game mattered). And for a decade, the CFP rewarded that too. Your wins mattered more than the losses, especially quality ones — and especially having the administrative bravery to schedule out of conference toughies.\nBut under Warde Manuel, the new-look CFP completely flipped that CW on its head and rewarded two teams with SOS that were worse than some midmajor slates. So, for the second time in as many weeks, I’m going to agree with Greg Byrne on this one: There is f’ all incentive to play nine SEC games the way this rickety house of cards is assembled, and even less incentive is there to leave Bryant Denny or face other power conference teams. Play your eight home games, beat soup cans, make the playoffs. That’s what these midwits want, that’s what they’ll get.\nIt’s a net loss for the sport, sure. But everything that has been done to college football for a decade has only slowly killed the sport — we’re just molesting the cadaver at this point.\n#BOG\nThe Best Non-Battering Barker, ‘Bama’s star PG Sarah Ashlee Barker, notched something a bit rare around these parts — accolades for women’s hoops. The Senior has beasted out this season, averaging 17.3 PPG and four dimes a night, to lead the No. 20 Crimson Tide to the SEC’s 6th seed and a year-long AP ranking. For that, she was named First Team All-SEC.\nIn other less-observed news, the 12-0 Alabama Crimson Tide Baseball team makes its first appearance in the Top 25 this week. I would caution a little realism here though. Alabama’s RPI is 39th, ‘Bama has played 9 home games (and no true roadie). The road is going to get indescribably tougher in an SEC where 14 of 16 teams are ranked — including the Top 3 and four of the top six.\nFor now, enjoy the ride though. Alabama is doing what it needs to do against its dogwater schedule: blasting bad teams with piss-missile power we’ve not seen in many a’moon...and there is more than a good argument to be made that the Tide has the nation’s best position player too: Justin Lebron. Enjoy him this year, folks. He’ll be in the Show next year, and it likely cost all of Rog’s bagman money to keep him in Tuscaloosa for another season after last year’s breakout: I wish I loved anything like Tennessee, Arkansas, and LSU loved tampering.\nAllay those fears about adding poverty programs Clemson and FSU to the SEC expansion pack. They get to remain giants in a land of Lilliputians after settling their lawsuit against one another and the ACC. LOL.\nHowever, the seeds of the ACC’s destruction may have been sown in the settlement. The new model the two agreed upon makes funding contingent upon viewership — they get a little more based on eyeballs that tune in. While that’s a model that would suit a conference like the ACC, with its scant few teams drawing traffic, it’s inapplicable to the SEC, where 11 of the Top 16 markets are all in its footprint. Worth thinking about at least.\nThis take is absolute absurd: Tyler Booker is allegedly dropping because his athleticism scores were below average at the Combine:\nTyler Booker, OG, Alabama\nBooker (6’045/321) was a first round fixture in many pre-Combine mock drafts, but that may change after his eye-popping (not in a good way) testing performance this weekend. He finished at the very back in multiple metrics including a 5.38s 40-yard dash (2nd to last), 1.96s 10-yard split (last), 27” Vert (3rd to last), 7’10” broad jump (only OL under 8’0” = last), 7.96s 3-Cone (2nd to last) and a 4.84s Shuttle (5th to last). Now, these tests don’t measure his vice drop like hands that effectively neutralize opposing defenders as soon as he latches onto them. However, Booker’s all-around dreadful testing marks resulted in a troubling 39th percentile Relative Athletic Score, which is going to be difficult for prospective NFL suitors to overlook when parsing 1st round OL options. While he could invariably slip out of R1 due to his athletic limitations, an OL-needy team like New England or Chicago would likely salivate at the opportunity to add Booker to their porous offensive lines in R2 if presented the opportunity.\nYou don’t need Jesse Owens on the interior. You need 300-plus pounds of mean fatty, with hands like the Jaws of Life, and a nasty disposition. Booker fits all of the above. The NFL’s zone blocking schemes are much more in his wheelhouse than being asked to run the many slow-developing counters that Alabama incorporated this season. If the Bears or Pats decided to go lean, and work the field east-west, sure, it might be an issue (and he was notably not well-suited for it this season), but that’s not the pro game. Quick hitters, blow open a hole, protect your quarterback for 2.7 seconds — that’s it. And he’ll be fine.\nOh, no, Mark. Not like this, bro:\nThe Crimson Tide is 0-2 against its traditional rivals in Auburn and Tennessee this season, and Sears pointed out the opportunities to even those series in the regular-season finale and in the SEC Tournament.\n“We still got the SEC Tournament and we get to see Auburn,” Sears said, via Bama247. “We have Florida, obviously. We can’t overlook them. But we still have Auburn for their senior night. So we still get to see them. And then, hopefully, in the SEC Tournament we’re able to see Tennessee again and all the teams we lost to. Hopefully we’ll be able to see all the teams we lost to again.”\nNot that the Vawls or ‘Barn needed motivation or anything, but you can’t afford to give any bit of locker room material to two teams expected to be No. 1 seeds in 10 days. Just smile and nod, bruh.\nTo Sears’ credit, he played his ass off both of those games, but he’s writing collective checks for everyone here...and I’m not sure how many of these dudes are gonna’ show up already overdrawn.\nHe was baited into it, for sure. Still, Mark, man you’re like 27 years old. Gotta’ know not to do that.\nFinally, in lieu of a poll, I leave you with this provocative question:\nIt’s gotta’ be Tennessee or Auburn, right?\nHave a great morning. We’ll be back later with the Florida preview when I can shake off my lingering anger and disgust and finish it. Expect that sometime around 1 Central, is my best guess.\nRoll Tide",
