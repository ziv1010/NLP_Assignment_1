  "body_text": "Joey Barton has sparked fresh outrage with his most offensive take yet, comparing two female pundits to depraved serial killers Fred and Rose West.\nFormer England internationals Eni Aluko and Lucy Ward were part of ITV’s team that presented last night’s dour FA Cup third round tie between Crystal Palace and Everton.\nThe game produced little by way of drama, aside from the controversial sending-off of Toffees’ striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, which is set to be the subject of an appeal.\nDespite the less than incident packed 90 minutes, Barton, who once represented his country for a grand total of 12 minutes, took issue with Aluko’s analysis.\nReferring to Aluko, capped on over 100 occasions by the Lionesses, Barton wrote on X: ‘How is she even talking about Men’s football. She can’t even kick a ball properly.\n‘Your coverage of the game EFC last night, took it to a new low. Eni Aluko and Lucy Ward, the Fred and Rose West of football commentary.’\nBarton’s message, which referenced two of Britain’s most notorious child killers, prompted a furious reaction on the social media platform, but he didn’t stop there.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nResponding to an old video of Aluko training by taking shots against a goalkeeper, he wrote: ‘Technically, that’s awful,’ he said. ‘She can’t move without her legs rubbing together. You have to laugh. She’s 18 yds out and can’t reach the goal without a bounce!\n‘F***ing pathetic. Get them off the Men’s Football. Off the tele. Only there to tick boxes. DEI is a load of s**t. Affirmative action.\n‘All off the back of the BLM/George Floyd nonsense. Cancel me, I’d don’t care anymore.’\nThe 41-year-old, a convicted criminal, has waged war on a clutch of England’s most successful female footballers over the course of the last month, taking particular issue with their increasing involvement in the men’s game.\nMore Trending\nNewly crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year Mary Earps was branded a ‘big sack of spuds’ by the former Manchester City midfielder, who was sacked by Bristol Rovers last October having overseen a miserable run of results as manager of the League One club.\nBarton has also singled out Alex Scott for particularly stinging criticism, but the former England star answered in the best way possible following the BBC’s recent coverage of Arsenal’s recent WSL win over Chelsea.\n‘Just before we say goodbye,’ Scott said. ‘To all the women in football, in front of the camera or behind it, to the players on the pitch, to everyone that attends games – keep being the role models that you continue to be to all those young girls that are told ‘no, you can’t’.\n‘Football is a better place with us all in it.’\nMORE: Joey Barton slammed for claiming there aren’t enough white British men on football TV show\nMORE: Alex Scott gives perfect response after being told to stick to women’s footballby Joey Barton\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
