  "body_text": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — Former Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore was still jailed on Thursday morning, according to court records, less than 24 hours after he was fired for what the university said was an “inappropriate relationship with a staff member.” The Washtenaw County Jail did not provide information about why the 39-year-old Moore was detained, details on his bond or whether any court appearances were scheduled. In response to media inquiries about Moore, Pittsfield Township Police Department said officers took a person into custody after investigating an alleged assault. The police statement did not mention anyone by name.\nNEW YORK (AP) — Brandon Nimmo went first. Then it was Edwin Díaz and Pete Alonso on back-to-back days at baseball’s winter meetings. Three fan favorites headed out the door in 2 1/2 weeks — a powerful gut punch to angry New York Mets fans wondering what on earth the front office is thinking. As the club embarks on a major makeover, suffice to say owner Steve Cohen and president of baseball operations David Stearns are not the most popular couple in Queens right now. Stearns says there is work to do, but there are many good players available and he's confident the Mets will like their team when opening day arrives.\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Philip Rivers wanted one more shot at winning that elusive Super Bowl ring. So the 44-year-old grandfather and Hall of Fame semifinalist is coming out of retirement and rejoining the Indianapolis Colts. Just hours after team officials announced they’d signed Rivers to the practice squad, the eight-time Pro Bowler told reporters he’s eager to take his first NFL snaps since 2020 and hopes to start Sunday’s crucial game at Seattle. Coach Shane Steichen says it's possible Rivers could earn the job. Rivers says “I know there’s risk involved, what may or may not happen, but the only way to find out is going for it.”\nZURICH (AP) — Women’s World Cup champion Spain has widened its points lead atop the FIFA rankings over the second-placed United States. Spain retained its UEFA Nations League title since the last rankings update in August. The U.S. won four of five friendlies played in that time. Spain won the Nations League final last week against Germany which rose two places to No. 3 in the rankings. European champion England stayed at No. 4 and No. 5 Sweden fell two spots.\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — NASCAR Chairman Jim France has testified in a federal antitrust lawsuit involving Michael Jordan's racing team. France explained his refusal to grant teams permanent charters, citing advice from his late parents. He emphasized the importance of keeping promises and expressed discomfort with making permanent agreements. This aligns with testimony from NASCAR Commissioner Steve Phelps, who described a chaotic agreement process in September 2024. Two teams, including Jordan's, refused to sign the agreement and sued NASCAR. The jury will decide if NASCAR violated antitrust laws, potentially leading to significant changes in the sport's structure.\nMANCHESTER, England (AP) — The pressure was already on Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso and a 2-1 defeat to Manchester City in the Champions League raised further questions about his future. It’s now just two wins in eight games for Madrid and back-to-back home losses after goals from Nico O’Reilly and Erling Haaland sealed victory for City. Elsewhere, Arsenal remains perfect in the Champions League after a 3-0 win against Club Brugge continued its 100% record. Defending champion Paris Saint-Germain was held 0-0 at Athletic Bilbao.\nST. LOUIS (AP) — The St. Louis Blues have signed Dillon Dube to an American Hockey League professional tryout agreement. Dube is the last remaining player acquitted of sexual assault in the high-profile case involving members of Canada's 2018 world junior team not to sign a contract somewhere. Goaltender Carter Hart with the Vegas Golden Knights is the only one who has played in the NHL since the trial ended last summer with a not guilty verdict. Defenseman Cal Foote signed with the AHL's Chicago Wolves last week, while forwards Alex Formenton and Michael McLeod are playing in Europe. The Blues said Dube would report to the Springfield Thunderbirds after receiving his work visa.\nTwelve more pounds of muscle. Equipment dialed in. A new superstar coach. At age 41 Lindsey Vonn is feeling more powerful than she has in years. So powerful that she already pulled away from the field in the very first official downhill training session of the season. Next up Vonn will get her Olympic racing season underway this weekend with two World Cup downhills and a super-G in St. Moritz, Switzerland. She says that “physically I’m in possibly the best shape I’ve ever been in.\" She adds “I was able to gain about 12 pounds this summer” which “took a lot of hard work.\"\nThe NFL is seeking to create a practice squad of officials and wants postseason assignments to be based on performance rather than seniority. Those were among the key points league executive Troy Vincent emphasized to owners in a virtual meeting on Wednesday. The league and the NFL Referees Association have been negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement since the summer of 2024. The current CBA expires on May 31, 2026. So far, discussions with the game officials’ union have been unsuccessful, according to a memo that was sent to teams and obtained by The Associated Press.\nEwa Pajor put Barcelona on course for a 3-1 win against Benfica in the Champions League and moved within sight of Sam Kerr’s scoring record. Pajor’s opening goal in the 29th minute at Estadi Johan Cruyff was her 15th in 16 appearances in the group or league phase European club soccer’s top competition. According to UEFA, only Chelsea striker Kerr has more at this stage of the Champions League, with 16 goals. Barcelona tops the league phase with one game to go and was already guaranteed a place in the playoffs at least.\nFinals\nNATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE\nFinal Chicago 3 N-Y Rangers 0\nFinal Detroit 4 Calgary 3\nFinal Florida 4 Utah 3\nFinal OT Seattle 3 Los Angeles 2\nTOP-25 COLLEGE BASKETBALL\nFinal (6)Purdue 85 Minnesota 57\nFinal (7)Houston 80 Jackson State 38\nFinal (23)Nebraska 90 Wisconsin 60",
