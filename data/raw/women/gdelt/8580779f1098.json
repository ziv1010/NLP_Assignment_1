  "body_text": "On Sunday, Arsenal played their last league game of 2025. It was a clash against Liverpool Women at Prenton Park. What a tight contest that was; even so, our Arsenal women found a way to win it. With a 20th-minute goal by in-form Alessia Russo, they left Merseyside with all three points.\nIf our Gunner women aren’t the most in-form women’s team in Europe, I’m at a loss for words.\nArsenal 5-0 Brighton-\nJuventus 0-4 Arsenal-\nTottenham 0-3 Arsenal-\nArsenal 1-0 Juventus-\nArsenal 4-0 Aston Villa-\nValerenga 1-3 Arsenal-\nLiverpool 0-1 Arsenal\n7 wins in a row. 21 goals scored. Only 1 goal conceded and 6 clean sheets kept.\nWhat a time to be a Gunner women’s fan! Belief in this team is now back at last. Renee Slegers has found a way for this Arsenal team to click, play some beautiful football, and pick up results while at it, something that keeps their title hopes alive.\nAfter the win over Liverpool, she admitted, “I am very happy with how the team finds ways to win and finds ways to overcome those challenges; that has been positive.”\nArsenal have one last game before the winter break. Bayern Munich is visiting them at Meadow Park on Wednesday for the last Champions League group game.\nThe desire among the gunners will be to win that game at whatever cost. Lia Walti recently revealed that the team is keen on ending the year in style. That said, ending the year in style will not only see them end the UWCL group stages as group leaders, but also embark on an 8-game winning streak.\nA win over Bayern would perfectly crown Arsenal’s resurgence under interim manager Renee Slegers after a poor start to this league campaign. It could put the Arsenal hierarchy in a tricky position regarding whether to hire Renee as the permanent manager or not.\nRenee needs just one more game to make her the concrete choice to lead us….\nMichelle M\nFollow JustArsenal’s Gooner Women on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Womens Team!\nDo you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?
