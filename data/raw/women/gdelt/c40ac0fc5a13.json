This is not OK in anyone's books.\"\nOlympic will host a men's (4pm) and women's (6.30pm) NPL double-header against Maitland on Saturday.\nCup draw done\nOlympic and Maitland battled it out for the inaugural NNSW Football Women's League Cup last year with the former winning the final in a penalty shoot-out.\nBut only one side will have the chance to feature in another final this year with the two sides drawn to face each other in the League Cup quarter-finals over the Easter weekend.\nIn the other quarter-finals, Warners Bay host Azzurri, Mid Coast are at home to Adamstown and Broadmeadow play New Lambton at Magic Park.\nThe semi-finals will be staged between April 15-19 and the final has been scheduled for the weekend of May 18-19.\nSeeing Red\nBroadmeadow striker Adriana Konjarski and New Lambton centre-back Hannah Bourke will both serve one-match suspensions this weekend after receiving the first red cards of this NPLW season.\nBoth were issued their marching orders in round three for two yellow card offences.\nKonjarski is the competition's back-to-back leading scorer and was player of the year in 2022 but was ruled out of contention for the accolade last year after copping a red card.\nWelcome returns\nSophie Stapleford had immediate impact after missing the start of the NPLW season through illness then a quadriceps issue.\nThe Maitland strike weapon and co-captain scored twice in a 30-minute appearance off the bench as the Magpies overpowered Warners Bay 9-0 at John Street Oval on Sunday.\nAnother familiar face was back in action at Magic Park with versatile Lori Depczynski settling Charlestown's backline in an encouraging 1-1 draw against defending champions Broadmeadow.",
