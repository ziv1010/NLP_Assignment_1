All the s*** that I've gone through in life, I've dealt with it on my own mostly.'\nGiggs' marriage to Stacey survived the affair, before eventually splitting in 2017 after ten years together.\nTHE GAGGING ORDER\nDespite having an affair with Natasha and still being married to Stacey, Ryan still wanted more and so in 2010 embarked on a steamy seven month fling with Big Brother contestant Imogen Thomas.\n‘We hit it off straight away because we had so much in common,’ gushed Imogen in a breathless interview with a Sunday tabloid at the time which she made under the condition she would not name the footballer.\nThis was due to a gagging order that Giggs had made to stop details of their seven-month liaison becoming public at a time when his love life was under more scrutiny than ever.\nDespite the footballer's expensive £150,000 super injunction, details of the steamy affair eventually came out when Lib Dem MP John Hemming used Parliamentary privilege to name him in the House of Commons.\nGiggs is alleged to have recognised Thomas in a night club before pursuing her, and was keen to keep their relationship under wraps due to her history.\nShe had posed topless for lads’ magazines, and had already dated Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe and Russell Brand.\nAccording to the footballer’s statement released after the scandal broke he and Thomas ‘met four times between September and December in 2010’.\nDespite having an affair with Natasha and still being married to Stacey, in 2010 Ryan embarked on a steamy seven month fling with Big Brother contestant Imogen Thomas (pictured)\n‘We hit it off straight away because we had so much in common,’ gushed Imogen in a interview with a tabloid at the time, under the condition she would not name the footballer\nDespite Ryan's £150,000 super injunction, details of the affair eventually came out when Lib Dem MP John Hemming used Parliamentary privilege to name him in the House of Commons\nShe allegedly told him ‘she wanted’, or ‘needed’, a payment from him of £50,000.\nShe then contacted him by text in March 2011, which led him to conclude she was thinking of selling her story.\nShe allegedly told him ‘she wanted’, or ‘needed’, a payment from him of £50,000. Giggs agreed to meet her in a hotel where he was staying.\nThere, he claimed he gave her a signed football shirt, but said he was not prepared to give her £50,000. She asked to see him again shortly afterwards, to which ‘he agreed with reluctance’ and provided her with some football tickets.\nAlthough the position was ‘by no means clear’, the judge initially said the evidence ‘appeared to suggest’ Thomas had arranged the two hotel meetings ‘in collaboration with photographers and/or journalists’.\nHowever, Giggseventually withdrew any legal action and a statement read out to the court by Thomas’s lawyer confirmed that the parties had resolved matter between them, and Ryan accepted there was no basis to accuse her of blackmail.\nThomas eventually sold her story through Max Clifford. Her ‘edited’ version appeared in the Sunday Mirror.\n‘He’s not like other footballers,’ she said in the interview. ‘He seemed very decent and private with good morals, and I fell for that.’\nARREST\nGiggs was then appointed as Wales boss in 2018 but his career was thrown into chaos in November 2020 after being arrested on suspicion of two counts of assault against his ex-girlfriend, Kate Greville, and her younger sister, Emma.\nHe always denied the charges.\nThe winger was cleared of assaulting Greville, who declined to co-operate with a retrial, in 2023. Ryan was also cleared on further counts of coercive or controlling behaviour against her and common assault against Emma.\nChris Daw KC, defending Giggs, said in court that his client was 'deeply relieved the prosecution has finally come to an end after almost three years in which he's been fighting throughout to clear his name', adding: 'He has always been innocent of these charges - there's been very, very many lies told about him in court.'\nRyan was then appointed as Wales boss in 2018 but his career was thrown into chaos in November 2020 after being arrested on suspicion of two counts of assault against his ex-girlfriend, Kate Greville, and her younger sister, Emma\nGiggs had pleaded not guilty to controlling or coercive behaviour over a three-year period before being cleared of assaulting Greville (pictured) who declined to co-operate with a retrial\nIt is revealed how the case began to fall apart in when Greville said she did not want to testify due to the effects of the process on her 'mental and physical well-being.'\nHowever lawyers for Giggs said he 'did not buy' her reasoning, insisting the prosecution was put off by new information uncovered by the defence, including a cosmetic procedure to have lip fillers on or around the day of the alleged attack - several days before she was pictured with apparently swollen and bruised lips as a result of the alleged attack.\nGiggs' barrister said his client was 'looking forward to rebuilding his life and career as an innocent man'.\nDuring the initial 2022 trial Greville was accused of planning to 'get pregnant' by Giggs, after lawyers highlighted a message she sent a friend in October 2020 – just weeks before the alleged assault – that she was 'not walking away with nothing'.\nIt came after she told friends she was 'planning my attack' after learning the footballer had been cheating on her with eight other women.\n'Your plan was to get pregnant by Mr Giggs,' he asked her.\nGreville replied 'absolutely not', saying she had meant she didn't want to walk away without their golden retriever puppy, Mac.\nThe footballer's lawyer read out a message in which she asked Giggs about buying a £1,000 pair of Prada boots from Harrods.\nHe asked whether she had 'got very used to the lifestyle you enjoyed with Mr Giggs'.\nBut Greville responded that she could 'still provide for myself' as a single woman even though she would not be entitled to any financial support as they weren't married.\nHall of Fame snub\nEarlier this year Giggs broke his silence on being snubbed by the Premier League's Hall of Fame.\nHe is the top flight's most decorated footballer having won 13 titles during his 24-year spell in Manchester United's first team. As well as winning 64 caps for Wales and played for Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics, earning legendary status at United and subsequently spent three years coaching at the club.\nHowever amid his numerous scandals his name has been conspicuously absent from the Premier League's Hall of Fame, which was launched in 2020 before its first inductions took place in 2021.\nIt aims to recognise and honour players and managers that have achieved great success and made a significant contribution to the Premier League, with 22 players and two managers inducted so far.\nEarlier this year Giggs broke his silence on being snubbed by the Premier League 's Hall of Fame\nDespite being the Premier League's most decorated player, he is not among the inductees\nGiggs, speaking to former team-mate Rio Ferdinand, said the snub didn't really bother him\nThe footballer is now in a relationship with 36-year-old Zara Charles with whom he welcomed daughter Cora in November 2025\nAnd, speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents to his former United colleague, Giggs was pressed on whether the snub is something that plays on his mind.\n'Not really,' Giggs said. 'No, I mean, I don't think about it until you just brought it up. I don't think about it.\n'I think when you start off, you don't... These are the things that you're not striving for. You're striving off to win games and try and win trophies. That's the most important thing for me.'\nGiggs asked Ferdinand whether he had made the list, with the former defender explaining how he was inducted in 2023.\n'Now I am upset,' Giggs joked. 'Now I am... Jeez, what's going on? I'm going to look at the list now when I go home.'\nHe then aimed a cheeky dig at another former United defender in Gary Neville as he added: 'Is Nev on it?'\nFerdinand then replied: 'No, I don't think Nev's on it yet. He'll get on it soon. He'll talk his way into it, won't he?'",
