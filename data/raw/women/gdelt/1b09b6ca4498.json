  "body_text": "Pro-Gaza MP who cheered shutout of Israeli football fans also cast doubt on Oct 7\nA pro-Gaza MP who welcomed the ban on Israeli football fans from Villa Park previously cast doubt on the atrocities committed in the Oct 7 attacks.\nAyoub Khan, the independent MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, cast doubt on claims that women were raped during the Hamas-led massacre in 2023.\nHis comments have come to light as he faces a backlash for celebrating the decision to bar Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending their team’s Europa League match against Aston Villa on Nov 6.\nFans of the Israeli club were informed of the ban on Thursday following a recommendation from West Midlands Police to Birmingham’s safety advisory group.\nSir Keir Starmer has led criticism of the ban. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, said MPs who celebrated it were “absolutely disgusting”.\nMr Khan, 52, who led a petition to boycott the match, said: “From the moment that the match was announced, it was clear that there were latent safety risks that even our capable security and police authorities would not be able to manage fully.\n“With so much hostility and uncertainty around the match, it was only right to take drastic measures.”\nIn October 2023, when he was a Liberal Democrat councillor for Aston, Mr Khan posted a video of himself on social media appearing to question the extent of atrocities committed by Hamas in Israel.\nIn a now-deleted TikTok video posted just weeks after the Oct 7 attack, he responded to claims by Isaac Herzog, the Israeli president, that Hamas fighters were carrying “official al-Qaeda material” that showed how to build a weapon with cyanide.\nMr Khan said: “Sky has interviewed the Israeli president who claims that the Hamas militants were carrying with them very important documents.\n“In fact, they were instructions, instructions not how to behead babies or rape women, which I’ve yet to see evidence [of] and I’m afraid nothing has come to light.”\nAbout 1,200 people were killed in the Oct 7 attacks. Evidence suggests sexual assaults and gang rapes also took place at the Nova music festival site, including a UN report which found Hamas attackers raped women’s corpses.\nAt the time of Mr Khan’s post, numerous eyewitness accounts of Hamas rapes had appeared in media reports.\nIsraeli military officials claimed in the aftermath of the attacks that babies had been beheaded. This claim has never been verified.\nCredit: Ayoub Khan via X / @lmharpin\nThe Lib Dems launched an investigation into Mr Khan’s conduct after receiving a complaint and offered him anti-Semitism training.\nHowever, Mr Khan initially refused to take the training, insisting his posts were not offensive.\nHe said at the time: ”So let me make my position absolutely clear. At no stage have I considered my material on TikTok offensive, nor have I agreed with anyone that I would undergo a training course in anti-Semitism. There is simply no need.”\nIt is not clear whether he ever took the anti-Semitism training.\nMr Khan was one of several Independent MPs elected at the 2024 general election who stood on a pro-Gaza platform in areas with high Muslim populations.\nIn July, he took up a role as director of Your Party, the new hard-Left political party led by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana.\nMr Khan was approached for comment but did not respond.",
