  "body_text": "A WOMAN who broke a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) she signed with Harvey Weinstein has been awarded a CBE for services to social justice.\nZelda Perkins was the first former employee of Mr Weinstein, an ex-film producer and convicted sex offender, to break a gagging order preventing her from talking about his abuse.\nMs Perkins, who lives near Salisbury, a former personal assistant of Weinstein, felt she had no choice but to sign it because of their “enormous disparity of power and wealth”.\nShe broke the confidentiality agreement in 2017 to speak out against him.\nIn 2021, Ms Perkins founded the campaign group Can’t Buy My Silence UK, which seeks to end the misuse of NDAs through legislative and regulatory reform.\nIn July, following an eight-year campaign, government ministers announced plans to stop bosses from using the agreements to silence abused workers.\nIn an interview with The Guardian, Ms Perkins said: “It’s the beginning of abusers having to change their behaviour – not because somebody’s wagging a finger at them, not because they are told to, but because they have to.\n“There’s nowhere for them to hide any more, they just have to effing behave themselves.\n“It’s funny because everyone goes: ‘Oh, you’re so brave for breaking your NDA’ – none of that was brave.\n“I tell you what’s brave: every single campaigner getting up every morning when you’re on your own and continuing to fight the system with no remuneration, no encouragement, and nobody really there to hold your hand. That’s brave.”\nMs Perkins, who lives near Salisbury, is one of six local people in the New Year Honours list.\nAnother is Lieutenant Colonel Rory Steevenson, a former soldier who transformed the fortunes of a charity when he took over as a director.\nMr Steevenson, 71, was selected to lead the INSPIRE Foundation, based at Salisbury District Hospital, in September 2012.\nHe had previously toured the Middle East and Northern Ireland in the infantry.\nHe has been awarded an MBE for services to spinal injury research.\nINSPIRE raises money to improve people's independence and quality of life after they suffer a spinal cord injury, with no government or NHS funding support.\nAs director, Mr Steevenson was responsible for the day-to-day running of the charity, all fundraising and coordinating INSPIRE'S national research programme.\nHe grew INSPIRE's research programme from £37,000 to more than £1.6m. He retired in April 2023 but continues to help the charity.\nRead more\nTeen and her dog Twiglet set to represent GB in world championship\nTop 10 best things to do in Salisbury revealed, according to TripAdvisor\nQuality Street reveals mystery new chocolate added to classic selection\nElsewhere, Idris Elba and ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean have been honoured, and England’s victorious women’s football and rugby teams have been recognised.\nEngland’s Lionesses featured heavily on the list after their Euros win in the summer – with captain Leah Williamson made a CBE.\nAlex Greenwood, Keira Walsh, Georgia Stanway and Ella Toone, who were all part of the side that beat Spain in the final, have become MBEs.\nThe team’s Dutch manager Sarina Wiegman has been awarded an honorary damehood.\nActress Meera Syal has become a Dame and broadcaster Gabby Logan, actor Warwick Davis and presenter and author Richard Osman have been made OBEs.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: “This year’s Honours list celebrates the very best of Britain – people who put the common good ahead of themselves to strengthen communities and change lives.\n“Their quiet dedication speaks to the decent, compassionate country we are proud to be.
