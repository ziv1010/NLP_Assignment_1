Also locked up were 31 men who became embroiled in rioting in Southport, Liverpool city centre and Walton.\nMeanwhile, Liverpool Crown Court heard that \"cowardly\" van driver sped through a red light and struck an elderly jogger before leaving him dying in the street. Here are the faces of 60 criminals from our region who were imprisoned during August.\nGary Toomey\nA man killed his ex-girlfriend by \"yanking\" on the handbrake of her Audi as she drove on the motorway after a \"feeling in his gut exploded\". Victoria Bell died aged 34 after her vehicle crashed into the central reservation of the M62, being struck by another car as she attempted to flee to safety on the hard shoulder.\nIt came after she and her \"on off\" partner Gary Toomey had rowed while attending a music festival. The 37-year-old claims that his fatal actions were a \"spontaneous reaction to stop the car in order to get away from the ongoing argument\" and says he \"was not intending to cause any harm\".\nToomey admitted manslaughter. He was jailed for seven years and four months, a term of which he must serve at least two thirds behind bars.\nDavid Tilici\nA thug left his own month-old son with life threatening injuries after hitting the baby in the face.

Under interview, Riley said that he \"heard about a protest at the Pier Head and went to show solidarity and support for the bereaved parents\".\nHaving been moved on from the area, he then \"went drinking in four or five bars\" and \"recalled a last pint at Ranelagh’s Tavern\" before re-joining the crowds and \"telling officers to put their batons down and go home\". Mr Taylor added: \"The defendant said that he was not part of any particular group, he just followed the evolving situation.\n\"He could not explain why he returned, having been moved on from the Pier Head.

I’m English, I’m English. Stop it, I’m gonna die. Get off me. I’m f***ing 70 years of age. F*** off. F***ing get off me. Ah you c***, f*** off. I’m gonna die. You’re gonna kill me.
