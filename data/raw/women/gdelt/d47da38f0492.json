Following these events, orders from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for bombings and ground operations have led to over 34,800 Palestinian casualties, with a significant number being women and children, according to figures from the Gaza Health Ministry.\nIn an emotional exchange with Zeteo, the media outlet founded by British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan, Lineker shared: \"It's the worst thing I've seen in my life. I've got no skin in this game. I'm not Muslim, I'm not Jewish, I'm not Israeli, I'm not Palestinian.\", reports Leicestershire Live.\nREAD MORE: Dodgy Amazon Fire TV Stick crackdown could lead to home raids\nREAD MORE: McDonald's makes major change to Happy Meals for important reason\nLineker concluded with a poignant reflection: \"So I see it, I think, purely from the outside as from a neutral perspective. And I can't think of anything that I've seen worse in my lifetime, the constant images of children losing their lives day in day out.\"\nIn an outspoken comment, he disclosed: \"Obviously, we all know October 7 happened and but the minute you raise your voice against what they're now doing you get accused of being a supporter of Hamas and this kind of stuff. There is a lot of heavy lobbying on people to be quiet so I understand why most people refrain, but I'm getting on a bit now, I'm fairly secure and I can't be silent about what's happening there.\n\"I think it's so so utterly awful and it already looks like it's happening, going into Rafa, where they've sent everybody down there. It's not antisemitic to say that what Israel is doing is wrong.\n\"I just can't see how everybody doesn't see that now, whatever the cause, whatever started it, we all know that, the history of this area, of the world goes way before October 7. But it's, it's truly dreadful, what's happening and I cry on a regular basis when I see certain images on social media.\"\nLineker experienced an interim removal from Match of the Day on March 10, 2023 after his stinging criticism of what he characterised as \"an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\". Famous commentators including Alan Shearer, Ian Wright and Jermaine Jenas pulled out from their scheduled appearances as a sign of unity, leading to his rapid reinstatement.\nThe BBC's report, released in September, featured reference to flagship programmes such as Match of the Day, The Apprentice, Dragon's Den and The One Show. The document stated that presenters are banned from supporting or criticising any political party during a broadcast, with this rule also applying for two weeks before and after the series.\nDespite endorsing freedom of speech, the guidelines limit conversation about individual UK politicians' character, declarations on contentious issues during an election period, and adopting a formal role with a lobbying group. In response to these restrictions, Lineker voiced his approval, terming them as \"eminently sensible\".\nDon't miss the biggest and breaking stories by signing up to the Echo Daily newsletter here",
