The league's first round of expansion included Bay FC and the Utah Royals for the 2024 season, with each franchise paying a $53 million fee, along with Boston Legacy for the 2026 season. A second expansion process brought in Denver Summit FC, also for next season.\n'We've been through these two rounds, and so we pretty much know the universe of people who are interested -- there's more than a dozen of them,' Berman said, per Sports Business Journal. 'Those conversations are ongoing and each of them have a different perspective on how much time they need to launch and the investments they need to make in order to be successful, including potentially around infrastructure.\n'We want to not force a square peg into a round hole. We want to be more flexible so that we can get to the best possible result for the next round.'\nCities expected to be interested in adding a NWSL franchise include Cincinnati, Nashville, Philadelphia, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Atlanta, Jacksonville and St. Louis.\nBerman, whose four-year contract expires at the end of this season, is reportedly expected to sign at least a short-term extension.\n'What I can say is that I intend to be here,' she said. 'I joined this league because I believe in the future of women's sports and professional women's soccer. That's all I can say.'\n--Field Level Media\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nFlip\nEmail\nGet a daily dose of Boston Star news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Boston Star.\nMore InformationNEW YORK, New York - U.S. stock markets finished broadly higher on Thursday, with the S&P 500 and NASDAQ posting solid gains as investor...\nNEW DELHI, India: India and the United States resumed trade talks in New Delhi on September 16, raising hopes of progress just weeks...\nBERLIN, Germany: China has broken into the United Nations' list of the world's top 10 most innovative economies for the first time,...\nNEW YORK, New York - Wall Street delivered a split decision on Wednesday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing...\nDEARBORN, Michigan: Ford Motor Company is preparing for a historic move, shifting its world headquarters for the first time in nearly...\nLONDON, U.K.: Google pledged 5 billion pounds (US$6.8 billion) in fresh investments in Britain, unveiling the plan just a few days...\n(Photo credit: Kylie Graham-Imagn Images) The National Women's Soccer League is shifting away from a defined start and end date to...\n(Photo credit: David Butler II-Imagn Images) Brent Rooker homered during a three-run first inning that helped the visiting Athletics...\n(Photo credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images) Tampa Bay starting pitcher Shane Baz crafted five scoreless innings, Chandler Simpson...\n(Photo credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images) Kansas and Arizona State will meet in the first-ever FBS game at London's Wembley Stadium...\n(Photo credit: Charles LeClaire-Imagn Images) The Milwaukee Brewers will turn to right-hander Quinn Priester as they pursue their...\n(Photo credit: Nick Wosika-Imagn Images) The New York Yankees have been getting it done recently.
