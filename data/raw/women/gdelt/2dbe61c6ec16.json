  "body_text": "Barcelona release home kit for 2023/24 season\nBarcelona have unveiled their new home kit for the 2023/24 season, inspired by the recent successes of the women's team.\nLa Blaugrana's women's team have achieved remarkable results over the past number of seasons, having won four consecutive Liga F titles and the UEFA Women's Champions League during the 2022/23 campaign thanks to a 3-2 comeback victory over VfL Wolfsburg.\nThe team also began to play at Camp Nou quite regularly, breaking the attendance record for a women's game in 2022, when over 90,000 people watched the team thump Wolfsburg 5-1.\nThe club's new jersey is inspired by their success, with the badge set into a diamond to pay homage to 'the first women's team to every play a game of football at the Spotify Camp Nou, an example of Barça's pioneering spirit, always adopting a leading role in both sport and society, allied with continued success.'\nThat first women's team to play at Camp Nou did so back in 1970, when one Inma Cabeceran sent a letter to the club proposing the creation of a women's team. The club responded by allowing a women's game to be played at Camp Nou behind closed doors.\nAfter this, the forced Barcelona women's supporters club was formed in 1971 - a supporters club which combined the club badged with a diamond for their logo.\nBarcelona's men's team will be hoping to have similar success to the women's team during the upcoming 2023/24 campaign. While La Blaugrana men's team did win their first La Liga title in four years last time out, unlike their women's outfit, they massively underperformed in European competition - being knocked out of the UEFA Champions League in the group stages. They'll be hoping to massively improve upon these results in the upcoming season.",
