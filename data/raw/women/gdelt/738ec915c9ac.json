The latest influencer boxing showdown is a PPV in many countries, but not everywhere. Full details on how to watch Jake Paul vs Nate Diaz live streams just below.\nJake Paul vs Nate Diaz: preview\nEleven months ago, Nate Diaz was earning the second Performance of the Night bonus of his career as a UFC headliner. Now, he's about to make his boxing debut against the king of celebrities-turned-fighters, Jake Paul.\nThe fact that \"Problem Child\" has landed this bout despite losing his last fight to Tommy Fury shows that he's not going away anytime soon. If anything, that clash may have served to strengthen Paul's credentials as a viable pro. He knocked the British boxer to his knees in the 8th, and the subsequent split decision that went in Fury's favour wasn't entirely convincing.\nIt was the first setback of Paul's fledgling new career, which has already done untold damage to the respective legacies of Ben Askren, Tyron Woodley and Anderson Silva. Unlike those three, however, Diaz isn't long over the hill and hankering to hear the roar of the crowd one last time – he just wants an excuse to dish out a beating.\nDiaz saw out his UFC contract in style in September, declining to put pen to an extension before scoring a bonus-worthy 4th-round submission of Tony Ferguson. Since then, however, the 38-year-old has made headlines for his involvement in scrapes outside the arena.\nThere's little doubt what the outcome would be if this fight was taking place on the streets or in the octagon. In the ring though, where Paul has showed surprising prowess, it's much more difficult to call.\nThe main card starts at 8pm ET / 1am BST. The Jake Paul and Nate Diaz ring walks are expected at around 11pm ET / 4am BST.
