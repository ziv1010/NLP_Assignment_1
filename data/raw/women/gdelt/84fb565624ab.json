It’s always sad when these moments happen, it’s horrible because you know that it will keep them away from the game for a long time, and it’s a long investment for those players to come back again.\n“If you look at Miche specifically, I think she’s been doing so well. Her loan in Brighton has been really positive. She’s got all those minutes for England, contributing at the Euros, so she was in a really good place.\n“So of course, it’s always the timing of this isn’t great, it’s not good timing. But she’s very strong and we’re very proud to have her.\n“Miche is very strong. She’s a young adult but she’s very, very strong. So she will have the strength to come back and we will do everything we can to support her.”\nWe can confirm that Michelle Agyemang suffered a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament whilst on international duty.\nWishing all the best with your recovery, Mich – we’ll be with you every step of the way ❤️\n— Arsenal Women (@ArsenalWFC) October 30, 2025\nArsenal, fifth in the table and five points behind leaders Chelsea, have bounced back from successive defeats this month to Manchester City and Champions League rivals Lyon with wins against Brighton and Benfica.\nNext up is Sunday’s trip to Leicester and Slegers added: “Results very, very mixed and not what we wanted. Performances same. So we want to look forward.\n“We want to get the absolute best out of ourselves. Football will never be perfect, but (let’s) show bigger spells and really show our strengths on the pitch as a team, but also in our game of football.”\nChelsea will bid to extend their one-point lead at the top of the table on Saturday in their first meeting with London City Lionesses.\n🆚 London City Lionesses.🏟️ Stamford Bridge.🏆 @BarclaysWSL.📅 Saturday 1 November.⏰ 12:00.\nThe date and time has been set for another London derby! Get your tickets now! 👊\n— Chelsea FC Women (@ChelseaFCW) September 29, 2025\nBlues boss Sonia Bompastor confirmed USA defender Naomi Girma could be included in the squad for the first time this season following a calf injury.\nBompastor said: “There is positive news because everyone has returned fit and healthy from the international break – and we also have Naomi back in the group.\n“Naomi is a top-class player and we want to have all of those players on the pitch. We want to enjoy watching them play and she’s an important player for us. I’m hoping that she will now be able to stay on the pitch for as long as possible.”\nManchester City are hot on Chelsea’s heels and are chasing a sixth straight win on Saturday at home against West Ham, while Manchester United will aim to extend their unbeaten league start on Sunday at Brighton.\nWe are BACK 🤩\nHere are the #BarclaysWSL and #BarclaysWSL2 fixtures taking place this weekend! pic.twitter.com/6TsBUZ9amM\n— Barclays Women's Super League (@BarclaysWSL) October 30, 2025\nTottenham will bid to bounce back from their 1-0 defeat at Chelsea last time out and maintain their impressive start to the season by inflicting on Liverpool a sixth straight league defeat.\nEverton have not won in the league since their 4-1 opening-day victory against their Merseyside rivals and they play at Aston Villa, whose only defeat this season was against Chelsea in September.",
