Until now.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nAnd the last two, just for good measure, were recorded in back-to-back fixtures against the A-League Men's champions and premiers from last season.\nSunday's 1-0 result against City in Melbourne also means the Jets leapfrog back inside the top six with 18 points, having collected double the amount from road trips compared to hosting at McDonald Jones Stadium so far in 2025-2026.\nIt comes amid a strong run of four victories from Newcastle's most recent five outings (4-1), completely flipping the script from the previous handful of ALM appearances (1-4).\nAnd despite missing Alex Badolato, Christian Bracco and Oscar Fryer to year-ending ACL injuries, Lachlan Rose's sixth goal of this campaign leaves him outright Golden Boot leader while keeper James Delianov just peeled off a second clean sheet.\nIn relation to the new club record, featuring a trifecta over in New Zealand (frontrunners Auckland twice either side of Wellington) from November 30 to New Year's Day and the latest effort in the Victorian capital on January 11, Jets coach Mark Milligan admits he's \"definitely\" proud of the squad.\n\"That's credit to the group, that's credit to the players, that's credit to the hard work they put in every single day,\" Milligan said during Sunday's post-match press conference.\n\"Honestly, the buy in we've had from day one, and we've gone through some rough patches and we knew we would. But it's how we come out of them.\n\"The buy in from this group from day one, willingness to work and to believe in what we're trying to achieve has been fantastic.\n\"Results like today [against City], that's a little reward for them for their belief in what we're trying to give to them.\"\nAccording to Milligan, the key difference has been clear for the Australia Cup champions during a 28-day stretch with just the solo 5-4 defeat.\n\"They started to make the football theirs,\" Milligan said.\n\"We [coaching staff] can give them as many tactical things as we want and unfortunately I can't shift them around the field.\n\"They had to make the football theirs. We gave them a starting point and we give them reference points, but they needed to develop the game into theirs and what they believe and we've seen that happen.\n\"There's still a long way to go and there's a lot more that they can give, but I really believe now we give them starting points and they run with that.\"\nMilligan was also pleased with how Newcastle's players reacted to an \"emotional\" week, with scans confirming the worst for both Badolato and Bracco out of the previous Auckland fixture, and backing up a defensive performance having gone down to 10 men in the 21st minute last round.\n\"We talk about the defensive side of the game a lot, you work on it on the training track, but until they face something like they did in Auckland then they don't really understand what they're capable of,\" he said.\n\"Defending is as much a mentality thing as it is technique or working hard, if you have a mentality where you feel like you're not going to concede and you're working for each other that helps.\n\"You can't teach that to them, they need to experience that, and that's what they got against Auckland.\"\nMilligan pointed out the Jets were forced to \"find other avenues to create chances\" in near perfect conditions against City at AAMI Park on Sunday evening.\n\"I thought our intent then came from, rather than normally with the ball, came from us without the ball,\" he said.\n\"We were very good, we were organised, we were compact, but still very aggressive.\"\nMan-of-the-match Rose had a shot saved point blank by City keeper and Socceroos representative Patrick Beach midway through the opening stanza.\nHowever, in the 67th minute the striker hit back with his last touch of the game, once again relentlessly chasing the ball and managing to pick the pocket of City defender German Ferreyra, progressing into the 18-yard box and coolly slotting home Newcastle's winner.\n\"I was stoked with it to be honest,\" Rose told broadcaster Paramount Plus after full-time.\n\"Obviously in the first half I had a good chance and credit to Patty who made a good save, but I wanted to get a goal because at the end of the day, as a striker, that's my job.\"\nIt was Rose's sixth goal this campaign, featuring three from his most recent two appearances.\nAndrew Nabbout, recently passing an ALM milestone of 200 games, almost put City ahead with a tap in just prior to half-time only for VAR to confirm the former Jets star was offside by the barest of margins.\nEach team also hit the woodwork, City the upright from a headed-on free-kick and Newcastle the crossbar late.\nDalianov and central defender Mark Natta both performed strongly for the visitors, producing crucial touches in front of goal.\nJets pair Wilmering and Joel Bertolissio were issued with yellow cards during the second half.\nNewcastle have a 2-4 record at home this season, beating Sydney FC 2-0 on December 20 and Melbourne Victory 5-2 on October 24. Results away read 4-2. They have both scored (24) and conceded (23) the league's most goals.\nJust three points separate the fourth-placed Jets (18) and 10th-ranked Wellington (15) on what's a congested ALM ladder. Auckland (24) lead while Central Coast (11) are last.\nNewcastle next travel to meet Western Sydney Wanderers at CommBank Stadium on Saturday (5pm) before consecutive matches at McDonald Jones Stadium versus Wellington (January 23) and Brisbane (January 31).\nMax Cooper will be available for selection after serving an automatic one-game suspension over the weekend.\nMeanwhile, in A-League Women's, the Jets tackle Sydney FC at Leichhardt Oval on Tuesday night (7pm) following a 2-1 derby loss to Central Coast at No.2 Sportsground just 72 hours earlier.\nALM LADDER: Auckland 24, Sydney FC 22, Macarthur 19, Newcastle 18, Brisbane 18, City 17, Victory 17, Adelaide 16, Perth 16, Wellington 15, Western Sydney 12, Central Coast 11.",
