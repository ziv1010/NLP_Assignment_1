  "body_text": "Sylvia Kabene was the heroine for St. Noa Girls FC as they stunned and eliminated Kampala Queens from this year’s FUFA Women’s Cup.\nThe sensational teenage forward bagged a hat-trick as her team cruised to a 3-2 win over the Queens of Soccer in the quarterfinal clash played at Phillip Omondi Stadium.\nShamirah Nalugya (penalty) and Zaina Nandede got the goals for Kampala Queens in a losing effort.\nFresh from guiding St. Noa to winning the FUFA Women Elite League trophy over the weekend, where she was named the MVP, Kabene continued with her impressive form.\nKabene fired the visitors into the lead in the 22nd minute but Kampala Queens were able to restore parity two minutes later with Nalugya converting from the spot.\nA few minutes later, Nandede tucked home and the hosts led 2-1 going into the mandatory break.\nHowever, St. Noa returned recharged and Kabene took matters into her own hands, equalizing in the 57th minute before finding the eventual winner a minute after the hour mark.\nThe visitors held off pressure in the closing minutes to see out the game and advance to the semifinals.\nThe result puts an end to Kampala Queens’ quest to clinch a double, having won the FUFA Women’s Super League title already.\nSt. Noa is likely to face reigning Champions She Corporate FC in the semifinals. However, Kawempe Muslim filed a petition against She Corporate, and a decision from FUFA is still pending.\nThe other semifinal will see Amus College School taking on Uganda Martyrs Lubaga WFC. It is worth noting that semifinals are played on a home-and-away basis.",
