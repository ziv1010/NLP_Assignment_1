  "body_text": "Prince William has traveled back to Switzerland to support England’s Lionesses as the team is set to defend its crown against Spain in the final match of the 2025 UEFA European Women's Championship. And this time he brought Princess Charlotte with him. The royals were among the many England fans in the stadium at St. Jakob-Park in Basel on Sunday. Last summer, Prince William also went to the men’s final of the European Championships, with Prince George at his side.\nEarlier this month, William was at the Lionesses match against the Netherlands during the group stage on July 9 in Zurich. As patron of England’s Football Association, known as the FA, he visited the team's training center at St. George’s Park ahead on June 30 before the Lionesses departed for Switzerland. As Prince of Wales, Prince William also shared a message of well wishes for the Welsh team, which made history as the team made its first appearance ever in the tournament this year, on Instagram Stories on Saturday.\nPreviously the president of the FA until 2024, William presented the trophy to the Lionesses when they won at home in 2022. But he caught criticism from the British media when he did not travel to Australia when the team made it to the Women’s World Cup final in 2023. (He later apologized, but he did meet with the team before they flew down under that summer.)\nKing Charles issued a personal message to congratulate England women’s football team after they won the semifinal in Geneva last Tuesday. “Your journey to this stage has been nothing short of remarkable, showcasing the skill, determination (and test of nerve!) for which your team is so rightly celebrated,” the King wrote on social media. “Knowing the Lionesses' fighting spirit, I suspect we are in for another thrilling encounter on Sunday. Your achievements continue to inspire countless girls and women across the nation, proving once again that with dedication and teamwork, anything is possible.”\nThe Lionesses have had a dramatic tournament so far. While the team beat the Netherlands and Wales handily in 4-0 and 6-1 matches, respectively, the pressure has been on since day one when England became the first reigning champion to lose its opening match at the Euros, losing to France 2-1. England managed a win over Sweden after a nail-biting shootout in the quarterfinals. The Lionesses finally squeaked out a win against Italy in the semifinal thanks to a goal by 19-year-old rookie Michelle Agyemang in the dying minutes of the match that kept the team alive into extra time.\nRachel King (she/her) is a news writer at Town & Country.
