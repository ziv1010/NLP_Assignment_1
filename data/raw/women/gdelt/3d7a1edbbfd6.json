  "body_text": "Denver, Colo. – Over the past seven or so month, a celestial event of epic proportions has been in the making above the Centennial State. Denver Summit Football Club are about to start the inaugural season in the National Women’s Summer League. The roster build has been going well with Colorado natives, proven NWSL talent, and projects. The one missing piece was a major league or national team star.\nToday, its brilliance was revealed when local starlet Lindsey Heaps and the glimmering Summit jointly announced that the two parties had agreed to contractual terms, that will bring Heaps back home. This is one of the biggest moves of the NWSL offseason and the biggest get for the club, outside of the stadium location.\nHeaps will turn in her prized OL Lyonnes France kit and dawn Denver’s forest green, white, sandstone red and sunny yellow colors starting this June, at the conclusion of the 2025-26 European season. The contract is a three and a half year deal through the NWSL 2029 season.\nWhat sparked the alignment was passing hello and football-related conversation between Heaps and Denver’s newly hired General Manager, Curt Johnson. The unexpected crossing of paths took place at DICK’S Sporting Goods Park, ahead of the United States Women’s National Soccer Team match with Ireland.\nDuring today’s morning press conference, Heaps commented that conversations, with Lyonnes’ permission, continued and ultimately escalated during the past three months.\nThe exchanges lead to the Golden, Colorado native appreciating Denver’s vision, seriousness to build a championship program, and intent to recruit marquee players, whether domestic or international. In turn, Summit’s Front Office team became convinced that Heaps was a winning lottery ticket. And that ticket they bought and are about to cash in on it.\nIn an interview with the Associated Press Heaps said, “I think they align with all of my beliefs in how they see the team, how they see it becoming successful, and the investment that they’re putting in,” she continued. “And then hearing (Summit FC Head Coach) Nick (Cushing) and how he sees football, I think that was a huge deciding factor for me as well as I wanted to be with a good coach. So that was exciting.”\nIt will be a challenge for the Great Horan (is that still her nickname now that she’s married?) to go straight into midseason coming off the European calendar. To say nothing of the presumed captain of the expansion side joining midseason. They should be settled and ready for her for her arrival. She’ll be the face of the club on and off the pitch, elevating them within the league and market.\n“Lindsey will bring a world-class level to our team and represents the ambition of this club on-and-off the field,” Cushing reiterated during the press conference. “Lindsey has won at every level of the game. Her leadership, talent, and professionalism will continue to raise the standard for Summit FC when she arrives this summer. We are thrilled to welcome a hometown player back to Denver as we work to win championships and grow our club and community.”\nDenver Summit FC first team practices will take place this weekend in metro Denver. All 14 signed players are expected to participate.\nTheir inaugural home opener, aka, “The Kickoff,” is scheduled for Saturday, March 28, 2026, at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver.\nThank you for reading Burgundy Wave.
