At the very minimum they are expecting the ten per cent rise taking it to €5billion+ per season.\nThe Times report on Netflix, UEFA and the Champions League – 8 October 2025:\n‘Uefa and the European Football Clubs (EFC) organisation — formerly known as the European Club Association — are changing the way they sell the TV rights to the Champions League and other European club competitions from the 2027-28 season.\nThe biggest change is one designed to appeal to the global streaming platforms and it is understood Netflix has already been sounded out to gauge its interest. Amazon already shows one Champions League match per round in the UK, Germany and Italy, while Apple has the global rights to Major League Soccer, and Disney is considering bidding for live sports.\nThe platform that wins the global rights would have the first pick of Tuesday games but would have a limit on the number of matches featuring one team — so, for example, it could not select Real Madrid for every match.’\n‘Netflix has also [already] bought the US rights for Fifa’s 2027 and 2031 Women’s World Cup.’\n‘The sale of Uefa’s rights for the other Champions League, Europa League and Conference League matches will allow broadcasters to bid for multiple markets at the same time — for example, Discovery/TNT Sports or Sky could bid for the rest of the games in all the five major markets: UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and France.\nThe American sports marketing agency Relevent is selling the rights to the competitions on behalf of Uefa.\nSources said the expectation was for at least a 10 per cent increase on the annual value of Uefa’s income from club competitions from €4.4billion at the moment to €5billion, and possibly even higher. The Premier League’s annual earnings from domestic and overseas TV deals are £3.6billion.\nHigher media rights income will means clubs involved in European competition will cash in even more — the new Champions League format launched last season brought a 25 per cent increase on the previous cycle.’\n‘Relevent is also expected to consider bids for the rights for between three and six years. Uefa have previously sold the rights every three years but Relevent secured a six-year deal with CBS for the US rights from 2024-30 worth $1.5billion.’\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
