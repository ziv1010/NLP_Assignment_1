  "body_text": "Alex Scott reveals how Arsenal tried to recruit Naomi Girma\n- USWNT defender Naomi Girma moved to WSL giants Chelsea last week\n- She joined from San Diego Wave in the NWSL\n- Arsenal and Lyon were among the clubs also interested\nLast week saw the transfer record for a women’s player smashed when USWNT defender Naomi Girma completed a $1.1m (£890,000) move to Chelsea from San Diego Wave.\nThe 24-year-old was one of the most sought after players this month as Arsenal and Lyon were also credited with interest. However, it was Chelsea who won the race to sign Girma ahead of their domestic and European rivals to significantly bolster their chances of winning the WSL title and Champions League.\nGirma was unveiled by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday ahead of their league meeting with Arsenal. Sonia Bompastor’s side got one over their rivals with a narrow 1-0 win to extend their lead at the top of the table, but it seems Chelsea also came out on top off the pitch.\nGirma’s announcement ahead of the meeting against Arsenal would have rubbed salt in the wounds and former Gunner Alex Scott revealed at half time she was sent to convince the defender to move to Arsenal instead.\n\"I'm just asking for a friend here, because like I mentioned, there were a number of teams after you,\" Scott said on BBC Sport on Sunday. \"Arsenal sent me along to the directors' box to try and help you be a Red, but it didn't turn out. So I just need some feedback.\"\nGirma replied with a laugh: \"You were amazing!\"\nUnfortunately for Scott – and Arsenal – it seems Girma’s mind was already made up as she described the decision to join Chelsea as an ‘easy choice’ in her first interview with the club website.\n“I’m so happy and really excited to be here,” Girma said. “It doesn’t feel real.\n“There are a lot of things about Chelsea that made me want to come here - the culture, the winning mentality, staff and players. It’s a top environment to learn and grow in.\n“Right now, that’s what I’m looking to do. It was an easy choice for me.”",
