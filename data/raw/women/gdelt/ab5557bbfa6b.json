Tisch often had interactions with Epstein about various women in files released publicly.He was very brief with the comments each time, but Goodell indicated the league would investigate if needed.'Absolutely we are going to look at all the facts,' Goodell said. 'We're going to look at the context and try to understand that. We'll look at how that falls under the policy. I think we take one step at a time. Let's get the facts first.'\nThe emails, which were sent in 2013, were released Friday by the Department of Justice among 3.5 million documents related to Epstein's sex trafficking case and were first reported on by The Athletic.\nThe NFL had 10 head-coaching vacancies this season and nine of them went to white men. The one minority hire was Robert Saleh by the Tennessee Titans. He's Lebanese and also has previously been a head coach with the New York Jets'Teams are trying to get the coach they think will help them win,' Goodell.\nThe Rooney Rule has been in place since 2003 and it requires teams to interview at least two external minority candidates for head coaching positions and for some executive roles.Goodell was asked about the possibility that some NFL teams might satisfy the Rooney Rule when they have no intention of hiring a minority candidate.'I would dispute the context of the question,' Goodell said. 'I think the Rooney Rule has been seen as a positive by our clubs by giving them an opportunity to look at a diverse set of candidates.'They make the choice, ultimately, but I think it has shown them the value of looking at talent where you might not know it or might not see it.'As for recent reports that Belichick won't be selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, Goodell said the former Patriots head coach should be a clear entrant.'He's the second winningest coach in NFL football and six Super Bowls as a head coach and two as a defensive coordinator, that's a Hall of Fame career,' Goodell said. 'Bill Belichick deserves to be in the Hall of Fame.'Goodell emphasized that the NFL has nothing to do with the voting process.Goodell was asked about the reported sale of the Seahawks and he said the trust of the late Paul Allen requires the team to be sold. Owner Jody Allen is handling that.'Eventually the team will need to be solid in accordance of that (trust). It will be Jody's decision on when she does that and we will be supportive of that.'Goodell said reports that the Seahawks were fined $5 million for failing to be in compliance with league ownership requirements were 'not true.'--Goodell praised the level of officiating and said he's not sure the league has ever seen higher quality.'I'm so amazed at how good our officials are,' Goodell said. 'These guys have to make a split-second decision. They have proven over and over they are very wonderful at what they do ... it's a difficult sport to officiate. It's fast, it's quick and we have to use technology to prevent the obvious errors.'I think replay assist has been a terrific advance and we need to expand on it.--The NFL will host nine international games in 2026 across four continents. London will host three games. Landing one game each will be Paris, Madrid, Munich, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro and Melbourne. The New Orleans Saints will play in Paris and the Los Angeles Rams will play in Australia.'We're hearing from cities all over the world who want to host these games,' Goodell said. 'They want to get more American football.'Goodell said his goal is to annually have 16 international games so every NFL team is playing in one.--Goodell said there hasn't been much dialogue with the NFL Players Association about expanding the season by one game to 18.'We have not had any formal discussion and, frankly, very little informal discussion,' Goodell said. 'It's not a given that we'll do that. It's not something we assume will happen.'--Goodell said security for the game is tight but normal for Super Bowls. He also thinks halftime performer Bad Bunny will put on a good show.'This platform is used to unite people and to be able to bring people together with their creativity and their talents and to be able to use this moment to do that,' Goodell said. 'I think artists in the past have done that and I think he will have a great performance.'--Field Level Media\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nFlip\nEmail\nGet a daily dose of Brazil Sun news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Brazil Sun.\nMore Information(Photo credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images) NFL commissioner Roger Goodell tackled a multitude of controversies surrounding the league...\nNew Delhi [India], February 3 (ANI): Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Monday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the...\n(Photo credit: REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko) FIFA president Gianni Infantino said he supports the reinstatement of Russia and called for...\nHavana [Cuba], February 3 (ANI): The Cuban government has firmly denied allegations that it poses a security threat to the United States,...\nThe president has floated the idea of expanding the country to include Canada, Greenland, and Venezuela ...\nThe president has floated the idea of expanding the country to include Canada, Greenland, and Venezuela US President Donald Trump...\nNEW YORK, New York - U.S. stocks rebounded Monday, shrugging off Friday's losses, and crashing gold, silver, and bitcoin prices.
