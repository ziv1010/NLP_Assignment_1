  "body_text": "As England trailed Belgium 3-1 in the 80th minute of Tuesday’s UEFA Women’s Nations League match, captain Leah Williamson played a first-time right-to-left diagonal ball into the box. Forward Michelle Agyemang, who had only entered the match 41 seconds earlier, watched the ball, took one touch to control it with her right thigh, swivelled her hips and smashed a volley into the back of the net.\nAdvertisement\n“As soon as I touched it, I thought: ‘Just hit it’” Agyemang told ITV Sport. She called it the greatest moment of her young career.\nThe Arsenal academy graduate, who joined the club at the age of six and made her first-team debut at 16 in November 2022, even garnered praise from Belgium head coach Elisabet Gunnarsdottir, who told her after the game that “it was the nicest goal” she had seen this year.\n“It was amazing,” said Gunnarsdottir. “You stand there and just enjoy it. This is what football is about.”\nWHAT a way to make your England debut.\nMichelle Agyemang 💫 🏴 pic.twitter.com/DS4uZPh1uM\n— Lionesses (@Lionesses) April 8, 2025\nAs England prepared for the restart, trailing 3-2, midfielder Keira Walsh gave Agyemang serious instructions. Defender Lucy Bronze thumped the teenager’s chest with both of her hands.\nThe senior England internationals were not telling Agyemang off; their actions were simply a mark of respect. Respect for the absolutely ridiculous goal she had just scored on her debut. The goal gave England life for a brief time but was ultimately not enough to help her country, with England going on to lose by the odd goal in five.\nIt was a moment of quality England desperately needed after a dismal first-half performance in which they conceded three goals in 29 minutes. Sarina Wiegman’s side were slow off the mark. They were sloppy in possession, too. When they lost the ball, England were too open in midfield, leaving them vulnerable to counter-attacks.\nForward Nikita Parris made her first England start in two-and-a-half years after replacing the injured Alessia Russo, who withdrew from camp after a minor knee injury following England’s 5-0 win against Belgium on Friday. However, she struggled to make an impact and lacked the qualities in her hold-up play. She came off on the hour mark, along with midfielder Grace Clinton.\nAdvertisement\nRusso, who has avoided serious injury and is set to return to play for Arsenal this month, is an out-and-out centre-forward, a grafter who uses her strength to take care of the ball and stitch play, but is also becoming a more ruthless penalty-box striker. Her absence was sorely missed on Tuesday when England desperately needed a goal-scoring threat.\nUp stepped Agyemang. Coming on for Jess Park, she was the shining light in an otherwise lethargic England performance. The centre-forward posed Belgium’s defence questions and worked well in tight spaces, both technically and physically.\nThe lifelong Arsenal fan, on loan to Brighton this season, was only called up to Wiegman’s squad on Sunday following Russo’s withdrawal, having initially been named in the under-19s team. On Saturday, she scored in their 5-1 win over Austria, which secured England’s place in this year’s Under-19s European Championship.\nPerhaps Agyemang will be eyeing a spot at the senior Euros in Switzerland instead. She only had one training session with the Lionesses before Tuesday’s game but immediately impressed Wiegman and her team-mates.\n“She’s very, very strong, very technically sound,” said centre-back Esme Morgan, who was right behind Agyemang as she hit the volley. “You play the ball into her and she holds it up well and she is very good at laying it off to bring others into play. Her finishing is great, attacking the ball from crosses, she’s so dynamic and she’s a really smart player. She has great physical attributes, too, to be able to complement that.”\nHelen Ward, head of women’s football at Watford, where Agyemang spent the 2023-24 season on loan, echoes Morgan’s words.\n“She is a great kid, dedicated to her craft, super talented but humble,” Ward told The Athletic. “She has the world at her feet, all the attributes to be a top, top player both in her physical attributes but also her technical ability is very, very good. She has it all. She just needs to keep gaining experience like this and in the Women’s Super League (WSL), and she can achieve what she wants.”\nAdvertisement\nWiegman praised Agyemang’s composure and calmness and said her achievement should be celebrated, a rare comment for a manager who is often reluctant to talk about individuals.\nRusso’s absence highlights the lack of a natural backup striker England have heading into the Euros. Lauren Hemp, out injured at the moment, has played at centre-forward but is not an out-and-out No 9 and brings different qualities.\nWhen asked if Agyemang could fill that space, Wiegman said: “I can’t say that to you right now” before adding she is “an absolute talent”. “Of course, we will keep an eye on her. It’s too early to say now where that goes.”\nThey say to take your opportunities. Agyemang took hers with two touches.\n(Top photo: Alex Bierens de Haan / Getty Images)",
