  "body_text": "—NET Rankings Update (men’s): No. 29.\nMonday afternoon Cardinal news and notes\nThe amount of people who sent in “first time at a Cards game” pictures from this weekend was off the charts. The Cardinal kids are coming back. Nature is healing.\n—NET Rankings Update (women’s): No. 41.\n—Without question, the biggest and most important “back after 4 years away” story of the day.\n—Jon Rothstein, who had Louisville at No. 11 in his preseason ACC power rankings, now has the Cards at No. 24 in his overall power rankings.\n—Five-star Nate Ament discusses ($$) the schools currently at the top of his list, which includes Louisville.\n—The week ahead in Cardinal athletics\nMonday, January 20\nMen’s Tennis vs. Northwestern - 12 p.m. ET (Bass-Rudd Tennis Center)\nMen’s Tennis vs. Xavier - 5 p.m. ET (Bass-Rudd Tennis Center)\nTuesday, January 21\nMen’s Basketball at SMU - 9 p.m. ET\nFriday, January 24\nTrack&Field at Crossroads of America Invitational\nWomen’s Tennis at Middle Tennessee State - 5 p.m. ET\nSaturday, January 25\nMen’s Tennis at #3 Ohio State - 10 a.m. ET (ITA Kickoff)\nTrack&Field at Crossroads of America Invitational\nWomen’s Tennis at UT Chattanooga - 12 p.m. ET\n#10/8 Swim&Dive at Kentucky - 1 p.m. ET\nSunday, January 26\nMen’s Tennis vs. Princeton/Denver - TBA (ITA Kickoff)\nWomen’s Basketball at Virginia - 2 p.m. ET\n—Louisville native and Sacred Heart alum Allie George has signed a deal with Racing Louisville FC.\n—Andy Katz has Louisville at No. 20 in his latest power 37 rankings.\n—Vibes are absolutely off the charts right now.\n—Noah Waterman will be a game time decision for tomorrow night’s showdown at SMU.\n—Virginia head coach Ron Sanchez and Louisville’s Aly Khalifa still have a very close bond from the time they spent together at Charlotte.\n—Frank is the clearcut social media MVP of this team.\n—John Fanta has Louisville at No. 25 in his latest power rankings for Fox Sports.\n—CJ Moore of The Athletic rolls through the latest college hoops power rankings and talks about the Cards being at No. 23.\nNo. 23 Louisville\nThe Cards are hot, winning eight straight and looking like the second-best team in the ACC. It’s another awesome turnaround, especially considering some bad injury luck. One thing Louisville does as well as any team in the country: Set up its best shooter. Ryne Smith has made 68 3s, tied for second-best nationally, and his teammates are always looking to screen for him. Watch how freshman Khani Rooths screens his own man to set up Smith, whose defender is monitoring the roller, when Chucky Hepburn comes off the ball screen.\nThat’s high-level.\nSmith is averaging 4.1 made 3s per game during this eight-game winning streak, and while there aren’t a ton of opportunities to get quality wins in the ACC this year, Louisville doesn’t have any bad losses on the resume and has already beat three of the league’s teams that will be competing for a tourney bid (North Carolina, Clemson and Pitt). The Cards haven’t been ranked since the 2020-21 season, but they’re clearly back after a tough few years, and Pat Kelsey has pulled off one of the more impressive Year 1 turnarounds in the nation.\n—Mel Kiper ranks Tyler Shough as the No. 9 quarterback in this year’s NFL Draft class.\n—St. X topped Trinity on Sunday afternoon to claim its second straight Louisville Invitational Tournament title. The Tigers remain the top-ranked team in the state.\n—Greatest sport in the world.\n—The U of L women’s tennis team opened their spring season with a sweep.\n—The Louisville Cardinal previews U of L at SMU.\n—Could major changes be coming to the new ACC football title game already? It certainly sounds like it.\nPhillips said the ACC could consider giving its regular-season champion a bye, and have the teams that finish second or third in the league standings play in the ACC championship game.\nHe said another possibility is having the top 4 teams play on the final weekend of the regular season: first place versus fourth place, and second place vs. third place, with the winners playing the following weekend in the ACC championship game.\nPhillips said he will have conversations with league head coaches on a conference call next week to get their feedback on the plan — specifically pointing to comments SMU coach Rhett Lashlee made leading up to the game in which he indicated the Mustangs might be better off not playing to protect its spot in the field.\nPhillips also said these conversations will continue at the league’s winter meetings next month in Charlotte, North Carolina, and he has mentioned this is a topic among league athletics directors.\n“The conference championship games are important, as long as we make them important, right?” Phillips said. “Do you play two versus three? You go through the regular season and whoever wins the regular season, just park them to the side, and then you play the second-place team versus the third-place team in your championship game. So you have a regular-season champion, and then you have a conference tournament or postseason champion.\n“That’s one of the options, depending on how you treat the conference champions, or that championship game, you may want to do it different.\n“I have alluded to that in some of our every-other-week-AD calls, and these are some of the things moving forward. We want to have a recap of the regular season, postseason, and what do we think moving forward?”\nSeems like a bit of an overcorrection after one season, but who knows.\n—Gambling writer Guy Bruhn is liking the Cards on the road tomorrow night.\n—Here is the standard AP preview for Louisville-SMU.\n—Like I said, off the charts vibes.\n—Everyone in Louisville besides the team itself is talking about the 8-game winning streak.\n—Rick Bozich writes that Louisville’s Tuesday night test as SMU appears to be the toughest remaining regular season challenge for the Cardinals.\n—And finally, the Mike Rutherford Show is ON the air this afternoon from 3-6 on 1450/96.1 The Big X.
