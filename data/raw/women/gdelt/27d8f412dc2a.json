Five years ago, Ryan Day received a promotion from offensive coordinator to head coach at State. In a press conference on Tuesday, Day shared some advice for Jake Diebler, who made a similar leap from program assistant to program leader over the weekend.\n“Congratulations to (Jake) and his family,” Day said. “I was able to go over to the press conference, and I thought he did a great job stepping into a tough spot this year. I’m excited to see what that looks like going forward.”\nQuick note: If you watch the press conference, Day called Diebler “Josh,” not Jake. Ope!\n“You have to trust who you are. You have to learn from your experiences,” Day said. “You aren’t starting from scratch. I think that’s the thing as I look back on that experience for me. There were guys on my staff that were already here. But then there were other things you had to change. There were already players there in place, so you had to continue what was working, but you (also) had to identify things you had to improve.”\nDay said it would do Diebler well to enhance what Ohio State has done well and correct what Ohio State hasn’t done well in recent seasons. Such a task takes discernment, a trait Day said comes with increased experience in the role.\nUltimately, Day believes Diebler’s relationships – even more than the adjustments and the Xs and Os – will determine his success.\n“It comes down to relationships,” Day said. “It’s building relationships with your staff, giving them great direction as a leader. You’re not an assistant coach anymore. You’re the head coach. Your role has changed. It’s important to make sure you’re communicating at a high level, giving direction to everybody and then making sure everybody’s accountable to do their job at a high level.”\nThat’s all solid advice from Day.\nDiebler would be smart to accept it.\nA KING’S ENDORSEMENT. On Sunday, new Ohio State men’s basketball coach Jake Diebler received a shoutout from one of the Buckeyes’ most prominent fans, LeBron James. The Ohio State Hoops account on X shared a graphic of James’ congratulatory Instagram post this week.\nHow's that for an endorsement? @KingJames | @JakeDiebler pic.twitter.com/0HhyKOyU4A\n— Ohio State Hoops (@OhioStateHoops) March 18, 2024\nJames has been one of Ohio State’s largest donors and supporters since he entered the NBA in 2003 out of St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron. Had James attended college, the 6-foot-9 forward said he would been a Buckeye (for one season, but still!).\nOver the past 20 years, James has attended several Ohio State football and basketball games and donated gear – including cleats, shoes, headphones and more – to both squads.\nThe Buckeyes were among three finalists to land James’ first son, Bronny, in the 2023 class; however, the four-star combo guard chose USC over Ohio State and Oregon.\nJames’ second son, Bryce, a three-star shooting guard in the 2025 class, holds an offer from the Buckeyes. Bryce made an unofficial visit to Columbus last fall and, in addition to touring the Schottenstein Center and campus, watched Ohio State football beat Maryland, 37-17, in the Shoe.\nDiebler has been involved in both recruitments.\n#LOADING... Former Ohio State guard D’Angelo Russell made history in the Los Angeles Lakers’ 136-105 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Monday. With a deep 3-pointer in the fourth quarter, Russell tied Nick Van Exel’s franchise record for 3s in a season with 183.\nAfter the game, Lakers coach Darvin Ham offered Russell a roaring endorsement to shoot whenever he wants, wherever he wants, for the rest of the season.\n“He has a green room,” Ham said. “Not a green light. A green room.”\nAgainst the Hawks, Russell went 6-for-10 from deep and finished with 27 points and 10 assists.\n“I appreciate (Coach Ham) trusting me to that extent,” Russell said. “I want to feel like like I’ve earned something like that and it wasn’t given. To know that that’s something I put the work in to do and put the work in to continue to do, it seems normal for me, humbly.”\nThis season, Russell has averaged 18.1 points and 6.4 assists per contest, shooting 46.9% from the field and 42.4% from behind the 3-point line — a mark that ranks 11th in the league. (For added context, Russell ranks ahead of superstars Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Jamal Murray and Kyrie Irving in the category).\n“His prowess from the 3-point line, it’s really, really elite,” Ham said. “We need every bit of it.”\nAccording to ESPN Stats and Info, Van Exel needed 80 games to set the Laker’s 3-point record in 1994-95. That milestone stood for 30 years before Russell matched it in his 64th game on Monday.\n“It’s really cool to get credit for it. It’s just really cool,” Russell said. “I don’t what to underdo it or understate it. I don’t want to overdo it. I just feel like it’s really cool to be a part of something like that. I think I did something like that in Brooklyn, as well.”\nIndeed, Russell is correct. He set the Nets’ franchise record for 3s in a season with 234 in 2018-19.\nRussell’s a shooter, plain and simple. As we all know, shooters shoot. There’s no doubt that he’ll keep shooting down the stretch. His All-NBA teammate, Anthony Davis, looks forward to seeing Russell’s shots continue to fall.\n“He’s able to fill up the stat sheet with his scoring, and it’s a big thing for him and a big thing for this team,” Davis said. “There’s been a lot going on around D-Lo, and to be able to do that and have us embrace him, he sees that. He feels the love. That’s good for him.”\n#Loading…\nTHE BEST OF THE BEST. Columbus is ON TOP.\nWell, kind of.\nIn my heart, yes.\nIn a list of the best cities in America to host sporting events, it’s No. 10.\nBut that’s still pretty cool (!)… pretty, pretty cool.\nOn Monday, the Columbus Sports Commission posted a graphic on X that revealed Columbus as the No. 10 host city for sports events in America, according to the Sports Business Journal. Columbus ranked higher than any other city in Ohio, including Cleveland (No. 19) and Cincinnati (unranked). Take that Skyline lovers! (I love Skyline – please forgive me).\nColumbus ranks 10th on @SBJ's list of best host cities for sports events! pic.twitter.com/qpy7AxzFiG\n— Columbus Sports Commission (@ColumbusSports) March 18, 2024\nHere is a look at the top 10 cities featured in the Sports Business Journal’s rankings:\n- Orlando, Florida\n- Las Vegas\n- Los Angeles\n- Atlanta\n- Indianapolis\n- Arlington, Texas\n- New York City\n- Houston\n- Phoenix\n- Columbus\nIn its breakdown of Columbus, Sports Business Journal noted several events the “Arch City” has hosted in recent years, including the 2018 women’s basketball Final Four, the first and second rounds of the men’s basketball NCAA Tournament, the 2024 U.S. Figure Skating Championships and its annual Arnold Classic.\nColumbus will also host the 2024 MLS All-Star Game, a 2024 Premier League exhibition (Manchester City vs. Chelsea at Ohio Stadium), a 2025 NHL Stadium Series game (Columbus Blue Jackets vs. Detroit Red Wings at Ohio Stadium) and the 2027 women’s basketball Final Four.\nSports Business Journal also credits Columbus for the John Glenn International Airport, Hollywood Casino and the city’s growing number of hotel accommodations.\nIf only Columbus had reliable public transportation outside of COTA buses. That’s the only thing keeping this city from climbing the rankings even further!\nSONG OF THE DAY. “Been There, Done That.” - Luke Bryan\nCUT TO THE CHASE.
