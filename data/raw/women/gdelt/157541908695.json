We have no intelligence to suggest that there's any further threat.\"\n**\nAnd in Victoria, a man has been found dead by police in a house in South Melbourne, following reports of an incident at the property.\nDetectives say they are making enquiries to determine the circumstances of his death.\nA local resident says the man frequently harassed other people in the neighbourhood.\n\"I was just waiting for something like this. It had to happen. It was like a recurring thing. He was running amok, he was threatening people, even like seven-eleven's over the road around the corner, the lady on the street, all these sorts of things and he was just out of control. He shouldn't have been out of jail or wherever he was coming from.\"\n**\nMedics in the Gaza Strip say Israel has killed five people in a strike which they said targeted a vehicle east of Khan Younis.\nThe Israeli military says it killed a militant in the strike, who took part in the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, and who it says was employed by the World Central Kitchen charity in the Gaza Strip.\nPalestinian news agency, WAFA, reports three employees of World Central Kitchen were killed when an Israeli strike targeted a civilian vehicle in Khan Younis, in the enclave's south.\nReuters could not independently verify the man's identity and whether he took part in the attack on Israel last year.\nAt least 32 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across the enclave overnight and into Saturday.\nMeanwhile, several people were wounded in two Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon, despite both sides agreeing to a ceasefire on Wednesday.\n**\nLabor Senator Jenny McAllister says her party plans to announce policies for universal childcare ahead of the next election.\nThe federal government has tasked the productivity commission to investigate a pathway for access to childcare for all Australian families.\nThe commission has responded saying childcare could be made more cost-efficient for poorer families, but not entirely free.\nBut Ms McAllister says the Labor Party will continue to search for ways to make life easier for parents across the country.\n\"We've made some really good progress this term. We've already made childcare cheaper for a million families and of course just in the last couple of weeks we've laid the foundations for a stronger workforce by supporting the pay increase for early childhood educators. We have made it clear that we are looking to establish a universal quality childcare service and we intend to go to the next election with costed policies in that regard.\"\n**\nQueensland has made cheaper fares on public transport permanent, following a six month trial.\nAuthorities say the introduction of the 50 cent fares from August has led to a jump in commuter numbers, saving passengers more than $110 million.\nQueensland Transport Minister Brent Mickelberg says network-wide patronage increased more than 16 per cent compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe then-Labor government announced the policy in the lead-up to the October state election, but the LNP adopted the move on its path to power.\n**\nIn football,\nMelbourne City have added another three points to their tally following a 2-0 win over the Wanderers at AAMI Park.\nMariana Speckmaier put the sky blues in front just three minutes before the first half with right-back Alexia Apostolakis putting the points in the bag four minutes into injury time.\nThe win sees City keep their unbeaten record so far in the season, with three wins and two draws, as they hope to maintain the premiership trophy.\nMeanwhile, the Central Coast Mariners needed six minutes to turn Canberra United's advantage on its head, winning the game at Gosford 2-1.\nIn Sunday's schedule, Western United host champions Sydney F-C as Melbourne Victory travel to Western Australia to face Perth Glory.",
