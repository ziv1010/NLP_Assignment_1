US world reach propaganda has hailed the millions of American soldiers, who invaded Korea and the French colonies of Indochina and dozens of Third World nations, which had been colonies occupied by European or US military, as anti-communist heroes. ‘Better dead than red’ was a slogan repeated with bravado to counter demonstrations against these undeclared wars.\nBest not to lose sight of the reason behind the arming of Hitler’s Nazi Wehrmacht having been anti-communism or anti-Soviet Union in protection of colonial capitalism’s hegemony during its brutal wholesale systematic economic misadventure, the Great Depression.\nA Human Decimation Nuclear Armageddon Threatens Even As The No Longer Bearable Colossal Expenditure of Resources on Wars and World War Preparation Prevents Protecting Life On Earth During Climate Change\nThe era of the Cold War can be understood to have been yet another heavy Wall Street investment in a future world war, which leveled off in a static nuclear confrontation of unacceptable mutual destruction, before the Soviet Union more or less self-destructed trying to match the much wealthier USA in an arms race.\nAfter 9/11 and the dissolution of one of the two major communist nations, the Soviet Union, a new pretext for permanent war of regime changes in the Third World became prosecuted under the operational logo ‘War Against Terror.’ The CIA with its European and Middle East branches secretly armed, funded and trained a series of radical Islamic terrorist armies to use in its genocidal regime change wars first in Afghanistan against a popular women liberating Socialist government in Kabul, then in Iraq, to have Sunni terrorists attack the majority Shiite, then used both to destroy wealthy Libya aided by US and NATO warplanes, then to invade and decimate Syria, and then Iraq again, before sending CIA created infamously deadly ISIS back into Afghanistan at the end of a twenty year US/NATO occupation war. [261A]\nConcurrently, it didn’t take more than a few years before the government of the still wealthy superpower USA began to cite the new Russian Federation as its adversary, a nuclear weapons armed adversary, though Russians had never threatened the USA, and also never forgotten that in 1918, the US had invaded Russia with two armies, killing its citizens in trying to overthrow the newly proclaimed Soviet Russian revolutionary government. [261B] Similarly the Chinese, witnessing their country designated as America’s other main adversary, will have not forgotten the destruction, sacking and looting of Beijing and other sites by American and British troops in 1900.\nAs the present insanity of preparations for nuclear war against Russia and China takes place before our eyes, just as earlier when USA threatened nuclear war against the Soviet Union and China, we should remind ourselves of the danger of Americans again using nuclear weapons. Let us remember that the motive for the first and second US use of atomic bombs is now generally accepted to have been to intimate the Soviet Union, even though most of Russia’s cities lay in ruins with 28 million of its citizens dead as a result of the Second World War that had just ended.\nWhat insidious minded cabal of powerfully influential Americans pressured President Truman to order these two genocidal nuclear war crimes without even consulting the top commanding military during WWII? Apart from them having been war crimes the same as the incendiary bombing of some 60 other Japanese cities, the crimes of atom bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki were committed while US warfare was being conducted under the commands of Generals Eisenhower and MacArthur. Yet, the two Atomic bombs were dropped without their approval and without their being informed beforehand.\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur, Commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East, who was not consulted before the atom bombing and destruction of two Japanese cities, saw no military justification for the dropping of the bomb. “The war might have ended weeks earlier,” he said, “if the United States had agreed, as it later did anyway, to the retention of the institution of the emperor.” [262]\n“Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary,” wrote Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, [263[ “the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn’t necessary to hit them with that awful thing.”\nGiven what we know about the expected deadly effect nuclear war would have on the planet and all life on Earth, it would seem that a good amount of people everywhere would have come to realize the horrific danger to themselves, their loved ones and all fellow human beings. There should be millions of concerned citizens throughout the world demanding that Americans respect the rest of us and our planetary home, end all plans and preparations for nuclear war, and explain why a war with Russia and China is even contemplated.\nIt would appear that basically too few voices demanding sanity arise against the overwhelmingly deceptive propaganda and mesmerizing self-indulgent entertainment power of CIA controlled Western satellite-reach mainstream media. [see New York Times amazingly comprehensive article: “Worldwide Propaganda Network Built by the C.I.A.” December 26, 1977, New York Times]\nMonopolized and controlled media have been inculcating quiet acceptance of the status quo ‘protection’ of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), a doctrine of US military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender. The acceptance of, and trust in, this frightening hair trigger status quo seems to be holding, the continuing wildly super insane talk of possible first strike victory notwithstanding.\nPublic ignorance and apathy is a concern for survival of the specie, warned former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark in his forward to nuclear physicist Micho Kaku’s To Win a Nuclear War: The Pentagon’s Secret War Plans. The authors of this book, both university physicists, document how the nuclear policy of the U.S.A. has not been one of deterrence as publicly stated, but rather has been one of threatening the use of nuclear weapons. Though Kaku’s book was first published in 1986, the policy it described has been widely documented elsewhere over and over again, ever since and right up to today.\nFormer US Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who had spent half a century defending nations and individuals attacked by Western colonial capitalist military powers, wrote that public ignorance and apathy is “as much a concern for survival of the specie as the unthinkable power to destroy the world wielded by a few men in a mindless manner.”\nIn 1986 Ramsey Clark Described His Government As Humanity’s Ever More Threatening and Treacherous Enemy and His Warning Is More Valid than Ever\n“The consistent underlying psychology of the United States, which has held the lead in nuclear war capability and capacity throughout these 40 [now 77] years, should be understandable to anyone who has ever known a violent neighborhood bully. The government of Americans means to have its way through the use and threatened to use of superior force. It will lie. It will deceive. It will kill. It will escalate the threat and use of force to the highest level it dares. It will bluff, dangerous as that can be. It will do whatever is must to dominate. It does this in the face of the fact that its very preparation for a nuclear war may destroy all life. American war planners busily devised strategies for crippling the Soviet Union with revealing names like BROILER, FROLIC, SIZZLE, SHAKEDOWN, DROPSHOT, and VULTURE. The number of Soviet targets to be destroyed grew in number from 20 cities in December 1945 to 200 cities in 1949 and to 3261 total targets by 1957. The number of times the use of nuclear weapons has been contemplated by Americans is unbearable.\nWhat is to be said of leaders with the mental acuity and moral perceptions revealed by these disclosed words and deeds? They are at best enemies of life without understanding. Psychologically, they disconnect all feeling for the beauty of the planet — a rose, an impala in motion, a baby’s hand, a Confucian analect, a Bach cantata, a parable of Jesus, pilgrims bathing in the Ganges, a crowd watching a soccer game in Rio, the subway in Moscow, the skyline in Manhattan. They cannot think or feel about the human meaning of what they do.\nA single Trident II submarine can inflict more death than all prior wars in history. Twenty-four missiles, launched while submerged, each with seventeen independently targeted, maneuverable nuclear warheads five times more powerful than the atom bomb that destroyed Nagasaki, can travel 5,000 nautical miles to strike within 300 feet of 408 predetermined targets. Nuclear winter might follow even if no other weapons are used.\nNo nation or individual can be permitted to possess the power to destroy the world. An imperative need is for an informed and active public struggling for its right to survive.”\nBoth before the First World War and before the Second World War, the world public basically simply watched the arms build up and other preparations for war. This lackadaisical blandly interested public attitude seems to be present again. In America and Europe criminally insane investors in war are free to openly race forward with the inventing and manufacturing of ever new and novel weapons of mass destruction, while planning and propagandizing a need for war. From time to time, spokespersons for their political, media and military lackeys discuss their prerogatives for war as if the rest of us didn’t matter. The following is an example.\nHeadlined article: “Britain changes policy so it can use nuclear weapons in response to ‘emerging technologies” Mar 17 2021 264\nLONDON — The U.K. has changed its defense policy which may enable it to use nuclear weapons in response to “emerging technologies.”\nThe country’s 111-page Integrated Defense Review, published Tuesday, included a subtle line on when the U.K. “reserves the right” to use nuclear weapons.\nIt says the U.K. could use nuclear weapons if other countries use “weapons of mass destruction” against it. Such weapons include “emerging technologies that could have a comparable impact” to chemical, biological weapons or other nuclear weapons.\nSo if British officials feel or think they feel an attack of whatever sort, they have the right to cause the possible destruction of all life on the planet.\nThough the threat of nuclear human annihilation has remained constant, the expenditure of human and planetary resources for investments in war, including for nuclear war, have increased to the point of making it impossible to protect the planet from the effects of planetary warming and the continuing degradation of habitat Earth’s ecosystems.\nGlobal military spending rose to $1.7 trillion in 2017. 265\nAlready in 2020, the U.S. Defense Department’s budget of $778 billion was larger than the combined spending of the next eleven largest militaries: $761 billion (China, India, Russia, UK, Saudi Arabia, Germany, France, Japan, South Korea, Italy and Australia). Source: Stockholm International Peace Institute Data for the year 2020. 265a.\nIn 2023, as this book goes to print, announcements of ever more ‘marvelous’ new nuclear weaponry have never ceased to be presented as positive steps forward. This is our present planetary predicament, but no situation, especially absurd situations, lasts forever. People asleep eventually wake up, of course not always in time, as in the cases of the First and Second World Wars, whose preparations went on in front of everyone’s noses and mesmerized silent acquiescence just as the extreme expenditure in nuclear weaponry now.\n“Propaganda is the executive arm of the invisible government.”\n“There are invisible rulers who control the destinies of millions. It is not generally realized to what extent the words and actions of our most influential public men are dictated by shrewd persons operating behind the scenes,”\n…warned Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud and a pioneer in theorizing about human thoughts and emotions, who was the public relations expert in President Wilson’s Committee on Public Information during the First World War and is considered the ‘father of propaganda.’ A few years after the First World War Bernays wrote,\n“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Propaganda is the executive arm of the invisible government.” 265b\nInvestors in War, Along With Planners and Promotors of War, Must Be Recognized As Criminally Insane\nThose business tycoons of America, who intentionally prepared a Second World War, made the multi-nation Holocaust possible and are thus responsible for all that human suffering in astronomic amount, now plan and prepare for a Third World War, but are not thought of as demonic and criminally insane for their knowing full well the wars they prepare bring great horror and pain, death and destruction, as all wars do.\nInitially Before the War Powerful Americans Were Hitler’s Helpers\nMay the reader be brought to picture in his or her mind the inside of factories in the United States of America operating in league with factories in Nazi Germany.\nSee Glossary for an ‘Overview of the Incredibly Tight Strictures of the Versailles Treaty Intended to Prevent a Defeated Germany From Ever Threatening War Again’)\nConsidering the financial and human resources needed for humankind survival from the effects of global warming and planetary degradation, it is apparent, or will be apparent eventually, that the present mega enormous expenditure of financial and human resources on war preparation and ongoing wars will doom a viable future existence for a majority of the human race and its planetary home as we know it. How can humanity possibly expect to effectively address the existential threat of the climate crisis from within a system that continues to enable war as a profitable enterprise?\nThe pressing climate emergency compels us to fully reckon with this historical pattern of America’s financial enterprises, which foment massive death and destruction under the pretense of promoting freedom. Let us all confront the actuality of this lawless accumulation of capital by criminally insane investors in war.\nThat the Second World War was a ‘Good War,’ ‘Good’ triumphing over ‘Evil,’ has been a gargantuan deception ominously conditioning all of humanity to tolerate post war US led neocolonial genocide ad infinitum! Nuclear bombing, introduced at the end of WW II by the United States of America, is one ominously threatening End Game. The inability of humanity to protect itself from the effects of climate change and the degradation of the planet represents the present possible alternate or simultaneous occurring End Game.\nHumankind is trapped in a horrific period of suffering in the bloody hands of imbecilic investors in war, who own most Western governments and mainstream media and who cannot stop themselves from planning war, even terminal nuclear war, since they know from centuries of experience that a great deal of money can be made through war.\nMay the Truth About the Openly Diabolical Origin and Purpose of the Second World War, and the Deadly Indifference to the Multi-nation Holocaust, Stimulate Confronting the Dark Reality of American Finance: the Profiting from Death and Mass Destruction: America’s Investment in Hitler, Nuclear Terror, Neo-Colonial Regime Change Wars and Current Preparations for World War against Russia and China.\nEnd Notes – Chapter Eighteen – Inhumane Heritage /War Investor Control of Planet Earth\n261.“Worldwide Propaganda Network Built by the C.I.A,” December 26, 1977, New York Times\n261A.

Wilson, a Democrat, did not take any senators to the peace talks, offending the Senate. Republicans win control of the Senate in 1918 and oppose the League of Nations, arguing that it gives away too much American sovereignty. When Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge offers a series of “reservations” to make the treaty more acceptable, Wilson rejects them. Wilson takes his case to the American people, but suffers a stroke that leaves him incapacitated. Without his leadership, the Senate twice rejects the treaty, by votes of 38-53 in 1919, and 49-35 in 1920. The United States never joins the League of Nations. Senate Rejects Treaty of Versailles. 266\nVersailles Treaty Punishments and Strictures\nIn the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, the victorious powers (the United States, Great Britain, France, and other allied states) imposed punitive territorial, military, and economic provisions on defeated Germany. In the west, Germany was forced to return Alsace-Lorraine to France. It had been seized by Germany more than 40 years earlier. Further, Belgium received Eupen and Malmedy; the industrial Saar region was placed under the administration of the League of Nations for 15 years; and Denmark received Northern Schleswig. The Rhineland was demilitarized; that is, no German military forces or fortifications were permitted there. In the east, Poland received parts of West Prussia and Silesia from Germany. In addition, Czechoslovakia received the Hultschin district from Germany; the largely German city of Danzig became a free city under the protection of the League of Nations; and Memel, a small strip of territory in East Prussia along the Baltic Sea, was ultimately placed under Lithuanian control. In sum, Germany forfeited 13 percent of its European territory (more than 27,000 square miles) and one-tenth of its population (between 6.5 and 7 million people).\nOutside Europe, Germany lost all its colonies.\nSummary of Salient Articles in the Treaty of Versailles:\nArticle 45: As compensation for the destruction of coal mines in France, Germany must give the output of German mines in the Saar basin to France for 15 years. Article 51: Alsace-Lorraine will be returned to France Article 80: Germany will respect the independence of Austria. Article 81: Germany recognizes the complete independence of Czechoslovakia. The new country contains a mountainous area known as the Sudetenland containing a large German population. (Given to Czechoslovakia to provide a natural buffer against Germany) Article 82: Germany recognizes the complete independence of Poland. (The new country contains land formerly part of Germany to give it access to the sea)\nceed 6 battleships, 6 light cruisers, 12 destroyers, and 12 torpedo boats. No submarines are to be included. Article 198: The Armed Forces of Germany must not include any air forces. Article 231:\nGermany and her Allies accept the responsibility for causing all the loss and damage to the Allied Powers. Article 233: Germany will pay for all damages done to the civilian population and property of the Allied Governments. [The figure was later set at $33 billion]. Article 428: To guarantee the execution of the Treaty, the German territory situated to the west of the Rhine River will be occupied by Allied troops for fifteen years. (After 15 years the area was to remain a demilitarized zone)\nOther provisions: German factories could not produce war materials. Most of the German navy was handed over to the Allied countries to replace Allied ships lost in the war. New nations of Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia were created out of the former Austrian-Hungarian Empire. New nations of Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia were created out of land won by Germany from Russia. The League of Nations, a world body to promote peace and prevent future wars, was established.\nArticle Ten of League Charter: A. If a member went to war other members will stop trade with or use force against the aggressor. B. League members also agree to guarantee existing political boundaries. C. Germany and the Soviet Union are denied membership.\nPart of the disempowerment of the defeated Germany was the stripping away of her colonies, which provided a substantial amount of raw material for her industrial production.\nArticle 119 of the Versailles Treaty required Germany to renounce sovereignty over former colonies and Article 22 converted the territories into League of Nations mandates under the control of Allied states. Article 22 of Covenant of the League of Nations (signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles), highlighting the three mandate classes: Red: Class A (ex Ottoman) Blue: Class B (ex German Central Africa) Yellow: Class C (ex German South West Africa and Pacific)\nGermany’s overseas colonies covering nine million square miles of territory, with a population of 13 million were awarded by the League of Nations as follows: German South-West Africa to South Africa; German East Africa to Britain, with a small strip to Belgium and the port of King to Portugal; France took the bulk of Togoland and the Cameroons, a portion going to Britain. German islands north of the Equator were mandated to Japan; German New Guinea, Nauru and the islands south of the Equator went to Britain, German Samoa to New Zealand and remaining islands to Australia. (The provisions of the Versailles Treaty strikingly provided that Germany’s overseas colonies would remain firmly in the racist hands of white colonialist and their associate for Asia, Japan, US President Wilson’s sensationalized call for emancipation of colonized populations outside Europe notwithstanding.) German rights in Shandong and Jiaozhou were ceded to Japan, to the resentment of China, which refused to sign the treaty. (US President Wilson is said to have favored turning over the former German colony of Shandong, in Eastern China, to Japan rather than return the area to Chinese control.)[267] All Germany’s pre-1914 trading concession in Egypt, Morocco, Liberia, Siam and China were terminated and the Allies were to have concessions for five years on certain imports into and exports from Germany.\nInitially, the Nazis made some organizational efforts to promote reclaiming overseas colonies taken away from Germany by the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I. Agitation was conducted in Germany by means of newspapers, magazines, conferences and “Colonial Exhibitions,” meant to keep open the Colonial Question. With the onset of World War II, the Nazi State focused on other priorities, in which the search for Lebensraum in the East of Europe was foremost.[268\nGlossary End Notes\n- Senate Rejects Treaty of Versailles, Annenberg Classroom. https://www.annenbergclassroom.org/timeline_event/senate-rejects-treaty-versailles/.\n- to ensure that Japan did not refuse to join the League of Nations according to Louise Chipley Slavicek, in her The Versailles Treaty, Infobase Publishing, 2010, p. 65]\n- Reichskolonialbund Explained, https://everything.explained.today/Reichskolonialbund/and Evans, Richard J.
