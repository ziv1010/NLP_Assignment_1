The path stops abruptly, reminding me of the tower that used to be here, connected by an overpass. Now it's completely bricked up, painted a muted yellow to match the other three walls. A perfect blank canvas.\nThe tower itself is long gone, deemed too costly for the city to maintain. It's a shame. The cost would have been a drop in the ocean compared to all the other spending going on at the time. Perhaps it wasn't about cost at all. Perhaps the tower was simply too beige, and not enough bourgeois, for Newcastle's changing image.\nI'm lost in my thoughts and memories of the past when I hear footsteps on the gritty concrete behind me. I turn to see Scott, his grey hair its usual wild mess and a wide grin on his gorgeous face.\n'I got distracted by the graffiti,' he explains. 'The layers upon layers done by thousands of people, with no overarching plan... yet somehow it's come together to create this masterpiece. Incredible!' He waves his arms around the space excitedly.\nHis eyes scan the concrete around us. This dead-end space has attracted late-night partiers and teenagers looking for fun. The graffiti is thick on every wall and empty cans and broken bottles pile in the corner. The lingering smell of urine bothers my nose, but I try to ignore it.\nThere's a pillow too without its pillowcase, and my heart aches for the person who chose this place to sleep. Was it a young person? Someone with nowhere else to go? Someone who, if life had taken a slightly different turn, could be sleeping in a plush king-size bed in one of the renovated apartments just across the road?\nMy mind fills with worry and what-ifs. I've always had a deep care for kids, a natural maternal instinct from a very young age. People loved to point it out. When I played with my dolls: 'You're going to make a great mum one day!' When I babysat my sister's newborn and rocked him to sleep: 'Just wait till it's your turn!' When my good friend consoled me at the end of a long-term relationship: 'Your time will come, don't worry!'\nAnd, when my doctor confirmed my time was up, 'have you thought of getting a pet?'\nI've lived in this city my entire life, but for the 30 years the tower was open, I never once took the climb to the top. I'd always intended to, just never found the right time. Or the right person to do it with.\nApparently, the view from up there was incredible. Panoramic vistas of the city, the harbour and the sea. A place to watch the coal ships coming in to port, see the giant fig trees in the park from up above. The best place to fully appreciate everything this great city had to offer.\nYet I remember my sister complaining that the stairs were a killer, all 180 of them. And exposed to the elements, a cold wind pierced her skin every step and rattled the metal frame. She said by the time she got to the top she was too exhausted to truly appreciate anything. And the windows were terrible. The scratched Perspex made her feel like she was wearing glasses of the wrong prescription while trying to make out the shape of Whibayganba.\nPerhaps she was trying to make me feel better knowing I'd never been to the top.\nNow that I'm looking at the bricked-up wall before me, do I wish I'd made the climb? The Novocastrian rite of passage. That dream is over and it's too late now. Newcastle has moved on, the tower forgotten. Other than those brief moments when someone finds a commemorative bottle opener in the back of their cutlery drawer and exclaims, 'Remember that weird-shaped tower in town?'\nFor 30 years this concrete ramp was a hive of movement. People navigating mobility scooters, riding bikes, pushing prams. The ramp connected to the base of the tower, which then connected over to Hunter Street Mall. A thoroughfare for workers and tourists alike. Now, it's a ramp to nowhere.\nOr is it? Scott wraps me in a hug and together we look out at the view. The sun is setting to the west and the ferry returns from across the harbour, framed by one of the rectangles. The golden strip of sky at the horizon blends seamlessly into the blue sky above. Other than the ferry, the harbour is empty. A still, perfect calm. I wonder if it would have looked different 40 metres up. Same view, but from a different angle.\nI ask, 'If the tower was still here, you would have climbed it with me, right?'\nScott holds me a little tighter, but he doesn't answer. The fact neither of us have kids is one of the things that brought us together later in life. Two lives well-lived, but with a mutual understanding that there'd always be something of a gap.\nI lean a little further into Scott's warmth, his strong arms holding me close. The ferry docks at the wharf and a flock of white corellas changes direction overhead, looking to settle in one of the park's big old fig trees. The view at the top of the ramp is absolutely stunning. Even without the tower to climb.\nNoodle's Moment of Glory\nby Glen Fredericks\nI was born for greatness, forged in the fires of destiny - and also under the dining table.\nIt was a Tuesday morning. The kettle was boiling. Someone dropped toast. And there I emerged, squinting into the light like a newborn warrior glimpsing his first battlefield.\nSome say heroes are shaped by adversity; I was shaped mostly by crumbs. But still, greatness was in my veins. I could feel it. Mostly in the tail region, where feelings are stored. My name is Noodle, though in my imagination it's something more epic, like \"Lord Noodleford the Swift.\" My legs, you see, are short but powerful. Well... short. But destiny knows how to work around these things, and it had plans for me.\nEvery hero requires a rival. I, unfortunately, have Sir Wiggleton the Third. He is everything I despise in a dog: well-groomed, symmetrical, and unbearably smug. His coat shines like polished mahogany. His owner speaks to him exclusively in French, which is, frankly, unnecessary on Australian soil.\nWhen Sir Wiggleton struts past, all chest and attitude, I often project the thought \"Move along, Sir Wigglebum\". My telepathy, to be clear, works none of the time, but I refuse to let that undermine the science. Yet somehow, Wiggleton always snaps his head in my direction, eyes squinting, as if he felt the insult. It is my greatest joy.\nPreparing for the Dachshund Dash was no simple feat. A champion must train as such. Leaf Sprints: Every afternoon, when the wind carried a crisp, fluttering leaf across the lawn, I would explode into motion at an estimated 4.5 kilometres per hour. Possibly five, on days when I hadn't eaten too much. Vacuum Combat: My sworn enemy. Huge, roaring, uncaring. I fought it bravely, barking with the fury of 10,000 warriors from behind the couch. One must know when to pick battles. Focus Training: staring intensely at a single piece of kibble, I would channel all inner energy... until I fell asleep. Meditation is important. Spiritual Digging: To dig is to know oneself, and there's still a bone out there somewhere.\nDestiny enjoys burying things.\nMy owner observed all this and said, \"Noodle's having a silly five minutes.\" Silly? No. I was preparing for glory.\nThe Dachshund Dash is the doggy equivalent of the Melbourne Cup, except shorter, louder, and with significantly more drool.\nThe moment we arrived, chaos assaulted my senses. Dogs in costumes. Owners shouting. Children squealing. A man selling hot chips walked past, and I briefly lost contact with reality. I inhaled deeply. The air tasted like grass, anticipation, and chicken salt. I attempted telepathy with my owner, signalling her chosen one was ready.\nShe smiled. \"Who wants a drink of water?\"\nTelepathy remains a work in progress.\nAcross the field stood Sir Wiggleton, wearing a miniature racing saddle and a look of aristocratic disdain. I projected another thought beam at him: \"Nice saddle, Wigglebum.\" Again, he flinched. Victory.\nWe lined up behind the starting hay bale barrier. The whistle blew. The crowd roared. And I launched myself forward in what I believed was a blur of aerodynamic sausage.\nA streak of lightning. A brown furry torpedo slicing through the air. I was later informed I was moving at a \"gentle trot\" and was \"in last place out of six.\"\nFake news, obviously. Up ahead, the pack thundered down the field with frightening commitment. Sir Wiggleton was already near the front, ears pinned back like a show-off. The others followed, legs pumping like tiny pistons. I, Noodle, remained calm. Greatness requires patience.\nThen, destiny intervened. A human, clumsy, careless, possibly an agent of fate, dropped a fresh, steaming sausage roll near the sideline. Time slowed. Wiggleton spotted it first. His eyes widened. His nostrils flared. He veered sideways so violently he nearly rolled himself. The others followed instantly. The entire leading pack folded inward like magnetised hot dogs, crashing into each other, tumbling head over paws.\nA hay bale toppled. Someone screamed. Wiggleton yelled something in French, possibly a profanity, possibly \"pastry!\" And me? Because I was so far behind, I simply trotted past the heap of wriggling chaos.\nA perfect Steven Bradbury moment. Just like the speed skater, the hero of heroes, who won gold because everyone else wiped out in front of him. I felt spiritually connected to him. We're both athletes, after all. Both misunderstood champions. The crowd erupted in cheers. I crossed the finish line. I won. I, Noodle, had Bradburied them.\nThe officials placed a tiny ribbon on my collar. Cameras flashed. But in that moment, I felt no joy. By the time I reached the scene of the great sausage roll incident, they had eaten all of it. Every crumb. Every flake of pastry. Gone. My stomach whimpered. My heart cracked in two. The true spoil of war, devoured without me. I stared at the empty grass, wondering how victory could taste like nothing at all. History will remember this as my Bradbury moment.\nI, however, will remember it as the day destiny cheated me out of lunch.\nSea of Hope\nBy Julie Pearce\nWhen all else failed, she headed for the surf. She enjoyed the coarse grit between her toes as her feet sank with every step. With little care, she flung her towel upon the sand. Sunlight spilled over her face, warming her skin, revealing her lined, weary features. In the distance a couple strolled along the waters' edge. Their figures small against the endless sweep of sand.\nBoard riders broke the silence, paddling out to meet the swell. Their voices raised in excitement as a curious dolphin joined them, circling in playful dives, teasing and changing direction each time they neared. Everyone seemed to have a tribe.\nShe wondered if the feeling of belonging had passed her by, or was it simply taking the long way around?\nFrom an early age she had sat on the sidelines of life. Made to feel bad, just for being herself. Ignored by her peers in the schoolyard. Too peculiar in her habits, too quiet when she spoke. Her peers were all about parties and boyfriends. She couldn't envision a partner by her side. Surrounded by others, she had never felt so alone.\nThe only companion throughout her teenage years had been a waif of a dog with questionable breeding. All he'd ever required was a belly rub and the chance of a stroll around the block. They were a pair of strays, forgiving of each other's faults. He had been a sloppy eater. She, a professional worrier. Quiet evenings had been spent cuddled together upon the couch. When Ernie passed she had been the sole mourner.\nStuck in a negative loop, she possessed neither desire nor energy to interact with anyone. Unfocused, her mind would spin like a tumble drier, endlessly spiralling. What if a plane crashed through her bedroom window? What if she was murdered in her sleep? What if they stopped making her favourite pizza? The one with pineapple, mushrooms and generous lashings of cheese that combined to dribble out of her mouth onto her chin?\nShe was reminded by her therapist that her struggles didn't define her, although her path would be laden with potholes. The medication made her to tired and grumpy. Sleeping for whole days until the dosage had been adjusted. She dreamed of feeling normal, happy, and with purpose before admitting to herself that life didn't work like that. It could be complicated and messy.\nA trip to the beach to relax and place things in perspective had been exactly what the doctor had ordered. It had only taken a single outing to seal her unease about what might be lurking in the shallows.\nAs the water gently lapped around her legs, she felt a tickling sensation, then an unexpected tug. Her anxiety betrayed her as she imagined jaws preparing to strike. Turns out she had been saving her lungs for this moment. She thrashed around in the water, much to the amusement of bystanders.\nTheir laughter faded as her shrieks became louder. Flushed with embarrassment, she tripped over in her hast to flee.\nOblivious to the calls concerning her welfare, or the strands of seaweed clung to her ankles and embedded in her tangled mass of hair. Allaying her fears had been tedious. It would be some time before the fear loosened its grip. Small acts of courage such as lingering by the shore allowed the ocean to coax her back within its reach.\nShe applied a thick layer of sunscreen, adjusting her hat. Already, she could feel the telltale signs on her shoulders. The expanse of the sea grounded her in the moment. Finding solace as each wave washed away a layer of tension. She began to breathe more easily as the salty spray reached her nostrils.\nLeaning back, she observed the passing parade as the beach started to fill. Nearby, soft music drifted from a forgotten radio. She caught snippets of conversations. Families trudged along, dragging towels and fold-up chairs, the children sprinting on ahead with hopes of glimpsing the allusive dolphin. Even the parents, initially reluctant to come, found themselves searching the horizon, drawn by the promise.\nHer train of thought was broken by a raucous screech. She squinted skyward as the gull crossed overhead, wings flapping. The bird touched down, balancing on one leg as if plotting the next move.\nHer gaze was fixed firmly on the scavenger. She raised the remains of her sandwich to her lips, savouring the last bite. The gull was already airborne scoping out the next target. She was done with bullies.\nShe turned back to the ocean. The bulk carrier anchored off shore sounded its horn as if alerting the beachgoers to the dolphin's presence. A familiar, bottle-nosed silhouette broke the surface. A crowd gathered, mesmerized by the spirited antics. Phones caught every fleeting second. The dolphin arced in the air, performed a somersault before vanishing back into the water.\nThe woman gathered her belongings, paused to look back and smiled with peaceful knowing. Interactions with others were becoming simpler. A brief nod. A smile. A connection, however slight was beginning to form between herself and others.\nPot of Gold\nBy Lukas Dzambo\nWe rumbled along the dirt road, waves of coffee lapping the lip of my thermos as the truck's wheels navigated the worn-out gravel.\nJack jolted forward with a sharp gasp. \"You're meant to drive around the potholes mate\".\nHe shifted himself upright in the passenger seat, and flicked the music from 'FM' to 'disc', filling the ute cab with classic 80s folk.\nMy brother hated new music, \"braindead hipster garbage\" he was always calling it.\nI had to be careful about which coffee shop to take him to whenever he visited me in town, god forbid somewhere that used a QR code for their menus.\n\"You know, you could also drive, I thought we were splitting the load.\"\nI'd been driving for about five hours at this point, my arms were aching and my eyelids getting heavy.\nWe'd just spent the day up in the bush around the Myall Lakes, it's always been Jack's favourite spot.\nWe flew past fields of long dry grass, droning clicks of cicadas filling the late November air.\nThe air had that familiar sickly-sweet smell that always lingers after rain.\nWe'd just hit a few stormy passages on the highway before turning off onto this road.\nIn the distance, the storm clouds turned to a mist, and a thin rainbow began stretching across the sky.\n\"Would you look at that!\" Jack stretched his arm across me and pointed to the stroke of colour painted in the sky.\n\"Yeah, think that means we have good luck or something?\"\n\"Pretty sure that's only when it's a double,\" Jack tapped me with his elbow.\n\"Oh right, that sucks ...\"\n\"Don't worry, there should still be a pot of gold,\" he grinned.\n\"Well of course, but you have to get past the leprechaun of course.\"\n\"True, probably not worth the hassle.\"\nWe kept driving for a few minutes, letting the windows down to enjoy the breeze as the sun sank closer to the horizon.\nThe wind swept through the car, carrying little bits of dandelion and the faint scent of a faraway bushfire.\n\"You know, I think the whole pot of gold thing is more of a metaphor ... Like it's a bit of a subjective pot, beauty in the eye of the beholder or some crap.\"\nHe was resting his arm against the door, propping up his chin like one of those ancient Greek dudes ... what a moron, I thought to myself.\n\"What are you on about Jack, there's not an actual end of the rainbow,\" I chuckled back to him.\n\"How do you know? Have you ACTUALLY checked, or are you just surrendering to your boring grey world.\"\nHe said this with a weird sincerity, it felt like I may have actually struck a nerve.\nWe shot a couple jabs back and forth and returned to our mutual silence, meditation among the soft chorus of the bush, with the occasional 'bang' of the truck-bed pulling us back up.\nPart of what Jack insisted on kept nagging at me, his childlike sincerity seemed to dig its way into my heart, like one those cartoon worms in kids' books that make a home out of some poor lad's apple.\nMaybe I had become cynical, maybe part of me was chipped away on the concrete corridors of the city, maybe I had lost some colour from my eye.\nDamnit Jack.\nI swung my ute around, dodging some shallow puddles and tree roots.\nBy the time I reached the treeline the sun had started its final stretch, eclipsed by the rolling hills in the distance. I didn't have much time.\nBetween the trees I found a narrow bush path, the grass was trodden down, painting a faint line through the brush.\nI kept trudging through, checking the darkening sky every few minutes to make sure I was staying the course.\nI came across a small creek; it bubbled across the ground and ran away down the hill.\nI followed along until it began to widen, eventually becoming a decent sized pond, flanked by a rocky bank on either side.\nI don't know what I had hoped to find, part of me wanted to find Jack sitting out on the shore, chucking handfuls of pebbles across the still water like we used to do as kids.\nThe sun fell below the mountain, and the rainbow faded into the faint stars.\nI sat myself on a nest of roots and caught my breath.\nOut here the only noise was my thoughts, and the soft babble of the creek.\nJack and I used to spend hours playing in streams, chasing the next big adventure as we barrelled through nature's playground.\nI didn't even feel it start, but tears began to roll down my face, I realised this was the first time I've felt close to my brother since we lost him.\nMaybe I've found my pot of gold.\nSemaphore\nBy Karen Whitelaw\nYears before, Ramit's grandmother had the insight to snap up an old World War III fort when they were decommissioned, ignoring the scoffing neighbours in their glass mansions overlooking the ocean.\nIt wasn't long before those same neighbours came fighting through the wind and storms to his grandmother's steel door, hammering to be let into the safety of the underground rooms. Later, Ramit's family would help them pick around the twisted steel beams and shards of glass, and pack whatever was salvageable. It was never much. A coffee tamper. An antique desk. A robotic window cleaner. Nothing you'd choose to take on a new life. Those neighbours were gone long before I came.\nRamit and I have chickens, two goats, and grow spinach, tomatoes, lettuce and beans on the roof, which we swap at the Collectives with people who have thumbs with different colours to ours. I met Ramit after my family bought passage on an old Sydney ferry taking people from our drowning overcrowded city to a sanctuary settlement on the south coast. The sea was rough. To amuse my eight-year-old sister I fashioned two flags out of chopsticks and my father's blue-checked handkerchiefs. The captain's mate taught her semaphore. To impress me, I think. My mother was seasick, although I suspected, at my hormone-laden age of 15, when everything looked like sex, that there was another reason she spewed the tiny amount of food she was allotted over the side. I never got to find out. After 12 days we reached the promised land. Twenty men with shotguns were lined up along the pier to meet us.\n'We've got too many refugees,' the man in black said. 'Move on.'\nOver the loudhailer the captain begged the settlers to let us disembark. Couldn't they see the black clouds on the horizon? We'd leave straight after the storm. For an answer, all 20 men aimed their shotguns at the people squashed on the deck, not having the money for an inside ticket. We heard them bashing on the doors, screaming to be let in. Inside, Gemma and I clung to Dad.\nOur captain looked for a landing along the coast. The cliffs were high and the frequent gales had stripped all the sand off the beaches, leaving sharp jagged rocks. The storm hit around midnight. The ferry lurched and bucked. A fierce wind forced rain through the cracks in the shutters, drenching us. The word 'cyclone' gushed through the cabin like running water. Gemma, clutching her flags, frantically signalled SOS as if someone would help. She wouldn't stop, even when I lassoed her waist and pulled her close.\nAgain and again, we felt the ferry lever over the tip of huge waves. Heard the timbers creak sickeningly. With one arm around Gemma, I, gripping the timber seat, dreading the moment we'd go into freefall. Screaming as the ferry crashed nose-first into the trough, crying out as we slammed painfully into timber and metal and other sprawling bony bodies. Convinced each time would be our last. Then the waves came so close together the ferry had no time to straighten up. The sea devoured us.\nRamit and his father found the survivors on the rock ledge below the fort the next morning. Five of us, all shivering among the dead bodies, silent, blank eyes staring out at the deceptively calm sea. My mother, father and sister were not there. I have not given up on finding them. Whenever Ramit's family heard of a body washed up along the coast we'd pack a bag with food, slip a knife into our belts, and make the journey.\nThere's just Ramit and me left now, and he won't come anymore. He says after ten years there'd be no one to find. Don't think he's mean. He's pragmatic. I am, too. Usually.\nEvery month at the Collectives, I'm scanning the crowd for a shock of red hair, a thin balding man with a slight stoop, a child with my mother's face, and when I see them my heart flips and I rush forward. The person turns at my touch but it's never them. One look at my stricken face and these strangers always have a kind hand for my shoulder; everyone is searching for someone. My name is all I have left and I give it freely.\nRamit and I sleep in the old signal room. Once he found a rusty spring bed base in a derelict hotel near the beach. We scrubbed it with sand and relaced it with fencing wire we swapped for eggs at a Collective.\nWe started padding his grandmother's old mattress with chicken feathers until some scavengers climbed through the lookout one night and stole our previous brood of chickens. That's the trouble with having to spend so much time underground; you don't see what's happening up top. But at least you escape the heat and the storms and the marauding gangs. Mostly. It's a balancing act between what's worse and worse.\nEarly one morning I'm in the lookout checking the tide. The sea has been rough for weeks and we need to supplement our salted fish stocks before we hunker in against the summer heat. I see a small ferry speeding across the bay. I call Ramit and he's here immediately. We watch until we're sure it's coming for us. The chickens scrabble around our feet, squawking to be released for the day. The goats butt our legs. We herd them back into the tunnel.\nBefore I lock us in, I take one last look. I can make out a woman standing on the bow.\nShe's waving two blue-checked flags.\nThe tree\nBy Fred Koegelenberg\nI pressed my back against the old, peeling tree as the wind caressed my hair. I had lain beneath that tree through multiple sunsets, looking to the sky for clues, clues to anything.\nThe steaming sun brushed my burnt skin as I continued to wail. I was too weak to walk, and there was no one for miles. Life was draining from me as more blood spilled from my wound.\nI used to live in a house close to where I was now. It had beautiful plants growing from each corner and intricately designed wooden furnishings. But the best part was life, how my ears filled with the sound of family laughing. And my dad, oh my dad, how he showed me why I should smile every day. I don't know if fate hated him or if God was against him, but one day, he never woke up.\nLife felt bleak after that, yet the sun still shone. My mother couldn't bear it; they were inseparable, and after that numb day, guilt poured her a drink. Gosh, how much I loved them both. She wasn't as strong as my dad. I wish I could've helped before she left, too. After that, life just kept going. Nothing stopped. People felt pity, but that didn't make time slow down. A blur filled my vision, maybe from pain or from my tears. Either way, I had to get back on my feet.\nI went to three different foster homes before I started running. Most weeks I would pack a bag and go on another adventure. That house was the last of my memories, and I couldn't forget it. Cars would always hurl down the road near my deserted home whenever I got there, but every second I stepped foot in that place was worth it.\nI just wanted to live, and that house had helped me before. The memories held a sense of hope that this wasn't real - because at that time, it couldn't have been. It was too quick, like a dream you couldn't stay in because you needed to wake up.\nMost of the time, when I was at my rustic-looking house, I would search every dusted room, having a gut feeling that maybe it was just a game and I had to find them. But it wasn't. It never was. Being taken again and again felt like being ripped from the most important organs keeping me alive.\nI just wanted life back. I wanted them to live with me and die with me. I was only ten when everything happened, and things still didn't fully make sense. What was I meant to do? When I finally tried to live without running from everything, my foster parents were the Morrisons. They were in their 40s to 50s, and smoked a lot. Yet that didn't seem to matter because I knew they didn't want to tear me apart straight away. They cared for me. On weekends, they used to drive me to my old home and let me run my fingers along the corridors, never pushing me too far, finally letting me take my time.\nThey showed me that even when time is going fast, you can make it slow. I felt like I could trust again, and soon, I did. As the years went on, the more their lungs consumed smoke, until they couldn't stop coughing. It scared me - the thought that every year I spent resting instead of running might disappear as their tough voices grew scratchier. Their bodies seemed thinner, bonier, frail-looking with their pale grey skin. I knew they had stopped taking precautions ages ago, and I could see them becoming absent-minded. Now I just wish I had talked to them sooner.\nI remember how they cared about my obsession with the past and helped slower than time ticked. I loved them for that - for their kindness that helped my heart forgive. I loved them...\nOne week, after years had passed with them, I wanted to look back at my house, knowing it would open a wound. But back then, I could slowly patch it up. Back then, I had time to resolve my problems. So we went. The house looked like it had been untouched for ages, webs covering every corner except my heart. That's when one mistake destroyed everything.\nMrs Morrison asked me to light her new cigarette as we sat on the porch. I swear, I didn't realise how badly my hands trembled as I looked behind her. A tree, my tree, stood behind her. The very tree where we spread my parents' ashes.I wasn't ready to come back. I never should've.\nI didn't even realise the lighter had fallen until a flame crawled up my shoes. But it was too late. The house that had held me together was now being torn apart because I couldn't focus on what was in front of me.\nThe Morrisons tried to help, but the fire spread too quickly, and smoke engulfed them - presumably killing them. My legs couldn't move back then, unlike my confused tears. Without thinking, I ran toward my old, dying tree and lay underneath it.\nAnd now, here I am, lying on the soft soil next to my mother and father. The blood on my legs is finally starting to dry. But I know this was all my fault - everything. I had a second chance, and now everything is gone except this old, decaying oak tree. My life isn't liveable unless someone finds me now, but I'm not even sure I want that.\nThe people in my life who cared about me and showed me kindness are gone, and now I stand between life and death. I know I was meant to die, either today, yesterday, or many years ago. I was meant to pass.\nYet I know it's inevitable. I know I should survive - for them.\nBitter Sweet\nBy Brenda Proudfoot\nFriday\nThere she goes again, wittering on at Mavis like she's some kind of imbecile. I've told you before, haven't I, how Diane uses that ridiculous baby voice whenever she speaks to the residents: I see you've eaten all your vegies, Mavis. What a good girl. Would you like to join in this afternoon's sing-song? It's all your old favourites . . .'Pack up your Troubles', 'The Road to Gundagai' ...\nOh, for heaven's sake! The girl doesn't realise we were young women during the '50s and '60s, not during the First World War. Oh, look out, she's coming my way.\nWould you like to join us, Anne? \"No, thank you, Diane. I'm heading to my room to finish this month's novel for book club.\"\nDid you see the look on her face? Like anyone still reads books!\nWhat's that? I shouldn't be so unkind? You're right, I suppose. It's just that Diane has no idea what kind of lives we've led.\nTake Mavis, for example. Until she had that stroke last year, she was as sharp as a tack. Did you know she was a high school principal for almost 20 years? She had to resign when she got married, but after the rules changed in the 1960s, she returned to teaching and rose to the top of the ranks.\nTuesday\nI'm not up to much today. Mavis was very poorly yesterday and passed away early this morning. I can't tell you how much I'll miss her. We were partners in crime. There aren't too many people in here who take an interest in the outside world. Mavis had a wonderful sense of humour, and whenever living here got me down, having a laugh with her cheered me up no end.\nWednesday\nI wasn't keen on this month's story. It was about a writer and his rescue dogs. The mischief those dogs got up to! I wouldn't have put up with them for a week! Still, book club's the highlight of my month. It's open to anyone who lives in the village, not just the nursing home residents.\nSunday\nAndrew called in. He couldn't stay long because Jess wants to take the girls to the ocean baths. I'm so proud of our boy. He has a smile or a friendly word for everyone.\nThursday\nIt was Mavis's funeral today. It was like a military manoeuvre trying to load us oldies into the minibus. It's not easy for us to manage the step. Harry has the best of it - they load him in, wheelchair and all. It was like one of those ridiculous maths problems: If there are eight nursing home residents including a man in a wheelchair, and one driver, how many walkers can you fit into a minibus? The funeral was sad. It was quite clear the celebrant knew nothing about Mavis' life or personality. Apart from her niece and her family and a couple of people from church, we were the only ones there.\nFriday\nI'm feeling down in the dumps. I know you'd do your best to cheer me up if you were here. We always tried to see the funny side of life, didn't we. Especially when times were tough. I remember having a laugh with Andrew at Centrelink. We were waiting in the queue to apply for a government funeral benefit. Your husband has died. Collect $200. It was so bizarre, it made us laugh.\nSometimes, I think life is a lottery. Some of the loveliest people I've known have been snatched away in their prime, whereas others live on and on. There's no rhyme or reason to it as far as I can see. I think Charles Darwin was on the right track. It's all down to random selection.\nSunday\nDiane's on duty today. She's brought in her dog, Monty, to show the residents. He's one of those sausage dogs. I've never had much time for lapdogs. We always had working dogs, didn't we. We couldn't have managed the farm without our kelpies.\nOh, no. There she goes again in her ridiculous baby voice. She's gooing and gaaing at that dog like you might to a six-week-old baby! I have to say, though, he's a lovely dog - so calm and cuddly. He's curled up on Harry's lap and every now and then, he lifts his head and looks at Harry with his big brown eyes. There's something special about eyes. When our kelpies looked up at us, it was as if they could read our minds. Diane's doing the rounds of the residents. She's one of the better carers if I'm honest. She takes time to talk to each of us. She's showing everyone something on her phone. Several people have smiled or laughed out loud. She's heading over my way. It must be a good joke as it seems to appeal to everyone even those who hardly ever smile.\nHi Anne, would you like to see a photo of Monty in a dog race?\nI smile obligingly and she holds the phone so that I can see the photo. And there's Monty bounding through the air, full of joy and youthful exuberance. I feel a surge of love and gratitude - not for the dog but for you, my darling. Do you remember how you stood at the altar waiting for me to walk up the aisle? Then you turned and looked at me. I've never forgotten the joy I felt when I saw my love reflected in your eyes.\nClarity\nBy Andrew P.J. McMahon\nSince Detective Katie Ross moved to Newy, she'd loved the foreshore run. At sunrise, sunset, and everywhere in between. Katie wasn't alone; all of Newcastle seemed to be out. Most days she shared the path with walkers and surfers taking in the salt breeze, but today she ran because she was angry. Frustrated and haunted by her past, she felt a familiar darkness creeping in.\nCompared to the Blue Mountains' misty haze and fire-ravaged heat, Newy won every time. She missed the mountains' views and unrivalled trails, but outwitting a serial killer in the wilderness demanded a change of scenery. That case brought Katie to Newy, and she fell in love with its coastal grit.\nThe afternoon was spectacular, but the air felt heavy. As she approached Carrington, the chirping of waking bats filled her ears and nose. To the north, the skies were clear, but to the west, a gigantic thunderstorm was rapidly rolling in. As Katie passed the fish markets, she looked toward the silhouette of Stockton and felt a familiar, cold frustration. Ten kilometers due north, as the crow flies, was where they found Jane, deep in the Stockton sand dunes. The problem with dunes is that they shift; they swallow evidence. Katie had no footprints, no loose fibers. Nothing. All she had was a victim in her early 20s with what would have been rich, flowing red hair. The only distinguishing features were a tattoos of all sizes, that had, so far, provided no clue to her identity.\nKatie's Jane Doe was destined to become another unsolved mystery in the Newcastle Herald archives if they didn't get a breakthrough soon. It felt like a dead end, and for Katie, that was where the darkness lived. The thought made her stomach tighten. Jane deserved better. When Katie felt like this, seething, it was her running shoes that paid the price. She was metronomically pounding her way through Honeysuckle now, dodging pub patrons scurrying for cover. The first drops of rain sounded big, almost heavy, as they exploded on the pavement. Katie quickened her pace, recalculating her route in an instant. She wouldn't make the beach. She aimed for the shelter of Queens Wharf.\nSuddenly, the world lit up with a gigantic lightning strike, followed by a thunderclap that shook her chest. Katie counted the seconds. \"One mississippi, two mississippi... boom.\" The storm would envelope her soon.\nHer breathing was hard, but the footpath was clear; no one else was silly enough to be out in this. The pine trees near Scratchleys were heaving as she flew past. Then, the sky opened. In an instant, the rain was torrential, and Katie, drenched to the bone, ducked undercover at the Queens Wharf terminal. The sky was now midnight black. As the rain pelted the metal roof, the rhythmic drum-drum-drum triggered something deep and dark. Katie closed her eyes and was suddenly back in that tin shed in the Megalong Valley. She could smell the rust and the damp earth. She was tied up, staring down the person she had trusted with her life, the man who had betrayed her. Katie snapped her eyes open, her heart racing.\n\"I'm in Newy now,\" she muttered, her voice lost in the roar of the wind. \"You're safe. He is gone.\"\nSeeking distance from the sheltering crowd, she noticed a stairwell across the way. She scooted through the doorway as the rain pelted sideways, the droplets literally bruising her face. She shook off the water and slowly ascended the stairs. At the top was a room looking out across the harbour. Graffiti decorated every inch of the walls, a coded welcome to the tourists who usually flocked here for the view. Every color of the rainbow captured slogans and tags, a foreign language known only to the writers.\nThe room was dim, but as Katie turned to leave, a streak of light from a distant break in the clouds hit the wall near the doorway.\nShe froze. There, written in a dark, brownish-red at eye level, was a symbol. It was two snakes interwoven around a hammer, sitting on top of a rising sun. Katie gasped, her detective's brain snapping into focus. She had seen this before. It was on Jane's left shoulder blade, the same size and colour. Katie's hands shook as she snapped a photo. She frantically scoured the rest of the room. Lower down, under the window overlooking the harbour, she saw more writing in that same reddish pen: \"Evie loves Daz\" and \"Newy Sunrise Crew Forever\".\nShe punched in a number, her eyes never leaving the wall. \"Jenny, it's Katie. I just sent you a picture. Tell me it is what I think it is.\" She waited, her breath held. \"Exactly. I found it in the lookout room at Queens Wharf. Get forensics here immediately and some probies to seal this off. Don't let anyone near these walls.\"\nAs Katie hung up, she looked through the window, framing the view exactly like the camera lens had moments before. The storm had passed as quickly as it had arrived. The sunset was gleaming over the water, and the darkness was lifting. The Stockton ferry was making its way toward her, its silhouette sharp against the clearing horizon. For the first time in months, Katie felt a spark of genuine vigour. The \"Jane\" in the dunes finally had a name: Evie. The storm had passed through her and left something behind. Clarity. As she looked toward the distant Stockton sands, she knew right then she would find the rest of the Crew. She would find Evie's killer.\nSmall town talk\nBy Rhonda Mackey\n\"Look Mummy, pretty circle in the sky.\"\nGilly had seen the rainbow and couldn't help but smile in spite of the deep-seated worry swilling in her gut.\n\"That's a rainbow Alex. It means that good things will happen.\"\nChecking the fuel gauge, she murmured quietly to herself; lord knows we could use some good luck for a change. And as much as she was determined not to, she couldn't help but think back on recent events. That knock on the door late at night and the policeman standing with her mother.\nTwo steps in, two sentences spoken, and her body had sunk to the floor. She looked back over her shoulder to the white curls poking out from the edge of the fluffy pink blanket covering her daughter as she slept on the back seat. Her hand clung to Alex's foot which lay curled under his bottom.\nLotty seemed to draw comfort from the physical presence of her brother and had been for months now, the shadow he couldn't shake. Gilly smiled, thinking how she'd been the same with her brother, until he started to become aware that having a little sister hanging off him was a bit off in the eyes of his mates. But she'd not had to deal with the sense of fear and abandonment that her two could sense rather than speak of.\nThey were still too young to understand death. But then thought Gilly, who does? Certainly not her. Her fuel was getting low and she wondered if she was doing the right thing. She just needed to get away and think.\nThings at home were closing in on her. The recent argument with her father.\n\"You've let the town down, Gilly. They raised that money for you and what do you go and do. You don't really know this bloke. His history with women, what if he's not who you think he is?\"\nGilly felt so mixed up inside when she'd looked at her father's face. The tears in his eyes just made her feel sick. And what if he was right and all her instincts were wrong?\nBut when she was with Simon it didn't feel wrong. She'd watched him closely with the kids; he just seemed to love them - and it wasn't forced - she knew, in the way every mother knows if there is anything off, her maternal radar would roar.\nEspecially since the kids were both so young, and vulnerable. She'll never forget how much comfort they all got over those next few, awful weeks after the accident, she and the kids, snuggled together in her bed at night. How she'd kept their father's pyjama top folded under her pillow, taking it out when alone and just holding it up to her face. Breathing him in. Bringing him back - if only for as long as his smell lingered. And when she felt sad, but in control, she knew the kids settled. Lotty's crying eased off and Alex's frantic running to the door every time someone knocked - making sure he greeted them with the news. \"My Daddy's dead.\"\nHe didn't really know what dead meant, but he knew that like show and tell at preschool, it was big news. Gilly worried about his lack of understanding, but it kind of protected him from what she felt; her grief, spiralling between despair and anxiety.\nNow she had that awful row with her father simmering in her mind.\nThe money the town raised at the country dance had been spent on the kids. It wasn't a fortune, but it did pay for their new clothes and a three-wheel trainer bike for Alex. So .... did that give the good women of the town's CWA the right to judge her? She wondered exactly what had been said, that had made her father so upset. He'd yelled at her and that really hurt. Seeing that, his face had softened. \"You'll be alright on your own, Gilly. Lots of women in town have raised their kids alone.\"\n\"Oh great....so you want me to be like Mrs Kincade? Who always has a red nose and wobbles on her Mary Janes each morning after a night with the sweet sherry? That your idea of widowhood and clean country living Dad?\"\n\"She does a lot for this town Gilly. Every School of Arts event, she's there. And she did lots of cooking for your fundraiser.\"\n\"And that's your secret to real happiness is it, Dad? Loneliness and lamingtons? Well, I'm sorry. Times are changing - not everyone is happy doing those things. I didn't do them before. And now...... I don't know yet what I want. But it isn't that.\"\nLooking back through the rearview mirror she could see the faint colours of the rainbow receding. Soon nothing would remain of that spectrum of promise. Like all hopes and dreams of her previous married life. If going out to a weekend barbecue could in one fatal minute of a driver's miscalculation, lead to death, and mean that a young husband and father would never return home, how could she possibly make plans for the future?\nLife was a lottery. She wasn't a gambler, but she did know one sure thing: nothing was more important to her than those two in the back seat, now curled up together, bent knees and legs entangled, heads touching, blissful sleep dissolving all worry.\nShe would do whatever she had to - keeping them safe and loved ... always.\nTrapped\nBy Peter Gittins\nShuffling quietly along the road he glanced at the fading streetlamp that cast a dim shadow on the rockface below.\nHe took a final drag on his cigarette - a long, slow, deliberate draw - before stubbing it on the ground with a shoe worn with age and barely fit for purpose.\nHis clothes had seen better days, too. A green hoodie covered his frail upper body, and his oversized black pants bore the scars of a hard life on the street. His dark and weathered face, partially covered by a black beanie, was well known despite him making every effort to hide it over many years.\nHe turned around one last time to make sure he was not being followed, placed his grubby hands on the shopping cart, and squeezed into the thick undergrowth near the side of the road.\nDark storm clouds were assembling on the horizon and the claps of thunder in the distance convinced him that he needed to move quickly.\nHe jammed his cart into a small crevice to protect it from the impending storm, unwrapped a brown tarpaulin, grabbed a frayed sleeping bag, torch and water bottle and continued up the hill.\nThe familiar path through the bush was narrow and hazardous. Roots grew close to the surface and recent rain had made everything wet and slippery.\nWhen he finally reached his destination, he darted through the open doorway and made it to the far wall of the now derelict building just as the sky opened.\nHe threw his kit onto the floor and then proceeded to sweep the floor clean with a ragged cloth that he always carried with him.\nHad he not been a trapped by the prison of his memories he may well have taken the time to admire the astonishing view over the Pacific Ocean and the mansions he saw from the decayed window frame. But that was not his reality and had not been so for such a long time.\nFeeling safe and warm despite the pelting rain and cold autumn breeze, he peered at the plethora of graffiti sprayed on the walls. Some new, some old, some carrying faded political messages and some with the tags of neighbourhood kids who frequented the skatepark below.\nThese images meant nothing to him, but they were a distraction at least and gave him something to briefly focus on. A boom of thunder and streak of sheet lightning shattered his thoughts. He was suddenly back in a field wading through a sodden rice paddy, knee deep in tepid water with both arms raised carrying a rifle above his head.\nHis body ached from three days of toil in the hot, unforgiving, jungle, but he knew he had to press forward.\nBarely twenty years old he found it hard to understand why he was there, but he felt proud to be alongside his mates who zigzagged silently behind him.\nThey inched forward, sweat mixing with naked fear, and headed for the designated landing zone that was marked out by a bright flare just ten metres ahead.\nThe whirl of the chopper was almost lost amongst the loud pop of bullets that thudded into the small bank close behind.\nWith one final, desperate dash he dodged another flurry of enemy fire and scrambled onto the floor of the chopper with his feet resting perilously on the landing skid bar. His mates jumped in behind, glad to be getting out of the hell that had unfolded below. As the chopper climbed into the sky, Bluey looked across at him. His fear was now replaced by relief, and all six of them were thankful that no one was coming home in a body bag.\nBack in Saigon, Thuy waited for him in a small apartment off Rue Catinat just as she had done since they first met nine months ago. Theirs was a love grounded in war and a relationship that crossed cultures and the crazy politics of the time.\nWhen his tour was over, he promised her he would come back. 'Just give me time,' he said. After one final embrace and fighting back tears, he walked out the door.\nHe must have slept as the sun was now peeking over the horizon. It was time to go, however, because the school kids would soon be coming just as they did every morning.\nCoke cans, sandwich wrappers, and strips of foil lay scattered on the floor as evidence of their last visit and reminded him of the need to avoid contact with them because contact inevitably meant trouble.\nReaching into his jacket, he clutched a wrinkled piece of paper buried deep inside the pocket. The paper was old and faded, and the writing was barely visible. But it was all he had to remind him of her - a letter from Bluey saying that Thuy had been killed in a blast outside the Hotel Continental.\nShe had been coming back from the market as she did every morning, walking past the service personnel who gathered on the pavement drinking their morning coffee when the bomb exploded.\nIn an instant, Thuy had become just one more of the many civilian casualties of the conflict - the collateral damage of war they called it.\nToday would have been her birthday, and she was his only thought as he trudged back down the hill with a cigarette drooped in his mouth and a faint tear falling onto his long, grey beard.\nPicture Perfect\nBy Brett Thomas\nOne sixtieth of a second. Remarkable that such a speck of time could generate so much gravity. My hobby was photography, to capture places and people at a precise moment, one sixtieth of it. Some of those moments are forgotten. Others become artefacts. This one is suspended between the two.\nI took the picture down from the shelf. My wife had it framed after I won the annual photography prize in the local newspaper, the Newcastle Herald. Despite the sadly diminishing relevance of so-called legacy media, there was kudos in having one's photo printed on the front page of the edition announcing the winner. It portrayed what's special about our city, said the paper.\nWe liked it when friends visited and initiated discussions about the photo as it beamed from the family room bookshelf.\nWhat to do with it now. My wife said I should leave it there and be done with it. Have the conversations, if and when they emerge. It's a great photo, she said. A beach, a swimmer, a dolphin, a ship in the background. It captures the mysterious beauty of a place that for most Australians conjures images that are gritty, dusty and grey. Of factories, coal trains, and uncomplicated suburbia. This photo said otherwise.\nI knew she was right. Her pragmatic female perspective, unburdened by my befuddled circumspection, should have settled the matter. It is a good photo. People will want to discuss it over dinner, over drinks. Why fear the discussion descending into sullen reflection?\nYou're not responsible, she said. It's worthy of admiration regardless of what happened. And yet, I found the prospect of those conversations confronting. The newspaper report said he saw the photograph and decided to go there for a swim. His wife said he loved to swim, several times a week, and would randomly choose places, based upon not much more than a photo in the newspaper. He was 52. Fit as a fiddle, according to the newspaper. I never understood what that meant. He had so much to live for. Of course. Trite platitudes surround tragic events. It's an odd combination.\nTwo kids. A teacher. A volunteer firefighter. A member of an over 35s football team. A coach. Played in a band back in the day. Well known, it seems.\nThe photograph, in its frame, on the shelf, will trigger these conversations. About the innocence of impulse. About degrees of separation. Melancholy will ripple softly across the room. A shark attack is a drama with its own postcode. The media goes about its job stoking the fires of our fears, and we do the rest. It's always an attack, random and unprovoked. The shark is the villain, and we are the victims. But then again, the ocean is their backyard. We are the invaders. He accepted the danger. It's just bad luck. Opinions will continue to unfurl in muted conflict. Do I need that every time someone visits? The phone rang. It was my brother.\n\"Wasn't that your photo they're talking about. The place where that guy was attacked by the shark yesterday?\" \"Yep.\"\n\"Wow. That must be weird. For you.\"\n\"Not really,\" I lied. \"It's just chance. You know ... fame and misfortune.\" I made that up. I thought it sounded good. I regretted it immediately. \"Whatever. The missus reckons it must be weird.\" \"Yeah. I suppose...\"\n\"Anyway, we'll be over tonight. 6pm OK? We'll bring wine.\" \"Sure. See you then.\"\nFor more of that conversation, no doubt. Maybe not so much if I remove the photo. Put it somewhere else. Somewhere only I can see it. That'd work. I took a tissue, cleaned the frame, and laid the photo on my lap. It wasn't my favourite photo. A bit of a cliché in a way. The stereotypical Novocastrian imagery was picture perfect. I'd been quite happy for people to see it, to comment upon its emblematic rendering. Now that it represented so much more than that, I didn't want anyone to see it. My wife walked past.\n\"What are you going to do with it?\" she asked. She understood my apprehension, but thought it a cop out. She valued honesty, hard discussions, to set the controls for the heart of the matter. I was more guarded. Sensitive. She'd call it precious. \"I think I might put it in the study.\" She knew why. \"It's your photo,\" she grumbled.\nThe phone rang again. It was a reporter from the Newcastle Herald.\n\"I hope you don't mind. I got your number from the file. I thought maybe you have some thoughts on what happened yesterday. The man. The shark attack. It was your photo wasn't it, that led him to the place?\"\n\"I have no thoughts,\" I said. \"It was terrible. Just so unfortunate. I feel for his family.\"\nI'm sure I'd said these things before, but never had they meant less than now. I never knew him. It was just a photo. But I didn't say that. I wasn't honest. The reporter prodded and I kept saying how I was sorry for their loss. The discussion went nowhere. If I said what I really thought, the newspaper wouldn't print it. Or maybe it would. Then I'd be the villain. No doubt my dour responses will be shaped into a melodramatic sentence reinforcing the gloom of it all.\nI carried the photo into the study, sat in my chair, and placed it on the desk, so it couldn't be seen from the doorway. Nobody would ever see it. Except for me. I can have those conversations now, about fate, about choice, with myself.\nMy phone rang. I didn't answer.\nWhisper Back\nBy MJ Meagher\nThe garage door rolled up to reveal oppressive grey clouds, hanging low and matching my melancholic mood. The dog pulled at the lead. My daughter kicked her legs in the pram restlessly. She craned her neck to look up at me, her blonde hair messy, puffer-jacket zipped over her pyjamas.\n\"Park, park,\" she said, rocking back and forth. Thank God for her, I thought, heart aching. I always woke in a low mood. A toddler dragging me from bed had been my rescue, my only remedy.\nMy wife loved and guided me but there was something about the simple, boundless love of a three-year-old that reached deeper into my heart than I thought possible.\n\"Yep. Park,\" I replied. I pushed the pram outside and into the pre-dawn gloom. It rolled quietly over the pavement, bumping at uneven cracks, fading in and out of the puddles of light cast by the streetlamps.\nA winter breeze blew down Brooks Street, stinging my cheeks but smelling fresh. We walked slowly, stopping for the dog to pee, or for my daughter to pick a flower, and slowly made our way towards Centennial Park. I wondered if he was there.\nThe last few months, Lily had been waking early, before five o'clock. We fought it for a while, trying to re-settle her and cling to a normal adult routine. But with my wife working evening shifts and needing the sleep-in, we eventually relented control to our little master. I accepted the early morning shift. Trying to keep the house quiet, I would get up with Lily, cram snacks into the pram, and make for Centennial Park early.\nIt was nice to have the playframes to ourselves. Like me, Lily didn't mind playing in her own company. The dog got a run-around; I'd watch the sun come up and get some time with my daughter before work.\nBut we didn't quite have the park to ourselves. Every morning, a man would be on the opposite side of the park, under one of the older trees. He didn't seem to notice us at all. I'd be on the park bench, one eye on Lily, one on the dog, and would see him pull up. His ute would rumble to a stop, he would get out, garish in a high-vis vest, and stand under the same tree. He seemed lost in his own thoughts. Often, he'd sit on the ground, other times he would lean on the trunk, or absent-mindedly pluck at leaves and woodchips. After a few minutes, he would get back into his ute and drive off to work.\nHe was always a hundred metres away, and we never spoke but he was an oddly comforting presence. Maybe it was my own obsessive personality, but I'd enjoyed the rhythm of seeing him each morning.\nToday, we'd been moving more slowly than usual and I felt an inexplicable pressure to get to the park, an urge to not miss him. I hurried across Dawson Street, rattling Lily's pram over the cracked bitumen and under the fig trees to enter the park.\nLooking across, I could see him under the same old, gnarled tree. He was leaning against the trunk, his forehead against a low-lying branch. He had a bright orange worker's jacket on today, with the hood up. Quite unexpectedly, my dog impulsively pulled away, and I lost hold of the lead.\nHe bolted in a line towards the man. I called out, but he didn't obey. I jogged to catch up, pushing the pram roughly over the grass but couldn't beat the dog to the tree. He sniffed and licked at the man's feet.\n\"Sorry, mate,\" I called out, breathless as I jogged to a stop. \"Had him on the lead but ... sorry ...\" The man didn't look up but scratched the dog between the ears.\n\"All good, mate, all good,\" came the slow, hoarse reply. He had his head downcast, the hood obscuring his face. Only a pointed, stubbled chin was visible. An awkward silence fell on me but the man seemed comfortable with it, patiently patting the dog's flank. After a couple of moments, Lily spoke up from the pram.\n\"Why were you talking to the tree?\" she asked plainly. Embarrassed, I placed a hand on her head. \"Ssshhh darling, leave him alone,\" I implored her. \"Sorry, mate, don't mean to be rude ... she didn't mean ...\"\nThe man looked up, first at Lily with a kind smile, then at me. He was unshaven with short hair, his eyes brown. He was younger than I'd thought; a similar age to me. His chin quivered a little as he looked at us.\n\"Must be going mad, love,\" he said to Lily with a shrug. His laugh was a lie and his eyes swam in grief. But he stretched a smile across his face for me anyway.\n\"Beautiful girl you've got, mate.\"\nHe opened his mouth as if to say something else but then closed it again. He turned, ducking under the branch to walk away, his fingertips lingering on the rough bark briefly before he trudged to his ute. And it seemed to me that the tree was left lonely, gazing up at the sky. Its limbs outstretched in a desperate, unrequited embrace of the heavens. The spindly branches, which in its youth must have been graced by headily-scented flowers and held nests with chicks chirping in the morning sun, were now barren and skeletal under the cold winter sky. Without warning, a sudden gust swept down from the west, buffeting the tree and I. The dog barked madly at first but then cowered behind me, whining as the wind rustled through the branches. It sounded for a moment as if the tree had whispered something back but, looking around, I saw that the man had already gone.\nThe Phone\nBy Dan Shushko\nThe sun hung low, bleeding orange light across the crowded Bar Beach promenade. Luke sat at a small, worn table outside the café. The air was thick with heat, tangled with the crash of waves.\nHe sipped his coffee, its warmth a fleeting escape from the weight of his day. The office had been chaotic, his email chiming with demands. His job carried secrets and confidentiality, the kind that gnawed at him and got under his skin. Just a few minutes before driving back into the grind. But out here on the edge of the ocean it felt like there was just a moment of peace.\nLuke leaned back in his chair and looked towards the horizon. Two dogs walking past started barking at each other. The shrill noise brought him back to where he was. That's when he noticed a phone on the table across from him. He glanced around. No one was looking his way. Luke picked it up. It was a black iPhone, scuffed as if it had been dropped too many times. The case was simple, no marks of ownership. Luke noticed a slip of paper tucked into the case. A scrap of paper which had, handwritten in smudged ink, PIN: 7462. Call: 0432648964. Then four words - Tomato, potato, strawberry, lime.\nLuke looked around again for the owner. He'd hand it in to the café. It wasn't his problem, but something stopped him. Torn between curiosity and caution, his thumb hovered over the screen. What was the harm in dialling the number? He'd be a good Samaritan and find the owner. He entered the pin, dialled the number. It rang twice before a deep voice answered. \"Who's this?\"\nLuke hesitated. \"I found your phone.\" The voice on the other end paused, then spoke. \"We wondered if you'd pick it up. Tell me the words.\" \"What?\" \"The code,\" the voice growled. \"What's the four word code?\" Luke glanced at the paper. \"Tomato, potato, strawberry, lime,\" the words tasting foreign in his mouth.\n\"Good,\" the voice said. \"Now listen carefully. I need you to take the phone to a place by the harbour. I'll text you the address.\"\nLuke's throat tightened. \"What's going on?\" The voice didn't hesitate. \"It doesn't matter. Just do as I say. Take the phone to the address and he doesn't get hurt.\"\n\"Who's he?\" Spat out Luke. \"You've got an hour. Tick-tock.\" Before Luke could respond, the line went dead. The café noises seemed muffled now. Luke stared at the phone. A text arrived with the address. He knew the suburb by the harbour. It was full of half-abandoned warehouses and houses that didn't belong. He could feel the sweat on his back. He shouldn't get involved. He should walk away. Something got the better of him. He kept wondering about 'him'.\nLuke put the phone in his pocket and left the café. The drive wasn't long, but felt endless. Red lights stretched time. Luke blasted the air conditioning, cold against his face, but it didn't help. His thoughts churned. Luke parked a block away, the eerie silence amplifying his unease. The harbour gleamed, the blue water now unsettling instead of calm. He gripped the phone, his hands clammy despite the warmth outside.\nThe warehouse loomed ahead, ugly and decaying. Weeds clawed at the edges. The door hung open and Luke stepped inside. The walls had graffiti layered onto graffiti and were barely still standing. The beams were rusted and the air smelled of dust and metal. Then, he heard footsteps. The figure stepped out of the shadows-tall, imposing. His face was hard, unreadable. The man just stood there, sizing Luke up.\n\"You made it,\" the man said, his voice low. \"Come in.\" Luke held out the phone, \"Here.\" The man did not take it. \"Things have changed,\" the man replied. \"I need you to come further inside.\" Luke's instincts screamed at him to turn and leave. The man stepped aside, gesturing deeper into the dark. \"You're part of this now. Let's finish it.\"\nLuke swallowed hard as he walked further in. Vast shadows swallowing the corners of the warehouse. \"Who is he?\" Luke asked, his voice louder. The man just smiled, cold and sharp. \"All in good time. First, your next move.\" Luke felt the weight settle. He pivoted, ready to leave. Too late. Hands grabbed his arm and a boot slammed into his knee. The trap had closed. Luke staggered, pain detonating down his leg. He tried to twist free, but the grip on his arm was unyielding. The phone slipped from his hand, clattering to the floor, its screen glowing faintly in the dust. The tall man advanced, his shadow cutting across Luke's face. \"You should've walked away,\" he said, voice low, deliberate. \"But you didn't. That makes you useful.\"\nLuke's breath came sharp, ragged. \"Useful for what?\" The man crouched, retrieved the phone, and held it up like a weapon. \"You already know. That job of yours, the one buried in secrets. You thought confidentiality kept you safe. It didn't. It made you visible.\"\nLuke froze. His mind raced. His work wasn't supposed to bleed into the outside world. Yet here it was, staring him down in a decaying warehouse. The man's smile was cold. \"You know who he is. Don't pretend otherwise. You've seen his name in your files. And now you hold the key to whether he lives or dies.\" Luke's stomach dropped. The man leaned in, whispering, \"Tick-tock, Luke. You're already in deeper than you realise.\" The grip on his arm tightened. Another figure stepped from the shadows. Luke's eyes widened. Recognition hit like a blow.\nIt was him.\nThe race that stops the suburbs\nBy Sally Davies\nThe PA system screeches as the announcer raises the microphone to his mouth.\n\"Welcome to the 5th annual Running of the Dachshunds. The flags are flying, the banners are waving and the energy of the crowd is electric, despite it being a scorcher of a day. It's hard to believe we are in Hamilton and not Pamplona.\n\"It's a full grid here today. 10 competitors across a varied field, with an exciting mix of known champions and some unknown contenders. The last three years have seen us crown the same champion, Dennis from Dudley.\n\"He's been a formidable competitor over the years and he's looking particularly sharp today in his new red racing collar, but is this the year of the upset? Could we see Kevin from Kahibah or Lily-belle from Lambton take the crown?\n\"Special mention does need to go to Lily-belle's outfit. I think this is the first time that we have had a competitor in a tutu, but she does look very fetching. Not sure it's the most aerodynamic of choices but time will tell. Baz from Belmont North on the other hand is in what appears to be full skins and he's looking very competitive.\n\"Hang on a minute, I'm just getting an update in my ear... Sorry, they're not skins, they're homemade from his Mum's activewear after Baz chewed a hole in the crotch. Glad to hear that the Lululemons did not die in vain.\n\"Toby from Teralba is standing to one side, a bit aloof. I hear he's had a rigorous training schedule so he will definitely be one to watch. Everyone approaches this with such great spirit. They really are all here for a great time and to celebrate their wonderful dachshunds.\n\"The competitors are taking their places at the blocks, with their owners positioned at the finishing post to guide them home. This race could be anyone's.\"\n********************\nI've been training since February for this. Christmas was tough. No Turkey. No treats. They tried to feed them to me, but I refused. I need to be a lean, mean, dachshund racing machine, and leftover roast potatoes are definitely not recommended for that.\nDennis didn't win three races from eating unnecessary carbohydrates. Although, by the look of his middle this year, I am suspicious that he may have overindulged over the festive season which is an unexpected bonus. His tummy just brushed a blade of grass and this lawn is quite short.\nSome idiot in a tutu just walked past me too. My parents would never do that to me. They tried to dress me up as a hot dog one Halloween and I gnawed my way through the strap and buried the costume under a bush at the house next door. That was before my parents realised my superior status in the neighbourhood. They wouldn't dare try anything like that again.\nMy only concession is that I do have a harness with 'Toby' on it because that way everyone can greet me as I deserve. We're called to take our places, and I head for the starting blocks.\nThe nerves have kicked in. I have two unknowns on either side of me. One rather attractive looking blonde that I wink at, and one that's either dressed like a sausage, or got stuck in a pair of tights from which they couldn't be bothered to cut him loose. Dennis has the middle block. Classic Dennis. Every year he gets a good spot in the draw. I hear his owners bribed a steward to get that. There was talk of a Panettone being left on a doorstep, anonymously. I'm not one to gossip, but I won't tolerate corruption.\nI crouch down low, tuck in my tail, dip my head, and wait. The whistle's blown. This is it. My legs spring into action.\nThey're all moving in perfect harmony. The ground feels light beneath my feet as they kiss across the race track. Dennis is just ahead of me. Annoying little twerp. This year, victory will be mine. I am absolutely flying. Ears flapping in every direction. I run past Dennis. I run past the idiot in the tutu. Now I just have to beat the running pair of tights.\nMy heart is pounding. My breaths are short and fast. I'm not blinking as I don't want to waste energy. I'm closing in but so's the finish line. I hear a sizzle. The scent of sausages fills my nostrils. It's intoxicating.\nThat's all the energy I need. I find a second wind. I feel like my legs have doubled in size.\n\"Toby! Toby! Toby!\" The crowd is yelling. Mum is yelling. She sounds so proud. I can smell victory. This race is mine.\n********************\n\"What a day it has been. Dennis wins his fourth crown in a row. That guy is re-writing the history books.\n\" I understand that a joint appeal of the result has already been lodged by the owners of Toby, Lily-belle, Baz, Kevin, and Eleanor from Elermore Vale. They want a re-run in light of the steward's alleged decision to allow Dennis's owners to hold a fundraiser BBQ at the final turn.\n\"I admit that having half the competitors run off the track to attend a BBQ was not on my bingo card today. It seems that fasting before the race was not the best strategy after all. Well, folks. That's it for another year. I look forward to seeing you all at the 6th Annual Running of the Dachshund when we might finally see a different victor. Or at least a relocation of the BBQ.\"\nCallum, Nat and me\nBy Pam Garfoot\nI'm going to be sick. I heave and everything's purged. My throat burns and my eyes stream. Callum is talking with Nat, in undertones, while I lean over the rank detritus lying in the corner of the building wreck. There's leaves, a couple of old Coke cans, a used condom, and now the sour remains of my last meal. At least I made it away from the place we keep our gear. Our stuff is underneath the overhang of a graffitied upper floor and not too much open to the weather.\nGradually my stomach calms.\nI walk shakily over to the gear and wrap myself up in the old doona. I found it two or three months back at a donation bin and, even though it was a bit grubby, it's not too bad. Callum got his doona in a store. He made me distract the sales lady with questions about pillows while he took his five finger discount. Don't know how she didn't see - doonas are big after all. I didn't like doing that, but Callum can be persuasive.After the store we found a spot at the back of the building and curled up in our doonas. Callum's warm body against mine. I felt like a little kid again inside my special world with someone in the kitchen making us hot chocolates.\nNat's left now, probably walking across to the pub already. Callum comes closer and sits next to me, part-way under the doona. I know what he's going to do and sure enough he's fussing at something and soon throws off the doona. He's breathing faster and pacing round our space.\n'Comin' down to the foreshore?' he throws at me suddenly. I feel like crap but I know Callum wants to go especially now it's getting dark. 'Maybe,' I say. 'Just need to get warm. Give me a bit.'\nCallum kicks at a pile of garbage. He comes over and leans down to look straight into my face, twisting his head sideways and making his eyes narrow. This is the look I get sometimes. I twist away a little, shaking.\n'What's friggin' wrong with you?' he spits.\n********************\nThere's no escaping the early light shafting through the pane-less window, even though it's pretty early. Sunlight reflects off some old tiles. This must have been a kitchen once.\nCallum is still out to it. He stumbled in late last night and crashed out so quick. I pretended I was asleep. I do it sometimes but it doesn't always work.\nMy hip is burning 'cos I've been lying on it too long. A few layers of cardboard and my spare jeans spread out between don't make up for the concrete floor underneath us.\nI sit up slowly, stretching my back and feeling pretty sick. I haven't eaten in a while and that probably doesn't help. I could go down to the IGA for a bread roll.\nMy small purse - the one I keep in my rucksack's concealed pocket - is empty but for some coins. There was a ten and twenty in there yesterday and it will be three days before my next payment. I look at Callum. I wish I could call him out on it. I move to the corner again and retch, quiet as I can.\n********************\nTwo minute noodles soaked in cold water are not good, but I scrape out the mug anyway. Should have left them longer. I find my comb and pull it through my knotty hair, then sling on the stripy scarf, the one some lady left at a bus stop. Maybe I don't look so bad. I slip out of the building, being careful not to be seen. I walk the six blocks to the library. The route takes me past the IGA and the crisis centre. A middle aged woman wearing a blue fleece watches me pass. At the library I can use the toilet, get a proper drink, and sit in a comfortable chair. Sometimes they even have coffee and biscuits set out for book club or something. I know I need to get back. Callum might be awake now and he'll be fuming. When I arrive and go out the back to our space I see that Nat is here again. Callum's still lying back in the doona, his hair all messy. I'm safe for a few minutes but I know Callum gets even worse after he's been talking to Nat.\n********************\nThe view out to the harbour is pretty good. You have to give it that. Callum and I are sitting on a long bench made out of old industrial planks. We'd scraped together enough coins to buy a large fries between us and they're good. A man with two dogs strides past, the breeze blowing through his jacket and ruffling the dogs' fur. He is eating an apple and I'd give anything to eat one.\n'An apple! It looks so good.' I follow the man with my eyes, all along the foreshore path.\n'Well, get one then,' Callum mumbles. 'No money.'\nCallum turns to me. The look is back. 'Use your discount then.'\n'No,' I whisper. 'Don't want it that much.'\n'Stop complaining then. You know what you've got to do.' I don't move for a few minutes then get up to go. Callum's hand is a vice around my wrist. 'Where'ya going then?'\n'Nowhere.' I feel the bruise forming under his grip. Then, just like that, he laughs and lets me go like I was a piece of trash. It's not like there's anything funny to laugh at.\nNo time to go back for my rucksack. I'll head to the crisis centre and the lady in the blue fleece. I've never been sure if I deserve anyone better than Callum. Maybe not. But I know now that there's someone else who really does deserve better.\n- Support is available for those who may be distressed. Phone Lifeline 13 11 14\nThe Threshold\nBy Janice Shaw\nHe inhabits a quiet, twilight world now.\nEven the familiar sound of a beloved voice gently encouraging him to walk only elicits a couple of tail thumps and no more, despite the plea, \"Come on Laddie, you can do it. Just a few steps, and we'll go into the garden to see the birds. You love that.\"\nDespairing, the old man adjusts the crocheted wool blanket that cocoons the little body in grey softness and drops heavily into a nearby armchair. He reaches for the phone, steeling himself for the call, \"It's Bonnie Ladd. ... Yes, soon as you can. ... After surgery it is. See you then.\"\nWhen the eldest son arrives, he finds his father searching through a box of old photographs. \"Remember this? It's our lad, reaching the finish line with nothing but sky underneath him.\"\nHe turns to the dog, illogically hoping a shared memory will change everything, \"You were only a pup then. Young, full of life,\" and then he adds softly, almost to himself, \"We all were.\"\nThe son enquires, \"How is he? Any better?\" But he can see for himself that the change is for the worse. He moves over to pat the immobile figure, stroking his ears in the way he knows the dachshund loves.\n\"I've called the vet.\" They sit, sharing the silence with the laboured breathing from under the rug. Finally, the man folds it back slightly in case the little animal is overheated, musing, \"Your mother finished this only a couple of nights before the accident. I recall saying, 'What's the use, he's a puppy - he'll only chew it to pieces.' He never did, though. He cherished it from the first.\"\n\"I remember Mum crocheting every night in front of the television. She didn't even need to look because she knew the pattern so well. It's one of the few clear memories ...,\" his son replies.\n\"Didn't want a dog, you know. Worried about gnawed chair legs, the piano stool, shoes and slippers. Funny, the things you think are important. But your mum insisted and brought him home only a month before ... and he saved us all, after ....\"\n\"I was being bullied, at primary school. Mum had gone and these boys were .... Anyway, when we saw how Laddie would shoot around the park, nothing would do us but to enter him into a race. I was supposed to be training him, although that was just struggling him into a harness, pointing him in the right direction and letting him go when the woman said, 'Release'.\n\"And didn't he run! I don't know if you understood how much the training and the excitement meant to me, at the time.\"\n\"Oh, I knew. You two boys were lost, and I was no better. I didn't know where to turn, and then you came up with this silly idea of a competition for the pup that turned out not to be so daft at all. It was the first time I saw you smile for so long that I thought you'd forgotten how. And your brother, who was starting to suck the corner of a blanket again and retreat into his own world after he came out of the hospital, he came back to us.\" The door opened with an, \"Is he better?\"\nNeither spoke, until the man gestured toward the figure, \"The vet will be here soon.\"\n\"The vet! No! You can't give up on him. He's a fighter!\"\nThe man tried to explain the inexplicable, \"It's not a question of courage. He's had enough. Laddie trusts me to do what's best. I'm not putting him through any more.\"\n\"You can't - there must be a treatment. Some medication, surgery, something!\"\n\"Why must there be? He's old and frail. 'Here's our old soldier back again,' the vet would say when she saw him, surprised every year that he was still with us. Now it's time to let him go,\" the man naturally fell into the role of making hard decisions, despite his son being an adult many years.\n\"This isn't right!\"\n\"Perhaps. But a pyrrhic victory is not right, either. We must accept that we have many years and he so few.\" The younger son turned to his brother, \"You don't agree with this, do you? Can't we do something? Pay for the vet to take him to hospital?\"\nThe other spoke gently, \"Have money fix it? Do you remember when we wouldn't go to school or even get out of bed after Mum died, and Dad said that if Laddie could run a race with those little legs of his, trying even though he had no hope of winning, then we could do no less? That if he could keep going, so could we? Well, this is a finish line Laddie needs to cross without us.\"\n\"But he's been a part of my life for as long as I remember. He's all we have left of Mum.\"\nJust then, a tentative tap on the door announced the intrusion into their grief.\nHe made one last appeal, \"Dad, please don't do this. Tell her to come back tomorrow or send him to the clinic for treatment.\"\n\"No, son. You know I can't.\"\nThe man, as one does with one's children no matter their age, directed his sons to do what they knew they must, \"Now give our Bonnie Ladd a last goodbye.\"\nThe elder brother held out the photograph, \"Look at how happy he made us seeing him finish this race. He's flying! He may not touch this earth again now, but we'll have him with us always.\" And they patted the little dog snuggled down into the mist-coloured crocheted rug, while the man opened the door and ushered across the threshold the woman who would allow their loved one to fly once more.\nThe Machinist\nBy Julie Robinson\nNow that she was here she was so pleased she came. The ocean stretched before her like a length of peacock taffeta under a clear cornflower-blue sky. The only sounds were the hollow thunk of gentle waves smacking the rock shelf and the breeze-muffled mews of circling seabirds.\nThe July sun was unseasonably bright, its buttery warmth melting down over her head, shoulders and arms. The air was thick and sticky with salt, she could smell it and taste it on her lips. She shivered suddenly, reached for the railing and gripped it tightly.\nThere was another side to the ocean, one that dragged you in and sucked you under like a huge washing machine with an agitator that didn't turn off with the flick of a switch. That belonged somewhere in the past with the gaudy beach umbrella that flew halfway up the beach and the almost-finished princess castle near a red bucket of pretty stones and shells.\nThey had all dropped on the sand like strands of limp seaweed after pulling her out, but she couldn't be consoled. At bedtime, Eileen had sat at her side stroking her hair till she finally broke free from the ocean's grasp. She woke again suddenly to George's bully-boy voice, reminding Eileen again that she was spoiling the child.\nThere was something white bobbing about out there, maybe a bird. Thankfully, there was no one close by save a man with binoculars. She was glad, she liked her own company and pleasing herself now that she could. It was some years since Eileen and George had passed, first one, then the other, with heart and cancer. She still felt their ghosts through the house: Eileen sipping black coffee and browsing the weekly catalogue specials; George flopped in an easy chair hogging the TV; Eileen in her quilted dressing gown and fluffy slippers playing solitaire; George tucking into three lamb chops at the tea table to their one.\nWhat she would have done for an extra chop back then. She had got away from them for a time. That was in her working girl days when Eileen packed her a lunch of cheese sandwiches and an orange or apple.\nSometimes after an occasional Sunday roast she had cold meat scraps but mainly it was cheese. Slinging her work bag over her shoulder and still half asleep, she caught the early bus for a 7am start. She had her own machine like Bev, Pat, Sheila, Rosa and the others. One did sleeves, another buttons, one the two fronts and back. She was the collar and cuff girl. Life then was all about pins and cotton and bobbins and scissors, and the whir of Singers. Quotas had to be met or else, and supervisors watched you like a hawk. They loved their pound of flesh, that factory, and if you got caught nattering you were bawled out by the boss with words that tore you up, spat you out and sent you back to your machine in tears.\nIf it wasn't for the girls, the pay packet and the board money that was relied on, she'd be up and gone. Where she would go and what she would do, she had no idea. She kicked off her heels under the lunchroom table, they all did. Then over a cuppa forgot about needles and thread, and gossiped away time.\n\"Come on Joy,\" they teased, \"tell us about that boy Bev saw you with at the pictures the other night.\"\n\"Must have been someone else,\" she grinned, \"haven't seen a film in a while.\"\n\"That's what you tell us,\" ribbed Sheila.\n\"We want all the juicy bits,\" added Pat, \"tell us everything, absolutely everything.\"\n\"Oh, you girls,\" she giggled, \"all you think about is boys and more boys.\"\n\"Did you let him taste your new peppermint pink lipstick?\"\nA head poking in at the door and a \"back to work, girls\" growl was enough to shush them and save her the embarrassment of the truth. They were happy enough days but things took a turn when Sheila got the sack. She had gone to her gran's funeral and took two more days because of her monthlies. She had crept back to her bench as white as a sheet, tears streaming. They didn't have to be told. And there was George now, blowing his stack at breakfast. A headline in the newspaper, a photograph and his face screwed with rage. \"What's this then Joy girl, and you'd better have a good answer?\" he bellowed, thumping the table. He stormed to the sink and shoved the paper in her face.\n\"Is this you, or is it not you?\" She stared at a picture of the meeting in town with the new union president. She was there all right, plain as day in the crowd. George had ranted on and on about the perils of Communism and how next she'd be on a plane to Moscow to celebrate May Day. Too right they were there and it was for Sheila and the others.\nThings were never right at home after that. Da got angrier and Ma cried too much. Da got chest pains and Ma got thin. Skin and bone thin. Fear gripped her and her knuckles turned white. The ocean was drawing her, pulling her in and pushing her down into its murky depths. She struggled to breathe. Da was nowhere but Ma was calling with outstretched arms. She couldn't clasp Ma's hand. She tried and tried.\nA nearby voice spoke softly, \"Can you see them out there? Not as far out as the ship. Someone is swimming near dolphins.\"\nThen, \"Sorry, are you okay?\"\nShe jumped at the stranger's voice. He passed Joy his binoculars. She caught a dolphin breaching and it was amazing.\nThe summer we turned thirteen\nBy Stephanie Ayres\nIt was the last week of the school year, and forecast for 35 degrees, so Josh and I had decided to cut school for the beach. It's not like we'd be learning anything, they'd probably be showing movies all day, and there's only so many times you can watch Avatar.\nWe'd packed our towels, boogie boards and a change of clothes; and made sure we had enough money to stuff ourselves stupid at the kiosk. I felt a bit sorry for the others sitting through lessons, but not too sorry. As we ran on the bus, the driver gave us a knowing look. It was going to be a scorcher, and the beach was the place to be. Sun, surf, sand, and freedom from Mr Simpson's pathetic lectures about \"behaviour befitting the school\". The more observant among us knew he and Miss Knight disappeared to the stationary cupboard during sports afternoons. How hypocritical can you be?\n\"Hey Josh,\" I asked, \"What shade of lipstick do you reckon Homer will be wearing today?\"\nJosh roared with laughter. \"I don't know, but it'll be the same shade as Knight in Shining Revlon.\"\nWe cackled so loud that some old Karen at the front gave us dirty looks. I gave her the bird and laughed some more. Josh had a healthy distrust of authority. He hid a bug in the staffroom when we were in primary school, and we heard first-hand how adults in power say stuff in private that they'd never say in public. Until then, it had never occurred to me. But then I'm not smart like Josh. A lot of people don't realise just how smart he is - maybe because he never makes a big deal out of it; never raises his hand in class, half the time doesn't even look like he's paying attention. Maybe it's because he hangs around with me. They called us dumb and dumber for a while, then they realised it was only half true. The waves were pumping as we made our way down the sand. There were guys on boards bobbing out the back and someone was erecting a volleyball net further down the beach.\n\"My mum reckons she was here the day that big ship washed ashore,\" I said.\n\"Grandma reckons there's wrecks all down Stockton breakwall.\"\nWe spent the whole day riding the waves, lying on the sand and stuffing ourselves with hot chips. As the morning stretched into afternoon, the wind started to pick up, and grey clouds built up on the horizon. As the sun dipped behind them, we walked up to the ocean baths and ran along the perimeter.\n\"Do you reckon it could turn into another Pasha storm?\"\n\"That was in June. We might get hail though,\" he said.\nOf course it was. Mum had told me that. I felt a bit stupid then. Josh went quiet then and looked out to the horizon. He looked like he was watching the storm clouds but there were other storm clouds moving in behind his eyes. I knew he spent the second half of the holidays at his dad's. He hated his dad - he was a nasty piece of work. I once asked him why he didn't just bug his dad's house like he bugged the staffroom, but Josh feared what his dad would do because he'd know it was him.\nIt was then I remembered the surprise in my bag. That would cheer him up.\n\"Hey, look at this!\" Josh would think it was clever. He'd see that I noticed things too. I pulled out a phone from my bag. It was pink and covered in butterflies.\n\"What the hell is that?\" He asked.\n\"It's Miss Knight's phone. I pinched it off her desk yesterday when she wasn't looking. I bet I can crack her passcode.\"\n\"Oh bullshit. If you could crack it, you would have done it by now.\"\nHe had a point, but I hadn't tried until now. I thought I would let Josh share in the thrill. I tried a few combinations, trying to mimic the movement of her finger on the screen. Teachers really shouldn't use their phones in class. After a few goes it unlocked.\n\"What the hell, man? You did it!\"\nI tried to get into her Facebook, but she'd logged out. I tried YouTube and a video of dashcam clips came up.\n\"Hey look, this just uploaded.\"\nThe first clip was a granny who mistook the accelerator for the brake, but the second showed a guy full on road raging: yelling, screaming and attacking another car with a baseball bat. The licence plate was not visible, but there was no mistaking the face.\n\"Josh, is that your...\" Josh nodded dumbfounded. It was then that I truly understood.\nI told him he should tell the police, but he was adamant his father would know. I knew then what I would have to do. I made a screenshot and logged onto a few websites, attaching the photo, or linking the video, and adding details about what the vision showed; and what it didn't. When it was done, I removed the evidence.\n\"Don't worry. I'll fix it. He'll never know. This is going to be a great Christmas.\" But Josh was scared. He didn't trust authority.\n********************\nJosh didn't have to go to his dad's those holidays, or any other holidays. They never did find out who dobbed him into the cops, because I'd logged in anonymously and removed the evidence. I wiped all my prints off Miss Knight's phone and slid it under the door of the stationary cupboard on Thursday morning. I'd tucked a stick of Estee Lauder under the clasp, to say thank you, and so she'd know she could do better.\nHome-less\nBy Linda Mueller\nYour home is brimming with love. Curtains flutter in and out; children's laughter escapes through the windows; the mum and dad sit on the verandah toasting the ocean view. Except it's not your home anymore, not since you shut the front door for the final time. The new owners know nothing of your pain, your desperate attempts to feed the mortgage beast, your pleading with the bank for one more month's reprieve.\nIt doesn't matter that you painted every intricate cornice, that you graced each wall with a memory, that you breathed love into every surface. It doesn't matter that it's there where you endured his bile and his blows, that man who shared your bed until he slid into someone else's. It doesn't matter that sometimes his blows punctured the walls or that you patched them up. It doesn't matter that repairs to your body and mind were never as easy. You stop stalking your old home and search for a new one but replacement homes are hard to come by. The lines are long at rental properties, filled with competition - 18-year-old uni students desperate to find the perfect share house, blokes in their 30s finally cast out of the family home, divorced women starting fresh - all with proof that they are the perfect tenant. You are overwhelmed with their steely commitment, their preparation, their \"you must pick me and only me\" stance.\nYou do not expect the Hunger Games. It frightens you so you back away, clutching your handbag, dragging your suitcase which contains all that you have left - some clothing, a few photos, a lonely can of deodorant and your favourite lipstick. You won't have a home but at least you'll smell sweet and you can give everyone a bright pink smile, if anyone bothers to look. Did you really think you could compete? Someone is sure to find out that you've got little chance of paying the rent beyond a couple of weeks, that you're waiting for Centrelink to find some compassion and a few more dollars in their vault for you, that you're still hoping to find that non-existent job that exists only for you.\nYou open your purse and count the dollars and cents of your last pay. You and your boss \"agreed\" it was best you move on, that you need time to \"sort yourself out\", that you will be \"welcome back when the time is right\". There's not enough energy in you to fight the words that spill from her mouth, let alone the unspoken words or the unknown quantity of time. You skulk back to your car, a battered bomb that barely makes it to 60, and throw your suitcase back into the boot. There's only so many spare beds at those women's shelters. So the bomb has become your home and you've learnt that sleeping in the foetal position on the back seat is almost comforting. If you park at the beach, it's a room with a view. Such versatility. You laugh at your attempt at a positive spin.\nYour problem is you don't know how long it will be before you get told to move on. Already there's been suspicious looks from surfies and swimmers who arrive at dawn to tackle the waves. Not to mention the cars that arrive at night with occupants who move to the back seat before the engine cools. They look over at you before they duck their heads down. You find it hard to believe they would choose to fool around in a car when surely there's a choice of a bed somewhere, with clean sheets and soft pillows.\nHow long will it be before it becomes unsafe to sleep in your car? Before someone realises all you own is in this car. Locks and windows won't keep someone out if they really want to get in. You know you need to find somewhere less visible but obscure locations also mean danger. You could be attacked, robbed, left in a dark spot until daylight reveals your broken body. Bleak but realistic. Where's that positive spin now?\nWhat you need is fresh air and a different view, to stretch your legs, to pretend you're just like any other walker at the beach, minus the designer joggers. Golden sand and the blue horizon invite you closer. Instead, you head up the hill, skirting the cliff, steering away from people.\nIt's easy to forget there's always another view if you look hard enough. Down the other side, there's a building, forlorn and neglected. Its cement structure is still intact but you notice that the windows are just openings. No fancy curtains, no glass. You could climb in but the door is missing so you walk in as if the place belongs to you. Others would say it's just an empty eyesore covered in graffiti but you see so much more. The walls are painted, not with any one colour but with words and drawings. There's abstract squiggles, bunched up numbers, letters, splashes, pops, cloud-like strokes. It's the art of life, messy but memorable.\nYou stand in the middle, spinning around to look from every angle, scanning the walls in case you might miss a hidden glimpse of someone else's world. The floor is filthy but you sit on it anyway and close your eyes. The colours seep through and swirl behind your eyelids. Your breath slows and all you can hear is the pulse of the ocean.\nYou open your eyes, look out to the clean sky and down to the dirty floor. This was someone's home. You feel its past, sense its future but for now it's the home of the lost, the lonely, the forgotten. You spy a pink crayon, crawl to the wall and draw a tiny smile. You like this place. It feels like home.\n- Support is available for those who may be distressed. Phone Lifeline 13 11 14\nBroken Washing Machines\nBy KJ Mair\nYou're seventeen when your roles reverse.\nIt's unexpected. Comes out of nowhere like an angry slap, and months later you're still reeling. You're still waiting for the sting to dry from your eyes.\nOne day your mother is your mum. She hung out your clothes, she nagged you to clean up your room, and she nudged you in encouragement. She made sure you were fed and happy. She hugged you, praised you and loved you. She will always love you. That's the one thing you don't doubt.\nBut the next day, she changed. She went away and left behind someone you don't know. A stranger with your mum's face. She still has her kind hands and fond memories, but everything is twisted around now.\nFunny enough it's her birthday when it happens. A celebration of life and growth of another year is instead a lesson in how it can all be lost far too easily. You suggest her favourite restaurant for brunch and are too busy looking at the specials to notice anything amiss. A waitress wanders over. \"What will you have, Hun?\" Silence.\n\"Did you want to start with a coffee?\"\nYou flip to the hot drinks section. Mocha? Or something new? What would a turmeric latte taste like?\n\"Hun? Are you okay?\" You finally look up from the menu. Your mum sits there, frozen. Her mouth is open, but no words escape. Her fingers are trembling. And her eyes share the same look of a pet rabbit you had as a kid when you squeezed it too tight.\n\"Mum? Mum, what's wrong?\"\nShe doesn't answer. It looks like she can't. Like it's impossible. Oh god, is she having a stroke? A heart attack? \"Mummy?\"\nThe waitress looks at you and a trickle of relief falls through. An adult will know what to do, right? They will make it all better.\n\"I'm going to call for an ambulance. You stay with your mum. I'm sure she'll be fine,\" the waitress says.\nShe isn't. The doctors call it deep depression with psychosis. They talk in a gentle way that grates. Worst of all, they talk to you like she isn't even there. Like she's not aware. That she's not even a person anymore.\nThe signs were there (the stress, the lack of sleep, leaving more and more on her plate) - you just weren't looking hard enough. Reliability had a way of lulling you into a false sense of security and then twisting the knife as it stormed out the door.\nYou try to reassure her, hug her, tell her that you love her - but nothing gets through. It just starts the cycle of self-flagellation again and again. It hurts to know that there are places where love can't reach.\nAnd you don't want to admit it, but she doesn't smell like your mum anymore.\nLife goes on but you've learnt how to hit pause on certain parts of it. There are still graduations to attend, and jobs to apply for, but hospital visits take time and carving out stretches becomes par for the course. (You feel guilty that you can take time without her, that you can function when the most important person in your life can't.) She tries to smile at you sometimes. It's weak but it's there. She winks at you before she's carted off for her treatments and it gives you hope. You can still get her back. But it's not easy.\nYou're selfish because you think this is not my life. Not my life, as you stay up to three in the morning calming her down, so she takes her medicine. Not my life, as you buy adult diapers. Not my life, as she screams at you, \"Don't use the washing machine. It's broken! Don't you know that everything's broken?\"\nOne early morning the woman who used to be your mother drags you out of bed to the nearby park. It's wet and you cross your arms for warmth and to cover up the fact that you weren't given time to put on a bra.\nShe pulls you onto a bench. A tree casts shadow on you both. It's lost all its leaves to winter, each branch nearly skeletal in its bareness. The branches become brittle twigs as they reach up and up for nothing. You eye the woman beside you - then squeeze them tight as you forcibly break the comparison in your head. You shiver uncomfortably but this stranger takes no notice. Her eyes are too wide, and she jams her hands into her armpits. She's clutching herself so hard, you think she's trying to compress herself into disappearing altogether.\n\"This is where we're going to live now.\"\nYou are sleep-fogged and don't understand. \"What?\" \"Here.\" She gestures up. \"In the park, this is where we're going to live. We're going to be kicked out.\"\nYou know nothing you say can change her mind right now, so you decide to show her instead. \"C'mon.\" She resists but you keep tugging. She follows. It takes a long time, but you don't let go. You take her to the jetty, and search until you find them. \"There, do you see?\" The corner of her mouth crinkles. It's a school of fish. Big ones, small ones and medium-sized ones. Dozens and dozens of them swarming together, liquid quick.\n\"They're just like us, okay. They're sticking together, Mum. And what else do they do?\"\nThe sun rises and warms your backs. She looks at you (really looks at you) and remembers your childhood favourite. The film you watched over and over. \"They keep on swimming,\" your mum says. She reaches out and squeezes your hand in a sure grip. It's been a while since she tried to reassure you. With childlike enthusiasm, you pull her into a hug. This time, the sting in your eyes isn't painful, but joyous.\nJ3RKO\nBy Ned Stephenson\nThe ghost of your burner's still here, bro. Top right corner at Queens Wharf, under a Wilko cap. Wilko will never be more than a toy; thinking he can cap your tag with the courage of a street feral marking a power pole when the big dog's out of sight. Word is Wilko got rolled the other day spraying a nightclub door. Thought you'd like to hear that. Tash reckons he was being paid to do it by another club owner.\nWhoever said life in Newcastle was hard? Life's sweet here so long as you've got coin. I was thinking about Station Street the other day. You remember when we bombed those walls? Nobody could walk to the interchange without tripping over your ego. We crushed every surface in reach and ran out of cans before the end. Always gave respect. Never capped a good piece already there.\nAnd all those trains. Walls of grey stretching further than we could be bothered walking. On the train day you became a legend. But there's one night that won't let go. The bridge tunnel behind the servo. Full moon, echoey as hell, and that copper stink rising off the Hunter River from the west. You were working a chrome and black outline, big wildstyle, and the hiss of your can was the only thing breaking the silence. I remember the way you shook the tin, little tap-tap-tap, like a ritual. You said the wall had to earn it.\nI was new and shaking a bit from the cold or the nerves. Sirens drifted in from Hamilton, faint and distant. Smirking like the god who stole fire, you said to me, 'Don't paint scared. Paint loud.'\nAnd then you did. Big colour burst across busted brick, heart pounding, stinking of aerosol and adrenaline. Somewhere behind us, a train screamed past. You didn't even flinch. You never said it, but I think you were scared that night. Not of getting caught but of being forgotten.\nOr that time the cops caught us drinking in the park. The others stayed frozen on the ground, while the dogs shot past, too busy chasing us. Fox chases the rabbits and ignores the sitting does.\nWe should never have stopped running. Sometimes I think we didn't. I can still feel that iron grip on my pants and the smack to the back of the knees. You and me staring at each other, expecting any minute they'd whale into us with their sticks. St@xxx told us it's a golden rule that you don't run. But you and me, we're maze runners.\nAnd now St@xxx has gone too. Said her mum's been crook, and her brother's working out west. She's back in Raymo. Before she left, she gave me a stick of skunk and kissed me with second-hand McDonalds. At least I got to see her go, unlike you.\nHaven't seen your sister in months. She used to ride past here on her way to TAFE, always with that same chipped helmet and a busted pink milk crate on the back. I keep half-thinking I'll see her pedal past, head down, pretending not to know me.\nHere's the Stockton Ferry cutting slow across the harbour like always. It smells like salt and rust and wet rope. Seagulls scream at each other like they've got something worth fighting over. A couple of kids are skating down near the benches; wheels clack over the gaps in the old timber boards. Across there's someone tagging the bin with a white-out pen, slow and scratchy. It's not yours, but it's something.\nI ran my fingers over your tag earlier. The wall's rough as always, salt-stung and blistered. Your letters are fading, but they're still loud. Chrome cracking in the corners, ghosting behind the black line like a halo.\nI stood there longer than I meant to. Hand on brick, feeling dumb, like I was waiting for you to say something.\nYou should've been here.\nI keep thinking if I stay in the right spot, or if I tag something loud enough, you'll come back. Like maybe I never heard the real story. Like maybe you're still out there somewhere, laughing behind a mask and waiting to see who's loyal. But I know better.\nThat wall's cold, and you're gone.\nDo you remember my first full burner? I was shaking like hell. You stood behind me, steadying my hand while I filled the red. Said my lines were garbage but my colours had heart. You fixed the outline without even asking. I pretended to be pissed off but I was stoked. That wall stayed up for weeks. I went past it every day like it was a mirror.\nThings are different now. They paint murals with council funding and QR codes in the corner. The same walls, but with smiling faces and corporate logos and safety ladders. Even the old writers are selling books, giving talks at libraries. Tash says it's progress. Maybe it is. Maybe we won. Doesn't feel like it. You'd've called it wall cosplay.\nWherever you've gone, bro, I wanted you to know it's not the same without you.\nWe're at the reserve tonight, in memory of J3RKO the great. There'll be a few of us. The real ones, the old heads, and maybe a couple of new kids who've only seen your tag on stickers. No cans, just beats. No speeches. No flyers. Lowkey, just the way you would've wanted it. Tash will bring a speaker and that jungle mix you used to love. St@xxx messaged. Says she wishes she was here. Even Wilko messaged, weirdly. Said he 'respects the scene'. Don't worry, I left him on read.\nI'll take a silver can. Might not even use it. Just want to hear it rattle. That sound you loved. Like something trapped in the can, clawing to get out.\nRepurposed\nBy Vesna McMaster\n'Cobalt.' Reg squints at the water. 'That's the word. Cobalt blue.'\n'Diamonds,' Julie says. 'Look at that sparkle.'\n'Blinding.' Reg pushes his sunnies up his nose. 'Can't complain though. Nice to be on the beach.' He nods towards the tanker on the horizon. 'There's our coal, off to China. Not our emissions if it's not happening here.'\n'Like chocolate doesn't have any calories unless someone sees you eating it.' Julie glances back at the ship. 'Look! Dolphins!'\nReg grunts in delight, then he rubs his thigh. 'Damn leg's throbbing again. What's the matter with it?'\nJulie passes him a strawberry and moves closer under the parasol. 'It's giving you a lot of grief. Ought to get it checked out.'\n'It's busy at work. The biggest smelter in Australia doesn't run itself, you know.'\n'It can spare you for an afternoon. Make an appointment with the doc.'\n***\nThe maple in the garden yellows from the bottom up. The temperature drops. Julie wipes the endless black dust. She wipes as if it will wipe away the tumour eating away at Reg's thigh bone. Eventually she stops. 'Ready?'\nReg squares his shoulders. 'Ready. Bugger this, I'm going to beat it by Christmas.'\nThey set off for the hospital. In Julie's imagination, the cancer anthropomorphises, acquiring deliberate agency. It disintegrates tissue boundaries and steals blood supply with unfathomable rapacity.\nDespite the treatment - or perhaps because of it - Reg gets involved in climate demonstrations. He makes a point of showing up in his wheelchair. A goal, a cause, increases chances of survival. Julie hosts a barbecue for the protestors, and they throng in the back garden. Reg sits in state in his wheelchair, smiling and sipping a fake beer. A neat little man with a white beard sits down next to him. 'You just moved in next door, didn't you?' Reg says.\n'That's right.' The neat man extends a hand. 'Bob.' 'Reg.'\n'I know.' He smiles. 'You're an unlikely protestor, aren't you?'\nReg chortles. 'That's the point.'\n'What if the energy transition doesn't work? Where's your job then?'\n'Bah, who knows if I'll be around in two months' time, bugger the job, this is for the future.' He taps his drink against Bob's.\nBob regards him owlishly. 'What did today's action cost them, then?'\n'They're reckoning half a million dollars. That's going to get people thinking!'\nBob snorts delicately. 'Eh, you're going about sabotage the wrong way. I used to work in the sector.\nCould do that much in an afternoon by simply prioritising a suboptimal pathway.' He takes a sip of orange. 'Or suggest a high-level consultation. A one-day meeting with some top executives.' He counts imaginary tallies off on his fingers. 'Thirty people in a room can burn half a million dollars deciding whether or not to spend any.'\nJulie turns sausages over glowing coals.\n'You make it sound as if we're out for destruction. All we're asking for is redirection.'\n'Ah, that's all very well, but that's not what happens,' blinks Bob. 'It's so easy. When failure is success, sabotage is easy, isn't it?'\nReg squints at him. 'Like?'\n'Oh, delay maintenance approvals. Misallocate transition funds. Commission studies that expire unused. An aggressive form of laissez-faire. It harvests profits and generates only despair.'\n'You're quite the optimist,' Reg laughs.\nBob smiles. 'Realist.'\nThey discover they both have time to kill and a love of backgammon. Over months, they sit in the back yard for as long as the weather permits, cultivating a companionable silence. The carcinoma chews into Reg's shinbone. It strips its maintenance budgets, and subverts his immune system through regulatory capture. His very blood forgets its function and abandons its institutional memory in the executive churn of metastasising bone. Then, as the winter wanes, so does the cancer. The wattle flowers witness Reg one leg lighter, but sitting straighter.\n'I'm going to get a super-techno prosthesis,' he tells Bob. 'Osseointegration. They've stuck a titanium post in, and now my bones are going to sort of grow around it.'\nBob winces at the description.\n'He's going to be Wolverine,' Julie says, handing them tea.\nReg's leg grows around the titanium implant, and his severed nerve endings accept that they're connected to different muscle. Only sometimes does it seem as if he still has a leg that's aching. As the weather warms again, he suggests he joins Julie on a hike.\n'That'll show the damn cancer who's boss.'\n'Not yet, Reg,' Julie says. 'You've got to give it time. Remember? Too much too soon and it's all for nothing.'\n'But I'm Wolverine.'\n'It doesn't quite work like that. Got to be ready to take the load.'\nAcross the valley, at a shuttered mine, the open cut void has been repurposed into a dam. The water reflects cobalt and diamonds back at the sky, defiant. Deep underground, the old coal seam also fills with water, as a hydro-storage facility grows around the skeletal remains of the old system. The water starts to pump.\nFractal Fairy Tale\nBy Garry Jennings\nThe Jacaranda arched majestically over the backyard of his daughter's home in Adamstown. Its intricate branch patterns intrigued him and he was chuffed to recall being taught about the scientific term fractals, a lifetime ago in basic HSC Biology.\nHe looked forward to the regular visits to his daughter and granddaughter. Once a fortnight he boarded the Port Stephens bus for Newcastle. A testing walk up the Fernleigh Track would leave him a little wheezy, but he forgot about that as he greeted his four-year-old granddaughter, Violet. Her parents were into this new working from home regime, so he and Violet were playmates for a day and a bit.\n'Pa!' she squealed, 'Are you sleeping over tonight?' Her masses of curls bounced as she ran towards him.\n'Yes, Blossom, I sure am!'\nThe day started with a game of wall where he and Violet raced each other between the side fences in the backyard. As her young legs skittered across the lawn, advancing arthritis and a winter cough meant that he no longer had to let her win these duels. They would sit munching watermelon to cool off and Violet always wanted to hear the Fractal Fairy story.\nHe didn't get bogged down in the science as she was only at pre-school so they were just fwactals to her. She stared up at him as the story began.\nYou see this big tree? That's where the Fairy lives in the wintertime. A little girl named Violet, just like you, is playing in the backyard and a Fairy calls out to her. Violet! Hey Violet! Come over here and stand up on the fence. I'll help you climb the tree.\nViolet isn't sure about this because her Mum has told her not to leave the yard.\nViolet starts to climb the tree with the Fairy and as they reach each branch, elves and pixies call out to her: \"Hi Violet! Keep climbing!\" When she reaches the top of the tree she steps onto a beautiful cloud as soft as cotton wool. There are teddy bears, rabbits and pandas sitting around on blankets, eating sandwiches, watermelon and cake. She sits down with them and joins in the picnic.\nViolet is so happy to meet these new friends and forgets about the time. From down in the yard, her Mother is calling her. The Fairy takes her hand. Come on, Violet, we have to get you back.\nThey climb down the tree past all the forest creatures. The Fairy helps her onto the grass and whispers, \"Remember Violet, don't tell your Mum about us!\"\nHer mother is waiting at the back door. \"All right Miss Violet, were have you been, my girl?\" Violet's head is so full of wonder and excitement that she starts to babble and tells her Mum all about the Fairy, the teddies, the forest people and the picnic. Her Mum looks at her with such love.\n\"Well, you ARE full of stories, aren't you? Just like your Pa.\"\nBiting into a wedge of watermelon as she digested the tale, Violet looked up at him, 'But where does the Fairy sleep, Pa?'\n'She hides in special spots in the branches. They're enchanted branches called fractals and she is the Fractal Fairy! You have to look carefully to find her. She keeps the tree tidy and sometimes hides up in the clouds. When it's summer time, she waves her magic wand so the flowers and leaves can grow back. And do you know what colour the flowers are?'\n'No.'\n'They're violet! The flowers have your name. That's why the Fairy made friends with Violet and invited her into the enchanted tree.'\nHe would tell the story again, several times, before they moved to collecting fallen twigs from the jacaranda to make a magic campfire. The next day, Violet would plead with him to hear the story again. Then it was time for him to head back to the Bay.\nThe week after this visit. he saw a cardio-thoracic surgeon for an assessment of his breathing. His GP was worried about that wheeze and his persistent cough. The image of his lungs on the screen in the surgeon's rooms resembled that fractal wonderland of Jacaranda branches in Violet's backyard. The surgeon tapped the screen.\n'You see this slightly foggy mass around the tips of the capillaries?' He couldn't make out a thing but the surgeon continued. 'You've got mild viral pneumonia. I can see you're in reasonable nick for a 65 year-old but you're running out of puff and need to head this off. Rest. Gentle exercise only.'\nThe news floored him. He wasn't ready to stop playing wall with Violet. The Newcastle visits with her were one of the things that kept him going.\nAs the winter chill lost its grip during his gentle walks around the streets near his home, he noticed the jacarandas were purpling up with an embryonic bloom. Over the next two visits to see Violet, his wheezing and cough started to fade. The walk up the track to his daughter's place was now a doddle. He even beat her occasionally in a game of wall.\nThe fractal pattern in Violet's Jacaranda now sported a fresh hue of purplish blue. Violet was still keen to hear her favourite story.\n'Pa, is the Fwactal Fairy colouring in the branches now?'\nHe inhaled and exhaled deeply with no hint of a cough or a wheeze. 'She's doing a beautiful job, isn't she, Violet?'\n21.12.25\nBy Michelle Kelly\nIt was strange to be outside on Kooragang Island at night. Was this the first time? Had I ever been outside on Kooragang Island before, day or night? I was standing next to my car, the blinker blinking, my hand resting lightly on the roof.\nIt was temperate now, the scorch of the day a pale dry undernote that might only register if you'd lived through it, the melting and the madness. Who could not know, those of us who lived here? Maybe only the locals who'd left this weekend, flying out to the Gold Coast or Cairns or Denpasar. Other Novocastrians were doomed to know viscerally; by the viscera that had slowly dried out and crumbled inside our bodies as the sun crawled from one horizon to the other.\nEarlier that day while the air burned itself dry I'd seen a woman, not old, carefully turn left and drive onto a thoroughfare that resembled a road but was a train line.\nIn the afternoon I had sat in my car with the air conditioning running, while the infant slept in her booster seat in the back.\nWhere was the infant now? I couldn't quite remember. My hand rested lightly on the car roof, the blinker blinking, the lights all around blinking, the climate emergency lightly warming my fingers.\nThe rear lights of the crashed car ahead were blinking, blinking, blinking, and pointing at the lowest of low angles, the front left wheel having breached the fence and just nudged off the edge of the asphalt. So much of the emergency baked into this asphalt.\nThe cradle of the world were the words which came to me.\nI shut my eyes and everything that was immediately around me entered my body and the exhilaration I felt was indescribable.\nThe cradle of the world. The dark ships waited silently. The belly of it all.\nThe mangroves silent too, but not waiting.\nI put my hand on top of the foetus and turned toward the other car. It was ten metres ahead and its lights were blinking.\nThat morning I had been on the ferry, and I could not ride the ferry without thinking of Richard Scarry's Busytown, staple metropolis of those children's books where animals led full, orderly lives.\nI think I had originally heard the Scarry reference in relation to the Manly ferry, but the correspondence seemed truer here in Newcastle. Things are just tighter here. A water commute seems to suggest that life is more than ordinary, but not necessarily extraordinary. It seems simple - a water commute might promise a beautiful life.\nAfter the ferry I'd taken the tram and the bus and the infant, foetus and I arrived at Waratah Village. There were many men without shirts. There was discarded food, gourmet preserves if it hadn't been smeared on the footpath. In the shopping centre car park there were several people in vehicles on phones, air conditioning on. I would do this myself later, but not yet.\nI went to Kmart and bought a Christmas t-shirt for the infant for a daycare event.\nI went to Gloria Jeans and bought a Very Vanilla Latte to take away. I bought sushi for lunch, with wasabi and soy sauce in small plastic fish. More shirtless men. Children wailing. Does tinsel melt?\nAt Hot Bargain I didn't spend much but bought many things. The infant cried, I fed it the lunch I packed. I couldn't believe it wanted a party pie but it did, and I bought that too. The foetus was sluggish amidst the drying, creasing viscera. But I felt it shift itself irregularly, and I knew that all was well enough. The small of my back was damp.\nI went back into Kmart and bought candles and bath salts. Last of all, I collected our car from mycar. I had saved for months for this service. During the day the infant would sleep nowhere except the car and yesterday had been endless. With huge relief I bundled us all into the vehicle and drove, drove, drove - gliding through a prayer offered to silence and the peace of a sleeping child. We drove towards home and past it, past golf courses, past the site of the future missile manufacturing facility, past the retirement village, past the silent trees. We looped back and stopped driving.\nThe silent trees gave us shelter, and sleep is sacred thing. The engine was left to run so that none of us died. That had been mid afternoon, I think, and now we were deep into the night. We had been driving, we had been waiting, we had done other things.\nI started toward the other car. When my hand lifted from the roof it felt as if my car was a lifeboat which drifted away instantly, borne away on tides and waters which exponentially grew the distance to safety by some unforgiving mathematics. Everything was lost from the microsecond before I released my mooring.\nThere were three in the other car, a mother and her children. They did not move but they were not dead. Their hands were full of phones but after some time they turned their necks and put their eyes on me.\n\"We are lost,\" said the mother of the car.\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\"Can you help?\" said the mother.\n\"I can help,\" I said, with a pained smile.\n\"What a day it has been,\" said the mother.\n\"A killing day,\" I said.\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"yes.\"\n\"But this is where we find ourselves,\" I said. \"Yes,\" she said, \"yes.\"\n\"I am lost too,\" I said.\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"Yes.\"\nIn Loving Memory of Hope\nBy Jacob Moore\nCould a child fit in a fugitive's life? Leanna's fingers trembled as she pried open the velvet box, diamonds catching the chandelier's glow in the old lady's mansion. She'd always thought rich folks like Mrs. Truman would be cold and ruthless, deserving of theft. Especially after Chase uncovered it was Truman who evicted Leanna's cold mother, sparking his plan.\nUpon knocking, instead of rebuke or suspicion, Mrs. Truman welcomed them both warmly, hiring them on the spot. Few questions, no references.\n\"You have a glow about you. I was about your age when I had a daughter,\" she'd said yesterday, eyes crinkling with a smile. Leanna's chest tightened, lowering the chair.\nAt 20 weeks pregnant, she considered herself well hidden beneath the sweater.\n\"Chase doesn't know,\" Leanna whispered, eyes to the floor, bracing for a storm.\nMrs. Truman's hands paused, then offered a warm and steady touch.\n\"Your secret's safe with me.\"\nHer eyes shone with quiet love, a mum without judgment.\nChase had said the lady's trust was weak. Maybe it just made her lonely. He moved swiftly beside Leanna, slipping rings and emeralds from a display case into a black bag, his face tense.\n\"Focus. One job with me, then I'll take you anywhere. New life, new start.\"\nHis hazel eyes were sharp now, different to their softness six months ago; spinning dreams of a future they could share. She'd believed in his warmth then. A flutter stirred in her belly.\nChase never mentioned kids in his plan. She gripped the next cabinet's handle. The drawer pulled humbly compared to others. One heart locket on a velvet cloth. Simple silver, with a sentence etching. She carefully lifted it closer. \"In Loving Memory of Hope.\" Her throat tightened. \"Leanna, let's go.\" Chase hissed, flipping the keys to Mrs. Truman's dusty classic Porsche and hefting their bag. She hesitated, then slipped the heart into her pocket, edging out the guilt.\n***\n\"Why push it?\" Leanna's voice shook as the Porsche roared. \"No one's after us yet.\"\nA truck blared its horn and they narrowly dodged it through the intersection. A police siren blared from the left as they raced onto the turnoff. He clenched his jaw.\n\"They do now.\"\n\"Get my phone, confirm the shipping container's ready for the car.\" \"What's your password?\"\n\"It's your name.\"\nThe suburbs transformed quickly to the forest and paddock, Eucalyptus trees arching a tunnel. She raised an eyebrown and he smuggled a smirk, catching copper's lights in the rear view.\nHe had a sense of certainty she dreamed of. He'd know if he should be a dad.\n\"Chase, I need to tell you something.\"\n\"Yeah?\" he said through teeth, the car arcing a corner.\n\"I'm pregnant.\"\nChase's foot hesitated off the accelerator, just enough to lose traction. The rear slid, clipped a tree, then slammed into another, then stopped. The undercarriage groaned, cradled by the roots, steam hissing from the hood. The sirens pulsed in the distance, but no worse than Leanna's head. Chase yanked open her door, grabbing the bag. \"Move!\"\nThey stumbled into the dense woods, branches clawing at her face, roots snagging her feet. Chase darted, agile, while Leanna lagged behind. Her belly added weight. She stumbled, catching herself on a rough trunk, bark biting her palms.\n\"Chase, slow down!\" she gasped, her voice thin in the vast dark. He turned, eyes sharp, then waved her on. \"Keep up! We can't stop.\"\nThe ground dipped again, a shallow slope slick with fallen leaves.\nHer boot sought ground, but the crust collapsed, dropping her into a forgotten shaft. She cried out, ankle blazing as hands clawed at dirt and rock.\nChase's voice echoed from above. \"You're too deep to reach... I'll be back.\"\n\"Chase, don't leave me!\" Her plea broke, raw. \"Chase!\"\nHis footsteps faded into the trees, swallowed by the dark. Coal glinted in the shaft's walls. Her ankle seared as she tried to stand. Sirens droned at the edge of the musty bush.\nChase swore he'd never abandon her. Now she'd gone and ruined it. Why would a drifter want to be a father? She should have stayed with Truman... Safe. Secure.\nSobbing, she shifted, the locket jabbing into her thigh. She pulled it free, silver cool in her shaking grip. The latch clicked open, slipping out a folded note, revealing a framed faded ultrasound. She unfurled the paper, the delicate script trembling.\nTo my little Hope, How is it up there? Do you look down on us and smile? I don't know which was worse, screaming to the hospital or leaving it. Empty. Or sitting in your room. Waiting. Or the way that friends consoled me. As if I had failed. Or when they stopped asking. Sometimes I wonder what I did wrong, for God to be the one to hold you first, to feel your warmth instead of me. I miss you. Maybe when we meet again you can hug me back. Leanna held the locket tight. Even if Chase doesn't want this, she was going to be a mother. Until then, be a strong girl. You are my Hope. Love, Mum\nThis Gutted Hollow\nBy Derek Fisher\nI've been here before. This gutted hollow's walls were more chiaroscuro-charcoal back then, less comic-cartoon colours. The smell of decay and destitution still remains. Five years ago, I was 17, loving life as a hand-cam for hire, making music videos for urban-rap artists. Having trespassed many places so perfect for our purposes, we'd exhausted possibilities then heard a fire had recently ravaged Queens Wharf West. Incinerated quickly meant abandoned.\nThis time, I'm following Naomi. She makes social-realist documentaries, providing a mouthpiece for marginalised voices. We're here to see who's sheltering in the charred and blackened 'broken' at our feet. We find Ro.\n\"You'd never have found me if the bladder wasn't chirping up. Gotta go but. Gotta go.\"\nAnd he does. Right there in the corner.\nNaomi explains. \"We're making a documentary about Newcastle's homeless to get their perspectives. Can I ask your name?\"\n\"Ro will do.\"\n\"No worries, Ro. How would you feel about talking to us on camera?\"\nNo reply, just a posture, a sculpture of recoil, a visceral reticence.\n\"We could record you off-camera? Use your voice-over to comment on the vision we shoot.\"\n\"Yeah.\" A slight nod. \"Okay.\"\nI set up fast, working invisibly to keep it natural and let the subject speak.\n\"This place has been ruined for years - \"\n\"Five, actually,\" I unhelpfully interrupt.\n\"Since the fire,\" says Ro. \"I read about it. I used to walk past with my partner on the way to get fish and chips. That was before.\"\nNaomi says nothing. I try not to breathe too loudly.\n\"Yeah, that was before. We all have different versions of before but our afters are much the same. My 'before' was gambling, the pokies. I've spoken to others. Their 'before' might be domestic violence, unemployment, might be all-sorts.\"\nRo casts an arm around the room. \"The 'after' is always a little bit a lot like this.\"\n\"I've met some characters doing the rounds - some help, some hurt. Gloria was luckily the first I knew. She taught me street-ways, homeless-hacks, transient-tricks. Golden rule: get shifty. Shift where you stay, then circle back through your cycle of options. Shift when you sleep, shift who you hang with. See life as a sequence of shifts, each with one goal - survival.\"\nThis time it's Naomi's breathing I hear then she says, \"Can we get you in touch with any services? Get you checked out by a doc?\"\n\"Thanks, I'm good. I know where to go when needed. The body takes a beating but, this life, it's hard on the mind, hard on the soul.\"\nHe coughs and, for some reason, so do we.\n\"Some of us thought we were going to die last year, asphyxiation by gas! Someone got under the building by water, drilled straight into gas-lines, trying to find copper they could nick and sell-on.\" He starts to nod like a metronome, like a stuck-needle, like a pigeon taking stock.\nI'm antsy, uncomfortable, feeling my awkwardness of five years ago. Our rap-video was interrupted by a homeless man who growled until we bolted. We'd laughed, but heading home I clocked how much we middle-class pretenders were, well, pretending. We had bad-ass lyrics about hard-done lives bouncing off deep-bass beats. We had quick-cut edits and close-up sneers, fired-up fists of fury. We had no idea at all. Five years on, I've not much more to show.\n\"Have you spoken to others?\" asks Ro, looking towards the harbour where the ferry chugs the churn.\n\"We just started,\" says Naomi. \"You're the first homeless voice we've met. We began by filming council on their latest site-tour after the recent site-investigation.\" She turns. \"Show Ro the clip!\"\nI can see, through jagged-edged apertures, down to where we filmed this footage, before being stopped from going further on the 'tour' being undertaken. Present were a councillor and building inspector in respective 'sort-of' uniforms plus a developer, very expensively suited.\nI gesture Ro to check the screen. The three stand in a triangle, each like a trophy, feet planted firm and hands-on-hips.\nThe building inspector says the site's unusable, not fit for purpose. The councillor responds that the mission is to revitalise, re-energise.\nThe developer asks about consultation and other processes. The developer smiles. \"So, we demolish early 2026?\"\nWe look to Ro for a response. \"Demolish?\"\nI re-jig the equipment for recording, take a panning shot, track through the glassless aperture, pulling out to high-angle tilt-down on the harbour's glistening water-views.\n\"You'll need to move on,\" says Naomi, \"but they've taken so long, it may never actually happen.\"\n\"Anyway,\" I offer, \"governments might start providing better places to lay your head?\"\nRo looks out towards water-views beckoning him like a tide. We see the ferry, hear the cockroaches rustle. We hear the 'broken' in the refuse at our feet.\nWe hear Ro, gutted, hollow: \"I've been here before.\"\nHeadspace\nBy Peter Rodgers\nI went there yesterday, to mark your birthday. I lit a candle and drank a half-bottle of Prosecco. The place is as scruffy as ever, vivid with memory.\nHow I miss you there, how I miss us there. It's three years since I stumbled into that fractured room. Which one of us was most startled we'll never know.\n\"Sorry,\" I mumbled awkwardly as you rose from that ancient, threadbare lounge. \"I didn't realise...\"\n\"What do you want?\" you demanded.\n\"I've often driven past this place and wondered.\"\n\"Wondered what?\"\n\"What it was like inside. Who might have lived here, what happened to them? What they felt when they saw that?\"\nYou followed my gaze to the lemony sky outside, the multi-tinted water, the infinite air. Your voice softened as you asked what I felt there. \"Wonder,\" I breathed, \"just wonder.\"\nSilence, before I asked why you were there. You considered.\n\"I've had a diagnosis. Here there are no expectations, no demands on me. I can just be. I'll keep coming as long as I can.\"\n\"What about your family?\" I asked. \"They'll cope.\"\nI thought that brusque, but when I met them I saw your confidence was well placed.\nOne day I pointed at the bright, anarchic colours daubed on the walls and asked, \"What's the message there?\"\n\"Who knows?\" you said. \"Protest, anger, disappointment about the world, maybe nothing at all. If you demand a message all the time, you ruin imagination. Wasn't the world more intriguing when the moon was made of cheese?\"\nYou urged me to add to the art. I bought a green paint canister. It sat untouched for several months before an unknown visitor rewarded us with stylish four-leaf clovers. Lying on that cloverleaf in sleeping bags one night, you said you had news.\n\"You've seen the doctor again?\" I asked, anxious. \"No. The news is I've decided not to take you as a lover.\"\nIt took me a while to muster a response. \"I didn't know I was an applicant.\"\n\"Come on, Jeremy,\" you replied, close to cross. \"That possibility must have crossed your mind. I know I'm older, quite a bit actually, not at my best anymore. Still. Maybe I'm the one who should feel offended?\"\n\"I thought briefly about one last fling, and you're an appealing candidate. But I couldn't manage it.\"\n\"Are you that ill?\" I asked. \"Not that. When friends become lovers, they must rebalance. That takes time, which we don't have. Okay?\"\n\"Okay,\" I said, thankful the dark had masked my flushed, uncertain face.\nI brought a picnic basket next time. As we ate, you said you'd been reading about the Queen. \"After what you've said about her and all the royals?,\" I chided.\n\"Alright, alright! But she once described Balmoral Castle as her special place, her happy place. It has 167 rooms, 52 of which are bedrooms, so that just doesn't make sense.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\"Let's say one lived there full-time, spending a week in each bedroom. It'd take a whole year to do the circuit.\"\n\"One's point being?\" I teased.\n\"That's just an extravagance, an indulgence, not a special place in the heart. Not like this,\" you added softly.\nNext time we met, I asked what you thought left this place abandoned.\n\"A family got too large, too small, too greedy, too indifferent,\" you replied.\nA small ferry, perfectly framed by the window mouth, glided across the water beyond. I pointed and said, \"How could anyone become indifferent to a scene like that?\"\n\"Maybe a dream went badly wrong,\" you ventured. \"Dreams are prone to that. A catastrophe perhaps?\"\n\"Such as?\"\n\"A business partner cleaned out the vault and disappeared, a family member was killed?\"\n\"Should I try to find out?\" I asked.\n\"No, please don't.\" you sounded quite alarmed. \"That might change everything for us. Remember what I said about the moon and cheese?\"\nWe sat quietly. \"You're so comfortable with silence. It intrigues me. Others are usually anxious to plug the gap.\"\n\"I'm only silent on the outside,\" you smiled. \"On the inside it's often like a madhouse. I like our silences, though. I know there'll always be more good words when we need them.\"\n\"I'll miss you,\" I said.\n\"I'll miss you missing me,\" you laughed. \"Please come to my funeral. But promise to stay away at the end. You should see me only here.\" I agreed.\n\"You sound disappointed.\"\n\"I'm sad,\" I said.\n\"One thing. Please collect some paint flakes from that crazy wall and sprinkle them over my grave.\"\n\"Wait till I'm in there, please,\" you laughed, wiping your eyes.\nMy days are busy. My job's unexciting but it pays the mortgage. When my two boys are older, I will take them to our place and tell them all about you. The ferries will intrigue them. I will hide my sorrow.",
