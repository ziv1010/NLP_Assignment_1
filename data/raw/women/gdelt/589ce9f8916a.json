  "body_text": "RANKED: The top 5 breakthrough Lionesses in Sarina Wiegman's England squad\n- England are up against Germany and South Africa this month\n- Sarina Wiegman has named her 22-player squad\n- Choosing the latest breakthrough players\nThe October international break is officially underway, with England preparing to face Germany and South Africa in two home friendly matches across the coming week.\nSarina Wiegman has announced her 22-player squad for the upcoming fixtures, featuring several promising young talents in the mix. Notable mentions among the standout stars is goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse, who currently plies her trade for NWSL table-toppers Orlando Pride.\nMoorhouse has earned her second call-up to the senior Lionesses, while Aston Villa’s Lucy Parker also makes her return to Wiegman’s England squad.\nHere are 90min’s top five breakout Lionesses.\n5. Jessica Naz (Tottenham Hotspur)\nTottenham Hotspur forward Jessica Naz has retained her place in the Lionesses squad after an impressive start to the 2024/25 season.\nNaz made her senior debut for England in July during the UEFA Women’s Nations League match against the Republic of Ireland and has been making waves for Spurs in the WSL since then.\nWith five starts in five league games for Tottenham so far, this rising Lioness is definitely one to watch.\n4. Jess Park (Manchester City)\nAfter stepping up in the Manchester City squad following Jill Roord’s ACL injury back in January, Jess Park became a key midfielder for Gareth Taylor's Cityzens during a heated title race at the back-end of the 2023/24 season.\nPark has firmly established herself in City's starting lineup and recently claimed the Barclays Women’s Super League ‘Goal of the Month’ award for her stunning strike in City’s 2-2 draw against Arsenal on the opening weekend.\nPark also impressed for England in their match against the Republic of Ireland at Carrow Road in July, and she has earned her place once again in the Lionesses squad for the upcoming friendlies.\n3. Aggie Beever-Jones (Chelsea)\nChelsea forward Aggie Beever-Jones made her debut alongside Jess Naz in England’s 2-1 victory over the Republic of Ireland and has earned her place back in the Lionesses squad for this international break.\nScoring 11 goals in the WSL last season, the 21-year-old has carried her strong form into the 2024/25 campaign after recently scoring in Chelsea’s 3-1 win over FC Twente in the UEFA Women’s Champions League.\nWith some of England’s other forwards perhaps struggling for consistency, this could be the perfect moment for Beever-Jones to make her mark in the Lionesses' attack.\n2. Maya Le Tissier (Manchester United)\nRecently named Manchester United’s new captain after Katie Zelem's departure this summer, Maya Le Tissier has continued to make her mark in the WSL.\nAt just 22 years old, she has become a key figure in United's defence, playing alongside the likes of the experienced Dominique Janssen and Millie Turner at the heart of the Red Devils' backline.\nUnited's defence has been rock-solid this season, conceding just one goal in four WSL matches. Le Tissier has also contributed to the side at the other end of the pitch, slotting home a penalty to secure a 3-0 win against Tottenham in matchweek 4.\nWith recent injury concerns surrounding Leah Williamson and Lotte Wubben-Moy, there may be an opportunity for Le Tissier to earn deserved minutes with the Lionesses in the upcoming friendlies.\n1. Grace Clinton (Manchester United)\nNo list of breakout stars would be complete without mentioning Grace Clinton. The 21-year-old made her debut for the senior England team in October 2023 and has retained her spot in the squad ever since.\nThere is no denying that Clinton had her breakout year while on loan at Tottenham for the 2023/24 season, where she played a key role in helping Spurs achieve a sixth-place finish under Robert Vilahamn. \"You have your superstar now,\" the Spurs boss proclaimed last season.\nSince returning to her parent club, Manchester United, over the summer, Clinton has continued to shine. She has already scored three goals this season, proving her place in a league full of the brightest stars.\nBased on her current form, there doesn’t seem to be a reason as to why Clinton won’t be included in Wiegman’s lineup to face Germany this Friday at Wembley Stadium.",
