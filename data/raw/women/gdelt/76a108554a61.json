This is known as an honorary award.\nWhere can I find the list?\nThe list is typically published by the Cabinet Office .\nYou will be able to find the list on the Gov.uk website, or in the London Gazette, the Crown's formal public record. Here is the Gazette's publication of the 2025 New Years Honours list.\nWhat do the different honours mean?\nThe honours bestowed by the King recognise different types and levels of service. Some of the most well-known ones are shown below, but you can find more of them here on the government's website.\nKnighthood or damehood: This is awarded for having a major contribution in any activity, usually at national level. Other people working in the nominee’s area will see their contribution as inspirational and significant, requiring commitment over a long period of time. The knighthood is also usually attached to one of several 'orders', which further signifies the nature of the award. For example, knight and damehoods of the Order of the British Empire (GBE, DBE and KBE) reward contributions to the arts, sciences, charity and public service, while the Order of St Michael and St George primarily recognises service to the UK overseas or internationally.\nCommander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE): This is awarded for having a prominent but lesser role at national level, or a leading role at regional level. You can also get one for a distinguished or innovative contribution to any area.\nOfficer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE): This is awarded for having a major local role in any activity, including people whose work has made them known nationally in their chosen area.\nMember of the Order of the British Empire (MBE): Awarded for an outstanding achievement or service to the community. This will have had a long-term, significant impact and stand out as an example to others.\nBritish Empire Medal (BEM): Given for 'hands on' service in a particular area or innovative work which has delivered real impact in a short period of time.",
