  "body_text": "Arsenal rising star Michelle Agyemang has joined Brighton & Hove Albion on a season-long loan ahead of the 2025/26 Women’s Super League campaign.\nThe 19-year-old forward has been with Arsenal since the age of six and debuted for the first team in the WSL victory over Leicester City in November 2022. She has made six competitive appearances, scoring one goal.\nDue to her struggles to get enough game time, she spent last season on loan with the Seagulls, where she impressed, scoring five goals in 22 matches to earn a nomination for the WSL’s Rising Star award.\nShe also earned a maiden call-up to the Three Lionesses squad in April and was subsequently named in the squad for the European Championship.\nShe scored two crucial goals in four games to help Sarina Wiegman’s side retain the title and was named the Young Player of the Tournament.\nThe England international has also been nominated for the Kopa Trophy.\nWith forwards Alessia Russo, Beth Mead, Caitlin Foord and Stina Blackstenius and record signing Olivia Smith all competing for places in Renee Slegers’ side, Agyemang’s game time would have been limited had she stayed.\nDirector of Women’s Football Clare Wheatley said the club, with Agyemang and her family, decided that spending next season on loan was the best for the forward.\nShe told Arsenal.com: “We’re so proud of Michelle’s achievements this summer and throughout her journey at Arsenal, from her first steps in our academy through to our first-team squad.\n“After discussing closely with Michelle and her family, we have all agreed that this move will provide Michelle with a further opportunity to develop and grow, as she continues to progress as a young player and person. We wish Michelle every success at Brighton and look forward to welcoming her back to Arsenal at the end of her loan.”\nThe youngster will be hoping to impress at Brighton for the second consecutive season to enhance her chances of becoming a regular for Arsenal in the next campaign.\n.",
