  "body_text": "Saudi Arabia is no longer just a participant in the global sports arena; it is rapidly becoming its heartbeat. Driven by a multi-generational passion for the game and an unprecedented wave of national investment, the Kingdom is reshaping the landscape of world football through a blend of future-forward infrastructure and elite-level competition.\nThe definitive marker of this ambition is the successful bid to host the FIFA World Cup 2034. This monumental undertaking features a portfolio of 15 stadiums across cities like Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar, Abha, and the futuristic NEOM.\nThe centrepiece will be the 92,000-seat King Salman International Stadium in Riyadh, slated to host the final, while NEOM and Qiddiya will unveil gravity-defying arenas that challenge traditional architecture. To support the global influx of fans, over 180,000 hotel rooms are planned, with the new Riyadh Metro and Riyadh Air ensuring seamless travel across the Kingdom's compact geography.\nWhile the roadmap leads to 2034, the present-day action is equally electric. The Saudi Pro League (SPL) has evolved into a global ‘Superstar Central’ since the landmark arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo. Today, the league boasts names like Neymar Jr. and Karim Benzema, turbo-charging its technical quality and worldwide visibility. Furthermore, the Kingdom has become the home for European club spectacles, hosting the Spanish and Italian Super Cups, where giants like Real Madrid and Barcelona regularly compete on Saudi soil.\nBeyond the glittering headlines of the men’s game, a renaissance is occurring in women’s football. Participation has surged by 195 per cent since 2021, supported by a professionalised league and major global sponsors like Lay's. With over 70,000 girls now active in grassroots programs, the women’s national team is currently preparing for its first AFC Women’s Asian Cup qualifiers in 2026.\nFor the sports traveller, the match is merely the entry point to a broader discovery. From the high-octane atmosphere of Jeddah’s Formula 1 track to the UNESCO-listed heritage of Diriyah and AlUla, Saudi Arabia is positioning itself as a playground of sport, music and culture.",
