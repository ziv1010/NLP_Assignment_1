  "body_text": "Diogo Jota died in car crash after doctors told him not to fly back to UK\nDiogo Jota, the Liverpool FC forward, died in a car crash after doctors reportedly told him to drive 10 hours to a Spanish ferry rather than fly to the UK.\nJota was killed with his brother Andre Silva as fire engulfed his £180,000 Lamborghini after if suffered a tyre blowout while overtaking in the Spanish province of Zamora. The 28-year-old father-of-three had married his childhood sweetheart Rute Cardoso just 11 days earlier.\nTelegraph Sport understands Jota was 190 miles into a trip from Porto to Santander because of medical advice to avoid taking a plane back to pre-season training.\nJota played 27 minutes of his country’s 2-1 win over Czech Republic last month but is said to have then undergone minor, lung-related surgery. He had suffered a rib injury while playing against Chelsea in October last season, which forced him to miss almost two months of Liverpool’s successful Premier League title charge.\nIt is unclear where he was given advice to avoid flying. One claimed Jota had also travelled out of the UK to his native Porto via the ferry from Plymouth to Santander.\nOn Thursday the football world was reeling by the “tragic loss” of a renowned talent at the peak of his playing career. A Liverpool statement said the club was “devastated” and that it was an “unimaginable loss”.\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot spoke very movingly, saying: “What can anyone say at a time like this when the shock and pain is so incredibly raw? I wish I had the words but I do not.\n“All I have are feelings that I know so many people will share about a person and player we loved dearly and a family we care so much about.\n“My first thoughts are not those of a football manager. They are of a father, a son, a brother and an uncle and they belong to the family of Diogo and Andre Silva who have experienced such an unimaginable loss. My message to them is very clear – you will never walk alone.\n“The last time we spoke, I congratulated Diogo on winning the Nations League and wished him luck for his forthcoming wedding. In many ways, it was a dream summer for Diogo and his family, which makes it all the more heartbreaking that it should end like this.\n“When the time is right, we will celebrate Diogo Jota, we will remember his goals and we will sing his song. For the time being, we will remember him as a unique human being and mourn his loss.”\nThe Prince of Wales, patron of the Football Association, also paid tribute, saying he was “deeply saddened”. Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portugal national team’s captain, said Jota’s death “doesn’t make sense”.\nJota scored 65 goals in 182 games for Liverpool, with whom he won a Premier League title, the League Cup and the FA Cup, having joined from Wolverhampton Wanderers in September 2020. He made 49 appearances for Portugal, scoring 14 goals, and was part of the side who won the Nations League last month.\nJota and his 26-year-old brother were found dead in the wreckage on the A-52 in Palacios de Sanabria shortly after midnight. Witnesses who called 112 [the local emergency number] said the car was engulfed in flames and also caused a blaze in nearby vegetation.\nSources from the government sub-delegation in Zamora immediately confirmed “a possible speeding incident” was being looked at. Other insiders told The Telegraph that Jota’s family had flown back to the UK separately. The car involved is believed to be a green Lamborghini Huracan Evo Spyder, which has a top speed of 200mph and 0-60mph time of 3.1 seconds. Police have yet to establish who was driving.\nJota, who was due to return to Liverpool’s pre-season training next week, had married his long-term partner two weeks ago in a Catholic service packed with family and friends in Porto.\nThe couple had been an item for more than a decade and had two sons and most recently a daughter born in November. He shared many family photographs on his Instagram account, while his wife has posted images of their holidays in Dubai and Lapland.\nIt is most likely Jota and his brother, who also played football at lower levels, were intending to board a Brittany Ferries service from Santander to Plymouth, which left at 4pm on Thursday, arriving in Devon at 11.15am on Friday.\nCNN Portugal’s sports editor Rui Loura had been first to report that Jota had been advised against flying. “The surgery he had was lung surgery and he had been advised against flying following this,” Loura said. “He was on his way to the northern Spanish port city of Santander to cross by ferry and reach the UK that way and carry on with the car once he reached Britain.” Others suggested he had previously avoided flying because of “pulmonary discomfort”.\nAmid an outpouring of grief in Liverpool, fans started leaving tributes outside Anfield on Thursday – with flowers being laid with messages including “Thanks for everything, Diogo”.\nProfessor John Ashton, the former North-West public health director who became a key Hillsborough whistleblower, described the profound effect Jota’s death will have on the club. He told The Telegraph: “For Liverpool FC and supporters, it is potentially triggering of the emotions we have when death visits the club and the memories that are immediately relived about Hillsborough. We share the family’s grief and if it’s any comfort for the family to know: the entire community of LFC will be thinking of them and will be there as they go through this grieving. They will never walk alone.”\nSir Kenny Dalglish, the former Liverpool manager in charge when 97 fans died in 1989, shared Prof Ashton’s sentiments. “Football is not important at this sad time. You feel helpless, knowing there’s so little we can do to ease the pain for his wife of just two weeks, his three beautiful children. Thinking and praying for all their loved ones after the devastating loss of both Diogo and Andre.”\nAnother former Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, said on Instagram he was “heartbroken”. His statement said: “This is a moment where I struggle! There must be a bigger purpose! But I can’t see it! I’m heartbroken to hear about the passing of Diogo and his brother Andre.” Prince Williams added: “Our thoughts are with his family, friends, and all who knew him.”\nAndy Robertson, his Liverpool team-mate, said: “The ones I’m thinking about most right now are the family. Their loss is too much to bear. I’m so sorry that they have lost two such precious souls – Diogo and Andre.\n“I could talk about him as a player for hours, but none of that feels like it matters right now. It’s the man. The person. He was such a good guy. The best. So genuine. Just normal and real. Full of love for the people he cared about. Full of fun.\n“The last time I saw him was the happiest day of his life – his wedding day. I want to remember his never-ceasing smile from that magical day. How much he was bursting with love for his wife and family.”\nReal Madrid player Trent Alexander-Arnold paid an emotional tribute to his former Liverpool team-mate: “It’s so difficult to find the right words when your head and heart are struggling to accept that someone you care so much about has gone.”\n“Diogo, your family was your world. They were everything. For Rute, his children, and his parents, all of our hearts are broken. And for Andre as well. Brothers and best friends.\n“When it’s less painful, I want to remember Diogo with a big smile. So many laughs and happy moments. He was such a great team-mate and a true friend. Forever number 20. Rest in peace, Diogo.”\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk shared a touching tribute. Posting on Instagram, the Dutchman said: “Man, I can’t believe it, I don’t wanna believe it.\n“Absolutely devastated and in total disbelief. What a human being, what a player, but most importantly what an unbelievable family man.\n“You meant so much to all of us and you always will! For your family to lose two sons, a husband and a father is just unimaginable.\n“So cruel and unfair. My heart is breaking for all of your beautiful family, for Rute and for your kids. I promise you that in these difficult times and beyond we will always be there for your family. A champion forever, number 20 forever.\n“It’s been a privilege to have stood by your side on the pitch, and to have been your friend off it. We will miss you beyond words and never forget you.\n“Your legacy will live on, we will make sure of it! Rest in perfect peace Diogo & Andre.”\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy told the Commons the whole House “is heartbroken by this news”, while Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Jota’s death was “devastating news” and “there are millions of Liverpool fans, but also football fans, and non-fans, who will also be shocked by this”.\nSteve Rotheram, the Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, said he was “heartbroken” and it was a “huge loss to our city and the world of football”.\nZamora, close to the Portuguese border, is about halfway between Porto and the port of Santander by road. Spain’s Civil Guard said “everything points to a tyre blowout while overtaking”.\nThe identities of the bodies will not be fully verified until after forensic tests.\nAndre Silva most recently played for Penafiel in Portugal’s second division. He previously played for the youth teams of FC Porto, where his brother spent a season on loan.\n07:09 PM BST\nHughes and Edwards: ‘We feel utterly bereft’\nLiverpool’s sporting directors Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes have left a statement on the club’s website saying “we are consumed by shock and sorrow”:\n‘There is nothing that we can say in this moment to ease the pain of such a devastating tragedy. We all feel utterly bereft right now.\nIn such heartbreaking circumstances, it is our responsibility to acknowledge the collective grief we are experiencing, to pay tribute to our Diogo, and to offer unwavering support to his family who remain our absolute priority at this time.\nDiogo’s wife, Rute, their three beautiful children, his parents and wider family are facing an unimaginable loss. This tragic accident has taken not only Diogo, but also his brother, Andre Silva. We mourn them both equally. We must respect the family’s privacy and give them the space to grieve in whichever way they need.\nOf course, we – his Liverpool family – are also struggling to come to terms with what has happened. As his teammates, friends and colleagues, we are consumed by shock and sorrow. We know our supporters, his national team, former clubs and teammates and the wider football community share in this grief. This is a tragedy that transcends Liverpool Football Club.\nIn the coming days, we as a club will look to honour our beloved number 20 with the respect and affection he so richly deserves. We will strive to make these tributes meaningful and inclusive of our supporters, to whom Diogo meant so much.\nFor now, we express a love that is filled with deep sorrow and pain. We have lost someone truly irreplaceable.\nRest in peace, Diogo.\nYNWA’\n07:03 PM BST\nPogba posts\n06:49 PM BST\nStatement from Fenway Sport Group\nThe following statement has been released by Billy Hogan, John W Henry, Tom Werner, Mike Gordon:\n‘On behalf of the leadership teams at Liverpool Football Club and Fenway Sports Group, we offer our sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of our number 20, Diogo Jota, and his brother Andre Silva.\nThis tragic situation and the reality of it is truly shocking, devastating and has left us numb with grief. We therefore cannot imagine how the immediate and wider family of these remarkable brothers must be feeling. Our thoughts, prayers and support are with them all.\nWe all know what Diogo could do on the field of play and the vital role he played in our successes since he joined this club in 2020. How he quickly became a firm fan favourite, and his song reverberated around Anfield and in stadiums across the world. So many special moments, so many special memories.\nBut beyond the player that we all knew was a wonderfully humble human being, he was sincere, intelligent, funny, tough and created connections with people everywhere he went. He had a zest for life that was utterly contagious.\nDiogo was a loving father, son, husband and brother, and we, and everyone who knew him, will miss him deeply as we all try to process the enormity of today.\nRest in peace, Diogo and Andre. You Will Never Walk Alone.\nBilly, John, Tom, Mike.’\n06:40 PM BST\nSlot: ‘The pain is so raw’\nLiverpool head coach Arne Slot has released a statement on the Liverpool website saying “the shock and the pain is so incredibly raw”. It reads as follows:\n‘What to say? What can anyone say at a time like this when the shock and the pain is so incredibly raw? I wish I had the words but I know I do not.\nAll I have are feelings that I know so many people will share about a person and a player we loved dearly and a family we care so much about.\nMy first thoughts are not those of a football manager. They are of a father, a son, a brother and an uncle and they belong to the family of Diogo and Andre Silva who have experienced such an unimaginable loss.\nMy message to them is very clear – you will never walk alone. The players, the staff, the supporters of Liverpool Football Club are all with you and from what I have seen today, the same can be said of the wider family of football.\nThis is not solely a response to tragedy. It is also a reaction to the goodness of the people involved and the respect that so many have for the boys as individuals and for the family as a whole.\nFor us as a club, the sense of shock is absolute. Diogo was not just our player. He was a loved one to all of us. He was a team-mate, a colleague, a workmate and in all of those roles he was very special.\nI could say so much about what he brought to our team but the truth is everyone who watched Diogo play could see it. Hard work, desire, commitment, great quality, goals. The essence of what a Liverpool player should be.\nThere were also the parts that not everyone got to see. The person who never sought popularity but found it anyway. Not a friend to two people, a friend to everyone. Someone who made others feel good about themselves just by being with them. A person who cared deeply for his family.\nThe last time we spoke, I congratulated Diogo on winning the Nations League and wished him luck for his forthcoming wedding. In many ways, it was a dream summer for Diogo and his family, which makes it all the more heartbreaking that it should end like this.\nWhen I first came to the club, one of the first songs I got to know was the one that our fans sing for Diogo. I had not worked with him previously but I knew straight away that if the Liverpool supporters, who have seen so many great players over the years, had such a unique chant for Diogo, he must have special qualities.\nThat we have lost those qualities in such terrible circumstances is something we have not yet come to terms with. For this reason, we need everyone at the club to stand together and to be there for one another. We owe this to Diogo, to Andre Silva, to their wider family and to ourselves.\nMy condolences go to Diogo’s wife, Rute, their three beautiful children and to the parents of Diogo and Andre Silva.\nWhen the time is right, we will celebrate Diogo Jota, we will remember his goals and we will sing his song. For the time being, we will remember him as a unique human being and mourn his loss. He will never be forgotten.\nHis name is Diogo.’\n05:55 PM BST\nBruno Fernandes posts\nManchester United and Portugal captain Bruno Fernandes has left a message for his international team-mate.\nFriend, colleague and companion of a thousand battles ❤️\nIt’s hard to understand how can someone leave so soon.\nMay you and your brother find the peace you need to watch over your loved ones who lost you too soon and suddenly.\nMy condolences to all your family 🕊️\n04:50 PM BST\nPSG pay tribute\nL'entraînement a débuté par une minute de silence pour honorer la mémoire de Diogo Jota et André Silva.\nToutes les pensées du Paris Saint-Germain vont à leur famille et à leurs proches. pic.twitter.com/T3DTcw3o6s— Paris Saint-Germain (@PSG_inside) July 3, 2025\n04:38 PM BST\nBayern do similar at training\nA minute's silence at FC Bayern before training for Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva. 🙏🏼🕊️pic.twitter.com/8aDzbqXFYT\n— Florian Plettenberg (@Plettigoal) July 3, 2025\n04:32 PM BST\nChelsea pay tribute\nChelsea training session in Miami starting with a minute's silence for Diogo Jota. 💙 pic.twitter.com/M7zbuZrrmR\n— CFC-Blues (@CFCBlues_com) July 3, 2025\n04:14 PM BST\nReal Madrid mark Jota’s passing\nA minute's silence before training in memory of Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva. pic.twitter.com/NfwiPPM1b2\n— Real Madrid C.F. 🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@realmadriden) July 3, 2025\n03:44 PM BST\nMessi posts on Instagram\nQEPD translates as “Que en paz descanse” and essentially means “rest in peace” in Spanish.\n03:26 PM BST\nMore from Jota’s former team Wolves\nMatt Wild, Wolves’ director of football operations & administration said: “We are all completely shocked.

We’ll all be looking back on those memories today, the part he played in it and our time with him.\n“Diogo embodied our values at the club. He was so humble, so kind, so professional, but yet determined and hungry.
