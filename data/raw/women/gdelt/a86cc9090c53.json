  "body_text": "With moderate expectation comes moderate responsibility.\nAnd so I found myself thinking the Portland Trail Blazers let one get away on Sunday against the best team in the NBA, losing 133-129 in overtime to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nPortland is essentially playing with house money at this point. Despite being within range of making the play-in, the team is under no pressure to do so. Nor is there any great urgency to tank games for lottery position.\nInstead, a youthful group led by Deni Avdija, Toumani Camara and Shaedon Sharpe has been free to just play. The most inconvenient veterans on the Blazers roster, Deandre Ayton and Jerami Grant, are both nursing injuries that conveniently clear the runway for the Blazers to go young the rest of the way.\nAnd that’s the group that nearly handed the dominant Cavaliers just their 11th loss. Behind Avdija’s first career triple-double and some timely shooting from Anfernee Simons, the Blazers built an 18-point third quarter lead.\nNow, Cleveland used a game against the middling Trail Blazers as an opportunity to get All-NBA guard Donovan Mitchell some rest. But still, this game felt like a nothing-to-lose affair.\nSo why did I come out of it feeling like the Blazers actually had lost something?\nIn any successful rebuild, there are moments you can point back to as turning points, and I thought Sunday’s matinee had the opportunity to be one of those. Playing on the road in the middle of the longest road trip of the season, the Blazers outplayed and certainly outworked the league’s No. 1 team for most of those 53 minutes.\nIt certainly would have made some noise around the NBA, and perhaps the rest of the league would have woken to the fact that the Blazers have come together in ways nobody saw coming. They play harder than their opponent almost every night and Camara, Avdija and Donovan Clingan make up the core of an emerging defense.\nThings are getting interesting in Portland. The Blazers are good, just not good enough.\nThey are ahead of any reasonable schedule, in large part due to general manager Joe Cronin making an aggressive move to add Avdija, who has been terrific. But that move also accelerated the Blazers’ timeline and increases the pressure on Cronin to capitalize on this foundation and find a star. Or else the Blazers risk being stuck in the middle.\nIt’s an interesting challenge. Cronin expected to add a top lottery pick in the upcoming draft. That now feels like a remote possibility. But with an 18-14 recording since Christmas (entering Tuesday) it would not be unreasonable for the Blazers to be thinking about the 2026 playoffs.\n•\nSoccer season is fully underway, with the Timbers notching their first win of the season on a late set piece from newcomer David Da Costa.\nEvander who?\nThe Thorns are also approaching the start of their season, with the opener set for March 15 at the KC Current. The Thorns injury list is difficult to keep up with. Morgan Weaver and defenders Nicole Payne and Marie Müller have all been lost for the season. It will also be worth monitoring the status of star Sophia Wilson.\nWilson — formerly Smith, who married Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Michael Wilson in January — has not participated in any preseason matches or been with the club at training camp, according to a team spokesperson. The spokesperson said Wilson “continues to be in our return-to-play protocols.”\n•\nThe Oregon men’s baseball team beat Columbia 35-1 on Saturday. It got so out of hand that at one point that Columbia offered to transfer the administration of the Pulitzer Prizes to Oregon’s School of Journalism and Communication just to make it stop.\nOK, not really.\nBut the Ducks shattered their previous runs record of 23. Not bad for a team that has set a school record for home runs in each of the past two seasons.\nHey, NCAA: Have mercy?\n•\nI took my family to Portland State’s men’s basketball game against Montana on Saturday. The Viking Pavilion is the best basketball venue in the city, with light streaming in from the high street-level windows. PSU coach Jase Coburn is as intense and wired as any coach you’ve ever seen. He’s a walking Zyn.\nBut the real highlight was a thrilling win by the Vikings, who ended Montana’s 10-game winning streak in overtime.\nLots of overtime this weekend, huh?\nFull disclosure: My wife and I both studied at Montana. So did the friends we were with. Our presence was not for purely professional reasons.\nWhen PSU went up 2-0 after the opening tip, my 5-year-old said, “Oh no! The white team is winning!”\nI told him it was too early to panic. When the Vikings withstood a 36-point barrage from Grizzlies’ sophomore Money Williams and closed regulation on a 14-2 run to force overtime, I looked at him and said, “Now it’s time to panic.”\nBy then, Coburn’s jacket was off. His shirt was untucked. He was doing jump squats. If this guy gets his team to the NCAA Tournament, he’ll be an instant media darling — if the media can keep up with him.\nLed by Louisiana Tech transfers Terri Miller Jr. and Jaylin Henderson, the Vikings are tough and peaking at the right time after battling injuries most of the season. I wouldn’t sleep on them in the Big Sky Conference tournament in Boise — aptly named Starch Madness – this weekend.\nIf the Vikings beat last-place Sacramento State on Monday, or Idaho State loses to Northern Arizona, the Viks will enter the tournament as the No. 3 seed with wins over both of the top two teams in the conference.\nEveryone is watching what the Ducks do in Eugene, but along with the Portland Pilots women, the Vikings men are the team nobody seems to know they should be talking about.\n•\nSpeaking of the Vikings (and the Griz, for that matter), kudos to new PSU athletic director Matt Billings for getting a football game on the schedule at Providence Park, Nov. 15 against Montana.\nI spoke with Billings, a longtime department administrator, when he was elevated to the position in November. The efforts to schedule a game back downtown were already in the works.\n“I think it matters in the sense of it shows not only us, but it shows other entities downtown, that people are working together,” Billings said then. “There’s a heavy lift, and we all have to do it together.”\nHe was talking about revitalizing downtown, but he could have been talking about Portland State athletics. The department has suffered from a lack of vision and a revolving door of leadership.\nFootball games in Hillsboro are a dud.\n“I just think that there’s some small tweaks that are going to go a long ways here to make this place better,” Billings told me.\nOne game at Providence Park would count as a small tweak. And if it’s a one-off, it probably doesn’t mean too much. But I appreciate the direction and am hopeful there will be more of it.\n-- Bill Oram is the sports columnist at The Oregonian/OregonLive.",
