  "body_text": "Georgia Hale’s introduction to the Kiwi Ferns began just a few kilometres from where the team is staying in western Sydney ahead of Sunday’s Pacific Cup final but for the New Zealand captain it could have been on another planet.\nHale was 19 years old when she first travelled to Australia with the Kiwi Ferns in 2014 and the players had to pay half of the costs for the trip.\n“We stayed in like a dorm – there were 18 girls, it was triple bunks and we all stayed in one room,” Hale recalled.\n“The preparations were not as they are now. I think we had one set of kit, if we were lucky. It was really different.”\nThe Kiwi Ferns Haka\nThe 2017 World Cup and the introduction of the NRLW in 2018 were game changers and as she celebrates 10 years in the Kiwis Ferns jersey Hale believes it is important not to forget the past.\n“We played the game in Wollongong, but we stayed out here in Penrith, so it's a bit of a full circle moment being back in the same neighbourhood,” she said in reference to the team's base at Novotel West HQ.\n“I think it gave me an insight into the kinds of sacrifices made by the girls prior to us - the true pioneers of the game - and what they did to get the game to where it is now. I got a sprinkling of what it was like.\n“Now when we look 10 years on, we’re contracted players on multi-year deals. We're all from an NRLW system, girls are professional, well-conditioned, with better footy brains, and in every single area of the game - media training, nutrition or whatever it is - all your boxes are ticked now.”\nHale has evolved from a playmaker to the protype NRLW lock and was the 2023 IRL Golden Boot winner as the international player of the year. She has again been nominated for the 2024 award.\n2023 Golden Boot: Georgia Hale\n“To play 10 years at this level and to play consistently in one of the toughest positions is a testament to her durability,” Kiwi Ferns coach Ricky Henry said.\n“I think NRLW has been a massive thing for her, she has been able to get a lot of confidence out of playing at that level week in and week out.\n“Georgia is an awesome role model for our group, she ticks every box to prepare for a game and she has got really good football smarts, so we are lucky to have her as part of our squad.”\n2020 Veronica White Medallist – Georgia Hale\nA Veronica White Medal winner in 2020, Hale grew up around rugby league because of her father Laurie’s involvement with the Warriors and Kiwis, and she developed a strong passion for a game.\nA pioneer Warriors player in 2018, she joined the Titans when the club was forced to withdraw from the NRLW competition due to COVID and has enjoyed stints with Leeds in the Women’s Super League.\nWhile she is committed to the Gold Coast until at least another two seasons, Hale has welcomed the return of the Warriors next year as a boost for New Zealand rugby league.\n“We're going to get two seasons with the Warriors leading into the World Cup in 2026, so that's obviously going to build more depth,” she said.\n“I think the Kiwi Ferns is in a really good space. We've welcomed in a new wave of players over last year and this year and I think we're really hitting straps.\n“We're working towards that World Cup goal, so I'm really enjoying the footy I'm playing and the girls I'm playing alongside.”\nWith wedding plans ruling star halfback Raecene McGregor out of this year’s Pacific Championships, Hale has taken on the captaincy after they shared it during last year’s drought breaking win against Australia.\nBroncos playmaker Gayle Broughton has reunited with former Olympic team-mate Tyla King in the halves, while Brooke Anderson has taken over the hooking duties and Ash Quinlan fills the bench utility role.\n“It's great to see so many girls eligible to play for New Zealand or girls finding their heritage and looking into family trees to see if they're eligible because there's definitely a want to play for the Kiwi Ferns,” Hale said.\n“I think the brand of footy we’re playing and how proud we're making the badge is really special.\n“We've lost a bit of success in our Kiwi Ferns Jersey over the last 10 years, it was hard for a while and there were some rough patches but the Pacific Championships have been good for us.\n“We used to play one Test a year but it’s more frequent now and the competition for a jersey is far more intense. We're all out of an NRW system, and I think the quality of footy is better, but it all to start somewhere.”\nMatch: Jillaroos v Kiwi Ferns\nFinal -\nhome Team\nJillaroos\n1st Position\naway Team\nKiwi Ferns\n2nd Position\nVenue: CommBank Stadium, Sydney",
