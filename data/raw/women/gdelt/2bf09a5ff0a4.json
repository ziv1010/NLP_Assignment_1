I think what happens is, when a woman coaches at the highest level, and they’re let go, I don’t think we get as many chances as male coaches, for whatever reason.\n“So if there is a dropout, it’s probably because those opportunities aren’t happening, and also it’s a really tough job to do.\n“You might not get paid a lot of money, you might have childcare to manage, there’s a lot more that goes into it, being a woman, that’s never actually factored in.”\nLaura Kaminski will make her top-flight coaching debut when she leads out newly-promoted Crystal Palace against Tottenham, formerly employers to West Ham boss Rehanne Skinner – the only other Englishwoman in charge of a WSL side.\nThis season is the first the WSL and Championship will operate under their own independent company, Women’s Professional Leagues Ltd.\nAsked about plans to develop more English coaching talent, WPLL CEO Nikki Doucet said: “I think our teams will want the best managers, period. The question is, can the best managers also be local?\nLaura Kaminski on @BarclaysWSL preparations, team news & season targets 🗣️#CPFC\n— Crystal Palace F.C. Women (@cpfc_w) September 7, 2024\n“And so I’d say we care about it, we think about it, and I think the FA cares about it and thinks about it as well, and that would be one of the things – as we’ve brought on a chief football officer – that as we think about that remit and what that role is, that ‘development’ would come under that, both for the talent pathway and also coaching.”\nHayes was speaking at an event promoting the new McDonald’s Makin’ It x Kick It Out coaching bursaries, which the FIFA Best women’s coach winner hopes will open doors to a broader range of prospective coaching talent.\nShe said: “Coach education and qualifications are cost prohibitive, yet there’s still this expectation that people should be able to access great grassroots football coaches for free.\n“There are so many amazing volunteers who work tirelessly in football, and I think more needs to be done to invest in developing these leaders and champion them for the wonderful work that they do.\n“We have to do a better job of being able to access women in the ways that will resonate more with them, as opposed to men working in football.”\nWhen it comes to hiring and retaining more homegrown female talent at elite level, Hayes’ advice to Doucet and her team is similar: “Start asking the questions about what it is you’re failing with.\n“I’ve always felt that how we get women into sport, we have to think about it differently, and I think a piece of work should be done around that.”\nDebates about the best boss in women’s football routinely comes down to two names: Hayes and England head coach Sarina Wiegman.\nNominated for the 2024 Women's Team Coach of the Year Trophy@emmahayes1@USWNT – @ChelseaFCW#ballondor #coachdelannee pic.twitter.com/cKM4fJoWKt\n— Ballon d'Or (@ballondor) September 4, 2024\nWhen the Lionesses announced they would host the USA at Wembley in November, the ensuing excitement focused more on the women in the dugout than the players on the pitch.\nIt is a long-anticipated battle that could be catalytic in inspiring more women to start their own coaching journey.\nHayes added: “I love Sarina as a person and as a coach. I admire all of her achievements, and she’s someone I’ve built a good relationship with over the years.\n“We’re very supportive of each other, but we’re competitive people, so come kick-off it will be a hugely competitive game where we both want to win.\n“I think it’s pretty fantastic. The home of football, the European champions getting to face the Olympic gold medallists, led by two females.”\n::Emma Hayes is backing the new McDonald’s Makin’ It x Kick It Out coaching bursary helping hundreds of young people to start a career in football coaching.
