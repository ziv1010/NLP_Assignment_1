Across the 2023 season, Jodie continued her development with Galway United, adding further top-flight appearances before joining Cork City in 2025. Jodie brings versatility and energy and will be a strong asset for Treaty United Women as they build for the season ahead.\n\"It’s great to be signing for Treaty United Women at this time and I’m looking forward to pre-season training and the season ahead. I was born in Limerick and happy to once again be playing football in my home city,\" Griffin said.\n\"Jodie is an excellent signing for Treaty and comes to us with strong experience. She has shown throughout her career that she competes at a high level in big matches and we look forward to seeing her thrive at Markets Field,\" Treaty United manager Laurie Ryan said.\nGoalkeeper Amber hardy has also signed for the Super Blues ahead of 2026.\nThe Mayo native joins the club as an exciting young goalkeeper, bringing valuable senior experience from Sligo Rovers along with a reputation for composure and reliability between the posts.\nAmber began her career with the Sligo Rovers WU17’s in 2022 before progressing rapidly through the club’s pathway. She made her senior debut at just 16 years of age towards the end of the 2023 season, producing an impressive clean sheet against Shelbourne on her first appearance.\nSince then, she went on to make 18 senior appearances for Sligo, gaining important experience. Amber had previously played for Straide & Foxford United.\nA calm and confident presence, Amber is regarded as a goalkeeper with strong fundamentals, maturity beyond her years and significant potential for further development as she continues her career.\n\"I am really happy to be joining Treaty United Women. It’s a great opportunity for me to continue developing and challenging myself in a new environment,\" Hardy said.\n\"Amber has already gained excellent experience at a young age and has shown real composure in high-level matches. She’s hungry to improve, works hard on and fits exactly the profile of player we want at Treaty United Women as we continue to build and develop the squad,\" Laurie Ryan said.\nTreaty have also confirmed the signing of Rola Olusola from Galway United.\nFrom Galway, Rola joins the club as an exciting attacking addition, bringing proven Women’s Premier Division experience and a strong goalscoring record from her time with Galway WFC and Galway United.\nRola began her senior career with Galway WFC in 2022 before moving to Galway United ahead of the 2023 season. During her time at Galway United she made over 40 appearances in all competitions. She was part of the Galway United squads that lifted the Avenir Sports All-Island Cup in both 2023 and 2024.\nA forward with pace, intelligence and composure in front of goal, Rola has also represented Republic of Ireland at U19 level, underlining her pedigree and potential at the top level of the women’s game.\n\"I am delighted to sign for Treaty United Women. It’s an ambitious club with a clear vision and I’m excited by the direction the team is going in. I am looking forward to getting started, working with the coaching staff and players and giving everything I can to help the team this season. I’m excited for this new challenge, \"Olusola said.\n\"Rola is a great addition to Treaty United Women. She brings excellent experience from her time at Galway, has competed in big matches and knows what it takes to be successful at this level.\n\"Rola is a forward with real quality and a strong work ethic and we believe she will be a great addition to our attacking options this season,\" manager Laurie Ryan said.\nTreaty have also announced the re-signing of Ciara Breslin and Grace McInerney.\nDefender McInerney, originally from Ballysimon, progressed from the Under 17’s to the senior team, and remains an important part of the squad, having been a positive influence within the group during her time at the club. Grace’s defensive reliability and work rate have made her a valued member of the Treaty United Women setup.\nGrace’s decision to continue with the club provides continuity within the defensive unit as Treaty United Women prepare for another campaign.\n\"Being part of this club has been great for my development, and winning the 17s league was a great memory. It’s been fun earning appearances as I aim to hit the 100 senior appearance mark soon. Laurie is a great person and player, so I’m looking forward to playing for her in the coming season,\" McInerney said.\n\"Grace has been a consistent performer and brings a strong work ethic and attitude to the squad. She understands what is required and continues to develop her game, which makes her an important part of our plans going into the new season,\" Laurie Ryan said.\nStriker Ciara Breslin has also re-signed.\nBreslin, who joined Treaty in 2024, has provided an attacking outlet for the side, offering massive energy and a direct threat up front. Her work rate on and off the ball have made her avery useful option in attack.\nAs Treaty United Women look to build momentum and consistency across the squad, retaining attacking players who understand the team’s approach and demands remains an important focus. Ciara has also been part of the Rep of Ireland U17 Women’s team and brings that experience with her.\n\"I’m happy to be staying with Treaty United Women. It’s a team I really enjoy being part of and I’m excited to continue working hard, developing my game and contributing this season,\" Breslin said.\n\"Ciara gives us good options in attack. She works hard for the team, brings energy to the front line and has an excellent attitude. I’m very happy to have Ciara with us again in pre-season training,\" manager Laurie Ryan said.\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",
