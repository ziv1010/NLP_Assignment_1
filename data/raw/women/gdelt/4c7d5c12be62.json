And now, the much-loved Future Stars promo is set to launch as the next event.\nFuture Stars debuted in EA Sports' Ultimate Team mode back in FIFA 19, with the unique promo gifting some of the best young players in world football with heavily upgraded special items, that are supposed to be indicative of the potential these players could reach. There have been some legendary Ultimate Team items released over the years, including Erling Haaland in FIFA 20, Jude Bellingham's item in FIFA 22's Future Stars promo and Julian Alvarez's item in FIFA 23's Future Stars promo.\nHere's when the EA FC 24 Future Stars promo will launch, a round-up of the latest leaks, our predictions for the squad and the confirmed card design.\nREAD MORE: Palworld patch notes for update v0.1.4.1 detail disappearing weapons fix and less crashingREAD MORE: Xbox Game Pass February 2024 games include one of the best Metroidvanias of the generationEA FC 24 Future Stars: confirmed release date\nThe EA FC 24 Future Stars release date is Friday, February 9, with EA confirming the release date via a new loading screen that appears in Ultimate Team. This date is when the RTTF squad will leave packs and Future Stars will begin. Most major EA FC 24 Ultimate Team promos launch on a Friday, including TOTY, Winter Wildcards and TOTGS amongst others.\nWe expect EA FC 24 Future Stars will have two promo teams, with EA FC 24 Future Stars Team 1 expected to launch on Friday, February 9 and EA FC 24 Future Stars Team 2 on Friday, February 16.\nEA FC 24 Future Stars: card design\nThe EA FC 24 Future Stars card design has been confirmed via a new Ultimate Team loading screen, with the item featuring a purple, blue and gold design, with some silver and white featuring in the background. The loading screen also confirms the card design for Future Stars Icons. It's definitely one of the boldest and most exciting card designs we've seen in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team so far, on par with the TOTY promo.\nIt also appears that the PlayStyle Plus logo may also be blue to match the bottom of the item, which is a nice touch.\nEA FC 24 Future Stars: leaks\nAs with every EA FC 24 Ultimate Team promo, several players who are set to feature have seemingly been leaked ahead of the official announcement.
