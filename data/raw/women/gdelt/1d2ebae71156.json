I watched the first leg match, and I was really\nimpressed by the mental strength coach Juma instilled in the girls.\nMost of the players graduated from the U17 side, which took part in the 2024 World Cup in the Dominican Republic, and that speaks volumes on the chemistry of\ncoach Juma and Mildred Cheche.”\n“According to my vast experience in women’s football, this is a big\nstage, and having the advantage of the first leg, the ladies need to focus and have\nmental strength.\n\"Tanzania will have the advantage of playing at home, and as I know\nthem, they will play attacking football, so our defense needs to be stiff.\"\n\"I can’t go deep on the tactical approach because the coach\nis the one who knows the players better according to the training they have\ndone.\n“I saw some section of fans calling on the coach to bring in Emily\nMoranga early, but she is the one who understands well her fitness.\n“Let’s give coach Juma space to lead the team and I’m sure we\nswill beat Tanzania and go on to qualify for the World Cup.”\nThe Starlets arrived in Dar es Salaam on Monday, February 10, and are\npreparing for the mouthwatering clash.\nA win over Tanzania would set Kenya up for a tougher next\nassignment against either Botswana or continental heavyweights Cameroon, with\nthe winners earning a ticket to the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup finals in\nPoland from September 5 to 27, 2027.",
