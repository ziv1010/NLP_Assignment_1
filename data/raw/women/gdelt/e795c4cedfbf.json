  "body_text": "Mikaela Shiffrin and Peyton Manning are among the high-profile and Colorado-rooted names on the new Denver NWSL franchise’s finalized ownership roster, which was revealed on Thursday.\nLed by controlling owner Rob Cohen, the full group reflects the club’s emphasis on local identity, with several investors hailing from Colorado or having close ties to the state.\nThe creators of the For Denver FC movement, the grassroots effort which eventually produced the winning bid for the NWSL’s 16th franchise, were added to the ownership group. In 2022, the vision was captured by Jordan Angeli, Ben Hubbard, Tom Dunmore and Nicole Glaros, who will now own a stake in the club they helped bring to life.\n“It’s an honor to be joined by such an accomplished and passionate group of individuals,” Cohen said in a news release announcing the full ownership group. “Each investor brings a unique perspective and deep commitment to supporting women’s sports. Together, we’re building something that will reflect the values and spirit of Colorado and have a lasting impact in our community.”\nDenver NWSL’s full ownership group\nRob Cohen: Controlling owner.\nProject Level/Mellody Hobson: Subsidiary company of Ariel Investments, led by Hobson, Denver NWSL’s Alternate Governor.\nBorgen/Moritz families: Jon-Erik Borgen and Kaia Borgen Moritz, Colorado-based investors through FirstTracks Sports Ventures LLC.\nNeelima Joshi and Dhiren Jhaveri: Joshi, a Colorado native and finance professional; Jhaveri, founder and CEO of Kuvare Holdings.\nMolly Coors: Colorado native, serves on the Young Guns Committee for the National Western Stock Show.\nMikaela Shiffrin: Colorado native and world-class alpine skier.

The 14,500-seat venue, with room and plans for future expansion with the FIFA Women’s World Cup coming to the U.S. in 2031, is planned to be completed in time for the 2028 NWSL season.\nThe team’s first two seasons will be played at a temporary venue in Centennial, where a state-of-the-art training facility tailored to women’s sports will eventually house the Denver NWSL team permanently for day-to-day practice.\nWant more sports news?
