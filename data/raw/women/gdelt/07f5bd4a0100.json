Dr. Tessman has verbally accepted the position and is set to assume office on July 1, 2025, pending final employment contract negotiations and formal approval by the Board of Regents at its May meeting.\nThis decision is a significant milestone in a process that began in August 2024, when current MSU President Waded Cruzado announced her plans to retire after 15 years of transformative leadership. Her administration has left an indelible mark on the university and the MSU community.\n“As a proud MSU alumnus and member of the Search Advisory Committee, I knew our charge was not to replace President Cruzado, but to identify a successor who could lead the institution into the future with the same level of passion and dedication,” said Regent Dean Folkvord. “I think we succeeded, and I look forward to working with Dr. Tessman as he takes the reins.”\nDr. Tessman brings a wealth of experience and vision to his new role. Currently serving as the 17th president of Northern Michigan University (NMU), he has led numerous successful initiatives since assuming the position in February 2023. His accomplishments include steady enrollment growth at both undergraduate and graduate levels, record retention rates (78%), financial stability with top-tier bond ratings, unprecedented levels of private giving, and the completion of major capital projects. Dr. Tessman’s stewardship has fostered positive momentum across all aspects of university operations.\nPrior to his presidency at NMU, Dr. Tessman held several prominent roles within higher education, including Deputy Commissioner for Academic Affairs in the Montana University System and Dean of the Davidson Honors College at the University of Montana. He earned his bachelor’s degree in international relations from Brown University and both his master’s and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Colorado at Boulder.\nDr. Tessman is known for his energy, dedication to students, strong communication skills, and ability to deliver results—qualities that make him uniquely suited to lead MSU into its next chapter.\n“Montana State University holds a special place in my heart given my previous work within the Montana University System,” Dr. Tessman said. “I am honored by this opportunity to serve as MSU’s next president and look forward to building on its incredible legacy.”\nClayton Christian, Commissioner of Higher Education and chair of the Presidential Search Advisory Committee, said “The Committee was fortunate to see intense interest in the position. I’m grateful to the members of the committee for their time, attention, and thoughtful dedication to the search process. I’m confident the process has yielded an outstanding, visionary leader in Dr. Tessman. We believe Dr. Tessman is exceptionally well positioned to guide MSU to new heights.”\nThe Board of Regents and Commissioner Christian welcome Dr. Tessman back to Montana and to Bozeman at the helm of MSU.\nAbout Montana State\nMontana State University was founded in 1893 as the land-grant university of Montana. Today, MSU is the largest university in the state and region with more than 17,000 students and more than 250 areas of study, including certificates, bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, doctorates and more.\nIn addition to the Bozeman campus, Montana State has an embedded two-year program, Gallatin College MSU, and three affiliated campuses: MSU Billings, MSU Northern in Havre and Great Falls College MSU.\nAs Montana's land-grant institution, MSU is an active partner in the state's educational and economic development agenda; its seven research centers under the Montana Agricultural Experiment Station, 55 MSU Extension offices, Fire Services Training School and public service programs reach every county of the state, as well as seven tribal reservations.\nMontana State has set multiple student enrollment records over the past 15 years, becoming one of the fastest-growing universities in the nation and, by far, the largest university in the state and the largest university in a four-state region\nMontana State University enrollment has increased 26% from 13,565 in 2010 to 17,144 in the fall of 2024. During this period the ACT and SAT scores and GPA of MSU students also rose to record levels. MSU has led the state in terms of gains in student retention and graduation rates.\nIn 2024, Montana State's retention rate hit its highest mark in more than 30 years of modern record keeping at 78.4%. MSU's four-year and five-year graduation rates also set modern records in 2024 at 40.8% and 54.9% respectively.\nMSU students consistently stand out as recipients of prestigious national awards. Over the past 15 years, the university has produced three Rhodes Scholars, two Gates-Cambridge Scholars, two Marshall Scholars, five Schwarzman Scholars, nine Truman Scholars and 13 Udall Scholars, among many other impressive student recognitions. With 90 Goldwater Scholars, Montana State is among the nation's top recipients of the prestigious scholarship for students who demonstrate excellence in math, science and engineering.\nAs the state's land-grant university, MSU's mission is to integrate education, the creation of knowledge and art, and service to communities. As part of that mission, MSU maintains the largest research operation of any type in the state of Montana.

MSU is also part of multiple statewide and regional initiatives, including NSF EPSCoR, the Montana Space Grant and Western Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education.\nAdditionally, MSU operates its Core Facilities, which are spaces across campus designed to facilitate access to cutting-edge technology across multiple disciplines and research areas. These include facilities specializing in mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, cyberinfrastructure, social data collection, microfabrication, chemical analysis, geospatial science, biofilms and more.\nAs the state's land-grant university, Montana State University is the proud home of MSU Extension. With 96 MSU Extension agents and 26 subject matter experts, MSU Extension serves local needs in 56 counties and seven reservations. MSU Extension improves lives and communities across Montana by providing unbiased, research-based education in youth and community leadership, agriculture, horticulture, healthy living, estate planning, youth development, and more.\nProgram highlights include:\n- Reimaging Rural: This program to help invigorate rural communities with discussion and action.\n- Montana 4-H: Montana 4-H reaches more than 17,000 youth from every county and reservation in the state with more than 3,100 trained and certified volunteers.\n- Drought Response: In response to severe drought in 2021 and 2022, MSU Extension provided 55 teaching seminars across the state educating agricultural producers and communities about drought.\n- Local Government Center: The MSU Extension Local Government Center strengthens the capacities of local governmental units and provides training, technical assistance and research services to elected, appointed and administrative officials.\n- Mental Health First Aid: Since 2020, MSU Extension instructors trained 246 adults and youth in mental health first aid.\nMSU has seen the completion of numerous major construction and renovation projects in recent years. Those include the state-funded renovation and repurposing of historic Romney Hall. Opened in the fall of 2021, the century-old Romney went from a disused facility to one of the most heavily used classroom buildings on campus, seating more than 1,000 students each hour.\nOther highlights include the 2015 opening of Jabs Hall; the 2018 opening of Norm Asbjornson Hall, an innovative classroom and laboratory facility that is home of the Norm Asbjornson College of Engineering and the Honors College.

Currently under construction is the Kennedy-Stark Indoor Athletic Center.\nMSU has opened multiple new residence halls in recent years, including the 510-bed Hyalite Hall in 2020, the 400-bed Yellowstone Hall in 2016 and the 72-bed Gallatin Hall in 2013. The Langford and Hapner student residence halls also received significant renovations in 2015.\nIn 2018, the university's new Rendezvous Dining Pavilion opened, and in the fall of 2015, MSU reopened the renovated Miller Dining Commons. The MSU Library, Brick Breeden Fieldhouse and Strand Union Building also saw renovations and modernizations, and in 2017 MSU opened a 550-space parking garage.\nMontana State University has a long and proud history of athletic competition and support for its 350-plus student-athletes both on and off the field, a formula for success rooted in MSU's commitment to excellence, progress and growth.\nThe past few years have proven to be the greatest period of success in MSU Bobcat history, including 2021-22, which was dubbed the Year of the Bobcat. That year saw Bobcat football compete for the national championship; both men and women's basketball earn conference tournament titles; and men's tennis finish as regular season champions.\nIn 2022-23, the university claimed its third Big Sky Conference President's Cup in recognition for the best combined success in athletics and academics. MSU also earned its second straight Big Sky Conference Men's All-Sports Trophy, and, for the seventh year in a row, took home the Brawl of the Wild Series trophy in recognition of victories over MSU's in-state rivals.\nIn the past two academic years, out of 23 opportunities, MSU athletics teams finished in the top three of the Big Sky Conference's standings 21 times. The 2021-22 academic year marked the third time in history an athletic program finished in the top three of the Big Sky standings in every sport in which it participated, and two of those seasons belonged to MSU.\nOther recent athletics highlights include:\n- MSU again in 2022-23 captured the men's basketball tournament championship and earned its first-ever back-to-back NCAA tournament appearance.
