This was highlighted through Lewis Freeman's nice ball into the Raiders box with no one positioned there to collect and shoot it.\nSimilarly, that happened to the Raiders in the 17th minute as Charlie Budge flicked off a well-crafted backheel pass into the attacking area, but no one saw it coming and was swamped on by Lilli Pilli's defence.\nSeconds later the play switched up and Ben Bonner went agonisingly close to opening the scoring as he drew his strike inches wide of the post.\nBoth sides continued to fire off chances before the end of the half with Dylan Pisani miskicking the ball in the 35th minute for Lilli Pilli before Bailey Smith picked up the ball and forced an awkward save out of Alex Jones.\nThe second half went bang in the 56th minute as Lewis Freeman collided with the opposition and caused his marking Man to smash into the nearby fencing. Thankfully he was ok. Freeman again involved minutes later colliding with his opposing Raider.\nFifteen-minutes later normalcy resumed as Pisani and Bonner teased the Raiders with a series of tasty passes close to their box as they looked to forge a winner.\nThen with three-minutes from fulltime remaining Liam Skyes out of nowhere blasted the ball from just inside the halfway line, past a backtracking Jones and into the back of the net. His super strike delivering his side the Grand Final victory.\nThe Raiders retaliated almost immediately with a late flurry of chances, but it wasn't to be in their gutting defeat, including failing to capitalise from a corner kick with one-minute remaining.\nThe Lilli Pilli FC team: Taine Wihare, Jay Robinson, Hugo Cox, Lewis Freeman, Zayne Pisani, Jackson Steege, Byron Lynn, Solomon Freeman, William Crowe, Dylan Pisani, Jack Lillie, Liam Skyes, Jack Pryor, Marcus Barsoom, Ben Bonner, Nicholas Benfield, Xavier Dinuccio, Bailey Smith.",
