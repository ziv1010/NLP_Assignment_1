In an effort to counter the outdated male stereotypes that come with the term hardcore fan, were focusing on the true face of modern football fandom across mens and womens UEFA competitions, because women can be just as positively obsessed with the beautiful game.\nPutting true fans front and centre this season, we have developed the Real Hardcore Fan Club to share heartwarming and often outlandish stories of passionate fans that challenge the status quo to make football more inclusive for all. From nuns singing for their team on Sundays, to pets (and people!) named after football legends, the hardcore fans arent all who youd think.\n[i\"It makes me so happy to see womens football growing at the rate it is, the increase in female players, the massive number of female fans and the public view of the sport changing. Thats why I love how Heineken® is using their weight in the football world to drive positive change making the space inclusive for all fans, no matter who they are\"[/i]\nJILL SCOTT MBE, FORMER LIONESS AND HEINEKEN® FOOTBALL AMBASSADOR\nTo support the rallying cry for inclusivity within football, Heineken® has been leveraging its 30+ years partnership with UEFA to help level the playing field for all football fans by tackling the issues that prevent them from having an enjoyable, inclusive experience.\nSince becoming a sponsor of the UEFA Womens Champions League in 2021, we have looked to continually challenge stereotypes and exclusionary behaviour that says football is for men only, from our 2023 campaign Cheers To All Fans Men Included to this years \"Cheers To The Real Hardcore Fans.\nTo support this message Heineken® created The Social Swap which highlighted and addressed gender bias in football by tackling online toxicity. We asked ex-players and pundits, Jill Scott MBE and Gary Neville to switch social accounts in secret to prove they were being judged unfairly on their opinion because of their gender.\n[i\"Its a real privilege to present campaigns that champion womens football and celebrate the diverse group of people who call themselves hardcore fans. Were proud to help drive one of the fastest growing sports of today, and well continue to break down stereotypes to show there is a place at the game for everyone who lives and breathes the sport\"[/i]\nNABIL NASSER, GLOBAL HEAD OF HEINEKEN® BRAND\n( Press Release Image: https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/322309/322309-1.jpg )\nWebWireID322309\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.
