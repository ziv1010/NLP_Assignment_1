These schools aim to nurture broad-minded personalities in a stress-free environment, empowering children from underprivileged backgrounds. The inspiration behind this exceptional initiative is Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, a globally acclaimed spiritual leader and humanitarian. He profoundly believes, \"Education is civilisation's greatest leveler. It has the power to empower the weakest of the weak, bring peace to the world, and alleviate poverty. It is often seen as the only lit path in the pursuit of happiness.\"\nBuilding on this vision, Smt. Bhanumathi Narasimhan, Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's sister, has been instrumental in establishing and expanding undertakings aimed at offering free education to children in need. Her compassionate leadership has positively impacted countless children's lives, contributing significantly to realising a more equitable and harmonious society.\nThe journey began in 1981 with the inauguration of the first school in rural Bengaluru, catering to 30 children. Over the past 42 years, this initiative has flourished, and there are now 1,262 schools across 22 states in India, providing comprehensive education to over 1,00,000 children.\nKey Highlights:\n* 100% Results: The schools boast a remarkable 100% pass rate, with zero dropouts and over 90% attendance.\n* Comprehensive Support: Students benefit from midday meals, medical camps, well-equipped libraries, bicycles, school buses, books, computer labs, sports equipment, and stationery.\n* Holistic Development: Daily practices of yoga, pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya (a world famous breathwork), and meditation foster physical and mental well-being, along with strong values and life skills.\n* Community Development Initiatives: Health and hygiene awareness camps and regular communication with parents help encourage a positive environment for children.\n* Empowering Teachers: Teachers are trained to be community leaders and change agents, ensuring sustainable development.\nImpact Stories:\nFirst-Gen Success: Manu Singh Scores 92.4%, Stands 4th in District Exams\nManu Singh, a standout student from The Art of Living Free School in Khunti, secured 4th position in the 2024 district exams with an impressive 92.4% in Class X.
