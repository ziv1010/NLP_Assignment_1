  "body_text": "Brighton fans comments ahead of this Newcastle United match – Intriguing\nBrighton fans travel to St James’ Park on Saturday.\nThe reverse fixture was a 3-1 defeat for NUFC in September, Newcastle’s second away game of the season.\nThat seems an awful long time ago now.\nLast May, Brighton fans travelled to Arsenal and watched their team win 3-0, only to then come up to St James’ Park and view a 4-1 hammering, that all but ensured Champions League football for Eddie Howe’s side.\nBrighton fans loved it last season when their team ended the season sixth on 62 points, though this season a reality check, currently in eleventh place on 47 points.\nSo what is the mood like as the Seagulls prepare to take flight to Tyneside (avoiding Wearside…) from the south coast?\nBrighton fans commenting via their North Stand Chat forum:\n‘Do we have a Dan Ashworth sell-on clause?’\n‘Never done this fixture, are there any particular pubs that are worth a visit?’\n‘It really depends what you’re after, whether it is a bar-type place, modern pub or something more old school. There are something like 100 bars/pubs to drink in within the immediate vicinity of the ground, so there’s plenty of choice.\nMy choice personally would be the Lady Greys or the Crown Posada.’\n‘You’re spoilt for pubs in Newcastle:\nTown Mouse\nCrown Pasada\nSplit Chimp\nBacchus…\n… and so many more (but there are some serious hills in Newcastle so the Away End is just a warm up for that! The quayside is good for a bite to eat.\nPre-match I’ll be in the Newcastle Arms in Chinatown which is a short walk to SJP and away friendly with decent ales.’\n‘A potentially meaningless mid table league game at a ground far in the north, where based on current form we likely wont win, and we still take 2000+. Yes very decent effort.’\n‘Anyone know what the view is like from LL7K?’\n‘I’m sitting there it’s a good view.’\n‘I see the league finally taken action for the away fans being stuck in the gods.\nThey’ve chucked Gateshead out of the play offs.’\n‘We’ll have around 2000 there which is pretty decent.\nI know the away end is high up but I love going there.\nIt’s a football mad place and the stadium is smack in the city centre. Looking forward to it.’\n‘A long weekend in Newcastle and Northumbria, I’m sure the missus wants to take in the football as well.’\n‘Might actually be able to use the lift this year!’\n‘I’ve managed to get in the past three times – it’s an absolute game changer.’\n‘It’s quite random.. never used/offered it before, then last year, staggered in, and a Hi-Viz clad lady said ‘anyone want to use the lift..?’ – Quick look about, not aimed at a OAP, thought she mis-aged me, but took it in good grace and zoom, onto concourse.. Will Def ask for it next time..!’\n‘Slightly mixed feelings about the Newcastle and Man United games as priority number one is making sure Chelsea don’t finish in the top 6!’\n‘All about confidence as soon as we scored and that was lucky only ever going to be one winner. Amazing what a win can do it’s like these teams at the bottom that can’t buy a win they don’t believe they will win and they hardly ever do. Hopefully we can get some revenge on Newcastle now.’\n‘Got a Newcastle ticket and travel, going on my own, so if they go 2 up I can leave.’\n‘I personally know supporters of Spurs, Arsenal and Newcastle who are Albion members, they can’t stand the Albion. They get to see their expensively bought heroes once a season.’\n‘The only thing we’ll get at Newcastle is a repeat of last year’s stuffing.’\n‘Are there still massed demonstrations against the Newcastle United ownership? (Indeed were there any?)\nI think football fans are football fans and ultimately as people we’re no more holy and righteous.’\n‘I genuinely can not understand any women who supports Newcastle not protesting to get rid of these owners from the club.’\n‘Newcastle CANNOT spend the Saudi dollars they have despite their huge ground, regular TV games and international profile. Forest spent more on transfers…’\n‘My liver is dreading Newcastle away. Doing that day sober doesn’t bear thinking about.’\n‘I was chatting to a couple of Newcastle fans in the pub recently.\nThey were so much more enthusiastic about De Zerbi and how we play than me that it was embarrassing (I guess they haven’t paid too much attention to our results over the last few months and aren’t to bothered by them anyway…).’\n‘Top of my list for being the friendliest fans are Liverpool and Newcastle fans – always complimentary and helpful. On the other side of the coin I have found, like many, Man Utd and Tottenham fans the most arrogant.’\n‘Worst by far i’ve experienced was Man United. So many incredibly arrogant fans, so many of them getting in Albion fans faces trying to start arguments / fights.\nCompare that to Newcastle at home last September after we’d beaten them. Geordies came out of the away end and walked up the steps to the coach park – singing with big smiles on their faces about Europe. No negative horrible stuff about getting beat. I walked up the steps in the middle of a bunch of them and haven’t had as many handshakes, high fives and hugs from away fans before.’\n‘There is a rule that states away fans must be in contact with the pitch.\nWhen this became a rule Newcastle claimed that there was nowhere safe in their stadium to have the away fans in contact with the pitch that didn’t create issue with their entrance/exit to the stadium being near an entrance/exit for home fans.\nThey claimed it would create safety issues so it was agreed that they didn’t have to adhere to this rule. But in my opinion, even if that was a correct decision at the time, surely they’ve now had years to fix the issue and make alterations to stadium exits.\nEspecially considering they are now the richest club in the world. It gives them that extra bit of home advantage that others clubs don’t.’\n‘Your opinion is shared by most PL executives from what I’ve heard…’\n‘I will never go to Newcastle again as the view from the away section isn’t acceptable.’\n‘Your opinion, I don’t mind the view at SJP.’\n‘Hope that when they build their new stadium they are forced to give the away supporters the seats they should have now.’\n‘The view isn’t that that bad (there are many worse) and you are missing out on what is, for me, the best of away days.’\n‘Yes, its a great stadium but the away fans are an after thought. Maybe next time they come to Sussex we should put their fans at Withdean and give them binoculars. Worst Prem stadium to visit purely as an away fan. You might as well be on the moon.’\n‘I think this away is brilliant.’\n‘Yes I love it too – better than West Ham IMO.’\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
