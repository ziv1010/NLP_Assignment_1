She was originally invited to train with the Tolka Park outfit by then-manager Noel King, who she previously played for at Stella Maris.\n𝗧𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗸 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗝𝗲𝗺𝗺𝗮 ❤️\n— Shelbourne FC (@shelsfc) October 5, 2025\nAfter four amazing years with the Reds, Jemma Quinn has announced retirement from League of Ireland football ⚽️\nA huge thank you to Jemma from all at Shelbourne FC for what she brought to the club both on and off the pitch.

A special player and person,” a post on X reads. “Once a Red, always a Red.”\nA player who always gave 100% on the pitch 👊\n— LOI Women (@LoiWomen) October 5, 2025\nBest of luck to Shelbourne’s Jemma Quinn who retires from LOI football at the end of the season 👏 pic.twitter.com/rfnmDKOkjy\nQuinn is one of several veterans in the Shels ranks, with captain Pearl Slattery, Noelle Murray and Rachel Graham also representing the club with distinction through the years.\nShelbourne round out their season away to Shamrock Rovers next weekend: they will finish second after Athlone Town wrapped up back to back league titles midweek.\nAthlone’s unbeaten campaign, however, came to an end with a 1-0 defeat to Peamount United yesterday. Eleanor Ryan-Doyle scored the winner in the 87th minute at Greenogue.\nMeanwhile, Jessie Stapleton proved the only Irish goalscorer in the WSL and WSL 2 this weekend. The former Shels star turned home Nottingham Forest’s equaliser in their 4-1 win over Portsmouth in WSL 2.\nCourtney Brosnan missed her third game in succession for Everton with a knee injury, while Leanne Kiernan was again absent from the matchday squad as Liverpool’s nightmare start continued with a 1-0 defeat to newly-promoted London City Lionesses.\nReds boss Gareth Taylor expects Kiernan to return from a foot injury next weekend, in a boost for Ireland ahead of their Uefa Nations League promotion/relegation playoff against Belgium later this month.\nElsewhere in the WSL this weekend, defending champions Chelsea were held to a 1-1 draw at Manchester United, and Manchester City secured a 3-2 win late on against Arsenal.\nSaoirse Noonan (Celtic) and Jenna Slattery (Hearts) were both on target in Scotland, Amber Barrett (Standard Liége) bagged a goal in Belgium, and Denise O’Sullivan remains sidelined Stateside with a knee injury.",
