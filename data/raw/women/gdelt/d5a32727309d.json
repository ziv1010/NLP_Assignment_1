I couldn’t be prouder to be a tiny part of this massive, positive experience.”\nJake Fewell, 23, a chartered accountant from Essex on a six-month secondment in Sydney, told i he is looking forward to the “once in a lifetime” opportunity to see England play in a World Cup final, after he secured a batch of tickets at $80 (£45) each for himself and his colleagues.\nHe and his workmates decided to try to get tickets after watching the semi-final in the fan park at the Allianz Arena. When they saw a new batch was being released on Thursday, they “jumped at the chance and managed to get 14, the exact number we needed for us and the other Brits on secondment in our office”.\nHe has been following the Lionesses since the Euros final last year, when England won 2-1 against Germany, and has says “Australia has been a great host country that has really promoted the women’s game”.\n“Every Aussie and Pom – as the locals call us – I know has been gripped with World Cup fever,” he added. “There’s been a great atmosphere in Sydney throughout the whole tournament. It’s such a multicultural city and this tournament has been a great thing in common for so many people.”\nMr Fewell added that he is “excited but nervous” for the final match on Sunday, but asked for his prediction on the final score, said: “Got to be 3-0 to England, bring it home!”\nThe Aussie rooting for England\nIsabella Matti, a 19-year-old student from Sydney, has been trying to get tickets for the final, after being “absolutely wowed” by the tournament so far, and said she will be “rooting for England to win”.\n“I’ve been trying to message people through Twitter and Facebook but it’s just absolutely full of people attempting to scam others for money,” she told i. “So I’ve also been persistently refreshing the official Fifa ticketing site and hoping for the best.\n“A lot of people I’ve spoken to have had the same dilemma. This tournament has definitely introduced a whole new cohort of fans into not only football, but women’s football.\n“I feel like this has caused a lot of people to scramble for tickets last minute, as they’ve unexpectedly fallen in love with watching the games.”\nMs Matti said she was “lucky enough to attend the semi-final”, which she called a “fantastic game”, adding that she had “never heard a crowd roar as loud as when Sam Kerr scored that absolute banger” for Australia.\nAs a Chelsea supporter, she has been following women’s football at club level, and thinks it is “extraordinary” how the women’s game has “progressed into what it’s become today”.\n“I love watching many members of the squad individually: Alessia Russo, Ella Toone, Lauren James, Jess Carter… It’s such a nostalgic and sentimental feeling, one that I particularly remember when I was younger and watched men’s football.”\nShe said that “being a woman and watching other young women become so successful in an area that was previously dominated by men is just really beautiful to witness”.\n“I also think it’s important to remember that female footballers aren’t looking to be compared to men, rather, they are simply playing the game they grew up loving and enjoying,” she added.\nMs Matti said she is “buzzing” for the final, as “it’s such an incredible achievement for both teams”.\n“There is so much talent in amongst both squads and I genuinely don’t know how the game will end.\n“England did beat Spain during the European Championships last year, and they played some beautiful football against Australia too.\n“My heart says England will win and Russo will be on the score sheet. Then again though, Spain have Putellas and Bonmatí in their team, arguably some of the best players in the world.\n“However, I’m predicting a 2-1 win for England.”\nErin Bailey, 23, who has just finished university, decided while watching the semi-final to travel from her home in Palmerston, New Zealand, to Sydney on Saturday to see the final.\nShe told i that she “sat on the Fifa resale site for about two hours refreshing the page, and finally, when I was about to give up, one came up for NZ$120 (around £56)”. She is also paying NZ$918 (£460) for her flights, and will be flying back on Monday.\nMs Bailey said the Lionesses “have such a good bond” and she has been following them since the 2015 Women’s World Cup. “Seeing them play at that tournament made me fall in love with the style of play they used.”\nShe said it is “the biggest football match I have ever been to, so it’s going to be an absolutely insane experience.\n“I can’t wait to watch two world-class teams put on such a great game, and to see the best players in the world.\n“I think England will win but I believe it will go to penalties.”",
