  "body_text": "Someone wheeled a skateboard down the marble steps at Palais d’Iéna and nobody treated it like an oddity. At Y-3’s Autumn/Winter 2026 presentation, skate and speed culture rode off together with graffiti and Grand Prix attitude stitched into a wardrobe that wants to move.\nFor this outing, Yohji Yamamoto and Adidas pivoted from the pavement to the pit lane, unveiling a heavyweight collaboration with the Mercedes-Amg Petronas Formula One team. The show functioned as an immersive performance, with a wolfpack of dancers and a pit-crew of performers dressed in all-black tailored boiler suits who navigated a stage rigged with ramps and glowing Three Stripes.\nIn a move that had long-time fans doing a double-take, denim returned to the label for the first time in over a decade. This homecoming for the fabric was cemented by the presence of the legendary skateboarder Mark Gonzales, who stepped out in the Y-3 Nisi. As the brand’s first-ever fully vulcanised sneaker, it represents a gritty, functional bridge between Yamamoto’s poetic silhouettes and the physical demands of a kickflip.\nVisually, the collection felt like a deliberate clash of textures and eras. Long-standing collaborator Chikami Hayashi’s refined artwork was placed in a direct, almost combative dialogue with the transgressive artist Chito, whose signature spray-painted graphics mutated the iconic Three Stripes into something unrecognisable and feral. This ‘Beast’ motif – a creature that originally stalked the Yohji Yamamoto mainline runways – found a new home across prints and footwear, adding a touch of beautiful, monstrous surrealism to the technical performance-wear.\nThe footwear lineup continued to subvert the Adidas Archive with almost gleeful abandon. The Y-3 Tokyo Warped reimagined its namesake through a distorted lens, while the Y-3 Superstar 3G transformed the classic shell toe into an architectural statement, pairing a sleek, low-profile upper with an absolutely massive, exaggerated sole.\nThroughout the collection, the tailoring was built for a life in flux. Adaptive buttons and interchangeable details invite the wearer to tinker with the shape, making the clothes feel like an evolving uniform. Sporting jerseys emerged as a recurring pulse through the show, while traditional trenches and leather pieces were gutted and reworked to sit alongside high-spec technical layers.\nDiscover the collection here.\nphotography. courtesy of Y-3\nwords.
