So that's probably the big learning for us to come out of the season - to really understand what the players are going through off the pitch.\"\nEngland's WSL became a full-time professional league in the 2018/19 season, which the PFA said \"kicked off a virtuous cycle of attracting elite talent, fan interest, and corporate support\".\nFor example, this year Arsenal Women's team had an average attendance of more than 30,000, which puts it in the top half of English Premier League clubs.\nWhere Riley did differ to her Australian counterparts is in whether the ALW should expand.\nThe 2023-24 season was the first with 12 clubs and a full home-and-away schedule of 22 rounds.\nNone of the surveyed Matildas saw more ALW teams as a priority, whereas Riley wanted greater representation on this side of the Tasman.\n\"There is hopes that there will be an addition to the league, another New Zealand team ... with having so many different pathways to the national team now to add this where growing up in New Zealand and playing professionally in New Zealand and making the national team that adds another way to get to the world stage and is something young girls would really identify with,\" Riley said during the World Cup.\nAuckland FC will join the men's A-League for the upcoming season, with the club saying a team would join the ALW for the 2024-25 season.",
