One of the biggest wins in Coach Sue’s career was a 71-69 road win at No. 4 Duke on Feb. 8, 2001, in a game where Wyckoff scored 20 points, had eight rebounds as well as five steals in what was a landmark win for an up-and-coming program at the time.\n- Sunday’s Top 25 matchup between No. 16 Duke and No. 24 FSU is the first one at the Tucker Center since FSU took down then-No. 19 Michigan State, 78-68, on Dec. 5, 2019.\n- Sophomore forward Makayla Timpson is making a strong case for All-ACC First Team. The Edison, Ga., native ranks in the Top 2 in the ACC in rebounding (2nd), field goal percentage (1st), blocked shots (1st) and offensive rebounds (1st).\n- Graduate forward Valencia Myers is tied at fourth in school history with 135 career games played.

Timpson owns 16 blocks in just her last three games.\n- FSU has won six of its last eight meetings against Duke. The Blue Devils lead the all-time series, 38-14, with Sunday being the 53rd meeting in series history.\n- Sunday’s game matches the ACC’s best scoring offense in FSU (84.1 ppg) vs. the league’s best scoring defense in Duke (51.2 points allowed). The Seminoles have scored 70+ points in 22 of their 23 games, while Duke has allowed 70+ points just once this season (78 by UConn).\n- Ta’Niya Latson continues leading the country with 145 made free throws.

Timpson’s 10 double-doubles are six shy of moving past Howard’s 15 from the 2013-14 season.\n- Sunday’s Coach Sue Celebration vs. Duke is also Alumni Weekend, where the Seminoles are expected to have around 50 Alumni back in the building.\n- Duke (+17.5) and Florida State (+17.1) rank second and third, respectively, in the ACC in scoring margin.\n—\n- Women’s Basketball To Celebrate Coach Sue on Sunday\nFlorida State Women’s Basketball coaching legend Sue Semrau will be celebrated this Sunday afternoon as part of the 24th-ranked Seminoles’ big matchup against No. 16 Duke at 2 p.m. at the Tucker Center.\nSemrau, who announced her retirement last March after 25 great years with the Seminoles, will return for a Coach Sue Celebration where she will be honored for her incredible work on and off the court. In 1997, Semrau took over an FSU program that had fallen on tough times and built it into a perennial contender, earning three NCAA Elite Eight appearances in 2010, 2015 and 2017.\n“We are looking forward to hosting this recognition for a very special person in Coach Sue,” FSU Vice President and Director of Athletics Michael Alford said. “I know the many loyal supporters of our program will enjoy this opportunity to express their appreciation for her contributions to the program.”\nA public event in the Tucker Center’s Exhibition Hall will be held for Semrau from 12:30-1:30 p.m. on Sunday, ending a half hour before tipoff. Doors to Sunday’s game will open earlier than usual at 12:15 p.m. Fans who purchase a ticket to Sunday’s Top 25 matchup also gain access to the public event that celebrates the Seminole Legend.\n“There isn’t a bigger mentor in my life than Coach Sue,” said current head coach Brooke Wyckoff, who played and coached under Semrau. “So much of what I’ve learned as a player and person, from understanding concepts of the game to treating others with the utmost respect, is a credit to what she has taught me. Sunday’s celebration is just a small appreciation for someone who has not only impacted my life, but so many others as well.”\nThe history of Florida State Women’s Basketball found its upward trajectory under the coaching of Semrau. She was the National Coach of the Year in 2015, a four-time ACC Coach of the Year, guided the Seminoles to 16 NCAA Tournament appearances and became the all-time winningest coach in program history with 492 victories.\nAs much as she won games and impacted lives on the court, her off-court endeavors were remarkable as well. She was honored as the 2013 Kay Yow Heart of a Coach Award recipient, and was recognized by Samaritan’s Feet as the 2018 Barefoot Coach of the Year. Semrau is a staple in the Big Bend community, visiting schools, hospitals and taking part in so many other initiatives over the years.\nThe Coach Sue Celebration also ties into Alumni Weekend, which was always a popular event during Semrau’s time as head coach because she forged such strong connections with her former players. Nearly 50 FSU Women’s Basketball Alumni are expected in attendance and will be recognized during halftime.\nDuring Sunday’s FSU-Duke game, Semrau will also be celebrated on the court in between the first and second quarters of play.\nFans can purchase tickets to Sunday’s home game by visiting seminoles.com/tickets.\n—\nNo. 24 Florida State (18-5, 7-3 ACC) fell to no. 7 Notre Dame (17-2, 8-1 ACC) by a 70-47 score tonight in South Bend, IN.\nGame Recap\nBoth teams struggled offensively in the first quarter.

In spite of a hard-fought battle from the Seminoles, they were slightly outperformed, leading to an 82-81 loss.....{continued *FOR FREE}\n—\nComing off a 2-0 road trip that saw FSU scorch the nets, fans were hopeful the good times would keep rolling against the rival Miami Hurricanes. But in a reversal of roles, it was Florida State who couldn’t throw the ball in the ocean while standing on a boat and the ‘Canes who caught fire early and stayed hot throughout. Add pure domination on the glass from Miami and the result was a lopsided loss for the Seminoles, 86-63.\nThis was the first time....{continued *FOR FREE}\n—\n- Scottie Barnes has been playing at an all-star level the last two weeks:\n—\nThis is the place we’ve set up for our members to discuss the Florida State Seminoles men’s basketball for any breaking news, recruiting, players eligible for the NBA Draft, and any other basketball related news you may want to bring up for discussion....{Continued *FOR FREE}\nIt has been about two weeks since Florida State fell to North Carolina in the first national semifinal game.

Anderson placed second in the Maui Jim Intercollegiate with an 11-under 195 to open the fall, and also tied for sixth (OFCC/Fighting Illini Invitational), eighth (Folds of Honor Collegiate) and 13th (Jackson T. Stephens Cup) at FSU’s other fall tournaments.)\nAnderson’s aggregate three-round score of 195 at the Maui Jim Intercollegiate was the lowest in program history.\nAnderson is also on the 2022 Fall Haskins Award Watch List, emerging as one of the nation’s better collegiate golfers.

Clanton proved to be a top recruit out of Hialeah, Fla., for Florida State, improving his game dramatically from his first tournament as a Seminole to his most recent.\nClanton made his collegiate debut as a Florida State Seminole in the team’s first tournament of the fall season at the Maui Jim Intercollegiate. He continued to play in all four of Florida State’s fall competitions, increasingly lowering his scores and finishes as the season progressed on.\nThe Jackson T. Stephen’s Cup was a turning point for Clanton. After shooting 2-under par for the tournament and beating individual champion, David Ford, in match play, Clanton continued to play in numerous events over the offseason where he posted groundbreaking scores.\nThe South Florida native returned home for winter break where he competed in the 2022 South Beach International Amateur at Miami Beach Golf Club. With a tournament field just as strong as the Stephens Cup, Clanton posted a four day total of 17-under par with rounds of 67-68-65-66 (266) to be crowned champion of the prestigious tournament.\nHis commitment to the offseason grind continued into the New Year, competing with other fellow Seminoles in the Jones Cup Invitational at Ocean Forest Golf Club in Sea Island, Georgia. Although his opening round of 3-over was unfamiliar, he persevered with an even-par score for round two, followed by a final round of two-under par.\nThe freshman is expected to help lead the No. 13 Golfstat ranked Seminoles in a record-breaking spring season.\nLuke Clanton was not the only Seminole to have impressive off-season results. Junior Gray Albright joined Clanton in the South Beach International Amateur, posting his own low four day total of 1-under par with rounds of 71-70-70-71 (282).\nAlbright returned to the 60’s at the Orlando International Amateur Championship after firing an opening round of 69, followed by rounds of 75 and 72 to finish the tournament T36.\nFrederik Kjettrup competed alongside Clanton in the Jones Cup Invitational, shooting rounds of 76-73-69 to finish T21 at 2-over par. His best performance of the fall season was at the Jackson T. Stephens Cup, placing T10 with a 5-under finish (69-68-73).\nBrett Roberts looks to repeat another phenomenal season after carding the lowest scores of his collegiate career in the fall. The third-year Seminole has been a prominent staple for Florida State since his freshman year, pulling in ten top-10 finishes and one win as an individual over nearly three seasons.\nRoberts’ most recent success was at the Jackson T. Stephens Cup, placing third with rounds of 69-68-68 (205) to total 11-under par for the tournament.\nCole Anderson earned a spot on the 2022 Haskins Award Watch list after leading the Seminoles with a 69.08 scoring average in the fall season. The redshirt junior carded more than ten rounds at par or better in the four tournaments played last semester, including a career-low 64 at the Maui Jim Intercollegiate.\nThe Haskins Award honors the top collegiate male golfer and is awarded annually on behalf of selections made by college golfers, coaches, and members of the media. Anderson looks to join past Fred Haskins Award winners such as Tiger Woods, Phil Mickleson, Ben Crenshaw, Justin Thomas, and former Seminole John Pak who was the 2021 award recipient.\nFlorida State will host their spring season kick off with the Watersound Invitational at Sharks Tooth Golf Club in Panama City Beach on February 19th-21st.

Sandercock is 79-8 as a starter for the Garnet and Gold and posted an impressive 30-3 record last season while holding a 1.44 ERA.\nLeonard returns as the Noles’ top hitter as she led the team in both batting average (.375) and hits (66).

And whether a molecule is a lefty or a righty directly affects how they behave and their use in everything from drug design to flavoring foods.\nA Florida State University research team led by Associate Professor of Chemistry Ken Hanson previously found a way to turn “left-handed” molecules into “right-handed” ones by using light to induce a proton transfer and the transformation into a different isomer. Now, Hanson and his fellow FSU Professor of Chemistry Eugene DePrince are harnessing the power of math and computers to predict what would happen if you performed that same process in a gap between closely spaced mirrors.\nThe results, published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry A, suggests that scientists could use these cavities to control the degree of the change in handedness, also referred to as chirality.\nThe understanding and control of chirality, the property of asymmetry in molecules, is of particular importance for pharmaceuticals, fragrances, food additives and more. Using the wrong-handed molecule can have severe consequences.\n—\nThe Tomahawk Nation podcast channel, presented by SB Nation, features insider Seminoles recruiting, football, basketball, baseball, softball, and soccer analysis and commentary, featuring shows hosted by staff writers Tim Alumbaugh, Matt Minnick, Michael Rogner, Brian Pellerin, and Ben Meyerson, featuring contributions by Joshua Pick, David Stout, Jon Marchant, Max Escarpio and the entire Tomahawk Nation staff, produced by managing editor Perry Kostidakis....{continued *FOR FREE}",
