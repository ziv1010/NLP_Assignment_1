  "body_text": "The College Football Playoff is the perfect opportunity for aspiring NFL players to raise their profiles, and few have done so quite as effectively as University of Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss.\nThe Rebels entered the 2025 postseason as the No. 6 seed, but with plenty of attention on them due to former coach Lane Kiffin’s controversial decision to leave the team and take the head coaching job at LSU.\nAfter beating Tulane in the first round, Ole Miss avenged its only loss of the season by defeating the University of Georgia, 39-34, on January 1, 2026. Chambliss was a magician in that game, throwing for 362 yards and deftly and routinely avoiding the Bulldogs’ defense to cover extra ground.\n“My emotions right now, it’s crazy right now,” Chambliss said after the game, per the Clarion Ledger. “Really speechless, honestly, about everything, because it was that same point, we were down nine − or they were down nine the last time we played them, so it was kind of like roles reversed.”\nIt’s clear that Chambliss, who even diehard SEC fans were unfamiliar with at the beginning of the year, is on a professional trajectory. Keep scrolling for everything to know about the Rebels’ quarterback.\nTrinidad Chambliss Is Named After a Pro Boxer, Depending on Who You Ask\nTrinidad’s name has both religious and sports origins. His mom, Cheryl, is the daughter of a pastor, and had Trinidad been born a girl, his name would have been Trinity.\n“When people ask me, he is named after the Trinity,” she told ESPN in a 2025 interview.\nThat’s not how his dad, Trent, saw it. He wanted a name “that would stand out and was strong,” according to ESPN. One night, he was at a friend’s house watching Félix Trinidad fight and drew inspiration from his last name.\nTrinidad Chambliss Began His Career at Division II Ferris State\nUnlike most starting quarterbacks in the SEC, Trinidad wasn’t a highly touted recruit who came to college with high expectations. He began his career at Division II Ferris State, where he led the Bulldogs to the 2024 national championship. He entered the 2025 postseason with a chance to become the first player ever to win a Division II and FBS national championship — in consecutive years, no less.\nHe Was an All-State High School Basketball Player in Michigan\nIt wasn’t even a guarantee that Trinidad would play football in college. He was actually an all-state basketball player at Forest Hills Northern High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan and was named to the Detroit News all-state team in 2020.\nWhen Ferris State football coach Tony Annese went to Trinidad’s high school to recruit him, he initially wasn’t impressed after seeing the prospect on the football field. Then he watched him play basketball.\n“I really like quarterbacks who have been challenged with playing a position in another sport that requires open vision,” Annese told CBS Sports in October 2025. “I’m an old guy, so I go back to Magic Johnson and his point guard abilities, where you see things almost before they happen. Trinidad was that way as a point guard.”\nHe Has the Trinidad and Tobago Embassy Rooting for Ole Miss\nWhile fans in the United States may be divided over their college football rooting interests, Trinidad has captured the fandom of Trinidad and Tobago, the southernmost island country in the Caribbean.\nAmerican football is usually not on the nation’s radar, but its embassy in Washington, D.C. made sure to have the Rebels’ game against Georgia playing on its TVs.\n“The Mission is truly impressed by this remarkable phenomenon,” Janae Harris, a senior executive officer at the embassy told USA Today in December 2025. “Please be assured, we too will be tuning in to the Trinidad Chambliss game to witness this moment on Saturday.”\nOle Miss fans are returning the favor as well, with the Trinidad and Tobago flag flying at tailgates throughout the year.\nTrinidad Chambliss Was in a Viral AT&T Commercial\nTrinidad surely gave some Ole Miss fans a scare when his AT&T commercial debuted in December 2025. Set up like a recruit’s transfer announcement, the commercial shows Trinidad seated on his couch, surrounded by friends and family as he announces his “transfer decision.”\nThe fake sports talk show on TV says all eyes are on his decision and one friend seems stunned that he has decided to transfer.\nWhen his phone rings, Trinidad answers and finally says, “I’d love to transfer to AT&T,” talking about his cell phone service.",
