And here we were playing in front of 90,000 people.\n'Walking out on to that pitch, hearing the noise, seeing the size of that crowd, will live with me forever.'\nMembers of the team managed by Harry Batt, which has recently returned from Sicily, where they qualified for the finals of the 1971 Women's World Cup in Mexico\nThe England women's football team pose under a welcome sign outside their hotel in Mexico City during the Women's World Cup in Mexico, 18th August 1971\nMembers of the England women's football team dancing at their hotel in Mexico City during the Women's World Cup in Mexico, 18th August 1971\nJan Emms - a 'lost Lioness' poses with a football over 50 years after she represented England in the Women's World Cup\nJan's daughter' Gail Emms, who won a silver medal in Badminton at the Athens, has now written a book on the team's forgotten history called the Lost Lionesses.\nIn the book Jan recalls her childhood playing football in 1960s Bedford - at a time when the sport was determinedly not for girls.\nThere was a countrywide ban on women playing on Football Association-affiliated pitches but this did not stop Jan from playing on the streets with her brothers and other local footy enthusiasts.\nJan was spotted at the age of 17 by businessman Harry Batt who asked her to play for his team the Chiltern Valley Ladies.\nBatt saw huge potential in women's football though he was somewhat alone in his vision.\nGail told the Telegraph: 'There were pockets of women's football round the country, usually where some enterprising dad had started things so his daughter could play.\n'There was a team in Nuneaton, and one in Birmingham. There were no leagues or cups. So games were few and far between.'\nBatt decided to seize the opportunity when he heard that a Women's World Cup was in the works.\nLeah Williamson and Millie Bright of England lift the UEFA Women's EURO 2022 Trophy after their side's victory during the UEFA Women's Euro 2022 final\nEngland's Lionesses go wild with their staff as they celebrate the country's first major title since 1966\nThe eager manager pressed the FA hard to try and secure their backing but unfortunately the men in charge were not interested in women's football.\nDespite the early set-back, the players went ahead anyway and Batt assembled a team - largely made up of his Chiltern Valley Players - who travelled to Sicily for the qualifying tournament.\nJan recalled she had never been abroad before and so her father had to drive her to Peterborough to get a passport.\nThe English girls qualified for the finals in Mexico despite the challenges and having had limited big-game experience.\nAnother hurdle was soon thrown in the way as many players were required to give up their jobs in order to compete.\nTherefore Batt resolved he would pick several young girls who would be able to travel in the school holidays - meaning the 14 who flew out to Mexico were all strikingly young.\nGail who is a retired olympic English badminton player has written a book called 'The Lost Lionesses' which is about her mother being part of the 1971 Women's football team\n'Lost Lionesses' is a name retroactively applied to the first women's football team to represent England at a major international tournament, the 1971 Women's World Cup in Mexico\nBeing unofficial, unrecognised, and disbanded shortly after their return to England, the team was largely overlooked for nearly 50 years\nThe Lost Lionesses were mostly ignored by the media bar a small piece that appeared in the local paper\nJan was the third oldest, at 19 years of age.\nShe said: 'We had buses with police escorts, we had wonderful food, we stayed in the same hotel in Mexico City the England [men's] team had done at the World Cup the previous year.\n'One of the girls found out from the staff she was in the room Bobby Charlton had been in. I never found out who'd been in my room. Knowing my luck, it was probably Peter Bonetti.'\nThere were five other teams who had made it through to the finals - from Argentina, the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy and the hosts.\nA lack of experience meant the English first found themselves challenged by Argentina at the Azteca Stadium.\nIt was the match against the hosts that truly stunned Jan - as 90,000 spectators turned out to watch the game.\nManager Harry Batt with the team he took to Sicily, where they qualified for the finals of the 1971 Women's World Cup in Mexico\nThe tournament was organised by the Federation of Independent European Female Football (FIEFF) and Batt's unofficial team were known as the British Independents\nStanding, left to right: Harry Batt (manager), Gill Sayell, Jean Breckon, Jan Barton, Jill Stockley, Carol Wilson (captain), Trudy McCaffery, Yvonne Farr, Lilian Harris (goalkeeper), Louise Cross, Marlene Collins, Val Cheshire and June Batt (assistant manager). Front row: Keith Batt (team mascot), Chris Lockwood, Leah Caleb, Paula Rayner and Pat Dunn (coach). Carol Wilson and Yvonne Farr both have a leg in plaster after being injured on the pitch\nLeft to right: Bobbie Wing, Paula Rayner, Carol Wilson (captain), Jill Stockley, Jan Barton, Leah Caleb, Louise Cross, Chris Lockwood, Jean Breckon, Trudy McCaffery and Val Cheshire. All but Wing were in the squad that competed in Mexico\nThe team unfortunately lost 4-0 and the were subsequently evicted in the group stage.\nA fifth-place play-off against France also saw a loss for the British Independents despite Jan scoring twice in the game.\nDenmark emerged as overall cup champions after beating Mexico in a game that was watched by 114,000 spectators - still the largest ever crowd to watch a women's match.\nThe forgotten Lionesses were mostly ignored by the media bar a small piece in the local paper.\nBut the events of 1971 may have had wider repercussions than could be imagined as the FA sanctioned the first ever England women's international the following year, against Scotland.\nJan said she and her team mates were not invited to even trial for the team and Harry Batt was banned for life from any involvement in football - which 'broke him'.\nMost of the squad gave up on football and Jan does not have her medal anymore as it was stolen in a pub reunion.\n- The Lost Lionesses by Gail Emms, published by Headline, is available now.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying",
