After Saturday’s match, which saw the club win a historic third successive promotion to reach the Championship, both took to Instagram to share what the club means to them.\nIn a jubilant post, Ryan voiced his love for the city, admitting he “feels at home here” and comparing the stadium to a “church”. Along a series of celebratory photos, he described his pride in the club and how he agreed with the sentiment that Welsh people have the “heart of a poet and the fist of a fighter”.\nReferring to those who doubted his and Rob McElhenney’s Premier League ambitions, the Hollywood A-lister said no one was laughing any more.\nHe wrote: “We’ve been with Wrexham for what seems like the blink of an eye, but so much has happened. I remember the first press conference, we were asked what our goals were… and I think Rob jumped in with, 'The Premier League'. People laughed. They had every right to. It seemed insane… But we weren’t kidding.\n“I feel at home here. It’s a place that values community, decency and history. From the respect it pays to the Gresford Disaster, to the feeling of hope and miracles created by Mickey Thomas.\n‘These are big reasons Wrexham is growing into what it always was. It isn’t just a place with a history of ups and downs, it’s also a FEELING. And a feeling is sometimes as good or better than a memory.\"\nRyan and Rob’s Wrexham AFC takeover launched an adventure which has seen the club leapfrog from non-league to the Championship via an unprecedented run of two back-to-back promotions.

We’ve been promoted for a record third time in a row. That doesn’t happen without the wisdom of Phil Parkinson and his coaching staff, or the talent of Paul Mullin.\n“It doesn’t happen without Max Cleworth and Arthur Okonkwo. Or Mark Howard who may have one of the hardest jobs there is. I watched Sam Smith create a frightening blend between football and martial arts, scoring our second goal yesterday.\n“The stadium feels like a church. I know so many of you now. Since February, 2021, I’ve watched babies become regulars. And some regulars depart us for good.\n“We’ve had the honour to scatter ashes of loved ones across that field. I’ve even watched every available hand shovel snow off the pitch to keep a match from cancellation.\"\nFinishing his tribute, he wrote: “Somebody said the Welsh have the 'heart of a poet and the fist of a fighter'. That’s what I love about this place. I wish the whole world could visit Wrexham. Diolch.”\nDuring and after the match, Ryan, 48, and wife Blake could be seen cuddling and cheering in the stands. She later shared an Instagram post indicating she is now just as emotionally invested in Wrexham AFC as her husband.\nRyan previously revealed his decision to buy “half of a fifth-tier national football league [club] in Wales” didn’t initially sit too well with his wife. But judging by her post, all is now forgiven.\nThe Gossip Girl actress, 37, even joined the team after the final whistle as the players hugged each other in celebration.\nApplauding Wrexham AFC, she described how she now feels part of one big family. She wrote: “Thank you to the entire town, everyone who flew in far and wide, and to everyone on the field and off, from groundskeepers to stewards, gift shop to PT, kit managers to self-elected chant writers. History was made yesterday not just with you, but because of you.\n“I’ll always appreciate the warmth and embrace that you give me and my loved ones, in a way usually reserved for family. Your passion and the ferocity of your joy is the magic. Thank you for an unforgettable day. And for being a key part of our lives every day.\n“Congratulations to the entire team, their families and the one and only Phil Parkinson. You show us all that impossible dreams really can come true.”\nStill basking in the glow of success, Blake saluted the Wrexham AFC women’s team, describing how one of the day’s highlights was the sight of scores of girls on the pitch wearing Wrexham AFC shirts.\nShe also saluted Rob and Ryan as her “favorite crazy ones, misfits, rebels, troublemakers, round pegs in the square holes... ones who see things differently”. She added: “Thank you for the community and elation you bring me, your family’s and so many.”\nAfter Wrexham’s victory, Blake posted a photo of her husband embracing co-owner Rob in the stands, adding a gushing tribute to the pair. She wrote: “To these two men... the love and respect that pours out of you each and together exponentially grows and creates more joy, more possibilities, more magic, more history.\n“This picture feels to me like a painting of all you do for so many for being so present and appreciative of every moment.” Sign up for the North Wales Live newsletter sent twice daily to your inbox\nSee what's on in your area",
