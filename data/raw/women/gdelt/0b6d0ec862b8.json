(Part 3) -By Joe Dauda\nTo further prove that this war is going to be after the Holocaust (during which Adolf Hitler killed millions of Jews) note the following statement in Ezekiel’s prophecy and stand in awe at the wisdom of God, never forgetting that the Book of Ezekiel was written between 595BC and 574BC. In fact, if you check the top of the margin of your King James Version of the Bible, you will see that both Ezekiel 38 and 39 were written in 587BC.\nWho would be the greatest loser if Israel signs a peace deal with Saudi Arabia?\nIran.\nWho is the major financier of Hamas?\nIran.\nWho did Thailand negotiate with in order to release their hostages kidnapped from Israel on the 7th of October Hamas?\nIran.\nWhy?\nBecause they know who the puppet master is.\nAnd who is the puppet master of Hamas?\nIran.\nWhy has the relationship between Israel and the Saudis warmed up in recent years?\nIran.\nWhich country has publicly stated its intention to wipe Israel off the map?\nIran.\nWhich country did the Bible mention by name as one of those that will join in the invasion of Israel in the end times?\nIran.\nOver 2500 years ago, our omniscient God led prophet Ezekiel to prophesy that, after the regathering of the children of Israel back into their land, an invasion would take place. Bible students believe that the leader of this invasion is Russia. But there is no doubt about the involvement of Iran in the invasion. In fact, the Bible mentions Iran by name — its primordial name of Persia.\nEzekiel 38:5\n“Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet.”\nYou would have to read the whole of Ezekiel 38 and 39 to understand this prophecy. But note that Bible students believe that the Ethiopia referred to in Ezekiel 38:5 is the nation of Sudan. I know that Sudan is part of the Abraham Accords and has signed a normalization agreement with Israel. But prophecy must be fulfilled. I don’t wish for a military coup but all it takes for Sudan to become an enemy of Israel is a successful coup by the other faction in Sudan.\nDue to the fact that the Bible uses the old names of nations, it is not immediately clear which nations God mentioned to Ezekiel when you read Ezekiel 38. But Bible students have determined through research that, apart from Russia (which leads the invasion) and Iran and Libya which are mentioned by name, and then Sudan, the other nation mentioned is Turkey.\nBut one of the most amazing parts of Ezekiel’s prophecy has to do with Saudi Arabia. The forefathers of the Saudis are Sheba and Dedan — the two grandsons of Cush, who was the son of Ham, who was the son of Noah. See Genesis 10:6-7.\nThe prophecy of Ezekiel 38 says Sheba and Dedan will criticize the invasion of Israel by the nations listed in verses 2, 5, and 6.\nEzekiel 38:13\n“Sheba and Dedan . . . shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? Hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?\nNote that cattle, silver, and gold were the measure of wealth in Bible days. These days, the wealth of nations is determined based on other parameters.\nFor many years, Bible students wondered how Arabs, who are natural enemies of Israel, will criticize an invasion of Israel. Then came a madman into the White House. And his name was Donald Trump. This unusual guy worked pragmatically to tame the raucous geopolitical situation in the Middle East and the result was the Abraham Accords. Now, the relationship between Israel and the Arab world (including Saudi Arabia) has changed so dramatically we no longer wonder how Ezekiel 38:13 will be fulfilled. It is now clear as crystal that, whether or not normalization occurs between Israel and Saudi Arabia, an invasion of Israel by the nations implicated in the prophecy of Ezekiel will cause a reaction from Saudi Arabia — on the side of Israel.\nMy point?\nProphecy is being fulfilled before our very eyes. Before Trump and before the Abraham Accords (and especially before the recent rise of Iran) Saudi Arabia was a staunch enemy of Israel and a benefactor of the Palestinians. That job has now been left for Qatar, the oil-rich Sunni nation that allies more with Shia Iran than with its fellow Sunnis. In fact, Qatar has become a thorn in the flesh of Sunni Islam nations, who accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism. But the real issue is Iran. Qatar’s population is over 90% Sunni and its closeness to Iran — the dominant Shia power on earth — must have rattled the Sunnis. Things got to a head in 2017 and this Qatar issue nearly divided the Sunni Muslim world into two, with Qatar being supported by Iran and Turkey. And Libya. And the Muslim Brotherhood. And Hamas. Apart from Iran, all the other entities that supported Qatar were Sunnis. But you need to understand the dynamics of their support and why they did not band with their Sunni brothers like Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Turkey is in competition with Saudi Arabia for leadership of the Sunni Islamic world; and Hamas is more or less the Gaza version of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is a group that has been declared illegal by several Arab governments. On its part, Saudi Arabia was supported in the impasse by Egypt, United Arab Emirates (Dubai), Bahrain, Mauritania, Niger, Gabon, the Maldives, and several other countries.\nRemember that the prophecy mentions Turkey and Libya and Iran. Apart from Hamas, it is these three countries that were the main supporters of Qatar in its face off with the Saudis. That should be food for thought if you have been following my drift so far. Some people who allow themselves to be deceived by the Aljazeera news channel do not even know that the Saudis and other Arab governments consider Aljazeera such a national security threat that one of their conditions for reconciliation with Qatar was for Qatar to shut down Aljazeera, which is owned by the government of Qatar. Remember that the BBC and Aljazeera lied against Israel by blaming Israel for the rocket launched within Gaza that landed at the Al Ahli hospital and killed 30 people. Fortunately, the bare facts eventually emerged and BBC was forced to eat humble pie and apologize publicly. But the BBC was caught in another lie against Israel a few weeks later. They claimed that Israel targeted Arab doctors in their raid on the Al Shifa hospital, only to later eat humble pie again and admit that they had lied against Israel. The fact was that Israel came along for the raid of Al Shifa with Arab-speaking doctors so that these doctors could help save lives as well as facilitate communication with the patients in the hospital. What Israel meant for good was broadcast as great evil to the world and it even resulted in spontaneous protests in some Arab cities. So don’t blame the Saudis for wanting Aljazeera shut down as part of the negotiations for peace with Qatar. They have suffered from Aljazeera’s lies too — apparently.\nAs for the international angle, remember that the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Israel, and Saudi Arabia are beginning to see themselves as allies; while Iran, Qatar, Hamas, Turkey, Libya, and the Muslim Brotherhood are all in one basket. And the MB are good friends with former US President Barack Obama. Obama even found time out of his busy schedule as US President to host leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood at the White House. Remember that Obama’s first foreign trip after he became president in 2008 was to Egypt. He specifically gave a speech at the University of Cairo. I don’t know what type of signal Obama gave to the crowd, but the Arab Spring was the next thing that was witnessed in the Middle East. And, in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood was the prime beneficiary of the Arab Spring.\nHow so?\nOne of their own, Mohammed Morsi, became President of Egypt. And guess the first thing Morsi attempted to do.\nIsrael.\nIt is always about Israel.\nThis Muslim Brotherhood man (feared by the Saudis and most Arab governments but supported by Iran, Turkey, Libya, and having Barack Obama as Big Brother) wanted to tear up the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel that was signed in 1979. And this would have resulted in immediate war between the two countries because the primary purpose of the peace treaty is to forbid war between them — until that peace treaty is canceled. And that was what Morsi started toying with. Of course the Egyptian military simply shoved him aside and he is now history. Today, we can conveniently add the Yemeni Houthis to the side of the Qatar/Iran axis. And they have been trying to register their loyalty to Iran by sending armed drones towards Israel and even shooting ballistic missiles at Israel. Do you now understand (as I stated in an earlier article) why Saudi Arabia, Egypt and even Jordan are intercepting missiles fired from Yemen towards Israel?\nCan you imagine that?\nMuslim nations intercepting weapons shot by a fellow Muslim nation towards a Jewish nation.\nExcept you understand the role of Iran in the region, you will never understand this interesting and even intriguing development.\nRemember that Ezekiel foresaw a warming of relations between Israel and the descendants of Sheba and Dedan, who are today’s Saudis. And it is happening right now. This does not mean I love the Saudis and hate the Iranians. I love the Sunnis and the Shias and all of humanity. The things I am stating are just the bare facts — without prejudice.\nAs for those who doubt the relevance of the Ezekiel 38 prophecy with regard to the end times, for their own sake, I will urge them to consider the evidence below, which makes it clear and incontrovertible that Ezekiel 38 is not about an old or Bible days invasion of Israel but something meant to happen at the end of the world. And the evidence is from the prophecy itself.\nEzekiel 38:16\n“And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days . . . “\nDo you know what the Bible means when it uses the word “latter”?\n1 Timothy 4:1\n“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;”\nEverybody knows that the prophecy above is referring to the end times.\nWhy?\nBecause when the Bible says the latter times it is surely referring to the end times. Latter means end in the Bible.\nThe outpouring of the Holy Spirit during Pentecost (just 10 days after Jesus Christ ascended to heaven) is often referred to as the “former rain” in the Bible and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the last days is referred to as the “latter rain”. Again, the reason is because latter means last or end.\nA generally accepted principle in the Bible is that, when God repeats something (especially a prophecy) that thing is cast in stone — it is established.\nDeuteronomy 19:15\n“At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.”\nWhen Joseph was interpreting the dream of Pharaoh (which Pharaoh’s servants and Pharaoh’s gods could not interpret) he told Pharaoh that, because the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, the matter was established.\nGenesis 41:32\n“And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.”\nIn making it clear that the Ezekiel 38 invasion of the land of Israel will be in the last days, the Bible uses the word “latter” two times; and both times were in the same chapter 38. I have already quoted Ezekiel 38:16, which categorically places this war in the last days by using the word “latter”. See another use of the word “latter” in Ezekiel 38:8.\nTo further prove that this war is going to be after the Holocaust (during which Adolf Hitler killed millions of Jews) note the following statement in Ezekiel’s prophecy and stand in awe at the wisdom of God, never forgetting that the Book of Ezekiel was written between 595BC and 574BC. In fact, if you check the top of the margin of your King James Version of the Bible, you will see that both Ezekiel 38 and 39 were written in 587BC.\nMy point?\nThis prophecy was written at least 500 years before Jesus Christ was born. And God basically foretold the holocaust, which Satanists and enemies of the Jews now dare to deny.\nFor those not conversant with the term, the holocaust was Adolf Hitler’s attempt during the Second World War to wipe out all the Jews in the world.\nHow did God describe modern Israel to Ezekiel? Note that He refers to Israel as a land “brought back from the sword”.\nEzekiel 38:8\n“After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword . . .”\nThis language absolutely fits the holocaust. The instrument of death in Bible days was the sword. Being brought back from the sword thus means being rescued from certain death — in the case of an individual — or being rescued from annihilation — in the case of a people or a nation. By saying that the nation of Israel will be “brought back from the sword” God, in my view, was foretelling a time during the last days when a brazen attempt will be made to kill all the Jews on earth. But they will be saved; they will be “brought back from the sword. In other words, they will survive an attempted genocide. By killing millions of Jews and continuing with the pogrom, it was clear that Hitler was intent on killing each and every Jew in the whole world. But for the allied forces that defeated the Nazis, that was what would have happened.\nIn the 5-Part Series I published sometime ago titled Gravity As A Weapon Of War, I provided ample evidence that Satanists have what they refer to as The Invocation, which contains what they refer to as The Great Plan. At least part of The Great Plan is to achieve the same goal Adolf Hitler attempted — wipe Jews off the face of the earth. You can choose to read the 5-Part Series I laboured to write, or do your own research. But the understanding that Satanists (who rule the world on behalf of Satan) want to eliminate the Jews before their Christ (Antichrist) shows up will open your eyes to understand what’s going on in this world and especially in the Middle East. You will finally understand why the powers that be are working behind the scenes to destroy Israel and how the existence and survival of Israel is an act of God’s direct intervention in the form of daily and I dare say hourly miracles. You will understand why all the major media organizations in the world work very hard to make you believe that Hamas is made up of very brave and highly intelligent and morally sound freedom fighters, whereas the Israelis are bullies who have a special craving for seeing the death and destruction of unarmed and innocent civilians — including women and children. You will understand why the whole world went ablaze and tried to prevent Israel from using its military might to quickly conclude the current war (by insisting on ceasefire) while refusing to get Hamas to release the hostages. You must have noticed that, in the ongoing war, while brainwashed people are shouting at Israel to ceasefire (so as to enable the continued existence of Hamas and guarantee the deaths of Israelis in the future) none of them were told that, if Hamas releases all the hostages it is currently holding, even people like me will begin to shout at Israel to ceasefire. But as long as Hamas holds onto those Israelis they kidnapped, on what basis can a moral person ask Israel to ceasefire? Yet a lot of people are doing nothing to encourage Hamas to release the abductees, while mounting pressure on Israel to ceasefire. When you get to know the agenda of Satanists, you will understand why the UN is one of the greatest enemies of Israel; why stupid lies have been invented to try to prove that the Jews are not Jews because they were scattered throughout the world during the AD70 dispersion and have lost their identity.\nTell it to the birds.\nSo the Jews are no longer a unique group of people with identifiable characteristics but Adolf Hitler was able to determine who a Jew was for the purpose of annihilating them?\nNow that they are in the land of Israel, out of sheer embarrassment at the miraculous power of God, Satanists had to invent the lie that the people of Israel have no blood connection with father Abraham, or Isaac, or Jacob.\nAgain I say, tell that to the birds.\nInterestingly, there is further proof in Ezekiel 38:8 that God was basically foretelling the holocaust, which, although carried out by Adolf Hitler who was the leader of Germany at the time, affected the Jews in many nations. Particularly the nations of Europe, where most of them were living.\nEzekiel 38:8\n“Thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste; but it is brought forth out of the nations . . . “\nNote: they were “brought forth out of the nations . . .”\nSo God did indicate that the Jews will come out of many nations after an attempt to annihilate them and that the place will be a wasteland. This is amazing because, as the famous American writer and comedian Mark Twain remarked, when he visited the area many years before the return of the Jews, it was largely a wasteland. So the prophecy is spot on and the evidence is overwhelming: the Jews will face an attempted annihilation in the last days and be rescued and then gathered out of many nations into the land of Israel. If Ezekiel 38:8 is not referring to the near annihilation of the Jews during the holocaust and the gathering of the Jews out of many nations and the eventual establishment of the State of Israel, please tell us what it is referring to.\nIf you believe in the Bible, it means you believe in the God of the Bible. But the God of the Bible is the God of Israel. And you are not better than the Israelis in any way. As a Christian, your salvation is because you were spiritually grafted into an olive tree that was naturally theirs. They are children of Abraham by nature and become complete when they believe in Jesus Christ. It is through the goodness of God that the merits of the death of Jesus Christ becomes available to all, making it possible for us to tap into the blessings of Abraham.\nRomans 11:24\n“For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?”\nThe Bible even warns against the idea of treating the Jews in a condescending manner.\nRomans 11:17-18\n“And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.”\nIf you say Israel sinned against God, are you without sin?\nThe fact of the matter is that you cannot accept the part of the Bible where God says He will punish the children of Israel for their rebellion or unbelief — and then proceeds to do as He says — only for you to then fall for the lies of Satanists and refuse to believe the part where God says He will do this and that for the benefit of Israel.\nSo it is ok for God to punish Israel and permit their dispersion and humiliation in heathen lands but it is not ok for Him to gather them back — as a way of providing evidence that He is the true God, right?\nEzekiel 39:26-28 and verse 23.\n[26]After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.\n[27]When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;\n[28]Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.\n[23]And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.\nJesus Christ wept over Jerusalem while declaring that the Jews did not know the time of their visitation.\nLuke 19:41 and 44.\n“And when He was come near, He beheld the city, and wept over it.\n44: “. . . because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.”\nWhat were the things that were to happen to the Jews because of their rejection of Jesus Christ?\nFrom Luke 19:43 and 44, these things are:\nVerse 43: “. . . thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side.”\nThe above is the language of a siege. Jesus Christ was essentially saying that Jerusalem will be besieged. But there was more.\nVerse 44: “And shall lay thee even with the ground . . . and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another. . .”\nMost Bible students will react with awareness to the phrase “”one stone upon another” because it is a language of prophecy and part of the very first sentence uttered by Jesus Christ in His most well known discourse on end time prophecy, as stated in Matthew 24.\nMatthew 24:2\n“And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things: verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here ONE STORY UPON ANOTHER, that shall not be thrown down.”\nAnd what did Jesus Christ mean by the statement that there will be no one stone upon the other?\nFirst of all, He was referring to the second Temple — the one built after Solomon’s Temple was destroyed by king Nebuchadnezzar. This prophecy about not one stone upon another was a very terrible prophecy — and it was completely fulfilled. Both church history and world history attest to the fact that the fulfillment took place in AD70. You can just Google “the siege of Jerusalem” and convince yourself that the words of Jesus Christ came to pass. Even the Temple He prophesied about was destroyed in the very unique way He stated. Remember He said there would not be one stone left on another.\nHow was that fulfilled?\nDuring the siege of Jerusalem, the Temple was burnt to the ground. But because the gold of the Temple melted and began to drop within the cracks in the structure of the building, the Roman soldiers (in order to recover the gold) had to take out all the stones that made up the Temple building one after the other. It was because of the gold. And that was how the words of Jesus Christ were fulfilled.\nIt was to protect His disciples from the devastation of the invasion of Jerusalem by the Roman army that Jesus Christ gave them the sign of the abomination of desolation and told them to leave in a hurry whenever they saw that sign. In God’s providence, He ensured that Jerusalem was besieged three and a half years before the AD70 siege — so as to enable His children escape.\nMatthew 24:15-16\n“When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) Then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains.”\nWorld history says this abomination of desolation that served as a sign for the people of God to leave Jerusalem took place sometime in AD66 — three and a half years before AD70.\nHow do we know that the abomination of desolation is the surrounding of Jerusalem by the Roman army in AD66?\nIt’s too easy and you don’t need to think about it. Because it is right there in the Bible.\nLuke 21:20-21\n“And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains . . .”\nWhen you compare the above with the parallel passage in Matthew 24:15-16, it becomes clear that the abomination of desolation is the same thing as Jerusalem being surrounded by armies — or compassed with armies, as stated by Jesus Christ in Luke 21:20.\nFurthermore, in Luke’s account (Luke 21:24) Jesus Christ also gave the history of the world from AD70 until the end of human probation, using the history of the Jews as a template.\nHow did Jesus Christ use Jewish history to foretell human history?\nLet’s state Luke 21:24 below, bearing in mind that, after the Romans destroyed both Jerusalem and the second Temple, the Jews were banished from that land and scattered throughout the world. In fact, the word, “diaspora”originally referred to the Jews living outside of Israel (as a result of this punitive dispersion that took place in AD70) and we today say Nigerians living in diaspora when we are referring to Nigerians living outside their own country.\nSo how did Jesus Christ tell world history from AD70 until the close of human probation, using the template of Jewish history?\nLuke 21:24\n“And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.”\nJesus Christ is saying that the Jews will be led away captive into all nations from AD70 until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. I addressed the issue of the times of the Gentiles in details in an earlier article but must now give a brief explanation to guide those who have never known about this or read my earlier article.\nWithin the prophecy of Daniel 9, God allotted 490 years to the Jews. It was a period of probation. And it was what Jesus Christ was referring to in Mark 1:15 when He began to preach to the Jews saying “the time is fulfilled.”\nWhat time?\nIt is the 483 years (or 69 weeks) Daniel said it would take from the giving of a certain decree until the anointing of Jesus Christ, Who was referred to as the Messiah. The 69 weeks were referred to as seven weeks and three score and two weeks. And one day is equal to a year in this prophecy, making the 69 weeks equivalent to 483 years.\nDaniel 9:25\n“Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks . . .”\nJesus Christ was anointed during His baptism 483 years after the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem, given in 457BC by king Artaxerxes. But the probation of the Jews was to last for 490 years, meaning that, from the baptism of Jesus Christ (same time as His anointing by the Holy Spirit) the Jews still had seven more years of probationary time. The ministry of Jesus Christ lasted approximately three and a half years and He died, rose again, and went to heaven, leaving the Jews with another three and a half years during which the gospel was exclusively preached to them. Some Christians have no idea that the preaching of Jesus Christ was exclusively for the Jews. Even His disciples were commanded to preach to none other but the “lost sheep of the house of Israel.” Any other person outside the Jewish community that got anything from Christ did so by violent faith. But that is a topic for another day.\nMatthew 10:5-6\n[5]These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:\n[6]But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\nWhy did Jesus Christ focus His ministry exclusively on the Jews?\nIt was because their 490 years of probation (or the times of the Jews)!was still active during His ministry and until that 490 years ended with the stoning of Stephen three and a half years after the ministry of Christ ended, the Jews remained the exclusive beneficiaries of the gospel. If you will recall, it was after the stoning of Stephen that the gospel began to be taken to the Gentiles. But these things were explained in the series titled The Greatest Deception In Modern Christianity, which is available on request.\nWhile the Jews tried to cope in the nations they had been scattered to after the AD70 dispersion, no one in his sane mind would have believed that there would ever be a nation of Israel in this world again. But the prophecy of Jesus Christ in Luke 21:24 said Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until . . .\nUntil when?\nJust like the time of the Jews was fulfilled, Jerusalem was to be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles is fulfilled. From the perspective of the Bible, the human family is divided into two groups — namely Jews and Gentiles. As far as the Bible is concerned, you are either a Jew or a Gentile. That means if you are not a Jew, you are a Gentile. And the prophecy of Jesus Christ in Luke 21:24 was not referring to spiritual Jews. I understand that Christians are spiritual Jews. But the prophecy of Jesus Christ was referring to the physical blood-of-father-Abraham type of Jews. In fact, the prophecy was about their punishment, primarily for rejecting Jesus Christ. And that prophecy says Jerusalem shall continually be trodden down of the Gentiles (non-Jews) until the times of these Gentiles are fulfilled. If this means anything, it means that, by the time the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled, Jerusalem would no longer be under the control of the Gentiles. And since the human family is either Jew or Gentile, it means Jerusalem would be under the control of the Jews when the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.\nIf Jew plus Gentile is equal to all of humanity, then it means that the end of the times of the Gentiles is also the end of human probation since the Jews already had their 490 years of probation from 457BC to AD34 when Deacon Stephen was stoned and when the gospel began to be preached to the whole of humanity — and no longer to the Jews alone, as Jesus Christ commanded in Matthew 10:5-6.\nThe day you see the Jews in charge of Jerusalem, you can be sure that, based on the prophecy of Jesus Christ in Luke 21:24, human probation has ended. That means you can sense the nearness of the end of human probation by considering how close the Jews are to taking complete control of Jerusalem. Note that, when modern Israel was established in 1948, the Israelis did not have control over any part of Jerusalem. It was the 1967 Six-Day War that enabled them to take control of some portion of Jerusalem.\nWhat if another war big enough to warrant their complete take over of Jerusalem takes place?\nYou think they will be reluctant to do so?\nProphecy must be fulfilled.\nAnd this particular prophecy is apparently having a staggered fulfillment.\nIn 1948, Ezekiel 38:8 was fulfilled: the Jews were “brought back from the sword” and “brought forth from many nations” into the land of Israel that was “always waste”.\nThen, in 1967, during the six-day war, they took possession of a part of Jerusalem, partly fulfilling the conditions for the fulfillment of the times of the Gentiles.\nI am thoroughly convinced that the Ezekiel 38 war (which ends with the blistering defeat of the enemies of Israel by direct divine intervention) will provide the Israelis a credible opportunity to completely take over Jerusalem and bring the prophecy of Luke 21:24 to fulfillment. This is why I believe that the Ezekiel 38 war will end with the close of human probation — when the Jews assume complete control of Jerusalem. It is not an abstract belief. It is based on my belief in the words of Jesus Christ. And that explains my interest in what is going on in the Middle East.\nSome enemies of the Bible and of the God of the Bible say some ridiculous things — below their level of intelligence — all in a bid to neutralize the providence of God in the history of modern Israel. They say something like: “the establishment of the State of Israel was all part of the plan of the Illuminati to achieve some of their goals”. I honestly think that is a crooked lie because I have come to understand that there is no lie too base for satanists to tell out of fear that rational people can start from the history of Israel and discover the true God. But even if you accepted the theory that the Illuminati/New World Order crowd somehow played a role in the establishment of modern Israel and that it was for a sinister agenda.\nSo what?\nDoes Bible prophecy necessarily require the cooperation of godly people for its fulfillment? Does God not use people in their evil machinations to still fulfill His will? The people that killed Jesus Christ; did they not have their nefarious agenda? But did that negate the fact that they were but fulfilling prophecy in spite of themselves? Did king Nebuchadnezzar not have his own agenda in invading Israel in 606BC? So if it can be proven that king Nebuchadnezzar had an evil agenda in invading Israel, that now invalidates the prophecy of Jeremiah that said he will invade and burn Jerusalem to the ground?\nThe enemies of God know not that they make fools of themselves when they manifest desperation in trying to neutralize God’s glory in His workings in the destiny of nations. Whether by the agenda of the Illuminati or by the political calculation of the diplomats at the United Nations at the time, when the time came, Israel was reestablished — according to Bible prophecy.\nAnother irritating thing some people do — not realizing that they are repeating ideas generated by Satanists — is to say that the Jews are as sinful as other people and not righteous in any particular way. In fact, these people are reluctant to believe any prophecy concerning modern Israel because, to them, any prophecy about modern Israel means you are insinuating that the Jews are a righteous people. There is no limit to the harm Satan can cause if he can hide the truth of the Bible from you. Please read the Bible and learn how God works. The end time prophecy about the workings of God on behalf of Israel does not require their righteousness. It is all about the purpose of God.\nEzekiel 36:22-23\n[22]Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.\n[23]And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.\nAs you can see from the above passage from prophet Ezekiel, our unchangeable God is not doing what He is doing for Israel because they deserve it or because they are righteous. And nothing you think or say about Israel will change the agenda of God.\nIt is all about God’s glory\nAnd if you will be honest with yourself, God has been good to you — very good to you — in spite of what you know about your life and your many failings.\nIs God then permitted to be gracious to you and not to the Jews?\nIs God permitted to keep you alive in spite of what you did the other day and not also exercise the same patience with the Jews so as to fulfill His prophecies?\nDo you know what God has put the Jews through?\nWas it your great grandfather that went through the holocaust instigated by Satanists and carried out by Hitler?\nHave I not published an article proving that the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church during the Second World War lied to the Americans and the allied forces about what Hitler was doing to the Jews? In other words, he secretly wished for Hitler’s success in annihilating the Jews. And a letter proving the Pope’s lies was recently published by an Italian newspaper. I have written about this.\nDid I not publish the fact that this same Pope fought hard for clemency for Nazis who were convicted of crimes after the war? Have I not published articles about how God used US President Richard Nixon to help Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War? This is probably why Nixon’s reputation has been destroyed by the powers that be today. Have I not written about how George H.W. Bush, the late father of former President George Bush, worked with others in the security cabinet to prevent Nixon from sending help to Israel when Israel was facing certain annihilation? Whether you believe it or not, H. W. Bush (aka Bush 41) tried to ensure the destruction of Israel in his capacity as Director of the CIA under Nixon’s administration. At that time, everybody knew that the Russians were arming the Arabs. Thus, there was no diplomatic price America needed to pay in also arming Israel since the Russians were openly arming the Arabs. But the enemies of Israel (Bush 41 and others) brought up all sorts of confusing and false security concerns to discourage Nixon. Thank God the man refused. And he told Golda Meir how his mother had prepared him to deal with that Yom Kippur crisis, as far back as when he was a little boy. All these facts have been published in the series titled Gravity As A Weapon Of War. The story of how Richard Nixon’s mother prepared his mindset to approve the desperate request for urgent military aid by Israel’s one and only female Prime Minister Golda Meir several decades before the Yom Kippur War is in one of the articles in that series. Only a hater of God (or a brainwashed or ignorant Christian) will deny the divine hand upon Israel and in the preservation of Israel.\nThe enemies of Israel are the high and mighty of the world and, I repeat, every day of Israel’s existence is a miracle. All you need do is to calm down and do an objective research. And you had better do it before the internet is either taken down or compromised beyond usefulness one of these days. Google is already interfering with searches you make. For example, because they hate President Donald Trump, if you search for Donald Trump on Google or on YouTube, except you already knew about the guy before, the sort of entries you will be getting are those of allegations against him, of half-truths about him, and of things that will make you have a jaundiced view of him.\nFind out for yourself: do Satanists have what they refer to as The Invocation?\nDoes the invocation have anything to do with the appearance of the Christ?\nDoes The Invocation contain The Plan?\nDoes The Plan have anything to do with Jews?\nWhat treatment does The Plan recommend for Jews all over the world?\nIf you do this and get the right answers, you will get one of the most powerful paradigm shifts in your life. You will finally understand that God and Satan are at war in Israel and that God is using Israel to prove His power. And He will do it in an ultimate way during the Ezekiel 38 war.\nEzekiel 38:23\n“Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD.”\nYou will understand why people can be massacred in any part of the globe without much noise from the UN. But if Hamas attacks Israel and Israel begins to fight back, the UN begins to count the number of dead people. It is a psychological strategy to weaken Israel’s resolve and enable their eventual slow-motion annihilation. No matter how powerful you are as a boxer (or how good a football team your country has) if the referee is determined that you will lose the match, you will most likely lose. This is what the UN and other world powers are trying to do in Israel.\nDo you know that there are over 13000 UN workers in Gaza alone?\nCan the UN claim it does not know about the Hamas tunnels, including the ones that have entrances and exits from hospitals?\nWhen you understand that the UN is ruled by Satanists and understand the strategic goal of Satanists concerning Jews, believe me, your eyes will be opened.\nAnd it has nothing to do with religion. Back in those days, Saudi Arabia used to pay Palestinian families $25000 if any of their children partook in a suicide bombing mission against Israelis. So the young man dies and his family gets the money. You can imagine what Palestinian parents must have been telling their children about the honour of dying in the name of killing Israelis in those days. During that time, the Saudis and every other hater of Israel was in the good books of the powers that be. But it seems the powers that be decided on Iran. I have every reason to believe that Iran is being sponsored against Israel. I remember an article I published detailing my thesis of how Iran came to be a power in drone technology. I believe that the MQ9 reaper American drone that was allegedly shot down by Iran during Obama’s presidency was a covert technology transfer to Iran. And that technology transfer is now yielding fruits. Iran now knows how to make drones to the extent that they are supplying Russia for the Ukraine war. Thanks to Obama.\nThe dependence of the powers that be on Iran made Iran powerful and Iran began a slow match towards acquiring nuclear weapons. To cut the long story short, the rise of Iran was what made Saudi Arabia and Israel grow close, based on the principle that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And the powers that be were obviously unhappy with Saudi Arabia for this — and also for consenting to the Abraham Accords, which has brought and is bringing peace between Israel and Muslim nations.\nHow did they punish Saudi Arabia?\nPresident Trump had designated the Yemeni Houthis a terrorist organization. This had a lot of implications in that it made life a bit tougher for them. Nobody would openly sell them arms — forcing them to buy at exorbitant prices on the black market — and they were excluded from the SWIFT international payment system, among other measures.\nBut what did Joe Biden do as soon as he got to the White House?\nIn spite of the fact that the Houthis were intermittently bombing the Saudis, President Joe Biden removed them from the list of terrorist organizations. In other words, he made life easier for the enemies of Saudi Arabia. And it was this Yemeni threat against Saudi Arabia that Iran used to force Saudi Arabia to sign a peace treaty with it — just to impede the peace talks Saudi Arabia was having with Israel at the time. That’s why I refer to the Saudi-Iran peace agreement as Peace At Gun Point. The gun in the hands of the Iranians which forced the Saudis to reluctantly sign that peace deal was the Yemeni Houthis. And Biden made things easier for them — by reversing, through Executive Order, what Trump had done. So when I allege that the powers that be are supporting Iran against Israel, I know what I’m talking about.\nWhat else did Joe Biden do against the Saudis?\nHe removed American Patriot anti missile batteries from Saudi soil — at the very time the Saudis needed it the most. Of course, so as not to make it look like the Saudis were being targeted, the Biden administration claimed it was also removing these weapons system from three other countries, including Jordan and Kuwait. But what about the weapon system known as THAAD — Terminal High Altitude Area Defence? This American weapon is so powerful it is feared by the Russians. No wonder the Russians demand its removal from Poland for any sort of détente with the Western powers. President Donald Trump, in addition to the Patriot anti missile batteries, had deployed the THAAD weapon platform in Saudi Arabia to protect the oil-rich kingdom.\nWhile Trump should be commended for showing American teeth for the purpose of protecting Saudi Arabia, was he doing the Saudis a favour?\nNot really.\nThere is an old deal between the United States and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In fact, it is that deal that gave the US dollar its petrodollar status. And it is a simple deal. In exchange for protection from the United States, the Saudis (the largest oil producers in the world) would insist on dollar payments for all oil deals. This was partly why the dollar became an almighty currency. So the Americans owe the Saudis protection and Trump was only doing the right thing. But to placate Iran (just like his boss Barack Obama did in many ways during his presidency) Joe Biden pulled the THAAD system from Saudi soil — along with the Patriot Missiles — claiming that things had begun to calm down in the Middle East, as if he was unaware of the periodic attacks of Saudi Arabia by the Yemeni Houthis.\nAnd this is why the Saudis pivoted towards China and even threatened the petrodollar status quo by publicly saying that oil deals could now be consummated in currencies other than the US dollar. I’m only repeating these facts (which I have published in earlier articles) for the sake of those who may not have read them. On the whole, there is more than sufficient evidence to validate everything I am saying here. It is just that some of these evidences have already been published and including them here will make this already lengthy article even lengthier.\nFinally, when you add the prophecy of Ezekiel 38 (the reestablishment of Israel as a fallout of the holocaust and its subsequent invasion by Russia, Iran, Libya, and co) to the prophecy of the times of the Jews in Daniel 9:25 (which makes it easier to understand the times of the Gentiles) and the prophecy of Jesus Christ about the eventual takeover of Jerusalem by the Jews when the times of the Gentiles comes to and end, what the Bible teaches us to expect in the end times, in my view, is this:\nAfter the dispersion of AD70, the Jews will face near annihilation in the end times. But they would be rescued (brought back from the sword), gathered from the many nations to which they had been scattered; they would reestablish the State of Israel, and one day take full control of Jerusalem, thus fulfilling the latter part of the prophecy of Luke 21:24. The fact that they now have control over parts of Jerusalem shows how close we are to their eventual takeover of the whole of Jerusalem and the end of human probation.\nThe outcome of the Ezekiel 38 war (following the divine intervention in favour of Israel) will enable the Jews take full control of Jerusalem because their major enemies would have been rendered impotent by the end of that war. And the people of Israel will demand for a total takeover of Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount, which now hosts several mosques like the famous Al Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the rock. How the Antichrist will take advantage of this situation is a topic for another day.\nThe fact that Israel’s current Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, publicly stated his intention to attack Iran’s nuclear weapons facilities during his inauguration in late 2022 is evidence that we are close to the Ezekiel 38 war and also close to the end of human probation. And the success or failure of an Israeli airstrike on Iran’s nuclear facilities is not the question here. The question is how Iran will react. As at today, there is a growing alliance between Iran, Turkey, and Russia — all nations implicated by Ezekiel the prophet as being part of the invasion. If Israel carries out the strike Netanyahu promised, the expectation is that it will trigger the Ezekiel 38 war.\nAnd that makes the current Israel-Hamas war much more important because Israel may want to surprise Iran even while it is heavily engaged with Hamas, even while it is exchanging occasional blows with Hezbollah in Lebanon, and even while it is occasionally shooting down drones and ballistic missiles launched by the Yemeni Houthis.\nThe interesting thing is that, even without an Israeli strike on Iran, there is another potential trigger scenario for the Ezekiel 38 war. For several years now, Iran has been trying establish a forward operating base in Syria for military options against Israel. If Israel is attacked from Syria in a manner that threatens its existence and it turns to the use of its nuclear weapons, that sort of strike could perfectly fulfill the prophecy about the utter destruction of Damascus in Isaiah 17 verse 1, while equally provoking the Ezekiel 38 war. In such a case, Iran may not even have to activate its Defence Pact with Russia to get Russia’s support. There are thousands of Russian soldiers inside Syria right now. Any nuclear strike on Damascus will most likely affect these soldiers and provide the grounds for Russia to fulfill what prophet Ezekiel saw in 587BC.\nAnd then there is the possibility of all out war between Israel and Hezbollah. Like I stated in an earlier article, Hamas are babies in comparison to Hezbollah. In fact, Hezbollah is far more armed than Hamas, more experienced, and more dangerous. So there could be escalation from that axis, especially as Israel moves ahead with clinical assassinations of both Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. But in spite of the grave danger Hezbollah poses to Israel, I don’t think the trigger for the Ezekiel 38 war would come from Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based. It may contribute, but I think the main trigger will be Syria. Because of the prophecy of Isaiah, which foretells the utter ruination of Damascus, the capital of Syria. The current viable theory is that this prophesied utter ruination of Damascus will be accomplished by the detonation of a nuclear weapon. And Israel is armed with nuclear weapons.\nHowever the Ezekiel 38 war begins, remember that no nation in the world will come to the aid of Israel — including the United States! And Joe Biden’s body language is compatible with the fulfillment of this aspect of the prophecy. The fact that God intervenes on behalf of Israel makes it crystal clear that the United States or any other nation does not.\nWe are living in interesting times. This is not a time for postponing the issue of the salvation of your soul.\nIf, in AD70, God dispersed the descendants of His good friend, Abraham, because of their rejection of His only begotten Son Jesus Christ (according to the prophecy of the same Jesus Christ in Luke 21:24) be sure that He will fulfill the other part that says Jerusalem shall once again be under the (complete) control of the Jews as it once was. After all, in spite of all the huddles, the Jews are now back in the land of Israel. And they reestablished Israel 1878 years after the dispersion of AD70. And they are inching closer to the total control of Jerusalem, which will coincide with the close of human probation and bring Revelation 22:11 to fulfillment.\nRevelation 22:11\n“He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.”\nOver a year ago, I watched a video claiming that Hamas will attack Israel. Guess what? Hamas attacked Israel on the 7th of October 2023. The video also claimed that Hamas will bomb the Al Aqsa mosque and try to blame it on Israel so as to galvanize support from the Islamic world.\nGuess what?\nHamas has done something similar already with the failed rocket launch that affected Al Ahli hospital in Gaza, which they blamed on Israel.\nWhat if Hamas bombs the Al Aqsa Mosque?\nBased on the Hamas lie over the bombing of the Al Ahli Hospital, many Arabs were angry and took to the streets to protest.\nWhat would happen if these people are made to believe that Israel had the temerity to bomb Islam’s third holiest site?\nI hope the video I watched is wrong on that note.\nToday is the day of salvation.\nTomorrow may just be too late.\nIn Part 4 of this series, I will attempt to conclude my thoughts on the Israel-Hamas War and show you things the mainstream media would hardly ever tell you.\nI did not write Luke 21:24, neither does it contain my words. It contains the words of Jesus Christ Himself. And He said Jerusalem shall be trodden under foot of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. During His earthly ministry, He mentioned the time of the Jews. And we know He was referring to the prophecy of Daniel 9:24-25. He again mentioned the times of the Gentiles and the formula He gave is simple. As long as Jerusalem is being trodden under foot of the Gentiles (especially after the dispersion of AD70) the world is still in the times of the Gentiles. The evidence that the times of the Gentiles have come to an end will be the day Jerusalem is no longer being trodden down (ruled) by Gentiles.\nI understand that there is a secondary application of the prophecy of Luke 21:24 (explained in Revelation 11), but just like the abomination of desolation (Matthew 24:15) has both primary and secondary applications, the primary application of Luke 21:24 is what I have explained. If you have a better explanation for that prophecy, please tell us.\nExtra:\nJust before publishing this article, I got the following breaking news which I consider worth sharing.\n1.\nBBC Lies Against Israel — Again — And Is Forced To Apologize Publicly\nOnce again the BBC publishes wrong information about Israel – and again apologizes\nBBC radio published incorrect information that Israel “executed 137 civilians in Gaza” as reported by the terrorist organization Hamas. But BBC later had to apologize. Below is their statement:\n“Sufficient effort was not made to find supporting evidence that would justify the report of Hamas’ claim. We apologize for this mistake,” the British network said.\n2.\nThe second breaking news has a direct link with the forthcoming Ezekiel 38 war, which was an important theme of today’s article. It concerns Iran.\nIran is preparing for the largest military exercise ever held in the country.\nThis exercise will involve maneuvers by the Iranian army and the Revolutionary Guards and will be considered the largest since military exercises began in Iran.\nThe Iranian army and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards are moving very large forces to the south of the country.\n3.\nThe Israeli cyber group known as WeRedEvils claims to have taken down the website of the Lebanese army and has promised to publish information about Hassan Nasrallah soon.\nFor those who may not know, Hassan Nasrallah is the leader of Hezbollah.",
