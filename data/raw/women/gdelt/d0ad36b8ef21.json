  "body_text": "Editorial: As they have proved on and off the pitch, when the going gets tough, the Girls in Green get going\nIf character or courage were the criteria alone, the Girls in Green would be winners before a ball was kicked tomorrow in their opening World Cup game against Australia.\nIreland’s Denise O’Sullivan resumed training yesterday despite ending up in hospital on Friday after a shin injury in a behind-closed-doors match with Colombia, which was abandoned after 20 minutes due to the South American team’s over-eagerness on the pitch.\nThe 29-year-old midfielder’s total commitment epitomises the esprit de corps which has won the hearts of a nation and made them the first Irish team to qualify for the game’s elite tournament.\nCommenting on the tackle that took her player down, Ireland manager Vera Pauw was as frank as ever: “Even a hand lower, she would have been out of the World Cup, for sure. And it was deliberate.”\nIf setbacks are a motivational driver then this team will be a force to be reckoned with.\nIt seems there is no obstacle the group is not prepared to tackle head on.\nAs US gymnast Simone Biles once said: “Today, do what others won’t so tomorrow you can accomplish what others can’t.”\nThis Irish team have refused to be daunted or intimidated by anything that has been thrown at them to date. When they face the host nation’s Matildas tomorrow morning in Sydney they will do so with the same never-say-die attitude that has carried them to this point.\nAs TS Eliot put it: “Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.”\nIt was as recently as August 2021, and only after the men’s squad agreed to reduce their international fees – with the FAI matching their contribution – that the women’s team’s match fee was increased, ensuring that male and female players would be paid the same.\nAt the time captain Katie McCabe, who helped broker the deal along with men’s captain Seamus Coleman, said: “This is a great day for Irish football.”\nIf it was, it was also greatly overdue. These players have been an inspiration to all and have achieved huge strides in equality to ensure male and female international players have the same opportunities.\nIt should not be forgotten that four years earlier, members of the Irish squad were obliged to change in and out of tracksuits before and after trips away because they were not allowed to keep kit.\nAt a press conference held in Liberty Hall, members of the team and their representatives from the Professional Footballers Association of Ireland (PFAI) put it up to the FAI in their quest to be treated with dignity. As then goalkeeper and captain Emma Byrne put it: “What we are fighting for here is equality.”\n“We are fighting for the future of women’s football,” she said.\nTo go from that, to competing on a global stage for the most coveted trophy in the game, is already a victory which can never be taken away.",
