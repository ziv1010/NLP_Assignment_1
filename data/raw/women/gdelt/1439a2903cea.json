With hindsight and our different experiences, we say to ourselves that we should have revealed it from the start.\n‘The message that I especially want to give is that we realise that the most important thing is happiness.’\nMore Trending\nWhen asked why they declined to go public with their relationship earlier, Abily said: ‘We were still two well-known players. We were already associated with many things. We didn’t want it to be just that.\n‘We are working together at the moment, but it won’t be like this our whole life either. We don’t work together because we are a couple. We work together because we complement each other.’\nBompastor added: ‘Revealing my life together with Camille, our relationship, after, as I say in the book, these 13 years of lies, is still a subject on which we are not entirely comfortable today.\n‘We are rather discreet and we like to have a completely normal life. Growing up, feeling attracted to a woman, not knowing what’s going on, not understanding what’s going on, not having the answers and also not having people around you with whom you can talk about the subject, it’s not easy.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Aston Villa vs Chelsea: Latest team news, predicted lineups and injuries\nMORE: Noni Madueke set to miss six Chelsea games including Arsenal clash due to injury\nMORE: Enzo Maresca urged to drop Chelsea star for Aston Villa clash",
