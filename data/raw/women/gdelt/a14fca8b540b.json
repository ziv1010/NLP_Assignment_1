  "body_text": "WNBA approves Tom Brady's minority ownership stake in Aces\nMonday, Oct. 2, 2023 | 3:53 p.m.\nThe WNBA’s Board of Governors approved former NFL legend Tom Brady’s ownership stake of the Las Vegas Aces, the league announced today.\nBrady, the 23-year NFL veteran and seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, announced on March 23 that he was acquiring an ownership interest of the defending WNBA champions.\n“Since I purchased the Aces, our goal has been to win on and off the court,” Aces governor Mark Davis said in March. “Tom Brady is a win not only for the Aces, and the WNBA, but for women’s professional sports as a whole.”\nThe partnership between Brady and Davis is also reportedly extending to the NFL, with Brady working toward a minority ownership share of the Las Vegas Raiders. National reports indicate it has not been finalized as of September. A vote could be had sometime this month.\n“I have always been a huge fan of women’s sports, and I admire the work that the Aces’ players, staff, and the WNBA continue to do to grow the sport and empower future generations of athletes,” Brady said in a statement. “To be able to contribute in any way to that mission as a member of the Aces organization is an incredible honor.”\nThe Aces will try to win back-to-back WNBA championships when they face the New York Liberty in the finals. Game 1 is Sunday at noon (ESPN) at Michelob Ultra Arena.\nDanny Webster can be reached at 702-259-8814 or [email protected]. Follow Danny on Twitter at twitter.com/DannyWebster21.",
