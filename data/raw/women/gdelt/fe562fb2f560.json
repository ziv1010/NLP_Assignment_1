And that’s coming from someone who has played it her whole life.\nWhen I spoke with a friend this week about how, in this article, I would deliver my most persuasive netball pitch, he asked if I was being sarcastic. Gobsmacked, I realised that, in truth, many might have a similar reaction.\nThere’s a prevailing stereotype about netball just being a sport you might reluctantly play at school or that it’s a slower, more static version of basketball. But considering the end-to-end action, blistering pace, and athleticism on display at netball matches it’s both a wonder and a tragedy that the sport doesn’t get more coverage.\nIn many countries across the globe, netball is the single most popular team sport for women and girls. According to Active Lives Sport England, more women regularly played netball in 2019 than all people who played rugby, with 1.4 million taking to the courts each week during the season.\nMuch like women’s football after the Lionesses Euros victory, netball participation surged following the success of the England Roses at the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Their extraordinary 52-51 win over the Australian Diamonds was a true watershed moment for the game and possibly the most entertaining hour of sport I have ever seen. Seriously, go give it a watch.\nBut the conclusion of the recent England vs Jamaica series – another spectacle of unparalleled accuracy, physicality, and suspense – served as a reminder that netball somehow never fails to surprise me.\nI simply watched awe-struck as Jamaican captain Jhaniele Fowler, standing at an impressive six foot six, scored 56 times for the Sunshine Girls in the second game to level the series at 1-1. And for anyone who needs a reminder of exactly how impressive that is, netball hoops have a diameter of just 15 inches and are without a backboard. Accuracy truly is the name of the game.\nElsewhere on the court though grit, perseverance, and speed dictate the play. On average, players change direction every 4.1 seconds and land (often on one leg) with resultant forces of up to six times their own body weight. With those playing in the centre position consistently covering over 7,000 metres per game and rarely standing still, the fluidity in netball matches is a far cry from the static image of the sport many imagine.\nThe deciding match of the series was equally tense, finishing 63-59 as the Roses wrapped up the series at London’s Copper Box Arena in front of over 6,000 jubilant fans. But the sport, which is yet to become fully professional, is undergoing a further boost in viewership after the BBC showed live coverage of each game in the series, along with the streaming of the Vitality Superleague (the top domestic tier) on the Sky Sports YouTube channel.\nSo as potential spectators, we really have no excuse. But the thrill of the sport is even more tangible with the ball in your hands. I can confidently say that a Saturday netball match leaves me more breathless, determined, and fired up at the end of a quarter than any other sport (I promise that has nothing to do with the events of Friday night).\nAs college and university teams take to the courts at Maiden Castle every weekend, the opportunities to partake in the sport are plentiful and only growing. Palatinate recently reported on the first men’s netball fixture in Durham University’s history, while Walking Netball and Disability Netball – where the ball is adapted to have a bell inside – accommodate for those with limited mobility or visual impairments.\nThe future for netball is looking brighter than ever. Last year, Sport England announced £21 million in funding over the next five years for the sport. England Netball hope to spearhead a drive towards the professionalisation of the sport, aid grass roots clubs in rebuilding after the pandemic, and crucially to retain teenage girls in the game.\nSo what are we waiting for? Head down to the courts or, when the Superleague kicks off again on February 11th, humour me and tune in to an elite netball match. There’s no denying netball surprises, but it certainly won’t disappoint.\nImage: Rugba Attah",
