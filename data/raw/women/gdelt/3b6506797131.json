I send them all my warmest congratulations for what they have achieved,” said UK Deputy Prime Minister and Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden.\n\"Our historic honours system exists to recognise these people and shine a light on their heroic contributions and achievements. I hope that the inspiring stories from across the whole of the UK encourage more people to nominate others for an honour in future,” he said.\nAmong the British Indian Officers of the Order of the British Empire (OBEs) include Baldev Parkash Bhardwaj for services to the community in Oldbury, West Midlands; Dr Dipankar Datta, Chair of the South Asia Voluntary Enterprise, for services to charity; Munir Patel, CEO of XRAIL Group, for services to rail exports; Dr Shriti Pattani, President of the Society of Occupational Medicine, for services to occupational health; Rajwinder Singh, Principal Project Sponsor of the Prison Infrastructure Team at the UK’s Ministry of Justice, for public service; Vinaichandra Guduguntla Venkatesham, CEO of Arsenal Football Club, for services to sport.\nThe Cabinet Office said more than 1,200 recipients have been awarded this year for their exceptional achievements, including Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBEs) conferred upon a cross-section including British Indians such as Dr Sanjay Bhandari, Chair of anti-racism charity Kick It Out for services to sport and Jayshree Rajkotia, Trustee and Vice Chair of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan UK, for services to Indian culture.\nOther Indian-origin recipients of MBEs include: Tajinder Kaur Banwait for services to business and to the beauty industry; Dr Manav Bhavsar for services to healthcare, particularly during Covid-19; Nilesh Bhasker Dosa for services to social equality; Dr Dinendra Singh Gill for services to pre-hospital and trauma care in Wales; Dr Gian Parkash Gopal for services to the Hindu community and to multi-faith Cohesion in Oxfordshire; Jasdeep Hari Bhajan Singh Khalsa for charitable services to the Sikh community; Dr Meenakshi Nagpaul for services to the NHS; and Satish Manilal Parmar for public service, among others.\nHealthcare and charity work also dominates among the Indian-origin Medallists of the Order of the British Empire (BEMs) such as Chandra Shekhar Biyani for services to medical education and Harbaksh Singh Grewal for services to charity.\nAmong the other high honours for 2024, Hollywood filmmaker Ridley Scott is made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the UK film industry and Welsh singer Shirley Bassey – made a Dame by the late Queen Elizabeth II – becomes the 64th living member of the Order of the Companion of Honour in recognition of her services to music.\n“This is in recognition of Dame Shirley's remarkable career which has seen her sell more than 135 million records,” the Cabinet Office said.\n“Individuals have been recognised for being dedicated community champions, role models in sport, pioneers in the arts, passionate health workers, and supporters of young people. The prime minister is committed to ensuring that honours are awarded to people across the whole of the UK, so that the honours system captures and celebrates the fantastic contribution of people throughout the country,” it added.\nOf the total, 66 per cent of the recipients are people who have undertaken outstanding work in their communities either in a voluntary or paid capacity and 48 per cent are women.\nThe sports stars honoured include England captain at the football World Cup Millie Bright is appointed an OBE, while Mary Earps and Lauren Hemp become MBEs.
