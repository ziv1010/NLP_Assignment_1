Arsene Wenger spoke out clearly saying that Manchester City should be kicked out.\nOne thing that made Man City’s situation worse at that time was that they had brought in the people who wrote FFP and reportedly told them to show Man City the way around the rules. That caused annoyance throughout football and outrage in Uefa, suggesting that Uefa were themselves duped from within by their own accountants and advisers.\nBut what really got Uefa and the Premier League exercised was that among its other financial tricks Manchester City earned £47m in 2012-13 from “selling their branding, football and other expertise” to their women’s team and their New York team – teams they already owned. So Manchester City women were being charged by Manchester City plc huge sums for their guidance and expertise in running a company Manchester City plc owned.\nSuch questioning called into doubt the honesty of the absolute ruler. In return, the owners of Manchester City declared war on Uefa and anyone else who got in their way.\nUefa had the chance to get back at Manchester City when it gave them a two-year ban from the Champions League. But Uefa itself screwed up, either deliberately because they were bribed, or through the most appalling incompetence (I’ve no idea which), by delaying the case. City won on the technicality that Uefa was out of time.\nSo City won, but the case led to a growing paranoia which led the arse-licking Sun to say in 2019 things like “‘Manchester City believe there is a campaign by Europe’s elite, including local rivals United, to bring them down’.” Among other things the Sun declared that the “FIFA fair play model is wrong”.\nIn the commentary at that time, Martin Lipton, then the Sun’s deputy head of sport, now their chief sports writer, said, “If Europe’s big guns thought they could pick Manchester City off, they know different now. The “noisy neighbours” will not be pushed around by FIFA, UEFA or anybody else.”\nIn short, the Sun was saying a conspiracy of other clubs, Fifa and Uefa had joined together to put Manchester City down and that “MANCHESTER CITY are at war with goat-loving Uefa investigations chief…”\nOf course, there is a reason why the Sun supports Manchester City, for the newspaper famously accused Liverpool supporters of being to blame for much of the outcome of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Since then many Liverpudlians and Liverpool supporters elsewhere have singularly refused to buy the Sun, and estimates suggest that the boycott of the paper by the city has cost the publishers £15m a month at 1989 prices ever since.\nSo in response the Sun looked for other causes to support in order to boost sales. And where better than with Manchester City, a club whose owner Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, as a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family has not always had the best of publicity?\nBut reading the Sun’s fairly balanced if simplistic review of yesterday’s events, it looks as if the rats know when to abandon a sinking ship. And that does lose Man City their one major outlet in the media. The claim and its supporters won’t be bothered, but it looks like it might leave them without any friends in the media. Bit like Arsenal under Arsene Wenger.\nGiven that we have been covering this tale from the start in a somewhat different way from most other commentators, you won’t be surprised to know that we’ll be continuing our review in future articles. There’s a lot more to be dug up.",
