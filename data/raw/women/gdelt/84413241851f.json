  "body_text": "The smash-hit Apple TV+ original comedy series Ted Lasso has had three successful seasons, and despite the finale to the third being the intended end of the show, there's already Ted Lasso season 4 news. Starring Saturday Night Live alumnus Jason Sudeikis in the titular role of Ted, the series follows the hapless American football coach as he attempts to turn around a struggling English soccer team. Immediately praised for its whip-smart humor and likable characters, Ted Lasso was the surprise hit of 2020.\nTed Lasso's future after season 3 was always in question, and many on the show's creative team viewed the series as a three-season story. However, the possibility of Ted Lasso season 4 was never officially ruled out, and the overwhelming popularity of the show meant it could keep going far beyond the originally intended three seasons. Ted Lasso's characters have always been its greatest asset, and no matter what the story is, it could continue on the strength of those players alone. After years of back and forth information, it's finally been confirmed that Ted Lasso season 4 is happening.\nPlease Apple, Just Tell Us What’s Going On With Ted Lasso’s Future\nWith season 3 concluding almost a year ago, Apple still haven't provided any more answers on what is happening with Ted Lasso's future.\nLatest Ted Lasso Season 4 News\nAnother Original Star Is In Talks To Return\nThe same day that Jason Sudeikis revealed the show was coming back, the latest news confirms another star is in talks to return for Ted Lasso season 4. Along with the official renewal from Apple TV+, it has also been announced that Juno Temple is in talks to return as Keeley. Along with that revelation, it has been announced that production is eyeing a July 2025 start, and will film in both Kansas City and the UK.\nTed Lasso Season 4 Is Confirmed\nSeason 4 Was Confirmed In March 2025\nShooting is expected to begin in July 2025, and will take place in Kansas City and the UK.\nNearly two years after the show went off the air following the season 3 finale, Ted Lasso season 4 was finally confirmed in March 2025. The conclusion of the series was unlike anything in TV history, and the planned ending was never treated as a true goodbye. Almost immediately after the show's conclusion, speculation began about season 4, and it finally culminated in the announcement in 2025. Shooting is expected to begin in July 2025, and will take place in Kansas City and the UK.\nTed Lasso season 3 concluded on May 31, 2023.\nTed Lasso Season 4 Cast Details\nJason Sudeikis Will Play Ted Lasso In Season 4\nAfter Ted Lasso season 3's finale, it may be slightly easier to work out which cast members could return for season 4's cast. Though the ending of season 3 gave the character a fitting conclusion, Jason Sudeikis has confirmed that he'll be back as the inspirational goofball, Ted Lasso. Considering how many members of the A.F.C Richmond squad have weighed in about their desire to return for more episodes, it seems likely that a host of returning stars will join Sudeikis in season 4.\nThe presumptive cast of Ted Lasso season 4 includes:\nTed Lasso Season 4 Story Details\nSeason 4 Will Follow A Women's Soccer Team\nWhen Jason Sudeikis announced Ted Lasso season 4 he also dropped an interesting tidbit about the story of the upcoming episodes. He specifically mentioned that it will follow a women's soccer team, but that was as detailed as he could get at the time. It's unclear if Sudeikis means the proposed A.F.C Richmond Women's Team, or if he'll be back in the USA coaching a team on his home turf. That doesn't mean the original storylines could be abandoned, and the status of A.F.C Richmond back in London could be a subplot.\nWhile they missed out on the Premier League title, the team qualified for European football via the Champions League, one of football's most prestigious tournaments. This competition was mentioned multiple times in Ted Lasso season 3, episode 12, meaning a Ted Lasso season 4 subplot centered on Roy, Nate, and Beard leading Richmond to European glory could well be a possibility. The continuation of that storyline without Ted could lead the more underutilized squad members of A.F.C Richmond to shine, with a European setting giving the series a fresh spin.\n- Release Date\n- August 14, 2020\n- Showrunner\n- Bill Lawrence\n- Writers\n- Brendan Hunt, Joe Kelly, Bill Lawrence\nCast\n-\nTed Lasso\n-\nRebecca Welton\n- Seasons\n- 3\n- Streaming Service(s)\n- AppleTV+",
