Never before have so many fixtures been fulfilled in an equivalent period.\nQualifiers for the Women’s Olympic Football Tournament Paris 2024 and UEFA Women’s Nations League games were on the agenda for European teams. Nations in the AFC, CAF and Concacaf zones, meanwhile, were involved in qualifying matches for their respective continental tournaments, with OFC representatives – with the exception of Aotearoa New Zealand – competing at the Pacific Games.\nThis plethora of events inevitably had an impact on December’s FIFA/Coca-Cola Women’s World Ranking, the last of 2023.\nConsequently, reigning world champions Spain (1st) claimed top spot for the first time. They are the fourth team in football history to reach the coveted position, after the USA (2nd, up 1), Germany and Sweden. France (3rd, up 2) make up the podium.\nEngland (4th, -) remain just below those three highflyers, ahead of previous leaders Sweden (5th, down 4). Germany (6th), the Netherlands (7th), Japan (8th), Korea DPR (9th) and Canada (10th) complete the top ten, which no longer features Brazil (11th, down 2).\nAs for the remainder of the top 50, Italy (14th, up 3), Philippines (38th, up 6) and Uzbekistan (47th, up 3) made noteworthy advances. The biggest moves came further down the standings, however, where Congo DR (102nd, up 9), El Salvador (104th, up 11) and Namibia (126th, up 14) all made considerable progress.\nIn addition to La Roja, Philippines, Haiti (51st), Cambodia (116th) and Cabo Verde (131st) attained their highest-ever placings.\nSix nations either appear for the first time (Central African Republic and Macau) or reappear (Korea DPR, American Samoa, Madagascar and Bahamas) in the World Ranking, which brings the number of teams listed to 192 – a new record! And with six other national sides just one match away from joining, it could grow even further in March.\nClick HERE (https://apo-opa.co/3uYzorx) to view the complete ranking.\nThe next FIFA/Coca-Cola Women’s World Ranking will be published in March 2024\nLeaders Spain\nMoves into top 10 Korea DPR (9th)\nMoves out of top 10 Brazil (11th)\nMatches played in total 419\nMost matches played Botswana, China PR, Chinese Taipei, Korea DPR, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia (9 matches)\nBiggest move by points Tanzania (up 68.24 points)\nBiggest move by ranks Namibia (up 14 ranks)\nBiggest drop by points Sweden (down 71.08 points)\nBiggest drop by ranks Cayman Islands (down 14 ranks)\nNewly ranked teams 6 (Korea DPR, Central African Republic, American Samoa, Macau, Madagascar, Bahamas)\nTeams that are no longer ranked None\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of FIFA.\nContact for African media:\nAfricanMedia@fifa.org\nLatest Stories\n-\n‘I wanted to be an architect but ended up as a nurse’ – Diana Hamilton reveals\n48 minutes -\nFrom wards to worship: Diana Hamilton reveals how nursing school shaped her destiny\n1 hour -\nMahama demands binding deadlines for African reparations\n2 hours -\nThis is not the time to settle political scores – Bawumia to government\n3 hours -\n5 definitive Valentine’s Day gifts to win your lover’s heart in Ghana\n3 hours -\n37% of SHS students exposed to drugs – Opare-Addo\n3 hours -\nNLC secures court injunction against striking tertiary unions\n4 hours -\nOSP says it remains guided by law after INTERPOL deletes Ofori-Atta’s Red Notice\n4 hours -\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n4 hours -\nRed Notice cancellation: OSP official fires back at Ofori-Atta’s lawyers\n5 hours -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n5 hours -\nAAG raises alarm over billboard demolitions, calls for presidential intervention\n6 hours -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n6 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n6 hours -\nCocoa crisis, galamsey complicity and election credibility to dominate this Saturday’s Newsfile\n7 hours",
