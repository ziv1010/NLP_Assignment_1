The upward revision reflects renewed investor confidence and stability under fiscal reforms, coupled with strong performance in services, agriculture, and emerging technology sectors.\nAccording to the Ghana Statistical Service, GDP expanded by 6.3% year-on-year in Q2 2025, positioning the nation among Africa’s top five fastest-growing economies. Market enthusiasm remains high as the Ghana Stock Exchange records a 67% rise in the composite index this year.\nIn a move to promote digital inclusion and youth empowerment, StarOil Ghana launched an AI Smart Lab project in the Volta/Oti region. The initiative aims to equip young people with critical digital and innovation skills, aligning with Ghana’s broader ambition to become a tech-driven economy.\nMeanwhile, national attention has turned to Parliament’s renewed debate over the anti-LGBTQ+ bill, drawing reactions from international partners. Economic analysts warn the bill’s passage could impact foreign aid and donor-linked inflows, estimated at over $3 billion annually.\nOn the environmental front, the government has introduced a permanent military task force to combat illegal mining. The move is part of Ghana’s intensified effort to protect rivers and forests from galamsey destruction — a step applauded by conservation groups nationwide.\nIn sports, Ghana’s Black Stars face Comoros in a crucial FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifier tonight in Accra. The match has generated nationwide anticipation as Ghana looks to reclaim dominance in African football. Meanwhile, boxing star Martin Bakole has challenged Anthony Joshua to a “Rumble in the Jungle II,” potentially to be hosted in Ghana or Nigeria.\nThe creative and entertainment sectors are also thriving, with Afro-fusion concerts, cultural expos, and collaborations putting Ghanaian talent on the global map. Across the Atlantic, the 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair in London (October 16–19) will showcase African artists redefining post-colonial creativity.\nThe feature also spotlights President John Dramani Mahama’s participation in Beijing’s Global Leaders’ Meeting on Women, reaffirming Ghana’s leadership in gender and development advocacy within the African Union framework.\nElsewhere in Africa, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) has launched a Digital Payments Platform to boost intra-African trade, while Côte d’Ivoire embarks on an urban modernization project naming thousands of streets to enhance logistics and identity.\nHowever, challenges remain. Cocoa prices have slumped to a 20-month low, impacting Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire’s export earnings. Analysts link this to favorable harvests and global supply corrections, creating both risks and opportunities for local farmers.\nGlobally, Europe has pledged $600 billion for renewable energy infrastructure in Africa under its Global Gateway initiative, while South Africa has attracted strong investor interest with over 100 proposals for its new foreign-currency financing program.\nFinally, the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet) has issued warnings of potential flooding across southern Ghana, urging citizens to remain vigilant amid intensifying rainfall — a reminder of climate change’s growing toll on African development.\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of Talentz MEDIA.\nAdditional Information:\nhttps://apo-opa.co/4ouoCzu\nMedia Contact:\nTalentz MEDIA\nOfficial Address: Obonu St, North Kaneshie, Accra, Ghana\nPhone: +233 546 171 240\nEmail: info@talentzmedia.com\nSocial Media:\n@ talentzmedia\nAbout Talentz MEDIA:\nTalentz MEDIA is a dynamic Ghana-based media and creative communications company dedicated to promoting African stories, innovation, and entertainment globally.
