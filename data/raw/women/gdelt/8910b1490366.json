  "body_text": "Sarai Bareman, FIFA’s chief women’s football officer, believes issues over when players should be released by clubs for this summer’s Women’s World Cup shows that the game is growing.\nClub versus country tensions threatened to derail plans for national teams competing at the tournament in Australia and New Zealand until FIFA and the European Club Association (ECA) reached an agreement last month.\nAdvertisement\nThe original date of July 10 — 10 days before the tournament kicks off — had prompted concerns over player welfare and injury risk with the tight schedule.\nBut while that remains the mandatory release date, a compromise was reached so that players can now be released from the earlier dates of June 23-29.\nBareman, who attended the European Club Association’a first summit on Women’s football in London on Monday, has put the previous disagreements down to “growing pains” due to the rise of women’s football.\n“I think this is one of the growing pains,” Bareman told The Athletic. “And I say that in a positive way. As our game starts to grow, the pressure, particularly at the elite end on individual players, clubs and the national associations starts to build. These kind of issues are going to come out of the woodwork.\n“I think it’s positive, I know a lot of people don’t see it that way, but it means that we’re able to highlight these things and effectively they’re happening because the evolution of our game is so fast. We launched the current calendar in 2018. Since then to see how much the game has moved forward is remarkable.\n“There is a beautiful collaborative spirit in the women’s game. That’s happening here with player release. We worked very closely with ECA. Of course, regulations are regulations, they’re in place for a reason, they’re black and white. But wherever possible, we try to encourage collaborative conversations and really making sure the player is at the centre of those, there are regulations.”\nClaire Bloomfield, ECA head of women’s football, added: “It’s great now that some of these concerns and issues on all sides, the pinch points that everybody experiences, have been aired now.”\nCharlie Marshall, ECA CEO, is hoping the football calendar will be a lot more clearer from 2025 onwards.\nAdvertisement\n“That core objective of making sure that now in the future, we have made our point and the framework that gets developed for the international matches post 2025 we would fully expect to have a much more considered, reliable, robust framework for player releasing.”\nFollow the Women’s World Cup coverage on The Athletic for related stories, news and more.\n(Photo: Getty Images)",
