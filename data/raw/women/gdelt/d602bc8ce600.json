Like when an inswinging corner drops on top of a goalkeeper, her attempt to punch it clear only gets as far as the back post, and an unmarked centre-half is waiting for a tap-in.\nYou knew Steph Houghton was delighted from the knee-slide, arms outstretched, ready to receive the many embraces of her Manchester City team-mates. It was not just her first goal of the season, not just the first of her comeback from a devastating injury, but also a goal on her 35th birthday. St George’s Day, no less.\nAdvertisement\nPredictably, after Houghton scored City’s fifth in an eventual 6-2 win over West Ham, the vocal section of the Academy Stadium’s home support broke into a chant: “Are you watching Eng-er-land?”\nAnd once that was done, there came a lone, loud and pointed shout. “Are you watching Sarina?!”\nThat question is seemingly never far away when it comes to Houghton and, given the events of the past week, it is certain to be asked again between now and July.\nLeah Williamson, Houghton’s successor as England captain, will miss the World Cup having suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury, depriving Sarina Wiegman of both a commanding presence in the centre of defence and a natural leader.\nGO DEEPER\nThe impact of Leah Williamson's absence will be significant on and off the pitch\nHoughton will not only feel a great deal of sympathy for Williamson but empathy too, being no stranger to missing out on major tournaments herself.\nThe same injury denied her a place at the 2009 European Championship and left her fearing her career would meet a premature end. Two years earlier, she broke her leg in a training session before the 2007 World Cup in China.\nThen there is the more recent, more relevant parallel — last year she failed to convince Wiegman of her fitness after surgery on a recurring Achilles problem. First, that injury cost Houghton the captaincy, with Williamson her replacement. Then she was cut from Wiegman’s provisional 28-player Euros squad.\nThat was Houghton’s last international call-up. Her last cap was more than two years ago, before the Wiegman era even began.\nEngland have since won a major tournament, embarked on a 30-game unbeaten run and will travel to their base camp on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast in July as the closest challengers to the United States, the reigning world champions. It is hard not to conclude that, in Houghton’s absence, the team has moved on.\nAdvertisement\nYet the question of her returning still lingers, to the point where even Houghton, as hard as she has worked over the past year to win her place back, would like “closure” on the matter, as she said in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live earlier this month.\nA day later, Wiegman came about as close as diplomatically possible to giving the former England captain a definitive answer. Houghton’s chances of a recall were “not that high”, she said.\nThere was a caveat, though. “If things happen for some players, that situation changes.” It is fair to say things have now happened for some players.\nAs well as Williamson, Millie Bright remains sidelined with the knee injury that ruled her out of April’s meetings with Brazil and Australia. England’s vice-captain will be out for “weeks” according to Emma Hayes, although the Chelsea manager refused to specify how many.\nOn Sunday, an early injury scare for Alex Greenwood — Bright’s centre-back partner for England; Houghton’s at City — was a reminder of the tightrope World Cup hopefuls are walking at the climax of the Women’s Super League season.\nA couple more enforced absences at the back would give Wiegman a headache. The England manager herself said the door had not closed on Houghton’s return in such circumstances. So, if it is still not fully open, is it at least slightly ajar?\nHoughton’s form is the greatest argument in her favour and, while her manager Gareth Taylor is in no way about to start picking Wiegman’s World Cup squad for her, he only speaks highly of how she is playing since returning to City’s starting line-up in February.\n“We’re really pleased to have her,” Taylor said after the win over West Ham. “I think she’s playing some of her best football that we’ve seen. She’s playing really well and it goes without saying what she brings.”\nTaylor was referencing Houghton’s experience — the attribute that advocates for an England return often point to. All 35 years of it were on display on Sunday, in her own penalty box as well as West Ham’s.\nAdvertisement\n“As a personality around the place, I think she’s great for this young group of players we have,” Taylor said. “We know she’s not going to be able to go on in a playing capacity forever, but at the moment I think she’s contributing really highly on and off the pitch.”\nAny return would have to be on merit, as Houghton has always accepted, hence her disappointment at her phone not ringing last month after a sustained run of starts.\nYet her cause is not helped by the fact that, even with Williamson ruled out, Wiegman is hardly short of alternatives. Esme Morgan and Maya Le Tissier were selected ahead of Houghton for the last camp. When Bright’s injury forced her to withdraw, Lotte Wubben-Moy was favoured over the former captain.\nWiegman’s options do not end there. The versatile Jess Carter is capable of filling in at centre-half if needed, while Millie Turner’s performances at table-topping Manchester United and Anna Patten’s at Aston Villa are garnering deserved attention.\nAs it stands, despite Houghton’s form, experience and leadership qualities, all of those feel likelier alternatives than Wiegman deviating from the assured and pragmatic approach to management that has proved wildly successful, no matter how unsentimental it can be.\nJust ask Mandy van den Berg, Wiegman’s captain at the start of her tenure with the Netherlands.\nVan den Berg already knew Wiegman from their time at ADO Den Haag and she started the opening games of Euro 2017, Wiegman’s first in charge, only to be substituted, dropped and then left out for the rest of the tournament, making two appearances from the bench — one in the last minute of the final to lift the trophy. To this day, it remains Van den Berg’s last international appearance.\nWiegman’s judgments on players can be uncompromising but she has shown no reason for that judgment to be doubted. Houghton can only maintain her form over City’s final four games and hope that, one way or another, a route back opens up.\nAdvertisement\nThere would be a strange, bittersweet symmetry to England’s World Cup campaign if Williamson’s injury led to Houghton’s return, after Houghton’s injury led to Williamson’s rise. Sometimes, in this sport, things just fall into place. More often than not though, it is far more complicated than that.\n(Top photo: James Gill – Danehouse/Getty Images)",
