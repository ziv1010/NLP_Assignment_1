  "body_text": "It’s been a busy week for Barcelona.\nYesterday we published the first batch of answers to the many questions you sent in for our two Barca correspondents, Laia Cervelló Herrero and Pol Ballús.\nYou wanted to know more about Hansi Flick’s dressing-room lock-in and his “egos kill success comments” following the 1-1 draw at Rayo Vallecano before the international break. Then there was the chaotic last-minute switch to hosting Sunday’s La Liga game against Valencia at the 6,000-capacity stadium by Barca’s training ground.\nAdvertisement\nThose are just two of the hot topics around the Spanish champions right now. In fact, there’s so much to talk about that we decided to publish two Q&A articles this week. Here’s the second — and we’ll be back to answer more questions from you regularly this season.\nVarious headlines about the private life of Lamine Yamal are constantly generated, about parties, women etc. He still seems a carefree enough kid not to be bothered by all that and professional enough in training to reach the heights like he’s doing at the moment.\nHowever, you might say that there is not one good example of a player being able to manage this kind of a lifestyle while also reaching the level of likes such as Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mohamed Salah. And he was apparently boasting his dream isn’t to win the Ballon d’Or but to win many such as the former two. Are there any concerns and what do you think about it? — Benjamin W.\nLaia Cervelló Herrero: Barca fans and those close to the club are very long-suffering, and to say there is no concern at all would be a lie. This is surely because there have been cases of players such as Ronaldinho who did not want to give up enjoying their youth for football, and although his time at the club was intense and still remembered by fans, it was shorter than it could have been.\nFirst and foremost, it must be remembered that Yamal’s case is unprecedented. No footballer has ever achieved his level of influence and global notoriety at such a young age. He has just turned 18 and has already been instrumental in winning a La Liga title, a Copa del Rey and reaching the Champions League semi-finals for Barcelona, as well as a European Championship for Spain. He is a rare gem.\nYamal is a player so unconcerned by such things that he even fell asleep on the bus on the way to the Euro 2024 final, while his team-mates were overcome with nerves.\nAdvertisement\nHe became world famous without being old enough to drive and while still wearing braces. And now he is one of the favourites to win this year’s Ballon d’Or. What would we, any of us, have done in his place? It is difficult to ask him not to enjoy his age.\nThe thing is, as you say, it doesn’t seem to affect him at all. I think that, because of the life he has had so far, he is able to appreciate what he has because he knows what it is like not to have it, to live without privileges. He gives the impression of having lived much more than his young age would suggest. It comes across when he speaks.\nHe makes headlines, that’s true. About parties, that’s true. But he also said recently in an interview on the podcast series run by Spanish journalist Jose Ramon de la Morena that what has made him happiest in his career has been providing financial security for his family. That doesn’t sound like someone who is going to lose control.\nWe have to give him time to see where he goes from here. Spain manager Luis de la Fuente said at a press conference a few days ago: “He’s a lad who is now 18, he worked as hard as anyone, he took care of himself like no other and he has enormous talent. What he has achieved is thanks to that, not because he throws a party or makes a gesture. Let’s value values, please.”\nI think he’s right.\nWish you guys would cover more about the sports, the players. So my questions are: what’s the latest with the spat of injuries regarding Gavi and FDJ? Why do you think Raphinha was called up when Brazil had already qualified and will he be in a position to play this weekend? And on Raphinha re-joining, how long is his contract for? Any news if anyone from Barca Atletic may play this weekend considering how thin the roster is now ? — Futbol G.\nLaia Cervelló Herrero: We’ll take your suggestion into account! As for your questions about Gavi and Frenkie de Jong’s injuries, the former is more worrying than the latter. The Dutchman will be fit for the Valencia match, but I don’t think he’ll be playing. He has a minor injury to the external obturator muscle in his right thigh, so I don’t think he’ll be out of the team for long.\nAdvertisement\nGavi, meanwhile, has problems with the meniscus in his operated knee. Right now, his priority is to avoid surgery, and to that end he is following a conservative approach, but nothing has been ruled out. The player is sad, as this was supposed to be the season in which he would regain some momentum by playing matches consistently in order to recover, as far as possible, the role he once had in the team.\nAs for Raphinha, that’s an excellent question to ask Carlo Ancelotti. He decided to rest Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Eder Militao but perhaps forgot about Raphinha.\nI don’t know how Raphinha feels about having to travel thousands of miles to play a midweek dead-rubber international at high-altitude in the mountains of Bolivia, but I don’t think he’d be very happy about it. To answer your other question, his contract with the club runs until 2028, having been renewed for three years in May.\nAs for Barca Atletic players who could make the step up, I think there is one we should all take note of: 18-year-old Jofre Torrents. He is a left-back who is standing out in the reserve team and, with Alejandro Balde out injured, I think he could get some playing time in the next few games. He is a club investment. Gerard Martin is ahead of him at the moment, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Flick gave him a run if results allow it.\nAfter the Covid-19 pandemic, football clubs had to face financial challenges, especially Barcelona. Wouldn’t it have been better to postpone the Camp Nou project until the club became more financially stable? — Izo.\nPol Ballús: When would Barcelona have been in a more stable position, though? Would this have been soon enough for the urgent demands of the Camp Nou to be revamped?\nPossibly there is a question to make on why Barca didn’t conduct the renovations before, when the club were in a stronger financial position. Why, back in the day, did the board not take the Neymar money and invest that in the works instead?\nRight now, Barcelona’s long-term debt is set at over €1bn, and that’s not including the new stadium costs, which are currently projected to be about €1.5bn.\nAdvertisement\nIt is not ideal to have added more debt, and the pandemic hit was the perfect storm for the club, but Barcelona were really at crossroads on what to do regarding the Camp Nou when Joan Laporta was re-elected as president in 2021, and he has spoken several times about how important increased revenues from the new stadium will be in settling the club’s rocky finances.\nAs a North American, can you explain to me the ludicrousness of transfers? How can Liverpool spend €482million in this past summer transfer window? And in La Liga, Real spent €180 million and Atletico €170million? How can newly-promoted teams ever expect to compete? Is this just “invisible” money? And can you explain Barca’s situation? — Jeff G.\nPol Ballús: I will have to keep it short(ish) and simple, but you can also check out Chris Weatherspoon’s great piece on why Liverpool could spend big this summer.\nFirst of all, there’s the TV rights distribution. The Premier League does not just get way more money than La Liga for their TV rights, they also distribute more equally, meaning the smaller teams have a bigger platform to work with than their Spanish equivalents. That explains the hurdles newly-promoted clubs will always have in La Liga.\nThen there’s player sales to take into account. Liverpool, and other English clubs, could spend big because they sold big. In that department, English clubs are, in a way, blessed and cursed by the Premier League’s spending rules. They need to have a quota of homegrown players, which makes any player formed in England more expensive. And if a player is Premier League-proven, there is also less hesitation to pay big sums of money to other domestic clubs.\nMeanwhile, clubs such as Barcelona and Real Madrid, who are member-owned, simply can’t have one owner who single-handledly puts money into the club. That task would belong to their members, and they don’t tend to be billionaires (and even less people who give big sums of money away for other people to handle it).\nAnd finally, there is the key factor of La Liga’s own regulations on clubs’ finances.\nThe Spanish competition’s salary limit rules basically set the amount of money teams are allowed to spend on player’s wages. This limit is calculated individually for each club, according to their revenues. If a team is above that, they face severe limitations to register new signings, and they would have to offload salaries, or increase their revenue, first.\nAdvertisement\nBarcelona are in that situation. They could spend money on signings, but they would not be allowed to register them because of La Liga’s own regulations — which were made to avoid clubs going bust. Hence their creative solutions to getting Rashford and other new arrivals eligible to play for 2025-26.\nWhy can’t The Athletic spell Barça properly? I know it’s not a typographical limitation or a Style Book prohibition: the ç is used prolifically in the NYT when required in a French context. If Barça is verboten because your editor is from Madrid or something, then why don’t you guys use Barcelona instead? Barca just sounds ludicrous. — Joaquin V.\nLaia Cervelló Herrero: I can absolutely see your point. I’m Catalan and I agree with you, but it goes against our style guide, unfortunately. On The Athletic’s football (soccer) coverage, we don’t use accents at all (at least, that is the official policy, you might notice a small exception on our bylines). In our U.S. sports coverage, they are used.\nI understand that might sound strange… but no, our editor is not from Madrid! (he’s a Middlesbrough fan from London).\n(Jose Breton/Pics Action/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
