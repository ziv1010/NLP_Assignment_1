I've always dreamed of being on lists like this and to be nominated, so it's a step in the right direction.\"\nThe ceremony takes place on Monday at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris at 19:45 GMT.\nLyon striker Ada Hegerberg won the inaugural Ballon d'Or in 2018 and since then Barcelona captain Alexia Putellas has won the award twice. Retired American forward Megan Rapinoe was honoured in 2019 and Spain international Aitana Bonmati was crowned last year. There was no award in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"If you had told me 10 years ago, that I would be in this position, I would probably have laughed at you,\" City and Jamaica striker Shaw told BBC Sport.\n\"It goes to show that the game is evolving and we're growing. It's an individual award but the players I have around me make me look good.\n\"It's a special moment for us [at City]. All our efforts and hard work is being recognised.\"\nWho are the favourites for the 2024 Ballon d'Or?\n- Published24 October 2024\nMan City's Shaw on inspiring Jamaica's footballers\n- Published3 October 2024\n'The sky is the limit for Hemp'\nShaw finished top scorer in the Women's Super League last season but Manchester City missed out on the title on goal difference.\nShe was also named the PFA Women's Players' Player of the Year and the FWA Women's Footballer of the Year.\n\"She's such a fox in the box,\" said Hemp. \"In the seasons I've played with her, she's come out on top and always finishes top goalscorer. She is great to have in the team.\"\nShaw said any of her team-mates could have been nominated after a strong year for City, despite not delivering any silverware.\n\"A lot of players in our team could be on that list,\" added the 27-year-old. \"The overall effort we put in every day to not just score goals but improve.\n\"I am hard on Hemp. If she gives me a bad cross, I am going to be on her. If I don't score, she will do the same.\n\"She is a grafter and she buzzes around the pitch. She is an unbelievable player. I just know when she is out there, I have to be ready.\n\"I love playing with her. I enjoy it each and every day. The sky is the limit for Hempo.\"\nHemp said it usually takes her a \"long time\" to process her achievements but she has already realised the significance of being nominated for the Ballon d'Or.\n\"We're surrounded by amazing players week-in, week-out,\" she added. \"It pushes us on to be so much better.\n\"I take a lot of pride in being a grafter, like Shaw says, and giving my all every single time I put on that shirt.\n\"If everyone is playing well, it makes me feel like I've playing well too. It's a really proud moment.\"",
