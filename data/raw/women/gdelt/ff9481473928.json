  "body_text": "WWE is giving the team a little break for Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa/Winter Solstice. For the SmackDown crew, that means next Friday off*. And that meant taping the Dec. 20 episode after they wrapped up the live episode that aired last night (Dec. 13) from Hartford, Connecticut’s XL Center.\nWWE SmackDown SPOILERS for Dec. 20: SNME fallout, Women’s Tag title match, Santa Braun, more!\nCurrently advertised for the show: Bianca Belair and her new partner — and new WWE Women’s Tag Team champion — Naomi will defend their belts against Nia Jax & Candice LeRae, while the men’s Tag title program continues with a singles match between champion DIY’s Johnny Gargano and MCMG’s Alex Shelley. Plus, the just-returned and freshly-tranferred Braun Strowman will be the guest on The Grayson Waller Effect.\nHere’s how that went, along with some details about what else went down, courtesy of SPOILERS from ITRWrestling and fans in attendance who posted on social media:\n- A Kevin Owens car promo was played, and the segment ended with KO and Cody Rhodes brawling. So, as ITR’s report puts it, “it looks like their feud won’t be resolved at Saturday Night’s Main Event”.\n- Drew McIntyre is in the ring with The New Bloodline when Jimmy Uso attacks him from behind with his crutch. Uso follows McIntyre into the seats as the babyface entrances start for The Bloodline’s trios match...\n- The New Bloodline (Solo Sikoa, Jacob Fatu & Tama Tonga) def. LA Knight, Apollo Crews & Andrade\n- Bianca Belair & Naomi (c) def. Nia Jax & Candice LeRae to retain the WWE Womens Tag titles\n- Johnny Gargano (entering to a new DIY theme song since he & Tommaso Ciampa are now heels) def. Alex Shelley\n- Braun Strowman shows up for The Grayson Waller Effect dressed as Santa Claus. Carmelo Hayes crashes the segment, leading to a rematch of their match from last night...\n- Carmelo Hayes def. Braun Strowman\nSound like a good way to take a couple hours away from the hustle and bustle of the holiday season next Friday night (if you won’t be watching Notre Dame vs. Indiana in the College Football Playoff, that is)?\n* Team Raw gets Dec. 23 off, and they’ll tape that episode after the Mon., Dec. 16 one airs. Spoilers are here, if you’re interested.",
