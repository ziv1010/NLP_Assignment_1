I mean, a final. That’s cool. I think again we’re creating history with the club. So, no, I’m buzzing.”\nShe continued, “we knew that it was going to be a tough game and maybe a [single goal was going] to decide the game. The pitch is a bit scrappy today and we knew that if we pressed hard we were going to get some opportunities. We did, so it was good.”\nTerland lamented her recent form and claimed, “I haven’t been getting the ball as much as I want in the box lately. Once I do, I do my job. That’s what I’m supposed to do. Today what stands out for me is the way we defend – we defend the whole game. I want to highlight the team for that. It’s not easy to score a goal, but the defensive work is what won us the game. I’m proud of the group.”\nShe finished by stating, “it feels great. The final – that’s cool. We’re creating history with the club.”\nEllen Wangerheim\nThe Swede started her first match since completing a move to United last Friday.\nSpeaking after the match, she stressed how happy she was, claiming it felt “amazing. We made a really good team effort today and everyone was running a lot. So, feels amazing to be in the final.”\nShe also explained that working hard off the ball was vital to “work for the badge” and that they discussed the need before the match to work hard for each other off the ball. Wangerheim was also asked about how the team felt in the final 20 minutes knowing they were so close to history.\nShe asserted, “I think it is that you just don’t want the ball in the like in our own box. So, you just want to get it away and try to keep the ball in possession. Uh, it was hard in the last like 15 minutes, but we tried and yeah, we are in the final.”\nMarc Skinner\nThe United boss was understandably delighted with his side’s effort and was full of compliments for his squad after making history.\nSkinner was taking charge of his 150th match at the helm at United, but he decided to focus more on his team’s efforts.\nMarc will take charge of his 150th United game tonight 💪 pic.twitter.com/ewHyrIyo11\n— Manchester United Women (@ManUtdWomen) January 21, 2026\nHe claimed, “to see the team do that is a really proud moment and I’m happy with the just the team spirit. If you give me anything, give me beautiful football. I would take team spirit and togetherness and commitment over any football because football can come and go with that spirit. But if you’ve got a spirit, you can create something special. Tonight we’ve done that.”\nSkinner also focused on the complex challenge of Chelsea in the final but claimed his side will “give it our absolute all” and they need to remember that they have just beaten the European champions in the shape of Arsenal to make the final. He also praised the numerous fans who made the trip down to London in the pouring rain for the match and said that he was ecstatic that his side could “keep creating history for them.”\nThe manager was happy with how his team weathered an intense Arsenal storm of pressure at times, but claimed he would still like to see his side being better on the ball in key moments.\nHe did praise his side’s defensive strength though, stating, “if you’re going to come against a team and try and attack a team like Manchester United like us, you’re always going to find it difficult. I think that’s three clean sheets we’ve had against Arsenal in the three games we’ve played so far. So really credit to all the players and the staff and everyone involved with Manchester United.”\n[ Y] Evergreen suggestion: add a link to “Every Norwegian to play for Man United” — https://thepeoplesperson.com/2025/11/30/every-norwegian-to-play-for-man-united-301695/ (because Elisabeth Terland is Norwegian and featured in this article).[/Y]\nFeatured image Michael Campanella via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
