He said: \"We’ve always known he wouldn’t be able to attend, sadly, due to his diary.\nHe has been a brilliant supporter of the team throughout. He came to see the team before we left and he’s been sending messages of support throughout.\nCulture Secretary Lucy Frazer, who did travel to Australia for the game, also defended the Prince from criticism, as she said: \"I think the Royal Family do a tremendous amount for the country in so many spheres, including in sport.\n\"Prince William is, of course, the president of the FA and is a tremendous supporter of the sport. I know he's disappointed that he isn't able to be here today but he has sent a message of good luck to the Lionesses.\"\n\"I'm sure that on their return, win or lose, he will be congratulating them on how they've done in this competition.\"\nIt's been suggested by some royal experts that the reason Prince William was unable to attend the game, was due to the fact that his father King Charles has yet to visit the country since becoming King.\nRoyal protocol states that William would be unable to visit the Commonwealth country until his father has done so.\nAnd others have argued that jetting off to Australia for a rather short visit would be could call into question the legitimacy of his eco-friendly credentials and would be damaging to both his own reputation and that of the Earthshot Prize.\nDespite these potential reasons for his absence, criticism of William has continued, with controversial broadcaster Piers Morgan tweeting: \"With respect, YRH (Your Royal Highness), you should have got on a plane.\n\"Ridiculous that the Queen of Spain is attending the World Cup Final to support her nation's team, and you won't be there despite being President of the FA.\"\nWhile former England goalkeeper Pauline Cope also said: \"I will not have any bad words against the royal family.\n\"However this should have been pencilled in his diary from day dot, after we won the Euros and qualified for the World Cup.\"",
