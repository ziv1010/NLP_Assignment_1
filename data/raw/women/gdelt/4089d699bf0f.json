I think it's an attractive final, a great final, and hopefully it's third time lucky.\"\nBarcelona and Lyon have shared the last eight Champions League trophies between them, and although nobody doubts the Catalans' quality, until they beat the French giants a feeling of unfinished business remains.\n\"Lyon will still be the best, they have eight Champions Leagues, it's incredible what they've done,\" acknowledged Guijarro.\n\"Lyon is Lyon, (their record) will never... well, not never -- for now we can't change that, hopefully one day, but there's a long way to go.\"\nBarcelona first faced Lyon in the quarter-finals back in 2018, losing the first leg 2-1 and the second leg 1-0, outclassed by an opponent that was at the time, at the peak of their power.\n'Worst possible way'\nThey met again in Budapest, Hungary in 2019 as Barcelona became the first Spanish side to reach the final.\nDzsenifer Marozsan opened the scoring for Lyon after five minutes and then Norwegian striker Ada Hegerberg hit a hat-trick before the half-hour mark to leave Barcelona shattered.\nAsisat Oshoala netted a late consolation as Barcelona fell to a stinging 4-1 defeat.\n\"Our first final ended in the worst possible way,\" said Barcelona midfielder Alexia Putellas.\n\"It was very painful in the short term but in the long term I think it was good in some ways, because it showed us where we were as a team in terms of the level we needed to become European champions.\"\nHowever a run of five consecutive Lyon Champions League triumphs was eventually snapped by Barcelona in 2021, as the Catalans lifted their first by thrashing Chelsea.\nPlaying attractive, attacking football and boasting stars including Putellas and Jenni Hermoso, Barcelona benefitted from thousands of travelling supporters and the club's illustrious name.\nOn the way to the final the following year Barcelona set two world record attendances for women's football, packing Camp Nou with over 90,000 fans for matches against Real Madrid and Wolfsburg.\nMany labelled them favourites when they took on Lyon in the 2022 final, which angered the French side, pioneers in the game.\n\"There was women's football before Barcelona, and it was played here for years,\" said Hegerberg.\nFired up, Lyon came out of the blocks rapidly in Turin and took the lead through Amandine Henry's long-range rocket, with Hegerberg and Catarina Macario strikes giving the French side a three-goal lead after 33 minutes.\nIt was a familiar feeling for Barcelona, wounded by Lyon's high press and physicality, and although Putellas pulled one back, they fell short once more in the 3-1 defeat.\nIt was the fourth time the teams had met, each ending in a defeat for the Spanish side against the record champions of Europe, Lyon scoring 10 times to Barcelona's three.\nThe manner Lyon have swatted Barca aside time and again has added to the Spanish champions' determination to land a blow back this weekend.\n\"There's that small slice of revenge after losing those two finals, albeit from a position of respect,\" said veteran Barcelona defender Marta Torrejon, at the club since 2013.\n\"They are a great opponent and it will be a tough game, but we can't wait for it.\"\n© 2024 AFP",
