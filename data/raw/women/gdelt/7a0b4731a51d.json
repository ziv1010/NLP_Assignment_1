  "body_text": "A number of Liverpool Women returned from the latest international break with injuries, unfortunately. While the holiday break is on the horizon, there are still three matches in December to get through, and these losses on top of the injuries the squad are already dealing with will make a tough season even harder.\nMatt Beard Provides Injury Updates On Gemma Evans, Hannah Silcock, and Marie Höbinger\nThe Women’s campaign begins against on Sunday against Manchester United.\n“We’ve lost Marie Höbinger, she’ll have a scan in the next day or so. She has done her groin,” said manager Matt Beard at his pre-match press conference on Friday, delivering the first blow.\n“Gemma Evans has come back with concussion after a clash with Leanne Kiernan, and then obviously Hannah Silcock got concussion playing for England.\n“[A] big blow. We haven’t got any of the others back that were injured, apart from Jas Matthews as well. Rachael Laws had a little bit of a reaction yesterday.\n“It has been a bit frustrating, the injuries just keep mounting up.”\nOne bright spot in the deflating news was that teenager Zara Shaw will be getting the start on Sunday in midfield after her impressive performance against Newcastle last month.\n“She’ll get that starting berth on Sunday,” continued Beard.\n“I thought she was excellent against Newcastle, she had a fantastic [U17] World Cup. She’s a dream to work with. When she did her ACL [last year], the way she went about it was so mature, so positive. She’s a fantastic talent, she’s going to be a great player in the future.\n“If I could have played her at 15 years old, I would have played her because she was ready then. Obviously it was disappointing for her to get that ACL injury in that first pre-season game last year, which meant she missed virtually a whole season of football.\n“I just feel since she’s come back from the World Cup, it’s a completely different person and player. The stability and the minutes, and the highs and lows of the tournament, I think it has shaped her and we’re really pleased with how she’s developing.”\nAnother positive note comes from the news that Tegan Micah will also be available on Sunday, following the news that Rachael Laws is still recovering. Australia requested for the goalkeeper to stay on for a couple more games but she is able to stay on Merseyside and help out the squad.\nLiverpool face Manchester United on Sunday, visiting Leigh Sports Village at 12pm GMT.
