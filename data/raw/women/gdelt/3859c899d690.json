  "body_text": "Liverpool won the 2024-25 Premier League with a month to spare, and a big part of that 20th domestic league title is thanks to star Mohamed Salah.\nMohamed Salah Dominates FWA Player of the Season Voting\nLiverpool star Salah collected 90% of possible first place votes with teammate Virgil van Dijk finishing second.\nThe Reds’ Egyptian King scored 28 goals and 18 assists in the league—and a staggering 33 and 23 in all competitions—in what will go down as one of the all time great seasons in English football for an attacker.\nIt’s a season that makes Salah the likely current frontrunner for the Ballon d’Or, and beyond that he is expected by most to sweep the English individual awards.\nHe picked up his first on that front today, being named the Football Writers’ Player of the year with a whopping 90% of the vote—the most for any player this century. Teammate Virgil van Dijk finished a distant second in voting.\n“Winning the Premier League and to have had such an impact in the team, I have never felt this much happiness in the club,” said Salah. “When I came into the season, it was like, Will I be able to do it again?\n“I had that conversation with myself and said, Okay, let’s find out. You need to work hard, set the example. I was doing my job and I think I did it very well.\n“We have a very good group of players and a very good manager. We started the season well and now we won the Premier League. Hopefully we can win the Premier League again and also the Champions League.”\nAlong with Salah and runner-up Van Dijk, Newcastle’s Alexander Isak and Arsenal’s Declan Rice also received first place votes. Arsenal’s Alessia Russo won the FWA prize for Women’s Player of the Season.",
