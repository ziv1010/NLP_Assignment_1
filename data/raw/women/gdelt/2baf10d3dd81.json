Brackets are finally locked, and the first game of NCAA March Madness 2024 has tipped off.\nWhat school has the best shot this year? To find out, we consulted the experts at SportsLine for their picks for which teams could win the Big Dance. Keep reading for our experts' top March Madness picks -- and for all the information you need to watch every March Madness game this year.\nNote: CBS Essentials, CBS, Paramount+ and Sportsline are all subsidiaries of Paramount. CBS is one of the broadcast homes of the 2024 men's March Madness tournament.\nWho will win March Madness 2024? Experts sound off\nWe asked the college basketball experts at SportsLine to share their top picks to win the 2024 NCAA men's tournament.\nBruce Marshall's pick to win: Tennessee\n\"The Vols have always bumped their heads into the ceiling at the Sweet 16 for Rick Barnes, and UT is still to reach a Final Four in its hoops history. So why can these Vols do what some of the past Knoxville contenders coached by Ray Mears, Don DeVoe, Bruce Pearl (and previous to this year, Barnes) couldn't?\n\"It's a unique personnel mix boosted by Northern Colorado transfer wing Dalton Knecht (21.1 ppg), who flourished when surrounded by better athletes than he was paired with in the Big Sky. Knecht's versatility added a very sharp edge to a lineup that is customarily rugged in the paint and also features a veteran PG in Zakai Zeigler. Finishing atop the regular-season table in the rugged SEC while beating every contender in the loop, with many of those wins on the road, further suggests the Vols are built for an extended run in March. The early exit at the tourney in Nashville might prove a blessing in disguise, as UT was spared extra wear and tear last weekend.\n\"The Vols will never have a better chance than right now for their fans to sing Rocky Top at the Final Four and finally kick down that championship door.\"\nEric Cohen's pick to win: UConn\n\"There has been no better team in college basketball this season than UConn, who at 31-3, looks well-positioned to repeat as National Champions for the first time since Florida in 2006-2007. The Huskies rank 15th nationally in points against (64.4) while averaging 81.5 on offense (22nd).\n\"Their draw is somewhat tricky with potential matchups against 2023 Final Four member Florida Atlantic in the second round, SEC Tournament Champion, Auburn in the Sweet 16, and Big 12 Tournament Champion Iowa State in the Elite Eight. But with strong guard play from Tristen Newton and Cam Spencer, it would be a minor surprise if they didn't advance to the Final Four and beyond in 2024.\"\nThomas Casale's pick to win: North Carolina\n\"I have been a fan of this Carolina team all season. I think they are on a mission after laying an egg last year. The thing I like most about the Tar Heels is they can adapt and win games in multiple different ways. That's important in the tournament because when one thing doesn't work, teams need to be able to adapt.\n\"North Carolina's resurgence starts on the defensive end. Last season there were too many games where the Tar Heels played with little emotion on defense and it cost them. Hubert Davis fixed those issues in the offseason. UNC enters the NCAA Tournament ranked No. 6 in defensive efficiency on KenPom.\n\"I bet North Carolina a while back at +3000 but I still think they are worth a look at their current number. They would have to get by a potential matchup with UConn in the Final Four but if there is one team that can end the Huskies' run at a repeat, I believe it's UNC.\"\nBob Konarski's pick to win: Houston\n\"Looking at the regions, Houston may have one of the easiest paths to the Final Four out of the number one seeds. The East Region with Connecticut is stacked with conference winners, like Auburn, Iowa State, and Drake, that can give the Huskies a run for their money. Houston may not be tested until the Sweet 16 when they could have a matchup against the Duke Blue Devils, then a possible matchup with Marquette if Tyler Kolek returns healthy.\n\"Houston has the top-rated defense in the country and that is something you want to look for in a team when attempting to make a run in March. The Cougars win the defensive battle first then capitalize on offense. Jamal Shead is one of the best leading point guards in the country and paired with LJ Cryer, makes them a lethal backcourt. They have the discipline, physical players and a great coach to make a run in March.\"\nWhat's the best March Madness 2024 bracket?\nSo what's the optimal NCAA Tournament 2024 bracket? And which NCAA Tournament Cinderella teams will shock college basketball? Visit SportsLine to see which No. 12 seed reaches the Sweet 16, and which region features a No. 10 seed, No. 11 seed and No. 13 seed delivering first-round shockers and has a No. 9 seed in the Elite Eight, all from the model that has beaten 92% of bracket players three of the last five tournaments.\nHow do experts predict who will win March Madness?\nThe experts at SportsLine have years of experience evaluating lines, teams, coaching styles, offensive trends, defensive trends and opponent tendencies.

Also worth noting: Sling TV comes with 50 hours of cloud-based DVR recording space included, perfect for recording all the season's top NFL matchups.\nThat plan normally costs $40 per month, but the streamer is currently offering Sling Orange for $120 for four months when you prepay. That's $30 per month, a saving of $40.\nNote: Because men's March Madness 2024 will broadcast on CBS, you won't be able to watch all men's March Madness 2024 with a Sling TV subscription. If you're looking to stream the men's tournament, we suggest a subscription to one of the other platforms featured here.\nTop features of Sling TV Orange tier:\n- There are 32 channels to watch in total, including ESPN, TNT and TBS.

You can stream ESPN+ through the ESPN app on your favorite mobile device and ESPN.com. It's also available as an app through major smart TV streaming platforms and gaming consoles such as the PS5.\nKeep in mind there are some blackouts prohibiting you from watching certain in-market games with ESPN+, even if they're nationally televised. If you're looking to avoid those blackouts, we suggest subscribing to the Hulu + Live TV/ESPN+ bundle featured above.\nIt is important to note that ESPN+ does not include access to the ESPN network.

Here's the kicker: There's no monthly charge.\nFor anyone living in a partially blocked-off area (those near mountains or first-floor apartments), a digital TV antenna may not pick up a good signal -- or any signal at all. But for many homes, a digital TV antenna provides a seriously inexpensive way to watch March Madness without paying a cable company. Indoor TV antennas can also provide some much-needed TV backup if a storm knocks out your cable.\nThis amplified digital antenna with a 250-mile range can receive hundreds of HDTV channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, Fox and Univision and can filter out cellular and FM signals.
