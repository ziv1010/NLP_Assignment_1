  "body_text": "3 best WSL teams: October 2024 - ranked\n- The 2024/25 WSL season is well underway following another month of action\n- Manchester City sit top of the standings ahead of Chelsea and Manchester United\n- West Ham are bottom of the table on goal difference\nIt's been an exciting start to the 2024/25 Women's Super League season and October’s fixtures didn’t disappoint.\nThere were some significant wins, including Chelsea's triumph away at Arsenal, and the league table is starting to take shape. Manchester City lead the way as things stand, but rivals Manchester United and Chelsea do have a game in hand.\nAt the other end of the table, West Ham, Everton and Aston Villa are still waiting for their first wins of the campaign. All sit on two points, but the Hammer’s goal difference puts them in 12th after five games.\nThe league is now gearing up for November's busy run of matches, but 90min have assessed the performances of each team in October, and ranked the top three…\n3. Brighton\nBrighton had a strong start to the season in September and many tipped them to be the surprise package this year. It's fair to say they maintained that good form throughout October with seven points from a possible nine.\nThe Seagulls took points off United with a 1-1 draw, and beat both Aston Villa and Crystal Palace. There will be greater tests to come for Brighton, but things could not have gone much better in the early months of the season, and they are already competing for a top four place.\n2. Manchester City\nA list of the top three teams couldn't leave out the current league leaders. While they have played a game more than their rivals, all Gareth Taylor’s side can do is control their own results, and they are doing a remarkable job.\nOctober wasn’t without its setbacks, either. City conceded first in two of their three matches last month, and it could have been all three if not for an incorrect offside call.\nThe good news, though, is that they were able to fight their way back in each of those games and go on to win. As they say, when a team is winning despite not being at their best, it's a potential sign of champions.\n1. Chelsea\nChelsea remain the only team in the WSL yet to drop any points. They have won all four of their matches so far, which includes two in October against London rivals.\nThe calibre of opposition places the current champions at the top of this ranking. They went to Arsenal's Emirates Stadium and came away with a 2-1 victory, prompting Jonas Eidevall's resignation in the process. They also beat Tottenham on home soil with 5-2 thumping.\nAs far as starts to the season go, things couldn't have gone much better for Sonia Bompastor's side. November will be tougher with huge matches against City and United on the horizon, but Chelsea's form in October has placed them in a strong position going into a huge month.",
