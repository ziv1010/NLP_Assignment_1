  "body_text": "The Mancunian Way: Eating with Erling\nPLUS: Fact-checking George Galloway\nHello,\nOver the weekend, some friends and I were discussing the vaguely jarring feeling you get seeing some of the world’s most famous footballers prowling the streets of Manchester.\nIt’s no secret that the stars have their favourite spots - Ederson frequents a small Salford Brazilian supermarket, Grealish can’t get enough of Wing’s after a game, and De Bruyne has been spotted enjoying a date night in Australasia.\nYet still, nothing quite prepares you for seeing the famous faces fully dimensional in front of you, walking past the same corner shop you popped into in your PJs for a pint of milk last night.\nExcept somehow, M.E.N Parents editor Emma Gill managed to miss the towering Erling Haaland when she dined at Salford’s Vero Moderno on Friday night. Yes, all six foot four of him.\nStill, anything that’s good enough for City’s man of the moment is good enough for Emma, and she managed to set aside any disappointment at missing her glimpse of the big Norwegian for a ‘flavoursome’ Italian feast. You win some, you lose some.\nDescribing it as an ‘unassuming place with a casual vibe and a friendly atmosphere’, Emma was impressed with her ‘unique’ meal of homemade spinach fettuccine, 'served with the most famous Roman recipe “Cacio e Pepe”. Sounds delicious.\nAnd as for Haaland, she said there wasn't any fuss around his presence, or quiet departure - “Probably the reason the players like it here so much,” she mused. “They can come and go without being mithered.”\nStill, it didn’t stop owner Beppe Piccoli ushering her into the restaurant's CCTV cupboard to show her the footage of Erling arriving at 'his' table - the same one he's sat at once a week, almost every week, for the last three years. Just in case you thought he was telling porkies.\nYou can read Emma’s full review of Haaland’s favourite restaurant here.\nIt’s not that simple\nIt has only been a couple of weeks since George Galloway was elected to parliament in a contentious Rochdale by-election, and he’s already making big claims.\nKeeping on the theme of football, one of Galloway’s campaign promises has been to save ailing Rochdale AFC. The club is at risk of collapse if it does not secure investors by the end of the month.\nThere’s certainly hope for Rochdale fans, as two companies have announced their intentions to buy The Dale. But Galloway may have jumped the gun a little after posting a video on X last week claiming the club has been ‘saved’.\nOur politics reporter Joseph Timan has diligently fact-checked the MPs claim, and found that while there is certainly interest in buying the club, negotiations with both companies are still ongoing - making Galloway’s remarks somewhat premature.\nSpeaking to the M.E.N, he said he hopes his hasty claims turn out to be true, adding he is ready to help the club if needed.

But in the years that followed, it was repeatedly rocked by setbacks as costs spiralled to more than £11m.\nEarlier this year, Khan announced the venue - named The Balmayna - was preparing for a grand opening. Now, they have posted some first glimpses inside the luxury space.\nOne piece of footage showed one room complete with a grand chandelier, plush sofas, armchairs and a marble table. However, wires and a smoke alarm can also be seen hanging from the metal corrugated roof above.\nIn a post on Instagram, The Balmayna wrote: “Anticipation builds as we approach the grand reveal of The Balmayna’s exquisite charm. Join us for an exclusive preview of our Booking Office, an elegant space with picturesque views.\n“Let us make your dream come true, get in-touch to arrange a viewing!\"\nYou can see the pictures and read the full story here.\nMRI deaths\nTwo Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) patients died from listeria outbreak after being served chicken mayonnaise sandwiches in hospital.\nMother-of-four Beverley Sowah, 57, and mother-of-five Enid Heap, 84, both died from blood poisoning caused by listeria. In both cases, this is linked to chicken mayonnaise sandwiches which were given to the women while they were admitted to wards at the MRI.\nHealth reporter Helena Vesty reported from the first day of a five-day joint inquest at Manchester Coroner’s Court.\nThe source of the bacteria was linked to an external food supplier, not the kitchens at the hospital, the court was also told. A national investigation was then launched by public health officials ‘due to other cases that were identified across the country’, not just at the MRI.\nYou can read the full story here.\nFamily empire\nA father and son arrested at Manchester Airport before they were due to fly to Dubai face lengthy jail sentences. Asim Tufail, 52, and his son Junnaid Tufail, 23, both from Northenden,have been convicted of a series of drug and firearms offences.\nAsim Tufail, who was wearing a £70,000 Rolex watch when he was held in the departure lounge in Terminal One, was said to ‘outwardly’ appear to be a ‘profitable businessman’ who enjoyed ‘the trappings of wealth’.\n“But the profits did not come from any kind of legitimate trade,” prosecutor Tim Storrie KC told Minshull Street Crown Court. His son Junnaid Tufail described his father as his ‘role model’, and followed him into organised crime.\nYou can read the full court report here.\nWeather etc\nWednesday: Overcast changing to heavy rain by late morning. 13C.\nRoadworks: A34 Irwell Street Southbound closed due to roadworks from A6042 Trinity Way to Stanley Street.\nManchester headlines:\n- Bury stabbing: A 17-year-old boy has been arrested after three people were stabbed in a horror attack outside Bury Market.

But the dad and his family faced an ongoing battle to get him treatment in the months before his death. You can read the full report here.",
