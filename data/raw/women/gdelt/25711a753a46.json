  "body_text": "The ACT government has shut the majority of sports venues across the city for a planned two-week maintenance period to prepare the playing fields for winter action.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nACT Sport Minister Yvette Berry said the controversial two-week closure was crucial to ensuring the grass could handle the rigours of all the football codes in cold and wet conditions.\nThere have been calls in the past for the government to stagger the remediation work to allow some training and games to continue, and the government will keep 25 ovals open to accommodate pre-season training.\n\"[The work] includes, top dressing surfaces, installing goal posts, line marking ovals, upgrading turf, fertilising and in some locations adding coconut fibres into the soil to help with better water retention on ovals,\" Berry said.\n\"The ACT government continues to receive positive feedback from sporting peak bodies of this approach in keeping some grounds open during the two-week maintenance period.\n\"These 25 playing fields will receive maintenance later in 2025.\"\nThe grounds will be reopened on April 1 ahead of the AFL Canberra, Canberra Region Rugby League, Capital Football and ACT Rugby Union seasons.Fields at Bonython, Hughes, Cook, Isabella Plains, Giralang, Latham, Gworie, Pearce and Holt will stay open for training and bookings\nGovernment officials have had their hands full with work in recent years as rain drowned most venues and caused chaos with fixtures during the season.\nThey have also had to battle massive numbers of Argentinian scarabs and African black beetles, which were eating the roots of the grass during summer and forcing staff to work overnight to curb the damage.\n'That was torture': Rebecca collapsed in tears after beating torrential weather and injury\nxRebecca Henderson fell off her bike and started to cry. Her shoulder had been throbbing for eight of the nine laps in pouring rain and destructive wins, but it was only part of the reason she was overcome with emotion.\nHenderson - a four-time Olympian - beat injury and the weather to be crowned cross-country national champion again, continuing a 20-year streak of winning titles across a variety of divisions.\nThe 33-year-old added a 21st national title to her trophy cabinet and another exclamation point to her glittering career when she held on for a tight win at Mt Buller on the weekend.\nHenderson narrowly beat Isabella Flint after just over an hour of racing in brutal conditions, which forced organisers to modify the race and course after a severe weather warning for 100kmh winds was issued before the start.\nHenderson snuck across the line less than a second ahead of Flint after the nine laps. Making it even more impressive was the pain Henderson had to beat after crashing on the first lap.\n\"That was torture. I hated every second of that,\" a relieved Henderson said.\n\"I crashed in the first lap and I couldn't shake Izzy, and I was in so much pain. By the end, I couldn't use my left arm. I'm not in a good way.\"\nHenderson returned to Canberra on Sunday night and had scans on her shoulder on Monday as she waits to find out the damage of another national title.\nBut she is no stranger to pain after making her national championship debut as a teenager and more than a decade on the international circuit. She won the national title last year despite injuring her ankle in the lead up to the event.\nShe has been unable to transfer her World Cup success to the Olympic stage, but Henderson has already established herself as Australia's greatest mountain biker.\n\"Thank you Isabella Flint for that hard battle and all the girls that called out while I was on the ground and picking myself up,\" Henderson said on social media.\n\"I thought last year was tough with my ankle. This one really takes the cake. On reflection I think that was one of my gutsiest efforts to date and I'm in a little bit of disbelief that I got it done.\"\nHenderson has carried the weight of expectation on her shoulders since she first turned up at the nationals, but that has fuelled her successful career.\n\"It's no secret that it's a pretty special race for me,\" Henderson said before the race.\n\"... The jersey means a lot to me, it's become part of my identity for sure. In my early years as an elite I felt so much pressure to win this race. I had to prove myself. Again and again.\"\nHenderson has joined a new team this year to continue her international assault while also weighing up whether to race on to the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\nShe also won the short-track title earlier on the weekend, while fellow Canberran Zoe Cuthbert finished third in the elite women's race and Sian A'Hern claimed her fourth national title when she won the elite downhill event.\nA'Hern crashed on the opening day of competition but bounced back to reclaim her title.\n\"It was a whirlwind of a week,\" A'Hern said. \"I was going to have to dig deep to get down that track. Pretty stoked to claim another national title. It means the world. I knew if I rode like me, I'd do what I know I can do.\"",
