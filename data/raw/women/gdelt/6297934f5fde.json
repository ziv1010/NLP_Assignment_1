  "body_text": "LOS ANGELES — Excitement and anticipation went through the sellout crowd of 22,000 at BMO Stadium as Houston Dash defender Katie Lind was sent off with a red card in Sunday’s game against Angel City FC.\nWith a player advantage, the winning goal was expected to be in the cards for Angel City.\nHowever, what was expected, didn’t materialize as the teams ended up playing to a scoreless draw.\n“Are we happy with a point? No,” Angel City interim coach Becki Tweed said. “It was good for us to keep a clean sheet, but we had opportunities to win the game.\n“I think sometimes when you play against 10 players, it can become a bit slippery, but again we prepared for it. We created opportunities to win the game, we just have to be more ruthless in the final third.”\nLind was sent off in the 58th minute for a foul on Sydney Leroux. Initially, Lind was issued a yellow card for the foul. However, since she was the last defender, referee Sergi Demianchuk went to the video review and changed the card to a red for “denying of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.”\nFrom that moment, Angel City started to apply some pressure. In the 76th minute, Alyssa Thompson had two attempts, the first forced Houston goalkeeper Jane Campbell into a diving save. A minute later, Thompson, coming down the left wing, got off a shot that hit the post, narrowly missing rolling inside the near post.\nIn the 90th minute, Clarisse LeBihan also had a shot that hit the post.\n“I think is a game that we wanted three points especially when they went down to 10 players,” Angel City midfielder Julie Ertz said.\nIf there is any team capable of surviving losing a player, it would be the Dash (4-3-6, 18 points). Last week, the Dash, who entered the week having scored the fewest (10) goals and allowed the fewest (10) in the league, went down to 10 players after a first-half red card and still managed to record a point in a scoreless draw against OL Reign.\n“They’re a really gritty team,” Tweed said of the Dash. “Hard to break down, pride themselves defensively. We watched them last week to look at if it did happen, how could we try and counter that. I think that we did, it’s just that end product piece for us. Once that clicks, I think we’re in a good spot. But we just have to keep growing, we have to keep picking up points, really important for us, but I do think there’s another level to keep us pushing on.”\nThis is just the third time this season that Angel City has picked up points in consecutive games. Last week, they defeated San Diego Wave FC 2-1. Angel City (3-6-4) moves to 13 points in the standings, currently seven points behind the sixth and final playoff spot (San Diego, 20 points) with nine games remaining.\n“We really wanted three points, so it feels a little disappointing,” Thompson said. “Having the shutout is good and I’m happy we didn’t lose.”\nBoth Thompson and Ertz will report Monday to the U.S. women’s national team to begin preparation for the July 9 game against Wales and the FIFA World Cup, starting July 20.\nAngel City returns to Challenge Cup play Wednesday against San Diego Wave FC (7:30 p.m.). The next league game is Sunday on the road at NJ/NY Gotham FC.",
