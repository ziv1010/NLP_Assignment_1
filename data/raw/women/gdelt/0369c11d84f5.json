To date, the programme has supported the construction of four removable structures for five-a-side football, 38 outdoor futsal pitches and 24 five-a-side football pitches.\nIn June 2020, HatTrick funding also helped the FFF establish an extraordinary solidarity fund, valued at approximately €20 million, to help restart the national game and to support the nation’s 14,182 amateur clubs hit financially by football’s shutdown during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nUnder the fund’s conditions, every affiliated amateur club was entitled to €10 for each registered player, with the FFF investing €7 and the leagues and districts covering the remainder. More than two million registered players benefited.\nUEFA Foundation for Children in France\nSet up in 2015, the UEFA Foundation uses football as a vehicle to help improve children’s lives by supporting hundreds of campaigns and projects across Europe and around the world.\nSport dans la Ville\nSet up in 1998 and based in Lyon, Grenoble, Saint-Etienne and Paris, Sport dans la Ville is France’s leading non-profit organisation for disadvantaged young people aged 7 to 25.\nUEFA support has enabled more than 3,000 disadvantaged children and teenagers to go on holiday. This experience, which others may take for granted, can have a huge impact on the lives of children who have grown up in urban neighbourhoods.\nDuring the holidays Sport dans la Ville provides children with opportunities for personal growth through creative, discovery and sports projects like football. Group activities promote mutual respect, solidarity, daily commitment and teamwork, ensuring children leave with happy memories and motivation to strive to achieve new goals.\nTimeline\nAssociation history\nNational team history\nPresident\nPhilippe Diallo\nNationality: French\nDate of Birth: 2 August 1963\nAssociation president since: 2023\nGeneral secretary\nJean-François Vilotte\nNationality: French\nDate of birth: 24 May 1957\nAssociation general secretary since: 2023",
