  "body_text": "One of the most dramatic transfer windows in Women’s Super League history came to a close this week and lots of fans and managers will be breathing a sigh of relief that it is all over.\nIt started with a bang. On January 4, Bethany England joined Tottenham Hotspur from Chelsea for a domestic record fee of £250,000 ($308,000), then the next day Jordan Nobbs announced she was leaving Arsenal for Aston Villa. Nobbs, a fan favourite at Arsenal, had been at the club for 12 years.\nMy family and home for 12 years… Arsenal will always be in my heart ❤️ https://t.co/ztBsCK2G4Z\n— Jordan Nobbs (@JordanNobbs8) January 5, 2023\nThe departures from Arsenal didn’t stop there as Mana Iwabuchi joined Tottenham on loan, while young talent came the other way in 19-year-old Danish midfielder Kathrine Kuhl from Nordsjaelland and highly rated 23-year-old Victoria Pelova from Ajax.\nHowever, the biggest bombshells came right at the end of the month. News of a rejected bid from Chelsea for Arsenal’s Katie McCabe was reported by Sky Sports and The Telegraph over the final weekend of the month.\nAdvertisement\nAnd then, a day before the window closed, The Athletic revealed that Arsenal had put in a world-record bid for Manchester United and England forward Alessia Russo (top image).\nRusso, 23, has been in talks with United over a new contract as her current deal expires in the summer. However, no agreement has been reached over extending it and Arsenal thought they might be able to swoop in and pull off one of the most sensational deals in the history of the women’s game.\nThe current world-record signing in the women’s game is Keira Walsh’s move to Barcelona from Manchester City last September, which cost £400,000 ($493,000).\nArsenal’s dramatic chase for Russo was headline news, dominating the Sky Sports News Deadline Day banner for most of the last 24 hours of the window. It marked a significant moment for the women’s game.\nRusso ended up staying put as United dug their heels in and refused to let their main striker head to a title rival halfway through the season, despite the risk of her leaving on a free at the end of the season.\nIt was a blow for Arsenal, who are desperate for goals after significant injuries to Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead, and the London club ended the window having not managed to bring in additional firepower.\nThe negotiations and reported fees for Russo and McCabe epitomised the unique dynamic that exists in the women’s football transfer market: big clubs don’t always need to accept big money.\nUnited are a multi-million-pound global brand, so there isn’t desperation to take the money. Another factor is that the club doesn’t rely on transfer revenues because their budget comes from the parent men’s.\nOf course, Premier League money doesn’t guarantee limitless transfer budgets for WSL teams. Plenty of clubs are still desperately asking for more investment. But it relieves the pressure to sell and opens the door for any club that wants to try and join the WSL’s elite. That’s been more visible than ever this season.\nAdvertisement\nSpending in the WSL had already shifted in the summer window when Aston Villa signed Rachel Daly, French international Viviane Asseyi joined West Ham and Tottenham secured Celin Bizet Ildhusoy from Paris Saint-Germain, to name just a few of the impressive transfers from mid-table teams in the league.\nThe growing ambition and increased spending from teams outside of the traditional big three of Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City only continued in January. Nobbs and England opting to leave successful, winning teams in order to find game time as well as Tottenham breaking a record in order to prize the latter from Chelsea are both remarkable.\nThe market has moved from predictable cycles of short contracts, small transfer fees and bloated squads to bidding wars, transfer sagas and a better spread of talent across the entire division. The change is not just important for the value of the game but for media interest, too.\nYes, there are concerns about financial sustainability and clubs getting priced out if they don’t have the luxury of Premier League backing.\nAnd there are already signs that a rich middle is breaking away from the lower section of the table. But this window has shown that the WSL is the centre of the women’s football world at the moment.\nJust like spending in the Premier League has outshone other European men’s divisions, the continuing commercialisation of the WSL and the ambition of the clubs within it is driving spending far beyond what other leagues are capable of. Of course, there is transfer spending in Spain, France and Germany, but the depth and the volume are nothing compared to the WSL.\nFor Arsenal and Chelsea, European success is the ultimate goal and there seems to be an infinite budget for how they might get there. But they aren’t the only teams spending big in the market now.\nAdvertisement\nFurthermore, Manchester United demonstrated that they were willing to be stubborn and hold onto their best player — it’s one way of showing that they are part of that WSL elite now.\nSome will see it as bad business while others will commend the decision to hold out with the aim of an even bigger prize.\nRegardless, the chaos of this transfer window has set up a perfect finale for the remainder of the WSL season: a three-horse title race and a four-way hunt for Europe that will play out against the backdrop of transfers between rivals that never quite happened and deals that might take place later down the line. Fans can’t wait.\n(Top photo: Manchester United/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
