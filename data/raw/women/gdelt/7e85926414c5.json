Ms Reeves was forced to admit that she had broken rules for landlords when letting out her south London home without a licence last month. She blamed the oversight on her letting agents.\nAngela Rayner, the former deputy prime minister, resigned in September after The Telegraph revealed that she had failed to pay a £40,000 stamp duty bill on the purchase of a flat in Hove.\nRushanara Ali, the UK’s former minister for homelessness, stepped down in August after she was accused of evicting her tenants and then re-listing the property at a higher rent. In her resignation letter, she said she had followed “all relevant legal requirements,” but said she had become a distraction for the Government.\nKevin Hollinrake, the chairman of the Conservative Party, said: “Whether it’s the anti-corruption minister being investigated for corruption, the homelessness minister who evicted her own tenants, or the housing secretary who failed to pay her stamp duty, with this Government it is one rule for them and another for everyone else.\n“Healey needs to come clean about what he knew and when. If we cannot trust senior ministers to keep their own tax affairs in order, how can we trust them to run the country?”\nLaila Cunningham, of Reform UK, said: “As a Westminster councillor, I see residents chased for far smaller sums. Yet a Cabinet minister underpays thousands and only fixes it when journalists ring. It’s the same old story, the people in charge don’t live under the rules they impose on everyone else.”\nMr Healey owns his main home in his constituency of Rawmarsh and Conisbrough, where he lives with his wife, and began letting a Westminster flat last November.\nA spokesman for Mr Healey told the Telegraph, who uncovered details of the underpayment: “The Secretary of State fulfilled all his obligations as a tenant by notifying Westminster council of the second home status of the tenancy on the council tax registration form when the tenancy began.\n“Westminster council made an administrative error which failed to classify it as a second home for council tax purposes, and led to an incorrect council tax notice being issued. The council have accepted fault and apologised for the error.\n“Westminster council have rectified this mistake and the council tax liability, including the second homes surcharge, on the London flat has been paid in full.”\nA council spokesman said: “The Secretary of State filled in the form correctly and registered the address as a second home. There was an oversight by the council, and we did not register it as a second home. This led to an incorrect council tax notice being issued. We apologise for the error.”",
