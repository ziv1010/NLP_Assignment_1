  "body_text": "IOWA CITY, Iowa — As basketball season sunsets and football season awakes from its winter siesta, it’s time to look ahead to the next steps for those programs in an Iowa mailbag. Per usual, there were enough questions to warrant splitting the mailbag into two parts.\nHere is the first batch of questions. The second part focuses on football.\nNote: Submitted questions have been edited for clarity.\nAdvertisement\nIowa fans seem to dislike Gary Barta for many reasons. Who would be a good fit for his replacement whenever that time arrives? — T.J. G.\nRank the Barta scandals (this might have to be its own article). — Jarrod S.\nAny time there’s an off-field issue, a loss on the gridiron or a late-season men’s basketball swoon, tweets and story comments flock to one theme: How does athletics director Gary Barta remain employed at Iowa? There are ways to stack the deck on either side.\nWhen it comes to on-field performance, Iowa athletics sits at a zenith. During the past five years, only Ohio State and Michigan have won more football games than the Hawkeyes. During the past 11 years in men’s basketball, only Iowa and Michigan State have fewer than two losing Big Ten campaigns. The women’s basketball program has won the past two Big Ten tournaments. The wrestling program finished second nationally.\nSince 2020-21, Iowa’s big four sports have been ranked in the top three nationally. The field hockey squad also was ranked No. 1. The baseball team beat No. 1 LSU this year and has its best start since 1939. The men’s track and field program has won two of the past three Big Ten titles.\nBut in football and men’s basketball, fans want more. Football has reached two Big Ten title games since 2015, but it felt like it left something on the table a few times. Plus, there’s the handling of offensive coordinator Brian Ferentz, which makes some people surly. Men’s basketball has reached the NCAA Tournament seven times under Fran McCaffery but hasn’t advanced to the Sweet 16 since 1999. No matter what other sports do, football and men’s basketball shape public sentiment in a long-lasting way.\nEvery athletic director deals with controversies, and Barta has had plenty during his 17 years.\nFormer senior associate athletics director Jane Meyer and her partner, former field hockey coach Tracey Griesbaum, filed a gender and sexual discrimination lawsuit. In August 2014, former Iowa president Sally Mason told Barta to fire Griesbaum following multiple accusations of bullying players. Barta paid Griesbaum $200,000 for termination without cause, which led to a lawsuit. Meyer and Barta had run-ins about the situation and the state attorney general’s office recommended Barta reassign his former subordinate. Meyer was transferred within the university, and her non-athletic position was eliminated.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2017, Meyer and Griesbaum beat Barta and the athletic department in court, and the university settled for $6.6 million. That money came from athletics reserves, which were depleted in 2020 during the pandemic. Ten days after the Big Ten announced it would shut down the 2020 football season, Barta eliminated four sports — men’s tennis, men’s gymnastics, men’s swimming and women’s swimming. On behalf of the women’s swimming team, attorneys sued the department based on Title IX. It was determined Iowa was in violation, and in the settlement, the department reinstated women’s swimming and added women’s wrestling along with paying $400,000 in attorney fees.\nThis month, the state of Iowa forced through a $4.175 million settlement for a racial discrimination case brought by 12 former Black football players. Iowa’s athletic department will pay the state’s negotiated $2 million share, while the university pays the rest of it.\nMason and her successor, Bruce Harreld, stood unequivocally behind Barta in the Griesbaum-Meyer situation, while Harreld supported the athletic department in the other lawsuits. Current president Barbara Wilson has not offered a public commentary on Barta, whose contract expires on June 30, 2024.\nShould Barta, 59, leave his position, I’m sure there will be a national search, just as there was when he replaced Bob Bowlsby in 2006.\nInternally, deputy athletic director Beth Goetz has a terrific reputation as both the interim AD at Minnesota and then as Ball State’s athletic director. Tulane’s Troy Dannen was the executive director of the Iowa Girls High School Athletics Union and then was Northern Iowa’s athletic director. Current Northern Iowa athletic director David Harris and Northern Illinois vice president/athletic director Sean Frazier also would make solid candidates.\nIs it time to move on from McCaffery? The keep-shooting mentality puts pressure on players because they know they have to shoot at very high percentages to win. Conversely, opposing players relax before they get off the bus because they know they’ll have an easy time getting their shots. Kenpom has Iowa at No. 4 in offense and No. 168 in defense. It’s obvious, isn’t it? — Red D.\nWhat do you attribute to the lack of success in the NCAA Tournament? Iowa has had NBA players in the post and on the wing. Is it a lack of guard play? Or a style of play? — Charlie S.\nIn Iowa, we just seem to move from one pseudo-sports crisis to another, don’t we? I’m not in favor of a zero-sum requirement of winning the Big Ten as some sort of litmus test of keeping an Iowa coach. Every program is deeply invested in achieving those goals, especially in football and men’s basketball. But since tying for the 1979 Big Ten title, the Hawkeyes have placed in the top five 25 times, including 13 second- or third-place finishes. McCaffery has three top-three finishes and has ended the season in the Big Ten’s upper half in 10 of the past 11 seasons. In those years, Iowa has qualified for the NCAA eight times (counting 2020) and the NIT twice. Those are quality numbers.\nAdvertisement\nBut the program clearly has underachieved in the postseason. Since the Hawkeyes’ last Sweet 16 trip, 97 programs have advanced to the regional semifinals, including 64 of the current 76 Power 6 men’s basketball programs. Only five Power 6 programs have fewer Sweet 16 trips than Iowa’s one since 1988. That’s just not good enough.\nIowa has led the Big Ten in scoring in each of the past five seasons but has ranked 13th or worse in scoring defense in six of the past seven seasons. In all seven NCAA Tournament losses, the opponent outshot Iowa by at least 3 percent from the field. In only one of those defeats, did the opponent fail to score at least 78 points. Four of those losses came against teams seeded ninth or lower. As for the guard play, only three times has a starter scored in double figures in those seven games. Four other times (not counting wing Joe Wieskamp), a reserve guard scored at least 10 points.\nTo boil it down, Iowa needs to become better connected defensively and find a true scorer at guard. McCaffery has a contract through 2028 with a $6.3 million buyout (60 percent of his base salary), so I don’t see Iowa nudging him out the door. While Iowa still gets major fan support, attendance hasn’t averaged 13,000 since 2016. You can ask Iowa fans to support the program only so many times without a payoff in March before they shrug and walk away. It may be getting closer than expected.\nGiven that money now talks even louder in recruiting, how much is it going to take to land a solid post player for next season? What kind of deals are you hearing players getting? — Mike W.\nAll of this is speculative because every number is full of caveats, but $150,000 for a good post player is a safe bet. If you want an All-American, add another zero.\nI was wondering about the transfer portal. How many players are entering, and how many are left without a scholarship? Has this become a win for the school or the individual person? — Tom C.\nFor the 2022-23 football cycle, 1,962 players entered the portal while only 1,117 reported new homes, according to On3. It’s likely that several players found landing spots who either didn’t become public, walked on or surfaced at lower divisions. Still, it’s a startling statistic.\nAt some point, the portal will stabilize with fewer entries. But those numbers are worrisome, simply because it puts their education in peril.\nAsked about Southeastern Louisiana’s defense at the postgame news conference, Monika Czinano first said, “That’s a good question.” I’ve been impressed with how the women’s basketball players handle themselves with the media (not only Caitlin Clark). Do players get formal or informal coaching on media relations? What does that look like? How about other Iowa teams? — Blue D.\nAll of the teams have media relations staff members and other professionals who work with them on their interview skills, especially the football program. They are brought in during preseason camp, but their work largely is on what to say, not necessarily on how to say it.\nAdvertisement\nIn basketball, it’s not quite as intense. Most Iowa women’s basketball players are good at conveying their thoughts, and this squad is off the charts. Clark sounds like an NFL quarterback with her poise and candor. That will serve her well as she continues to surge in popularity and stature.\nGO DEEPER\nHow does Gary Barta remain employed? Should Iowa move on from Fran McCaffery?\nIowa announced in December that it is in the planning phase of a modernization project for Carver-Hawkeye Arena. Any idea on a timeline for the renovation and what modernization really means? — James J.\nIt’s in the planning stages, but everything is open for consideration. That includes shrinking the capacity from 15,056 to perhaps 12,000. It likely involves bringing the stands closer to the court so fans are on top of the action. There will be more premium seating, of course, but there’s no hard timeline for renovating the 40-year-old arena.\nThe restroom availability and concession offerings are among the Big Ten’s worst. There’s no mid-level concourse so fans with the best seats must walk 80 steps to exit the arena or ride one elevator that’s always jam-packed. It needs a renovation in the worst way.\nWatching the Big Ten hockey championships got me thinking: Is Iowa ever going to get a Division I team? The Big Ten is arguably the best conference in the sport, Iowa would have one of the best recruiting footprints with the proximity of the USHL, and there is a facility built that just so happens to meet all the NCAA requirements. — Tucker S.\nWith a new arena in Coralville, infrastructure is in place for Iowa to add hockey. No offense to the ECHL’s Iowa Heartlanders, who are a Minnesota Wild affiliate, but that team is more of a novelty two years into its existence. If there are Tigerhawk jerseys on the ice against the Gophers or Badgers, the passion and interest jump exponentially.\nBut after cutting three men’s sports following the 2020-21 year, adding hockey wouldn’t be a good look for Iowa. Plus, it’s a costly sport. The six Big Ten men’s programs combined to lose $7.655 million, and the four women’s programs lost $8.788 million in the fiscal year 2022. The only program close to even was Penn State men’s team, and it documented $1.8 million in endowed income.\nUnless a donor writes a significant check, Big Ten ice hockey won’t show up in Iowa City any time soon. If there’s any mad money hiding at Carver-Hawkeye’s business offices, it needs to go to football. It might be cool to play Minnesota in hockey but not at the cost of losing Floyd of Rosedale to the Gophers in a football game.\n(Top photo: Keith Gillett / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)",
