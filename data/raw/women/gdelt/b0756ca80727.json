  "body_text": "Chelsea Women are back!\nChelsea FCW vs. Aston Villa WFC, Women’s Super League: Preview, team news, how to watch\nThe Bompastor Era begins\nIn some ways, the team’s almost unrecognizable. There’s a new head coach, for the first time in a decade. There are many new players, and several legends have left. The club itself has been carved out from underneath the Chelsea men’s umbrella, and is now its own separate entity, on and off the pitch.\nBut, as they say, the more things change, the more they stay the same. And the expectations, most certainly, have remained the same, if not even higher.\nWe start the season and begin our latest title defence with a home game against Aston Villa. It should be a good challenge for the new boss, and an opportunity to show what she might have in mind for us going forward with a positive start to the new era at Kingsmeadow.\nDate / Time: Friday, September 20, 2024, 19.00 BST; 2pm EDT; 11:30pm IST\nVenue: Kingsmeadow, Kingston upon Thames, UK\nReferee: Kirsty Dowle\nForecast: Sunny and light winds\nOn TV: BBC Two (UK); none (USA); elsewhere\nStreaming: BBC iPlayer (UK); ESPN+ (USA)\nChelsea team news: Transitioning from a manager who had been at the club for 12 years and won almost every possible title there was to be won, to a completely new head coach can lead to some growing pains. But at least in preseason there have been little to no signs of Bompastor struggling to imprint her style of football, while still leaving room for our individual talents to shine.\nChelsea won every preseason match, including a 1-0 win over Arsenal with a goal from new signing Sandy Baltimore in the United States, and a 9-0 thrashing of Feyenoord at Kingsmeadow. Speaking of new signings, there’ve been no fewer than seven, including Júlia Bartel and Lucy Bronze from Barcelona, and defender Maelys Mpomé from Montpellier.\nBut we also had some painful departures. The legendary Fran Kirby said goodbye to the club after nearly a decade in Chelsea Blue, and we also saw the exits of Maren Mjelde, Melanie Leupolz, Jelena Čanković, and Jess Carter.\nWhat matters most however is that we’ve kept our winning core, including Sam Kerr, who signed a two-year extension through 2026. This should give Bompastor a solid base from which to maintain our winning tradition. Unfortunately, Niamh Charles (dislocated shoulder) and Sophie Ingle (ACL) will be out for the foreseeable future, with Charles undergoing surgery just yesterday.\n“The team is not just about me. It’s about the players and all of the staff who are involved in our performance. We are all united to make sure we achieve our goals this season.\n“This is a team filled with different personalities, with different talents and with different histories. I have got to know all of that over the last six or seven weeks — and this is what I want to show people when they watch us at home, away or on the TV.\n“We are all lucky enough to have our passion be our jobs. I am someone who is really passionate and I think all the players in our squad are the exact same.\n“We want to bring that passion on the pitch and enjoy our time out there together. It’s about getting a good result, of course, and showing our good values on the pitch.\n“Something really important to me is not only our results, but our behaviours. I want the players to be proud of the result, while displaying our values and enjoying all of these moments with the fans.”\n-Sonia Bompastor; source: Chelsea FC\nAston Villa team news: Villa followed up their best ever season in 2022-23 with a significantly worse campaign, finishing with 13 points fewer (in 22 games) last season. This setback was likely one of the main factors behind Carla Ward’s decision to step down from the managerial seat, with former Bayer Leverkusen head coach Robert de Pauw taking over in the offseason.\nIn the summer transfer window, the team had near as many incoming as outgoing players. They signed Spain international left back Paula Tomás (from Levante) and Brazil centre forward Gabi Nunes (also from Levante), while seeing the likes of Daphne van Domselaar and Alisha Lehmann leave the club for Arsenal and Juventus, respectively.\nNunes is probably the one player to keep an eye on. Mayra Ramírez’s former teammate scored 11 goals in 28 games for Levante last season.\nPreviously: 3-0 win at Kingsmeadow for the Blues, with Maika Hamano scoring her first ever Chelsea goal from a Catarina Macario assist.",
