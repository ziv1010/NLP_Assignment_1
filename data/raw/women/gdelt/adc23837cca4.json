  "body_text": "Michigan Primary 2024 Voter Guide: State House candidates running in metro Detroit\nJenny Sherman August 6, 2024Learn more about the candidates running to be a state Representative in southeast Michigan.\nThe 2024 Michigan primary takes place on Tuesday, Aug. 6, and there are several state Representative races on the ballot in metro Detroit.\nA federal court ruled in December that more than a dozen Michigan state House and Senate districts around metro Detroit violated the U.S. Constitution by diluting Black voting power — requiring an independent commission to redraw the districts.\nThe Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission has since approved a new map called “Motown Sound FC E1,” which redrew 15 Detroit-area districts and was affirmed by the court in March.\nTo see what’s on the ballot in your area, click here.\nEditor’s note: WDET distributed surveys to local, county and congressional candidates in key races on the August primary ballot to gain a deeper understanding of what’s motivating them to run.

Tyrone Carter did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request. You can find more information at Carter’s official campaign website.\nName: Jay Lovelady\nJay Lovelady did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request and does not appear to have an official campaign website.\nName: Valerie Whittaker\nValerie Whittaker did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request and does not appear to have an official campaign website.\nEditor’s note: Republican candidate Valerie Whittaker does not have a contested race in the August primary and will be on November’s general election ballot.\nName: Tullio Liberati\nAge: 56\nCurrent Job: Small business owner and current State Representative\nEducation: St. Francis Cabrini High School-Wayne State University\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI was born and raised in Allen Park, Michigan. I married my high school sweetheart Constance Liberati (Ghist), and have been married for 31 years. We raised our two children in Allen Park, Tullio III, and Olivia. I am a registered builder in the state of Michigan and started my general contracting construction business, Liberati And Sons Construction in 1997. My company is based in Allen Park. I love the Downriver area and it has been a pleasure to represent my community for the past four years in Lansing as the state Representative. I have been active in the local community coaching sports, being a member of numerous local organizations, and a parishioner at St. Francis Cabrini. I hope to continue representing my constituents for another two-year term if I am fortunate enough to win in November. The Downriver area has made me who I am, and I look forward to working in Lansing to continue helping the people of my district live better.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 2 seat?\nI’m running for reelection for the 2nd District because I believe in this area, and want to continue advocating for its residents. I have brought millions of state dollars back to the community that I believe was not always represented and advocated for, as it could have been. These dollars were brought back to the community whose residents paid their fair share in state taxes, and hopefully see the difference they make. Whether they were used for critical infrastructure and road projects, economic development, public safety, or improvement to our parks, downriver was not looked over again as in the past.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n• Education: I will continue to advocate for our public schools and universities. Help pass legislation that will get young people to go into the teaching profession. There is a shortage of teachers that needs to be addressed.\n• Retain our talent: Policies need to be put in place so graduates from our great universities do not get their degrees and move elsewhere. Policies that make businesses want to be located in Michigan. A strong public education system and affordable housing are critical for graduates to decide to stay in Michigan.\n• Roads and critical infrastructure: Michigan has made great strides when it comes to fixing the roads, but we have a long way to go. Sustainable and long-term funding needs to be put in place. Also working to strengthen the recruitment of people that want to go into the building trades. Not everyone wants to go to college. These jobs can make for a great career. Training and education in the trades need to start in high schools, so students feel there are other opportunities for them besides going to college. With all the projects needed to be done, we need a robust and well-trained workforce.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI am proud to vote and pass common sense gun laws this past term, without infringing on people’s right to bear arms if they choose. Red flags, safe storage, and universal background legislation that passed will help save lives.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI will always stand with a woman’s right to choose. I do not believe it is the government’s place to dictate women’s health care choices.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nInflation is on the way down. The U.S. is doing substantially better than most other nations. Coming out of the pandemic and jump-starting the economy was a big reason for the jump in the rate of inflation. Standing up for strong workers’ wages, and making sure people are not taking advantage of the situation will help curb inflation. Hopefully, the Fed will start to lower interest rates, which will help the situation.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI have always tried to concentrate on what I can do for the people of my district. I do not concentrate on what the opposition is doing. I have always tried to work for the people of Michigan, and that means working in a bipartisan manner, even better. I have always taken pride in working well with Representatives from both sides of the aisle to get things done for all Michiganders.\nEditor’s note: Democratic incumbent candidate Tullio Liberati does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Ron Kokinda\nAge: 74\nCurrent job: Semi-retired consultant\nEducation: BA Political Science\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI’m a firm supporter of our nation’s founding principles, and the responsibility in particular to promote the general welfare. I am an advocate for the U.S. to once again become a manufacturing superpower.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 2 seat?\nIn the short term, to help stop the legislation that has been passed in the current term and is being prepared for the next, which I believe is in the wrong direction.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nRepeal the green mandates. Ensure cheap abundant energy. Improve roads and other infrastructure.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI’m a strong supporter of the Second Amendment.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nMichigan has passed a proposition that should have settled this. This is ultimately a cultural question — the more optimistic the culture, and the better able people are to afford children, hopefully we can restore the desire to have children. Today the birth rate in America is below the replacement rate, and that is a serious problem.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nProduction, production, production — manufacturing and cheaper energy, including nuclear.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI don’t have a primary challenger. My disagreements with my opponent in the general election are a long list, especially toward children where we need real education, not genderization, sexualization, and pornography, and the economy, where the intent seems to be to drive jobs out of the state rather than bring them in.\nEditor’s note: Republican candidate Ronald Kokinda does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nState Representative – 3rd District\nJump to candidate\nName: Ziad Abdulmalik\nZiad Abdulmalik did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request. You can find more information at Abdulmalik’s campaign website.\nName: Alabas Farhat\nAge: 24\nCurrent job: State Representative\nEducation: B.S. in Public Health\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nState Rep. Alabas Farhat proudly represents Michigan’s 3rd House District,\nencompassing most of Dearborn and parts of Detroit. With a deep commitment to public service, Farhat advocates passionately for his constituents and all Michiganders. He emphasizes the importance of working closely with his residents. Farhat’s extensive background in public health and public policy informs his legislative efforts, focusing on health care, economic development, public safety and infrastructure. He works diligently across party lines to advance policies that benefit Michigan’s communities and enhance the quality of life for all residents.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 3 seat?\nI’m running to make sure that my hometown has an advocate at the state-level. I care\ndeeply about my community and want to ensure that my neighbors’ voices are heard in\nthe legislature. I believe that we deserve to have access to quality education and\nhealthcare and I want to bring back resources to support those public services in my\ncommunity . I also believe that, now more than ever, our democracy needs to be\nprotected and access to the ballot box be preserved.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nThe biggest issues that the state of Michigan faces are a lack of public transit,\ninaccessible health care and aging infrastructure. As state representative I would fight to increase funding for bussing, expand access for Medicaid, and work to secure significant investments towards our roads, bridges, crossways and water infrastructure.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nGun violence is one of the leading causes of fatalities in the nation. As a state government, we have a responsibility to change this narrative by working to reduce gun\nviolence. That’s why I worked hard the past two years to help pass new Secure Storage\nand Red Flag legislation as well as a Gun Violence Prevention package. But there is still\nmore work to do. If reelected, I will continue to advocate for stronger protections from\ngun violence in Michigan.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nMichigan voters made it clear in 2022 that they wanted Prop 3 to be the law of the land. In my first term, I have respected and upheld the will of the people. Moreover, abortion\naccess is a fundamental right and is a decision that should be made between patient and provider.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nTargeted stimulus packages to support struggling families and small businesses is\ncrucial. Inflation affects our middle class families the most. We also need investments in infrastructure, education, and clean energy to boost productivity and competitiveness. Additionally, it is necessary that we implement policies that promote fair wages, strengthen labor rights, and ensure robust consumer protections to mitigate the impact of rising prices on our working families.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nAlthough I have a few challengers in this race, I am more focused on being a strong and\ndependable advocate for my district. Through strong relationships with local and state\npartners, we’ve accomplished a lot over the past two years. Securing strong investments\nto fix our roads and bridges, bringing down the cost of pharmaceuticals, and expanding\nfunding for public health and safety. I would be excited to continue serving as a voice for my community over the next two years and keep the progress we’ve started going.\nName: Gus Tarraf\nGus Tarraf did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request. You can find more information at Tarraf’s campaign website.\nName: Richard Zeile\nRichard Zeile did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request and does not appear to have an official campaign website.\nEditor’s note: Republican candidate Richard Zeile does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nState Representative – 4th District\nName: Karen Whitsett (D-Incumbent)\nState Rep. Karen Whitsett did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request. You can find more information about Whitsett on the Michigan House Democrats website.\nEditor’s note: Democratic incumbent candidate Karen Whitsett does not have a contested race in the August primary and is running unopposed in November’s general election.\nState Representative – 5th District\nJump to candidate\nName: Crystal Bailey\nCrystal Bailey did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request. You can find more information at Bailey’s campaign website.\nName: Kevin Keys III\nKevin Keys III did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request. You can find more information at Keys’ campaign website.\nName: Eric Love\nEric Love did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request. You can find more information at Love’s campaign website.\nName: Regina Weiss\nAge: 38\nCurrent job: State representative, Michigan House District 6\nEducation: Valparaiso University\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nOriginally from Indiana, I attended Valparaiso University before moving to Michigan to begin my career as a teacher in the Detroit Public Schools Community District. I also served as an Oak Park City Council member until my election to the Michigan State House in 2020, where I have been a strong advocate for increased investments in the local community.\nAs a former educator, I bring to Lansing an in-depth, intimate knowledge of the many issues plaguing Michigan’s public schools and I am dedicated to using that knowledge to help improve education policy at the state level.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 5 seat?\nI’m running for reelection to the State House because I want to continue fighting to improve our education system, restore and expand labor rights, environmental protections, reproductive health care, and overall greater social and economic justice. I am also working hard to retain the Democratic majority in the State House that we worked so hard to flip in 2022. I am a former Detroit Public Schools teacher and an Oak Park City Council member. I first decided to run for state representative because I recognized that most of the decisions being made about public education were being made in Lansing. I wanted to be a strong voice for teachers and students in helping shape education policy. I am a proud mom to twins born just before the general election back in 2022 and am currently working to improve access to child care and universal pre-k in Michigan.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nAs a former teacher, education policy is deeply personal to me. We need to continue to work towards funding our public schools more equitably and increase investments back into the classroom to ensure that educational attainment is not determined by zip code.\nInvesting in our local communities improves the quality of life for everyone. I support critical investments in water affordability and safety, affordable housing, infrastructure, public transit, and economic development support for small businesses.\nClimate change is an existential threat that we must address here in Michigan by investing in renewable energy, holding corporate polluters accountable, and protecting our air and water.\nWe must also address the harms of centuries of racial inequality by tackling the systemic issues that have resulted from racist policies and legislation. I believe in large-scale criminal justice reform, including ending mandatory minimum sentencing, abolishing cash bail, and eliminating pre-trial detention except in extreme cases when necessary to prevent imminent violence or flight risks. I also believe in economic justice, supporting a raise in the minimum wage to $15, guaranteeing paid sick time and paid family leave, and instituting a graduated income tax.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nCommon sense gun legislation continues to be one of my top priorities as a legislator. As a teacher, I’ve had to make concrete plans for what would happen if an active shooter entered my school and my classroom. I’ve seen the fear in my students’ faces when we practiced lockdown drills and thought to themselves, “Am I next?” As a city councilwoman, I’ve seen how communities have been ravaged by gun violence and how public spaces can be turned into sites of tragedy instead of connection.\nAt the state level, we have enacted some gun-sense reforms that I have supported. These include universal background checks, safe storage laws, extreme risk protection order legislation, and domestic gun violence prevention. We can do more, and it will require a coordinated state and federal response.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI believe that a key component of health justice and the fundamental right to health care is reproductive justice. I wholeheartedly believe in a person’s right to make their own decisions about their reproductive health, and for the right to decide if, when, and how they have children.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nWe are very limited as to what we can do at the state level to fight global inflation. I have supported many measures at the state level to help alleviate some of the financial pressures that families experience. One example is that the state of Michigan now provides universal school meals which saves a family an average of $800-$900 per year per child.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nAs the only incumbent in this race, my opponents do not have a legislative voting record that I can comment on.\nName: Will Sears\nWill Sears did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request and does not appear to have an official campaign website.\nEditor’s note: Republican candidate Will Sears does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nState Representative – 6th District\nJump to candidate\nName: Joseph Fisher\nAge: 42\nCurrent job: Self employed\nEducation: B.A. German from Wayne State University\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nJoseph Fisher, born on May 14, 1982, in Southfield, Michigan, and raised in Royal Oak, has built a diverse and impactful career. With a strong foundation in technology, Joseph has been adept with computers since the age of 12 and possesses skills in web and graphic design. He earned a degree in German from Wayne State University, where he also studied U.S. foreign policy in East Africa while on the debate team.\nProfessionally, Joseph has contributed significantly to the mobile industry, focusing on consumer protection. His career includes a year in Munich, Germany, where he studied, worked and eventually secured a position with a German company. An advocate for public transit and mental health, Joseph believes in accessible, affordable quality care for all Michiganders.\nIn his free time, Joseph performs stand-up comedy and enjoys watching Detroit City FC games with his dad. His experiences and interests reflect his commitment to community well-being, technological advancement, and lifelong learning. Since moving back to Michigan in 2020 after over a decade in Virginia, Joseph continues to support initiatives that foster sustainable and supportive communities.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 6 seat?\nI’m running because I love my hometown and the surrounding community and think I’d be an important voice on legislative issues regarding AI and technology.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nThe top three issues I’d like to focus on is substance abuse prevention, mental health care and the justice system. I’d like there to be a mandate that county jails must offer in-person visits. I’d like to expand Medicaid to cover better mental health services and offer a “Do Not Serve” endorsement in identification that can be requested by an individual or enforced by a court. Would increase ID checking compliance.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nOn gun reform I think our current laws are pretty adequate but always open to suggestion.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI support abortion rights during all trimesters of pregnancy.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nThe state can’t do much to reign in inflation. Personally, I hope the Fed keeps rates high though that is looking unlikely.\nWhat actions/decision by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI have no qualms with my challenger I just feel I bring more multidisciplinary experience to the table.\nName: Natalie Price\nState Rep. Natalie Price did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request.

I am a Midwest States Executive Committee member of the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators. As a State Rep., I serve on the following committees: Higher Education; Local Gov’t. and Municipal Finance; Natural Resources, Environment, Tourism, and Outdoor Recreation; Agriculture (Majority Vice Chair).\nI’m a member of the following caucuses: Detroit; Legislative Latino; Legislative Disability; Legislative Autism; Labor; Poverty & Homelessness; Progressive Women’s. My husband and I have lived in Harper Woods for 25 years; where I served on Harper Woods City Council 2015-2022, and previously was a board member for both the Library and the Parks & Recreation Dept. I have a BFA degree from Wayne State University, and an MA from New York University. I am a former executive board member of the Grosse Pointe Democratic Club; previously worked at Focus: HOPE and at Detroit Public Television.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 10 seat?\nTo continue to work with constituents for legislation of particular importance to them\n(currently includes housing, disabilities, seniors, energy and environment). To advocate for state budget funds. (My current district received budget funding to revitalize East Warren Ave. on Detroit’s east side and build infrastructure to reduce sewage overflows into Lake St. Clair.) To continue policy work relevant to my roles as Majority Vice Chair of the Agriculture Committee, and a member of committees for Natural Resources/Environment, Local Gov’t., and Higher Education.\nI am particularly interested in legislation which is equitable. Also, as the only\nHispanic/Latino of 110 Representatives in the State House, I would like to continue\nmeaningful representation of the ethnic and cultural diversity of this state.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n1. Democracy. My colleagues and I have worked on legislation addressing fair and safe\nelections, government transparency and civil rights.\n2. Housing. My colleagues and I have been working on legislation concerning the need\nfor new housing. I’m particularly interested in legislation which helps people stay in\ntheir homes; housing availability and affordability (I have sponsored one in a package of bills that addresses short-term rentals) and worker housing.\n3. Environment. We need clean water for drinking and also for agriculture, which in turn will support tourism and recreation in the state.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI strongly believe there’s a need for gun reform at the national level. However, regarding state government, I have co-sponsored and voted “yes” for gun safety legislation, as well as related judicial and criminal justice reform. I do believe there should be a ban on AR-15-type and other assault weapons and bump stocks.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI believe in reproductive rights for all, and have co-sponsored and voted “yes” for relevant legislation. I am endorsed by the Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nFrom a state government perspective, I believe my colleagues and I have passed and are working on legislation which cuts taxes for families (EITC), saves families grocery money (no charge breakfasts and lunches for students -12), repeals the Republican tax on pensions, etc.\nEnacting good legislation for the environment, education, and transportation, and career training, will encourage more and better business that offers living wages.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI am not aware of my Democratic primary challenger’s political stance or concerns beyond local municipal issues. I am not aware of the Republican candidate’s stance on state issues and government.\nName: Griffin Wojtowicz\nAge: 36\nCurrent job: Public educator\nEducation: BA with Education Certification\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nAs a Christian, husband, father, public educator who was born and raised in the Detroit\narea, I know that times are tough. I vow to serve the new District 10 on the values of Faith, Family and Liberty.\nAfter high school graduation I received a certification in construction and technology from Oakland Technical Schools. Upon entering the workforce, I secured a position as a project manager in Royal Oak. This role allowed me to understand firsthand the vital support that small businesses need to thrive.\nPursuing my passion for music, I graduated magna cum laude from Oakland University in 2018. During my time there, I took master classes with award-winning guitarists, performed with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and toured Europe with the Oakland\nChorale. These experiences shaped my perspective, instilling a deep appreciation for our country and its freedoms. In addition to performing I also earned my certification in Music Education. As a teacher, I have revitalized music programs, by working with inherently culturally diverse communities.\nI understand the needs of families and the positive impact we can achieve when unhindered by state mandates. We have an opportunity to rebuild Michigan and restore its greatness as America’s High Five.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 10 seat?\nLeadership over the past two years has resulted in significant government expansion,\nunnecessary bureaucratic red tape for small businesses, and limited educational opportunities without viable solutions. I aim to propose legislation as well as cast my vote to roll back programs that have harmed families, education, and businesses.\nWhat are the top 3 priority issues that the State of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nProtecting Michigan and its future, educational freedom, and accountability. For too long, Michiganders have been misled. Educators and public institutions are disenfranchised by trojan horse leftist policies while a neo-Marxian [agenda] runs rampant. Parents are confused and bewildered by the state monopolized local school system. With the removal of the third grade reading standards, parental rights and educational freedom is needed.\nLocal business growth is being stifled by the same politicians who destroyed an estimated 38% of small businesses during the shutdown. Now red tape, occupational licensing regulations, taxes, and potential EV mandates? We have seen the destruction from the state absolutism and their mandates. It’s time we protect children, families, businesses, and limit the government from its reach.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nThe second amendment is quite clear — the right to bear arms shall not be infringed.\nIt is now easier to have an abortion than to purchase a firearm in Michigan. This is a problem for self-defense and even for non-lethal means.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI believe in the sanctity of every life. With that said, there should be limited exceptions for rape and incest. I am strictly opposed to late term abortion but in support of policies to help mothers with prenatal/postnatal and parental care.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nRoll back state taxation/licensure since it has extorted Michiganders for destructive projects that hurt families and businesses. Stop solar mandates, drop the gas tax and reduce property taxes. Putting more money in Michiganders pockets benefits small business, tourism and families. Stop no fault insurance, which is driving up the cost of vehicle insurance for everyone. No fault bolsters the catastrophic/general fund, and lines the pockets of special interest lobbyists, while preventing Michiganders to keep more of their hard earned money.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI would have voted no on all of the following or proposed opposite legislation:\n- HB4138: Trojan horse bill to limit freedoms of individuals who want to defend themselves with tasers which now require background checks. When purchasing a firearm one receives two background checks if they do not have a CPL. I stand with the constitution and swore that I would when becoming a teacher. Public servants take oaths and I kept mine.\n- HB5507: Another Trojan horse extorting taxes from the poor to pay for community college degrees when many still haven’t had the funds to pay back their own student loans. This along with $670 million being deducted from teachers pensions is INEXCUSABLE.\n- HB4699 Elections: “Provisions regarding permanent mail ballot voters” we all saw what happened at the TCF Center* and now it’s permanent along with HB4697 for drop boxes.\n*Editor’s note: The purported claim of voter fraud at the TCF Center in Detroit during the 2020 presidential election — that tens of thousands of illegal ballots were delivered eight hours after the deadline — has been proven false. These claims are based on a misunderstanding of the ballot deadline and how ballot deliveries work in large jurisdictions such as Detroit.\n- SB0398 allows emergency powers to be given to a private business by merging government and private industry.* If you know any history about Europe during the twentieth century, this doesn’t end well.\n*Editor’s note: Michigan’s enrolled SB0398 does not give emergency powers to a private business. Rather, it expanded the power of Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) — a state agency — to enforce an emergency cleanup during an environmental crisis.\nEditor’s note: Republican candidate Griffin Wojtowicz does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Donavan McKinney\nState Rep.

Biange\nAge: 57\nEducation: Oakland University: Psychology Degree Macomb Community College: Mathematics and Science Degrees\nCurrent job: Current USDA Agricultural Specialist; Former Army Lieutenant; Case Worker; STEM Engineering Technician.\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI’ve lived in Macomb County all of my life. From birth to 1994 in Eastpointe. From 1994 to 2024 in Saint Clair Shores. I’ve owned my home in Saint Clair Shores for 30 years. I was an Army Lieutenant in the Medical Service Corps from 2002 to 2010. I have multiple degrees and multiple certifications from Oakland University and Macomb Community College. I like to get the community together for farmers markets, concerts, charities, karaoke, etc. I have many ideas of how to shape our District into a wonderful and charming community with soulful architecture, recreational activities and exercise thoroughfares. I enjoy studying psychology in hopes of gaining a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the cognitive and physiological processes of human behavior. The process of exploring research questions as they pertain to intelligence, memory, categorization, and self actualization is very fascinating to me. My research interest is the relationship between neuropsychology and behavioral conditioning and their correlation to specific intelligence and self actualization.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 12 seat?\nI’d like to review education and training proposals and amendments. I plan on drafting pro-workforce bills and influencing legislation. I aim to critique bills and make improvements to our socioeconomic trajectory. I will develop a spirited economy and infuse more vibrancy into our communities. I plan to create employment opportunities and sociocultural amenities for everyone. I’ll provide a better quality of life for everyone.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Economy. Our current economy has limited socioeconomic growth. A wedged economy lacks a diverse set of social co-operatives, nonprofits and investor enterprises. It also lacks sufficient eco-technology, training and careers. We need to advance our financial economy by developing a sustainable eco-system and recalibrating a wider and more values-driven social system. I’ll work to create legislation that builds a strong socioeconomic and ecological Michigan.\n- Education. These four essential elements are conducive to academic learning: The teacher’s role to act as a guide. Student access to hands-on activities. Student choices and curiosity to direct their learning. Student opportunity to practice skills in a safe environment. I will work to create meaningful policies.\n- Environment. Lessen dependence on fossil fuels. Embrace sustainable energy solutions such as wind and solar. Protect our lakes through sustainable practices. Develop a smart grid. Be more conscious of how we use energy. I will work to diversify our energy jobs and resources.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nSensible access to firearms\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nChoice\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nDiversify the economy. Diversify agricultural, medical, energy and environmental resources.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nMy challengers have not participated in any political actions/decisions as of yet. I’m a critical thinker and I have fresh legislative ideas that will create a better quality of life for all of us.\nName: Kimberly Edwards\nState Rep.

I’m an independent thinker that’s not obligated to follow any special interest groups’ agenda.\nI refuse to spend thousands of dollars on billboards and lawn signs! Those funds can be used to help the woman I saw curled in the fetal position in front of Walmart on Gratiot at 12 mile in Roseville as well as the homeless woman seated in a lawn chair inside the Walmart parking lot on Van Dyke at 12 mile in Warren.\nI’ve been a public servant for over 40 years. I’ve worked as an election inspector during primary, special and general elections for various counties. I was employed as an income tax investigator (city of Detroit Finance Department). I was employed with the Sickle Cell Association of America, Michigan Chapter, as a tutor for students battling sickle cell disease. I’ve fundraised over $10,000 for various charities to assist with research to cure diseases that constituents are battling.\nI have a servitude spirit. It’s not “beneath me” to work on the battlefield with those vulnerable constituents in order to meet their needs.\nI strongly believe in term limits, including how often a lawmaker can campaign for reelection.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 13 seat?\nI added my name to the ballot for Michigan State House Representative District 13 (Roseville, portions of Warren, portions of St. Clair Shores) because I’m determined to ensure that the 1991 Michigan Mental Health Code is revised to permit audio and video recordings inside adult foster care homes.\nI attended recipient rights training on May 24, 2024. I saw photos of deplorable living conditions that residents inside adult foster care homes are subjected to. Residents are and have been physically and verbally abused by aggressive staff. Once elected I will draft a bill to permit audio and video recordings to protect the mentally disabled community. They deserve a better life than abuse.\nA Macomb County Principal shared earlier this year that the substitute teacher-student ratio during recess is 1 substitute teacher per 100 students. That is an unsafe ratio. I am campaigning for state representative to draft a bill to hire more paraprofessionals. Their presence add value inside and outside the classroom.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nThe top 3 issues Michigan is facing is the corporate tax structure, the infrastructure and underfunded teachers’ pension fund.\nOnce I’m elected I will work in concert with fellow law makers to address corporations’ failure to pay their fair share of corporate taxes. I encourage all Michiganders to peruse the Mackinac Center for Public Policy’s website often. There’s a wealth of information on the website regarding how many MILLIONS of dollars corporations receive in tax credits.\nThe definition of insanity is doing the SAME thing and expecting DIFFERENT results. The Michigan roads need repairing. Using concrete destroying rock salt will cause future pot holes, year after year. Once elected, I will work in concert with the Michigan Department of Transportation to advocate for alternatives to use to melt ice. As a candidate I contacted the Michigan Department of Transportation. I was informed bi-products are currently being used along with rock salt to melt ice faster.\nUnder no circumstances should condo homeowners be required to pay thousands of dollars (due to a special assessments) to repair their street. Condo home owners already pay a monthly homeowner’s association fee and they pay thousands of dollars in property tax. Road repairs should be the responsibility of the county.\nMy understanding is the teachers’ pension fund has been underfunded for over five decades by BILLIONS of dollars. How is this NOT a priority?\nOnce elected I will work with lawmakers to address this issue. Our retired teachers/administrators deserve stability. They’ve contributed to the education system for decades.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI agree with the current gun laws in Michigan, especially the Castle Doctrine. I agree that oversight is mandatory to ensure the Hunting Heritage Protection Act (No Net Loss) and other gun ownership concerns are fairly addressed.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI’m pro-choice. The government has no business dictating what a women does with her body. The government should concentrate on securing our borders.\nDuring my campaign, a MALE constituent suggested the Supreme Court consider mandatory vasectomies since they are reverseable. All current birth control can endanger the woman’s body. The major side effects of the birth control pill includes heart attack, stroke and blood clots.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nThe solution to inflation is to mandate laws to make corporations pay their fair share in taxes. I’m very impressed that a Texas oil company, Hilcorp, granted every employee a $100,000 bonus! (secretaries, janitors, security guards).\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI would be pleased if current candidates, who either are incumbents or have served as state representatives previously, address the concerns that I have outlined on my website.\nName: Richard Steenland\nAge: 62\nCurrent job: Rental/building inspector for the city of Roseville\nEducation: Graduated from Roseville Brablec High School (1979); associate’s degree from Macomb Community College (1992) in general studies; attended Oakland University January 1993 – January 1995\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nMy father was a Roseville police officer for 33 years. He instilled in me the importance of community service and giving back. I am running for my second term in the Michigan House because I believe that I am a pragmatic problem-solver looking to deliver results for the communities I represent. I served as state representative of the 22nd House District from January 2021-December 2022; as Roseville City Clerk from November 2007-November 2020; on the Roseville City Council (November 1993-November 2007); and as Roseville Mayor Pro Tem (November 2005-November 2007). During my first term, as well as in my previous elected positions, my voting record and actions have always reflected my belief that I am there to represent my constituents to the best of my ability. Every one of the bills that I introduced had bipartisan cosponsors because it was important to put politics aside to get things done to make a positive impact on my constituents’ lives. I am proud to have been tied for the most bills signed into law by a House Democratic legislator when I served in the minority party. Experience and results matter for the residents of the 13th House District.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 13 seat?\nI am running for a second term because I believe experience and results matter. My priorities include the creation of good paying jobs for our residents, strengthening our communities through investment in public education and expanded workforce training programs, keeping our communities safe by funding police/fire, fixing our roads/water infrastructure, lowering auto insurance, protecting our environment, providing tax relief to working families/seniors experiencing increased costs of living and improving access to health care/mental health. I am the only candidate with a proven track record of bipartisanship and results. In my first term in the Michigan House, I tied for the most bills signed into law by a House Democrat despite being in the minority party. It required building the necessary relationships and navigating the legislative process to achieve results. I am the only candidate in the race ready to hit the ground running on day one.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Economy/Jobs. As the only candidate with a proven track record of bipartisanship during my first term in the Michigan House, I will work to bring good paying jobs to Macomb County and support economic investments in our communities. We must do a better job incentivizing business development by working with advanced manufacturing/defense sectors and our communities to Make Macomb Their Home. We must invest in public education and expand workforce training programs to prepare our residents to succeed.\n- Lowering costs for families, homeowners and seniors. Inflation has hurt many residents and we must work on tax policy that lowers the burden on families, homeowners and seniors. I will work to lower the rates of auto and homeowners’ insurance by fighting the insurance companies and hold them accountable for redlining and gouging customers. I also will work with my colleagues to provide tax credits to families and seniors to help combat inflation by ending corporate giveaways that ill-fated efforts like the SOAR fund have created.\n- Keeping our communities safe. I will work to ensure our police and fire have the resources to do their jobs by making sure revenue sharing is fully funded as a priority in the state budget. I will also work to improve access to mental health and substance abuse counseling by requiring insurance companies to fully cover these critical services and ensuring we have enough providers for these services.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nIn addition to supporting policies such as universal background checks, extreme risk protection orders, secure gun storage laws, gun safety education, red flag laws, protecting victims of domestic violence, funding Community Violence Intervention programs and other gun safety legislation, we must do better to improve access and funding to mental health services. It is an issue that hits very close to home for many families and communities, and we must be more proactive in getting people the help and support they need before someone is hurt. It truly takes a village.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI am 100% pro-choice. I have been endorsed by Planned Parenthood. As a father of two daughters myself, I do not want government telling them what to do with their bodies. I firmly believe individuals should have the right to make their own private reproductive health care decisions without government interference.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nAs state representative, I would work with my legislative colleagues to provide some meaningful form of tax relief for our families and seniors to combat inflation. I am looking at a sort of a tax credit using the funds that the Legislature and governor has been spending to provide corporations (SOAR) with corporate handouts. I will also work to lower auto insurance and homeowners’ rates.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nMy opponent voted for an education budget without reading the actual bill or reaching out to her school districts to understand its full impact. If the bill was actually read, she would have noticed it cut public school safety and student mental health funding by 90%, takes away from teacher’s retirements, and does not provide for an increase in per pupil funding for the first time since Governor Snyder took office in 2011. In addition, the budget does not even cover the inflationary cost increases school districts have to face in this economy, potentially forcing cuts and layoffs in the classroom. Meanwhile, charter schools and cyber schools are big winners in this budget to the tune of a 3.9% boost in their per pupil funding while Roseville Community Schools, Warren Woods, Warren Consolidated and Lake Shore get no per pupil increase. She voted for a budget that Betsy DeVos would have truly been proud of.\nMy father was the School Board President for the Roseville Community Schools and nothing is more important than educating our children. I would never ever support a budget that fails to invest in our students and classrooms and would never support a budget that puts for-profit charter and cyber schools ahead of our public schools. (Source: Macomb ISD budget information, Detroit News article, July 23, 2024: “Whitmer signs $23.4B education budget amid concerns over stagnant school operating funds”)\nAs a County Commissioner, my opponent voted against a resolution commemorating Patriot Week and Constitution Day in Macomb County. My father served in the Roseville Police Department for 33 years and to minimize the importance of our first responders and military personal who put their lives on the line each and every day to keep us safe to score cheap political points is something I would never do or support. The Michigan Legislature commemorates 9/11 every year and for someone to be so callous with their statements by missing the entire purpose of a week honoring the sacrifices made on 9/11. Patriot Week has turned a national tragedy into a valuable teaching moment for all to better understand our nation and appreciate how far we have come.\nName: Mai Xiong\nAge: 39\nCurrent job: State Representative\nEducation: Taubman Fellow, Harvard Kennedy School; MPLP Alumni, Michigan State University; BFA, College for Creative Studies\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nMy husband Adam and I are proud parents to four children. We love our community and want to do our part to make it an even better place to raise a family, find a job, or start a business.\nI was born in a refugee camp in Thailand to parents who fled war and escaped persecution in Laos. I have made Michigan my home for over two decades. I moved to Detroit at 18 to attend the College for Creative Studies. I took the SMART bus from Warren to Detroit.\nAs the current 13th District State Representative, it’s my honor to be a voice for all families. I’m running for reelection because residents in the 13th District deserve accessible roads and water infrastructure that keeps our families healthy and safe. I’m committed to maintaining respect for our seniors and workers, fully funding police and fire services, and supporting our teachers and classrooms.\nDuring my time in office, I’m proud to have worked with my colleagues in the legislature to pass a budget that invests in safeguarding our environment, provides a pathway to higher education for future generations, supports families and maternal health, and improves our infrastructure.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 13 seat?\nI’ve worked hard to earn the support of my constituents, who have entrusted me with this role. Earlier this year, I won a special election to serve the remaining term of the 102nd Legislature. I am humbly asking the residents of the 13th District to reelect me to serve the next full term. We must continue to address critical issues impacting our families. From ensuring that our children have a quality education, to creating safer neighborhoods and well-paying jobs, I’m here to be a voice for all families. I look forward to continuing to meet directly with residents where they are at to listen to their concerns.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nI believe we must protect those who have protected us our whole lives. Keeping seniors as independent as possible, in their own homes, and providing the respect, care, and support they deserve is my priority. I will continue to ensure that senior services and family caregiver programs are adequately funded to meet the needs of our present and future senior populations.\nThe 13th District, situated in Macomb County, is home to one-of-a-kind natural resources. Our own Lake St. Clair is the heart of the Great Lakes. I will continue to work to protect our precious and natural resources for our children and generations to come. I will continue to be a strong supporter of protecting our drinking water and natural resources.\nWe deserve safe and reliable roads to get our families to school and work. The conditions of our roads are unacceptable. The residents of Warren deserve better. I will continue to stand up for the residents of the 13th District to ensure that we receive our fair share of road funding and infrastructure investments.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nUnder the leadership of Governor Whitmer and the Democrats majority, my colleagues have passed meaningful legislation to address gun safety. I will do everything in my power to ensure that we continue to protect our children and families from gun violence. I’m proud to be endorsed by organizations dedicated to saving lives from gun violence, like Giffords, which was founded by a survivor, gun safety advocate, and former congresswoman Gabby Giffords.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI firmly believe that women should have access to comprehensive reproductive health care, and that families deserve the autonomy to make decisions about how and when they start their families. I am honored to have the endorsement of Reproductive Freedom for All and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nTo address the inflation crisis and lower costs for families, I believe that we must take a multifaceted approach. First, ensuring that corporations pay their fair share in taxes is crucial. I will work with my colleagues to create legislation that funds essential services and reduces the financial burden on working families.\nSecondly, we need to combat price gouging by holding private companies accountable for unfair pricing practices, especially during times of economic hardship. I will work to strengthen regulations and increase transparency to help prevent exploitation and protect consumers. I recently worked with my colleagues to introduce legislation that strengthens consumer protection and co-sponsored legislation to eliminate the “Dark Store” tax loophole that big-box retailers use to lower tax liability.\nAdditionally, we must continue to invest in infrastructure, renewable energy, and education to stimulate economic growth, create well-paying jobs, and provide families with more financial stability. Supporting small businesses and local economies will also contribute to a more resilient and equitable economic environment.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI am focused on the work that I am doing today to ensure that we continue to make progress in our state. My priority is to advocate for policies that support our community, such as expanding access to affordable health care, improving our education system, and investing in sustainable infrastructure. My commitment is to work collaboratively with stakeholders and constituents to address the pressing issues we face and to build a brighter future for our state. Working together, we can create a better quality of life for all residents and a brighter future.\nName: Jerrie Bowl Bilello\nJerrie Bowl Bilello did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request.

My parents taught me the value of hard work and the importance of providing for a family. My father woke up at 4:00 every morning in order to get to work by 5:30. A proud UAW member, he retired from General Motors after almost 40 years. My mother worked at my elementary school as a homeroom parent, then as a lunch aide, and finally as the school secretary.\nIn the time since I was first elected to office in 2019, I have worked hard to push my community forward on issues of funding for our firefighters, advocating for inclusion and respect, and working collaboratively with anyone who cares about helping our area and our neighbors thrive.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 14 seat?\nI am running for reelection as State Representative because I am committed to continuing the progress we’ve made here in Michigan. Over the past term, I have worked tirelessly to address key issues such as education, mental health care, and economic development. I aim to ensure that our district remains a vibrant and thriving place for every resident.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Probably the biggest issue facing Michiganders right now is inflation, from medications to housing, it’s hitting everyone hard. If I’m reelected I will continue to work to do what I can to lower the costs of everyday necessities like prescription drugs. I’m currently working on a bill (HB 5338) that will make sure pharmaceutical rebates benefit you — the customer — and are no longer used by insurance companies and pharmacies to increase their profits.\n- Attracting and retaining talent here in Michigan. We already know that young people prioritize quality of life when looking for places to live and work, like housing they can afford, reliable public transit, and low cost of living. Investments in public transit and affordable housing spur economic development and attract and retain a talented workforce. If we pass my “Make it in Michigan Fund” legislation, it will do just that.\n- Mental health is the topic that comes up most often when I’m out campaigning. It seems like everyone’s family has been impacted by mental health concerns. We must build a strong mental health care system that works for all Michiganders. I will continue to fight for more funding and do everything I can to de-stigmatize mental health and get people the help they need.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI support commonsense gun legislation, and so do most Michiganders. That’s why I was proud to be able to vote in favor of the Red Flag, Gun Storage, and Background Check legislation this session.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nMedical decisions are between you and your doctor. No one else. Women can make their own medical decisions without government interference.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nOne of the ways we could be battling inflation is to go after the companies that are artificially inflating their prices. Many corporations are reporting record profits, taking advantage of the crisis and making it worse. It’s a consumer protection issue.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI run on my record and accomplishments. From my MI Secure Retirement legislation (HB 5461), working to make sure all Michiganders have access to a retirement savings program to my Step Therapy legislation (HB 5339) that keeps insurance out of your medical decisions, I’m working on people-centered priorities.\nName: Barbara Barber\nBarbara Barber did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request and does not appear to have an official campaign website.\nEditor’s note: Republican candidate Barbara Barber does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Erin Byrnes\nState Rep.

Young is serving her second term as state representative of Michigan’s newly created 16th House District. After graduating from Cass Technical High School and Michigan State University’s James Madison College, Rep. Young’s first professional job was as a legislative aide to a former state representative. Through her work with several former state representatives, numerous mayoral administrations and community advocacy organizations, including the Detroit Area Agency on Aging, Young has put her leadership and relationship building skills to use to improve the lives of her community members at every step. Rep. Young is the proud mother of two sons, both graduates of the legendary Cass Technical High School. Her oldest received his Bachelor’s in Animation from the University of St. Francis and her youngest received his Bachelor’s in finance at Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business. She is also the proud Mom-owner of her four-legged adopted “son” who has been part of her family for more than 10 years. Young is also a licensed and ordained minister in the Christian faith and is affectionately known as Elder Steph, at her home church, Historic Pure Word MBC, which is in her District.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 16 seat?\nTo continue the work of building stronger communities by ensuring our young people have a chance to prosper beginning with a quality education; working families make living wages with just one job; and people in need can afford their medication, without sacrificing other life necessities.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Housing crisis. Continue working with the local, state and federal leaders to secure funding to building more affordable housing, coupled with subsidies to ensure everyone has an opportunity to live in safe affordable housing.\n- Childcare crisis. Our workforce suffers when qualified employees are unable to go to work for lack of childcare. According to a 2023 U.S. News report, the lack of affordable child care costs the U.S. economy $122 billion annually, including $78 billion in lost earnings and job search expenses for families. This is because parents may miss work, be fired, or leave the workforce entirely when they can’t find adequate child care.*Google search\n- Quality public education. There is no way to have a thriving economy without equipping our young people with quality, public education.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI support the efforts implemented during this current legislative session: universal background checks, safe storage and extreme risk protection orders, of which I had a bill signed into law. There, however, is much more work to do as it relates to curbing urban gun violence and getting illegal guns off the streets.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI support choice and during this debate like to reiterate that abortion laws do not force anyone to have an abortion. I also support making contraceptives more accessible.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nContinue to support working families and seniors through tax credits to keep dollars in their pockets.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nMy challenger is unique. I encourage you to do your research.

In that time, I have introduced legislation to repeal Michigan’s draconian criminal abortion ban and expand access to abortion, move our state closer to a clean energy future, improve access to treatments for heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension, and to make our state safer for the LGBTQ+ community. However, there is significant work that remains. I also prioritize the public service aspect of my role as a legislator. During the COVID crisis, my office worked around the clock to assist our constituents in obtaining unemployment funds. We act as a resource in contacting various state departments to help residents address issues they may be having. I am running to retain my seat because I have been a dedicated public servant to the people of the 17th House District and I would like to continue working for them in Lansing.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nThe top three issues facing our state are the housing shortage, education outcomes, and the need to grow our population.\nTo address the housing shortage, we not only need to build additional housing, but build a variety of housing, including multi-family and affordable housing. This also requires reform around housing policy itself. We have worked this term to prohibit rental discrimination based on income, but there is far more work to do to make sure housing is accessible for all Michiganders.\nRegarding education outcomes, we have invested in increased and equitable funding for our schools, as well as free breakfast and lunch for all public school students, both of which have been helpful. Expanding pre-K programs will also benefit Michigan students, as will policies that recruit and retain teachers, such as providing them more leverage when negotiating contracts and removing standardized testing from teacher evaluations. As the results of these policies solidify, they will help guide what additional legislation will provide better outcomes. Tackling population growth requires a holistic approach. We have made Michigan a place young people want to live and start families by ensuring reproductive freedom and codifying protections for the LGBTQ+ community. Our work in education and infrastructure also make Michigan more attractive. However, we are still losing residents, often to states that have robust university research programs. Investing in these programs will help, as will investing in public transit.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI supported policies that Michigan Democrats signed into law this term, such as extreme risk protection orders, safe storage, universal background checks, and enhanced prohibitions on domestic abusers purchasing firearms. I’ve also supported funding community violence intervention programs, which have dramatically decreased gun violence. However, additional policies are necessary. Civilians having access to weapons of war is thoroughly unnecessary and has had deadly, tragic consequences.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI sponsored the bill to repeal Michigan’s criminal abortion ban and the Reproductive Health Act, which repealed medically unnecessary and burdensome restrictions on abortion care designed to make it less accessible. Abortion is a human right, and I support every person’s right to make their own decisions about their reproductive futures.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nInflation is a difficult problem to solve on the state level. However, the legislature has worked to ease some of the burdens on Michigan families. We repealed the pension tax and expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit. We ensured free breakfast and lunch for all public school students. We expanded programs such as Michigan Reconnect to make higher education or trade school more affordable. We have enacted policies to put money back in the pockets of Michiganders to mitigate the burden inflation has created, and that is work that I’m extremely proud of.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nMy challenger’s campaign has been virtually non-existent, but prior to filing for this office, she participated in book banning rallies in Dearborn. I thoroughly oppose the banning of books. The practice is reminiscent of authoritarian governments that led to atrocities and is rooted in antisemitism, racism, and homophobia. Books are not weapons and we should not be afraid of expanding our world views.\nEditor’s note: Democratic incumbent candidate Laurie Pohutsky does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Rola Makki\nRola Makki did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request and does not appear to have an official campaign website.\nEditor’s note: Republican candidate Rola Makki does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nState Representative – 18th District\nJump to candidate\nName: Jason Hoskins\nState Rep.

I\nwas a member of Farmington Hills City Council for eight years before running for state office. I am a breast cancer survivor myself and have seen firsthand how high health care costs have affected our country and state. I have always wondered what my ‘why’ was and now I know that it is to use my experience to make a difference for the lives of\nothers.\nDuring my time as a state representative I have passed legislation that will\npositively impact the lives of other breast cancer survivors and their families. I passed HB 4071 which would make oral chemo covered the same by insurance as IV chemo and passed the Michigan Family Protection Act making sure that children born via surrogate are protected by law. I am also the chair of the appropriations subcommittee on Higher Education, I am doing everything I can to make higher education more affordable and accessible than ever before and am very proud of the work my colleagues and I have accomplished this legislative session, but we have only begun.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 19 seat?\nI’m running for reelection because I want to provide actual solutions for Michigan, not just talk about our problems. I’m an ordinary person who is facing the same challenges\nyou are. I understand how hard it is to get ahead when you’re trying to pay for health\ninsurance, rent, basic living expenses, and student loans on wages that have been too low for too long. I have the drive and the experience to continue representing our community in Lansing, and I’m ready to continue working toward an amazing future for all of us.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Health care. I am determined to make health care affordable and equitable for all\nMichiganders. I have sponsored and cosponsored over a dozen pieces of legislation that would support this. These include HB 4071 oral chemo parity, HB 4409, which would require drug manufacturers to disclose any increase in price of prescriptions. Drug transparency is something that is very much needed in our state so that we can hold these drug companies accountable. - Education. I have worked in higher education before running for office and I saw firsthand how the cost of attendance is high and is affecting Michiganders. I am working to make college more affordable with things like the Michigan achievement scholarship, Michigan Reconnect and investing in our higher education. Over the past 40 years we have seen the state divest in education and our citizens have suffered.\n- The environment. We are so lucky to be surrounded by the Great Lakes and we must do everything we can to protect them and our abundant amount of natural resources here in Michigan. I have personally been working on legislation that would curb the effects of climate change but also make sure that any new infrastructure plans that we have are environmentally friendly. As a member of the transportation appropriations sub-committee we have passed budgets that put renewable energy and environmental protections at the forefront and I will continue to do so.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI am doing everything I can to pass common sense gun reform. So many of our communities have been affected by gun violence and almost everybody knows someone who has been affected by it. Something must be done, we are working vigorously in Lansing to bring gun reform to Michigan, but we have only just begun.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI am a proud pro-choice candidate and legislator. I do not believe that the government should have any say in what decisions are made between a patient and their doctor. I have actually sponsored a bill in the Reproductive Health Act, HB 4957 which pertains to abortion services in Higher Education institutions.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nThanks to the good work of the president and the FED our inflation rate currently in the U.S. is reasonable and I thank my colleagues at the federal level for this. However I do know that prices have been very high and our middle class has suffered. I will continue to do everything I can to take some of the pressure off of Michiganders as much as I can. As we know inflation occurs when there is an increase in demand and not enough supply, I would like to ensure that our state is doing everything possible to increase supply from our state. By passing the EITC we can put more money in our families pockets, providing more skilled workers by increasing the amount available and lowering the cost of these training programs. Another way to do this is by decreasing the cost of higher education — more Michiganders will be able to obtain higher paying jobs and people will save money on education costs.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI honestly do not know much about my opponent, I do know that he does not have the background knowledge of working as a public official in our community for as long as I have. I believe that I know what my community needs, I meet with my constituents on a regular basis, I have worked in local government in my district as well and am eager to keep representing the people of District 19.\nEditor’s note: Democratic incumbent candidate Samantha Steckloff does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Kevin Hammer\nKevin Hammer did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request.

With over 20 years of experience in the private sector, especially in real estate, I understand the challenges local businesses face and the importance of creating a pro-business environment to stimulate economic growth and job creation.\nMy commitment to public service is driven by a desire to positively impact our community. I am a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility, lower taxes, and reducing government waste.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 21 seat?\nI am running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 21 seat because I believe in the potential of our community and the power of conservative principles to bring about positive change. Our district deserves a representative who is dedicated to preserving our values, enhancing economic opportunities, and ensuring the safety and well-being of every resident.\nFirst and foremost, I am committed to championing an atmosphere in our state where the private sector can thrive. As a business owner, I understand the importance of balancing budgets and making prudent financial decisions. I will work to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and efficiently, advocating for lower taxes and reducing government waste and regulation. By fostering a pro-business environment, we can attract new investments and create quality jobs that will benefit our entire community.\nEducation is another cornerstone of my campaign. I believe that every child deserves access to a high-quality education that prepares them for the future. I will advocate for policies that support academic excellence, parental choice, improve educational standards, and empower teachers to provide the best possible learning experience for our students. Our children are our future, and it is our responsibility to equip them with the tools they need to succeed.\nPublic safety is also a top priority. I will support our law enforcement officers and work to ensure they have the resources necessary to keep our communities safe. I believe in strong, fair, and effective law enforcement that protects all citizens while respecting individual rights and liberties.\nFinally, I am committed to being a voice for ALL people of District 21 and not special interest groups. I want to be a real leader that will put the interests of the people above politics, above party, and above special interests. I will actively listen to your concerns, represent your interests, and work tirelessly to bring about the changes we need. Together, we can build a stronger, more prosperous community for ourselves and future generations.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nI see three top priority issues facing our state: economic revitalization, education reform, and infrastructure improvement. Here’s how I plan to address each of these issues:\n1. Economic Revitalization\nIssue: Michigan’s economy, while recovering, still faces challenges such as unemployment, underemployment, and the need for new investments in both urban and rural areas.\nActions:\nTax reform: Advocate for lower taxes on businesses to encourage investment and job creation. Simplifying the tax code can also make it easier for businesses to operate and thrive.\nSmall business support: Implement programs that provide grants and low-interest loans to small businesses, especially those impacted by the pandemic. This will help them recover, expand, and hire more workers.\nWorkforce development: Invest in vocational training and apprenticeship programs to equip our workforce with the skills needed for high-demand jobs in sectors such as technology, manufacturing, and health care.\n2. Education reform\nIssue: Michigan’s education system needs significant improvements to ensure that all children receive a high-quality education that prepares them for future success.\nActions:\nSchool choice: Expand school choice options, including charter schools and voucher programs, to give parents more control over their children’s education and to foster competition that can lead to overall improvement in educational quality.\nTeacher support: Increase funding for teacher salaries and professional development to attract and retain top talent in our schools. Ensure teachers have the resources they need to provide high-quality education.\nSTEM focus: Promote Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education to prepare students for the jobs of the future. This includes investing in updated curricula, technology in classrooms, and partnerships with local businesses for real-world learning opportunities.\n3. Infrastructure improvement\nIssue: Michigan’s aging infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and water systems, needs urgent attention to ensure safety and support economic growth.\nActions:\nFunding and investment: Secure increased state and federal funding for infrastructure projects. Explore public-private partnerships to leverage private investment for public infrastructure improvements.\nEfficient use of resources: Ensure that infrastructure projects are completed on time and within budget by implementing stricter oversight and accountability measures. Utilize the latest technologies and materials to extend the lifespan of infrastructure.\nSustainable solutions: Promote sustainable infrastructure solutions that address both immediate needs and long-term environmental impact. This includes investing in green infrastructure, such as renewable energy projects and water conservation systems.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nProtecting Second Amendment rights. First and foremost, I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment and the constitutional right of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms. This right is fundamental to our freedoms and should not be infringed upon. I will oppose any legislation that seeks to unduly restrict the rights of responsible gun owners.\nEnsuring public safety. However, I also recognize the need to address gun violence and enhance public safety. Here are some steps I support to achieve this balance:\n• Enhanced background checks: Implement comprehensive background checks to ensure that firearms do not fall into the hands of criminals, domestic abusers, or individuals with serious mental health issues. Closing loopholes in the current system can prevent dangerous individuals from obtaining guns while respecting the rights of lawful gun owners.\n• Mental health initiatives: Increase funding and resources for mental health services. By identifying and treating mental health issues early, we can reduce the risk of individuals resorting to violence. This includes improving access to mental health care and creating community programs that support those in need.\n• Enforcing existing laws: Strictly enforce existing gun laws to deter illegal gun sales and possession. Ensuring that our current laws are properly implemented and enforced can be an effective way to reduce gun violence without imposing new restrictions on lawful gun owners.\n• Community programs: Support community-based programs that address the root causes of violence. Initiatives such as youth outreach programs, job training, and education can help prevent violence before it starts by providing individuals with positive alternatives.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nWith the passage of Proposition 3 in 2022, abortion is now enshrined in our state’s constitution. As your state representative, I am committed to respecting this law while also providing comprehensive support for women facing unplanned pregnancies. My goal is to ensure that women are aware of and have access to a full range of solutions beyond abortion, including health care, financial assistance, adoption services, and counseling. By offering robust support and resources, we can empower women to make informed choices\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nI believe that we need a multifaceted approach to tackle inflation effectively. Here are my proposed solutions:\n1. Fiscal responsibility\nReduce government spending: One of the key drivers of inflation is excessive government spending. I will advocate for a more disciplined approach to budgeting at the state, focusing on reducing wasteful spending and prioritizing essential services.\nBalanced budgets: Striving for balanced budgets will help ensure that we are not living beyond our means. This fiscal responsibility can help stabilize the economy and reduce inflationary pressures.\n2. Tax relief\nLower taxes: Reducing the tax burden on individuals and businesses can help stimulate economic growth. By allowing people to keep more of their hard-earned money, we can increase consumer spending and investment, which can help counteract inflation.\nTax incentives for small businesses: Providing tax incentives for small businesses can help them thrive despite rising costs. This support can lead to job creation and economic stability.\n3. Regulatory reform\nReduce red tape: Cutting unnecessary regulations can lower costs for businesses, which in turn can help reduce prices for consumers. Streamlining regulatory processes can also encourage innovation and efficiency in the market.\nEnergy independence: Promoting policies that enhance energy independence can help stabilize energy prices, a significant component of inflation. Supporting domestic energy production and alternative energy sources can reduce our reliance on volatile foreign energy markets.\n4. Support for supply chains\nStrengthen supply chains: Investing in infrastructure and technology to strengthen supply chains can help prevent the bottlenecks that contribute to inflation. Encouraging domestic manufacturing and reducing dependency on foreign suppliers can also make our economy more resilient.\nLogistics and transportation improvements: Enhancing logistics and transportation networks can improve the flow of goods and reduce costs associated with delays and inefficiencies.\n5. Monetary policy advocacy\nAdvocate for sound monetary policies: While monetary policy is primarily the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, I will advocate for policies that promote price stability. This includes encouraging the Federal Reserve to carefully manage interest rates and money supply to keep inflation in check.\n6. Encourage innovation and productivity\nInvestment in technology and dducation: Promoting investment in technology and education can boost productivity, which is a key factor in counteracting inflation. By enhancing the skills of our workforce and adopting innovative technologies, we can increase efficiency and reduce costs.\nSupport for research and development: Encouraging research and development can lead to new technologies and processes that lower production costs and improve quality, helping to mitigate inflationary pressures.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nKelly Breen’s voting record shows that she aligns with her party 99.32% of the time, indicating she consistently follows the directives of party leaders and special interest groups rather than considering the diverse needs and opinions of all District 21 residents. This approach limits true representation and fails to address the unique challenges faced by our community.\nAs your representative, I will prioritize the interests of District 21 over party politics. My decisions will be guided by what benefits our community, promoting fiscal responsibility, supporting local businesses, enhancing education, and ensuring public safety. It’s time for leadership that listens to and serves all residents, not just party higher-ups and special interests.\nWhile I respect Kelly Breen’s commitment to serving our community, I believe my approach offers a better path forward for District 21. By focusing on fiscal responsibility, supporting businesses, enhancing education through school choice, and prioritizing public safety, I am confident we can build a stronger, more prosperous Michigan.\nEditor’s note: Republican candidate Thomas Konesky does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nState Representative – 22nd District\nJump to candidate\nName: Matt Koleszar\nAge: 42\nCurrent job: State representative\nEducation: Bachelor of Arts degree in secondary education with a focus on social studies and English from Saginaw Valley State University in 2006, and a Master of Arts degree in English studies for teachers from Eastern Michigan University in 2011.\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI am a public school teacher of 12 years who saw first-hand how decisions being made in Lansing were impacting our schools. Teachers were treated as disposable for years and faced constant budget cuts, step freezes, and layoffs. In 2018 it was clear to me that if no one in Lansing was going to fight for our schools, that I would do it myself.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 22 seat?\nI am running to continue the work of my Education committee to right the wrongs of 40 years of GOP leadership on our public schools. For decades, teachers have been asked to do more with less and we have finally started to take actions to recruit and retain quality teachers in Michigan.\nWhat are the top 3 priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Education. In our 18 months of majority, we have made great strides in restoring teachers’ bargaining rights, funded universal school meals, allowed for inter-state reciprocity for school counselors, created a pathway for retired teachers to return to the classrooms sooner to address the teacher shortage in the state. We’ve also started the work on addressing the literacy crisis and the issue of dyslexia, which is estimated to impact up to 20% of students nationwide. No one of these solutions will fix the problems that our schools have been facing for decades, but they will all play a big role in returning Michigan to its former Top-10 status.\n- Environment. The state should be doing everything we can to protect our air and water, as they are crucial to the survival of our state. I don’t just mean that in regards to the physical health of our residents, but also the health of our entire agricultural and tourism industry. Additionally, anyone found polluting our waterways either out of negligence or to cut corners should be held fully responsible for cleanups and should be fined to ensure it doesn’t happen again.\n- Population retention. While the population has started to grow since 2022, it is important that we continue to make investments in our state to continue to grow and strengthen our workforce. There are many elements that people consider when deciding where to settle down and taxes only make up one piece of that pie. Clean air and water, good public schools, access to transportation and childcare are all important things to consider when trying to attract talent. We have made crucial investments in these categories and I believe we will see the payoff in the years to come.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nMichigan has made great strides in regards to gun safety with the safe storage and red flag laws. These laws have and will continue to save lives from gun violence and suicide.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI 100% support the right to a safe abortion and am proud that our state also overwhelmingly voted to support abortion rights in 2022.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nWhile there are multiple elements at play that surpass the levers that a single state representative can pull, I support AGs across the country going after price gouging. It is no secret that large corporations are seeing record high profits across multiple industries, those profits are almost entirely being made on the backs of working-class families.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nWhile my opponent is unwilling to give any stance on abortion which is a major concern of many in our district, he instead believes that as state representative he will focus his work on immigration which we all know is a federal issue. He also touts his endorsement from GLEP which is Betsy Devos’ organization with the sole mission of decimating our public schools by allowing for tax-payer funded vouchers to be spent at for-profit charter and religious schools.\nEditor’s note: Democratic incumbent candidate Matt Koleszar does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Christian Charette\nChristian Charette did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request. You can find more information at Charette’s campaign website.\nName: Adam Stathakis\nAge: 29\nCurrent job: Director of operations, Stathakis Inc.\nEducation: Hillsdale College, B.A. in accounting\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nGrowing up in Northville Township, hard work was always a priority in my family, and I spent every summer and break working at the family business. My work ethic also extended to school, which paid off when I won a full merit scholarship to attend the Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana. My time at Culver taught me the values of duty and honor to become a leader of character.\nI went on to attend Hillsdale College, which helped shape my views on Conservative ideals such as limited government and the preeminence of the Constitution. I served in student government and led various organizations, graduating with a BA in accounting in 2018. I still serve the college to this day as an alumni volunteer.\nPost-college, I joined my family’s Building Service Contracting Company as an entry level manager, working my way up to my current role as director of operations. I am responsible for 24/7, 365 day service delivery to large commercial, medical, and industrial facilities throughout all of Southeastern Michigan.\nI have been a homeowner here in Livonia since 2019. Outside of work, I serve as an assistant coach for the Livonia United Girls High School Hockey Team and regularly volunteer with different nonprofit organizations. I love our community and look forward to continuing to serve the residents of District 22 in any way that I can.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 22 seat?\nI am running for the Michigan State Legislature to secure a brighter future for our families and children, ensuring they have opportunities to thrive. I am committed to protecting our freedoms, fostering economic growth, and enhancing educational opportunities while preserving our rich heritage and community spirit. By balancing innovation with tradition, I aim to build a Michigan that honors its past and paves the way for a prosperous future.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- We need to make Michigan more affordable. The cost of groceries, housing and utilities are out of control – and politicians have made it worse. Michigan families are cutting their spending to live within their means — why can’t Lansing do the same? Our current state budget spending is out of control and unsustainable — and we all end up footing the bill for it. Michigan families deserve competent decision-makers to craft a responsible budget that doesn’t drain your bank account.\n- We need to fix our broken education system. Our public schools are currently 41st in the country. Quality education is the key that unlocks opportunity and success for the next generation. We must focus on empowering students through a partnership between parents, educators, and the community. Quality education begins with the freedom of choice, allowing parents to select the best educational path for their children. Instead of pushing political agendas, we should prioritize real educational outcomes, ensuring our kids can read and perform basic math proficiently.\n- We need to build strong communities that prioritize public safety. Security and stability are crucial to our Michigan way of life. You deserve to be safe in your home, your family deserves to be safe in your neighborhood and your kids deserve to be safe in school. I support law enforcement, and enforcing the law. I will work to make our community and your neighborhood safe.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI believe in upholding the Second Amendment rights of responsible gun owners while supporting common-sense measures to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and those with mental health issues. I advocate for background checks and improved mental health services to address the root causes of gun violence. My focus is on ensuring the safety of our communities without infringing on the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI believe in a culture of life which starts with having the kind of state where families can easily live, work, and raise a family. While I am pro-life, I can’t imagine what it is like to be faced with an unplanned pregnancy; it has to be overwhelming. We need to do everything in our power to make sure women faced with these circumstances are supported and that means supporting policies like better access to prenatal care and early childhood education.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nThe cost of groceries, housing and utilities are out of control and politicians have made it worse. Michigan families are cutting their spending to live within their means — why can’t Lansing do the same? As long as the government keeps expanding and spending your money on wasteful programs and projects, the cost of living will continue to increase. Michigan families deserve competent decision-makers to craft a responsible state budget that doesn’t drain your bank account.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nMy Democratic opponent campaigned on getting more dollars in the classroom, but cut a billion dollars from the K-12 budget, and failed to increase per-pupil funding for the first time in a decade. Irresponsible doesn’t even begin to describe the state budget my opponent voted in favor of.\nMy Democratic opponent campaigned on taking care of teachers, but raided $670 million from their retirement benefit system – Michigan already owes retired teachers more than $30 billion. That is not a recipe for success for our state, and our teachers deserve better than that.\nState Representative – 23rd District\nJump to candidate\nName: Jason Morgan\nAge: 35\nCurrent job: State representative\nEducation: Undergraduate, Political Science from Northern\nMichigan University. Master of Public Administration (MPA) from\nthe University of Michigan\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nThe son of a commercial fisherman and school lunch aide, I was raised in\nPinconning, Michigan. By working part-time and thanks to state and federal student aid, I worked my way through college as a first-generation college student. Following my education, I worked as a union educator at Washtenaw County Community College, where I strived to provide educational opportunities for all. I’ve also been honored to work alongside Congressman John Dingell, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, Congresswoman Haley Stevens, and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson as a senior aide and advisor — all of whom have taught me what it takes to serve District 23, and Michigan as a whole. Prior to my current role as your District 23 State Representative, I served as a Washtenaw County Commissioner, representing central Ann Arbor. I was elected in 2016 and reelected twice with nearly 90% of the vote. Throughout my life of public service it has always been my goal to build a Michigan that works for everyone, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, or socioeconomic status.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 23 seat?\nI am running for reelection as your state representative because I want to continue building a Michigan that works for everyone. My focus is on passing more pro-worker, pro-choice, and pro-people legislation. I am committed to improving our education system, protecting our environment, holding corporate polluters accountable, investing in infrastructure, and strengthening our democracy. Since taking office, we’ve passed transformational legislation to expand civil rights protections for our LGBTQ community, ensure reproductive freedom, restore labor rights, and create economic opportunities for all. Let’s keep the momentum going, together!\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- We must take action to maintain and grow Michigan’s population, ensure everyone has access to quality education, and protect our environment. Retaining and attracting residents is crucial for Michigan’s growth and prosperity. I introduced a comprehensive package of legislation to implement the recommendations of Governor\nWhitmer’s Growing Michigan Together Council, which focus on creating a more vibrant, inclusive, and prosperous Michigan. The package would invest in strategic economic development, build more housing, and create a statewide public transit system. - Michigan needs to invest in childhood through adult education. As a former teacher and current vice chair of the House K-12 and higher education budget committees, I hold a deep commitment to ensuring equitable, quality public education for all. I have helped pass legislation to improve working conditions for teachers and strengthen public education for our students. This includes restoring collective bargaining rights, increasing teacher compensation and investing in mental health, school safety, special education, and early intervention programs. We’re also helping families save by making college more affordable and providing free breakfast and lunch for all students.\n- Finally, with climate change affecting us all in new ways each year, the state must play an active role in mitigating its impacts. Last year, I helped pass the Clean Energy & Jobs Act, a historic package of clean energy legislation that will require Michigan’s energy to come from 60% renewable sources by 2035, expand access to rooftop solar, and authorize the Michigan Public Service Commission to regulate big energy utility companies on a broader array of issues impacting residents. Additionally, I introduced Michigan’s “Polluter Pay” package to hold corporate polluters accountable for environmental contamination and help those harmed by pollution to seek justice.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI am proud to have passed several common-sense gun reform bills into law. However, we cannot stop now. Nobody should ever have to live in fear of gun violence at school, work, or places of worship. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the state legislature to protect Michigan families from senseless gun violence.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nNo government should play a role in the medical decisions of women. I will fight to protect reproductive rights for all Michiganders, that’s why I enthusiastically voted yes to repeal Michigan’s archaic 1931 abortion ban last year.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nLong term, it is important that Michigan invests in the supply chain of critical industries, including chips manufacturing and green energy. Investing in these industries will create good-paying jobs and reduce our reliance on foreign nations, supporting a fair market for working families. Additionally, in Michigan, we have focused on reducing costs for hardworking families by eliminating the pension tax, lowering costs for childcare, and expanding the working families tax credit. These measures will provide immediate relief and support for those who need it most, ensuring a stronger and more resilient economy for all Michiganders.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nMy opponents have been vocally opposed to the existence of LGBTQ community members. As someone who is a part of the LGBTQ community, I know that an inclusive Michigan is one that thrives. I will always work to protect the rights of our LGBTQ neighbors where my opponents will not.\nEditor’s note: Democratic incumbent candidate Jason Morgan does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Miriam Corvino\nMiriam Corvino did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request and does not appear to have an official campaign website.\nName: David Stamp\nAge: 72\nCurrent job: Retired\nEducation: Mechanical engineering, Iowa State University\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI was born and raised on a farm in Iowa. After college I worked for four different companies, starting in engineering and ending up in sales/sales management. I lived and worked in Iowa, Ohio, North Carolina, California, Tennessee, and Michigan. I retired in 2015 and appreciate everyone who is still working and paying into the social security system.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 23 seat?\nI’ve got the time now that I’m retired and don’t have the pressure of working and being the breadwinner for a family of seven, and it seems to me that I should give something back for all the benefits I enjoyed while working.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nThe state seems to want to run/regulate everyone’s life, and most people don’t appreciate that. So a smaller state government and less regulation seems in order to me, along with a commensurate reduction in taxes.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nAs a state rep. I would have little impact on any U.S. reform. I think current laws are very effective with all the law abiding citizens. No law will impact people that are not law abiding. In fairness to the non law abiding citizens, they are not getting a very good example on being law abiding by a lot of our government officials and their children, which might be a good place to start on reform, or at least enforcement.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI won’t be getting one. If you are, that will be a mistake that you will have to live with.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nAs a state rep. I would have no impact on U.S. inflation. I am sure Trump will take care of it though, so maybe the best thing we could all do would be to vote for Trump.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI would not vote consistently with the democrats like Jason [Morgan] does.\nState Representative – 24th District\nJump to candidate\nName: Ranjeev Puri\nState Rep.

I have a Dual Master’s Degree in Business Management and Human Resource Management from the University of Phoenix and a Bachelor’s Degree in Criminal Justice from Saginaw Valley State University. I am a compassionate person who has served my community for over 20 years as a community leader, advocate. I am running to be the voice of the people and to make sure that we are creating laws that actually help people in everyday life. I want to bring money from Lansing to the community like former State Representative Kevin Coleman. He brought a lot of funding sources to the Wayne Westland Community School District and programs to the Jefferson Barns Community Center. I am currently serving on the Wayne Westland Board of Education, that includes the city of Wayne, Westland, Canton, Dearborn Heights, Romulus, and Inkster.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 25 seat?\nI have a strong track record of working in economic development, getting multi-million-dollar bonds passed in two different school districts, and creating job fairs in skilled trades and workforce development. Working as an insurance agent for over 20 years, I understand the health disparities that everyday Americans face. I have been involved in several chambers of commerce and have a close relationship with the business community. I am dedicated to making a positive impact on our community. In fact, I have a plan to work on solutions with affordable housing having a background working in grants and contract management from a housing commission, relationships with MSHDA, HUD, and utilizing my position on the Wayne County Women’s Commission sitting on the Housing Committee.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nEducation is a priority making sure that our children have the training in skill trades and affordable college to become successful citizens.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nWe should have laws that are common sense when it comes to background checks and making sure that criminals are not illegally buying guns. I believe in gun rights being a CPL holder and having the right to protect ourselves. We must make sure that we ensure gun safety by making sure that we have more community events to teach gun safety and provide gun locks. We also have to invest in mental illness programs to help prevent gun violence.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI believe that women should have the right to decide what to do with their bodies with their doctors when it pertains to personal medical issues. That was the whole purpose of HIPAA. People should not have to choose to die or go to jail over a medical situation. If a person is raped or molested they should not have to be forced to have a baby without having any alternative solutions. The men are not being penalized for getting the women pregnant. What if she has other children and she goes to jail over an abortion? How will that help the rest of the family especially if she is a single parent. The government is not providing extra resources for the women to help take care of the families.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nWe need to work on lowering inflation. Rent is high, food costs are high, and the cost of living is extremely high. We need to make sure that we have affordable housing, lower daycare [costs], and more training programs to help people make more money to help keep up with inflation.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI do not have any disagreements on how the current State Representative Peter Herzberg is doing. He is doing a good job bringing money back to Westland and he still needs more time in his new role.\nName: Salif Kourouma\nAge: 47\nCurrent job: Manufacture line production team.\nEducation: Associates degree in liberal arts\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI was born In west Africa Guinea, in the ethnicity Malinke, I moved to the United States back in July 1999, I lived in New Jersey for six months and then came to Detroit, where I worked for five to six companies trying to live my dream life.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 25 seat?\nI am running for the Michigan House Of Representatives District 25 seat, because I was always dreaming of being a chief; I started dreaming about politics when I was attending college. I wanted to share my political ideas and opinions, and when I would see political ads on TV I was inspired to start my own campaign. I want to be the best candidate and create a better democracy for everybody.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nIf I was elected I will be a very nice and honest person to all the people, no matter their race, color, gender, or religion.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nEverybody should have a gun to protect themselves against criminals and have the proper license.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nWhen it comes to abortion I am undecided.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nTo fight the current inflation crisis, the U.S. must work hard both nationally and internationally, and work hard on the national economies.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nAs a state representative, I will propose laws to make everybody’s dreams become a reality.\nName: Lekisha Maxwell\nLekisha Maxwell did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request. You can find more information at Maxwell’s campaign website.\nName: Layla Taha\nAge: 31\nCurrent job: Program director, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib\nEducation: B.A. in International Studies in Global Health from the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor; Master of Public Health (MPH) from Columbia University\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI’m the proud daughter of a Lebanese immigrant and was raised by a single mother in Wayne who struggled to make ends meet. We relied on the social safety nets of food stamps and Medicaid throughout my childhood, and this experience molded me into the fierce advocate for our community I am today. I went on to pursue a BA in Global Health from the University of Michigan, and a Master of Public Health from Columbia University. After several years working as a Medicare policy analyst evaluating nursing home quality, I began organizing for voting rights and reproductive freedom in Michigan. In 2022 I was one of the Catholic voices working with the Michigan Reproductive Freedom for All campaign to enshrine abortion as a right in Michigan’s Constitution. I also served as the program director for Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib’s Youth Civic Engagement Fellowship where I coordinated organizing training and instruction on social justice issues to empower the youth in our community. I’ve spent nearly a decade as a public health advocate and community organizer, and I believe in a more just and equitable world. We deserve a representative in Lansing who will fight for human dignity for all of us.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 25 seat?\nThis is my community. I have lived most of my life in Wayne and Westland, and the\nmajority of my family also lives right next door in Canton, where I spent so much time\nwith my grandmother and cousins growing up. This community has shaped me into someone who has great pride in being part of the working class and who cares deeply about the health and well-being of my neighbors. I am a graduate of the University of Michigan, where I studied global health. I also earned my Master of Public Health with a Certificate in Health Policy from Columbia University. I’ve spent nearly a decade as a public health advocate and community organizer, and I am invested in fighting for a more just and equitable world for all of us. My passion for people and commitment to public health started at home many years ago, where I witnessed several environmentally hazardous explosions, attempts to dump toxic waste, and pollution that has made our rivers and wetlands uninhabitable for native species. My hometown of Wayne serves as a prime example of environmental injustice, and it is no surprise to me that we rank in the highest percentiles for asthma, heart disease, and low life expectancy across the state of Michigan. We need more progressive voices in Lansing who aren’t afraid to stand up to corporate polluters and are willing to fight for the public health of our community, which includes ensuring the basic human right to quality and affordable health care. In 2024 it is critical for Michigan to maintain its trifecta of Democratic leadership in Lansing and elect representatives who are committed to fighting for the working class. I’m focused on securing quality, affordable health care for all Michiganders, fighting for a livable wage for working families, and delivering environmental justice to ensure residents have access to clean water and air. My commitment to protecting public health is driven by my belief in prioritizing people over profits. That is why I am running.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Health care. Health care is a fundamental human right that should be accessible for all Michiganders. Yet in Westland 7.4% of residents under the age of 65 are uninsured while 8.6% are uninsured in Wayne. The rates of uninsured folks in HD25 are considerably higher than the rest of the state (6%). If elected I would work to legislate a single payer health care system in Michigan to guarantee this basic human right. I want to change minds in Lansing and show them that the concept of universal health care is not only popular but necessary.\n- Economy/jobs. Wages have remained stagnant for decades while the cost of living has increased significantly. Working families in HD 25 and across Michigan are struggling to pay the bills and put food on the table. This is especially true in the city of Wayne where the community is still recovering from the financial crisis in 2008 that devastated families and local government. If elected I would work to increase the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour and create a standard that increases the minimum wage with inflation on an annual basis. I would also fight\nto hold corporations accountable for paying their workers a fair wage and prevent them from implementing the union-busting tactics we see happening across the country. Michigan workers deserve dignity and should not be exploited by corporations for their labor. They have a right to earn an honest wage that affords them quality housing, utilities, food, and health care. - DTE accountability. I believe in a Michigan that provides reliable, clean, affordable energy to all of its citizens. Yet the current state of our power grid has led to severe power outages and damages that have left people in the dark for days. These outages are due to increasingly intense weather coupled with a lack of reliable infrastructure because DTE refuses to properly invest in making overdue updates to the grid despite raking in record profits. Michigan residents are paying some of the highest electric bills in the nation while suffering some of the worst service. DTE has continued to defer maintenance on our power grid while increasing their rates. Instead of replacing transformers, trimming more trees, and burying power lines, DTE pays out their Wall Street shareholders with the money we pay to them for our utility bills. During times of severe outages the majority of legislators in Lansing remain silent about DTE’s role in the devastation because most of them are accepting campaign contributions from DTE. In fact, 93% of state legislators in Michigan accepted campaign contributions from DTE in 2021. Therefore, it is not surprising that no legislation has been passed to hold DTE accountable and push them to invest in our power grid. If elected, I will fight to pass legislation that will force DTE to pay customers for every hour they are without power, as well as laws that prohibit DTE and other\nutilities from donating money to politicians and PACs. Corporate influence in our politics gets in the way of good governance. That is why I have pledged to never accept a dime of corporate money and am running a campaign fueled by small donations from working people. Passing Pay to Play Laws in Michigan would be a step in the right direction regarding taking back our power and ensuring residents have the affordable, reliable electricity they deserve. I also fully support efforts to establish more publicly owned power utilities to expand on the current publicly\nowned power grids in the state of Michigan in cities like Lansing, Wyandotte, and Holland.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nGun violence is a public health epidemic in our country, and both gun ownership and gun violence are on the rise in Michigan. In the wake of the horrific tragedies at Oxford High School and Michigan State University, as well as the everyday gun violence that occurs in our communities, it is clear that we must be brave and bold enough to take the necessary action to keep our communities safe. I am heartened that the Democrats in the state legislature took swift action to pass a suite of bills that will go a long way to ensure community safety by requiring the safe storage of firearms in houses with children, preventing people who are a danger to themselves and others from obtaining firearms, and expanding background checks to include all sales.\nWe must build on this important work to address other critical pieces of community safety, including: allowing extreme risk protection orders that allow law enforcement to remove firearms from those in crisis, funding community violence intervention programs that are crucial to preventing the violence at the start, increasing protection for victims of domestic violence by making it easier to remove firearms from those who have committed violence against a partner, requiring state licensing for arms dealers, and banning the sale and distribution of assault weapons.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nAbortion access is health care, and it is important to continuously support efforts to codify unrestricted access to abortion care to all those who need it. I believe that everyone regardless of age/race/socioeconomic status/religion has the right to make their own choices about their reproductive health care. In fact, I was one of the few Catholic voices advocating and organizing for the Reproductive Freedom for All Campaign to pass Proposal 3 in 2022. My faith calls on me to follow my conscience in all of my moral decision-making and also to respect my neighbor’s right to do the same. Health care decisions should be made based on what an individual needs to keep them safe, healthy, and alive. I also believe we must eliminate 24-hour waiting periods for abortion services. Such policies are medically unnecessary and only aim to limit abortion access. Furthermore, the 24-hour waiting period disproportionately impacts working class folks who cannot afford to take multiple days off of work in order to receive the care they need. This makes accessing abortion more difficult, dangerous, and expensive.\nMoreover, disparities in people’s health outcomes are directly influenced by their inability to access safe, affordable, medically/scientifically accurate, and evidence-based sexual reproductive health care. These unfair, unnecessary and avoidable disparities are rooted in historical and contemporary injustices and discrimination — including racism. To address these disparities, we must work on reinvestment of attention, resources, and deliberate corrective policies and legislation in Lansing. I support state Medicaid funding of abortions for low-income women. Abortion is health care, and healthcare is a human right. A person’s ability to access such care should not be limited due to their socioeconomic status. Providing state Medicaid funding for abortion will eliminate one of the greatest barriers to care that low-income women\nface. This work will ensure that every Michigander is able to maintain their personal bodily autonomy and make informed and empowered decisions when it comes to their sexual and reproductive health care. I will continue to support legislation and policies that will protect safe and legal abortions for all.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nWhile the causes of inflation can be myriad and complex, and thus difficult to tackle with any one solution, the bottom line is higher prices and skyrocketing interest rates are creating immense pain for working people across the country. The main reason the price of gas, groceries, utilities, and other basic necessities is many times higher than in recent years is because of price gouging and corporate greed — also known as “Greedflation”. There have been multiple studies of the causes of the increase in the price of consumer goods and services, and extensive reporting on CEOs openly admitting that price increases were implemented not because of the increased cost of doing business, but because the “consumer will tolerate the higher price.” This is just another example of the wealthy and corporations taking advantage of working families.\nAs state representative, my ability to tackle inflation and its impacts are limited to the ways I can fight to put money back in the pockets of hardworking Michiganders and through efforts to ensure the Attorney General has the authority to regulate companies that operate in Michigan and hold them accountable.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nMy main opponent, Peter Herzberg, has taken numerous actions to prove he is the wrong choice for HD 25 and cannot be trusted to protect women’s health and fight for our fundamental rights. Just over one month ago Herzberg was the sole Democrat to vote against a bill that was part of the public health expert-backed maternal health package to expand access to lifesaving donor breast milk that is critical to the health of thousands of infants. HB 4728 will increase our state’s supply of donor breast milk, which provides vital nutrition to newborns and infants whose mothers are unable to produce enough milk to feed them. This bill applies the latest scientifically-backed guidance for how often donor milk needs to be screened to be safe for consumption, while balancing the need for increased supply. Breastfeeding is difficult for many new mothers, and an inability to get their child to properly latch or to produce enough milk can cause stress, anxiety, and other adverse mental health effects at a time when mothers are already vulnerable. Donor milk is also crucial for premature and sick infants, offering essential nutrients, antibodies, and bioactive factors that support growth and immune function. Not only was Herzberg the only Democrat to oppose this vital legislation backed by public health experts and maternal and child health advocates, he was outvoted 103-6, and was joined only by five extremist male Republicans.\nIn contrast to my opponent, I believe in science and will listen to those with the wisdom and data when discerning whether to support legislation. During my two years studying for my Master in Public Health (MPH) at Columbia University, my home department was Population and Family Health. This meant an extensive study of maternal and child health, as well as sexual and reproductive health, from the policy level all the way to on-the-ground programming that delivers reproductive health care in humanitarian crises and complex emergencies. As a public health professional I understand how improving the accessibility of breast milk is critical to also improving health outcomes for women and their children. I will never stop fighting to protect our reproductive freedoms and I will continue to support legislation and policies that will protect maternal and child health at every step.\nName: Josh Powell\nJosh Powell did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request.

Currently serving on Inkster City Council for District 6 (elected four times in intervals since 1999)\nEducation: Former Inkster School District and Michigan State University\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nWife to James Richardson for 52 years, mother of two adult children (one daughter, one son) and raised a biological niece, six grandchildren and two great grandchildren. I’m a lifelong resident of Inkster. I’ve served my community for 25 years. I am a former commissioner/Inkster Zoning Board of appeals; chaired Inkster Development Review team; former member Wayne County Community Development block grant advisory board, former member of Western Wayne County family health center and Inkster teen health center; Former UAW chief steward and health and safety representative; and served on the Inkster school board. I am president of the League of Christian Women; member of the NAACP, Inkster Good Fellows, Region 1A retiree and member of The Citadel of praise church in Detroit.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 26 seat?\nI am running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 26 seat because I feel the residents needs a grassroots person who has experienced hardships and seeks to improve the quality of life for everyone. I know about financial struggles, and hardships. I am a cancer survivor and my husband has survived cancer eight times. I know about having insurance and it taps out because my husband reached the maximum for cancer medication. I have seniors calling for assistance for home repairs and all the grant money is gone. People are suffering and having great difficulties making ends meet. Schools are closing, schools have deficit budgets. It’s time for public servants to get involved, we really don’t need politicians now. I have been a dedicated public servant. Citizens trust me and look to me to be the change they need to improve their quality of life. Therefore I believe I am the best candidate to advance the overall needs of Inkster, Romulus, Garden City and Westland.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nMy top three priorities are: Insurance companies/redlining; mental health services/ care; and water, air and noise pollution.\nI would like to investigate the practices of insurance companies. How are rates determined? Why are some areas more expensive? Are they looking at credit scores or the zip code? It’s to the point that people cannot afford a car, home, or medication or medical. And if someone has say car or house insurance and they use it. The cost rises or they may cancel coverage. This has to be addressed.\nMental health: We should have more awareness about signs of mental health and have more agencies when a person can get outpatient and inpatient services. Many were closed years ago, it’s time to have more clinics and hospitals.\nPollution issues: We replace water filters every few months for our sink and refrigerator. Although some areas give free filers for the sink, the refrigerator filters are expensive. Clean water is essential for our health. That has to be addressed and the state and federal regulations should be enforced. Air and noise pollution is really bad if you live near metro airport. Glad the economy is improving and people are traveling. However, the airplane fly every 10 minutes over your home, every day, every night. Residents cannot enjoy outdoor activities, television, or telephone conversations. Your sleep is interrupted. I know a few years ago residents in surrounding cities received new roofs, new windows, doors, furnace and air conditioning systems to help sound proof the homes. Some cities were overlooked. I would like to have this addressed. Any homes that are in the landing area of the airport should have received assistance. Again, things shouldn’t be based on zip code — citizens are citizens regardless of the location in which they live.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI am in favor of gun reform. Too many are being shot, too many are being killed. No one feels safe in their homes, or on highways. Children are not safe in their beds or at schools. We MUST reform and enforce our laws. I do believe in the right to bear arms as guaranteed in the Constitution. I also believe that all sales should include a minimum federal law enforced background and mental health clearance. I am also an advocate of safe storage of weapons and assault weapons should be banned from public sales. They should be used by military only.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nAbortion rights?? I believe in a woman’s right to choose — PERIOD!\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nMy solution in fighting inflation: I know the experts say one should invest in gold, real estate and increase taxes. In my opinion that hurts the working poor and people on fixed incomes. People do work more than one job, must buy less, buy cheaper and spend money wisely. Turn heat, air conditioner down, pay off debts with high interest rates, just cut spending. Growing a garden and freeze or can vegetables helps with food costs. We might have to bake our own bread and go back to churning your own butter. Unfortunately, the ingredients are costly also. Just pray for Miracles! This is truly a difficult question. The economists and lawmakers should work closely together for policy solutions to manage and balance the money supply. Also higher wages would help.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI disagreed with my challenger for voting twice not to approve the Governor’s budget that included funding to eliminate the debt for the Inkster school district. That debt was on our taxes. Whatever he disagreed with, ask for that item to be removed and discussed later. As my grandfather would say, “don’t throw out the baby with the bath water.”\nI am in favor of transit. I don’t agree with voting against items because you don’t want the rich to make money. Ever think that the wealthy can assist communities in bringing new business opportunities that increases needed revenue and growth. My challenger’s personal stance against some business incentives provides missed opportunities to advance communities. I would communicate my concerns, yet consider what impact it would have on the citizens. We must remember, we work for the citizens, putting their immediate needs and concerns first. This overrides our personal “conscience.”\nName: Dylan Wegela\nAge: 31\nCurrent job: State Representative District 26 (Former Public School Teacher)\nEducation: BA, Eastern Michigan University\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI grew up in a working-class family. Both of my grandparents worked in the automotive\nindustry and were UAW members. I have been serving and fighting for working-class\ncommunities my entire adult life. I taught in public schools for nearly eight years. I’ve\ntaught in Arizona, Michigan, and South Korea. When I lived in South Korea, I would\ntravel four hours by bus each way to tutor North Korean Refugees in English. In Arizona, I served two years as my teacher’s union president, while teaching full-time, and won record contracts as our lead negotiator. In 2018 I helped organize one of the largest teacher strikes in U.S. history, bringing $400 million into public schools. Since being elected I have introduced legislation to take DTE and other powerful corporations in Michigan.\nMy wife Anna is a mental health professional and we are committed to connecting\nfamilies throughout Michigan with important resources to succeed. My office has\nhelped hundreds of constituents in need. I’m running for reelection in the State House\nto continue my work serving our communities and fighting for the people of District 26.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 26 seat?\nI am running to continue fighting for economic, environmental, and social justice\nfor our communities. In my first term, I have seen how the influence of corporate money has corrupted our political system. I am one of the only state government\nrepresentatives to not take corporate PAC money. In just my first term I have voted against over $4 billion in corporate handouts. Instead of giving corporations tax breaks, we should be investing in public schools, infrastructure, and mental health\nservices.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Worker power. Wealth is not created without workers. We deserve to live in a society that prioritizes true democracy, one that ensures that we all have a say in how wealth generated can benefit everyone, not just the bosses.\n- Corporate accountability. Unfortunately, the last several decades have been\nthe story of a fierce effort by the wealthiest people in the country dismantling\nsystems that promote equality, and using their money to influence elections.\nWe cannot call ourselves a democracy when millions of dollars in dark\nmoney is spent to muddy the truth and shape false narratives against\nworking-class candidates. Every level of government and politics needs\ncomprehensive mechanisms for transparency, and we must reform campaign\nfinance. - Fighting for our future. After graduation, I taught in well-funded classrooms in\nSouth Korea, and under-funded schools in Arizona. When I returned to Michigan, it became clear we needed to double down our efforts to invest in education and other social programs that promote equality, justice, and upward mobility. We need to make sure future generations have a shot at a meaningful life, and that we work to invest in our students and their teachers.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI was proud to vote for universal background checks, red flag laws, and safe storage laws in my first term. We need to continue enacting common-sense gun control laws. I am also in support of an assault weapons ban.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI believe that health care is a human right and that reproductive freedom is as well. I\nam pro-choice, and we need to stop the far-right and their legal activism from preventing access to basic health care like abortion, IVF, and birth control.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nThe main driver of inflation is corporate greed. Corporations are artificially raising\nprices to increase profits. We must increase taxes on the wealthy, raise the minimum wage, and invest in public services. We also need to hold corporations accountable for their influence on public policy. If we invest in the people and don’t allow the wealthiest in society to push for rules that benefit their bottom line instead of working people’s well-being, we will build a more resilient economy.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nDid not answer.\nName: Jeff Gorman\nAge: Old enough to remember when the U.S. was great\nCurrent job: Retired\nEducation: BS Aerospace Engineering U.S. Naval Academy/MS Industrial Engineering University of Cincinnati\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\n- U.S. Naval officer/pilot with 24 years of service\n- U.S. airline pilot for 20 years flying domestically and international\n- Substitute teacher K-12, nine years\n- Park Ranger, one year\n- Funeral home assistant, five years\n- Precinct delegate, 10 years\n- MI Freedom Center volunteer, seven years\n- Knights of Columbus, 14 years\n- Navy Patrol Squadron 93 Association (VP-93) volunteer, 13 years\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 26 seat?\nTo stop the loss of freedom and liberty happening in Lansing.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n“Californication of MI” — The move by some to turn Michigan into a one-party rule state with burdensome rules, regulations, and legislation to try and run our lives 24/7 from cradle to grave. Review all proposed legislation and ensure that only legislation within the scope of government is approved.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Infrastructure. Enough of fixing the damn roads. How about building roads to last?\n- Decreasing state population. The exodus from the state is caused by several factors. One is a lack of opportunity. The second is a government created atmosphere that is hostile to new business, especially to small business. The third is a government that has also become burdensome to citizens as well. The solution is to get government contained to only doing the duties that it is constitutionally required to do. Over reach has to stop. The Great Lake State is a wonderful place with a lot of resources that other states lack. We have to increase its attraction for people to come here and thrive.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nEnforce the laws that are already in place. Heed warning signs for potential problems.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nNon issue. Michigan voters decided that murdering the unborn was a fundamental human right. Guess they are also saying that human rights don’t begin until birth.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nInflation was caused by the implementation of the Green New Deal without legislation. Go back to a real-world energy policy that prudently uses our existing resources while we further develop alternative/renewable sources into a form that is efficient, effective, and without substantial increased cost or consequences.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nIncumbent appears to be a rubber stamp for the extreme agenda being pushed in Lansing. As I tell the people of District 26 when I am campaigning, I am beholden only to them. Not a party, not an agenda.\nEditor’s note: Republican candidate Jeff Gorman does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nState Representative – 27th District\nJump to candidate\nName: Jaime Churches\nAge: 35\nCurrent job: State Representative\nEducation: Madonna University – Bachelors in Integrated Science and Elementary\nEducation, Madonna University – Masters of Educational Leadership\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nBefore becoming a state representative in 2023, I taught 5th grade for over 10 years in the Downriver community and served as vice president of our MEA union. I am passionate about serving my community and state. I have seen how the lack of investment in public education, small businesses, and working families has led to hardships and inequity for Downriver families. Because of this, I was inspired to run for office in 2022 to help better represent hardworking Michiganders and stand up for change in Lansing. Since my time in office, I have secured over $75 million in investments for the Downriver area and helped pass significant legislation including repealing the retirement tax, expanding the working families tax credit, and supporting workers’ rights. I know my work in the state House is far from done, which is why I am seeking reelection this November 2024.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 27 seat?\nI am running for reelection to the Michigan House of Representatives District 27 seat\nbecause I want to continue the work I started this term and put our Downriver community back on the map. Our residents deserve good paying jobs with benefits, better infrastructure and transportation, and an improved public education system. I am passionate about these issues and finding solutions and funding to address them\nadequately. For instance, one of my bills, ensuring free breakfast and lunches for all\nstudents with every budget going forward, has not yet been passed into law. This\nlegislation is important for many students and families across the state, and I am eager\nto continue working on bills like this, and others, to move Michigan forward.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Economic development. We need to support better economic development in our\nstate by empowering small, local businesses and redeveloping blighted spaces\nand sites in our communities. In addition to this, we need to help business\nowners reinvent their models/practices to become more sustainable and have\nlong-term growth and benefits for the communities they are in. In addition to this, we need to keep our students graduating from high schools, colleges, and\nuniversities in Michigan to stay in Michigan and use their skills/education here\ninstead of other states – as a state, our own workforce development can\npositively impact the growth and longevity of our businesses and the economy. - Education. As a public school teacher, I know how the underfunding of public\neducation has made me feel devalued as an educator. When budgets are tight,\npublic schools are often not prioritized. Our students, educators, and schools are\nworth investing in. The profession of education is at a turning point. For far too\nlong the legislature has slowly defunded education. If we do not make necessary\nchanges we will not be able to retain highly effective educators to teach our\nstudents. - Infrastructure. Our roads, train crossings, bridges and water systems impact\nDownriver residents everyday. We need to invest in the deteriorating\ninfrastructure. Downriver faces various challenges when it comes to infrastructure in disrepair. I am committed to finding creative solutions to fund projects to repair our bridges, roads, water systems, and ensure rail safety. Furthermore, it is time to start planning ahead to create a shared vision for how to build our infrastructure to last and withstand environmental changes that we may face in the future.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nAs the lead sponsor of the universal background checks legislation passed in 2023, I strongly believe we need to create common sense gun laws to protect our communities and prevent senseless violence from occurring. No person should feel unsafe in their school, grocery store, or religious institutions – we can and must do better to keep our communities safe.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI believe that every individual has a right to make their own health care decisions. I will advocate for and protect a woman’s right to choose.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nWe should focus our attention on how to grow opportunities for the middle class and small businesses instead of corporate interests. Hardworking families often struggle because their jobs do not afford them adequate wages – we need to create sustainable jobs with better pay and benefits. Also, we should focus on lowering taxes for working families and protecting retiree pensions and benefits.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nCurrently, I am running unopposed as a Democrat in the Primary Election on Tuesday, August 6.\nEditor’s note: Democratic incumbent candidate Jaime Churches does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Cody Dill\nCody Dill did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request.

I was raised by a working mother and a dad who had a life-changing injury when he was 24, which made life challenging for our family. I learned from our experience that people can adapt to life with their disabilities when they work hard and have support from friends and family.\nThis experience led me to a career as a special education teacher in Taylor Public Schools. I have worked hard to improve our educational system by fighting to secure services that support teachers, students and families. I want to continue to invest in education, defend the right for women to make their own health care decisions, protect our environment, and help everyday Michiganders.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 28 seat?\nI want to be a good public servant during this incredibly partisan time. We need people in office who care about serving their communities, protecting workers and their rights, and moving Michigan’s economy in the right direction for all citizens. If elected, I seek to keep those values and fight for my constituents.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Investing in education. As a special education teacher, I would bring a unique perspective to the legislature. I would work with my colleagues for impactful legislation to: Provide stable funding for public schools to deliver the best education to Michigan students; commit to ongoing support for teacher and staff shortages — especially in Special Education; expand behavioral and mental health access; increase pre-K opportunities for families; continue to improve access to vocational and higher education.\n- Women’s rights. Uphold access to contraceptives, infertility treatments, and abortion. I trust women to make their personal healthcare decisions\n- Workers’ rights. Workers deserve a seat at the table and the right to collective bargaining. I will defend workers’ rights in the legislature.\n- Environmental justice. Polluter pay — make corporations accountable for cleaning up their messes.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI am a teacher who worked with staff to figure out how to slide students in wheelchairs out of the window in the event of an active shooter. I believe in the rights of individuals to own guns for hunting and recreation. However, weapons of war pose a growing risk to public safety. Our children deserve to feel safe in school.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nSee above\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nPut money back in Michigander’s pockets by lowering taxes on the middle class and ensuring big corporations and the wealthiest pay their fair share.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nBased on her voting record, my opponent is not supportive of working families and does not trust women to make their own health care choices.\nIn addition to this, my opponent:\n- Did not vote on the education budget to support our students, schools, and educators.\n- Voted against funding for her own district that would have addressed critical infrastructure concerns for residents.*\n*Editor’s note: WDET has not been able to independently verify this claim.\n- Voted no on legislation that repealed the senior retirement tax and expanded the working families tax credit – items that she previously promised to support before taking office.\nAs state representative, I would support our state’s education system, advocate for necessary funding for our communities, and keep my promises to voters. I will bring competence and integrity to the office.\nEditor’s note: Democratic candidate Janise O’Neil Robinson does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Beth Ann Socia\nAge: 62\nCurrent job: Retired. But before retiring I worked in law enforcement and I’m a certified nurse’s assistant\nEducation: High School and some college\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nDid not answer.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 28 seat?\nAfter much prayer and watching the lack of representation our legislators put forth for “We The People.” I’m tired of politicians making promises they have no intention of keeping and being sold out bribes, kickbacks, free mailers, free vacations, etc. We need a representative that cares more for their communities than what they can gain from the establishment!\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you take, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Taxes. Taxes are a big one right now since everyone I know that owns a home or business is dealing with increase property taxes! I worked with AxMiTax helping to collect signatures to eliminate property taxes. I would also take a look at the state budget to see where we can reduce taxes in other areas. When I say I will fight for my constituents, I mean it. I’m not afraid to get my shoes dirty.\n- Parental rights. No school should be doing anything to a student/child without the parents knowledge or consent. Parents should have more say in what is going on in the schools, curriculum, books in the libraries, to name a few. Parents should also have school choice and the money follows the students. More choices for the parents. Working closely with the schools and Board of Education on how we can better meet the demands and concerns of the parents.\n- Border/safety. Citizens are concerned about the open border and the amount of young, adult, military-age men coming across our borders and the increase in drugs that are also coming across the border. Crime rate is up and women and children are being raped and murdered by illegals.* This is unacceptable. No driver’s license, social security, welfare, or medical for illegals. Increasing penalties for trafficking, whether it’s women and children or illegal narcotics. We not only need to enforce our laws but stricter punishment. Criminals must be held accountable for their actions. Working closely with law enforcement on what I as a state representative can do to help them make our communities safer.\n*Editor’s note: There is no data to support the claim that the United States is experiencing a surge in crime caused by illegal immigrants. While FBI statistics do not separate out crimes by the immigration status of the assailant, there is no evidence of a spike in crime perpetrated by migrants, either along the U.S.-Mexico border or in cities seeing the greatest influx of migrants, like New York, The Associate Press reports.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI stand by the Second Amendment.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI have no comment on this since it is not an issue at this time.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nWhen taxes go up, prices go up. One way would be to lower taxes. I would take a good look at the State’s budget and start eliminating wasteful spending. It’s way past time to audit, eliminate, and reduce spending where we can. The Federal Reserve and Central Banks also have their part to play in inflation.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI have received about 10 mailers (sponsored by the establishment) from my challenger telling me what she is going to do if she is reelected. Not one of those mailers has my challenger mentioned what she has done for the citizens in her District. To my knowledge she has not sponsored or co-sponsored any bills!* I would be more aggressive in working with the other Legislators to sponsor or co-sponsor on bills that would benefit our constituents, the people we are supposed to be representing!\n*Editor’s note: Republican incumbent State Rep. Jamie Thompson has sponsored and co-sponsored several bills and resolutions during her time in office.\nName: Jamie Thompson\nState Rep. Jamie Thompson did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request. You can find more information at Thompson’s campaign website.\nName: Kyle Wright\nAge: 25\nCurrent job: Nonprofit development specialist\nEducation: Bachelors of Science, Central Michigan University\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nKyle is a 25-year-old candidate running for Michigan state representative because he believes in a future that is built on the ideals of inclusion and common respect, not extreme politics. Kyle is a candidate who believes strongly in providing the best education for our youth, protecting women’s reproductive freedom, building the next generation of infrastructure, and protecting our environment from those who threaten our planet. Appointed to his School Board at 21 and then elected at the age of 22, Kyle is a leader in his hometown of Taylor. He fought hard to hold leaders accountable, helped sustain and create good-paying union jobs, and worked hand in hand to create a sustainable plan for his district’s future. Kyle has also built his professional career in the nonprofit community for the past six years, where he has worked to help his community by giving back through service to our environment, children with different abilities, at-risk youth, and helping find cures for children with neurofibromatosis (NF). Kyle is a fierce advocate for LGBTQIA rights and protections. As a member himself, he will advocate to ensure that his family, friends, and constituents have the opportunity to live in an inclusive community. Kyle is running to build a better tomorrow for everyone and believes it’s time for his generation to have a say in their future.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 29 seat?\nI am running for state representative of District 29 to bring a fresh perspective and dedicated leadership to our community. As a 25-year-old candidate and a graduate of Central Michigan University with degrees in political science and public and nonprofit administration, I have spent my career advocating for positive change and serving my community. For the past six years, I have worked as a nonprofit development professional, focusing on improving the lives of our residents. My commitment to public service is further demonstrated by my current role on the Taylor School Board, where I have served for four years, including roles as president, secretary and trustee.\nMy deep connection to the community and hands-on experience in addressing local issues set me apart from my opponents. I am not just another politician; I am a dedicated advocate who understands the unique challenges and opportunities of our district. My background in nonprofit development has equipped me with the skills to build coalitions, manage resources effectively, and create impactful programs. On the Taylor School Board, I have demonstrated my ability to lead, collaborate, and deliver tangible results. I bring a unique combination of youthful energy, innovative thinking, and a proven track record of community service that no one else can offer.\nI am running for this seat because I believe District 29 deserves a representative who will listen to the needs of all residents and work tirelessly to address them. My top priorities include advocating for bold investments in education, supporting career and technical education and college readiness programs, and ensuring our schools are equipped to provide a quality education for every student. I am a strong pro-choice candidate committed to protecting a woman’s right to choose and ensuring equitable health care access for all, with a focus on mental health investments for youth and seniors. I aim to advance our state’s competitiveness in infrastructure by promoting electrification, improving roads and bridges, and enhancing public transportation. Environmental sustainability is also a priority, and I am dedicated to transitioning to renewable energy sources and enforcing industry regulations to combat climate change.\nI am choosing this moment to run because our community needs a representative who is ready to address critical issues with urgency and dedication. The challenges we face require fresh ideas, new energy, and a willingness to think outside the box. I am committed to being that representative, bringing a bold and dynamic approach to the state House. Your support will help me be a loud and bold voice for the needs of our residents in the 29th District, which includes Taylor, Romulus, Huron Township, Ash Township, Carleton, Frenchtown, and Monroe. Together, we can create a brighter future for our community.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nThe top three priority issues facing Michigan are upskilling workers, addressing the housing shortage, and improving public school infrastructure.\n- Upskilling workers. To tackle the skills gap and prepare our workforce for the evolving job market, I would advocate for expanded vocational training programs, partnerships with local businesses for apprenticeships, and increased funding for community colleges and technical schools. This will help workers gain the skills needed for high-demand jobs and strengthen Michigan’s economy.\n- Housing shortage. To address the housing crisis, I would support policies that incentivize the construction of affordable housing, streamline zoning regulations to facilitate development, and increase funding for housing assistance programs. These measures aim to make housing more accessible and affordable for Michigan residents.\n- Public school infrastructure. Improving our public school infrastructure is essential for providing a high-quality education. I would work to secure additional funding for school repairs and upgrades, promote programs that enhance classroom technology, and support initiatives to ensure that all schools have the resources they need to create a safe and effective learning environment.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI believe that individuals have the right to bear arms responsibly, and it’s crucial to balance this right with sensible gun laws to ensure the safety of our communities. Gun violence is a public safety crisis in the United States, and we must take comprehensive action to address it. This includes implementing universal background checks, closing loopholes that allow guns to fall into the wrong hands, and supporting measures to prevent gun violence, such as mental health resources and community-based intervention programs. By enacting common-sense reforms, we can protect our citizens while respecting the rights of responsible gun owners.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI firmly believe in protecting the right to choose and ensuring comprehensive reproductive health care is accessible to all. This includes safeguarding access to contraception, family planning services, and safe, legal abortion. I will fight against any legislation that seeks to undermine these fundamental rights.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nAs a state representative, I understand that neither I nor the state of Michigan has the ability to single-handedly fix the global inflation crisis. However, I am committed to fighting to lessen the burden that constituents of House District 29 are feeling. This means finding unique and creative ways to put money back into the pockets of our hard-working individuals and families.\nWe can continue to expand on the work that Democrats have already done, such as repealing the retirement tax, increasing the child tax credit, and making school lunches free. These initiatives are crucial in putting money back into the pockets of residents as they face the global inflation issue.\nAdditionally, I will collaborate with my colleagues in the state legislature to assist the federal government in addressing this global crisis. By working together at both the state and federal levels, we can implement strategies to reduce inflation and help alleviate its impact on the people of Michigan.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI strongly disagree with my challenger, who has consistently voted against women’s reproductive freedom, green environmental policies, public education, union workers’ rights, mental health resources, animal welfare, and election access. Unlike him, I would champion policies that protect reproductive rights, invest in clean energy and public education, support workers and mental health services, and ensure fair and accessible elections. My focus is on addressing these critical issues to better serve the constituents of House District 29.\nEditor’s note: Democratic candidate Kyle Wright does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: James DeSana\nState Rep. James DeSana did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request.

Born and raised in southeast Michigan by her grandparents, both UAW members, she has deep roots in the community.\nMorgan’s extensive career includes serving as constituent services director for State Representative Felicia Brabec, where she addressed voter concerns, fought for progressive policies, and gained valuable legislative experience. Her background ensures she can effectively serve as our next state representative.\nActive in the community, Morgan has served on the Washtenaw County Brownfield Development Board and has been a member of the Washtenaw County Democratic Party County Committee since 2020. She also served as treasurer of the Washtenaw County Democratic Party Black Caucus and as an elected precinct delegate.\nMorgan’s commitment to public service is further demonstrated by her educational achievements. She graduated from the Michigan Educational Policy Fellowship Program in 2022 and the Michigan Political Leadership Program in 2025. In 2019, she was named a NEW Leader of Color Fellow.\nMorgan’s passion for public service and her proven track record make her an exceptional candidate to continue advocating for Washtenaw County in the State Legislature.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 33 seat?\nI’m running for state legislature to continue my commitment to service and advocacy. Growing up in southeast Michigan, inspired by my community, I learned the values of hard work and giving back. As an educator in Ypsilanti Schools and MEA member, I saw the transformative power of education. At the Student Advocacy Center, I empowered residents through nonpartisan Get Out the Vote efforts.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nServing on the Washtenaw County Democratic Party Committee and former treasurer of its Black Caucus, working as a legislative staffer, I championed critical issues. I aim to fight for health care, education, senior care and representing my community’s voices.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nAs a staunch advocate for common sense gun reform, I believe that safeguarding our communities is paramount. The tragic loss of my father to gun violence deeply impacted my life and propelled me into a life of service, dedicated to preventing others from experiencing similar pain. Sensible measures such as comprehensive background checks, closing loopholes, and restricting access to firearms for those with a history of violence are crucial steps toward reducing gun violence. By balancing the Second Amendment with responsible regulations, we can protect both our citizens’ rights and their lives. My commitment to this cause is unwavering, and I will work tirelessly to ensure that our laws reflect the necessity for both safety and common sense in gun ownership.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI am pro-choice, period. As Governor Whitmer recently stated, the decision about whether to have a child and when to have a child is the most important health, emotional, and financial decision a woman will ever make. This is personal to me not only as a woman but also as a woman of color. We know that women of color bear the brunt of anti-choice laws because they have fewer resources for health care.\nMoreover, I have endometriosis and fibroids, both of which were surgically diagnosed at 14. These conditions present unique medical hurdles to becoming pregnant, and if I were to become pregnant, I would face a high-risk pregnancy with potential serious health consequences.\nSo, when we talk about how abortion is health care, it’s deeply personal for me. That’s why I’m proud to have worked with Rep. Felicia Brabec when the current Democratic legislature approved the Reproductive Health Act.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nIf elected, I am committed to tackling inflation and its impact on our community. By advocating for policies that support local businesses, I aim to boost economic resilience and job creation. I will work to ensure fair wages and support workforce development programs that equip residents with the skills needed for higher-paying jobs. Additionally, I will push for measures to reduce the cost of essential services, such as health care and housing, making them more accessible and affordable. By collaborating with both state and local leaders, I will strive to implement strategies that promote economic stability and protect the financial well-being of our citizens.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI am not a perfect person, but I own my obligations and mistakes. In contrast, my opponent, during her tenure as a trustee and president of the Ann Arbor school board, presided over significant budget issues without taking responsibility as a fiduciary.\nName: Rima Mohammad\nRima Mohammad did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request.

Also, on the border of Washtenaw and Jackson counties. I went to Manchester Schools and Adrian College. I have worked in the medical field for over 30 years.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 47 seat?\nI am running for the House because I feel like the rural areas get overlooked. It seems that places that have a large city seem to get more monies for things than the small villages. District 47 has both bigger cities and small villages in it. I would like to see everyone get their fair share, whether that is more monies for roads or to help improve an area. I also don’t like seeing the state continue to take away the township’s rights. Such as new legislation that has been passed on wind and solar power. I also feel more people should get involved, maybe then we can see everyone’s side of things.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Education. I would continue to work on encouraging technical training, either on the job or in trade schools to expand. Not everyone wants to go to a four-year college, and we need to show young people that good jobs can be gotten without a four-year degree.\n- Roads. We need to fine a better way of fixing roads in rural townships. Right now it is double taxing the people in the townships to keep their roads in better shape.\n- Community. It should not matter what side of the aisle anyone is on, we should all be working to make a better sense of community, which makes a better Michigan.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI believe people have the right to own a gun but feel that background checks are a good thing. I also feel that red flag laws are important to communities.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI feel that abortion has a place in today’s medicine. I think it should be a decision between the person and their physician. I would hate to see America go back 60 years in time.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nInflation is tough, I don’t know that there is a single solution for it. I would like to see limits set on big business as far as how much of a profit they can have in a year in order to keep cost lower for the consumer. How often have we heard gas prices going up and the business making billions in profit.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nSince both of us are new to the political game, I don’t have anything against my opponent.\nState Representative – 48th District\nJump to candidate\nName: Jennifer Conlin\nAge: 62\nCurrent job: State representative\nEducation: B.A. in English, University of Michigan (1983); M.A. in Journalism, Northwestern University (1984)\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nMy name is Jennifer Conlin and I am currently serving my first term as State Representative in Michigan’s House District 48.\nAs a wife, mother, daughter, and caregiver to my 90-year-old mother, I am committed to finding solutions to better the daily lives of Michiganders, particularly around education, health care, the environment, and transportation. Though I was raised in Ann Arbor, my family has long lived all over Washtenaw County going back seven generations. I also have a number of relatives who have served in city, county, and state government. I am honored to carry on their legacy and give back to my home state, where I attended college, and where I have lived for the past 14 years since moving back after living abroad as a journalist for two consecutive decades.\nAs state representative, I have worked tirelessly on legislation that directly benefits my district and home state. This includes safeguarding reproductive rights, passing gun safety laws, working to protect the environment, and introducing two bills that would lower the cost of insulin in Michigan. I also believe in working across the aisle as someone representing a swing district on important nonpartisan infrastructure issues such as clean drinking water, affordable housing and increasing public transportation.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 48 seat?\nI am running for my second term as state representative because I believe that residents in Washtenaw, Livingston, and Jackson County need a voice to represent them in Lansing; one that rightly takes into account their many views, concerns, and feedback on how to improve our state. I believe that, working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I can make a significant impact on a variety of crucial policy issues that directly impact Michiganders.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- The environment. I am currently working on solutions to addressing the growing problem of environmental pollutants and holding polluters accountable for their actions through direct legislative means.\n- Our military members and veterans. The mental health crisis disproportionately impacts our service members and veterans, and I have championed a bipartisan package of bills as Chair of the House Military, Veterans, and Homeland Security Committee to tackle the issue.\n- The cost of prescription drugs. I sponsored legislation to cap the co-pay on insulin as well as produce generic insulin within our state.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI’d like to start by affirming that I am a supporter of the Second Amendment and have taken my concealed pistol license course. At the same time, I was one of the first journalists to cover the Oxford school shooting, and I firmly believe that gun reform is necessary in the U.S. While the words “common sense” are often seen as cliché, I do believe that there are common sense solutions that we can all agree on that make our communities safer. I already voted on legislation to require the safe storage of firearms and background checks for all gun purchases, but we must do more in exploring feasible legislative solutions that address gun violence.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nAccess to abortions and other medical procedures related to reproductive health are essential. Bodily autonomy is a vital aspect of personal liberty, and we should do all that we can to ensure that women have the right to decide what is best for their bodies.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nInflation is an issue that is largely addressed at the federal level. However, I will continue to partner with my peers in Congress to explore solutions at the state level, including the provision of tax relief and addressing unemployment.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nOne of my challengers openly stated to the press that I have only acted to serve partisan interests instead of pursuing meaningful legislative solutions while in office. Nothing could be further from the truth. If my challenger were actually paying attention to the work being done in the legislature, with a particular appreciation for the months and months of hard work that it takes to craft bills, he would see that I have already passed three bipartisan bills into law that provide benefits to service members’ families, enshrine surrogacy rights in our state, and deeply explore the onerous practice of payday lending. He would also see that, as the Chair of the House Committee on Military, Veterans, and Homeland Security, I have worked with my colleagues and many across the aisle to protect veterans’ mental health through a package of five bills, of which I am the primary sponsor.\nEditor’s note: Democratic incumbent candidate Jennifer Conlin does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Tawn Beliger\nTawn Beliger did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request.

I am running to bring the voice of the common person to Lansing. There is more the state can do to protect the working family, our education system and our environment and I want to make those things happen.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nAs I see it, these are the three primary struggles our state faces and how I hope to combat it.\n- The working family is struggling. Costs continue to rise and wages simply aren’t keeping up. To that end I want to work to reduce housing prices by building more low cost housing, repeal the law preventing municipalities from instituting their own rent control and rent stabilization laws, repeal the “tipped worker” exception to the minimum wage law and raise the minimum wage among other things.\n- Our public school system is in rough shape and needs more attention from the state to lift it up and allow it to thrive again. To that end I will work to increase investment in underfunded schools, work to modernize infrastructure, and work to increase transparency concerning the money the state provides to charter schools.\n- Clear air and clean water is a human right, and yet corporations get away with polluting our water and our air. I want to make the polluters pay and strengthen the states ability to pursue violators of environmental regulations and pay for the clean up of the damage they do. I also want to further our state’s progress to a green energy future.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI believe that working to regulate firearms is imperative. Passing common sense gun laws will help to reduce violence and protect the people of the country.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nAbortion is a right. There is nothing more to be said about it. Just like any right, it needs to be protected and defended.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nA great deal can be done to reduce inflation, but it must begin with holding corporations accountable for price gouging, breaking up monopolies and making the super wealthy pay their fair share in taxes.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nMy opponent has voted against expanding veteran’s rights and protection, she has sponsored a bill to eliminate the board of education, is an election denier*. She believes life begins at conception, and so wishes to restrict a woman’s reproductive freedom, and then proved it by voting against the Reproductive Freedom Act in spite of the fact that District 49 voted overwhelmingly to pass Proposal 3.\n*Editor’s note: WDET has not independently verified claims made regarding State Rep. Ann Bollin’s voting record. Bollin’s voting record can be reviewed here.\nMy stance is diametrically opposed to my opponent. I will fight to protect and help our veterans, prop up and strengthen our public education system and protect women’s right to reproductive health. Most importantly, I will put my personal ideology aside and listen to the voice of the people.\nEditor’s note: Democratic candidate Andy Wood does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Ann Bollin\nState Rep.

Matt Maddock is a lifelong Oakland County resident who has represented the Milford area in the Michigan House of Representatives since 2019. He represents the 51st House District, which includes Highland Township, Milford, Milford Township, White Lake, White Lake Township, and portions of Commerce and Springfield townships in Oakland County.\nAs a conservative Republican, Matt does not stray from the party’s core principles. His priorities include lowering the cost of energy and cutting taxes to make Michigan more competitive for jobs.\nMatt and Meshawn, his wife of more than 20 years, have three children, Gunther, Winsome, and Parker. They live in Milford and belong to Cornerstone Church in Highland, where Matt drives a church bus for the Ignited teen and youth ministry.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 51 seat?\nTo fight for working families in our district.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nThere’s only one priority issue: helping Michigan working families. We need policies and laws that help people make money, have better schools, and rebuild from Biden’s reign of ruin.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI support reforming gun laws to expand gun rights for all Americans.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI want all pregnant women to have healthy, happy, babies. The idea that you would destroy a baby is the worst idea anyone has ever had.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nWe need to get control of state and federal budgets that are out of control. We have this never-ending flow of tax dollars and debt, wasting away the money we need to rebuild our communities and families.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nMy challenger is using a dishonest and disreputable consultant who has said awful things about good people in our district. I guess he just wants to win at all costs. His consultant is a dishonest liar, and I’d be ashamed to be associated with him, he could run a better race without him.\nName: Kevin Ziegler\nKevin Ziegler did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request.

We went back to Syria, where I went to school and graduated with a degree in architectural engineering from the University of Aleppo.\nIn Syria, I taught at the university for four years, and while there received a scholarship from the Austrian government to do research at the University of Economics and Business in Vienna. From Vienna, I moved to the U.S. in 1992, where I went back to school to get my MBA from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\nAfter graduating, I started working in real estate and construction. I am currently a real estate broker. I own my real estate company, Great Estates Realty, LLC, and my construction company, Martini Construction Company.\nI lived under dictatorship in Syria, where organizing, assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and many books were banned. When I came to this country, I was welcomed with open arms. For the ﬁrst time in my life, I felt that I have a country that I love, and that loves me back.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 54 seat?\nWhen living under dictatorship, I lived in constant fear of the regime. I had no voice. This country gave me my voice back. Running for oﬃce is not optional for me. It is a debt that I owe to this country and to our community that I feel obliged to repay. I will bring my unique life experiences to Lansing and provide the high quality leadership and representation that our district deserves.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Economy. As an over two-decade Michigan small business owner, I am committed to reaching across the aisle to enact pragmatic, pro-growth economic policies that reduce burdensome costs for working families and increase the competitiveness of Michigan’s economy.\n- Education. Our children and our teachers are under assault by political extremists through book bans and efforts to defund our schools. In Lansing, I will fight to provide high quality mental health care for our children, to protect their right to learn without government interference, and for parents to have better access to childcare.\n- Reproductive rights. I believe in a woman’s right to make reproductive decisions, with the help of her doctor, and without undue interference by politicians. In Lansing, I will ensure that access to reproductive care continues to be protected, including access to contraception, IVF, and vital abortion medications like Mifepristone.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI will not take guns away from law-abiding gun owners, but I will do everything I can to pass and implement common-sense gun legislation to prevent tragedies like the shooting in Oxford from ever happening again in our state. I will not accept a future where military grade ﬁrearms are used to gun down school children.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nAbortion is a very hard decision for a woman to make, and sometimes it is necessary to save her life. This decision should not be politicized and should be left to the woman and her doctor. In Lansing, I will ensure that access to reproductive care continues to be protected, including by protecting the usage of vital abortion medications like Mifepristone.\nWhat is your solution to ﬁght the current inﬂation crisis in the U.S.?\nNational monetary policy is not decided on the state level. Inﬂation is a country wide crisis that is being handled on the federal level, but what we can do in Michigan is work on putting more money back into people’s pockets through state tax policies and work on improving the economy to provide better paying jobs.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things diﬀerently?\nI disagree with my opponent’s extreme positions on many issues, which are reﬂected in her votes. Most concerning are her votes against public safety, public health, and women’s reproductive rights.\nHere are some bills that she voted against, that I would have voted for:\n- HB 4138: Enforces universal background checks for ﬁrearm purchases.\n- SB 471: Prohibiting possession of ﬁrearms by persons convicted of misdemeanors involving domestic violence\n- HB 4127: Prohibiting possession of ﬁrearms at a polling place.\n- HB 4146: Prohibiting individuals from purchasing ﬁrearms if he/she has an extreme risk protection order.\n- HB 4342: Requiring installation of ﬁltration systems in child care centers.\n- HB 4341: Providing clean drinking water in schools and child care.\n- HB 4949: Creating reproductive health act.\n- SB 477: Eliminating prohibition on oﬀering referrals for abortion services in pregnant and parenting student services oﬃces.\nName: Donni Steele\nState Rep. Donni Steele did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request. You can find more information at Steele‘s campaign website.\nEditor’s note: Republican incumbent candidate Donni Steele does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nState Representative – 55th District\nJump to candidate\nName: Trevis Harrold\nAge: 31\nCurrent job: U.S. Army Military Intelligence Officer, former Foreign Service Officer at the U.S. State Department, and Global Public Policy Leader at Dow.\nEducation: B.A. from Eastern Michigan University in political science, economics, and international business. Master’s degree in public policy at the University of Michigan. Master’s degree in Business Administration at the University of Michigan (ongoing).\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nTrevis has dedicated his career to national security and serving in public service, having served through both the Department of State and the Army. As a U.S. diplomat, Trevis led the United States Naval Ship (USNS) Comfort’s visit to Jamaica to highlight the U.S.-Jamaican partnership. Due to our efforts, 30 positive news stories about the\nUSNS were published, reaching 12.9 million people globally. The USNS provided free\nhealth care to over 6,600 Jamaicans and represented $2.2 million in humanitarian aid.\nConsequently, at the end of his tenure overseas, Trevis joined the Army as a Military\nIntelligence Officer, channeling his commitment to service on home soil. Trevis then worked for Dow Chemical in their government affairs division focusing on trade,\nimmigration, and geopolitical security issues. As a member of the Rochester Rotary club and Rochester Chamber of Commerce, Trevis knows the importance of public-private partnerships and knows what it takes to see Michigan thrive economically.\nTrevis’ commitment to you is to work every day to keep our community safe, strong, and exceptional. To make sure our schools remain among the best in the state. And to faithfully represent the MI HD 55 values in Lansing.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 55 seat?\nI’m running for state representative because, in the greater Rochester area, duty, service, and honor are integrated into who we are. I will work every day to keep our community safe, to make sure our schools remain among the best in the state, and to faithfully represent our values in Lansing. I will do so by leveraging my background as a veteran, former foreign service officer, businessman, and dedicated public servant to lead this community with integrity. As representative, you can count on me to stand up for our families, our schools, and provide equal protection for everyone under the law.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Gun violence. My community neighbors Oxford, the site of the tragic school mass shooting in 2021. We have also been deeply affected by the recent national shooting that occurred at the Brooklands in Rochester Hills. While I believe in the Second Amendment, I also believe we must be honest that gun violence presents a severe public safety and public health issue. And it is precisely because of my experience both operating firearms and working in national security that I believe we must pass common-sense gun safety legislation. We must prohibit terrorists, the mentally ill, and domestic abusers from obtaining guns. As an Army servicemember, I do not believe ordinary citizens should be able to easily obtain weapons or materials that allow them to outgun their local police or the military.\nMass shootings and gun violence are a threat to the security of our families, our communities, and our schools. No parent should fear their child’s safety after dropping them off for class. Failing to do all we can to protect our children is a failure to put the public first – and, in my view, a neglect of duty to address one of the nation’s pressing security issues. - Economic opportunity. Growing economic opportunity begins by investing in talent in our communities and the future. We must train the next generation to take on roles in Michigan’s 21st century economy by connecting our workforce to the training that will prepare them for the trades, advanced manufacturing, technical, and cyber jobs of the future. Michigan has always been a place where things are designed and built. Our state has an amazing history of innovation, from the creation of the modern automobile to the invention of penicillin.\nBut the economy is evolving in our state, and we need to face forward and change with it. For our communities to thrive, we must be serious and strategic about growing economic opportunity and combating inflation here in Michigan. That starts with investing in education, connecting our talented young people with opportunities in our businesses, and ensuring that our entrepreneurs and small business owners can grow by hiring talent directly from our communities. This is how we continue to retain and recruit talent to Michigan. - Health care. I am committed to safeguarding and advancing women’s rights. This includes ensuring all women have access to comprehensive reproductive health, regardless of their economic status. I will also work to improve local access to family planning services and educational resources and fight any attempts that threaten these fundamental rights. All Americans should have access to health care they can afford, regardless of pre-existing conditions. No one should ever go broke because they happen to get sick, and no family should have to decide whether they can afford to save the life of a loved one.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nWhen elected, I will work to expand our state’s laws on gun safety. I will work to ensure that our recently-enacted safe storage laws are properly enforced, and to make it so that ordinary citizens cannot easily purchase firearms and ammunition that outguns our police and military. I will work to establish legal protections that strengthen our ‘Gun Free Zone’ legislation to keep out all firearms that are not carried by our law enforcement personnel. I will advocate to get “ghost guns” off of our streets. I will stand up for true school security — bringing more resources into our classrooms and not wasting money on failed concepts like ‘arming teachers’. I will also continue\nto be an unwavering advocate, speaking up in public, attending rallies, and using my voice to fight for a future free of the scourge of gun violence.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI am committed to safeguarding and advancing women’s rights. This includes ensuring all women have access to comprehensive reproductive health, regardless of their economic status. I will also work to improve local access to family planning services and educational resources and fight any attempts that threaten these fundamental rights.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nWe need to prioritize business here in the U.S. (and especially in Michigan), so the price of goods is not so contingent on global (in)stability. We have the brightest workforce in the world, and leveraging their schools will boost local economies, provide more jobs here in the U.S., and limit inflation. Further, we can expand our energy sources to diminish how much the rising cost of gas hurts the everyday Michigander.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nOur current representative opposed tax cuts for working people and retirees and common-sense gun safety legislation that helps keep our kids safe at school. He even opposed repealing the archaic 1931 law that outlaws abortion even in cases of rape and incest. As a state representative, I will protect reproductive freedom, support common-sense gun reform, and prioritize a tax-code that bolsters the middle class and ensures dollars are put back in the hands of Michiganders.\nName: Alexander Hawkins\nAge: 29\nCurrent job: U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal Officer\nEducation: Bachelor’s Degree, Central Michigan University\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI am an Army Bomb Tech veteran with nearly a decade of service, currently serving as an officer in the Michigan National Guard and as a Reserve Sheriff’s Deputy in Rochester Hills.\nIn addition to these roles, I have had the privilege of working for Senator Peters and\nCongresswoman Slotkin, right here in Rochester, fighting for the constituents in our\ncommunity at the federal level.\nMy dedication to community service runs deep. Since childhood, my wife Amanda and I\nhave volunteered extensively in Rochester and Oakland County, where we both grew up. From mentoring youth in the Civil Air Patrol to participating in local theater to serving, we are committed to making a positive impact in our community.\nAs President of the North Oakland Chorale, a community choir, I am passionate about\npromoting the arts and enriching our local culture. With a bachelor’s degree in Political\nScience from Central Michigan University, I bring a strong foundation in public policy to my endeavors.\nTogether, with Amanda and our dog Luna, I proudly call Rochester home. I am eager to\ncontinue crafting policies and supporting community projects that will enhance the lives of the families in District 55 and Michigan as a whole.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District\n55 seat?\nI am running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 55 seat because I am\ndeeply committed to serving my community and ensuring that our state government is held accountable to the people it serves. Having worked closely with Congresswoman Slotkin, I have seen the positive impacts that thoughtful and effective legislation can have on our communities.\nMy background in public service, including my time in the U.S. Army and my work as a\nReserve Deputy for the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office, has equipped me with the\nexperience and dedication needed to advocate for our district. I am motivated by a desire to create a better future for our families, friends, and neighbors, and to address the pressing issues that impact our daily lives.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Education. Ensure quality education for all students is accessible and that educators and educational institutions have the support they need to thrive.\n■ Increase funding: I will advocate for increased state funding for public\nschools to ensure that all districts have the necessary resources to\nprovide a high-quality education. This includes updating facilities,\nproviding modern technology, and supporting extracurricular activities,\nincluding the arts.\n■ Teacher support: I plan to implement programs to attract and retain\ntalented teachers, including competitive salaries, professional\ndevelopment opportunities, and support for continuing education. Ensure\nthat teachers have the resources they need to succeed in the classroom.\n■ Curriculum improvement: I promote a curriculum that prepares\nstudents for the modern workforce and encourages partnerships between\nschools and local nonprofits and businesses to provide students with\nhands-on learning experiences. - Community development. Vibrant communities are essential for the well being of\nresidents. Addressing traffic control, affordable housing and economic development is crucial for our long-term success.\n■ Economic growth: I will support policies that foster economic growth\nand job creation, including incentives for small businesses, investment in\ninfrastructure, and development of local industries. Focus on creating\nhigh-quality jobs that offer fair wages.\n■ Affordable housing: I will work to increase the availability of affordable\nhousing by supporting programs that provide financial assistance to\nfirst-time homebuyers, incentivizing the construction of affordable\nhousing units, and addressing zoning laws that hinder development.\n■ Environmental sustainability: I advocate for policies that promote\nenvironmental sustainability and conservation. This includes investing in\ngreen infrastructure, supporting renewable energy projects, and ensuring\nthat polluters are held accountable for their actions. - Safety. Addressing issues such as crime prevention and enhancing emergency\nresponse is necessary to achieve a safer society.\n■ Crime prevention: I support initiatives that address the root causes of\ncrime, such as poverty, lack of education, and substance abuse. Invest in\ncommunity policing programs that build trust between law enforcement\nand the communities they serve.\n■ Emergency preparedness: I will enhance emergency preparedness\nand response capabilities by ensuring that local agencies have the\nresources and training they need to respond effectively to natural\ndisasters, public health emergencies, and other crises. Additionally,\nsupporting mental health awareness activities and focusing on local safety\nand preventative techniques early on.\n■ Support for law enforcement: I will advocate for adequate funding\nand resources for law enforcement agencies and first responders. This\nincludes providing training, mental health support, and equipment to\nensure that they can perform their duties safely and effectively. I\nencourage transparency and accountability in policing to build public\ntrust.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nAs someone who has earned the “Moms Demand Action Gun Sense Candidate” distinction, I recognize the issue of gun reform as being at the forefront of policy issues in Michigan. I strongly support universal background checks for all gun sales, including private transactions and gun shows, to ensure that firearms do not fall into the hands of individuals prohibited from owning them, such as those with a history of violence or severe mental illness.\nI advocate for the implementation of red flag laws that allow for the temporary removal of firearms from individuals deemed to pose a threat to themselves or others, based on credible evidence and due process. As someone who is trained and proficient in fully automatic and semi-automatic weapons, I understand first hand the danger of these weapons in the wrong hands. I believe in the importance of investing in community based violence prevention programs and mental health services to address the root causes of gun violence. My approach to gun reform balances the need for public safety with respect for individual rights, aiming to create a safer environment for all.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI believe that women have the fundamental right to make decisions about their own bodies, including the right to access safe and legal abortion services. Comprehensive reproductive health care, including access to contraception, sex education, and abortion, is essential for women to lead fully productive lives and have control over their own destinies. Restrictions on these health services disproportionately harm those who face existing significant barriers to health care, such as communities of color and low-income families.\nProtecting reproductive rights is crucial for ensuring equality and freedom for everyone.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nCentral to my vision is the creation of green jobs, which is very promising for economic growth and a healthier environment. I will advocate for investments in renewable energy infrastructure which will generate employment opportunities in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance.\nThere is opportunity to retrofit buildings for energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption and creating jobs in construction and engineering sectors. Investing in\ninfrastructure is a reliable way to ensure employment while the inflation crisis stabilizes.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nMark Tisdel, labeled as a climate change denier, opposes forward-looking policies.\nDismissing the scientific consensus on climate change, he rejects investments in green technology as unnecessary and potentially harmful to economic growth. His stance reflects a skepticism towards environmental regulations and a preference for traditional industries, advocating instead for deregulation and reliance on fossil fuels.\nI emphasize the importance of training programs and educational initiatives to equip\nworkers with the skills needed in the emerging green economy. We need to ensure we\nare at the forefront of forward thinking. Doing our fair share to keep a sustainable\nenvironment is the right thing to do and Rochester can be ahead of the game at the\nintersection of entrepreneurship and innovation.\nName: Mark Tisdel\nState Rep. Mark Tisdel did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request. You can find more information at Tisdel’s campaign website.\nEditor’s note: Republican incumbent candidate Mark Tisdel does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Sharon MacDonell\nAge: 62\nCurrent job: State representative\nEducation: B.A in history, University of Michigan Ann Arbor\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI have lived in District 56 for 30 years. I met my husband while living in Royal Oak, married and adopted two daughters while in Clawson, and we made Troy the family’s home in 2005. I first became an activist when Troy’s city council threatened to close the Troy Public Library. I used my blog called “Keep Troy Strong” to unite the community and organizations to fight for and ultimately save the public library. I used my organizing skills again in the successful effort to recall Troy’s embarrassingly divisive mayor in 2012. And when a city manager was caught embezzling funds and accused of abusive behavior, I demanded transparency from city council members who had defended him.\nOver time I took on more formal leadership roles, co-founding Troy Indivisible and being elected co-chair and then chair of the Troy Democratic Club. My priorities as a legislator are funding and supporting public education, protecting vulnerable adults and seniors, fighting discrimination, improving access to health care, and continuing to strengthen Michigan’s infrastructure, economy, and green initiatives.\nI proudly championed many important bills in Lansing, including “Justice for Allie,” House Bills 4320 and 4387 which protect vulnerable adults from sexual predators and Safe Storage Gun Legislation, House Bill 4139.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 56 seat?\nWhen I learned that SCOTUS would likely overturn Roe v Wade in 2022, and that Michigan would revert to an old law punishing doctors with four years in jail, I knew I had to do something. I was pleased that Gov. Whitmer was trying to change that but still wanted to be in a position to fight any laws criminalizing abortion in Michigan. As a community activist in Troy, I have used my organizing, leadership, and marketing skills to run activist campaigns. We successfully organized against anti-labor, anti community forces who tried to close our library, force us to accept an incompetent mayor, and defend an embezzling city manager. I then co-founded Troy Indivisible and became co-chair and then chair of the Troy Democratic Club. I worked hard for 14 years in my community, with no title or office, to make my community a better place for my family and neighbors.\nThat’s the kind of passion that drove me to seek office as a state representative in 2022. Now it’s time to get reelected so I can continue my work. For the 2024 general election, I’ve received some early endorsements from EMILY’s List, Planned Parenthood, Sheet Metal Workers and more. We launched our campaign with a Kickoff Party on Feb. 3. We have three social media channels and a website up and running. I am making fundraising calls two hours a day, and this week we will launch our Facebook and Instagram advertising campaigns and begin call/text banking. My campaign staff and I have the energy, skills, motivation, appeal, and modern marketing techniques to lead us to victories in November.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nOne top issue of my campaign is building a robust economy centered on a strong middle class. In the legislature I support policies that are focused on growing the middle class, such as strengthening unions, supporting competitive wages, ensuring work standards, improving the quality of jobs we offer, and much more.\nAnother top three issue of my campaign is fostering a prosperous, skilled workforce by supporting trade/CTE programs, expanding workers’ rights to collectively bargain, and offering adequate schooling or training.\nLastly, a top priority of my campaign is making critical investments in infrastructure. As a newly elected state representative in 2022, I walked into a road issue in my district regarding I-75 sound walls and the excessive noise complaints stemming from I-75 upgrades. I worked to secure $10 million in funding to construct four sound walls that qualify in the affected area. I was also the primary bill sponsor for HB 4353 to create Michigan’s first ever HOV lanes along I-75 legislation which included accessing $40 million in federal funds for road repairs. Leveraging the relationships with transportation stakeholders I have built during my time as Majority Vice Chair of the House Transportation Committee, I will be hosting a series of informational meetings with the Oakland County Road Commission and County legislators to discuss road funding issues such as creating a mileage-based user fee pilot program. It is my intention that this meeting will catalyze productive conversations among my colleagues about the future of road funding in Michigan.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI support common sense gun legislation that makes Michigan families and children safer. In 2023, I voted yes on a package of bills to strengthen safe storage laws, red flag laws, and require universal background checks. Law enforcement officials tell us that these laws are already saving lives! In the past, I have worked with Moms Demand Action, Everytown for Gun Safety, March for Our Lives, and other groups to discuss how we can enact legislation that will reduce gun violence in Michigan. A recall petition was filed in my district because I advocated for and voted yes on the gun safety package, but it failed. I remain focused on having difficult conversations with voters about this issue and I will never stop fighting to enact common sense gun laws in Michigan.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI fully support strengthening reproductive rights for women and I have worked closely with Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan as well as other women’s health advocates to vote through the Reproductive Health Act, which I proudly co-sponsored. I also co-sponsored and voted yes on HB 4006, which was passed into law to repeal criminal penalties for administering abortions. Since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade, and continue to threaten our rights further, state legislatures are more important than ever to guarantee access to reproductive health care. I will continue to be a strong advocate for reproductive freedom and ensuring protections for women’s right to choose, under Michigan law, that a vast majority of Michiganders support.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nHigh inflation is a troubling issue for the U.S. economy. However, it is a natural outcome of the COVID pandemic. We all are feeling the pressures of inflation, whether it is a trip to the grocery store, purchasing a home, getting approved for a new loan, or buying a car, but people should understand that the U.S. economy is faring much better than those in other countries. Inflation has come down significantly from as high as 7% in 2021 to just around 3% in July 2024 meaning that President Biden has done a great job and we are moving in a positive direction.\nIt is our job now in Lansing to enact good policies that will keep this positive trend going. That means making key investments to reduce the housing shortage, keeping the labor market strong, and creating fair tax systems that generate needed revenue without overburdening middle and low income classes, keeping regulations in check to keep the cost of doing business in Michigan low, and more to attract investment and growth in high quality jobs.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nOver the course of my years spent volunteering as an activist and working as a state representative, I have focused on my neighbors’ most fundamental concerns. I’m not familiar with the Republican candidate’s views on any of these issues, so I can’t guess. I will continue to focus on critical investments in infrastructure, mental health care, public education, Michigan’s clean energy transition, and other important issues that Michiganders expect the legislature to deliver on.\nEditor’s note: Democratic incumbent candidate Sharon MacDonell does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: David Kniffen\nAge: 45\nCurrent job: Entrepreneur\nEducation: 3x Associate’s Degrees from Oakland Community College, and Bachelor’s Degree from University of Michigan.\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI’m a husband to a beautiful wife, (Connie, RN, BSN), of 13 years, a father, a businessman, restaurateur, builder, photographer, writer, DJ, filmmaker, graphic designer, CDL holder, inventor, I could go on with the many other hats I’ve worn, as I’ve pursued my interests to the fullest and never stopped learning. Im serving my fifth term as HOA President of my sub, I take my duties seriously in whatever role and fulfill them; over and above what is expected. My family is everything to me, I am the head of the household and the protector. My two sons Donnie (10), and Joey (4) were named after my maternal grandparents for whom I grew up in Troy living with, (Don and Jo). My wife and I were married between the apple groves at our orchard on a snowy NYE afternoon and celebrated our reception with close friends and family in the wedding barn I built for her. I cherish the freedom we have in this great nation and am willing to step up and do my part to help preserve it.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 56 seat?\nI feel a duty to my family, community and state to step up and do what is needed to turn Michigan around, while protecting our rights, freedom and liberty.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nOn my website NoFundraise.com, I list a host of issues for which need urgent attention. Priority is a combination of the inflation crisis, government accountability and preservation of liberty. It is these three things that have become intertwined and causing the most damage to our state. Please see my statement on the inflation crisis below.\nOutside of those issues, we have a host of problems that are going unchecked and seemingly ignored, the fentanyl crisis, human trafficking, unhealthy lifestyles, and corruption are all major issues in our state that I would like to see brought forward and tackled.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nThe Second Amendment is the foundation of our freedom and liberty in this nation. Any attempt to diminish that fundamental right is improper and erodes the very freedom we should all cherish so much.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nThe SCOTUS has ruled that this is an issue left to the states to choose, based on the needs and desires of each state’s citizens. The state of Michigan voted on this issue and enshrined the choice of the people into the state constitution.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nFirst, I am glad you asked this and framed it as you did, because this is spot on, we have an inflation crisis and there is no sugar coating it. Inflation is a multifaceted problem, what the state of Michigan can do is two-fold, curtail wasteful spending, and lower taxes. When a government spends wildly and excessively it creates a need to raise more revenue to cover. That money comes in the form of taxes and fees that are passed on to the people and the businesses, for which the latter passes that on again to the consumer. Property taxes, license fees, income taxes, permit fees, gas taxes, license plates, these have all increased substantially. These added costs make life more expensive.\nI did a tax and fee breakdown of your average earned income employee, making $75/yr, living in my district in a modest 2,000-square-foot home driving a modest car and between all the payroll taxes and fees and property tax, they could be working as far into the year as June 3, simply to pay the government. This is part of the inflation problem Michigan can fix, and it only happens through accountability in how the state spends money. To do that, we must cut out the waste and the state, NOT the people must live and operate within its means, bloated budgets with wasteful spending must be stopped.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nFrom what I have seen, Sharon is in lock step with her party, 100%. While I am a Republican, I have my own mind and make my own choices. My decisions would be based upon the needs, and desires of the people I represent as well as the state and U.S. Constitution, for which I would be swearing an oath to uphold. I have a big problem with many if not most of the actions and directions Sharon and her party have steered Michigan, including the bloated and wasteful budget. First off, our form of government was designed to have checks and balances. Further, the legislation was designed in such a way to cause and require debate before moving bills forward. Yet, over the last two years we have seen very little debate and bills being pushed through at rapid speed. The increase in budget will haunt us for years to come. We cannot allow the state to be ran with such reckless abandon and lack of accountability to the citizens, responsibility in governance must start now.\nEditor’s note: Republican candidate David Kniffen does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nState Representative – 57th District\nJump to candidate\nName: Aisha Farooqi\nAge: 40\nCurrent job: Assistant prosecutor, Wayne County\nEducation: Bachelor’s degree, University of Michigan Dearborn; Law degree, University of Detroit Mercy\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nMy family and I moved to the U.S. in 1993, after my mother earned a scholarship to study chemistry at University of Detroit-Mercy. I attended Detroit Public Schools and later Farmington High School. I earned my bachelor’s degree in psychology from the University of Michigan-Dearborn and served as the president of my class at the University of Detroit Mercy-School of Law. Following graduation from law school, I worked both in public and private practice. I have represented lower-income clients as a legal aid attorney at Lakeshore Legal Aid, and offered pro bono services to those in need, while operating my own law firm. Currently, I work as an assistant prosecuting attorney. At the prosecutor’s office, I have learned to be firm but also to lead with compassion.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 57 seat?\nI am running to represent the 57th District in the Michigan House of Representatives because the people of the district deserve to be seen, heard and served by someone who has proven she knows how to achieve positive results. Currently an assistant prosecuting attorney, I have spent my adult life as a public servant, fighting for the vulnerable and marginalized members of our community. A hard-working, accomplished professional who understands public policy, I also understand the challenges faced daily by ordinary Michigan residents who deserve better from our state government.\nI have learned from my experiences that too many members of our society are getting left behind by a system that has neither enough resources nor the right kind of insight to help them. I believe fervently in wise economic development policies – supporting small business and creating a more favorable economic environment – so that more people will have a chance to enjoy prosperity and perhaps be in a position to help others in need.\nWhat are your top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces, and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Economic development. Creating good paying jobs, supporting small businesses and creating a more favorable economic environment\n- High quality education. Requires us to properly fund public education with attention on teacher salaries, student programs and critical support services\n- Access to health care. We must reduce excessive costs without compromising quality of care.\nEconomic development is at the forefront of my agenda. I believe in fostering an environment where all Michiganders have access to good-paying jobs, supporting our vibrant small businesses, and creating a robust economic infrastructure that benefits everyone. I support programs that invest in workforce development and education like Michigan Reconnect. By equipping our Michigan residents with the skills and training they need, we ensure that they can secure well-paying jobs in emerging industries such as advanced manufacturing and technology sectors. Additionally, small businesses are the backbone of Michigan’s economy, and I am dedicated to implementing policies that support their growth and sustainability. Due to my upbringing, where I experienced my father working for a small business, I know that small businesses stimulate our communities. I will work with my colleagues to provide funding for entrepreneurship grant programs.\nInfrastructure is another key area of focus. Investing in infrastructure not only improves our transportation networks but also creates thousands of jobs in construction and related industries. I support initiatives that modernize our roads, bridges, and public transportation systems and expand broadband access to rural and underserved areas. This enhances our quality of life and attracts businesses and investors looking to locate or expand in Michigan. Overall, I believe in policies that promote economic justice, including ensuring equal pay for equal work and protecting workers’ rights to organize and collectively bargain.\nWith regard to education, as I learned during my time attending Detroit Public Schools, educational opportunity is too often tied to a person’s zip code. This should not be. It affects the 57th District as well, where the Troy School District is losing teachers to Novi because they’re getting better salary offers. We must make sure we pay our teachers well while providing students with everything from textbooks and supplies to tutoring and extracurricular opportunities. I will work to ensure the state properly funds all public schools while emphasizing the availability of support such as health professionals, social workers and counselors – not only for students, but also for faculty and staff.\nWith regard to health care: From doctor’s office visits to prescription drugs to emergency care, the cost of health care is squeezing the budgets of ordinary people while bringing some to the brink of financial ruin. I know members of our community living on Social Security who have only $200 a month left after they get the treatments they need just to survive.\nI will work with my colleagues to make sure we control health care costs by helping everyone get access to affordable, comprehensive coverage, by continuing to put downward pressure on prescription drug costs, by promoting wellness and preventive care, and by looking for legislative and regulatory opportunities to reduce excessive costs without compromising quality of care.\nAlso, too many members of our community are slipping through the cracks for lack of access to mental health services. Many of these people could thrive and be positive members of society if they only had access to this kind of support. I will work with my colleagues in the House to expand access to mental health services so that no one who needs it will be turned away, and everyone will have a chance to live the life they desire.\nInflation is also a top issue, but your question on that is answered below.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI believe we must enact common-sense gun laws that prevent the most dangerous among us from getting access to high-powered weapons, including the expanded use of background checks and waiting periods. I also believe we should restrict certain weapons from being available to the general public, as their only conceivable use is for mass killings. I respect the Second Amendment and do not want to deny law-abiding citizens their right to keep and bear arms, but I do believe this right can be balanced with common-sense measures to protect the citizenry from gun violence.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nAfter the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, Michigan voters passed an amendment to the state constitution that ensured Michigan will continue to be a state that supports reproductive health care. I will work to ensure that women in Michigan are able to exercise their full legal and constitutional rights as decided by our voters.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nWhile this is not an issue that can be addressed through the legislative action of any one state, it is important to acknowledge the real-life struggles that Michiganders are facing daily with the rising costs of essentials like groceries, medications, and housing expenses, not to mention the cost of childcare. Our nation is facing record-high inflation rates. Though combatting inflation requires a long-term approach and bipartisan collaboration, I do champion the Lowering MI Costs plan, increased access to state-funded programs that help offset increased costs of heating and electricity and overall utility bill and rental assistance, and cost caps on prescription drug prices.\nLawmakers need to understand the pressure this puts on working families and prioritize the issue in their decision-making process. As a member of the Legislature, I will work with my colleagues to find every opportunity to a) lessen the cost burden state government puts on individuals; b) eliminate state-imposed costs on the businesses that provide these critical needs, so we do not make it more difficult for them to lower their costs; and c) promote smart budgeting and economic policies that protect the spending power of individuals.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger have you disagreed with, and how would you do things differently?\nMy focus is on my own race, but I believe staying politically aware is important. Given my track record and my priorities, I know I am a qualified candidate.\nName: Tyler Fox\nAge: 28\nCurrent job: Purchasing coordinator for the city of Sterling Heights\nEducation: Masters in Public Administration from Oakland University\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nMy name is Tyler Fox. I am a Troy Planning Commissioner, a former union president, a former small business owner, and a stroke survivor. I am running to make a difference in my community and to lower costs for the average person. Our community is built on hard work and the middle class, and it’s time we elect a representative that will deliver results for the community.\nUnlike our current representative, I will bring our taxes from Lansing back into our community, securing investments in our infrastructure. This will create jobs, stop blackouts, and show our residents that our government is working for them — not against them. I also will ensure we are supporting small businesses. I plan to lower the tax burden on small businesses and members of the middle class. We need to support our small businesses as they are the backbone of our economy. I look forward to the chance to serve this community, and I hope to earn the community’s support.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 57 seat?\nI am running for Michigan’s 57th House District because this is my community, and it’s a community I am proud to be a part of. I believe this community is filled with hard working people that deserve a representative that works as hard as they do. Our current representative has missed many votes this session, doing his best to avoid giving his unpopular opinions. Our district deserves better, and I want to make up for two years of lost time.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Housing crisis. Living in Michigan is wonderful, but it is getting too expensive. Renters and homeowners are getting priced out of our communities, and we need to take a stand. I would propose higher taxes on out of state companies buying up homes to create rentals, and I would push communities to build more missing-middle ranch homes that provide excellent starter homes. Whether you are buying your first home, or trying to downsize in the community you have always lived in, we need to take efforts as a state to make that housing available.\n- Regular blackouts. The state of Michigan has the second highest rate of rolling blackouts of any state in the country. The only state ahead of us is Texas. We also consistently pay some of the highest rates year after year. Our state must take a firm stance against DTE, demanding dramatic reinvestment in our power grid.\nThis district is a dense, urban district. But you can check DTE’s outage map after most rainfalls and see power out for people across the community. Enough is enough. - Childcare expenses. My wife and I are planning on starting a family within the next two years, but the high costs of childcare are holding us back. The state must step in and subsidize childcare so that parents don’t need to break the bank to protect their children. We also need to pass universal parental leave, and expand access to overnight and infant care options. That is how we protect children in our state.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI believe reasonable gun ownership is an important right. I do not, however, believe that criminals and those dealing with mental health crises should have access to weapons. We need common sense reform that allows access to responsible gun owners while limiting access for those that should not have access to weapons. Growing up, I lived in Oxford and in Rochester Hills. Both of these communities have had mass shootings within my lifetime. Both shootings involved children dying or being injured. I believe the safe storage laws passed by the legislature are a positive step in the right direction, and that we need to pass legislation that will keep our children safe from gun violence.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI unequivocally support a person’s right to choose. In Michigan we have resolved this conversation through our constitution, which has enshrined access within our state. Now that access has been protected legally, it is time we shift the conversation toward the provision of prenatal care and contraceptive care. I also unequivocally support protecting the right to pursue in vitro fertilization, and I believe recent Republican efforts to restrict access show that they truly do not have the best interests of parents or\nchildren at heart.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nThe best way to fight inflation is to put money back into the pockets of Michigan residents. I support shifting the tax burden off of middle class families, and instead focus on taxing large companies that take advantage of folks by raising prices while earning record profits. I also support bolstering small businesses, and helping them compete with larger companies across our state.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nOur current representative, Thomas Kuhn, has not successfully brought a single dollar back to our district from Lansing. To me, that is the definition of a dereliction of duty. He is not interested in working for us, and so instead I plan to secure investments in our roads and power grid. I plan to work with my fellow legislators, securing solid wins for our community. We need people in Lansing willing to do the hard work, and that\nsimply isn’t Thomas Kuhn.\nName: Douglas Waggener\nAge: 70\nCurrent job: Retired IBEW electrician\nEducation: Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, (’90 Lawrence Technological University)\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI’ll be 71 in August, born and raised in Royal Oak (Dondero ’71), I have lived in Troy since 1988. Raised two step-kids since they were 1 and 4, Kristen (46), and Derek (43), plus two of my own, Amy (34) and Zack (32). Understand full well the tribulations of trying to raise the best kids possible. I think I’m unique because I not only spent my whole career working with my hands as an IBEW electrician, but I also attended Lawrence Technological University from 1982-1990 and graduated with a BSEE. I know full well what it takes to excel academically. It is quite apparent to me the synthesis of the part to the whole is for us to figure out, and that although I may not have the solutions, at least I am aware of the complexity of the problem.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 57 seat?\nThe No. 1 reason is that I have a lot of opinions regarding the topics of today and by becoming a candidate, I am certainly afforded much more exposure to present my ideas. My son Zack has helped me get a website together (thevoiceofthemiddleclass.com) where I have expressed my thoughts on such topics as education, abortion, LGBTQ issues, the Supreme Court, Right to Work, with more to come.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nThe No. 1 priority is to assure that every student in Michigan not only feels safe from harm but is safe from harm. Whatever it takes. The Department of Mental Health needs to take a more active role. Neutralize the bullying. No child’s right to a safe education shall be infringed by another’s presumed right to bear arms.\nThe No. 2 priority is education. Thinking freely is a good thing but it is a better thing if it is backed up with a good education. The theory “less is more” does not apply to knowledge. I have included some of my thoughts on education on “thevoiceofthemiddleclass.com”\nThe No. 3 priority is career training for all of those would like a second chance at getting on the right career path. Identify which paths are both lucrative and attainable. There could always be more intern opportunities for students to get work experience. Make it easier to get hired, but at the same time a grace period to make it easier to be let go if things don’t work out.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI wish we lived in a world where guns weren’t necessary. I hope to have a longer answer shortly on my website. There is a great book, “The Second Amendment” by Michael Waldman, which is at the Troy Library, and everyone should read who is interested in the topic. I think the most noteworthy thing(s) about the Second Amendment are the words “well-regulated.”\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI think a woman has a right to get an abortion. I elaborate on “thevoiceofthemiddleclass.com.”\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nInflation is market driven and the Federal Reserve has more control over that than most people realize. I’m sure what contributed to the out of bounds rise was and is all the stimulus money handed out. Nobody wants to give that back do they? I will always reach out and offer assistance to whoever asks.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI have nothing but good things to say about my two democratic opponents.\nName: Thomas Kuhn\nState Rep. Thomas Kuhn did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request. You can find more information at the Michigan House Republican’s website.\nEditor’s note: Republican incumbent candidate Thomas Kuhn does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nState Representative – 58th District\nJump to candidate\nName: Nate Shannon\nState Rep.

I’m blessed to have had a Christian upbringing. I’m the second oldest of four boys. My favorite sport is motocross. I used to compete in the ’70s and I have great respect for those who compete at the professional level. I moved to Michigan in 1988. I’m married and have two grown children. My family is a wonderful blessing. I enjoy the outdoors and bike ride whenever possible. Besides my Mechanical Engineering degree, I’m a skilled machinist. The machine shop training I received in high school has been very beneficial over the course of my career. In ’78 and ’79 I won the NYS VICA (Vocational and Industrial Clubs of America) machine shop competition.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 58 seat?\nI’m running for District 58 seat to make sure the voters in this district have a conservative (MAGA) candidate to vote for. I’m more than happy to stand in the gap and fight, fight, fight!\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nThree top issues are poor leadership, corruption, and a shortage of Christian legislators in Lansing. It’s time for new leadership. The citizens of Michigan deserve better representation in Lansing. While the working class struggles to put food on the table, Democrats in Lansing are focused on making it more difficult to challenge election results. They should be focused on cleaning up our voter rolls and many other important issues.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI’m pro Second Amendment.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI’m pro-life.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nThe best way to fight inflation is to elect Donald J. Trump as our 47th President.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nMy primary challenger has not been a state rep before. He doesn’t have a voting record I can comment on.\nName: Ron Robinson\nRon Robinson did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request.

Central Michigan University, Certified Public Accountant\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI was born in France while my father was serving in the U.S. Army. My family moved back to Michigan and I have lived here my entire life. I am married to my husband for 35 years and we have two adult children.\nI retired from Joe Randazzo’s in 2018 to assist with the care of my mother. She is now in long-term care.\nMy husband and I are active in a number of charities including twice monthly service to the homeless and disadvantaged in Detroit. I serve on the Cassie Hines Cancer Foundation 5K committee and am active in my church. I also volunteer for a number of local charities.\nWe enjoy the theater, music, hiking, travel and spending time in northern Michigan. We are Lions fans and enjoy Michigan and Michigan State football. Michigan has the best sports fans in the country!\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 59 seat?\nI was encouraged by a number of individuals in Shelby Township to run for office after speaking out about issues in the township. I researched different offices and believe I can bring a unique set of skills to the legislature. My mission is to bring my financial expertise to Michigan’s legislative landscape. My professional career includes work as a CPA, corporate controller for Michigan’s largest retail produce company and a small business owner. My commitment extends to ongoing education in tax law and regulatory compliance, aiming to bring my extensive tax and budgeting knowledge to Michigan’s governance. The current legislature lacks any CPAs in the House and the Senate. I seek to fill this void, leveraging my expertise to address fiscal matters crucial for the state’s development.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- I believe that the reckless spending is the state’s biggest issue. The $83 billion budget is filled with wasteful spending, pet projects, duplicate departments and antiquated programs. It is unsustainable. Michigan’s corporate welfare is out of control and has been ineffective. No other state has this type of program. Saving taxpayer dollars is necessary to properly fund Michigan’s priorities without raising taxes. I want to work to eliminate this wasteful spending.\n- Reducing taxes; especially property taxes. Property taxes are going to tax people out of their homes. The state of Michigan has 60 different state and local taxes.\n- Reduce and eliminate government regulation. The biggest barrier for businesses (especially small businesses) is government regulation.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI support the right to own a gun. Legislatures cannot ignore the problem of gun violence.\nThe state needs to increase access to mental health services to identify and support individuals that my may be at risk. Michigan’s Democratic-led Legislature approved a budget that reduced dedicated funding for student mental health and school safety from $328 million to $26.5 million.\nI would also support increased funding for voluntary gun safety training.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nThe abortion issue was settled in the 2022 election. It is now part of our constitution. I am pro-life from birth to natural death. I will fight to prevent any government funding for abortion services and the outrageous bill to eliminate parental notification.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nReducing government spending and regulation. Current policies are increasing the cost of energy. Affordable, clean energy should be viewed as a necessity for ALL.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI prefer not to answer.\nName: Shelly Fraley\nAge: 56\nCurrent job: Operations manager\nEducation: BA from Bob Jones University, additional BSIT classes from University of Phoenix\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI am a proud Michigander with strong family values. I have a bachelor’s degree in youth work with additional classes toward a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the University of Phoenix. I have spent the last 20+ years working in the software industry. As a mother and grandmother of children in Macomb County schools, I believe in investing in our public schools and our future. I respect our state and federal constitutions and will work to preserve and protect them. I am a strong believer in the value of every individual citizen and their civil rights. I have spent many years in public service through ministry.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 60 seat?\nI am running to protect Michigan’s progress. Unlike what is happening in many red states, Michigan has been able to preserve women’s reproductive rights, expand civil rights and add funding to public education. I am running to keep this progress and expand upon it.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nAs a candidate committed to the values of equity, justice, and progress, I proudly stand with the principles of reproductive freedom, the empowerment of public education, and the unwavering support for our LGBTQIA+ community. Together, we can build a society that respects individual choices, values education, and celebrates inclusion. I am dedicated to being a champion for these causes and to creating a brighter, more inclusive future for all.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI believe that we need substantial gun reform, both in Michigan and federally. I will vote for an assault weapon ban. There are too many guns and it is too easy to buy them. With firearms now being the leading cause of death of children, more needs to be done to curtail this epidemic. We need legislation regarding background checks and restrictions on the types and amounts of weapons for sale, while still respecting law abiding citizens who wish to own guns.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI believe that a woman’s right to bodily autonomy is guaranteed by the Bill of Rights in our Constitution and is now enshrined in our Michigan Constitution. I have been endorsed by Planned Parenthood of Michigan as a SRH Champion.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nI believe that most of the inflationary issues we’re currently experiencing have more to do with corporate greed than outside economic issues. Corporations need to be held accountable for this behavior. The Federal Reserve needs to make note of this and start to bring interest down.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nMy challenger has endorsed Donald Trump. I cannot imagine a more irresponsible choice to lead our nation. Donald Trump is now a convicted felon, but long before that he was not qualified to lead this nation. In addition, his Project 2025 is a blueprint for destroying every vital component of our Constitution and democratic republic and turning our government into a theocratic autocracy. This should terrify every voter in this country.\nEditor’s note: Democratic candidate Shelly Fraley does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Joseph Aragona\nAge: 37\nCurrent job: State representative for Michigan’s 60th District\nEducation: Masters Degree from Michigan State University\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI grew up in a family business so I realize what they go through. I also realize small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy and community and I will always support business.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 60 seat?\nI am running because I want to work together with community leaders, elected officials and business to deliver results for Macomb County and our local community. I grew up in Macomb County and serving the great people of Macomb County had been an honor for me and I look forward to continuing to serve.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Fixing our local roads and bridges\n- Provide lasting tax relief for all Michigan families\n- Keep our schools and neighborhoods safe\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nDid not answer.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nDid not answer.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nDid not answer.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nDid not answer.\nEditor’s note: Republican incumbent candidate Joseph Aragona does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nState Representative – 61st District\nJump to candidate\nName: Denise Mentzer\nAge: Why?\nCurrent job: State Representative House District 61\nEducation: Bachelor of Business summa cum laude\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI graduated from the Academy of Small Business Consultants in April 2011 while working for Macomb County Planning and Economic Development. I was a small business consultant for the Michigan Small Business Technology and Development Center, MI-SBTDC. This was a program run by the Small Business Administration.\nAfter being elected to the House, I retired from the county of Macomb as the Senior Buyer. Some of the Departments I serviced regularly were the Sheriff Department, Information Technology, Macomb County Animal Control, and Emergency Management. Overall, I served 25 years with the county. I was an AFSCME 411 steward for 19 years and vice president for four. After receiving a promotion, I became a member of UAW 889.\nBeginning in 2013, I was elected as a Mount Clemens City Commissioner, winning election for the third time in November 2021. One of the policies I am most proud of is my sponsorship of a local preference purchasing policy, which was adopted unanimously. I also brought forth a policy that Quarterly Department Head reports should be presented to the public. They are now available online. I participated in reviewing and approving nine balanced municipal budgets.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 61 seat?\nI’m an incumbent. I want to finish what I started. There are more labor bills to pass like non-competes and bargained staffing levels for police and fire. I want some language on removing microplastics from our water infrastructure. I’m working on a bill to forgive long term medical debt. I am following up my House Bill 5182 that creates specific penalties for auto thefts using ProPads, by creating a licensing requirement for law enforcement, tow truck drivers, auto dealers and lock smiths. The Governor signed HB 5182 into law as Public Act 92.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Water infrastructure. I have advocated for, and voted for, bills that will fund local water infrastructure systems and replace residential lead pipes. Clean, safe drinking water is imperative in our communities. I have supported and voted for septic system oversight and inspection reforms. I have worked with Sierra Club on bills to reduce and eliminate microplastics in our waterways.\n- Health care and drug prices. I am a supporter of a Prescription Drug Affordability Board that will evaluate prices and recommend ways to lower costs. Health Care affordability is a huge concern. That’s why I believe the ACA needs to grow and why we need to eliminate the middlemen like pharmacy benefit managers and big pharmacy companies.\n- Public safety. I come from a long line of law enforcement. My father joined the Macomb County Sheriff Department in 1959. My brother is a detective in the MACE unit. Between them my family has served law enforcement in Macomb County for over 65 years. I have five other relatives who currently serve in law\nenforcement. I was able to secure $2 million for the Public Safety Institute at Macomb Community College to upgrade the training facility for Police, Fire and EMS. I voted for the 2025 budget that includes $5 million to establish Training, Recruitment and Retention Grants for local law enforcement agencies. Every police agency, every fire department and every EMS company is looking for hires. This grant will help.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI am proud to have supported the gun reforms passed in Michigan last year. Just yesterday a 2 ½ year old shot himself in the stomach with an unsecured handgun. The safe storage laws we passed will help prevent this type of tragedy as the law is vigorously enforced. I believe background checks are vital to gun ownership. A background check will ensure that criminals cannot purchase guns and will not impact a law-abiding citizen. Personally, I have a CPL and I have handguns. I completed training through a licensed agency, I practice safe storage and I submitted all required paperwork to the local police department.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nThe decision to have an abortion is between the woman, her partner, her doctor and perhaps her clergy. No one else should have a say. This should not be a political issue. It is a personal one.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nThe average net corporate profit margin across the United States is over 7 % according to NYU. This is partly due to corporations inflating prices beyond their cost input to generate bigger income. JP Morgan predicts there will not be a recession in 2024, that prices will continue to rise, but at a slower pace. There is some concern over 2025. Some prices increased because of supply chain issues. One method that will work is for banks to charge higher interest rates. Banks won’t borrow money and consumers will save more and spend less.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI generally don’t pay much attention to my challengers. I don’t want to talk about them, nor give them any attention. But look at their experience, their backgrounds. One of my challengers hasn’t lived on his own yet. That means he’s never paid an electricity bill, a gas bill, a mortgage payment, or home owners’ insurance. How will he comprehend and dissect an $83 billion dollar annual budget?\nEditor’s note: Democratic incumbent candidate Denise Mentzer does not have a contested race in the August primary.\nName: Russ Cleary\nAge: 23\nCurrent job: Caseworker with the Office of Congressman John James (MI-10)\nEducation: Graduate of Paul K. Cousino High School; Bachelor’s degree from Michigan State University (Political Science)\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI have been a Macomb County resident my entire life, growing up in a union family that instilled in me the values of hard work and dedication to community service. My passion for serving people has been a driving force throughout my career. With my experience in serving people, I have gained a deep understanding of how to effectively contribute the needs of our community and I want to bring this experience to the state House to serve you.\nI believe that our region deserves better representation in Lansing — representation that truly listens to and addresses the concerns of our residents. My commitment to working hard and advocating for our community’s best interests is unwavering. I am dedicated to ensuring that Macomb County remains a place where young families can thrive, small businesses businesses can grow, and our values are upheld.\nBy bringing my experience, dedication, and passion for service to Lansing, I aim to be the voice that Macomb County deserves. Let’s work together to create a better future for all.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 61 seat?\nI am running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 61 seat because I believe in providing better representation for our area in Lansing. The residents of Macomb County work too hard to see failure by their representatives. Our community deserves leaders who are committed to reducing crime, bringing down the cost of living, and making it easier to buy a home. We need to address the rising costs of gas and groceries, ensuring that our residents can provide for their families without undue financial strain.\nI am dedicated to focusing on the needs of our community and advocating for policies that will improve the quality of life for everyone in District 61. It’s time for leadership that truly understands and prioritizes the concerns of Macomb County residents. They deserve nothing less.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n- Education reform. Education is the cornerstone of a prosperous society, and as a state representative, my primary focus will be on expanding all educational options for students. We need to support traditional public schools, charter schools, private schools, homeschooling, and online learning platforms to ensure every child has access to the best educational opportunities. Parental freedom is paramount; parents should have the right to choose the educational path that best suits their child’s needs without undue interference from the government. I will advocate for increased funding for trade schools, community colleges, and vocational programs to provide practical and valuable skills for students who prefer a non-traditional route. By broadening educational choices and empowering parents, we can create a more adaptable and effective education system that meets the diverse needs of our students.\n- Supporting law enforcement and first responders. Ensuring the safety and security of our communities is a fundamental responsibility of government. As a state representative, I will champion policies that provide our law enforcement officers and first responders with the resources, training, and support they need to perform their duties effectively and safely. This includes advocating for competitive salaries, comprehensive benefits, and modern equipment. Supporting those who put their lives on the line for our safety is not just a priority — it’s a duty.\n- Bringing down the cost of living. High housing costs and rising expenses are significant challenges for Michigan residents. To address this, I will work to streamline regulations and reduce bureaucratic red tape that hinders housing development and drives up costs. Promoting policies that encourage the construction of affordable housing units will help increase supply and bring down prices. Additionally, I will advocate for tax relief for working families and small businesses to ease the financial burden. By cutting unnecessary regulations and promoting a business-friendly environment, we can stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and ensure that Michigan remains an attractive and affordable place to live and work. Supporting initiatives that lower energy costs and improve infrastructure will also be key components of my strategy to reduce the overall cost of living for Michigan residents.\nBy focusing on education reform, supporting our law enforcement and first responders, and reducing the cost of living, we can create a stronger, safer, and more prosperous Michigan for all. We need to make Michigan a destination state, not a departure state.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI am a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment and believe deeply in every American’s right to bear arms. The ability to defend oneself, one’s family, and one’s property is a fundamental freedom that must be preserved. The real issue isn’t with guns themselves but with those who misuse them to harm others.\nTo tackle gun violence effectively, we need to address the root causes, not infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens. Mental health is a significant part of this conversation. Many individuals who commit acts of violence suffer from untreated or poorly managed mental health conditions. By improving mental health services, providing better access to care, and reducing the stigma around seeking help, we can prevent potential threats from escalating into tragedies.\nWe also need to ensure our communities have the resources to identify and support individuals in crisis. This means more funding for mental health professionals, crisis intervention programs, and community outreach. By focusing on prevention and early intervention, we can reduce violence without compromising the rights of responsible gun owners.\nAs your representative, I will always advocate for measures that protect our constitutional rights while promoting safety and well-being in our communities. Supporting the Second Amendment and addressing gun violence through mental health initiatives go hand in hand in creating a safer, more secure America.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI believe in fostering a culture of life, where families can easily live, work, and raise children in a supportive and thriving environment. While I am emphatically pro-life and committed to protecting the unborn, I also recognize the profound challenges and emotions that come with an unplanned pregnancy. It’s an overwhelming and deeply personal situation.\nTo truly support women facing these circumstances, we need to focus on comprehensive support systems. This includes better access to prenatal care, ensuring that expecting mothers receive the medical attention they need. Additionally, we must invest in early childhood education and other resources that help families provide a strong start for their children.\nBy creating a state where families feel supported and have the resources they need, we can build a community that values life at all stages. It’s about compassion and ensuring that women have the support they need to make informed and empowered decisions. As your representative, I am dedicated to promoting policies that uphold these values and provide the necessary support for all families.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nFirst, we need to get government spending under control. Excessive spending fuels inflation, and we must prioritize a balanced budget. By reducing wasteful expenditures and focusing on essential services, we can help stabilize the economy.\nSecond, we should cut unnecessary regulations that stifle businesses and drive up costs. Regulatory reform can reduce the burden on small businesses and entrepreneurs, allowing them to thrive and create jobs. This will help increase supply and drive down prices, benefiting consumers across the board.\nFinally, promoting economic growth is key. We need to support policies that encourage investment, innovation, and job creation. This includes lowering taxes for individuals and businesses, investing in infrastructure, and supporting local industries, especially here in Michigan. By fostering a pro-growth environment, we can boost productivity and help mitigate the effects of inflation.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI disagree with several key decisions made by my opponent. First, they supported HB 4160, which would allow violent criminals to be released from jail after just 10 years — a move that prosecutors across the state have strongly opposed. They also voted for an inflated and enormous budget, which contributes to unnecessary debt and increased costs for Michiganders. Additionally, they voted to remove funding for Selfridge, which negatively impacts our local economy and national security.\nIn contrast, I would focus on policies that protect Michigan families and reduce crime. I would work to create a more fiscally responsible budget to avoid debt and reduce costs for our citizens. Furthermore, I would advocate for businesses to ensure that Michigan becomes a destination state, not a departure state.\nName: John Grossenbacher\nAge: 43\nCurrent job: Full time candidate, but also owner of IT consultant company\nEducation: Two Associate’s degrees\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nI have lived in my current home in Macomb for almost eight years, but I’ve been in the metro area my whole life. I hold two associate degrees and have extensive experience in IT, having worked as a consultant for over a decade. Two years ago, I started my own private IT consulting firm. My career has also included time in manufacturing as a machinist and programmer, as well as supporting multiple industries in my IT roles.\nI have no prior political experience, but I have led committees for nonprofits, demonstrating my commitment to community service and leadership. My involvement with ROC Michigan, a nonprofit serving restaurant workers, highlights my dedication to advocating for workers’ rights.\nI am a Christian, husband, father, and business owner. My problem-solving skills and dedication to serving others have earned me a reputation as a reliable advocate for the community.\nI believe in protecting parental rights in education, ensuring fiscal responsibility, and reducing the influence of PACs in elections. Additionally, I am committed to combating fentanyl and human trafficking. I am dedicated to representing regular people, not career politicians, and bringing real-life experience and perspective to governance.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 61 seat?\nI am running for many reasons. Lansing and the government, in general, are out of control and out of touch. They spend our money like it’s an unlimited fund when they should be tightening their belts like we have to. I am also concerned about the future of our children. Parental rights are under attack, trafficking and fentanyl are at an all-time high, yet our state funds things like $137 million to educate students on the Great Lakes, all while raiding teachers’ pensions.\nOut-of-control spending, attacking parental rights, lack of accountability, and now they want GPS-enabled use tax devices on all cars. Someone has to stand up for us, and it has to be one of us, not one of them.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions\nwould you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\n1. Addressing economic hardships. Michigan’s residents are facing significant economic challenges. To alleviate this financial strain, I propose a comprehensive strategy:\n- Oppose gas and road usage taxes: I will firmly oppose the proposed gas and road usage taxes advocated by the Democratic Party. These taxes disproportionately affect working families and individuals who rely on affordable transportation.\n- Transition to a part-time legislative system: Advocating for a part-time legislative system can reduce government spending and redirect funds to more critical areas, such as education and infrastructure.\n- Reduce property and business taxes: By pushing for initiatives that lower property and business taxes, we can lessen the fiscal burden on taxpayers, fostering a more business-friendly environment that encourages growth and investment.\nImplementing these measures will help to alleviate economic hardships and support the financial well-being of our community members.\n2. Strengthening law enforcement to combat crises. Michigan faces multiple crises, including the fentanyl epidemic and human trafficking, exacerbated by our status as a border state. To address these issues:\n- Bolster law enforcement egencies: Enhance support for our law enforcement agencies by providing them with the necessary resources and training to effectively combat illegal immigration, drug proliferation, and trafficking activities.\n- Prioritize border security: Focus on initiatives that strengthen our borders to prevent the influx of illegal substances and human trafficking, ensuring the safety and security of our communities.\n- Support constitutional principles: Uphold constitutional rights by opposing non-constitutional red flag laws and ensuring fair election processes. This means safeguarding individual freedoms while allowing legitimate election challenges to ensure a transparent and equitable democratic process.\nBy prioritizing these actions, we can effectively address the crises facing Michigan and safeguard our communities.\n3. Empowering Michigan parents in education\nEmpowering Michigan parents to choose the best education for their children is crucial. To achieve this:\n- Support parental choice: Advocate for legislation that ensures Michigan parents can select the education setting that best suits their child’s needs — whether public, charter, home, or private school. Ensure that funding follows the student to provide equitable resources across all types of schools.\n- Protect parental rights: Introduce and support policies that protect parental rights in education, including opposing any legislation that infringes on homeschooling rights or imposes sensitive adult topics, such as transgender issues, on young students without parental consent.\n- Enhance educational funding: Work to ensure adequate and fair funding for quality education across all school settings, while also protecting teachers’ pensions, which are currently under attack by Democrats. This approach will ensure resources meet educational needs and secure the financial stability of our educators.\nBy implementing these measures, we can empower parents, enhance educational outcomes, and safeguard both family values and the interests of our teachers in Michigan.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI support a balanced approach to gun reform. I believe in implementing background checks to ensure that individuals with mental illness or a history of violent offenses do not have access to firearms. However, I also strongly support the right of individuals to carry guns for self-defense and to exercise their Second Amendment rights. It is crucial to protect this right, which is under constant attack. In situations where immediate action is necessary, such as a potential threat, I prefer to hear that multiple responsible individuals intervened to neutralize the threat rather than waiting for an extended period while the gunman reloads multiple times. For example a recent splash pad shooting in Rochester Hills.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI am pro-life, but I recognize that abortion protection is already established in state law. Changes to existing laws should be approached with careful consideration of details. I support abortion in cases where the mother’s life is at risk or when fetal viability is extremely low.\nAs a devout Christian, I generally oppose abortion, but I believe that decisions about abortion should involve medical professionals and the individuals directly affected, rather than being solely dictated by government. I would support legislation that sets limits on abortion based on gestational age, with exceptions for late-term abortions when the mother’s health is at risk or there are significant viability concerns.\nFor early-term abortions, while I am unsure about the feasibility of specific legislative limits, I advocate for mandatory counseling, including exploring alternatives such as adoption and assistance, with thorough consultation before approval by a doctor.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nTo address the inflation crisis on a state level, we need to take several key actions:\n- Tax relief: Provide tax relief to alleviate the financial burden on residents, particularly the middle class, which is at risk of disappearing due to inflation outpacing wage growth.\n- Budget control: Immediately take steps to control the state budget and reduce unnecessary spending. Implementing a part-time legislative system and cutting state property taxes are initial steps toward fiscal responsibility.\n- Support business growth: Promote economic development by offering tax incentives similar to the film industry tax breaks from 2008-2015. Expand these incentives to multiple industries to attract businesses and talent to Michigan, fostering job creation and economic stability. We do have stuff in the pipeline now, but its not enough.\nBy implementing these measures, we can help stabilize costs, support businesses, and provide relief to Michigan residents amid the ongoing inflation crisis.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nWhile my challengers and I share some views, there are significant differences in our approaches:\nRobert: I disagree with Robert’s focus on adhering to political establishment norms rather than advocating for the people. His approach seems more aligned with maintaining the status quo and the old boys’ club, whereas I am committed to challenging the system and prioritizing the needs of the people. I believe in fighting tenaciously for real change, not just following political bylines.\nRuss: My concerns with Russ stem from his limited life experience and heavy reliance on PAC endorsements. At 23, living with his parents and having primarily worked with politicians, his perspective on legislative issues is less grounded in real-world experience compared to mine as a father, husband, and business owner. I am wary that his strong connections with PACs might make him more beholden to them rather than the constituents. While I respect his ambition, I believe that life experience is crucial for effective legislation. I intend to approach this role as a job of service, not a stepping stone to a political career. I will work directly for the people, reject PAC influence, and encourage more ordinary individuals to run for office, showing that it’s possible to make a difference without being part of the political establishment.\nIn contrast to my opponents, who may focus on political strategies and PAC support, I am committed to shaking up the government and ensuring it truly serves the people.\nName: Robert Wojtowicz\nAge: 62\nCurrent job: Self employed\nEducation: High school, college/trade school and much additional classes, courses and degrees\nTell us about yourself in 200 words or less.\nRobert Wojtowicz is a devoted father, a successful small business owner and a life-long Macomb County resident. Starting out doing basic manual labor jobs, then blue collar, management and ultimately developing a successful small business. Being totally active in his children’s life Robert has generously volunteered his time as a parent volunteer and PTO member. He has been the go-to person with non-administrative school activities, field trips, class events and even taking the position of PTO president. When education needed help, they would call Robert.\nRobert has held a position on the Clinton Township Gratiot Cruise committee, has been appointed to the Clinton Township Building Authority and has been elected to and currently serves on the Chippewa Valley School Board since 2020.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 61 seat?\nI love Michigan and our country. I see many concerns and want to be a part of the solution. I promise to put my own interests aside and will be a voice for the people who elect me into office fighting to make Michiganders lives safer and more affordable.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nAffordability and transparency; lower/eliminate taxes; and bring jobs back to Michigan.\nOur schools are a mess, our test scores are unacceptably low and it’s hurting our children. We need to get back to educating and teaching reading, writing and math.\nIllegal immigration and outside influence. We need to hold people responsible and stop giving away our great state to outside countries. We need to get back to a manageable and reasonable amount of immigration, without the overwhelming amount of crime.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nWe need to get back to the Constitution and it being top law.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI am pro-life but we need to bring the father back into the picture and provide an overwhelming amount of support to unwanted pregnancies to the point that nobody will feel this is something they have to go through alone. Provide love.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nBring jobs and manufacturing back to America, stop paying other countries and entities outrageous amounts of money and become self sufficient as we once were heading to.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI will not run a negative campaign but we need to stop pushing agenda items and get back to putting the American people first and our great country first.\nState Representative – 62nd District\nJump to candidate\nName: Michelle Levine-Woodman\nMichelle Levine-Woodman did not respond to WDET’s questionnaire request.

I live with my wonderful wife, Gabby, in Oxford Township. I have been serving our community for approximately two years now. I am a Board Certified Behavioral Analyst who works with children with autism. My wife operates soccer camps to help teach special needs students real-life skills. My wife is a semi-professional soccer athlete who was named National Goalie of the Year. It has truly been an honor to serve the wonderful people of this state and I look forward to the opportunity to continue to do so.\nWhy are you running for the Michigan House of Representatives District 66 seat?\nI am running because there is a lot of work that needs to be done to turn this state around. At one point, Michigan had 19 Congressional seats. Now, we only have 13. Compared to fast-growing states like Florida, Tennessee and Texas, our state is floundering. It’s time to reduce red tape, lower the cost of living, protect parental rights, and make Michigan an attractive place to raise a family.\nWhat are the top three priority issues that the state of Michigan faces and what actions would you, as a state representative, take regarding each of them?\nOur state has approximately 91,000 illegal immigrants living here, nearly enough to fill up the Big House. They’re demanding social security numbers, driver’s licenses, food stamps, unemployment benefits, and other things. As a legislator, I want to address this by requiring law enforcement to identify, detain and deport them. Illegal immigration drains government budgets and diverts critical public funds needed for our roads, police, fire, and other critical services.\nThe cost of living is going up. Groceries, gas, mortgages, food and cars are all a lot more expensive. We need to lower the overall tax burden to help attract more residents. I support lowering the personal income tax rate from 4.25% to 3.9%, enacting energy choice legislation to improve grid reliability, preventing the state from having authority over local governments and eliminating unnecessary fees for state services.\nAnother issue is out of control government spending. The state budget has increased from $59 billion to $82.5 billion in just five years. That’s much higher than the rate of inflation. We need to eliminate non-essential programs and cut fraud, waste and abuse in the state budget so more of our roads can get fixed without raising taxes.\nWhat is your stance on gun reform in the U.S.?\nI don’t believe more gun laws will help address the root causes of gun violence. Many times, active shooters experience significant mental health challenges that go unaddressed weeks or even months before lives are lost. That’s what happened at Oxford High School. In addition, school professionals need to be trained properly on how to recognize the early warning signs of a credible threat and learn proper strategies to de-escalate the situation. We need to ensure adequate funding exists for school resource officers. I support legislation to hold school employees accountable if they fail to follow proper school safety protocols.\nWhat is your stance on abortion rights?\nI believe human life is sacred. Most scientists agree that human life begins at the moment of conception. I believe in giving babies inside the mother’s womb a chance to live through programs to support mothers in difficult situations. For example, increased investments in pregnancy centers can help. We also need to enact pro-family policies to incentivize childbirth and make it more affordable to raise a family here in Michigan.\nWhat is your solution to fight the current inflation crisis in the U.S.?\nOne of the biggest reasons why inflation is out of control is because of excessive government spending. Michigan currently has tens of billions of dollars in unfunded pension liabilities. Lansing needs to work toward paying those down. In addition, we need to drastically reduce the size and scope of our state government, so it operates within the confines of the U.S. Constitution.\nWhat actions/decisions by your challenger(s) have you disagreed with and how would you do things differently?\nI’m not afraid to tackle difficult challenges. I’ve learned that stopping bad bills requires a tremendous amount of courage. I helped stop bills to allow the Secretary of State to issue driver’s licenses to illegal aliens. I helped stop legislation last fall to force taxpayers to fund Planned Parenthood. I believe elected leaders must push back against legislation that goes against our Constitution. My opponent may be a nice guy, but he’s scared to do the work that must be done to stop government overreach. We don’t need any more weak Republicans in Lansing — we need strong leaders with a backbone, and that’s exactly what I bring to the table.\nTrusted, accurate, up-to-date.\nWDET strives to make our journalism accessible to everyone.
