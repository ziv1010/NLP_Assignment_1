  "body_text": "Everything New on Netflix in June 2024\nOne of the most critically acclaimed movies of the summer isn’t in theaters; it’s on Netflix.\n(Actually Netflix is putting this movie in theaters for a week or two, which is a change for them. But mostly people will see it it on Netflix.)\nIt’s Hit Man, directed by Richard Linklater and starring Glen Powell as a man who pretends to be a hit man and falls for a potential client. The film got great reviews at last fall’s festivals and was acquired for release on Netflix.\nThat’s just one title out of dozens of new ones that you can watch on Netflix in June. There are new episodes of the That ’70s Show revival, That ’90s Show, there’s the final season of the DC TV series Sweet Tooth and a new season of the reality series The Mole, and there’s a Jessica Alba action movie called Trigger Warning. Ooh and there’s also something called Under Paris which is described by Netflix as a movie about a scientist who “comes to know that a large shark is swimming deep in the river.” Sooooo it’s a Jaws in Paris? I’m so in.\nHere’s the full list of everything that is coming to Netflix in June 2024.\nAvail. 6/1/24\nToo Old for Fairy Tales 2 -- NETFLIX FAMILY\nAfter his mother's new boyfriend moves in, Waldek embarks on a daring journey through the Tatra mountains to find the father he's never met.\n1917\n30 for 30: Once Brothers\nA Million Ways to Die in the West\nAli\nBaby Boy\nBig Fat Liar\nThe Breakfast Club\nBurn After Reading\nThe Conjuring\nThe Conjuring 2\nThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It\nThe Devil's Own\nDivergent\nThe Divergent Series: Allegiant - Part 1\nThe Divergent Series: Insurgent\nDune (1984)\nHeartland: Season 16\nHome\nKicking & Screaming\nLa La Land\nLand of the Lost\nThe Lego Movie\nNational Security\nOn the Basis of Sex\nPokémon Detective Pikachu\nS.W.A.T.\nSimon\nStrawberry Shortcake’s Summer Vacation\nTangerine\nTwo Can Play That Game\nAvail. 6/3/24\n30 for 30: Lance\n30 for 30: The Good, The Bad, The Hungry\n30 for 30: The Life and Trials of Oscar Pistorius\nLittle Baby Bum: Music Time: Season 2 -- NETFLIX FAMILY\nClass is back in session at the magical Music Time preschool, where friends Mia, Max, Maple, Ahan and Bari are learning more than ever before!\nHow I Met Your Mother: Seasons 1-9\nREAD MORE: Happy Gilmore 2 Is Officially Happening at Netflix\nAvail. 6/4/24\nJo Koy: Live from Brooklyn -- NETFLIX COMEDY SPECIAL\nBrooklyn are you ready?!
