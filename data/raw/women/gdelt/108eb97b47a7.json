The last time that happened through four weeks? The SEC in 2012.\nBut look what has happened to start 2023: The ACC has six undefeated teams, tied with the 2012 SEC for the most teams in a Power 5 conference to start 4-0 in a single season in the AP Poll era (since 1936).\nNorth Carolina is 4-0 for the first time since 1997, with two nonconference wins over Power 5 opponents. What may be most surprising of all, though, is who else is undefeated, too.\nWith Clemson off to a 2-2 start, the hot ACC teams have made the Tigers’ seeming elimination from playoff contention almost feel like an afterthought.
