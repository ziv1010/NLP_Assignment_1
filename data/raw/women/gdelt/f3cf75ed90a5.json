Despite a late onslaught from the hosts in Gothenburg, Sarina Wiegman's side just about hung on to secure a much-needed point.\nEngland could have topped the group as Ireland secured a shock 3-1 win over France in the other group game. However, the goalless draw means they finished second in the standings and a point behind winners France.\nHow the game unfolded\nEngland's best chance in the opening stages of the game fell to Alessia Russo. Georgia Stanway's run down the right was picked out and she whipped a dangerous cross into the box, but the Arsenal forward wasn't able to get a strong enough connection to poke it beyond Zecira Musovic.\nSweden held their shape well, but England were composed on the ball and kept possession well. Stanway had a solid effort on goal last in the first half, but her effort from range flew narrowly wide of the post.\nThe hosts' best chance of the first 45 minutes fell to Hanna Lundkvist. Millie Bright cleared a Sweden free kick and it fell to the defender outside of the box, but her attempt was high and wide.\nSweden started the second half the better side as they registered the game's first attempt on target on 50 minutes. Filippa Angeldal got a shot away and Hannah Hampton got down well to punch it away.\nEngland were fortunate not to concede a penalty with 20 minutes left to play as Leah Williamson slid into a challenge on Rosa Kafaji in the box. The Sweden striker managed to stay on her feet and see it out for a corner, but the referee would no doubt have blown her whistle and pointed to the spot had she gone down.\nSweden kept pushing, but England's experience holding on to a result proved to be enough on the night as they saw out a very nervy final 15 minutes.\nEngland player ratings (4-3-3)\nGK: Hannah Hampton - 6/10 - A big night for the goalkeeper as she got the nod ahead of Mary Earps in a must-not-lose game. Crucial save early in the second half to deny Angeldahl. Less convincing as things became more nervy for England in the second half.\nRB: Lucy Bronze - 7/10 - Registered England's first attempt on target in the second half with a strong headed effort from a free kick. Caught too far forward at times in the second half, but made some crucial clearances.\nCB: Leah Williamson - 7/10 - Made some crucial clearances and interceptions when Sweden looked to break in the first half. Intelligent defending and picked the right moments to push forward. Fortunate not to concede a penalty late in the second half.\nCB: Millie Bright - 7/10 - Won her aerial duels and kept Sweden reasonably quiet alongside Williamson. Sloppy in the second half as England's dominance wained.\nLB: Jess Carter - 6/10 - Caught in possession once or twice in the first half, but Williamson did well to mop up any danger. Looked the weak link in England's defence at times as she faced a tough opponent in her Chelsea teammate Johanna Rytting Kaneryd.\nCM: Keira Walsh - 7/10 - Quick, intricate passing through midfield that carved out some decent openings in the first half. Struggled to dictate the play in the second half as Sweden pushed for a winner.\nCM: Georgia Stanway - 7/10 - Dangerous cross into the box for what was England's best opening of the first 20 minutes. Solid effort on goal late in the first half but she narrowly missed the target.\nCM: Ella Toone - 6/10 - Burst into space down the left early doors but her cut-back into the box was cleared. Involved in some well-worked England attacks but the final pass wasn't quite there.\nRW: Lauren Hemp - 7/10 - Dispossessed in the first half which allowed Sweden to counter quickly, but Williamson was there to mop up the danger. Kept pushing but struggled to get back into the game in the second half.\nST: Alessia Russo - 7/10 - Provided the link for a lot of England attacks in the first half with some clever touches and balls through to her teammates. Used her strength so well with her hold up play and always looked to make runs in behind.\nLW: Beth Mead - 6/10 - A couple of loose touches in the opening 10 minutes. Decent set-piece delivery, but Sweden defended those situations extremely well. Subbed.\nSubstitutes\nSUB: Chloe Kelly (73' for Beth Mead) - 6/10\nSUB: Niamh Charles (89' for Lauren Hemp) - N/A\nSUB: Fran Kirby (90' for Ella Toone) - N/A\nSubs not used: Mary Earps (GK), Khiara Keating (GK), Alex Greenwood, Maya Le Tissier, Grace Clinton, Aggie Beever-Jones, Jess Park, Jess Park, Millie Turner\nManager\nSarina Wiegman - 6/10 - Initial team selection spot on, but didn't respond quick enough to Sweden's changes. Sweden played with greater energy in the second half and England failed to match it as they clung on for the draw.",
