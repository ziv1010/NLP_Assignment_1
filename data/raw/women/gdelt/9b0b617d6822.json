The CBD was completely locked down – giving everyone the absolute irrits – and The Chaser’s War On Everything crew decided to puncture the pomposity of the whole bloody thing.\nIn a black limo with tinted windows, they had Chas Licciardello dressed as Osama bin Laden on the back seat and Julian Morrow as a bodyguard.\nHow to crack the heavy security?\nWhy not put a fluttering Canadian flag on the bonnet and drive slowly down Macquarie Street to the barricades with armed security, with Morrow jogging alongside, wearing dark glasses and his hand on an earpiece in his right ear, looking important and appearing to be talking into his high-tech wristwatch.\nNo problem. “Osama” was waved through to the very door of the US president’s hotel!\nThis was nominally a “crime”, causing some furious finger-waving at the Chaser, but mostly it set Australia rocking with howling laughter.\nFor, mostly, it was ... fun!\nWhich brings me to serial English prankster Daniel Jarvis, who before last week’s Australia v England league Test wandered onto the turf in Liverpool in a Kangaroos jersey and – fabulously – took his place in the line-up alongside Cameron Munster, and got through the whole anthem before being nabbed. Munster thought he was “Kevvie’s cousin”.\nGenius, I tell you.\nLong after the result of the match is forgotten – I think the Kangaroos won, but you’ll have to check – we’ll remember, and laugh about the Jarvis prank.\nAs Iain Payten has pointed out, Jarvis has fabulous form, right up to the point of dressing in whites and managing to bowl a ball in an India-England Test at The Oval that John Howard himself might have laughed at.\nAt the closing ceremony of the Paris Olympics, he disguised himself as an English athlete and got a selfie with French President Emmanuel Macron.\nAt the FINA World Diving Series in London in 2015, he managed to evade security in his speedos and goggles and pull off an absolutely superb belly flop.\nBest of all, a couple of years ago, self-titled “prank star” Jarvis hid an old mobile phone on the set of the BBC’s Match of the Day. During coverage of the Wolves v Liverpool FA Cup clash Jarvis remotely activated it live on air as Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer introduced the show, the airwaves suddenly filling with moans from a sex tape. Lineker tried to keep it together, and nearly managed it. The BBC was furious, apologised and went after the culprit.\nYes, nominally a crime, or something, but ... fun.\nWe all love sport. But, let’s face it, on a bad day it can get a bit up itself with its own deadly earnest sense of self-importance. Sport needs the Daniel Jarviii of this world to occasionally jump the boundary fences, puncture the pomposity and race off again. They do no harm, and if you need a more cogent reason than laughter and pomposity-puncturing, they help spot gaps in security systems and overall keep the athletes safer.\nBravo, Mr Jarvis.\nKatoa head knocks could prove catastrophic\nOn the other end of the scale, however – as in, a matter of extreme gravity – is what happened to Melbourne Storm player Eli Katoa on Sunday while playing for Tonga.\nFirst, he was seemingly concussed in the warm-up. He was then concussed twice more during the match, before collapsing and being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery. To you and me it looked bad. To CTE expert Dr Rowena Mobbs, of Macquarie University, it was truly shocking.\n“The three brain impacts Katoa suffered,” she told me, “tallied up to far worse than a concussion. To require neurosurgery for brain bleeding or swelling, and to now face the potential of lifelong impairment, is big, and classified as moderate to severe brain injury. Any further injury could be catastrophic. But it will be up to his team to consider in the months ahead his future.”\nIndeed. That will be right after his team, and rugby league, get to grips with how such a thing could happen in 2025, given all the protocols in place to prevent exactly this kind of thing happening. Serious questions will have to be asked, and the legal implications could be huge if Katoa’s career ends now. Prima facie, after emergency brain surgery, and the risks he faces with more concussions, you’d have to think that’s a good idea.\nBut do go on, good doctor.\n“These issues have been debated for decades,” Dr Mobbs said. “Rugby league is an international sport, so all efforts should go into a formal review of international as well as national protocols to ensure safer practices in warm-up, training and competition. Anyone responsible for player wellbeing, or in fact spectators and commentators of the game, should be alert to the red flag signs of serious brain injury, be it seizure, falling consciousness, vomiting or agitation.\n“In my opinion, neurologists should be on the sideline at the top echelons of these risky sports. Brain health matters!”\nHigh ball woes a worry for Wallabies\nThe Wallabies at Twickenham?\nThey had their moments. Harry Potter and Fraser McReight were imperial, while Max Jorgensen had one moment of sheer genius that just missed.\nThe main problem though was the kicks. When they took our high kicks, we had very little pressure on them. When we took theirs, our blokes faced a thundering herd of white jerseys and all too often the ball came back their way.\nAnd I still have no clue on kick-offs. Why we continue to have it land, so often, near their 22 – far enough away that the forwards can’t hammer the receiver, but close enough that it can be reefed far downfield from behind the 22. Seriously, it is the spot to receive the ball from, and we keep kicking it there!\nIn the same game last year, Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii revealed himself as world class in tapping balls back from kick-offs. What happened to that? We now try it occasionally? But in the words of Tim Horan from long ago, on another matter: “It is like buying a Ferrari, putting it in the garage and catching the bus.”\nThe whole performance was not one to put in the champagne rugby bottle and say this was the best of the 2025 vintage. While fizzy in parts, with a sometimes promising bouquet, it was just a bit flat overall.\nOnwards to Italy tonight. It won’t be a gimme. They have regularly beaten Wales and Scotland in recent times and come very close to beating Ireland, England and France.\nWhat they said\nCricket selector George Bailey generates another headline as he discusses Sam Konstas: “At the moment, if he farts, it’s a headline.”\nTennis player Danielle Collins is looking for a bloke: “I’ll tell you what … if anyone has the balls to slide into my DM like this just make sure to attach your most recent bank statement while you’re at it.”\nFormer England cricket captain Michael Vaughan: “I’m not too sure the Aussie public love the Aussie team. They don’t seem to have that kind of connection. You go back many years, when they were right behind them ... this team has had so much success, but there seems to be a connection that’s not quite together with fans.” I’d say not as much as 1975, but more than 2015?\nLaura Harvey, the head coach at National Women’s Soccer League club Seattle Reign, said she asked the AI chatbot questions about strategy and tactics, then implemented what it advised: “And then I put in, ‘What formation should you play to beat NWSL teams?’ and it spurted out every team in the league and what formation you should play. And for two teams, it went, ‘You should play a back five’. So I did. No joke, that’s why I did it.”\nPat Cummins gives a fair indication of the horrendous state of nicknames in the Australian cricket team: “Like you look at someone like Starcy [Mitchell Starc], he’s into his mid-30s, and he doesn’t look like he’s going to finish soon. So I think nowadays, the way we manage fast bowlers, the way people like Starcy and Joshy [Josh Hazlewood] look after themselves and Scotty Boland, you can have a long career.”\nFrench tennis player Oceane Dodin on getting a boob job: “It’s just boobs, it’s nothing. So I was like, maybe people are going to talk about it because it’s new and because it’s unusual, but not that much. Of course, [they’re] big, but it’s not like I can’t play, you know? And there are some tennis players who have bigger boobs than me and they’re still playing. Just mine are fake, that’s it.”\nRabbitohs coach Wayne Bennett warning the Perth Bears as he talks about his Dolphins days: “The managers want to give you all their shit players. If they can’t get the job done where they were, they can’t get the job done with you. All of a sudden you could have five or six players on your list that are of no value to you because you overreacted and panicked and threw money at something you shouldn’t be throwing money at.”\nCam Munster on internet prankster Daniel Jarvis successfully making his way into the Kangaroos line-up for the national anthems, and putting his arm around him: “Some guy tried to get in between me and [Pat Carrigan] and I said, ‘Nah’. Then he asked me again, ‘Can I stand next to you and hold you?’ I said, ‘Righto mate, do what you need to do’. Then I realised who it was. It was the guy who does that stuff on the regular. It took me a while to click on, but it was pretty funny. He got me.”\nMunster: “He tried talking to me, but I didn’t give him a whole heap because no one tipped me up that it was going to happen. It was a bit weird, but I just went with it. He got me an absolute ripper.”\nToronto Blue Jays pitcher Jeff Hoffman after they lost game seven of the world series: “It sucks. Supposed to end differently. Was just one pitch. I cost everybody here a world series ring. It feels pretty shitty.”\nTeam of the week\nVitor Pereira. Sacked as Wolves manager. Get Ange on the blower. He’ll answer on the first ring, and likely do a great job.\nOscar Piastri. The rubber needs to hit the road for him at this weekend’s Brazil GP.\nAustralia and NZ. Contesting Sunday’s women’s rugby league Pacific Championships final.\nWallabies. Take on Italy on Saturday night (AEDT) in Udine.\nKangaroos. Looking for the clean sweep against England.\nLA Dodgers. Not only came back in game seven, they won games six and seven on the road to win back-to-back baseball world series.",
