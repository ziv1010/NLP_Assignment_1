  "body_text": "Manchester City Women’s captain Alex Greenwood faces an extended period on the sidelines after undergoing knee surgery.\nThe 31-year-old England defender was stretchered off during the first half of City’s Champions League victory over St Polten last week as a result of a collision with Melanie Brunnthaler.\nAdvertisement\nA club statement on Thursday said Greenwood “has since undergone a repair of her MCL (medial collateral ligament) and will now return to the City Football Academy to work closely with the club’s medical team”. No timeframe was provided on her recovery.\n“Not the ending to 2024 that I had planned,” Greenwood said in an update on social media.\n“I will work so hard to be back on the pitch as soon as I can, for now I’m going to take some time to myself and family who always give their time to me.”\nNot the ending to 2024 that I had planned 😞\nI will work so hard to be back on the pitch as soon as I can, for now I’m going to take some time to myself & family who always give their time to me.\nThankyou for all the support this year, see you all soon ❤️ pic.twitter.com/Ov1AGfqZBk— Alex Greenwood (@AlexGreenwood) December 19, 2024\nGreenwood joins a growing injury list for head coach Gareth Taylor which includes top scorer Khadija Shaw, who was absent for City’s 3-0 defeat at Barcelona in the Champions League on Wednesday evening.\nThe Jamaican striker, who has netted nine goals in nine Women’s Super League games this season, has missed City’s past three matches in all competitions with a lower leg issue and will not return until after the upcoming winter break. Lauren Hemp and Vivianne Miedema also remain unavailable with long-term knee issues.\nGreenwood will be hoping she can recover in time to give herself every chance of featuring for England at next summer’s European Championship in Switzerland.\nThe former Lyon defender has been a mainstay in England’s backline under manager Sarina Wiegman, winning 96 caps since her senior debut in 2014.\nThe Lionesses play six games in the UEFA Nations League between now and the start of the Euros, which begin on July 2.\nDefending champions England will face France, the Netherlands and Euros debutants Wales in Group D.\n(Oli Scarff/AFP via Getty Images)",
