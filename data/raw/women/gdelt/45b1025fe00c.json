  "body_text": "Chairman of the Nigeria Premier Football League, Gbenga Elegbeleye, has defended the standard of officiating in the Nigerian top flight, insisting it is improving due to stricter measures against erring referees and the return of the league to television, The PUNCH reports.\nOfficiating issues in the NPFL have been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks, with the Nigeria Football Federation also expressing strong dissatisfaction with refereeing performances across all tiers of Nigerian club football.\nWhile the NFF Refereeing Development Committee has, in recent times, indefinitely suspended eight referees from the NPFL, Nigeria Women Football League and Nigeria National League, Elegbeleye said there has been noticeable improvement in officiating.\n“The league we are running now is one we want Nigerians to appreciate not just now, but in the future — a league capable of competing with the best in the world.”\n“Yes, the referees are products of the NFF, but we also have the ability to make recommendations to the referees’ committee, and they always accept them. That is why you see referees being removed. The NFF is 100 per cent with us,” he said on Sports Salsa, a radio programme monitored by our correspondent.\n“There are human errors and errors of judgement on the part of referees and even critics. We take every video for assessment with retired referees before we go back to the NFF to make recommendations. In such situations, the NFF always cooperates by removing any referee we report.\n“Officiating is a global problem; it is not only in Nigeria. Ours has even improved, and we saw what happened at the AFCON,” he added.\nElegbeleye also said the return of the NPFL to television coverage would further compel referees to raise their standards.\n“Now that television is coming in, referees know they are under the eyes of the world. They are being seen by everyone outside the stadium, and there will be questions,” he said.\nTo further enhance refereeing performance, the NPFL has been considering the introduction of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) for almost two years, and the chairman hinted that progress is being made.\n“To enhance the performance of referees, they now have communication gadgets, which were not in place before, and we are gradually moving towards VAR. But that isn’t enough; we also have to train the referees. The NFF has shortlisted referees for training on the use of VAR, which means that soon, we may start using VAR in our league. The NFF also provided the communication gadgets,” he added.\nThe NPFL enters Matchday 23 this midweek, with five fixtures decided on Wednesday.\nAction continues on Thursday at four venues, with the South-West derby between Ikorodu City and former champions Shooting Stars slated for the Mobolaji Johnson Arena, Lagos.",
