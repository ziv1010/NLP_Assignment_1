Then fans invaded the pitch,” one witness told AFP.\nVideos and images on social media appear to show chaotic scenes outside the stadium, with large crowds attempting to climb over walls and numerous bodies on the ground.\nThe BBC has not been able to independently verify these videos.\nRegional authorities are working to “restore calm”, Prime Minister Bah said in a statement, and added that hospitals are aiding the injured.\nThousands of spectators were present when the crush happened at a match between Guinean teams N’zérékoré and Labé, local news website MediaGuinee reported.\nIt said Sunday’s match was part of a tournament in honour of President Mamadi Doumbouya, who seized power in a coup in September 2021.\nOne of the worst massacres in Guinea’s history also took place in a stadium.\nIn 2009, 156 people were killed after troops opened fire at an opposition rally at a stadium in the capital, Conakry.\nMany were shot, stabbed, beaten or crushed in a stampede as security forces fired teargas and charged into the stadium. Scores of women were also raped.\nFormer military ruler Moussa Dadis Camara was recently sentenced to 20 years in prison for crimes against humanity in connection with the massacre.\nSource: BBC\n--Agencies",
