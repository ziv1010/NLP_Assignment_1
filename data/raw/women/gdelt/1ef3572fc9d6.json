  "body_text": "The Jamaica women’s national team is set to head to the Women’s World Cup with crowdfunding help to cover some costs of accommodation and meals.\nJamaica will compete in only their second tournament next month but two online fundraisers, seeking to raise $175,000, have been set up to “allow both staff and players to focus” on the competition in Australia and New Zealand.\nAdvertisement\nA ‘Reggae Girlz Rise Up’ fundraising page, launched by the mother of Houston Dash and Jamaica midfielder Havana Solaun, has set a target of $100,000.\nIt calls on “soccer enthusiasts who love the power of a Cinderella story” to help offset the expenses incurred on their “Australian adventure”.\nAnother page, set up by the Reggae Girlz Foundation, is out to raise $75,000 for the team’s “official send-off camp” in July, saying that donations will be used to pay for “venue, travel, lodging and player meals”.\nThe fundraising pages had received almost $74,000 in donations at the time of publication, with Hue Menzies, the head coach in 2019, contributing $500.\nJamaica’s women’s team issued a statement earlier this month to express concerns over facilities and preparation for this summer’s tournament.\nThe statement cited problems around “accommodation, training conditions and nutrition” among other issues and claimed the side had missed “several official FIFA friendly matches” ahead of the World Cup.\nThe Jamaica Football Federation did not respond to The Athletic’s request for comment after the statement was published.\nJamaica, ranked 43rd in the world, lost all three group games in France in 2019, but head to this summer’s edition under new coach Lorne Donaldson and with Manchester City’s Khadija Shaw (pictured) in attack.\nThey start their campaign against France on July 23, before taking on Panama and Brazil in Group F.\nThe tournament runs from July 20 to August 20.\n(Photo: Getty Images)",
