Afroze-Numa still fondly remembers being the first woman in the valley to own a pair of shoes.\nHosai Ahmadzai, Afghanistan\nTV presenter\nWhen the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August 2021, Hosai Ahmadzai was one of very few female news anchors to carry on broadcasting in the country.\nShe continues her work at Shamshad TV despite safety concerns and societal resistance against women in the media.\nShe has since interviewed numerous Taliban officials, but she is constrained in what she can ask them and is unable to question their conduct.\nAhmadzai has a background in law and political science and has been working in the media for seven years. She focuses on girls' education, which has been severely restricted by the Taliban.\nEsi Buobasa, Ghana\nFishmonger\nA native of Fuveme, a Ghanaian village washed away by the sea, Esi Buobasa has experienced first-hand the impact of climate change.\nWith her husband and five children, she was forced to migrate as sea levels rose, making her land uninhabitable.\nA leading fishmonger in her village, Buobasa and her colleagues set up an association aimed at helping fisherwomen in the region, as their source of income is threatened by coastal erosion.\nThe alliance, which now has about 100 members, meets weekly to discuss issues affecting women in the business and makes monetary contributions to support families in need.\nWe despair every time the tidal waves come. Death comes for us and the next generation.\nEsi Buobasa\nChila Kumari Burman, UK\nArtist\nWorking across a range of arts including printmaking, drawing, painting, installation and film, Chila Kumari Burman uses her work to discuss issues such as representation, gender and cultural identity.\nThis year, the artist has seen her work feature at the Blackpool Illuminations, a lights festival that has been running in the UK since 1879.

Her journey has led her to become the climate change ambassador with the National Center for Science Education.\nNow based in the state of Georgia, she uses climate change to teach physical science concepts to her students and raises awareness of environmental issues in her community.\nEven though climate change is an \"all hands on deck\" situation, we just can't do it all by ourselves.

Other times I feel anger and get hijacked by my emotions, wanting to strike out in react mode. But in the best of days, I use my pain and anger to anchor myself into the root of my emotions, transforming them into a deep commitment to act out of strength, love and expectant joy, co-creating the better world we all want for our children and their descendants.\nChristiana Figueres\nBella Galhos, East Timor\nPolitical activist\nA fearless campaigner, Bella Galhos has been instrumental in transforming East Timor - also known as Timor-Leste - both before and after the country gained independence from Indonesia in 2002.\nDuring years in exile, she travelled the world advocating the self-determination of her people.

The defense ministry later issued an apology to Gonoi.\nSonia Guajajara, Brazil\nState minister\nA prominent figure in Brazil's burgeoning indigenous rights movement, in 2023 Sonia Guajajara became her country's first minister for native peoples, hailed as a historic appointment by newly elected President Lula da Silva.\nShe vowed to make the battle against environmental crimes one of her top priorities.\nGuajajara was born to illiterate parents in Araribóia, in the Amazon region, where she had a front-row seat to the devastation climate change can wreak on an ecosystem.\nShe left to study literature, work as a nurse and a teacher, and begin a career in activism. In 2022 she became the first indigenous congresswoman for the state of São Paulo.\nWe have to think about how to promote climate justice and fight environmental racism, because the people who can best protect the environment are the first and most affected by its destruction. We, the indigenous people, are the true guardians of biodiversity and life.\nSonia Guajajara\nRenita Holmes, US\nHousing campaigner\nA resident of Miami's Little Haiti neighbourhood, Madame Renita Holmes is the founding director of OUR Homes, a business and property consulting practice in the US state of Florida.\nShe campaigns for housing rights for marginalised communities, including those affected by climate gentrification as rising sea levels push up property prices in areas further from the coast.\nRaised by a single mother of 11 children, Holmes is a senior living with disabilities.\nShe is a fellow of the Cleo Institute's Empowering Resilient Women programme, which seeks to spark climate action through science-based education.

This led to the development of more than 25 volunteer groups across the country.\nShe has helped to extinguish several hundred fires across Russia and collaborated with Greenpeace, until the NGO was officially labelled an \"undesirable organisation\" and its Russian branch was shut down.\nKosacheva has also created a website for volunteer forest firefighters which is considered the most complete online database in Russian with information on preventing and controlling wildfires.\nNo matter how pervasive the climate crisis is, every big achievement starts with small ones. It may seem that we are too small to change something globally, but we must start with the changes we can make around ourselves.\nSofia Kosacheva\nMonica McWilliams, UK\nFormer politician and peace negotiator\nThis year marks 25 years since Northern Ireland's Good Friday Agreement was signed. Monica McWilliams played a crucial role as a lead negotiator during the multi-party peace talks that led to the agreement.\nShe co-founded the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, a political party that crossed the sectarian divide, which introduced critical provisions to the peace treaty.\nShe was elected to the first Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly and as chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, she drafted the advice on a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.\nMcWilliams currently serves as a commissioner for the disbandment of armed groups and has published widely on violence against women.\nNajla Mohamed-Lamin, Western Sahara\nWomen's rights and climate activist\nFounder of the Almasar Library Centre, Najla Mohamed-Lamin wants to educate women and children on health and the environment in Saharawi refugee camps in south-west Algeria.\nHer family are originally from Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, annexed by Morocco in 1975 and the subject of a long-running territorial dispute.

But Xu Zaozao, a single woman, was told the procedure was only available to married couples in China.\nShe took the hospital to court in the first legal challenge on the rights of unmarried women in China to freeze their eggs.\nThis pioneering legal battle, which began in December 2019, has made headlines amid concerns around the country's low birth-rate.\nThe final verdict is still pending, but Xu's case has been studied by scholars in the fields of law, medicine and ethics. Today, she remains a prominent advocate for single women's reproductive rights and bodily autonomy.\nScience, Health & Tech\nBasima Abdulrahman, Iraq\nGreen building entrepreneur\nIn 2014, when the so-called Islamic State group took over huge parts of her home country, Iraq, Basima Abdulrahman was studying at university in the US.\nMany Iraqi towns were destroyed as a result of fighting, but when Abdulrahman returned home after her masters in structural engineering, she saw a way of helping.\nShe founded KESK, Iraq's first initiative dedicated to green building. She found that creating greener structures meant combining the latest energy-efficient technologies and materials with Iraq's traditional building methods.\nShe is committed to ensuring that today's building practices do not compromise the well-being of future generations.\nI am often anxious about the climate crisis. I can't help but wonder how anyone can find peace without being part of the solution to mitigate its risks.\nBasima Abdulrahman\nAmina Al-Bish, Syria\nVolunteer rescue worker\nAs Syria's civil war escalated in 2017, Amina Al-Bish decided to become one of the first female volunteers of Syria Civil Defence, a volunteer organisation also known as the White Helmets, hoping to save lives and provide first aid to injured civilians.\nAmina later volunteered to rescue victims of the earthquakes that hit Syria and Turkey in February 2023, which devastated neighbourhoods and trapped her own family members under the rubble.\nNow Al-Bish works to improve the lives of other women in her community in northern Syria, where fighting continues. She is pursuing a degree in Business Administration and says her dream is to participate in building a peaceful Syria.\nSara Al-Saqqa, Palestinian Territories\nGeneral surgeon\nThe first certified Palestinian female surgeon in Gaza, Dr Sara Al-Saqqa works in its largest hospital, Al-Shifa.\nShe has been using her Instagram account to document the experience of treating people in the middle of a war. Al-Shifa hospital has been badly damaged as Israel presses its offensive against Hamas.\nAl-Saqqa has been posting about the lack of electricity, fuel, water and food, which has prevented the hospital from treating its patients. She had to leave Al-Shifa shortly before Israeli soldiers raided the hospital, in what the Israel Defense Forces described as a targeted operation against Hamas.\nAl-Saqqa studied medicine in the Islamic University of Gaza and surgery at London's Queen Mary University. She is no longer the only female surgeon in Gaza, with others following in her footsteps.\nBayang, China\nDiarist and sustainability advocate\nSince 2018, Bayang has been keeping an eco-diary, monitoring local species and changes to water sources, recording the weather and observing plants.\nShe lives in China's Qinghai Province, which is situated mostly on the Tibetan Plateau and is already experiencing the effects of climate change such as higher temperatures, melting glaciers and desertification.\nBayang is part of the Sanjiangyuan Women Environmentalists Network, and advocates health and sustainability in her community.\nShe has acquired skills in crafting eco-friendly products - including lip balm, soap and bags - to protect local water sources and inspire others to join the environmental cause.\nSusan Chomba, Kenya\nScientist\nNow a director at the World Resources Institute (WRI), Susan Chomba says her experience of childhood poverty in Kirinyaga county in central Kenya motivates her to help improve the lives of others.\nShe primarily concerns herself with protecting forests, restoring landscapes and transforming Africa's food systems.\nFrom the tropical forests of the Congo Basin to the dry West African Sahel, as well as eastern Africa, Chomba spends time working with smallholder farmers, particularly women and young people, to help them make the most of their land.\nShe shares her expertise with governments and researchers to build more resilient communities in the face of intensifying climate change.\nI'm more affected by the inaction of world leaders, especially from the major emitters, who also have the economic power to change course but are held back by money, power and politics. To manage those feelings, I bury myself in actions on the ground, working with women and youth across Africa on nature protection and restoration, transforming our food systems and changing policies.\nSusan Chomba\nLeanne Cullen-Unsworth, UK\nMarine scientist\nSeagrass is known for its ability to store carbon and provide nurseries for fish, but some underwater habitats have been devastated.\nLeanne Cullen-Unsworth is one of the founders and current CEO of Project Seagrass, the UK's first seagrass restoration scheme at a meaningful scale.\nThe project makes the process easier by using a remote-control robot to plant seeds, and could create a blueprint to help other countries restore their underwater meadows.\nAn interdisciplinary scientist with more than 20 years of experience in marine research, Cullen-Unsworth is devoted to science-based conservation and restoration.\nThere is too much to do for anyone to achieve things alone, but people are working together and sharing knowledge. For my own small part, I know we can revive a vital habitat, protect it and restore it for all of the benefits it provides our planet and society.\nLeanne Cullen-Unsworth\nCanan Dagdeviren, Turkey\nScientist and inventor\nAn associate professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Media Lab in the US, Canan Dagdeviren has recently invented a wearable ultrasound patch for early breast cancer detection.\nShe drew inspiration from her aunt who was diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer at age 49, despite having regular cancer screening, and died six months later.\nAt her aunt's bedside, Dagdeviren drew up a rough plan of a diagnostic device that could be incorporated into a bra and would allow for more frequent screening of individuals at high risk of breast cancer. The technology could potentially save millions of lives.\nIzabela Dłużyk, Poland\nSound recordist\nTape recorder in hand, Izabela Dłużyk sets out to capture the extraordinary sounds of Białoweiza, one of Europe's oldest and best preserved forests, in Poland.\nThe field recordist is unusual not just because she is a young woman in a profession dominated by men, but because she has been blind since birth.\nDłużyk has developed a special sensitivity to birdsong ever since her family gave her a tape recorder at the age of 12 and can identify species just using sound.\nShe believes it's a privilege to share \"all the good, beauty and solace\" which nature sounds have to offer, \"regardless of any differences we might perceive among each other\".\nMarcela Fernández, Colombia\nExpedition guide\nGlaciers provide an essential source of freshwater for local communities, but in Colombia they are rapidly disappearing.\nFounder Marcela Fernández and her colleagues at the NGO Cumbres Blancas (White Peaks) raise awareness of the issue, highlighting that of the 14 glaciers that once existed, only six are left and these are at risk.\nThrough scientific expeditions and by assembling a team of mountaineers, photographers, scientists, and artists, Fernández monitors changes and develops creative ways to prevent glacier loss.\nWith her adjacent project, \"Pazabordo\" (Peace on board), she also travels to areas affected by violence during Colombia's 50-year internal armed conflict.\nGlaciers have taught me to deal with grief, with absence. When you hear them you know that their loss is a damage we can't undo, but we can still contribute and leave a mark.\nMarcela Fernández\nTimnit Gebru, US\nAI expert\nA highly influential artificial-intelligence computer scientist, Timnit Gebru is the founder and executive director of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR), set up as \"a space for independent, community-rooted AI research, free from Big Tech's pervasive influence\".\nShe has criticised racial bias in facial recognition technologies, and co-founded a non-profit that works to improve the inclusion of black people in AI.\nThe Ethiopian-born computer scientist is on the board of AddisCoder, which teaches programming to Ethiopian students.\nWhile working as co-lead of Google's ethical AI team in 2020, she co-authored an academic paper that raised issues in AI language models, including structural bias against minorities and marginalised people and places.\nThe report led to her departure from the company - at the time, the company responded that the paper ignored relevant research and said Gebru had resigned. However, Gebru says she was fired for raising issues of discrimination in the workplace.\nClaudia Goldin, US\nEconomist and Nobel Prize winner\nAn American economic historian and labour economist, Claudia Goldin was awarded this year's Nobel Prize in economics for her work on women's employment and the causes of the gender pay gap.\nShe is only the third woman to receive the prize, and the first not to share the award with male colleagues.\nGoldin is the Henry Lee Professor of Economics at Harvard University, and researches topics such as income inequality, education and immigration.\nSome of her most influential papers look at the history of women's quest for career and family, and the impact of the contraceptive pill on women's career and marriage decisions.\nTrần Gấm, Vietnam\nBiogas business owner\nIn 2012, Trần Gấm started introducing more climate-friendly energy sources to farms in Vietnam.\nThe mother-of-two saw a gap in the market and started a business installing and managing biogas plants in Hanoi, later expanding the operation to three neighbouring provinces.\nHer project helps farmers cut costs by turning cow and pig manure, water hyacinth and other waste into biogas - considered a far more sustainable energy source than natural gas - which can then be used as energy for cooking and running a household.\nBusinesses like Trần's engage local communities and drive the political support needed for climate change mitigation.\nWe must live, and must live well, so I have tried to cope and protect loved ones by enhancing our health through physical exercise, eating a balanced diet, and maintaining sleep patterns. I also encourage people to live an organic lifestyle, growing their own fruits and vegetables, and advocating against using chemical pesticides on our vegetables.\nTrần Gấm\nAnna Huttunen, Finland\nCarbon impact tech expert\nAs a sustainable mobility enthusiast, Anna Huttunen pushed for greener, cleaner, more efficient mobility in the Finnish city of Lahti, named the European Green Capital 2021.\nShe led the city's ground-breaking personal carbon trading model - the world's first app to allow citizens to earn credits by using environmentally friendly transportation such as cycling or public transport.\nShe works as climate neutral cities adviser for NetZeroCities, an organisation which helps European cities attempt to reach climate neutrality by 2030.\nHuttunen aims to make others excited about sustainable mobility and is a keen advocate for cycling, which she considers the future of transport in cities.\nMunicipalities around the world are full of amazing people working towards enabling a more sustainable life for their citizens.

There are innovative methods to mitigate and adapt to this crisis.\nGladys Kalema-Zikusoka\nSonia Kastner, US\nWildfire detection tech developer\nThis year has seen wildfires ravage some of the world's biggest forests. With firefighters often struggling to keep up with the scale and spread of the blazes, Sonia Kastner founded an organisation to help detect them earlier.\nPano AI uses artificial intelligence technology to prepare a faster response before fires spread by scanning the landscape for signs of ignition and alerting responders, instead of relying on members of the public to call emergency services.\nKastner previously spent more than 10 years working in a variety of tech start-ups.\nWhat gives me hope is the incredible power of human innovation. I have witnessed first hand the potential of technology and data-driven solutions to help address the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\nSonia Kastner\nAstrid Linder, Sweden\nProfessor of traffic safety\nFor decades, cars have been manufactured using crash-test dummies based on the average male – even though statistics show that women are more at risk of injury or death in the event of a frontal collision.\nEngineer Astrid Linder has worked to change that, leading the project to create the world's first average-sized female crash test dummy, which takes into account the morphology of women's bodies.\nA professor of Traffic Safety at the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) and adjunct professor at Chalmers University, Linder is an expert in biomechanics and road injury prevention.\nNeha Mankani, Pakistan\nMidwife\nWhen devastating floods hit Pakistan last year, midwife Neha Mankani travelled to affected areas to offer her skills.\nThrough her charity, Mama Baby Fund, Mankani and her team provided life-saving birthing kits and midwifery care to more than 15,000 flood-affected families.\nHer typical practice focuses on low-resourced settings, emergency response and climate-affected communities.\nMama Baby Fund has now raised enough money to launch a boat ambulance that will transport pregnant women living in coastal communities to nearby hospitals and clinics for urgent treatment.\nThe work of midwives in communities facing climate-related disasters is vital. We are both first responders and climate activists, who make sure women can continue to receive the reproductive, pregnancy, and postpartum care they need, even when the situation around them is deteriorating.\nNeha Mankani\nWanjira Mathai, Kenya\nEnviromental adviser\nAn inspiring leader for an entire continent, Wanjira Mathai has more than 20 years of experience advocating for social and environmental change.\nShe led the Green Belt Movement, an indigenous grassroots organisation in Kenya that empowered women through the planting of trees, established by Wanjira's mother and winner of the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize, Wangari Maathai.\nMathai is now the managing director for Africa and Global Partnerships at the World Resources Institute, and the chair of the Wangari Maathai Foundation.\nShe currently serves as Africa adviser to the Bezos Earth Fund, as well as to the Clean Cooking Alliance and the European Climate Foundation.\nAction is \"local\". We need to support local initiatives like tree-based entrepreneurs and community-led work around restoration, renewable energy and the circular economy. Bottom-up efforts like these give me hope as they show us what is possible.\nWanjira Mathai\nIsabel Farías Meyer, Chile\nEarly menopause campaigner\nIsabel Farías Meyer never suspected that her irregular menstrual cycles were a symptom of anything suspicious, but just before she turned 18 she was diagnosed with early menopause or premature ovarian failure. This condition occurs when ovaries stop working properly and affects an estimated 1% of women under the age of 40.\nWomen experience similar symptoms to those of the menopause, but at a very early age. Farías has spoken frankly about how the diagnosis has affected her life, including living with osteoporosis.\nThe 30-year-old journalist has launched the first regional network for early menopause in Latin America to share information, combat myths and create safe spaces for people living with the diagnosis.\nNatalie Psaila, Malta\nMedical doctor\nMalta has some of the strictest rules on abortion in Europe and Natalie Psaila helps women who need information and advice.\nShe co-founded Doctors for Choice Malta, and advocates decriminalisation and legalisation of abortion and better access to contraception.\nPsaila says the near total ban in Malta, where terminations are only allowed if a woman's life is at risk, means women take pills without medical supervision. She has established a helpline that gives support to women before, during and after abortion.\nShe has also published a sex education book aimed at 10 to 13-year-olds called My Body's Fantastic Journey, to help improve knowledge of reproductive health in the country.\nOlena Rozvadovska, Ukraine\nChildren's rights advocate\nHelping Ukrainian children process war trauma is Olena Rozvadovska's mission. She is the co-founder of Voices of Children, a charity that provides psychological support.\nThe organisation started as a grassroots initiative in 2019, four years after Rozvadovska volunteered near the frontline in Donbas as Russian-backed separatists started fighting against Ukraine.\nThe foundation now has more than 100 psychologists working in 14 centres, as well as a free hotline. It has helped tens of thousands of children and parents.\nRozvadovska took part in the Oscar-nominated documentary A House Made of Splinters, and with her team published a book, War Through the Voices of Children.\nRumaitha Al Busaidi, Oman\nScientist\nWomen and Girls, You Are Part of the Climate Solution is the title of Omani scientist Rumaitha Al Busaidi's 2021 TED Talk, which has garnered more than a million views and reflects her championing of Arab women's rights.\nAl Busaidi's expertise has led to her position on the Arab Youth Council for Climate Change and the Environment Society of Oman.\nShe has also advised the Biden administration on delivering climate-informed foreign aid, and the government of Greenland on sustainable tourism.\nShe is the youngest Omani woman to reach the South Pole and the founder of WomeX, a platform to help Arab women develop business negotiation skills.\nThe number one solution to overcome climate change is to empower women and girls. The multiplier effect they have across their communities will change perceptions and actions and protect this place we call home.\nRumaitha Al Busaidi\nSumini, Indonesia\nForest manager\nIn Indonesia's conservative Aceh province it is unusual for women to be leaders.\nWhen Sumini realised a major cause of floods in her village was deforestation, which also contributes towards climate change, she decided to take action and work with other women in the community.\nHer group received a permit from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry allowing the community of Damaran Baru village to manage the area, all 251 hectares of forest, for 35 years\nShe now leads a Village Forest Management Unit (LPHK), to discourage illegal logging and hunters threatening Sumatran tigers, pangolins and other at-risk wildlife.\nWith rampant deforestation and wildlife poaching these days, forests should get more and more attention when it comes to how we collectively tackle the climate crisis. Keep the forest, keep the life.\nSumini\nFabiola Trejo, Mexico\nSocial psychologist\nWhen social psychologist Fabiola Trejo started her academic journey, almost two decades ago, there wasn't any research in Mexico focusing on women's sexual pleasure as an issue of social justice.\nTrejo paved the way with her work, which looks at social inequity, gender-based violence and the political power of sexual pleasure, and seeks to promote sexual justice for women.\nShe argues that some inequalities make women more sexually vulnerable. Through speaking engagements, scientific research and practical workshops, she helps people explore pleasure, orgasms and masturbation in ways that overcome these issues.\nHer work resonates in Latin America and Spanish-speaking communities, where issues around female health and sexuality remain taboo.\nJennifer Uchendu, Nigeria\nMental health advocate\nThe ambition of youth-led organisation SustyVibes, founded by Jennifer Uchendu, is to make sustainability actionable, relatable and cool.\nUchendu's recent work has focused on exploring the impacts of the climate crisis on the mental health of Africans, especially young people.\nIn 2022, she set up The Eco-Anxiety Africa project (TEAP) to focus on validating and safeguarding climate emotions in Africans through research, advocacy and climate-aware psychotherapy.\nHer goal is to work with people and organisations interested in shifting mindsets and doing the hard and often uncomfortable work of learning about climate emotions.\nI experience a range of emotions when it comes to the climate crisis. I am slowly making peace with the fact that I will never be able to do enough but that I can, instead, do my best. Showing up in solidarity with others to act, rest and just be, helps me safeguard my climate-induced feelings.\nJennifer Uchendu\nAnamaría Font Villarroel, Venezuela\nParticle physicist\nA researcher on particle physics, Prof Anamaría Font Villarroel focuses on superstring theory, which seeks to explain all particles and fundamental forces in nature by modelling them as tiny, vibrating strands of energy.\nFont's research has deepened the understanding of the consequences of the theory when it comes to the structure of matter and quantum gravity, which are also relevant to the description of black holes and the first moments after the Big Bang.\nShe has previously received the Fundación Polar award in Venezuela and this year was chosen as a laureate for the Unesco Women in Science award.\nQiyun Woo, Singapore\nStoryteller\nAs an environmentalist and content creator, Qiyun Woo uses social media to share ideas about climate change.\nHer online platform, The Weird and the Wild, is dedicated to making climate science more accessible and less scary. It focuses on content to advocate, educate and engage communities on climate change action.\nShe co-hosts an environmental podcast focused on South East Asia called Climate Cheesecake, which aims to break down complex climate topics into more manageable slices.\nShe is also a National Geographic Young Explorer.\nThe climate crisis is complex, overwhelming and scary. We can approach it with fierce but gentle curiosity - instead of fear - so that we can keep our heart soft to care for the world, while sharpening our tools to dismantle what doesn't work and build what does.\nQiyun Woo\nElham Youssefian, US/Iran\nAdviser in climate and disability\nA human rights lawyer who is blind, Elham Youssefian is a fervent advocate for the inclusion of people with disabilities when addressing climate change, particularly in relation to emergency response to climate incidents.\nBorn and raised in Iran, Youssefian emigrated to the US in 2016. Today, she plays an instrumental role in the International Disability Alliance, a global network of more than 1,100 organisations representing people with disabilities.\nHer mission is to educate decision-makers on their obligations when it comes to the impact of climate change on people with disabilities. She also champions the immense potential of individuals with disabilities in the fight against the climate crisis.\nWe, as individuals with disabilities, have proven time and again our ability to surmount intricate challenges and find solutions even when none seem to exist. People with disabilities can and should stand at the forefront of the battle against climate change.\nElham Youssefian\nWhat is 100 Women?\nBBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspiring women around the world every year. We create documentaries, features and interviews about their lives - stories that put women at the centre and are published and broadcast on all BBC platforms.\nFollow BBC 100 Women on Instagram and Facebook. Join the conversation using #BBC100Women.\nHow were the 100 Women chosen?\nThe BBC 100 Women team drew up a shortlist based on names they gathered through research and those suggested by the BBC's network of World Service Languages teams, as well as BBC Media Action.\nWe were looking for candidates who had made headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months, as well as those who have inspiring stories to tell, or have achieved something significant or influenced their societies in ways that wouldn't necessarily make the news.\nA pool of names was also assessed against this year's theme – climate change and its disproportionate impact on women and girls around the world, from which a group of 28 Climate Pioneers and other environmental leaders were selected.\nWe represented voices from across the political spectrum and from all areas of society, explored names around topics that split opinion, and nominated women who have created their own change.\nThe list was also measured for regional representation and due impartiality before the final names were chosen. All women have given their consent to be on the list.",
