  "body_text": "Newcastle Women remember Wembley match 30 years on\nNearly 30 years ago, Newcastle Women's Football Club made history in their first game at Wembley.\nIt was a warm-up match on 11 August 1996 ahead of Newcastle United's Charity Shield against Manchester United, where Alan Shearer made his debut following a world record £15m transfer fee.\nThe team lost 2-0 but became the first Newcastle women's team to play at the stadium.\nFounded by Kim Moore in 1989, the team was set up because, she said, there were \"fewer opportunities for women, especially North East women\".\n\"We weren't affiliated with Newcastle United until 2005 so we had to fundraise to get to Wembley, but it was a dream come true.\"\nNewcastle Women FC became Newcastle United Women FC in 2005 when they officially became part of Newcastle United.",
