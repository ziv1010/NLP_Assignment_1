  "body_text": "The Minnesota Frost First Home Game Of 2026 Is This Weekend\nThe Minnesota Frost are once again proving why Minnesota is the State of Hockey. This team has earned the loyalty of fans who believe in showing up, cheering loudly, and being part of something bigger than just a game.\nAre you one of those fans?\nTHE MINNESOTA FROST ARE STILL ON TOP\nAs the 2025–2026 season continues to unfold, Minnesota’s professional women’s hockey team, the Minnesota Frost, is sitting in an impressive second-place position, trailing only the Boston Fleet.\nIt’s a familiar spot for our Frost, which has consistently set the standard in the PWHL. With the Toronto Sceptres also near the top of the standings, the Frost are right where a championship team wants to be. They are competitive, hungry, and gaining momentum at what I think is exactly the right time.\nTHE FIRST HOME GAME OF 2026 IS COMING SOON\nThat’s why Sunday, January 11th, 2026, feels so important.\nAt 1 p.m. Central Time, the Minnesota Frost will host their first home game of 2026 at Grand Casino Arena, marking Game Number 43 of the season. There’s something special about the first home game of a new year. It's a fresh start, a chance for the Frost to reset, and an opportunity for fans to get in on the build of a new year.\nMINNESOTA FROST VS. SEATTLE TORRENT\nThe Frost will face the Seattle Torrent, one of two brand-new teams added to the league this season, alongside the Vancouver Goldeneyes. Seattle has shown they’re not to be underestimated, winning three of their last five games. Minnesota, meanwhile, has taken two of its last five — and if you ask me, that only means it’s time for the Frost to shine on home ice.\nThis is where Minnesota fans come in.\nCALLING ALL PWHL HOCKY FANS IN MINNESOTA\nThe Frost are two-time Walter Cup champions. This team has made history. They are not only the first. They are the first AND second Walter's Cup champs. They’ve brought pride to Minnesota and helped elevate women’s hockey to new heights. Now, they deserve a packed arena, loud cheers, and a fan base that reminds the league exactly who they’re playing against.\nGET TICKETS TO THE FIRST HOME GAME OF 2026 AT TICKETMASTER\nIf you’ve ever thought about attending a game, this is the one.
