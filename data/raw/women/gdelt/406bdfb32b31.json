The Cardiac Cats are the home team and higher seed, but it’s the Rams that are laying serious wood as favorites.\nSaturday’s primetime kick pits two old rivals, the Bears and Packers, against one another at Soldier Field.\nThe drama continues on Sunday with a triple-header beginning with Jaguars vs. Bills at 1 p.m. ET. The 49ers and Eagles take it from there, while the Patriots will host the Chargers to close out the day’s action.\nThe round culminates with a final edition of “Monday Night Football” between the Steelers and Texans.\nIf the NFL isn’t your cup of tea, you can also apply the Betr promo code to the College Football Playoff, NHL, NBA, tennis, golf, or any other sport of your choosing.\nMore on the Betr Promo Code\n- How I Tested Betr Picks\n- What is the Betr Promo Code?\n- Pros and Cons of Betr Picks\n- What Makes Betr Picks Unique?\n- Betr Promo Code FAQs\nHow I Tested Betr Picks\nAfter completing the brief registration process at Betr Picks, my new account was ready to go.\nIn terms of functionality, I had no problem navigating the app. I found that it was incredibly easy to make selections and lock in my picks. Betr offers a wide selection of different sports and leagues to choose from, covering everything from NFL markets to UFC offerings.\nSome independent reviews have suggested that there is frustrating lag on the app, and it has logged some users out on occasions. This may be the case for some, but personally, I have not experienced such an issue thus far.\nOne drawback that did affect my gaming experience with Betr Picks is the brand’s lack of a desktop platform. While its mobile app definitely passes the test, not offering a website limits a large number of users who prefer to place their picks via desktop.\nOverall, the app-only product was still a pleasure to use and is definitely high on my shortlist of recommended daily fantasy sports platforms.\nWhat is the Betr Promo Code?\nAs mentioned above, there are two separate Betr platforms offering a welcome bonus to first-time users: Betr Sportsbook and Betr Picks.\nThe Betr Sportsbook promo code NYPBONUS is only available in Ohio and Virginia and awards all eligible signups with this offer: Get a 50% Deposit Match up to $200 in Bonus Cash + $10\nThe Betr Picks promo code NYPBONUS, on the other hand, is available to users based in a plethora of states: AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, FL, DC, GA, IL, IN, KS, KY, MA, MN, NE, NH, NM, NC, ND, OK, OR, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, VA, WV, WI, WY. New signups who register using this code will Get a 50% Deposit Match up to $200 in Bonus Cash + $10\nBoth welcome offers can take up to 72 hours to arrive in your account, but will usually be much quicker.\nFor the deposit match on Betr Picks, customers must play through their deposit and bonus amount at least once before any winnings can be accessed.\nPros and Cons of Betr Picks\nJust like with other platforms, Betr Picks has its strengths and weaknesses:\nPros of Betr Picks\n- Fast and simple sign up process\n- A wider set of fantasy sports options than other platforms\n- Generous welcome offer\n- Impressive app available for iOS and Android devices\nCons of Betr Picks\n- Not available on desktop\n- Small set of banking options\n- No international sports leagues covered\nWhat Makes Betr Picks Unique?\nAs you might expect from a company backed by Jake Paul, Betr Picks is uniquely transparent. When you head to the platform, you can uncover headshots and full biographies of the main parties involved.\nBetr Picks also covers a wide range of sports. Each of the core American professional leagues are available. You can play DFS games involving the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL. Major League Soccer is also covered, while fantasy options are also included for golf, UFC and others.\nAlong with picking team rosters, there is the option to make fantasy picks for individual players. For example, you can predict the number of passing yards that Patrick Mahomes will throw for in an NFL game.\nIt would be nice to see some international competitions included in the future. For instance, there aren’t any DFS options for English Premier League soccer yet.\nBetr Promo Code FAQs\nBelow are some of the industry’s most common questions surrounding Betr Picks and the Betr promo code:\nWhat is the Betr Picks promo code?\nThe current Betr Picks promo code is NYPBONUS.
