Everyone is welcome at this event, where we’ll also celebrate an industry member as the recipient of the Frieda Rapoport Kaplan Women’s Catalyst Award.”\nWho and what to see\nWith more than 1,000 exhibitors, there’s much ground to cover at the IFPA global show. Following is a preview of what to expect at just some of the many booths ready to impress in Atlanta.\nCalifornia Avocado Commission — Booth No. B2538\n“Current crop estimates for the 2025 California avocado season indicate that the harvest will be larger than in 2024, which was in turn larger than 2023,” said Terry Splane, CAC vice president of marketing. “The California Avocado Commission marketing team is ready to discuss creative programs and customized retail activations to support customers and the larger crop.”\nVisitors to CAC’s booth also will have the opportunity to learn more about the commission’s “What’s Inside a California Avocado” advertising campaign, which focuses on California avocado growers as well as key messaging around locally grown and sustainably farmed.\nSplane adds that creative in 2025 will showcase additional growers and build upon the “highly engaging video, digital and social communications launched this year.”\nIdaho Potato Commission — Booth No. B1539\nThe 2024 IFPA Global Produce and Floral Show is a chance to meet the two new brand members on the retail promotion team of the Idaho Potato Commission.\nPatrick Mills, who comes to the Idaho Potato Comission from Bashas’, will cover the West Coast and Matt Zapczynski, most recently at Merchant Distributors, will manage the Northeast.\n“We are excited for the experience they have in the industry and insights they can bring to their customers,” said IPC’s Ross Johnson. “Customers should come meet them.”\nAs for Idaho potatoes at the show, the commission says the timing of IFPA couldn’t be better.\n“In Idaho we have only started to harvest our crop,” said Johnson, when The Packer connected with him in September.\n“By the show, we will have a much better idea of what the profile of our crop this year looks like,” he added. “We like giving our customers information that helps them plan and prepare their retail promotions, especially with the holidays right around the corner from the show. Typically, our farms like to be completely done with harvest by the 10th of October, so the timing will be perfect.”\nIPC also plans to highlight the work it’s doing in analytics and understanding where the opportunities are in the potato category, Johnson said.\n“The show is an excellent way for our customers to come see some of the efforts we’ve done in this space to help drive growth,” Johnson said.\nAvocados From Mexico — Booth No. C1749\nAvocados From Mexico says it plans to showcase partnerships and solutions to help reinforce brand equity and drive demand centered on its tentpole events, health and wellness and education.
