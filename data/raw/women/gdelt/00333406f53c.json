  "body_text": "SINGAPORE (AP) — The United States, which had a frustrating swim world championships, ended on a high note Sunday with a world record in the women’s 4x100 medley in the last event of the eight-day championships. The Americans swam a record time of 3 minutes, 49.34 seconds. The Americans had the old record of 3:49.63. The United States finished with nine gold medals — one more than Australia — but has battled a case of “acute gastroenteritis” picked up at a training camp in Thailand.\nBUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Charles Leclerc will be chasing Ferrari’s first win in Formula 1 this year after taking a surprise pole position for the Hungarian Grand Prix ahead of title contenders Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. Pole position is usually a big advantage in Hungary, where it’s tough to overtake. The chance of rain gives the drivers and teams an extra factor to consider. Standings leader Piastri starts second and his teammate Norris is third after both were within a tenth of a second of Leclerc’s time.\nOXNARD, Calif. (AP) — Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones does not intend to trade Micah Parsons after the star defensive end said he wants to leave the team amid a breakdown in negotiating a contract extension. Parsons remains at training camp after writing on social media Friday to request a trade, where he has yet to practice because of a back injury. He did not speak to reporters, walking off the field at the same time as Jones was fielding questions for more than 15 minutes. No stranger to public and prolonged disputes with standout players, Jones insisted the standoff with Parsons is no different than past situations.\nMONTREAL (AP) — Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko upset top-seeded Coco Gauff 6-1, 6-4 on Saturday night to reach the National Bank Open quarterfinals. Gauff dropped to 2-3 since winning the French Open. She followed the major victory with opening losses in Berlin and Wimbledon, then overcame double-fault problems to win two three-set matches in Montreal. Gauff had five double-faults Saturday after having 23 in her opener against Danielle Collins and 14 against Veronika Kudermetova. The 18-year-old Mboko, ranked 85th in the world, finished off the 21-year-old Gauff — who had 24 unforced errors — in 1 hour, 2 minutes. Mboko will face Jessica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain, a 7-5, 6-1, 6-2 winner over Lin Zhu of China in a rain-interrupted match that ended just before midnight.\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Lionel Messi exited Inter Miami’s Leagues Cup match against Necaxa after suffering an apparent injury in the opening minutes. Messi appeared to get tripped going for the ball in the eighth minute on Saturday night, fell to the ground and slammed his fist in frustration before walking toward midfield as play continued. He then sat on the pitch as trainers came and worked on his upper leg/right thigh area for a couple of minutes. He was subbed out in the 11th for Federico Redondo and immediately headed to the locker room.\nBRISTOL, Tenn. (AP) — The MLB Speedway Classic has been suspended by rain. The Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds started the first MLB regular-season game in the state of Tennessee after a 2-hour, 17-minute rain delay before the first pitch. Then another rain delay in the first inning led to the game being pushed to Sunday afternoon at Bristol Motor Speedway. This racetrack is called “The Last Great Colosseum.” Organizers threw a big party mixing NASCAR themes with baseball with star Tim McGraw performing. Players for both teams stood in the back of pickup trucks and rode around the half-mile bullring racetrack. But rain had the final say.\nSterling Sharpe stood at the podium a few feet from his bronze bust, took off his new gold jacket and gave it to his fellow Pro Football Hall of Fame brother. Shannon Sharpe had given Sterling his first Super Bowl ring and now big brother was returning the favor on stage after the crowning moment of his football career. Eric Allen, Jared Allen and Antonio Gates joined Sterling Sharpe as the Class of 2025 was inducted into football immortality during a ceremony at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, where the Los Angeles Chargers beat the Detroit Lions 34-7 on Thursday night to kick off the NFL preseason.\nBOSTON (AP) — Houston Astros reliever Héctor Neris used a balk to advance a runner to third, then had an exchange with Red Sox third base coach Kyle Hudson that led to a dustup between the teams. Neris surrendered Trevor Story’s two-out RBI double in the seventh inning of Houston’s 7-3 loss. The right-hander then balked, moving Story to third, before Carlos Narváez bounced to shortstop for the final out. As Neris made his way off the mound, he had words with Hudson and yelled toward the Red Sox dugout, causing both teams, including bullpens, to come on the field before order was quickly restored.\nNEW YORK (AP) — The WNBA said Saturday that the individual who threw a sex toy on the court at an Atlanta Dream game earlier in the week was arrested and that any person throwing objects onto the court will be ejected from the arena and face a minimum one-year ban. The incident in Atlanta occurred late in the fourth quarter of the Dream’s game against Golden State on Tuesday in College Park, Georgia. On Friday, another sex toy was thrown in Chicago under a basket after a whistle was blown to stop play during the third quarter of Golden State's 73-66 victory over the Sky.\nLAS VEGAS (AP) — Minnesota Lynx forward and MVP frontrunner Napheesa Collier injured her right ankle during Saturday’s 111-58 victory over the Las Vegas Aces. Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve says it is too soon to assess the severity of the injury. Trailing the play in which Natisha Hiedeman drove the lane for a lay-up, Collier appeared to step on teammate Alanna Smith’s left foot and immediately went down near Las Vegas’ bench with the Lynx holding a 92-49 lead late in the third quarter.\nFinals\nINTERLEAGUEFinal Tampa Bay 4 L.A.
