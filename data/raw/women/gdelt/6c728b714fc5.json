  "body_text": "After offering sneak peeks at this summer's hottest titles, Collider returns with an Exclusive Preview Event focused on fall releases you won't want to miss. From never-before-seen images of Wicked: For Good and The Running Man to interviews with the creatives behind Mortal Kombat II and The Conjuring: Last Rites, the site is proud to partner with several distributors and studios and add to the anticipation of the movies hitting the big screen and streaming platforms soon. Covering over 50 unreleased titles, the preview event took place throughout this week, updating fans and cinephiles alike. Below is the complete recap of the breaking news items Collider put out in the last couple of days, giving you a full look at what to expect from the rom-coms, action thrillers, and horror sequels premiering shortly.\n'The Woman in Cabin 10'\nRelease Date: October 10, 2025\nA twisty mystery on a yacht awaits Netflix subscribers this fall, as Keira Knightley stars in The Woman in Cabin 10, an adaptation of Ruth Ware's best-selling novel. The Pride and Prejudice alum (pictured above in-character) plays a travel journalist named Lo Blacklock, who is pulled into a murder investigation after witnessing a woman getting thrown in the ocean. With no one from the cabin and crew taking her word into account, Lo takes matters into her own hands, seeking nothing but the truth. According to director Simon Stone in an interview with Collider, the protagonist in the upcoming Netflix film subverts expectations of the \"unreliable women\" typically seen in psychological thrillers.\n“Lead female characters have had a bit of a bad rap. It’s always the woman whose sanity we’re doubting. I wanted her to feel more like the lead characters from ‘70s paranoid thrillers — Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford, Gene Hackman in The Conversation. You never question them. You just believe they’re right. That’s what I wanted for Keira.”\nGet all the details about The Woman in Cabin 10 in our exclusive look.\n'Play Dirty'\nRelease Date: October 1, 2025\nMark Wahlberg and LaKeith Stanfield are ready to orchestrate a major heist in their next feature film, Play Dirty, and here's a first look at them as thieves.

In an interview with Collider for the site's exclusive preview, Bridges shared more about how the time jumps in the film help audiences keep up with the protagonists' dynamic.\n\"We used familiar milestones in people’s lives to help the audience get a feel for where we were landing in Simon and Laura’s journey. A work celebration. A wedding. A funeral. We didn’t want to be explicit with the timeframe, just suggest that time has passed since Simon and Laura last saw each other. People are smart, we knew they would work it out from the little clues we were giving in the dialogue or the situation we just dropped them in each time.\"\nGet all the details about All of You in our exclusive look.\n'Trust'\nRelease Date: August 22, 2025\nSophie Turner might've ascended to power as Queen of the North at the end of Game of Thrones, but she is now ready to face a whole new challenge in the upcoming thriller, Trust.

In Lawrence's words, he was drawn to this film given its heart-pounding narrative.\n“One of the aspects I liked the most about The Long Walk is the intimacy of the story set against this larger-than-life contest. We’re right there with the boys every step of the way, sharing their exhaustion, fear, and fleeting moments of hope. It’s a rare opportunity to make a film that feels both epic and personal, where the tension comes not just from the stakes of the walk, but from the relationships that develop along the way.”\nGet all the details about The Long Walk in our exclusive look.\n'Preparation for the Next Life'\nRelease Date: September 5, 2025\nPreparation for the Next Life will continue the streak of book-to-screen adaptations, presenting two characters whose paths cross in an unexpected way.

The director also shared what drew him to cast Powell for the lead role.\n\"Part of the fun for me was casting someone like Glen just before they’ve made the leap to full-on action icon. I kept thinking about who Bruce Willis was before Die Hard, he was only known to audiences as the romantic lead in Moonlighting. Glen is such a relatable, charming actor, and it’s fun to put him through the mill and see him spend the movie literally on the run. The whole film is more exciting with Glen being your everyman at the heart of the action. You see him sweat, you see him think, you keep him on his back foot for the whole adventure.

In an interview with Collider, Ansari revealed where the idea for his latest film came from.\n\"As far as the idea – films that deal with issues about economic depression are a staple from Grapes of Wrath to Trading Places. Given what’s happening these days, especially with all the modern elements involved, it felt ripe for us to do a film about today. I hope we pulled it off. I think we did?”\nGet all the details about Good Fortune in our exclusive look.\n'Wicked: For Good'\nRelease Date: November 21, 2025\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande) might've had their destiny laid out for them by the end of Wicked, but the sequel will continue to explore the characters' complex relationship with each other.

As part of this fall preview, screenwriter Tory Kamen told Collider what inspired her to come up with this story.\n\"When I started writing Eleanor, I thought about the different ways people lie to feel like they belong. I remember doing that as a kid, shapeshifting my way into cooler friend groups or pretending to like some awful band to impress a guy. Ideally, your sense of self kicks in, and eventually you stop bending to the will of someone else’s want. But I was curious what happens when that impulse follows us into adulthood, and the need to be chosen overrides authenticity. That’s what led me to a more unsettling question: what was the worst lie I could imagine coming from someone I love (in this case, my beloved and deeply unproblematic grandmother Elinore) and would I still love them anyway?\"\nGet all the details about Eleanor the Great in our exclusive look.\nStay tuned for what's in store next week as Collider exclusively debuts early looks at some of the hottest shows on TV this Fall.",
