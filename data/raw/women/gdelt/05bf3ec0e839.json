Today, the area is one of cultural and historical focus for Aboriginal people throughout NSW and Australia. People from many backgrounds live in Redfern-Waterloo and the most common languages spoken at home after English are Russian, Chinese, Greek, Arabic, Spanish and Vietnamese.\nVision\nTo establish Redfern-Waterloo as an active, vibrant and sustainable community by promoting and supporting greater social cohesion and community safety, respect for the cultural heritage and orderly development of the area in consideration of social, economic, ecological and other sustainable development.\nMinister's Letter\nThe Hon. Frank Sartor MP\nMinister for Redfern-Waterloo\nParliament House\nMacquarie Street\nSydney\nDear Minister Sartor\nIt is with pleasure that I forward you the second Annual Report for the Redfern-Waterloo Authority for the year ending 30 June 2006.\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with NSW Annual Report legislation and the Redfern-Waterloo Act 2004 No 107.\nYours Sincerely\nRobert Domm\nChief Executive Officer Redfern-Waterloo Authority\nStatement from the Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer\nWe have great pleasure in welcoming you to the second Annual Report for the Redfern-Waterloo Authority.\nAs part of the Government's 10-year vision for the revitalisation of the Redfern-Waterloo area, our first full year of operation has already yielded some exciting results.\nSince opening its doors in January 2005, the energy and commitment of the Board and staff of the RWA in undertaking our charter has been unwavering. Many initiatives are well and truly underway, particularly in the area of promoting investment and related job creation schemes for local unemployed, with a particular emphasis on training and employment for the Indigenous community.\nA highly visible community cooperation now exists that includes regular informative newsletters home delivered to residents, an interactive website, consultation on major issues, public forums, meetings, discussion groups and direct access to the RWA via phone, email and in person.\nFor the last six months of the reporting period, our efforts have been focused on finalising plans for the built environment and employment and enterprise, as well as driving and monitoring the implementation of Phase One of the Human Services Plan (HSP), which aims to improve outcomes for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged within our community.\nThe Human Services, Employment & Enterprise and Built Environment Plans are components of the overall Redfern-Waterloo Plan, which is currently being implemented as part of the Government's 10-year strategy.\nThe first stage of the RWA's Built Environment Plan is a key driver in the social and economic revitalisation of the area. Since the RWA's commencement in 2005, the NSW Government has directly facilitated the investment of nearly $300 million towards infrastructure development in Redfern-Waterloo. Of this amount, more than $76 million has been directly committed by the RWA.\nThe major investment includes a $35 million Indigenous youth centre at the former Redfern Public School, a $40 million contemporary performing arts space at the former North Eveleigh railyards, a $10 million community health centre at the former Courthouse/Police Station, $16 million for Aboriginal affordable housing, $6 million for a pedestrian/cycle bridge linking the ATP with North Eveleigh and $6 million for essential infrastructure works at the Australian Technology Park (ATP).\nIn June 2006, the RWA entered a landmark agreement with Sydney Broadcast Property Limited for the construction of a 43,500 sqm state-of-the-art media centre at the ATP. Under the agreement, the Seven Network and Pacific Magazines will relocate to Redfern within the next three years, along with other commercial tenants. This project represents the largest commercial development in Redfern for at least a decade and will deliver 600 construction jobs and 2000 permanent jobs. 60 of the construction jobs will be created for unemployed Aboriginal workers.\nA further 600 permanent jobs will be created at the ATP with the RWA's current $47 million construction of new premises for the National Information Communications Technology Australia (NICTA) and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). 26 Aboriginal jobs have also been created on this project, bringing the total to more than 120 construction jobs in the RWA's area of operation.\nThe RWA's job creation strategies are geared towards the local community being a major beneficiary of the urban renewal program, particularly the more disadvantaged sections of the community where unemployment and welfare dependency are major factors. The RWA's Employment & Enterprise Plan, released in May 2006, is a strategy designed to provide opportunities through meaningful training and employment, thereby addressing the root causes of social disadvantage.\nMinisterial Advisory Committees have been established to advise the Minister for Redfern-Waterloo on matters relating to built environment, employment and enterprise and the delivery of human services in the area and a full list of current Committee members is included in this report.\nWhile much has been achieved by the RWA in a short space of time, the Board and staff remain fully focussed on the difficult challenges ahead. We look forward with the confidence that momentum has been achieved towards building opportunities for the Redfern-Waterloo community.\nDavid Richmond AO Chairperson\nRobert Domm\nChief Executive Officer\nPrinciple Objectives\n- To encourage the urban renewal of Redfern-Waterloo into an active, vibrant and sustainable community;\n- To promote, support and respect the Aboriginal community in Redfern-Waterloo with regards to the importanceof the area to the Aboriginal people;\n- To promote the orderly development of Redfern-Waterloo whilst taking into consideration principles of social,economic, ecological and other sustainable development;\n- To enable the establishment of public areas in Redfern-Waterloo; and\n- To promote greater social cohesion and community safety in Redfern-Waterloo.\nOverview\nThe Redfern-Waterloo Authority (RWA) was created by a NSW Government Act of Parliament in Oct 2004 (Redfern-Waterloo Authority Act 2004 No 107) and established on 17 January 2005.\nThe RWA is responsible for revitalising Redfern, Waterloo, Eveleigh and Darlington through strategic urban renewal, job creation and improved human services in consideration of social, economic, ecological and other sustainable development, public spaces, Aboriginal community needs, social cohesion and community safety.\nThe principle objectives of the RWA are being delivered as a result of the NSW Government's 10-year Redfern-Waterloo Plan, which is designed as a \"whole of community\" strategy to address the complex issues of, and the needs of people who live within, the Redfern-Waterloo community.\nAs it is intended to be a \"living\" document that builds upon its earlier priorities and strategies, The Plan is being developed in stages, with ongoing community input a major component.\nFunction\nOrganisational Structure\nChief Executive Officer, RWA Managing Director, ATP\nInfrastructure Enterprise and Employment Community Relations\nOffice Management\nInformation Management and Technology Australian Technology Park Precinct Management Urban Renewal\nPlanning\nReforming Human Services\nIn order to achieve its vision, the RWA has undertaken to:\n- Promote, facilitate, manage, undertake and secure the social, economic, ecological and other sustainable development and use of the operational area, including the development and management of land, the provision of infrastructure and the establishment of public areas;\n- Provide and promote housing choices in the operational area (including for Aboriginal residents);\n- Provide and promote employment opportunities for local residents, commercial opportunities for local businesses and cultural development (including the needs of the Aboriginal community) in the operational area;\n- Enhance and manage public places in the operational area and to improve, maintain and regulate the use of those public places;\n- Promote, co-ordinate, organise, manage, undertake, secure, provide and conduct cultural, educational, commercial, recreational, entertainment and transport activities and facilities in the operational area; and\n- Do any other thing for the sustainable improvement of the operational area.\nCorporate Governance\n(see PDF version)\nThe Minister for Redfern-Waterloo, the Hon.

Frank Sartor MP invited Expressions of Interest from residents of Redfern, Waterloo, Eveleigh and Darlington to participate in any of three Ministerial Advisory Committees.\nThese Committees also consist of representatives from NSW government agencies and local Aboriginal communities and were set up to advise the Minister on matters relating to the development and implementation of the initiatives of the RWA.\nKey Strategies\nThe NSW Government's 10-year Redfern-Waterloo Plan comprises three major components:\n- Built Environment Plan -focusing on urban design, traffic, public access, public transport, land use, affordable housing, public housing, cultural heritage and urban renewal.\n- Employment and Enterprise Plan -developing and implementing strategies to increase job and business opportunities in the area, including within the Indigenous community.\n- Human Services Plan -reforming human services and health issues affecting residents of Redfern-Waterloo.\nBuilt Environment\nThe Draft Built Environment Plan (Stage One) was published in February 2006 and, along with the State Environmental Planning Policy (SEPP), is a landmark strategy providing a consistent set of controls relating to urban design, land use zoning or re-zoning and the carrying out of future development on eight RWA strategic sites:\n• Redfern Railway Station, Gibbons and Regent Streets\n• Australian Technology Park (ATP)\n• North Eveleigh\n• South Eveleigh\n• Eveleigh Street\n• Former Local Court House and Police Station\n• Former Rachel Forster Hospital\n• Former Redfern Public School\nThe Plan also identifies strategies for associated transport, traffic management, heritage protection,open space and public domain improvements, infrastructure provision, pedestrian and

The Minister has delegated consent functions for developments with a capital investment value of less than $5m.\nAustralian Technology Park (ATP) at the former railway workshops at Eveleigh falls under this jurisdiction. Formerly owned by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore\nAuthority (SHFA), ATP is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the RWA, with planned development on the site over the next two to three years expected to create more than 2,000 new jobs - a 20 percent employment increase for the Redfern-Waterloo area. Provision exists for six new sites and up to 14 additional buildings over the next decade.\nThe result of a $47m investment by the RWA, a six-storey building currently under construction - to be occupied by National ICT Australia (NICTA) and the Department of Defence, Science & Technology (DSTO) -is the first in a new development phase for the ATP.\nDesigned by Cox Richardson Architects, the building is located on the eastern edge of the ATP with frontages to Garden Street and Mitchell Way. It occupies a site of around 3,000sqm and will provide just over 11,000sqm of floor space with 66 secure parking spaces. Construction is in accordance with the RWA Jobs Compact, employing local indigenous people and new apprentices as a key element.\nIn June 2006, Sydney Broadcast Property announced a $120m investment to construct a 43,500sqm media centre at ATP primarily to house television production facilities and commercial offices for Channel 7 and their magazine publishing arm, Pacific Magazines. In a deal negotiated by the RWA, the project will create approx. 600 construction and 2000 permanent jobs. The largest commercial development in Redfern for over a decade, construction of the state-of-the-art media facility is expected to begin in early 2007 and completed by the end of 2008.\nThe RWA will also invest around $6m in new roads and infrastructure and a further $6m for a pedestrian and cycle link between ATP and North Eveleigh to facilitate access and future development. The Built Environment Plan proposes a second potential pedestrian/cycle bridge to the west of Redfern Station.\n\"This is a significant milestone in Australian Technology Park's development.\" Robert Domm CEO\nRedfern Public School\nThe RWA helped negotiate the purchase of the former Redfern Public School from the Department of Education and Training for the Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC) to establish a new youth precinct and showcase of indigenous culture.\nUp to $35m is being invested by the ILC in the project and plans include a 25- metre heated swimming pool and sports field and construction of multi-purpose classrooms, accommodation and dining facilities for up to 100 people. The Centre will also accommodate a number of established programs, including the Exodus Foundation, which will set up a tutorial centre for children aged 10 -14; the National Aboriginal Sports Corporation Australia, which runs a number of sporting and life development programs for Indigenous people; and the Lloyd McDermott Rugby Development Team, which provides opportunities for indigenous youth to become involved in rugby union, netball and golf. The existing Murawina Childcare Centre and four original school buildings will be refurbished.\nWhen fully operational, the NIDC is expected to help up to 5,000 kids a year. The redevelopment is expected to commence early in 2007 and be fully completed in 2009.\nCommunity Health Centre\nThe RWA brokered an agreement with the Department of Health to establish a new $10m Community Health Centre by way of adaptive reuse and refurbishment of the former Redfern Courthouse and Police Station The venture is co-funded by NSW Health, RWA and proceeds from the sale of the surplus Rachel Forster Hospital (rezoned for residential use). Services will include: health assessments and education, early childhood and family support services, counselling, referral, perinatal and family drug health services, mental health services, rehabilitation, welfare support, screening for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis, sexual health services and other community health services.\nRWA Training Centre, North Eveleigh\nThe former Canteen and Carpenters workshop building at North Eveleigh was identified as suitable for use as a training centre -initially for hospitality and construction.\nInitiated and funded by the RWA, the centre will provide industry based training linked to emerging employment opportunities for the local area including the Aboriginal community. The Centre is due to commence training\nand operating as an Indigenous and modern Australian cuisine café in October 2006 and will be known as Yaama Dhinawan (or 'welcome emu').\nThe establishment of the RWA Training Centre at North Eveleigh is a central component of the RWA Employment and Enterprise Plan.\nMarian Street Park\nIn response to community wishes, the area between Gibbons and Rosehill Streets in Redfern - commonly referred to as Marian Street Park - was zoned by the Government as \"public recreation\" with proposed landscaping poised to transform the site into a genuine park for future generations to enjoy. The RWA has proposed the open space be dedicated to the Council of the City of Sydney, subject to its commitment to upgrading.\nContemporary Performing Arts Centre\nA $40m transformation of the former Carriageworks building and Blacksmith's Workshop at the North Eveleigh Railyards into a new Contemporary Performing Arts Centre was undertaken by the Ministry for the Arts. With the\nsupport and assistance of the RWA, the adaptive reuse will generate significant new community and cultural activity and serve as a major impetus for renewal of the remaining areas of North Eveleigh. The Centre is due to\nopen in conjunction with the Sydney Festival in January 2007.\nBoard Member Profiles\nChair - Professor David Richmond AO BEc MEc (Syd)\nProfessor David Richmond AO is current Chairperson of the Redfern-Waterloo Authority, the Australian Technology Park and the Sydney Olympic Park Authority.

This includes responsibility for the maintenance of adequate accounting records and internal controls that are designed to prevent and detect fraud and error, and for the accounting policies and accounting estimates inherent in the financial report.\nAudit Approach\nI conducted an independent audit in order to express an opinion on the financial report. My audit provides reasonable assurance to Members of the New South Wales Parliament that the financial report is free of material misstatement.\nMy audit accorded with Australian Auditing Standards and statutory requirements, and I:\n• assessed the appropriateness of the accounting policies and disclosures used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Board in preparing the financial report, and\n• examined a sample of evidence that supports the amounts and disclosures in the financial report.\nAn audit does not guarantee that every amount and disclosure in the financial report is error free. The terms 'reasonable assurance' and 'material' recognise that an audit does not examine all evidence and transactions. However, the audit procedures used should identify errors or omissions significant enough to\nadversely affect decisions made by users of the financial report or indicate that Directors had not fulfilled their reporting obligations.\nMy opinion does not provide assurance:\n• about the future viability of the Authority or its controlled entities,\n• that they have carried out their activities effectively, efficiently and economically, or\n• about the effectiveness of their internal controls.\nAudit Independence\nThe Audit Office complies with all applicable independence requirements of Australian professional ethical pronouncements.\nThe Act further promotes independence by:\n• providing that only Parliament, and not the executive government, can remove an Auditor-General, and\n• mandating the Auditor-General as auditor of public sector agencies but precluding the provision of non-audit services, thus ensuring the Auditor-General and the Audit Office are not compromised in their role by the possibility of losing clients or income.\nDavid Jones\nDirector, Financial Audit Services SYDNEY, 20 October 2006\nDirectors' Statement\nStatement by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on the adoption of the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2006.\nCertificate Under Section 41 C (B) of the Public Finance and Audit Act 1983.\nPursuant to Section 41 C (B) and 1 (C) of the Public Finance and Audit Act 1983 and in our capacity as Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of the Redfern-Waterloo Authority, we declare that in our opinion:\nThe accompanying financial statements exhibit a true and fair view of the financial position of the Redfern-Waterloo Authority as at 30 June 2006 and transactions for the year ended on that date.\nThe Statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Public Finance and Audit Regulation 2000 and the Treasurer's Directions.\nFurther, we are not aware of any circumstances that would render any particulars included in the financial statements to be misleading or inaccurate.\nDavid Richmond AO\nChairperson\nRedfern-Waterloo Authority\nRobert Domm\nChief Executive Officer Redfern-Waterloo Authority\nSydney,\ndated this 20 October 2006\nFinancial Statements - See PDF version of annual report\nAppendices\nCharter\nThe RWA is formed under the Redfern-Waterloo Authority Act 2004.\nChief and Senior Executive Officer\nDuring 2005-06 Robert Domm was employed as Chief Executive Officer by the the RWA.\nStaff Numbers by Employment Basis\nPermanent Temporary Full-Time Part-Time Casual\nStaff 15 6 21 0 1\n% 68% 27% 95% 0% 5%\nMen 7 1 8 0 0\nWomen 8 5 13 0 1\nAboriginal Person or Torres\nStrait Islander 2 1 3 0 0\nPerson with a Disability 0 0 0 0 0\nPerson from a Racial, Ethnic or\nEthno-Religious Minority Group 0 1 1 0 0\nPeople whose first language\nwas not English 4 1 5 0 0\nStaff Numbers by Level\nMen Women Total\n$60,584 - $78,345 1 5 6\n$78,346 - $97,932 2 5 7\n>$97,932 4 4 8\n>$97,932 (SES) 1 - 1\nLegislative Changes\nThere were no changes to any legislation administered by RWA during the reporting year.\nOverseas Travel and Corporate Credit Cards\nNo overseas travel fares for staff were incurred during the reporting year, and as at 30 June 2006, staff of RWA were not issued with any corporate credit cards.\nCorporate Services\nThe Central Corporate Services Unit (CCSU) of the Department of Commerce provides a comprehensive range of corporate services.

This policy provides a process for RWA in how to better meet the needs of staff and community in relation to those people with disabilities.
