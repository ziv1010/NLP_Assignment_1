  "body_text": "Conversation with the New Mexico Congressional District 2 candidates\nThe 2024 Election Day is less than a week away and some New Mexico voters will be faced with choosing between two House of Representatives candidates: Gabe Vasquez and Yvette Herrell.\nHowever, Vasquez is the incumbent this time around after narrowly defeating Herrell by less than 1%, one of the closest races nationwide in 2022. The two are once again vying to represent Congressional District 2 in New Mexico.\nHerrell and other GOP members argue the redrawing of district lines played a role in her 2022 loss. That change came in 2021 when a new map was developed under a Democratic-led state legislature.\nThe redrawn map was signed into law by New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, also a Democrat. A trial in 2023 ended after a state judge ruled against a Republican party challenge of the new boundaries.\nThe district includes much of southern New Mexico, all the way up to the Albuquerque South Valley. More than 700,000 people in the state live within the district.\nAn Albuquerque Journal poll released showed Vasquez with a four-point lead over Herrell. But KOAT political expert Brian Sanderoff said this race is far from over.\n\"She tends to do better on Election Day than in the polls,\" Sanderoff said. \"This race is up for grabs, and I think voter turnout will ultimately determine the result of this race.\"\nIf Vasquez wins, he would be the first Democrat to be re-elected to the congressional district in more than 40 years.\nStay updated on the latest election news with the KOAT app. You can download it here.",
