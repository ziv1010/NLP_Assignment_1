It's very special to be on home soil, playing against so many different styles of play, and I can't wait for tomorrow.\"\nHer head coach Juan Chang Urrea, who has now guided Samoa to back-to-back finals and consecutive FIFA Under-17 World Cup berths, said his team has stayed committed and had self belief.\n\"We feel blessed to be here at home,\" he said.\n\"It's a double blessing to play in the final. Hopefully, we create a pathway for Samoa football.\n\"New Zealand is a tough opponent, so we have to bring our A game tomorrow.\"\nHe said the unity in his squad and their commitment to the plan deserves praise.\n\"Bringing our team together from different parts of the world is not easy, but the girls believe in what we do,\"he stated.\n\"All credit goes to them. We've had several camps this year, and it's great to see that investment paying off.\n\"For tomorrow, we are excited but also realistic. We are at home, but New Zealand is a tough opponent. We must bring our A-game.\"\nThe team's semi-final 5-0 win over Solomon Islands on Monday sent them into the OFC final and secured them a world cup spot next year.\nNew Zealand captain Amelia Hitchcock said the final clash will be tough.\n\"It's been really good, a really fun tournament,\" she told OFC.\n\"Playing in the final is going to be hard but we're up for the challenge.\"\nNew Zealand coach Alana Gunn said Samoa in the final will be a different challenge.\n\"The tournament's been great,\" the coach said.\n\"For this group of players, it's provided a good level of challenge on and off the pitch, which is always good from a development perspective.\n\"Obviously, there's a tough opponent in Samoa, looking strong through pool play. It's another timely challenge for these girls to test their resilience and ability to back up after a tough couple of weeks.\"\nThe final will be preceded by the third place play-off between losing semi-finalists Solomon Islands and New Caledonia.\nMeanwhile, Tahiti closed out their campaign in seventh spot, defeating American Samoa 2-0.\nIn another upset at the event, Tonga defeated Fiji 1-0 to claim fifth spot.\nIndia-May Mann sealed the win for Tonga with a 70th minute strike.",
