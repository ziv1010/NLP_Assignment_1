The Nations League Finals wrapped up June 18 with an exciting finish between the United States and Canada, with the U.S. being crowned champions. The exciting partnership between Concacaf and BMO was developed through an innovative strategic partnership between FIFA and Concacaf that includes the two organizations collaborating to market key international football properties in the region leading up to the FIFA World Cup 2026. The 2023 Gold Cup is underway, running through July 16 this summer and games will be held in several key BMO markets including Toronto (BMO Field), Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Dallas.

BMO has an excellent track record of investing in our sport, and we believe the significant regional and international platform provided by our tournaments will make this a partnership that is truly of mutual benefit, said Concacaf Chief Commercial Officer, Heidi Pellerano. I also want to thank FIFA for collaborating in our approach to BMO, which provides a very positive example of how we are working together to market the very best Concacaf football in the build up to what will be a tremendous FIFA World Cup in 2026.\nThe FIFA Womens World Cup 2023, meanwhile, will kick off a week later on July 20 and will feature the very best of the womens game on the greatest stage of all.\nBMOs Support of Soccer\nBMO is committed to making progress for an inclusive society by eliminating barriers to inclusion and driving equity in sport. BMO recently partnered with National Womens Soccer League (NWSL) team Angel City Football Club (ACFC). As part of ACFCs sponsorship model, the organizations reallocated 10 percent of the partnership into the community through a sponsorship of Girls Play Los Angeles (GPLA), where BMO is supporting over 400 high school-aged girls and non-binary youth across Los Angeles with no-cost access to soccer.\nThrough the banks partnerships with MLS teams CF Montréal and Vancouver Whitecaps FC, BMO supports the next generation of men and women professional soccer stars. In May 2023, BMO and CF Montréal announced that both organizations are taking another step forward in advancing gender equity in sports by introducing a womens program to the CF Montréal Academy. The bank has also partnered with Toronto FC to launch the Women in Soccer Fellowship, a first-of-its-kind in Canada initiative providing women unique on-the-job experience in coaching, scouting, player development, team services and medical, creating a direct pathway to increasing the number of women in sport.\nBMO has also invested over C$25 million to engage, develop and cultivate youth soccer at every level of competition across Canada since 2005, supporting 250,000 youth athletes in the sport. As a Premier Partner of Ontario Soccer, BMOs support of more than 100,000 girls is helping enhance gender equity in the game and helping create systemic change at all levels of soccer. Through community impact-driven partnerships like these, BMO is growing the game of soccer across North America.\n( Press Release Image: https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/307215/307215-1.jpg )\nWebWireID307215\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.
