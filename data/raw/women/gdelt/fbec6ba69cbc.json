On stage, he played the lead in the Olivier-nominated show, Agatha Christie’s Witness for the Prosecution, toured the UK in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and made his stage debut in the West End’s Billy Elliot: The Musical, aged 11.\nKaren Carney\nFormer England footballer Karen Carney OBE was the 14th person to be revealed.

I’m so excited to meet everyone and get dancing!”\nCarney was awarded an MBE in 2017 and an OBE in 2024 for services to association football.\nGeorge Clarke\nGeorge Clarke, a British YouTuber, podcaster and social media star, has said he’s prepared to “fall over a fair bit” as a contestant on Strictly.\nClarke, also known as George Clarkey to his millions of followers online, rose to prominence after sharing humorous skits and challenges on his TikTok account and YouTube channel.

To be told I had world-class qualities on the dancefloor today, even though we have to go home, that’s amazing to hear, so thank you very much. It’s given me such confidence,” he said.\n“To my partner Nadiya, I’m sorry. But it’s been an amazing journey, she’s been a brilliant teacher, I’ve developed so much, and it’s been a great ride – so thank you.”\nThe couple received a score of 24 for their Salsa during their last live show, placing them second to last on the leaderboard.\nStefan Dennis – WITHDRAWN\nNeighbours star Stefan Dennis was partnered with Dianne Buswell on the competition but was forced to make an early exit after sustaining a significant calf injury in week four.\n“Just when I had finally gained the confidence to do well with my dancing in the competition and achieve more great dances along the way, I was told that on Saturday I had torn my calf so significantly that I am now forced to withdraw from the show,” he wrote in a statement shared on 20 October. “I can’t tell you how devastated I am to have to leave so prematurely especially as there has been, and still is, so much love and support from everyone for both Dianne (Buswell) and myself.”\nDennis – who played the villain Paul Robinson on the Australian soap – had previously been unable to dance in an earlier episode of the dancing show due to a bout of vertigo.\nJimmy Floyd Hasselbaink – ELIMINATED\nDutch football legend Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, who currently works as an assistant coach for the England football team alongside manager Gareth Southgate, was the fourth contestant to be eliminated from the competition alongside his pro partner Lauren Oakley,\nHasselbaink has played for clubs including Leeds United, Atlético Madrid and Chelsea, earning a reputation as a prolific goal scorer.\nSince retiring, Hasselbaink has become a familiar face in football punditry in the UK, and has managed clubs including Burton Albion and Northampton Town.\nHasselbaink, 53, admitted the dancing competition will bring him “totally out of my comfort zone,” adding: “I have no idea what to expect, I have a little bit of rhythm.”\nHe added that appearing on Strictly would be more nerve-wracking than scoring goals in front of thousands each week, saying: “Playing football in front of 70,000 people is easy, but dancing in front of people and with a partner who knows it 100 times better than you, it’s crazy.”\nEllie Goldstein – ELIMINATED\nEllie Goldstein was the fifth contestant to be eliminated from the series, alongside her pro partner Vito Coppola.\nGoldstein made history in 2023 as the first model with Down syndrome to appear on the cover of British Vogue – and has also appeared in a campaign for fashion brand Gucci.

However, it’s such an amazing opportunity for me to step out of my comfort zone and to challenge myself in a completely new way and I just really hope I don’t make too much of a fool of myself.”\nLa Voix – WITHDRAWN\nRuPaul’s Drag Race UK star La Voix was the seventh contestant to be announced for Strictly’s 2025 instalment.\nLa Voix was awarded runner-up on last year’s Drag Race and quickly became a fan favourite.

All that's left to say is: good luck to my partner! Here's hoping they can help me go from La Voix into La Danse.”\nLa Voix is the second drag performer to compete on Strictly, following in the footsteps of Tayce, also a former Drag Race contestant, who won last year’s Christmas Special.",
