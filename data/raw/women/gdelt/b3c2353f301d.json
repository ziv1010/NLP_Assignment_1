  "body_text": "ColumnMatt Beard on Newcastle cup win, hard work paying off and Zara Shaw potential\nIn his latest column, Liverpool FC Women manager Matt Beard reflects on his side's 6-1 win at Newcastle United in the Women's League Cup and speaks about the potential of midfielder Zara Shaw.\nIt was a really good day for us at Newcastle and there were lots of pleasing things for me to take from it.\nWe got minutes into players who needed them and I was really happy for all of our front four who got a goal, with Mia [Enderby] netting two. That will do all of them the world of good because we've been getting into some good positions this season but we haven't been converting the chances.\nYou have to accept cookies in order to view this content on our site.\nWatch on YouTubeThere were lots of positives to come out of it and especially Zara Shaw's performance over 90 minutes. I mean, it was her first goal for the club and what a goal! She also got an assist, which was brilliant.\nSince she has come back from the U17 World Cup with England she has been fantastic. She has a spring in her step in training and added confidence and she has been doing really well and deserved this opportunity.\nZara is only 17 and I was really pleased for her and in terms of starting a game for us in the WSL, I do believe she is ready.\nI said two years ago that at 15 years of age I would've played her in the first team. In women's football, though, you have to be 16 before you can play at senior level. I have always said I will give young players an opportunity at this club.\nI was desperately disappointed for her last year when she got the ACL injury because she missed a year's worth of football when she probably would have broken into the team at that point.\nDespite the injury that she had, the dedication that she showed and the professionalism was fantastic. She has got a wise head on young shoulders. Unders [Chris Underwood] said she is a dream to work with.\nZara just takes everything in her stride and what I love about her as a player is she is always asking questions and always wanting to learn.\nI do think playing for the England U17s has given her fresh confidence, she had a good tournament and scored and we've benefited from that experience of the highs she had out there.\nThose moments are going to be invaluable for her and that will now give her the platform to kick on.\nI was really pleased for Kappy [Cornelia Kapocs] to score and get an assist as well with a wonderful pass for Mia.\nKappy is a fantastic player. She has had to be patient but in the 4-3-3 she has been great. I was really pleased for her, we know how intelligent a player she is and what a good finisher she is.\nHer attitude has been top-class, she's been a true professional. Yes, it has taken her a bit of time to adjust, but she is settled in now. The players understand her football brain because she sees spaces and uses her body well to create that little half-yard of space.\nIt was great to see Mia get a couple of goals and she was desperate to get the hat-trick.\nEveryone knows what I think of Mia and I tell her this all of the time. As she gets older she will learn when to give it and when to go, but you don't want to take her strengths out so the more games she plays and builds relationships with the players, the better she will be.\nIt’s just the little things that Mia will learn over time - she is such a fantastic talent and needed that confidence.\nNewcastle couldn't cope with the interchange and the movement from us and I said to the front players to enjoy the freedom and it was really good to see.\nNow we have the international break before our next game in the WSL away to Manchester United on Sunday December 8.\nWe will have a couple of days in this week. We've got 10 players away because Taylor couldn't go away with Jamaica, so the plan is we will keep topped up and do a bit of individual work with those who are in, then they will have a bit of time off.\nWe wish all of our international players all the best because there's some tough games. Ireland are playing Wales so it will be Ceri Holland and Gemma Evans against Leanne Kiernan and Niamh Fahey.\nAs always, we hope everyone comes back fit and healthy. Lawsy [Rachael Laws] should be back in contention for the Manchester United game after a slight issue with her knee, which is positive.\nFor us, the break has come at the right time to get Jas [Jasmine Matthews] back and Fuka [Nagano] can also have a well-earned rest as there is no Japan camp.\nLastly, I'd just like to thank every member of my backroom staff and, of course, the players after I received the Women's Manager of the Season at the Northwest Football Awards this week.\nIt is obvious but last season was a real team effort and that trophy is reward for everyone because it has been a real collective effort. I am the figurehead of the club as manager but it's never just about one person.\nIt's nice to be recognised for our achievements, but now our full focus is firmly set on kicking on this season.\nThank you for your continued support, as always.\nYNWA,\nMatt\nMatt Beard was speaking to Liverpoolfc.com's Steve Hunter",
