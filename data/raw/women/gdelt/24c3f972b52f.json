  "body_text": "Super Bowl Sunday returned to Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara for the first time since 2016. Our reporters and photographers covered the game and its surroundings, documenting security, crowd movement, transportation, protest activity and the on-field moments that decided the NFL championship.\nBelow is a chronological account of how Super Bowl Sunday unfolded.\n7:22 p.m.: Seahawks defense has a game for the ages\nThe Seattle Seahawks, with one of the all-time great performances by a defense in Super Bowl history, win their franchise’s second Lombardi Trophy by beating the New England Patriots 29-13 at Levi’s Stadium.\n6:59 p.m.: Seahawks close in on second Lombardi trophy\nA brutal throw by Drake Maye, intended for Kyle Williams, is instead intercepted by safety Julian Love at the Seattle 27. Five plays later, Jason Myers kicks a 27-yard field goal for a 22-7 Seattle lead.\nOn New England’s next series, a scoop and score by Uchenna Nwosu after Maye is sacked. Nwosu takes it to the house, and Seattle leads 29-7 with 4:27 to go.\nTurn out the lights!\n6:43 p.m.: Seahawks, Patriots exchange touchdowns\nThe first touchdown of the game comes with 13:24 left in the fourth quarter, as Seahawks tight end A.J. Barner beats Patriots linebacker Jack Gibbens to the corner of the end zone for an 18-0 lead for Seattle.\nOn the next drive, the Patriots offense shows signs of life, as Drake Maye finds Mack Hollins for a 35-yard TOUCHDOWN.\nThe Seahawks lead 19-7 with 10:40 left in the fourth quarter.\n6:24 p.m.: Seahawks fans start to feel pretty good\nSeahawks fans, who seem to represent about 75 percent of the crowd here, are starting feel pretty good about their team’s chances right now. Drake Maye and the Patriots’ offense have done next to nothing today against Seattle’s zone defense. New England has just five first downs, including two since the end of the first quarter, and 78 yards of offense after three quarters. The Seahawks lead 12-0, and after a turnover, have the ball on New England’s 26.\nOne concern: Seahawks leading receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba went to the locker room after concussion evaluation in the medical tent.\n5:35 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium … or is it Puerto Rico?\nThe halftime show continued on to include Bad Bunny handing a Grammy — of which he won three a week ago — to a young boy watching him on TV.\nBad Bunny gave fans another banger in “NuevaYol”, climbing up a power pole in his football uniform suit-and-tie combo and throwing it to fellow Puerto Rican Ricky Martin for a few lines.\nThe halftime show closed with one of Bad Bunny’s most recent hits, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” as he shouted out nations across Latin America and spiked a football to close things out.\nThe video screen at Levi’s Stadium read “The only thing more powerful than hate is love,” an apparent reference to ongoing immigration enforcement escalation across the U.S.\nLo único más poderoso que el odio, es el amor.\nThe Only Thing More Powerful Than Hate is Love. @sanbenito #AppleMusicHalftime pic.twitter.com/0VDQlSjet9\n— NFL (@NFL) February 9, 2026\n5:25 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium … or is it Puerto Rico?\nBad Bunny opened his halftime set in a sugarcane field on the playing surface at Levi’s Stadium with his hit “Titi Me Preguntó”.\nAs the show slowed down after a moment set on top of a small island-style house featuring Chilean actor Pedro Pascal, Bad Bunny gave the crowd a loud “Buenos tardes, California!” before an onstage wedding parted to reveal Lady Gaga singing her hit “Die with a Smile” recrafted with some added Latin flavor.\n5:11 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nThe Patriots kneel out a first half dominated by the kicking game: eight punts, three field goals and no touchdowns. Seattle leads by nine at the break. We’ll see if halftime performer Bad Bunny can add some more fireworks to the festivities than the teams on the field.\n5:07 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nJason Myers is the early MVP of this game. The Seahawks kicker nails a 41-yard field goal and puts the Seahawks up 9-0 with 11 seconds to play in the half.\n4:51 p.m.: Outside Levi’s Stadium\nDerek Fant, a Seahawks fan, was decked out in green and blue beads.\n“I’m excited. I’m stoked. Once in a lifetime experience, and this is my first. I’ve been a season-ticket holder for 23 years, but I’ve never been able to go inside the Super Bowl,” Fant said.\nAbout halftime performer Bad Bunny, Fant said: “I’m happy to see people that are excited for it. I really never knew that much about the young man, but I’m happy for him and happy for the Puerto Rican heritage that he brings to the table. So, you know, go Bad Bunny.“\nAbout the South Bay hosting, he said: “It’s been great so far, you know, and I think it will continue to be great. It’s a great opportunity to host. I mean, most people want to be involved in the game, but guess what? It’s still a great opportunity to host, and it shows your caliber of people or community and how you can represent the NFL.”\n4:32 p.m.: Outside Levi’s Stadium\nAngel Rodriguez traveled with his son and grandson across the country to the Super Bowl just to see Bad Bunny’s halftime performance.\n“We simply came because of Bad Bunny. That’s it. We don’t care about the Patriots. We don’t care about the Seahawks,” he said. “We love his stance on all things cultural and his stance on immigration. … We’re Puerto Rican. He’s Puerto Rican, so it’s not our problem. Nevertheless, he has taken a strong position, and we feel the same way.”\nAs to whether they hope he takes a political stance today: “I hope he would, but if he doesn’t, it’s fine. Maybe the place dictates that he doesn’t be that political, and I would respect that, but he’s done enough already throughout his career.”\n4:26 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nIt’s been quite a day for kickers and punters thus far. Another promising Seattle drive stalls out near the red zone, and Jason Myers nails one more short field goal, this time from 39 yards out, to give the Seahawks a 6-0 lead. 11:19 to play in the second quarter.\n4:18 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nThe first quarter comes to an end with Seattle leading New England 3-0. Mostly a defensive struggle so far with multiple punts on both sides. Patriots will have the ball at their 37-yard line to start the second quarter.\n3:47 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nThe Super Bowl officially kicks off as New England kicker Andy Borregales sends the opening kickoff over the head of Seattle return man Rashid Shaheed. Seattle quickly drives down to the New England 15-yard line and kicker Jason Myers nails a 33-yard field goal to give the Seahawks an early 3-0 lead. 11:58 remaining in the first quarter.\n3:33 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nYesenia Fonseca, a 17-year-old senior at Andrew Hill High School in San Jose, is one of three youth captains assisting with the coin toss for Super Bowl LX, representing Boys & Girls Clubs of America.\nFonseca, who has been awarded Youth of the Year four times by the Boys & Girls Clubs of Silicon Valley, plays flag football for both her school and the Boys & Girls Clubs.\n“I’m so excited that the Boys & Girls Clubs of Silicon Valley has been asked to be part of the Super Bowl because the club gives young people like me opportunities to build a bright future and participate in once-in-a-lifetime opportunities,” Fonesca told this news organization ahead of the game. “It’s like a second home; a place where I can meet new people, build new skills.”\n3:28 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\n11-time Grammy Award winning artist Brandi Carlile performed a rendition of “America the Beautiful.” She was followed by Charlie Puth, who sang the Star-Spangled Banner while standing behind a keyboard and being accompanied by a small orchestra.\n3:15 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nThe Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots have taken the field in preparation for their Super Bowl LX tilt. Jon Bon Jovi heralded the arrival of the Patriots, while actor Chris Pratt welcomed the Seahawks onto the field.\n3:10 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nBay Area rock legends Green Day performed a 4-song set of (mostly) upbeat and (often) abbreviated fan favorites. The setlist: Good Riddance (Time of Your Life), Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, American Idiot.\nOne of the most successful acts in Bay Area music history, Green Day was added to the event in January, with vocalist-guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong cheering the fact he could perform “right in our backyard.” Formed nearly 40 years ago in the East Bay enclave of Rodeo, the band has gone on to sell tens of millions of albums and amass five Grammy Awards.\nThe band did not use the forum to make any political statements. “Welcome to the Bay!” Armstrong said. “It’s Super Bowl 60.”\n3:05 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nThe celebrity sightings are mounting at the big game.\nJay-Z and his daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, were seen walking on the field less than an hour before kickoff. Elsewhere, rapper Travis Scott was seen talking to the owner of the Patriots, Robert Kraft.\nTheir appearances comes amid a week of celebrity sightings across the Bay Area for the nation’s largest sporting event. Already, Jason Kelce was spotted buying a tie-dye velvet coat at the Grateful Dead-inspired clothing store Love on Haight, shortly before hosting a party with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. (No, it doesn’t look like Travis’ famous fiancee, Taylor Swift, was at the party.)\nOn Friday, Shaquille O’Neill planned to host his Funhouse party at the Cow Palace with Miles Teller, Kristi Yamaguchi, T-Pain and Bay Area music legends E-40 and Too $hort. Elsewhere, Rob Lowe, Martha Stewart had planned appearances in the region, while controversial Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy appeared to be stopping in at San Francisco pizza restaurants in the Mission to offer his “One Bite Pizza Reviews” on Instagram.\n2:57 p.m.: Inside Levi’s Stadium\nThe pregame entertainment began about 40 minutes before kickoff, as Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter Coco Jones delivered a soaring version of “Lift Every Voice.”\n2:49 p.m.: Outside Levi’s Stadium\nA few fans arrived at Levi’s Stadium more concerned with teams not playing on Sunday.\nAndy Coronado, 62, of Stockton, has driven his Raiders bus to and from games since 2012 — even when the team relocated from Oakland to Las Vegas in 2020. He parked his bus outside of Levi’s Stadium on Sunday, excited at the possibility that Seattle Seahawks Offensive Coordinator Klint Kubiak might sign a contract to be the next Raiders head coach sometime after the big game.\n“The idea was for the Raiders to make a presence here and be seen,” he said.\n2:43 p.m.: Inside Levi’s Stadium\nSeahawks and Patriots players have now gone back into their locker rooms for final preparations before kickoff. Meanwhile, event staff have started preparing the field for pregame performances.\n2:40 p.m. Levi’s Stadium\nFans — both favoring Seattle and New England — are filling in Levi’s Stadium, less than an hour before the coin toss.\nInside the stadium, Tucker Gorman, of Boulder Creek, gazed down at the field while wearing his custom-designed jacket emblazoned with the words “The Doorstep of Destiny.” Elsewhere, a man who identified himself only as “Greg from Boston” was decked out in a Patriots foam hat and a red cape. He said he only decided to come to the game Saturday morning, and he wears the same accessories to every Patriots game.\n“I saw that ticket prices drop a little, and I said I gotta go,” Greg said. “I didn’t really trust this team early in the season, but I do now.”\n2:28 p.m. Santa Clara Convention Center\nTanya Bell, 54, and her daughter Beatrice Bell, 19, of Mountain View spent Sunday afternoon protesting ICE in front the of Santa Clara Convention Center. Tanya Bell called it the best way for them to get their message out, and stressed that “ICE has no place at the Super Bowl.”\n“ICE has no place anywhere,” Beatrice added.\n2:28 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nJust about everyone – and every species of animal – appears to be weighing in on their pick for the winner of Super Bowl LX.\nSeattle is considered 4.5-point favorites for the NFL’s 60th Super Bowl, the widest spread since the Los Angeles Rams were favored to beat the Cincinnati Bengals in 2022. Before that, the only other team favored so heavily by oddsmakers was the San Francisco 49ers in their 2013 tilt against the Baltimore Ravens. (We won’t linger too long on how that game ended.)\nLocally, there’s no shortage of opinions.\nPsychic medium Patti Negri recently communed with the spirits using tarot cards and dowsing rods at the Winchester Mystery House, a revered San Jose attraction. She came away feeling the Seattle Seahawks will have a fresh and chaotic energy, while the Patriots have a heaviness that could work for or against them.\nAt the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, a 2-year-old giraffe named Chich also appeared to increasingly favor the Seahawks – though not before initially wavering on that pick.\nFor his part, Bay Area News Group columnist Dieter Kurtenbach appears to agree with both of them, picking Seattle to put on “a clinic” and pulling away with a double-digit lead by halftime.\n2:15 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nThe Seattle Seakawks and the New England Patriots have announced their inactive players for the game.\nFor the Seahawks, QB Jalen Milroe, FB Robbie Ouzts, LBs Chazz Surratt and Jared Ivey, OT Mason Richman, TE Nick Kallerum and DT Brandon Pili are inactive.\nThe Patriots’ inactives are CB Kobee Minor, LB Bradyn Swinson, OT Marcus Bryant, OG Caedan Wallace, TE C.J. Dippre, WR Efton Chism and QB Tommy DeVito.\nDeVito and Milroe will be their respective teams’ emergency quarterbacks, allowed to play if necessary due to injury.\n2:14 p.m.: Outside Levi’s Stadium\nInoke, 35, and Siesia Tonga, 30, both of Salt Lake City, UT, showed up to the Super Bowl in full Founding Fathers outfits, featuring white powdered wigs and 1700s suits, to support their brother Khyiris Tonga, who is playing for the Patriots. Each carried a scroll with messages of support written on them.\n“We’re excited — it might be a once in a lifetime opportunity for him,” Inoke Tonga said. “So we’re just here to enjoy that. Hope that he has fun, and we just love watching him play.”\nFor the outfits, they “just wanted to have fun,” he added. They surprised him this morning before the game.\n“My plan was have my brother look up at the jumbotron and hopefully that we got on,” Inoke said.\n2 p.m.: Inside Levi’s Stadium\nSome people had a little extra reason to celebrate at this year’s Super Bowl.\nScott Weber — who turns 60 on Sunday — is working as an usher for the big game. He and his wife started ushering at SAP Center in downtown San Jose years ago as a way to see more sports. And when he found out Super Bowl LX was happening on his 60th birthday, he applied to work the game.\n“It’s a lot of fun,” said Weber, a lawyer by trade who was answering questions and providing directions to fans at Section 211. “It’s the best job you could have.”\n2 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nLevi’s Stadium got its own $200 million glow up ahead of its second Super Bowl.\nThe venue received enhanced Wi-Fi technology for the 2024 season and, a year later, video boards intended to give the stadium the largest 4K display in the NFL. Lighting over the playing service also was improved with an energy-conserving LED lighting system. Officials also upgraded the Levi’s luxury suites, a hallmark feature of the stadium.\nIt was all meant to get the stadium ready for a high-profile year of internationally-watched sporting events. Along with the Super Bowl, Levi’s Stadium will play host to six World Cup events later this summer – five in the group stage and one in the round of 32.\n1:52 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nPatriots and Seahawks players have taken the field at Levi’s Stadium to begin warming up for the biggest game of their lives. This year, there’s one player from the Bay Area who’s expected to participate: Former De La Salle and Stanford University standout – and current Patriots’ tight end – Austin Hooper.\nHe’s been on this stage before, having played in the Super Bowl nearly a decade ago with the Atlanta Falcons. This time he is “definitely smelling the roses more. … I don’t know how many years I’ve got left,” Hooper said this past week.\nHe’s also hoping for a slightly better outcome. Back then, his former team, the Atlanta Falcons, let a 28-3 lead slip to Tom Brady and the Patriots in the largest come-from-behind victory in Super Bowl history.\n1:40 p.m.: Outside Levi’s Stadium\nThe Rapid Response Network in Santa Clara County — which operates a hotline for residents to report suspected sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents — has yet to announce any confirmed instances of ICE agents conducting operations in the area. On late Sunday morning, the network posted on Instagram that the group “has not confirmed increased ICE presence in our area,” adding that “we remain vigilant and prepared.”\nConcerns of heightened immigration enforcement have loomed over the event.\nLess than two weeks ago, federal officials confirmed that the Department of Homeland Security would be involved in security for what stands to be the Bay Area’s biggest event in years, yet declined to detail what personnel or operations that presence would include. The agency is a mainstay presence at major sporting events, such as the Super Bowl. Yet this year, it garnered outsized attention for also overseeing agencies carrying out President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown campaign, including Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nOn Monday, around 100 community members rallied in downtown San Jose to protest the possibility of ICE agents heightening their anti-immigration campaign during the big game.\nAlso this week, Santa Clara enacted a last-minute policy ahead of the game to prevent federal agents from using city-owned property for immigration enforcement activities. City leaders also approved “ICE-free zones” mirroring those adopted across the Bay Area, from San Jose to Alameda County.\n1:27 p.m.: Levi’s Stadium\nThe Bay Area’s famously mild climate doesn’t appear likely to disappoint for the big game. Partly cloudy skies are expected at kickoff for Super Bowl LX, with forecasts calling for gametime temperature of 63 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. “The beginning of the game should be pretty nice,” said Sebastian Westerink, a National Weather Service meteorologist.\nTemperatures should drop throughout the game, settling in the mid to upper 50s by the time the confetti begins flying and the NFL crowns its next champion. The skies also are expected to get increasingly cloudy throughout the contest.\nThough a “weak little system” will likely push through the Bay Area on Sunday evening, there’s little chance of rain falling at the game, Westerink said. “Most of the Bay Area is going to stay completely dry from the system,” Westerink said. “It’s possible there’s some very spotty drizzle, but no measurable precipitation is expected south of San Francisco.”\n1:11 p.m.: Outside Levi’s Stadium\nFor some people, going to the Super Bowl is a once-in-a-lifetime trip. Other people, such as Jason McCall, are steely veterans of the nation’s largest sporting event.\nMcCall, of North Attleboro, Mass., is celebrating his ninth trip to the Super Bowl. On Sunday, he was there with his son, 19-year-old son, Dylan McCall, who was attending the big game for the first time.\n“(I’m on) cloud Nine,” Jason McCall said. “Can’t get much better than this.”\nThe duo wore Patriots jerseys and hats, one a fluffy American flag design, and the other a hybrid between a pirates hat and a football.\n“I’ve gone to quite a few (Super Bowls), so I like to have a little something,” Jason McCall said. “It’s almost like a superstition thing — you want to show out. You know what I mean? Because there’s no hiding who we’re here for.”\n1:10 p.m.\nLast-minute revelers may find it increasingly difficult to get to Levi’s Stadium in time for kickoff. Ahead of the game, traffic experts and local officials warned of a slew of road closures in and around the stadium, prompting one AAA spokesman to recommend motorists “just stay out of the Santa Clara region” if they want to avoid traffic.\nIn general, closures in Santa Clara include Great America Parkway between Bunker Hill Lane and Patrick Henry Drive, and Old Ironside and Old Glory Lane.\nSeveral street closures also are underway in San Jose, including eastbound San Carlos Street and southbound Market Street near the Convention Center.\n12:24 p.m.: Outside Levi’s Stadium\nTasman Drive near the stadium is a sea of fans heading toward Levi’s three hours before kickoff. Meanwhile, buskers entertain people in line playing drums with buckets.\n12:02 p.m.: Downtown San Jose\nValley Transportation Authority light rail trains headed to Levi’s Stadium from downtown San Jose are already packed, despite running three-car trains every 10 to 20 minutes. Fans of both teams appeared to be showing out in force, though Seattle Seahawks fans appeared to be slightly outnumbering New England Patriots supporters at the Bonaventura station in North San Jose.\n11:59 a.m.: Outside Levi’s Stadium\nAndrew Wergeland-Rammage, 35, traveled all the way from Seattle to watch the Seahawks play. Decked out in Seahawks gear, he even painted his foot-long beard half green and half blue in honor of his team. Even his drink was green.\n“I’m feeling, fantastic, amazing, phenomenal,” he said. “I did my beard blue and green. … I do it every Seahawks game.”\n11:45 a.m.: Outside Levi’s Stadium\nTal Winder, a 41-year-old resident of Lathrop but who lived in the Bay Area for 28 years and has been a Patriots fan for 30, is decked out in Patriots gear: a suit jacket with the Patriots logo repeating, a hat and face paint.\n“I’m from the Bay Area, so having your team in your backyard, this is something I had to go. I bought my ticket a couple of days ago. So I feel amazing,” he said. “I’m feeling excited, feeling like we’re gonna come out and win, obviously.”\n11:06 a.m.: Outside Levi’s Stadium\nGates to the stadium open, allowing in a flood of fans for the nation’s largest sporting event of the year. Just minutes earlier at a nearby pregame party, attractions include food, drinks and a bevy of merchandise stands. The attractions include a Captain Morgan stand styled like a boat, along with a botanical garden featuring women dressed in bedazzled floral dresses, along with a San Francisco cable car. Rival DJ booths repping the Seahawks and the Patriots are trying to drown each other out.\n9:23 a.m.: West entrance, Levi’s Stadium\nFans decked out in Patriots and Seahawks gear began to mingle near the entrances to the Super Bowl LX, while a heavy security presence could be seen across the area, including local police officers and FBI agents.\nA network of hundreds of law enforcement officers and security personnel – most visible, others harder to spot – are expected to fan out across the 1.85-million-square-foot venue and its surroundings Sunday to watch for potential threats. They’ll be supported by an untold number of surveillance cameras, drones and real-time technological hubs aimed at keeping attendees safe.\nAhead of the game, those preparations even included a low-flying Leonardo AW-139 helicopter equipped with radiation sensors.",
