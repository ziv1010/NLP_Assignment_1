  "body_text": "Ben Ainslie wins Battle of Britain\nPublished on February 19th, 2025\nSince the Royal Yacht Squadron was announced as the Challenger of Record for the 38th America’s Cup, the British team which represented the club for the past three editions had imploded. With skipper Sir Ben Ainslie and team sponsor Sir Jim Ratcliffe both now asserting separate entry into the next event, what was RYS to do?\nThat question has been answered with an update to the RYS website now reporting: “Athena Racing represents Royal Yacht Squadron – the British entry for the 38th America’s Cup led by Sir Ben Ainslie.”\nFollowing the break-up with Ratcliffe, under which the team had been named INEOS Britannia, Ainslie noted how his team would be known as Athena Racing going forwards, aligning with the British Women’s and Youth America’s Cup team, the Athena Pathway.\nSince the news broke on January 23, there has been little else said from the two protagonists, though Ratcliffe has been battered elsewhere in the news amid a sporting empire that also includes football, rugby, F1, and cycling.\nDetails: https://www.americascup.com/\nDefender New Zealand will work with the Challenger of Record from Great Britain to organize the 38th America’s Cup. Anticipated to be held in 2027, the two teams have agreed on some details with the venue to be confirmed by June 2025 after Barcelona declined hosting another edition.",
