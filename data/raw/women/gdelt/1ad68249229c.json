Leichhardt Oval is a place where the faithful can go along and cheer their local sporting teams, and this funding from all three levels of government will ensure that spirit is preserved.”\nAt a press conference on Friday morning, Albanese recalled fond memories from the stadium.\n“I grew up not far from here. I used to catch the 470 bus from outside Pyrmont Bridge Road, get off down the road and walk up on Wednesday nights to watch what was then the AMCO Cup and other sport,” he said.\n“We all have memories here. I have memories still. Very recently, I always walk along the hill there, the Tigers fans are passionate but they are generous. They get into you if you have got your Souths gear on, as they should.”\n“Here, you can feel the hits, particularly if a bloke like Steve Roach is making them. You can feel the ground move and that’s really important and it’s a part of that belonging that is vital,” Albanese said.\nThe New South Wales sports minister, Steve Kamper, said the investment would “future-proof” the stadium.\n“This funding will ensure the stadium can deliver fit-for-purpose facilities for the next generation of elite, amateur and grassroots athletes,” he said.\nRelated: Leichhardt Oval: Tigers add latest chapter to rugby league colosseum’s rich history | Angus Fontaine\n“Whilst Leichhardt Oval is the spiritual home of the Wests Tigers, this oval has become much more than that. It has become a true community hub and a home for women’s sport.”\nThe Inner West council voted on Tuesday night to dedicate $10m towards the upgrades. The mayor, Darcy Byrne, described it as a “commitment to saving the eighth wonder of the world”.\n“[This is] a crucial and significant step toward the rescue and rejuvenation of one of Australia’s most loved suburban grounds and a future hub of women’s sport in Sydney,” Byrne said",
