  "body_text": "Visitors arriving in Dubai during the Eid Al Adha holiday are being greeted by a special welcome stamp bearing the phrase \"Eid in Dubai\".\nThe motif features a unique design created by Brand Dubai, the creative arm of the Dubai Media Office.\nFor public and private sector workers in the UAE, Eid Al Adha this year is marked by a long weekend.\nEmployees have been granted leave from Thursday June 5 to Sunday June 8, with work resuming on Monday June 9.\nPublic and private sector staff in the Emirates are typically allocated the same number of public holidays each year.\nWhat is Eid Al Adha?\nEid Al Adha – which means “festival of the sacrifice” – is the latter of the two Eid holidays celebrated across the Arab world, coming after Eid Al Fitr.\nEid Al Adha commemorates how the Prophet Ibrahim was asked by God in a dream to sacrifice his son, Ismail, as a test of his faith.\nAs with other religious holidays in the Emirates, it is a time for friends and family to gather, often over meals, and reflect on their lives and faith.",
