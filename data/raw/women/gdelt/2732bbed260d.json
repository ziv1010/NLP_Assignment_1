Aarakau added her hat-trick goal soon after the break to seal a dominant win for Priscilla Tariga’s side.\nThe Cook Islands side had started the match well and created the opening goal scoring chance with Te Upoko Tuariki testing the goal with Mii Savage driving the play from midfield.\nBut playing into the wind proved difficult for Tupapa to retain possession and Henderson Eels were able to control the ball and threaten regularly down the left with Pegi a constant threat on goal.\nAfter continued pressure and a standout save from Tupapa’s keeper Rianna Pepe, Pegi finally broke through in the 26th minute putting her side deservedly in front.\nHenderson Eel’s speed in the midfield was epitomised by Lorina Solosaia and Pegi, and the team was rewarded with two rapid goals from Arukau in the 36th and 40th minute respectively.\nTupapa came out strong after the break, with the wind at their backs midfield, the side showed attacking intent early.\nBut in typical fashion, the Eels were lightening quick on the counter and a long ball found Arukau who added her third in the 60th minute.\nDespite some chances from Tupapa, led by Te Upoko Tuariki and Victoria Fatiaki, the Eels finished the game with a comfortable win in the opening match.\nArukau turned provider deep in stoppage time, her excellent cross from the left-hand side finished from close range by Agnes Gitoli to complete a fine opening day for the Solomon Islanders.\nHenderson Eels will face Ba Women FC in their second match on Wednesday (Tahiti time), whilst Tupapa Maraerenga will meet Ba Women FC on Saturday (Tahiti time).\nHenderson Eels FC: 5 (Ileen PEGI 27, Madeline ARUKAU 36, 40, 60, Agnes GITOLI 90+9)\nTupapa Maraerenga FC: 0\nHT: 3-0\nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz\nOriginal url",
