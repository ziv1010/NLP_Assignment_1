From Pontifex Maximus to the Great Generaliser\n[Catholic Caucus] Pope Francis: Rigid (traditionalist) priests lead immoral lives. From Pontifex Maximus to the Great Generaliser August 07, 2023 Pope Francis: Rigid (traditionalist) priests lead immoral lives. From Pontifex Maximus to the Great Generaliser Pope Francis meanly attacks priests who disagree with his idea of church.In ten years of Pontificate, the Church has undergone a real earthquake. The ministerial priesthood has become Francis' main target, and with each passing day, Bergoglio shows how impatient he really is. Many ask, 'but is he happy being a priest?' There is no Holy Mass or liturgical event where the Pope smiles. It... -\nPresident Ronald Reagan on an \"Alien Threat\" at the United Nations\nA snippet of President Ronald Reagan's address to the 42d Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, New YorkSeptember 21, 1987President Ronald Reagan's expresses desire for an Alien Invasion to bring us all togetherText of President Ronald Reagan's Entire Address of the United Nations 42nd Assembly -\nIS THE WEST LOSING FAITH IN ZELENSKY AND UKRAINE? A DISCUSSION WITH JUDGE NAPOLITANO\nJudge Napolitano kindly highlighted my recent piece discussing indications that the United States and NATO are preparing to jettison Ukraine and Volodomyr Zelensky. Here it is: Video interview Joe Biden and is team of national security hacks continue to double down in public on supporting Ukraine’s fight with Russia, but the Washington leak machine is up and running and the usual suspects in mainstream media outlets — New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal — are putting out more articles describing the failings and shortcomings of the Afghan officials — oops, I mean the Ukrainians. The United States... -\nUkrainian Refugees Fill Positions In North Dakota Oil Industry\nUkrainian refugees are filling open job positions in the shale patch of North Dakota, thanks to a humanitarian program, the AP reports, noting 16 Ukrainians have already started work in the shale patch and another 12 are due to arrive later this month.There are some 2,500 job vacancies in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota, which currently produces some 1.1 million barrels of oil daily.The output in the play peaked in 2019 at 1.5 million barrels daily and has been in decline since then.As of June, there were 38 drilling rigs in the Bakken but North Dakota’s mineral resources... -\nEuropean Companies Lost Over €100 Billion on Russia Amid War\nThe Financial Times estimates that European companies have lost at least €100 billion ($110 billion) since the Russia-Ukraine war began.

Naturally, energy-related industries faced half of those losses, followed by banking, chemicals, industrial, and automotive. BP, TotalEnergies, and Shell lost 40.6 billion euros due to the war, but the spike in energy costs helped them to post favorable earnings reports. Numerous European companies cited “asset impairments, foreign exchange-related charges and other one-off expenses as a result... -\nAnother New Nuclear Reactor Energizes U.S. Clean Energy Hopes\nThe U.S. brings a new Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactor online in Georgia, the first in 7 years, signaling a potential nuclear renaissance.Historical fears and incidents hindered nuclear development, but changing perceptions and energy needs have positioned nuclear as a clean energy solution.While challenges like high costs and lengthy development times persist, political support, funding, and improving public opinion could drive a resurgence in U.S. nuclear energy.Following the energy shortages of 2022, the U.S. has been racing to reinvigorate its nuclear energy sector. Long neglected, nuclear power appears to be making a comeback in the U.S., having gained funding and political... -\nCheering The Defeat Of The U.S. Women’s Soccer Team Is The American Thing To Do\nNext to the dictionary definition of “poetic justice” should be a picture of Megan Rapinoe’s humiliated little face after whiffing a penalty kick that helped seal the fate of the U.S. women’s soccer team.In a shootout that ended the game 5-4, Sweden defeated the U.S. Women’s National Team (USWNT), sending them packing from the World Cup.

To help maintain the illusion of independence, Joe Biden has recently declined to respond to questions about it when asked. But Biden’s past comments on this issue make it quite clear that Special Counsel Smith is actually doing exactly what Biden ordered. The New York Times reports (with emphasis added):The attorney general’s deliberative approach has come to frustrate Democratic allies of the White House... -\nHere's Why Legal Challenges to the 2020 Election Didn't Go Anywhere\nWhen the subject of legal challenges to election fraud or irregularities in 2020 comes up, Lefties love to sneer, “Oh, you guys didn’t win a single case.” In the most technical sense, they have a point, but that doesn’t mean they’re right. All one has to do is consider the abject partisan, corrupt collapse of America’s legal system at the present moment — a former president and 2024 frontrunner under attack by his opponent’s DOJ as well as little-league state DAs who literally campaigned on promises to “get Trump.” Clearly, Leftism has overthrown Justice as the goal of far too... -\nGreta Thunberg says she will no longer speak at a climate event, accusing a sponsor of greenwashing by investing in companies tied to the fossil fuel industry\nGreta Thunberg will no longer appear at a large Scottish book festival this week, saying she does not want to be \"associated with events\" connected to the fossil fuel industry.

Ron DeSantis on Tuesday completed the full-scale reboot of his once-promising presidential campaign, reassigning his campaign manager and elevating a loyal hand from his governor's office. The news comes just weeks before the GOP field will face off in the first presidential primary debate in Milwaukee, a chance to reverse a summer that has seen DeSantis, Trump's best-positioned challenger, slip dangerously far behind former President Donald Trump in national polling. Like every reset — DeSantis insists it's a \"reload\" — the real question remains on if DeSantis waited too long to execute the retooling. Past presidential cycles are... -\nBiden to name new Grand Canyon monument with nearly 1M acres of tribal land\nPresident Joe Biden will sign a proclamation on Tuesday establishing a new monument at Arizona’s Grand Canyon, protecting nearly 1 million acres of public land that some Native American tribes consider sacred grounds. . . .

Then, on election night, six major precincts — election outcome–changing precincts — stopped counting votes altogether. When you add in all the other evidence adduced in subsequent weeks showing fraud (including Biden's unbelievably soaring vote count long after the election ended), there was good reason to question the election. Mike Pence has now conceded that he believes he could at least have opened the path... -\nNAACP Wants Action Against Crime [semi-satire]\nCynthia Adams, president of the Oakland chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and Bishop Bob Jackson, Senior Pastor at Acts Full Gospel Church called for city leaders \"to crack down on rising crime, stop defunding the police, and prosecute lawbreakers. Our District Attorney's unwillingness to prosecute people who murder and commit life threatening serious crimes is hurting us.\" A spokesperson for the District Attorney for Alameda County, where Oakland is located, chastised Adams and Jackson, saying, \"we are disappointed that a great African-American pastor and a great African-American organization would take a false narrative... -\nElites attacking agriculture again: Let them eat bugs!\nSpecial presidential envoy for climate John (\"Effing\") Kerry recently took time out from flying around the globe in his private jet to warn the world that climate change cannot be conquered without first dramatically reducing the agriculture sector's emissions. Kerry asserted that agriculture production alone creates roughly 33% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions and argued that reducing those emissions must be \"front and center\" in the quest to defeat global warming.Giving the keynote address at the Department of Agriculture's \"AIM for Climate Summit\" on August 2, Lurch the former secretary of state said:A lot of people have no... -\nGetting it gooder and harder in the San Francisco Bay Area\nIn the Bay Area, the locals are being worn down by bums, chaos, drugs, assaults, and robberies, and yet still can't change their voting patterns. In the San Francisco Bay Area, we are seeing a lot of social media videos, both homebrew and news reports, of people responding to the breakdown of law and order with heartrending stories about what a nightmare they live in.
