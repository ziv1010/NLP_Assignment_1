Victory and the resultant three points will be awarded to the opposing team as well as the score of 3-0, or greater, depending on the score of the match.”\nThe release did not detail alleged breach.\nThe awarding of the points saw Federal United move up to fourth place in the league table, tied on three points with UWI Women.\nThe defending champions Frazsiers Whip and Los Perfectos are both on six points after winning their first two games. Cavalier SC are on four points in third place, while Arnett Gardens, Real MoBay, WiFi United, Mile Gully, and Proven Girls are all on one point.\nFederal United of the St Catherine Football Association had lost their first game and then had rallied from two goals down at half-time to earn a draw against Springers FC on Saturday.\nSpringers FC took the lead in the ninth minute when Jessica Harris’s shot was redirected by a Federal defender past goalkeeper Gabriel Hamilton.\nFormer national junior representative Fedricka Finnikin added a second after she wormed her way into the Federal United 18-yard box and fired past Hamilton in the 23rd minute.\nFederal United pulled a goal back in the 50th minute when Africke Beckford beat goalkeeper Samoy Jackson.\nYasheka Lewis grabbed a point for her team in the 56th minute when her left-footed curler from about 20 yards out found the top left-hand corner of the goal.\n— Paul A Reid",
