  "body_text": "—We’ve got an actual Louisville Cardinal sporting event tonight! The women’s soccer team will kick off the 2024-25 athletics season by hosting Bellarmine this evening at 7:30. You can watch live on ESPN+/ACC Network Extra.\nThursday afternoon Cardinal news and notes\nWatching Pat Kelsey press conferences is really the only way to spend your first moments in the world.\n—I’m on today’s Mark Titus Show talking about the return of Louisville men’s basketball being fun.\n—The Athletic’s Brendan Marks serves up some summer basketball power rankings for the ACC, and has Louisville at No. 3 behind only Duke and North Carolina.\n3. Louisville\nBiggest losses: Skyy Clark (13.2 ppg); Brandon Huntley-Hatfield (12.9 ppg, 8.4 rpg); Mike James (12.6 ppg, 5 rpg); Tre White (12.3 ppg, 5.9 rpg); JJ Traynor (10.1 ppg, 4.6 rpg); Ty-Laur Johnson (8.7 ppg, 3.6 apg); Curtis Williams (5.3 ppg); Kaleb Glenn (3.9 ppg)\nReturning rotation players: None\nTop 100 freshmen added (1): No. 34 Khani Rooths\nTop 100 transfers added (4): No. 17 Terrence Edwards Jr. (James Madison), No. 46 Chucky Hepburn (Wisconsin), No. 61 J’Vonne Hadley (Colorado), No. 70 Kasean Pryor (South Florida)\nWhy they’re here: Can you rebuild a whole program in a single offseason? We’re about to find out, with Louisville as the national test case. The Cardinals got rid of their coach, their entire roster and somehow still ended up with the most experienced and productive group of players in the ACC.\nPat Kelsey’s team leads the league in D-I minutes played, career made 3s and top 100 transfers added — but no one, obviously, has done anything in a UL uniform. Still, having five players with over 2,000 career D-I minutes, plus five who have made at least 50 career 3s, should be a boon for Kelsey’s 3-point happy offense. In Kelsey’s 12 years as head coach, his teams have finished in the top 75 in 3-point rate 10 times — including last season, when College of Charleston finished 17th nationally after taking 46.9 percent of its shots from deep.\nAmong the notable additions: Edwards, the Sun Belt Player of the Year who led JMU to a program-best 32 wins; Hepburn, an All-Big Ten defender and three-year starter; and Pryor, who led USF to 21 wins in 22 games last season after becoming a starter. This ranking is admittedly a gamble on Kelsey getting all the players to coalesce, but Louisville has the talent to make one of the biggest year-to-year leaps in the sport — and get back to the NCAA Tournament.\n—Jon Rothstein is not as much of a believer in the Cards, placing them at 11th in his summer ACC power rankings. In the write-up, Rothstein initially said Kobe Rodgers (who is redshirting) will be the first man off the bench for the Cards this season, so take this for what it’s worth.\n—Ashton Gillotte has been named to the watch list for The Rotary Lombardi Award, which is given annually to the college football player “who best embodies the values and spirit of NFL’s legendary coach Vince Lombardi.\n—Tyler Shough has been named to the Unitas Award preseason watch list.\n—Louisville vs. Nebraska on Sept. 22 will be the first regular season volleyball match ever broadcast on ABC. Pretty cool.\n—The “deterioration of depth” in college football seems like it will be a consistent thing moving forward.\n—Louisville does not have a player on ESPN’s preseason All-America squads.\n—LouCity FC hosts Charleston Battery in a battle to finish first in the conference this Saturday at Lynn Family Stadium in the club’s annual “Fill the Fam” game. Over 122K tickets have already been sold, and you can get yours for a discounted rate right here.\n—Here are BetOnline’s odd for who will lead the ACC in passing and rushing this season:\nThe Maurice Turner disrespect (or ignorance) continues. I also think, objectively, that Tyler Shough at 14/1 is one of the better value plays on that board.\n—The 2025 schedule for the Louisville Bats is out.\n—Louisville freshman running back Isaac Brown will be “tough to keep off the field.”\n—Bruce Feldman highlights Louisville as one of six preseason unranked teams that could crash the College Football Playoff.\nCoaches at multiple stops have gushed about quarterback Tyler Shough’s talent. The challenge has been keeping him healthy for a full season, but if that happens, the Cardinals, with Jeff Brohm running the show, will be dangerous. Shough, who turns 25 in September, has never been able to play more than seven games in a season over the past five years.\nThe Cardinals have to replace a pair of explosive running backs without Jawhar Jordan and Isaac Guerendo. There is unproven talent there in Maurice Turner, who also has great burst, and 220-pound Miami transfer Don Chaney. They also have to replace WR Jamari Thrash but picked up Alabama transfer JaCorey Brooks for 2024. Defensively, there are seven starters back, led by productive edge rusher Ashton Gillotte, LB T.J. Quinn and CB Quincy Riley from a unit that ranked No. 10 in the country against the run and No. 21 overall. The Cards schedule isn’t easy. They have road trips to South Bend and Clemson and play Miami sandwiched in between two other road games. But if Shough stays healthy, this team has the pieces on both sides of the ball to make a run at 10 wins.\nIowa State, Virginia Tech, UCF, Memphis and Boise State are the others.\n—The CJ discusses how Quincy Riley could be the next NFL-cornerback from Louisville.\n—Steward Mandel of The Athletic has a guide to all the changes coming to college football this season.\n—Eamon Brennan’s newsletter covers Pat Kelsey’s “existential rebuild” at Louisville. You have to be a subscriber to read the entire thing.\n—The Field of 68’s daily newsletter is also talking Louisville and Kelsey\n1. Louisville’s back! (Probably.) Now what?\nThere’s an unmistakable high that comes after blowout victories. Chests swell up, chins rise and there’s a swagger to a player’s walk.\nAnd it’s not just from the result. It comes from the perception of people around you and others you may not even know. Raise a few eyebrows with a few runaway victories and people notice.\nLouisville’s feeling that in the weeks after their foreign trip to the Bahamas. (Heck, we helped.) But the funny thing is, it’d make sense if these were the players from the last few Louisville seasons.\nIt’s not. Pat Kelsey has 13 new players on the roster (two of whom are redshirting in 2024-25), but he knows the fans and people around the program are extending that era of good-feelings onto the players.\nAnd therein lies the rub. You can’t put too much stock in a few summer blowouts. No matter how goods they felt to a hoops-proud program\n“Guys are going to look at their phones, and people are going to be telling them that they’re the greatest thing since sliced bread and they’re the ‘84 Lakers and things like that,” Kelsey recently told the Louisville Courier-Journal. “We’re going to be really good. We’re not good yet; we’ve got a long, long, long way to go.”\nFair enough. Still, the bones of a healthy, successful season are there. This is a team with NCAA Tournament-caliber talent, with impact transfers who appear ready to deliver on their promise.\nAs Rob Dauster and Jeff Goodman note in their Offseason Grades, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the Cardinals playing in March.\nWill they? It’s a long season, and Louisville’s schedule isn’t a cupcake filled with 300+ SOS sweet treats.\nTennessee’s on there. The Battle 4 Atlantis features three (likely) preseason Top 25 teams in Gonzaga, Arizona and Indiana, A-10 power Dayton, not to mention Power 5 programs Oklahoma, West Virginia and Providence. Ole Miss is on there. Kentucky’s on there. Then you dive into ACC play.\nBarttorvik projects Louisville at 16-12 overall and 10-10 in the ACC, which would place them directly on the NCAA tourney bubble.\nAfter the last few years in Louisville, would that be enough to count as a success in Kelsey’s first season? Or will some summer swagger elevate those expectations just a little bit more?\n—The CJ has three keys for Trinity to repeat as Kentucky’s Class 6-A football champion.\n—College basketball coaches weigh in anonymously on who they think will be the best player in the sport next season. Two ACC players rank in the top four vote-getters.\n—It appears as though the Cards are keeping things upbeat during the height of fall camp madness.\n—There’s a ton of enthusiasm surrounding U of L athletics as we prepare to head into 2024-25. The 502 Circle deserves a ton of credit for that.\n—Almost exactly a year after suffering a season-ending injury, Louisville safety MJ Griffin is grateful to be back.\n—Kelsey and Brohm are basically the same dude as far as being obsessed with their jobs and sports as a whole, so it’s no surprise that they have become fast friends.\n—Miami transfer Donald Chaney’s physical running style should pair well with the speed of guys like Maurice Turner and Isaac Brown.\n—Pro Football Focus ranks Ashton Gillotte as the No. 31 player in college football for the upcoming season.\n—CBS Sports has tabbed Gillotte as a preseason First Team All-American.\n—The ACCDN has Caullin Lacy as the 18th-best player int he conference heading into the year.\nQuincy Riley looks dead up like Teddy in that video.\n—U of L offensive lineman Pete Nygra says Cards’ QB Tyler Shough “can throw the rock, man.”\n—Despite a rough first preseason outing, Jack Plummer is enjoying his shot with the Carolina Panthers. Despite a rough fi\n—The city of Louisville enjoys watching sports on television, Exhibit 17,673:\n—ESPN’s final preseason FPR rankings have Louisville at No. 21 overall and No. 3 in the ACC.\n—Bill Connelly’s S&P Projections have the Cards at No. 31.\n—Could JoJo Stone be a wildcard for the U of L offense this season? This video builds some excitement for the highly-touted freshman.\n—Valhalla has been named as the host for the 2028 Solheim Cup. Nelly Korda might want to hire a driver.\n—Louisville vs. Notre Dame on Sept. 28 is officially sold out.\n—The Irish’s starting offensive line at the moment is looking awfully young.\n—Ron English says he is to blame for Louisville’s defensive struggles toward the end of last season.\n“Without depth, it shows up at the end of seasons, right?” English said. “It kind of showed up It kind of showed up in the middle of our defense last year with the linebackers and safeties.\n“But I felt that coaching was a part of it. I would say this: I don’t think we coached our best games against Kentucky and Southern Cal.\n“I think we played well for a half and then I think we kind of got rattled (against UK). The kickoff return (100 yards for a touchdown by UK’s Barion Brown) hurt us a little bit and we didn’t really choke them out as well as we had.\n“So I think we can coach better to be honest.”\nThe U of L players were not the only ones with work to do during the off season. English visited Phil Snow, former defensive coordinator of the Carolina Panthers. Snow coached English at the University of California and then worked for him at Eastern Michigan. English took another trip to Annapolis, Maryland to brainstorm with the staff at the Naval Academy.\n“If you can pick up one or two things, it’s good for you,” English said. “I’m talking about putting a scheme together where (the opposing offense) is off balance because most of the year they were.”\n—Brooks Holton answers some reader questions about Louisville basketball in his latest mailbag.\n—A Pittsburgh company is giving the KFC Yum Center a high-powered makeover.\n—And finally, the Mike Rutherford Show is rolling from 3-6 this afternoon on 1450/96.1 The Big X.
