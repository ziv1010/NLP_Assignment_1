Others find it “boring” (as Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal quipped when they attended the NBA All-Star Game here in February). Still others see it as crowded and swarming with annoying drivers. Some find the wintertime smog or the Republican stranglehold of state government as reasons to bolt.\nYet, for the rest of us, here we are, for better or worse, either as resident or visitor. How did we get here? Family? Friends? A job? School? Religious zeal? A ski vacation? A long airport layover? Maybe you were just born here. There must be a reason, right? Kismet?\nAt the risk of sounding like a real estate agent, Salt Lake, despite its quirks, has it all, from awesome outdoor recreation to unique historical/cultural attractions (naturally, Temple Square is No. 1—but it's undergoing major renovations at the moment, so pardon their dust).\nWe are home to notable events (Sundance Film Festival, anyone?), pro sports (the Utah Jazz basketball and Real Salt Lake soccer), dynamite shopping and entertainment malls, and diverse food and drink offerings that might seem beyond the ken of a Jell-O-loving people (but never underestimate the taste bud expansion of a returning Latter-day Saint missionary).\nSo how to align with the city's vibes? Here's what I would tell a friend.\n1. Look for a locally owned coffee shop and plant yourself there for an hour or two. You'll often find racks with free copies of our sister publication, City Weekly, that you can read to catch up on local news, events and shows. If the barista's not too busy, maybe ask for tips on nearby parks, shops and landmarks to discover.\n2. Find an indie bookstore or record store. We've listed more than a few in this publication, since such spots tend to be the culture keepers of our communities. Maybe the sales folks can help you find works by local writers or musicians that speak to Utah.\n3. Take a drive (or a hike) up one of the seven canyons of the Wasatch mountains. Our canyons are special places, bordering on sacred. Get out of the car, look around and suck in the clean mountain air. If this doesn't stir a bit of “wow” in you, then perhaps the SLC is not for you.\nWe find ourselves in a growing metropolis. Yet, in all the ways that count, Salt Lake is still a small town—one with a stunning scenic backdrop. And if you look for what you might enjoy in a small town (lunchtime concerts in the square, beer tasting at local breweries, tai chi in the park, Saturday morning farmers markets), you might feel you belong here, wherever you are in the Salt Lake Valley.\nLet this guide help you find a reason to settle in.\nJerre Wroble City Guide editor\nLet's Roll The good and bad of getting around on Utah transit. By Benjamin Wood\nUtah, like much of the American West, is car country. That worked OK for a long time—assuming you could afford to buy a car and perpetually fill it with gasoline—but population growth, climate change, cost of living and Utah's horrendous air quality have put enough pressure on the roads that even car-brained state leaders are beginning to acknowledge that, just maybe, “mistakes were made.”\nLuckily, we're not starting from Square 1. No, at minimum we're at Square 2, maybe even Square 3. Here's what to know about traveling without a car in Utah.\nGood: It's Free Downtown A “free-fare zone” exists around Salt Lake City's urban core, bordered by Salt Lake Central Station to the west, the Utah State Capitol to the north, the Main Library to the east and the Matheson Courthouse to the south. It doesn't help much with bus service (you'd have to be taking a pretty short trip) but it's handy for using Trax light rail to explore Main Street if you're already downtown. Maybe you want to get some shopping in after a movie or grab a bite to eat before a Jazz game? Leave the car parked—or the bike locked—and use the trains to make a night of it.\nBad: Lawmakers Hate “Free” The Utah Transit Authority (UTA) has run a number of free-fare initiatives, with things like airline boarding passes and concert tickets counting as transit fare. And in 2022, Salt Lake City pushed UTA to go fully free for the entire month of February. No surprise, these initiatives led to increased ridership. Gov. Spencer Cox called for a full year of free fares to study its effect on air quality and traffic congestion, but lawmakers were quick to shut down that kind of talk, lest it spread. “Nothing is free,” insisted Rep. Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, the No. 2 Republican in the Utah House. Following this statement, Schultz drove 45 minutes to his home along highways that were built at taxpayer expense on land ripped away from low-income, majority-minority residents, likely complaining about congestion the whole way.\nGood: There Are Trains to Get You Around The Trax Green Line is the best way to get to and from Salt Lake City International Airport, while the Red Line will run you up to the University of Utah (and Bonneville Shoreline Trail) or down south to the master-planned community of Daybreak. On the Blue Line, you can go hiking or mountain biking in Draper's Corner Canyon or connect to a regional FrontRunner train or Amtrak's cross-country train line, the California Zephyr, at Salt Lake Central.\nBad: Rail Is Poorly Planned and Largely Nonexistent FrontRunner follows the Interstate 15 corridor, connecting Salt Lake City with Ogden to the north and Provo to the south. But the decision-makers who built it 20 years ago had no clue and left the train with one hand tied behind its back. With only hourly service outside of weekday rush hours and no service at all on Sundays, FrontRunner is not for beginners and requires concerted effort and planning on both ends of the trip. Train stations have few, if any, amenities and limited, if any, shelter from the elements. They tend to deposit riders into a sea of park-and-ride surface lots, because the train was foolishly designed to be driven to. And if you're looking to go east or west away from I-15, you're simply out of luck. No trains exist outside the Wasatch Front.\nGood: There's an App for That Utah's transit network doesn't reward for spontaneity but there are ways to make it work for you. Thanks to funding from Salt Lake City, UTA recently began running high-frequency bus lines at 15-minute intervals, finally creating a limited number of routes for which schedule memorization is unnecessary. If you live, work, study and/or shop around those lines—and only those lines—you can experience true transit convenience. For other trips, the Transit app (transitapp.com) allows would-be riders to map their routes and purchase tickets. As this is not a UTA app, it works in many towns and cities you may happen to be in. It also provides live location tracking and notifications for when to deboard and what connections to make. Type in your destination and your starting point and the Transit app will show you a list of options with fairly accurate arrival time estimates. You can also text the ID number listed on your bus stop to 882-882 to see when the next buses serving that stop will arrive.\nBad: The Transit App Will Wipe Out Your Battery The Transit app will get you where you're going, but you might not have a working smartphone by the time you get there. Particularly with its “Go” feature activated—but even when it's not—the app uses a staggering amount of battery power as it tracks not just your location but that of the various buses and trains snaking their way around the valley. Use it for your first few rides, but make sure you pack a charge cord with you.\nShifting gears The best electric vehicle for Salt Lake City is a bike.\nTransit is great, and essential for many. But if you're looking to reduce or even drop your reliance on a private automobile, you might consider a bicycle, particularly one with an electric motor.\nWhen my Subaru Outback broke down in 2020, I relied on a cheap, single-speed fixie and found a new love for exploring the streets of my city. Rather than replace the car, I spent a fraction of the cost and bought an eBike, and now I can hardly imagine going back.\nIt's not just me. Rad Power Bikes (2107 S. 700 East, Suite B, SLC, 801-829-1892, radpowerbikes.com) responded to booming demand by opening a retail location in town last year, and powered models are increasingly taking up the floorspace of local bike shops. The city government is also developing a network of urban trails, increasingly allowing cyclists to avoid car traffic altogether and breathing new life into formerly dilapidated, traffic-choked neighborhoods by creating a more walkable and inviting environment for humans.\nMost of the trips people take in a city are fairly short—a few miles or less. Within that radius, the research—and my own experience—tells us that a bike will get you there as fast as a car. An eBike will get you there even faster, without the sweat, and there's no need to update the electrical wiring at your home: just plug it in and go.\nFor longer trips, bikes and trains are a perfect combination. You can take Trax uphill and ride your bike back down, and even the flaws of FrontRunner are mitigated when you can roll into and out of the train stations and get to your final destination in relatively short order.\nStart with the Jordan River Parkway Trail and Parley's Trail—Salt Lake City's de facto bike highways—and keep an eye on the ongoing construction of protected bike lanes on 300 West, 900 South and Highland Drive. From there you can take the painted bike lanes on surface streets to your destination, but stay alert—most roads are still designed to overtly prioritize car travel, with the city seeing roughly two deaths per month as a result of traffic violence.\nSalt Lake City's current mayor is a cyclist, and the city administration recently joined the Vision Zero network, in which cities commit to reducing traffic fatalities through inclusive design and safety interventions. Cycling in Salt Lake is already great, but it's about to get even better. —By Benjamin Wood\nPlay Your Card Right Medical cannabis is legal in Utah, so get (and keep) your card. By Cole Fullmer\nI tell every weed-consuming Utahn I meet to get their medical cannabis card. It's quite literally the smartest and most conscientious thing a plant-imbibing rebel can do for themselves and the community they love.\nFirst, you're protecting yourself from the long arm of local law enforcement. Residents need a state-issued medical cannabis card to join Utah's medical cannabis club and, more importantly, to avoid prosecution or arrest if holding.\nI found myself in a state of euphoria, and shock, when I received my cannabis rights during 2020. I always have weed on me and knowing I didn't need to look over my shoulder for the first time in 30-plus years took my breath away. I still feel this joy years later, making the “legal consumer” high the first tolerance-resistant buzz I've ever found.\nSecondly—and simply put—you're helping fight the good fight in Utah. Every card issued is like adding your signature to a ballot that says you're a Utahn who consumes and needs cannabis to be a better citizen. That goes further than you'd think on Capitol Hill. Did you know Utah legislators originally estimated we'd have only 10,000 medical cannabis patients—ever.\nWe are emerging into our third year of legal medical cannabis, and our state has more than 60,000 active medical cannabis patients utilizing the state's program. Sadly, we would have over 110,000 active patients if those getting cards weren't letting them expire. That's a lot of voters in legislator's eyes.\nLet's not forget about the cannabis workforce, too. At the beginning of 2023, the Center for Medical Cannabis reported there were a total of 451 pharmacy agents (budtenders) working at the 15 medical cannabis pharmacies found throughout the state. The Department of Agriculture reported there were 344 registered employees holding cultivation positions, while another 349 were working in processing labs. That's a total of 1,144 plant-touching, tax-paying employees in Utah.\nI've been turned away from the dispensary with a bad card before. Frankly, it can flat-out ruin your day. My card unknowingly expired when the first six months' renewal snuck up on me. Time flies when you're having fun, right? But those frequent clinic visits are a big reason why patients are saying they're not renewing their cannabis privileges.\nYou can't blame these men and women. The Utah Department of Health's program could be compared to making motorists visit the driver's license office multiple times a year—every year. Those other state-issued licenses that allow you to drive a 3,000 pound vehicle take 10 years to expire.\nWhile some Utahns are not renewing their cards, it doesn't mean they are not using cannabis anymore. It tells me we need to fix some things in order to move into a future that patients deserve.\nMore patients means fewer archaic state cannabis laws, more dispensaries, easier medical card sign-up, and a much larger industry creating jobs, money and medicine for all Utahns who need it. Just think, if all living in Utah who consumed cannabis got their card, how many legal voters would those on Capitol Hill need to be worried about. I'm guessing it's far more than 61,991 card holders we have now.\nCole Fullmer is the City Weekly cannabis editor who publishes the cannabis magazine Salt Baked City.\nNew to Utah? It helps to learn what makes Utah tick. By Katharine Biele\nKatie Dahl moved to Utah with a full-time job—one that pays nothing but offers incalculable returns.\nDahl's “job” is to get to know Utah—the good, the bad, the stunning beauty and less-than-pristine air. And she's getting to know its people, too. Coming from Colorado, Dahl knew that Utah would be different. Politically, Colorado has moved into the purple category, although not too long ago it was very Republican. What she found in Utah was a much smaller progressive community.\n”I'm getting to know a conservative state—and one that also really values the beauty of natural places,” she says. She wants to navigate both the political and cultural landscape. And she's not alone.\nUtah's population has been growing because of in-migration, and many of those “migrants” come without a history in the state. “The Utah Population Committee estimates indicate a total population of 3,404,760 for July 1, 2022, an increase of 61,242 new residents, slightly more than adding a new Herriman- or Taylorsville-size city,” the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute reported. “For the second year in a row, net migration drove most of the growth—62%.”\nKirtly Parker Jones came to Utah 40 years ago and never looked back. A professor emerita at the University of Utah Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jones and her husband, Chris, had known each other since they met in Denver at medical school. But her path to Utah was less than straight.\nHer first two years of life were in a mining camp in Mexico, after which she lived in Denver, Nevada, California's Bay area, Australia, back to Denver and, then, Boulder. Chris had been in graduate school in Maine, and she had a fellowship at Harvard, when they decided to find a place to land.\nThey flew back to Denver and began interviewing in big cities around the West—Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, Palo Alto, and, of course, Denver and Salt Lake City.\n”L.A. and Phoenix were out, but turns out we loved Salt Lake. It was not a big town, and it had a growing regional medical center,” she says. And while it was her husband's “turn” to choose a place, “there were two chairmen of neurology and OB-GYN who conspired to give us both a job.”\nThey bought a little red house in Emigration Canyon on a sunny, windy day and thought, “'This is the place.' We've lived here happily ever after,” she says. It didn't hurt that husband Chris has a longtime interest in wind and solar energy.\nWhile some transplants find the conservative LDS culture difficult to deal with, the Joneses felt welcomed and supported. “I was stunned by the civility of the city. Boston can be kind of rough and tumble. Here, there's no pushing and shoving people with groceries, and particularly the drivers are civil.”\nTo her, “These are people who love their families. We share the same values in many ways,” she says.\nJones remembers her secretary coming to her when the floods hit Salt Lake. The secretary offered to get her LDS ward to help the Joneses evacuate, if necessary. “You negotiate it with civility,” Parker Jones said. “People have different religious and political beliefs. ... There are times that drive me a little crazy. But Salt Lake is a large town that feels like a small town—you can't go anywhere without seeing someone you know. It's just part of being tribal. Whose values do you want?”\nDestination Utah became a reality for Dahl when her husband, Gavin, took a job with KRCL 90.9 FM. Katie had been working at FairVote, whose website calls it “a nonpartisan organization working for better elections for all. We research and advance voting reforms that make democracy more functional and representative for every American, with a focus on two key reforms: ranked choice voting and the Fair Representation Act.”\nWith a master's in political science, she joined Fair Vote four years ago and worked as manager of strategic partnerships by the time she left. “One of the things I studied was international media ... influence in media and health of media in democracy,” she said.\nWhat did she notice about Utah from the start of her time here? “People are starting to wake up to the problems of the Great Salt Lake,” but she doesn't see a concerted movement to clear the air, a problem that's perceptible and pernicious—and that should be doable, she says.\nOne of the first things she did was check the nonprofit job board, and then she began a focused effort to get to know the city and its people. “A lot of people think networking is a challenge,” Dahl says. “I find it enjoyable.”\nShe has even created a spreadsheet of people she meets and others from her husband's contacts. “It's about shaking the trees when you're coming to a brand new state.”\nThere have been lots of interesting conversations. “People are friendly and willing to share their perspective of how Utah works. Coming from politics and the advocacy world, it's helpful for me to start to brainstorm what role I have.”\nShe's had plenty of advice from both sides of the aisle. For instance, Dahl talked to Stan Lockhart, a lobbyist and former chairman of the Utah Republican Party. His advice?\n”Follow your heart. Find people who are trusted advisers. Everybody has to find their own tribe, but you can have more than one tribe. And start finding ways to expand your reach.”\nWays to Take Action Do your civic duty.\nJoin your neighborhood community council. Check out your city's website to find where your ‘hood is and which council is advocating for it. This is a great way to get to know your neighbors and the elected officials who are making the rules. Also join the nextdoor.com website. It will place you in your larger community and keep you up to date on events, crime and lost dogs. It's mostly non-political but allows you to connect with people nearby who can help you with everything from snow removal to finding a dentist.\nThe League of Women Voters of Utah is a nonpartisan group that's been around since 1920 when women first got the vote. The league is open to men and women who believe in defending democracy and empowering voters. You can join at a local level to help at naturalization ceremonies and participate in candidate forums. lwvutah.org\nBe sure to watch for the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics forums. During the school year, they touch on a wide range of political issues around the world and are open to the public in-person and virtually. hinckley.utah.edu/calendar\nSalt Lake Indivisible is an action-oriented group, harnessing grassroots energy and teaching people how to create change through active participation in our democracy. saltlakeindivisible.com\nStop the Polluting Port is working to prevent the proposed “Utah inland port” from causing harm to our air, water, land and people. facebook.com/StopThePollutingPort\nUtah Physicians for a Healthy Environment (UPHE) is dedicated to protecting the health and well-being of the residents of Utah by promoting science-based education and interventions that result in progressive, measurable improvements to the environment. uphe.org\nO2 Utah: Their motto, “For the air we breathe, the landscapes we love and the future we deserve,” introduces you to doing volunteer work to conduct citizen lobbying at the legislature and help draft legislation for bold environmental policy. o2utah.org\nUtahns Against Hunger has been working to increase food access through advocacy, outreach and education. They have long been behind an effort to eliminate the tax on food and to expand the reach of nutrition programs in the state. uah.org\nCrossroads Urban Center For more than 50 years, the center has advocated for the underserved in a variety of ways. They run one of the busiest food pantries in the state, they support a charitable thrift store, and they organize advocacy groups—any of which you may want to join: the Coalition of Religious Communities, the Community Housing Advocacy Project and Powerful Moms Who Care. You can't really volunteer with Crossroads, but you can donate to the cause. crossroadsurbancenter.org —By Katharine Biele\nDriven to Drink Yes, you can get a drink in Utah, but it helps to know the rules. By Jerre Wroble\nJust think how strange it is to live in a state where a group of Latter-day Saint lawmakers (i.e., teetotalers) gather on Capitol Hill every legislative session to make all the big booze decisions and come up with truly bizarre ways to “tax the sinner”? Over the years, lawmakers have tried everything from making restaurants install a curtain that bartenders had to work behind so that children wouldn't see how drinks are made to requiring that establishments post cheap paper signs by their doors alerting the public as to whether they are a “bar,” “tavern” or “restaurant.”\nIf the place is a bar or tavern, everyone 21 and older has to show a valid form of ID that is then scanned and digitally captured before they can enter the premises. No minors are allowed inside. But once they've run that gauntlet, customers can get right into drinking and don't have to order food before buying a drink.\nIf the place is a restaurant, diners must tell the server they are planning to order food before the server can put in their alcoholic drink order. IDs for all imbibers will then be checked, even the IDs of silver-haired folks.\nThe dumb signs have gone away, but the rules still apply.\nIt's All About Control In case you didn't know, Utah is one of 18 states that tightly controls alcohol sales, rather than letting private enterprise run the show. Can you spell “monopoly”? The Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Services is the only game in town. The policy decisions on licensing, regulating and sales of alcoholic beverages are made by seven part-time commissioners who are appointed by the teetotaling governor. Part of their mandate is to protect citizens, especially kids, from being exposed to alcoholic beverages.\nThat's why, every year, it seems, there is some new hoop for restaurant and bar owners to jump through so that nondrinkers who enter their realms will not be offended (or fascinated) at the sight of a bartender shaking a martini or blending a daiquiri. That's why we are driven to drink!\nIn truth, while Utahns do tend to whine about the Legislature and liquor laws, most anyone of legal age can easily get served an adult beverage if only they pay heed to the following:\nWhat day is it? Bars can be open daily but some close early when it's slow and/or some close all day for certain holidays to give their workers a day off. Package liquor stores are closed on Sundays and federal/state holidays.\nWhat time is it? Bars may serve all types of alcohol from 10 a.m. until 12:59 a.m. Taverns may sell beer from 10 a.m. until 12:59 a.m. Restaurants can serve alcohol from 11:30 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. on weekdays, and from 10:30 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. on weekends. Most package liquor stores are open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday. You can find store locations here: abs.utah.gov/about-dabs/find-a-store\nWhat if it's after hours or a Sunday? There are many ways to have a drink after last call. You can buy beer that's up to 5% ABV at grocery, gas and convenience stores. (But note that wine and higher-point beer can only be purchased at state liquor stores.) On Sundays, just go to a bar and order a drink, or to a restaurant, and order drinks with food. You can watch a movie at Brewvies Cinema Pub and order drinks with or without food. You can also purchase beer and spirits to-go when you visit a brewery or distillery, and many are open on Sundays. At some hotels that offer bar service, you can purchase alcohol from the front desk after they check IDs.\nCocktail Lessons The legal maximum liquor pour is a metered 1½ ounces (so, no free pours unless you're at a private party). But the workaround is this: A mixed drink may include 1½ ounces of primary liquor and another 1-ounce secondary pour from a “flavoring” bottle. The flavoring must be different from the primary liquor. Thus, a margarita made with 2½ ounces of tequila is a no-go, but one made with 1½ ounces of tequila and 1 ounce of Cointreau is a possibility (if the Cointreau is marked as a “flavoring”).\nOther Utah Quirks • At restaurants with exposed bars where drinks are made, minors will need to be seated at least 10 feet away from the bar area.\n• No matter your age, you have to show a valid ID at the state liquor store. Valid IDs are Utah driver's licenses, state ID cards, military ID cards, driver's licenses from other U.S. states and passports. (Note: the international driver's license is not consider a valid ID.)\n• Utah liquor stores do not sell mixers so in order to buy tonics, seltzers, soft drinks, etc., you need to go to a convenience or grocery store. Liquor stores also don't sell any fun alcohol-laden products like spiked Jell-O shots or boozy whipped cream.\nUtah Is: • The only U.S. state not to sell mini-bottles.\n• The only U.S. state to impose the strictest alcohol blood content at 0.05% (most states are 0.08%). So, under no circumstances should you drive after more than a couple of drinks or beers. Even one drink might be too many to drive depending on your metabolism. Go with a designated driver, use public transit or call a cab or uber. Be forewarned, on slow nights, police park outside or down the street from bars to make easy DUI arrests.\nTalk Stars To get in the know about all things Utah, follow these social (media) butterflies. By Benjamin Wood\nKeeping up with all the buzz in the Beehive State can be a daunting task. But if you know the right people, podcasts and political entities to follow, you'll never feel left out at the water cooler.\nFox13 Reporter Ben Winslow: on Twitter @benwinslow It's hard to say whether Twitter was made for Winslow or Winslow was made for Twitter, but either way no local news personality can compete with his dominance on the medium. From live reports on the drama at Capitol Hill to music recommendations and local fashion shout-outs, Winslow's feed is a media outlet in and off itself.\nInsta-Historian Rachel Quist: on Instagram @rachels_slc_history With her mix of eye-opening archival photos of yesteryear, bite-sized history lessons on notable buildings and places, and gentle encouragement for civic engagement, it's little surprise why Rachel Quist has amassed a following of 10,000 and counting. What you might not notice on first glance, however, is how that followers list includes local media outlets and journalists, political folks and even government agencies.\nSalt Lake Tribune Cartoonist Pat Bagley: on Facebook The death of traditional newspapers has been a heavy blow to the ranks of political cartoonists, so it's a small miracle that one of the best in the business calls Utah his home. A repeat Pulitzer Prize finalist, Bagley demonstrates a skill at capturing political oddities and the bizarre characters who shape it that is simply unmatched within the state. The trolls and drama drove him from Twitter, but you can still follow his work on Facebook and in The Salt Lake Tribune.\nCity Cast Salt Lake: Podcast Recently voted “Best Local Podcast” by City Weekly readers, the all-women team behind City Cast puts out a slick audio newsletter on the people, places and things that make Salt Lake City what it is. One day might showcase a lesser-known effort to document fox squirrels on the west side, while the next sees a heated debate on the latest state-level controversies, all presented in a tight, digestible runtime that gets you caught up and ready to go each weekday morning.\nKendall Rodriguez: on TikTok @queenofslc For those who prefer the TikTok style of content-by-firehose, one way to cut through the clutter is by following Kendall Rodriguez, the (unofficial) Queen of SLC. Here, you'll find a one-woman glossary of things to do, places to go, people to see and food to eat. It's the Queen's city—we all just live in it.\nBuilding Salt Lake: buildingsaltlake.com Salt Lake City—and the broader Wasatch Front—is rapidly urbanizing, and that's a good thing. More and more, once-obscure phrases like “18-hour city,” “walkability,” “mixed-use density,” “transit-oriented development” and “accessory dwelling unit” are entering the public conversation. And if you're unfamiliar with any of the above, fear not—Building Salt Lake is here to help. With a tight focus on local construction trends and a clear-headed embrace of new urbanism, BSL will change the way you look at the world around you and have you talking like a zoning nerd before you can say “missing middle housing.”\nX96's “Radio From Hell”: Online and at 96.3 FM The undisputed champions of Salt Lake City morning radio, this trio of Kerry Jackson, Bill Allred and Gina Barberi has been tellin'-it-like-it-is and helping us to laugh through the pain for decades.

Tune in!\nExplorer's Guide Where to go when you want to ....\nPeople-Watch Salt Lake City doesn't have a Central Park, Times Square or Grand Central Station like in the Big Apple. But it does have its own hip and laid-back gathering spots. On a sunny Sunday morning, for instance, downtowners might bring a coffee, croissant and a fresh copy of The New York Times to a picnic table at Liberty Park (600 E. 900 South, SLC, slc.gov/parks/park-division/liberty-park) and take in the sights of the city's oldest public park. Its 110 acres provides shade trees, flowers, lakes, playgrounds, rides, paddleboats and the expansive Tracy Aviary and historic Chase Museum. Fitness lovers flock to the walking and jogging trails as well as the tennis, basketball and volleyball courts. On Sunday afternoons, you can catch the beat of a drum circle and, throughout the seasons, you'll find festivals, races and car shows.\nTwo blocks east from Liberty Park is the walkable 9th and 9th neighborhood (900 E. 900 South, SLC), now bookended by a life-size breeching whale sculpture in rainbow colors. Here, the chic shops, eclectic eateries and a neighborhood bar beckon downtowners and visitors alike, while the many sidewalk tables offer a great way to see and be seen.\nMeanwhile, the city's malls, including the posh City Creek Center (50 S. Main, SLC, 801-521-2012, shopcitycreekcenter.com) and historic Trolley Square (602 E. 500 South, SLC, 801-521-9877, trolleysquare.com) buzz with shoppers, diners and fashionistas. The Gateway (400 W. 200 South, SLC, 801-456-0000, atthegateway.com) has established itself as a dining and entertainment hub, known for hosting local events, concerts and festivals.\nTo really connect with your fellow city dwellers, wake up early on Saturday mornings for the weekly Downtown Farmers Market (Pioneer Park, 300 W. 300 South, SLC, 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.) or attend festivals that speak to your interests, such as the Utah Arts Festival, the Greek Festival, the Utah State Fair and even City Weekly's own Utah Beer Festival (Aug. 19-20). And bars like Gracie's (326 S. West Temple, SLC, 801-819-7565, graciesslc.com) and Whiskey Street (323 S. Main, SLC, 801-433-1371, whiskeystreet.com) were designed for the ultimate in people watching. — By Jerre Wroble\nSeek Peace and Calm For too long, downtown Salt Lake has had too much “space” on its hands. We had very few tall buildings (we dare not call them skyscrapers). We had a ton of vacant lots and surface parking lots. The streets were built extra wide so that a team of oxen pulling a wagon could turn around “with room to spare.” Not only was there lots of open space downtown, but the humans pretty much cleared out after work hours. Because we don't live “on top of each other,” like in other metro cities, you might say that we're a peculiarly peaceful people.\nBut that's changing. Office towers and apartment buildings are springing up like daisies all over downtown and along transit lines throughout the Salt Lake Valley. High-density is the new mantra. More people live, work and play in the Salt Lake Valley than ever before. We're booming. It's good that Salt Lake is coming of age but maybe the tradeoff is the peace and ease of life? Fear not, here is a small list of quiet refuges, and there are many more out there:\nShuuush! Most people will say the public libraries of Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County are the No. 1 indoor spaces to restore your calm. In particular, the Main Library downtown (210 E. 400 South, SLC, 801-524-8200, slcpl.org/main-library). It's open seven days a week, and it not only offers quiet nooks and crannies where you can work, read and ponder, but also beautiful views within and outside an architecturally unique building. And the reading material can't be beat.\nBut sometimes, only a church with beautiful stained-glass windows can provide the comfort and peace an overstimulated soul needs. The Cathedral of the Madeleine (331 E. South Temple, SLC, 801-328-8941, utcotm.org) is open daily from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. with a busy schedule for mass, confession, vesper and benediction, rosaries, weddings, baptisms, funerals and more. Built in 1909, the cathedral, with its Neo-Romanesque exterior (think gargoyles), is the only one in the U.S. under the patronage of St. Mary Magdalene. No, you don't have to be Catholic to step inside, but do be respectful of any church services that may be taking place. And feel free to donate to the church while you're there.\nWhen you need peace, why not go to a park with “peace” in its name? The International Peace Gardens (801-938-5326, internationalpeacegardens.org) is located along the Jordan River within Jordan Park (900 West and 1000 South, SLC). The garden is one of only two peace gardens in the U.S. To date, local members of 28 countries have designed and landscaped gardens that represent their cultural heritage. Due to recent vandalism at the gardens, some displays are not as complete as they once were. But you can still catch the good vibes of those who've worked hard to “give peace a chance.”\nTo have your soul stirred by a world-class choir at no cost, wake up early on Sunday morning and head down to Temple Square (50 N. Temple, SLC, 801-240-8945), to catch Music and the Spoken Word courtesy of The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square. Visit thetabernaclechoir.org to confirm location of performance, either at the Conference Center or the Tabernacle. Doors open at 8:30 a.m., and you should be seated by 9:15 a.m. for the 9:30 a.m. worldwide broadcast.\nFor those who can only find peace and calm in nature, read on. —By Jerre Wroble\nHike Nearby Mountain Trails Lambs Canyon Escape SLC's concrete jungle to a dense canopy of close-standing aspen and pines on this secluded trail off Parleys Canyon The first mile is moderate, but then the trail gets steeper as switchbacks raise you from lush ferns and wildflowers to a more open forest of evergreens. On your left is a bubbling stream that you hear, but rarely see and never cross. The trail is shaded most of the day, but still gets hot by noon on most summer days. It's 2 miles to the crest of Mill Creek ridge at 8,115 feet—a perfect spot for lunch-before retracing your steps back to the trailhead for a 4-mile round-trip. Total elevation gain is 1,500 feet. To access Lambs Canyon, take exit 137 on I-80 and follow East Lambs Canyon Road 1½ miles south to the trailhead parking. Roads open and trail accessible mid-June to early November. No dogs allowed.\nGrandeur Peak For adventure close to home, hike to the summit of this 8,299-foot mountain with expansive views of the Salt Lake Valley—and maybe even your neighborhood—far below. Challenging but doable for most weekend hikers, the most popular route starts just inside Mill Creek Canyon. The 5.9-mile out-and-back trail gains over 2,300 feet in meandering switchbacks as it circles a broad valley. As the trail tops out on the Mill Creek crest, take a rest and gaze down into Parleys Canyon to the north. The final stretch swings around the south side of the summit before reaching the top where flat rocks make for a well-earned lunch stop. Spring and fall are the best times to hike this peak, because summer sun can bake the last few unshaded miles. Winter hikers should bring spikes and trekking poles, especially for the final push over bare rock below the summit. The Grandeur Peak trail begins at the north end of the Church Fork picnic area, 3.2 miles from the mouth of Mill Creek Canyon. If the limited parking at the trailhead is full, find overflow spots along the road, which adds 0.4 miles to the total trip. Mill Creek Canyon requires a $5 day-use fee or $50 annual pass. Dogs are welcome, but they must be leashed on even days. —By Jason Stevenso\nClippity-Clop Down a Trail In 1969, American actor Robert Redford bought the Wasatch mountain forest land that would become Sundance Mountain Resort. Redford envisioned a space where art, community and natural preservation would come together. He held true to his vision to create a unique environment for outdoor adventurers and Sundance Institute filmmakers. In 2020, Redford sold the resort to new owners who seem to share his vision. Though he may no longer be the resort's figurehead, I can happily report that Redford's spirit lives on at Sundance Stables.\nWhether for a first-time rider or a distinguished equestrian, Sundance Stables has captivating options. Open to the public are four distinct and truly unforgettable horseback trail experiences. Limited to parties no larger than six, a serene and personal getaway is promised, with private tours also offered. The Elk Meadows trail is best suited for newer riders; vibrant yellow and green aspen groves lead into alpine meadows, creating the perfect environment for riders seeking something soothing and approachable.\nMost popular, the Stewart Falls ride brings you through the Wasatch mountains with spectacular views of waterfalls, mountain faces and dense forests. Make conversation with your cowboy guides or listen to the clopping hooves of your newest companion. Want to get out of the heat? Look into the Sunset Ride. Beginning at 6:30 p.m., the evening ride is an opportunity to embrace cool gusts of mountain air and a more nocturnal community of forest critters. The “Yoga and Horseback” experience is a spiritual getaway designed to ease riders into a peaceful state of mind and an appreciation for life.\nIf you are visiting for a weekend or are fortunate to live within driving distance of Provo, do yourself and your family a favor and book a ride at Sundance Mountain Resort, 8841 N.

We love our dogs here, and we've got some great places to take them.\nFor traditional city-style dog parks, check out Herman Franks Park (1371 S. 700 East, SLC, 801-972-7800, slc.gov/parks/parks-division/herman-franks-park) on the east side, Pioneer Park (350 S. 300 West, SLC, slc.gov/parks/parks-division/pioneer-park) downtown and Cottonwood Park (300 North 1645 West, SLC, slc.gov/parks/parks-division/cottonwood-park) out west. Those are the main, fully fenced dog parks in the city's portfolio, but smaller off-leash areas exist—both formally and informally—at parks like Fairmont, Rotary Glen, Jordan and many others (visit slc.gov/parks/salt-lake-city-off-leash-dog-areas for more information).\nFor a more rugged experience, explore the multiple acres of off-leash area at Parley's Historic Nature Park (often mistakenly called Tanner Park) (2740 S. 2700 East, SLC, slc.gov/parks/parks-division/parleys-historic-nature-park/)—with popular stream access points perfect for cooling off hot paws—or upper Mill Creek Canyon, where dogs and their human companions are permitted to hike leash-free on odd-numbered days (“Odd Dogs” in case you forget).\nOnce your furbaby is back on their leash, use routes like the Parleys Trail (S-Line), the Jordan River Parkway Trail, the 9-Line Trail and the McClelland Trail to get around the city. —By Benjamin Wood\nBask in the Setting Sun Salt Lake City has one of the most beautiful backdrops of any city in the country. Majestic mountains and a beautiful cityscape lend themselves perfectly to sunset watching at scenic locations throughout the valley.\nUndoubtedly, the best way to catch the daily dying of the light is heading up the mountains—but if you aren't in the mood for an hours-long trek up Mount Olympus, the best bet is to hike the short, well-worn path to either Ensign Peak, high above the Capitol, or Jack's Mailbox Peak near the iconic H-rock overlooking Highland High School on the east bench.\nIf you are averse to a little exercise, don't fret! You can still catch some beautiful views from the comfort of your car.\nThe most popular spots are up in the Avenues, around 11th Avenue Park, particularly looking west on Chandler Drive, but if you are wanting something a little less trafficked, then up on Benchmark Drive on the east side of the city, the silhouette of downtown is framed stunningly.\nOf course, there are some equally impressive places to catch those fading rays at lower elevation. Some of the clearest views are out west where you can not only catch the sunset but also SLC's famed alpenglow—the occasional purple-ish hue of the mountains that occurs as the sun drops near the horizon. Despite the nearby power plant, one of my favorite spots is on the Archie and Lois Archuleta Bridge (1206 W. 200 South, SLC) in Poplar Grove, which you can access from the Jordan River Trail near North Temple.\nLiving in SLC, you are never too far away from awe-inspiring views even while you are living your day-to-day life—whether it be popping out of a store, enjoying a meal on a patio or just hanging out in your backyard. —By Bryant Heath\nVisit Salt Lake Oddities Salt Lake City boasts some outstanding attractions, to be sure. Downtown, Temple Square is steeped in history; the Natural History Museum of Utah near the University of Utah is spectacular for its exhibits and views; and nearby Hogle Zoo invites you to see animal species from all corners of the earth. But if you're looking for something unsung and a little different, here are 10 of my favorite curiosities and random sightings.\nSummum Pyramid—Located on a side street up against Interstate 15, this 26-foot-tall pyramid serves as a sanctuary and temple for a rather peculiar religious group, the Summums. The history and the stories about this sect—mummification! wine making! Supreme Court battles!—are just as eccentric as the beliefs. 707 W. Genesee Ave., SLC, 801-355-0137, summum.us\nUtah Women 2020 Mural—The mural scene in Salt Lake is exploding, with large-scale street art appearing on brick building exteriors and garage doors all over the valley. Be sure and catch this massive work directed by artists Jann Haworth and Alex Johnstone on the east side of Dinwoodey Building downtown. It features more than 250 local trailblazing female figures, both past and present. An added bonus, turning to the south, you get a glimpse of Utah Jazz basketball history in cartoon-form, courtesy of artist Trent Call. 37 W. 100 South, SLC, womensmural.com\nVictim of the Beast Gravestone—Born in 1881, died in 1958, Lilly E. Gray's grave marker bears this creepy inscription: “A Victim of the Beast 666.” Unsettling, much? The story that's been pieced together by her relatives isn't quite as macabre: Lilly died of natural causes, and the inscription was the work of her strange second husband. Nonetheless, it's still worth a visit. Salt Lake City Cemetery, 200 N St., Plot X, Block 1, Lot 169, Grave 4 East, SLC, slc.gov/parks/city-cemetery\nGallivan Center Sundial—Gallivan Center is home to artist Kazuo Matsubayashi's impressive sculpture-sundial entitled “Asteroid Landed Softly.” This piece, installed in 1993, is chalk-full of symbolism, and it's unique among sundials as it uses a light gnomon (versus the more popular shadow gnomon) to indicate various cycles of time. This incredibly layered sculpture will bring new insights with each visit. 201 S. Main, SLC, 801-535-6110, thegallivancenter.com\nGilgal Sculpture Garden—The oddest of Salt Lake City parks, Gilgal is a hidden treasure tucked behind houses and businesses in the east central neighborhood. The sculpture garden was the brainchild of Thomas Battersby Child Jr., and the pieces exhibited are just as interesting as the history. “The Sphinx”—which depicts a mash-up of a bust of Joseph Smith with the body from the classic Egyptian statue—is the most well known of the 12 sculptures, but there are others that are equally head-turning. 749 E. 500 South, SLC, 801-972-7860, gilgalgarden.org\nLabyrinth—Just outside the northeast corner of the U of U's Carolyn Tanner Irish Humanities Building is a fairly impressive labyrinth with a clovered center—all are welcome to meander around in it. If you want more puzzles to solve, look for other labyrinths scattered throughout the city, such as the one off the Jordan River Parkway Trail. University of Utah, 215 Central Campus Drive, SLC\nFun Time Kidz Kare—A building that has left its mark in internet infamy, Fun Time Kidz Kare has been the subject of numerous online conspiracy theories. It seems to have been just a normal daycare, but the oddly designed exterior and seeming few number of kids observed at the center have given rise to strange tales—not to mention merchandise! (etsy.com/shop/HouseofCattitude). As of press time, the building was being painted and the grounds landscaped, so the business may be undergoing changes. 1248 S. 300 East, SLC\nJazz Sculpture—Forget Stockton and Malone, nothing says Utah Jazz basketball like the Roma-ruin-like abstract sculpture on the north side of the Vivint Arena. This steel triad—titled “An Urban Allegory” by artist Neil Hadlock—harkens back to the time when the arena was first known as the Delta Center in the early 1990s. It represents the rebuilding of Salt Lake's west side (the two columns) and celebrating athletic achievements (the torso). 301 S. West Temple, SLC, saltlakepublicart.org/art/an-urban-allegory-63\nLone Cedar Tree—As the legend goes, when the pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, the area was bereft of trees with the exception of a lone cedar. The settlers took it as a divine sign to settle here. A monument was erected by the Daughters of Utah Pioneers in 1933 to commemorate this tree and, allegedly, it contained a slice of the original. After vandalism, the monument is a shell of its former self, leaving just a stone pedestal housed beneath an underwhelming gazebo. 600 East between 300 South and 400 South, SLC.\nSteenblik Park Dairy Cats—Residents of Rose Park—especially those with overly protective dogs—are most familiar with the large bronze dairy cat statues located at the Joseph F. Steenblik pocket park. These four felines were created by sculptor Day Christensen as a nod to the Steenblik Dairy that once operated there in the early 1900s. 1000 W. 800 North, SLC, saltlakepublicart.org/art/dairy-cats-25 —By Bryant Heath\nBuy Locally Designed Clothes Lonely Ghost's mission is counterpoint to its own name: Its clothing is designed to promote the human connection. Three and a half years ago, Bronson Christensen and Indy Blue Severe combined their prowess to create something unique, inclusive and full of heart. The key phrase “I love you—say it back” (as seen on the corner of 800 East and 800 South in Salt Lake) underscores every design of their cutting-edge streetwear. LG maintains that it's cool to care, and hundreds of thousands social media followers agree.\n”It's more than just clothes,” Christensen says. The pair are not solely creating affordable, fresh fashion, but rather a fresh way of conducting themselves in a phone-obsessed world. Even with their powerful social media presence, LG encourages intimate, IRL interactions. The book club is the most recent example of how the LG team fosters human-to-human interaction, but it has always been the company's purpose. The Lonely Ghost Pen Pal Club was established in 2020 during the height of isolation. More than 4,000 participants have established close relationships from all over the planet, spanning from Egypt and Turkey to Salt Lake City with fresh entries every day.\nEtched into the walls at The Shops at Riverwoods in Provo is Ghost Grocery (4801 N. University Ave. Ste. 650, Provo, 385-221-3629). Dressed as a small grocery store, Lonely Ghost has now established their first retail space: a worldwide attraction, and a head scratch for some visitors looking for name-brand cereal. This experiential shop combines the attraction of a ‘60s funhouse with LG's brand of intoxicating attire. Checkered floors, milk cartons, SpaghettiOs and photo albums filled with Polaroids will make you forget that you're in a clothing store and remind you that we're in a completely new era of fashion—an era where friendship matters. lonelyghost.co —By Caleb Daniel\nFind an Underground Rave/Dance Party Blaq Void throws Utah's biggest parties, hands down. Finding the party is where things get trickier. Word of mouth between fellow nightlife enthusiasts is the most common vessel for discovering Blaq Void. Venues don't promote Blaq Void's parties, as they're never held in a real venue to begin with. Blaq Void's Instagram and website announce their next event a week or two in advance. Day of, they will announce a code word to text their phone number for the address and tickets.\nBlaq Void's events live in the realm of raves, featuring innovative light shows, inspired DJ sets, all genres of dance, and most importantly, a crowd of 450+. These raves are found in locations as mysterious as the entity itself. Industrial kitchens, boats, basements and rooftops join warehouses as acceptable places for the 4 a.m. functions. Themes have also made appearances, with the most recent being a Rage Cage party, where the DJs are caged in the middle of the dance floor, while the biggest game by the same name you've ever seen commences on the peripheral.\nThe Blaq Void's “cult” is mysterious. Since the first event four years ago, a sense of “other” is shared among the community, with dozens of dedicated members proudly inking themselves with the Blaq Void's iconic logo. If the Salt Lake City scene hasn't scratched your itch of dancing in unique environments to the strongest up-and-coming DJs, text “Void” at 435-344-4495 to join the cult. —By Caleb Daniel\nGet Medical/Mental Health Care When Uninsured The Children's Center of Utah When the kids aren't all right, the Children's Center Utah can provide low-cost, trauma-informed mental health therapy for infants to preschoolers (ages 0-6). Housed in the historic Oquirrh School building a block northeast from the SLC Main Library, the center provides in-person and telemedicine visits that can include parents, caregivers, and siblings in diagnosis and treatment plans.

Cox signed, HB467, which ends licensing for Utah abortion clinics after May 2, forcing them to close either by year's end or when their licenses expire—whichever comes first. (Note: At press time, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have filed an injunction against the licensing law.) Still, abortion is currently allowed in Utah (up to 18 weeks of gestation) while a trigger bill that would outlaw most abortions in Utah is challenged in court. Should the Utah abortion ban be upheld by the courts, you can search for providers in nearby states at AbortionFinder.org or check with Planned Parenthood (see listing above) for more options. Psst... the Utah Abortion Fund can provide logistical support for people seeking abortions.\nUtah Abortion Fund With abortion access in Utah threatened (and maybe gone by the time you are reading this), the efforts of the Utah Abortion Fund are more essential than ever. Supported by private donations, the fund provides financial and logistical support for people traveling to and from Utah seeking safe abortion care.

By Babs De Lay\nOur previous neighborhood roundups have looked at local housing trends, attractions, bookstores, coffee shops and the hipness/coolness factor that makes each Salt Lake neighborhood unique and appealing.\nBabs De Lay, a longtime Realtor and regular City Weekly columnist, is quite familiar with the lay of the land. But for this year's City Guide, she decided to take a different approach. Being a history buff, she looked at historical markers in the Salt Lake Valley's cities and towns and focused on them to help tell their stories. Knowing how these communities came into being gives residents and visitors alike an appreciation for the remnants of buildings and landmarks they encounter while hiking trails, driving through older parts of town or visiting local museums such as the Daughters of Utah Pioneers (300 N. Main, SLC, isdup.org).\nReflecting on the history of the Salt Lake Valley, it's easy to see it wasn't a cakewalk to get where we are now. It was essentially a struggle of biblical proportions. Knowing that the land we stand on today had to be \"acquired,\" settled, made to bloom, then defended from the understandably outraged previous occupants, extreme weather conditions, insect invasions, plagues, economic hardships, a military show of force by the federal government and fellow residents who didn't hold the same political/religious views, it's a wonder we find a city here today at all. We do know of the devastating losses experienced by the Native Americans who resided in this area; it's tragic that so few of their descendants can be counted today. As you may see, it's a haunting endeavor to ponder how our towns and cities came to be.\nBut start here and let it inspire you to stop and appreciate the landmarks or read the historical plaques you encounter on your daily rounds. Salt Lake's history is anything but tame and for those who think nothing happens here, you haven't even scratched the surface. —Introduction by Jerre Wroble\nSalt Lake City Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall slc.gov Salt Lake City 2022 population: 200,000 plus Salt Lake County 2022 population: 1,207,538 Median age of residents: 32.5 years Claim to fame: Salt Lake City is the capital of Utah and home to the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints z Places to refuel: All the following are 2023 James Beard semifinalists: Manoli's Greek small plates (402 Harvey Milk Blvd., SLC), Normal Ice Cream (169 E.

On July 24, 1847, Brigham Young, the second president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, arrived in the Salt Lake Valley with his followers and established the Provisional State of Deseret. Young went on to guide the migration of thousands of Latter-day Saints to the Great Salt Lake Valley and beyond to form some 400 settlements in Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Wyoming and California.\nWhen the Saints first arrived, the land where Salt Lake City took shape had served as a kind of buffer zone between the Shoshone and Ute peoples. As such, conflicts between LDS pioneers and Native Americans were isolated at first. But tensions grew as the Saints began colonizing north and south of Salt Lake City, displacing Native Americans from their traditional subsistence areas, leading to multiple skirmishes, massacres and two long-term conflicts, known as the Walker War and the Black Hawk War.\nYoung led the church until he died in 1877, serving for a time as territorial governor of Utah and fending off an invasion of U.S. federal troops called in because it was thought a Mormon rebellion was afoot. He is buried, along with just a few of his purported 55 wives and 57 children, at 150 E. First Ave., SLC, in a tiny graveyard that was recently rehabilitated and reopened to the public after hooligans damaged the historic stones. It's free to visit.\nMost don't realize the number of landmarks in plain sight around the downtown area that commemorate Brigham Young's life and family. Most famous is the statue of the man himself at 15 E. South Temple (teased by an old jingle that went: \"There stands Brigham, high on his perch, with his hand to the bank and his back to the church.\"). There are markers at the northeast corner of South Temple and State denoting the establishment of a private school for Young's children; the Beehive House at 67 E. South Temple, where Young lived and worked beside many of his wives and children until his death; and the Eagle Gate (at the intersection of South Temple and State), which was originally a wooden arch and a 22-foot gate that closed off Young's home, gardens, school, barns, sheds and silkworm cocooneries at night.\nNot only Young, but Mormon pioneers are also recognized with plaques throughout the city, starting in Pioneer Park (350 S. 350 West, SLC) where the first Latter-day Saint settlers built a fort and wintered after arriving in Utah.\nFurther west, a granite monument at the corner of 900 W. North Temple at the Utah State Fairpark marks the spot where the ill-fated Donner-Reed Party crossed the Jordan River in 1846 before heading out to California's Sierra Nevada range. There, they lost 36 of their party to cold and starvation while survivors resorted to cannibalism.\nIn the 1870s, the railroad split SLC into two sides—the west and the east. It was those railroad workers who originally settled in what was then called the Oakley Park area, later named Rose Park. In the 1940s-1950s, developers swooped in and built the brick cottages for returning World War II soldiers and their new families, with one-car garages, no dining rooms (except for a small area in the kitchen) and unfinished basements.\nEven back then, \"NIMBYs\" didn't want developers to build affordable housing, but investors won out as the area was deemed blighted. This section of Salt Lake City along with the Fairpark area are just minutes away from downtown.\nToday, with the addition of Trax stations, new apartment and townhome developments springing up in all directions and a thriving Mexican grocery store, the neighborhood is still affordable, with few properties selling over $500,000.\nThere's also the North Temple District (or NOTE District) that many see as the west entrance to downtown. It's home to one of the city's legendary Mexican eateries, the Red Iguana (736 W. North Temple, SLC).\nSalt Lake neighborhoods like Westpointe, Poplar Grove, Glendale and tiny Swedetown that touch the boundaries of downtown are targets of developers looking to bulldoze aging housing inventory into newer apartments and townhomes in the near future.\nWestpointe saw a sizable investment by city officials with the installation of a major outdoor soccer complex (2280 Rose Park Lane, SLC) with field rentals for youth and adults, and night games available as the fields can be lit for competition in the evenings. The Regional Athletic Complex reopens for the season on April 15 and is accepting applications for 2023 tournaments now (phone 801-972-7883 for more information).\nKeep your eyes open for the Glendale Regional Park plans from SLC Public Lands for the former Raging Waters/Twin Peaks water park site. The city hopes to convert the property not only to a water park with a pool, splash pad and kayak rental/boat dock/ramp along the Jordan River, but also a community plaza with an event stage and lawn, picnic areas and riverside beach and boardwalk, all abilities playground, multi-use sports courts, dog park, sledding hill and places to wheel around.\nPhase 1 construction is underway, with more amenities to open in the spring 2024.\nAlta Alta Mayor Roger Bourke Alta.com Alta population: Less than 300 permanent residents Claim to fame: Home to Snowbird and Alta ski resorts. Places to refuel: Alta: Collins Grill, Swen's Restaurant, Alf's Restaurant, Rustler Lodge Dining Room, Albion Grill. Snowbird: The Aerie Not-to-miss festivals: Snowbird Oktoberfest (late August thru mid-October) and Wasatch Wildflower Festival\nWhen you're at the top of Little Cottonwood Canyon, it's easy to see the remnants of the glacial trough that carved this canyon during the last ice age. We know this area as the home of our famous ski resorts, but most folks pass right by the original quarry of quartz monzonite and granite that the pioneers mined to build many of our historical landmark buildings in the capital city.\nFew know about the legendary vault on the north side of the canyon road owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that's used to store more than 2.4 million rolls of microfilm and 1 million microfiche ... about 3 billion pages of family history records! The vault is not open to the public, but the church has been digitizing its records since 1999 and makes them available through its FamilySearch website and Family History Centers.\nIt may also come as a surprise to learn about a second vault that's 2 miles farther up the canyon owned by a for-profit company called Perpetual Storage. This is also a maximum-security digital record vault deep in that solid granite mountain, said to be naturally disaster/flame-proof that will store your records for eternity (at a price). It's a nice backup to your laptop's cloud.\nIn the 19th century, Alta was home to thousands of residents who were either silver miners or else employed at saloons, restaurants, haberdasheries, hotels/boarding houses or by the railroad. The mining boom continued into the late 1800s when huge avalanches and fires put a kibosh on the local economy. Yet, Alta rose out of the ashes in the early 1900s once more, only to be dampened by the Great Depression. The first ski lift (Collins) was erected in 1938 from parts of a mining tram. It was the second chairlift in the U.S.\nTed Johnson, an employee of Alta, purchased a deed to the Blackjack mining claim located at the bottom of Peruvian Gulch. He met Texas oilman Richard \"Dick\" Bass in 1969 and suggested he come to Utah to see an investment possibility of a potential ski resort. Shall we say the rest is history? Alta incorporated in 1970. Snowbird opened in 1971 with three lifts and a tram along with the lodge and Snowbird Center.\nFor climbers, there are 529 identified climbs in Little Cottonwood Canyon, with the second most bouldering routes in Utah, from V0 to V16 in difficulty. For tree huggers, Albion Basin at the top of the canyon is world-renowned for its fabulous wildflowers during the summer and yummy brunches on the weekend at Alta Lodge.\nBluffdale Bluffdale Mayor Natalie Hall bluffdale.com Bluffdale population: 18,835 Claim to Fame: The historic stomping ground for Orrin Porter Rockwell, bodyguard to Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.

Porter Rockwell Blvd., Bluffdale).\nTwenty miles south of Salt Lake City, the National Security Agency (NSA) built a data storage center to house approximately 1 million-plus square feet of sensitive information about God-knows-what at Camp Williams. Its purpose is to store people's mobile phone and internet use, but we don't really know its true mission. It supposedly cost $1.5 billion to erect and then another $2 billion for everything inside, and some say it's sucking Utah Lake dry to cool its computers. Some like to call it \"Big Brother's Database\" because of all the personal information it collects on all of us.\nAn early resident of the area was Orrin Porter Rockwell, who was friend and personal bodyguard to Joseph Smith and later bodyguard to Brigham Young. He became known as the \"Destroying Angel of Mormondom.\" In 1858, Rockwell paid $500 for 16 acres of land near Point of the Mountain by the old Utah State Prison site. He built the Hot Springs Brewery and Hotel that included dining facilities, a stable and Pony Express station. Rockwell's statue is located at Porter Rockwell Boulevard and 14600 South.\nFor a short time, Bluffdale was known as Mousley after the first LDS bishop assigned here. Bluffdale residents enjoy outstanding mountain views and the use of numerous trails in and around the city, many of which follow established trails worn into the land by Native Tribes.\nCottonwood Heights Cottonwood Heights Mayor Mike Weichers cottonwoodheights.utah.gov Cottonwood Heights population: 32,864 Claim to fame: \"The City Between the Canyons\" Places to refuel: Market Street Grill & Oyster Bar (2985 E. Cottonwood Parkway, Cottonwood Heights), Sumac Café (2578 Bengal Blvd., Cottonwood Heights), Porcupine Grill (3698 E. Fort Union Blvd., Cottonwood Heights)\nNewcomers don't know that we call the foothills, where some of Cottonwood Heights is located, \"benches.\" In geomorphology, a bench is a long, narrow strip of relatively level or gently inclined land that is bounded by steeper slopes above and below it. Our benches are the remnants of the ancient Lake Bonneville shoreline that you can see on both sides of the Salt Lake Valley carved into the Wasatch and Oquirrh mountains. If you hike along the benches, you may find fossils such as trilobites from when the lake teemed with life.\nCottonwood Heights is one of the newer kids on the block, having incorporated as a city in 2005. If you're into outdoor activities, it's just a darned convenient place to live. Just off Interstate 215, the Cottonwood canyons—with their four ski resorts, Brighton, Solitude, Alta, Snowbird—are only a 20-minute drive (when there's no traffic). The city also offers shopping in the Fort Union area, dining at pubs and eateries, and options to live in a broad mix of housing types. The city is committed to finishing a multi-use trail along the full length of Big Cottonwood Creek within its borders in the next few years.\nLocals remember the annual haunted house during Halloween at \"the Old Mill.\" Originally built by the Deseret News, this abandoned stone structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Here, workers made paper, using equipment that had been moved from the Sugar House Paper Mill. Logs from nearby canyons were ground up with old clothes to produce the paper for the news, but as the 19th century ended, railroads brought cheaper paper products from out of state. On April Fool's Day in 1892, a fire broke out in the mass stockpile of paper there. Locals thought the alarms were a joke and sadly the place burned to just the stone skeleton. It became a dance hall in 1927, and it hosted weekend concerts in the 1970s. It turned into a haunted-house attraction in the late '70s and early '80s but has been closed now for many years.\nDaybreak Daybreak is a master-planned community of South Jordan (Mayor Dawn R.

All homes are a 5-minute walk to bike trails, lakes, shopping and a water course coming this summer.\nOnly a few years ago, there were just farms, deer and antelope wandering along the hills of South Jordan. Then, in 2004, the Kennecott Land group (a subsidiary of Rio Tinto)—which owned the world's largest open-pit copper mine, located on the west bench of the Oquirrh Mountains—decided that they would shift gears and start building a colossal planned community of residential and commercial properties. When the development was first announced as the new \"Harvard/Yale\" neighborhood of the valley, both Realtors and locals were skeptical about what might be built. Yet, Kennecott picked a small group of builders to help plan and erect a city with a wide variety of housing inventory, from rental apartments to 55+ homes, and from condos to stand-alone houses and townhomes. Daybreak is always growing and evolving with fresh home styles and amenities, and residents here enjoy exciting features like a watercourse canal network and a bike park that will open this summer. The Salt Lake Bees baseball team will reportedly move to a new stadium in Daybreak in 2025. The Larry H. Miller Group, which now owns both the Daybreak development as well as the team, will provide this new sports and entertainment venue that the developers have been drooling over and residents have been craving.\nDraper Draper Mayor Troy Walker draperutah.gov Draper population: 51,749 Must-attend festival: Draper Days, July 7-15 Places to refuel: The Sauce Boss (877 E. 12300 South, Draper), The Cliff Dining Pub and Cultivate Craft Kitchen (12234 Draper Gate Drive, Draper), The Charleston Draper (1229 Pioneer Road, Draper). Attractions: Loveland Living Planet Aquarium (12033 Lone Peak Parkway, Draper), Cowabunga Bay Waterpark (12047 S. State, Draper), Ikea—the only one in Utah (67 Ikea Way, Draper)\nEbenezer Brown was the first white man to settle in \"Sivogah,\" a Native word for \"willows.\" Soon after came his wife's brother, William Draper Jr. and his family of 15. The first post office stamp was \"Draperville\" and what was to become a fort (that was never built) is the site of the Draper Historical Park and Fort Street. Westbound Pony Express riders rode along State Street to their station south of the old Utah State Prison site where Orrin Porter Rockwell's Hot Springs Brewery Hotel stood from 1858 to 1868. The southeast side of Interstate 15 was known for its pig, egg and dairy farms, and, for decades, the area was the \"egg basket\" of Utah, producing the most eggs in the state for citizens and troops heading to the South Pacific during World War II. The farms were bought up by developers who turned them into new subdivisions in the 1990s. \"Cranberry\" sprang up and then, soon after, \"South Mountain\" with its public golf course, adding thousands of homes, apartments and condos along the south bench, almost up to the gravel pit at Point of the Mountain. Roads were expanded along the east side of the city so that commuters could live in Draper and work in Lehi but drive over the mountain through Alpine. There is still a scar of a 1,000-foot motorbike trail that went straight up the southwest mountain known during the 1960s to the 1980s as the \"Widowmaker.\" Thousands of dirt bikers tried to get up the hill, but few made it. With more than 4,000 acres of open space and more than 100 miles of trails, Draper is the place to recreate and relax; it's great for families, hikers, bikers, runners and equestrians. The zoning still allows horse properties, and there are trails for people and their animals. The big news for Draper is the demolition of the state prison there, which will be replaced by a planned community called \"The Point.\" There are five designs currently being studied and proposed for the 600 acres where the prison previously stood.\nHerriman Herriman Mayor Lorin Palmer herriman.org Herriman population: 58,198 Places to refuel: Garage Grill (4874 W. 12600 South, Herriman), The Salty Pineapple (3262S. 5600 West, Herriman), Redemption Bar & Grill (3517 W. Maradona Drive, Herriman) Attractions: The Disney \"Up House\" (13218 S. Herriman Rose Blvd.—drive-by only), Blackridge Reservoir for swimming and paddle boarding (15000 Ashland Ridge Drive.)\nThis town was the site of an adobe fort built in the 1850s used to protect Mormon settlers from hostile Native Americans who weren't too pleased with the white interlopers, so they began stealing horses and cattle from the pioneers. There's a historic marker for the fort at 12685 S. 6000 West. The town was named after Henry Herriman, one of the settlers who arrived with Thomas Butterfield and John Stocking and their families. Each built a cabin and began farming. They carved a road into the hills in what is now called Butterfield Canyon. The canyon road, now owned by Kennecott Utah Copper, ends up at a wonderful recreation area with great vistas and wildlife, but it is closed seasonally from Nov. 1 to June 1. Watt Homes developed the first subdivision in Herriman, called Rose Creek Estates, with homes under 1 acre. Another private developer, James Sorenson, created Rosecrest, which was originally part of Bluffdale but, after legal action, became part of Herriman, increasing both the population and the tax base. The town became a city in 2001. Herriman has had to deal with flooding (many graves in the cemetery on Pioneer Street were washed up in 2014) and wildfires in the ample brush (the cause in 2010 was due to tracer bullets from the nearby National Guard base and, in 2018, it was due to fireworks).\nHolladay Holladay Mayor Robert M.

Attractions: Walter Frederick Morrison Disc Golf Course (1592 E. Murray Holladay Road)\nJohn Holladay of Alabama was the leader of the Mississippi Company of Mormon pioneers. They arrived in the valley in 1847 and had an eye for water to irrigate hay and food crops for horses, cattle and people and to power grinding mills. The abundant stream from Mount Olympus was just what they were looking for, and so most of the company stayed and began farming at what was then known as Spring Creek (also the name of the water source)—and now called Kentucky Avenue. A fort was built but the Natives were passive, so it was not needed. You can see a plaque about this at Olympus Junior High (2217 E. 4800 South). It is thought to be the first pioneer village established outside of Salt Lake City and considered the longest continuously inhabited settlement in Utah (great trivia) because Salt Lake City was abandoned for a time in 1857 when Johnston's Army occupied the city. Many of the original settlers were asked by LDS leadership to establish communities further west, and so John Holladay and many friends moved to San Bernadino, California, just three years after they had come to Utah. Also, the second cemetery in the valley was located in the area of Holladay's Memorial Park. \"Our Sweet 3-Year-Old Daughter\" statue can be seen at 4900 S. Memory Lane in Holladay. Some consider Holladay a place of \"old money\" homes, as there are grand estates located on large parcels—some still with horses and barns attached. Walker Lane is one of the most prestigious streets to call home, but you'll have to pay multiple millions to live there.\nMillcreek/Canyon Rim Millcreek Mayor Jeff Silvestrini millcreek.us Millcreek population: 64,110 Places to refuel: Feldman's Deli (2005 E. 2700 South, Millcreek), Provisions (3364 S. 2300 East, Millcreek), Eggs in the City (2795 S. 2300 East, Millcreek), Koyo Japanese (2275 E. 3300 South, Millcreek), Roots Café (3474 S. 2300 East, Millcreek) and Log Haven (6451 Mill Creek Canyon Rd.) Attractions: Parley's Historic Nature Park (aka Tanner Park) off-leash dog park (2700 E. 2740 South, Millcreek), Kol Ami's \"Esther's Garden\" at the Synagogue (2425 Heritage Way, Millcreek), Mill Creek Canyon (3800 Mill Creek Canyon Road—$5 user fee due when exiting canyon)\nMillcreek/Canyon Rim is commemorated with two plaques at 2000 E. Stratford Ave. (2585 South) for the location of the largest gristmill in the Utah Territory. It operated between 1852-1857 and was shut down when Johnston's U.S. Army came to town in 1857. Like most mills, it was operated by a large water wheel, with water coming from Parley's Creek (east of Suicide Rock). The mill didn't last long, and later it became a cotton mill, followed by a woolen mill—until the whole works burned to the ground. The other plaque on Stratford highlights Parley P. Pratt's Toll Road. It was a new route through the canyon to haul fuel and timber nicknamed \"The Golden Pass.\" It cost 75 cents for a \"two-horse\" outfit, 10 cents for each additional animal and a penny for each sheep. Thousands of Mormons, emigrants, gold seekers, Pony Express riders, stagecoaches and soldiers came through this pass into the valley between 1850-1869. Today, you can walk along the old byway when you take your dogs down the trail east into the canyon from Tanner Park. There are numerous historic plaques in and around Millcreek, which became an official city in 2016 and now boasts the largest outdoor ice rink in any city in Utah. Another rando site not to be missed is Evergreen Park (2230 E. Evergreen Ave. at 3435 South), where you'll find a monument recognizing the legacy of African-American pioneers. The first Black man to arrive in Utah was a trapper (James Beckwourth) for the Mountain Fur Co. in 1825. Soon afterward, in 1847, three Black male slaves came to the valley with the Orson Pratt (Parley Pratt's younger brother) group. Think of this area as an early \"spaghetti bowl\" for wagon traffic and immigrants that now offers great hiking for you (and your dogs). Parley's Hollow, for instance, has remnants of the sandstone aqueduct and the old railroad line that offered freight service to Sugar House, the old tollhouse, plus remains of Dudler's Inn and Wine Cellar.\nKearns Kearns Mayor Kelly Bush kmtutah.org Kearns population: 36,747 Kearns' claim to fame: Utah Olympic Oval (5662 Cougar Lane, Kearns) Places to refuel: Mom's (4090 W. 5415 South, Kearns), D & D Bakery (4655 W. 5415 South, Kearns), Acapulco (4722 S. 4015 West, Kearns) Fun Stuff: La Rumba Night Club (4090 W. 5415 South, Kearns), Scales and Tails Petting Zoo (4944 W. 6200 South)\nUnlike most Utah towns, Kearns didn't get its name from Native Americans who hunted the lands there or from Brigham Young. The metro township was named after Thomas Kearns, who came to Park City \"with only 10 cents in his pocket and left a millionaire.\" Kearns helped develop Park City's Silver King Mine (known for high-grade silver, ore, copper and zinc) and went on to purchase The Salt Lake Tribune and also serve as a U.S. Senator. Kearns died in 1918 after being struck by a car at South Temple and Main Street. Up until 1942, Kearns was a sleepy little ag town of dry farms but then, the U.S. military needed an inland base to train pilots to fight in World War II. Rapid and large-scale construction created airplane runways, hangers, taxiways and several hundred temporary buildings to house the thousands of soldiers and airmen stationed there. Overnight, Kearns became one of Utah's largest cities, only for the base to be deactivated after the war in 1946. Luckily, developers saw that infrastructure—roads and utilities—were in place, and they began building homes like crazy for those returning from the war. Some original buildings exist today: the theater for \"colored personnel\" became part of Kearns Junior High, the base chapel is now part of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic Church, and the base train station is a day-care center. The airfield of Kearns Army Base is now known as South Valley Regional Airport.\nMagna Magna Mayor Dan Peay magna.utah.gov Magna population: 29,268 Places to refuel: Brew Monkey Coffee House and Deli (3441 S. 8400 West, Magna), Pasifika Corned Beef Kitchen (8545 W.

Saltair Drive, Magna)\nWhat was the first settlement on the west side of the valley? Believe it or not, it was Coonville, named after Abraham Coon, the patriarch of one of several white families who settled there. He found timber in this area suitable for lumber, and was able to use a variety of oak tree bark to tan leather. In the 1860s, more settlers arrived and were attracted to fertile soil and water sources, and thus the farming community of Pleasant Green came into being. It later merged as the metro township of Magna (Latin for \"great\" or \"superior\"), which became the official name of the area when the first post office opened in 1917.\nYou can't talk about Magna without mentioning copper ore and how Magna became the smelting center for the mineral mined in Bingham Canyon. This huge mine, founded in 1903, produces about 1% of the world's copper. As one of the largest open-pit wonders of the world, it brought in an infusion of immigrant labor, with Greeks, Italians and Chinese seeking out the good-paying mining jobs.\nMagna's historic Main Street is known for its buildings dating to the Copper Boom Town Era (1904-1929). Stop and shop at Colosimo's Original Standard Market (9009 W. 2700 South, Magna), where some of Utah's best sausages are made and sold. Italian immigrant Ralph Colosimo began making his meat products in the 1920s, selling them at first to his neighbors.\nMidvale Midvale Mayor Marcus Stevenson midvalecity.org Midvale population: 35,983 Places to refuel: Bohemian Brewery (94 E. 7200 South), 2 Row Brewing (6856 S. 300 West) Attractions: Top Golf (920 Jordan River Blvd., Midvale), Midvale City Splash Pad (362 W. Center St., Midvale), Midvale City Museum (350 W. 7615 South. Midvale), Jordan River Parkway Trail (jordanrivercommission.com)\nLocated in the central part of the Salt Lake Valley, Midvale was a great place to settle and raise a family. The city is located on both sides of Interstate 80 and I-15 and includes the Fort Union, Bingham Junction and Jordan Bluffs areas as well. The Jordan River offered a source for irrigation for farms, and a railroad was built to transfer ore from Bingham Canyon mines. Five smelters in Midvale's Bingham Junction area (formerly the Sharon Steel site) processed lead and copper ore from the mines. The resulting slag caused toxic levels of heavy metals in the surrounding soils and groundwater. As such, Midvale became the first community in EPA Region 8 to be part of a Superfund Redevelopment Pilot Program. The dirt was scraped (in some areas, the top 12 inches) and hauled away. By 2008, enough remediation had been done for the EPA to give the greenlight for commercial and residential use of the site.\nThe oldest building in Midvale is the 20x15-foot Drown Log Cabin, built in 1866—back when most pioneers in the area were living in pit-houses dug out from the ground. The structure has been relocated twice and is now located by the pioneer cemetery at 7650 Lind Lane in Midvale.\nYou can win any local trivia contest by asking people: \"Was there ever a 'fort' in Fort Union, and is it still there?\" The answer is ... Yes, and yes! There's a marker by the flagpole smack in the middle of The Shops at Fort Union shopping mall (7188 Union Park Ave.) just down the street from the Pie Pizzeria. Built in 1853 out of adobe, the fort walls were 6-feet thick made with rock and clay—very eco smart—cool in the summer, easy to heat in the winter. The \"union\" of Fort Union was reportedly named after a suggestion by a schoolteacher to emphasize the unity existing among the Saints given the tight quarters they lived in. The now-mall and former-fort had 23 homes within its 12-foot-tall walls with an adjacent school building used as a church and amusement hall. Other trivia, for the win: Movie buffs love that parts of The Stand mini-series, Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Meyers, Gentlemen Broncos and The Sandlot were filmed in downtown Midvale.\nMurray Murray Mayor Brett A.

State, Murray), Wheeler Historic Farm (6351 S. 900 East, Murray), Desert Star Playhouse (4861 S. State, Murray), Murray City Arboretum in Murray Park (5051 Treetop Circle, Murray).\nNamed after Eli Murray—the governor of Utah Territory between 1880 and 1886—the town of Murray had been the seasonal home of Paiute, Ute, Shoshone, Goshute and Bannock Native American people. Artifacts of these groups have been found along stream beds including the area around Willow Pond Park. In the mid-1800s, laborers hauled granite from Little Cottonwood Canyon along what we know as Vine Street through rain, snow and ice to transport it to the downtown construction site of the Salt Lake Temple. The first building constructed outside of downtown Salt Lake City \"for the purpose of religious and educational instruction\" is marked with a monument at 225 Gordon Lane, opposite the intersection of 250 East. During the 1800s, the city had an opera house featuring some of the first electric lighting and steam heat in the valley; several bars owned by Harry Haynes, Salt Lake County's most prominent \"saloon man\"; and the historic Murray Theater, still standing at 4961 S. State.\nRiverton Riverton Mayor Trent Staggs rivertonutah.gov Riverton population: 45,148 Places to refuel: Salsa Leedos Mexican Grill (13298 S.

Park Ave. Redwood Road, Riverton) Attractions: The Kinlands Farm and Market (11887 S. 4000 West, Riverton), Jordan River Parkway and Rotary Park Trailhead (12300 S. 973 West, Riverton)\nThe first residents (before the Saints) were the Yo No Indians, a Tribe that lived along the Jordan River. There were four forts erected along the waterway, but historians believe there wasn't a need for protection because the river was a well-used and successful commercial byway for trading of leather goods and furs, cattle, horses, sheep and the like for both whites and Natives. The area was originally called \"Gardnerville,\" as the largest landowner at the time was Archibald Gardner (think Gardner Village). A plaque in Riverton Park (12255 S. 1500 West) shows a replica of the \"Magnificent Dome Church,\" erected by the LDS Church in the late 1800s but razed in 1940 after just 30 years of use. Riverton's iconic Old Dome Meeting Hall at Riverton City Park was fashioned to look like the famous old ward meeting house that had been located nearby. Originally, there were also a brick kiln, molasses and flour mills, a harness shop and a dance hall built by local Daniel Densley. There was also a tithing yard (where church members brought their tithed increase in produce, grains and livestock to be weighed, stored and/or donated. Animals brought there would be butchered, sold and the money turned over to the general authorities of the church). A rail service by Salt Lake and Utah railroads brought commercial goods in and out of the area.\nSandy Sandy Mayor Monica Zoltanski sandy.utah.gov Sandy population: 95,050 Sandy claim to fame: America First Field (76 W.

State, Sandy)\nAs for how the town of Sandy got its name, some say Ol' Brigham named the town \"Sandy\" for its thirsty soil, and that after taking one of the first train rides from downtown Salt Lake to the area, he reportedly exclaimed \"Sand! Sand! Everywhere sand! We'll call this place 'Sandy.'\" Another theory is that it was named after a legendary and colorful Scotsman, Alexander \"Sandy\" Kinghorn, a sandy-bearded, red-haired train engineer for the Utah Southern Railroad, who hauled cargo and people to the southern end of Salt Lake Valley. Sandy boasts the private 18-hole Hidden Valley Country Club which opened in 1959. Home to suburban food chains and shopping malls such as The Shops at South Town (10450 S. State, Sandy), Sandy's America First Field hosts legions of soccer fans at RSL home games, and theater buffs flock to the family friendly Broadway shows at Hale Centre Theatre (aka Mountain America Performing Arts Centre).\nSouth Jordan South Jordan Mayor Dawn Ramsey sjc.utah.gov South Jordan Population: 80,139 Claims to fame: home of two Latter-day Saint temples and the master-planned community of Daybreak Places to refuel: Saffron Valley Indian (10098 S.

Parkway Plaza Drive, South Jordan)\nFounded by Mormon settlers in 1859, this area was historically used for farming (agriculture) by a variety of Native Americans and trappers. The early tribes were wise users of local plants, and as the pioneers descended en masse, the Saints needed help learning what crops would grow. Plus, the pioneers arrived very late the first year to harvest a crop. We've all heard the story about the Mormon crickets and how they laid waste to the Saints' very first plantings. Pioneers got some help from the Tribes who shared their knowledge of local foods. Sego lilies (Utah's state flower) were abundant and filling (they taste like a potato when boiled), redroot pigweed (Amaranth) may be a bitch of a weed to get rid of in your garden, but the entire plant is edible and used in tacos (Mexico) and in callaloo (Caribbean cuisine), as were common weeds such as goosefoot and lambsquarters (eaten like spinach). Camas bulbs (Kamas was named after this plant) could be made into a crude molasses, and there were many wild versions of strawberries, currants, ground cherries and chokecherries. Plus, there was burdock and dandelion. The ephedra plant, found all over the valley, has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for more than 5,000 years. It's also used to make Momon tea.\nSouth Salt Lake South Salt Lake Mayor Cherie Wood sslc.gov South Salt Lake population: 26,166 Claim to Fame: Home to Salt Lake Chinatown (3390 S.

Well, Jesse Fox Jr. developed this area around 1890 and named it \"Central Park\" after visiting the famous park in the Big Apple. He liked how NYC's park offered urban dwellers a place to escape the stresses of city life and thus the name stuck here until 1936. In 1937, voters decided to disincorporate Central Park and incorporate as South Salt Lake. Much of the grumbling had to do with the fact SSL didn't have a great sewer system, and to put in one would cost a fortune. Luckily, the Works Progress Administration (formerly known as the WPA, which created jobs across the country during the Great Depression) stepped in and designed a poop shoot system for $462,000. Today, South Salt Lake is on the rise, thanks to the vision of Mayor Wood and her administration. In 2017, industrial land was re-zoned for a mixed-use project known as The Crossing, located between State and Main just south of 2100 South. The project has so far brought in a WinCo grocery store and a new streetcar. Old industrial buildings have been purchased, renovated and re-occupied. The city's Creative Industries Zone has fostered the growth of breweries and distilleries and launched a nightlife scene. Their goal is to create a walkable/bikeable downtown for South Salt Lake.\nTaylorsville Taylorsville Mayor Kristie Overson taylorsvilleut.gov Taylorsville population: 59,242 Claim to Fame: Primary campus for Salt Lake Community College (4600 S.

Redwood Road, Taylorsville)\nThe first peoples who settled here after the last ice age ate mammoths, and evidence of this was discovered from artifacts of the Fremont and Ute peoples' campgrounds located along the river. The pioneers who showed up later were English Latter-day Saints—including the Harker family, followed by the Bennions. They planted wheat, corn, oats, alfalfa and sugar beets in those early years, only to lose them to those pesky Mormon crickets. The Utes were not happy with so much land under cultivation. Their frequent attacks caused the settlers to build two forts in the area. Originally this area was known as North Jordan and was made up of three communities: Taylorsville, Kearns and Bennion, which incorporated in 1996. Historians believe the town was named for John Taylor, third president of LDS Church and an original member of the Quorum of the Twelve before the Saints came to Utah. He was a wounded survivor of the mob attack that killed Joseph and Hyrum Smith. The most historic area of this city is around 665 Sunstone Road (4800 South), where a water-powered \"burr mill\" was erected in 1880 that was later converted into a roller mill, built by Archibald Gardner. Similar to a coffee/pepper grinder, a burr mill/burr grinder grinds wheat, corn and other grain grown by pioneers. The mill was operated by the Bennion family until it burned down in 1909, and a marker on the northeast corner of Sunstone Road commemorates it.\nWest Jordan West Jordan Mayor Dirk Burton wjhistory.org West Jordan population: 116,541 Claim to fame: South Valley Regional Airport, Salt Lake Number 2 airport Places to refuel: Archibald's Restaurant at Gardner Village (1100 W. 7800 South, West Jordan), Vegan Bowl (8672 S.

Pioneers found the lazy river in 1848 flowing from Utah Lake ideal for wistful thoughts but also good for sawmills and the first leather tannery west of the Mississippi River—both of which used plenty of water to make their products. The original Gardner Mill, part of the Gardner Village Shopping Center, is a collection of restored buildings erected by the town's namesake, Archibald Gardner, in the mid-19th century. He would have been blown away to see how the area has grown, with a major retail center like Jordan Landing, Jordan Valley Medical Center and a campus of Salt Lake Community College, let alone an airport. The Apache and Black Hawk helicopters that train there are a far cry from Archie's horse-and-oxen herd that helped schlep goods along the dirt roads. If you're interested in more local charm, the West Jordan Historical Society opened a small museum at 7800 S. 2053 West in the city's main park (open by appointment), with one of Saltair's original carousel horses, tools once used by Gardner to build 31 different mills in the valley, an original soda fountain and more.\nWest Valley City West Valley Mayor Karen Lang wvc-ut.gov West Valley City population: 139,110 Places to refuel: Tonkotsu Ramen Bar (1898 W. 3500 South, West Valley City), Fat Fish (1980 W. 3500 South, West Valley City), Lonestar Saloon (3153 W. 2100 South, West Valley City), The Westerner (3360 S.

Decker Lake Drive, West Valley City), Usana Amphitheater (5150 Upper Ridge Road, West Valley City)\nArchaeologists have found evidence of tribal communities living in the area as many as 3,000 years ago. When the pioneers arrived, there were Utes and Shoshones camping along the Jordan River. Joseph Harker and his wife, Susanna, were the first Latter-day Saints to plant their stake more than a hundred years before the town was incorporated in 1980. Settlers dug canals for irrigation from the river that allowed for large-scale farming. In the early 1900s, the interurban rail line from Magna to SLC was installed and the first paved roads and subsequent potholes opened up the area to faster transportation. And like many Utah towns, there was a need to provide clean culinary water and sewer lines. Granger and Hunter combined forces to improve infrastructure that then led to subdivisions for new post-war homes in the 1950s and the slow demise of larger farms. Drive by the great architectural and historical treasure here known as \"Hawarden\" House (4396 S. 3200 West, West Valley City), a stately representative of early 20th century residential architecture in what was then rural Utah. Ira Bennion built this home where eight of his 15 children were born. He helped build the cattle and sheep industry of the Intermountain West.\nAs Utah's second largest city, WVC boasts the Olympic ice hockey and concert venue that is the Maverik Center (also home to the Utah Grizzlies pro-hockey ECHL team). The Utah Cultural Celebration Center (1355 W. 3100 South, WVC), used for multi-cultural events, is also the pride of the city. The addition of the Usana Amphitheatre in 2003 gave residents a wonderful outdoor venue that seats 20,000 in chairs and on the lawn. This year's lineup includes Shania Twain, Matchbox Twenty, Nickelback, Pantera, Mastodon and Gojira, the Zac Brown Band and many more.\nIn 2010, West Valley City was labeled Utah's most ethnically diverse city, with 45% of its citizens considered minorities. Refugees from Southeast Asia came to the town after the Vietnam War, as did Pacific Islanders wanting to be closer to their Mormon \"mecca.\" WVC is dotted with restaurants and bodegas representing cultural backgrounds of Somalia, the Middle East, Honduras, Peru and more. [page]\nGet on the Bus, Gus Join the star-studded tour of Salt Lake's arts and entertainment scene. By Scott Renshaw\nWelcome aboard, visitors to our fair city (and state). There's so much to do and see here, but it would be a huge mistake to overlook the arts and culture scene that has flourished in the Salt Lake City metropolitan area for decades. From theater to dance, from comedy to classical music, from film to fine art, it's impossible to overstate how many amazing organizations and individuals bring artistic vitality to this place.\nDowntown Is Lit For the next—well, however long it takes for you to read this—we'll be taking a tour of the key venues where you can experience this bounty of local creative talent. Keep your hands and legs inside the vehicle at all times, and watch your children, please.\nWe'll begin to the north of downtown proper, where Salt Lake Acting Company (168 W. 500 North, SLC, 801-363-7522, saltlakeactingcompany.org) occupies a quaint converted chapel with two theater spaces. For more than 50 years, the company has been the place to find challenging world and regional premieres, engaging holiday family-friendly shows, and an original cabaret-style musical production—now dubbed SLACabaret— scheduled annually in the summer, that captures the fun and foibles of the local culture.\nOn the west side of downtown, we find The Gateway (400 W. 200 South, SLC, atthegateway.com), an outdoor mall that offers even more than retail shopping and great dining options. It's also the home of one of three Utah Wiseguys Comedy (801-532-5233, wiseguyscomedy.com) locations, which hosts both the best of the local comedy scene, including open mic nights, and national touring comedians. The Gateway also hosts two of Utah's most engaging family-friendly museums: Discovery Gateway (444 W. 100 South, SLC, 801-456-5437, discoverygateway.org), a hands-on children's museum with exhibits including STEM lab, exploring the world of fossils, financial literacy and more; and Clark Planetarium (110 S. 400 West, SLC, 385-468-7827, clarkplanetarium.org), with many opportunities to investigate the Earth's geology, the wonders of the solar system and the universe beyond, in addition to films in the IMAX and Hansen Dome theaters.\nAs we head into the heart of downtown, you'll spot the wonderful architectural and acoustic marvel that is Abravanel Hall (123 W. South Temple, SLC). It's the home of the Utah Symphony (801-533-6683, utahsymphony.org), which plays a full season of classical masterworks, pops performances with special guests, symphonic accompaniment to classic films and more; during the summer, the symphony takes up residence for an outdoor series in the beautiful setting of Park City's Deer Valley resort.\nRight next door to Abravanel Hall is the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art (20 S. West Temple, SLC, 801-328-4201, utahmoca.org), a gallery space dedicated to the finest modern works. Multiple gallery spaces offer a chance to experience local, regional and national artists exploring daring themes, whether in painting, sculpture, mixed media or multimedia arts. And just next door to that space is the Calvin L. Rampton Salt Palace Convention Center (100 S. West Temple, SLC, 385-468-2222), just now emerging from an extensive renovation and upgrade. In addition to hosting trade shows and corporate conventions, the venue hosts the annual FanX comic book and pop-culture convention (fanxsaltlake.com), which brings celebrity guests, vendors and creators together for a celebration of fandoms in movies, television, books, gaming and more.\nNext on our agenda is the Janet Quinney Lawson Capitol Theatre (50 W. 200 South, SLC), with a history dating back more than a century to its original incarnation as the Orpheum Theatre—designed by legendary architect Gustave Albert Lansburgh, creator of such celebrated locations as Los Angeles's Shrine Auditorium and San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House—hosting vaudeville acts. In the 21st century, it's home to Ballet West (801-869-6900, balletwest.org), which in 2023 celebrates the 60th anniversary of its founding by Willam F. Christensen. The company presents both modern works and classics of the ballet canon, including the beloved annual holiday production of The Nutcracker. The Capitol Theatre also hosts performances by Utah Opera (801-533-5626, utahopera.org), which celebrates its own auspicious anniversary marking 45 years of great works by Verdi, Puccini, Mozart and more, as well as exciting new operatic work like the May 2023 scheduled production of 2017's The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs.\nWe now take a little spin down Main Street—alongside the convenient Trax light rail line—to one of the city's newer jewels, the George S. and Dolores Doré Eccles Theater (131 S. Main, SLC). That's where you'll find the great touring productions offered by Broadway at the Eccles (saltlakecity.broadway.com), including celebrated recent favorites like Hamilton and The Lion King, and upcoming offerings like Tina: The Tina Turner Musical, Les Misérables and Beetlejuice.

Plan-B Theatre Co. (planbtheatre.org) occupies the Studio Theatre space, bringing a season that almost always focuses on world premieres by local Utah playwrights, and has historically offered intriguing specialties like an annual radio show.

As we take a short trip down 300 South from the Rose Wagner Center, we'll find another regular Sundance venue, and another great spot for those who celebrate film as an art form. The Broadway Centre Cinemas (111 E. 300 South, SLC, 801-321-0310, slfs.org) is the home base for the Salt Lake Film Society, a nonprofit dedicated to the finest in film.

Both places offer numerous activities to enthrall your kids.\nUniversity of Utah: The Hills Are Alive As we make our way now up the hill toward the University of Utah, we'll encounter several other key venues. On the campus' centerpiece Presidents Circle, you'll find Kingsbury Hall (1395 E. Presidents Circle, SLC, 801-581-7100, kingsburyhall.utah.edu), which plays host to touring comedians like Mike Birbiglia and Fortune Feimster, touring dance and theater productions, and fascinating speakers. Right next door, Libby Gardner Concert Hall (1375 E.

Downstairs in the Pioneer Memorial Theatre building is the Babcock Theatre (artstickets.utah.edu), presenting performances by the University of Utah Department of Theatre.\nAlso on the university campus, we take a spin past the Utah Museum of Fine Arts (410 Campus Center Dr., SLC, 801-581-7332, umfa.utah.edu), which boasts a permanent collection of nearly 20,000 objects. Gallery spaces offer fantastic touring exhibitions like 2023's Many Wests: Artists Shape an American Idea, and permanent gallery spaces showcasing American, European, Mesoamerican, African and Japanese art, plus much more.\nWhile we're up in the east foothills, we'll stop by the Natural History Museum of Utah Rio Tinto Center (301 Wakara Way, SLC, 801-581-6927, nhmu.utah.edu), a shining copper showcase of fascinating exhibits. Whether you're there to experience permanent exhibits investigating the environments, flora, fauna and peoples of this region, or compelling touring exhibitions, you'll be dazzled by what you find.\nThe Add-on Tour: Beyond Salt Lake City If we had more time, we'd take you away from downtown to other worthwhile destinations, such as the Hale Center Theatre (9900 S. Monroe St., Sandy, 801-984-9000, hct.org), the Utah Cultural Celebration Center (1355 W. 3100 South, West Valley City, 801-965-5100, culturalcelebration.com), or the Loveland Living Planet Aquarium (12033 Lone Peak Parkway, Draper, 801-355-3474, thelivingplanet.com). You'd probably never get to the end of the arts and culture destinations you can discover—which we hope means that you'll be coming back to visit us again real soon.\nNow step off the bus, please. The next tour is about to begin.\nSeek Ye This List of Visual Artists Have thy mind blown. By Cat Palmer\nAs a portraiture photographer for more than 25 years and a mixed-media artist for almost two decades, I'm also an avid art collector. I was a gallery director a lifetime ago and have curated for two galleries.\nSo, even though Salt Lakers might downplay our visual arts scene, I know better! Salt Lake is a mid-size town with a metropolitan city-size artist culture.

By Stefene Russell\nIf you love short stories, storytelling, romance novels, slam poetry, authors, wordplay, verses, Plato, fiction, biographies, journaling, Jane Austen, mythology, novels, essays, scripts, novellas, Aristotle, spoken word, graphic novels, iambic pentameter, nonfiction and, well, any form of literary endeavor, you're in the right place.\nSalt Lake's cup runneth if not over, at least close to the brim when it comes to prose and poetry, and that might surprise newcomers. Former Poet Laureate Paisley Rekdal noted—in our Q&A with her on our back-cover feature (on p. 98)—that outsiders don't often consider Utah a literary stronghold. Rekdal proved otherwise with her web project, Mapping Literary Utah. As this list shows, there's a lot here to keep any book-lover happy.\nCity Art Salt Lake's longest-running literary reading series—launched in 1989—is also its most eclectic. The current organizer, poet Joel Long, brings together writers that run the gamut from the street to the academy. Follow City Art on Facebook for reading announcements.

It uses a unique point system for book trade-ins, and the constant inflow and outflow of used books means you'll constantly find new titles to browse — often ones you won't find anywhere else. 2017 S. 1100 East, SLC, 801-485-3913, central-bookexchange.com\nDolly's Bookstore Tiny Dolly's (named for its bookstore cat) has been on Park City's main business strip since the early '70s.

Once fully moved, it'll have niches for general new and used books, as well as its specialties: antiquarian titles; local poetry and fiction; and titles with a tilt towards desert ecology and Deseret history. There's even a children's reading room, which the store launched with \"Where the Wild Things Be,\" a reading of \"Where the Wild Things Are,\" by Sanders himself. 109 E. 500 South, SLC, 801-521-3819, kensandersbooks.com\nThe King's English Bookshop This bookstore lives up to its regal name: a supremely well-read staff that can recommend books from any genre; well-stocked and carefully curated shelves; and a long-running reading series featuring buzzy local and national writers (who, weather permitting, often read in the lovely courtyard out back). Opened in 1977, it survived the big-box bookstore era of the early '90s not just by selling great books, but doing that with a personal touch, staying connected to readers through its newsletter, The Inkslinger, which it still publishes.

Weber State University, Ogden, 801-626-6000, weber.edu/english/visitingwriters.html\nWeller BookWorks Founded in 1929 by German immigrants Gustav and Margaret Weller, its first iteration on Main Street was a multi-level adventure for booklovers, from the mezzanine (where the rare book rooms lived) to the basement (where you might find maps from the 18th century, old copies of The Evergreen Review, or blender-centered cookbooks from the 1960s). Gustav's son, Sam, managed the bookstore through the 20th century with his wife Lila close at hand, and built Weller's into the bookstore for historical LDS and regional books. You can see a square of velvet-flocked wallpaper from the old store in Weller's new digs in Trolley Square; it remains a multi-level wonderland. You'll still find lots of rare books, including antiquarian LDS titles. It's managed by Tony and Catherine Weller, the third-generation owners, who also keep lots of contemporary fiction, nonfiction, poetry philosophy and kids' titles in stock, and schedule regular readings from writers like Terry Tempest Williams, as well as events like Breakfast Club and Lit Knit, which combine books with brunch and knitting needles respectively. 607 Trolley Square, SLC, 801-328-2586, wellerbookworks.com [page]\nFood Fashion du Jour Local food bloggers and influencers look at what's trending in Salt Lake's food scene. By AIMEE L. COOK\nSalt Lake foodies are always on the lookout for new dishes, presentations and variations on a theme at their favorite eateries and bars. From distinctive entrees to specialty drinks, new food concepts are popping up in every corner of the city. Food gurus are layering flavors and textures to help elevate ingredients and create original and extraordinary offerings. It all starts with experimentation, innovation and simple inspiration, as these local food influencers and bloggers point out below:\nPop Ups I'm loving the proliferation of pop-ups, where chefs and bartenders are testing concepts with relatively low stakes. Our OG pop-up pioneer, chef Katie Weinner (@slcpop), is still going strong with sharable pick-up meals featuring her unique flair for flavor. The Monday pop-up burger night at Central 9th Market has lines around the block. And the wizards from Water Witch pulled off the granddaddy of all pop-up bars at Acme Bar Co. in December (check out the Suckerfish tiki experience while it lasts). Our chronically stodgy DABS even picked up the ball with a pop-up liquor store during the NBA All-Star weekend. I, for one, am excited to see what'll pop up next.\n—Darby Doyle Find food, drinks and outdoors writer @darby.doyle and at darbydoyle.com.\nEvolution of the Bar Scene One of my favorite trends to have been an eager bystander to these past 18 months or so has been our ever-evolving bar scene. Increasingly, some of the best food in town can be found at our 21+ only spots. It's no longer food direct from the freezer to fryer at many of the best bars. Downtown's Copper Common (@coppercommon) has grown by leaps and bounds in recent times, reinventing itself with a freshly invigorated menu. The specifics are always in flux, but if you can catch it, the lamb merguez meatballs in a svelte squash puree are excellent—the same goes for the smoked trout rillette.\nTommy Nguyen over at the The Pearl Bar & Kitchen (@thepearlslc) in the Central 9th neighborhood is plating absolutely unforgettable Vietnamese cuisine right now, and many of the dishes are family recipes; similarly, Bictor Tirado at Beehive Distilling (@beehivedistilling) in South Salt Lake is up to something similar. Three words—al pastor sliders.\nThe most recent icing on the cake is Post Office Place (@postslc), which secured a James Beard nod for outstanding bar, grabbing the baton from the illustrious Water Witch before them. They say you can't get a drink in Utah, but they're wrong—and these days, you'll be able to snag a fabulous meal, too.\n—Stuart Melling Founder, writer and wrangler at Gastronomic SLC, Utah's biggest and oldest online food magazine. Find Melling at gastronomicslc.com and @gastronomicslc\nCrafted Cocktails and Locally Sourced Ingredients The food culture in SLC is continuously evolving and improving. It's nice to see more high-end restaurants and choices popping up around SLC. I especially love two trends I've noticed in the luxury dining scene: First, restaurants are placing more focused efforts into uniquely beautiful liquor and mocktail creations. Secondly, I love that Salt Lake's high-end restaurants are using locally sourced, quality ingredients when they can. Urban Hill (@urbanhillslc), Franklin Avenue (@franklinaveslc), Mar | Muntanya (@marmuntanyaslc), Italian Graffiti (@eatitaliangraffiti), Monarca (@monarca_dining) and Aqua Terra Steak & Sushi (@aquaterrasteaksushi) are some of my favorite new places that have delicious and unique cocktails, source local ingredients and integrate Utah inspiration into their cuisine.\n—Cindy England Utah native, featured on the Food Network, KUTV and Diners Drive-ins and Dives. Follow on IG @UTfoodie.\nBuilding a Community Utah's restaurant and hospitality industry continues to connect to the community by elevating our palates, expanding our minds and nourishing our souls. They do all this while infusing each dining experience with the most essential ingredient: love. Our culinary landscape has become more diverse. It's bringing in richer and bolder flavors while still honoring the tried-and-true foundational cornerstones of our industry, such as being accessible, inclusive and hospitality-centric. The state has exploded with culturally unique flavors and is celebrating culinary craft—whether in the form of gastronomy, artisan bread or sophisticated beverages, both for those who enjoy a local spirit or beer along with those who forgo alcoholic beverages. More dynamic dining choices and opportunities for food and beverage education are popping up all over the place! I've loved witnessing Utah restaurant patrons be more willing to try unfamiliar foods while supporting new food-centric community experiences all over the state.\n—Katy Sine A storyteller and hospitality lover who showcases the unique people and offerings of Utah's food community through Taste Utah in partnership with the Utah Restaurant Association. Follow @TasteUtah, TasteUtah.com\nThe Plant-Forward Sector Continues to Grow Local restaurants have experienced increased demand for meat-alternative and plant-based options for quite some time, but the plant-forward sector continues to grow, especially in the Salt Lake City area. Plant-forward is a style of cooking and eating that emphasizes plant-based foods where limited meat intake is acceptable. What used to be referred to as \"Meatless Monday\" has catapulted into increased meat-free meals each week, therefore more options are being offered (on and off menu) by restaurants to appease and capture this expanding demographic. Whether this particular demand is due to environmental concerns, a focus on personal health, higher meat pricing or better-quality plant-based food or all of the above, this trend seems to be here to stay.\n—Jennifer Burns Host of more than 3,000 TV cooking segments and author of the cookbook Cooking Delight. Follow her for recipes and restaurant finds on Instagram and TikTok @jbcookinghost\nConvenience Is Key Quick and convenient ordering systems have emerged in some of the most unlikely locations. Many fast-casual eateries offer ordering kiosks, where diners can confidently order food with options that are inclusive of vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free diets. Additionally, QR code menus while dining in are more the norm, allowing a simple culinary exploration, that diners can revisit throughout their meal, hopefully making dining out more enjoyable than ever before. For those who mostly enjoy eating in the comfort of their own home, more and more restaurants have embraced delivery that has further made eating foods from your favorite restaurants more accessible.\n— Aimee L.

Cook's culinary adventures @gathernoshandsavor or gathernoshandsavor.com\nRESTAURANT DIRECTORY\nTry Something New Check out these new-ish additions to the Salt Lake dining scene. By Thomas Crone\nFor a while, we stayed home and learned to bake bread and shake martinis while zooming our friends, but those dark days are behind us. We're cruising for burgers again. And all of sudden, the shuttered diners and empty malls and new housing developments across the valley have \"had some work done\" and are lighting up with delightful new offerings, so much so, that it's hard to keep up. We've compiled this list of 20 new-ish spots, so you can schedule a visit and see what the buzz is about. See you out there.\nYumz! Vegan Cafe If State Street has anything, well, it has... everything. So a spot that sells vegan Mexican and Puerto Rican food is a perfect complement to the myriad other restaurants that call State Street home, though few do so with the exact blend of meat-free, family-friendly vibes of Yumz!, which quickly established itself as a linchpin of the local vegan dining scene. Unsurprising, too, is that a kid-friendly restaurant like this would be a strong purveyor of sweets, so if you're thinking of tackling a plate of tacos here, do consider leaving just a bit of room for dessert. 3490 S. State, South Salt Lake, 801-590-8092\nOromian Restaurant Rundassa Eshete's Oromian Restaurant is one of State Street's real wins, a place that's flipped a former pawn shop into an authentic Ethiopian restaurant featuring his sister, Bullallee Eshete, as the acclaimed new spot's chef. They offer a variety of East African fare with a heavy emphasis on vegetarian dishes and shareable options. 1522 S. State, SLC, 801-978-9673, oromianrestaurant.com\nAqua Terra Steak + Sushi Washington state's Ascend Hospitality Group brings this concept to life, an intriguing blend of game cuts, sushi, sake cocktails, a superior wine list and a warm, inviting atmosphere. And since steak is right there in the name, consider any beef items (including, of course, steak) to be among the best picks from this restaurant's menu. 50 S. Main, Ste. 168, SLC, 385-261-2244, aquaterrasteak.com\nNoemi's Café and Catering Now in the old strip mall location that used to be Ganesh's, Midvale's Noemi's Cafe comes from the direct lineage of a truck called Noemi's Catering, a business that established this Chilean cuisine in the local consciousness. They do a lot of things right, but steak? Last fall, City Weekly's own Alex Springer gushed that \"Every single bite of steak on the lomo saltado at Noemi's is perfectly cooked, so when you line up that perfect bite of fry, onion, tomato and steak, all you get is pleasure.\" So, yeah, maybe give it a try, or find another dish that hits the spot, with Noemi's excelling at everything from seafood to sweets. 777 E. Fort Union Blvd., Midvale, 801-979-7888/\nAngry Korean Growing out of the food truck model that's brought so many brick-and-mortar restaurants to Salt Lake, the Angry Korean's first restaurant took root in South Jordan in 2019 offering a solid take on Korean street food, with some nods to fusion. Launching their second eatery in May 2022 in Cottonwood Heights (and perhaps more to come), chefs Young-Ho Kang and Peter Kim were recently honored as semi-finalists for the annual James Beard Foundation awards, among a small selection of SLC locations to get that nod amidst a five-state region. 6945 S. 1300 East, Cottonwood Heights, 801-441-1022; 11587 S. District Main Drive Ste. 300, South Jordan, 801-307-8300, theangrykorean.com\nMama Coco Kitchen Soul food (be it baked, boiled or fried) and sweets are the appeals of Mama Coco, a proper new fit in a strip mall on Main Street not far from the Chinatown Mall near 3300 South. Po'boys made with chicken, shrimp and fish are at the heart of the menu here, but so are waffle meals and all manner of sides. With what has to be the thinnest web presence of any restaurant on this list, it appears that a walk through the door is the best way to get familiar with the offerings here. 3357 S. Main, South Salt Lake, 725-247-2046\nNeutral Ground Calling on flavors from Louisiana kitchens, Neutral Ground brings an updated and elevated spin on menu items such as alligator tacos, crawfish mac'n'cheese and fried green tomatoes. The physical space also plays with some NOLA elements without overwhelming diners and drinkers. Speaking of which, the bar program is geared towards \"proper whiskey,\" though fans of beer, wine and spirits will be satisfied with their options as well. 2110 W. North Temple, SLC, 801-953-0443, nglounge.com\nWoodbine Food Hall The Granary District scored big with the introduction of Woodbine Food Hall, a space that currently features 3 Cups, Deadpan Sandwich, Mozz, Yakuza Ramen, Taco Lady, Louisiana and W Cocktail Bar. Facilities like this, blending a host of different food 'n' drink options under one roof, are all the rage across the U.S., and Salt Lake's newest play on the concept brings together spots that're a well-matched group, with divergent tastes and menus collectively featured Tuesday through Saturday. 545 W. 700 South, SLC, 801-669-9192, SLC, woodbineslc.com\nUrban Hill Brought to life by the folks behind Park City's Hearth and Hill restaurant and Hill's Kitchen café and catering, Urban Hill is a sharp-looking affair in the Post District, featuring a wood-fired grill in the heart of the open kitchen. With an emphasis on quality sourcing and a kitchen staff that's pulled the best in town, Urban Hill's menu covers most proteins well, but fish is given a definite star turn. A large bar area and a patio (that'll be kicking come spring) augment the big, beautiful dining room. 510 S. 300 West, SLC, 385-295 4200, urban-hill.com\nItalian Graffiti In City Weekly's first issue of the year, Alex Springer topped himself with this zinger of a thought re: Italian Graffiti, which, he notes \"comes to us from Nice Hospitality Group, which excels at creating restaurants that have, for lack of a better term, strong-ass vibes. While quality food and an exciting menu remain front and center, these restaurants strive to take their diners on an escapist journey.\" The greenery and floral décor no doubt contribute to the vibe. Chef Marc Marrone's food at this Gateway eatery, though, is centered around pastas, steaks, seafood and items from in-house artisan bakery. 156 S. 400 West, SLC, 385-281-8373, italiangraffiti.com\nMi Buena Vida This 2022 debut comes compliments of Utah restaurateur Alan Galeano, who operates El Chubasco and Don Gallo in Park City among eight restaurant holdings. This 15th & 15th neighborhood \"truly Mexican\" spot features traditional items such as burritos, tortas, tacos and tostadas and provides a nice counterpoint to other area staples such as the nearby Caputo's. 1500 S. 1500 East, SLC, 385-229-4812, mibuenavidaslc.com/\nEmigration Cafe Opening in April 2022 in the Yalecrest neighborhood—and drawing on customers from well outside that geographic boundary—Emigration Cafe's got folks covered with breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner served seven days a week (minus a Sunday dinner service). With a heavy emphasis on well-executed, classic American favorites, restaurateur Scott Evans has another hit on his hands. The addition of Logos Coffee adds to this excellent, day-round destination. 1709 E. 1300 South, SLC, 801-906-8101, emigrationcafe.com\nThe Dough Miner This spot in Maven West (an apartment community in the Maven District) hit upon a unique notion: that people in SLC wanted to try the many variations of, yes, dough. And all in a single locale. Located just across the road from T.F. Brewing, Dough Miner serves up a common favorite like a bagel or a donut alongside items that might have a touch more of a niche audience, the fans of kolaches, say, or Cornish pasties, which are the signature dish of Dough Miner. Though open seven days a week, there's a chance that you might not be able to get your favorite treat later in the afternoon, as \"selling out\" means \"closed\" at Dough Miner. So plan your trip accordingly and don't be shy in asking about the joy that is the Cornish pasty. 945 S. 300 West, Ste. 101, SLC, 385-334-3389, doughminer.com\nFranklin Ave. Cocktails and Kitchen Officially opened in June 2022 by the Bourbon Group, \"Franklin Avenue\" refers to the building's first incarnation as the Franklin Avenue Variety Theatre, built in the 1890s. There's a swashbuckling history inside 231 S. Edison, dating back a century, when it was a bit of a speakeasy, sporting house and gastronomic hub, all in one place. These days, some of those vices have been given the boot, but a revamped building and the food and drink remain. And they excel at those things, tackling modern American fare with aplomb, along with a top-notch beverage program. 231 S. Edison St., SLC, 385-831-7560, franklinaveslc.com\nPretty Bird Hot Chicken You'd be forgiven for thinking that all new restaurants in the Beehive State are serving up variations of spicy chicken, and Pretty Bird's a big part of this not-a-problem. The chain's growth in town is due to a nationwide trend to love all these yardbird dishes, sure, but there's just something special about the way that Pretty Bird handles simple items like tenders. Maybe there're only four Pretty Birds flying in our region today (the original Regent Street location downtown, Sugar House, then in 2022, both Park City and Midvale) but would it surprise you to see this name hit 10, 20, more? It shouldn't. They're that good. Multiple locations, prettybirdchicken.com\nLibertango Steakhouse Steakhouses with lineage in Brazil and Argentina are typically un-shy in speaking about their general sense of exquisite taste, be it the food served to you, the music played overhead, the drinks accompanying one's meal. Libertango, which opened in December 2022, is such a place, self-confident and deservedly so, with a steak list, obviously, that headlines this Sandy's restaurant's bill of fare. They also offer a considerable menu including salads, pastas and rice dishes that are several notches above the ordinary. When a place can brag on its sides as well as its signature dishes, well, it's got something special. 10395 S. State, Sandy, 801-448-6449, libertango.us\nThe Juice Shop What's especially pleasing about the food menu at The Juice Shop in the Maven District is that the menu is relatively small, playing to the strengths of this health-inclined kitchen. There're salads/bowls, toasts and a handful of snacks. Barring a special or two, these are your options, though there's range within each category. Hot beverages, loaded smoothies and, of course, fresh-pressed juices are also there for you, with items like Liquid Sunshine (golden beet, carrot, orange, ginger, turmeric) beaming with healthy radiance. 888 S. 200 East, SLC, 801-203-0877, thejuiceshopslc.com\nYoko Taco Long in the planning process, Yoko Taco anchors the corner storefront of theRUTH apartment complex, located just a stone's throw from the complementary Fisher Brewing. Noted for farm-fresh ingredients, local sourcing and a small, nimble taco menu, Yoko Taco (sister restaurant to Yoko Ramen) is hitting its stride after a delayed build-out. The pig's ear taco is a must, for those inclined towards an adventurous order. 285 W. 800 South, SLC, 385-218-4325, yokotacoslc.com\nThe Pearl A bar first and foremost, The Pearl is also a new cozy hip spot to savor chef (and co-owner) Tommy Nguyen's mouthwatering Vietnamese-style pub fare. Offerings such as banh mi, pork skewers, Kim's (aka Mom's) egg rolls, caramel pork belly and fish sauce wings are all lip-smacking. Pair the exquisite dishes with crafted cocktails that expand on the Asian theme—there's the Plum Job (Suntory Toki Whisky, lemon, honey and Shades plum sour ale) and the Ca Phe (Averna, robusta, chicory and coco dan). There's also Sunday brunch (11 a.m. to 2 p.m.) and live jazz on Wednesdays. You can order pho here, but only on Sundays, starting at 6 p.m. 917 S. 200 West, SLC\nTraining Table The name rings out to a true Utahn, with The Training Table's pair of dipping sauces the stuff of legend. With those now available for purchase online (sad Salt Lakers were trying to recreate sauces in their kitchens from scratch prior to TT's return last year), The Training Table is sending food trucks into the community to further strengthen the brand before the arrival of a new brick-and-mortar shop in 2023. Family lawsuits now sorted out after the restaurant's closure in 2016, the hearts of cheese fry fans throughout the regions are singing with TT's return—though no word yet if the tabletop landline phones will be back, at least for nostalgia's sake. thetrainingtable.com\nClassy, Sassy Hotel Dining? Locals seem to like what these downtown SLC hotel chains are cooking up. By Aimee L. Cook\nHotel chains, in general, have a reputation for lackluster dining. There are, however, always exceptions, and downtown Salt Lake City boasts several outstanding hotel dining experiences. Offering elegant ambiance, food quality worthy of special occasions plus topnotch service that exceeds expectations, it's no wonder locals venture here on purpose instead of letting out-of-town guests have all the enjoyment. Who says hotel dining has to be boring? These eateries are attractions in their own right:\nMar | Muntanya at the Hyatt Regency Located on the sixth floor of the newly built Hyatt Regency Salt Lake City, this rooftop restaurant boasts downtown/mountain views you can enjoy while savoring Chef Tyson Peterson's dishes inspired by the flavors of northern Spain that utilize fresh ingredients from Utah and the surrounding region. Funeral croquettas ($18) are a fun play on Utah's funeral potato dish. The roasted elk tenderloin ($35) with potato puree and blackberry jus is the stuff of cravings. Don't sleep on the paella ($40), a savory dish filled with seafood, proteins, veggies and rice. Mar | Muntanya is also open for weekend brunch. 170 S. West Temple, 801-596-1234, hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/utah/hyatt-regency-salt-lake-city/slcrs/dining\nSalt Republic at the Hyatt Regency The Salt Republic is the full-service bistro on the main floor on the new Hyatt Regency serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. Entrees range from rotisserie chicken to steaks and rainbow trout. The sausage board ($22) includes a daily selection of artisan sausages, mustards and maple onion jam. Then enjoy an organic half chicken ($32) with a choice of sauce and salt. Try the house wine, Canvas, for the perfect pairing, produced for the Hyatt locations by the Michael Mondavi family. 170 S. West Temple, 801-596-1234, hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/utah/hyatt-regency-salt-lake-city/slcrs/dining\nThe Coffee Shop at the Little America As soon as you sit down, you'll be greeted with a delicious soft, warm roll that will tantalize your taste buds and have your mouth watering before the main course arrives. Indulge in some top-notch scratch-made dishes, including their famous bran muffin. The chicken noodle soup here is a must even when it's sweltering outside. The open-faced turkey dinner or the prime rib special also should not be missed—both perfectly cooked with all the fixings, comfort on a plate. 550 S. Main, SLC, 801-596-5711, saltlake.littleamerica.com\nThe Laurel Brasserie & Bar at the Grand America The newly remodeled area that is now The Laurel will surround you in luxury and infuse your dining with flavor. Experience a main restaurant, three private dining rooms and an exclusive 21+ bar area that offers two daily happy hours to savor craft cocktails while indulging in discounted menu items. Executive chef Fernando Soberanis has crafted enticing dishes that rotate through the seasons. Staples like the pigs in a blanket ($10) or the French onion soup ($12) are always great choices. If you're in the mood for something more substantial, delight your taste buds with the tempting pan-seared branzino ($35.50). It's time to treat yourself! Weekend brunch is also popular at The Laurel. 555 S. Main, SLC, 801-258-6708, laurelslc.com\nBambara at the Kimpton Hotel Monaco Perhaps best known for their blue cheese house-cut potato chips (elevated by the addition of harissa on the crispy chips), chef Patrick LeBeau is bringing his culinary touch to the menu of new American bistro dishes. The chef's favorite—the Kurobuta pork shoulder, plated on top of a sweet-potato puree, pumpkin seeds and savory Cotija cheese—showcases flavors from his time in Kansas City. Or try the perfectly prepared Black Angus filet mignon with mustard potato puree, slow-roasted kale, and for a tangy zip, topped with a truffle bordelaise. Balanced dishes in Bambara's sumptuous setting of arched windows and an exhibition kitchen make Bambara a favorite spot for locals. 202 S. Main, SLC, 801-363-5454, bambara-slc.com\nAdelaide at Le Méridien The newest hotel to open in downtown Salt Lake City, Le Méridien features Van Ryder, the first full-scale rooftop bar, and Adelaide, a full-service restaurant located on the ground floor. This urban brasserie serves breakfast through dinner utilizing local ingredients and crafting dishes with a French and New Orleans flair. Méridien beignets—with powdered sugar, raspberries and lemon curd—are a delicious way to start your day, while the shrimp po'boy or the egg salad sandwich make good lunch choices. For dinner, wood-fired creations like charbroiled bison sirloin with potato pave, béarnaise noisette, celeriac and hen-of-the-wood mushroom is sure to satisfy the hearty eater. Smaller dishes such as the fingerling potato casserole with Tartufo cheddar, cochon (pork) and scallions can be shared or enjoyed as the star of a meal. Adelaide also offers an oyster and raw bar along with artisan cocktails. The menu of executive chef Jacqueline Siao is globally influenced and executed beautifully. 131 S. 300 West, SLC, 801-839-7878, adelaidesaltlake.com\nFlavortown's Where the Heart Is City Weekly's dining critic has his own list of 'triple Ds' to rival Guy Fieri's. By Alex Springer\nWhen Guy Fieri, the frosty-haired mayor of Flavortown himself, has come to Utah, he's barely scratched the surface of the diner culture that Salt Lake Valley has to offer.\nAccording to the Food Network, Fieri's TV show, Diner, Drive-ins and Dives, has featured some 20 eateries in the Salt Lake Valley (not including those we fondly miss, such as Blue Plate Dinner, Aristo's and Maxwell's). Fieri's cruised to the following eateries, all of which deserved the honors:\n• Arempas, SLC\n• Curry Fried Chicken, SLC\n• Curry Pizza, West Valley City\n• Finn's Café, SLC\n• Hruska's Kolaches, SLC\n• Kobe Japanese, Millcreek\n• Laziz Kitchen, SLC\nLuckily, I've based my food writing career on Utah's hidden gems and roadside attractions—each of which more than succeed at satiating that craving we all get for something with no frills and big flavors. We're rollin' out—here is my insider's guide to Salt Lake's finest diners, drive-ins and dives. (Note: I also picked a couple of Fieri's (without knowing), which are indicated with his head in the description.)\nThe Belgian Waffle & Omelet Inn When you think of the word \"diner,\" chances are you're imagining The Belgian Waffle. It's open 24 hours, serves breakfast any time, and its Naugahyde upholstery has seen more than 40 years' worth of customers come and go. As the name implies, you'll want to give their waffle combos a whirl, but if you're looking for something savory, sloppy and perfect in every way, the Garbage Hash will be right up your alley. 7331 S. 900 East, Midvale, 801-566-5731, thebelgianwaffles.com\nBhutan House It's tough to beat a heaping plate of curry, rice and naan when it comes to comfort food. Bhutan House shares this sentiment, and brings the nuanced flavors of India, Bhutan and Nepal to their offerings. All of your favorite Indian curries are here to party, but it's the Chili Momo Dumplings that really cement their place as a purveyor of food that speaks to your soul. It's a smoky, spicy celebration of the Bhutanese flavor profiles, and a must for fans of these stuffed dumplings. 1241 E. 8600 South, Sandy, 801-679-0945, bhutanhouserestaurant.com\nBig Tortas A word of warning before rolling up to one of the Big Tortas locations around town—make sure you haven't eaten anything for at least two days before you try to solo one of their gargantuan Mexican tortas. That said, you may also want to do a bit of research beforehand since their menu contains pages of torta permutations—if you're a fan of breakfast sandwiches, you can get the huevo con jamon or the huevo con chorizo, or if you're a fan of pot roast you can try the suadero. Honestly, it's hard to think of a protein option you can't get on one of these famous tortas. Multiple locations, bigtortas.com\nChanon Thai Café One rule of Utah dining is that if your restaurant operates out of a space that was once a house, you're probably in good shape. Chanon is one such example—it's a local Thai restaurant that prepares all the staples with a keen eye for all the tasty details. If you're a connoisseur of spicy food, Chanon will happily oblige you with the guya-teaw pad kee mao, which features thick noodles stir fried in a spicy sauce with some broccoli, red peppers and a few Thai chilis for good measure. Just make sure you know what you're doing when you order this one up. 278 E. 900 South, SLC, 801-532-1177, chanonthaislc.com\nThe Cotton Bottom With its roots in biker bar culture and its location near the mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon, The Cotton Bottom has become an important fixture for those road tripping into the mountains. Since time immemorial, the signature item at The Cotton Bottom has been the garlic cheeseburger. A burger, you say? But when your order arrives and you look at the hubcap-size bun struggling to contain a pair of ground chuck patties, and once you smell that heady garlic aroma, you know you're in for something special. If you're headed into Big Cottonwood Canyon for any reason, a stop at The Cotton Bottom is a moral imperative. 2820 E. 6200 South, Millcreek, 801-849-8847, thecottonbottom.com\nCrown Burgers Utahns love our fast food, but we really love it when one of our own burger chains starts to take off. Consider Crown Burgers, the Utah pioneer that introduced the pastrami burger into our state's culinary zeitgeist. Of course, Crown Burger features an extensive menu that includes everything from fish and chips to Greek souvlaki, but usually you're getting their signature Crown Burger when you pay this place a visit. It's a cheeseburger with all the trimmings that gets a generous stack of pastrami piled between its sesame seed buns. Sure, you might think you've had a pastrami burger before, but once you try a Crown Burger, you'll understand what you've been missing. Multiple locations, crown-burgers.com\nCurry in a Hurry There are plenty of spots that are reimagining Indian and Pakistani food as fast-casual restaurants, but Curry in a Hurry still manages to provide a bit of its own style to the operation. They usually have two or three varieties of curry and sides depending on the day of your visit. They're kept hot all day, so you just need to pop in, select the curry combo you want, and then either pop back out or bring your food to the countertop that looks out onto the bustle of State Street. As each recipe is based in the history of the Nisar family who owns the restaurant, you're always in for a consistently tasty meal. 2020 S. State, SLC, 801-467-4137, ilovecurryinahurry.com\nFat Jack's Burger Emporium For those after burgers that have a slight air of attitude around them, your search ends here at Fat Jack's Burger Emporium. Their claim to fame is the copper-topped pub burger with a bun toasted to crisp perfection. The local favorite in this arsenal is the Mormon Burger, which comes topped with funeral potatoes, Utah's proudest contribution to culinary culture. For the uninitiated, funeral potatoes are a potato and cheese casserole that usually gets topped with something crispy like corn flakes cereal. Fat Jack's makes the whole thing into a croquette-like patty and adds it to a bacon and pepper jack cheeseburger. It's exactly as tasty as it sounds. 206 S. West Temple, SLC, 801-890-5155, fatjacksut.com\nFishOn Bistro Fish and chips often gets overlooked despite how awesome it is, which is why FishOn Bistro needs a bit of recognition. They offer both beer-battered cod and salmon from the icy waters of Alaska, along with all the fries, tartar sauce and malt vinegar that you could want. Places that set their focus on just one menu item have a special place in my heart since you know they've spent their careers working to improve their signature dish. FishOn is a must for anyone who thinks fish and chips are as underrated as I do. Restaurant: 4700 S. 900 East, Ste. 19, Millcreek, 385-349-3490, fishongourmet.com\nItalian Village Italian food is as much about the vibe at the restaurant as it is about the menu. At Italian Village, a family-owned joint in the heart of Murray, the vibes have been welcoming and warm since 1968. All your favorite Italian classics are here, and many of them can be served up as combos with pizza and subs. For lunch, you can't go wrong with the Pizza Bender, a calzone that can be served up with any three-topping pizza combination. If you're craving Italian food served up by a family that truly knows what they're doing, it's time to check out Italian Village. 5370 S. 900 East, Murray, 801-266-4182, italianvillageslc.com\nKaiser's Barbeque and General Store I've always thought Kaiser's Barbeque was like a little slice of the Texas landscape that got transplanted to Utah. Before you get to the counter to place your order, take a minute to peruse the tchotchkes on display at the general store—this is where you can snag some of the place's signature barbecue sauce, which is also well worth it. From there, you can't really go wrong—barbecue fans will be happy with Kaiser's pork ribs, pulled pork and brisket, all of which can be ordered as part of a combination plate. If it's Texas and it's barbecue, you can find it at Kaiser's. 962 S. 300 West, SLC, 801-355-0499, saltlakebbq.com\nLazy Day Café Here we have a traditional diner that has adapted to the hip needs of its Millcreek neighborhood—it's a cool place to grab breakfast, lunch or dinner. Anyone who's been here will tell you that the lemon pancakes are a must, and this is a correct assessment. They're big, fluffy and leave your mouth tingling with their subtle lemon flavor. Of course, you also can't go wrong with their shrimp and grits or their chicken and waffles. In addition to their lineup of traditional favorites, they have plenty of plant-based options that are equally delicious. 2020 E. 3300 South, Ste. 24, Millcreek, 801-953-0311, lazydaycafe.net\nLeatherby's Though Leatherby's has a standard menu of dishes like cheese fries, burgers and sandwiches, locals all know that you go to Leatherby's when you want to have dessert for dinner. Known for their towering sundaes that offer riffs on everything from strawberry shortcake to churros to enormous banana splits, Leatherby's is destination dining for anyone who enjoys ice cream, which is pretty much everyone. Make sure you plan your visit with enough time if you happen to be visiting on weekends. Multiple locations, leatherbys.com\nLoco Burger This recent addition to our diner scene has been making a splash among local diners with its torta-inspired burgers. Right up to the gooey melted cheese and the grilled salchichas, Loco Burger is bringing all the stackable charm of a Mexican torta to the world of cheeseburgers, and it's a hit. The Loco Burger team was considerate enough to include a burger that has every possible topping on it, you know, for those who have a tough time making up their minds. Yup, it's got ham, salchichas, bacon and pork loin in addition to the cheese, avocado and burger—do not attempt unless you've adequately starved yourself. 1702 S. Main, SLC, 801-505-8187, locoburger.com\nMoochie's Meatballs and More Our finest representation of the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich comes from Moochie's. From the fresh-baked bread to the thinly sliced steak to the cheese whiz, they get everything right. Of course, even sandwich fans who don't dote on the cheesesteak will be happy here. Their meatball sub is a pillar of the local sandwich community, much of its merit due to the gigantic meatballs made in-house every day. Some under-the-radar sandwiches to check out would be the eggplant parmigiana and their cold hoagie known as the Italian deli. Slather on the jalapeño mayo, grab some fried cheese curds, and watch your worries just melt away. Multiple locations, moochiesmeatballs.com\nMr. Charlie's Chicken Fingers Regardless of where you place your diner loyalties, something about chicken fingers always hits home. It's this cosmic truth that powers Mr. Charlie's, whose cage-free chicken fingers have helped usher in Utah's current obsession with fried chicken. Purists can get the fingers and fries, though I prefer their po' boys—the Nashville version comes tossed in a hot honey sauce that is to die for. If you're looking to treat yourself, their chicken and waffles is an excellent indulgence, but if you've ever tried and liked a chicken finger, you'll fall in love with Mr. Charlie's. Multiple locations, mrcharlies.com\nOh Mai Sandwich Kitchen With all this talk of sandwiches, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Oh Mai Sandwich Kitchen. Their selection of banh mi sandwiches is among the finest you can get in town. The spicy beef short rib turns up the heat with kimchi and sriracha—perfect for fans of the hot stuff. Then you've got the honey glazed pork that is more sweet and savory. All of their banh mi come with pickled carrot, daikon, cilantro and sliced jalapeño pepper, and you can't really go wrong whatever you order. As tasty as their sandwich menu is, Oh Mai's pho noodle soup is also excellent—if you're super hungry it's fun to order a banh mi and some pho and then dunk the former into the latter. Multiple locations, ohmaisandwichkitchen.com\nOne More Noodle House It's hard to set yourself apart from the other dynamite restaurants within South Salt Lake's Chinatown commercial area, but One More Noodle House has done exactly that. It probably has something to do with their homemade noodles and staggering variety of soup to choose from. As much as I try to branch out when I visit this restaurant, I can't help but get drawn back into the intoxicating aromas and vibrant flavors of their Sichuan beef noodle soup. Packed with plenty of Sichuan spice—you know, the kind that makes your tongue go comfortably numb—and tender chunks of beef, this is an instant comfort food classic. 3370 S. State, Ste. N5, 801-906-8992, onemorenoodlehouse.com\nThe Original Pancake House For those whose breakfast is defined by stacks upon stacks of steaming pancakes, The Original Pancake House is a holy place. An entire page of their menu is dedicated to pancakes and their possible variations—pecan pancakes, sourdough pancakes, banana pancakes—all the greats are there. It's always tempting to simply lean in to the warm, welcoming arms of OPH's hotcakes, but they've got some other breakfast gems that deserve your attention. The Dutch baby, for example, is a traditional breakfast treat that takes a bit of time to prepare, but it's so worth it. In short, it's the king of all pancakes—hot, fluffy and almost souffle-like in its look and feel. If you've got a bit of time, consider putting this baby in a corner. Multiple locations, ophutah.com\nThe Other Place At its most basic level, The Other Place is a diner that whips up a solid cadre of breakfast mainstays that can't be beat. Once you dig a little deeper, however, you start to realize that you're also in one of the best Greek restaurants Salt Lake has to offer. Diving into any part of the menu is a treat, but I like where \"breakfast\" and \"Greek\" meet with the spectacular gyro omelet. Using a traditional omelet as its canvas, this one gets some flavorful gyro meat, onions, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes and buttery feta cheese. There are few pleasures greater than eating an omelet that tastes like a gyro. 469 E. 300 South, SLC, 801-521-6567, theotherplacerestaurant.com\nOver the Counter Café Though the coffee shop vibe might imply a bit of restraint when it comes to the food at Over the Counter, one look at their monstrous pancakes or heaping omelets helps put things into perspective. Whether you're dining here for breakfast or lunch, there will always be something you can add bacon to, which is an important consideration for any diner. The French toast here is always a banger, as are their eggs Benedict, and their omelets are excellent. On top of all these great options, they have gluten-free pancakes as well as kombucha, which is one of the myriad reasons that the coolness level of this place is so high. 2343 E. 3300 South, Millcreek, 801-487-8725, overthecountercafeslc.com\nPenny Ann's Café Regardless of what most people think, there is plenty of nuance on the pancake spectrum. Texture, toppings, size—all of these things are important considerations. Creating a body of evidence like this is exactly why the heavenly hot cakes at Penny Ann's are so special. Sure, we have plenty of pancakes that are crispy and taste good with syrup, but Penny Ann's have managed to take the flavor from birthday cake and transfer it to their light, fluffy hotcakes, and they are explosive. Yes, they've got some of the best and meatiest omelets around, but you've got to try these heavenly hotcakes if you find yourself nearby. Multiple locations, pennyannscafe.com\nRuth's Diner In many ways, Ruth's Diner is the godmother of Utah's diner culture. The establishment has been around for decades—the train car that Ruth originally converted into a diner is still a part of the diner itself. There is no right way to approach a Ruth's diner meal. Their menu of Tex Mex favorites and creative Benedicts for breakfast is accessible and delicious. Upon ending the meal, however, you must do me a personal favor and order their chocolate malt pudding. Scoff if you may, but this is one of the best desserts in the state, bar none. Try me and you'll see. 4160 Emigration Canyon Road, Emigration Canyon, 801-582-5807, ruthsdiner.com\nVenezuela Mia We've had a few Venezuelan restaurants open up in the past decade or so, but none have embraced the gluttonous glory of Venezuelan cuisine quite like Venezuela Mia. Their main claim to fame is the cachapa, a soft corn pancake folded over some gooey Oaxaca cheese and then topped with everything from grilled chicken to brisket—or both, if you like. In addition to these stellar cachapas, Venezuela Mia has a full grill and smoke operation, which means protein lovers can come here and get more than their fill. This is one you'll want to visit when you're half-starved as the portions are immense. 9460 S. Union Square, Ste. 104, Sandy, 801-831-6420, vzlamia.com\nVictor's Tires & Restaurant If you're in town and in need of some tire work for your car, you might as well visit the repair shop that also has the best tamales in the city. You can get some perfectly solid tacos, flautas and burritos here, don't get me wrong. But if you want to get your socks knocked all the way off, you go for their tamales. I like to go for the smothered tamales so that soft masa dough can soak up the smoky flavor of the red sauce, but you can also go for the Victor's Special which serves them up without sauce. Either way, you'll be glad you ran over a nail if you can pay Victor's a visit. 1406 S. 700 West, SLC, 801-326-6182, victorsrestaurant.com\nTastes of Home There are cravings we have when Salt Lake is out of reach.

By Mark Dago\nNo one needs to worry about the future of vinyl, especially in Salt Lake City. Not only do many major-label artists still release their music on wax, locals do it as well. Collecting records has become a timeless process across generations that doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. Streaming is convenient, but the tangible factor of vinyl is irreplaceable—the experience of holding something with your hands while you talk about why you like that particular artist or group is just not the same with digital media. Plus, artwork never looks better than it does on an old LP. Or a new LP.\nShuffling through a Spotify playlist is maximum blasé, and all of us music-lovers should be about reintroducing \"browsing\" our local vinyl establishments as a concept. If you are into the experience of spinning an LP on a turntable, then let's run down some hard to find wax platters and explore some of the best record shops in Salt Lake City.\nGraywhale Entertainment Go for: Gems from across the board. Established in 1986, Graywhale Entertainment is one of Salt Lake's biggest record shops and has been for decades. Their specialty is having something for everyone, with an emphasis on indie pop, rock, metal and jazz. Buy/sell/trade is their business model, and this shop provides much more than just records. They carry turntables, record accessories, cassette tapes, CDs, DVDs and other memorabilia. They update inventory daily (featuring hot trade ins/re-stocks etc.) Friday is \"new release day,\" so they have their most prominent product updates on that day. They sponsor live events all year and host in-store performances. They absolutely love their customers and strive to give them not only a good selection but also an enjoyable experience.\nListen Up! (or cool story, bro): Cross Country (DJ- IG @webbpiercetribute) \"I came across a Webb Pierce album for the first time in Salt Lake City at Graywhale. The record I found was one of his gospel albums Bound for the Kingdom. The record had been inscribed as a gift at one time, and I was amazed that one of his gospel albums especially had made its way to SLC. I call these events finding a 'Webb in the Wild.'\" 1773 W. 4700 South, Taylorsville, 801-964-5700, graywhaleslc.com, IG @graywhaleslc\nRandy's Records Go for: Crowd pleasing go-tos. Located in Salt Lake's Maven District on 900 South, Randy's Records is a must-stop. Operating since 1978, with an inventory that's always in flux, Randy's offers Utah's largest selection of new and used records. Making the most of its minimal space, you could spend hours upon hours digging through stacks of new and used treasures. The potential is there to pull a copy of The Fat Boys Are Back for a decent price or bump elbows with celebrities and musicians alike. The staff is knowledgeable, and you'll likely find something new every time you walk in.\nListen Up! (or cool story, bro): Domino (DJ- IG @mysteriousfactories) \"I found Yellow Magic Orchestra at a $2 sale.

Diabolical is a great place from which to start building a collection, as they carry an impressive range of vinyl from vintage to new releases with no preference for genre. The store is neatly sorted with tidy racks, letting customers use the time they would normally spend thumbing through boxes to listen to groovy tunes instead. You'll find no pretension here as the owners, Adam and Alana, are helpful and friendly and provide fantastic suggestions. They carry the most local records of any store in the city. You simply cannot go wrong with Diabolical.\nListen Up! (or cool story, bro): Fischloops (music producer/DJ—IG @fischloops) \"I usually avoid new releases but somehow Adam at Diabolical has been able to rope me in.

(or cool story, bro): James Ramirez (DJ—@jamesbeard_esq): \"I got Impressions and Selflessness, two albums by John Coltrane on the Impulse! label which I purchased on Coltrane's birthday.

Located in Sugar House, Raunch houses skateboards and their affiliated paraphernalia in addition to its record selection. Like all the best music retailers, owner Brad Collins maintains a wonderful balance of new and old selections and exhibits keen instincts for the most important genre releases. The non-punk selection seems more limited by design but has frequently been known to generate some stellar finds. Back in the day, I recall picking up Milk and Cheese comic books here. I've never walked out empty-handed.\nListen Up! (or cool story, bro): Andy Patterson (recording engineer—facebook.com/andy.patterson.106) \"I purchased Pailhead (a collaboration of Ian from Fugazi & members of Ministry) at Raunch. Brad suggested it to me in like 1989-1990 saying, 'You'll probably like this shit. He was always right.'\" 1119 E. 2100 South, SLC, 801-467-6077, IG: @raunchrecords\nThe Heavy Metal Shop Go for: A one-stop metal shop Peddlin' evil since 1987, The Heavy Metal Shop caters to the metal scene. This downtown Salt Lake City landmark is small but mighty. It has everything from records to CDs, T-shirts and more. Not to mention prices that aren't straight from Discogs. Evidence of the rock store's prestige can be seen on the shop's walls, which are decorated with photos and autographs from the musical heroes who have thumbed through the store's bins. Icons like Alice Cooper and Slayer sport the shop clothing as well. In-store performances showcase local musicians and touring acts. If you're looking for a particular metal record, you could do worse than checking here first.\nListen Up (or cool story, bro): HH Rev.

They sponsor an in-house zine called the LQ, which pays and publishes LQBTQ+ artists in the Ogden area. They also have local tapes/records and CDs and will consign local music.

By Charles Johnson\nHow do you tell a story about some of the greatest modern-day mavericks Utah has seen since its statehood? Maybe the more important question is, how do you realize a dream in a state that refuses to support you?\nThe fear of being delisted is very real for most of our local distillers. The door between success and failure hinges on their being able to sell their products to a market that mostly has no idea they exist. They understand that pearl of business wisdom that says, \"That which cannot be seen, felt, heard, smelled or tasted will not be purchased.\"\nBut doesn't discovering something new send a thrill through you like nothing else? Why not discover Utah's unique distilleries and the ever-growing local spirits world. Let's start by introducing you to your local distilleries:\n'Southie' Area 1st Stop: Simplicity A relative newcomer to Utah's distilling community is Simplicity (335 W. 1830 South, Suite C, SLC, 801-210-0868, drinksimplicity.com). A self-proclaimed \"microdistillery,\" there's nothing micro about their determination and steadfast devotion to the art of crafting quality spirits. Since opening in 2018, founders Chris Weed and Chad Linville have created canned cocktails and distilled spirits that are anything but simple. Current offerings include a potato vodka, bourbon, bourbon cream and canned cocktails: Kuhl mule, Paloma Grapefruit, 4 different agave sodas, Moscow mule, gin rickey, vodka rita, vodka soda, margarita, bourbon mule, etc., but keep an eye on them because they are releasing new products all the time.\n2nd Stop: Sugar House Distillery One of Utah's first distilleries, Sugar House Distillery (2212 S. West Temple, Ste.14, South Salt Lake, 801-726-0403, sugarhousedistillery.net) has been crafting some truly amazing spirits from the first bottle corked. Established in January 2014, Sugar House Distillery is one of the first four small-batch distilleries to open in the state. Owner and lead distiller James Fowler is actively bringing you one of the state's first true grain-to-glass spirits you can buy. He is obviously a very influential member of the distilling community as many other distillers have followed suit, sourcing many if not all grains from Utah farmers.\nFrom milling to fermenting, distilling, barreling and finally bottling, it all happens in-house. They offer a vodka, white and gold rums, and three types of whiskies and canned cocktails. That doesn't include their special releases like the Boilermaker series and other finished whiskies. Give them a call and set up a time for a tour and a tasting to see for yourself why they are so successful.\n3rd Stop: Beehive Distilling Let's continue our adventure with Beehive Distilling (2245 S. West Temple, South Salt Lake, 385-259-0252, beehivedistilling.com). Opening their doors Jan. 1, 2014, Beehive Distilling became Utah's first gin distillery since 1870. It began as an idea tossed around by three friends lamenting Utah's notoriously strict distilling laws. Having worked together in advertising and photography for over 20 years, Matt Aller, Chris Barlow and Erik Ostling set about to create an organic sugarcane vodka, two types of gin and an amaro. In the summer of 2019, they launched a line of craft cocktails branded under the Desolation Distilling badge along with a rye whiskey offering.\nIf crafting some of the best spirits and canned cocktails in Utah isn't enough, they have also created one of the most inviting spaces in the state.\nP.S. They have a full bar! There is no better place to spend a Friday afternoon than sitting in one of their amazingly comfortable chairs in Southie (South Salt Lake!), staring off in wonder at their many-pennied bar, and enjoying a gimlet. If you're lucky, you may even catch a glimpse of the distiller's assistant, also known as Gimlet. Don't let her small stature fool you, though, she is definitely in charge! Not that I'm jealous or anything, but she has more Instagram followers than I do. If you're so inclined, look her up @gimletthecat.\n4th Stop: Dented Brick Distillery Dented Brick Distillery (3100 S. Washington St., Salt Lake City. 801-883-9837, dentedbrick.com) is the next stop on our adventure. First opening its doors in spring 2016, Dented Brick led with its first product, the Antelope Island Rum. They didn't stop there, however. Founder Marc Christensen and the good people behind the brand are inspiring the community by locally sourcing their grains and botanicals in the creation of their current products which include vodka, gin, whiskey and rum. Their Hugh Moon White Whiskey is made from 100% Cache Valley-grown rye along with perhaps the most important ingredient—artesian water. This water from the Wasatch mountains snowmelt flows into the distillery's own artesian well. This mineral-rich water makes all the difference. The namesake of the whiskey, Hugh Moon, was, according the Dented Brick folks, Utah's first known distiller of record, who actually distilled whiskey in the 1850s on the same land as Dented Brick's distillery for Mormon pioneers (with Brigham Young's blessing).\nThe Wild West 1st Stop: Hammer Spring Distillers Hammer Spring Distillers (3697 W. 1987 South, Salt Lake City, 801-599-4704, hammerspring.com) was founded in the spring of 2016. Hammer Spring is a self-funded, family-owned and -operated distillery that offers a high mountain experience in a bottle with their quality gin. Adding to their spirit library, how about a potato vodka? Why potatoes? Stop by the distillery for a tour and speak with founder JP Bernier and ask him. Or just try it and discover for yourself why he chose potatoes as the spirit medium. Did someone say bourbon?! Not yet? Well, let me clue you into a little secret, JP's small-batch craft bourbon is just getting better with each aged barrel. They also offer a coffee liqueur, and even \"JP's World-Famous Whiskey Pancake Syrup\", though I've been told this maybe going away. My waffles will never be the same.\n2nd Stop: Salt Flats Brewery & Spirits Not only is Salt Flats Brewery & Spirits (2020 Industrial Circle, Salt Lake City, 801-828-3469, saltflatsspirits.com) a distillery, it's also a highly respected brewery in Utah. As you can imagine with a name like Salt Flats, the theme here is all about the Go-Fast lifestyle complete with a checkered flag-inspired tap room. Not only that but the people behind the brand are no strangers to seeing that monochromatic tapestry, as they've won major awards for their spirits and canned cocktails. Current spirits include brandy, vodka, gin, a 6-year-old bourbon and a regular bourbon, along with many, many beers!\n3rd Stop: Waterpocket Distillery Waterpocket Distillery (2084 W. 2200 South, West Valley City. 385-202-5725, waterpocket.co) joined the Utah craft distillery scene early in 2017. Rum was an early focus for Alan and Julia Scott, but they also specialized in botanical craft spirits in their Toadstool, which are spirits that feature amaros, bitters and digestive liqueurs. Moreover, the Long Lost franchise focuses on lost distillation traditions in botanical spirits and liqueurs. The Robbers Roost label offers a curated rectified spirits such as aged whiskey based on their quality, value, and uniqueness, and as such the Robbers Roost Light Whiskey is a 10-year-old.\n4th Stop: Distillery 36 If rum is in your forecast, then you definitely need to stop by Distillery 36 (2374 S. Redwood Road, West Valley City, 801-983-7303, distillery36.com). Releasing their first product in January 2016, Distillery 36 offers many reasons to stop by for a tour. Jensen Dobbs and Creed Law, owner-operators, are proud of what they've created, not the least of which is their hand-made stills, and rightfully so. They use these masterpieces of form and function in the crafting of two different styles of rum: silver and spiced ... and everything nice (come on, you knew it was coming). Stop by and see what happens when you mix art with spirits. Why the 36 in their name? Utah was the 36th state to vote to repeal Prohibition, which was the deciding vote.\nSouthern Comfort 1st Stop: Holystone Distilling The next distillery on our adventure is Holystone Distilling (207 W. 4860 South, Ste. 5, Murray, 385-800-2580, holystonedistilling.com). Former naval aviator/now distillery owner Michael DeShazo and his wife Barbie are bringing beauty to the ultra-premium vodka, absinthe, shochu and gin world. From the label, to the bottle, to the process behind the creation of their spirits, each is forged with reverence and purpose. Most distilleries have some type of theme, and Holystone is no different. What sets them apart is their loving commitment to their nautical theme. Just beyond the velvet curtain you pass through, you'll see a 1,000-pound ship door and then you'll move on into their 1920s cruise liner-inspired tasting room. But don't take my word for it, come by to get a peek behind the velvet curtain and see for yourself.\n2nd Stop: Outlaw Distillery To his dream of owning a distillery, relatively new owner Tyler Halstead , purchased Outlaw Distillery (552 W. 8360 South, Midvale, 801-706-1428, outlawdistillery.com) from Kirk and Denise Sedgwick in October 2020 (although Kirk remains in the picture as master distiller). First opening in January of 2015, Outlaw takes its name from the Outlaw Trail made famous by the likes of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Now in their eighth year, they are still mashing and distilling with many products to choose from. With a name like Outlaw, of course, they offer a whiskey, but they also offer a bourbon, a spiced rum, an aged rum, moonshine and even a coffee rum. Stop by and say hi to the folks who are crafting one-of-a-kind spirits grounded in Utah's history.\n3rd Stop: Vintage Spirits Distillery Vintage Spirits Distillery (6844 S. 300 West, Midvale, 801-699-6459, vsdistillery.com) is the newest distillery in Utah. After two and a half years in the making, Vintage Spirits finally opened their doors on Oct. 8, 2022. This grain-to-glass distillery's first spirits were a silver rum, an aged rum and a dark rum. However, their lineup changed in the second week in January 2023 when they added their CinnaBerry Whiskey and then again in the first week of February 2023 when they added a bourbon that I can't wait to try.\n4th Stop: Eight Settlers Restaurant and Distillery Eight Settlers Restaurant and Distillery (7321 Canyon Centre Pkwy., Cottonwood Heights. 385-900-4315, eightsettlersdistillery.com) is the place for chef-prepared cuisine, an amazing view of the Salt Lake Valley and craft spirits that include Ragtown American Whiskey, Devil's Gate Bourbon, Green Ditch Gin and Butler Vodka. The Eight Settlers' theme pays homage to the early pioneers who settled in the Union area in 1849 around Butler Bench, Poverty Flats and Danish Town.\nEight Settlers Restaurant and Distillery opened in 2020 during the height of COVID restrictions, one of the more difficult periods in our country's history. Battling against restrictions brought on by a global pandemic, Radu and Katia Dugala's sheer grit and determination were reminiscent of the settlers they're recognizing in their theme.\nOut-of-Town Distilleries Park City Alpine Distilling (Distillery: 7132 Silver Creek Road; Alpine Distillery Bar: 364 Main St.; 435-200-9537, alpinedistilling.com) Proverbial Spirits (4175 Forestdale Drive, Ste.102, Park City. 435-250-4477, proverbialspirits.com) High West Distillery (High West Saloon: 703 Park Ave., Park City; and High West Distillery: 27649 Old Lincoln Highway, Wanship. 435-649-8300; highwest.com)\nOgden area The Hive Brandy Co.

To that end, he operates a website, has created a guide, posts on social media platforms and books package-based Sprinter Van tours to the distilleries.

Here are eight shops where they can see you coming. By Kass Wood\nMerry meet, fellow Witches, Wizards and muggles alike. Have you lately noticed the many shops popping up that cater to New Age, Wiccan, Pagan, Magic and other interests? It wasn't all that long ago, Salt Lake had only a handful of such businesses; the Golden Braid, with its metaphysical books, tapes and incense, was the city's heavy hitter (full disclosure: I managed for the Golden Braid for five years in the late '80s).

When shops like these can thrive, it hints that there's more spiritual diversity in our communities than we imagine. Each one of the following eight stores is truly worth a visit, if only for a sense of well-being and stress relief. Go, then, on your soulful journey. May these shops cast a most pleasing spell upon thee.\nTuriya's Fairies and mermaids and stones! Oh my! Turiya's enchantment draws you in before you even open the door.

She's a distinguished professor at the University of Utah, where she created and edits West: A Translation. During her time as Utah's poet laureate, one of Rekdal's biggest projects was a digital deep-dive love letter to the state, Mapping Literary Utah, a web archive of Utah writers.\n\"There's this underlying and very snobbish assumption that culture does not exist in the West, and it certainly won't exist in a place like Utah because of our reputation of being a red state,\" says poet Paisley Rekdal. \"I've been here for 20 years; I'm not a Utah native, but it's become a state that's near and dear to my heart.\"\nShe talked to us about her mapping project, her new book, and what's going on in the writing community.\nCan you talk about Mapping Literary Utah? Paisley Rekdal: I remember when I was a very young writer—I was in high school, and I wanted to be a poet, and I was living in Seattle, which at the time was not considered a very cool place to be from. And things have really changed. My dad, for a birthday gift, gave me this wonderful anthology of poetry—all the American poets from the 20th century. The first thing I did was read the biographies, because I wanted to find out how many poets came from Seattle. And there was precisely one. Everyone else had come from New York and the East Coast, and had gone to very fancy private schools, and had what looked like very fancy lives. I remember feeling this very strong sinking feeling that Seattle wasn't on any kind of map. And that always haunted me.\nMoving here to Utah, when I go and do readings anywhere around the states, especially on the East Coast, a lot of people say to me, \"How can you possibly live in Utah?\" That was really frustrating for me, to think that there were students that were probably growing up in Utah who might want to be writers, who are getting the message from outside and maybe even inside the state accidentally or deliberately, that they are not part of a culture industry, they are not part of a conversation in literary history. I wanted to make sure that the people knew that. Actually, right around them, there were lots and lots of poets, fiction writers and playwrights, and they've always been here. I wanted to go back in time as well, and archive some of the voices and names of people that I didn't know. For example, Zitkála-Šá, who was a writer and an activist for American Indian rights here and for women's suffrage. She was somebody who was incredibly prolific. I think she was actually a genius. She was a violinist. She was the first Native American to write a libretto for a major opera. She did everything, and she spent a lot of years of her life in Utah.\nWhat do you currently see going on in Utah's writing community? PR: I think there's an assumption, based on some of the bestselling authors coming out of Utah, that it has a literature that is primarily defined by its relationship to environment, place and also ethnicity. A lot of writers are speaking about an LDS culture, or coming out of an LDS culture, and that's definitely a very large section of Utah's literary history. But what really struck me as I was doing the research and trying to get more writers onto the site was that, in fact, we are kind of weirdly siloed from each other. Novelists, and the children's lit people, have a very thriving, very national public presence, and they may not actually be seen as somebody who's coming from Utah, or you get someone like Brandon Sanderson, who's writing science fiction and fantasy. They don't get associated with place because they're associated with genre.\nOne of the things that always amuses me about the West, and how the West is perceived, is that lots of people imagine that all the poetry that's being written here tends toward ecopoetics, right? But we actually have a very large and thriving avant-garde poetry scene, spoken word and sound poetry scene. ...I wanted to highlight that, and make sure that the more experimental poets were definitely on the site as well.\nTell us about some of the projects you worked on during your time as poet laureate. I did [a project] called West, which is all about a transcontinental railroad. When you're a poet laureate, you get commissioned pieces sometimes. One of mine was to write a poem that would commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Transcontinental Railroad. I'm half-Chinese, and I was more than happy to write about the Transcontinental Railroad. I really wanted to tell that history, that very complex, layered history, through the lens of Chinese workers' voices and a particular poem that had been carved on the walls of Angel Island Immigration Station [in San Francisco] during the Chinese Exclusion Act. I wanted to link Chinese exclusion with the building of the Transcontinental, and then make it a multi-vocal piece that was also accessible on a website. So, anyone can go right now to the website at westtrain.org and play on the website and make their own translation.\nPaisley Rekdal reads from West on April 26 at the Utah Museum of Fine Arts (410 Campus Center Drive, Salt Lake City). The book will be released by Copper Canyon Press on May 2.\nCorrection: In the print edition, the immigration station where a poem had been carved into the wall (that helped inspire Rekdal's project West) was incorrectly transcribed as Ellis Island. It should have been Angel Island Immigration Station. We've updated the interview above with the correction.",
