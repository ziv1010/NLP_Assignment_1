  "body_text": "The letter O reportedly first appeared 1000 years before Jesus Christ, then the Greeks adopted it, from where it entered the Roman alphabet and, eventually, found itself in this sentence. Seven times.\nThe rotund vowel's persistence is not in doubt but it has posed a unique problem this week for the people at Wellington Airport.\nWith the FIFA Women's World Cup starting in New Zealand next month the airport planned to replace the O in the \"blown away\" sign by the Miramar cutting with a large football.\nThe plan was for work to start on removing the O at 11.15am on Monday with people posing for photos in front of it at 4pm.\nBut, shortly after 3pm the airport sent out an update: 'Unfortunately, removing the existing 'O' is taken a bit longer than expected so the football won't be in place tonight'.\nIt was the Guardian which delved into the history of the letter and traced it from pre-biblical times to now.\n\"To lexicographers it's just the 15th letter of the English alphabet,\" it reported.\n\"To designers it's a perfect shape for treatment: Aworld, a ball, a ring, a sun, a moon, a clock, a compass, a face. It's not even just a letter; it's a number, too - if zero counts as a number. It's a solid sphere or an empty circle.\"\nThe change from the O to a football will be kicked to Tuesday.\nOh dear.",
