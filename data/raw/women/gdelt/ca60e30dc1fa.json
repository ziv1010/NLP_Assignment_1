It’s nothing to do with our positioning, it’s more to do with – I hate to say it – but it’s more to do with gender because there’s no other reason for it.\n“I can’t see any other reason other than that, unfortunately.”\nNikki Lucas, whose daughter Lily captains Thornaby’s successful under 15s team, said they had just won a tournament when they heard.\nShe said: “We were all absolutely devastated, shocked and really deflated.\n“The girls had spent the whole day at a tournament in Chester-le-Street where they absolutely smashed it, lifted a trophy and then came home to this news.”\nMrs Lucas, who lives in Middlesbrough, added: “We were all sat watching Soccer Aid, women and men playing together at Chelsea’s ground, and yet there’s clubs making decisions like this.\n“It’s crazy that they have done this to them.”\nMrs Lucas said parents held fundraising events for the girls’ teams through the season to cover the cost of entering tournaments, and their subs paid for kits and training gear.\nYoung players would be heartened by the support that the girls’ and women’s teams have received since the news broke, she said.\n“It has been unbelievable, it has been quite emotional this morning, we knew people wouldn’t be happy, but we never imagined anything on this scale,” she said.\n“The girls have seen the offers of help and it has boosted them up.\n“It shows how much the women’s game has progressed.”\nThe under 15s finished runners up in their league, won two cups and have been invited to represent the Teesside area in a national tournament this summer.",
