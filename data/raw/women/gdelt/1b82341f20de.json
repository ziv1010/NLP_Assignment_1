Alexandra Popp and Svenja Huth remain key figures, injuries combined with a lack of depth in certain positions, have hampered the team’s ability to stay competitive on all fronts.\nBayern Munich now the dominant team in the Bundesliga\nUntil 2022, Wolfsburg were the most feared team in the Bundesliga but in the past two seasons have fallen short in the league to an impressive Bayern Munich side.\nMunich have strengthened their squad and refined their tactical approach under head coach Alexander Straus to make them the dominant figure the league.\nOberdorf's decision to move from Wolfsburg to Bayern, which was announced in the February 2024, gave a clear insight of belief from one of Germany's most exciting young talents as to which team offered the biggest chance of future success.\n\"I really liked the club’s vision of what they want to achieve in the next few years. I was also shown where my potential lies and what else can be got out of me,\" Oberdorf said at the time. \"I don't think I'm a complete player yet, but I want to get there.\"\nIn contrast, Wolfsburg’s inconsistency has become more regular this season, having failed to ground out results against mid- to lower-tier teams, including suffering losses to Bayer Leverkusen, Hoffenheim and a 3-3 draw against Werder Bremen.\nWith Eintracht Frankfurt growing alongside Bayern, Wolfsburg have slipped further behind in the league.\nUnless the club see an influx of investment that enable them to make smart transfers, learn to adapt their tactics and return to consistency they showcased in their most successful years, they risk being left behind in the rapidly advancing landscape of European women’s football.\nEdited by: Zac Crellin",
