  "body_text": "Good Tuesday morning. This is Eleni Courea.\nDRIVING THE DAY\nRISHUFFLE ALERT: Rishi Sunak was meant to be chairing a meeting of his Cabinet ministers at 9.30 a.m., but it looks like he’ll be hiring and firing a few of them first.\nWhile you were having dinner: The Sun’s Harry Cole and the Times’ Steve Swinford broke the news that Sunak plans to reorganize his top team and restructure multiple Whitehall departments today (more on that second part below).\nTo make the time: This morning’s Cabinet meeting has been pushed back by an hour to 10.30 a.m., Swinford first reported and the BBC’s Chris Mason and David Wallace Lockhart also hear. This suggests key appointments could be done and dusted by then so that everyone can scramble to their seats around the table (if, of course, things go to plan).\nRe-shhhh-uffle: By all accounts, these plans have been kept within a very tight circle of people, and Playbook expects tomorrow’s papers will be full of detail about how government figures were blindsided by the news. Well-placed officials laughed off the prospect of a reshuffle yesterday, while the departments most affected — trade, BEIS and DCMS — have too seemingly been kept in the dark.\n**A message from Intuit: Small business owners in 2023 are facing a changing market landscape that will influence their operations and ability to scale. Intuit knows it's important that small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and accountant voices are represented in policy conversations. Learn more about what they have to say.**\nThat said: At least one department, however, seems to have had VIP treatment. A Home Office insider told Playbook last night that No. 10 indicated the department wouldn’t be touched today (suggesting that Suella Braverman as well as more junior ministers such as Robert Jenrick are staying put). With Jeremy Hunt surely safe, it could mean that moves are limited below the great offices of state.\nAlso safe? Swinford reports that Dominic Raab is staying put, pending the outcome of the bullying probe (said, as ever, to be “weeks away”). There will be some head-scratching over the timing of this reshuffle if Sunak ends up having to hold another one in the act of replacing Raab a few weeks later.\nWho’s up: The BBC and the Times tip Trade Minister Greg Hands for Tory chairman (with the BBC told that, contrary to reports, it won’t be Grant Shapps). Caroline Nokes backed Hands for the job on TalkTV last night. Appointing him would leave a vacancy for a trade minister.\nWho’s down: There have been rumors recently that Steve Barclay’s job is at risk amid the NHS crisis and fruitless talks (or the absence of them) with striking nurses and ambulance workers — though, of course, he could argue it’s No. 10 and the Treasury that have been blocking progress over pay.\nThe grumbling begins: An unspecified source told the Sun that all this excitement “leaves senior ministers looking over their shoulder” and that “these changes will put a lot of noses out of joint — there will be winners and losers all over the place with some very upset egos.” The same person said: “What happens to Grant Shapps at business and where does Kemi fit into all this?”\nWhere do they indeed? Both Shapps and Kemi Badenoch are in line for new jobs under the eye-catching plans for a Whitehall reorganization, which the BBC has been told will affect both BEIS and DIT.\nWHITEHALL SHAKE-UP: According to the detail in the Sun story (if Playbook understands it correctly), BEIS could be carved up into three parts. In one, business would be merged with the department for international trade. There would be a standalone energy department (Ed Miliband will be delighted), fulfilling a pledge made during Sunak’s leadership campaign. And the third part of BEIS would be taken into a department for science and digital (with digital taken out of DCMS). That leaves culture and sport as a standalone department. Its current secretary of state, Michelle Donelan, is going on a short period of maternity leave later this year.\nWhat it’s BEISed on: No. 10 officials discussed splitting BEIS up with ministers in recent days, Bloomberg reports. Sunak has been unimpressed by the department’s work over the years (having clashed repeatedly with it while in the Treasury) and he thinks its focus on energy leaves little space for pro-business policies, one person tells them. Alex Wickham hears that Sunak wants to be the PM who advances the U.K. in science and tech.\nThis is what living in California does to you: Two people tell the FT that by creating a new science ministry, the PM wants to turn the U.K. into a new “Silicon Valley.”\nBack to the future: A Department of Trade and Industry existed between 1970 and 1997 and a Department of Energy and Climate Change between 2008 and 2016, so none of what’s been mooted is massively radical. POLITICO’s trade team spoke to a few people recently who said merging business with trade was a good idea but would use up a lot of political capital.\nSpeaking of which: A senior Labour figure told Playbook that “such a big machinery of government change this close to an election is just daft. It takes loads of energy in Whitehall to get this stuff sorted and they basically won’t have time to do anything real before an election … but if they haven’t got any money, ideas or enough votes to actually do any work — then why not.” It’s one view.\nStill, everyone loves a reshuffle: Except the SpAd who, told by Playbook that there’s some excitement at last, replied: “I was enjoying a period of f*cking boring.”\nUNHAPPY HOME\nSCOOP — OVERHEARD IN THE COFFEE QUEUE: Playbook readers will know the U.K.’s membership of the European Convention on Human Rights is a contentious issue among Tories and potentially a major dividing line at the next election.\nIn that vein … Three Red Wall Tory MPs were overheard very loudly discussing the matter and plotting a rebellion in the Portcullis House atrium yesterday. According to notes on the conversation passed to Playbook by a mole, the MPs complained that while Braverman wants to pull the U.K. out of the ECHR, Sunak doesn’t.\nForcing their hand: The MPs mused about how they would organize a rebel amendment to the new asylum bill, estimating they could get 80 Tory MPs to back ECHR withdrawal including whips and ministerial aides, and speculating that the government wouldn’t be able to sack everyone “if 15 PPSes sign it.”\nAs it happens: The MPs mentioned they were having a meeting with Braverman today.\nHere’s something they can talk about: Floating the prospect of quitting the ECHR is all just a ploy by No. 10 to sweeten the Tory right and get a Northern Ireland Protocol deal over the line, the Times’ Matt Dathan hears. Which kind of blows up that cunning plan. A senior MP tells Dathan they have been reassured by Downing Street that Sunak really has no intention of pulling the U.K. out of the ECHR. Separately, a minister tells him that it’s an attempt to “handle Suella.”\nGHOSTS OF PRIME MINISTERS PAST\nA KLUTZ? A SHOWER? A BACKSEAT? No decision at Playbook HQ yet on the collective noun for former Tory PMs. But given that neither Boris Johnson nor Liz Truss is going to be ducking from the limelight anytime soon, it’s very much a live question.\nON PLANET BORIS: If the reshuffle gets boring, tune in at 10 a.m. for BBC chairman Richard Sharp’s hearing before the DCMS committee, which hauled him in following reports he helped Johnson secure a £800,000 loan. The committee’s chairman Damian Green told Playbook last night: “We will want to establish whether we were right to approve his appointment, and whether anything we should have known was kept from us.”\nON PLANET TRUSS: Easy — and fun — though it is to laugh at Truss, POLITICO’s Esther Webber has a piece unpicking why her refusal to lie low is a worry for Sunak. Her policy agenda still has a hold on some Tory MPs (cf. the Conservative Growth Group). And for his part, Johnson maintains that star quality and ballot box appeal (at least according to his fans) which some Tories fear Sunak lacks. It’s been posited before that British prime ministers swing back and forth between “jocks” and “nerds” — and nothing is more likely to underline Sunak’s nerdiness than a pair of recently deposed jocks refusing to shut up.\nTrouble ahead: Unluckily for Sunak, there are at least three big-ticket items coming up that will provide ample ground for the terrible two to cause trouble. One is the budget. Truss and Johnson are unlikely to get personally involved but it will be closely watched by Truss loyalists. Before that, she is expected to give a speech on Taiwan on February 17, which could turn up the heat on Sunak over his approach to relations with China. Then there is the small matter of the Northern Ireland protocol. A Whitehall official said Johnson “absolutely” had the power to detonate that process and that “he should never be underestimated as an agent of chaos.”\nPMs assemble: One option for Sunak is to attempt to assemble the former prime ministers and ask them to stand behind him on a matter of such huge national and international significance. As things stand, such a get-together is difficult to picture. As politics professor Tim Bale puts it to Esther, Truss and Johnson seem fated to go on “not caring how much trouble they cause Sunak, because in their view, he should never have taken over from them in the first place.”\nSHORT SHRIFT: In his Times column, William Hague is scathing of the way both Truss and Johnson have conducted themselves since resigning. He concludes: “If you became prime minister, with a majority behind you and a decent term in front of you, but were overthrown amid chaos, there is indeed someone to blame. It’s you.”\nPSA: Spectator editor Fraser Nelson appears to have been given an explanation of Truss’ eye-catching office artwork. Her portrait of Che Guevara dressed in Horatio Nelson’s uniform (“an imaginary British revolutionary”) is there “to inspire her in her next political project — running another assault against the establishment,” he writes in his Telegraph column.\nWhat Playbook is reading: FT Alphaville’s merciless annotated version of Truss’ magnum opus, by Louis Ashworth.\n**On February 21, Secretary of State for Business and Trade Kemi Badenoch and United States Ambassador to the U.K. Jane Hartley will headline a celebration of POLITICO’s expansion in the U.K. Register today to follow the discussion online.**\nBROKEN BRITAIN\nNURSING NO HOPES: Nurses in England are staging their second 12-hour strike of the week from 7.30 a.m. today. The FT has a good recap of the dispute: there’s still no sign of resolution, with ministers digging in over refusing to reopen the 2022-23 pay settlements despite some signs to the contrary last month.\nRAIL REVAMP: Mark Harper will deliver the annual Rail Partners George Bradshaw Address at around 7 p.m. tonight, where he’ll be setting out the government’s plans to reform the U.K.’s creaking railway system.\nLight at the end of the tunnel? No further RMT or Aslef strikes have been announced yet. For weeks, talks between rail chiefs and RMT reps are meant to have been approaching a deal but none has been announced. As for Aslef (which brought most trains to a halt on two dates last week), Playbook hears that reps are meeting employers today.\nMore bad news for HS2 fans: The Financial Times’ Jim Pickard reports that delays to building HS2 could last up to four years, taking its completion to 2045, 12 years than originally planned. He hears that officials have been tasked with finding potential savings on the first phase under the snazzily-named “Project Silverlight,” and cost-cutting across the entire project over five years under “Project Blue Diamond.”\nDEFENSELESS: The Mail splashes on calls from Tory MPs and senior military figures for Sunak to boost spending on the army in the budget. The paper reports that Defense Secretary Ben Wallace is holding “crisis meetings” with Treasury officials this week to try to secure a bigger settlement for the military, with a government source insisting one hasn’t been ruled out.\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\nLABOUR LAND: Keir Starmer chairs a meeting of his shadow Cabinet as usual. Sunak’s reshuffle might give the Labour leader the excuse to carry out his own long-rumored one soon, given there will be arguments that the shadow Cabinet should mirror the structure of government. The FT says Starmer is considering a reshuffle in “the coming weeks.”\nOn economic inactivity: Shadow DWP sec Jonathan Ashworth sets out Labour’s plan to get people with mental health and addiction problems into work in an interview with the Guardian’s Jess Elgot. Ashworth tells her thousands of people have been “written off” by the Department for Work and Pensions, and that they should be given employment support from the start alongside treatment.\nOn defense: John Healy is speaking at RUSI today on Labour’s defense policy after the invasion of Ukraine. The Telegraph’s Danielle Sheridan has a write-up of what he plans to say.\nSO MUCH FOR RESTRICTING SPENDING: The government has quietly scrapped the limits introduced by David Cameron on how much departments can spend on external advice from external consultants, the Guardian’s Jess Elgot also reports. It comes after the FT revealed last month that the government’s in-house consultancy arm was being scrapped.\nBACK TO ZERO ON ZERO-HOURS CONTRACTS: The Mirror’s John Stevens points out that the government still hasn’t banned zero-hours contracts despite promising to in the 2019 Tory manifesto. A Tory source blames Tony Blair, telling him that “this Government supported workers through the economic crises Labour created while in office, and then through the Covid pandemic, spending billions on the furlough scheme. We have also cracked down on the abuse of zero hours contracts while they didn’t act for 13 years, and boosted the National Living Wage to record levels.”\nPROTOCOL MATTERS: An agreement on one of the last remaining sticking points in negotiations over the Northern Ireland protocol, over food and animal health checks, is “close to being done,” the Guardian reports.\n**We’ve sent out the first London Playbook PM, POLITICO’s latest U.K. politics newsletter.

Starmer’s office committed a week ago in the Sunday Times to publishing the tax returns of a Labour PM, deputy leader and chancellor. In fact, Starmer plans to publish his before the next election, though he is waiting for Sunak to do so first.\nUp in Scotland: No such waiting around from Starmer’s Scottish counterpart Anas Sarwar, who Playbook’s Andrew McDonald is told plans to publish his tax return today. The Scottish Labour leader has no other income aside from his salary as an MSP. The same is true of both First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross, whose published returns yesterday showed no extra income aside from what they earned as elected officials. Ross made no money in his side gig as a football linesman due to an injury that kept him out of action during the last financial year.\nOn the other hand: The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton’s tax return — which was sent to journos on request — shows that he supplemented his MSP income with £2,820 in property income last year. Dedicated fans of Scottish political trivia will remember that Cole-Hamilton rents out a shed in his garden as an Airbnb (£49 a night, 4.73 star rating as of 2021), though that space is currently being used by a Ukrainian refugee.\nTop tax tip: If you’re publishing your tax returns online, don’t be like the SNP HQ officials, who forgot to redact Sturgeon’s bank details.\nMURKIER WATERS: Despite happily publishing her tax return moments earlier, Sturgeon was less forthcoming as she was pressed by Scottish journalists on the £107,620 loan her husband — and SNP HQ supremo — Peter Murrell gave to the SNP back in June 2021. Under questioning from the Herald’s Tom Gordon, the first minister said she “can’t recall” when she first learned Murrell had lent the money and asserted that “what he does with his resources is a matter [for him].” Here’s the Herald’s write-up.\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\nHOUSE OF COMMONS: Sits from 11.30 a.m. with Treasury questions, followed by any UQs or statements … Labour’s Chris Bryant has a 10-minute rule bill that would give the government power to seize assets owned by Russian oligarchs … and then the main business will see MPs move through the remaining stages of the Seafarer’s Wages Bill and scrutinize Lords’ amendments to the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill. Tory MP Conor Burns has the adjournment debate and will discuss asylum seekers in his Bournemouth constituency.\nOn committee corridor: Big bank bosses will discuss all things banking at the Treasury committee (9.45 a.m.) … BBC Chairman Richard Sharp faces a DCMS committee grilling (10 a.m.) … Sunak’s school maths masterplan will be scrutinized by experts and union officials at the education committee (10 a.m.) … Care Minister Helen Whately will give evidence at the health committee on integrated care systems (10 a.m.) … and former PM John Major will give his insights into the Northern Irish peace process at the NI affairs committee (11 a.m.). Full list here.\nWONK WATCH: The Sunak government should prioritize tackling antisocial behavior and bringing back bustling high streets if it wants to level up left-behind communities, according to a new report by Onward. The Times has a write-up. The think tank conducted focus groups and interviews in five different areas of England, finding that those two “common challenges” were persistently brought up — along with supporting local culture, boosting local growth in the private sector and providing community support to the most disadvantaged … While the Key Cities national network representing U.K. cities has published a report calling for a more inclusive approach to stimulating the economy, highlighting the link between low cultural engagement and deprivation.\nLORDS: Sits from 2.30 p.m. with questions on whether nurses are using food banks, the consultation on the Bread and Flour Regulations 1998 and on the profits announced by Shell last week … and then the main business will be the second day of the Public Order Bill’s report stage.\nBEYOND THE UK\nEARTHQUAKE UPDATE: At least 3,500 people in Turkey and Syria have died as a result of the earthquake that struck in the early hours yesterday, with the World Health Organization warning that toll could multiply by eight as rescuers find more victims. Those rescuers are currently battling heavy rain and snow as they try to find survivors. The BBC has more here, while Development Minister Andrew Mitchell has the morning broadcast round in the U.K.\nTODAY IN THE STATES: U.S. President Joe Biden will try to paint a contrast between his steady leadership and the divided Republicans, as he makes his annual State of the Union speech this evening. POLITICO’s U.S. team have all you need to know here, while Jon Lemire has a big preview here.\nKNOWING ME, KNOWING EU: Volodymyr Zelenskyy is mulling a trip to Brussels later this week, several people briefed on the discussions tell POLITICO’s Suzanne Lynch. Tentative preparations are underway to host the Ukrainian president in the European Parliament and for a lunch with EU leaders at a European Council summit. The trip would mark only Zelenskyy’s second excursion abroad since the Russian invasion.\n**A message from Intuit: We asked Ali Jaw, FMAAT FCCA at Severn Accounting in West Midlands: What resources would help UK business owners succeed the most?
