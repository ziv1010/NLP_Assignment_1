First of all to France Football and to UEFA for giving me this award. I would like to thank those who voted for me and put their trust in me. Today is a very special day for me and for my family, my country.\n“I would like to thank the most important person in the world for me, my girlfriend Laura. Today is our anniversary and without her things wouldn’t have been the same. Thank you.\n“Also my family, of course. The values they have taught me and all they represent in me, for having taught me the right steps to take and for helping be become the man I am…\n“I don’t want to forget my team-mates, I understand it is a group game. Manchester City is so special, I know I wouldn’t make this without you. For me it is the best club in the world, and thanks to them things happen much easier.\n“The national team and Luis (de la Fuente, coach), for trusting me for so long, I have to mention my team-mates with whom we won the Euros. This is not just for me but for Spanish football.”\nBonmati won the women’s award for a second year running as Barcelona, who lifted the Champions League trophy for a third time in four years, completed a clean sweep of the top three places, rounded out by Caroline Graham Hansen and Salma Paralluelo.",
