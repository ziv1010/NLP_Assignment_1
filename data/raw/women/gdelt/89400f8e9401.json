Hard work pays off; it’s been a fantastic year for me, both individually and as a team,” the 28-year-old said after receiving the award. “I’d also like to thank my family and everyone at Paris Saint-Germain. I hope to be back here again next year.”\nBonmati, a World Cup winner with Spain, continued her dominance in women’s football by winning her third consecutive FIFA Best award, following her third straight Ballon d’Or triumph.\nCurrently sidelined with injury, she expressed her gratitude in a social media post.\n“Nothing makes me prouder than being recognised by players, coaches and fans for the third time in a row,” she wrote on Instagram. “Thank you to FIFA for this award, and to my teams and everyone who supports me along the way.”\nWith their exceptional performances and consistency at the highest level, Dembele and Bonmati once again underlined their status as the standout players in world football.",
