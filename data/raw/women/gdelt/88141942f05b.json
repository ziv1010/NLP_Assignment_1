Whereas the men’s market continues to register unprecedented levels of activity, the women’s game shows no signs of slowing down its rapid growth, underlining its increasing professionalisation and appeal to clubs and players worldwide.\nIn men’s professional football, almost 12,000 international transfers were concluded during the 2025 mid-year window, a new record. Some of those were free transfers, like Valentin Rosier to Osasuna, whilst others involved a transfer fee.\nAll things considered, spending on transfer fees rose to $9.76 billion, the largest mid-year figure ever recorded and an increase of more than 50% compared to the same period in 2024. England accounted for a third of that spending with over $3 billion in transfer expenditures, the highest amount ever spent by a single association. England, Portugal, and Brazil saw the most incoming transfers on the male side.\nAs far as women’s professional football goes, we saw a record of more than 1,100 transfers completed. Spending on transfer fees reached $12.3 million, an increase of more than 80% compared to mid-year 2024, with the USA accounting for a third of this expenditure with just over $4 million invested, the highest-ever amount reported in the women’s game. Germany, England and the USA led national associations in terms of the most incoming transfers.\n“We have observed a transfer market in full swing both in men's and women's football”, said Emilio Garcia Silvero, FIFA’s Chief Legal & Compliance Officer.\n“While this is a relevant development in men's football a year ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026, the increasing figures in women's football transfers are equally remarkable as they confirm the exponential growth of the women's game at club level.”\nLatest Stories\n-\n‘Behind The Lens with Queen Liz’ explores the true meaning of Valentine’s Day, Love, Lust or Legacy?\n34 minutes -\n‘I wanted to be an architect but ended up as a nurse’ – Diana Hamilton reveals\n1 hour -\nFrom wards to worship: Diana Hamilton reveals how nursing school shaped her destiny\n2 hours -\nMahama demands binding deadlines for African reparations\n2 hours -\nThis is not the time to settle political scores – Bawumia to government\n3 hours -\n5 definitive Valentine’s Day gifts to win your lover’s heart in Ghana\n4 hours -\n37% of SHS students exposed to drugs – Opare-Addo\n4 hours -\nNLC secures court injunction against striking tertiary unions\n5 hours -\nOSP says it remains guided by law after INTERPOL deletes Ofori-Atta’s Red Notice\n5 hours -\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n5 hours -\nRed Notice cancellation: OSP official fires back at Ofori-Atta’s lawyers\n5 hours -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n6 hours -\nAAG raises alarm over billboard demolitions, calls for presidential intervention\n6 hours -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n6 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n7 hours",
