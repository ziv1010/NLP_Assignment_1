  "body_text": "In a letter about Edinburgh’s badly-run airport (January 9), I noted that the Government “seems to have washed its hands of Britain’s airports, while foisting its own rapacious costs on passengers in the form of Air Passenger Duty”.\nThis must change. The shambles at Heathrow following a substation fire sadly underlines the point. Whatever details may yet emerge, it is clear that contingency planning at the country’s most important airport is totally unfit for purpose. That requires immediate review and redress, for all key elements of national critical infrastructure.\nThe episode also illustrates the folly of building another runway at Heathrow. If air traffic was better spread across the kingdom and the flag carrier was not so focused on London as its sole hub, the impact of temporarily closing Heathrow while still substantial would have been reduced.\nChristopher Ruane, Lanark.\n• The fire which has knocked out Heathrow Airport shows the folly of putting all our transport eggs in one basket. The UK is grossly lopsided toward the south of England and building yet more infrastructure there can only make things worse.\nHeathrow being down has also led to global disruption of transport, and another runway will only make transport more vulnerable. Spread the load around the UK: Prestwick could be the UK’s main cargo hub for example, something George Younger tried to get a Tory cabinet to agree too, but parochial interests prevailed.\nGR Weir, Ochiltree.\nHigh tech relies on low tech\nIn case reality is still by-passing those in power as they try to sound knowledgeable about where future technology is taking us and in particular AI, would they please take a long hard look at the situation in Heathrow and the cause, a fire in a substation?\nThat is if they are still in denial after all the problems of the last few years over bank IT failures locking folk out of their accounts and the Australian fiasco where disabled people reliant on futuristic tech were trapped in their homes and much more.\nPersonally, I don’t give two figs about Heathrow because most of those folk should not be flying in a world where the environment is increasingly wrecked. Also, I accept it may be hard to take seriously on this point someone who even rejects lower tech and has never had a smartphone, refuses to use self-service checkouts, doesn’t own a car, microwave, TV, or dishwasher.\nBut high tech still relies very much on low tech and no matter how many humans you replace with automation, if basic infrastructure isn't reliable (which it isn't and has not been in the UK since Thatcher, when private profit took over from the idea of the public good) we’d better brush up our semaphore and get a horse and cart each.\nAmanda Baker, Edinburgh.\nRead more letters\n- They bent over backwards for Ferguson Marine before. Why not now?\n- Did the SNP really know what it was doing with Ferguson Marine?\n- Scottish Golf way off course with move to let men self-ID as women\nShameful silence on welfare cuts\nUnbelievably the proposed welfare cuts by the UK Labour Government did not warrant a mention at First Minister’s Questions (FMQs) on Thursday from the leaders of the main opposition parties. Instead it was the SNP's Christine Graham who raised the issue, asking the First Minister what impact the proposed welfare reforms will have on pensioners in Scotland.\nShe highlighted that under the Labour Government Scottish pensioners have lost their winter fuel allowance, the Waspi women’s claim for justice has been shelved and now Labour’s attack on benefits will follow.\nUK Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall's statement on welfare reform – which is nothing less than austerity – has sent shivers through the disabled and pensioner population, not to mention those struggling to find employment.\nSome joined-up thinking from Labour regarding getting those claiming benefits into employment would have gone down well. Regarding the employers Ms Kendall is relaying on in her statement, they have just had a detrimental increase to their National Insurance contributions, putting jobs at risk, hammering the very source needed for the proposed welfare reforms.\nIt was interesting that neither Russell Findlay nor Anas Sarwar mentioned welfare cuts at FMQs; was that because secretly the Conservatives applaud the reforms and Labour is embarrassed? We all remember the words of Anas Sarwar: \"There will be no austerity under a Labour government.\"\nCatriona C Clark, Falkirk.\nTough time for Swinney\nJohn Swinney was like a rabbit in the headlights at First Minister's Questions. What could he do? Russell Findlay pinned him down on the award of the ferry contract to Poland. Mr Swinney was directly involved in the Glens Sannox and Rosa contracts which are still opaque to this day so he needed to be open about the new contract. Scotland was overlooked for the award hence Mr Swinney's discomfort. Add in Anas Sarwar's second wave on the same topic and Mr Swinney was well and truly sunk.\nMr Swinney has no convincing argument for pumping yet more taxpayers' money into Ferguson Marine and yet not allowing it this lifeline. Does the SNP know what it is doing?\nDr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.\nWelcome relief\nCleared of any wrongdoing, Nicola Sturgeon said that \"there was never a scrap of evidence\" (\"‘I’m in the clear now... and that comes as a big relief’\", The Herald, March 21). The relief that she can now get on with her life without the shadow of Branchform hanging over her must be profound for both Ms Sturgeon and the former SNP treasurer Colin Beattie, whose ordeal is also at an end.\nBut why did this investigation drag on for so long, and why did the police think it was desirable or necessary to pitch the big blue tent in her garden, which many police officers believe would have been more appropriate to a murder investigation? These are questions which need to be answered. However, the stress and strain of Branchform is now thankfully over for Ms Sturgeon; all of us who hold her in affection, admiration and respect knew all along that \"there was never a scrap of evidence\".\nRuth Marr, Stirling.\nParty games\nStan Grodynski (Letters, March 21) is now promoting the idea of a new socialist party which would of course split the Labour vote to the benefit of, guess who? Maybe Mr Gordynski could address the shortcomings in the SNP and form SNFAP, or Scottish National Fiscal Awareness Party.\nThis party could present some clear detailed plan on post-independence such as what currency will we have, who will underwrite our debt, how will our UK pensions be paid, what are the plans for education, housing, defence, rebuilding our dilapidated schools and of course the collapse of our city centres.\nJohn Gilligan, Ayr.\nThe need for conifers\nIt is good to see forestry discussed, but the opinion piece by Professor Ian Wall (\"One-third of a billion spent on tree planting – but is this money well spent?\", The Herald, March 19) needs clarification. Subsidy for plantations of conifers contributes directly to removing carbon from the air and storing it as wood. The need is urgent to reduce climate heating. Conifers do this by growing twice as fast as broad-leaf trees. After felling, these plantations are promptly replanted; now forbidden on peat.\nExtensive forests of conifers, such as Sitka spruce, do the great majority of carbon storage in Britain as they grow, then as many construction products after felling. They spoil the scenery, but as with wind turbines, the need to manage our climate is greater.\nAlan R Walker, Edinburgh.\nReduce number of rugby subs\nThe interview with Matt Fagerson (\"Fagerson sees the positive side of Six Nations campaign\", Herald Sport, March 18) and in particular Martin Hannan's column (\"How grimly predictable – yet another Six Nations full of ‘if onlys’, Herald Sport, March 19) refer to how long professional and international rugby players spend playing, as opposed to warming the bench.\nThe Fagersons are an impressive pair, no doubt they chose their parents well. They have different physiques but both are honed by nutrition, programmed fitness training in the gym plus running and ball work on the park. Somehow, we hear little about that aspect and what sports science tells us about the effect of playing international rugby for 60 minutes or 80 minutes, a full match. Zander Fagerson is considered impressive because he has been playing the full match. Martin Hannan bemoans the Scottish forwards' lack of power and the fact that they were dominated in the loose too often by bigger French forwards.\nI suggest, as others have, that in Scotland's favour and for the health of the game, the number of substitutes is reduced to three or four.\nPlayers would have to train and prepare to play for 80 minutes, perhaps pacing themselves at times during the game and of course, feeling tired legs towards the end.\nThere are two advantages generally. Firstly, we would see the backs enjoying more freedom and space as forwards in the opposition legs tire. That is exciting rugby. Secondly, this would remove the so-called \"bomb squad\", a modern abomination.\nPerhaps a fair bit of my comment as a Scottish supporter is in self-interest but I would be intrigued to hear how sports science addresses these issues.\nPhilip Gaskell (stopped playing aged 50), Drymen.\nFollow Rome on fan checks\nIn the aftermath of the incidents before the League Cup Final in Glasgow in December it was somewhat inevitable that the police would look to use the Section 60 special powers for future higher-profile football matches. The vast majority of fans want a fair and balanced approach to policing and with that the overall safety of fans both inside and outside the grounds and for the community at large. The clubs and the governing bodies also need to step up and help, particularly at the stadiums. Pyrotechnics are dangerous and a menace.\nWhile on holiday recently in Rome we got to see the Roma v Porto match in the Europa League. When ordering normal stand tickets there was a requirement to enter your name for each ticket. Your name was marked on the e-ticket. When we arrived at the ground our tickets were checked to make sure we were at the right end of the ground and against our photographic ID. Then when at the turnstiles the tickets and ID were checked again. When through the turnstiles ID was again checked against tickets and there was a pat-down search before being allowed to head towards the stands.\nEven having this process done three times it worked well and we were able to enter the ground quite quickly, smoothly and safely. When in the stand we were able to obtain a beer in the concourse and throughout the match with vendors delivering to your seat. Even with alcohol served in the stadium the crowd was well managed. There were no pyrotechnics in any areas throughout the match. Over 55,000 attended this game.\nDavid Cranston, Glasgow.\nIn the swing of things\nIt would be my pleasure to advise Tom Law (Letters, March 21) that if an octogenarian man wants to self-identify as a woman, all he has to do is ask for his handicap to be transitioned to a female one and, Bob’s your uncle, he will be a female golfer and eligible to play in Scottish Golf’s ladies’ handicap competitions.\nI doubt he would barred. But it looks like clubs who don’t adopt Scottish Golf’s policy on this matter will have their players barred from competing in Scottish Golf competitions.\nI hope this helps.\nJane Femme, Edinburgh.",
