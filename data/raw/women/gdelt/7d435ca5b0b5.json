  "body_text": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has never hidden his lack of engagement with Manchester United’s women’s team.\nThe chairman of the petrochemical company INEOS, who now has a 29 per cent stake in the club, has repeatedly said the focus has been on the men’s team. After all, as he told The Sunday Times last year, they “make £800million, the women’s team cost £10 million”.\nAdvertisement\nINEOS has made a series of cost-cutting measures, including redundancies, increased ticket prices, removing company credit cards from senior staff and cancelling well-paid ambassadorial deals. Every penny counts and the women’s team is not immune to that.\nWhile the women’s team arrived in Sweden via charter plane for their UEFA Women’s Champions League qualifying matches last week, they did not return home with the same accommodations after their win against Hammarby on Saturday.\nThe Athletic explains what happened…\nHow did United get to Sweden?\nThe women’s squad of 27 players flew to Stockholm on a private charter plane ahead of the semi-final of their Champions League second-round qualifying game against PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday. They won 4-0 and progressed to Saturday’s final against Swedish side Hammarby, which they also won, 1-0. United will now face Norwegian outfit SK Brann in the third qualifying round in September.\nThroughout their trip, the team stayed in the same “high-quality” hotel used by the men’s side for a pre-season friendly in July, according to the club, and trained at the Swedish Football Association’s headquarters.\nHow did the team get home?\nAround half of the squad flew back to Manchester on a club-paid commercial flight, which included a one-hour stopover in Copenhagen. The itinerary was discussed in advance with the player leadership group.\nThe club say there were no direct flights from Stockholm to Manchester with enough seats to accommodate all players and staff. Instead of splitting the group on different flights, the preference was to travel together.\nAround 13 members of the squad chose to pay for their own personal flights to European destinations other than Manchester to make the most of their two days off. Men’s players would pay for their own personal travel in the same circumstances.\nAdvertisement\nOne player opted to pay for their own direct flight back to Manchester. Those who travelled on the club-paid flight returned to Manchester at around 10pm on Sunday.\nWhy didn’t the club charter a plane home as well?\nGood question. The club felt that, given United’s next game, their Women’s Super League opener against Leicester City, is not until Sunday, and the players were given two days off training, there was no need to charter a flight home from a performance perspective.\nThe club maintain it was a pragmatic arrangement while trying to keep their costs sustainable.\nIs it normal for WSL sides in the Champions League to travel by charter?\nWhenever Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City have recently played away in Europe, they have travelled by charter there and back.\nWhat about domestically?\nWSL teams will regularly travel by coach or train, given the relatively short distances in England. Chelsea have, however, on occasions made the 186-mile trip to Manchester via charter flight to best aid players’ recovery, but they are an exception among WSL clubs.\nMen’s teams do not always choose to fly, either. For example, Manchester United men have travelled by train for games in London, as have Arsenal men when making the trip up to Manchester United or Liverpool. Clubs make decisions based on performance, logistical or safety requirements while also weighing up cost and sustainability implications. There are no rules in the Women’s Super League or UEFA competitions, men’s or women’s, stipulating that teams must travel by charter flight.\nUnited’s men’s team would always have flown on a chartered flight when they played in Europe, but Ruben Amorim’s side have not qualified for European competition this season.\nIs it different in the National Women’s Soccer League?\nYes. In the NWSL there are restrictions on the use of charter flights. New rules for the 2025 season stated teams can book charter flights for up to three round trips or six legs per season. If a team is scheduled to play more than 42 NWSL games, it is compulsory to take return charter flights for a midweek NWSL game, and if a team has three games in a week more than twice in a season, or in consecutive weeks, the team must use charter flights for the midweek games.\nAdvertisement\nCharter flights have been a bone of contention in the NWSL, with the league and teams at odds over the policy. It was a key point for the NWSL Players’ Association during negotiations for the most recent collective bargaining agreement, which was signed last year and runs through 2030.\nIn 2024 the Women’s National Basketball Association introduced rules that teams must travel exclusively by charter flights, a standard practice in men’s sports.\nWhat have United said about it?\nA club spokesperson said: “We are confident that we put in place the ideal conditions around the team for success on the pitch, and we are proud of the players for their two excellent victories in Stockholm.\n“For future European games, we will continue to consider travel arrangements on a case-by-case basis depending on the location and schedule. Charter flights will be used when necessary for performance reasons, but we will also continue to seek opportunities to manage costs as we look to develop our women’s team in an economically sustainable way.”\n(Top photo: Michael Campanella/Getty Images)",
