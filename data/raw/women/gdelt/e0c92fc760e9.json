Utah Royals announced the signing of Guatemalan forward Aisha Solórzano, who comes in directly from Club Tijuana of Liga MX Femenil after an impressive run in Mexican soccer. At only 26 years of age, Solórzano has that perfect mix of goals, speed, and playing style bound to bring energy into the league.\nFollow MLS Multiplex on X (Twitter).\nThe immediate impact of Aisha Solórzano\nDuring her final season with Club Tijuana, Solórzano had 16 goals in 16 matches. But if that was not enough, her appearance in the 2024 NWSL x Liga MX Femenil Summer Cup showed off her real skill: she scored four goals in three matches, one decisive hat trick against Seattle Reign, and one super-quick goal against Utah Royals themselves. These performances brought in much attention as she sealed her place among the best forwards in Liga MX then.\nNow, Solórzano brings to Utah Royals exactly what the club has been looking for: a forward with a keen sense for goals and presence in high-stakes games. Her ability to make decisive plays, along with her speed and tenacity, is what the team needs to position itself as one of the league's most competitive sides.\nSolórzano has all the qualities you’d expect from a player who stands out: speed, tactical intelligence, and a mindset that elevates everyone around her.\nKelly Cousins, Utah Royals' sporting director, underlined what shone about Solórzano's game: \"Her goal-scoring ability speaks for itself. Her speed and tenacity were also something that immediately caught our attention.\" Cousins also made a point of underlining the club's commitment to her continued growth, both at club level and with the Guatemalan national team.\nA story that started early\nSince her debut for the senior national team in 2014 at the tender age of 15 years, Solórzano has built a career defined by determination. With 21 appearances and three goals for Guatemala, Aisha is one of the biggest names in the country's soccer history. While the stats may not be dazzling, the context matters: Guatemala remains a nation still developing on the international stage, and Solórzano has been one of the key figures driving the sport's growth there.\nExperience in the 2014 CONCACAF Women's Championship against some of the strongest teams on the continent was just the beginning of the journey that led her to remarkable achievements.\nFrom college to professional stage\nBefore turning professional, Aisha had shone in college soccer in the United States for Southeastern University, making 78 appearances and scoring 40 goals-man figures that sealed her as one of the great prospects in female football. Such collegiate grounding proved quite essential for technical and physical preparation for the rigors that lay ahead in professional soccer.\nAfter her time at Southeastern, Solórzano began her professional career with Rosal Women in Guatemala. It wasn't until she arrived in Mexican soccer-first with Puebla and then on with Tijuana-that the next level was attained. Scoring 14 goals in 29 matches with Puebla, following up a remarkable season with Tijuana, and it was obvious to everyone she had reached a time for the next challenge.\nWhat Solórzano's signing means for Utah Royals and the NWSL\nFor Utah Royals, the signing of Aisha Solórzano is not just about strengthening the attack; it's a statement of ambition-to be able to compete toe-to-toe with the best teams in the NWSL-and bringing in a player of the experience and impact of Solórzano is a step in that direction.\nFor the NWSL, the arrival of Quiñones reinforces a growing exchange between women's leagues in the United States and Mexico. One of Latin America's most competitive leagues, Liga MX Femenil has graduated talent that has not gone unrecognized by the NWSL.",
