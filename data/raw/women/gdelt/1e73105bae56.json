  "body_text": "The new Ethiopian Women’s Soccer League season appears to be business as usual for the double defending champions, Dedebit FC taking full command of the table. Long time Ethio-Electric coach Theodros Desta resigned saying he was to blame for the team being bottom of the table with just three points from six matches.\nThe only club with a hundred percent record Dedebit, thrashed Saint George 4-2 on Monday to take the lead eight points clear of second place Gedeo-Dilla. Last season Women’s Player of the Year Losa Aberra has been getting wiser and deadlier and leads the scoring chart with five goals, there appears to be no one to stop “The Blues” from another successful season. Dedebit has 18 points from six matches.\nAfter a win over surprising Hawassa, Gedeo appears the only side in contention of the group runner up spot with 11 points from three wins, two draws and one defeat.\nBack from two consecutive draws Mekelakya defeated Ethio-Electric 2-1 trying hard to keep close contact with the league leaders. The Army side is said to have a strong squad but lacks consistency.\nWith three wins, one draw and two defeats NegedBank sits fourth in the table with 10 points eight clear of league leaders and historic rivals Dedebit FC.\nWith only a single win in six matches Ethio-Electric and national U-20 Women’s coach Theodros Desta’s resignation is not surprising for the result itself speaks loud. But that Theodros officially admitted and took full accountability for the team’s poor result is a miracle in Ethiopian Football famous as the usual behavior is to blame and pointing fingers at others. “Despite every support from the club, I failed the fans as well the players therefore I have resigned taking full responsibility for the poor result,” Theodros said, a huge lesson for those notorious in the blame games.",
