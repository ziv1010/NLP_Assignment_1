Catherine says there are fewer female players in the UK, and Nikhil thinks efforts could be made to improve diversity.\nHe says he's seen how diverse the sport can be during his visits to India as a padel ambassador.\n\"When I go there, I see courts being used 24 hours a day by everyone,\" he says.\n\"Anyone from any background can play - it's about opening up more courts in ethnic minority areas.\"\nTanaya Lai, who began playing tennis at four years old, says she's used to being \"surrounded by white people\".\nIt's something she's noticed since joining the University of Plymouth's padel team, but doesn't see it as a barrier.\n\"I am happy to be an Asian woman in sport,\" she says.\n\"Asian women need to know that they aren't excluded from these spaces and they can join if they want to.\"\nHowever, the 22-year-old does think that there are other obstacles.\n\"It's viewed as a posh, more upper-class sport because of how expensive courts are,\" she says. \"There need to be more public and cheaper courts.\"\nLike Rosie and Barnaby, Tanaya cannot afford to play padel as regularly as she would like and feels it has hindered her progress.\n\"I only really play league matches because it is expensive to just book a court and play for an hour or two,\" she explains.\n\"Otherwise I'd be able to play more.\"\nAdditional reporting by Lauren Woodhead",
