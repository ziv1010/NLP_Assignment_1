  "body_text": "Liverpool sign Angel City midfielder Miri Taylor\nBy Ali Rampling\nLiverpool have completed the signing of Miri Taylor from Angel City.\nThe midfielder is the Reds' fourth new addition of the January window, following the previous arrivals of Gemma Bonner, Sofie Lundgaard and Fuka Nagano.\nTaylor was drafted into the NWSL by Angel City in 2022, and the move sees her return to her native England after four years in the United States.\n\"It’s a dream come true really,\" Taylor told Liverpool's official club website. \"My mum is a massive Liverpool fan, so just for her it’s amazing to be here and I’m really excited to get started. To come home and play in the Women’s Super League is always something I’ve wanted to do.\n“I really hope for Liverpool I can be someone very dependable and reliable, a good centre midfielder who will break up play, get involved, be physical and counter quickly, be a bit of a leader in the middle, assist and score.\"\nTaylor spent five years in the Chelsea academy before moving to Arsenal for a season in 2017.\nShe left for the United States to play college football for Hofstra University the following year, before being selected by Angel City in the fourth round of the 2022 NWSL draft.\n“When I went to America, I always imagined coming back to the WSL, that was always my dream, to play football in England at the highest level I can.,\" the 22-year-old added.\n\"When the NWSL rolled around I thought I can’t turn that opportunity down and I just wanted to get game experience and first-team experience. I’m just really excited to have had interest from Liverpool in the first place and when it was Liverpool it was just tunnel vision.”\nTaylor will wear the number 35 shirt for Liverpool and joins a side currently sat ninth in the WSL.\n“We’re absolutely delighted to bring Miri to Liverpool,\" said Matt Beard.\n“She will add real versatility to the squad as a midfield player who can also play in any of the three forward positions. Technically she’s a very gifted player and a season in the NWSL last year has given her experience of a physical, transitional league as well.\"",
