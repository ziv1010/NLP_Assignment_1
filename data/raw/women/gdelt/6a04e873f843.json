  "body_text": "A PERSON of interest has reportedly been identified in the horrific assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\nIt comes as the cowardly sniper’s rooftop hideout where he fatally shot Kirk, 31, has been revealed in chilling new pictures.\nThe shooter left forearm prints in the gravel where he lay while firing off a single shot that killed Kirk as he spoke at Utah Valley University on Wednesday afternoon, police said.\nThe pictures show a white evidence marker with the number 2 on it near five orange pointers marking what appear to be indentations left by the suspect’s body or hand on the gravel roof of the Losee Center on the college campus in Orem, Utah.\nThe shooter’s perch has a clear view of the white tent where Kirk was addressing the audience during a student Q&A before he was fatally hit in the neck.\nFederal law enforcement now believe it has identified the name of a person of interest, according to two US officials and a law enforcement source.\nREAD MORE ON CHARLIE KIRK\nAn arrest warrant is yet to be issued.\nWhat we know so far:\n- Two people taken into custody were released, including an elderly man hauled from the scene in

Force Two to pick up his late friend’s remains.\nThe manhunt for the suspect continues after he jumped off the roof and disappeared into the woods following the shooting.\nInvestigators found a gun, footprints, and “good video” of the suspect, FBI officials said at a press conference on Thursday.\nStills from security camera footage show a young man who the FBI identified as a “person of interest”.\nLonger footage from both before and after the tragedy appear to show the same man walking through a neighborhood in Orem.\nDressed in all black, he can be seen calmly walking towards the university campus just minutes before the FBI believe he arrived with a rifle.\nA second video from after the atrocity shows a lone man in the same outfit running behind homes away from the terrified campus.\nIt is unclear if this is the same individual referenced by the US officials and sources.\nThe FBI has urged the public to come forward with any information as they offered a reward of up to $100,000 for details.\nMURDER WEAPON DETAILS\nThe “high-powered, bolt-action rifle” used to kill Kirk was found wrapped in a towel in nearby woods after the shooting, Robert Bohls, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Salt Lake City office, said.\nA picture of the weapon was first published by the New York Post.\nThe gun, a Mauser .30-06, is described as an older-model military rifle that’s commonly used by hunters, according to the New York Times.\nInvestigators reportedly found four cartridges engraved with transgender and antifascist messages inside the rifle, according to an internal federal memo seen by the Wall Street Journal.\nThe exact messages have not been released and have not been confirmed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\nAn official told the New York Times the memo didn’t match other summaries of the evidence.\nInvestigators found more evidence, including a palm imprint, a forearm imprint, and a “footwear impression,” Bohls said.\nA screwdriver was also reportedly found near the weapon, which might have been used to disassemble and reassemble the gun so it could be concealed easily, CNN reported.\nABOUT THE SUSPECT\nClear footage shows the suspected shooter’s movements at Kirk’s speaking event at the college, Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason stated during Thursday’s press briefing.\nThe gunman “appears to be of college age,” Mason said, adding that he “blended in well” with the college crowd.\nVideo shows the suspect arriving on the campus in Orem, Utah, at 11:52 am, investigators said.\nHe went through a building stairwell up onto a roof, and crossed the roof to get to the spot where he fired at Kirk, who was speaking to students in a Q&A, from about 200 yards away.\nAfter the shooting, the suspect moved to the other side of the building, jumped from the roof, and ran off campus into a neighborhood.\n“We are confident in our abilities to track that individual,” Mason said.\nTimeline of Charlie

The inaugural event had about 3,000 people in the audience at the UVU Fountain Courtyard.\nKirk’s last words were spoken to a student who was questioning him about transgender mass shooters from the

Patel announced on Wednesday night that they had taken another person of interest in custody.\nBut the student, Zach Qureshi, was released after he was briefly held for questioning.\nThe hunt for Kirk’s killer continues.\nCharlie Kirk's rise to hero of the youth MAGA movement\nCHARLIE Kirk transformed conservative youth activism from a marginal movement into a powerful force before his assassination on a college campus at 31.\nKirk was an American conservative political activist, author, and media personality who rose to prominence as the co-founder of Turning Point USA (TPUSA).\nHe launched the organization in 2012 when he was just 18 years old, with the goal of promoting conservative principles to high school and college students and became a significant figure in American politics by building a massive grassroots network, framing himself as a “culture warrior.”\nThe rise of Turning Point USA\nTurning Point USA’s mission was to counter what Kirk and his allies saw as liberal dominance on American college campuses.\nIt quickly grew to prominence through his use of provocative activism and viral social media campaigns.\nThey created watchlists of professors pushing leftist propaganda and organized events to debate students on controversial topics.\nThe strategy helped them gain a significant following and financial backing from wealthy conservative donors.\nKirk’s ability to connect with a new generation of conservatives was one of his most notable impacts.\nHe cultivated a style of political engagement that was heavily reliant on social media, podcasts, and confrontational public appearances.\nHis organization’s events, such as the annual Student Action Summit, drew thousands of young attendees and featured prominent conservative speakers, creating a new kind of political ecosystem for young people who felt alienated from traditional conservative groups.\nA key ally of Donald Trump\nKirk also became a staunch supporter and ally of President Donald Trump.\nHe was the youngest speaker at the 2016 Republican National Convention and served as an aide to Donald Trump Jr. during the presidential campaign.\nThis relationship solidified his position within the Republican Party’s “MAGA” (Make America Great Again) wing, and his organization became an integral part of Trump’s political apparatus.\nThrough his popular podcast, “The Charlie Kirk Show,” and his frequent appearances on conservative media, Kirk was a powerful voice in the pro-Trump movement.\nHe often framed political issues as a “spiritual battle” between good and evil and championed a pugnacious, populist form of conservatism.\nHis influence was so significant that after Trump’s 2024 victory, Kirk was credited with helping to mobilize younger voters for the campaign.\nInfluence on culture and social issues\nBeyond traditional politics, Kirk’s influence extended deeply into social and cultural issues.\nHe was a vocal opponent of “woke” ideology, particularly in education and media.\nHe promoted traditional values, often encouraging young women to prioritize becoming homemakers and mothers over professional careers.\nKirk also openly criticized programs related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).\nHe was also a major proponent of Christian nationalism, arguing that there is no true separation of church and state in the United States.\nThe Turning Point Empire\nKirk’s activism led to the expansion of the Turning Point brand into a larger political and media empire.\nHe launched Turning Point Action, a political advocacy group focused on voter mobilization, and Turning Point Faith, aimed at engaging evangelical Christian communities in conservative politics.\nThese affiliated organizations allowed him to broaden his reach and influence beyond college campuses, into a more mainstream political force.",
