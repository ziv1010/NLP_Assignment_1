Adding the Women's World Cup to its portfolio shows the streaming giant is continuing to bulk up its sports rights portfolio. It also comes as the popularity of women's sports has risen over the past year.\n\"I've seen the fandom for the FIFA Women's World Cup grow tremendously — from the electric atmosphere in France in 2019, and most recently, the incredible energy across Australia and New Zealand in 2023,\" Netflix Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria said in a press release. \"Bringing this iconic tournament to Netflix is not just about streaming matches — it's about celebrating the players, the culture, and the passion driving the global rise of women's sports.\"\nThe 2027 tournament is set to take place in 12 cities across Brazil. The host country for the 2031 tournament is yet to be announced.\nNetflix said coverage of the Women's World Cup will include commentary and entertainment from studio shows and top-tier talent, as well as Netflix original documentaries around major players and the sport's rapidly growing fan base in the lead-up to the tournament.\nThe Women's World Cup has continued to grow in popularity, and more people in the U.S. tuned in for the women's final in 2019 than the men's in 2018. U.S. viewership dropped substantially in 2023, however, after the two-time defending champions were knocked out in the Round of 16.\nAs the audience for the WNBA and women's national soccer team has grown significantly in the U.S., soccer remains one of the most popular sports globally.\nNetflix has 282.7 million global memberships, and the streamer has been pushing for growth internationally in part through its cheaper, ad-supported tier.\nSports media rights have also exploded in valuation for media companies as live sports beckon the biggest audiences.\nNetflix has continued to grow into the sports category, streaming a Mike Tyson-Jake Paul fight last month, which was watched by 108 million people, making it the most-streamed sporting event ever, according to Netflix.\nOn Christmas Day, the streamer is set to cover the NFL double-header featuring the Kansas City Chiefs versus the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens versus the Houston Texans.",
