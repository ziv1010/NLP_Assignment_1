  "body_text": "Sam Kerr has played a starring role in Chelsea’s third-straight Women’s FA Cup victory, scoring the game’s lone goal to beat Manchester United in front of a record crowd at Wembley.\nKerr’s 68th-minute strike broke the deadlock to push her side ahead of United and ultimately proved the difference as Chelsea walked away with the trophy in a 1-0 victory.\nDo you like playing at Wembley, @SamKerr1? 😉 #WomensFACupFinal pic.twitter.com/WBkXYdgBmn\n— Chelsea FC Women (@ChelseaFCW) May 14, 2023\nIt is not the first time the Matildas captain has taken the game into her own hands, scoring a double in both finals against Arsenal and Manchester City in 2021 and 2022.\nHer latest FA Cup final goal was scored in front of 77,390 roaring fans, a figure beating the previous record for a women’s domestic football match - at Atletico Madrid vs Barcelona in 2019 - by 17,000 people.\nICONIC.#WomensFACupFinal pic.twitter.com/sxBiVLIg2j\n— Chelsea FC Women (@ChelseaFCW) May 14, 2023\nKerr has now struck six goals in five games this season, with a hat-trick in Chelsea’s opening win over Liverpool and the winning strike in their 1-0 semi-final victory over Aston Villa.\nWith a game in hand, Emma Hayes’ side lies second on the ladder behind United but will have every confidence they can take the lead as the race for the title closes in.\nChelsea midfielder Erin Cuthbert says the victory over United felt good but the desire for even greater achievements has already kicked in.\n“It’s one piece of the jigsaw. I want more, this isn’t enough,\" Cuthbert said post-game.\n“We want to go for the league now. We can only control the controllables.”",
