He is one of nine umpires in VFL/AFL history to officiate in more than 400 games.\nAway from football, McBurney is a vastly experienced lawyer and administrator, having worked in senior roles at Commonwealth and state level, including as the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner from 2018-2023.\n\"Stephen has an immense amount of elite umpiring experience and coupled with a broad skillset and management experience from also working outside the industry, means he will be well placed to lead and drive a strong high-performance culture,\" AFL Executive General Manager of Football Laura Kane said.\n\"He will have focus on developing, recruiting and supporting our elite umpire cohort and with his strong background in women's umpiring will work closely with Lisa Lawry supporting the delivery of the Women & Girls Action Plan across the umpiring department.\"\nMcBurney will report to AFL General Manager of Football Operations Josh Mahoney, and will begin his new role at the end of April.",
