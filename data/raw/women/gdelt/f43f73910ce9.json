A month later, police said the remains had been identified and were those of Christopher Carter, 44, and Sandy Raposo, 48. No one has yet been charged with the killings.\n• An Abbotsford man with a rare lung disease went through double-lung transplant surgery on Jan. 7. Kolton Fowlie, 25, was diagnosed at the age of one with a terminal condition known as bronchiolitis obliterans and was placed on the transplant list in December 2024. After his surgery, Fowlie’s health improved throughout the year, and he continues to do well.\n• Pro golfer Nick Taylor of Abbotsford clinched $1.57 million after winning the Sony Open on Jan. 12 in Honolulu, beating Nico Echavarria in a playoff. It was his first win in 11 months after beating Charley Hoffman in a playoff at the WM Phoenix Open in February 2024. Prior to that – in June 2023 – Taylor became the first Canadian in 69 years to win the RBC Canadian Open.\n• Farmer Sukhman Gill, 25, announced he would be seeking the Conservative nomination in the new federal riding of Abbotsford-South Langley. Former MLA Mike de Jong had previously announced that he would seek the nomination, as did Mike Murray, Steve Schafer and Dustin Hiles. Also later announcing their candidacy were Shanjeelin Dwivedi and Gurnoor Sidhu. Hiles later dropped out of the race.\n• Tanner Fox of Abbotsford was sentenced to life in prison with no parole eligibility for 20 years in relation to the July 2022 shooting death in Surrey of Ripudaman Singh Malik, 75. Malik, who was acquitted in 2005 of the 1985 Air India bombing that killed 329 people, was shot multiple times while sitting in his car outside his business. Fox’s co-accused Jose Lopez later received the same sentence as Fox.\nFEBRUARY\n• Daycare operator Indu Takhar, 60, was charged with six counts of assault from December 2021 and January 2023 at the Smile ’N’ Play Daycare. Police said their investigation began in October 2024 and involved children ages two to six. The case is scheduled to go to trial on April 20, 2026.\n• The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team announced it was investigating an assault in Abbotsford that resulted in the death of a 19-year-old man. Witnesses reported seeing the man being assaulted and then taken away in a vehicle on Jan. 27. The victim was located about three hours later in the Crescent Beach area of Surrey. He died in hospital on Feb. 2. In late July, four men were charged with first-degree murder and a fifth with forcible confinement. The case is continuing to make its way through the courts.\n• Abbotsford brothers Case and Erik Timmermans died in an ice-fishing accident on Feb. 4 at Grace Lake northwest of Agassiz. Case started Timmermans Landscaping and Tree Service in 1978 and was joined by Erik in 1981.\n• The trial began Feb. 25 for Gary Losch, the man accused of killing Chelsey Gauthier of Abbotsford in July 2017. Gauthier’s body was found Aug. 16 of that year in a shallow grave in an isolated area of Mission near Sylvester and Dale Road. In July, Losch, 70, was convicted of manslaughter and indignity to human remains.\nMARCH\n• Farmer Sukhman Gill, who had no prior political experience, won the federal Conservative nomination race for Abbotsford-South Langley, beating out four other candidates. Long-time former Abbotsford MLA Mike de Jong said that, on March 3, his application to seek the nomination had been denied by the national office despite receiving unanimous approval at the local level. De Jong said he was given no reason for his application having been rejected.\n• Abbotsford school trustees Jared White and Mike Rauch were censured by the board of education after White shared a video on his trustee Facebook page of US President Donald Trump signing an executive order banning transgender athletes from women’s sports. White commented on the post: “ … Common sense is making a comeback and it’s about time,” and Rauch “liked” it and also commented.\n• The Columbia Bible College Bearcats women’s basketball team won the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association’s national title on March 15 after defeating Alberta’s St. Mary’s University Lightning 77-70 in the final. It was a remarkable turnaround for a program that suffered through a 54-game losing streak from 2018 to 2023 and had never won a Pacwest playoff game prior to this season.\n• Prime Minister Mark Carney announced on March 23 that the next federal election would take place on Monday, April 28. At the time, five candidates had been announced for the two Abbotsford ridings: Sukhman Gill (Conservatives) and Dharmasena Yakandawela (NDP) in Abbotsford-South Langley, and Brad Vis (Conservatives), Jules Cote (NDP) and Kevin Sinclair (People’s Party) in Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon. Mike de Jong later came forward as an independent in Abbotsford-South Langley, as did Kevin Gillies (Liberals), Melissa Snazell (Greens) and Aeriol Alderking (People’s Party). In Mission-Matsqui, other candidates who came forward were John Kidder (Conservatives) and Jeff Howe (Liberals).\nAPRIL\n• A mass email and social media posts threatened local schools with violence on April 7, including that bombs had been placed at Abbotsford Senior Secondary School. Police held a press conference to say they had determined that the threats were not real and there was no risk to students. They said they were also investigating whether there was any link to the messages and to six “swatting” incidents that occurred at local homes over the weekend.\n• The Abbotsford Police Department announced a new six-month pilot program that would see officers from two designated patrol shifts wearing body cameras, with 16 in total being put into use. The program was to begin in May and to be assessed at the end of the six months to assess its efficacy and ongoing costs. Police have not yet released their findings.\n• It was a blue sweep in the federal election on April 28. Conservative candidate Sukhman Gill, who had not attended any all-candidates meetings or done any media interviews, clinched the Abbotsford-South Langley riding with 24,166 votes ahead of Kevin Gillies (Liberal) with 18,969 votes. Long-time former MLA Mike de Jong (Independent) finished in third spot, with 9,747 votes. In Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon, Conservative candidate Brad Vis won with 33,971 votes compared to Jeff Howe (Liberal) with 21,838.\n• The Abbotsford Police Department announced the completion of its new four-storey expansion, which had begun construction in September 2022. The new facilities include additional investigative space, enhanced and modernized forensics and digital forensics labs, improved training space, and more parking, jail cells and bail-hearing rooms. The second phase – integrating the original building with the new expansion – is expected to be complete in spring 2026. The total cost of the project is $87.1 million.\nMAY\n• A teenage boy lost his life when he was stabbed at Larch Park on May 25. Billy Ledoux, 15, was a Yale Secondary student who was found with critical injuries in the evening and died on scene despite life-saving attempts from bystanders and first responders. No arrests or charges have yet been made in connection with this case.\n• The Eligibility to Hold Public Office Act passed a third reading in the legislature on May 27, immediately kicking Abbotsford West MLA Korky Neufeld out of his role on the Abbotsford board of education and launching a byelection, set for October. The new law prevents MLAs from holding office as another local elected official, impacting Neufeld and Langley-Aldergrove MLA Misty Van Popta.\n• After Langley-Abbotsford MLA Harman Bhangu reshared his speech in the B.C. Legislature claiming there was nepotism in the truck operators union local, Teamsters Union Local 213 responded by suing the elected official. The union filed a lawsuit against Bhangu on May 26, accusing him of defamation. The case centred around the way that owner-operator truckers are dispatched to road construction sites through the Community Benefits Agreement. Bhangu’s lawyers responded to the lawsuit on June 30, denying the accusations levied against the MLA. The allegations in this lawsuit have yet to be proven in court.\nJUNE\n• Canadian think tank MEI (Montreal Economic Institute) released a report on June 3 on ER wait times at B.C. hospitals, with Abbotsford Regional Hospital and Victoria General Hospital tied for the worst in the province. Both hospitals had average wait times of six hours and 36 minutes – far longer than the provincial average of four hours and 13 minutes. In an effort to curb these lengthy wait times, the provincial government implemented a campaign to attract more U.S. nurses and doctors to B.C. hospitals.\n• For the second time in only three years, the Clearbrook Road off-ramp was named Abbotsford’s most dangerous intersection. The ICBC report released on June 5 included crash data all throughout the city, with this off-ramp being the site of 199 vehicle incidents in 2024. This was an increase of 15 crashes from 2023, giving the intersection a 45 per cent chance of seeing a car crash on any given day.\n• After a historic playoff run, the Abbotsford Canucks defeated the Charlotte Checkers in game six of the AHL finals on June 23, becoming the Calder Cup champions for the first time ever. The next day, they returned to Abbotsford and were mobbed by fans waiting at the airport to celebrate the team’s historic win. The Canucks also held a championship event on June 26 with fans, which included speeches, souvenir signings, a trophy presentation and other general festivities.\nJULY\n• After two years of serving as Abbotsford’s superintendent of schools, Sean Nosek departed from his role on July 2. Nathan Ngieng was appointed as the temporary head of the Abbotsford School District and was later made the permanent replacement on July 15. Ngieng has been a part of the Abbotsford School District since 2017, first joining as the director of learning support services.\n• On July 7, the City of Abbotsford announced that the community would have to wait a while before being able to enjoy the proposed splash pad at Crossley Park. Although it was originally intended to open in the spring of 2025, the city said complications with the procurement process and regulatory requirements had resulted in significant delays. The current timeline for the new splash pad has an opening date of late spring of 2026, with construction set to begin in a few weeks.\n• Controversial Christian singer Sean Feucht announced plans for an Abbotsford show at Mill Lake Park, but mounting public pressure against the event forced the city to review Feucht’s permit on July 23. Less than a week later, the city decided to deny a permit for Feucht, forcing the singer with MAGA ties to find a new location for his Aug. 24 show. Feucht would later secure a spot on a private farm near the U.S.-Canada border, where more than 100 people showed up to the concert, which took place without any notable incidents.\nAUGUST\n• The Abbotsford Police Department became Canada’s first law enforcement agency to start using the BolaWrap 150 device, which immobilizes targets by shooting a lasso-like restraint around the person’s body. This tool is an alternative to other devices such as stun guns, rubber bullets, or batons. During a public demonstration of the device on Aug. 7, the Abbotsford Police Department said six of these BolaWrap 150 devices had been purchased for approximately $1,500 each and were designated for patrol shift use.\n• In August, the cities of Abbotsford and Mission announced they would be ending their recycling partnership with Archway Community Services after 42 years, putting dozens of vulnerable people out of work. In order to save costs, the role of operating the recycling facilities in Abbotsford and Mission switched over to the private company Emterra Group, starting Jan. 1. As a result, the 62 people who were employed at the recycling depots, many of whom are either newcomers to Canada or have some sort of disability, were forced to find other employment. The City of Mission later announced that it partnered with Archway Community Services to find five of these individuals part-time employment in litter and invasive plant management.\n• The Archway Food Bank sounded the alarm in August about a severe lack of donations, which was making it hard to keep up with the demand from the community. Compared to 2022, the food bank was providing food to nearly twice as many people, with the monthly clients surpassing 6,000.\nSEPTEMBER\n• The Ministry of Infrastructure announced that Abbotsford will be receiving a new francophone school, one of two being built in the province. The province provided $26 million for the new location and it will be found in the Ten Oaks neighbourhood.\n• RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul was charged with one count of assault and one count of assault by choking related to an off-duty incident in Abbotsford in July.

Vancouver earned a 3-1 win with goals from Nils Hoglander, Victor Mancini and Filip Chytil.\n• The Abbotsford Canucks announced that head coach Manny Malhotra’s contract was extended and he will remain under contract with the team until the end of the 2026-27 season. Malhotra led the team to the Calder Cup in his first season behind the bench and also posted the franchise’s best-ever regular season record at 44-24-2-2.\n• Former Abbotsford mayor George Peary died on Sept. 29 at the age of 84. He served 18 years as a councillor for the District of Matsqui and later the City of Abbotsford. He went on to serve as the mayor from 2008 to 2011. Condolences were posted from people from all walks of life following the news. He also spent decades in the education system and was active in several community associations for years.\nOCTOBER\n• The Abbotsford Police Department formed an extortion task force to deal with incidents in the community that have been occurring since on and off since November 2023. Three of five local shootings that took place in September were linked to extortion, which led to the decision.\n• Abbotsford city council endorsed a new policy to spend up to $500,000 on public art over the next five years during a council meeting on Oct. 7. The new policy sees funding of $75,000 for 2026 and 2027, $100,00 for 2028 and 2029 and $125,000 for 2030. The funding will also allow the city to purchase one public art project at $250,000 or two at $125,000. Funding comes from a public art capital program established in the city’s 2026 financial plan.\n• Arsh Kaler earned more than 60 per cent of the vote to win the Abbotsford school trustee byelection on Oct. 11. He collected 2,908 of 4,830 votes, while Tanya Coghill finished second at 1,290. Turnout was 4.8 per cent and the byelection occurred following provincial legislation that stated MLAs cannot also serve in council or school board positions. Korky Neufeld’s win in Abbotsford West in October 2024 triggered the byelection. Kaler became the youngest ever elected official at the age of 22.\n• A one-night count in Abbotsford saw a 41 per cent increase in people experiencing homeless compared to a count done on the same date in 2024. The city stated that the increase was due to both a rise in the number of people without stable housing and changes to federal guidelines on how participants were identified and recorded.\n• Abbotsford school trustee Jared White’s motion to adjust how teachers use sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) materials failed in a 5-2 vote on Oct. 21. White wanted elementary and middle school teachers to give parents one week’s notice before using SOGI materials. Following the motion’s failure, trustee Preet Rai motioned that the board affirm its support for educators and recognize parents as partners in education. That motion passed 5-2.\n• Darshan Sahsi was identified as the victim of a brash shooting inside his truck outside his home on Ridgeview Drive on the morning of Oct. 27. It was one of three shootings that rocked Abbotsford from Oct. 25 to 27. The other two incidents saw victims sent to the hospital with injuries.\n• A Rogers technicians strike in Abbotsford that lasted more than four months came to an end on Oct. 29. Workers were striking because those in Abbotsford were making nine per cent less than those in the Lower Mainland, but that wage gap was diminished under this new five-year agreement.\nNOVEMBER\n• BC Housing experienced pushback from locals on a proposed temporary modular housing project for supportive housing that parents say is too close to a school.

Portions of Highway 1 were closed from Dec. 12 to 15 and a number of other local roads were closed over the week. In addition to homes, it was reported that six poultry farms had been impacted by flooding.\n• The Abbotsford Disaster Relief Fund, which was established in 2021, was reactivated by local organizations to help the community deal with the effects of flooding.
