Phyland McClure polled in all but two games on the season and also took out the under-15 netball MVP award.\nPhyland-McClure said she had no idea she would poll as well as she did.\n\"I'm not too sure what stood out about me, I'm really surprised, I didn't know what to expect, I thought it was going to be very tough to get any votes,\" she said.\n\"I started as a shooter when I was really young, but I always found it a bit different to play defence. I think there's a lot more pressure on you when you are shooting.\n\"With the defending I always enjoyed the jumping aspect, it's more about keeping up with your opponent than trying to dodge. I do athletics at school, so I think that's why I enjoy it.\n\"It's really exciting to win these awards, I never expected anything like this.\"\nRedan's Pippa Edwards was a dominant winner in the under-13s award polling 30 votes t win by eight. Sebastopol's Armani Daws was named the league MVP.\nEdwards said she had been happy with the season, but had particularly enjoyed the friendships with her teammates.\n\"It was lovely playing with the girls I played with,\" she said. \"The whole club was really nice, really supportive and if I dropped my head, they'd always be there to help me get up again and we'd finish strong, it was really good.\n\"I'm shaking a bit, it's really unexpected to hold this award, I didn't expect it at all. I generally play goal defence, but sometimes I move into centre and get to mix it around.\"\nUNDER-17\n25 - Lily Woodland-Boyanton (East Point)\n22 - Elizabeth Morrison (Redan)\n19 - Grace Crowe (Ballarat)\n18 - Elsie Sinnott (North Ballarat)\n17 - Eden James (Lake Wendouree)\n17 - Caitlin McConchie (Ballarat)\n15 - Maggie Harris (Ballarat)\n15 - Kate Aikman (North Ballarat)\n14 - Tiana Di Mieri (Darley)\n14 - Georgia Hayne (Storm)\nUNDER-15\n31 - Lucy Phyland-McClure (Bacchus Marsh)\n29 - Mikayla Tito (Darley)\n29 - Audrey Murnane (North Ballarat)\n26 - Harper Murrihy (Redan)\n20 - Tessa Wilson (Mount Clear)\n16 - Lena Wiltshire (Lake Wendouree)\n15 - Lily Graco (Storm)\n14 - Gracie Sullivan (Storm)\n13 - Jasmine Matthews (Darley)\nUNDER-13\n30 - Pippa Edwards (Redan)\n22 - Keisha Momcilovic (Bacchus Marsh)\n22 - Ruby Westhead (Darley)\n21 - Freya Loong (Bacchus Marsh)\n18 - Isabella Watson (Ballarat)\n17 - Armani Daws (Sebastopol)\n16 - Alia Sisic (East Point)\n14 - Zoe Dunster (Darley)\n14 - Annabelle Ford (Redan)\n- Need more sport from The Courier?
