Follow along as we track their progress as they prepare both mentally and physically for a chance to shine on the game’s biggest stage.\n“Exhaaauuusssteeed,” said Ali Riley. She was calling the day after Angel City FC felt three points slip through their fingers on an away trip against the Portland Thorns. Their hard-fought 3-2 lead evaporated in the seventh minute of stoppage as Thorns goalkeeper Bella Bixby went up on a corner and, well-\nThere’s not really much else to say after losing road points at almost the last second on a wildly improbable event like a goalkeeper back-heel.\n“The NWSL was NWSL-ing, that’s for sure,” Riley said.\nAdvertisement\nAt this point, there were roughly 80 days left until the World Cup. Putting a number on it made everything seem to come into very sharp focus for ACFC’s captain and feel much, much closer.\n“100 days goes by so fast,” Riley opined.\nIt hasn’t been smooth sailing for New Zealand’s Football Ferns in their last few months of preparation. They’ve racked up some tough losses through February and April, including their most recent, a 0-3 loss to Nigeria. Their best result this year is a 1-1 tie against Iceland. Only a year ago they came within a hair’s breadth of defeating longtime rival Australia in a 2-1 friendly, sunk by two stoppage time goals, followed by mixed results — including a 1-0 win over Mexico and close results with South Korea.\n“We’re not all going to be together again until right before the tournament starts, and that can be scary,” Riley said. She was frank about where they had left things. “I think we are still struggling with nailing down some of our defense and our ability to score goals with the national team.”\nIt’s on all of the players now to put in as much work as they can with their clubs or for those players whose seasons finish in April or May, to start training together in Aotearoa New Zealand.\nThis is not a new challenge for national teams. The reality is players spend 90% of their time with their clubs and only descend on national team camps a few times a year for a week or two at a time. The Ferns have an additional level of difficulty by being so scattered across the globe; players might have to connect across the United States, England, and Aotearoa New Zealand, covering a 19-hour time zone swing.\n“It’s so hard to even be on a Zoom call,” Riley said.\nShe sometimes has to have her own individual calls with an assistant coach because a UK evening/Aotearoa New Zealand morning call is usually 12:30 PM PT, “right smack in the middle of Angel City training,” Riley said.\nAdvertisement\nThat reality of club versus country makes it crucial, Riley said, for players to advocate for better standards, more resources, and living wages.\n“That’s the environment where you need to be getting your fitness, your strength in, the coaching needs to be good,” she said. “If you’re not playing games as a regular starter, what do the sessions for the subs look like? How are you maintaining fitness? I experienced that when I was at Chelsea trying to get ready for the 2019 World Cup, not getting playing time. And every day off, I’m trying to come into the facility, begging a coach to come in and train with me, getting a fitness program that I could do extra to make sure that I could be ready.”\nAnd, Riley said, that reliance on being able to find a good club and stay there is why it’s so crucial for FIFA to increase the prize money for the women.\n“Qualifying for a World Cup, to get the financial support, and also being in the tournament — that money should be life changing for players. It should help boost a federation so much,” she said, especially now with the tournament expanding to 32 teams.\nAnd this goes particularly for teams like the Ferns, where Riley pointed out that the players get per diems from the federation but are not paid salaries, and so they have to rely entirely on club and sponsorship money to actually make a living. Maybe that’s fine on the men’s side, where players can make millions. But the women’s game isn’t there yet. The minimum salary for the Australian A-League where many Ferns play was approximately $13,428 for the 2022-23 season. Even playing for the comparatively generous Angel City FC, Riley has flat out said she’s not making “rest of your life” money. And if you’re not in a league where you can at least earn enough to pay the rent year round, then you have to get a day job, which naturally interferes with the ability to train full time as a professional player.\nAdvertisement\nEven with a full-time salary, Riley’s average day looks like this: at Angel City training from around 8:30 AM to 2 or 3 PM, recovery, working her side hustles and fulfilling sponsorship obligations, creating content for her social media, doing media calls, 9 PM national team call to go over analysis, bedtime.\n“Representing your entire country is always going to be a huge honor,” she said. “But I hope that there’s more financial support and it can be more sustainable.”\nThat could mean a big leap in tournament prize money, or club salaries for women increasing globally, or a solid domestic league in Aotearoa New Zealand.\nAn increase in investment can’t come soon enough as leagues, federations, and FIFA have all started loading up players with more games as they realize that women’s soccer is grabbing more attention, and more money. Riley was quick to point at what feels like a recent spate of serious injuries — Leah Williamson’s ACL rupture was fresh on her mind at that point, on top of other high profile ACL tears like Beth Mead, Vivianne Miedema, and Janine Beckie, not to mention Fran Kirby needing knee surgery at the beginning of May, a Matildas squad juggling various injuries and a Canada squad doing the same.\n“I don’t know what will change between now and July 10,” she said. “But next year there’s the Olympics…every region wants to have their form of the Euros, there’s only going to be more and more tournaments, then there’s talk of a Women’s Club World Cup. (Injury prevention) definitely needs to be a priority because we won’t be able to get the best out of players. We want to grow the sport and inspire and we won’t be able to do that as everyone’s favorite players are getting injured or retiring early or getting burnt out.”\nIt’s not just about paychecks, it’s about health resources too, like trainers, doctors and recovery equipment.\n“We don’t have the same kind of resources as our male counterparts,” she said. “We’re filling stadiums and playing these games — finally it feels like we are catching up in some areas. But in other areas we’re still so far behind, you’ve got that discrepancy, and that disparity could be dangerous.”\nAdvertisement\nRiley pointed to the importance of FIFPro and player unions in helping players advocate for their safety. She also thinks social media has been a game changer for players in being able to somewhat level the playing field, publicizing their advocacy. Riley has a genuine desire to have more and bigger tournaments and to inspire more girls to participate, particularly in countries that are new to the World Cup, but the players have to protect themselves because profit-driven organizations might not. “That’s the balance of growing,” Riley said.\nNo wonder Riley is tired, with all of that on her mind. The Ferns have one more friendly to prepare for, a sendoff match against Vietnam in Ahuriri/Napier on July 10. Then they’ll kick off as one of the host nations on July 20 against Norway. And hopefully, somewhere in there, Riley will find time to sleep.\n(Photo: Meg Oliphant/Getty Images; Design: Ray Orr)",
