It also confirmed that a women’s edition will take place from 2028.\n\"The FIFA Club World Cup will not only be the pinnacle of club football, but also a vivid demonstration of solidarity that will benefit clubs on a scale that no other competition has ever done,\" said FIFA president Gianni Infantino.\n\"All revenue generated by the tournament will be distributed to the participating clubs and via club solidarity across the world, as FIFA will not keep a single dollar.\"\nBritish streaming service DAZN was awarded the exclusive global rights to the tournament, which will take place from 14 June to 13 July, in December. A source close to the negotiations said the contract was worth around one billion euros ($1.05 billion).\nFIFA has also signed sponsorship contracts with Coca-Cola, Bank of America, Chinese electronics brand Hisense, and Belgian brewers AB InBev.\nBy comparison, the total prize money for the 2022 men’s World Cup in Qatar was $440 million, while for the 2023 Women’s World Cup in New Zealand and Australia, it was $110 million.\nThis season’s UEFA Champions League, with a new 36-club format, will pay a total of 2.47 billion euros ($2.66 billion) to the clubs involved.\nWidespread criticism over player welfare\nFIFA’s expansion of the tournament has been met with widespread criticism, especially in Europe, largely due to concerns over player welfare.\nThe global footballers’ union FIFPro and the European Leagues association filed a complaint with the European Commission in October against FIFA, accusing it of abusing its dominant position by overcrowding the calendar.\nThe Champions League was also expanded by UEFA this season, and some players, including Ballon d’Or winner Rodri and Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk, have raised the prospect of a strike.\n\"I think we are close to that. I think if you ask any player, he will say the same,\" said Rodri when asked in September if there was a possibility of players going on strike, shortly before suffering a season-ending knee injury.\n\"It is not the opinion of Rodri or whatever. I think it’s the general opinion of the players.\"\nThe tournament will feature 12 teams from Europe, six from South America, and four each from Asia, Africa, and North and Central America.\nAuckland City and Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami complete the line-up.\nNot all the reaction has been negative, with Paris Saint-Germain coach Luis Enrique insisting \"everyone\" would want to play.\n\"Once every four years, there’s this new, extremely exciting competition. Everyone wants to go to the Club World Cup,\" he said last year.\nThe tournament will be held at 12 venues across 11 cities in the United States, with the final at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, which will also host the 2026 World Cup final.\n-\nBreezy Johnson engaged at Olympics after emotional finish line proposal\n-\nOlympics men hockey game: McDavid, Crosby power Canada past Czechia\n-\nEx-Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey charged with additional rape counts\n-\nChloe Kim set for historic halfpipe gold showdown at Milano Cortina\n-\nVladyslav Heraskevych disqualified from Winter Olympics 2026 over helmet controversy\n-\nThomas Tuchel set for England contract extension through Euro 2028\n-\nMilano-Cortina 2026: Assessing Italy’s Winter Olympics economic growth\n-\nVictor Wembanyama’s historic first half tops Tim Duncan, sparks massive NBA reactions",
