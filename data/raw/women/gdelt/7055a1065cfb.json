  "body_text": "A Cumbrian law firm has pledged its support for a women’s football team in the county for the ninth consecutive season.\nBendles Solicitors is sponsoring Carlisle United Ladies FC for the ninth year in a row, continuing a partnership that began in 2016.\nThe firm first sponsored the club when the daughter of a staff member played for the team.\nHannah Smith, partner at Bendles Solicitors, said: \"We’re passionate about engaging with the local community, helping women’s football to grow and continuing the momentum of recent success for women’s football in England.\n\"As a Cumbrian-based firm, supporting community initiatives is central to everything we do, and we hope that our continued support will help to grow recognition of Carlisle United Ladies both in the local area and beyond.\"\nBendles, established more than 200 years ago, now operates from offices in Carlisle, Wigton and Whitehaven.\nThe firm regularly supports community causes across Cumbria and says it encourages staff to take part in fundraising activities.\nTracy Gannon, manager of Carlisle United Ladies, said: \"Bendles have supported us for a long time now and their principles about supporting their community align with ours.\n\"In a time when most funding is focused on junior football, the backing of local businesses is essential for keeping adult teams thriving.\n\"Support like this doesn’t just help us compete, it keeps the heart of community football beating.\"\nMs Gannon said: \"The fact that a large company like Bendles believes in us will hopefully encourage other local businesses to get on board and want to be a part of what we do.\"\nThe partnership goes beyond financial support.\nBendles staff have joined training nights with the team and organised a pizza night to watch the Lionesses during the Euros.\nCarlisle United Ladies currently compete in the Premiership Division of the Lancashire County Women’s League.\nThis season, they have promoted seven players from the development squad to the first team.\nMs Gannon said: \"We’ve moved some of the girls up from the development team, so the squad is now made up of quite a lot of younger players this year.\n\"This is a big learning curve for them, so they’re still finding their feet.\n\"I’m looking forward to seeing them develop as the season progresses and watching them grow and adapt to the big step up from junior to senior football.\"",
