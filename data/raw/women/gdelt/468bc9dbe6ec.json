And Giblin is slowly losing hope that his adored ground will return to its former glory.\n“You know, I invest a lot of time [in] the oval, and the people who work here all take pride in coming here,” he says. “[But] it’s hard when it’s in this state.” There aren’t enough toilets, male and female referees have to share change rooms and, in 2022, a railing fell down mid-match, injuring several spectators.\nBut Giblin’s hopes of restoration are further away than ever, after the Minns government this week officially ruled out providing any state funding to the stadium, the culmination of a years-long funding stoush between the state government, the Wests Tigers club (which uses it as one of two home grounds and threatened to leave this week), and Inner West Council (which manages the site).\nExactly how much does the site need freshening up? Giblin took the Sydney Morning Herald on a tour of the site to explain.\nLeichhardt Oval is weird. For a start, the small stadium in Sydney’s inner west is neither located in Leichhardt (it’s in Lilyfield), nor is it an oval (it’s rectangular). And despite Sydney’s years-long obsession with stadiums, this little ground loved by fans and players alike, has received little funding or basic upkeep. In some ways, it’s the stadium Sydney forgot it had.\nThere’s no place this is better shown than in the tiny metres-long box that sits in the middle of the Wayne Pearce Hill, named in honour of the former Balmain Tigers captain and first Wests Tigers coach.\nThe scoreboard, sitting on top of the outdoor bar, is one of only a few remaining manual scoreboards in Sydney.\nTo get up to the iconic narrow space, you need to climb a thin yellow ladder that opens up to a single room cluttered with vintage chairs and an old air-conditioning system surrounded by dozens of plastic and metal signs with the names of every team imaginable.\nMost matches, scoreboard attendant Barry “Big Baz” Maguire – a legendary figure who has held the job for decades – keeps the numbers ticking over. Today, Giblin is doing the honours, changing football score signage to one for a rugby match. But one sign, on the highest level of the board, won’t be changed: “SAVE LEICHHARDT OVAL”.\nWhy, exactly, does Leichhardt Oval need saving? To answer that, Giblin takes us down the hill and around the field to show us the most-complained about section in the entire venue: the change rooms and showers.\nWalking past noticeboards full of historical newspaper clippings and team photos, all players, coaches and referees enter desperately small rooms with a row of benches on either side of the cement walls. There are no lockers. The change room for the away team is separated from the main area by a curtain.\nIt was only last year, when the FIFA Women’s World Cup came to Sydney, that doors were installed on the stadium’s player showers.\nAnd when there were multiple teams training on the ground, portable tents were set up to facilitate them.\n“[Elite female athletes] are getting changed in a shed,” Giblin says. “When the Matildas are playing in Sydney, they’ll ring us up and say, ‘We need somewhere to train’. And we say, ‘This is what we’ve got’,” he says, gesturing to the orange and black walls.\n“They should be getting better facilities than that. If we’ve got a doubleheader, you’ve gotta have one team in [the large change room] and another in [the half-size] one.”\nInner West Council wants the oval to become a hub for women’s sport. It showed that was possible during the Women’s World Cup when teams from around the world trained at the facility. Spain trained there just before winning the cup. Sydney FC’s women’s team returned to the venue late last year, too.\nThe space allocated to referees is even smaller, barely two metres wide.\n“You can have six people officiating a game, and male and female referees are sharing in very cramped conditions,” Giblin says. “At the end of the day you need somewhere to sit and hang your jersey – but we’ve moved on from just the basics.”\nOn the wall of the referees’ room, a 1990s-style motivational poster has the word “CHANGE” printed on the bottom, with a painting of a tiger lurking in the grass. “In today’s world there are two kinds of companies,” the poster reads. “The quick, and the dead!”\nOperating a stadium is about money and the Inner West Council doesn’t have any more of it.\nIt recently upgraded the corporate Centurions Lounge, on the top level of the main Latchem Robinson Stand. It partly justified the spending by increasing its use as a community facility: the council hosted training nights for Yes campaigners during the Voice to parliament referendum last year.\nBut just outside the lounge, Giblin is standing in one of several corporate boxes that sell on game days for $339 per person. There are two rows of plastic seats, with salmon-coloured tables, a bar fridge and a kettle.\nThe outdoor boxes just below sell for $279 per person, and the catering is delivered in eskies.\n“Catering, bar, how you provide food – it’s a bit of an afterthought,” Giblin says. “It’s not a focus. At the time it was probably fine [when it opened up], but not anymore.”\nAll this is part of the stadium’s rustic charm – people know what to expect when they’re sitting on the hill with a beer on a Sunday afternoon – but the stadium is rapidly approaching a point where its age and lack of facilities will turn more fans, clubs and sponsors away.\n“If you just keep maintaining [this area] at this level, you can do little maintenance things, but in terms of how the market’s moving, it’s moving away from us.”\nThe Inner West Council’s master plan for the site, which could cost up to $100 million, features an extension of the main stadium, and fresh covered seating across sections of the hill. It has been organised in pieces so that some progress can be made even if the council doesn’t get its full list of funding.\nBut after Minns’ rejection for more money on Monday – ignoring the council and Tigers’ pleas for 10 per cent of the funding for Penrith Stadium – the Tigers, who are yet to commit to a home ground beyond the end of this year, are set to deliver on their promise to vacate the site.\nLocal mayor Darcy Byrne issued a warning on Thursday: “If we don’t receive our fair share of funding, the facilities that are already retrograde will become unsafe.\n“If we had a boutique theatre, like the State Theatre or the Theatre Royal, that had received no state government funding and was going to have to close its doors, everyone would rightly say, ‘Come on’. There’s an intangible value to this place that has to be held and respected.”\nStart the day with a summary of the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.
