  "body_text": "England's Alex Greenwood on Women's Finalissima: 'A packed-out Wembley is always special'\nThursday, April 6, 2023\nArticle summary\n\"Two of the best countries in the world competing for silverware: how good is that?\" says the England defender as her side prepare to meet Brazil.\nArticle top media content\nArticle body\nEuropean champions England take on South American counterparts Brazil in the first-ever Women's Finalissima at a sold-out Wembley Stadium on Thursday 6 April, and defender Alex Greenwood knows it will be quite the occasion.\nThe 29-year-old was part of the England team that won Women's EURO 2022 in front of a competition-record crowd at Wembley, and the Manchester City left-back is sure that the inaugural Women's Finalissima will be another milestone in the development of the female game.\nOn the Women's Finalissima\nIt's massive and at a packed-out Wembley, which is always special as well. It's a game that is happening for the first time, so it's brilliant that we're a part of it. And it's brilliant for women's football. The development, especially recently over the past year, it's just exploded. You've got this game, two of the best countries in the world competing for silverware. How good is that?\n[Brazil] are a top nation with some incredible individuals. I've played [against] them a number of times, and they always cause us problems and [give] us a test. I always look forward to playing against Brazil for those reasons. Sometimes you never know what you are going to get, and it's a really good competition to have before you go into a World Cup.\nOn Brazil forward Marta\nThe word 'icon' is really relevant for [Brazil forward Marta]. She has single-handedly grown the game [because of] how talented she is, what she has achieved in her career, and to still be playing as well at such a high level and still [be] so good is a compliment to herself. She was someone I always looked up to when I was growing up and someone who I wanted to be.\nPlaying against her was a little bit overwhelming when I first [faced] her because you watch this player on TV and you hear about her, you see her and then you play against her. She is an incredible footballer.\nOn England's Women's EURO celebrations\nI laugh because it's hard to even put [it] into words. I would almost describe it as an out-of-body experience – I couldn't really control my emotions or feelings – but, at the same time, it was like: 'Oh my God, we've done it, we've won!' I think my first thought was, obviously, to embrace the girls and celebrate with them, but then [go over] straight to my family – straight to that left corner by the dugout, find my people and just celebrate with them.\nWhere does England's team spirit come from? It's natural, it's organic. It comes from people being allowed to be themselves, which is something, definitely, Sarina [Wiegman] has brought into this group. When you've got 23 women, you've got 23 different personalities and everyone brings something different: some are quiet, some are loud. [To be] allowed to be that person and be open about it, it almost makes the team [feel] a lot more relaxed, and we are a really, really close team.\nOn England's World Cup prospects\nWe've played [in a major tournament] last summer and [we] play again this summer – it's quite unique that that happens. So it's a sense of momentum. It's the cliché answer that maybe you don't want, but we really do take each game as it comes. Of course, we want to be ready for 22 July, which is the priority, [and to be] fit and healthy and in a really good place, and we'll go from there.",
