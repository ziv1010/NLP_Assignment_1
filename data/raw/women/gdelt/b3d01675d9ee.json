There’s been hype, but also legitimate growth.\nThis year, the FA celebrated a record season for the Women’s Super League (WSL). Attendances in the WSL are up 173 per cent compared with last season; albeit there have been many more games played inside clubs’ larger main stadiums, the average WSL attendance has also more than doubled, to 5,272 from 1,931.\nSky Sports’ average viewership for the WSL has increased by 53 per cent and the BBC also had record viewing figures for two WSL games, with the highest-ever peak of 1.35 million for a Chelsea-Tottenham last November. Streaming platform DAZN recently released an impact report detailing the impressive numbers achieved by its Women’s Champions League coverage on YouTube. Last season, DAZN’s global free-to-view coverage drew 64 million views on YouTube, with 4.1 million live views of the final between Barcelona and Lyon.\nAdvertisement\nWe’ve seen England players pull in lucrative individual commercial partnerships off the back of their 2022 European Championship win and domestic leagues across Europe sign on new partners.\nThe impressive figures and justified hype that surrounds the game right now certainly create an exciting atmosphere ahead of a showpiece summer for women’s football.\nBut the record-breaking numbers and high-profile endorsement deals create an illusion of stability, sustainability and investment. In reality, with only weeks to go until the Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand kicks off on July 20, when preparations should be down to just the final details, there is still so much to be decided.\nTelevision and commercial rights\nWhen it comes to World Cup TV rights, there is still nothing agreed between football’s global governing body FIFA and channels in Spain, Germany, Italy, France and Japan. In the UK, while things have been slow, the big two terrestrial broadcasters BBC and ITV are very close to finalising a deal to share coverage of the tournament.\nThe situation in some of Europe’s top footballing nations and Japan has reached a frustrating point with the tournament at risk of not being broadcast at all in certain territories if agreements can’t be reached.\nThis week, matters reached a new level of tension as sports ministers from all the European countries concerned released a joint statement calling for the issue to be resolved. In it, the ministers pledged to “mobilise” all of the stakeholders so FIFA and broadcasters could “quickly reach an agreement”.\nYesterday, Barcelona and Wolfsburg met in the Women’s Champions League final, but those clubs’ respective national teams (Spain and Germany) are set to enter a tournament where fans back home may not be able to watch their games.\nAdvertisement\nThis is the first Women’s World Cup in which commercial and television rights have been separated from the men’s tournament. For the first time, FIFA is offering individual agreements for the women’s tournament rather than deals being bundled up alongside the men’s one.\nGO DEEPER\nClub vs country tension looms ahead of WWC over player rest period\nThis new commercial strategy has shifted the way potential partners view the tournament, from seeing it as an under-valued added bonus to now a high-profile, prized property in its own right. This change feels like it’s come sharply, too: with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the footballing schedule and the global economy, women’s football is bearing the brunt of a plateauing and stubborn market.\nThis situation has impacted not only the TV rights negotiations but also sponsorship deals for the World Cup, which are still trickling through at this late stage. In the past week, snacks giant Frito-Lay was unveiled as a North American partner for the tournament in a deal the company said was its “largest-ever investment in women’s sports”. Meanwhile, Hyundai and Kia, two South Korean car companies, extended their partnerships with FIFA to the 2030 men’s World Cup. Commercial deals are at least being agreed, but the impasse over television rights continues to cause frustration.\nIn Germany, ZDF and ARD, the public-service broadcasters, have offered just three per cent of the amount they paid for the 2022 men’s World Cup for rights to the women’s tournament. Last summer there, a record audience of 18 million tuned in to watch Germany lose to England in the Women’s Euros final, and Germany head into this World Cup as one of the favourites.\nIt’s a similar scenario in France and Spain, where broadcasters have tabled offers that are worth less than five per cent of the sums paid for 2022 World Cup rights. In Italy, the bid is not even worth one per cent of the deal to show last winter’s tournament in Qatar.\nAdvertisement\nAnd TV rights aren’t the only issue still on the table less than seven weeks before the tournament’s first game…\nPlayer release dates\nLast month, FIFA and the European Club Association (ECA) reached an agreement on when players could leave their clubs to begin preparations for this summer’s World Cup, after tensions with national associations had threatened to derail some pre-tournament training camps.\nFIFA had originally given a mandatory international window start date of July 10 — 10 days before the World Cup kicks off. But, given that date is over a month after the majority of European clubs will have ended their seasons, many coaches and players were concerned about injury risk and the tight schedule heading into the tournament. Several federations, including England’s, had also planned for their squads to begin preparations in the middle of June.\nAfter discussions, the ECA and FIFA came to a compromise, opting to retain that mandatory date of July 10 but offering a new non-mandatory release period between June 23 and 29.\nIn a statement last month, the ECA said: “This new framework strikes the all-important balance between players having sufficient rest while allowing adequate time to prepare for the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023.\n“The new indicative timeframe should act as a guideline for clubs and participating member associations, with the exact dates of release to be agreed between them based on the individual circumstances of each case. Such efforts at mutual agreement are fully encouraged and endorsed by FIFA and ECA.”\nThere are still at least six other federations, besides England, trying to press ahead with national camps beginning before June 23. England’s plan is still to start their official preparation camp on June 19, four days earlier than the recommended window, but ECA member clubs are maintaining they will not release players early because of concerns over their welfare.\nAdvertisement\nEngland head coach Sarina Wiegman said this week that Bayern Munich are refusing to release midfielder Georgia Stanway before June 19. Wiegman is still hopeful there will be a resolution allowing her training camp to start with all players present on that originally scheduled date.\nLast month, The Athletic revealed that club chief executives have been contacted by the FA but no new agreement has yet been reached. England are meant to play a home friendly against Portugal on July 1 before flying to Australia four days later, but this is yet to be confirmed given the uncertainty around the players’ schedules.\nGO DEEPER\nAnswering your questions about the 2023 Women’s World Cup\nThere was an emergency meeting yesterday in the Dutch city of Eindhoven, before the Women’s Champions League final there, in an attempt to work towards resolving the subject. This was organised by the ECA and involved FA staff and representatives from those clubs with England players. There were no updates afterwards though and this promises to rumble on in the coming days.\nThat final, which Barcelona won 3-2 against Wolfsburg, officially signals the end of the women’s football season in Europe and the beginning of preparations for the World Cup.\nIn the next few weeks, with many players enjoying time off on holiday, the federations, clubs, broadcasters, FIFA and many other stakeholders will be under pressure to finalise plans for this spectacle. If they don’t, the cheerleading and the positive growth period the women’s game has been basking in might be taking a significant step backwards.\n(Top photo: Wagner Meier/Getty Images)\nFollow the Women’s World Cup coverage on The Athletic for related stories, news and more.",
