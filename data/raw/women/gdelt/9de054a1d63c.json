The BJP retained both, comprehensively, as the juggernaut of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah showed no sign of tiring, or retiring from their top perch on the power list.\nBut, for once, this juggernaut contended for some space with a march. Having finally paved the way for a non-family Congress president, Rahul Gandhi hit the road from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, walking 4,000-plus km over five months, seeking “Bharat Jodo”, and fighting the image of being a “non-serious entitled politician”.\nThe initial yatra energy evaporated by poll losses in the Northeast and a deep slide in Gujarat but his disqualification from the House and his stomach for a fight takes him from No. 51 to 15.\nAlong with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar, Rahul is the only non-ruling establishment name in the top 15 (barring Mukesh Ambani, that is). The fact that both outrank Gandhi is a reflection of the flux in the shrinking and challenged Opposition space, with regional parties refusing to cede primacy to the Congress. The Punjab win means Arvind Kejriwal remains in contention, but with corruption charges clouding his moral high ground and his No. 2 in custody, he is down seven ranks.\nWithin the top ranks composed interchangeably of government and Sangh Parivar bosses, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has surged to No. 3, ahead of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and BJP president JP Nadda. With G20 presidency and India’s foreign ties central to the Modi government’s 2024 campaign, Jaishankar is the muscular brain that fits the BJP bill just right.\nThe other BJP face with a sharp rise is Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, who zooms from No. 32 to 17, riding on both shrill Hindutva and skilled electioneering, powering the party in the Northeast. Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, an unknown till Modi picked him in 2021, has settled comfortably into his prominent portfolios, thus climbing 30 places to No. 19.\nStory continues below this ad\nMost new entrants are either players in the coming election-packed year, or those, like Mallikarjun Kharge and Eknath Shinde to Delhi L-G Vinai Kumar Saxena, who have seen a change in fortunes. On the other side of this spectrum is Gautam Adani, left poorer by several billion dollars and 26 ranks, to No. 33, by a report from a little-known short-selling firm.\nBollywood, the much-vaunted soft power, much-maligned for being too soft, comes in only at No. 50. Not surprisingly, it is in the form of Shah Rukh Khan, the Pathaan who did not crawl. The 57-year-old superstar is right back at the top, a year after his son’s arrest on drug charges that fell in court, having given the Indian film industry one of its biggest hits. That would be Rs 1,046 crore, and climbing. Yet, politics remains the grist to the power mill — especially as the countdown begins to Elections 2024.\n51) Bhupendra Patel, Chief Minister, Gujarat\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nStory continues below this ad\nBhupendra Patel was a surprise choice to replace Vijay Rupani as chief minister of Gujarat, home to both PM Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. The BJP retained Patel as the CM after its historic victory in the 2022 Assembly elections. As the head of Gujarat, Patel is a significant figure in Modi’s plans to make India a $5-trillion economy. Patel is also central to Modi and Shah’s ambition to have Gujarat host the Olympics in 2036, the planning for which has already begun.\nPower Punch\nWith Patel as the CM face, the BJP broke the Congress’s record tally of 149 Assembly seats and bagged 156 constituencies. The cherry on the cake was Patel’s victory from Ghatlodia constituency by 1.92 lakh votes, the highest margin in the state.\nWhat Next\nThe Lok Sabha elections in 2024 will be the next challenge for Patel. The party is eyeing a hattrick of winning all 26 parliamentary seats in the state that will definitely be a test of Patel’s mettle.\nBy the way\nPatel is fond of playing cricket and badminton. He loves having pav bhaji and fafda jalebi.\n52) Eknath Shinde, Chief Minister, Maharashtra\nRank last year: Not on list\nStory continues below this ad\nWhy\nAs Maharashtra chief minister, Eknath Shinde has managed to strike a delicate balance between governance and politics. The revolt that brought him to power dealt a massive blow to Uddhav Thackeray and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). For Shinde, keeping control of 50 MLAs despite their individual ambitions and aspirations during the coup proved his popularity among his colleagues. He has managed to emerge from the shadow of Uddhav Thackeray and carve out his own public identity.\nPower Punch\nLast July, Shinde successfully faced a trust vote, receiving 164 votes while the Opposition got 99. With some Congress and NCP members backing him by remaining absent from the vote, Shinde proved his political might.\nWhat Next\nThough he managed to gain control of the party by getting the support of a majority of its MLAs, MLCs and MPs, Shinde’s next test will be more difficult — gaining the acceptance of Shiv Sena workers at the grassroots.\nBy the way\nStory continues below this ad\nThe Maharashtra Chief Minister has a weakness for vada pav and misal pav from the famous Thane-based Mamledar Misal. He also enjoys farming in his village in Satara.\n53) Virat Kohli, cricketer\nRank last year: 80\nWhy\nVirat Kohli went 1,021 days without a century in any format before ending the drought in T20s. Recently, he scored three centuries in ODIs and a 186 against Australia in a Test match to signal a return to form in all three formats. Without the added pressure of captaincy, Kohli seems poised on the verge of a full-blown resurgence.\nPower Punch\nWhile he went more than three years without a century, Kohli remains one of the best batsmen in Test cricket, even in One Day Internationals, and one of the fittest players in world cricket. Known to speak his mind, he has talked about his struggles with mental health and backed teammate Mohammed Shami when the fast bowler faced communal abuse on social media after the loss to Pakistan in the T20 World Cup in 2021.\nWhat Next\nStory continues below this ad\nAt 34, Kohli still has plenty of cricket ahead of him, but the immediate target will be to help the team win the 50-over ODI World Cup to be held in India between October and November this year.\nBy the way\nKohli’s favourite food is chole bhature but he never compromises on his fitness. Even when he is not part of the team, he trains for at least two hours at the gym.\n54) Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India\nRank last year: 37\nWhy\nTushar Mehta is the Narendra Modi government’s trusted legal strategist. He appears on behalf of the Centre in virtually every political case, especially against Opposition-ruled state governments.\nPower Punch\nStory continues below this ad\nAfter the West Bengal elections in 2021, Mehta led the Centre’s charge against the Trinamool Congress in post-poll violence cases before the Calcutta High Court. The bitterly-contested High Court intervention led to an inquiry by the National Human Rights Commission. The rights body recommended a CBI probe in cases of rape and murder. Mehta also headed the Indian delegation at the United National Human Rights Council in its 41st Session of Universal Periodic Review in Geneva last November. He defended India’s position on Jammu and Kashmir and argued that civil society organisations are not under attack.\nWhat Next\nWith the Lok Sabha elections round the corner, Mehta, who represents Central investigative agencies, will be crucial in high-profile cases. After serving as Solicitor General for over five years, Mehta’s rise through the ranks will also be closely watched.\nBy the way\nAn Urdu poetry enthusiast, Mehta has a vast collection of books in the genre in his library\n55) Vinai Kumar Saxena, Lieutenant Governor, Delhi\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nStory continues below this ad\nThe relationship between the AAP government and Raj Niwas has soured further since Vinai Kumar Saxena was appointed\nL-G last May. The first non-bureaucrat to take over the post, the former chairperson of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission has consistently upped the ante against the Arvind Kejriwal government.\nPower Punch\nArmed with the Government of NCT of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, Saxena has ordered several inquiries into government departments. The most significant among these is a report on the formulation of the now-retracted Excise Policy that has put the AAP on the backfoot, with Kejriwal’s number two, former Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, arrested in the case.\nWhat Next\nWith the global image of Delhi in focus ahead of the G20 Summit in September, Saxena has put himself at the forefront of several infrastructure projects. The next big flashpoint between his\noffice and the CM is likely to be the power subsidies scheme.\nBy the way\nSaxena opened up the annual “At Home” gathering, held in January, to common people.\n56) BV Nagarathna, Judge, Supeme Court of India\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nIn 2027, Justice BV Nagarathna will make history as the first woman to take office as the Chief Justice of India. Although her tenure as CJI will last for just over a month, the move is hugely significant for a judiciary trying to be more inclusive and diverse.\nPower Punch\nIn her short stint in the Supreme Court, Justice Nagarathna has made her presence felt. Earlier this year, she penned a powerful dissent in the 4:1 verdict upholding the Centre’s demonetisation decision. Based on a clinical examination of records and the language in the minutes of meetings submitted by the government, Justice Nagarathna held that the RBI did not independently apply its mind in initiating the process. A day later, she wrote another dissenting opinion holding that statements made by ministers can be vicariously attributed to the government.\nWhat Next\nAs a judge in line to be CJI, Justice Nagarathna will be part of benches hearing several crucial cases, including the challenge to the electoral bonds scheme.\nBy the way\nIn 1996, her brother, Justice ES Indiresh, a sitting judge of the Karnataka High Court, began his practice as an advocate in her chamber.\n57) Sharad Pawar, President, Nationalist Congress Party\nRank last year:17\nWhy\nKnown for his astute political manoeuvrings, Pawar has always been at the centre of Maharashtra and national politics, springing surprises every now and then. Though last year Pawar failed to stop the fall of the coalition government of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) — an alliance between the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena, his own Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Indian National Congress (INC), in whose formation he had played an instrumental role — he is still one of the tallest Opposition leaders around. He will play a key role if the Opposition wants to unite against the BJP ahead of next year’s general elections.\nPower Punch\nBy fuelling Uddhav Thackeray’s ambition, Pawar got the NCP and the Congress back to power in 2019. His role in keeping the alliance together, even after it lost power, points to his skill as an expert negotiator and peacemaker.\nWhat Next\nWith the Congress weakened and Thackeray also on the backfoot after the split in the Sena, the NCP chief’s next big goal is to get his party to make deeper inroads in the state. Nationally, he is working to get like-minded Opposition parties together against the BJP.\nBy the way\nPawar is passionate about cricket and wrestling.\n58) YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, Chief Minister, Andhra Pradesh\nRank last year: 39\nWhy\nJagan Mohan Reddy remains one of the most popular leaders in Andhra Pradesh. Under his leadership, the state has launched several welfare schemes and benefits. Since coming to power in May 2019, the government has transferred Rs 3,19,227 crore to eligible beneficiaries. His government has also enacted sweeping reforms in school education.\nPower Punch\nReddy is now urging his party leaders and cadre to achieve “Mission 175”, aiming to win all 175 Assembly seats and electorally wipe out their rival — Telugu Desam Party (TDP). He made his intentions clear at a public meeting in Kuppam that is TDP chief and arch rival N Chandrababu Naidu’s constituency.\nWhat Next\nApart from balancing the state’s finances, burdened by the huge expenditure bill on welfare schemes, Jagan faces a challenge from actor-turned-politician K Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party (JSP). The TDP and the JSP may get tacit support from the BJP, making things difficult for Jagan.\nBy the way\nReddy will be shifting home to Visakhapatnam, the administrative capital of Andhra Pradesh.\n59) Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Education\nRank last year: 18\nWhy\nAmong the trusted lieutenants of the BJP leadership, Dharmendra Pradhan has led the government’s efforts to implement the National Education Policy, 2020, which has set in motion transformational changes in the school and higher education sector. He also holds the key Skill Development and Entrepreneurship portfolio.\nPower Punch\nAfter a successful stint at the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, which steers the Ujjwala Yojana, Pradhan was put in charge of the education ministry in July 2021. Since the BJP came to power in 2014, the ministry has been helmed by four ministers. Apart from the NEP, Pradhan oversaw the implementation of measures to mitigate learning losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWhat Next\nApart from his ministerial responsibilities, Pradhan is in charge of the BJP’s election efforts in Karnataka where polls are expected to be held in May. His stock in the party rose after he led its Uttar Pradesh Assembly election campaign in 2022.\nBy the way\nPradhan holds a Master’s Degree in Anthropology from Bhubaneswar’s Utkal University.\n60) Dattatreya Hosabale, General Secretary, RSS\nRank last year: 31\nWhy\nAs executive head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Dattatreya Hosabale will have a crucial role in mobilising cadres ahead of the 2024 general elections. Even as he continues to influence government policy, he is also expected to steer the organisation during its centenary year (2025).\nPower Punch\nWith his roots in the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), he has helped the RSS student organisation expand its footprint in the south. He has had a say in crucial appointments at key educational institutions and is believed to have considerable influence within the Yogi Adityanath government in UP. Hosabale is among the Sangh leaders who is said to be close to the Prime Minister and one whose opinion the PM respects.\nWhat Next\nUnder him, the RSS has launched a programme to promote entrepreneurship in the hinterland and push the Modi government’s atmanirbhar ambitions.\nBy the way\nHosabale is fluent in Kannada, Hindi, English, Tamil, and Sanskrit. He has a Master’s in English literature from Bengaluru University.\n61) Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Chief Minister, Madhya Pradesh\nRank last year: 40\nWhy\nShivraj Singh Chouhan is the longest-serving Chief Minister in the BJP’s ranks at present. Despite anti-incumbency and alleged voter fatigue, he remains the most formidable Other Backward Classes (OBC) leader in a faction-ridden BJP unit in the state. Although there have been talks of a change of guard in the state, the BJP still has not been able to find a replacement for Chouhan.\nPower Punch\nDespite vehement opposition, including from the RSS, Chouhan gave a six-month extension to his trusted bureaucrat and Chief Secretary Iqbal Singh Bains last November, hours before his retirement. This showed Chouhan was still the last word on administrative appointments.\nWhat Next\nWith a change of guard almost ruled out, Chouhan is likely to lead the BJP in the state election later this year.\nBy the way\nChouhan’s pet, Nick, a German Shepherd, died earlier this year. The CM, who was deeply attached to the 14-year-old dog, dug a grave for him on the premises of his official residence.\n62) Ashok Gehlot, Chief Minister, Rajasthan\nRank last year: 34\nWhy\nHe is one of the only three chief ministers of Congress-ruled states. In his third term, Ashok Gehlot has been the tallest face of the Congress in Rajasthan since he first became the CM in 1998.\nIn his present term, Gehlot has taken important decisions such as bringing back the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) for state employees. Despite the Congress high command’s desire to see him contest the elections for the party’s national president, Gehlot managed to hold on to the CM post.\nPower Punch\nDespite a long-standing tussle with former Deputy CM Sachin Pilot, Gehlot successfully prevented a change of guard in 2020 when Pilot and his loyalists rebelled against him. Under him, the Congress has won successive by-elections. Gehlot has also captured attention with his government’s public welfare schemes, including a universal health insurance scheme.\nWhat Next\nGehlot’s biggest challenge is the Assembly election in December, when he will be looking to retain power for a fourth term.\nBy the way\nGehlot is known as the jaadugar (magician), a term he often uses for himself. His father was a professional magician and Gehlot pays tribute to his roots by invoking it.\n63) Manohar Lal Khattar, Chief Minister, Haryana\nRank last year: 43\nWhy\nManohar Lal Khattar’s tenure as chief minister has been marked by efforts to redefine governance in Haryana and bring the administration to people’s doorsteps. The Chief Minister’s popularity rests on his administration’s\ngovernance track record. Under his leadership, the BJP returned to power in 2019, though with a reduced tally and in alliance with the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP). Khattar’s government has come up with some novel ideas, including educated panchayats, some of which the Centre has recommended to other states as well.\nPower Punch\nKhattar has faced criticism over the lack of jobs and price rise but has firmly stood his ground and persisted with his development agenda to place Haryana in a high-growth trajectory.\nWhat Next\nWith the general elections approaching in 2024, his challenge will be to consolidate the BJP’s popularity in the state and return to power for a third straight term, based on his own administrative strength.\nBy the way\nKhattar is fond of gardening and maintains a kitchen garden at his residence.\n64) Hemant Soren, Chief Minister, Jharkhand\nRank last year: 67\nWhy\nHemant Soren has been successfully running a coalition government in a state where the political situation is often in a flux. A reluctant politician who took the reins under the tutelage of his father Shibu Soren, known as Guruji, Soren has been able to shed the image of being “Guruji’s son”. A vocal Adivasi leader, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) chief was among the political leaders who managed the Covid-19 pandemic efficiently in the state.\nPower Punch\nAfter getting embroiled in a mining lease controversy, Soren used government programmes to reach out to Adivasis, OBCs, and Dalits to counter the BJP’s attempts to corner him. His government also approved a Bill that defines a local with 1932 as a cut-off for domicile — a decision similar to the one that had cost Jharkhand’s first CM, Babulal Marandi, his job.\nWhat Next\nSoren’s challenge will be to lead the UPA to victory next year in most of Jharkhand’s 14 Lok Sabha seats, something it has not been able to do since the Modi wave swept in in 2014. A bigger challenge will be the anti-incumbency during the Assembly elections in 2024.\nBy the way\nSoren loves simple food and is an avid badminton player.\n65) Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, AICC general secretary in charge of UP\nRank last year: 75\nWhy\nPriyanka Gandhi Vadra is a key member of the Nehru-Gandhi family troika that calls the shots in the grand old party. A member of the Congress Working Committee and All India Congress Committee general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, she plays a big role in shaping the party’s policies, charting the organisational roadmap and crisis management along with her mother Sonia and brother Rahul. Known as the conscience keeper of her mother, she and her brother are often said to take unilateral decisions in the party.\nPower Punch\nSensing that the Congress had a chance of winning in Himachal Pradesh, she led the Assembly election campaign from the front and successfully ended the party’s electoral drought.\nWhat Next\nWith Sonia Gandhi in semi-retirement mode, all eyes are on whether Priyanka will make her electoral debut from Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha elections. The other formulation is her contesting from Amethi and Rahul switching to Rae Bareli.\nBy the way\nShe is an avid cook and baker. She is also working on her memoir.\n66) Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Minister, Jal Shakti\nRank last year: 41\nWhy\nGajendra Singh Shekhawat, a two-term Lok Sabha member, is tasked with steering the Narendra Modi government’s three ambitious schemes — Jal Jeevan Mission, the interlinking of rivers, and Namami Gange. The Jal Jeevan Mission is particularly significant as its outcome and impact may be a crucial factor in the 2024 general elections.\nPower Punch\nShekhawat is among the few ministers who were not moved during the mid-term reshuffle in the Modi cabinet in 2021. His continuity has yielded results, with the number of families getting piped water supply in rural areas increasing to over 11 crore from about 3.23 crore just before the launch of the Jal Jeevan Mission in 2019.\nWhat Next\nThe big challenge now is to push the project to interlink rivers. Besides, his home state Rajasthan will go to polls later this year and the outcome will be important for his political trajectory.\nBy the way\nShekhawat keeps himself updated about his ministry’s projects in real time. He also loves mirchi bada, a famous street food from his hometown Jodhpur.\n67) Basavaraj Bommai, Chief Minister, Karnataka\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nBasavaraj Bommai is the BJP’s face for the coming Assembly polls in Karnataka. Given that he heads its election campaign management committee, he is crucial to the party’s efforts to retain the only southern state where it has managed to come to power. With his government facing corruption allegations, Bommai has tried to counter it by focussing on the work done by his administration. He has travelled extensively in the state in the last two years to launch or highlight government schemes, including irrigation and domestic water supply.\nPower Punch\nBommai has remained at the helm even though his party and government have dealt with one controversy after another — from the hijab row to the halal meat controversy to corruption allegations levelled by contractors. The CM has proved adept at handling difficult situations.\nWhat Next\nThere have been signs of the BJP leadership losing its patience with Bommai even as internal battles have begun over poll tickets. The CM has the task of ensuring the party overcomes these bumps in the road and retains power.\nBy the way\nA mechanical engineer by qualification, Bommai is a former Tata Motors employee.\n68) Bhagwant Mann, Chief Minister, Punjab\nRank last year: 61\nWhy\nAs Punjab’s Chief Minister, Bhagwant Mann is in charge of law and order in a crucial border state. As the Amritpal Singh episode has shown, his handling of the security situation will be crucial to Punjab’s stability and will have a bearing on national security. Last year, Mann ran a high-octane campaign during the Assembly polls and brought the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to power with a tally of 92 of\n117 seats.\nPower Punch\nLast May, within two months of coming to power, Mann sacked Health Minister Vijay Singla on charges of corruption.\nWhat Next\nHis challenge is to dispel the perception that the AAP leadership in Delhi is controlling Punjab. Lately, the CM has been asserting himself, conveying the message to bureaucracy and people that he is no pushover. The party will also face tough tests in the local body elections and the Jalandhar Lok Sabha bypoll, whose dates have not yet been announced.\nBy the way\nWhenever he gets time in the morning, Mann plays volleyball with his security guards.\n69) Azim Premji, Founder chairman, Wipro\nRank last year: 60\nWhy\nHe is not just one of the foremost pioneers of the information technology industry, Azim Premji is also an exemplary philanthropist, often described as India’s Bill Gates. Having passed on the reins of his group to son Rishad, Premji continues to be an influential business and thought leader in India and beyond.\nPower Punch\nOver the past few years, he has been instrumental in providing funding worth thousands of crores to his philanthropic initiatives through the buyback of Wipro shares. Bill Gates said that he was “inspired by Azim Premji’s continued commitment to philanthropy” after the latter announced in 2019 that he was donating $7.5 billion worth of Wipro shares to the Azim Premji Foundation — taking his total contribution to the foundation’s endowment corpus to $21 billion.\nWhat Next\nThe Azim Premji Foundation recently announced that in addition to education, it will now focus on healthcare for the poor and marginalised by setting up primary health clinics, followed by multi-speciality hospitals and even a medical university in the country.\nBy the way\nPremji avoids staying in five-star hotels; he travels economy and chooses made-in-India brands.\n70) General Anil Chauhan, Chief of Defence Staff\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nGeneral Anil Chauhan took over as India’s second Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) nearly a year after India’s first CDS General Bipin Rawat died in a helicopter crash. Having retired from the Army as the Eastern Army Commander, he was then serving as a military advisor in the National Security Council Secretariat. With a distinguished career of over 40 years, he has had extensive experience in counter-insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast.\nPower Punch\nThe fact that the government chose to keep on hold the appointment of a CDS for almost a year before announcing General Chauhan’s name for the position is reflective of what the top officer brings to the table. Known to be a quiet worker, General Chauhan will drive several planned changes in the Armed Forces.\nWhat Next\nHe is responsible for prioritising important procurements for the Armed Forces based on a larger vision for the military, including manpower optimisation.\nBy the way\nHe takes an active interest in golf.\n71) General Manoj Pande, Chief of the Army Staff\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nA decorated Army general with nearly four decades of experience, General Manoj Pande is the first Army chief from the Corps of Engineers, a position which was typically held by officers from combat arms. Gen Pande has served along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) facing China and the Line of Control (LoC) opposite Pakistan. He has also been the Commander-in-Chief of the tri-service Andaman and Nicobar Command.\nPower Punch\nHis vast experience, at various military theatres and in the Army headquarters, will aid in the changes in the Indian military. This includes a transformation into theatre commands, a reorientation to focus on China, a new recruitment of soldiers under the Agnipath scheme and right-sizing of the Army.\nWhat Next\nKnown for his active interest in pushing innovation and technology infusion in the Army, he will be driving the Army towards further modernisation to keep pace with the evolving ways of warfare.\nBy the way\nHe is a good singer. His son is an officer in the IAF.\n72) Rajiv Kumar, Chief Election Commissioner\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nAs Chief Election Commissioner, Rajiv Kumar is set to oversee the 2024 general elections while pushing for electoral reforms. Under him, the Election Commission has proposed allowing remote voting for migrant workers and reducing the limit for disclosure of donations from Rs 20,000 to Rs 2,000 each. The former Finance Secretary was also instrumental in the EC’s drive to de-list many unrecognised political parties that are believed to be using Income Tax exemptions for money laundering or non-political purposes.\nPower Punch\nHe is known to respond swiftly to statements by political figures, whether it be Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav’s claim that Muslim and Dalit voters were struck off the rolls in UP or the YSRCP, which had reportedly elected YS Jagan Mohan Reddy for life.\nWhat Next\nBoth Kumar and Law Minister Kiren Rijiju have hinted that several electoral reforms may be in the offing. It remains to be seen if they include remote voting.\nBy the way\nAn avid trekker, Kumar has trekked across Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Tibet. In fact, he trekked to a remote polling station in Uttarakhand in 2022 along with election officials.\n73) PK Mishra, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister\nRank last year: 65\nWhy\nBe it bureaucratic appointments, policy logjams or ensuring seamless coordination among various departments to achieve government objectives, PK Mishra’s is one of the key voices in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).\nPower Punch\nKnown to enjoy the complete trust of Prime Minister Modi, the retired Gujarat cadre IAS officer is practically the filter through which most bureaucratic decisions pass through. He will be monitoring the implementation of policies in various sectors as he believes that “ultimately, whatever policy we may frame, it comes back to how it is implemented on the ground – at the district and village levels.” This is very important in executing the welfarist agenda of the central government.\nWhat Next\nWith just a year to go for the general elections, Mishra will be playing a key role in pushing the bureaucracy on the government’s agenda on key issues of growth, employment generation and welfare programmes.\nBy the way\nMishra is one of the government’s foremost experts on disaster management. In fact, it was because of his swift response to the Gujarat earthquake that he caught Modi’s attention.\n74) Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Minister of State for Electronics and IT\nRank last year: 63\nWhy\nRajeev Chandrasekhar has been instrumental in preparing drafts of key legislations like the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022 and National Data Governance Framework. He’s also played a key role in conceptualising a programme on India’s semiconductor manufacturing push.\nPower Punch\nConsidered to be very accessible, Chandrasekhar has been a vital link between the government and industry. He has facilitated and chaired a number of meetings on several regulations and policies with representatives from both sides of the divide. He pioneered a key provision that allows for setting up government-appointed appellate committees for users of social media entities.\nWhat Next\nThe key challenge is to finalise crucial legislations such as the draft Digital India Bill and the Data Protection Bill, which can significantly change the internet ecosystem in India and impact big digital businesses.\nBy the way\nThere’s a digital clock in his office, showing the number of days he has left in his current term, a reminder of how many targets that he has set for himself and needs to complete by 2024.\n75) Bimal Patel, Architect, MD, HCP\nRank last year: 57\nWhy\nBimal Patel’s firm is handling important public projects, including the Central Vista revamp in New Delhi, transforming the overall landscape of the 2-km Kartavya Path from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhavan, and the new Parliament building. It has also started work on the Rs 1,200- crore Sabarmati Ashram Redevelopment Project in Ahmedabad and completed the first phase of the Kashi Vishwanath\ncorridor in record time.\nPower Punch\nWhile critics called the Sabarmati Ashram project “Disneyfication”, Patel was able to get all the stakeholders on board. Similarly, the Supreme Court cleared the Central Vista Redevelopment last year after it was challenged there.\nWhat Next\nPatel has been roped in for the Master Plan of the Somnath temple in Gujarat. Other prominent projects include the Mumbai Port Complex Masterplan and the Pune Riverfront Development project.\nBy the way\nHe is writing a book on reforming urban planning in India, which, he says, “engages his intellect and creativity without having to collaborate or negotiate with\nother people”.\n76) Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman, Aditya Birla Group\nRank last year: 77\nWhy\nWith strategic investments and acquisitions, Kumar Mangalam Birla has increased the turnover of the Aditya Birla Group by well over 30 times to $60 billion. It has operations in 36 countries across North and South America, Africa, Asia and Europe. He was ranked as the ninth-richest Indian and 106th globally by Forbes in 2022.\nPower Punch\nIn February, the Union government cleared a long-awaited plan to convert Vodafone Idea’s interest dues worth more than Rs 16,000 crore (or $2 billion) into equity, paving the way for him to become the single largest shareholder in the cash-strapped telecom company.\nWhat Next\nThe key challenge for Birla would be to expand the Vodafone Idea’s 5G coverage since both its rivals, Jio and Airtel, have stolen a march over it in terms of 5G deployment. Finding investors to inject capital into the troubled telco would also be a priority. Future-proofing the business, Birla’s three children have joined the boards of group companies.\nBy the way\nHe enjoys pistol shooting.\n77) Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Congress leader in Lok Sabha\nRank last year: 73\nWhy\nIf the much depleted Congress punches above its weight in the Lok Sabha, it is largely because of Chowdhury’s firepower. As the party’s leader in the Lok Sabha, he is the Opposition’s voice in high-powered committees headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which select the CBI Director, Central Vigilance Commissioner, Chief Information Commissioner, Chairman and members of the NHRC and the Lokpal. A loyalist of the Nehru-Gandhi family, Chowdhury is president of the West Bengal Congress, member of the Congress Working Committee and chairman of the all-important Public Accounts Committee of Parliament.\nPower Punch\nChowdhury led the Congress to victory in the Sagardighi Assembly by-election, a blow to Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Mamata Banerjee. What Next With the expected organisational reshuffle in the Congress, the big question is if he will be able to hold on to key party positions.\nBy the way\nHe is deeply interested in football and cricket and never misses the sports pages in newspapers.\n78) Shashi Tharoor, Congress leader, author\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nAn erudite politician, his standing within and outside the Congress rose after he decided to contest the party’s presidential election against the leadership-endorsed candidate Mallikarjun Kharge on his own steam. Tharoor proved that he is not a pushover and that there is more to him than being a suave and articulate Lok Sabha MP with an influential social-media presence and a gift of words. His ideas to revive the Congress found such resonance that the Congress high command will find it difficult to disregard him from now on.\nPower Punch\nHe was always the underdog but Tharoor managed to garner more votes than heavyweights Sharad Pawar and Rajesh Pilot did when they contested the Congress presidential election in 1997 and Jitendra Prasada, when he pitted himself against Sonia Gandhi in 2000.\nWhat Next\nHis increased engagements and political activities in Kerala have shaken and stirred Congress politics there.\nBy the way\nA cricket buff, Tharoor catches up on highlights of cricket matches while on the treadmill.\n79) Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, Chief Minister, Himachal Pradesh\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nHe worked his way up in the party and helped the Congress win a tightly contested election in Himachal Pradesh. With more than one party aspirant for the chief ministerial chair, Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu got the support of most MLAs. Despite intra-party rumblings, he stood by his commitment to development and public welfare.\nPower Punch\nHe kept his promise of re-introducing the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) besides other social welfare policies. Sukhu has effectively sent out a message of strong leadership that will not bow down to pressure.\nWhat Next\nHe will be keenly watched for the kind of fiscal roadmap he draws up to implement schemes such as OPS and offer cash assistance to women. With the general elections approaching, the Congress will be looking to consolidate its hold in states it is in power.\nBy the way\nSukhu is a patron of cricket. In friendly matches, he is known to be an all-rounder.\n80) Vasundhara Raje, Former Chief minister, Rajasthan\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nThe two-time former chief minister remains the BJP’s tallest leader in Rajasthan. Although she has been challenged by multiple leaders in her own party, Vasundhara Raje, who is now her party’s national vice-president, has demonstrated that she is the best bet to bring it back to power. In 2013, the BJP got 163 seats in the 200-member Assembly, a record that still holds.\nPower Punch\nShe has made herself relevant with her MLA supporters and outfits like the Vasundhara Raje Samarthak Manch campaigning that she be the BJP’s face in the state. Her rally this month, that tied with her birthday on March 8, was a show of great strength. Even BJP president JP Nadda reiterates the achievements of her previous two terms in party meetings while visiting the state.\nWhat Next\nRaje is hoping to be a chief ministerial candidate in the next round of Assembly elections. Question is can she inch past BJP state president Satish Poonia and Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in the race?\nBy the way\nRaje is known to start all her election yatras after praying at the Charbhuja temple in Rajasthan’s Rajsamand district.\n81) M Jagadesh Kumar, Chairperson , University Grants Commission\nRank last year: 89\nWhy\nAn acclaimed name in nanotechnology, Kumar, who hit headlines during his tumultuous tenure as vice-chancellor of the Jawaharlal Nehru University between 2016 and 2022, is one of the most influential voices in the higher education sector as chairperson of the University Grants Commission (UGC).\nPower Punch\nOver the last year, the UGC, led by Kumar, has been implementing major recommendations of the National Education Policy 2020, including the Common University Entrance Test (CUET) , regulations to allow foreign universities into India and IITs to expand abroad.\nWhat Next\nThe power corridors are already abuzz with speculation that Kumar is tipped to be the first chief of the proposed Higher Education Commission of India (HECI), which will subsume the UGC and AICTE, which is also envisaged in the NEP, 2020.\nBy the way\nA fitness freak, Kumar is an avid cyclist, so much so that in 2013, he had published a paper in the reputed journal IETE Technical Review on the benefits of cycling.\n82) Asaduddin Owaisi, President, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM)\nRank last year: 62\nWhy\nAsaduddin Owaisi has emerged as the most influential Muslim leader and, in the absence of a cogent Opposition, is building a pan-India appeal. His party has branched out into other states and notched up wins in the Assembly and local bodies elections. He remains the undisputed leader of the AIMIM and undefeated in the Hyderabad Lok Sabha constituency.\nPower Punch\nUnder Owaisi’s leadership, the party has entered the electoral fray in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, UP, Bihar and Tamil Nadu. It has won the Aurangabad Lok Sabha seat in Maharashtra, five Assembly seats in Bihar and two in Maharashtra. However, what’s significant is the way AIMIM has made inroads into local bodies, winning ward seats in Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and the municipalities of Modasa, Godhra and Bharuch in Gujarat.\nWhat Next\nWith Owaisi strengthening the AIMIM at the grassroots level, it will be part of the alliance of like-minded parties as proposed by Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao for 2024.\nBy the way\nOwaisi is very active on social media, issuing statements including strong counters to the PM and other BJP leaders\n83) Rohit Sharma, India cricket captain\nRank last year: 69\nWhy\nUnder Rohit Sharma’s leadership, the Indian team was ranked No.1 in all formats of the game. Having led the team to the semifinals of the T20 World Cup in Australia in 2022, he is the most successful IPL captain till date and remains one of the game’s most flamboyant openers. He is adept at adjusting to the requirements of various formats, situations and conditions. Be it grooming youngsters and giving a long rope to experienced players, Sharma has brought stability and a sense of security among players.\nPower Punch\nUnder his captaincy, Mumbai Indians have become the most dominant IPL franchise and have provided Indian cricket with stars such as Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya. His first major achievement has been booking a final spot in the World Test Championship. He has the backing of top BCCI officials and selectors and has a say in the selection of players. He stood by his predecessor Virat Kohli through the latter’s lean phase.\nWhat Next\nSharma has a chance to win the ICC Test Championship title in June and lift the 50-over World Cup on home soil later this year. This would end India’s decade-long drought of major ICC titles since 2013.\nBy the way\nHis favourite food is dal chawal. He is a fan of the web series Entourage.\n84) Akhilesh Yadav, Samajwadi Party (SP) President\nRank last year: 56\nWhy\nWith Lok Sabha elections next year, Akhilesh Yadav is all set to be the Opposition’s face in Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 Lok Sabha seats that can tilt the outcome.\nPower Punch\nDespite being defeated in the Assembly elections in 2022, Yadav took the bold step of giving up his parliamentary seat of Azamgarh to become the Leader of Opposition in the Vidhan Sabha — a message to the SP cadre that he was willing to take on Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in the House. After the death of party patron and father Mulayam Singh Yadav, he made peace with estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav, who is expected to play a crucial role in rejuvenating the cadre base at the grassroots.\nHe even met Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee, hoping to form a front of regional parties to take on the BJP in 2024. He believes in equidistancing himself from both the BJP and the Congress and focussing on reclaiming his lost voter base.\nWhat Next\nThe SP hopes to launch a spirited campaign for a caste census and hopes it resonates with voters in a state where caste politics continues to be a decider.\nBy the way\nHe has a deep interest in plants and can identify many species.\n85) Dr Prathap C Reddy, Founder-chairman, Apollo Hospitals\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nHe had the first-mover advantage when he decided to set up a private healthcare chain in 1983. Since then, he has built a chain of hospitals to make international quality healthcare accessible, a template followed by other hospital chains. Dr Reddy used technology to take healthcare to remote areas, beginning with the world’s first V-SAT-enabled remote village in Andhra Pradesh. And just when others got into the game, he extended his business to the hinterland, taking high-quality healthcare to semi-urban and rural geographies.\nPower Punch\nAs a cardiologist, he realised that Indians are more prone to heart diseases compared to other Asians. His Billion Hearts Beating Foundation envisages a module for Indians to stay heart-healthy. Apollo 24X7 clinics and drug stores are now in every neighbourhood.\nWhat Next\nThe group will be using Artificial Intelligence in a big way and launch AI-based personal health management programmes.\nBy the Way\nHe loves horses and is seen at the Madras Race Club during racing season.\n86) Nandan Nilekani, Non-executive Chairman, Infosys\nRank last year: 87\nWhy\nNandan Nilekani, who co-founded Infosys in 1981, has successfully executed projects both in the public and private sectors. In 2009, he became Chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India and was instrumental in the roll-out of Aadhaar.\nPower Punch\nFrom Aadhaar, eKYC, eSignatures, DigiLocker, UPI, to the new digital public infrastructure like the Account Aggregator system, Nilekani has been advocating technology-based governance delivery systems. The government has sought him out to deliver several initiatives under the Digital India scheme.\nWhat Next\nNilekani has evangelised the Beckn protocol, which is an open source protocol to enable decentralised digital commerce and is at the backend of the Centre-backed Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), which is being developed as an alternative to the duopoly of Amazon and Flipkart in India’s e-commerce market. His challenge will be to scale ONDC, dubbed as the e-commerce moment of UPI.\nBy the way\nHe got his first smartphone at 55.\n87) Amitabh Bachchan, actor\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nThe ‘OG’ of Indian cinema had multiple screen outings last year. Prominent among them were Jhund, Brahmastra and Uunchai. They received both commercial and critical successes reiterating the fact that Bachchan remains a crowd-puller nearly 50 years since he grabbed public attention as ‘the angry young man’.\nPower Punch\nBachchan rarely speaks at public forums on contemporary issues but when he does, people sit up and take notice. When he spoke at the inauguration ceremony of the 28th Kolkata International Film Festival in December, it drew much appreciation and began conversations around free speech. Speaking about Indian cinema’s tryst with censorship, he said that “questions are being raised on civil liberties and freedom of expression.”\nWhat Next\nThe veteran actor, who is currently nursing an injury suffered during the shooting of Project K, has been working on a bunch of interesting projects. He will be seen next in Ganapath, Taalismaan and Ghoomer.\nBy the way\nHe eats only vegetarian food, and has given up sweets, rice and paan.\n88) Mehbooba Mufti, J&K Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief\nRank last year: 79\nWhy\nEven as most Kashmir-based parties are going through a lean phase, and with most of PDP’s own top leaders gravitating towards pro-New Delhi parties, Mehbooba Mufti is emerging as the lone voice of dissent against the Centre’s Kashmir policy. From bigger issues like the abrogation of Article 370 to local issues like corruption and demolition drives, she reflects the concerns of common Kashmiris that has helped her grow in stature.\nPower Punch\nShe doesn’t hesitate to take up controversial issues on which most of the Valley’s mainstream political leaders have remained silent. Recently, she visited the Navagraha temple in Poonch and offered water to the shivling there, proudly claiming she was acting as a citizen of a nation that follows “Ganga Jamuni tehzeeb” and that religion was a deeply personal matter — chastising zealots on both sides in the process.\nWhat Next\nWith Assembly elections expected any time this year, the biggest challenge for Mufti is to revive her party that has seen a vertical split, find credible leaders to replace the defectors and prove that she is still worthy of a fight.\nBy the way\nWith four cats at home, Mehbooba Mufti is a keen follower of cat reels on Instagram.\n89) Farooq Abdullah, president, J&K National Conference\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nThe National Conference (NC) president may be at the fag end of his career but as a traditional political leader, he is still seen as the voice of Kashmiris, one which he is careful to nurture and champion. This is why he has cobbled an alliance with other mainstream political parties in the Valley, including NC’s arch rival, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\nPower Punch\nAt 85, when most political leaders retire from public life, Abdullah is still a charismatic leader, who can draw crowds. While his son Omar Abdullah is waiting in the wings, it is the patriarch who dictates terms in the NC.\nWhat Next\nAbdullah has stitched up an alliance — People’s Alliance For Gupkar Declaration — to challenge the BJP electorally but it would be tough for him to keep the alliance intact till the Assembly elections, which the Centre says are around the corner. While he pledged that the all-party front would contest elections jointly, dissent came from his own party. Can he counter the BJP narrative and wrest political power?\nBy the way\nHis favourite dish is marchawangun qorma (mirchi qorma), a delicacy in Kashmiri wazwan.\n90) TV Somanathan, Finance and Expenditure Secretary\nRank last year: 76\nWhy\nAs the seniormost secretary among the five secretaries in the Finance Ministry, Somanathan is one of the most influential of bureaucrats. He has been instrumental in the government’s continued push for capital expenditure to incentivise growth and reforms in public sector enterprises. He has quietly pushed policy changes that ensured elimination of hidden subsidies and efficiency in expenditure management. This has restored credibility in budget estimates. Somanathan has helped design a number of PLI (Productivity-Linked Incentive) schemes.\nPower Punch\nWith the intent of sticking to fiscal consolidation and keeping the growth momentum intact, he has kept a tab on expenditure and shunned fiscal profligacy in the Budget despite it being a pre-election year.\nWhat Next\nWith the global slowdown expected to have a spillover effect, through weak export and consumption demand amid a high interest rate cycle, he will have to do a balancing act of sticking to fiscal targets and undertake more spending to push the economy towards a higher growth path.\nBy the way\nHe’s an avid tennis player but Covid restrictions halted his visits to sports facilities. He is yet to resume his games.\n91) Sajjan Jindal, Chairman, JSW Group\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nSteel magnate Sajjan Jindal started his career in 1982 by looking after the steel manufacturing of the OP Jindal Group in the western region. He is now heading JSW Steel – the country’s largest steel player — beating a Goliath called Tata Steel. JSW Steel is the flagship business of the diversified $22 billion JSW Group.\nPower Punch\nUnder Jindal’s stewardship, the JSW Group has expanded to different core sectors of the economy, such as steel, power, infrastructure-building and cement. The group runs some of the most energy-efficient and eco-friendly manufacturing facilities in the country. He was the first to introduce the Corex technology instead of a blast furnace to produce hot metal in India.\nWhat Next\nOver the last three decades, JSW Steel has grown from a single manufacturing unit to become the country’s leading integrated steel company with a capacity of 27 MTPA. Jindal’s next phase of growth is to take JSW Steel’s total capacity to 37 MTPA by FY25. JSW Energy Limited is building a significant renewable energy portfolio.\nBy the way\nA fitness enthusiast, he is known to have done a dead lift of 110 kg at the gym.\n92) V Anantha Nageswaran, Chief Economic Adviser (CEA)\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nHolding a doctoral degree from the University of Massachusetts, Nageswaran has donned many roles as an economist, author, teacher and consultant. As CEA, he plays a key role in bringing out the Economic Survey, which he calls the master document to take stock of the economy.\nPower Punch\nHis appointment as CEA came just two days before the presentation of the Economic Survey on January 31 last year. He had earlier been a part-time member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister between 2019 and 2021.\nWhat Next\nWith some developed nations witnessing a banking crisis in the making, he has his task cut out for persisting with capital expenditure and reforms for India amid growing external headwinds.\nBy the way\nHe has co-authored four books on topics ranging from the rise of financialisation to derivatives. Two of these books were co-authored with his now Finance Ministry colleague, Finance Secretary TV Somanathan.\n93) Pushkar Singh Dhami, Chief Minister, Uttarakhand\nRank last year: 84\nWhy\nEven after losing to Congress candidate Bhuwan Chandra Kapri from the Khatima seat in the 2022 Assembly elections, Pushkar Singh Dhami got re-elected as the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand with the BJP winning 47 seats in the 70-member House. Clearly his non-controversial image, unlike that of his predecessors, held him in good stead among the BJP top leadership.\nPower Punch\nDespite being attacked by the Opposition on irregularities in recruitment exams to state services, the Ankita Bhandari murder case and the messy handling of the Joshimath land subsidence in his second term, Dhami made up with some quick corrective action in all these issues.\nWhat Next\nWith Joshimath residents in need of large-scale relocation, Dhami will be facing a major challenge in the next few months. With similar reports of land slips in other parts of the state too, a successful Chardham yatra will be another major challenge. Dhami’s test is in balancing ecology with development.\nBy the way\nDhami is a good cricket and badminton player.\n94) Suman Bery, Vice Chairperson, Niti Aayog\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nHaving had a decade-long career across multiple sectors, Suman Bery brings a wide range of insights to the government think-tank on policy issues. A former director-general of the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), he has served as a member of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, the Reserve Bank of India’s Technical Advisory Committee and the National Statistical Commission.\nPower Punch\nBery left the World Bank when India’s economy opened up following liberalisation in 1991 and as a special consultant to the RBI between 1992 and 1994, advised its officials on financial sector policy, institutional reform, market development and regulations.\nWhat Next\nBery is in the thick of things at NITI Aayog at a time when the relationship between the Centre and Opposition-ruled state governments has soured. Given that the Aayog has, in the past, been an advocate of increased private-sector participation, Bery will have to play a balancing act to ensure that states are on board for the Centre’s privatisation measures.\nBy the way\nHe is a food and wine connoisseur.\n95) SS Rajamouli, Filmmaker\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nThe global success of RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt), which won the 2023 Academy Award for Best Original Song, has not only made SS Rajamouli one of the country’s most prominent filmmakers, it has also pushed Brand India in the global pop-culture space. Legitimising Indian sensibility and an epic scale, it has spurred speculation that he could even direct a venture in the Marvel multiverse.\nPower Punch\nAlthough RRR was snubbed as India’s official selection for the Oscars, Rajamouli pushed it for nomination in 14 categories. Eventually, the film’s song, Naatu Naatu, bagged the Oscar entry for Best Original Song. He also picked up multiple international awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Song, five Hollywood Critics Association Awards and two Critics’ Choice Movie Awards.\nWhat Next\nRajamouli’s next, titled SSMB29, is an ambitious action-adventure film along the lines of Indiana Jones with Mahesh Babu in the lead. A sequel to RRR is on the cards. And, with the kind of attention he has got, may be a film with a Hollywood studio.\nBy the way\nBen Hur is Rajamouli’s all-time favourite film and he has watched it more than 20 times.\n96) Fali Nariman, Constitutional jurist\nRank last year: 81\nWhy\nDespite the fewer appearances in courtrooms, Fali Nariman is still regarded as the conscience-keeper of the judiciary. At a time when the executive and judiciary are at loggerheads over judicial appointments and the application of the basic structure doctrine to strike down executive action, Nariman is a trusted voice of reason.\nPower Punch\nNariman is appearing in the case challenging the practice of excommunication in the Dawoodi Bohra community. He has also been persistent with his argument that “courts are empowered under our Constitution to invalidate not only executive orders, but also legislative enactments that violate any part of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution (Bill of Rights).”\nWhat Next\nGiven his experience, Nariman’s informed views will be crucial in shaping conversations, both inside and outside\nthe courtroom.\nBy the way\nNariman and his family walked from Burma to the Indian border during World War II, to escape Japanese occupation of Burma.\n97) Deepika Padukone, Actor, producer, entrepreneur, brand ambassador\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nWith the huge success of Pathaan, the top-grossing Hindi film of all time, and Hollywood courting her, Deepika Padukone has emerged as a bonafide action star. She is currently the global ambassador for luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Levi’s and Adidas. She also turned producer in 2020 and co-founded self-care brand 82°E, besides creating mental-health awareness through her foundation.\nPower Punch\nPadukone has had her best international exposure yet. She was jury member at the 75th Cannes Film Festival and unveiled the golden FIFA World Cup trophy in Qatar. But it was as an Oscar presenter, introducing the award-winning song Naatu Naatu, that she won millions of hearts with her poise, dimpled smile and classic Louis Vuitton black gown.\nWhat Next\nShe is part of ambitious film projects like Fighter with Hrithik Roshan and Project K with Prabhas. She will join Rohit Shetty’s cop universe in Singham Again. She is likely to be cast opposite Mahesh Babu in SS Rajamouli’s next film.\nBy the way\nShe has a tattoo of her company logo.\n98) Yusuffali MA, Chairman, Lulu Group\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nYusuffali MA is the richest man from Kerala and the greatest success story of an expatriate in West Asia. The retail king operates in over 20 countries across West Asia, South Asia, the US and Europe, and has an annual turnover of around $8 billion.\nPower Punch\nYusuffali is a powerful link between the rulers of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and India. A businessman known to have connections with all parties, he is also a benefactor for numerous initiatives. His interventions brought relief for hundreds of expatriates in West Asia. In April 2020, a member of Abu Dhabi’s royal family reportedly acquired a 20 per cent stake in LuLu for $1 billion, according to Forbes.\nWhat Next\nIndia is now a major destination in the Lulu group’s expansion plan. He has lined up shopping malls, hyper markets from Kerala to Srinagar and high-end hotels in various states. He has signed an MoU with the UP government for Rs 4,500 crore to set up outlets in Noida, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Ayodhya, Kanpur and Prayagraj. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan described him as the state’s unofficial ambassador.\nBy the way\nThe 2008 Padma Shri recipient is known to love rare models of luxury cars.\n99) Alia Bhatt, Actor, producer, entrepreneur\nRank last year: 97\nWhy\nAlia Bhatt was the Hindi film industry’s most bankable and versatile actor, delivering three major hits in different genres with Gangubai Kathiawadi, Darlings and Brahmastra. She walked away with accolades for her powerful performance in Gangubai Kathiawadi as a sex-worker, and as a victim of domestic abuse in Darlings, which she co-produced. She launched Ed-a-Mamma, a clothing brand for children. Amid all this, she married actor Ranbir Kapoor and gave birth to their daughter Raha.\nPower Punch\nDespite the post-pandemic lull in film theatres, Gangubai Kathiawadi — directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali — pulled the crowd back to the halls. Darlings, which is streaming on Netflix, became the highest-viewed non-English Indian original film. Bhatt supports the cause of homeless animals.\nWhat Next\nBhatt will appear alongside Israeli actress Gal Gadot in the highly anticipated American spy action thriller, Heart of Stone, directed by Tom Harper. In July, she has the Karan Johar-directed romantic comedy, Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani, up for release.\nBy the way\nBhatt’s company Ed-A-Mamma is named after her cat, Edward.\n100) Ranveer Singh, Actor, brand ambassador\nRank last year: Not on list\nWhy\nThe flamboyant actor, who is the brand ambassador for the NBA in India, knows how to take compliments as well as criticism in his stride. In the new Pepsi commercial, Ranveer Singh debunks all the criticism he has been facing for his choices. Even though his last few films — Cirkus, Jayeshbhai Jordaar and 83 — have not been commercial successes, he has cemented his reputation as a versatile actor who doesn’t hesitate to take risks. That’s the reason why his onscreen characters leave an imprint.\nPower Punch\nSingh showed that he is comfortable in his own skin and with his vulnerability with his nude photoshoot for Paper magazine. The photos sparked a controversy with police complaints registered against him but he held his own.\nWhat Next\nSingh’s next release is the Karan Johar-directed Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani with Alia Bhatt. He is likely to start shooting for Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Baiju Bawra soon. The actor is likely to collaborate with director S Shankar for a grand pan-India trilogy based on the Tamil epic novel Velpari.\nBy the way\nHe has a collection of bunny slippers.\nSince you are here, check out our previous IE100 lists:\n👉🏽 IE100 2021: In 2021, well before the Hindenburg storm, Gautam Adani moved up to rank 10 on the list.
