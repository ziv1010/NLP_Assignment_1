  "body_text": "Poised to take over second after a run of six games being one of the best teams in the league (only Philly has more points, by one) the Seattle Sounders are showing depth of tactics and grit, not merely depth of the roster.\nThey've won as a slow crawl, no possession team that struggles to show decisiveness. Against both Dallas and San Diego there was a flurry of ineffective attacks that failed. Grabbing wins in those circumstances, as a poor home team (especially against San Diego), is a reminder that great teams need good fortune. Even 2024 Inter Miami struggled a few times, including against woeful Toronto and D.C.\nBeing simple and competitive is solid. It's the action of the rogue. A sneaky strike with the dagger.\nSnagging a road draw against another top tier Western Conference team showed the sword. Free and swinging, going blow-to-blow, strike-to-strike with the Timbers helped correct the early season road woes. Now Schmetzer's team is an adequate 2-2-2 in the last six away from Lumen.\nThey don't need to cower. They don't need to withdraw. Against one of the better offenses they saw success. Yes, those that live by the sword, die by the sword (LAFC with that stark reminder).\nBut also, Schmetzer is willing to exploit the failures of others. If a team is going to give Seattle they opportunity he will blow them out. The combination of talent, tactics and ruthlessness is on display regularly.\nOn the season the Sounders have three fireball wins – absolutely dominating, winning by three or more goals. That's as many as the top three in the Supporters' Shield standings have in total. Inter Miami only has one such win, in the Concacaf Champions Cup (Seattle had two there).\nDagger. Sword. Fireball.\nThis Sounders team, while riddled with injuries to the center forward and center back positions, demonstrates exactly what a Shield caliber team must be – diverse in tactics, diverse in triumphs and willing to win however the opponent allows them.\nUse our affiliate links to support your bloggers when buying merch and tickets.\nCatching up on Sounder at Heart\nHere's what you missed on the site this week.\nSounders\nNext match: Next match: Sunday, June 1 vs. Minnesota United | 3 pm PT | MLS Season Pass (free!)\n- Under The Lights: Previewing Minnesota and talking MLS with Jeff Rueter\n- Sounders set themselves up for an epic run\n- Lobbing Scorchers: The National Pundits LOVE Albert Rusnak\n- Club World Cup provides motivation, not distraction\n- Home is where the points are: Sounders gut out big win\n- Postgame Pontifications: Pure grit\n- Three the hard way: Sounders get past FC Dallas\n- Postgame Pontifications: Signs of High Life Soccer\n- Realio’s Ratings: CR7 keeps rolling, dragging Sounders along tracks\n- Lobbing Scorchers: Katie Wilson on Safer Streets, Cheaper Housing & a World-Class 2026 World Cup\nThis newsletter was made possible through the support of Full Pull Wines, a boutique wines reseller that has been sponsoring us since 2011.\nReign\nNext match: Next match: Friday, June 6 at San Diego Wave | 7 pm PT | Prime Video\nIt's an off week for Reign and the rest of the NWSL while national teams play.\nDefiance\nNext match: Saturday, May 31 vs. Minnesota United 2 | 7 pm ET | YouTube\n- Reed Baker-Whiting called into USA U20 team\n- Stuart Hawkins called into USA U19 team\n- Snyder Brunell called into USA U18s\n- Tacoma Defiance drop third straight\nLooking back at the news\nEverything else you need to know\nLast week, before San Diego came to Seattle to lose, a group of loser 'fans' decided to fight LA Galaxy fans in the stands. San Diego and MLS responded by banning 33 from all MLS matches, stadiums and activities from now until whenever.\nThe Great Game in soccer is the ability to sell contracts for players and make money. Some of the world's soccer teams do this because they can't make money without it. In MLS the best way to participate in the Great Game is through the U22 program, which doesn't really help teams win games of soccer.\nMichelle Kang invented selling one of Michelle Kang's coaches to another one of Michelle Kang's teams – which is totally not self dealing.\nDenver NWSL hired their first GM. He's in the Yates report as the one that hired Paul Riley in NC.\nNeymar thinks soccer needs more entertainment like anthem singers and other auxiliary entertainment.
