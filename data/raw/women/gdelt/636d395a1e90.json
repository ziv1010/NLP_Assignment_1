In March Fifa stripped Indonesia of the right to host the U20 World Cup over a refusal to host the Israeli team.\nFifa confirmed its 74th Congress would be held in Bangkok, Thailand, on 17 May.\nThe Congress is expected to vote on who should host the 2027 Women’s World Cup. Brazil and South Africa have submitted bids, while there are two combined bids – Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany and the United States and Mexico.",
