  "body_text": "We are delighted to announce that Laura Wienroither has signed a new contract with us.\nThe 25-year-old Austrian international defender has made 47 appearances and scored one goal for us since joining from TSG 1899 Hoffenheim in January 2022.\nLaura made her debut from the bench against Manchester United on 19 January 2022, finishing the season on 12 appearances.\nLaura’s first full campaign at Arsenal saw her make 30 appearances as she grew into an important member of the squad. An anterior cruciate ligament injury sustained in our UEFA Women’s Champions League semi-final against Wolfsburg on 1 May 2023 ruled Laura out of much of the 2023/24 season, but she would make a successful return to the first team in our 5-0 win over Bristol City on 5 April 2024.\nDuring her time in N5, Laura has helped us to win two FA Women’s Continental Tyres League Cups.\n“It’s such an incredible feeling for me to put pen to paper once again for the Arsenal.” said Laura. “I’m so happy to remain at this club and to have the opportunity to continue playing for a football team that I consider home. Being back on the pitch with my teammates is a feeling I can’t describe, and I can’t wait for the next season to get started.”\nHead Coach Jonas Eidevall added: “I’m delighted that Laura has signed a new deal with us. She brings us real quality in the full-back position, while her work rate and team spirit are just as important. She’s worked so hard on her return to competition and I’m sure she will continue to make a big contribution to the squad moving forward.”\nDirector of Women’s Football Clare Wheatley said: “Laura is an important part of our squad and we’re very happy that she will continue to represent us here at Arsenal. We’ve all been impressed by the way Laura has worked back from serious injury, which was sustained at the end of an excellent first full season here. We look forward to seeing her back to her best and I know our supporters will join me in warmly congratulating her today.”\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
