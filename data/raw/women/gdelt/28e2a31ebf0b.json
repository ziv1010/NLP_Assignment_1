She played all matches for the Falcons and helped Nigeria reach the round of 16.\nReacting to the announcement video released on Tuesday by Al-Ittihad Ladies on X, formerly Twitter, the Nigerian talent wrote, “Grateful to have signed for Al-Ittihad. Excited to start this journey alongside some incredible human beings. My journey of stepping into more of myself continues. It’s more than football”\nIn the announcement video, she said, “Football for me is about connecting not only with myself but with people around me, whether my teammates or staff,” she told the club’s media.\n“Everything I have done in my career so far is about doing something bigger than myself.\n“I joined Al Ittihad because of new opportunities on and off the pitch. I’m not here with any expectations; I’m here to be myself.\n“I hope that I can learn and take so much from the environment as a football player and, more importantly, as a human being.”\nPlumptre made 79 appearances for Leicester Women before her departure from the club at the end of last season.",
