  "body_text": "Exclusive: Kamala Harris campaign launches 'Athletes for Harris'\nThere's \"Swifties for Harris\" and \"Cat Ladies for Kamala\" and \"White Dudes for Harris.\" You can add one more to the list: \"Athletes for Harris.\"\nThe Harris campaign says it's launching \"Athletes for Harris\" and the effort is designed to mobilize athletes and coaches in the final weeks of the campaign, according to a statement obtained by USA TODAY Sports.\n\"Athletes are among the most trusted voices for key voting blocs, especially young men, making them uniquely qualified campaigners for Vice President Harris and Governor (Tim) Walz’s campaign,\" read the statement. \"Sporting events and games are also key moments that draw in large and politically diverse audiences, audiences that are increasing their reach with Gen Z and younger men.\"\nThe campaign said it will leverage the events and athletes to \"organize, reach, and make its case to voters\" using various strategies, including having big-name athletes as co-chairs to help campaign.\nThe 10 co-chairs leading the effort are: Hall of Famer Magic Johnson; tennis great Billie Jean King; Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr; two-time World Cup champion Ali Krieger; WNBA champion and Olympic gold medalist Candace Parker; Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers; South Carolina coach Dawn Staley; Paralympic swimmer Ali Truwit; NBA all-star Chris Paul; and Philadelphia Eagles defensive lineman Thomas Booker.\n\"I just got back from the Paralympics a few weeks ago and now more than ever feel the importance of unity and unifying voices,\" Truwit said in a statement. \"And Vice President Harris is a vote for kindness and inclusivity and unity.\"\nThe campaign also said it will use a paid media blitz that targets sports fans at key upcoming games. \"Athletes for Harris\" will also attempt to recruit other athletes to campaign on behalf of Harris.\nOver the past several months different groups have popped up backing Harris. They're composed of different demographics. Many credit the \"Win With Black Women Call\" as the leading edge of this movement. The call reportedly drew over 40,000 participants.\nBringing athletes into this mix and political environment is yet another way for Harris to raise money and get attention.\nHarris also recently got the backing of 15 Pro Football Hall of Famers: Mel Blount, Emmitt Smith, Kellen Winslow, Andre Tippett, Marv Levy, Alan Page, Drew Pearson, Kenny Houston, Jan Stenerud, Calvin Johnson, Robert Brazile, Willie Roaf, Mike Haynes, Elvin Bethea, and Ron Mix.\n\"I have known Vice President Harris for over 25 years, and you can count on her to deliver on what she says she is going to do,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"She’ll be a President for all people, no matter the race, language, sexual orientation, or party line.\n\"She showed all of us — and showed the world — that she was ready to be President, how smart she is, and her plan for the country in that debate. We are not going backwards; we are moving forward. For all of the athletes out there, don’t be afraid to use your platforms — we need all of you to get involved. Share this with your friends that Vice President Harris has an agenda that will move the country forward. The Magic Man is on board.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: ‘Athletes for Harris': VP rakes in endorsements from hall of famers",
