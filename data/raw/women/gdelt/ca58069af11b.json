That was their fifth title in a row and second Grand Slam in a row.\nIt was their 18th overall title, 16th Grand Slam and came with a 22nd Triple Crown. They're the dominant force in women's rugby.\nFrance were the last team to lift the title, in 2018.\nWhat is the format of the Women's Six Nations?\nFollowing the same practice as the men's tournament (and same weekend fixture schedule), the Women's Six Nations takes place each year from the late March until the end of April and is contested by the international sides of France, England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales.\nEvery team plays each of the other five once, with home advantage alternating each year, giving a total of 15 games per championship. A win earns four points, while a draw earns both teams two points.\nThe losing team receives no points, however a bonus point can be picked up by a team regardless of whether win, lose or draw, as long as they score four or more tries in a game. Losing sides can also pick up two bonus points if they score four tries or more and lose by a margin of seven points or fewer.\nThe team with the most points wins the Championship Trophy, and five victories earns the ultra-prestigious Grand Slam accolade.\nWho has won the most Women's Six Nations championships in history?\nEngland again dominate, with 18 total titles, to go with 16 Grand Slams. Next come France with six, Ireland two and Scotland one. Neither Italy, Wales or Spain (briefly replacing Ireland for two years from 1998).\nLike the men, the tournament has worn several guises over the years. It also started out as the Home Nations in 1996, before becoming the Five Nations in 1999 as France joined the fray, before Italy arrived in 2002. Spain replaced Ireland from 1998 to 2000).\nAndy Murray is an award-winning writer and columnist, voted the Consumer Journalist of the Year at the 2015 PPA New Talent Awards.
