This comes after fans launched a petition to \"save Canberra United\" as speculation swirls about the club's future.\nThe ACT government has offered to fast track $250,000 in funding to help ease financial pressure. But that may not be enough after Farrow declared the game's governing body in Canberra would only continue to operate United if it can source \"improved investment\".\nCapital Football claims it has spent $2.5 million on the team in the past two seasons, however it refused to breakdown those costs into player wages, staffing, travel and any other associated A-League Women's fees.\nA planned press conference on Tuesday with Canberra United coach Njegosh Popovich and Young Matildas star Sasha Grove was also cancelled ahead of their final home game of the season at McKellar Park on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe organisation's stance continues to leave players and fans in the lurch, with the team effectively having four days left before its season finale in Brisbane, at which point it may not return to the A-League next season.\nSport Minister Yvette Berry is concerned about United's potential demise, prompting the advanced $250,000 funding.\nCapital Football said it was only offered $125,000, however the ACT government confirmed that Farrow had been informed it would be $250,000.\nBerry said she'd been in frequent conversation with Capital Football, the Australian Professional Leagues and the Canberra A-League Men bid group about the situation, but was yet to receive a \"straight answer\" about Canberra United's future.\n\"The latest I wrote to Capital Football and the APL was on Friday evening. I've offered to bring forward their annual funding because they say they've had some financial difficulties,\" Ms Berry said on ABC Radio.\n\"It's $250,000 which we increased in last year's budget to ensure that Canberra United could be funded because they had more home games this season than any other.\n\"We're not getting an answer from Capital Football or the APL. It's absolutely not acceptable. I'm particularly concerned about those players that can't speak for themselves - they're between a rock and a hard place.\n\"I've made it clear that the ACT government support a men's A-League team but it cannot be at the expense of a women's A-League team. The women's team has seen record membership and spectatorship ... it's very frustrating.\n\"We've offered up the money and we'll wait for a response from Capital Football.\"\nFarrow responded to Berry and the fan petition in a lengthy statement.\n\"Capital Football want Canberra United to continue playing in the A-League in season 2024-2025 and beyond,\" she said.\n\"Questioning Capital Football and its board's commitment to women's football is simply unfair and unwarranted.\n\"Capital Football has over 15,000 participants, across all areas of our game. Continuing to run at a loss will affect each individual and the ongoing viability of our competitions making additional sources of revenue vital to our success.\n\"I can assure all involved, our intention is to see Canberra United on the pitch for season 17, subject to improved investment.\n\"Capital Football continues to explore all avenues to ensure that Canberra United take the field for season 17, seeking new sources of investment having exhausted traditional revenue and funding streams.\"\nUnited fans joined forces on Monday morning to launch a petition. Mikaela Danvers helped get the petition online on behalf of supporters that became concerned a board meeting on Monday night would be discussing the future of Canberra United.\n\"There was concern that they're actually deciding things without any community input or communication with players, staff or fans, because of what happened last year with the Canberra United Academy,\" Danvers said.\n\"That contributed to people feeling a strong sense of urgency to get the word out.\n\"Even if they weren't making a decision on Monday night at a board meeting, there's been no communication, there's no plan B if the men's bid falls through. That's where their responsibility lies to communicate with the players and the fans.\n\"All our superstars, even future Matildas like Chloe Lincoln, Sasha Grove and Tegan Bertolissio, we have to hang onto those players. It's insane that we would let them go. Even if the men's bid goes through - which would be great - it's too late. Many players will already have contracts elsewhere.\"\nThe petition was sent to all board members on Monday night, and by Tuesday it has surpassed 1700 signatures. Fans are in the midst of organising signs to show their support to the women's team at their final home game of the season on Wednesday.\n\"The momentum hasn't surprised us, and I expect it to keep going,\" Danvers said. \"No one wants this team to fold.\n\"People understand the difficult position Capital Football is in ... but the club has been around since 2008, they've had a long time to figure it out.\"\nFormer Capital Football chief executive and Football Australia board member Heather Reid also spoke on ABC Radio and said she would be travelling to Brisbane for United's final game of the season on Saturday, hopeful it wouldn't be their last ever.\n\"I don't want that game to be a wake, I want that to be an awakening for Canberra United to continue for the next 12 months at least until there is an announcement about an APL men's licence,\" Reid said.\n\"Maybe Capital Football needs to be a little bit more creative in its vision and its strategy going forward.\n\"Is there an opportunity to have an independent working group put in place? Certainly having a budget approved by the board and the appointment of a general manager approved by the board, but move it slightly away from the Capital Football's day-to-day management, and give it an independent group that has vision and creative solutions to raising the funds that are necessary for this team.\"\nReid also believed the ACT government bringing forward their annual funding should help Capital Football's situation.\n\"$250,000 would certainly kick-start it. I think there's definitely ways that this can be managed,\" she said.\n\"People just want to know what is going on and the silence is deafening and what is causing the problems for the fans.\"\nCAPITAL FOOTBALL'S STATEMENT IN FULL\nCapital Football want Canberra United to continue playing in the A-League in season 2024/2025 and beyond.\nCapital Football is the only member federation that runs its own A-League side and has successfully done this for 16 seasons, however the rising cost of running an A-League side has had a significant impact on our bottom line.\nCapital Football has invested over $2.5 million in Canberra United across the past two seasons, as well as doubling the club's annual budget since 2020/2021.\nQuestioning Capital Football and its board's commitment to women's football is simply unfair and unwarranted.\nThe Canberra United season now comprises 22 games, as opposed to 12 games in 2020/2021, and 14 games in 2021/2022. This has considerably raised the cost of running a full-time professional side and has put significant pressure on our financial standing as evidenced by the reported deficit in 2022, with another deficit anticipated for 2023.\nCapital Football has over 15,000 participants, across all areas of our game. Continuing to run at a loss will affect each individual and the ongoing viability of our competitions making additional sources of revenue vital to our success.\nThe fact is the men's A-League bid is a key factor in a sustainable elite level presence in the region. We are aware developments are at a critical stage and conscious that players, coaches and supporters want clarity, as do we. I can assure all involved, our intention is to see Canberra United on the pitch for Season 17, subject to improved investment.\nCapital Football continues to explore all avenues to ensure that Canberra United take the field for Season 17, seeking new sources of investment having exhausted traditional revenue and funding streams. We are working alongside the Canberra A-League bid, the APL, and the ACT government to explore additional opportunities.\nACT government have offered a 50% advance payment of our existing funding agreement to assist with the upfront running costs of Canberra United. Contrary to reports, last night the Capital Football board met as part of their regular meeting schedule, not an emergency meeting about the future of Canberra United. Discussions around Canberra United are a regular agenda item at board meetings.\nWe appreciate the passion of the Canberra United community and our loyal fanbase. We all want a successful and elite club representing our region and giving our players something to aspire to, but that support needs to be replicated financially to sustain and grow our presence on a national stage.",
