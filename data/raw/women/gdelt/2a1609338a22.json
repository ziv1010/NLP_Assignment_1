  "body_text": "West Alabama Friday Briefing\nGood morning West Alabama. It is Friday, December 6, 2024.\nThis is a big day for the Tuscaloosa Academy Football Team. The Knights travel just up the interstate to Birmingham this afternoon with a chance to bring home some serious hardware - the 2A AHSAA Football State Championship.\nTo this point in the season TA is 12-2. Their lone loses were back-to-back close games with Sulligent 46-44 (region play) and Coosa Christian 35-21. Tuscaloosa Academy posted a 5-1 region record and got revenge on Sulligent 20-14 to make it to the title game.\nThe Rebels of east Alabama are 13-1 on the season. That loss was the first game of the season 28-7 to T.R. Miller. Since then, they reeled off (pun intended) 13 straight wins. Reeltown rolled up big scores in most of their games, but it took a 6-0 shutout of Highland Home last week to make it to the title game at Protective Stadium.\nReeltown was the runner-up in last year's championship game and a vote by prep fans on the Super7 website favors the Rebels to use that experience as a motivator. 60% picked Reeltown to win and 40% selected Tuscaloosa Academy.\nTA is the only West Alabama squad to make it to the AHSAA Super 7 this season. That is quite an accomplishment, and the team deserves our praise and support.\nA win would give the Knights their first ever state public school championship. The school did take the Alabama Independent School Association (AISA) title in 2012.\nThe game will be televised on the Alabama Public Television Network, as well as the NFHS Network.\nCongratulations to Head Coach Josh Wright and his staff for a remarkable season! We are all proud of TA. Go Knights!\n(Opinions expressed in Morning Briefing are not necessarily those of the ownership, Mangement or staff of Townsquare Media Tuscaloosa.)\nWeather: Potential Heavy Rainfall in Alabama Soon Plus Rain Chance Guide\nA sunny and cold day with high temperatures only in the 40s will give way to another clear and cold night with low temperatures in the lower to middle 20s.

His attorneys had requested a new hearing but that has now been denied.\nTuscaloosa City Schools achieved an 84 overall grade from the state report card recently released by the Alabama Department of Education. It shows significant improvement, however three schools, Central High, Eastwood Middle and Oakdale Elementary continue to struggle to achieve.

After May 7 next year you will not be able to board a domestic or foreign flight in the U.S. without it.\nThe Bibb County Sheriff's Office has a new K9 unit. 2-year-old Dutch Shepherd, K-9 Ari, is the first law enforcement canine since the retirement of the late Deputy Brad Johnson’s canine Brodie.\nAlabama Junior Republican U.S. Senator Katie Britt and Tennessee Senator Marsha Washburn are the only female GOP senators in Washington expressing support for President-Elect Trump's Defense Department nominee.\nTopping Sports News:\nThe ACC/SEC Woen's Basketball Challenge has given the 19th ranked Alabama Women's Basketball Team their first defeat of the young season.\nAll Alabama Football fans are SMU fans this weekend. A win in the SEC Championship game tomorrow afternoon over Georgia would propel the Crimson Tide into the College Football Playoffs\nTis the season for the \"Transfer Portal\" in NCAA football.
