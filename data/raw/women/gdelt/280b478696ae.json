  "body_text": "Early in the fourth quarter in a game on Sept. 5, the Kansas City Chiefs’ speedy rookie receiver Xavier Worthy caught a deep pass that he ran into the end zone, pushing his total receiving yards for the game to 47 — just a sliver above the over/under oddsmakers set prior to the game. Those betting on him to reach the threshold had just won their bets.\nDue to a glitch involving a third-party vendor of player information, however, gamblers on Fanatics’ online sportsbook could, for a brief time, continue to place wagers on Worthy’s totals with the knowledge that he had already hit the over. It was a surefire win.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nIn Connecticut, two players took advantage of the oversight before it was corrected, waging a total of $210 on parlay bets with a potential payout of $8,610.\nFanatics appealed to state regulators asking to void the bets due to the error, and the state agreed. The wagers were canceled and the stake was returned to gamblers as if they'd never placed the bets.\nAs legal sports betting has proliferated across the United States, the question of how to handle this sort of situation has become a fiercely debated subject in gambling circles. Sportsbooks argue they shouldn't have to pay out bets based on faulty odds, technical glitches or other mistakes. Bettors counter that it's the job of the operators to set accurate odds and that they should have to respect the wagers they accept.\nTake control of your search results\nIn some extreme instances, operators sought to avoid paying out six-figure sums after the fact, claiming they were the result of glitches or other errors. This has led players to allege a double standard: When sportsbooks benefit from mistakes, the bets count. When they don't benefit, the bets don't count.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nConnecticut officials say they side with players more than other states, adopting a policy that they won't retroactively void bets at the request of sportsbooks except in extreme circumstances.\n“If you make the request (to void a wager) after the outcome of the bet is known, I’m not going to grant it,” Kristofer Gilman, director of the state's gaming division, said in an interview. “You’re going to pay that bet because you took it. Had it lost, you probably wouldn’t have reached out to me.”\nDocuments reviewed by CT Insider, however, reveal various conditions under which the state will void bets.\nRecords obtained from the Department of Consumer Protection’s Gambling Division under a Freedom of Information Act request show nine instances in which sportsbooks requested to void players’ bets since Connecticut legalized sports betting in 2021. In all but one of those cases, regulators approved the request and allowed the sportsbook to void bets and return the players’ stake without any winnings.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nIn the example with Worthy, along with others CT Insider reviewed, the Department of Consumer Protection voided bets that were attributed to technological errors allowing betters to make wagers on events that had already taken place. In other cases, the state voided wagers because it was not legal for the sportsbook to accept bets on the events in question.\nA DCP spokesperson said the agency does not have a formal policy dictating when bets are voided and when they are honored and that “all requests are reviewed individually.”\n‘Mate, that’s the gambling market’\nFor a few precious minutes on Oct. 23, 2024, the DraftKings sports betting app mistakenly listed a same-game parlay that was far too good to be true.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nDuring that time, bettors could wager on LeBron James, one of the NBA's top stars, to score more than 4.5 points, pull down more than 0.5 rebounds and record more than 0.5 assists in that night's game against the Nuggets. In other words, they could profit by betting an All-Star to put up a stat line befitting a benchwarmer.\nEighty-three people in Connecticut capitalized on the glitch before DraftKings caught it, wagering a total of $3,698.13 to win $151,053.98. Sure enough, James scored 21 points with eight rebounds and five assists, easily hitting the marks necessary for bettors to win their parlays.\nAlmost immediately, DraftKings reached out to gambling regulators across the country, including Connecticut's Department of Consumer Protection, asking them to void the bets, which they later attributed to a third-party error. According to ESPN, 18 of the 20 states where sports betting was legal permitted DraftKings to void the wagers and decline paying out any money on them.\nConnecticut, however, did not.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n\"All the wagers in question were placed on a combination of events for which the indicated selections did occur,\" Gilman wrote in an email to DraftKings.\n\"Additionally, the outcome of the events was not known at the time of wager placement, there is no evidence of fraud or manipulation related to these wagers, nor is there any suggestion that any of these wagers were placed by prohibited patrons.\"\nIn Connecticut, at least, the bettors got their winnings. In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson for DraftKings referred a reporter to company's publicly-posted rules, which grant DraftKings wide discretion to seek voids due to errors or so-called \"syndicate betting\" that involves groups of players working together to identify flaws or hidden values in the odds.\nDeclan Hill, a professor at the University of New Haven and widely recognized sports gambling expert, said forcing sportsbooks to honor bets in a situation like that should be an easy call.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n\"If you’re a bookmaker and you post odds, you can’t go back in time and say, 'Oops we made a mistake,'\" Hill said. \"I would love to see a bettor go to a bookmaker and say, ‘I made a mistake, I want you to void my account.' Mate, that’s the gambling market.\"\nEarlier this year, the Washington Post reported an instance in which a Tennessee sportsbook attempted to avoid paying out $127,420 after a bettor won three long-shot parlays, claiming the listed odds were erroneous. The bettor eventually received his money — but only once a reporter began asking questions about the situation.\nHill acknowledged there are certain instances when voiding bets makes sense, such as when bookmakers take bets on sporting events that have already happened. But the fact states regularly let sportsbooks void bets instead of paying them, Hill said, shows \"the almost total control bookmakers have over legislatures across the country.\"\n\"You can’t let a bookmaker get away with that kind of nonsense,\" Hill said.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nTechnical issues and illegal bets\nOther incidents from the last three years show the myriad ways sportsbooks can make mistakes in the bets they make available on their platforms — and the lengths players will go to exploit those errors.\nOn Feb. 26, 2022, for example, FanDuel experienced a \"technical issue\" that allowed some players to bet on the outcome of events that had already concluded on the other side of the world, according to an incident report subsequently submitted to DCP.\nOver the course of the five hours in which the issue was present, dozens of players in Connecticut placed more than 70 bets on games that had already concluded — ranging from English Premier league matches to Italian tennis tournaments and Swedish women’s basketball. (Significant portions of the report are redacted, and it is not clear why the issue appears to have only impacted overseas games).\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe total stake wagered on those events was $12,547, with a potential payout of $152,692, according to the report. DCP approved FanDuel’s request to void the bets, but only for the events with known outcomes.\nA spokesperson for FanDuel noted that the platform serves more than 3 million customers nationally, and is \"constantly looking to identify and address any tech issues affecting customer experience.\"\nIn a similar incident this May, Fanatics mistakenly allowed players to bet on a pair of Norwegian First Division soccer matches that had ended several hours before. Four customers noticed the error before it was corrected, placing $295 in wagers with a potential payout of $31,685.46. Again, DCP approved the company’s request to void the bets.\nIn some cases, the mistakes did not involve any additional advantage to the players placing bets.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nFor example, Fanatics released a promotional \"Oddsboost\" wager on the amount of points scored by both teams in a men's basketball game between the UConn Huskies and Marquette on March 6, despite Connecticut’s ban on betting on in-state college sports teams.\nThough Marquette only managed 31 points in the first half — thus making the sportsbooks the \"winner\" on those bets — Fanatics identified the issue before the game and notified the state the next day, receiving approval to void the 17 impermissible wagers it had accepted.\n\"Fanatics Sportsbook always tries to do right by the customer, so we take voiding any bets seriously,\" a company spokesman said in a statement. \"Prior to voiding wagers, Fanatics Sportsbook requests approval from the Department of Consumer Protection. We are committed to providing our customers with the most rewarding sportsbook in the state of Connecticut.\"\nThe largest single case of DCP agreeing to void wagers took place late last year as the Connecticut Lottery’s previous sportsbook operator, Rush Street Interactive, opted to leave the Connecticut market.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhile Rush Street ended its partnership with the lottery in December, it had continued to accept wagers on events occurring into 2024, DCP spokesperson Kaitlyn Krasselt said. The company's replacement, Fanatics, did not want to take on liability for those bets, Krasselt said, so an agreement was made to void 1,741 wagers due to settle after this year’s Super Bowl on Feb. 12.\nRush Street did not respond to requests for comment this week.",
