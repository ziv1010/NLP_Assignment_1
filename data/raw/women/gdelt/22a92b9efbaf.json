  "body_text": "Arsenal may have just dropped the perfect hint of who their next permanent Arsenal women’s head coach\nMid-October, after a not-so-perfect start to the league campaign, Jonas Eidevall, who was the Arsenal women’s boss, resigned.\nAdmittedly, the Gunner women were unprepared; they didn’t immediately have a replacement. The club appointed Eidevall’s assistant, Renee Slegers, as interim manager while they searched for their next permanent manager.\nRenee has seized the opportunity to lead the Gunner women.\nShe’s revived our Gunner Women; they’re now not only playing excellent football, but they are also doing one thing: scoring goals with ease, which they struggled to do.\nAfter 7 games under the Dutch tactician, our Gunner women have maintained an undefeated record with 6 wins and a draw. These impressive results have placed Arsenal in the WSL top 3, qualifying them for the UEFA Women’s Champions League quarterfinals with two group games remaining.\nRenee Slegers has been an excellent leader for our Arsenal women.\nThere’s been a push for her confirmation as the permanent manager. For a while, the club didn’t explicitly hint that they considered her their ideal head coach.\nHowever, they’ve just dropped a massive hint she could be given the job. There’s an interesting change of language in the press conference announcements for the Gunner women.\nBefore the international break, she was on Arsenal.com referred to as the “interim head coach”. Now she’s referred\n“head coach”.\nWill we soon get the breaking news that Renee Slegers is the new head coach of the Arsenal women’s team? I believe we will, and I’m sure most people would be happy about that, don’t you think?\nMichelle M\nFollow JustArsenal’s Gooner Women on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Womens Team!\nDo you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?
