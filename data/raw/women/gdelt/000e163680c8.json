That perception is no longer applicable to politics. But Senator Tommy Tuberville, a former college football coach, is doing something about that. He has cried “foul” at efforts by the Biden regime to destroy traditional values in the military.\nCoach Tuberville demonstrates the kind of grit we need to save America.\nOn the House side, faced with a government shutdown if budgets are not done on time, Republican leaders like Kevin McCarthy and James Comer argue that they must continue to fund the Biden regime because some of the money trickles down to their never-ending investigations of the Biden bribery apparatus. This seems like a no-win game, especially because a threatened impeachment would never pass the Senate.\n“Worse than Watergate” says Rep. Comer. But the Republicans don't have the votes to remove Biden from office.\nYet, all is not lost. Coach Tuberville is single-handedly preventing the confirmation of hundreds of “woke” military officers, including General Mark Milley’s replacement, the far-left ideologue Air Force Gen. C.Q. Brown.\nOne of the House Republicans who voted against McCarthy, Rep. Mary Miller, understands what is happening. She sent an email saying, “The Communists will do anything to win.”\nThe communists won when President Trump abandoned his presidency and military leaders chose China over Trump.\nConsider a message from Harmeet Dillon, of the Center for American Liberty, about how Fulton County, Georgia’s District Attorney isn’t just going after President Trump “she’s going after his lawyers too.” She points out, “The radical Left wants to send a loud, clear message to attorneys across the country that if they question the integrity of elections or provide legal services to conservative candidates, they could be held criminally responsible.”\nYou know the situation is dire when former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who busted the New York mob using the racketeering statute, is being accused of racketeering.\nRadical lawyers are working to take Trump’s name off the presidential ballot in 2024, and some could be successful.\nThe legal profession is hopeless. Significantly, a Trump nemesis, Special Counsel Jack Smith, learned his legal tactics at the UN’s International Criminal Court. He will get his man. Then the UN will go after all of us, America itself, for “crimes” based on slavery and capitalism.\nBut the military is also being destroyed from within, a process that will drive conservatives and Christians out.\nWithout a strong military and superior nuclear weapons acting as a deterrent, we are finished.\nWhen Joe Biden gave his “Soul of the Nation” speech at Independence Hall, he was surrounded by Marines in the background as props. It was another indication that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which approved the display, has become a pillar of America’s Marxist regime.\nJoint Chiefs Chairman Army Gen. Mark Milley defended Marxist indoctrination of our soldiers and presides over a force that includes gays and transgenders. What’s more, in actions that were clearly designed to subvert the Trump presidency and undermine the chain of command, it was revealed that Milley made secret calls to Communist Chinese officials during the final days of the Trump Administration, supposedly out of alleged concern that Trump would attack China. According to a transcript of another call, Milley told then-Democratic Party House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he would “prevent” unwarranted Trump use of the military “domestically and/or internationally.”\nOne would think that Milley would have sided with Trump, the legitimate president, and not a regime that released a virus that has killed more than 1 million Americans.\nThe bottom line is that Milley was part of the effort, working with Communist China, to keep Trump out of the White House. Milley made the military into an instrument for the consolidation of Biden’s Marxist regime, in the face of overwhelming evidence of election irregularities and censorship of major stories involving Biden family corruption that were censored by Big Tech, acting in collusion with the intelligence agencies.\nIn short, the “insurrection” was staged AGAINST President Trump.\nBut that is not what we are talking about these days. Instead, Trump is accused of staging the insurrection and faces jail time. Most Republicans fear the power of the legal apparatus that is targeting Trump and others.\nIn the face of this assault, there are still victories to be achieved. Consider the example set by Senator Tuberville, using powers that have always been available.\n“Since March the Pentagon has been spending our tax dollars for travel and extra paid time off for servicemembers and their kids to get abortions—something Congress neither authorized nor appropriated,” he notes. He has held up promotions and confirmations over this and other Pentagon policies.\nHe's rightly concerned about the fact that the U.S. military is using taxpayer funds for “initiatives unrelated to the military’s core mission of protecting Americans by ensuring readiness and lethality.”\nHe is demanding to know why Admiral Michael M. Gilday, chief of naval operations, permitted drag queen performances aboard naval vessels, including during the Trump administration’s ban on transgender servicemembers. He says one of the alleged performers was appointed the digital ambassador for the Navy’s recruiting efforts, posting videos to the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok.\nTuberville and his colleagues sent a separate letter to Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro “demanding to know why the Navy is utilizing TikTok,” a social media platform “known to pose serious national security threats due to its links to the Chinese Communist Party.”\nIn addition to the political control of the military, on behalf of China, Biden has overruled the Air Force decision over two and a half years ago to choose Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, for the headquarters of Space Command. Biden decided to permanently put Space Command in liberal pot-friendly and pro-abortion Colorado.\nAs soon as Joe Biden took office, notes Tuberville, Biden “inserted politics into what had been a fair and objective competition—not because the facts had changed, but because the political party of the sitting President had changed. The top three choices for Space Command headquarters were all in red, conservative states—Alabama, Nebraska, and Texas. Colorado didn’t even come close.”\nTuberville concluded that Biden is using military bases “as rewards for political supporters rather than for our security.”\nThe fact that Tuberville is fighting this battle virtually alone demonstrates the sad state we are in.\nThe inevitable result of the subversion process is a mass exodus of conservative and Christian men and women from the Armed Forces—leading to the return of the draft and destruction of much of our military power in the event of a confrontation with China over Taiwan.\nIt’s not an exaggeration to say that the fate of our nation lies in Coach Tuberville’s hands.\nThe views expressed by RenewAmerica columnists are their own and do not necessarily reflect the position of RenewAmerica or its affiliates.",
