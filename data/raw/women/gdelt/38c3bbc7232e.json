  "body_text": "Eni Aluko believes Sarina Wiegman’s England side are still a work in progress as they build up to defend the European Championship this summer.\nThe Lionesses have been patchy at points since their run to the World Cup final in 2023 but have showed promising signs of progress in recent matches.\nHaving beaten world champions Spain last international break, England dispatched off Belgium 5-0 to continue their unbeaten start to the Nations League.\nWiegman’s side face Belgian again tonight as they look for back-to-back wins in quick succession despite the absence of several key players.\nBut Aluko, speaking at the launch of the 2025 Women’s Football Awards on Monday, said the new-look Lionesses squad still has plenty of room for improvement.\n‘I don’t think they’ve quite hit those same heights that they did around the World Cup,’ Aluko told Metro\n‘I think the team has evolved slightly as well with new players like Grace Clinton coming in. But there is still that core that was there in that winning 2022 team and it’s still an exceptional team.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nAnd Aluko, capped 102 times for England, is confident that such quality will eventually shine through come the tournament in July.\n‘It’s a difficult group. For the first time, England will be going in with a bit of worry that it’s not going to be plain sailing,’ she added.\n‘But I think England are used to being the favourites now, I think it’s more about dealing with that tricky group. If they get out of that, they’ll be favourites to go all the way.’\nEuros glory is not the only silverware on the line for the Lionesses in the coming months, with several England players nominated for the Women’s Football Awards which Aluko will co-host for a third straight year.\nReturning for its third year, the Women’s Football Awards shines a light on the people and organisations at the forefront of the sport’s continued rapid growth.\n‘What I love about it is it brings so many different stakeholders together who want to grow the sport,’ Aluko said of next month’s event in London.\n‘These awards are unique in that sense and being able to host it and allow people to connect and support women in sport is amazing.’\nAluko is not the only person to witness first-hand the exponential growth of women’s football, with Manchester United forward Celin Bizet full of praise for the increased professionalisation seen in the WSL in recent years.\n‘Coming from Norway, everything has been a massive step,’ Bizet told attendees at an event in the Houses of Parliament.\n‘When I was a child I didn’t even know women’s football existed outside of Norway. I wanted to play on the men’s team for Manchester United but that wasn’t going to happen.\n‘I’ve been here for three years now which isn’t a long time but you can still see the development in that time. At Tottenham, we went from just having lunch to being able to have all three meals if we wanted it.\n‘When I was in Norway, I had to bring all my clothes back home to wash them myself but now that gets sorted. It’s small details but it makes you feel like an actually professional.’\nMore Trending\nPreviewing the awards night, Metro editor-in-chief Deborah Arthurs said: ‘As media partner of the Women’s Football Awards for the third year in a row, Metro is proud to be part of this important celebration.\n‘We have a history of covering the women’s game that dates back more than a decade and it’s something we will continue to champion every day.’\nHosting the launch event in Parliament was Labour MP Sarah Smith who added: ‘The Women’s Football Awards have become such an important event in the UK sporting calendar and is crucial in helping to promote opportunities for everybody.’\nThe Women’s Football Awards are supported by the Premier League. The annual event is sponsored by online retail giant Shein and VISA.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Sarina Wiegman blasts ‘sloppy’ England Lionesses after shock Nations League defeat\nMORE: Metro join Eni Aluko and Celin Bizet at Parliament for launch of Women’s Football Awards 2025\nMORE: This isn’t the England side that won Euro 2022 but these new Lionesses are ready for more glory",
