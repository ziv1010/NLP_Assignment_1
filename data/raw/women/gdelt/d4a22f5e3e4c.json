  "body_text": "Frustrated supporters of the city’s ongoing project to renovate White Stadium made it clear on Monday that opponents, including a non-profit organization that is leading a lawsuit that seeks to block the rehab plan, do not speak for them and many other people in the neighborhoods around Franklin Park.\nIn an online press conference, a group of pro-stadium neighbors and activists urged Mayor Wu to press forward with the renovation project, which is now in the demolition phase.\n“I’ve been very frustrated by this small group led by the Emerald Necklace Conservancy and Franklin Park Defenders and how they’ve used well-funded lawsuits and stall tactics to give the impression there is widespread opposition to the Stadium,” said Dot Fennell, a Jamaica Plain resident who lives close to the stadium site. “We’re not paid to be here. We’re here because we believe in the project and the future of our city.”\nFennell and Beth Santos, both mothers of Boston Public School (BPS) students and abutters to Franklin Park, organized the call and invited reporters to hear from other supporters who make the case against opponents who have stepped up their objections in recent days with rallies and protests.\n“There is so much support,” said Santos, who co-owns the Café Ula coffee shop in Jamaica Plain. “We believe in the full vision of this project and Boston should be leaders and not settling for a lesser option…We believe the opposition should be for our kids today and not those multiple generations from now.”\nChris Smith, who works for a non-profit called Boston After School and Beyond, said his organization works with the Boston Public Schools to run summer and after-school programming, including a popular summer feature that promotes lacrosse at the Mildred Avenue School in Mattapan. In all, they serve around 21,000 students in 450 after-school and summer programs.\nFixing White Stadium, he said, is “a big, game-changing opportunity for how kids spend their time outside of school. He noted that the renovated stadium will result in brand-new amenities like a weight room and classroom space for use by BPS students.\n“It will be open after-school and on weekends and in the summer. These are times that can be problems for young people, but also great opportunity,” Smith added.\nTony DaRocha, a retired BPS coach and founder of the Boston United Track Club, said Boston student-athletes shouldn’t have to settle for the poor conditions they’ve endured for years at the city-owned stadium. He urged opponents to re-think their position.\n“Having access to facilities is something really important to have and to understand the strength of public-private partnerships,” he said. “I know they work. In Boston, the problem we have is we can’t maintain our facilities.”\nJamaica Plain resident David Shapiro, who is also president of the Boston YMCA, said everyone’s focus should turn from blocking the project to making sure agreements made by the BOSNation soccer team are enforced.\n“I want to see operating agreements that are ironclad for usage for BPS sports,” said Shapiro. “I want to see how we transport kids from all over the city to this facility. It’s not like I’m just openly trusting this will be a panacea. But I want to see us focus on the operating part of it that has kids flocking to places like Reggie Lewis (Track and Athletic Center). When we build great facilities, people want to use it.”\nThe online discussion comes a week after the Franklin Park Defenders group held a rally outside the stadium as demolition of the grandstand and cutting of trees began. Opponents also held a meeting earlier this month at Lena Park Community Center to unveil their own proposal for renovating the stadium without a private partner, which they claim would cost the city $29 million.\nThe city’s existing lease agreement partners with the professional women’s soccer franchise, BOS Nation, on a $200 million renovation project that uses $105 million in public money.\nOn Friday, BOS Nation investor Linda Henry, the CEO of The Boston Globe and wife of Globe publisher and Red Sox owner John Henry, announced in an Instagram post that she has withdrawn her financial interest in the team. Henry says she remains a supporter of the soccer franchise and of the stadium renovation plan.\nSupporters said they will continue to organize and be more vocal in the coming days. They plan to stage visibility events as construction moves on.\nIn another move, Boston After School and Beyond sent out a follow-up letter Monday with more than 40 youth sports leaders signing on in support. They included Candice Gartley of ADSL, Mick Brunache of Nxt Era Panthers and Mattapan Youth Football, Robert Lewis, Jr., of Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston, Steph Lewis of The BASE, Terry Cousins of Dorchester Eagles football, and Patrick Cronin of Harlem Lacrosse.",
