  "body_text": "A cursory look at the history of the implantation of the Zionist state in the heart of Palestine and the events that ensued is enough to make it clear beyond the shadow of a doubt that Palestinians have been subjected to systematic oppression and injustice. When October 7 happened, it was not difficult for anyone with a very basic understanding of the history of the region to see that this was an inevitable reaction to 70+ years of brutal subjugation and state sponsored violence.\nYet for most people residing in the European or American continents, the writing on the wall had never been obvious. Ten months down the blood-splattered trajectory, many still debate whether Palestinians are also entitled to human rights…\nFor still more, it took thousands of excruciating images of unimaginable cruelty, death and destruction to stir the conscience into realization that the insistence that ‘Israel has the right to defend itself’ does little to vindicate the unspeakable agony being inflicted on vulnerable Palestinians.\nIt has taken ten months of relentless, brutal assault and incomprehensible suffering for some of us to abandon our indifference, insensitivity and smugness- and for many more, it is still not enough.\nYet psychologists and philosophers tell us that human beings are endowed with empathy as a part of their nature. It is the systematic dehumanization of a people that renders them unworthy of empathy. For Palestinians to reach that point, the Western media influenced by powerful Zionist lobbies has made a concerted and consistent effort. Through selective relaying of information, otherization of non Western narratives, prioritization of a single narrative and suppression of counter-narratives, the media has deflected human empathy away from the plight of Palestine. In addition, distortion and manipulation of facts and the ground realities in order to suit the interests of the West’s Blue Eyed Boy in the Middle East, stereotyping and propaganda are routinely used by the global media. This has made sure Palestinian voices remain unheard, their stories untold, their narrative marginalized as opposed to the Israeli narrative that is mainstreamed unquestioningly.\nLanguage is used very insidiously to push forward the narrative of Israel as a victim of Palestinian ‘terrorism’, entitled to ‘defend itself’ against a battered, besieged nation of orphans, limbless youth, bereaved widows and traumatized, emaciated men.\nFor example, mainstream news media routinely refers to the Israeli assault on Gaza as the ‘Israel-Hamas conflict’. This is problematic because it puts the Zionist nuclear armed state at par with the Palestinian resistance whose arsenal only comprises of home-made primitive ‘rockets’ that work more like small fireworks and are nearly always intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome technology. It makes it seem like a war between equals- while on the one side is one of the most heavily armed nations in the world equipped by the wealth of the entire Western hemisphere, while on the other hand are stone-throwing, slingshot-wielding barefoot children without homes to go back to. On the one hand is an invincible military power and on the other hand is a stateless entity reduced to rubble, a population comprised of refugees and internally displaced people deprived of the most basic essentials for meagre survival. It is not a conflict, but a military onslaught, an assault, an offensive, a genocidal war on civilians- mostly children and women.\nAnother problematic construct that is frequently used in stories from Agence France Presse (AFP) is that what is going on in Gaza is Israel’s ‘retaliatory campaign provoked by the Hamas attack on October 7.’ This conveys the meaning that the incursion into Israeli territory on October 7 was the reason why Israel launched its biggest military onslaught that pales the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on the defenceless people of occupied and besieged Gaza. It ignores the fact that October the 7 was itself a reaction or retaliation to ongoing systematic oppression unleashed on Palestinians since years. It ignores the fact that the Israeli attack on Gaza was well-planned, pre-meditated and orchestrated after decades of military buildup, planning, AI-assisted execution under the supervision of Israel’s ultra conservative rightwing government. Hardline Zionist warmonger Netanyahu presides over a cabinet dominated by radicals who openly reject the two state solution and any prospects of Palestinian statehood. Individuals like finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir had been kicking up war hysteria well before October 7, and have never masked their intent to carry out the wholesale elimination of Palestine. October 7 certainly did not happen in a vacuum.\nSimilarly, referring to the Palestinian resistance as ‘militancy’ or worse, ‘terrorism’ implies that the resistance movement against illegal occupation is a sort of rebellion against a legitimate authority.\nReferring to Israelis who have forcibly occupied and have illegally settled in Palestinian lands as ‘settlers’ ignores the fact that under international law, these ‘settlements’ are a violation and a breach of fundamental rights. It also ignores that these ‘settlers’ are in effect colonizers who use violence and terror to extort territory from those who rightfully own it.\nSubscribe to Our Newsletter\nGet the latest CounterCurrents updates delivered straight to your inbox.\nA careful study of news headlines from mainstream media reveals that the passive voice is often used when referring to Israeli war crimes- for example, saying that a certain number of Palestinian deaths or casualties occurred as a result of a certain operation ‘targeting Hamas’ does not convey the fact that Israel killed children playing in a football field or sheltering in a school, or under treatment at a ramshackle hospital; that the attack was planned knowing fully well that children, families, women, grandmothers would be killed. Often, the ‘Hamas target’ the attack aimed for has no additional details provided at all other than a vague reference, and the death toll of innocent civilians is minimized as ‘collateral damage’ in an operation for self-defence.\nThe overall effect of the use of language to vindicate the Israeli narrative is that of desensitization of the Western public towards the suffering of Palestine and the routinization of atrocities committed against innocent people- as if this was the Palestinian ‘normal’, ongoing indefinitely in the background. In employing language to undermine the cause of Palestinian freedom so deliberately, systematically and strategically, the international media bears responsibility and culpability as a diabolical party to the genocide of Palestinians.\nMaryam Sakeenah is a Pakistan-based independent researcher and freelance writer on International politics, human rights and Islam.
