You have to make the best decisions to overcome them and mine was making sure I made the end of the season to put myself in a position to be selected.”\nEngland sit second in qualifying after last month beginning their campaign with a 1-1 draw at home to Sweden and a 2-0 victory over the Republic of Ireland.\nSarina Wiegman’s reigning European champions are preparing for a crunch double header against early group leaders France, with the upcoming St James’ Park clash followed by next Tuesday’s meeting in Saint-Etienne.\nBright believes back-to-back victories would send out a “massive message”.\n👊 The Boss! pic.twitter.com/qENE7fvseG\n— Lionesses (@Lionesses) May 27, 2024\n“It would be huge,” she said. “It’s an extremely competitive group and France are an incredible team.\n“They pose a lot of threats but, equally, there are things we can do to put the threats on them.\n“We know it’s going to be two tough games. But it will be massive message. As always, we don’t go out for anything other than wins and a good performance.”\nHead coach Wiegman could hand a debut to uncapped Chelsea forward Aggie Beever-Jones against France.\nThat first senior-call-up-vibe. @AggieBjones 😎 pic.twitter.com/afZnkJguDf\n— Lionesses (@Lionesses) May 27, 2024\nBright feels her 20-year-old club-mate, who registered 11 goals and two assists in 17 WSL appearances this term following loan spells with Bristol City and Everton, is a “great addition to the squad”.\n“She’s been exceptional,” Bright said of Beever-Jones. “I think everyone has seen her attitude and mentality and the player she’s developing into.\n“It’s extremely hard going out on loan and coming back and it’s something Aggie’s shown how good it can be for young players.\n“She’s really thrived in our environment and her hard work this season have got her a call up – the runs in behind, her pace, a wonderful technician on the ball but, most importantly, she puts the ball in the back of the net.\n“She’s a great addition to the squad.”",
