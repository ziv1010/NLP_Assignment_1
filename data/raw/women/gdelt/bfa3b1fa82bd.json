Jane has claimed that William's absence from the World Cup was a significant \"misstep\" that could have far-reaching implications for the monarchy's future.\nThe English women's team faced a heartbreaking defeat in the nail-biting final against Spain on Sunday, losing by a slim margin of 1-0. Despite the team's loss, Jane argued that William should have been front row and centre, showing his support for the women's team.\nShe questioned: \"But why the hell didnt William hop on a flight with his young daughter and go in person to the game?\"\nThe 61 year old presenter suggested that the sight of the royals cheering from the stands would not only have been a great PR boost for the monarchy but also a positive gesture towards Australia, where debates continue over whether to abandon the monarchy and become a republic.\nJane added in her column for The Sun: \"His absence was a rare misstep by our future King. After all, whats the point of the monarchy if they don't turn up for such an important event on the world stage?\"\nIn a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Royal expressed his regret for not being able to support the England team in person. She conveyed her heartfelt message saying: \"Lionesses, we want to send you a huge good luck for tomorrow. Were sorry we cant be there in person, but were so proud of everything you've achieved and the millions you've inspired here and around the world. So go out there tomorrow and really enjoy yourselves.\"\nPrincess Charlotte, clutching a football while seated next to her father, chimed in with a simple yet sincere: \"Good luck, Lionesses.\"\nDespite England's disappointing 1-0 defeat on Sunday, William took to X to express his pride, tweeting: \"Although its the result none of us wanted, @Lionesses you have done yourselves and this nation proud. Your spirit & drive have inspired so many people and paved the way for generations to come. Thank you for the footballing memories. Congratulations to Spain. W\"\nHowever, some critics were quick to point out that William, who is not only the heir to the throne but also the President of the FA, should have been present at the clash against Spain. They speculated that his attendance might have been guaranteed had it been the mens team playing.\nHowever, many appeared unimpressed, with one remarking “A letter? what a joke”, and another adding: “Big deal… he should be there.”\nFormer England goalkeeper Pauline Cope voiced her disappointment over William's absence, branding it a shame and stating: \"This should have been pencilled in his diary from day dot, after we won the Euros and qualified for the World Cup.\"\nCulture Secretary Lucy Frazer, who jetted off to Australia alongside Foreign Secretary James Cleverly to witness the match, defended the royal's absence. She stated: \"Prince William, as we all know, is not just a figurehead but the president of the FA and an ardent supporter of the sport. I am aware that he's disappointed about his inability to be present on 23, Aug 2023 but he has conveyed a message of good luck to the Lionesses.\"\n*Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .\n* This article was crafted with the help of an AI tool, which speeds up The Mirror's editorial research.
