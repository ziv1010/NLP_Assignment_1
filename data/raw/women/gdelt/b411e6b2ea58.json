grand final 3-2 at Beischer Park.\nThe two teams had met three times this season with the previously undefeated Reds winning all three encounters: 4-2 and 6-1 in the championship season and 6-3 in the semi-finals of the League Cup.\nHowever, it was Colts that shrugged off their underdog tag to end their 2025 season with some new silverware to add to their trophy cabinet.\n\"That was incredible; the girls really dug deep today in what was a tough game,\" an elated Strathfieldsaye Colts United coach Rebecca Berry said.\n\"We prepared really well for today and were in the right mindset of really wanting it, so it's great we've been able to do it.\n\"Spring Gully had beaten us three times this year and we knew today was going to be really hard, but we felt like we had what it takes and I'm really proud.\"\nCaptain Maddie Ridsdale opened the scoring for Colts in the 18th minute with the first of her two goals, while Berry also slotted a goal for the winners.\nSpring Gully United's two goals were kicked by Skye Barker and competition leading goalscorer Madeline White.\nSunday was only the second loss Spring Gully United has suffered across its 32 games in the championship-Super Cup over the past two years.\nLEAGUE 1 MEN'S RESERVES\n* The League 1 Men's Reserves match between Eaglehawk and Shepparton was halted before full-time when Shepparton walked off the field.\nThe Hawks were leading 1-0 when Shepparton walked off after what had been a fiery game in which there were four red cards issued to Shepparton players.\nThe Bendigo Advertiser contacted Shepparton on Tuesday regarding the walk off, but the club declined to comment.\nWhile the game didn't go the full distance, enough time had elapsed for the result to stand and the Hawks be declared the winners.\n\"We're proud of what of our boys have been able to achieve this year to be both champions and winners of the Super Cup is a great achievement,\" Eaglehawk president Brent Hamblin said.\nBASL president Aaron Shooter said an investigation was likely to be held in response to the match, which ended late in the second half and had required security to intervene.\nBecause of the likely investigation into the match, Hamblin chose not to comment on the Shepparton walk-off.\n\"Firstly, whatever the referee issued on the day (in terms of red cards), the normal outcomes of those will be applied and anything over and above that will be investigated,\" Shooter said.\n\"Football Victoria has taken over grievance and tribunal from BASL this year, so they will follow through their process and the outcomes of those investigations will determine whatever the punishments may be.\n\"It was generally a great day of soccer on Sunday across all competitions, but this just takes away from the day.\n\"We've got tremendous growth happening in the game, but this detracts from it and is definitely not the look we want for the game.\"\nLEAGUE 1 MEN\n* Shepparton United added the League 1 Men's Super Cup title to its League Cup trophy from earlier in the year.\nShepparton United defeated Shepparton South 2-1 after making its move in the first half.\nUnited led 2-0 at half-time following goals to Hassan Alhilfi (28th minute) and Riki Koyanagl (35th) in what proved to be a match-winning seven-minute burst.\nShepparton South closed back within one goal after Jaxan McDonald found the back of the net in the second half in the 66th minute, but United was able to defend its 2-1 lead to win.\nAlthough beaten on Sunday, Shepparton South claimed the championship having topped the ladder after the 14 home and away rounds.\nLEAGUE 2 MEN\n* Spring Gully United put the icing on the cake to its League 2 Men's season with a win over Golden City.\nThe Reds won 2-0 with Noah Kelly kicking both goals in the first half in the 10th and 41st minute to cap a season in which the club completed the championship-Super Cup double.\nLEAGUE 2 WOMEN\n* Castlemaine Goldfields Green produced a dominant performance in the League 2 Women's grand final, defeating Kyneton District Maroon by five goals.\nAfter leading 2-0 at half-time Castlemaine Goldfields banged home four more goals after the break to win 6-1.\nLily Pridham kicked two goals for Castlemaine Goldfields, while Molly Kilgour McCarthy, Carolina Joaquim, Sophie Milton and Brooke Bennett all slotted one.\nLEAGUE 2 MEN'S RESERVES\n* As well as winning the League Men's 1 Reserves, Eaglehawk was also victorious in the League 2 Men's Reserves contest after winning on penalties against La Trobe University, with scores having been initially tied 1-1 at full-time.\nA late goal from La Trobe Uni's Lachlan Hogan to level scores sent the game into penalties, which the Hawks won 3-0.\nGrand final weekend for the BASL also included 13 junior matches played.\nJunior grand final results:\nU12A - Spring Gully Vipers 1 def Kyneton District 0.\n12A Girls - Strathfieldsaye Colts United Black 1 def Kyneton District Maroon 0.\nU12B - Kyneton District
