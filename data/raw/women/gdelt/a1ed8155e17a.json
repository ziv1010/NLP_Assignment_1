However, Haitian fans remain hopeful that this setback will serve as a source of motivation for their beloved player.\nCAP-HAITIEN — Haitian Women’s National Soccer Team superstar, Melchie ‘Corventina’ Dumornay, fell short Saturday of becoming the first Grenadier to lift a UEFA Champions League trophy. Her team, Olympique Lyonnais (OL), lost 2-0 to FC Barcelona in the final. However, many Haitian fans were still satisfied as Dumornay became the first Haitian, man or woman, to play in a final of Europe’s most prestigious soccer competition. They expect this loss will inspire her to elevate her game even further.\n“Losing in a final is a step towards winning one,” stated John Sévère, head coach of the legendary Haitian club, Football Inter Club Association (FICA).\n“Losing a final is never easy,” Sévère added. “But one can lose in a final and soon find themselves in another. We might see Corventina in another final; she could be the perfect example for that.”\nDumornay, hailing from Mirebalais, a commune in the Central Department, has established herself as a promising young woman soccer player on the global stage. Despite Haiti’s multiple crises, the 20-year-old central midfielder has proven that greatness can still emerge from the country. Her remarkable performances in soccer have won the hearts of many Haitians.\nIn the semi-finals of the Champions League, Dumornay was arguably the most valuable player for OL against Paris Saint Germain, scoring goals and providing two assists to help her side win 5-3 on aggregate. Thus, she became the first Haitian player to reach a Champions League final.\nMany Haitians watched the final on Saturday, hoping Dumornay would have made history by becoming the first Haitian to win a UEFA Champions League title. Unfortunately, Lyon lost the match 2-0 to a skillful Barcelona side, which now holds three Champions League titles. Dumornay had a quiet game, perhaps due to playing striker instead of her natural position as central midfield. However, many Haitians, including athletes, were proud to see a compatriot compete in the final of such a prestigious event.\n“When you look at the score, it’s a loss for France but it’s not a loss for Haiti because something big happened,” said Peterson Joseph, forward for the Haitian club Cosmopolites Sportif Club. “A lot of people, a lot of other nations playing soccer at a higher level than us, would have liked to be here.”\nLike Sévère, many Haitians hope that Durmornay will use the loss as motivation to improve and triumph in her next possible final.\n“Tough times like these make you learn who you are, what level you’re at, where you came from, and where you want to reach,” Joseph said. “Times like these make you even stronger.”\nHaitians are already looking forward to next season’s UEFA Women’s Champions League final, hoping that Dumornay’s side will claim the trophy this time around.\n“I think she will win the Champions League one day,” said Michelet Jerome, an electrical engineer based in Port-au-Prince. “She’s young, she’s only 20. I hope she keeps playing football at the level she’s at. All Haitians are behind her. She’s our pride.”",
