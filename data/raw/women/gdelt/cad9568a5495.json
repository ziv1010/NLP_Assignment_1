  "body_text": "Chelsea FCW manager Emma Hayes has confirmed that star striker Sam Kerr will have surgery on her ACL, ruling her out for at least the rest of the season, and probably out for about a year. Surgery was always going to be the likely outcome, but Chelsea had only called it an ACL “injury” that would be assessed, earlier this week.\nSam Kerr reportedly extends contract as Chelsea confirm ACL surgery\nHere to stay, here to recover\n“She’s having surgery today (Thursday). I’m gutted for her and gutted for the team, these things happen in football and she knows that. The important thing is that we are here to support her and the recovery and rehab begins today. [...] Today is about letting Sam know that she’s with her Chelsea family and we’ll look after her.”\n-Emma Hayes; source: Chelsea FC\nAnd speaking of family, Kerr has reportedly also extended her contract by a year, to 2025, before going under the knife, with a further team-option for an additional year beyond that.\nSo hopefully Kerr can make a full recovery and come back strong at some point during the 2024-25 season.",
