  "body_text": "It was lucky number thirteen for Liverpool Women on Sunday, the Reds finally managing a victory in the Women’s Super League by beating Tottenham 2-0 after twelve rounds of futility in a season that has to date managed to out-disappoint what’s been happening on the men’s side of the club.\nEnderby Reacts to Late Winner In Liverpool Women’s First League Win\nLiverpool Women got their first league victory thanks to Mia Enderby’s late brace.\nIt wasn’t enough to get them off the bottom of the league table, but it at least brought them to within a single point of West Ham and Everton and provides some measure of hope that just maybe they’re getting on track and that relegation might not be the inevitable end point of their 2025-26 campaign.\n“I had to come on and make an impact, try to help the girls,” Mia Enderby said following the match that saw the substitute score a brace with goals in the 94th and 95th minute to break the deadlock late and give the Reds the much-needed 2-0 victory after four draws and eight losses worth of disappointment.\n“The ball that Jenna [Clark] put in, I thought I’d throw my body towards it and hopefully get something on it, which I did. Then I just find it so crazy how straight from kick-off I score again. [Manager Gareth Taylor] just said, ‘Run across that front post and you’ll get something on it,’ and that’s what I did.”\nThings don’t get any easier for the Reds in the coming weeks, with two of their next three games against Chelsea and Manchester United, a pair of sides solidly in the top three fight to finish in the Champions League places in a season that sees Manchester City as the runaway leaders and firm title favourites.\nFor the moment, though, all that will matter to the players and fans is Sunday’s victory and the much needed shot of positivity it brings for a side that going into the weekend seemed locked into last place. It will be a tough road to get past one of West Ham or Everton to survive, but tough is better than impossible.",
