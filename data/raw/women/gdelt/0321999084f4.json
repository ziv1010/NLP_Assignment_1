  "body_text": "Welcome to this year’s 30 Under 30, where we put the spotlight on the best and brightest young talent that the industry has to offer.\n“Whether it’s through the creation of high quality stylised art, engaging gameplay designs, or any of the multitude of unique disciplines that help define the gaming industry, MCV/DEVELOP’s 30 Under 30 award is a platform for celebrating the outstanding contributions that new generations of talented individuals have brought to the industry.\nThis award is a fundamental avenue of building a stronger collective mindset that celebrates diversity, inclusion, and growth, for an industry that is constantly evolving. By celebrating each nomination through merit, it helps create a culture of recognition based on excellence, and the impact each individual makes regardless of any external factors.\nAs the size and ambition of this industry grows, it’s important to recognise the efforts and contributions made by some of its younger advocates, and the great wealth of knowledge they bring to a culture of gaming they’ve grown up in. These people will undoubtedly one day be spearheading the future of the games industry itself, through their hard work, dedication, and passion to an industry that’s recognised and celebrated their personal achievements.\nBoth personally, and at EA Playdemic, it is believed that nurturing the unique talent every individual brings into the games industry will pay back more than tenfold, as they grow into experts within their chosen disciplines and help drive the games industry forward. This award is proof that there are up and coming talented individuals ready to make their mark, and they will certainly help others after them develop and push industry standards even higher.\nEach and every individual in this year’s cohort have made outstanding contributions towards their discipline, through their hard work raised standards of quality and excellence, which is why we’re incredibly proud to sponsor this event.\nCongratulations to all nominees and finalists, both in this year’s cohort, and in all of the previous ones.”\n– Shaun Lawrence, Game Design Director, Playdemic\n“MCV/DEVELOP’s 30 Under 30 has taken on a few other forms over the years (an in-magazine feature, an internet article, and an exciting underground party in East London to name a few) but what has never changed is the sheer amount of talent on display from the young people working on video games that it celebrates. It has been our ongoing honour to celebrate the youth of the UK games industry’s collective achievements, and this year is no exception.\nAs usual, our selection process took forever, because there were just so many good people to choose from. Congratulations to everyone selected, and if you didn’t make the list this year, please try again next time, as you’ll no doubt be even more impressive in 2025, and we’ll be looking forward to reading all about it.”\n– Vince Pavey, Editor, MCV/DEVELOP\nThe 2024 30 Under 30 Cohort\nGEORGIA MAE AYLING\nQA Analyst at Rocksteady Studios\nAt just 24 years old, Georgia has made remarkable strides in the games industry. She was the QA feature owner for audio at Rocksteady Studios, and led an international testing effort for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which earned a nomination for audio at the Develop: Star Awards.
