And to Wrighty and Neets for catching me and sorry again.”\nWoods’ fiancee Adam Collard had earlier moved to allay fans’ fears, as the reality television star wrote on X: “Laura is all OK and with the right people. Thank you for all of your kind messages.”\nWoods is a regular host for ITV and TNT Sports of men’s and women’s football matches.\nITV posted on X to wish Woods “a speedy recovery” as did the Lionesses, who won the game 2-0 with goals from Lucia Kendall and a late Alessia Russo penalty.",
