So yes, I mean, how exciting.\n“I mean, when I saw it on the telly I thought, ‘Oh, how lovely, I wonder what that will be?'\"\nIn July, Chadha said that now is the perfect time to make a sequel to Bend It Like Beckham.\nThe 65-year-old filmmaker told the BBC: \"We've been part of changing the game for women, so it felt like this was a good time for me to go back and investigate the characters.\"\nThe England women's football team has enjoyed big success in recent years.\nAlthough Chadha recognises that attitudes towards women's football have changed since the first movie, she thinks that more progress is still needed.\nChadha said: \"A lot has changed since the original movie, but I think that people still don't think that women should play football.\n\"There are people who still don't take it seriously, although the Lionesses are riding high.\n\"I've left it a while, but I thought: look at the Euros, look at the Lionesses.\"\nAnd Chadha hopes the sequel will spread a positive message and \"challenge\" stereotypes.\nThe director explained: \"What I did was say you can do what you want, and you can have it all, and I think that's a really great message to put out again.\n\"I think there's still stuff to say, and stuff to challenge.\"",
