We want to attract the world through sports. Hopefully, by 2034, people will have an extraordinary World Cup.”\nWhile campaigners acknowledge reforms over women’s freedoms in Saudi Arabia in recent years, they also point to a reported rise in the number of executions, the continuing male guardianship system and the imprisonment of activists for online dissent.\nFifa has been urged to secure commitments to improving human rights before formally confirming a Saudi World Cup next year. According to Fifa guidelines, countries bidding to host the event must commit to respect human rights.\n“Any country has room for improvement, no-one’s perfect. We acknowledge that and these events help us reform to a better future for everyone” claimed Prince Abdulaziz.\nWomen in Saudi Arabia were only allowed to enter sports stadia to watch matches in 2018, but since then a professional women’s football league and national women’s team has been created, with more than 70,000 girls now playing regularly.\nHowever, last month Jake Daniels, the UK’s only openly gay active male professional footballer, told the BBC he “wouldn’t feel safe” at the 2034 World Cup.\n“Everyone’s welcome in the kingdom” said Prince Adbulaziz. “Like any other nation we have rules and regulations that everyone should abide by and respect. When we come to the UK we respect the rules and regulations, whether we believe in them or not. Through the 85 events that we have had so far, we haven’t had any issues.”\nIt is widely expected that the 2034 tournament will be in winter to avoid the country’s extreme summer temperatures, as with the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\nBut Prince Abdulaziz said organisers were “definitely studying” whether it could be staged in summer.\n“Why not see what the possibilities are to do it in the summer? Whether it is summer or winter it doesn’t matter for us, as long as we make sure that we [deliver] the right atmosphere to host such an event” he said.\nSaudi Arabia is already building three new stadia for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, but must have 14 venues with capacities of 40,000 or more for the World Cup.\nIn October, human rights group Amnesty raised concerns over the treatment of migrant workers in the kingdom.\nWhen asked if there could be similar issues to the controversy that dogged the Qatar World Cup over workers’ rights, Prince Abdulaziz said: “I assure you it’s not going to be repeated.\n“We have 10 years to work on that, we already started in a lot of the venues, so we have a long time to do it in the right time, in the right process… We’re already developing infrastructure… so we are not required to build a lot more to host such an event.”\nSustainability concerns\nBut environmental groups have expressed concerns over the environmental impact of staging a 48-team event, pointing to the energy required for cooling systems, the desalination of water and carbon-intensive infrastructure projects.\nReferencing various initiatives that the Saudi government says is helping it to diversify away from fossil fuels and reduce omissions, Prince Abdulaziz said: “It’s a mandate on us in the kingdom to make sure that we abide by the international regulations… to make sure that we play our role, to make sure that it’s eco-friendly.”\nHe also rejected criticism that the world’s biggest oil exporter is using sport to distract from its record on sustainability, saying: “I reject that completely because we are taking that seriously and thinking that we are part of this globe… and we have to play our role in that and we are doing that.”\nIn March, Fifa dropped plans for Saudi Arabia’s tourism body to sponsor the Women’s World Cup following a backlash from co-hosts Australia and New Zealand and some players about the proposed deal.\nWhen asked about reports that state-owned oil giant Aramco is in talks over a sponsorship deal with Fifa, Prince Abdulaziz said: “Aramco has been open to a lot of sponsors around the world in sports and they believe in sports because it’s a good platform for them to develop and so on… they’ve sponsored Formula One, they’ve sponsored a lot of events around the world. I don’t see what the issue is with Fifa – or is it just because it’s Fifa?”\nThe bidding process\nConcerns have been raised over the fast-tracked Fifa process that blocked most countries from bidding for the 2034 World Cup, and resulted in Saudi Arabia standing unopposed.\nAt the time of the announcement, fan group ‘Football Supporters Europe’ said it “rolls the red carpet out” for the country.\nBut Prince Abdulaziz rejected any suggestion that the governing body had paved the way for his country.\n“It’s just a theory,” he said. “What we should look at is what benefits the sport of football.\n“Everyone was clear on the regulations, nobody objected to them during [the process] so I don’t think there was any lack of transparency from Fifa. It was only that we were ready to do it and maybe others weren’t. That’s not our fault.\n“As you can see from the announcement of more than 125 federations in support of the Saudi bid… the world also wants us to host 2034.”\nFifa has said that a full evaluation of bids for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups is still to be completed before votes by all national associations at its Congress next year, and said its rotation policy helps to grow the game.\nBBC",
