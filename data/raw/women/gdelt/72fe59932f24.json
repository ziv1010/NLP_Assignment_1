  "body_text": "Coming off an incredibly short hiatus, Emma Hayes and the Chelsea Women showed immense resilience in massive WSL triumph over red-hot Aston Villa.\nHow can you expect anything less from an Emma Hayes led team? In a weekend that was filled with drama on the men’s side, Hayes continued to remind everyone that no matter what happens, she will always be the best manager at the club.\nFollowing the emotions and the physical toll that a miraculous win over Lyon took on this team, the Chelsea Women turned around to take on Aston Villa just three days later. Given how tight the race for the Women’s Super League title is, there is no room to slip up. The defeat to Manchester City minimized the Blues’ margin of error. To kick off two straight matches against Carla Ward’s Aston Villa in the midlands, CFC took care of business in one of the most professional and team-oriented performances of the campaign.\nEvery player that came on played their part as Hayes was forced to make five changes from the historic Champions League win over the French leaders on Thursday. Without Erin Cuthbert, Millie Bright, and Lauren James among others, the Hayes’ side counter-pressed to perfection. Rachel Daly and the Villains were unable to breakthrough its opposition for the first time in any competition since January 26 in the FA Cup against Arsenal.\nAfter a sensational ball in from Guro Reiten, Sam Kerr finishes a brilliant move to net her 50th career WSL goal in the second half.\nPossession was not vital for the Blues at Bescot Stadium on Sunday evening. Hayes’ side was clinical when they needed to be, putting seven of their 14 shots on target. The sheer grit from this team to be able to recover this quickly and come up with a convincing result against arguably the most in-form side in English women’s football right now is why this club has been the leading example of success.\nGuided by another masterclass from Guro Reiten on the left wing, and world-class display in the middle of the pitch from the Serbian Jelena Cankovic, the Blues rose back to second in the table behind Manchester United by one point with a game in hand. Three points separate fourth place Manchester City and first-place United. With two clubs in the top-four winning, Hayes’ side responded the way has whenever it encounters any sort of adversity this season, head-on.\nThe international break provides the club some time to break away from the chaotic chase of three major trophies. Here are three standout players from a display that saw numerous individuals perform at a high-level.",
