Arsenal's Alessia Russo trails just behind with eight, as Manchester United's Elisabeth Terland remains hot on ther tails with seven goals.\nFrom in-the-box strikers to electrifying wingers, the WSL plays host to a plethora of world class talents. The turn of the calendar year has seen even more players raise their game to the next level.\nHere, 90min have ranked the top ten forwards in the WSL right now.\n10. Kelly Gago (Everton)\nKelly Gago signed for Everton in the January transfer window and has made an instant impact upon her arrival in Merseyside.\nScoring three goals in four WSL games, the French striker has added a new dimension to Brian Sorensen's side.\n9. Viviane Asseyi (West Ham)\nViviane Asseyi has been a top performer at West Ham for several seasons now, and this one is no different. With five goals and four assists to her name, Asseyi has been integral to a turnaround of form recently.\nNot only does she make an impact on the scoresheet, but Asseyi brings a creative directness to the Irons front line. Ranked in the top ten per cent for successful dribbles and touches in the opposition box, the threat is clear.\n8. Olivia Smith (Liverpool)\nSigning for Liverpool in the summer of 2024, Olivia Smith has already made her mark on the WSL. The exciting forward brings a fast-paced excitement to the frontline, starting all 13 of the games she has featured in this season.\nThe 20-year-old's immediate impact in Merseyside continues to prove that her ceiling is sky-high.\n7. Nikita Parris (Brighton)\nNikita Parris's summer move to Brighton has shot her back into the England squad for the first time since 2022. Grabbing five goals and two assists for her efforts, she is playing like a forward reborn.\nThe energetic forward has helped to catapult the Seagulls into fifth place in the league standings.\n6. Alessia Russo (Arsenal)\nThe England number nine is back in form after enduring a turbulent start to the 2024/25 season. Picking up eight goals and two assists during the campaign so far, Alessia Russo has become a new player under the reign of Renee Slegers.\nThe striker's hold up play is unparalleled, providing the Gunners with a strong outlet at the top of the pitch. Russo's constant improvement arrives at a perfect time for England ahead of Euro 2025.\n5. Catarina Macario (Chelsea)\nWith forward talent like Mayra Ramirez, Guro Reiten and Johanna Rytting Kaneryrd in the ranks, it takes a lot to be a standout player at Chelsea, but Cat Macario is exactly that.\nHer versatile presence means that Sonia Bompastor can deploy her in central midfield or at the top of the pitch, allowing Chelsea to threaten from all angles.\nMacario's ball carrying ability and exciting tenacity sets her apart from her peers, making her one of the most exciting forwards in the WSL.\n4. Mariona Caldentey (Arsenal)\nArsenal's big summer signing may have taken a few moments to click into gear, but now that she has arrived at her best there is no stopping Mariona Caldentey.\nThe Spanish forward's ability to drift between the channel and the midfield is one of a kind, causing real issues for opposition defences. She runs like the ball is glued to her foot, adding another dimension to the Gunners frontline.\n3. Khadija Shaw (Man City)\nDespite a stretch away from the pitch due to an injury picked up prior to Christmas, Khadija Shaw has returned like she was never gone.\nThe Manchester City striker continues to write the narrative that she may be the best that the WSL has ever seen, scoring three goals in her last two appearances for the club.\n2. Elisabeth Terland (Man Utd)\nElisabeth Terland's departure from Brighton came with buckets of expectation following her impressive 2023/24 WSL season. The Norway international has provided Manchester United fans with exactly what she promised and has lit up the pitch over recent months.\nTerland's recent brace against Crystal Palace marked her seventh goal of the WSL season, topped off with four assists to go along with them.\n1. Mary Fowler (Man City)\nAs we are talking about recent form, it would be impossible to look beyond Mary Fowler. Fowler raised the levels at Manchester City in Shaw's absence, picking up five goals and three assists over just six games.\nThe 22-year-old continues to display her potential, playing with a distinct maturity far beyond her years. Now tied level with Shaw for goals and assists combined, this young Australian is becoming one of the league's brightest talents.",
