  "body_text": "When Star Trek: Discovery introduced three Original Series characters in its second season to joyful fan reception, it seemed fairly inevitable that we would revisit their world in more depth – and now, the second season of their very own series is here.\nSet between the early seasons of Discovery and The Original Series, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds sees Discovery's Anson Mount, Ethan Peck and Rebecca Romijn returning to the USS Enterprise as Captain Christopher Pike, science officer Spock and first officer Una Chin-Riley ('Number One') respectively.\nStrange New Worlds' cast also features Celia Rose Gooding as Nyota Uhura (who is a young cadet when we catch up with her here), Jess Bush as a younger version of the ship's nurse Christine Chapel, and Babs Olusanmokun as a younger Dr Joseph M'Benga.\nWhat to Read Next\nThey're joined by Christina Chong's chief of security La'an Noonien-Singh, plus Melissa Navia as Enterprise helmsman Erica Ortegas. And season two will also introduce James T Kirk himself as a recurring character, played by Paul Wesley following his cameo in the first season finale.\nA key theme that has run through Strange New Worlds so far is Pike, having experienced a terrifying vision of his own future, pondering whether he can change his own destiny and that of others around him. The second season will also feature a crossover with animated series Star Trek: Lower Decks.\nHere's how you can watch as the show returns to streaming.\nHow to watch Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 2\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds' second season premieres today (Thursday, June 15), streaming exclusively on Paramount+ in countries including the UK and the US. New episodes will arrive every Thursday after that, with the season finale expected to premiere on August 17.\nIn the UK, new Paramount+ customers can enjoy a 7-day free trial of the service, and after that it will cost £6.99 per month, or £69.90 per year.\nPricing for the service in the US differs, depending on how you feel about adverts and whether you want to pay extra for the Showtime programming add-on. There are four main options:\n- Essential tier: $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year\n- Premium tier: $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year\n- Essential tier with Showtime: $11.99 per month or $119.99 per year\n- Premium tier with Showtime: $11.99 per month, or $119.99 per year\nAll US plans open up access to a vast library of TV shows and movies, plus live sport such as NFL and men's UEFA Champions League coverage, and 24/7 news via CBSN. Note that Essential tiering doesn't include your local live CBS station.\nThe Premium tier has very limited ads (with some appearing in live TV and \"a few shows\" according to Paramount itself). It also opens up download access and enables you to watch your local CBS station live.\nAs you'd expect, adding Showtime to your plan gives you access to its library.\nThe TV shows and movies you can watch vary slightly depending on where you are in the world. But in the UK, titles include Yellowstone, Mayor of Kingstown, Yellowjackets, Kiefer Sutherland's Rabbit Hole, and RuPaul's Drag Race spin-off Queen of the Universe.\nUK customers will also find Showtime dramas like Chiwetel Ejiofor and Naomie Harris' The Man Who Fell to Earth, and The First Lady – starring Viola Davis as Michelle Obama, Michelle Pfeiffer as Betty Ford, and Gillian Anderson as Eleanor Roosevelt – on the service. As mentioned above, US customers can access these by paying an additional fee as part of their monthly or yearly subscription.\nAnd, of course, you'll be able to enjoy lots of other Star Trek titles including classic movies, plus films ranging from the Top Gun movies to the Scream series.\nIn the US, customers can also enjoy selected CBS Sports programming including men's Serie A, UEFA Champions League and Europa League football (all of which sit on BT Sport in the UK), plus NFL coverage, Women's Super League football, golf tournaments including The Masters, and Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket.\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds season 2 streams on Paramount+, with new episodes premiering on Thursdays.\nKate (they/she) is a freelance writer, editor, digital editorial trainer and data technician who first joined Digital Spy as an overnight freelance sub-editor in January 2011, after studying a postgraduate diploma in journalism at Salford University while working part-time as a social researcher.\nIn July 2013, Kate joined the DS staff team as chief sub-editor and following six years as the site's managing editor, their role expanded to incorporate Hearst UK's entertainment portfolio (including Digital Spy and its sibling titles Best and Inside Soap) between late 2024 and early 2026.\nKate has worked as a writer and editor since 2006, with bylines syndicated across the Hearst network and at organisations including Metro.

Over the years, she has contributed to coverage of many, many Prime Days and Black Friday/Cyber Monday, and was part of the team that launched the DS weekly TV newsletter in November 2019 – followed by the Top of the Shops e-commerce newsletter in May 2024.\nKate's screen passions include Taskmaster (their biggest career regret remains turning down the opportunity to visit the house), nature documentaries, and live sport (up there with the greatest of all soap operas although if asked to choose, it's Corrie… every time).\nHer highlights while working at DS have included interviewing Stevie Nicks on the red carpet for her documentary In Your Dreams, sitting at a press roundtable with Formula 1 commentary icon Murray Walker, watching a life-sized LEGO car being driven around Silverstone, writing an album-by-album retrospective of Lady Gaga's genre-defying career for Living Legends, and raising awareness of receiving and understanding a late-in-life ADHD diagnosis through the lens of Bianca and Freddie's EastEnders storyline.\nUpon remembering to log off the internet, Kate enjoys live theatre, dance and comedy, appreciating nature, baking (badly), tending a recently-rented allotment (equally badly) and pampering one very spoiled rescue cat named Jolene.\nLinkedIn",
