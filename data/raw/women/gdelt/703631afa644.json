  "body_text": "END OF AN ERA\nLongtime Rice Village day spa and salon closing after ravaging fire ends 67-year run\nAfter 67 years of providing indulgent service and experiences, Beautique Day Spa & Salon, one of Rice Village's most cherished establishments, is bidding farewell to its iconic location. The decision to move, ownership notes in press materials, comes in the wake of a recent fire that ravaged the interior of the building.\nThe 22,000-square-foot day spa, a beloved destination in the shopping district for nearly seven decades, has been a cornerstone of Rice Village, drawing in loyal customers with its exceptional offerings.\n\"Over the decades, Beautique has been the place where countless memories were made, friendships formed, and stories told,\" Beautique founder Frank Burge Sr. observed in a statement. \"We are immensely grateful to the Rice Village team, our loyal customers, and employees who have crossed our path at this location and look forward to greeting them all at our new location in the near future.\"\nThe move became necessary following a mid-July incident that saw a fire erupt on the spa's second floor. Although fire crews successfully extinguished the flames, the extensive damage prompted the relocation.\nA new location on Weslayan is currently under construction and is set to open its doors in the early months of 2024.\nFounded by Frank Sr. and Ginny Burge in August, 1956, Beautique Day Spa & Salon has grown from a 1,000-square-foot Rice Village salon to a 22,000-square-foot operation. The Burge children, Susan Finn and Frank Burge, Jr., have since taken over for their parents to usher in a new era of salon service.\nNoting the shutter and the salon's legacy, Rice Village bid farewell and offered thanks to the spa for its service to generations of loyal customers via a press statement.\nBeautique's closing marks the end of an era for Rice Village customers. But now, a new generation can look forward to pampering at the spa's new location.",
