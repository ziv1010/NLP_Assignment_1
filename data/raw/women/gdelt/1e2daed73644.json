  "body_text": "Manchester United Women reached the final of the FA Cup this weekend to the delight of 6800 fans in Leigh Sports Village. They held on for a 2-1 victory over Chelsea, beating the current Champions for the first time in their 11 meetings.\nUnited’s goal scorers, Lucia Garcia and Rachel Williams were visibly emotional at the final whistle as they spoke to club media, with the sound of their team-mates’ dressing room celebrations audible in the background.\n“I’m so tired but so happy,” Garcia gushed. “It’s the first time we’ve beaten Chelsea and the best time to do it because we’re through to the final for the second year in a row.”\nGarcia was surprised to learn that her goal came just 42 seconds into the game after Leah Galton won the ball and charged down the left. She delivered a cross into the box and Garcia headed it past Hannah Hampton.\n“Wow! It was an amazing moment but we have to work hard now to win the final at Wembley,” Garcia said.\nWilliams doubled United’s lead with another header in the 23rd minute. Ella Toone provided the assist.\n“It was a rewrite of last year’s final and there’s no easy route to the final,” Williams said. “To put in the hard work we have, the staff, the players the fans, they were absolutely brilliant.\n“We’re going to enjoy today and then look forward to the final and hopefully, fingers crossed, we might just be able to win it.”\nIt was a gritty performance from United, who had to defend resolutely for much of the game. Lauren James clawed one back just before half-time but United held on for the win.\nIt was an intense and physical game which Mary Earps described to the BBC post match as being “horrible” but United found a way to win.\nWilliams continued: “The manager wanted to change things up. I’ve been in this league a long time, I’m not bothered about playing pretty football. If we have to play long ball, pretty football, pattern football, you play whatever you need to win games. We wanted to have players that were not only going to work hard on the ball but off it as well.”\nIn the second half, Williams took a ball to the face as she tried to prevent Hampton from hoofing it up the field.\n“A big part of my game is physicality, a lot of people were saying about how I took the ball in the face off the keeper and you just get on with it. I’ll do it, because what’s more important is that we do our jobs out there and we got our rewards today.”\nWilliams praised Earps for her “brilliant” performance as she made seven big saves to maintain United’s lead.\n“That’s why she’s had the accolades she’s had over the last few years because when you need your keeper to step up in big moments she’s done that.”\nMaya Le Tissier posted on social media following the game that it was 89 minutes of defending for United and again Williams beamed with pride as she spoke of her team-mate.\n“Right at the end Maya’s doing diving headers, nearly getting kicked in the face. I think with the ups and downs of this season that we’ve had, when this is what you’ve got left to play for, I ain’t going home tonight sitting on the sofa thinking I wish we’d done this, I wish we’d done that, we’ve given absolutely everything we can and that’s the reward.”\nAfter the game, the club posted footage of the players dancing and singing in the dressing room.\nTAKE ME HOMEEEEE! 😍#MUWomen || #WomensFACup pic.twitter.com/tDQKFHBAkf\n— Manchester United Women (@ManUtdWomen) April 14, 2024\nWilliams joked, “Zel says drinks on gaffer but I say two days off because after that, my body’s going to be battered!”\nUnited will now switch their focus to the league as they host Tottenham next weekend in what will feel like a practice for the final as Spurs beat Leicester to guarantee their place at Wembley on May 12th.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
