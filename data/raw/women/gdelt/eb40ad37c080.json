  "body_text": "A firing Caitlin Foord and a return for Sam Kerr was exactly what the doctor ordered against Denmark.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nAfter positive performances so far, Foord finally got her reward with her first goal of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup as Australia beat Denmark 2-0 in Sydney on Monday evening.\nDenmark had the run of things early but Warilla junior Caitlin Foord opened both the scoring and her 2023 World Cup account in the 29th minute in front of 75,784 supporters.\nIn doing so, the Shellharbour based attacker became the 10th multiple goalscorer for the Matildas in Women's World Cup football.\nThe night also provided a sight all Australian supporters wanted to see. The return of Sam Kerr. She was given over 10 minutes against the Danes - sparking delirium in the stadium and across the country.\nIt may prove to be crucial competitive game time with the quarter finals approaching on Saturday.\nHayley Raso doubled the advantage midway through the second half to see the Matildas reach the next stage of the tournament.\nThe Matildas will have the chance to re-create history after reaching the quarter finals of the World Cup for the fourth time ever.\nAustralia have reached the quarters three times previously in their World Cup history but have never gotten past that stage. They will be gunning to break that duck against either France or Morocco on Saturday evening in Brisbane.\nDenmark striker Rikkie Madsen had a golden chance to silence the home crowd early on after a delightful ball into the box. The number 17 could not get enough contact on the ball however inside the first 10 minutes.\nThe Danes were proving lethal on the counter from the off. Captain Pernille Harder led a marauding run into a shot which fell into the grateful arms of Mackenzie Arnold.\nThe Europeans were looking extremely dangerous inside the first 20 minutes. Janni Thomsen nearly bamboozled Arnold directly from a corner but the West Ham stopper was alert enough to get a foot to the ball.\nAll the chances mattered little as Stadium Australia erupted midway through the first half after Foord was sent on her way by Mary Fowler and the Arsenal forward made no mistake to give the Aussies the 1-0 lead going into the break.\nAnd midway through the second half, the result was beyond doubt thanks to the in-form Raso.\nSome time and space in the box for Fowler proved costly for Denmark as she crossed to Emily van Egmond - who set it up on a platter for Raso to tuck away in the bottom corner for 2-0.\nThat was how the scoreline stayed. Now Australia will await the result of the France vs Morocco round of 16 match on Tuesday evening in Adelaide.",
