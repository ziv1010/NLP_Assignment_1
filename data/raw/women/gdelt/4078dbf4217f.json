Scotland and Ukraine are the other past qualifiers in League B – which, like League C, carries play-off berths.\nAs well as competing for finals and play-off spots, teams in all three leagues are also playing for promotion and relegation ahead of the next edition of the UEFA Women's Nations League, beginning in 2025.\nRoad to Women's EURO 2025\nQualifying league stage matchdays 1 & 2: 3–9 April 2024\nQualifying league stage matchdays 3 & 4: 29 May–4 June 2024\nQualifying league stage matchdays 5 & 6: 10–16 July 2024\nPlay-off draw: 19 July 2024\nPlay-off round 1 (2 legs): 23–29 October 2024\nPlay-off round 2 (2 legs): 27 November–3 December 2024\nFinals draw: 16 December 2024\nFinals: 2–27 July 2025 (Switzerland)\nHow qualifying works\nLeague phase\nIn qualifying, as per the league stage of the Nations League, teams compete in groups of four or three teams (League C) and over six matchdays between April and July, with each team playing one home match and one away match against all the other teams in their group.\nFor qualifying itself, the top two teams in each League A group will gain places in the July 2025 finals alongside hosts Switzerland (who will compete in League B although their automatic qualification is assured). The remaining seven spots will be decided by two rounds of play-offs in October and November/December.\nPlay-offs\nThe first round of the play-offs is split into two paths. In one path, the teams finishing third and fourth in League A will play the five group winners and three best-ranked runners-up in League C. The eight winners progress to the second round.\nIn the other first round path, the four group winners and two best-ranked runners-up in League B will be drawn into six ties against the remaining two runners-up and four third-placed teams in League B. The six winners progress to the second round.\nIn the second round, the teams from both paths come together and will be drawn into seven ties, with seeding for the seven highest-ranked teams based on the European Qualifiers overall league rankings. The seven winners progress to the final tournament.\nThe play-off paths will be adjusted as necessary to take into account the performance of Women's EURO hosts Switzerland, who will compete in League B but are guaranteed a slot in the final tournament.\nIf Switzerland finish as a League B winner, runner-up or in third place, the best-ranked fourth-placed team of League B will complete the round 1 path 2 play-off line-up and the draw seeding for the six ties will be adjusted accordingly.\nPromotion and relegation\nPromotion and relegation will also be at stake ahead of the next UEFA Women's Nations League, beginning the 2025–27 competition cycle:\n• The winners, runners-up and third-placed teams of League A stay in League A;\n• The runners-up and three best-ranked third-placed teams in League B stay in League B;\n• The runners-up, third-placed and fourth-placed teams in League C stay in League C;\n• The winners of Leagues B and C will be promoted to the next league;\n• All fourth-placed teams in Leagues A and B, as well as the lowest-ranked third-placed team of League B, will be relegated to the next league.",
