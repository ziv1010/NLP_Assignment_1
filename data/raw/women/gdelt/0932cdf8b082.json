  "body_text": "Time is the great gift of retirement. It cushions our grief. It allows us to absorb new miseries and embrace strategies for aging well.\nI recently visited a 97-year-old friend in a skilled nursing facility recovering from a broken leg. She has the vibrancy of a person 30 years younger. I asked the secret to her sparkle. She answered, “Curiosity.”\nCuriosity is tough when constant change, surging loss and shifting aches occupy our thoughts. My friend asks, what kind of flowers did I bring from my garden? She reads AARP magazine. She plays bridge and mahjong.\nMy curiosity focuses on pockets of joy and opportunities for levity to distract me from the political chaos upending our country. I stalk the next interesting thing.\nThe hallmarks of aging well appear to align as a patchwork of Cs, Gs and Ps – curiosity and connection; generosity, gratitude and grit; planning, purpose and patience. That seems like a bucket of work when what we need now are comfortable clothes and easy living.\nConnections with family, friends and faith are pivotal. Who are you going to call when your sciatica flares, you need suggestions for a Netflix binge or have existential questions that plague your sleep?\nMy parents and brother are gone. I am the sole custodian of my childhood. I wish I had asked my parents about their fears fleeing St. Petersburg and Yalta, their ordeal as refugees in the long queue from Paris to Portugal, as immigrants to America in 1940. I wish I had asked why my mother became a dental surgeon in the 1920s when few women did so.\nI stay connected to friends through text, phone and email; through moves, milestones and a Christmas card list of 100 contacts, launched in 1986. I am sad when an envelope is returned stamped, “Addressee unknown” or “Unable to forward.”\nWe should nurture cultural traditions. Vintage memories are preserved in holiday celebrations, recipes, heirlooms, photos and impassioned storytelling. I still honor a custom from my Russian heritage. Before leaving on a trip, we sit quietly together for one minute. This is how we say, “Godspeed and be safe.” The ritual was common among Russians who endured revolution, famine and war. I believe it is mentioned in a book by Leo Tolstoy.\nThis is a time for gratitude and generosity. Cherish the songbirds that herald each new day. Answer the call of charitable giving. I am passionate about the conservation mission of the World Wildlife Fund to protect magnificent megafauna from extinction. I am grateful that I can provide generous support.\nEstate planning is the basis of a comfortable future. Make a comprehensive plan for heirs who manage the distribution of our worldly goods when they are emotionally distraught. Include a medical directive, a durable power of attorney, a birth certificate, “transfer on death” forms, passwords, burial instructions and even a draft obituary.\nMy mom’s earnest purpose as an octogenarian was to see my son graduate from kindergarten, middle school and high school. With a commitment to healthy habits, she lived to 96. By then, my son was in college, successfully managing his time, classwork, money and laundry.\nMy beloved grandkids are my reasons to be. With immeasurable joy, I watch my 8-year-old ray of sunshine play flag football. l delight when my 5-year-old beam of moonlight brings me ladybugs, caterpillars and roly-polys she finds in the garden. Their interests and activities signal that all is normal on the home front, and the next generation of my family is flourishing.\nAging well requires patience and grit drawn from hard-won wisdom. It is okay to let go of associations that are no longer meaningful. It is not too late to make new friends. Watching a garden grow brings joy. Comfort, convenience, simplicity and quiet are keys to serenity. Only God knows what is around the corner.\nPeople know me as a resourceful, fact-driven, solution-oriented shoe fashionista whose attempts at humor often fall short. All true, although my 3-inch heels of yesteryear are now replaced with sensible slip-ons.\nWhen I go, I hope to be remembered with affection as thoughtful and kind; caring, creative and not too clever by half. In lieu of flowers, please contribute to the World Wildlife Fund.\nEllen Rony is a longtime resident of Tiburon.",
