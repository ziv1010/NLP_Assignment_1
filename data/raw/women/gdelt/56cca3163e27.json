Do it a thousand times,\" Ghosh posted on X.\n\"But giving wrong information, distorted assumptions, fake audio, purposeful inciting posts, names and photos of the deceased, the police will warn you\", he said.\nKolkata Police on Sunday summoned TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, hours after he demanded that the CBI interrogate Kolkata Police commissioner and former principal of Kar Medical College and Hospital.\nKolkata Police have also issued summonses to former BJP MP Locket Chatterjee and two well known doctors for allegedly spreading rumours and disclosing the identity of the woman doctor who was raped and murdered at R G Kar Medical College.\nThe TMC minister set off a political fire on Sunday by backing his party supremo with a warning, who after the horrific death of the trainee doctor has come under heat from various quarters for handling of law and order.\nAccording to the clipping that is going viral on social media, the TMC minister is seen losing his cool and threatening to break the finger of those abusing and pointing fingers at Banerjee on social media.\nThe BJP national spokesperson in an apparent reference to opposition attacking BJP over \"fascism\", chose to accuse the TMC of the same. \"This is real fascism,\" he said in the post on X.\n\"Dictator Didi minister Udayan Guha who insulted & mocked Women’s 14th August midnight march now gives chilling warning 'If you point finger at CM, fingers will be broken', \" he added.\nPoonawala also referred to the recent developments in the state such as cancelling of the football match, violence against protesters by state police, the recent sacking of TMC spokesperson Shantanu Sen for \"speaking on Sandip Ghosh\".
