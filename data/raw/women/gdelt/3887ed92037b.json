  "body_text": "Florida State football, recruiting news: Change is coming but not before the season is over\nFSU Hoops gets opening night victory\nMike Norvell is focused on FSU’s three remaining opportunities to get better but based on Mike Norvell’s press conference from yesterday; significant changes are likely to be coming once the game against the Florida Gators hits 0:00.\nI can tell you that there’s going to be — there’s going to be a change in what we’ve seen from this year to this next year coming up. But right now my entire focus is going to be on what’s ahead for these next three games, to go be the best we can be.\nA tall order for FSU this Saturday at Notre Dame as the depth chart is virtually the same as last week.\nThe worst season since FSU joined the conference is worse than FSU’s first 12 years in the ACC combined:\nKnowing when to walk away from football after dealing with concussions is a tough discussion for any player.\nMike Norvell wasn’t the only one blindsided by how bad FSU is this year; everyone in the media was too.\nI’m not going to lie to you, Tony, I’ve been completely shocked to see the Seminoles take this big of a step back. I thought at worst this was an 8-4 team this season that would endure losses because it couldn’t score points like it did last year. But this drop-off has been epic and it exposed Mike Norvell’s struggles on the recruiting trail coming back to bite him.\nIt’s clear Norvell has a lot of work in front of him. He has to make changes on his staff, and the program has to recruit better. But I also don’t feel like the cupboard is completely bare. There is some talent to work with if Norvell can keep guys from leaving via the transfer portal. It’s just going to take some excellent evaluation and portal work. — Navarro\nRecruiting:\nFour-star RB and UGA commit Ousmane Kromah was on campus this weekend:\nZach Blostein’s article about a necessary shift to high school recruiting made some good points.\nOther Sports:\nThere’s no better way to open the season than setting a new school record for points in a game:\nA nice start to the season for Men’s hoops as well.\nAlumni:\nA little Nole on Nole crime here as Jalen Ramsey ripped it away from Keon Coleman to force the interception:\n- Florida State Football\n- Florida State football injuries\n- Florida State football news\n- Florida State Football Recruiting\n- Florida State football schedule\n- Florida State Men's Basketball\n- Florida State men's basketball news\n- Florida State softball\n- Florida State Softball news\n- Florida State Women's basketball\n- Florida State women's basketball news\n- FSU Football Practice Reports\n- NFL Noles",
