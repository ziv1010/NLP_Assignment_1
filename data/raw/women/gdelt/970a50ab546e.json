  "body_text": "THE 2023 FA Cup final will kick off at the traditional time of 3pm, the Football Association has confirmed.\nThe showpiece match on 3 June is a Manchester derby for the first time in the competition’s 151-year history.\nThe clash of the north-west rivals led the Metropolitan Police to deem it a high-risk match and insist upon a kick-off time no later than 4.45pm.\nOn Wednesday afternoon the FA confirmed a 3pm kick-off time, the first occasion the final has been a 3pm kick-off since 2011.\nIt throws up a clash with the Uefa Women’s Champions League final, which kicks off in Eindhoven at 3pm local time. Arsenal and Chelsea are in the semi-finals against Wolfsburg and Barcelona respectively.\nThe FA confirmed the Cup winners would receive £2million in prize money, with the losing finalists banking £1million.\nITV’s coverage of the final will be immediately preceded by the Derby from Epsom. The race will start at 1.30pm, with coverage starting at 12.30pm and FA Cup final build-up starting at 2.15pm.\nThe premier Classic was originally due to be run at 4.30pm, but has been brought forward to avoid a clash with the Wembley showpiece.",
