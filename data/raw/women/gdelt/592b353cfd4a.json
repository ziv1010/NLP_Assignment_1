His death, which has been ruled a suicide, happened just moments after he sent a text to his girlfriend in which he said: \"I love you and always will... I am on the motorway... see you in the next life and goodbye\".\nDesperate family members tracked the location on Alex's phone, with dad Peter rushing to find him on the slip road. But when he arrived he found Alex's car empty - with his beloved son's body lying 20 yards from the car, reports LancsLive.\nREAD MORE: I went to a women-only, sober rave and I think it might be time to give up booze for good\nRecalling the events leading up to his desperate journey to the lip road at Junction 31, where Alex was, Peter said: \"I went home and his car wasn't on the drive. I got a screenshot from Ellie from Find My iPhone which showed his phone was between the slip road and the carriageway.\n\"I went home and told [Alex's mum] Caroline what Ellie had said but by that stage he'd been dead half an hour. Then I went to Junction 31a and headed southbound. There were no blues and twos and I thought 'that's good'. Then I came off at Junction 31 and saw his car between the slip road and the carriageway. I jumped out and ran across using my phone as a torch but he wasn't in the car.\n\"I found him 20 yards from the car. Imagine that - finding your own son dead.\"\nAlex had been killed instantly in the collision and an inquest held on Thursday (March 2) heard that he had deliberately positioned his car and aimed it at the crash barrier before accelerating up to 88mph and crashing. Area Coroner Chris Long concluded Alex's death was a suicide but after the hearing Peter and Caroline said they believed their son had been led to take his own life because of messages he had received which they consider to be bullying.\n\"If you're going through a crisis then speak to good friends or family,\" mum Caroline said. \"I don't want any other parents to go through what we went through.\"\nPeter said: \"We wake up every day with a wrecking ball through our lives.\"\nPeter and Caroline said that Alex had been planning for the future, having recently bought Coldplay tickets and booked a trip to Milan, and that they believe it was a \"heat of the moment thing\" that led him to deliberately crash his car. Alex had been desperately trying to contact his girlfriend after they had argued earlier in the night.\n\"He had so much to live for and he loved life,\" Peter said. \"He was only three months away from finishing his apprenticeship at BAE. He had the whole world in front of him.\"\nCaroline was so moved after reading a comment posted online from Alex's mentor that she contacted him directly via Facebook. \"He replied and said 'I wasn't just saying it, I meant every word, he was one in a million',\" she recalled.\nGrowing up Alex was an avid football fan and enjoyed \"all sports\" his parents said. He was well-liked at school and teachers from both his primary and secondary school attended his funeral.\nHe coached a football team and after his death Preston North End FC held a tribute during the game against Burnley on September 13. The club said on Twitter at the time: \"Everyone at the club was deeply saddened to learn of the tragic passing of PNE fan Alex Tyson at the age of just 19. Our thoughts are with all of Alex’s family and friends at this incredibly sad time.\"\nAlex used to go to a pub quiz with his dad and Peter's friends once a week and was known for his general knowledge which included being able to identify all 195 national flags. Before his death he had spent time travelling and enjoyed visiting countries such as Croatia, Barcelona and Amsterdam.\nHis \"greatest passion\" was Preston North End and had held a season ticket since he was a young boy. He was involved in the fans group, Preston Supporters Collective, and ex-chairman Peter Ridsdale was among the many people who attended Alex's funeral.\n\"He just loved sports,\" mum Caroline said. \"There is a hole in our lives that will never be filled and we miss him every single day.\"\nREAD NEXT:\n- 'It used to be beautiful': The Curry Mile restaurateurs who say it's 'gone so downhill'\n- Torment of wife of missing dad as trolls and 'social media detectives fuel speculation'\n- Boy, 15, in a serious condition after stabbing outside McDonalds\n- 'The man was a legend' - Tributes paid to man who died after being hit by digger at industrial estate\n- The pretty village with no shops and one pub an hour from Greater Manchester",
