  "body_text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Bobby Witt Jr. drove in three runs and Michael Wacha struck out six in seven innings to lead the Kansas City Royals to an 8-3 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. Maikel Garcia had an RBI single, Witt added an RBI triple and Salvador Perez hit a two-run, opposite field homer to right in the Royals’ four-run seventh inning. The victory clinched the season season for Kansas City for the first time since 2016. The teams split the two-game series. Paul Goldschmidt hit a 430-foot, two-run home run, his 18th of the season, for the Cardinals.\nPHOENIX (AP) — Arizona Diamondbacks All-Star second baseman Ketel Marte left Saturday night’s game against the Philadelphia Phillies with a left ankle contusion. Philadelphia catcher Garrett Stubbs lined a hit off third baseman Eugenio Suárez’s glove and stretched it into a double. Stubbs’ head-first slide landed him on the back of Marte’s left leg as the fielder was on his knee, and he fell to the ground in pain. He eventually left the field under his own power with a trainer and was replaced by Kevin Newman.\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Kansas City Chiefs receiver Marquise “Hollywood” Brown was taken to a local hospital with a dislocated clavicle, a potentially significant setback for the two-time defending Super Bowl champions. Brown, who signed a one-year, $7 million contract in March, landed awkwardly on his shoulder following an 11-yard reception on the opening play of a 26-13 preseason loss at Jacksonville. Coach Andy Reid says “he’ll miss some time.” Reid says it's the same injury — a sternoclavicular joint dislocation — that sidelined former Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill for four games early in 2019. Coincidentally, Hill was injured on the same field in the regular-season opener that year.\nGREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Needing a victory to keep his FedEx Cup playoffs streak alive, Matt Kuchar shot his second straight 6-under 64 on Saturday to take the second-round lead in the rain-delayed Wyndham Championship. Kuchar is the only player to reach every postseason in FedEx Cup history. The top 70 will qualify for the playoff opener next week in Tennessee, with the 46-year-old Kuchar 113th. With players allowed to lift, clean and place their golf balls in the fairways because of the wet conditions at Sedgefield Country Club, Kuchar moved up the leaderboard with late birdies on Nos. 5-7. Max Greyserman was a stroke back along with Cameron Young and Chad Ramey. Greyserman shot 60, leaving a 50-foot birdie putt 2 feet short on the final hole.\nOLYMPICS\nPARIS (AP) — Stephen Curry was thinking about this two years ago, after winning his fourth NBA title. The only thing left for him to win was Olympic gold. And in the ultimate moment, he made sure that medal would be his. The U.S. is atop the international men's basketball world once again, after Curry scored 24 points and led the way to a 98-87 win over France in the final at the Paris Games on Saturday night. It was the fifth consecutive gold medal for the U.S. — and the 17th in 20 all-time appearances for the Americans at the games.\nSAINT-DENIS, France (AP) — The American men eked out a relay win in the 4x400 meters just 15 minutes before a star-studded U.S. women's team dominated the field Saturday night. Those were the final two golds of an Olympic track meet dominated by the United States. America won 14 golds and 34 overall medals. Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Gabby Thomas - the gold medalists in the 400 hurdles and 200 meters - handed a 30-meter lead to Alexis Holmes, who didn’t lose any ground. The 34 medals were the most for the U.S. at a non-boycotted Games since the early 20th century, when there were more events and fewer countries. The 14 golds are the most in a non-boycotted Olympics since 1968.\nPARIS (AP) — The International Gymnastics Federation restored Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu to third in the women’s floor exercise final on Saturday, potentially forcing American gymnast Jordan Chiles to return the bronze she won in the event. It’s unclear whether Chiles will be forced to return her medal. The federation, known as FIG, said while it has restored the initial order of finish — with Barbosu third, Romanian teammate Sabrina Maneca-Voinea fourth and Chiles fifth — the organization added that the allocation of medals was up to the International Olympic Committee.\nPARIS (AP) — The U.S. women’s soccer team has won its fifth Olympic gold medal by beating Brazil 1-0 in the final at the Paris Games. Mallory Swanson’s early second-half goal secured the win and closed out an undefeated run to the title in the team's first international campaign under new coach Emma Hayes. The Americans hadn’t won Olympic gold since the 2012 London Games. The result is more heartbreak for Brazil and star Marta. The six-time world player of the year has never won a Women’s World Cup or an Olympics. This is expected to be her last major international tournament. It was the third victory for the United States over Brazil in an Olympic final.\nPARIS (AP) — The one question Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is repeatedly asked about before her city hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics is traffic. Bass has declared it will be the “no-car games” and venues will only be accessible by public transportation. It will take more than 3,000 buses and LA 2028 organizers will need to bring them in from all over the country. Additionally, Bass wants to collaborate with major Los Angeles businesses to encourage employees to work remotely during a 17-day period to reduce the number of cars on the roads. Bass will receive the Olympic flag from Paris' mayor during Sunday's closing ceremony.\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France (AP) — Lydia Ko has an Olympic medal worth more than its weight in gold. The Kiwi held on to win the women's golf competition at Le Golf National by two shots. That completes her collection of Olympic medals. And the gold gave her the point she needed to become the 35th member of the LPGA Hall of Fame. Ko won the silver medal in Rio de Janeiro and the bronze in Tokyo. This was closer than it needed to be. She led by five shots in the 13th fairway. Esther Henseleit of Germany won the silver and Xiyu Lin of China captured bronze.\nSATURDAY SCORES\nMAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL\nINTERLEAGUE\nFinal San Francisco 3 Detroit 1\nFinal Washington 5 L.A.
