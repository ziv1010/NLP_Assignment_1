The festivities I thought really showed we were behind the team and it’s a low-cost economic driver to bring people to Fremantle.\n“A couple of years back when we were last in finals it was, ‘what are we going to do, when are we going to do it’ and we painted the embankment here of the building.\n“Celebrations are a bit ad hoc and there’s definitely a community drive or want for something a bit more formalised.”\nAs well as the potential economic boost, Cr Geoff Graham said public displays of support could galvanise the Dockers.\n“The Dockers will think ‘crikey, the bloody City of Fremantle is right behind us, we’ve got to perform better and perform for the people of Fremantle’,” he said.\n“I know they’re trying their guts out every week but little things like this can help the morale of the side and the morale of the club and the morale of the supporters, and there’s no better place to do it than in Fremantle.\n“Not saying that the Dockers are going to make the grand final but it doesn’t matter whether they make the grand final or just the first round, it’s still something that we should celebrate.”\nMayor Hannah Firzhardinge said she was now “petrified” the Dockers would now lose the rest of their games, “as they did the last time we bought any purple paint”.\n“But I shall trust that that is superstition, not logic, and that they’re doing very, very well, so fingers crossed,” she said.\nCr Graham said other achievements that could be celebrated include Minjee Lee’s victory last month at the PGA Championship.\nThe win brought her number of major titles to three, which Cr Graham said put her in the “echelon of golfing”.\nHe said although she went to school in Rossmoyne, she was part of the Royal Fremantle Golf Club.\n“You don’t get anything bigger than what she’s done,” he said.\n“The Royal Fremantle Golf Club is actually in Central ward; people aren’t aware of that, so it is part of Fremantle so therefore we can claim her.”\nMs Fitzhardinge said Madeira in Portugal had recognised the achievements of soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo by erecting a statue of him.\n“One part of its anatomy is shinier than all the rest because people believe it’s good luck to touch Ronaldo, which was a little disturbing,” she said.\n“I’m not sure we need any giant statues but it is an interesting thing to consider.”\nCr Jemima Williamson-Wong said it had been suggested the city have a purple fountain.\n“I don’t know where we would put such a purple fountain but I guess this report will tell us if that is economically viable and smart,” she said.\nCr Andrew Sullivan said the strategy would enable the city to put activities and events into place quickly.\n“What we realistically need to be able to achieve in this festival city, this city that likes to celebrate and likes to have activities going on in the street and in the venues and the like, is the capacity to always be able to relatively quickly or over a long period of time put on a show,” he said.\n“What I hope that comes from this is a really clear strategy . . . for how to make sure that we can virtually flick a switch to celebrate whatever it is that we want to celebrate at that particular moment.”\nA city officer’s report said the city annually prepared for the Dockers making it to the finals and holding an event such as closing the cappuccino strip would cost about $100,000.",
