  "body_text": "The one aspect that distinguishes Best and Brightest from other award programs are the unique portraits each winner receives.\nThe way that PennLive and The Patriot-News takes those photos has changed over the years but the dedication to capturing the essence of the winners has never wavered.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, we ask the winners to come to the photo studio at our offices in Hampden Twp. They are asked to bring multiple props that will give a visual snapshot of who they are.\nOne of the members of the Best and Brightest class of 2025 made history with the portraits taken by award-winning PennLive photographer Sean Simmers.\nDaris Dedic, a senior at Carlisle High School, is the only Best and Brightest ever to need himself plus three PennLive staffers to carry all his props to the photo studio – a snare drum, a keyboard, a harmonica, tennis racket, helmet, a more than 6-foot-tall cutout of himself and a few more things.\nThis year the the Best and Brightest also brought three well-behaved dogs, a sword, gavels, baseballs (lots of baseballs), bocce balls, cleats, skis, a DNA strand model and more.\nWhat all of the members of the class of 2025 brought was their best selves — they shine without lights or special effects.\nThe Best and Brightest winners excel academically, participate in many extracurricular activities, sports, music and more. They also juggle part-time jobs, church and community activities, and sometimes, help to care for family members.\nCommon themes in 2025 were leadership, the importance of inclusion, the desire to help others and volunteering with Special Olympics, specifically Unified Bocce. Some will be valedictorians and salutatorians of their class.\nThe Best and Brightest class of 2025 is 20 high school seniors from 18 high schools in five counties that represent the potential of this graduating class. They were selected from 150 applications that were submitted from Adams, Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Perry and York counties. The applications were reviewed by two panels of judges.\nThe Best and Brightest are all members of one or more honor societies, have earned distinguished honor roll status and have taken Advanced Placement courses and or have had dual enrollment with local colleges.\nThe Best and Brightest award winners were honored at a ceremony on May 21 at the Cooper Student Union at Harrisburg Area Community College.\nThe keynote speaker was Mark Schweiker, 44th Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nDuring the ceremony, each winner was given a framed portrait taken by Simmers. The students were also treated to a video submitted secretly by their family and friends expressing their support and encouragement.\nStudents are invited to apply for the Best and Brightest award themselves. They submit an application along with two letters of recommendation and an essay describing how they have made a difference in their community and/or school and how that experience will help them to contribute to a better society.\nPennLive and The Patriot-News have been giving the Best and Brightest awards since 1993.\nThese are the members of the Best and Brightest class of 2025. Their profiles are written using information they provided in their applications. Not all awards, activities and honors are listed. The honors listed are primarily for the 2024-25 school year.\nAlexander Baturin\nSchool: Camp Hill High School\nParents: Rachael and Harry Baturin\nIn his words: “The life-affirming, transformational significance from working with [the African Schools Debate Foundation] is that many of the activities that I cherish do not simply serve the function as either simply an academic [activity] or a respite from the difficulties of the outside world for me or anyone involved, but actually function as a window of opportunity to this same world, laden with countless issues that need addressed, problems which need to be solved, and scenarios that need transformed, all of which I can’t wait to tackle.”\nIn their words: “Alex is one of the finest young men I have ever met. His resume will convey to you how intelligent and dedicated he is — but what may not come across is what I know about him — that he is also exceptionally kind, caring, compassionate, and committed to supporting others in their growth. To me, those are the qualities that make Alex truly stand out among his peers.” - Beth Zampogna, Camp Hill Youth and Government adviser, assistant director of government relations, Pennsylvania State Education Association\nHonors: Selected to represent North America in the Intercontinental Debate Competition; first person in Pennsylvania Youth and Government to be elected a statewide Supreme Court justice and three-time committee chair; Judicial Debate and Moot Court finalist; Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Certificate of Merit for SAT score; National Latin Examination Certificate of Honorable Merit cum laude; National Honor Society; World Language Honor Society; Harvard Forensic Speech and Debate Tournament, triples and speaker points leader; Harvard Legal Speech and Debate summer program grand champion; AP Scholar with Honors.\nActivities: Served on Camp Hill Planning Commission and Camp Hill School Board; baseball; varsity golf team captain; selected for Leadership Cumberland and high school student mentor; YMCA Youth and Government program; co-founder and adviser for Camp Hill Chapter of Youth and Government; Camp Hill Debate Team/American Debate League; International Debate; Camp Hill Student Council; The Handles Foundation; African Schools Debate Foundation.\nMentor: Hira Tariq, research teacher/scholar, studying at Quaid University and a graduate of the University of Gujrat in Pakistan.\nPlans: He will attend the University of Pennsylvania to major in political science and minor in legal studies and history through a joint program with the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and its College of Arts and Sciences.\nAiden Beck\nSchool: Manheim Central High School\nParents: Stephanie and Scott Beck\nIn his words: “I come from a rural Pennsylvania town that is an eclectic mix of farming and Plain communities. Fifteen minutes to our south lies Lancaster City, named ‘America’s Refugee Capital’ due to its long-standing history of welcoming displaced individuals. Lancaster currently resettles [20] times more refugees per capita than the rest of the country. This amazing blend of cultures is an important part of who I am and what I value in a community.\n“An inclusive community begins with its people. Many of the individuals seeking asylum in Lancaster arrive with nothing but the clothes on their backs. During my junior year, I contacted Church World Service Lancaster, an organization dedicated to supporting uprooted people. I requested a list of most-needed items and organized a school-wide fundraiser.“\nIn their words: “Aiden’s leadership is most evident in the way he uplifts those around him. His peers recognize him as a leader, always willing to help and guide others. Whether it’s assisting classmates in mastering complex concepts or mentoring younger students, Aiden’s ability to connect with and inspire those around him is truly remarkable. He is intentional about the person he is becoming and the impact he wants to have, approaching every opportunity with a mindset of growth and service.” - Shane Martin, school counselor, Manheim Central High School\nHonors: Mu Alpha Theta national math honor society; National Honor Society; first team and academic all-stars, baseball; Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Certificate of Merit for SAT score.\nActivities: Student Council; captain of boys’ soccer team; Interact Club; PA Classics U19 National Academy League soccer; LCBC Church; Spanish Club; volunteer with Mini-Thon; served meals at Water Street Mission; organized Church World Services of Lancaster fundraiser; soccer referee with Eastern Pennsylvania Youth Soccer Association.\nMentor: Adam Bastidas, Manheim Central High School soccer coach\nPlans: He will attend Bucknell University to major in electrical engineering through the 4+1 accelerated master’s program.\nChase Bingaman\nSchool: Central Dauphin East High School\nParents: Janelle and Matthew Bingaman\nIn his word: “Challenger baseball has played a meaningful role in helping me become the person I am today. When I am with my team, all that has weighed me down is let go, and I get to appreciate the sport of baseball in its truest form. Challenger Baseball requires you to put any ego to the side and to realize what life is all about. ... Being a Little League Challenger Buddy has taught me the importance of empathy and selflessness.”\nIn their words: “In addition to game play assistance, Chase provides companionship for some of the children who have difficulty forming friendships. His efforts bring the players and their families profound joy. Chase’s bright personality, patience, and compassion are valuable assets for our Challenger Baseball program. His maturity, positive attitude, and respect for the players and coaches have contributed to the growth and success of our program.” - Michael Newman, co-director, Camp Hill Little League Challenger Baseball.\nHonors: AP Scholar with Distinction; National Honor Society; 2024 Camp Hill Challenger D.J.

This was never pressure, for I always admired how much they looked up to me. Today, I am inspired to be the best player and version of myself possible, for I never know what little girl may be watching. Although they see me as an athlete, I know there is more to sports than stats and accomplishments, so I must lead [by] example in each aspect of life. ... I feel so blessed to have helped encourage the future female athletes in our area ...”\nIn their words: “... Jordan is an exemplary role model when she steps between the lines, but I have taught her in Physics-Honors, AP Calculus AB, AP Computer Science, and other programming courses. I know with certainty that she is a great role model for our daughters as a well-rounded, independent young lady. Her athletic greatness is rivaled by her intelligence, her work ethic, and her sense of humor.” - Jared Weibley, mathematics, physics and computer programming teacher, boys’ soccer head coach, West Perry High School\nHonors: National Honor Society; All American Junior National Field Hockey Team; PennLive field hockey player of the year; first team Max Field Hockey All-American\nActivities: Captain of the field hockey team, which won district and state championships in 2024; first team honors, Colonial Division; multiple honors for field hockey; U18 National field hockey team (will represent the U.S. in a tournament in Tonbridge, England; track and field; co-president of the class; treasurer of the Leo Club; volunteer with PA Revs AllStarz field hockey program; Unified Bocce team; student advisory team; yearbook club; Special Olympics volunteer.\nMentor: Jared Weibley, mathematics, physics and computer programming teacher and boys’ soccer head coach, West Perry High School\nPlans: She will attend the University of Iowa honors college to major in computer science and engineering and play Division 1 field hockey.\nAarushi Dedhiya\nSchool: Cumberland Valley High School\nParents: Phalguni and Chaitanya Dedhiya\nIn her words: “ ... by staying open-minded and driven to improve the world we live in, I continue to foster new relationships with people to work toward promoting healthier lives for current and future generations. From SADD to Break the Silence to [Youth Encouraging Healthy Lifestyles], I will continue having conversations to learn about the current health needs, helping communities across the globe. That way, I can be part of effective change — one initiative at a time.\"\nIn their words: “... she is, without a doubt, one of the top students I have had in my 35-year career. ... She is cooperative and courteous. She is friendly and positive. She respected those around her, and they returned that respect. Her curiosity is her strength. Sometimes in your career, you meet a student and immediately know that student will be successful in anything he or she does. Aarushi is that student.” - Peter Mashinski, social studies, AP U.S. history teacher, Cumberland Valley High School\nHonors: Coca-Cola Scholar; United States Senate Youth Program finalist; Torch Award youth recipient, World Affairs Council of Harrisburg and Harrisburg University; Changemaker Award, Truth Initiative; AP Scholar award; Pennsylvania Governor’s School of the Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University.\nActivities: Pennsylvania State Board of Education student representative; president of SADD National Student Leadership Council; founder and director of Youth Encouraging Healthy Lifestyles; National Youth Ambassador for the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids; Penn State Medical School P.U.L.S.E. program; Catch My Breath National Youth Advisory board member; CV Eye school newspaper; president, Central PA Tutors peer-to-peer tutoring service; president of Break the Silence SADD chapter; volunteer at The Hershey Story museum; PennLive youth columnist; and practices martial arts.\nMentor: Joyce Davis, outreach and opinion editor, PennLive and The Patriot-News; president and CEO of the World Affairs Council of Harrisburg\nPlans: She will attend Yale University to major in political science and microbiology with a certificate in global health.\nDaris Dedic\nSchool: Carlisle High School\nParents: Adila and Damir Dedic\nIn his words: “Over my time throughout high school, I kept myself subject-oriented toward my goals in engineering, but what I believe helped me achieve the strongest impact in my school and community were all the extracurriculars, service, and sports I chose to do on top of current responsibilities. This realization came around the end of my sophomore year; having the academics organized was one aspect, but my family’s morals and emphasis on reciprocating back encouraged me to give back to my school that gave me such a strong education. For that reason, I decided to join as many opportunities offered by my high school and the Carlisle community as I could in my final two years.”\nIn their words: “I have been Daris’s school counselor for the past two years and he has impressed me with his motivation, his work ethic, and his overall academic prowess. ... Daris has thrived and will take on any challenge that comes his way with vigor and grace. He commented that he always puts in lots of effort, so much so teachers often comment ‘you didn’t need to do all of that.’ Daris feels that going the extra mile is very important and he always wants to put his best work and effort forward.” - Emily McDonald, MED, Carlisle High School counselor\nHonors: National Honor Society; National English Honor Society; Mu Alpha Theta national math honor society; National Science Honor Society; Hugh O’Brian Youth Leadership Foundation; National Piano Guild perfect score participant; AP Scholar Award; CHS Coffeehouse Horizons Scholarship winner.\nActivities: Student Council media manager; Coffeehouse; Wingin’ It (improv comedy troupe) manager; Shakespeare pit band; piano; varsity boys’ tennis; United Bocce; Quiz Bowl; Academic Decathlon; Lyrical Analysis Club; book club; plays drums.\nMentor: Matthew Fahnestock, teacher of the gifted at Carlisle High School and Lamberton Middle School\nPlans: He will attend The George Washington University to study mechanical engineering.\nMikayla Deiter\nSchool: Newport High School\nParents: Judith and Mike Deiter\nIn her words: “During my freshman year, I faced one of the greatest challenges of my life — severe depression and anxiety that resulted in hospitalization. That experience could have defined me, but I chose to reclaim my life and dedicate myself to making a positive impact in my community. Since then, I have sought leadership roles and service opportunities that allow me to contribute meaningfully and help create a better world. One way I give back is through hands-on community service.\"\nIn their words: “Mikayla displays many leadership qualities. Along with being an academic leader, Mikayla also participates in activities outside of the classroom, such as basketball, National Honor Society and various other clubs/activities. She is passionate about going into the medical field, and that stems from her desire to help others. She understands what it is to struggle in life, and that has provided her with the empathy she’ll need to be an incredible medical professional. She will undoubtedly achieve that dream and many more. This, along with her excellent grades, makes her a great role model for her fellow students, as well as the faculty and administration.” - Nicole Cirulli, Newport High School mathematics teacher\nHonors: President of the National Honor Society; Spanish National Honor Society; NIFA scholarship to attend the National 4-H Conference; state project ambassador in 4-H; various cross-country awards.\nActivities: National 4-H Conference; National 4-H Congress; 4-H club president; Little Buffalo State Park lifeguard; clarinet; youth group; raised money to donate six AEDs to local softball leagues and also coordinated training sessions; basketball; cross country; track and field.\nMentor: Jonathan Brunner, youth pastor, Otterbein United Methodist Church, Duncannon\nPlans: She will attend Haverford College with a focus on biochemistry and math.\nKaitlyn Fassl\nSchool: Boiling Springs High School\nParents: Becki Richwine and Phil Fassl\nIn her words: “During my sophomore year, I underwent shoulder surgery to repair my torn labrum. After many long months, I was able to recover enough in time for my junior volleyball season. Over the past few years, I have dealt with multiple medical conditions. Most of my days were spent at doctors’ appointments, and I did not feel like myself. Balancing my health struggles with my commitment to volunteering and schoolwork has been difficult, but it has taught me resilience and time management. I learned to advocate for myself, find creative solutions to obstacles, and maintain a positive mindset, which has helped me persevere in all areas of my life.\n“These experiences have instilled in me a deep sense of responsibility to give back to my community. They’ve shaped my values of empathy, inclusion, and service, and I plan to continue using these lessons to contribute to a more supportive, compassionate society.”\nIn their words: “True passion like Kaitlyn has is often hard to come by. When you combine her passion with her conviction and her heart, you will find a truly unique person. I firmly believe that she will go on to achieve great things in her life and will continue to positively influence everyone around her. As her coach, I could not be more grateful to be granted the experience of watching her blossom.” - Erin Lutz, assistant club director, West Shore YMCA Club Volleyball Program; assistant volleyball coach, Middletown Area High School; former head volleyball coach, Boiling Springs High School\nHonors: National Honor Society; Mu Alpha Theta national math honor society; dean’s list at HACC; Mid Penn Capital Division volleyball honorable mention 2024; Mid Penn Division Unified Coed Bocce Ball Champions 2025.\nActivities: Student Council; Perfect Peers club; Merakey golf fundraiser; Special Olympics volunteer; UPMC Carlisle internship; Penn State Holy Spirit shadowing; captain of the varsity volleyball team; Unified Coed Bocce team; Mini-Thon.\nMentor: Amber Stewart, career counselor and business teacher, Boiling Springs High School\nPlans: She will attend the University of Pittsburgh to major in neuroscience on the pre-medicine track.\nIsabella Feather\nSchool: Susquehanna Twp. High School\nParents: Elizabeth and Gregory Feather\nIn her words: “I’m driven by a vision of healthcare that takes into account both the physical and emotional aspects of people. My hospital experience has taught me that true healing requires both genuine human connection and physical care. Likewise, I aim to develop gene therapies that address the genetic predispositions that haunt many patients I care for, while also providing the support that preserves patients’ dignity and sense of purpose. By developing accessible gene therapies, healthcare could be transformed into a proactive approach that would improve the quality of life for disadvantaged communities or those that are more vulnerable to inherited diseases.“\nIn their words: “Bella’s aptitude for mathematics is truly remarkable. Her passion for the subject is evident through her exceptional performance in AP Calculus AB, where she consistently demonstrates a deep understanding of complex concepts. Her analytical thinking and problem-solving skills make her a standout student in my class. Bella excels academically in all her STEM classes. She has attended pre-college programs at prestigious institutions such as the University of Rochester, Georgetown University, and Harrisburg University, expanding her expertise in STEM fields. She is also co-founder of the Women in STEM Club, fostering STEM engagement among her peers.” - Mary Graham, mathematics teacher, Mu Alpha Theta and National Honor Society adviser\nHonors: AP Scholar with Honor; National Honor Society; Mu Alpha Theta national math honor society; National Science Honor Society; National English Honor Society; National Social Studies Honor Society.\nActivities: Co-founder of Women in STEM Club at school; UPMC volunteer; Ski Club vice president; stage crew; plays saxophone in the band; president of the Interact Club; co-founder of Book Club; varsity soccer; track and field; Key Club; caregiver for grandmother; scanner at Caldwell & Kearns law firm.\nMentor: Brandy Brant, teacher at Susquehanna Twp.

As an immigrant, I know how difficult it can be for other immigrants and non-English speakers to access opportunities. Still, I have also witnessed the resilience and determination of those who strive to succeed despite these obstacles. My experience at LHACC has inspired me to continue giving back, helping others find their place in this country, and providing them with the tools they need to succeed.”\nIn their words: “In addition to her academic achievements, her commitment to her school and community is admirable. Katherine has made significant contributions through her participation in the National Honor Society, student council, and the Key Club, among others.

Houssou\nIn his words: “I understand now that real change happens through connection, through showing others that their struggles don’t define them. Whether it’s in a classroom, on a wrestling mat, or in quiet conversations about mental health, I’ve learned that making a difference often means being the person you needed when you were struggling. Looking forward, I will continue this work of building bridges and breaking down stigmas. My journey has taught me that resilience isn’t just about surviving — it’s about using your experiences to lift others up. As someone who has moved from the uncertainty of childhood to finding purpose in helping others, I know every challenge we overcome becomes a tool for making our community stronger.\"\nIn their words: “Over the years, his academic interests and abilities have blossomed, particularly in math and science. But what really distinguishes Isaiah is his passion for learning and his capacity to engage difficult material in a fruitful and productive manner for hours on end. His maturity of intellect is inspirational. I have taught philosophy at Messiah University for almost 20 years and would be thrilled to have a student like Isaiah in my class. He is much more intellectually mature than the vast majority of Messiah students, and is one of the most impressive young thinkers I have met.” - Timothy Schoettle, professor of philosophy, Messiah University\nHonors: National Merit Scholarship finalist; National Honor Society; Foreign Language Honor Society; Mu Alpha Theta national math honor society, Penn State EnvironMentors Symposium finalist; AP Scholar with Distinction; Capital Area Science and Engineering Fair grand champion; International Science and Engineering Fair finalist; ISEF National Geographic Excellence in Geography and Geospatial Science award; NAACP ACT-SO finalist, gold medal in piano; Pittsburgh Omega Psi Phi Talent Hunt finalist, piano.\nActivities: Penn State EnvironMentors Research Program; Junior Leadership Cumberland; varsity wrestling; marching band; jazz band; piano; president of the coding club; chess club; tutoring and volunteer work; Mini-Thon.\nMentor: Ted Gibbons, Camp Hill High School science teacher\nPlans: He will attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to major in computer science.\nAlex Laskowski\nSchool: Upper Dauphin Area High School\nParents: Rebecca Margerum and John Laskowski\nIn her words: “Throughout high school, I have gone out of my way to be the best possible version of myself. By stepping out of my comfort zone and welcoming new opportunities, I have been able to serve in leadership positions as a role model. However, joining extracurriculars does not guarantee a position of respect; that is something you have to earn by granting it to others. ... By treating everyone I meet with a great deal of empathy and respect, I am able to create a positive difference in others’ lives. Since I take the time to understand why someone acts the way they do, I am an optimist who is able to reason and forgive. These qualities allow me to focus on improving my own flaws, as opposed to obsessing over the imperfections in others and in my life.”\nIn their words: “One of Alex’s greatest strengths is her kindness. I have never seen her be unkind to any student or adult. She is calm and measured in her responses to all situations. She consistently tries her best and is a leader among her peers. It would be difficult for me to find any student at Upper Dauphin Area who does not like Alex. She is a friend to students of all interests. Alex is also intelligent and focused. She is interested in taking courses that not only interest her but also challenge her. Because of her intelligence and wisdom beyond her years, I have used her as a sounding board for improvements I am considering at our school. She always has given me honest, respectful, valuable feedback.” - Abbey Walshaw-Wertz, Upper Dauphin Area High School principal\nHonors: President of the National Honor Society; Daughters of the American Revolution Good Citizen award; Trojan Fight On award.\nActivities: Captain of the varsity track and cross-country teams; varsity swimming; school musical; FBLA; published a book; acting; painting; math; fashion; volunteering; homecoming court.\nMentor: Clayton Bouchard, Upper Dauphin Area High School cross country coach\nPlans: She will attend Bard College to study liberal arts.\nNicholas Mabry\nSchool: Susquehanna Twp. High School\nParent: Joan Arney and David Mabry\nIn his words: “Never. Walk. Away. ... Those words resonated earlier this year, when Key Club was alerted that the STHS Pink Out campaign needed a new coordinator. We already had an upcoming schedule packed with food drive events, and Breast Cancer Awareness Month was quickly approaching. But the thought of letting the tradition fade when we could have carried it forward was unacceptable. It required effort from all of us: the printer gave us an expedited timeline, I drove to personally pick up the T-shirts, and Key Clubbers sold them during the football game. By the time the month concluded, we’d raised over $1,600 to support those with breast cancer. Never walking away challenged me to say ‘we can do it,’ rather than just ‘that’s unfortunate.’ ... Never walking away reminded me that persistence means adapting to overcome challenges.”\nIn their words: “Nicholas’s resume shows that he has accomplished many amazing things in the short amount of time he has been in high school, but his diligent and hard-working personality sets him apart. Nicholas strives to find the positive in every situation. He remains focused on his goals and does not let life events stand in his way. His level of maturity, as well as his love for learning and academic drive, will help him be successful in any path he chooses. He always strives to do his best while remaining confident and happy. I am so excited to watch Nicholas do amazing things and achieve his dreams.” - Tessa Stockdale, Susquehanna Twp.

High School\nPlans: He will attend Villanova University to major in electrical engineering.\nOlivia Mason\nSchool: Cocalico Senior High School\nParents: Brenda and Chris Mason\nIn her words: Mason said she earned the nickname “Liver” while in gymnastics as a child. After an injury, she quit the sport and then in high school took up field hockey, which she said “reignited” her. “The liver, an organ with the ability to regenerate after damage, is how most people define it. To me, it represents much more. It is not only my nickname but also a reminder of who I am. It has been close to me, distant, and resurfaced when I needed it most. ...\n“God blessed me with the name Olivia, meaning peace, abundance, and resilience, mirroring the liver’s role in the body. Since rediscovering these qualities, I strive to uplift others in their darkest moments, bring peace to those in need, and share my resilience. The medical field presents an opportunity for me to continue to serve others and make a meaningful impact.\n“A simple childhood nickname, one I once resented, has become one of the most defining parts of my life.”\nIn their words: “Olivia Mason is a positive and perceptive young woman who greets every challenge and opportunity with a smile and genuine commitment to excellence. Continuously cheerful and optimistic, Olivia approaches life with grace and determination. Her positive outlook is anchored in a tenacious devotion to the activities, causes, and people she values and holds dear. She is dependable, responsible and thoughtful with her time, talents, and interactions with others. She is a leader through both her words and actions and gains the respect of others through her proven trustworthiness and strengths.” - Lindsay Sigman, English teacher, Cocalico High School\nHonors: Selected to Congress of Future Medical Leaders Awards of Excellence; invited to National Youth Leadership Forum for Medicine; Lancaster-Lebanon League Academic All-Star in field hockey; National Honor Society, Sociedad Honoraria Hispánica.\nActivities: Varsity field hockey; varsity lacrosse; Fellowship of Christian Athletes; volunteering with Meals on Wheels; Peter’s Porch; Helping Harvest; Hope Rescue Mission; tutoring at Denver Elementary School; teaching Sunday school; Delaware Valley Golden Retriever Rescue; golf course attendant at Springside Par 3 golf course.\nMentor: Jessica Vega, Calvary Bible Fellowship Church administrative assistant\nPlans: She will attend James Madison University to study nursing.\nCarter McClellan\nSchool: Cumberland Valley High School\nParent: Marisa and Justin McClellan\nIn his words: “Overall, I love all the friends with special needs I have found, and I am proud of the difference I have made in my community. I am happy to be a mentor to the younger children at my camp, and I am satisfied with how Club Unity and the Special Olympics have left a positive impact on my school. These experiences challenged me but, as a result, I became more capable of contributing to a better society. I am more patient, responsible, comfortable speaking in front of large groups, and, most importantly, compassionate. In the years to come, I plan to employ these traits as I continue striving to improve my community.”\nIn their words: “Even though Carter is an extremely talented student, it is his character and concern for others that stand out most. Carter is mature, dependable, and empathetic. For example, Carter is a leading member of CV’s Bocce Ball team that seeks to include students with cognitive disabilities. I have observed firsthand how Carter takes it upon himself to make all his teammates feel valued and respected. The authentic way Carter treats his classmates with dignity and respect is extraordinary. Carter is a leader in the community and served as Junior Commissioner for Hampden Township to learn about local issues, have influence, and give voice to his generation.” - Keith Long, history teacher, Cumberland Valley High School\nHonors: National Merit Scholarship program finalist; nominated for the Presidential Scholars program; AP Scholar with Distinction; AP Capstone Diploma, National Honor Society, National World Language Honor Society.\nActivities: Club Unity co-president and founder; Special Olympics Student Board; co-president of the Student Ambassadors; Unified Bocce Ball team; Film Club vice president; varsity cross country and track and field teams; German Club; summer camp counselor at Leg Up Farm, Mini-Thon.\nMentor: Keith Long, history teacher, Cumberland Valley High School\nPlans: He will attend Penn State University in the Schreyer Honors College to study mechanical engineering.\nCassidy Pomraning\nSchool: Middletown Area High School\nParents: Stephanie and Matthew Pomraning\nIn her words: “Coaching was a transformative experience for me. Working with young athletes taught me many valuable lessons that deepened my understanding of patience and leadership. ... Coaching taught me many lessons that go far beyond sports. The patience and leadership skills I developed have strengthened me and made me a better mentor and individual. They have also prepared me to face challenges in my future in STEM, where I hope to break barriers, inspire others by example, and become the role model I never had.”\nIn their words: “I have been consistently impressed by her work ethic, compassionate nature and ability to relate to different groups of people, including peers, teachers, coaches, those at her work, church and school. Cassidy possesses a keen intellect and superb emotional intelligence.\n“While Cassidy is demonstrably an outstanding student (she is ranked first in her class and has taken a host of accelerated courses), what strikes me most when I think about Cassidy is her effervescent and bright personality.

My mission — to foster a culture of volunteerism at the secondary school level — has empowered high schoolers to contribute their time and energy to a humanitarian effort. ... During my early high school career, I noticed an overwhelming sense of apathy from the student body toward local volunteer work. People in need were being overlooked by the students, and understaffed organizations aiming to help those people were underestimating the potential power of student involvement. This disconnect was a source of motivation for my founding of the Red Cross club. By having easy access to volunteer work with the world’s largest humanitarian organization, more students began to care. I witnessed youths committing themselves to important causes on a local and global level in numbers I had not previously imagined to be possible — bringing to life my vision of a world full of empowered young people involved in their community.\"\nIn their words: “Lily is an exceptionally intelligent, determined, and compassionate young woman, and I have known her for several years as both an outstanding student in my Advanced Placement history courses and as an engaged member of the Model United Nations Team. She is one of the finest students I have ever taught, and her dedication to her studies and her extracurricular pursuits has been exemplary. ... Lily is consistent, passionate, enthusiastic, focused, and a pleasure to work with. She possesses both incredible creative energy and a refreshing idealism, tempered by a strong sense of responsibility.” - James R.

I volunteer with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program, where I help prepare taxes for low-income individuals who cannot afford professional services. This experience has opened my eyes to the financial struggles many in my community face and has reinforced my commitment to helping others in meaningful ways. However, I have faced some challenges like balancing academics, athletics, and leadership responsibilities with my volunteer work, which has required dedication and resilience. At times, I have faced self-doubt, especially when taking on new responsibility or even doing something I’m not comfortable with. But these challenges have only strengthened my determination. Learning to manage my time effectively, push through adversity, and stay committed to my goals has prepared me to contribute meaningfully to society.”\nIn their words: “Lexi is a genuine role model who shows up every single day with a positive, respectful attitude. One of the things I appreciate most about Lexi is her reliability coupled with her initiative. Lexi is THE most self-motivated, driven high school student I have had the pleasure of teaching the past 18 years. Her work ethic is supreme. While the result looks like an easy ‘A’ in the gradebook, Lexi is the student who spends countless hours studying and preparing. In every class, she takes notes, organizes them, highlights key terms, then revisits these notes to prepare for exams. She is inquisitive and quick to ask a clarifying question. Lexi’s academic success is a result of her tenacious effort and meticulous time management.” - Matthew Robinson, Dallastown Area High School\nHonors: National Business Honor Society; certified in Volunteer Income Tax Assistance; regional and state competition for FBLA.\nActivities: Field hockey; softball; FBLA; Southern Area Fire and Emergency Rescue volunteer; Support the Troops/Volunteer club; helps low-income community members with tax returns with VITA.\nMentor: Katie Drudy, field hockey coach, Dallastown Area High School\nPlans: She will attend Lock Haven University to major in health and physical education.\nChristine Tang\nSchool: Hershey High School\nParents: Dan Li and Dongming Tang\nIn her words: “Watching ‘Whiplash’ for the first time, I sobbed for hours, feeling an intense sadness for the main character, Andrew. I’ve tended to empathize with others to a fault, even with movie characters. And although bearing the title of someone who cries ‘all the time’ used to annoy me, I now pride myself for it. Empathizing with others motivated me to join Mini-Thon at my school, a club that raises money to fight pediatric cancer. Since then, I’ve learned the stories of hundreds of children currently undergoing treatment at the Penn State Medical Center. ... Inspired, I’ve now served as a co-executive director of Hershey’s Mini-Thon for the past two years, and I plan all aspects of community and school events while managing the 150-plus member club. Although this role invites great stress at times, the impact of nearly $40,000 a year we create for these children makes everything worthwhile.”\nIn their words: Her “continual emphasis on seeking out challenges and being able to grow from feedback is something that stands out to me about Christine. ... Christine is a natural leader who goes out of her way to make others feel at ease. While others in a class actively seek out their friends to work with, Christine has no ego. She will approach anyone and find inroads to connect with them. ... Perhaps this is what stands out the most about Christine: she is one of my most talented writers and critical thinkers this year, yet she is also one of the most humble and kind. Though Christine is undoubtedly successful, she is unassuming and funny and empathetic.” - Erin Ives, English teacher, Hershey High School\nHonors: National Honor Society; Tri-M Music Honor Society; Mu Alpha Theta national math honor society; Spanish Honor Society; 2025 All-Eastern National Association for Music Education Concert Band Festival; PMEA District 7 Band, PMEA Region 5 Band and Pennsylvania All-State Festival, flute; Harrisburg Symphony Orchestra Youth Orchestra Concerto Competition finalist; United States Figure Skating three-time gold medalist; AP Scholar with Distinction; P.U.L.S.E. program at Penn State College of Medicine; Gold Presidential Volunteer Service Award.\nActivities: President, Tri-M Music Honor Society (chapter of the year 2024); figure skating; Mini-Thon; internship at Penn State Health Milton S.

High School\nParents: Audrey and Edward Zuschmidt\nIn his words: “We all remember the call, the neurologist’s words heavy with the weight of my younger brother Nate’s diagnosis: a cerebral cavernous malformation, the silent cause of his epilepsy and seizures. As surgeries loomed — one to remove the malformation, another for scar tissue — I peppered nurses with questions and began to explore surgical robotics. Each evening, I shared what I learned with Nate, turning uncertainty into curiosity through ‘Cool robot pictures!’ as he would exclaim. That summer, I delved deeper, studying laparoscopic surgical tools and designing a new robotic system for minimally invasive surgery that was later published as one of the first papers in a Student Engineering Journal.\n“Despite the struggle and stress that comes alongside family medical turmoil, I found myself coming out of the situation inspired by not just my brother’s perseverance, but also his desire to learn about his condition. Looking back, what started as showing ‘cool robot pictures’ to my brother became the foundation of my passion for being willing to ask my own questions and teach others to be curious.”\nIn their words: “Cameron is one of the most driven and inquisitive students I have encountered. In my ‘Project Lead The Way: Intro to Engineering Design’ course, he demonstrated remarkable problem-solving skills, designing and building creative solutions to real-world problems. His ability to learn from setbacks and push beyond expectations sets him apart. Beyond earning top grades in a rigorous curriculum, he possesses exceptional communication skills — verbal, written, and visual — that enhance his ability to lead and collaborate.\" - Ben Whitby, Technology and Engineering, teacher and adviser, Manheim Twp.
