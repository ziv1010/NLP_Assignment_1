A few of the girls and the middles definitely made me look good.\"\nThe competition featured 12 games, each lasting 25 minutes, including finals.\nThree hundred triservice personnel from across the country participated in the women's opens, men's opens, and over 30s divisions.\nVice-captain of the South Queensland women's team Corporal Alesha Sands said the final was a very close game and the best of the competition.\n\"Our hearts were pumping; we all knew the job we had to do. We had to stay focused to try and get the team over the line,\" she said.\n\"They grinded harder and held on longer, mistakes were made, and they took their opportunities and got over the line.\"\nIt was her first time serving as vice-captain and she saw it as an opportunity to develop her skills.\n\"It was great to communicate with them in a way they could understand and were eager to learn from,\" Corporal Sands said.\n'It comes down to building good rapport with players and having early and effective communication.'\nThe championship was also the first time Able Seaman Samuel Collins refereed a major event.\n\"I was upgraded to Level 3 at the end of the tournament at the presentations, so I was refereeing as a Level 2,\" he said.\n\"I refereed the over 30s grand final, a significant accomplishment for me, as all other referees were Level 5, 6, or their international equivalents.\"\nHe decided to start refereeing 18 months ago after he missed playing the game.\nTouch Football Australia has a six-tier accreditation system, with Level 6 being the highest, allowing referees to officiate at international events, such as the Touch Football World Cup.\nAble Seaman Collins' next challenge will be to achieve a Level 4 upgrade.\nThe jump from Level 3 to 4 only comes with one opportunity every 12 months and is considered the minimum badge required to officiate at the National Touch League.\nHe said refereeing was fast-paced and that decisions needed to be made confidently.\n\"As long as I make a confident decision, people will tend to respect that,\" Able Seaman Collins said.\n\"It comes down to building good rapport with players and having early and effective communication.\"",
