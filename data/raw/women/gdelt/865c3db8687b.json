  "body_text": "For the third game in a row, Jessie Gale got on the scoresheet for Portsmouth in Sunday’s 5-2 defeat away to Birmingham City.\nAfter her recent cameos off the bench earned her a place in the starting line-up, Gale repaid that faith by shooting through the legs of Lucy Thomas and in off the far post to continue her hot streak.\nPompey are 11th in the WSL 2, level on points with Durham and Sunderland.\nUp in the Barclays Women’s Super League, Rosa Kafaji came on in the 68th minute of Brighton & Hove Albion’s 4-1 win at home to Leicester City.\nCecily Wellesley-Smith was an unused substitute for the Foxes in that match. The Seagulls have soared to seventh in the WSL with 11 points from nine matches.\nOverseas, Laila Harbert came on in the 82nd minute of Portland Thorns’ 2-0 loss against Washington Spirit in the NWSL semi-final, meaning their season has come to an end.\nIn men’s football, Ismeal Kabia came off the bench in Shrewsbury Town’s 2-1 defeat away to Northampton Town in the EFL Trophy on Tuesday, before starting Saturday’s 1-0 win at home to Newport County. That lifted them to 21st in League Two.\nMaldini Kacurri played 88 minutes of Morecambe’s 4-2 defeat away to York City in the National League, which they’re now 23rd in.\nFinally, Lucas Nygaard’s Brabrand drew 1-1 at home to FC Roskilde to go ninth in the Danish Second Division. Lucas started the match in goal but had to be replaced at half-time.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
