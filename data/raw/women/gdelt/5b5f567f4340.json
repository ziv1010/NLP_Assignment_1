  "body_text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- This time, Michigan did nothing egregiously wrong in the final minutes of the game. There were missed shots and missed rebounds, but nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, Tuesday’s loss has become all too ordinary for the Wolverines, who were again on the wrong side of a tight game, falling to Florida 106-101 in double overtime to open the Jumpman Invitational.\nDug McDaniel started hot and stayed that way, finishing with a game-high 33 points to match a career best on a night Michigan leaned heavily on its starters.\nThe Wolverines (6-6) had fallen apart late in so many close games last year, and had already taken defeats in a few tight contests this year. Add this to the list.\nMichigan scored the final four points of regulation to force overtime. Florida hit a second-chance 3 to send it to a second extra session. Michigan went up two in double overtime but came up empty on three straight possessions and fell behind 99-93 with 1:25 left. Michigan’s Terrance Williams II misfired out of a timeout and Florida’s Walter Clayton Jr. hit a 3 to seal the game.\nOlivier Nkamhoua posted 24 points and 11 rebounds for Michigan, as the other starters -- all of whom played at least 44 minutes -- reached double figures. Williams had 17 points and Tarris Reed Jr. added 14.\nMichigan had a hard time keeping the Gators off the glass, allowing 24 offensive rebounds. The Wolverines’ 16 turnovers didn’t help. Michigan didn’t get much from its bench, with three players combining for 23 minutes and just three points. Perhaps Michigan ran out of gas.\nMichigan lost in last year’s Jumpman Invitational to North Carolina. The Spectrum Center in downtown Charlotte was packed and loud for that one; not so much on Tuesday without the local team playing. The upper level was curtained off, and the lower bowl was about 60 percent full.\nThe Michigan and Florida women will face off on Wednesday night (6:30 p.m., ESPN2) in the two-night event that features the first four schools to sign partnerships with Jordan Brand in basketball and football.\nThe Gators shot just 18 of 29 from the foul line, preventing them from pulling away at various points, but still got the win to improve to 8-3.\nMichigan’s first six points of overtime came at the free throw line, with McDaniel’s pair making it 87-84 with 2:25 left. Florida trailed by one with a minute left and the ball. Michigan got the stop and McDaniel was fouled again. He made both, and finished a 12 of 13 at the line.\nMichigan forced a miss at the other end but couldn’t score the rebound, and Clayton capitalized with a wide-open 3 to tie the game. Nimari Burnett’s step-back 3 missed, and Zyon Pullin’s halfcourt try at the buzzer missed wide, sending the game to double overtime.\nFive minutes into the second half, Michigan had a nine-point lead. Florida’s 7-0 run tied the game midway through the half, and Zyon Pullin’s and-one gave Florida a 68-65 edge with 7:19 to go. Pullin, who considered Michigan as a transfer this summer, finished with 22 points.\nMichigan had gone more than four minutes without a made field goal before Nkamhoua buried a 3 to break a tie with 5:26 left. Will Richard’s 3 tied it again with just under five minutes to go (he scored 17). Nkamhoua’s monster rejection at the rim kept it that way.\nMichigan couldn’t stop Richard from scoring -- another and-one -- and Florida went up four with a minute to go. Burnett had his shot blocked, retrieved it, and scored with 33 seconds left. Michigan forced a held ball out of the ensuing inbounds and regained possession.\nMcDaniel drove and missed, but softly, and Nkamhoua slammed it home to tie the game at 81 with 12 seconds left. Florida raced the other way, and Reed rejected a layup out of bounds with 2.6 seconds left. Florida’s baseline out-of-bounds play resulted in a desperation jumper that hit the bottom of the rim to send the game to overtime.\nMichigan looked good early. Nkamhoua followed McDaniel’s third 3 with a layup to make it 15-7 Michigan six minutes in. Florida got within one a few times later in the half, and finally broke through on a pretty baseline drive and pass for a dunk. Florida led 31-30 with 3:32 to go in the half. Williams answered with a 3 to give the lead right back to Michigan.\nMcDaniel’s attempted lob was intercepted, and Pullin banked in a deep 3 to beat the buzzer and give Florida a 38-37 edge. Teams down one at half win more than half the time, but Tuesday was not Michigan’s night.\nLatest Michigan basketball news:\n- Bracketology: Early NCAA Tournament projections for Michigan basketball\n- Michigan shakes off slow start, pulls away from Northwestern\n- Michigan basketball subject of new four-part docuseries\n- L.J.
