  "body_text": "The first ever national mental health research report conducted amongst players in the League of Ireland was launched earlier this week.\nThe research report, titled ‘Mental Health in the League of Ireland: A Study’, is a product of collaboration between the Football Association of Ireland (FAI), the Player’s Football Association (PFA) Ireland and South East Technological University (SETU) Ireland.\nConducted throughout the 2024 season, the primary aim of the report was to examine the prevalence of Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) amongst players in the Men’s Premier Division, Women’s Premier Division and Men’s First Division.\nThe results produced are preliminary, as part of a process to be peer-review and published.\nMENTAL HEALTH PREVALENCE RESEARCH IN ELITE FOOTBALL\nAlthough mental health research in football is expanding, it remains an underreported area. In line with much emerging research across other European leagues, the report details the prevalence of symptoms relating to CMDs amongst the players, in addition to exploring the possible associations between CMD prevalence and demographical factors such as age, gender, education levels, playing position and more.\nWhile attendances, coverage and engagement levels continue to rise across the League of Ireland, this report aims to contribute to an increase in player health, wellbeing and long term performance.\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE REPORT:\n- Caseness: 63% (n=138) of players met the criteria for at least ONE symptom of a Common Mental Disorder.\n- Education: Players with the lowest level of education (Junior Certificate/GSCEs) reported the highest scores for anxiety/depression.\n- Position: Goalkeepers were more likely to report a Common Mental Disorder than any other position.\n- Age: More experienced players were less likely to report anxiety/depression, but reported higher scores for adverse alcohol use.\n- Playing Status: Full-Time Professionals were the least likely to have symptoms of a Common Mental Disorder, less than Part-Time and Amateur players\n- Burnout: Players who reported feeling burned out were significantly associated with being at risk of developing a Common Mental Disorder.\nThe report is available here – https://www.leagueofireland.ie/about/media/\nSpeaking on the launch of the report, Dr Cíara Losty, Researcher & Lecturer at SETU Ireland, said: “Undertaking prevalence research for common mental health disorders in football is crucial for several reasons. By identifying the scope of the issue within footballers, prevalence research can help us to understand how widespread mental health disorders are among Irish football players. By recognising the proportion of players affected, stakeholders can better gauge the extent of the problem. Mental health often remains a stigmatised topic in sport.\n“Research helps bring attention to the issue, destigmatising it and encouraging open conversations among players, coaches, and management about mental well-being. Mental health is crucial for the long-term career sustainability of players. Research can provide insights into factors that impact players’ mental health, helping to prevent burnout and career-ending issues. Overall, prevalence research is a step toward creating an environment where players’ mental health is prioritised, leading to healthier, more successful players in Irish football.”\nMark Scanlon, League of Ireland Director, said: “This report is a welcome first step in looking into the crucially important, yet under researched, area of mental health amongst footballers in the League of Ireland. As the profile of the League of Ireland continues to grow, this brings extra pressure and attention to clubs and players and it is important that we ensure that the well-being of our players is always at the forefront of any decision-making process.\n“This excellent report brings together crucial stakeholders in the game, and we hope that it will be the beginning of a journey of further research into this important topic. We look forward to working with the PFA Ireland and SETU Ireland as well as players, coaches and match officials to help break the stigma and encourage open conservations regarding mental health and well-being.”\nStephen McGuinnness, General Secretary, PFA Ireland said: “Players are an integral part of the League of Ireland and it is imperative that all stakeholders play a role in supporting them, whether that is around their employment, their physical health or their mental health. This research shows some of the additional mental health challenges faced by players in the professional football industry in Ireland. It highlights the necessity of the supports we already provide our members in PFA Ireland and gives some insight towards additional supports that will be needed to support players in the future. We look forward to undertaking further research in this area.”\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThe primary recommendation of the report is for it to be viewed as a crucial first step in a process that will identify and propose the highest standards of preventative and supportive measures to protect and promote the long-term mental health of players in the League of Ireland.\nThe report highlights the importance of raising awareness of common mental disorders in football, and encourages even greater commitment from all stakeholders to support Irish football in the promotion of player care, ensuring that those struggling with mental health issues can access supports.",
