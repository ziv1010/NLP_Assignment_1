  "body_text": "A record-setting lacrosse player at Syracuse. World Cup champion on the U.S. national team. Assistant coach for the 2024 champion U.S. Women’s U20 national team. The 2023 Patriot League Coach of the Year. Proud parent of a one-year-old daughter. A staunch advocate for LGBTQ rights. There isn’t much the head women’s lacrosse coach at West Point, Michelle Tumolo, can’t do.\nBorn and raised in Harrison Township, N.J., Tumolo led the Army Black Knights to their first ever NCAA Tournament bid in 2023. She has a 41-19 record in her first four seasons, including a school-record 15 wins in 2024. Before coming to West Point, Tumolo went 29-13 in three seasons at Wagner, leading the Seahawks to the 2019 NCAA Tournament. Prior to that she honed her craft as an assistant coach at Oregon, Florida and Syracuse.\nThe humble and gregarious Tumolo was a terror as a player and now leads Army’s women’s lacrosse team into battle with the same aggressive attitude displayed throughout her impressive career. With a strong 5-1 start on the 2025 season, the Daily News caught up with Coach Tumolo to discuss her mission and the bright future she has created for women’s lacrosse at the United States Military Academy at West Point.\nDaily News: What is your methodology that has led to your coaching success at West Point?\nMichelle Tumolo: It’s 50% lacrosse and 50% everything else. It’s all about getting buy-in to our young program from the players and staff. When I came here in 2021, we had never defeated Navy, never been to a playoff, never had a championship. So, I wanted to be in on the list of “firsts” and make history at West Point. The players in our locker room believe in themselves, with a high standard of excellence, growth and family. When you have a tight knit team that loves and trusts each other, that will transfer to the field. And I can’t say it’s all me. I’ve had incredible assistant coaches that have led us to new heights.\nDN: Are you a “pat on the back” or “kick in the butt” coach?\nMT: (laughing) I’m both. My parents were hard and supportive in a good way. My mom knew my strengths in high school were more athletic than academic. So, she’d push me on my studies and pat me on the back when I played sports. I’ll put my arm around my players and tell them I love and believe in them, but I’m also going to tell them when I think they can be better. I’m a very vocal coach. This is how I am.\nDN: Can you “coach up” a good player into a great player, or is it all just talent?\nMT: Well, that’s my job. We have naturally talented players, and we really care about them. We “coach them up” starting with skills in the fall and building them into the system in the spring for everyone to be able to play at a highest level. Fall is for team chemistry; the spring is to implement the system.\nDN: I watched your recent game against Fairfield (Army won, 18-10). Your players seem to love each other. Maybe it’s not a problem, but how do you handle egos and poor sportsmanship?\nMT: We have such incredible young women. This is the best 33 strong I’ve ever coached. My core value that I stress is to be a great teammate. Not just a good teammate, but a great one. It builds confidence on the field when you know that every teammate has your back. The players on the sidelines constantly cheer the team on. It makes my job so much more enjoyable. And it’s something I take pride in. Each week we hand out a “Baller of the Week” award to a player who practiced especially hard and put it up on our Instagram. It’s mostly the positive attitude that they bring to practice and the field.\nDN: Has the game changed since you last played in 2016?\nMT: So much. It’s still a beautiful finesse game, but it’s so much faster. More physical. It’s fun to watch. The stick technology these days…cradling the ball, behind the back shots on goal, it’s amazing what these women can do on the field.\nDN: You were a fury on offense at Syracuse, posting the highest single season totals in points and assists for a freshman in the program’s history and named Big East Attack Player of the Year in 2013. Army is 13th in the nation on defense for goals allowed. Have you changed your approach as a coach to be more defensive minded?\nMT: I love this question. I have to give credit to our (second year) defensive coordinator Charlotte Sofield. She was an unbelievable defender at UNC (winning four ACC Championships and the National Championship in 2016). She is so passionate for defense. When we hold opponent scores to under 8, 10, or 13 goals, that’s how you become champions. I coached defense the year we made the NCAAs (2023). I was so proud, because I was so offensive minded as a player. Defense is black and white compared to offense. You force players this way or that. But Charlotte has taken our defense to new historic heights. It takes so much pressure off the offense to not have to score on every possession. Our goal every game is to force our opponents have a shot clock violation (90 seconds). It’s very deflating for an offense to suffer that violation.\nDN: How ticked off were you losing at your alma mater Syracuse last year?\nMT: Playing in the Dome is such an experience. It’s elite. It’s historic. We wanted to play against a high caliber team to learn how to be a champion. It was hard. And I hated to lose by so much (18 to 7), but it showed our girls what it takes to be the best. It was a great learning experience.\nDN: How exciting was it taking Army to the NCAAs for the first time in 2023?\nMT: The whole season was a fairy tale. We beat ranked teams for the first time to get in the top 20 and then went on a 10-game win streak, including beating Navy for only the second time ever. For our players to reach the NCAA Tournament is incredible. When we watched the selection show, the joy was… look, we are a military institution. In the summer the players do not get to play much lacrosse like other collegiate programs do. They might have a week or two off, but for the most part our players are in the woods for military training all summer. They’re not in cleats, they’re running in boots, and because they were in boots literally the day before, I don’t put them on the field for a speed test when our training starts up in August. We slow-roll it. They haven’t been able to shower regularly, they’re getting yelled at, they’re tired, they probably haven’t eaten correctly. But honestly, their military training gives our players a mental toughness that transfers to the field. So, for me it’s a tradeoff. I realize they are being trained by the finest officers in the USA. I’ll teach them lacrosse when they come back.\nDN: Does the new NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) policy affect West Point?\nMT: It’s not a thing for us. We might lose recruits because of it, but the way I look at it is if you’re into NIL, you’re probably not right for the military. Because it’s not all about you. I’m happy for the students who get paid, but I just want an athlete that wants to play lacrosse here at a high level, get an education at the finest institution, and become a leader themselves. It’s such an honor to coach people that want to do that.\nDN: How do you approach recruiting at a military academy?\nMT: I used to try and get the best of the best kids even if they didn’t show an interest in West Point. But now I’m much more selective about who I go after. They have to know what they’re getting into, because we have to recruit them before the summer of their senior year in high school. It’s a big commitment for a 16-year-old girl. I’m very thorough in my communications with the players. I talk to their club coaches and make sure they’re not just putting a “like” button down because we’re a good team and staff. They must really want to serve in the military. And play lacrosse at a top program. I found my (recruiting) groove, and I’ve learned that the girls who want to serve either had a grandfather or a dad or a cousin that served. To them, it’s incredibly important.\nDN: You were a superstar as a player. Do the kids you recruit know who you are?\nMT: This generation watched me and my teams play, but I might be getting phased out a bit because I’m a little older. It is such an honor to think that people want to play for me. It provides a deeper connection. I went to Syracuse because I wanted to play for Gary Gait, the greatest lacrosse coach and player of all time. When a girl wants to play for me and my staff, that’s a connection you can’t break. When they commit to me, I’m also committing to them.\nDN: The schedule gets tougher. No. 15 Loyola. No. 7 Stanford. No. 19 Navy. Thoughts?\nMT: I love it! That’s how we win championships. I’m so excited. I respect Loyola and their coaches so much. Navy is just historically good. They were in the final four in 2017, within one goal of a national championship. They have a level of excellence, and I love to play them and continue our incredible rivalry. And I’m glad Stanford is playing well, although I hope they lose to Syracuse later today. I’ll be watching. (Syracuse won 14-13 in double overtime).\nDN: What was a bigger rush; winning as a player or as a coach?\nMT: Such a good question. As a player, there was so much blood and sweat I put into my game. I was happy for me. But with my new lens as a coach, I’m happy for my players. I love seeing them succeed together. It is their effort that wins games. I’m just there coaching, but they are physically doing it.\nDN: What was the best game you ever played?\nMT: It was back-to-back games my junior year (2012) at Syracuse. I scored with five seconds left to defeat UNC which took ‘Cuse back to the Final Four. And in the next game, we were down by seven goals against the No. 1 team in the country, Florida. We came back to win in double overtime to advance to the championship game. We all said to each other that there was no way we were losing, and we didn’t. Best times ever.\nDN: OK, now for the really important question — how’s it feel to be a parent?\nMT: It’s the best! Nell (almost one year old) just learned to say “no no no” to the dog. I’m in the honeymoon stage with her now. My job allows me to spend time with her and allows my wife Lara to travel to the city (New York) 3 days a week for her job as a PA. She works incredibly long hours, while my commute is three minutes. We are very fortunate the community at West Point sets me up for success.\nDN: You’ve been openly vocal on your sexuality, emphasizing the need for women in roles of power in sports and beyond, and a proud voice for LGBTQ. Have you faced any challenges speaking out now that you’re at a Military Academy?\nMT: When I got the job I didn’t know about “don’t ask don’t tell” until I read up on it. I said to the school that this is who I am, is this a problem? And they said, “Absolutely not. We’re not hiring you for diversity. We are hiring you because you’re a great coach.” So, I’ve never felt more supported or loved. From my boss, my community. There might be underlying things in the military, but it could be everywhere, too.\nDN: I counted about 20 fans at the Fairfield game last week. But how do you improve attendance for women’s lacrosse?\nMT: It’s definitely a problem. The students (at West Point) don’t get much time off, so weekends are precious. Plus, it’s a winter sport and it’s cold outside. So, they might not want to attend. But it’s mandatory for cadets to attend the football games in the cold. We need some of that for lacrosse. It’s also about the history and the area. B.C., Northwestern, Navy and SU really do such a good job getting people in seats and promoting their lacrosse programs, but those are also big lacrosse towns.\nDN: Woman’s lacrosse will be an Olympic sport in 2028. Would you have liked to have played in the Olympics?\nMT: Oh my God yes! But guess what? I’m on the coaching staff for the 2026 national women’s team, and if we keep doing well, I’m hoping I’ll be retained, and get to coach in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. We just have to keep doing a good job. It would be really really cool. I’ll keep you posted on that.\nDN: Your accomplishments in women’s lacrosse over your career as a player and coach would take up this entire interview. If you had to pick a few things you’re most proud of, what would they be?\nMT: I think about my path in life and everything that led me to this. I’m most proud to be the head coach at West Point. It’s the biggest accomplishment of my life. It’s been very eye-opening. I like to reflect about my mom. She always said to be grateful for the gifts God’s given to you. And I am very grateful I was given the athleticism that made me a great lacrosse player that then helped me become a successful coach. I loved beating Navy for the first time ever. I loved being part of a nationally ranked team as player that made it to a first ever national championship game for Syracuse. I’m also very proud to be able to wear the red, white, and blue to represent my country. And I’m so proud of the players that I’ve coached, not just for recognition for their lacrosse success but also as successful officers in the United States Army. I spoke with some of my players who graduated, who are now officers stationed in places in Europe and Iraq. To think that I led them in some sort in mentorship, is just a wonderful gift for me. These women make me a better leader and mentor. It’s such an honor. They’ve had success in lacrosse, academics and the military. I have one of the best jobs in the country. My other greatest accomplishment is being a parent to Nell and having Lara as my wife. Please mention that. I have the greatest support system and family anyone could ask for.",
