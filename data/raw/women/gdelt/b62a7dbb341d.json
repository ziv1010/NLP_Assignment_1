  "body_text": "Various groups of Americans will do anything but cheer for their country. At an international assembly in Israel, one contingency of students, when introduced as Americans, were rather timid. This was astounding to some people in attendance, who thought that Americans would be eager and proud to be introduced. Indeed, other groups in the international assembly vigorously cheered for their own countries when introduced.\nIndoctrinated from Birth\nWhy are young Americans reticent to celebrate their nationality? They have been indoctrinated from an early age by a fraction of Americans who hate their country and, even if unknowingly, hate themselves. The Left is keenly intent on highlighting every faux pas in American history. Concurrently, they are perhaps the only group that does not understand that every nation around the world has its historical misgivings. In the present day, no nation has acted so magnanimously as America.\nYet, we see groups such as the U.S. women's soccer team, poisoned by the perpetually annoying, self-enraptured, purple-haired Megan Rapinoe, fail to honor America during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” It only takes one rotten, demented apple to putrefy the atmosphere in the locker room, on the team bus, and on airplanes.\nMercifully, she is now retired, and perhaps in a year or two, the stench of her political views will begin to dissipate. However, we continually witness acts of dishonoring America in other domains, such as the National Football League and the National Basketball Association.\nAmerican Pride Prevails\nIn one place, I am pleased to announce great pride in being American continues to prevail: on cruise ships!\nFrom the main stage of a Princess Cruise ship, the cruise director announced passenger nationalities in ascending order. There were 78 Spaniards on board, and they quietly applauded. There were 125 passengers from France, 420 from Canada, and 815 from the United Kingdom, with all groups vigorously applauding the respective announcements. Then, to prolonged and boisterous applause, it was announced that there were 1,700 Americans on board.\nRecommended\nWho are these proud 1700 Americans? Clearly, they are not representative of the groups I have discussed in the first four paragraphs. They tend to be older, averaging age 70 or more. They tend to be affluent. After all, who can afford a two-week cruise, including the international airfare and all the other expenses involved?\nThese 1700 proud Americans were likely to be more educated, have seen more of the world, have read more, and have stayed attuned to politics to a greater degree than those who are perpetually upset about being American.\nNot a Breed Apart\nWe cannot, however, conclude that these American travelers somehow represent a splinter group apart from the rest of the U.S. After all, they have children and grandchildren. They pay taxes. They are on school boards and zoning committees. They run businesses, and they are an integral part of America.\nSo, why does this group, traveling abroad, cited for their numbers, respond with glee and no reservations? Might it be because they're more knowledgeable than the Megan Rapinoes of the world? Could it be that they understand history better than Colin Kaepernick?\nAs a result of their travels, might they understand how generous the United States is compared to the rest of the nations on Earth? To re-emphasize, American history, similar to the history of all other nations on the planet, is replete with injustice and unfairness. Leftists do not understand this truism of world history and couldn't care less.\nA Pleasant Experience\nSitting in the audience, I can tell you that it was most gratifying to see this spontaneous outburst. These fellow Americans surrounding me were not boastful. They were not acting as if they were somehow superior.\nThe spontaneous outburst was simply one of pride and joy in originating from a country that has given them and the world so much. Anyone who researches the numbers knows that Americans are the most giving people on Earth, coming to the aid of so many other nations, so often, with so much, so quickly, and will continue to do this far into the future.",
