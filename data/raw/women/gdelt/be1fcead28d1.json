And considering there’s two exes being paired together, a fire at one of the weddings and a shit-tonne of influencers, it’s gonna be drama-central. I’m absolutely living for it, and it hasn’t even started airing yet.\nOn Jan 13, the official list of future brides and grooms were released by the big dogs behind the show. However, whispers about who would be appearing on the most talked about Aussie reality show have been circulating since August last year.\nIf you were part of the lucky bunch that followed the soon-to-be social reality stars, you may have caught a glimpse into their lives before a third party will take over control of their social media accounts as the show airs. If not, you’ll just have to watch the show and read between the lines.\nSo, without further ado, here’s the Married At First Sight cast for 2025.\nMAFS 2025 Brides\nRhi Disljenkovic\nRhi Disljenkovic was one of the first brides to be leaked this year. She is a 34-year-old account manager from Victoria who is fresh out of a seven-year relationship. On the side, Rhi is also a fitness blogger who loves her exercise schedule and leading a healthy lifestyle.\nAccording to Yahoo! Lifestyle, Rhi is paired with Jeff Gobbels, who happens to be an ex-Neighbours star – and her ex. A source told the publication they were “seeing each other” around this time last year, but “never became official”.\nWelp, guess it’s as official as it gets now! There was also a cheeky bushfire during their wedding… is this an omen of what’s to come?\nInstagram: @rhidisljenkovic\nSierah Swepstone\nSierah Swepstone is a 31-year-old financial associate advisor from Victoria who is determined to land a relationship that lasts. So far, the longest that Sierah has dated someone has been four months. Now, she’s ready for that to change.\nSierah is looking for someone kind and compassionate with a whole lotta’ spark.\nMAFS 2025 bride Sierah Swepstone. (Image: 10)\nYou might recognise Sierah from The Bachelor, as she competed on Jimmy Nicholson’s series back in 2021. She loves a cheeky one-liner and famously said Nicholson wasn’t into “tall, horny bogans” after she was eliminated.\nShe’s a technical analyst who isn’t afraid to speak her mind, which makes for FANTASTIC television.\nI have a feeling whoever’s matched with Sierah is going to have their hands full!\nInstagram: @sweppo\nLauren Hall\nLauren Hall is a 37-year-old business owner from Queensland. She describes herself as being “fiercely independent” and won’t settle for any man who doesn’t meet her standards.\nAlthough the Brissy-based brade is a savvy businesswoman who works as the CEO of Mayfair Lane Gifts, she admits that she’s a homemaker at heart. She’ll take care of a man if he will take care of her.\nRumour has it that Lauren has a sneaky link to MAFS — according to Daily Mail, she dated 2024 groom Jonathan McCulloch for three months.\nShe’s been described as “super fun, entertaining” and “classy” by her friends.\n“Lauren will speak her mind and stand up for herself but she is a good sort and can handle anything thrown her way,” another friend said.\nInstagram: @laurenhall_01\nMorena Farina\nVictorian-based Morena Farina isn’t a regular mum, she’s a cool mum. The 57-year-old fitness instructor decided to add another feather in her bedazzled hat by becoming a DJ at 53.\nIt’s been seven years since Morena’s 29-year marriage ended, and with two teenage kids, it’s time she found someone who matched her vivacious energy.\n“We really hope that she finds someone who is caring, fun and in order for MAFS to work they need to match her energy,” a friend told Daily Mail.\nShe’s also already had her dental transformation (something the MAFS cast usually do ~after~ the show), so she’s reality TV ready!\nMajor Lucinda Light vibe, no?\nInstagram: @djmorenaofficial\nCarina Mirabile\nCarina Mirabile is a 31-year-old digital marketing manager from WA. Carina is from a large Italian family with five siblings — and she’s the only one who isn’t married yet. I can hear her Nonna’s tuts from here.\nAccording to her bio, Carina is “bubbly, bright and glamorous” but not afraid to tell it like it is. She’s not afraid of confrontation and is always ready to stand up for herself. We love to see it.\nCarina is on the hunt for a tall, dark and handsome man who is ideally educated and can fit in with her family. I’ve got my fingers and toes crossed for you, darl!\nOn the side, Carina is also an actress who has talent management and has appeared in quite a few TV commercials. She also has a Broadcast Journalism degree along with a Fashion Design and Textiles diploma, and her bio on her talent agent says she’s keen to explore a career in TV presenting and acting.\nWell, she’s come to the right place… as long as she doesn’t let out a secret villainous side on the show.\nInstagram: @carinamirabile\nKatie Johnson\nKatie Johnson is a 37-year-old CEO of EATS HQ, a social enterprise restaurant that stands for Empowering All Through Support, with the aim of helping create “self-sustainable livelihoods for people and their communities”.\nShe’s incredibly successful, bright and bold in everything she does… except dating. Now, Katie admits it’s time to get the expert’s help in finding love.\nKatie isn’t afraid to ask the tough questions and is hoping for a man who prioritises open communication, is kind, honest and wants a family.\nKatie also went semi-viral back in 2020, after sharing a random act of kindness she experienced on The Kindness Pandemic Facebook page, and was interviewed by 7News. In 2023, she was on Sunrise with Sam Mac to talk about her company along with some of her staff. Perhaps she got a bit of a ~taste~ of fame, and is striving for more?\nShe’s no stranger to TV!

(Image: LinkedIn)\nMelbourne’s Jamie Marinos works as an accounts manager at a digital marketing company. The 28-year-old is from a big Greek family who prays that she’ll find “a good Greek boy” to tie the knot with.\nJamie describes herself as a “pocket rocket” who is passionate, strong and has a strong moral compass. She’s looking for a bloke covered in tattoos who is loving, patient and kind.\nAccording to the Daily Mail, her friends think she’s a “firecracker” too.\n“I have nothing bad to say about her. She’s the best chick out… Jamie protects those who she loves,” one person spilled.\nShe has over 362,000 likes on TikTok, but her profile has been since set to private.\nInstagram: @jamiemarinos_\nAshleigh Ackerman\nAshleigh Ackerman looks like a sweetheart! The 34-year-old owns a dance school on the Gold Coast and it’s a real family affair. Her younger sister, Danielle, choreographs and teaches at the school while her mother Melissa works as the admin and accounts manager.\nAsh has been a huge fan of MAFS for years and after struggling to find the right guy for her, she’s turning to the experts for help. In fact, she credits MAFS for helping her realise that she was in a toxic relationship.\nThis time around, she hopes to be matched with a fella who is warm, kind and looking to start a family.\nOn her website, she says that owning and having her own dance studio has been a dream of hers since she was eight years old and wanted to bring a “fresh, positive vibe” to the world of dance.\nDaily Mail recently reported that the MAFS 2025 cast member is only recently single after a super messy split. Hopefully, she finds what she’s looking for on reality TV!\nAwhina Rutene\nAwhina Rutene is a 30-year-old aged care worker from Western Australia who is giving some serious Evelyn Ellis vibes!\nShe comes from a big Kiwi family and has a twin sister named Cleo. Awhina is a mum to a six-year-old boy and hasn’t had much time for dating since her 15-year relationship with her highschool sweetheart broke down.\nShe’s hoping to find a guy who will accept her — and her family.\nA sneaky insider told Daily Mail she’s been talking about getting on MAFS for years, so it’s “a dream come true” to finally be cast.\nShe seems like a woman of mystery though, with her Instagram now set to private and no other rumours floating around.\nInstagram: @_awhinarutene\nJacqueline Burfoot\nVision-in-blue Jacqi Burfoot isn’t going to mess around if she gets paired with Harrison Boon 2.0! She is a certified overachiever who currently has a double degree in law and finance, is a certified yoga teacher and holds the title of Miss New Zealand 2012.\nJacqui recently moved to Australia after her relationship of seven years broke down just over a year ago. Now, she’s keen to find a tall, blonde, intelligent man to become her other half. In short, she’s looking for a male version of herself.\nGame recognises game!!!!!!\n“Jacqui is one of the most hardworking, dedicated, and intelligent lawyer-turned-entrepreneurs I know,” a friend told Daily Mail.\n“Jacqui is an absolute delight to be around. She’s fun, loving and has a heart of gold.”\nMAFS 2025 Grooms\nPaul Antoine\nPaul Antoine is a 30-year-old wellness advisor from WA. He moved with his family from France 11 years ago and is looking for a relationship that mirrors the strong, loving relationship his parents have.\nAs a hopeless romantic, Paul feels like he’s tried every method under the sun to land a lady. After a few relationships that ended badly, he spent three years single. Now, he’s hoping the experts can help him find The One.\nMAFS 2025 groom Paul Antoine. (Image: 10)\nIf you feel like Paul Antoine looks familiar, you might recognise him from The Real Love Boat Australia way back in 2022. Yep, MAFS 2025 has continued to scrape the bottom of the reality TV barrel!\nIn an interview he did for the show, he was said to be clean, a fantastic cook and organised.\n“I offer stability, respect sensitivity and independence,” he told viewers. “The perfect date would be the date that makes me forget that I’m in one. Long chats about our lives, past, present and future. I like it when things are spontaneous, and haven’t been planned ahead too much.”\nSo, is he a dream boat or a fuckboy in disguise? It seems he’s interested in reality TV fame rather than love, but there’s always the slim chance he could get both.\nInstagram: @paul___antoine\nBilly Belcher\nBilly Belcher is a 31-year-old plasterer and English larrikin from WA. He moved to Perth from England with his family 15 years ago and is looking for his “miss perfect” to fill the empty spot in his life.\nBilly is a self-confessed mama’s boy who is looking for confident, positive gal who “enjoys Saturday nights at home with a glass of wine and a home cooked meal”.\nApparently, Billy has been thrown into the mix to spice things up, which I’m a big fan of. Plus, he sounds like he’s got quality banter, which you can never have enough of.\nA source told Daily Mail he’s a “top bloke”, filled with “personality and style”.\n“We knew he would bring something unique to the show… casting someone from England was important. The show’s success overseas has shown us that viewers love seeing a mix of backgrounds and cultures,” the insider claimed.\nInstagram: billybelcher7\nAdrian Araouzou\nGroom Adrian Araouzou is an e-commerce business owner based in NSW. He is the oldest of five kids in a big Greek family… similar to one of the brides, isn’t it?\nThe 30-year-old is super confident, ranking himself a 10 out of 10 for looks and personality. Although he believes he ticks the boxes, he’s always on that self-improvement kick. He is hoping to find a gal who is open, honest and comfortable in her skin.\nAdrian is the owner of a sports leisure brand called PAKDsport. He started the business in 2022, and they create bags that combine style with functionality for all those sporty peeps out there.\nHe’s also got a cheeky white belt in Jiu-Jitsu and Daily Mail claims he’s tipped to be “one of the stand-out grooms of the series”.\nDave Thomas Hand\nI know height isn’t everything, but 2025 groom Dave Thomas Hand is 6.7ft tall. Despite the 36-year-old’s height and tattoos, he describes himself as a lovable, friendly giant and notes that people often judge him for the way he looks.\nDave was previously engaged but sadly his relationship fell apart a year into the engagement. Once that crumbled, he spent a year working on himself. Now, he’s turning to MAFS in the hopes of finding the one.\nAlong with owning and running a caulking company, Dave is known on TikTok as the has over 30,000 followers on TikTok and loves to share videos of his day job.\nHe also happens to be a model and bodybuilder. This man is made for TV!\nInstagram: @dth_9\nJeff Gobbels\nJeff Gobbels is a 39-year-old electrician from Victoria determined to settle down and raise a family.\nGrowing up, Jeff was raised by a single mum who he calls “his hero”. His childhood made him realises how important it was to meet the right woman to start a family with.\nAs a big ol’ softie, Jeff is looking for a partner who has similar values, interest and supports him.\nAlthough he’s listed as an electrician, Jeff seems to have been an aspiring actor, having nabbed a part as police officer Kurt Bridges in Neighbours back in 2017 for three episodes. That seems to have been his biggest role, but he’s also acted in The Whistleblower, The Warriors, Undertow and A Promise Carved in Flesh.\nDoes this count as being a silver screen star? (Image: 10)\nInstagram: @jeffgobbels\nEliot Donovan\nEliot Donovan is a 35-year-old business owner from Queensland who is on MAFS to find the right woman to start a traditional, nuclear family. He wants the house, the white picket fence, and to be a provider for his family.\nIn the past, Eliot has described himself as a “lone wolf” who had extremely high standards for his partners. Now, he’s hoping to create a long-lasting partnership with a classy, elegant woman.\nEliot seems to like to rub shoulders with celebs. Daily Mail reports his social media show him hanging out with Simone Holtznagel, influencer Krystal Dawson and The Bachelor’s Kiki Morris.\nAn insider source described him as a “super fun guy” who is “ready to put his party lifestyle behind him”.\nInstagram: @eliot.donovan\nJake Luik\nJake Luik is a 30-year-old self-confessed nerd from Perth, WA. Although he works as a teacher in his day job, Jake spends his spare time watching YouTube, Anime, playing computer games, and going to karaoke. Honestly, same, dawg.\nJake reckons he’s got golden retriever boyfriend vibes because he’s caring and full of energy. However, he admits that some people find his limitless energy kind of annoying.\nMAFS 2025 groom Jake Luik. (Image: Southern River College)\nUnlike the typical MAFS contestants, he’s not an influencer but works as a wellbeing coordinator at an independent public high school in Gosnells. He works with year nine students at Southern River College, so no doubt they’ll have fun sledging him for going on the show.\nTony Mojanovski\nTony Mojanovski is a 53-year-old charter captain from NSW, so if MAFS fails and he turns out to be good television talent, put this man on Below Deck!\nTony is a Wollongong local who loves nothing more than being out on the ocean. Although Tony has been married twice — and both have fizzled out — he misses the connection and joy that comes with marriage and partnership. He hopes that he’ll be able to find a genuine, supportive, energetic gal he can enjoy life with.\nHe’s our oldest groom this year and according to Daily Mail, he loves fishing, the gym and his dog. A simple man!\n“Tony doesn’t like conflict so I’m not sure how he is going to handle the dinner parties when things heat up,” a friend said.\nTim Gromie\nTim Gromie is a 38-year-old primary school teacher from Victoria who has been unlucky in love. He’s turned to MAFS a year on from his last breakup. He was just about to propose to his girlfriend when she ended the relationship suddenly.

Where have all the philosophers gone? I have a warrior’s mentality.”\nFkn yikes, man.\nTeejay Halkias\nMAFS 2025 groom Teejay Halkias. (Image: StarNow.com)\nAlthough this one isn’t tooootally official, it’s widely rumoured that Big Brother Australia’s Teejay Halkias is joining the cast as an intruder groom. According to Daily Mail, he has a link to MAFS 2024 bride Eden Harper. Could she be making a return?\n“Teejay is definitely going to bring some serious vibes to the MAFS experiment,” an insider said.\n“He’s a lover boy at heart, but he’s not afraid to speak his mind, which could either make him a perfect match or stir up some major drama.”\nInstagram: @teejayhalkias\nHow many contestants are there in MAFS Australia 2025?\nThere are usually 10 main couples in the cast of MAFS. If the show follows previous seasons, there will be two intruder couples that join the show part way through.\nWhat’s the prize for winning MAFS Australia?\nWell, there’s no cash prize for winning MAFS Australia, but you can find your one true love. Statistics aren’t on the cast’s side, with solid couples like Michael and Martha being few and far between. From Season 11, only two couples remain together – Jack and Tori and Jade and Ridge. Many contestants also become influencers or make it big on OnlyFans, so that’s a prize in itself.\nFilming for MAFS season 12 is currently underway, and while we don’t have an official air date yet, it’s expected to air in early 2025. I can’t wait!!!\nFeature Image: Instagram @rhidisljenkovic, LinkedIn, TikTok @siliconevalleycaulking)",
