  "body_text": "LOOK: Donovan Edwards shares amazing message at local high school\nMichigan football running back Donovan Edwards may be defined by many of his fans as a standout on the gridiron, but as a person, Edwards would define himself by his faith in Jesus.\nEdwards has been very outspoken about his Christian faith over the past year, bringing up Jesus at every opportunity — whether it be in a press conference or a more informal setting. And that’s continued through the offseason. On Monday, the standout tailback shared a video on X (formerly Twitter) where he met with Christian athletes at local Saline High School, just minutes away from Ann Arbor, where he spoke about staying true to the faith even through tough times, while also posing for photos with those in attendance.\nWatch below:\nEdwards knows something about patience and perseverance. After a breakout 2022 season where he suddenly was the talk of college football after his big games against Penn State, Ohio State, and Purdue, Edwards fell into the background a bit in 2023, really struggling to find his footing. But his shining moment finally came in the national championship game, where he rattled off two long touchdowns on as many touches. After the game, he spoke about his patience paying off.\n“I realized I was stressing myself and I was putting pressure on myself and I shouldn’t,” Edwards said. “My therapist talked to me about putting expectations on myself and you shouldn’t do that because when the expectations, when you don’t receive that expectation you put on yourself, you’re just gonna get into a cluster in a repeated cycle of, OK, I’m gonna do this, it doesn’t happen, you’re gonna be mad about it.\n“So today, I just relieved myself, you know? I saw my therapist this week — on Slack for like three months — I saw him just this past week before we came out here. I just let everything be free. I’m not even gonna worry about this. I’m just gonna let God do what He does and just control me in this game. So, what a beautiful feeling and I’m just gonna give my testimony.”\nEdwards decided to return to Ann Arbor for one more season, his senior year, where he hopes to rekindle some of the on-field fire that made him a national star. Assuredly, in the meantime, he’ll continue to spread love, joy, and his conviction in Jesus Christ.",
