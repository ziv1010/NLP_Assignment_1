While recuperating I wasn’t thinking about anything else other than that. I had no doubts – obviously, the road was long, there are some days when you don’t trust yourself or things look very far away but I’ve learned from all those moments.\n\"It’s all about putting another droplet in the glass every day, so the moment when you’re back gets that little bit closer. To be prepared, like I am now, for another crack at a major tournament.\"\nPutellas, who is ranked No.14 in FourFourTwo's list of best current women's players, has won 29 trophies with the Spanish giants but adds the winning feeling doesn't get old.\n\"I love my job. I love being able to play this sport. In the end, there’s something addictive in winning for me. I’ve been lucky to win quite a lot in my career, not as much as keep wishing, but I have to be realistic and I’ve won plenty of titles.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\n\"That fills my tank with petrol and having a strong mentality to go again for another game, another trophy, another goal is something I’m constantly in touch with.\n\"The normal thing as years go by is to lose a bit of that love, that drive, but for me it’s the opposite – the mentality that I have to win drives my passion for football.\"\nPutellas was speaking after creating a special advert with Thierry Henry where the pair dropped into Spanish bars unannounced to watch live football, but would only stay if the bar served Lays crisps!\nThe 31-year-old explained: \"Honestly, it was such an honour because those Lay’s adverts are legendary, with some of the biggest players in the world, so to be a part of one of those commercials this year was amazing.\n\"If you’d asked me years ago, I’d have told you something like this was unimaginable, so I’m very proud to be part of it and had a great time.\"\nAlexia Putellas was speaking to FourFourTwo on behalf of Lays as part of the 'No Lays, No Game’ campaign\nSarah joined the FourFourTwo team in September 2024 in a freelance role.
