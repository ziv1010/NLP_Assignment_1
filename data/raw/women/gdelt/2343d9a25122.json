  "body_text": "Craig Johnston describes the Newcastle Jets as \"brilliant, brilliant, brilliant\", draws comparisons to Leicester City's famed English Premier League title run and backs the Hunter-based outfit to go all the way this season.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nJohnston, a Liverpool legend and proud Novocastrian, was in Pacific Park this week alongside the touring Women's Asian Cup trophy.\nAnd while Johnston praised the Matildas and acknowledged the career of local product Emily van Egmond, he spoke passionately about the high-flying Jets who have soared to the top of the A-League Men's ladder after last year's Australia Cup success.\n\"It's been brilliant, brilliant, brilliant,\" Johnston said.\n\"And it reminds me of what I consider the greatest story ever told in the history of sport, let alone soccer. It's about Leicester City.\n\"Leicester City were about to get relegated, about 10 years ago, and the next year they won the Premier League.\n\"They beat Manchester United home and away, they beat Liverpool home and away, they beat Chelsea home and away, they beat Manchester City home and away.\n\"Why? Because they wanted it more.\n\"They understood it was about each other, the 11 of them going out there and trying harder, trying smarter.\n\"You know what's happening at the Jets right now, exactly that.\n\"They are loving who they are, the enthusiasm of youth.\n\"Knocking down all the coaching barriers and nonsense, by the way the coach is doing a brilliant job and knows what's going on here.\n\"They've got this magic confidence, it's a spiral and it goes up and up and up.\n\"It's what happened at Leicester and why they won the Premier League.\n\"Lets just hope Newcastle can continue that, and go the youngsters that's what I say.\"\nWhen asked if the Jets could win the domestic league come the end of 2025-2026, Johnston replied: \"If they keep up the energy they've created amongst themselves, 100 percent. That's why I told you about Leicester.\"\nAny advice for the Newcastle squad with 10 regular-round fixtures left, starting with the Glory in Perth on Friday (9:45pm, AEDT)?\n\"It takes the youngsters to create an internal, I call it the currency of confidence - you trust each other, you trust the manager, you trust the town,\" Johnston said.\n\"And you say we are Novocastrians and we're better than the Sydney-ites and the Melbourne-ites and you name them.\n\"We're faster, we're fitter, we're tackling better, we're moving off the ball.\n\"Someone gets the ball, you give them three or four options. How? By running off the ball with energy.\n\"That doesn't happen a lot these days, but when it does that's the magic of sport and the magic of football.\n\"And it's happening right now with these boys and the manager.\n\"And I've got to say, this new ownership group [Maverick Sports Partners], they know what they're doing too, they're smart cookies.\n\"How long have we waited for this, for our Leicester moment.\n\"Well get down there and watch them because the Leicester moment is happening to Newcastle.\"\nJohnston's final message: \"No jinxes, just keep going boys.\"\nJets coach Mark Milligan, speaking from Perth on the eve of a February 13 showdown with the Glory at HBF Park, responded to the high-profile rap.\n\"Absolute legend of our game and Australian football as well and was fortunate enough earlier on in the season to go and witness his night that he had [Civic Theatre show] and stories that he told,\" Milligan said.\n\"I don't think, not only as Australian football but as a nation that we pay enough respect to what he went through and what he achieved both on and off the field as a footballer.\n\"For him to say anything positive about us, I think we're extremely privileged to have those words coming from him.\n\"I'd love for him to be more involved in what we do and I know it's difficult in our game.\n\"To have someone of his stature, someone of his status paying attention, it's a privilege [and credit] to what the boys have done.\"\nThe Jets, on the back of a club record six straight wins, currently have 30 points and sit two clear at the top of the ALM ladder after 16 appearances (10-6).\nNewcastle, who claimed a maiden Australia Cup last year, have played in two ALM grand finals for one win (2007-2008) and one loss (2017-2018).\nLeicester City claimed the English Premier League title with a fairytale run in 2015-2016.\nJohnston also expressed his disappointment in Newcastle not being allocated any fixtures for the upcoming Women's Asian Cup, hosted across Sydney, Perth and the Gold Coast from March 1.\nTURNING POINT\nNewcastle Jets coach Mark Milligan describes it as a \"turning point\".\nAs the Novocastrians prepare to face the Glory in Perth on Friday (9:45pm, AEDT), Milligan reflected on an earlier season loss to the same opponents.\nA-League Men's frontrunners the Jets, claiming victory in eight of their last nine starts, have now accounted for all-but three of 11 other sides throughout 2025-2026.\nAs a quirk in the draw would have it, Newcastle meet those same opponents - Perth, Macarthur and Central Coast - all in a row the following three rounds.\nThis provides Milligan's men with an immediate opportunity to, not only turn the tables on earlier results this campaign but extend their current club-record winning streak and complete somewhat of a competition clean sweep.\n\"I think the last game against Perth was a little bit of a turning point for us,\" Milligan said on Thursday.\n\"There were a few players that started to really understand and believe in the football that we played.\n\"Even though we didn't get the result that day, we still played some fantastic football and it was quite a dominant performance at home.\n\"We've always set out to be a team that is hard to beat, that wins game, a team that's successful, and if you want to be successful in any aspect of the game then you have to go and beat every team.\"\nNewcastle went down 2-1 to Perth at McDonald Jones Stadium on November 23 and 5-4 to Macarthur at home on Boxing Day after suffering a 3-2 derby defeat away to the Mariners in round one.\nAuckland, Sydney, Victory, Adelaide, City, Brisbane, Wellington and Western Sydney have all been in the Jets firing line this campaign.\nMilligan didn't forecast any squad changes for the upcoming clash while revealing both Kosta Grozos and Zach Clough had stayed at home to continue rehabilitation from respective injuries.",
