  "body_text": "Cockburn Aquatic and Recreation Centre: New facilities completed as part of $16m revamp to boost women’s sport\nNew female and unisex change rooms, spectator seating, umpire facilities and multipurpose education spaces have been completed at the Cockburn Aquatic and Recreation Centre.\nA new undercover terrace can seat up to 250 spectators.\nThe new facilities were opened on September 4 as the Fremantle Dockers trained on Victor George Kailis Oval to prepare for their elimination final match.\nThe change rooms will directly support the Fremantle Football Club’s AFLW program at the oval and improve amenities for community sporting clubs and the general public.\nThe State Government contributed $2.5 million to the project, Fremantle Football Club $4.3m, the WA Football Commission $350,000, and the AFL $300,000.\nIt complements a $9.6m revamp of the ARC Health Club, which included more gym and studio floor space, by the City of Cockburn.\n“The new AFLW change rooms, community change rooms, a multipurpose community room and space for spectators is another step towards the facility becoming a match venue to suit various levels of football,” mayor Logan Howlett said.\n“ARC’s health club improvements were completed in July, and have been monumental for members.\n“The feedback we have received so far has been incredibly positive as we make it easier for more people to embrace healthy lifestyle choices here in Cockburn.”\nSport and Recreation Minister Rita Saffioti said the redevelopment and expansion of the Cockburn ARC would encourage more women and girls to get involved in sport and active recreation.\n“This is a great outcome for the Fremantle Dockers and their AFLW program — purpose-built, inclusive facilities like these ensure our elite women’s teams have the support they need to train, recover and perform at their best,” she said.\n“We want to see more women and girls playing sport, coaching, umpiring and leading, and that starts with the right facilities. This is about building safe, inclusive spaces that support everyone’s participation.\n“We’re levelling the playing field — giving women and girls the opportunity to take part in sport with the same quality facilities as everyone else.”\nCockburn MLA David Scaife said the new facilities would ensure Cockburn ARC continued to be one of WA’s premier recreation centres.\nThe Dockers’ loss at the weekend saved the city $50,000.\nCouncillors voted on September 2 to pull $50,000 out of the 2025-26 budget for events around Cockburn Central and Cockburn ARC — but only if the Dockers made the grand final.\nA report to the council said it was a chance to call Cockburn the “home of the Dockers”.",
