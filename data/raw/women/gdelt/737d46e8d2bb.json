  "body_text": "When Andrew Luck shockingly retired from the NFL in 2019 at 29 years old, he needed to find another job.\nSo the former Indianapolis Colts quarterback went back to school and graduated from Stanford with his Master’s degree in 2023. An opening to be the general manager of the Cardinal — the school’s football team — caught Luck’s eye.\nIn a story from The Athletic about Luck’s retirement and life after football, it was revealed that the former quarterback put together a résumé after Stanford’s human resources department needed one.\nBut Luck only really ever had one job.\n“If you don’t count clock operator my senior year of high school,” Luck told The Athletic.\nWhen it came to putting references down, three people came to mind. One of them was his close personal friend and former New England Patriots quarterback Jacoby Brissett.\nThe other two references were Frank Reich — the last coach Luck played for in the NFL — and Colts general manager Chris Ballard.\nBrissett and Luck were teammates on the Colts for two seasons before the latter retired. Brissett became Indianapolis’ starting quarterback after Luck retired. He also started 16 games in 2017 after Luck missed the entire season due to a shoulder injury.\nIt’s unclear if Stanford reached out to any of Luck’s references, but he got the job in November 2024. Luck wasted no time making changes. He fired coach Troy Taylor after two investigations regarding Taylor’s conduct toward women staffers and brought in Reich as the new coach on an interim basis.",
