My kids would love it, and only two left in stock. But just before clicking buy, I checked the reviews, it was a scam.\n“Don’t let the build up to Christmas cloud your senses. Scammers don’t take the holiday season off, and whether it’s through ‘buy it now’ ads, impersonating your bank, or offering a too-good-to-be- true investment, they will be looking for ways to be the Grinch that steals more than your Christmas.”\nHere are some tips to avoid scams from Santander, which has further fraud awareness advice on its website:\n1. Always take time to think before making a payment and pay extra attention to the warnings you bank shows you while making it. They are in place to help you bank safely and avoid being scammed.\n2. Be wary of buying good from a social media – especially if it is something that is sold out everywhere or being sold at a price that seems too good to be true. If you have not seen the item in person, there is a high chance it could be a scam.\n3. Anyone can be easily impersonated, and criminals can make the caller identity, email address or name appear like the genuine caller. So, if you get an email, text or call, check it is genuine by phoning them back on a known and trusted number.\n4. Always take time to complete extra checks when you make a payment. This is to make sure the person and the payment are genuine. This can be reading reviews, researching companies or websites, and checking the person or company is who they say they are.\n5. Think you are buying from your mate? Call them first. Fraudsters hack people’s social media to sell fakes to their friends. Always speak in person using a number you trust, not one they have sent you.\nPeople who are worried about a potential scam can call the 159 – a simple-to-remember number that many banks have signed up to. If someone thinks they have been scammed, they should contact their bank immediately. Scams can be reported to Action Fraud.",
