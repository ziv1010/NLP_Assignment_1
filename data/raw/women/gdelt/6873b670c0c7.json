In practice this might be a good idea but in games it makes the player’s head look enormous and also makes them look ridiculous IMO. Football is a violent contract sport that a lot of people love, making the players look ridiculous is going to be bad for the sport. Since this is voluntary this year it will be interesting... -\nLesbian model-turned DEI manager is fired by university for posing in front of Israeli flag emblazoned with swastikas - and is now suing over claims her free speech rights were violated (Minnesota)\nA model-turned DEI manager who was fired because she posed in front of an Israeli flag emblazoned with swastikas is now suing because her First Amendment rights were 'violated'. Mashal Sherzad, 29, was fired from her position as the diversity, equity and inclusion manager at the University of Minnesota because of now seemingly deleted pictures that she accidentally uploaded onto her public social media of her posing in front of the controversial flag. Sherzad, who identified as Muslim, and who is in a relationship with a woman, began her role in October, 2023, and travelled to Barcelona to attend a... -\nUSAA Scorns Its Trump-Voting Members By Debanking The Lawyer Who Defended Him\nNow John Eastman, one of the attorneys who worked with former President Donald Trump, has been debanked by both Bank of America and USAA. That USAA debanked Eastman for his ties to the 2020 election contest comes as a surprise. USAA — now an insurance, financial services, and banking powerhouse headquartered in San Antonio, Texas — got its start in 1922 as a mutual self-insurance company for Army officers. Its clientele is mostly service members, veterans, and their families, with membership limited to those who can show a military tie. That means that, per a 2019 Pew Research poll, its... -\nBiden roasted for agreeing to debate Trump on Howard Stern: 'His handlers must be furious!'\nPolitical commentators joked that Biden’s staff is panicking after the gaffe-prone president said he would be \"happy\" to debate Trump during an interview with Howard Stern Friday. \"I don't know if you're going to debate your opponent,\" Stern said. The president replied, \"I am, somewhere, I don’t know when. I'm happy to debate him.\" Biden's comments represent a shift from past remarks about possibly debating Trump. Last month, he told reporters it would depend \"on his behavior.\" Trump was quick to challenge Biden to debate him, declaring on Truth Social, \"Everyone knows he doesn’t really mean it, but in case... -\nHulking autistic boy, 17, filmed battering female teacher's aide for threatening to take away his Nintendo switch files lawsuit claiming school staff 'triggered' him\nAn autistic Florida teen who knocked a school staffer unconscious for threatening to take away his Nintendo Switch has filed a lawsuit against the district, accusing them of failing to meet his needs. Brendan Depa, 18, was just 17 when he was caught on video pummeling a teacher's aide, Joan Naydich, at Matanzas High School after she requested another teacher take away his gaming console. Depa was arrested and charged as an adult with aggravated battery on a school employee, a first-degree felony carrying a potential sentence of 30 years behind bars. The teen filed a request for due process... -\nPermanent sterilization is rising among young Americans… and it started before Roe fell\nA recent study released by the University of Pittsburgh and Boston University has found that the number of individuals choosing permanent sterilization methods has continuously risen over the past few years. While the study focused on the sharp rise in sterilization following the Supreme Court’s overturn of Roe v. Wade with the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, it also notes that sterilization was already on the rise prior to Dobbs — reinforcing the trend in population decline seen worldwide. Per the report, which was published in the JAMA Health Forum, there was an immediate jump in tubal ligations... -\nScope of Presidential Immunity Discussed [semi-satire]\nThis week, the US Supreme Court heard arguments over the scope of presidential immunity. The issue arose as a result of special counsel Jack Smith's prosecution of former President Donald Trump for questioning the outcome of the 2020 election. During the discussion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked about former President Obama's drone strikes on American citizens. Department of Justice (DOJ) attorney Michael Dreeben said \"we looked at this very carefully and determined that the federal murder statute does apply to the executive branch. So, if the president orders that someone be killed it is considered a lawful act. President Obama ordered... -\nColumbia bars Gaza encampment activist who said 'Zionists don't deserve to live' and discussed beating them to death...four months after holding disciplinary over his vile remarks\nA Columbia student who posted a livestream in which they stated 'Zionists don't deserve to live' has finally been barred from the university campus, four months after making the incendiary comments. Protester Khymani James, who served as a spokesperson for the pro-Palestinian encampment as a member of Columbia University Apartheid Divest, was banned from stepping foot on the university grounds on Friday and now faces disciplinary action. James, who uses 'he/she/they' pronouns, said in the video that 'Zionists don't deserve to live' and people should be grateful James wasn't killing them. -\nRFK Jr to file lawsuit against TIKTOK ban\n@RobertKennedyJr I’m going to file a lawsuit challenging the TikTok ban on Constitutional grounds. Don’t be fooled — the TikTok ban is not about China harvesting your data. That's a smoke screen. Intelligence agencies from lots of countries, especially ours, are harvesting your data from everywhere all the time. TikTok isn't even majority Chinese-owned, and the company agreed to put its data behind a U.S. firewall. The Biden administration rejected that deal. Congress and the administration don't understand that TikTok is an entrepreneurial platform for thousands of American young people. They want to screw them over just so they can... -\nIndian students' deaths in the US – the community wants answers\nDejected. That's how Jey Sushil, a student at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, says he feels. Mr Sushil is still shaken by the death in February of fellow student Amarnath Ghosh, a 34-year-old classical dancer from India. Local police are investigating it as a homicide case. Mr Sushil says he found out about Ghosh's death through a friend in India before receiving any information from his university. \"They told us after two days. Students are not very happy with the overall response. It's like, who cares about how Indians feel?\" Ghosh was fatally shot off campus in a city... -\nDaily Mass Gospel Reflection- Who Do You Serve\nJohn 14:1-6 Friends, in today’s familiar and majestic passage, Jesus exhorts us to trust him: “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You have faith in God; have faith also in me.”So much depends on the spiritual meaning of the little word “trust.” Jeremiah the prophet laid it out as starkly and simply as possible: “Cursed is the man who trusts in human beings, who makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns away from the Lord.” And conversely, “Blessed are those who trust in the Lord, the Lord will be their trust.”What does it mean to trust, to turn one’s... -\n\"... and I leave all my possessions to my Doctor\"; The story of Harold Shipman Britain's most prolific serial killer\nHarold Frederick Shipman (14 January 1946 – 13 January 2004), known to acquaintances as Fred Shipman, was an English general practitioner and serial killer. He is considered to be one of the most prolific serial killers in modern history, with an estimated 250 victims. On 31 January 2000, Shipman was found guilty of murdering fifteen patients under his care. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a whole life order. Shipman hanged himself in his cell at HM Prison Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on 13 January 2004, aged 57. The Shipman Inquiry, a two-year-long investigation of all deaths certified by Shipman,... -\nCoalition of 17 states sues EEOC for ‘hijacking’ bill to include abortions\nSeventeen states are suing the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for unconstitutional overreach after its recent mandate that all employers must offer accommodations for women who get abortions under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA). Passed last June, the PWFA stipulates that employers must offer workplace accommodations to pregnant women, including assistance such as time off for medical appointments and recovery from childbirth, as well as accommodations related to seating, breaks for food, water and restroom needs, breastfeeding, and miscarriage. However, last week, the EEOC issued a rule clarification stipulating that abortion will be included as a covered “medical... -\nDid you know that Ivermectin can be used to treat cancer, Covid, long covid, vaccine injuries, the flu and autoimmune disease?\nDid you know that Ivermectin can be used to treat cancer, Covid, long covid, vaccine injuries, the flu and autoimmune disease?@DrSyedHaiderjoined @BreannaMorelloto detail the benefits of Ivermectin and how to safely obtain ivermectin for your home. https://twitter.com/BreannaMShow/status/1783629663354384525 -\nJames O'Keefe @JamesOKeefeIII | I have evidence that exposes the CIA, and it’s on camera. I am working on releasing a story that I believe is the most important of my entire career.\nhttps://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1783893674805571829 -\nHow do you get siblings to be nice to each other? These Latino families have an answer\n[...] To say Caitlynn cares for — and loves — her little sister would be a huge understatement. \"My sister is my best friend in the entire world, and I tell people that all the time,\" she says proudly. \"I don't think I could make it day to day without her. She's the person I turn to for everything.\" This genuine love and kindness doesn't stop with her sister. She feels the same about her little brother, who's also still in high school. A few years ago, she seriously considered moving with him to Los Angeles to help support him... -\nAMERICA PRAYER VIGIL (April 27, 2024) *PRAYER\nJoin with fellow FREEPERS to pray for AMERICA: For those in Authority in Government, Family, Military, Business, Agri-Business; End to Sex Slavery; Healthcare, Education, Churches, and the Media.

The Millenial Left may have nodded along to Bernie Sanders’ old labour-Left leanings. Still, they largely abandoned the class struggle of old for a struggle against boutique oppressions that were contingent but intersecting, hence the rise of so-called “intersectionality.” That’s the once-trendy academic philosophy that relies on a view of power relations of society, where advantages and disadvantages are filtered primarily through identities: race, gender, and sexual orientation.... -\nDoorley belligerent in traffic stop video, berating officer that she was the DA and didn't care (DA flees traffic stop, calls Chief to demand they stop)\nDistrict Attorney Sandra Doorley repeatedly ignored officer commands when stopped for speeding in Webster this week — telling them she was the DA, didn’t care about the reason for the stop and that they should leave, footage released by the Town of Webster shows. “I am the DA of Monroe County,” she told the officer at one point in the interaction captured by the officer’s body worn camera. “...I don’t really care. You know what, if you give me a traffic ticket, that’s fine. I’m the one that prosecutes it, OK? Just go ahead and do it. Go ahead. Go...\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected!
