They were selected from 135 applications that were submitted by students from Adams, Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Perry and York counties.\nThe Best & Brightest were honored during a ceremony on Tuesday, May 14, at Colonial Golf and Tennis Club. The speaker was Danielle Conway, Dean and Donald J. Farage Professor of Law at Penn State Dickinson Law.\nThe presenting sponsor for the ceremony was Renewal by Andersen of Central PA. The supporting sponsor was UPMC.\nDuring the ceremony, each winner was given a framed portrait taken by award-winning PennLive photographer Sean Simmers, along with a gift card. Dean Conway also presented each winner with a gift card.\nAt the awards ceremony, the winners saw a video submitted secretly by their family and friends expressing their support and encouragement.\nStudents are invited to apply for the Best & Brightest award themselves. They submit an application along with two letters of recommendation and an essay describing how they have made a difference in their community and/or school and how that experience will help them to contribute to a better society.\nThe process of evaluating the applications starts with a panel of nine current and former educators that determine a list of semifinalists.\nThen, a panel of nine judges representing various parts of the community such as faith, education, the arts, government and business, evaluate the semifinalist applications and selected the 20 winners.\nThe goal of the Best and Brightest program, founded in 1993, is to highlight high school seniors who are making a difference in their schools and communities while achieving academic success and in some cases, overcoming tremendous obstacles.\nThese are the members of the Best & Brightest class of 2024. Their profiles are written using information they provided in their applications. Not all awards, activities and honors are listed. The honors listed are primarily for the 2023-24 school year.\nGrace Akande\nSchool: Central Dauphin East High School\nParents: Jonathan Akande and Teclaire Ngayo\nIn her words: In her essay, she wrote about Culture Day at Central Dauphin East High. “Celebrations like these grant me all the reason to attend school with positivity each morning. Even as I prepare to become an undergraduate, I aspire to continue to invite diversity to flourish as it does at East High. Emphasizing the importance of cultural inclusion allows students to present their heritage and gives their peers the opportunity to appreciate it. From displaying international flags across school, preparing authentic meals from one’s origin to share, and even performing artistic demonstrations, students can find their home away from home. As an individual who is passionate about learning from other backgrounds, these celebrations must not get lost behind a single annual event but be welcomed in all situations. Although I cannot bring my community with me, I can advocate for love and acceptance no matter what new environment I encounter.”\nIn their words: “Grace is an outstanding, hardworking, and intelligent student, and truthfully, there are not enough adjectives to describe her character or what she contributes to our CD East High School Community and stakeholders. .. Grace is academically ranking among the top of her senior class ... Being a part of her educational journey is a blessing.” – Luther Green Jr., principal, Central Dauphin East High School\nHonors: Universal Cheerleaders Association All-American (3 times), Big 33 cheerleader, National High School Cheerleading gold medalist 2024, cheerleading captain, captain of the lacrosse and field hockey teams, Coca-Cola Scholarship semifinalist, Temple University provost scholar, DePaul University presidential scholar, Niagara University trustee scholar, University of Southern California presidential scholar, National Honor Society, Tri-M Music Honor Society, French Honor Society, College Board African-American Recognition, College Board PSAT recognition, Quest Bridge College Prep Scholar, Elks MVS scholarship semifinalist.\nActivities: Cheerleading, lacrosse, field hockey, president of Key Club, president of Tri-M Music Honor Society, French Club, student council, class president for four years, African-American History Club, secretary of National Honor Society, school Student Voice and ATSI committees.\nMentor: Bria Mosley, cheerleading coach, Central Dauphin East High School\nPlans: Grace plans to major in accounting at the University of Pennsylvania.\nLeah Allewelt\nSchool: Susquenita High School\nParents: Sean and Sarah Allewelt\nIn her words: She made it her goal to increase the participation in and success of mini-Thon, managed by student council. She was elevated to the roll of president of student council as a junior and is president this year. The event has raised more than $20,000 in the past two years and set a school record. “I have worked exceptionally hard to inspire others and to revive the school spirit at Susquenita. I have put hundreds of hours into organizing, which, in turn, has aided in raising thousands of dollars for children with pediatric cancer. This money has made a difference in so many lives inside and outside of my community.”\nIn their words: “Over the course of the last [20] years as a building principal I have worked with many talented students, but every once in a while, a student comes along whom embodies ‘THE’ ideal model student.

My whole life has been filled with waiting and honestly, I am glad. Most people keep their lives moving and never have the opportunity to reflect. I did. All the times I waited for the bus I thought about what I wanted to do with my life and how I could rewrite my own story. All the times I sat in an Uber or Lyft, I met someone new who opened my eyes to new perspectives. … My life wasn’t bad, it was just different. You can rush all you want and get the same results on the outside, but when you take a deeper look within you will know who is fit to succeed.”\nIn their words: “Enjalai possesses a unique combination of academic excellence, involvement in extracurricular activities, and personal qualities that make her an exceptional student.

Before I go, I hope to leave a legacy in SCOR, guiding future members through the basics, such as proposal writing, and creating a stepping stone to bigger ideas. By creating templates and documents that can last forever, I can be assured that I left opportunities behind for others: the opportunity to grow. This may be the end of my story at Milton Hershey, but my growth as a leader and my craving for improvement has only grown stronger over the years.”\nIn their words: “Academics aside, Yanni is one of the strongest young women I know. She has faced challenges in her life that most cannot begin to comprehend, and despite all of this, she has persevered and come out on top. As a teacher our job is to educate, but also to nurture students and help them grow into young adults. I am humbled in saying that Yanni has done the same for me, and taught me how to be a better teacher and genuine individual.” – Frank Komykoski, engineering and design instructor, Milton Hershey School\nHonors: First place regionals, Skills USA in related technical math; second place regionals, FBLA, business calculations.\nActivities: Residential assistant, president of Student Government Branch: Spartan Community Outreach, Mu Alpha Theta, cross country, Skills USA, runs half marathons, volunteers at Spartan Spirit Store; The Hershey Company internship.\nMentor: Ashley Spence, Milton Hershey School student\nPlans: She will pursue a degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Pittsburgh.\nCara Cronin\nSchool: Hershey High School\nParents: Art and Donna Cronin\nIn her words: Her sister, Ali, was her first field hockey and lacrosse coach and inspired her to coach younger players.\n“Ali’s love for playing and competing was contagious and made me passionate about both sports. I wanted to have the same impact Ali had on me on other kids. Every summer since 7th grade, I volunteer to coach at the same Hershey youth field hockey and lacrosse camps that I attended. I also get to coach my own teams during the fall and spring seasons for each sport. When Covid hit, camps were cancelled, and seasons were cut short. I missed the opportunity to coach during much of my freshman year. After Covid, I was excited to resume my role. Despite having multiple bilateral leg surgeries during my sophomore year, I did not let it stop me. I love teaching skills and game strategies, and especially being a part of their development in becoming better players and teammates. My goal is to make the sports that I love, adored by younger players, like Ali did for me.”\nIn their words: “I have known Cara as a student leader from her freshman year when she would come into my classroom to work on projects or to collaborate with others in our Student Council. Cara impressed me, even then, for her willingness to approach others with kindness and her openness to volunteer for anything that needed to be done. Cara is not the type of person to shy away from a challenge nor the type of person to allow others to be uncomfortable in their environment. ... Cara is a calm, introspective leader who makes it a point to connect with others.” – Erin Ives, English teacher, Hershey High School\nHonors: AP Scholar, College Board; National High School Coaches Association Academic All-American; dual enrollment with Elizabethtown College and Princeton University in senior year; National Field Hockey Coaches Association High School National Academic Squad; PA High School Field Hockey Coaches Association GPA Award; National Honor Society; Mu Alpha Theta math national honor society;\nActivities: Captain of the field hockey and lacrosse teams, homecoming court, vice president of her class, student council, founder and president of Hershey High School Play It Forward Club, mentor with high school Link Crew, technology intern, classroom assistant for AP computer science, youth field hockey coach, youth lacrosse coach, volunteer with Joy of Sports Foundation, piano, snowboarding.\nMentor: Andrew Maya, computer technician and head soccer coach, Hershey High School\nPlans: She will study computer science at Harvard University.\nCaroline Cunningham\nSchool: Trinity High School\nParents: Sarah Yerger and Martin Cunningham\nIn her words: “During my senior year, I was selected by the student body and school administration to be School Captain, the highest student leadership position at Trinity, and expanded my mission to promote kindness among all 500 students. Although my experience as House Captain gave me the skills to organize events and foster student engagement, it is in this new role that I have learned the art of mediating issues between students, working to make sure that all students feel included, collaborating with administration, and championing student initiatives and ideas - all while honing my own leadership skills. To build inclusivity, I organized themed training sessions, including one on kindness to highlight that leadership is about uplifting others.”\nIn their words: “Over these past four years, it has been one of the greatest joys of my teaching career to watch her flourish in her leadership roles. I have seen her unite students who would typically not work together, grow from challenges, and learn to pivot while planning and implementing school activities. She has surpassed my expectations in every way, and she not only possesses but excels in the soft skills effective leaders embody. Her humility, compassion, and integrity are remarkable, especially for someone her age.” – Michele Stager, director of house system and English department chair, Trinity High School\nHonors: National Merit Scholarship commended student, AP Scholar with Honor, Certificate of Merit from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for outstanding performance on SAT or ACT, National Honor Society, Spanish Honor Society, French Honor Society, Math Honor Society.\nActivities: Student Government captain, captain of the girls’ soccer team (PIAA 2A District III champion 2023); track and field; Trinity Social Justice Committee; DECA Business Club, first place awards in district and state competitions; mini-Thon; Model UN; Mock Trial; Key Club; Biomedical Club; French Club; Spanish Club; World Cultures Club.\nMentor: Michele Stager, director of house system and English department chair, Trinity High School\nPlans: She will major in public health and international relations at Tulane University with a minor in Spanish.\nDayasia Drayton\nSchool: Central Dauphin East High School\nParents: Mark and Stacy Hawthorne\nIn her words: “The passion I grew for art therapy has helped me tremendously by helping me learn more about myself, others, and my community. It even inspired me to be interested in psychology, which may be my field of study in college. My devotion to helping one another find their peace within themselves is what matters to me. By spreading awareness about these underlying issues of mental health through bringing art therapy to my club. Through my leadership in the Self-Care Club, we practice ways to maintain balanced well-being and love ourselves.”\nIn their words: “Beyond her academic achievements, Dayasia possesses a heart full of kindness and empathy. She consistently demonstrates compassion and understanding towards her peers, creating a supportive and inclusive atmosphere in our classrooms. Dayasia has a unique ability to connect with others on a personal level and offer assistance when needed. Dayasia was adopted and prior to being so, experienced pain and challenges that no child should.

He and his father created Adleys Army to raise money and promote awareness of ATRT. “Cancer sucks. Every day my little brother has to fight for his life. It makes me appreciate all of my blessings and I am thankful for every day that I have with Adley. Each day that I have with my brother is a gift whether he is running and playing at my baseball games or in the hospital going through another treatment. Helping others and bringing community together is the biggest lesson that I learned. I hope to carry this life lesson with me as I start the next chapter of my life.”\nIn their words: “One thing that has always been so evident in his life is his respect and kindness toward other people, not just to me as a pastor, but toward his teachers, his coaches, his parents, and even his peers. ... You could ask anyone who has known or interacted with Anderson French, whether in athletics, in the classroom, in church, or in the cash register line at Walmart, and they would observe and tell you the same story, because this is just who Anderson is! He really is an amazing young man, head and shoulders above so many of his peers not just in stature, but in his character and integrity.” - The Rev.

The most important message of the program has been to be your best self. I had the opportunity to spread this message with my family and local schools around me. It was incredibly important to me to teach my younger siblings about the importance of working to be your best in all aspects of your life. I was able to teach them about having ambition, trying to be healthy, and the importance of giving back to your community. My siblings were able to learn about the importance of each of these aspects of their life, and it was very important to me to spread this message to the younger generations of students in my school as well.”\nIn their words: “Namya’s character is marked by her integrity, responsibility, and humility. She is well-respected by peers, teachers, and coaches alike. Namya demonstrates concern for other students by taking time out of her school day to tutor students in mathematics.

She is the most diligent high school athlete I have ever worked with, as she shows commitment not only to her academic and athletic endeavors, but to her personal growth and to community outreach as well. ... Julie is currently the salutatorian of her graduating class of over two hundred students — a testament to her academic excellence and her unwavering pursuit of bettering herself through academic knowledge. ...

During my time at the hospital, I’ve met with many elderly patients, talking about various topics from our favorite pies to our top vacation destinations. No matter the subject, every time I leave the room, I’m gifted with smiles that let me know how powerful just listening to others can be. ... I’ve learned that volunteering is not one person donating their time to benefit others. Volunteering is a reciprocal relationship where both sides benefit. As these elderly patients have enjoyed our conversations, I have begun to understand how kindness is something that resonates with all ages, races, and genders.”\nIn their words: “Yanwei is a determined, involved, and caring student who actively seeks out new opportunities to challenge herself. ...

I have helped transform our program from a mediocre program without accomplishment to a proud program with a great team culture and a team celebrated by the community. Kids in the community can see that where you come from does not impact what you can accomplish. Just because where you are does not have a path to what you want to achieve, athletically or otherwise, does not mean that you cannot forge your path. If I could do it over again, I would not change a thing. All the stress, sacrifice, and long days have been worth it to bring pride and contribute to the community.”\nIn their words: “He understands the value of humans for who they are, he loves others unconditionally, and he cherishes the viewpoints and life journeys that others bring with them. I am eager to watch Aidan continue to mature and am thrilled to walk along with him as he ventures off to do far greater things in life, on, but more importantly, off the tennis court. If our country had more young men like Aidan we would be in a far greater place.

I am the first non-kicker to play in Lebanon County and many other areas. ... Football has been the best journey of my life and I would be incomplete without it. I’m very fortunate to share the journey with my community and show them the lessons and experiences I’ve encountered along the way.”\nIn their words: “Having retired from three decades in public safety, coaching high school football has brought me immense joy. Coaching Sara Miller has been an honor and a true pleasure. Sara doesn’t just face obstacles; she confronts them with unwavering determination and grace. In today’s uncertain times, my generation often worries about the future, lacking exposure to bright young minds like Sara Miller. If my peers knew individuals like her, they’d share my optimism. Sara embodies this generation’s sensitivity and concern for others and the world, superior of past eras but with a work ethic of a past generation.” - John Wetzel, volunteer football coach at ELCO\nHonors: National Honor Society, Spanish Honor Society, Lancaster-Lebanon League All-Academic Second Team All Star, wide receiver; Lancaster-Lebanon League Section 3 second team and defensive all-star award.\nActivities: Football; captain of the basketball team; track and field; RaiderTHON Club secretary; football and basketball youth camp volunteer; youth track coach; Intermediate School mentor.\nMentor: Luke Williams, family friend\nPlans: She will attend Flagler College but has not decided on a major.\nVraj Patel\nSchool: Cumberland Valley High School\nParents: Nagendrakumar and Hetalbahen Patel\nIn his words: “As I continue on this path as an aspiring medical professional, I strive to further my passion for improving patient care through biological research and gaining a strong understanding of medical sociology to make well-informed diagnoses for diverse patient circumstances in college.

He is and has remained the valedictorian of his graduating class throughout high school. As if this was not enough, he has done so without showing any signs of stress, ego, or even a hint of strain. ... Through his care and commitment to others, future-focused mindset, and possession of numerous responsibilities, he is an excellent example of what it means to be a strong, capable, and compassionate leader.” - Erick Hoffman, social studies department, Cumberland Valley High School\nHonors: Scholar in Mumbai Power Plant Project, first place in HOSA State Biomedical Debate Competition, National Honor Society, AP Scholar with Distinction, youth representative for the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre Nuclear Division.\nActivities: School Model UN founder and president; president of school DECA; American Cancer Society youth chapter leader; radiation oncology treatment LINAC operator/shadower; ANATA Initiative communications director; volunteer at Penn State Holy Spirit Medical Center; Key Club; Penn State PULSE program.\nMentor: Erik Hoffman, social studies department, Cumberland Valley High School\nPlans: He will major in biomedical engineering and biosciences at Rice University.\nHeaven Poles\nSchool: Harrisburg High School SciTech Campus\nParent: Jezebel Freytes-Burgos\nIn her words: “I was born with all odds against me. Growing up in America as an Afro-Latina & plus-sized female, it always felt like I would never be able to win: because of the looks, the stares, and the spiteful comments. At times it pulled me down and made me feel less confident in my abilities in this world. ... I took the societal currents working against me and used them as opportunities to educate myself and learn about the importance of building self-worth among young ladies who come from a similar background as me. And I put those lessons into action. I began by helping to start a Black Student Union at school; here, we allow ourselves to be both transparent and vulnerable, intending to share what we believe are our failures. We find ways to support each other in overcoming these perceived deficiencies. Knowingly, we can help each other overcome the negative stereotypes and expectations of so many.”\nIn their words: “I selected Heaven to work as my Biology Lab Assistant, this school year. In addition to the prepping, setup, and cleanup of lab experiments and dissections, having Heaven has been an asset to the current students in the Human Biology course. Heaven has been able to act as a teaching assistant, providing support and instruction to students during lab activities. In all my years of teaching, I have not had a student like Heaven. Her unending drive for perfection and amazing organizational skills set her apart from the average teen. Her level of responsibility and competence in the lab far exceeds her peers. It will be extremely difficult to find another student to replace her, after she graduates.” - Rebecca Hardie, science teacher, Harrisburg School District\nHonors: University of Denver, first team pick, Collegiate World Series; volunteer of the quarter, National Hispanic Institute; National Honor Society\nActivities: Owner and head baker, Heavenlyy Creationz LLC; chief student recruitment officer, Harrisburg, National Hispanic Institute; marching band section leader; vice president, Black Student Union; senior class treasurer; student council; student ambassador; LatinX member; Key Club; Be My Eyes; high school representative on William Penn task force; lab assistant; tutor.\nMentor: Rebecca Hardie, science teacher, Harrisburg School District\nPlans: She will double major in nursing and public health at New York University.\nPaige Reddig\nSchool: Ephrata High School\nParents: Michael Reddig and April Rodgers-Reddig\nIn her words: She has been a member of the Ephrata Robotics Team since ninth grade when she said there was a belief that girls “should not be in robotics.” “I had the most amazing experience as a junior and was able to offer more to the team. We opted to put all of our efforts into one robot. I would act as co-programmer and have major responsibilities for the first time. The team backed me every step of the way, my successes and even my failures. My co-programmer had more experience but never dismissed my ideas and helped me to improve. I was responsible for the 15 second autonomous programming and later reprogramming of the firing mechanism. It was hard and took hours of work with testing and retesting of the code. We won the Think Award for programming, qualified for States, and Worlds. While at Worlds, there were complications and I was able to help my team.”\nIn their words: “The first thoughts that come to anyone’s mind who knows Paige are, devoted, diligent, hardworking, and an out-and-out willingness to go that extra mile to do what it takes to achieve. In class, she has always shown a desire to succeed, has a great attitude, and a willingness to allocate more time when needed. ... Paige is a very dedicated and distinguished individual. I feel overly confident that she will be able to continue her success in her studies and will develop into a strong leader and pillar of our community in the future.” - Bret Marzock, mathematics teacher, Ephrata High School\nHonors: Robotics - think, sportsmanship and create awards; school recognition for competing in robotics at the state and world levels; Flash Fiction Award publishing contract for a book she wrote, “Three Sisters of Doom.”\nActivities: School robotics team and lead programmer; Karate black belt and instructor; best of show awards for seven years in youth needle art at the Ephrata Fair; crafting, sewing and quilting; art; book club; assistant to the costume director for school theatrical production of “Mamma Mia!”; photographer; piano; tennis.\nMentor: Kimberly Houck, martial arts instructor\nPlans: She will major in computational biology at the University of Pittsburgh.\nEliana Roof\nSchool: Dauphin County Technical School\nParents: Christopher and Sharon Roof\nIn her words: “I’ve always loved building things - getting to use my hands while my mind moves a mile a minute - turning one thing into another - two-by-fours into tables, or presumptive gender-based stereotyping into respect. Getting to build my future in the construction industry has allowed me to help others obtain their own futures, too. I’ve had the unique privilege of getting to manufacture change in my community - constructing places to help better us all. ... My fight to be a woman in the trades will help pave the way for all those who come after me, showing other nontraditional students that they can do it too, and empowering myself and those around me to see the good that one small action can do - allowing me to keep building up my community one nail at a time.”\nIn their words: “It’s difficult to talk about her intellectual promise, as I’ve yet to find her limits. Eliana is one of the most intelligent and empathetic students I’ve known. She enjoys research and desires to understand the world. This curiosity, blended with her capability, is impressive. ... Eliana has overcome myriad challenges. Being a female in a male-dominated industry has pushed her to tap an inner-strength allowing her to discount any who question her place. Additionally, she’s confronted stereotypes of the intersectionality of being an intellectual female in the construction trades. She’s consistently overcome these to find her place. Eliana has been a leader in and out of school. ... Eliana is an inspiring young woman with an amazing future ahead of her.” - Jeff Williams, English language arts, Dauphin County Technical School\nHonors: Hershey Theater Apollo Awards, honorable mention, outstanding supporting actress in a play; Lower Paxton Twp.

Since then I have pushed myself in school, helping me learn so many new things and encouraging my peers to do their best at the same time. Through my three sports, I have built relationships with many different kinds of students and have tutored some of them along the way. ... Early in the wrestling season this year, I sustained a shoulder injury which crushed the goals I had for my senior season. I had to learn patience, reliance on my doctor and trainer, and prioritization given my skill levels each week with my teammates supporting me both on and off the mat. I realized even more the importance of the team and enjoyed watching and encouraging my younger brother during his matches. Throughout my many sports, academic, and service experiences over the last four years, I have seen the difference that engagement with others can make.”\nIn their words: “I met Henry during his freshman year in gifted seminar. He immediately made an impression on me. I could tell there was just something special about him and I’ve noticed it time and time again in the years since. Maybe it is because Henry always takes the time to say hello and casually chat with me when I see him outside of class. Perhaps it’s because Henry is gracious when it comes to helping others and adds good insight and discussion to our classroom setting. Or maybe it’s the fact that Henry is brilliant yet remains humble. I don’t know exactly what makes Henry so special, but I’ve come to realize that there are some students that just make your day a little brighter and a little better, and Henry is one of those students.” - Melissa Grim, AP calculus and gifted seminar teacher, Spring Grove Area High School\nHonors: National Honor Society; third place at Harrisburg Area Community College regional math competition in 2023; Crispus Attucks Rev.

As class president, I spear-headed a Senior Sunrise with my fellow students, and we gathered on the football field and watched the sunrise to kick off our senior year. I also worked with the administrators at the high school, and this year, the seniors could paint their parking spots for the first time. I partnered with the VFW in East Berlin and held tailgates every Friday before home football games so the student section could build team spirit and camaraderie. I also started my school’s first-ever homecoming parade. I felt a loss and disconnection in the community. I wanted to plan something to unite the community, and the parade did just that. ... Every day, I have pushed myself to make a difference, a change, and an improvement. I will continue to work hard and as we say in 4-H continue to make the best better.”\nIn their words: “Leah is the lifeblood of our high school community. She is involved in a wide variety of school activities, including National Honor Society and student council, and frequently maintains leadership positions in these organizations. Whenever there are significant school events occurring, such as our pep rallies, homecoming festivities, or trunk-or-treats, Leah is always at the forefront of their implementation. She has high expectations for her projects, and works incredibly hard to ensure that these expectations are met. She navigates the delegation of tasks appropriately, and is always willing to work alongside the committees she leads. Despite her tenacity in leadership, Leah is also able to accept feedback and adjust her plans accordingly to meet the needs of the team.” - Nate Mattis, mathematics teacher, Bermudian Springs High School\nHonors: National Honor Society; FBLA, third place in leadership in the district; PAIAA Division III Second Team All-Star, field hockey; Girl Scouts of the USA Silver Award.\nActivities: Class president, student body vice president, secretary National Honor Society, FBLA, varsity field hockey, Girl Scouts, Hanover Fellowship Church, West Virginia 4-H, earning her charting pin.\nMentor: Micala Matatis, social studies teacher, Spring Grove Area High School\nPlans: She plans to major in business management and double minor in finance and marketing at Penn State University.\nMichael Thieblemont\nSchool: Susquehanna Twp. High School\nParents: Dr. Michael and Sandra Thieblemont\nIn his words: For his Eagle Scout project, he created a prayer garden with seating at his church, Word of Grace Ministries. “Today, this prayer garden is used by many churchgoers as a serene place to relax, pray, and meditate. Though this was the end of my road as a Boy Scout, it was just the beginning of many community undertakings to come. The invaluable life skills I have learned and the many experiences I have gained in Boy Scouts has prepared me to be able to continue to be a contributing member of society who values community service to help promote a better society. Furthermore, volunteering has truly given me joy and happiness as I have seen the positive impacts of my time and commitment to various organizations.”\nIn their words: “Michael is a highly respected student leader at Susquehanna Township High School. In my classroom he produced quality work and invested significant time to improve his writing skills and perform well on the AP Exam at the end of the school year. ... He has shown a desire to build community through his volunteer service with several community organizations ... Michael has many talents beyond the classroom.
