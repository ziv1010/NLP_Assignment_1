She described her usual type as a tatted bad boy who looks like he's been in prison. When tatted Joe entered the experiment and said people often assume he's an ex-convict, fans though they'd be matched.\nBut experts Paul C Brunson, Mel Schilling and Charlene Doughlas, hoped to break the cycle for Sarah and matched her with lover boy Dean, who is a hopeless romantic and true gent.\nOff the bat, Sarah admitted Dean wasn't her type and even went on to say if he \"lost some weight and got tattoos\" she might be able to warm to him.\nSarah's reaction to Dean has rubbed fans up the wrong way, especially as her response is mostly centred around his weight. For full transparency, Dean's habit of breaking into rap and song is also largely irritating to Sarah.\nHowever in the preview for Tuesday night's episode (23rd September), she is seen having a chat with Dean where he asks if things would be different if he were smaller and she appears to say yes.\nDean has opened up on the show about how, in the past, he lost 10 stone but became very arrogant and not a version of himself he liked. At his current weight he is confident and fun loving and therefore doesn't intend to lose the weight again.\nTaking to X, one viewer said: \"If this is how Sarah continuously behaves and looks at Dean with disgust, she deserves the toxic relationships #MAFSUK #MarriedAtFirstSightUK #MAFS\"\nOther comments left about Sarah across social media are so harsh that I won't include them here.\nAfter the first episode aired where viewers saw Sarah marry Dean, and Keye marry Davide, Sarah posted a quote on her Instagram story that read: \"So many people inspire me to be nothing like them.\"\nAbove the quote she wrote: \"This one is for the trolls... x\"\nThis comes after 2024 bride Amy Kenyon reminded viewers that the men and women on MAFS \"deserve kindness and respect, just like in real life\".\nReflecting on a year since her season, she shared a photo from her MAFS wedding and wrote: \"Mainly posting this to remind the people watching, please remember that the people you see on your screens are real, just like you, with feelings and a story you sometimes don’t fully see.\n\"The people on your screens deserve kindness and respect, just like in real life. Remember that what you watch on TV or online is often edited or shown through a certain lens, so take it with a pinch of salt and try to watch without judgment.\"\nShe concluded: \"A little more compassion and understanding can make both the online and offline world a kinder place.\"\nLast year the likes of Polly, Sacha and Hannah faced a huge amount of online trolling. Things got so bad even relationship expert Paul had to intervene.\nIn a statement shared to Instagram he said: \"Following my last story on mental health, it's time to take the temperature down around MAFS UK. The nasty and disgusting comments and DMs being directed toward the contributors are unacceptable.\n\"Please remember, this is a television show, created in part for entertainment. What you're seeing are short snippets, not the full scope of every interaction they have.\"\nHe ended by saying: \"In fact, it reflects more on how you feel about yourself than on their behaviour. The show is incredibly popular, and these contributors are on a journey we're not even halfway through.\n\"If you have constructive feedback, please wait until the end of the series to share it. Until then, unless you have something positive or productive to say, just don't say anything at all.\"\nRead more MAFS news here:\n- MAFS UK 2025 groom revealed to have worked on Bridgerton and Wicked\n- Are MAFS UK's Keye and Davide still together?\n- MAFS UK's Davide drops huge clue he and Keye have split\n- MAFS UK's Davide: His age, job, Instagram and ex revealed\n- MAFS UK’s Keye: His age, job, Instagram and ex-husband revealed\n- When does MAFS UK 2025 air?
