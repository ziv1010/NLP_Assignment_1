Germany are good. You can't back away from the fact they are a world-class team,\" said Stanway.\n\"They have won many trophies in the past and are starting a new campaign just like we are. We know we have things to work on.\n\"As a whole, I don't think we need to be disappointed too much. We have a long process to be right for the Euros.\n\"This is a step in the direction - whether it's a good one or a bad one. It's a way that we can learn.\"\nWeaknesses exposed in necessary Lionesses test\nWhile it was only a friendly and there are still more than eight months to go until Euro 2025, the ease in which Germany were able to punish England in the first half was concerning.\nOn too many occasions, England's defence was split apart by a single pass, while the gaps across the pitch were alarming and individual errors piled up.\nGermany's opener came from a mistake by captain Leah Williamson, who gave the ball straight to Linda Dallmann and she was brought down by Millie Bright to earn a penalty.\nJess Carter and Lauren Hemp's failure to track Giulia Gwinn led to the second goal and goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was beaten too easily at her near post when Klara Buhl fired in a third through the legs of defender Lucy Bronze.\nIt was a seemless stream of errors compounded by Germany's ruthlessness on the counter-attack, but Wiegman insisted this was the test they wanted.\n\"I didn't want the result. I wanted us to do a couple of things better of course and I'm not the only one - the players did too,\" she said.\n\"That was disappointing but I think it was a very high-level game where there were so many challenges for us and also for them. That's what we wanted at this stage.\n\"It gave us so much information and showed us exactly what we need to do better and the challenges tactically we had - and so did they.\"\nWiegman's explanation for the goals was \"losing the ball in moments we don't want to lose the ball\", adding that England needed to work on the timing of their high press.\nGoing forward, England were reasonably effective. Alessia Russo and Beth Mead caused problems, while Ella Toone struck agonisingly wide in the first half.\nThey also showed resilience to come from 3-0 down to close the gap to 3-2 shortly before half-time - but it is clear the Lionesses have work to do before next summer.\nWiegman 'happy' with selection - but did it pay off?\nFocus in the build-up to the match this week was on Wiegman's team selection, with several regular starters struggling for domestic form.\nWilliamson, who lifted the European trophy two years ago, kept her place despite calls for Manchester City centre-back Alex Greenwood to come in.\nShe struggled before being taken off in a planned substitution in the second half, while in-form United midfielder Grace Clinton did not get on the pitch.\nGoalkeeper Hampton fought off competition from Mary Earps for her place - but it is not secure after a mixed performance.\nWiegman was pressed on her team selection but said she had no regrets and was \"happy\" with the starting XI she chose.\n\"That's always easy to say after a game. If we had won then the question is different. I'm happy with the starting line-up and the team,\" she said.\n\"What we wanted is to see other players, which we did, and we know there is huge competition going on. That is good for the team.\"\nTottenham's Jess Naz, Manchester City's Jess Park and United captain Maya Le Tissier were among those to come on as substitutes, while Greenwood replaced Williamson an hour in.\nBut it was the same starting XI that drew 0-0 with Sweden in July, and seven of the 11 players had lined up to face Germany in the Euro 2022 final.\nThis was the first of four friendly matches in 2024, giving Wiegman plenty of opportunity to experiment with her team selection.\nShe may still do that with South Africa to come on Tuesday, but this felt very much like the tried and tested - and it ultimately failed to impress.\nAll in all, England will leave Wembley Stadium with more questions than answers.\n'She is not a reactionary manager'\nBrighton forward Nikita Parris, who was part of the squad at Euro 2022, said it was a \"disappointing night\" for England but Wiegman is \"not a reactionary manager\".\n\"The performance is way off where England want to be,\" Parris told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"But Wiegman won't start shouting or screaming - she will [react] in a clear and concise way. She is very methodical in her mindset and how she sees the game.\n\"For sure, the girls are disappointed and they will know from Sarina's body language that she is disappointed.\n\"She will be pointing fingers and saying 'I need more from you here'. That's the sort of manager she is and why she has the respect of the whole team.\"",
