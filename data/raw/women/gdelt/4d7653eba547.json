  "body_text": "MIAMI GARDENS — Already chasing his second Super Bowl ring this season, Miami Dolphins star wide receiver Tyreek Hill is getting another kind of ring.\nHill got legally married over the bye week, he confirmed to media in South Florida as he spoke Thursday in the team’s locker room following practice before Sunday’s game against the Las Vegas Raiders at Hard Rock Stadium.\n“I did get married, to my longtime fiancée,” Hill said Thursday. “It was about time, man. Feel me? So, something that we wanted to do over the bye week, and we did it, went through with it.”\nThe wedding was first reported by TMZ Nov. 8, Wednesday of last week, after Miami held a Tuesday practice during the bye and players were off through the past weekend coming off their trip to Frankfurt, Germany and 21-14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs overseas.\nThe report cited court documents in Travis County, Texas. Hill married his fiancee Keeta Vaccaro, the sister of ex-NFL player Kenny Vaccaro, a safety for the New Orleans Saints and Tennessee Titans over eight professional seasons.\n“It feels good, man,” Hill said. “I feel like everything that’s been happening to me, man, it’s been for good reason. I’ve been locked in in a different way. Discipline with just my whole entire life.\n“The way I just approach everything, I definitely eliminated a bunch of things, so that’s probably why I’m having some of the success that I’m having this year.”\nIndeed. Hill leads the NFL with 1,076 receiving yards, a pace that, if he maintains, would get him to his goal of the league’s first 2,000-yard receiving season.\nWhile legally married, it appears the wedding ceremony will take place at a later time, as Hill spoke in the future tense about ceremony plans.\n“We’re kind of going to do it, kind of just me and her and our family,” Hill said. “She’s the star of the show, and it’s my job to allow her to do her thing, and I just want to see her smile.”\nHill and Vaccaro got engaged in 2021, while the star wide receiver was still a member of the Chiefs. Why make the marriage official on the bye week?\n“I just feel like it was perfect timing,” he said. “Spending a lot of time with my kids, spending a lot of time with her. The conversation just came up.\n“I was like, ‘Babe, we’ve been engaged for too long, like, are you ready to tie the knot?’\n“And it kind of caught her off guard. She didn’t believe me because we’ve been engaged ever since 2021. And it was like, ‘Okay, let’s go do it.’ She was, like, ‘Show me you’re for real.’ And we did it.”\nHill expanded on the aforementioned things he has been giving up.\n“As far as like drinking and as far as like women, as far as like anything,” he said. “I feel like I’m at a stage in my career now where I’ve got to be more mature with anything I do outside of football. Being a father, being a son, being a husband now. I got to stand in that role of being the man that my grandparents raised me to be. I’m loving it.”\nHill, normally playful with his media sessions, was very introspective Thursday, offering candid and heartfelt thoughts. But he still had fun with reporters.\nWith fellow wide receiver Jaylen Waddle behind him in the locker room, often hyping up many of his answers, Hill joked that Waddle hasn’t gotten him a wedding gift.\n“He’s been promising me brunch ever since the beginning of training camp,” Hill started. “I showed up to this place and he stood me up twice now.”\nWaddle had a rebuttal: “Cap (a slang term to refute a statement)!”\nHill continued: “It really sucks because I really be looking forward to spending time with Waddle on off days, but he just doesn’t see it the same way as me.”\nHe also had an anecdote — likely false — about emulating Raiders star receiver Davante Adams on scout team.\n“I was Davante Adams,” Hill said with cornerback Xavien Howard nearby. “I was able to make Xavien Howard fall a few times which was fun. And then, when he fell, I was able to go over to him and explain to him why he fell.”\nHill is looking to rebound against the Raiders as, before the bye week, he was held to 62 receiving yards, about half his season average, against the Chiefs. He had two key drops in the game and had a fumble he lost returned the other way for a touchdown.",
