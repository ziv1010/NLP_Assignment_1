Rest in peace, dad.”\nA spokesperson for the federation told Reuters that Carmona’s father had died on Friday after fighting a long illness.\nCarmona's strike in the 29th minute gave Spain a 1-0 lead over England, and La Roja held on for the its first Women's World Cup championship.\nShe celebrated the goal by lifting her jersey to show an undershirt with the handwritten word “MERCHI.” She said the match that it was a tribute to the mother of a close friend who had recently died.\n“First of all, I want to say that this victory, this achievement, goes to the mother one of my best friends who has recently passed away,” she said, according to Fox Sports. “I celebrated the goal with her shirt and from here, I dedicate this to the whole family with all my love.”\nCarmona, 23, who plays for Real Madrid, also scored in the semifinals.",
