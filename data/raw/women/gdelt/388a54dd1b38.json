  "body_text": "CPAC 2023 – live: Panellists attack Fauci, journalists and migrants as Nikki Haley, Matt Gaetz, MTG and Kari Lake set to speak\nCriticism of Joe Biden’s administration, the Chinese surveillance balloon, attacks on transgender Americans and “wokeness” are recurrent themes at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, a four-day gathering for right-wing activists and Republican officials from across the US.\nIn a joint appearance, Ted Cruz and JD Vance elevated the “lab leak” theory concerning the origins of Covid-19 and raged against Dr Anthony Fauci as the crowd chanted “lock him up”. Other panelists repeatedly returned to familiar conservative grievances and took aim at fentanyl overdoses and immigration, waged anti-trans attacks and criticised the “liberal media,” with several panelists joking about “hunting the media for sport.”\nDonald Trump will be Saturday night’s headliner once again, seeking to re-establish his grip over the Republican Party. Meanwhile, American Conservative Union chair Matt Schlapp, whose organisation runs the conference and who has served as a key figure elevating the former president and his movement, faces accusations of sexual misconduct from a former Republican campaign aide.\nKey Points\nCrowd boos footage of Fauci as Cruz and Vance elevate ‘lab leak’ theory\nFentanyl panic stories hit the stage\nPanelists joke about killings journalists\nLibs of TikTok founder hailed as a ‘hero’ as panelists mock trans people\nMatt Schlapp avoids questions on allegations against him\nTrump continues media vendettas after being ‘soft banned’ by Fox\n11:00 , Joe Sommerlad\nDeep within the bowels of Mar-a-Lago, from behind a greasy keyboard and mounds of McDonald’s wrappers, Trump continues to rebuke Rupert Murdoch, now demanding that he apologise to his viewers. That’s really not likely to happen is it?\nHe also says it’s finally time to call out “fake news”, which is a war cry he has been personally issuing from the better part of a decade by this point but OK sure.\nIn another Truth Social post, he says that rumours suggest the “idiot” Paul Ryan, a former House speaker turned Fox board member, will be fired “like a dog” (ah, how nice to hear that one again) for wrongly, he says, insisting that the 2020 election was all “peaches and cream”.\nHere’s more on Fox reportedly quietly withdrawing mention of Trump from the airwaves.\nTrump ‘soft banned’ from Fox News amid uproar over coverage of election lies\nTrump urges courts to throw out ‘frivolous’ police lawsuits after Justice Department ruling\n10:30 , Joe Sommerlad\nBack on Truth Social, Trump has responded to the Justice Department’s ruling that DC police officers can sue over the Capitol riot with an earnest statement in which he insists his speech that day “repeatedly called for peace, patriotism and respect for our men and women of law enforcement”, which is not how many will remember it.\nMore in Politics\nHe urges the courts to throw out any such “frivolous” legal challenges “in short order” and invoked presidential immunity, arguing that, without it, Joe Biden could be prosecuted over the Afghanistan withdrawal, illegal immigration from Mexico, the opioid epidemic and the “many other terrible crises that he has caused”.\nOr, to put it in a slightly more unhinged format:\nHere’s more on the Justice Department’s determination.\nTrump can be sued by police over Jan 6, Justice Department says\nDeSantis and Pence are too boring for CPAC, according to Trump\n10:00 , Alex Woodward\nTrump says he’s preparing a “monster speech” to cap off 2023’s CPAC conference at his Saturday appearance.\nHis potential 2024 GOP rivals, Ron DeSantis and Mike Pence, won’t be there. They’re too boring to make an appearance, accordingto the former president.\n“The only reason certain ‘candidates’ won’t be going to CPAC is because the crowds have no interest in anything they have to say. They’ve heard it all before, and don’t want to hear it again,” he wrote on Truth Social on Thursday.\nTrump says Pence and DeSantis too boring for CPAC as he’s preparing ‘monster’ speech\nICYMI: Fentanyl panic stories hit the stage at CPAC\n09:00 , Alex Woodward\nIn a panel on US-Mexico border security and the import of fentanyl, Republican US Rep Mark Green revived a familiar and false trope about the synthetic opioid on CPAC panel on Thursday.\nNews outlets have repeatedly picked up local police warnings about dollar bills laced with fentanyl, and police agencies have repeatedly claimed that officers have experienced overdoses or faced some kind of exposure illness after coming in contact with the drug.\nMultiple assessments from toxicologists, public health experts, drug policy researchers and law enforcement agencies’ own guidance when it comes to fentanyl have debunked those claims, which continue to make headlines despite their spurious contents.\n“Pick up a dollar, and it’s got fentanyl on it, and you’re dead,” Mr Green said at CPAC on Thursday. That is false; it is not possible to experience such a reaction from merely touching the drug.\n“Every American,” he claimed, “is at risk” from fentanyl.\nWhich scenario is worse:\na) they know this is a lie and don’t care or\nb) they don’t even bother to learn about the topics they want to make sweeping federal restrictions over? https://t.co/72t59ctP6Q— Ryan Marino MD (@RyanMarino) March 2, 2023\nICYMI: Trump-era ICE director says he does not ‘give a s***’ about being sued over family separation policy\n08:00 , Alex Woodward\nRepublican officials suddenly concerned with the mounting crisis facing people fleeing South American and Central American regimes at the US-Mexico border after Trump left the White House are calling for the impeachment of Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\nFormer ICE director Tom Homan – who said that Mr Mayorkas has “blood on his hands” for fentanyl deaths – repeatedly, falsely suggested that there were fewer acts of violence against people crossing the southern border under the Trump administration.\nHuman rights watchdogs uncovered “massive human rights violations against migrants and asylum seekers” after Trump implemented the so-called “Remain in Mexico” policy in 2019. Nearly 70,000 people were impacted by the policy, but fewer than 53,000 people – less than one percent – were granted relief.\nAdvocates and government agencies also uncovered chaos from the Trump-era Title 42 policy, which prevented people from seeking asylum under US and international accords, and a family separation policy that removed hundreds of children from their families at border crossings.\n“I’m sick and tired of hearing about the family separation. And I’m still being sued about that. I don’t give a s****,” he said.\nDeaths from synthetic opioids soared under Trump’s presidency, from 28,659 annual overdose-related deaths in 2017 to more than 56,000 in his final full year in office in 2020. Deaths have continued to climb, with 71,238 in 2021, the most recent data from the CDC, which notes the increase was half of what it was a year earlier, when overdose deaths rose by 30 per cent from 2019 to 2020.\n“No one did more, bottom line” on immigration than Trump, Mr Homan claimed. He said he offered to work for free because he is so “p***** off”.\n\"I don't give a shit\" -- Tom Homan on families being separated at the border, adding that \"the children aren't always children\" pic.twitter.com/Na1wlLdYpU\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 2, 2023\nBrick suits, lawsuits, insults and pillows: The otherworldly atmosphere at CPAC\n07:00 , John Bowden\nWhile celebrations of Donald Trump and a rallying cry for 2024 were clearly a central part of day one of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), they were far from the only emotions in the air.\nThere was also a deep anger at the mainstream news press, which they argued was nothing more but a tool of the Democratic Party. There was frequent griping from many in attendance about the apparent blacklisting of election deniers by the biggest right-wing networks like Fox News and Newsmax.\nSome, like podcaster and noted sidewalk-parker Sebastian Gorka were utterly hamfisted in their critiques. Mr Gorka was spotted yelling at The Bulwark’s Tim Miller that he was “f***ing fake news” and should “go to hell”, before he told The Independent’s correspondent minutes later that he should “get a real job”.\nExperience day one of CPAC 2023 with John Bowden:\nThe otherworldly atmosphere at CPAC as Trump waits in the wings\nGOP congressman calls Mark Milley a ‘traitor’ and claims children are ‘not safe’ in school\n06:00 , Alex Woodward\nDuring a CPAC panel on Thursday, far-right congressman Ralph Norman of South Carolina called Joint Chiefs of Staff chair Mark Milley – a decorated service member and highest-ranking military officer in the nation’s armed forces – “a traitor”.\nMoments earlier at his CPAC appearance alongside US Rep Scott Perry, Mr Norman dismissed Vice President Kamala Harris as “the giggler” as he mentioned the possibility of impeaching Joe Biden and lambasted the Biden administration and its response to the Chinese surveillance balloon.\nMr Perry said breaches into American airspace should be “met with maximum force” against China.\nIn his closing remarks on the panel, Mr Norman claimed that “our children are not safe” in America’s schools, amplifying right-wing moral panic involving teachers, LGBT+ rights and discussion of race and racism in classrooms and workplaces.\n“What’s happening to them … is evil,” he said.\nTrump can be sued by police over Jan 6, Justice Department says\n04:00 , Alex Woodward\nAttorneys for the Justice Department’s civil rights division determined that the realm of protected speech from the president “does not include incitement of imminent private violence” as a group of US Capitol Police officers and Democratic lawmakers seek to hold Mr Trump accountable for the Capitol riot in a lawsuit.\nAn appeals court reviewing the lawsuit turned to the Justice Department for an opinion in December.\n“Presidents may at times use strong rhetoric. And some who hear that rhetoric may overreact, or even respond with violence,” attorneys for the Justice Department said on Thursday.\n“Just as denying First Amendment protection to incitement does not unduly chill speech in general, denying absolute immunity to incitement of imminent private violence should not unduly chill the President in the performance of his traditional function of speaking to the public on matters of public concern,” they added.\nTrump can be sued by police over Jan 6, Justice Department says\nAmerica’s Frontline Doctors, the Covid denialist organisation sponsoring CPAC\n03:00 , Alex Woodward\nThis year’s CPAC is sponsored by one of the “top purveyors” of Covid-19 misinformation, accotding to a member of Congress, and has been compared to a modern snake-oil salesman.\nThe group, called America’s Frontline Doctors , passes itself as any other medical organisation, but public health experts and critics say it has promoted pseudoscientific Covid cures like using horse dewormer, fostered anti-vaccine sentiment, and abused donor funds.\nThe Independent’s Josh Marcus reports:\nWhat is America’s Frontline Doctors, the Covid denial organisation sponsoring CPAC?\nHouse Republicans hang Oversight chair James Comer out to dry after shocking Beau Biden remarks\n01:00 , Alex Woodward\nOversight Committee chairman James Comer drew outrage from the White House and veterans groups after he suggested that Beau Biden, the late Delaware attorney general and son of President Joe Biden, should have faced criminal charges over a Delaware political scandal in which he was found to have done nothing wrong.\nHouse Republicans at CPAC declined to defend – or condemn – the congressman during Thursday’s events.\nSeveral Republicans, including Matt Gaetz and Ralph Norman, told The Independent’s Andrew Feinberg that they hadn’t seen Comer’s comments.\nHouse Republicans hang James Comer out to dry after shocking Beau Biden remarks\n‘In a really embarrassing CPAC speech, cool dads Ted Cruz and JD Vance tell it like it is'\n00:00 , Alex Woodward\nThe Independent’s Holly Baxter writes:\nWhere else does Jair Bolsonaro, former far-right Brazilian president known for Covid denialism and selling off the rainforest, speak alongside ex-con Steve Bannon and Jewish space laser believer Marjorie Taylor Greene? In other words, where else can conservatives in this country — and by conservatives, obviously, I mean the extreme right of the right-wing Republican Party which only sometimes believes in democracy and definitely doesn’t believe your diabetic child has the right to $35 insulin — truly be free?\nCPAC is the only place.\nIn a cringe CPAC speech, cool dads Ted Cruz and JD Vance tell it like it is\nTrump and DeSantis to visit Iowa within days of one another\nThursday 2 March 2023 23:05 , Alex Woodward\nOn 10 March, Ron DeSantis is set to visit Iowa, long considered the benchmark for presidential candidates’ political viability with its “first in the nation” primary election status.\nThe Florida governor will visit Davenport and Des Moines to promote his new book, The Courage to Be Free, according to the Associated Press.\nThree days later, Donald Trump will be there.\nDeSantis will not be at this year’s CPAC; Trump is headlining on Saturday.\nUnderscoring the division over the GOP’s future, the governor is expected to attend a Club for Growth’s private retreat in Florida, where Mike Pence, Senator Tim Scott, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu are expectedto attend. None are on the CPAC schedule.\nThere’s been little if any mention of Fox at CPAC . Then the CEO of Newsmax brought up the lawsuit\nThursday 2 March 2023 22:30 , Alex Woodward\nThis year’s CPAC does not appear to have coverage sponsorship from Fox News, while competing outlet Newsmax is listed as a presenting sponsor and far-right streaming service Real America’s Voice is named as one of four participating sponsors.\nThere’s been little if any mention of Fox or the Dominion lawsuit against the network, including revelations that the network’s top stars, executives and producers privately rejected bogus claims of election fraud that were amplified on air.\nNewsmax also was sued by Dominion over similar false claims about the voting machine company; the network retracted some of its reporting as part of a settlement in a separate suit.\nAt CPAC, Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy said that if the Fox case was in federal court it would be thrown out.\nHere’s what the Dominion lawsuit against Fox News uncovered:\nFox News, the Murdochs and backstage Trump whispers: The damning Dominion revelations\nKimberly Guilfoyle poses with Mike Lindell\nThursday 2 March 2023 22:20 , Alex Woodward and John Bowden\nA CPAC moment: Former Trump adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr, posed with pillow salesman and conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell.\nMr Lindell, who is scheduled to address the conference on Saturday three hours before the former president closes out the day’s events.\nMs Guilfoyle is scheduled to speak on Friday.\nSebastian Gorka rages at journalists at CPAC hallway\nThursday 2 March 2023 21:55 , Alex Woodward and John Bowden\nFormer Trump administration aide and current right-wing podcaster Sebastian Gorka raged at several reporters, including The Independent’s John Bowden, inside a CPAC hallway on Thursday.\nHe told political strategist Tim Miller of the Showtime series The Circus to “go to hell” and that he is “f****** fake news”.\nHe called The Independent’s Washington reporter a “coward,” “fake news” and to get a “real job”.\nMike Lindell is latest Trump ally to turn on Fox News despite using network to advertise his pillows\nThursday 2 March 2023 21:30 , Alex Woodward\nPillow salesman and conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell on Thursday spent a portion of his day at the CPAC shouting about Fox News – a television network on which he frequently advertises – and airing grievances about House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s decision to let one of that network’s hosts access footage from the January 6 Capitol riot.\nMike Lindell is latest Trump ally to turn on Fox News despite advertising on network\n‘Ted Cruz at CPAC: From presidential candidate to boorish podcast host'\nThursday 2 March 2023 21:13 , Alex Woodward\nThe Independent’s Richard Hall writes:\nToday, the Republican Party is full of Ted Cruz types. At CPAC especially, you can’t move without bumping into a Ted Cruz-alike — ballrooms full of personalities built around owning the libs and making Democrats angry; shock jocks and self-described mavericks. And podcasters, podcasters everywhere.\nThe energy that made Cruz popular in 2016 was directed to Trump — in the eyes of activists, he was brasher, more extreme, more of an outsider — and the party hasn’t looked back since.\nTed Cruz at CPAC: From presidential candidate to boorish podcast host\nFlorida Senator Rick Scott takes the stage with a grim picture of America\nThursday 2 March 2023 21:00 , Alex Woodward\nFlorida Senator Rick Scott entered the CPAC stage to announce that President Joe Biden and “the US Senate, the news media, the Democratic party, academia, Hollywood, Wall Street and many of our big corporations” are “destroying the country.”\nHe mentioned some version of “destroy out country” roughly half a dozen times within his first minute on stage, then outlined Democratic officials’ “evil plan” bloated with right-wing grievances.\n”My message to you is this. People in Washington who don’t like me, they’re not very fond of you either,” he said. “This is the time we have to rescue this country.”\nHe called for CPAC to get more “active,” echoing other attendees who have urged right-wing Americans to get more involved in local campaigns for school boards and other races to inject a CPAC agenda at the local level.\nFull story: CPAC crowd boos Anthony Fauci during cable news compilation on Covid origins\nThursday 2 March 2023 20:30 , Alex Woodward\nA crowd of attendees at CPAC jeered and shouted “lock him up” when an image of Dr Anthony Fauci appeared on screen during the event.\nCPAC crowd boos Anthony Fauci during cable news compilation on Covid origins\nFentanyl panic stories hit the stage at CPAC\nThursday 2 March 2023 20:08 , Alex Woodward\nIn a panel on US-Mexico border security and the import of fentanyl, Republican US Rep Mark Green revived a familiar and false trope about the synthetic opioid.\nNews outlets have repeatedly picked up local police warnings about dollar bills laced with fentanyl, and police agencies have repeatedly claimed that officers have experienced overdoses or faced some kind of exposure illness after coming in contact with the drug.\nMultiple assessments from toxicologists, public health experts, drug policy researchers and law enforcement agencies’ own guidance when it comes to fentanyl have debunked those claims, which continue to make headlines despite their spurious contents.\n“Pick up a dollar, and it’s got fentanyl on it, and you’re dead,” Mr Green said at CPAC on Thursday.

Four of eight US intelligence agencies have leaned toward a natural origin for the virus, with “low confidence,” while two of them — the Department of Energy and the FBI — have “moderate confidence” in the lab theory.\nAlabama senator attacks trans athletes in remarks against ‘the woke playbook'\nThursday 2 March 2023 18:43 , Alex Woodward\nAnother CPAC panel rejected transgender Americans and honest teachings on race, racism and LGBT+ people featured former college football turned Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville, who listed off a string of right-wing targets in a series of baseless statements against trans athletes and US education.\n“All this woke, transgender athletes, CRT, 1619, they don’t teach reading, writing or arithmetic,” the senator said.\nHis remarks on a “Sacking the Woke Playbook” panel dismissed transgender girls and women as “biological boys” who he said should not be playing in any school sport at any age level.\nHe said that sports must be “protected” because “sports have built this country”.\nThe senator also falsely claimed that “half the kids when they graduate they can’t read their diploma” as he condemned “the progressives, the crazies” who are “trying to change family, change things that are our moral values”.\nAt least 150 bills across the US this year would specifically restrict the rights of trans people, according to the Human Rights Campaign.\nWhere’s Ted Cruz?\nThursday 2 March 2023 18:15 , David Taintor\nThere seems to have been a last-minute schedule change at CPAC. Sen Ted Cruz was scheduled to host a segment of his “Verdict” podcast after Sen John Kennedy of Louisiana spoke. However, CPAC head Matt Schlapp and CPAC senior fellow Mercedes Schlapp filled in for a segment before the programme moved on to Sen Tommy Tuberville for a panel on “Sacking the Woke Playbook”.\nIt’s possible a schedule snafu caused the lineup change. CPAC’s schedule notes that “agenda times and sessions are subject to change”.\nTrump can be sued by police and lawmakers over Jan 6 attack, Justice Department says\nThursday 2 March 2023 18:14 , Alex Woodward\nTrump can be held liable for the actions of a violent mob that launched an attack on the US Capitol on 6 January, 2021, the US Department of Justice has determined.\nAttorneys for the Justice Department’s civil rights division determined that the realm of protected speech from the president “does not include incitement of imminent private violence” as a group of US Capitol Police officers and Democratic lawmakers seek to hold Mr Trump accountable for the Capitol riot in a lawsuit.\nAn appeals court reviewing the lawsuit turned to the Justice Department for an opinion in December.\n“Presidents may at times use strong rhetoric.

And on Thursday, she stepped onto the CPAC stage shortly before noon on Thursday alongside several right-wing media personalities to criticise what they have characterised as an unfair liberal media.\nLibs of TikTok has been inked to harassment and threats against drag performers, LGBT+ people and their advocates, particularly teachers, as well as doctors and hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to young trans people. Hours after five people were killed and several others were wounded inside a mass shooting at a Colorado Springs LGBT+ nightclub, Libs of TikTok drew negative attention to a drag performance in the state.\nOn Thursday at CPAC, she was hailed as a “hero” and “courageous” as panelists joked about trans people and pronouns.\nShe called a recent VICE profile previewing her CPAC appearance as an “insane hit piece”.\n“Nothing I love more than to mock and clown the liberal media,” she said.\nPanelist L Brent Bozell III, the founder of conservative watchdog group the Media Research Center, mocked trans people by joking that “if I ever transition I want to be Chaya.”\nCPAC panelists target China over US farmland. How much do Chinese entities actually own?\nThursday 2 March 2023 16:43 , Alex Woodward\nRepublican Senator Marsha Blackburn accused “the Chinese Community Party” of stealing American intellectual property, spying on Americans and their children, and owning thousands of acres of US farmland, suggesting that China is purposefully developing land near sensitive US military sites.\nChina owns roughly 384,000 acres of US agricultural land, according to a 2021 report from the US Department of Agriculture. Roughly 195,000 acres, worth nearly $2bn when purchased, are owned by 85 Chinese investors, which could be individuals, companies or the government.\nAnother 189,000 of those acres, worth $235m, are owned by 62 US corporations with Chinese shareholders.\nBut of the 109 countries that own US agricultural land, China ranks eighteenth.
