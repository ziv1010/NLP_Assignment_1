  "body_text": "South Africa have moved to step in as hosts of the 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) following Morocco’s reported withdrawal from staging the tournament with just 60 days to the scheduled kick-off.\nThe 2026 WAFCON is billed to run from March 17 to April 3, 2026, under a compressed timetable that follows the delayed 2024 edition, which was impacted by global scheduling challenges, including the Paris Olympics.\nThe development was announced on Sunday night by South Africa’s Deputy Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture, Peace Mabe, who revealed that the Rainbow Nation would take over hosting duties after Morocco’s sudden decision to pull out.\nSpeaking at the Super League Awards ceremony in Johannesburg, Mabe confirmed that the handover had been finalised, leaving South Africa with a tight window to prepare for Africa’s flagship women’s football tournament, which also doubles as a qualification pathway for the 2027 FIFA Women’s World Cup in Brazil.\n“Tonight, I would like to announce that South Africa will be hosting the 2026 WAFCON, which we all know is a qualifying tournament for the 2027 Women’s World Cup in Brazil,” Mabe said.\nMorocco’s withdrawal has come as a surprise, especially after the North African nation hosted the men’s Africa Cup of Nations just weeks ago.\nAlthough no official explanation has been issued by Moroccan authorities or the Confederation of African Football (CAF), the decision is believed to follow heightened domestic tensions after the dramatic AFCON final in Rabat, where the hosts lost to Senegal.\nThe 2026 WAFCON was originally scheduled for March 17 to April 3 and will feature an expanded 16-team format. However, it remains unclear whether the dates will change following the switch in hosts.\nThe aftermath of the AFCON final was marred by controversy, disciplinary actions and public criticism, with reports suggesting growing internal pressure on Morocco to step back from hosting further major CAF competitions in the short term.\nSouth Africa’s late confirmation as hosts presents a significant logistical challenge, but the country is no stranger to staging top-level women’s football on the continent.\nBanyana Banyana lifted the WAFCON trophy on home soil in 2022, a triumph that underlined South Africa’s status as one of Africa’s leading forces in the women’s game.\nThe 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations carries added significance, with the expanded format allowing the four semi-finalists to qualify automatically for the 2027 Women’s World Cup. The remaining two African slots will be decided through inter-confederation play-offs involving the losing quarter-finalists.",
