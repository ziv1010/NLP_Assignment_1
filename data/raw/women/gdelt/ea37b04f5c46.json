Kennedy, who once famously said, “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.” Today’s Democrats have turned that on its head, saying: “Ask not what you can do for your country, but WHO you can leverage for your radical agenda.”\nI also stood up for our service members and military families, many of whom are being directly impacted by the shutdown. With Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo and Fort Hood in Killeen, I am fighting to ensure our troops, their families, and federal workers are supported during this time.\nHouse Republicans did our job weeks ago by voting to fund the government with a simple, clean, nonpartisan continuing resolution. It’s time for Democrats to do the right thing and end this senseless shutdown. Watch my full remarks from the press conference here or by clicking the image below.\nJack Smith’s Partisan ‘Arctic Frost’ Investigation\nJack Smith’s ‘Arctic Frost’ investigation into President Trump, Republican lawmakers, and conservative groups has turned out to be exactly what we expected: an unconstitutional political witch hunt. The weaponization of our nation’s top law enforcement agency to target political opponents is unacceptable, especially in the United States.\nThis is exactly why I joined my colleague Congressman Brecheen (OK-02) in calling on Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch a criminal investigation into Jack Smith and every single Biden-era DOJ bureaucrat who attempted to subvert the rule of law and violate the constitutional rights of the American people. I also share the serious concerns of many of my colleagues regarding Judge James Boasberg and fully support an investigation into his involvement. These individuals must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law – and we will ensure this kind of blatant corruption never happens again.\nRead more about our efforts to hold the Biden-era DOJ accountable in the Blaze here or by clicking on the image below.\nRSC Podcast with Special Guests Speaker Johnson and Majority Leader Scalise\nI had a fantastic time hosting the Republican Study Committee’s Podcast ‘Right to the Point’ featuring special guests House Speaker Mike Johnson (LA-04) and Majority Leader Steve Scalise (LA-01). In the episode, we pointed out the reality of who the modern-day Democrats are, as they openly admit to leveraging struggling Americans to appease the radical left flank of their party.\nWe also made predictions on who will win the College Football National Championship, guessing if it will be the Texas A&M Aggies or the LSU Tigers. Listen to the full episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Rumble here.\nTrump Administration Biosimilar Announcement\nThe Trump Administration announced major plans this week to accelerate and lower the cost of biosimilar development. This is a major victory in the fight to lower prescription drug prices and expand access for all Americans. As Secretary Kennedy noted, ‘Parents are facing heartbreaking choices between paying for medication or putting food on their tables. This is not acceptable in the United States of America.’ I am proud to stand with the administration on this effort.\nLast month, I introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation that directly aligns with this announcement by automatically deeming all biosimilars as interchangeable upon FDA approval and eliminating the unnecessary switching studies that delay patient access. The administration has called on Congress to act, and I’m ready to deliver. We stand ready to get this done and ensure more Americans can access life-saving medications without facing financial burdens.\nRead more about the announcement here, and read more about my Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act here.\nOdessa Chamber of Commerce in Washington\nThis week, I had the pleasure of attending the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation Citizen Awards in Washington, DC, where the Odessa Chamber of Commerce was a finalist in the Best Civic Engagement Program category. Even though they did not win the title, our office is incredibly proud of their entire team for this accomplishment and recognition. Texas-11 is the best place to live, work, and raise a family, and I am grateful to represent so many amazing people dedicated to serving their communities.\nUNtaxed Act\nToday, I introduced the UNtaxed Act alongside several of my colleagues on the Republican Study Committee to prevent the United Nations (UN) from ever implementing a global carbon tax. This comes in response to the fact that earlier this year, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) was scheduled to adopt a “net zero framework” for the international shipping industry. This is a de facto global carbon tax on emissions and could increase global shipping costs by 10% or more.\nI am proud to lead this effort to ensure that the UN has no legal authority to impose taxes on American citizens or companies. I also penned an op-ed in the Washington Examiner making the case for the UNtaxed Act. Read it here or by clicking on the image below.\nAmerican Cattle Ranchers are the Backbone of Food Security\nI remain fully committed to supporting American agriculture and the hard-working men and women who keep our food supply strong. This week, I met with leaders from the Texas Cattle Feeders Association, and I spoke with House Speaker Mike Johnson about the reports of potential beef imports from Argentina. My stance hasn’t changed: American cattle ranchers are the backbone of our food security and a cornerstone of our economy, and we must support them. They work tirelessly to provide the highest quality beef for American families. Today’s higher prices are a result of strong demand, not a shortage of supply, and importing foreign beef would only discourage U.S. ranchers from expanding their herds and investing in domestic production.\nBringing in beef from countries with checkered animal health records also risks the integrity of our domestic herds and undermines the gold-standard health and safety practices upheld by American producers.\nMason Town Hall Next Week\nI will be hosting a community town hall in Mason next week. I hope to see you there!\nMason Town Hall\nTuesday, November 4th at 11:00 am\nMason Bank\n111 Westmoreland Street\nMason, Texas 76856\nICYMI: Government Shutdown Resource and FAQ Page\nAs your elected representative, I want to ensure you have the information and resources you need to understand how the government shutdown may impact you and your family. Please visit my website here or by clicking the images below to access our Government Shutdown Resource and FAQ Page for answers to common questions and guidance on available federal services.\nAs previously mentioned, my offices remain open and ready to serve constituents across Texas’s 11th District. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if my team or I can be of assistance.\nThank you for reading. It is the honor of my lifetime to serve you in Congress.
