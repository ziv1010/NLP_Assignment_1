  "body_text": "The Wisconsin Badgers are officially in offseason mode, as they fell short in a 91-89 loss to the BYU Cougars on Saturday, sending them home before the Sweet Sixteen for the eighth straight season.\nBadgers mailbag: Ask your Wisconsin-related questions\nIt’s transfer portal time for the Badgers.\nDespite a fervent comeback, the Badgers couldn’t get the job done, seeing one of the more promising teams in recent history go home earlier than desired.\nNow, it’s on to a huge offseason for head coach Greg Gard and his staff, as the Badgers will have to replace six scholarship seniors this offseason, with much of the work coming via the transfer portal.\nWisconsin was successful in the transfer portal a year ago, finding the country’s best transfer with John Tonje, and they’ll look to parlay their success into landing big in the portal once again.\nLooking elsewhere, the Badgers football team has begun spring ball with a completely different roster, as they saw 25 players enter the transfer portal, while nearly two dozen came into the program from another school.\nWisconsin also hired offensive coordinator Jeff Grimes to replace Phil Longo, so the Badgers’ new-look offense will be on display over the next few weeks, with philosophical changes already being present.\nAdditionally, the defense underwent an overhaul in the transfer portal, especially up front, and will be a group to watch over the next few weeks.\nOn the women’s hockey side, the Badgers claimed their eighth championship in program history with a 4-3 overtime thriller over Ohio State on Sunday. Kirsten Simms was the hero, scoring the game-tying and game-winning goal to seal the deal for Wisconsin.\nThe women’s basketball team made an interesting hire earlier this week as well, bringing in Robin Pingeton as their next head coach. Pingeton spent the past 15 years at Missouri, going 250-218 there, but had really struggled over the past few seasons, failing to make the NCAA Tournament since 2019.\nFor the first time in a while, I’m looking to do an AMA session, where everyone can ask whatever questions they have about the Badgers, regardless of the sport, in the comments, and I’ll answer each and every one over the next 24 hours.\nDrop your Badgers-related questions in the comments down below!",
