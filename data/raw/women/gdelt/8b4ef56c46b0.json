The loss has sparked renewed calls from experts for better safety measures on highways to protect vulnerable species.\nFollowing the report, teams from the Fethiye Nature Conservation National Parks (DKMP) Directorate arrived at the scene, where it was confirmed that the caracal cub had died from the impact. Investigations revealed that the young animal suffered a spinal fracture and significant head and internal injuries. DKMP officials collected tissue and DNA samples as part of the ongoing Caracal Species Protection Action Plan.\nDr. Yasin İlemin, Director of the Biodiversity Application and Research Center at Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University, conducted an on-site investigation and highlighted the growing threat to the species. “Caracals are one of Turkey’s five native wild cat species, primarily found in the southwestern provinces, including Muğla, Antalya, Aydın, Denizli, and Burdur,” Dr. İlemin explained.\nHe stressed that the population of caracals is rapidly declining, with highway collisions posing a significant threat. “On average, two caracals die each year due to vehicle accidents in Muğla alone. Concrete barriers along highways block their natural migration paths, leading to these tragic incidents. Lynxes in areas like Seydikemer Plateau face similar dangers,” he added.\nDr. İlemin emphasised the urgent need for “ecosystem transition areas”—designated safe crossings that allow wildlife to move between habitats without the risk of vehicle collisions. “We must implement these transitions at key points along the highways to protect not only caracals but also other wildlife species at risk,” he urged.\nConservationists are calling for immediate action to integrate such wildlife corridors into regional infrastructure planning to prevent further loss of endangered species.\nSource: Fethiye TV\n13th Gastro Fethiye National Gastronomy Festival in Fethiye\nFethiye hosted the 13th Gastro Fethiye National Gastronomy Festival, bringing together chefs from across Türkiye. alongside culinary students, the future chefs of the industry.\nThe festival, held at the Çatalarık Social Facility on 20-21 February, began with chef candidates from various cities competing in individual categories on the first day, showcasing their culinary talents.\nExperienced chefs served as jury members, evaluating the dishes based on taste, presentation, and kitchen cleanliness.

With temperatures dropping to -20°C (-4°F), the river has developed an ice layer up to 30 cm (12 inches) thick, providing an opportunity for residents of Bayraktar village to fish during their free time.\nEarly each morning, fishermen use pickaxes and hatchets to break through the thick ice before casting their nets. To lure fish such as freshwater chub, blackfish, mirror carp, and silverfish, they tap tree branches against the ice, creating vibrations that startle the fish below. In stronger currents, ice sheets serve as makeshift rafts, allowing the fishermen to cross the river safely.\nThe catch is divided among families and shared with neighbours, especially the elderly or those unable to fish. Local fisherman Osman Yıldırım highlighted the tradition’s significance, noting that it has been passed down for generations. “We fish for food and recreation, sharing with those in need and ensuring we respect the fish’s spawning season,” he said.\nUğur Koçanoğlu emphasised sustainable fishing practices, explaining that the villagers only take what they need and fish sparingly in winter to preserve local fish populations.\nAli Yıldırım described the tradition as both demanding and enjoyable, noting the community spirit it fosters during Bayburt’s long winters. “Breaking the ice and pulling out the fish takes a whole day, but it’s a fun and rewarding experience, especially when we bring our children along,” he added.\nThis age-old tradition not only provides sustenance but also strengthens community bonds while promoting respect for nature.\nSource: Daily Sabah\nTürkiye’s Erzurum moves toward UNESCO gastronomy city recognition\nErzurum, one of Türkiye’s leading winter tourism hubs, has taken a major step towards becoming the world’s 57th “City of Gastronomy” under UNESCO’s Creative Cities Network. After nearly two years of preparation, the Erzurum Metropolitan Municipality’s Tourism and Gastronomy Directorate successfully submitted the city’s application, which has now been accepted by the Turkish National Commission for UNESCO.\nThe commission will draft a report to be sent to the UNESCO Directorate for final approval. If successful, Erzurum will join Gaziantep, Hatay, and Afyonkarahisar as Türkiye’s representatives in the global network celebrating culinary excellence.\nErzurum Metropolitan Mayor Mehmet Sekmen highlighted the city’s deep-rooted historical and cultural heritage, spanning the Saltuk, Seljuk, Ottoman, and republican eras, and its growing reputation in the culinary world.\n“Through our application to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network, we aim to officially register and celebrate Erzurum’s unique flavours. Currently, Erzurum ranks third in Türkiye for the most registered gastronomic products, but our goal is to become No. 1,” Sekmen told Anadolu Agency (AA).\nHe also announced the registration of six local cultural and culinary items, including the Erzurum bar dance costume, Erzurum sinisi (traditional tray), Erzurum tava ketesi (a pastry), Erzurum ayak paça çorbası (lamb’s feet soup), and Erzurum göğermiş peynirli pidesi (a cheese-stuffed flatbread).\n“By officially documenting these dishes, we ensure they are preserved for future generations. What isn’t recorded risks being forgotten,” Sekmen noted, stressing the importance of cultural preservation.\nErzurum was recently named the “Tourism Capital” of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) countries, a designation that Sekmen believes can create synergy between the city’s strong winter tourism sector and its culinary heritage.\n“If we secure a spot on UNESCO’s list, tourists who come for skiing will also want to explore Erzurum’s culinary scene. Likewise, food tourists will have the chance to enjoy winter sports. This blend of winter tourism and gastronomy will boost visitor numbers significantly,” Sekmen explained.\nThe final decision from UNESCO could mark a transformative moment for Erzurum, solidifying its position on the global culinary map while enhancing its status as a premier winter tourism destination.\nSource: Daily Sabah\nTürkiye Begins Major Egg Exports to the U.S. Amid Bird Flu Crisis\nTürkiye has started exporting around 15,000 tonnes of eggs to the United States as a severe bird flu outbreak continues to slash U.S. production and push prices higher, a leading industry official announced on Wednesday.\nIbrahim Afyon, chairman of the Egg Producers Central Union in Türkiye , confirmed that shipments began this month and will continue through to July. “The export will take place through our member companies with the required authorisations, while two firms will coordinate the process,” Afyon stated.\nIn total, 15,000 tonnes of eggs — equivalent to 700 containers — will be shipped to the U.S. as part of the agreement.\nThe United States has been struggling to contain the spread of bird flu, which was first detected in dairy cattle in Texas last March.
