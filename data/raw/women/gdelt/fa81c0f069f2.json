  "body_text": "In an early season battle of nationally ranked teams Sunday evening in El Dorado, a second half rally fell short for the Barton Community College women's soccer team in falling 2-1 at 12th ranked Butler Community College.\nThe KJCCC contest result drops the Cougars to 0-1-1 and 1-1-1 overall with Butler improving to 2-0-0 and 2-0-1 on the year.\nNext up for Barton is a return home league game on Wednesday hosting Coffeyville Community College in a 3:00 p.m. kickoff.\nAn own goal put the Grizzlies on top fifteen minutes into the contest with a second half 1v1 conversion with twenty minutes left provided the eventual game winner.\nNinety seconds later Beatriz Baldi gave Barton new life for the final 17:55 with a turn-n-fire shaped shot to the upper-90 for her third of the year.\nThe Cougars nearly netted the equalizer sixty second later but Katie Potter's unmarked shot from 15-yards out sailed just high of the crossbar.\nBarton outshot the Grizzlies 11-10 overall with each team sending six on frame.\nMio Tanaka took the loss with four saves including a pair of point blank rejections in dropping to 1-1-1 on the season.\nRylie Schiffelbein worked the first forty-five minutes between the pipe with two saves as Millie Robshaw-Charlesworth turned away three Barton shots towards goal.",
