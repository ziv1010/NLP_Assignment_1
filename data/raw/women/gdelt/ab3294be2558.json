  "body_text": "Aggie Beever-Jones still has plenty more she wants to achieve this season after helping guide Chelsea to their sixth Women’s Super League title this week.\nThe Chelsea academy graduate has built on her superb breakthrough season in west London in impressive fashion, notching up eight goals so far this season for Sonia Bompastor’s side.\nOn Wednesday, the 21-year-old added her second WSL medal to her ever-increasing trophy cabinet after Chelsea took advantage of Arsenal’s shock defeat to Aston Villa to wrap up the title with two games remaining.\nAnd Beever-Jones’ fine season then saw her land the Young Player of the Year Award just 24 hours later at the 2025 Women’s Football Awards, a night dominated once again by Chelsea.\n‘Collectively, it’s so nice to win trophies – that’s what we aim to do at Chelsea – but for me, it’s always good to pick up an individual award,’ Beever-Jones told Metro.\n‘I’m always so aware that it’s a team sport and there are so many people who have helped me along the journey, but it’s always nice to get that recognition for yourself.’\nMany would be content enough with the whirlwind 24 hours that Beever-Jones has experienced, but the young forward has not reached such heights so swiftly in her career by resting on her laurels.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nAnd while her league triumph with Chelsea may not have fully sunk in yet, Beever-Jones already has new goals.\n‘We’re obviously still unbeaten in the league and we pride ourselves on that, so we’re not going to take our foot off the pedal,’ she added. ‘We’ve still got another competition to play for (FA Cup), which we’re all super excited about and want to win.’\nAnd then, what about the Euros in the summer? Beever-Jones had just finished the first loan spell of her career at Bristol City when England triumphed over Germany at Wembley in 2022.\nBut having scored her first goal for the Lionesses back in April, the Chelsea youngster doesn’t want to be watching from the stands this time around.\n‘I’d be lying if I said that (making the squad) isn’t the aim and I was delighted to get my first goal the other month,’ she added.\n‘I always like to keep myself focused on the task at hand, and then who knows what will happen. It’s about building on that and continuing to improve and I’m in the right place to do that at Chelsea.’\nChelsea may be the present, but previous loans at the aforementioned Bristol City and then at Everton are as much a part of Beever-Jones’ impressive rise within recent years.\nMore Trending\n‘I think the person I am now, compared to the person who left on their first loan spell at 18, is two different people in a really good way,’ she reflected.\n‘I’ve learnt a lot about myself on and off the pitch; moving away from home, you have to grow up a bit quicker and get used to a new environment where you’re playing professionally week in, week out.\n‘But Chelsea feels like home to me. I’m comfortable there and I’ve got that drive to keep pushing myself every day – I’m really enjoying my time right now.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: William Gallas names surprise team his Premier League flops of the season\nMORE: Alessia Russo: ‘We’re ready to push on and really challenge Chelsea next season’",
