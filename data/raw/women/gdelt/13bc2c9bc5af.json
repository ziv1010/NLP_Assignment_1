Erling Haaland built momentum early with a goal less than 10 minutes in, but then Arsenal managed to take the lead with back-to-back goals before the end of the first half. Just when it looked bleak for City, John Stones found the net again eight minutes into stoppage time to end the game with a draw.\nCity will be looking to get back in the winning column, but Newcastle are hoping to be the first team to hand them a loss this season. Newcastle sits sixth in the standings, tied at 10 points with Chelsea thanks to a 3-1-1 record. The Magpies took their first loss of the season, 3-1, to Fulham last week.\nCity will be weakened after Rodri’s serious knee injury, and Kevin de Bruyne also expected to miss the game. That gives Eddie Howe a chance to change Newcastle’s abysmal record against City. The Magpies have lost all but one of the last thirteen matchups against the Sky Blues. Their last meeting, however, marked the only win of that series for Newcastle, 1-0, at the last Carabao Cup.\nHere’s the Matchweek 5 schedule:\n- 9/28, Newcastle vs. Man City, 7:30 a.m., USA Network (STREAM)\n- 9/28, Chelsea vs. Brighton, 10 a.m. on Peacock\n- 9/28, Brentford vs. West Ham, 10 a.m. on USA Network (STREAM)\n- 9/28, Everton vs. Crystal Palace, 10 a.m. on Peacock\n- 9/28, Arsenal vs. Leicester City, 10 a.m. on Peacock\n- 9/28, Nottingham Forest vs. Fulham, 10 a.m. on Peacock\n- 9/28, Wolves vs. Liverpool, 12:30 p.m. on USA Network (STREAM)\n- 9/29, Ipswich Town vs. Aston Villa, 9 a.m. on Peacock\n- 9/29, Man United vs. Arsenal, 11:30 a.m. on USA Network (STREAM)\n- 9/30, Bournemouth vs. Southampton, 3 p.m. on USA Network (STREAM)\nCan I bet on the game?\nYes, you can bet on the Premier League from your phone in New York State, and we’ve compiled some of the best introductory offers to help navigate your first bets from BetMGM, FanDuel, DraftKings, Bet365 and more.\nMan City is -165 to win, according to DraftKings.\nHere’s a recent Manchester City story, via The AP:\nMANCHESTER, England (AP) — Soccer-related arrests are the on rise in England and Wales, the U.K. government said on Thursday. The most cases were recorded at West Ham matches for the third year in a row.\nThere were 2,584 football-related arrests in the 2023-24 season — a 14% increase on the previous year, figures released by the Home Office showed.\nThe government said the rise was driven by arrests relating to the possession of class A drugs and this year’s European Championship in Germany.\nThe rate of arrests over the season was 5.5 per 100,000 fans attending matches in the top six levels of men’s English soccer, the Welsh league and the top two levels of women’s soccer. Statistics also covered matches involving the England and Wales national teams, the Champions League final staged at Wembley Stadium, and age group matches.\n“It is important that these figures are put into context. Last season around 47 million people attended men’s domestic and international matches, the highest number we have on record, and the vast majority of football fans are law-abiding citizens who want to support their team,” said chief constable Mark Roberts, who is the lead for soccer policing in the U.K. “However, there are a small number of fans who commit offences, and we will continue to work closely with (prosecutors) and our other partners to ensure that those responsible are held accountable.”\nAccording to the figures, there were no arrests at women’s matches, despite their growing popularity and increased attendances.\nFigures showed 281 arrests related to Euro 2024 were made in England and Wales. A further 126 relating to the tournament were made overseas.\nThe club with the highest number of arrests was West Ham, with 103. Manchester City and Manchester United were joint second with 88. Arsenal was fourth (85) and Chelsea sixth (67).\nWest Ham also had the highest number of banning orders (93), with Man United second (89). Second-tier Millwall was third with 82 banning orders.\nA banning order can last from three to 10 years and can be issued by courts for reasons such as a conviction for a soccer-related offense.\nThere were 825 new banning orders, the highest number since 2010-11.\nThe most common type of arrest was for public disorder, which made up 43% of cases, with violent disorder making up 19%. Possession of class A drugs accounted for 13%.\nThe throwing of missiles was the most commonly reported incident, at 416 matches, with pyrotechnics reported at 394 matches.\nThere were reports of hate crime incidents in 341 matches, which related to issues including race (226) and sexual orientation (113).\nThere were 423 incidents of online hate crime.\nWatch your favorite teams\n- Where to watch MSG Network without cable in 2024\n- Best WNBA Finals streaming options: How to watch Liberty vs. Lynx, Sabrina Ionescu live for FREE\n- NFL Slimetime 2024 on Nickelodeon: How to watch season premiere with Nate Burleson for free\n- Buffalo Bills TV schedule 2026: How to watch free live streams today\n- NY Jets TV schedule 2025: How to watch free live streams today\nFuboTV is a live TV streaming service focused on live sports, including U.S. and international soccer, the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL and more.
