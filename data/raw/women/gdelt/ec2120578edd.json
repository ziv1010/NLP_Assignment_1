The Duke of Sussex set up the sporting competition in 2014 for injured and sick military personnel and veterans.\nHeart of Invictus has been released in the run-up to next month's Invictus Games which begins in Dusseldorf on September 9, with Harry set to travel to Germany for the start of the tournament, and his wife Meghan joining later.\nMailOnline takes a look at some of the stories of heroism showcased in the new documentary...\nFormer army captain David Wiseman (pictured next to Harry) played a big part in the inaugural Invictus Games in London in 2014.

'The round travelled the length of my torso, hit my ribs at the back, hit my ribs at the front, rattled around a little bit like a pinball before coming to rest in my right lung.\n'And I stopped breathing. And I stopped breathing a couple of times.\n'When I was a soldier that meant the world to me and then, once I was wounded, well, how do you define yourself then?'\nAlongside Harry, Mr Wiseman was a 'driving force of the Invictus movement'. The veteran previously told the BBC that he realised sport was the vehicle that could help struggling former servicemen find their purpose while he was climbing some of the highest mountains in the world.\nAlongside Harry, Mr Wiseman was a 'driving force of the Invictus movement'.

'We were just like, 'Oh my goodness, let's see what we can do.''\nMr Wiseman helped Harry develop the competition and has also competed in it over the years.\nYULIA PAIEVSKA\nThe series also charts the story of the Ukrainian team preparing for the competition in The Hague in 2022 against the backdrop of the Russian invasion.\nIt tells the story of paramedic Yuliia 'Taira' Paievska who was training for the tournament when she was captured and held prisoner by Russian troops last year.\nShe was tortured for three months and eventually released in the wake of global publicity at The Hague games about her situation.\nA week after her release, Ms Paievska received a call from Prince Harry which she claimed 'inspired me to continue to fight'.\n'He said that he supports Ukraine and all of us,' she previously told The Telegraph, adding: 'The Invictus Games family always takes care of its members.'\nYuliia Paievska (pictured) received a call from Prince Harry after her release, which she claimed 'inspired me to continue to fight'. She said she was 'very grateful' to Harry because it was after the Invictus Games that Russian troops stopped 'interrogating and torturing me'\nMs Paievska said she first heard about the Invictus Games while she was in hospital after on of her surgeries. She is pictured in February 2021 at an open training session for the games\nMs Paievska also said she was 'very grateful' to Harry because it was after the Invictus Games that Russian troops stopped 'interrogating and torturing me'.\nShe added: 'I think that spreading the word to the whole world influenced their decision to trade me in a prisoner exchange.'\nMs Paievska began working on the Ukrainian frontline in 2014. She was later injured during an evacuation operation.\n'Seven years on the front, I have titanium joints in my legs, my backbone suffers, and I've been having these traumas for a long time,' she told the Netflix documentary, adding that test results revealed she had suffered two heart attacks. Her medical condition forced her reconsider her role as a paramedic.\nShe said she first heard about the Invictus Games while she was in hospital after on of her surgeries.\nTOM FOLWELL\nTom Folwell, a former Army plant operator mechanic, served two tours in Iraq and half a tour in Afghanistan before he lost both his legs in an IED explosion.\n'I lost both my legs. Injuries to my back. The blast went into my forearm. My wrist got pins in,' he told the documentary.\nMr Folwell was in hospital for two months before he underwent over two years of rehabilitation with his prosthetics.\n'After I got blown up, I just...drinking a lot, going out a lot. Not in the best space,' he recalled. Mr Folwell said his wife told him 'something needs to change'.\nHe was made captain of both the GB wheelchair rugby and basketball team, as well as the sitting volleyball team, at last year's Invictus Games.\nHe said he 'didn't have a clue why anyone would consider me' when the coach made him captain.\nTom Folwell (pictured) was made captain of both the GB wheelchair rugby and basketball team, as well as the sitting volleyball team, at last year's Invictus Games. He turned his life around after he lost both his legs and started 'drinking a lot, going out a lot'\n'I've never been in a leadership role in my life, for anything,' he said. 'Clearly someone sees something in me, just not me.'\nThe veteran also inspired England football manager Gareth Southgate last year when they met ahead of the World Cup.\nMr Folwell, in November 2022, told The Lincolnite that he thought Mr Southgate would 'understand how soldiers feel when they suffer life changing injuries with all his football experience'.\nThe football manager said at the time that both military members and footballers 'can find their careers cut short due to injury'.\nHe told the newspaper: 'The inability to function or perform in the same way after injury can often cause significant mental challenges, loss of identity and impact their prospects.'\nMr Folwell, addressing the end of his military career in the Netflix series, said he treats it like a 'past life'. He added: 'My new life [has] started, nothing to do with the military anymore.'\nGABE GEORGE\nGabe George, a retired Navy Corpsman, lost his right arm after it was paralysed in a motorcycle accident in 2008.\nA driver made a U-turn at a light without seeing Mr George and the pair collided, he told the documentary, adding that he woke up three weeks later.\n'I made a pact with my arm. I told it, 'If you don't get better, I'll cut you off,'' he shared. His arm was amputated about 12 years after the accident.\nMr George said he has been in pain 'every day' since. He moves around a lot because it 'keeps my mind off' of the pain and 'keeps my body moving'.\nIt took about 12 years before his arm was amputated, he shared, noting how 'I made a pact with my arm.

However, that dream had to change after he lost his hands.\nMr Hyeongyoon now says that meeting his wife was the best thing to ever happen to him, but the second best was 'starting sports'.\nHe explained that in his homeland having a disability is considered to be 'wrong' and people tend to 'hide themselves away'.\nSouth Korean Army veteran Na Hyeongyoon (pictured) had both hands amputated after being electrocuted in an incident he has no memory of.

I hope that people will give us a fighting spirit!'\nSouth Korea competed in the Games for the first time in 2022.\nKASPAR HOLM HENRIKSEN\nKaspar Holm Henriksen is currently suffering with acute PTSD, a 'devastating hidden injury'. Team Denmark is solely comprised of members living with PTSD.\nMr Henriksen said he was part of the first Danish team to go to Iraq and 'didn't know what to expect' when he was deployed.\nHe told the Heart of Invictus series how the PTSD began following an incident in the streets of Al-Qurnah, where he and his team 'saw fierce combat'.\nHe remembers grabbing his ammunition and running towards another soldier straight across a field.\n'I could hear the shots. They were very close,' he recalled. 'It started the PTSD. The times when they bombed our camp have also left their marks.'\nKaspar Holm Henriksen (pictured) is currently suffering with acute PTSD, a 'devastating hidden injury'.

He said finding the community within the Invictus Games has been 'very important for me'.\nHe hopes competing together will help both him and team find themselves again.\nLike Mr Henriksen, the Duke of Sussex said that returning from his tour in Afghanistan triggered an emotional 'unravelling'. He told the docuseries that the 'biggest struggle for me was that no one around me could really help'.\nHe said he wants the Invictus Games to offer a 'support structure' or 'network' to veterans, which he claims he didn't have himself.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying",
