Following this, he continued teaching up until the mid-1980s when he became a full-time broadcaster with RTÉ.\nÓ Muircheartaigh became RTÉ Radio 1's premier radio commentatorafter Míchael O'Hehir retired in 1985.\nHis last All-Ireland final came in 2010 when he commentated on Cork's win over Down in the football decider, and he retired from broadcasting in October of that year.\nPraised for his iconic commentary, kindness and wit, Ó Muircheartaigh became known for such well-known lines as - \"The stopwatch has stopped. It’s up to God and the referee now. The referee is Pat Horan. God is God.\"\nSpeaking in 2010 ahead of his retirement, he said his work \"enabled me to meet and get to know generations of great sportsmen and women and many of those associated with them\".\n\"It was an honour for me to be at the source of this wonderful entertainment, to be part of a continuous and successful venture,\" he said.\nRTÉ correspondent Paschal Sheehy was one of the first to lead the tributes for the legendary figure, saying in a post on Twitter: \"Sad to relate the passing of broadcaster and proud Kerryman, Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh\".\n\"Micheál was an icon of our sporting culture, a soundtrack to our Sundays. Sincere sympathy to his family. May he rest in peace. Ní bheidh a leithéid arís ann.\"\nThe Taoiseach has described Mr Ó Muircheartaigh as \"a gentleman to his fingertips\" who \"filled a room with a quiet and dignified aura\".\nIn a statement Simon Harris said: \"The word 'legend' gets used too often, but for Mícheál, it is almost not enough.\n\"His voice, his colour, his excitement, his love of sport, his turn of phrase were often as exhilarating as the action he was describing on the pitch as the audience held its breath for what Mícheál would say next.\"\nMr Harris said Mr Ó Muircheartaigh was also a treasured link for a generation of the Irish diaspora and the voice of home as they listened to GAA across the world.\n\"He also had a humour you could not learn - 'Teddy McCarthy to Mick McCarthy, no relation, Mick McCarthy back to Teddy McCarthy, still no relation,'\" he added.\nTánaiste Micheál Martin also paid tribute to the \"iconic\" Mr Ó Muicheartaigh who he said had extraordinary knowledge and a beautiful voice \"that brought to life even the dullest of games\".\nGerry Adams added to the tributes, saying the commentator was a \"fear agus Gael iontach\".\nJerry O'Sullivan, a presenter of Radio Kerry, said in a post online that \"One of the greats is gone\".\n\"Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh RIP. Always remember listening to a pulsating Munster Hurling final in its closing stages with sides level and in full flow he uttered : 'Like the man at the Dingle races said to me last week anything could happen now!'\"\nAr dheis Dé go raibh a hanam.\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",
