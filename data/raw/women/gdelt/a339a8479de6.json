  "body_text": "Bronze played entire Euros with fractured leg\n- Published\nEngland defender Lucy Bronze's middle name is Tough, which perfectly encapsulates her Euro 2025 performances.\nAfter the Lionesses beat Spain in a penalty shootout to defend their European title, the Chelsea full-back told BBC Sport she had played the entire tournament with a fractured leg.\n\"I actually played the whole tournament with a fractured tibia, but no-one knew,\" said Bronze.\nAt 33 years, eight months and 30 days, she was England's oldest player at Euro 2025 and played 598 minutes throughout the tournament, with only Keira Walsh, Alex Greenwood and Hannah Hampton playing more for Sarina Wiegman's side.\nBronze has played more consecutive tournament football for England than any other.\n'Tough times don't last' - Kelly and Hampton shine after adversity\n- Published28 July 2025\nEngland 'rode luck but not lucky' - Williamson\n- Published27 July 2025\n'We'll remember this forever': England fans jubilant as their heroes win again\n- Published27 July 2025\nIn the quarter-final against Sweden when Wiegman had made all of her substitutions, she was shown on camera self-strapping support around her right leg during a break in play.\nHaving helped her side come back from 2-0 down to force a shootout, Bronze went on to score England's winning penalty, slamming her spot-kick into the roof of the net.\nAgainst Spain in Sunday's showpiece, she was limping again but played through the pain and managed 105 minutes in the tense enounter, before leaving the pitch in tears as she was forced off.\n\"I just hurt my knee today on the other leg,\" added Bronze. \"That is why I got a lot of praise from the girls after the Sweden game because I have been in a lot of pain.\n\"But if that's what it takes to play for England, that's what I'll do - they know that. We inspire each other by playing through things like that and it got us to the end, in the end.\"\nBronze’s right knee was heavily bandaged as she watched the penalty shootout and she joined in the post-match scenes mostly hopping on one leg.\nAsked if the injury will stop her celebrating in Basel, Bronze said: \"It's very painful. I am going to party, I am going to enjoy it and that's it.\"\nWiegman confirmed Bronze's injury after the game and said the experienced player has a \"crazy mentality\".\n\"She had some issues with her tibia so of course we tried to manage that,\" added the Dutchwoman. \"When you play 120 minutes you're not managing it are you?\n\"The whole team has a great mentality but she has a crazy mentality, it's unbelievable.\"\n'She is proper England'\nAfter the news of Bronze's injury, her former England team-mate Ellen White told BBC Sport: \"I mean this in the nicest way but she is not human.\n\"I love her and adore her, but she is proper England.\n\"To say she has just won a major tournament on a fractured tibia, that is not normal. That pain must have been insane and she smashed that ball in for the Sweden game.\n\"Fair play to the girls for crediting her. That is true of Lucy Bronze, she will give everything to play for England and win for England as well.\"\nFormer England captain Steph Houghton, who also played with Bronze, described her as \"absolute legend of women's football\".\n\"To be playing that many games consecutively in tournament football is a great achievement,\" she said.\n\"Every performance she does for England is all about that winning mentality and doing what is right for the team. She is always dragging the team forward and really deserves this moment because she is an absolute legend of women's football.\"\n- Published27 July 2025\n- Published27 July 2025",
