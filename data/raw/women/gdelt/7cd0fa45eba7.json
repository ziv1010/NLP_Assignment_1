And more are said to be coming forward following a BBC documentary which aired yesterday.\nSex abuse allegations were first made against Al-Fayed in the late 1980s. But there were no criminal charges. The Mirror reports he is thought to have sexually abused at least 100 women.\nHis alleged conduct has been described as one of the worst cases of corporate sexual exploitation that \"perhaps the world has ever seen\" and that women and girls and \"very young victims\" were targeted.\nA BBC documentary claims he raped five women and deployed an army of aides to silence his alleged victims. Lawyers representing some of the women gave a press conference in London this morning as many of the alleged victims watched on.\nMr Armstrong said: \"I have many years of practice.. I have never seen a case as horrific as this. This case combines some of the most horrific elements of the cases involving Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein.\n\"Savile because in this case, as in that, the institution, we say, knew about the behaviour. Epstein because in that case, as in this, there was a procurement system in place to source the women and girls - as you know there are some very young victims.\n\"And Weinstein, because it was a person at the very top of the organisation who was abusing his power. We will say plainly, Mohammed Al-Fayed was a monster.\n\"We are here to say publicly and to the world, or to Harrods in front of the world, that it is time that they took responsibility, and it is time that they set matters right, and that is something they should do as soon as possible.\n\"They need to face up to accept the responsibility, they have full culpability for the abuse these women suffered. We are going to set out our claim. Our claim shows an abject failure of corporate responsibility and a failure to provide a safe system of work.\"\nBarrister Bruce Drummond told the press conference that it was \"one of the worst cases of corporate sexual exploitation\" that he and \"perhaps the world has ever seen\".\nHe said: \"This is one of the worst cases of corporate sexual exploitation that certainly I, and perhaps the world has ever seen. It was absolutely horrific and I can't stress that word enough.\" He added that \"the system that procured them was enabling the abuse\".\nMr Drummond said some of Mr Al Fayed's accusers have ended up in \"psychiatric care\". He added: \"This should never have happened and Harrods must accept responsibility for the damage these women have suffered.\"\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.
