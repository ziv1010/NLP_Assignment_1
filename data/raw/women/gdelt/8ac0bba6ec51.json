  "body_text": "—The ACC is returning to an 18-game conference schedule for men’s basketball next season. All teams will play 14 opponents once, two opponents twice, and one opponent not at all.\nWednesday afternoon Cardinal news and notes\nCards. Derby. Offseason.\n—USA Today has a post-spring ranking of all 136 FBS programs. Louisville sits at No. 16.\n—The ACC is hopeful that a new stable of coaches will spark a resurgence for the conference.\nOnly four ACC teams made the NCAA Tournament, and UNC’s inclusion in the First Four was plenty controversial. Only Duke won a round of 64 game, and though the Blue Devils advanced to the Final Four, they could not cover up the league’s overall issues that were apparent as early as November.\nThe league’s 2-14 record in an early December challenge series against the SEC stands out most, but that debacle was only the beginning. In total, the ACC went 22-59 in nonconference Quadrant 1 and Quadrant 2 games, a significantly worse winning percentage (.272) than the other power conferences and worse than even the WCC, Atlantic 10, American and Mountain West. Ultimately, half of the ACC’s 18 teams ended outside of the NET’s top 100, and only three were in the top 40. In contrast, the 18-team Big Ten had 17 teams in the NET top 100 and eight in the top 30.\nSo yes, the league desperately needs a jolt of competence. SMU, California and Stanford did not exactly bolster the league’s basketball prestige in their ACC debuts, but a refresh on the sidelines for several schools could be just the shot in the arm the league needs.\nLouisville’s terrific hire of Pat Kelsey showed what’s possible in the span of just one year: The Cardinals flipped from an 8-24 Kenny Payne catastrophe to 27 wins and an at-large bid with Kelsey in charge. Other recent ACC hires — Steve Forbes at Wake Forest, Red Autry at Syracuse, Damon Stoudamire at Georgia Tech, Micah Shrewsberry at Notre Dame — have not produced instant results, but four new ACC coaches this offseason will all hope to mimic Kelsey’s immediate success at Louisville.\n—On3’s latest way too early college basketball rankings have Louisville at No. 8.\n—ESPN’s Jeff Borzello has the Cards at No. 7.\n—Sovereignty is skipping the Preakness, a move which is the latest piece of evidence that the Triple Crown needs to change, writes C.L. Brown.\n—James Scott is headed to Ole Miss, and also benefitting from the new rule that gives players three extra inches when they sign with an SEC school.\n—Former Louisville women’s basketball assistant Samantha Williams tells some great U of L stories on this episode of the Southern Hang podcast.\n—Louisville Report takes a look back at U of L football’s recruiting class of 2020.\n—Future Cardinal Sananda Fru was voted Best Young Player in Germany’s top professional league earlier this week. He received over 60 percent of the vote for the award.\n—I am growing increasingly excited about this guy.\n—Ticket packages are now on sale for four volleyball matches that will be played at the KFC Yum Center this fall.\n—The Athletic ranks every roster in the NFL.\n—The Lexington Herald Leader has a fan vote about the move of the Louisville-Kentucky men’s basketball game to the beginning of the season. Neither side seems particularly thrilled about the change.\n—If Jeff Brohm gets a commitment from a quarterback who isn’t highly-rated in his class, just wait a few months for that to change.\n—This year’s Kentucky Derby was the most-watched since 1989.\n—There are now about 50 bars and restaurants that have opened in Louisville so far this year. The CJ has a look at what’s new.\n—The Athletic lists Louisville as one of the biggest transfer portal winners of the offseason thus far.\nLouisville\nPortal additions: Ryan Conwell, Isaac McKneely, Adrian Wooley\nThe Cards worked quickly this cycle to secure one of the top backcourts for Year 2 of Pat Kelsey’s fun-and-gun system. Conwell is a proven scorer who already had a lot of success in a similar offense while playing for Josh Schertz at Indiana State. McKneely was one of the best shooters available in the portal, and he should take over the role vacated by Reyne Smith. Then Kelsey has two high-upside pieces to replace Chucky Hepburn at point guard in Wooley and five-star freshman Mikel Brown Jr. Both are NBA prospects.\nLouisville had the luxury of focusing its efforts on the backcourt because the frontcourt should be stronger and deeper with the return of Aly Khalifa, who transferred in from BYU last year but redshirted because of a knee injury, and Kasean Pryor, who looked to be one of the Louisville’s best players until he tore his ACL at the Battle 4 Atlantis. James Scott was a last-minute portal entry, but the Cards added Sananda Fru, a 6-11, 21-year-old German power forward who started on a team in Germany’s top professional league. This is a deeper and more talented roster than the one that just went 18-2 in the ACC.\n—The 2024 volleyball Final Four at KFC Yum Center provided Louisville with an estimated economic impact of $12.7 million.\n—Matt Norlander goes back and grades the college basketball coaching hires of 2021.\n—The U.S. Open Cup round of 32 is tonight, and for just the second time ever Lou City will be hosting an MLS squad.
