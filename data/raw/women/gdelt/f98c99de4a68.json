It's too bad that some politicians oppose the plan, I believe because they are hungry for power and lack concern for the common good.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nPeter Ronne, Woodberry\nI know which of two council reviews I'd prefer\nI STRONGLY back Newcastle lord mayor Ross Kerridge's call for a thorough and independent review of Newcastle council, in stark contrast to the limited scope proposed by deputy mayor Callum Pull (\"'Not a witch hunt': council considers independent review after letter writing saga\", Newcastle Herald 6/12). The community has been clear in its demands for accountability and transparency, particularly concerning the unresolved Neylon/Sivo scandal. I believe Cr Pull's motion fails to address these critical issues, favouring a broader but, in my view, superficial review that risks bypassing the core concerns.\nTo me, Cr Pull's emphasis on a \"broad approach\" seems rushed and overly dependent on existing structures like the Audit, Risk and Improvement Committee (ARIC), which has historically fallen short of delivering the accountability Newcastle residents deserve. In contrast, Cr Kerridge's proposed amendments, including an autonomous panel and an independent community reporting mechanism, demonstrate a commitment to restoring public trust. His two-stage review balances a targeted, in-depth investigation with cost efficiency.\nNewcastle residents deserve a review that leaves no stone unturned. I believe Cr Kerridge's approach prioritises transparency and accountability, which are both crucial for rebuilding confidence in our council. Let's reject a token effort that may satisfy no one.\nLeigh Wardle, Tighes Hill\nClimate deniers need to step aside\nYOUR correspondent (\"Without power, it's back to past\", Letters 5/12) harks back to the days when coal was delivered to our homes in hessian sacks to be burnt in open fireplaces and pollute our homes, our lungs and the atmosphere. I remember those days, but I'm not sure \"most people back then were far happier than those of today\", as your correspondent asserts. To take 1950 as a point in time, many didn't have refrigerators, washing was indeed done by hand, many men (my father included) were denied an education and could find work only in heavy manual jobs. Fewer than 32,000 were enrolled in university Australia-wide (population 8.2 million). Owning a car was a luxury. Life expectancy was 66.5 years. Few women had meaningful jobs. I could go on.\nYour correspondent is correct: we need a reliable power supply. Ninety per cent of Australia's coal-fired power stations will be closed in the next 10 years. We have the natural resources to guarantee reliable power; solar, wind, water, and emerging sources such as hydrogen. Nuclear may be in the mix for future generations but that's way, way off, if it ever happens. Climate-change deniers, NIMBYs and the federal Coalition need to get out of the way so the government - and eager investors - can get on with building the infrastructure to exploit those natural resources.\nJohn Ure, Mount Hutton\nSubstance, not style, the problem\nI AGREE with Amanda Vanstone's opinion piece's opening line \"Are we so out of touch that what a politician looks like is more important than the policies they promote\" (\"When it's pile on over substance\", Opinion, 5/12). So let's examine the LNP's nuclear advocacy, as an actual policy has yet to be released. Vanstone says \"Dutton's decision to advocate for nuclear energy was a bold, sensible move\".\nFar from bold and sensible, Dutton's nuclear strategy has been thoroughly debunked in an opinion piece by Natalie Isaacs (\"Nation's women the long-term thinkers in nuclear debate\", Opinion, 6/12). Isaacs writes \"Any proposal to include nuclear in the mix is too costly, too slow and too risky\".\nIt would also detract from, and therefore slow, the current implementation of the far more sensible renewable energy rollout policy, as well as create investment uncertainty. The more you scratch the surface of Dutton's nuclear advocacy the more his stance looks the opposite of sensible.\nIan Thomas, The Hill\nProtests must win over the public\nCATHY Burgess (\"Fights are how we win new rights\", Letters, 6/12), you have compared successful public campaigns (including marches) to the recent Rising Tide protests and civil disobedience, including criminal activities. In particular, you have mentioned campaigns to get the women's vote, and also Vietnam.\nThat is an amazing comparison because these successful campaigns are worlds apart from Rising Tide's failure to meet its publicly stated key objective of stopping new coal and gas projects.\nJust like Rising Tide and its supporters, you don't appear to want to learn from the lessons of what makes a good campaign and what makes a failed campaign. For those who are more focused on what makes a successful campaign and what doesn't, the reason the women's vote and Vietnam were successful was because they gained massive popular public and political support. Civil disobedience was just part of the campaign and didn't make a difference to the successful outcome.\nUntil Rising Tide and its supporters change their campaign tactics and seek political and popular support, they will always fail. At the moment, with the involvement of the lord mayor, I imagine their political support particularly is going backwards.\nGlen Wilson, Cardiff\nWe don't want to go back\nI CAN'T agree more with Carl Stevenson (\"Without power, it's back to past\", Letters, 5/12): we don't want to go back in time to when they had to burn coal to provide heating. Obviously he supports moving onto new technology to warm the house, so let's stop burning coal and get behind sun and wind technology to power the future and avoid our world from overheating.\nRobert Masterson, Adamstown\nBravo to the sports team\nCONTRARY to David Gallacher's opinion (\"Exotic football result a surprise\", Letters, 6/12), I think the sports coverage in the Herald is one of the better I have read in an Australian newspaper, as well as internationally. The fact that it does not simply cover the favourite local game/s widens my knowledge and interests. Long may it last.\nTony Brown, Newcastle\nNo need to lay the boot in\nC'MON David Gallacher (\"Exotic football result a surprise\", Letters, 6/12), it's South America's equivalent of the European Champions League, therefore a huge trophy in global terms. As for the Scottish PL, it's either Celtic or Rangers competing and when they come up against the continental teams they usually don't fare well in the ECL.\nRocco De Grandis, Cameron Park\nCash still has the edge\nBRUCE Graham (\"Free cash alternatives exist\", Letters, 6/12), you speak of ifs; if the banks got behind it. Do you understand banks profit from these fees and are not willing to lose this money? OSKO is, at this stage, not set up for tap-and-go transactions. I'm not paying a fee to spend my own money.",
