What’s more, owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe gave a rather depressing interview in March stating that the club would have run out of cash by December if it were not for his investment.\nIt was thought by many that United would be suffering more obviously from PSR financial restrictions but much to the relief of fans all over the world, the club actually have the fifth healthiest PSR situation in the entire league.\nThe Athletic have gone into detail on how exactly this has come to pass.\nHow is PSR calculated?\nIn a nutshell, “the starting point for the Premier League’s PSR calculation is a club’s pre-tax profit or loss. Clubs are allowed to lose a maximum of £105million ($142m) over a three-year period, after deductions are applied for spending on women’s football, academy, community work and other beneficial causes.”\nThe problem United had is their “pre-tax loss at plc-level was a staggering £130.7m during the 2023-24 season alone, exacerbating concerns over a potential regulatory breach.”\nNonetheless, now it is just £36.2m, a difference of £94.5m.\nWhat has changed?\nEffectively, United seem to have been saved by a little known organization called Red Football Ltd. This is a company which was registered at the UK’s Companies House in February 2005 shortly before the Glazers’ takeover. It is a subsidiary of Manchester United plc, the club’s parent company which is the one listed on the New York Stock Exchange and publishes financial results.\nThe Red Football company is crucially listed in the United Kingdom and not the Cayman Islands like the PLC and this is helpful as according to Premier League’s rules, clubs can only “submit the accounts of a UK-registered company for testing against PSR.”\nHistorically there has been little difference between the accounts of the PLC and Red Football Ltd., but this has drastically changed over the last year.\nWhat has Red Football Ltd done?\n1) One of the biggest differences was the cost of “exceptional items”. According to the economic figures they were £47.8m but only accounted for £4.5m on the books of Red Football. This included £3.6m of money paid to senior management and staff who were let go by the club.\n2) “It was widely assumed that costs related to Ratcliffe’s share purchase had to be allowed for in United’s PSR calculation, as their inclusion would likely have led to non-compliance. But their absence from Red Football Ltd’s accounts suggests that they were never part of the equation.”\n3) Red Football Ltd has also benefited from an extra £10.5m in “centralised services recharged to other group undertakings” during 2023-24 — which basically means they have recharged staff time to elsewhere in the business.\nUnited are not the only team to have used another company as Chelsea have avoided PSR issues with the creation of Blueco 22 Limited and resultingly, they have been able to keep some charges off the books and out of PSR consideration.\nThe Result\nIn essence, the work of the Red Football Ltd. has given United significantly more headroom when it comes to PSR.\n“The Premier League’s 2024-25 PSR test will be based upon the financial years ending June 30 2023, 2024 and 2025. After two lots of full-year accounts up until June 2024, Red Football Ltd’s combined pre-tax losses stood at £55.1m — well below the £105m limit, even before applying any deductions.”\nIn fact, The Athletic estimates that United “could lose around £141m in 2024-25 alone and still remain PSR compliant.”\nThere are not many advantages to missing out on European football but one benefit is that the club do not need to comply with UEFA spending rules and can only focus on the Premier League, for at least this year.\nCaution still needed\nIt is clear that United are still not out of the woods and in spite of the increased wiggle room, they will need player sales to generate cash. Fortunately, unlike other years, they seem to have numerous desirable players such as Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Marcus Rashford that they hope will allow them to continue to spend more freely in the rest of the market.\nFeatured image Michael Steele via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
