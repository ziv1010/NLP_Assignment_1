Hopeless young people were waiting for it. We lack housing and jobs, and when we have (jobs), our wages are too low,' said Samba Seck, a 39-year-old transportation worker in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois.\nClichy was the birthplace of weeks of riots in 2005 that shook France, prompted by the deaths of two teenagers electrocuted in a power substation while fleeing from police.

So we wanted to express our condolences,' one man among the mourners, who declined to give his name said.\nSome of the mourners, their arms crossed, said 'God is Greatest' in Arabic, as they spanned the boulevard in prayer.\nSalsabil, a young woman of Arab descent, said she had come to express support for Nahel's family. 'It's important we all stand together,' she said.\nMarie, 60, said she had lived in Nanterre for 50 years and there had always been problems with the police.\n'This absolutely needs to stop.

But Nahel's mother, dressed in white, walked straight inside to applause, and headed toward the grave.\nThe crowd had grown for hours, first at the mosque where prayers were held, then at the cemetery.\nFrom time to time, the word 'martyr' could be heard.\nInside the cemetery gate, the white casket was lifted above the crowd and carried toward the grave.

'Let's see if the police will change their ways as the days pass.'\nIt has also been revealed what both French policemen who pulled over 17-year-old driver Nahel said as his passenger has broken his silence on the alleged execution that has sparked outrage and riots across France.\nThe passenger who was with Nahel in the car at the time of the shooting shared a video of his comments and said he has come forward to share his story because he wanted to 'establish the truth'.\nFirefighters extinguish fires set on trash cans under riot police's protection following looting and violent demonstrations last night\nA police officer has been handed a preliminary charge of voluntary homicide and placed in provisional detention following killing of Nahel on Tuesday\nThe passenger claimed the first officer put his gun to Nahel's head and told him: 'Don't move or I'll put a bullet in your head.'\nHe claims the second officer said: 'Shoot him', before the first then struck him with the butt of his gun again. This forced Nahel to release the break.\nThe second officer, the passenger claims, then fired, alerting Nahel to put his foot on the accelerator. At 17, Nahel was too young to have a driving licence.\nThe passenger released footage on social media saying 'there are a lot of lies on social media' and that he would tell 'the story from A to Z'.\nThe young man - who was in the car that had Polish number plates - said they borrowed the vehicle and went for a drive around Nanterre but 'weren't under the influence of any alcohol or drugs'.\nHe said they were in a bus lane when they noticed police on motorbikes following behind, eventually stopping them.\nHe said one officer came to the window and told Nahel: 'Cut the engine or I'll shoot you.'

'We hit a barrier.\n'I was afraid. I got out of the vehicle. And I ran away. I thought they might shoot me. So I ran.'\n'I'm shocked at what happened in front of me to my friend,' he concluded.\nDalhaimi, 53, who claims his cousins were friends with Nahel, told Le Parisien: 'It feels good for us Muslims to come together to share our pain. I hope Nahel will enter paradise.'\nNicole, a 50-year-old neighbour of Nahel's grandmother, told the newspaper she was sad and angry over Nahel's death, who she said spent a lot of time with his grandmother.\nBritain's Foreign Office also issued an alert to the two million Britons set to travel to France over the summer, with officials now imploring tourists to take out travel insurance as they claim it is more important than ever.\nIt comes after a police officer was handed a preliminary charge of voluntary homicide and placed in provisional detention following the killing.\nProsecutor Pascal Prache said his initial investigation led him to conclude 'the conditions for the legal use of the weapon were not met.'\nFrance's interior ministry said 1,311 people had been arrested Friday, compared with 875 the previous night, in violence which it said on Twitter was 'lower in intensity'.\nA tear gas is thrown as people protest against the death of 17-year-old Nahel, who was shot in the chest by police in Nanterre on Tuesday\nEmergency workers put out the flames on a vehicle set on fire during violent protests over night\nFirefighters extinguish a bus burned during clashes between protesters and riot police in Nanterre, near Paris\nA gunman opened up on police and a weapons shop was looted during the escalating riots.\nAn officer in Villeurbanne, near Lyon, described how 'gunfire started' as a patrol entered a council estate where tower blocks had been set alight in the early hours of Saturday.\n'We were forced to flee - it was a matter of life and death,' he said. 'Three officers suffered minor wounds, but it could have been far worse.\n'We were forced to shoot back with a tear gas grenade launcher, at the risk of tearing a rioter's head off,' said the policeman, who asked not to be identified by name.\nOfficers suffered wounds to the legs and groin, prompting a local police spokesman to say: 'We have crossed a red line. We've not seen this kind of thing before here, and it's of deep concern.'\nAfter the marauding gangs of rioters clashed with police again, Macron is now facing calls to impose a state of emergency.\nLooters ransacked some of France's major cities as local police declared they were now at 'war' with 'savage hordes of vermin' - with officers from two of the country's biggest policing unions now threatening to revolt.\nFrance's national football team - including international star Kylian Mbappe, an idol to many young people in the disadvantaged neighbourhoods where the anger is rooted - have pleaded for an end to the violence.\nSmoke rises after violent protests swept France again last night as emergency services scrambled to act amid the clashes\nEmergency personnel survey the scene of a burnt out building - which housed a pharmacy - in Montargis s this morning, which was set alight overnight during continuing protests\nRaid policemen arrest a man during clashes with police on the Lyon streets as violence continues to erupt in France\nLast night, firefighters were seen desperately hosing down a burnt bus as unrest continued in France\n'Many of us are from working-class neighbourhoods, we too share this feeling of pain and sadness' over the killing of 17-year-old Nahel, the players said in a statement.\n'Violence resolves nothing. There are other peaceful and constructive ways to express yourself.'\nThey said it is time for 'mourning, dialogue and reconstruction' instead.\nThis week's rioting is the worst France has seen in years and puts new pressure on Macron, who appealed to parents to keep children off the streets and blamed social media for fuelling violence.\nLast night saw continued riots were looters were seen rampaging through the streets of Marseille, Lille and Paris, amid claims some broke into a gun shop and stole hunting rifles while others ransacked a police station. Cars, buses and government buildings have been set alight and fireworks have been launched at police.\nThere were more than 3,800 fires on public roads last night, while more than 500 buildings were set alight.\nHundreds of police and firefighters have been injured, including 79 overnight, but authorities haven't released injury tallies for protesters.\nNanterre Mayor Patrick Jarry said that France needs to 'push for changes' in disadvantaged neighborhoods.\nDespite repeated government appeals for calm and stiffer policing, Friday saw brazen daylight violence, too. An Apple store was looted in the eastern city of Strasbourg, where police fired tear gas, and the windows of a fast-food outlet were smashed in a Paris-area shopping mall, where officers repelled people trying to break into a shuttered store, authorities said.\nIn the face of the escalating crisis that hundreds of arrests and massive police deployments have failed to quell, Macron held off on declaring a state of emergency, an option that was used in similar circumstances in 2005.\nInstead, his government ratcheted up its law enforcement response, with the mass deployment of police officers, including some who were called back from vacation.\nTwo restaurant employees seen putting out a fire set by demonstrators during the protests on Friday\nFirefighters were called to several sites to put out fires as France was lit up in the wake of more protests\nThere were more than 3,800 fires on public roads last night, while more than 500 buildings were set alight\nA protester walks by a burning car during clashes with police in Le Port, French Indian Ocean island of La Reunion, on June 30\nA firefighter puts out the flames on a torched car amid another night of protests in Paris, France\nFirefighters put out the flames on a vehicle set on fire during violent protests last night\nDarmanin ordered a nationwide nighttime shutdown Friday of all public buses and trams, which have been among rioters' targets. He also said he warned social networks not to allow themselves to be used as channels for calls to violence.\n'They were very cooperative,' Darmanin said, adding that French authorities were providing the platforms with information in hopes of cooperation identifying people inciting violence.\n'We will pursue every person who uses these social networks to commit violent acts,' he said.\nMacron, too, zeroed in on social media platforms that have relayed dramatic images of vandalism and cars and buildings being torched. Singling out Snapchat and TikTok, he said they were being used to organize unrest and served as conduits for copycat violence.\nThe police officer accused of killing Nahel was handed a preliminary charge of voluntary homicide. Preliminary charges mean investigating magistrates strongly suspect wrongdoing, but need to investigate more before sending a case to trial. Nanterre prosecutor Pascal Prache said that his initial investigation led him to conclude that the officer's use of his weapon wasn't legally justified.\nNahel's mother, Mounia, told France 5 television that she was angry at the officer, but not at the police in general. 'He saw a little Arab-looking kid, he wanted to take his life,' she said.\n'A police officer cannot take his gun and fire at our children, take our children's lives,' she said. The family has roots in Algeria.\nPolice officers wait in front of a looted shop as they patrol in Lyon streets during violent protests on Friday night\nOfficers inspect a looted shop after violent riots swept France again last night\nA person passes by a looted shop in a Lyon street during violent protests over night\nRace was a taboo topic for decades in France, which is officially committed to a doctrine of colorblind universalism. In the wake of Nahel's killing, French anti-racism activists renewed complaints about police behavior.\n'If you have the wrong skin colour, the police are much more dangerous to you,' said a young man, who declined to be named, adding that he was a friend of Nahel's.\nThirteen people who didn't comply with traffic stops were fatally shot by French police last year. This year, another three people, including Nahel, died under similar circumstances. The deaths have prompted demands for more accountability in France, which also saw racial justice protests after George Floyd's killing by police in Minnesota.\nThis week's protests echoed the three weeks of rioting in 2005 that followed the deaths of 15-year-old Bouna Traoré and 17-year-old Zyed Benna, who were electrocuted while hiding from police in a power substation in Clichy-sous-Bois.\nEric Ciotti, the head of the Republicans party said his country 'is on the edge of a precipice' and that 'we must wage a merciless war against violence and proclaim a state of emergency in all affected areas', the Telegraph reported, as he launched a political broadside against Macron.\nDomestic intelligence seen by French newspaper Le Monde has also warned the president that riots could become increasingly 'widespread' and continue for the 'coming nights'.\nFrench police have said that they are currently 'at war' with 'savage hordes of vermin', The Telegraph reported after violence continued throughout the evening.\nTwo of the country's biggest police unions have threatened a revolt unless Mr Macron restores order.\nFirefighters extinguish a bus burned during clashes between protesters and riot police in Nanterre\nFrance deployed 45,000 officers backed by light armoured vehicles to tackle a fourth straight night of violent protests on Friday night\nA firefighters walks by a vehicle set on fire during violent protests in Tours, France\nThey said: 'Today the police are in combat as we are at war.

Locations and timing of riots are unpredictable.\n'You should monitor the media, avoid areas where riots are taking place, check the latest advice with operators when travelling and follow the advice of the authorities.'\nWidespread looting has also taken place in Marseille, with France Bleu Provence reporting that four hunting rifles were stolen from an armory during the riots in Marseille.\nA woman is searched by riot police as people protest near Opera Garnier in Paris\nProtesters set a container on fire amid the unrest in France following the death of a teenager\nA group of police officers walk during a protest in Nanterre, outside Paris, France, Saturday, July 1\nAt least 1,311 people are thought to have been arrested by law enforcement officers since last night\nRioters rampaged through the streets of France for a fourth night.

It's not the republic's job to replace fathers and mothers.'\nDarmanin met representatives from Meta, Twitter, Snapchat and TikTok.\nSnapchat said it had zero tolerance for content that promoted violence. A friend of the victim's family, Mohamed Jakoubi, who watched Nahel grow up, said the rage was fuelled by a sense of injustice after incidents of police violence against minority ethnic communities, many from former French colonies.\n'We are fed up, we are French too. We are against violence, we are not scum,' he said.\nMr Macron said social media was fuelling copycat violence, and that platforms such as Snapchat and TikTok needed to remove 'the most sensitive content'.\nHe said: 'We sometimes have the feeling that some young people are living in the streets of the video games that have intoxicated them.'\nThe President also urged parents to keep teenagers at home, rather than let them out looking for trouble.\nFrench riot police stand guard during clashes in Lyon\nA protester moves a metal barrier during a demonstration in Caen\nTensions have spilled into other cities after tensions reached boiling point today\nFirefighters put out a burning car during protests in Lille\n'It is the parents' responsibility to keep them at home,' said Mr Macron.

In this context of extreme tension, we cannot remain silent and our civic conscience encourages us to call for appeasement, awareness and accountability.'\nIn Nanterre on the outskirts of the Paris protesters torched cars and buses, barricaded streets and hurled projectiles at police following an earlier peaceful vigil.\nThe interior ministry said 79 police posts were attacked overnight, as well as 119 public buildings including 34 town halls and 28 schools.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying",
