But who of them have the best chance of winning silverware?\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nWith the A-League Men's competition now two rounds in, it's time for the girls to commence their season, with Illawarra Stingrays star Sasha Grove to be part of the season opener with her new club Western United up against Wellington at Ironbark Fields on November 1.\nLast year's grand final winning goal was of course made straight out of the Illawarra when Shellharbour junior and Sydney FC star Indiana Dos Santos assisted Shea Connors for the match winner against Melbourne City, whilst Figtree junior Mackenzie Hawkesby was awarded player of the game.\nAll that is ancient history however, with every club given a clean slate heading into season 2024/25. Here are the Illawarra products that are set to light up Australian fields this campaign.\nMichelle Heyman - Canberra\nAfter a whirlwind 2023/24 season where she picked up the ALW golden boot and then Matildas Olympic selection as a result, former Illawarra Stingray Michelle Heyman will look to pick up from where she left off for Canberra United.\nHer experience leading the line is invaluable for Antoni Jagarinec's squad. Heyman is currently in the midst of Matildas duties in friendlies against Switzerland and Germany. The Barrack Heights resident played 25 minutes in a 1-1 draw with the Swiss, and will look to play some parts against Germany Tuesday morning (AEST).\nUnited will be hoping Heyman gets through the Germany game unscathed, meaning she can play some part in round one against Brisbane on Saturday.\nIndiana Dos Santos - Sydney FC\nIt's hard to believe that Shellharbour junior Indiana Dos Santos is still just 17, considering all the records and titles she has won with the Sky Blues.\nDos Santos has won back-to-back championships under Ante Juric, whilst also made national headlines by becoming Sydney FC's youngest ever player at 15 years and 146 days and then became the league's youngest goalscorer later in the season.\nShe spent her off-season with the Young Matildas in the U20 FIFA Women's World Cup in Columbia, and if she keeps her ALW performances on the same trajectory, there's no doubt she will be in line for a Matildas call up very soon.\nJynaya Dos Santos - Canberra\nIndiana's elder sister Jynaya has crossed the divide this ALW season, signing for Canberra to play alongside the likes of fellow Illawarra products Heyman, Alex McKenzie, and Sasha Grove.\nPotential sister versus sister match ups aside, this is a fresh start for Jynaya, who will be desperate for game time at United.\nShe also spent her off-season in Columbia at the U20 World Cup, and will hope that the experience will have her humming on the field against Australia's best.\nSasha Grove - Western United\nLike Jynaya Dos Santos, Stingrays talent Grove has moved on from her long time club, swapping the light green of Canberra for the green and black of Western United.\nAt just 19, Grove has already notched 47 ALW appearances to her name, as well as recent U20 World Cup experience with the Dos Santos sisters.\n\"Signing a two-year deal has me motivated to continue the legacy of high performance here and to continue to learn and develop alongside such hard-working and talented teammates,\" Grove said of her WU move back in June.\nSienna Saveska - Wanderers\nCringila teen Sienna Saveska has gone back to the future this season, signing with the club were she made her professional debut with, Western Sydney.\n2024 Stingrays player Saveska started at the Wanderers, before she was part of Sydney FC's championship winning squad last season. But in the search of more regular playing time, Saveska has returned to where it all began.\n\"I left to find game time, and I came back to get game time,\" Saveksa said.\n\"I think this year I have a great opportunity to make my mark and really take the opportunity that I have been given to help the team and better myself in the process.\"\nMackenzie Hawkesby - Sydney FC\nFigtree junior Mackenzie Haweksby will again line up for Sydney FC off the back of yet another championship winning season.\nAt just 24, Haweksby will look to guide the engine room of the Sydney FC midfield once again and guide the team to an eighth - yes eighth - consecutive grand final.\nAfter a brief stint in the English Women's Super League with Brighton in 2023, it's clear Hawkesby has the ability to take her game to the next level and she will be hoping to do this year.\nAlex McKenzie - Canberra\nStingrays defender Alex McKenzie will line up for her second season at Canberra after impressing in her debut ALW campaign.\nAfter featuring in 17 matches in 2023/24, it's clear that she certainly made an impression.\n\"Alex did very well in her first A-League season last year and I am delighted to be able to welcome her back to the club for the new campaign,\" United coach Jagarinec said.\n\"She is a strong and speedy defender who reads the game well, is confident in her distribution and carrying the ball from defence. She can also play further forward when required and, having had a season under her belt, will no doubt bring that experience to the fore in her game this year.\"\nCaley Tallon-Henniker - Sydney FC\nAfter joining Sydney FC as an injury replacement midway through last season, Figtree junior Caley Tallon-Henniker will line up for her first full campaign with the Sky Blues.\nHer highlights in 2023 included being selected in the Australian Schoolboys girls rugby league team, competing at the NSW All Schools Rugby Union Championships, and of course, getting picked up by Sydney FC.\nFast forward to now, Tallon-Henniker has an A-Leagues medal to her name, has played alongside Matildas World Cup hero Cortnee Vine, and will line up with her childhood hero Kyah Simon for the upcoming season.\nDanika Matos - Wanderers\nStingrays defender Danika Matos will enter her sixth season with her ALW club the Wanderers and will be hoping to again be one of the first names on the team sheet.\nMatos played every minute of every game last season at both wing back and also as a wide midfielder at times, recording one assist in the process. She was instrumental in WSW recording their highest points total in history, missing out on finals on goal difference.\nAfter spending the National Premier League Women's season with the Stingrays - and guiding them to a semi-final in the process - in 2024, Matos will be one of the Wanderers' key figures once again.\nMargaux Chauvet - Sydney FC\nFormer Stingray Chauvet showed off her versatility for Sydney FC last season.\nAt still only 21, she has plenty of her best football in front of her, and she will be hoping to be a constant figure in the Sydney FC starting XI this season.\nThe former Balgownie and Wollongong Olympic junior has made a strong impression in the squad after securing a two-year contract extension with the club.\nTaren King - Mariners\nLast put not least is Shellharbour's Taren King - sister of Sydney FC's men's player Joel - who will line up with the Central Coast Mariners.\nNow entering her eighth season, King arrived at the Mariners at the start of the 2023/24 season following stints with Canberra and Newcastle. The defender was awarded the Mariners captaincy in pre-season last year, before suffering an ACL injury in January.\nAfter fully recovering, she will be expecting to hit the ground running for the first game.\nRound one:\n- Western United v Wellington, Friday at Ironbark Fields, 7pm\n- Mariners v Sydney FC, Saturday at Industree Group Stadium, 2:15pm\n- Canberra v Brisbane, Saturday at McKellar Park, 4pm\n- Adelaide v Victory, Saturday at ServiceFM Stadium, 5pm\n- City v Perth, Sunday at Ctrl:cyber Pitch, 3pm\n- Newcastle v Wanderers, Sunday at Cessnock Sportsground, 4pm.",
