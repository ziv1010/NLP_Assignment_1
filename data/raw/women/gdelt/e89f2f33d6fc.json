The OneLove armband was worn by captains during the women’s European Championships in 2022.\nThis “Unite for Inclusion” option chosen is heart-shaped and multicolored but not quite the rainbow the Germany team wanted to use at the tournament, where a number of gay players will be among more than 700 selected on team rosters.\nFIFA said this multicolored option was influenced by the Pan-African flag and pansexual flag.\nThe armbands were developed over months of talks with national federations as FIFA aimed to avoid repeating the chaotic standoff with European players and officials last year that spilled into the first two days of games in Qatar.\nFIFA said Friday the inclusion option was worked on with the United Nations human rights office in Geneva.\nThe eight armband designs chosen correspond to the eight rounds of matches at the tournament. Each will promote awareness of a cause under the theme of “Football Unites the World.”\nThe captains will be given three options for which armband they wear.\nThey can either wear the Football Unites the World armband throughout, an armband corresponding to one of the eight causes, or they can wear the armband allocated for each round.\nThe eight themes chosen by FIFA and the 32 nations are:\nUnite for Inclusion — in partnership with UN Human Rights\nUnite for Indigenous Peoples — in partnership with UN Human Rights.\nUnite for Gender Equality — in partnership with UN Women. Unite for Peace — in partnership with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.",
