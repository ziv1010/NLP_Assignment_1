They've got the nation's hearts, and we love them, and we're so proud of them.\"\nAnother waiting fan, adorned in an England scarf, said: \"Maybe they're sad. It's one of them isn't it - You can't blame them.\"\nThe team lost 1-0 at a packed-out Stadium Australia in Sydney in the World Cup final on Sunday, failing to repeat their success at Euros 2022.\nIt was Spain's first major international trophy - and England's first competitive defeat under manager Sarina Wiegman in two years.\nWhat's next for the team?\nThe squad will regroup next month for its first tilt at the newly-formed UEFA Women's Nations League - with their first match against Scotland taking place at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland on 22 September.\nThe final of the league will determine which European nations qualify for the women's football tournament at the 2024 Paris Olympics, with both the winners and runners-up qualifying for the Games.\nThe Nations League and the return of the Women's Premier League the following month will provide an early chance to see if there is a World Cup bounce in public interest in the women's game.\nInterest in the Lionesses has not wavered despite their loss in the final.\nThousands have rallied to sign a petition calling on Nike to make a replica of Mary Earps' shirt.\nThe England goalkeeper was voted the best keeper at the tournament and saved a penalty in the final, and Google Trends found online searches for her shirt rose 257% in a week.\nMore than 73,000 people have signed a petition after the manufacturer failed to include her kit in its selection of replica shirts printed with the names of the outfield players.\nNike has said it will re-think its approach in the future.\nRead more:\nFA chief apologises after kissing player on lips\nAnalysis: Lionesses can turn sorrow into springboard for success\nThe prime minister and the Prince of Wales, who is president of the Football Association, were both criticised for not flying to Australia to see the squad play in the final.\nA minister said Rishi Sunak \"would have loved to have been there\" but was too busy to go.\nEducation Minister Claire Coutinho told Sky News there was sufficient high-level representation at the match, as both the foreign secretary and sport secretary were in the stands.\n\"I know that the prime minister would have loved to have been there but he's also got a huge amount of work to do,\" Ms Coutinho said.\nShe denied that Mr Sunak would have gone if it had been the men's team, saying \"his schedule is so busy\".\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\nThe prime minister said he watched the game at his local pub in Northallerton and praised the Lionesses for leaving \"an incredible set of memories\" and inspiring \"a whole generation of youngsters\".",
