His final moments must have been terrifying.\nIt was a sheltered housing complex with some people being disturbed by what was going on.\nLife sentence\nThe judge His Honour Rhys Rowlands says it must be a life sentence but he has to set the minimum term.\nHe said: \"This was the tragic and wholly unnecessary loss of a young man's life, which has affected a great many individuals, and also the loss of your own future.'\nTraumatised\nSteven's gtandmother Jeanette Wilkinson and mother Lisa Wilkinson read statements bravely, says the judge.\nHis mother had to deal with the trauma of losing her son but also of being close by when he was being treated.\nThe effects have been devastating. Both women have been traumatised and no-one can fail to be moved by their plight.\nNothing he says or any sentence will adequately reflect their loss or indeed the loss of Steven's life, says the judge.\n'Serious harm'\nThe judge tells Mitchell he saw Steven Wilkinson and Jordan Spencer and chased them intending to cause really serious harm. 'You were quite determined to do so.'\nHe left Mr Wilkinson gravely injured.\n'Vicious temper'\nAfter the rock was thrown through the window of his mother's house Mitchell wanted revenge and was in a vicious temper.\nBut Steven Wilkinson was not responsible, says the judge.\nMr Wilkinson was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nThere was 'absolutely no reason or justification' to go out and take a knife, says the judge.\nSamurai sword\nThe judge His Honour Rhys Rowlands tells Mitchell that Mr Wilkinson was afraid of Mitchell, and Mitchell had a grudge against him.\nHe had the 16cm to 17 cm long kitchen knife not for self-harm, as he claimed, but to take out onto the streets.\nIt would have been useful in his drug dealing. He also had a butterfly knife and a Samurai sword at home.\nMum's statement\nJames Coutts, junior prosecuting barrister, reads out Steve's mum Lisa Wilkinson's statement.\nHe says she said there is a gaping hole in her heart.\nHer heart aches continuously for Steven. She regrets how he will not get married and become a father and grandfather. Any children and grandchildren would have been lucky to have him due to his caring and loving nature.\nTried to take her own life\nJunior prosecuting barrister James Coutts takes over reading her statement.\nHe says she said that night paramedics spent 45 minutes trying to save her son. She was nearby begging and pleading for them to save him.\nShe took to drink and has only just got her drinking under control.\nShe only wanted one thing but unfortunately no-one can help her with that.\nShe dreads going to sleep. Most nights she gets two hours sleep but is an emotional mess.\nShe can't stop crying. She has depression and anxiety. Her doctor has prescribed sleeping tablets but they don't help.\nIn March she took an overdose of prescribed medication to end her life.\nThe attempt was unsuccessful and she woke up in her bedroom.\nShe has been in touch with a community mental health team.\nShe has been signed off work for six months and is struggling to pay for food and accommodation.\nShe works as a carer for the elderly and had applied successfully for a new job. Steve was so happy and was so proud of her.\nEmotional mum breaks down\nSteven's mum Lisa WIlkinson said on Octover 4 she witnessed the gruesome, painful death of her son in front of her with her own eyes.\nShe stops, saying \"I can't do it - sorry.\"\nShattered\nGrandmother Jeanette Wilkinson is reading a victim statement\nShe says her life has been destroyed. She will never get over losing Steven in such a violent way. Her heart has been shattered into a million pieces.\nShe thinks about how it would be if he had got married and had children.\nThe pain is excruciating. She misses him so very much. No grandmother should have to bury her grandchild but she had to do that.\nShe was happy go lucky but is sad and broken. The person she want to speak to is no longer here.\nShe prays for justice every night. She desperately wants to know why he died.\nStarting shortly\nThe judge at this sentencing hearing in Mold Crown Court will be His Honour Rhys Rowlands.\nDefendant in dock\nJamie Mitchell, 25, has been brought into the glass-fronted dock.\nHe's wearing a navy, round-necked jumper and trousers.\nHe sits down, blows out his cheeks and takes a sip of water from a white plastic cup.\nPrayed for him\nReturning to the trial now, the jury heard that Jess Wilkinson said her nan got a call. and the family followed the ambulance carrying Steve to Wrexham Maelor Hospital.\nThey were praying for him as a family. But he died that evening.\nPolice arrested Mitchell at his mother's home - initially on suspicion of attempted murder - by police officers already there to investigate the criminal damage reported by his mother.\nEarlier he had stormed past officers, hiding the knife in his waistband, and told them he was going to the nearby Bargain Booze.\nThere is no suggestion that Steve Wilkinson knew anything about the criminal damage caused by the rock going through Mitchell's mother's window.\nSentencing delayed\nThe sentencing of Jamie Mitchell has been delayed. We're expecting it to start in the next half an hour or so.\nIn the meantime, we are recapping some of the evidence from last month's trial. Jamie Mitchell, 25, of Lexham Green Close, Buckley, was found guilty of murdering Steve Wilkinson, 23, by a jury at Mold Crown Court on April 27.\nHis sentencing was adjourned until today. We are expecting to hear several victim impact statements.\n'Like he'd seen a ghost'\nJess Wilkinson told how about ten minutes later Jamie Mitchell returned to his mother's house, where Jess was in an upstairs bedroom.\nHe was shaking and looked like he had seen a ghost, the jury heard.\nHe told her he had hurt her brother \"really bad\".\nShe went outside and ran through the streets, shouting for Steve to 'make a noise' and that she'd 'carry him home'.\nShe called on the rest of her family for help. Her mum and partner found the injured Mr Wilkinson. They told the rest of the family he had 'gone'.\nUnsurvivable injury\nParamedics arrived and treated Mr Wilkinson before taking him to Wrexham Maelor Hospital.\nBut despite the best efforts of doctors he was sadly pronounced dead there at 11.43pm that night.\nA pathologist said his injury had been unsurvivable.\nTrapped in alleyway\nMr Wilkinson ran into an alleyway but became trapped by a locked door.\nMitchell also went into the alleyway and claimed he and Mr Wilkinson simply 'collided'.\nBut the jury heard Mr Wilkinson sustained a six to seven inch deep chest wound below his left armpit.\nThe casualty emerged bleeding as Mitchell walked away with the knife in his hand. Mr Wilkinson wrapped clothing around his wound and his friend who had found him called for help.\nHooded Mitchell\nThe jurors heard Mitchell found Mr Wilkinson, 23, who saw the hooded Mitchell run towards him and his friends and pull a knife from his waistband.\nThe friends split up and Mr Wilkinson went over a grass bank by Aldi on Jubilee Road with Mitchell following him.\nA friend of Mr Wilkinson came along behind.\nBroken window\nThey heard a window being broken by a rock downstairs. Mitchell, who kept a knife which he claimed was only for 'self-harming', picked it up and went outside to look for those he thought were responsible while Jess hid in the bedroom.\nRekindled relationship\nDuring the two-week trial last month, the jury heard how Mitchell, 25, had rekindled a relationship with the victim's sister Jessica on October 4 and they had spent the whole day together, including at his mother's home in Lexham Green Close, Buckley.\nSentencing delayed\nI'm here are Mold Crown Court for the sentencing of Jamie Mitchell for the murder of Steve Wilkinson.\nThe hearing will not start until about 10.45am, we've been told.\nDay concludes\nThe jury have been dismissed for the day. The judge said that the barristers will make their final addresses to them tomorrow morning with their speeches.\nFinal questions and 999 call revisited\nThe defence had some shorter questions of clarification about Mitchell's movements when he went to his sister's house before he was arrested. The judge has a few questions to clarify the note he is taking of the proceedings ahead of his case summarising - which will happen tomorrow.\nJudge Rowlands points out that earlier evidence showed that the knife was stuck several inches in Mr Wilkinson - and obviously had to come out again. Mitchell tells the judge he \"didn't know\" when the blade removal happened.\nThe jury are told they will listen to the 999 call made by Mitchell's mum in relation to the criminal damage report. Technical issues earlier in the trial meant that the clip wasn't played with audio but instead the captions were allowed to play.\nDefendant 'feared the worst'\nMitchell is shown a photo included in the jury bundle of evidence that includes a picture of the kitchen sink in his home. He offered no explanation how the knife that he claimed throwing into the sink was seen underneath a saucepan, cup and plates.\nThe defendant said Miss Wilkinson is lying about hearing his mother saying, to the defendant: \"what have you done, who have you done it to?\" when he returned home. He claimed that he went to check on his mum but nothing was said between them.\nHe goes on to say that he \"didn't have a chance\" to tell Miss Wilkinson before his mum kicked her out that the stabbing was accidental. He told the court that he \"feared the worst\" when seeing the blood which is why he'd told her he had hurt Steven \"bad\".\nMitchell claimed that Miss Wilkinson asked no questions about her brother's welfare upon learning of the knifing. Mr Jones KC said that its the truth Mitchell refused the tell her where Steven was because he \"knew full well what he'd done\".\nThe defendant denies that he went no comment during his police interviews because he hadn't come up with a good enough excuse for the stabbing. He rejects that he intended to cause Mr Wilkinson's death - or at the least very serious harm.\nInjury could not have been accidental\nMitchell claimed not to realise any injury could have occurred until walking away and seeing that there was blood on his blade.\nHe said he felt scared and \"in shock\" - but the court heard earlier from one of the men that came to Steven's aid that the defendant appeared \"calm\". The defendant again stressed that the stabbing was an accident. Mitchell said he \"does not agree\" with the account of Jordan Spencer that the defendant \"got\" Steven.\nThe prosecutor now brings one of the statements, signed by Mitchell, outlining his defence. The document makes no reference to Mitchell's account of events where the victim shuffled past him to escape. Mitchell said he does not also agree with the finding of a Home Office pathologist that Steven's injures could not have been caused by accident.\nCCTV replayed\nMr Jones KC now gives warning that he is about to play earlier seen footage from a camera above the alley in Jubilee Court. The defendant and Steven Wilkinson are highlighted in the very brief footage which lasts seconds.\nMore tears can be heard from family members in the public gallery as Mitchell tells the court that he \"didn't realise\" Steven Wilkinson was moaning in pain before the now 25-year-old can be seen darting out of the alley alone.\nWhy carry on chasing them?\nMitchell claimed to have shouted at the men to leave him alone much earlier - before the chase even began, Mr Jones KC is told. The defendant denies that he had carried out his intention to scare these men away without knowing who they were. He accepted that he followed after the fleeing men as he wanted to find out who it was\nNow heading into the courtyard, Mitchell claims to still not have realised that the person he was chasing was Steven. He claims to have kept the knife drawn out, even after realising who his victim was, because he was scared.\nThe prosecution tried to identify a reason how Mitchell - who had the knife in his right hand at his side - managed to accidentally stab Mr Wilkinson around the armpit area as he tried to leave the alley. He claims not to know that Mr Wilkinson had no idea that the victim had been injured in the alley.\nAre you lying?\nThe prosecutor shows the defendant and jury a section in the bundles that include CCTV stills of Mitchell after he left the property on Lexham Green Close - hooded and with the knife.\nHe affirms that he felt scared in these pictures and was \"just walking around the block\". Mr Jones KC dismissed this and suggested that he was out looking for the people to blame and had his hood up so not to be recognised. Mitchell denies that he ran with the knife out before the unidentified people - known now to be Steven and Jordan.\n\"Which version is the truth?\" posed Mr Jones KC. He said that the defendant must have known it was Steven - who owed him money and is then believed by the defendant to have smashed his window. He accepts the prosecution's remark that it is all an \"unfortunate coincidence\" that the person he chased and stabbed was Steven.\n\"You were chasing a man you didn't know with a kitchen knife because you were scared? This is all lies, isn't it?\", the prosecutor added. Mitchell denies that he lied.",
