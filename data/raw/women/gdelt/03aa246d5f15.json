  "body_text": "Marc Skinner: Man Utd haven't had enough credit this season\nManchester United manager Marc Skinner is adamant that his players deserve more credit for what they have achieved this season, suggesting that there is often a 'caveat' attached that focuses on the failure of competitors rather than their own significant improvement.\nHeading into the final weekend of the WSL season, United are the only team that can stop Chelsea from claiming a fourth consecutive title. It would be a tall order that relies on bottom club Reading beating Chelsea, but even so Skinner's team will record their highest ever league finish.\nUnited cannot finish lower than second place following last weekend's results, meaning they have got into the Champions League for the first time and will bypass the first qualifying round.\nA final points tally of 56 is also within reach, which would be the joint second highest in WSL history. To be sure of the title, Chelsea will have to set a new league record of 58.\n\"We've been exceptional this year and I don’t think we get enough credit,\" Skinner said.\n\"We're still in contention to win [the title], but if we don't, we finish second. To do that and disrupt the historical top three, regardless of what has happened elsewhere. I want people to give this team and the players the credit they deserve.\"\nSkinner speculated that a lack of players in punditry roles with a United background, most likely owing to the team's young history, is a big reason for that. Siobhan Chamberlain is a rare exception.\nRead the latest Man Utd Women news here\n\"Not a lot of pundits are Manchester United,\" he explained.\n\"I think there are a lot of ex-Arsenal, Chelsea, Man City.\n\"When you're listening to comments and punditry, there's always a caveat as to why we've been successful – other teams' injuries, other teams' maybe having Champions League and I get that. But I just feel the players have been exceptional.\n\"It's not about where we finish in the league right now. If you look statistically at what we've done this year, what the players have done and the way we do it, even in TV audiences – I think we're the most watched team.\n\"This team, in a pressure cauldron, have performed well and won games of football. Results-wise [in the WSL], we've lost twice to Chelsea, drew with Everton, drew with Manchester City and yet to play Liverpool [a second time]. We've beaten every other team. That is a crazy excellent season.\"\nFor more from Jamie Spencer, follow him on Twitter!",
