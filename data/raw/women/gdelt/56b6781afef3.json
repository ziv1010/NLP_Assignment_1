  "body_text": "We caught up with Renée Slegers at Emirates Stadium shortly after she signed a contract extension to find out what it means to her.\nPress play on the video above to watch the interview in full, or read through the transcript below:\nRenée, congratulations. What does it mean for you to be extending your stay as the Arsenal Women coach?\nRS: Thank you very much. There are so many things to this for me. Of course, I'm very proud to represent Arsenal in any role. I think it means something because we will be able to build something. I strongly believe in the club and what the club has been doing for a long time before me and where we are now, where the team is at and all the possibilities that we have from a facilities and resources perspective. We have everything. We have the fans. I really look forward to it.It means so much to me and I really look forward to more.\nIt's almost a year to the day since you officially became our head coach. Quite a lot has happened since then, but how do you reflect on that period as a whole?\nRS: I think I want to reflect upon my whole time at Arsenal because, like I just said, I've been representing Arsenal for a longer time in different roles and I'm very proud of that. I think the bigger picture of what the club has been building for a long time and the small part that I have been a part of so far, it's been great to be a part of because I think I share so many values with the club and that's important to me that there is perspective of everything we do.\nI try to zoom in and zoom out because it's the football. We work with football and we want to perform the best possible football that we have within us, maximising our potential, but then also understanding that we're a part of something bigger and that we represent something that people feel attached to. That's also very important to me, that we understand that we are working on something bigger, and I think that's why I always like to see what's been before us, what I can impact now and try to build and create. I'm very curious about the future as well, but let's not think too far ahead.\nIf we look back at specific moments, obviously there's a big one that comes to mind that day in Lisbon. Has it sunk in properly, and what do you think happened that meant it went our way that day?\nRS: I think it comes in pieces, the sinking in of what we did. Of course, we felt there was euphoria on the pitch in those first couple of days, so then you feel the intense emotion. There's been moments, of course you work in the here and now and look to the future, but there's moments when you remember and try to take a moment to understand what we did together and that's very special.\nI know what it means to the club and to the fans. I think our whole Champions League journey last season has been very impressive. What the team has shown, the quality of football that we can play, the way we can win games and also the character that we've shown as a team, the mentality. We're very, very proud of that as a group.\nAlso, the resilience in setbacks and then coming back. I think the final was just the ultimate performance with everything that includes the preparation, the execution on matchday from all parties involved. It's such an impressive performance. We had to be really good on the day and we were really, really good on the day. We're very proud of our Champions League journey.\nWhat do you think makes this squad and this coaching staff such a special group that's capable of beating any team on their day?\nRS: The quality that we possess in the team, the different individual strengths and when that comes together, we are such a good team. I think there's a humility in the team of wanting to work really hard. Together with the staff, the backroom staff, I think what I've experienced, which I haven't experienced before in my career, my life, in working together with other people, is the way we reflect and are humble about the work we do. I think the staff, there's so much work ethic, so much willingness to learn, to become better.\nWe work with really high trust levels and there's a lot of autonomy for different people in the staff and there's so much strength. So, we want to play to each other's strengths in the staff as well, but definitely, the way we reflect. We have a very reflective culture and that makes us stronger. So, I'm really proud of the culture that we've created in the staff.\nOf course, our ambition doesn't stop when you win one Champions League. So, what is your focus going forward?\nRS: Yes, we are really proud of the Champions League win and that shows what we can do. The goal is of course to be able to achieve the Arsenal way and do that consistently and that way needs to lead to trophies because we are Arsenal and that's what we work really, really hard on in the background. And of course, that's the outcome and for us, it's on a daily basis, focusing on the processes and the work we need to do every single day to be able to make something lead to those outcomes. So, we'll work really, really hard but we know what we want to achieve and I think it's possible at Arsenal.\nYou talk a lot about the collective and togetherness and our supporters are such a big part of your journey at the club. They bring so much energy, home and away, but do you have a favourite moment at each game before the football starts?\nRS: Yes, so I've been a supporter as well when I was young and I've been there watching the Arsenal Women's team and I was there at the Champions League final in 2007, so I know what it's like to be standing there and watching great football and feeling attached to something and something you can associate with. Because that's what I felt and that's a lovely feeling and that's what I want to give back now as well.\nOne of my favourite moments is definitely when the players come out for the warm-up. I try to be out for that moment. It's not always possible. I try to be out for that moment. See when the players come out in their red colours and straightaway, the fans start to sing their songs and there's a connection, so that's always goosebumps for me. Depending on where we play, it's the North London Forever. That's always straight to the heart but also when we play at Emirates, the ‘Right Here, Right Now’, when that's pumping through the stadium because that associates with me. Because we want to be in the here and now, and right here, right now, it needs to happen and everyone's excited. So that moment is really special as well.\nYou spoke about you watching the Champions League winners of 2007 and your Arsenal journey started all the way back when you were 17 years old. You're being coached by Kelly Smith and now you coach alongside her. If you look back at that and where you are now, what does that mean to you? What does that process mean to you?\nRS: I never would be thinking about that. I would be here in my life. I was so impressed by Arsenal and football in England and so many things. I was grateful of getting the opportunity to be at Oakland College to get those coaching sessions from those top coaches. Kelly and then getting to train with the first team and getting to know Vic Akers. Seeing what football is about and what it means to people and what it means to people in England.\nI never thought at that moment in time that I would ever be here. but that's also the beautiful part and the beautiful side of life, that it can take you anywhere. That's definitely something that I want to spread. You don't know where it takes you but believe in things and dream about things. I definitely felt inspired and I want to keep on inspiring with our football and what we do at Arsenal.\nHow would you like to help the club continue to grow and champion the women's game on and off the pitch?\nRS: There are so many things that are growing really fast at the moment in women's football which is great. I think the football itself is almost getting better every day. You see it with the demands on the players and just in the last couple of years, I see how the training environment is at such a high level.\nThe quality of players, what they bring to the game, the young players coming through, both from Arsenal or new recruits. It's growing so fast, the football. It's on a really high level and that's really good. I think everything around it needs to grow ideally at the same pace, so I think we need to pace all aspects of it.\nThat's really positive but what I think is important is that we stay to the essence of sport. I think sport has given us so much in society historically and it needs to be a positive thing in our society and hopefully, we can have our little contribution with our team in Arsenal as well.\nYour first year as head coach brought us a lot of things including a Champions League but how excited are you for the future and what that brings for the club?\nRS: Yeah, very excited. I see that there is so much potential. I think Arsenal has been pioneering for so long to get things into place and I think we have everything we want and need. We will keep on pushing, of course, because the game keeps on growing.\nI'm really excited because I see the potential, I see the quality of the squad, I see the staff. It's on a really high level, so I think if we get things right and of course, that's what drives me every single day. That's what I wake up with and what I go to bed with. I want to make things better and as good as possible and maximise ourselves. I think the future is bright for Arsenal and I will try to play my role as well.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
