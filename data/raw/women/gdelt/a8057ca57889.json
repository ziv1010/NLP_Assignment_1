What's happened? Why are you here?\"\n'It was just: \"There's your room\", and that was it.'\nA concerned William nods as Fara explains that she wouldn't have been homeless for long if someone had helped her during her initial stay at the shelter.\nEx-English footballer Fara Williams opens up to Prince William about her past homelessness\nThe second episode, which will air tonight on ITVX, features a candid conversation between the father-of-three and former professional footballer and Homewards advocate Fara Williams\n'That's totally what Homewards is about,' William replies. 'It's trying to prevent as early as possible rather than just manage the crises as its happening.\n'It is crucial that we get to those at-risk people like your younger self before they enter the homelessness chain because that's where all the damage gets done.'\nFara, was born in Battersea, London, in 1984 and joined Chelsea Ladies at the age of 12.\nDespite leaving home at 17 after a family dispute and staying at hostels for seven years, Fara went on to carve out a successful football career for herself - making her senior England debut in 2001 and earning 172 caps.\nShe previously told the Big Issue that football was all that motivated her.\n'If I didn’t have football, I wouldn’t have got through that period,' she told the publication.\n'Living in a hostel, you see the choices some people made because they had nothing and didn’t have that focus or motivation. Football saved me.'\nEx-Lioness Fara Williams walks with Sir Keir Starmer in March. The footballer made her senior England debut in 2001 and earned 172 caps\nIn his new documentary, Prince William : We Can End Homelessness, the royal, 42, reveals a behind-the-scenes look at the first year of Prince William and The Royal Foundation's Homewards programme\nIn a clip, Prince William is seen laughing with Homewards Advocate Fara Williams\nIn her sit-down conversation with the Prince about Homewards, Fara said: 'I really want to get myself stuck into and try to get them to understand that those first weeks are so important and if you get in then I feel like we'll see less young adults homeless for sure.'\n'Good,' says the Prince who is wearing a navy suit paired with a baby blue shirt with the top buttons undone. 'We want to unleash your energy, I can feel it already.'\nThe pair laugh before Prince William says in a sincere tone: 'It needs it. It needs the hope, it needs the optimism. It needs all that to show people it can be done.'\nPrince William has long been a supporter of women's football and the Lionesses - having sent the team a good luck message ahead of the Euro 2022 Finals with Princess Charlotte beaming by his side - and presenting them with their trophy following their victory.\nHis documentary aired its first episode on Wednesday evening on ITVX, sharing a glance at the work the future king has been doing as part of his ambitious campaign to end homelessness in the UK - which was launched last year.\nDuring the first episode, the royal was seen helping out at a Christmas dinner at The Passage, a homeless charity in London - where he was once taken by Princess Diana as a child and where he volunteered last year.\nThis is the hilarious moment Prince William was asked if he was 'trying to escape' doing chores while volunteering at a homeless charity\nWilliam attempted to dodge kitchen work by saying he was 'going for a natter' with visitors\nHis down-to-earth relationship with those at the charity was made clear, as the prince cheekily attempted to dodge hard work in the kitchen by 'going for a natter' with visitors instead after sneaking a glimpse at his watch.\n'You've got enough hands in here anyway, don't you?' he asked. 'I might go over there and have a natter'.\nBut William, who had donned an apron for the occasion, was clearly not to be granted any sort of royal treatment and his excuses were seen right through.\nHe was jokingly told: 'Oh you're trying to escape the work, I'm watching you!'\nThe Prince of Wales then sent his fellow volunteers into fits of laughter, saying he would hand out the drinks or the ketchup.\nThe first of William's two-part series emphasised the heir's commitment to resolving homelessness in Britain, with concluding second episode airing on Thursday.\nThe two-part series will also be available on Disney+ from Friday 1 November.\nDuring the film - which includes real life stories from those who are experiencing homelessness or have previously been homeless - viewers also see inside some treasured memories from the prince's own life.\nWilliam, who had donned an apron for the occasion, was clearly not to be granted any sort of royal treatment\nThe Prince of Wales then sent his fellow volunteers into fits of laughter, saying he would hands out the drinks or the ketchup\nWilliam first visited The Passage in 1993 with his late mother, Diana, and younger brother Harry, when he was just 11-years-old, which is the same age as his eldest son, George. He is now the patron of the charity, for an issue very close to his heart.\nThe future king has set his sights on making rough sleeping, sofa surfing and temporary accommodation a thing of the past in his ambitious five-year initiative programme called Homewards, founded by the prince and the Royal Foundation.\nCameras started rolling in June last year when the Prince launched his project Homewards, which focuses on ending homelessness in six UK areas: Aberdeen; Bournemouth, Christchurch & Poole; Lambeth; Newport; Northern Ireland and Sheffield.\nThis streaming decision is a notable departure from that of the Prince of Wales' brother Prince Harry, who signed a five-year, £80million deal with Netflix in 2020.\nSince launching his ambitious initiative to end homelessness in the UK - the prince has taken part in numerous charity engagements, including last year when he visited The Passage homeless charity.\nPrince William and Diana, Princess of Wales, during a visit to The Passage in London\nThe documentary reunites the brothers on screen, if only via an old photo of both boys visiting the shelter in 1993\nJust last year, the prince made a surprise appearance at the Christmas party of The Passage, in London, a charity which the prince holds particularly close to his heart.\nThe royal first visited The Passage with his late mother Princess Diana in the 1990s, to take part in the charity's Christmas meal.\nHe recalled feeling 'anxious' during the visit but was put at ease by his mother's own kindness.\nHe said: 'My mother went about her usual, making everyone feel relaxed, having a laugh and joking with everyone. I remember at the time kind of thinking, 'Well, if everyone doesn't have a home, they're all going to be really sad.' But it was incredible how happy an environment it was.'\nThe prince has credited his mother for inspiring him to launch his initiative to eradicate homelessness.\nIn a heartwarming video posted on Twitter last Christmas, William was seen dressed in a festive green jumper and an apron - as he got stuck in preparing food in the kitchen.\nIn the clip, the royal was seen chatting and having a laugh with staff as he got busy peeling sprouts in the kitchen.\nAfter the cooking was completed, William even stuck around to serve the turkey and delicious trimming to people arriving at The Passage - of which he was a patron, before joining them while they eat.\nThe visit came alongside the prince's pledge, which was made last year, in which he promised to ramp up his work towards homelessness across the UK.\nPrince William, 41, visited homelessness charity The Passage, based in London, to join staff and people who use the charity's services for Christmas dinner\nAround the same time, Kensington Palace released a video of of his wife, Kate, 42, and children George, 11, Charlotte, nine, and Louis, six, joining another charity ahead of Christmas, as they helped out at a baby bank in Windsor.\nLast year, the Prince of Wales announced a £3 million fund to tackle homelessness in the UK - with the ambitious plan to bring it to an 'end' within five years.\nThrough his Royal Foundation's charitable arm, he is funding six projects in flagship locations around the country.\nDuring his visit last year, the Prince of Wales donned an apron and chatted to kitchen staff as he helped them prepare\nThe Prince of Wales posed for photos with guests at The Passage - including one who was wearing a very festive jumper\nThe royal shared a joke with one of the guests at the Christmas party while he dug into a pudding\nPrince William greeted guests at the lunch with warmth as he spent the day with them\nFather-of-three William appeared deep in conversation with one of the guests at the Christmas meal last year\nPrince of hugs! As William served up pudding, one guest at the dinner couldn't resist a hug with the royal\nRoyal father-of-three William sat down to eat with people at the charity after he had spent time preparing the meal\nThe Prince of Wales appeared to share a joke with one gentleman who had been invited to the Christmas party\nWheres your hat, William? As dinner guests donned their festive paper hats from Christmas crackers, the royal shook hands with them\nThey will bring together local stakeholders, experts and even house builders to eradicate rough sleeping, 'sofa surfing' and temporary hostels and bring about substantive change.\nAs a member of the Royal Family, William acknowledges his critics may question why someone from such a privileged background believes they can solve such a widespread issue.\nFigures suggest more than 300,000 people – nearly half of whom are children – are homeless, whether living on the streets, in cars, or hostels and other types of temporary accommodation.\nSince William's first visit to The Passage over two decades ago, he has been involved with several organisations working in the field ever since, including Centrepoint and The Big Issue.\nNow the 42-year-old heir to the throne hoped to bring together coalitions of individuals, organisations and businesses to work together based on specific local needs.\nThe programme, run by his Royal Foundation is called 'Homewards'.\nLaunching the ambitious plan last June, he said: 'In a modern and progressive society, everyone should have a safe and secure home, be treated with dignity and given the support they need. Through Homewards, I want to make this a reality and over the next five years, give people across the UK hope that homelessness can be prevented when we collaborate.\nYes chef! Prince William chatted to chefs in the kitchen at The Passage as he took instructions on what to do\nThe Prince of Wales looked festive in a green jumper paired with his apron\n'It's a big task, but I firmly believe that by working together it is possible to make homelessness rare, brief and unrepeated.'\nWilliam has been spotted on several occasions selling copies of the Big Issue. Last year, the royal was spotted spending the afternoon in London supermarket with a seller of the magazine Dave Martin, 61.\nHis visit to Tesco with Dave followed a similar trip out with the Big Issue vendor back in 2022 to mark the future King's 40th birthday.\nOn that occasion, William sold 32 copies of the Big Issue in less than an hour as he spent the day on the streets of Victoria, London.\nHe also wrote for the magazine, explaining he wanted to shine a light on the issue of homelessness, recalling when he first visited a homeless shelter with his mother, the Princess of Wales. He added that Diana, 'in her own inimitable style, was determined to shine a light on an overlooked, misunderstood problem'.\nHe said he plans to take his children to see the work of 'fantastic' organisations he works with 'just as my mother did for me'.",
