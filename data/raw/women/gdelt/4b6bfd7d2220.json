  "body_text": "Arsenal, Chelsea, Man United and Man City Women’s WSL results predicted. Gunners still have tough road ahead.. by Michelle\n2 weeks ago, I published an article on my WSL predictions, detailing where the top 4, including our Gunners, could end up. 2 weeks of WSL fixtures have taken place since then, and now there are only 2 weeks left to the end of the WSL 2022-23 season. At least we will have the Women’s World Cup in summer, so we won’t be completely bereft of football!\nThe only result I did not predict correctly so far, (one which I may be forgiven for I’m sure!) was Man City’s 2-1 loss away to Liverpool. I don’t think any us seen that coming, but from an Arsenal perspectiive, it certainly played to their advantage. Man City held onto 3rd in the WSL (having been ousted from 2nd by Chelsea) but only until our Gunners beat Brighton 4-0 to leapfrog Man City and claim 3rd place. Finishing in the top 3 is critical to ensuring qualification to next season’s Champions League.\nOne other very notable point is that Chelsea, with recent big wins over Everton (7-0) and Leicester (6-0), are now level on Goal Difference with Manchester United, still with a game in hand over the Red Devils.\nThis is the WSL table Top 4, as things currently stand:\nMan United still have 2 WSL games to play, as well as FA Women’s Cup Final 14th May:\n21st May Man United v Man City – I predict +1 point each CRITICAL TOP 4 CLASH!\n27th May Liverpool v Man United – I predict +3 points for United\nOverall, Manchester United can pick up a further 3-6 points though I predict 4.\nChelsea still have 3 WSL games to play, as well as FA Women’s Cup Final 14th May:\n17th May West Ham v Chelsea – I predict +3 points for Chelsea\n21st May Chelsea v Arsenal I predict +1 point each CRITICAL TOP 4 CLASH!\n27th May Reading v Chelsea I predict +3 points for Chelsea\nOverall, Chelsea can pick up 6-9 points though I predict 7.\nArsenal still have 3 WSL games to play, as well as UEFA Women’s Champions League semi-final 1st May:\n17th May Everton v Arsenal – I predict +3 points for Arsenal but won’t be easy\n21st May Chelsea v Arsenal I predict +1 point each CRITICAL TOP 4 CLASH!\n27th May Arsenal v Aston Villa – I predict +3 points for Arsenal but won’t be easy\nOverall, Arsenal can pick up 6-9 points though I predict 7.\nMan City still have 2 WSL games to play:\n21st May Man United v Man City – I predict +1 point each CRITICAL TOP 4 CLASH!\n27th May Man City v Everton – I predict 3 points to City\nOverall, Manchester City can pick up 3-6 points though I predict 4.\nTherefore, my end-of-season point predictions are below but any one of these teams could slip on a banana skin along the way (exactly as Man City did against Liverpool), with any of the teams further down the WSL table, who are all vying to stay out of the relegation zone, whilst Aston Villa & Everton are locked in their own battle for 5th place – notably, Arsenal still have to face Everton (17th May) and Aston Villa on the final day of the WSL season (27th May).\nThe CRITICAL TOP 4 CLASH on 21st May will be the big weekend to decide who, of the top 4, walk away with the most points and the top prize in English Women’s football – disruption awaits I’m sure!\nChelsea 49 + 7 = 56 points\nManchester United 50 + 4 = 54 points\nArsenal 44 + 7 = 51 points\nManchester City 44 + 4 = 49 points\nIf the teams do end in the above position (and I appreciate that there are some BIG IF’s!) then Arsenal would qualify for the 2023-24 Champions League once again.\nIn the meantime, let’s look forward to the Women’s FA Cup Final on Sunday, at a sold out Wembley. BBC One’s live coverage of the Chelsea vs Manchester United FA Cup final on Sunday will be presented by Gabby Logan, with build-up beginning at 13:50 UK. Will you be watching? Who do you want to win the FA Cup? I’m going for the lesser of 2 evils, Manchester United! What about you?\nCOYGW!!\nFollow Michelle on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Womens Team!\nDo you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team? Click here….",
