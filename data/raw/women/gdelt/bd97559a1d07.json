Local business Hair by Sesosi is also continuing to support in the group's efforts/\nSporting support has also come in strength through:\n- Padraig Sairseil C.L.G.\n- Naomh Pól C.L.G.\n- Tullymore Swifts F.C.\n- Donegal Celtic F.C.\n- Acquinas F.C.\n- Fonacab Soccer Development League\n- Olympus Gym West Belfast\n- Lab Gym\nRobert added: \"As a group, we are asking people, if they are in a position to, to contribute to this appeal, to ease the burden on local families.\n\"Last year we were blown away by the response to the appeal and over 200 local children and young people had a brighter fun filled Christmas as a result of the generosity of local people.\"\nDonations for the Toy Appeal can be left at the Glen Community Complex between 9am – 9pm (Mon – Fri), if any other businesses wish to get involved or for more information, ring Robert or Karen at 02890 585544.\nThe Toy Appeal will conclude on Friday December 8 to allow distribution to families.\nFor more information on how to help, or if you are in need of support, please reach out to Glen Community Parent Youth Group here.\nFor all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.",
