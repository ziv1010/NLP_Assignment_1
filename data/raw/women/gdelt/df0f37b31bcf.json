Mooney scored both Wingham's goal in the major and was among the best on field.\nEveryone's looking fit and healthy. We're ready to go\n- Wingham captain-coach Dean Whitlam\n\"Simon's been playing 35s this year, but we'll have him on Saturday,'' Whitlam said.\nWhitlam said the Warriors have an experienced nucleus of players and that's the reason for the success in the past three years.\n\"And we get a couple of new players coming in, whether they be from our 18s or players joining the club to give us a bit of a freshen up,'' he said.\nHe said it's no surprise to be playing the Wildcats.\n\"They've been really consistent throughout the year and they have a good structure,'' he said.\nThe Warriors also boast a solid contingent of ex-Wildcats, including Jordan Howard, Justin Atkins and goal keeper Aaron Green so getting the better of their former club will be a further incentive.\n\"They left Taree when they went to the Coastal (Premier League), but most of them started with Wingham juniors and moved to Taree to play in the old Mid North Coast Premier League,'' Whitlam said.\nRegardless of the result on Saturday Whitlam expects the majority of his side the return in 2025.\n\"Most of them have indicated they want to keep going next year.''\nSaturday's game will be underway from 2.30.\nWingham will also be involved in the Southern League women's B-grade grand final at Tuncurry tonight, where they'll play Tuncurry-Forster Black. This will kickoff at 6pm.\nMeanwhile, the Forster-Tuncurry's Southern United will play Stockton at Stockton in the Newcastle Zone 2 final tomorrow.\nWinner of the match will meet Newcastle Croatia in the grand final.\nSouthern United's reserve grade will also be in action tomorrow, with the third grade bowing out last week.",
