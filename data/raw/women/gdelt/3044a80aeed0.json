We've essentially kept our core group, which was very successful last year, and we've brought in five or six new guys as well, so we've added that bit of depth.\n\"There's no sort of superstars, and that's part of the beauty of it. We're all mates and we're all pretty humble.\n\"There's a few boys from the Central Coast, who have played in the Sydney NPL and at that high level, but no stand-out superstars that think they're Ronaldo.\"\nAfter being eighth in 2023, Belswans had the Northern League One premiership, and promotion, wrapped up with three games to play last year.\nThey finished 12 points clear of second-placed Kahibah to secure passage to the top division for the first time since 1999.\nBelswans, founded in 1935, has a rich history of football in the area.\n\"There are photos in the shed of the club's glory days, and you still see some of the guys from that era there week in, week out,\" Newton said.\n\"They come into the sheds and talk to us and that's part of the beauty of the whole club. They're all still there and supporting it.\"\nThe team will be built on hard work and mateship.\n\"We're going to be physical,\" Newton said.\n\"We'll work hard and we've got a good bond, where we're all going to be in it together. Mix that with our quality, and I think we'll go alright.\n\"We've versed a few other NPL clubs [in pre-season]. We haven't really had any confidence-booster games, which I think is a good thing because it's shown us the level we need to be at.\n\"We versed an NPL side from Sydney, who came up and showed us the level of quality and professionalism that we want to be at, and we held our own there. We lost 4-2 to APIA, so we've seen where we want to be and that's the direction we're going.\"\nRound one continues on Friday night when defending premiers and champions Broadmeadow travel to Edgeworth for a grand final rematch.\nOn Saturday, Maitland host Valentine and Cooks Hill are away to Newcastle Olympic. On Sunday, Charlestown are home to Weston and Charity Shield winners Jaffas play New Lambton at Arthur Edden Oval.\nLake Macquarie City, whose men's team have been relegated, also enter a new era this weekend when they field an NPL women's team. The club has replaced Warners Bay.\nWide player Brooke Summers, who joined Lake Macquarie from competition heavyweights Newcastle Olympic, has been named club captain and is keen for their first-up test against defending premiers Maitland at Cooks Square Park on Sunday.\n\"It will be a good test,\" Summers said.\n\"Personally, I want to come out against a strong team and just prove our point, that we are a team to beat this year and that we aren't messing around. I want to do that by playing the big club straight away.\n\"It is unknown. So many of us have never played together before, and that's hard, but we've got a really great squad. We've got some new recruits coming from America, so we're definitely coming together.\"\nThe opening round kicks off with New Lambton hosting defending champions and Charity Shield victors Charlestown on Saturday. Also on Sunday, Broadmeadow battle Olympic at Magic Park.",
