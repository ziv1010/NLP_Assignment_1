It’s staying true to who I am. Hopefully by doing that each and every day, it works out in the end.\"\nBlack History Month, celebrated from 1-31 October, continues to shine a spotlight on athletes who have broken barriers to achieve success.\nShaw, who is nominated for this year's Ballon d'Or award, says she feels the responsibility of being a role model but hopes more will follow in her footsteps, particularly in Jamaica.\n\"I just try to be the best I can be and hope that by doing that, there are others looking on [who can] see that if I can do it, then it’s possible,\" she added.\n\"Hopefully I can inspire a lot of the young girls back home in Jamaica that it is definitely possible.\n\"It’s been a long journey for me. I had to travel around the world to get here. Now I am here, I’m just embracing the moment and loving every part of it.\n\"The ups and downs are parts of life and that’s how you grow as a person. But I just try to be the best that I can and hopefully inspire more girls.\"\nRelated topics\n- Published1 October 2024",
