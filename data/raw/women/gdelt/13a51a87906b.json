  "body_text": "Kansas City Current step into another night at CPKC Stadium carrying the weight of a streak that’s turned into their identity. Vlatko Andonovski’s squad hasn’t dropped a single home game all season, and they’re riding 13 straight without a loss since May, the one stumble coming, of all teams, against Seattle Reign. That memory lingers, adding a bit of edge to Saturday’s NWSL matchup.\nThe fortress that defines them\nCPKC Stadium, which opened in March 2024 as the first purpose-built stadium for professional women’s soccer, has already lived up to the hype. Since the doors opened, Current have played 31 times there across competitions and only once walked away beaten. In league play, the record is just as striking: 16 wins in 22 home games, failing to score on just two occasions. They’ve taken 17 of their last 20 at home, outscoring opponents 46–9 in that span. It’s little wonder they sit on top with 50 points, reached that total faster than anyone before, and own the stingiest defense in the league with just 10 goals conceded.\nAnd the numbers don’t tell the whole story without naming names. Goalkeeper Lorena is in the middle of a career season, already with 11 shutouts—the most ever in a single season for the club—and only two away from tying the league record. Up front, Temwa Chawinga keeps finding ways to score. Twelve goals in 19 games, keeping herself alive in the Golden Boot race, and giving Current that cutting edge they can lean on.\nPlaying at CPKC, Kansas City look and feel like champions. The confidence is obvious, and the atmosphere around them makes it all the harder for visiting teams to believe they have a chance.\nSeattle won’t back down\nReign walk in with the rare advantage of already having beaten this team once this year. That 1–0 result back in May proved that cracks exist, even if only briefly. On that day, Kansas City trailed for more than an hour, something they haven’t had to endure in any other game since. For Seattle, that’s the sort of evidence that breeds belief.\nJess Fishlock, now 39 and still dictating games, represents that fight. She’s the one who can flip a match in a moment. Behind her, goalkeeper Claudia Dickey has been solid all year, posting six clean sheets and edging closer to club milestones of her own.\nAnd when you step back and look at the history, the matchup is tighter than the table suggests. Six wins for Reign, five for Current, one draw. So even with a 20-point gulf separating them right now, Saturday’s clash doesn’t read like some routine league fixture. It feels like one of those games that could tilt the story of the season, even if just a little.",
