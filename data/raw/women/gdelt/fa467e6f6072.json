  "body_text": "Good morning, Chicago.\nLet me be straight here and say I just finished watching Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show and since I’m supposed to write down a few thoughts, long story short: Holy smokes. How could you not swoon over that? I even felt a chill or two, writes Christopher Borrelli.\nIt was rousing, funny, surprisingly touching. Understand, I love Super Bowl halftime shows, but usually because they’re bonkers. For decades, they went beyond nuts. Until a few (Prince in 2007; Madonna in 2012; Beyoncé in 2013) transcended nuts. Bad Bunny’s was closer to a cultural moment, a paradigm shift, a reimagining of how much a halftime spectacle can resemble art. It was a love letter to home and a hand extended outward, inviting you to dance with him. No question, here was one of the more understandable halftimes.\nRead the full column from the Tribune’s Christopher Borrelli and see photos from the performance.\nHere are the top stories you need to know to start your day, including the return of the Chicago Auto Show, exploring whether the Bears are serious about a new stadium in Gary and what to know about Chicago Black Restaurant Week.\nToday’s eNewspaper edition | Subscribe to more newsletters | Asking Eric | Horoscopes | Puzzles & Games | Today in History\nMayor Johnson’s ICE executive order would compromise investigations of immigration agents, state’s attorney says\nIn a memo sent to employees, the policy chief for Cook County State’s Attorney Eileen O’Neill Burke said the city’s “ICE on notice” executive order compromises potential prosecutions of federal agents by politicizing the investigations.\nThe executive order announced by Mayor Brandon Johnson last Saturday has resulted in ongoing strife between the mayor and the county’s top prosecutor, who would be responsible for bringing any charges against immigration agents whose conduct in the Chicago area has drawn scrutiny and condemnation.\nToni Preckwinkle didn’t seek Chicago Teachers Union’s endorsement. Why not?\nWhen the Chicago Teachers Union unveiled its latest political endorsements last week ahead of the March primary, one name was notably absent: Toni Preckwinkle.\nLate Cook County property tax distributions spell trouble for libraries\nVillage library leaders have added their voices to the chorus of complaints about delayed and sporadic distributions of Cook County property tax revenues, saying the situation has drained their reserves, making it harder to hire or buy new books.\nAnd in the latest complication in Cook County’s ongoing property tax woes, about $175 million in excess money was sent to taxing bodies that weren’t expecting it.\nIllinois 9th District race tests long Jewish legacy in 15-way Democratic Party fight to succeed Schakowsky\nFor nearly eight decades, Illinois’ 9th Congressional District has been a Democratic stronghold with an almost unbroken tradition of Jewish representation — a political lineage stretching back to the aftermath of World War II and shaped by generations of voters clustered around historically Jewish suburbs and neighborhoods.\nThat history now collides with a changing district and a crowded, high-stakes Democratic Party field vying to succeed longtime U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who will retire after 28 years in Congress.\nAmid chaotic data center debates, industry warns Illinois will miss out unless privacy law weakened\nArtificial intelligence companies are threatening to shun Illinois and build their most advanced data centers in Wisconsin and Indiana if the state doesn’t dilute its privacy law, the toughest in the country.\nLots of Illinoisans won’t be running to their defense.\nChicago Auto Show returns with plenty of EVs and a resurgence of gas-powered muscle\nIn recent years, the Chicago Auto Show has been steering toward electric vehicles, following the ambitious state and national agenda to convert the industry from combustion engines to cleaner technology, incentivized by governmental tax credits and rebates.\nWhile EVs are still center stage at the 2026 auto show at McCormick Place, there may not be quite as much buzz this year with slumping sales and the end of federal tax credits under President Donald Trump.\nLong-beleaguered Gary is serious about the Bears. Are the Bears serious about Gary?\nThere is a plan, however rough or premature. However fantastical or far-fetched. There is a plan, with a Bears stadium somewhere near Miller Beach, with retail, restaurants and places of gathering: a year-round, multipurpose attraction near Indiana Dunes National Park, amid the hiking trails and kayaking spots and not far from city streets full of so much amassed heartbreak and neglect.\nThat it is a possibility at all, however remote and unlikely, has inspired an uncommon belief in this long-beleaguered city. Could it be Gary’s time after so many years of sorrow? Or is this nothing but a cruel dangling of possibility for a place so accustomed to loss and false hope?\nLindsey Vonn breaks leg in downhill crash at Winter Olympics, in stable condition after surgery\nLindsey Vonn’s defiant bid to win the Winter Olympic downhill at the age of 41, on a rebuilt right knee and a badly injured left knee, ended yesterday in a frightening crash that left her with a broken leg and saw her taken to safety by a rescue helicopter for the second time in nine days.\n- Breezy Johnson’s winding road leads to Olympic downhill gold for US on day marred by Lindsey Vonn’s crash\n- US Olympians speaking up about politics at home face online backlash — including from Donald Trump\n- 2026 Winter Olympics: Meet the medalists from the United States\nSeattle Seahawks ride their ‘Dark Side’ defense to a Super Bowl title, pounding the New England Patriots 29-13\nDefense won this championship.\nDevon Witherspoon, Derick Hall, Byron Murphy and the rest of Mike Macdonald’s ferocious unit pummeled Drake Maye, and the Seattle Seahawks beat the New England Patriots 29-13 to win the franchise’s second Super Bowl.\nChicago Black Restaurant Week returns for its 11th year, celebrating Black culinary excellence\nChicago Black Restaurant Week returns for its 11th year, spotlighting Black-owned restaurants and businesses across Chicago and the surrounding suburbs.\nRunning from Feb. 8 through Feb. 22, the annual event follows Chicago Restaurant Week and invites diners to support local Black-owned establishments through curated food and drink specials.\nRestaurant review: Great Lake, reincarnated as a grocery and bakery, still makes profound pizza in Chicago\nGreat Lake makes the most profound and puzzling pizza in Chicago, but it is not a pizzeria.\nIt’s a small grocer and small bakery, said Nick Lessins, co-owner and co-operator with Lydia Esparza.
