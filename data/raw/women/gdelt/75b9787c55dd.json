As a player, it's so special, and the fact that we're doing it consistently now, as Arsenal and as a club, we're really paving the way.\n\"It's what we deserve. It's nice to play in front of as many people as possible, and hopefully it's something we continue to do. It's credit to the women's game and credit to the fans.\"\nThose bumper crowds have witnessed an enthralling WSL title race this season. Russo's Arsenal are battling it out with both Manchester City and leaders Chelsea, the latter of whom will host the Gunners at Stamford Bridge later this month.\n\"It's really close,\" she says of the title race. \"It's going to be tough, [Chelsea] are a top quality side.\n\"This league, this title race and everything that comes with it, is massive. You've got to be bringing your A-Game every week.\"\nRusso is well aware of the need to pay respect to those that paved the way in women's football and fought for her right to be able to play in front of such huge crowds.\nReflecting on her favourite-ever players, Russo adds: \"I was a massive fan of Kelly Smith when I was a kid, and she's my coach now, which is really cool. It's a bit of a full-circle moment. I used to love watching her play. She was a top quality forward.\n\"Also Marta. What she did for Brazil and for football in general, she's a true legend of the game. [Her retirement] was a sad day for football, but the legacy she's left on the game is incredible. She'll go down in the history books forever, because she was an unbelievable player, but also a pioneer of the women's game.\"",
