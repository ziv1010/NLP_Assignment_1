As a result, African nations boycotted the tournament, and most Asian nations also chose not to participate.\nThe decision on who could host these prestigious tournaments was similarly controlled by Western countries.\nEuropean and North American nations predominantly received hosting rights for decades, while Arab countries were largely excluded.\nMorocco, for example, attempted to host the World Cup in 1994, 1998, 2006, and 2010 but was unsuccessful each time.\nRecent developments, however, have shifted this dynamic. The Arab world is now prominently featured as a host of some of the biggest sporting events on the global stage.\nThis shift is due to several factors.\nThe Qatar 2022 World Cup is a big one. Although the international media often highlighted the challenging conditions of migrant workers in the small Gulf nation, the tournament was widely seen as a success worldwide, particularly by FIFA, the governing body.\nIt was well-organised, well-funded and well-backed by sponsors. It was also a competition that brought Arab nations together and on and off the pitch, the teams and the fans – especially Morocco and Saudi Arabia – impressed. The world saw the passion for football in the region.\nCountries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have also transformed their relationships with the global sports community.\nTraditionally, major international sporting bodies, such as FIFA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), have been based in Europe, with their leadership typically European.\nBoth FIFA and the IOC are headquartered in Switzerland, led by an Italian and a German, respectively. However, these organisations are now adopting a more global outlook, with a special focus on the MENA region. FIFA President Gianni Infantino's frequent visits to Qatar and Saudi Arabia highlight this change.\nSaudi Arabia’s ambitions to become a global sporting hub have further accelerated this transformation. Formula One, a sport historically rooted in Europe, now regularly races in Saudi Arabia, as well as in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Bahrain. This demonstrates how the region is no longer just a spectator but an active participant in the global sports scene.\nGrowing appetite for MENA sporting events\nGiven the success of these events, there is now a growing appetite for live sporting events in the region.\nWhile the Paris 2024 Olympics was seen as a major success and will be followed by Los Angeles in 2028, Western cities have become increasingly hesitant to take on the financial and logistical challenges of hosting.\nThis has led global sports leaders to consider Africa, Asia, and the Middle East as alternatives.\nSaudi Arabia, for instance, will host the 2034 World Cup. Although there will likely be criticism around human rights and migrant worker issues, as with Qatar, sporting officials believe that the event itself will draw most of the world’s attention.\nThe smooth hosting of the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia, which was well-received by FIFA, further solidified the region’s ability to stage major international events.\nMorocco is another country stepping up. It successfully hosted the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup, with an average attendance of over 40,000, and the 2022 Women’s African Cup, which broke all attendance records. Next year, the country will also host the 2025 African Cup of Nations, marking its first time hosting the competition since 1988.\nMorocco’s persistence in pursuing major events has continued to pay off. After five unsuccessful attempts, the country’s sixth bid was finally successful. The country will now co-host the 2030 World Cup with Portugal and Spain.\nQatar, on the other hand, set a high standard by constructing ten state-of-the-art stadiums and a new metro system for the 2022 World Cup.\nFollowing the major tournaments in South Africa, Brazil, and Russia, many admired the efficiency of Qatar’s event. Doha is expected to be a strong contender for the 2036 Olympics due to this success.\nSaudi Arabia is now following suit by constructing new arenas for the 2034 World Cup, with FIFA officials confident that the country will be fully prepared.\nA chance for Egypt?\nEgypt, with its long-standing ambition to host international events, is emerging as a strong contender for major sporting events and is now aiming to secure the Olympics.\nThe country has a long history of bidding for the Games, starting with its first bid in 1916, followed by another in 1936, both of which lost out to Berlin (though the 1916 Games were cancelled due to the First World War). Egypt tried again in 2008 but did not make the shortlist, losing to Beijing.\nAlthough Egypt’s history suggests that its bids for the 2036 or 2040 Olympics might face challenges, there is optimism that the country could eventually succeed, much like Morocco did after several attempts.\nRecently, Egypt has made major advancements in upgrading its sports facilities. The Egypt International Olympic City, a new complex near Cairo, includes a 93,000-seat stadium, Olympic-grade swimming pools, and gymnastics halls, which strengthen Egypt's bid to host the Olympics.\nDespite these improvements, one must face reality.\nThe 2036 Olympics could pose a challenge for Egypt as the event may be held in Asia after Los Angeles (2028) and Brisbane (2032), with competing bids from countries like India, Indonesia, and Turkey.\nAdditionally, concerns remain about Egypt’s financial situation, which could impact its ability to host the Games successfully.\nIf not successful in 2036, Egypt might still have a strong chance for the 2040 Olympics, given its ongoing preparations.\nAll things considered, it is clear that Arab nations have shown their ability to rapidly develop the necessary infrastructure, as demonstrated by Qatar for the 2022 World Cup.\nWhen Qatar was awarded hosting rights in 2010, it surprised many and faced heavy criticism. The event’s success highlighted that hosting major global sporting events in the Arab world is becoming more routine rather than extraordinary.\nJohn Duerden has covered Asian sports for over 20 years for The Guardian, Associated Press, ESPN, BBC, and the New York Times, as well as various Asian media.
