That contribution helped PSG to also complete a domestic clean sweep and reach the final of the Club World Cup.\nIt was a spectacular campaign for the French club and an even more extraordinary one for Dembele, the 28-year-old winger turned centre-forward whose previous most prolific season had delivered 14 goals for Barcelona in 2018⁄19.\nYamal, still just 18, stands out among the other nominees having emerged as a superstar on the wing at Barcelona, where he is seen as the successor to Lionel Messi.\nHe won the Kopa Trophy for the best player aged under 21 at last year’s Ballon d’Or gala, fresh from having helped Spain to European Championship glory.\nHe scored 18 goals in 55 games in all competitions last season as Barcelona won La Liga and the Spanish Copa del Rey, but they lost in the Champions League semi-finals to Inter.\nThe Ballon d’Or is now voted for on the basis of achievements during last season, rather than over a calendar year as in the past.\nOther notable nominees include Viktor Gyokeres, Erling Haaland, Harry Kane, Cole Palmer, and the key duo from Liverpool’s 2024-2025 Premier League triumph, Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk.\nMbappe and Vinicius Junior are on the list too, a year after Real Madrid boycotted the ceremony, outraged that the latter had been overlooked for the prize.\nCould Chloe Kelly’s role in England’s Euro 2025 win earn her the Ballon d’Or?\nThe Ballon d’Or is voted for by a panel of journalists, one from each of the top 100 countries in the FIFA world rankings.\nIt is the top 50 for the women, in which the field appears wide open as Barcelona and Spain star Bonmati goes for a treble.\nBonmati, 27, is an exceptional talent and was named player of the tournament at the UEFA Women’s Euro in July.\nYet Spain lost the final of that tournament on penalties to England, and Bonmati’s Barcelona also lost the Champions League final to Arsenal in May.\nWhat may work either in her favour, or that of teammate and two-time former winner Alexia Putellas, is that there is no obvious standout from the England team that triumphed at the Euros.\nLucy Bronze, goalkeeper Hannah Hampton, Alessio Russo and captain Leah Williamson are all nominated from that side, as is Chloe Kelly, who scored the decisive penalty in the final.",
