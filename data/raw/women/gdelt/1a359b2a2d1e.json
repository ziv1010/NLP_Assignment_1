  "body_text": "- Sam Darnold is engaged to marketing specialist Katie Hoofnagle.\n- The couple went Instagram-official in 2023 and got engaged in 2025.\n- Like Darnold, Hoofnagle is a California native, hailing from the Bay Area.\nSam Darnold is vying for the ring at Super Bowl LX, but his fiancée, Katie Hoofnagle, already got her bling.\nThe Seattle Seahawks starting quarterback proposed to his girlfriend in July 2025, two years after the couple went Instagram-official. Hoofnagle shared the news of their engagement on her Instagram, posting a series of romantic photos of her and Darnold embracing by the beach in Dana Point, California. She also shared a snap of the proposal itself, showing the NFL star down on one knee amidst a circle of flowers and candles. “YES!!!!!” Hoofnagle captioned the joint post.\nAhead of the big game in February 2026, Darnold took an opportunity to gush about his “great fiancée” at a press conference. “She does a lot for me, and she keeps me calm,” he said. “She reminds me of why I do what I do, why I go to work every single day. Even though it doesn’t really feel like work—I love this game. I love my teammates, love my coaching staff…but sometimes, the season can get long, but she makes it all the [more] worthwhile.”\nHere’s everything to know about Sam Darnold’s fiancée, Katie Hoofnagle.\nShe’s a Bay Area native.\nHoofnagle shared in a 2021 LinkedIn post that she’s from the San Francisco Bay Area. “[T]he safe post-grad decision in a world full of uncertainty would have been to move home and take advantage of the professional growth opportunities present in The Bay,” the then-new grad wrote, adding, “however, I knew for me, going home to CA wasn’t going to provide me the personal growth that I needed.\n“At the end of the day, there’s more to life than just my career and I knew I needed to dig my roots somewhere new,” she continued, explaining that she decided to move to Charlotte, North Carolina after graduating from the University of South Carolina.\nDarnold shares her West coast roots, hailing from Dana Point himself. While Hoofnagle went across the country for college, he stayed relatively local, attending the other USC: the University of Southern California.\nShe was a soccer player at the University of South Carolina.\nYep, she knows ball. At the University of South Carolina, Hoofnagle was a student-athlete, playing soccer on the women’s club team for four years and regularly sharing team snaps to her Instagram. Her background in sports is another way she connects with Darnold: When the NFL season brings chaos for her QB fiancé, she gets it.\n“The support [from] my girlfriend is unbelievable,” Darnold told Us Weekly in 2025. “You know, the fact that she just understands it. She’s a former athlete herself, and just gets kind of the grind of everything. When I just want to chill, she’s very up for that, especially during the season.”\nShe also encourages him to get out of the house during the off-season. “If she wants to go somewhere and I just want to chill, she’s like, ‘Let’s go out to dinner. We need to go to dinner,’” he added.\nShe works in marketing.\nIn 2020, Hoofnagle graduated from the University of South Carolina with a degree in marketing. She began working for a loan management company in Charlotte soon after, per her LinkedIn. She and Darnold may have unknowingly crossed paths in Charlotte, as he played for the Carolina Panthers from 2021 to 2022. It’s also possible they met in her hometown in the Bay, since Darnold played for the San Francisco 49ers in 2023.\nRelated Stories\nHe shared in a pre-Super Bowl LX press conference that the couple “did long distance” for some time over the last few years. “There was some tough times with trying to figure out, you know, just a lot of things…we’ve been through a lot together in the last few years, and I think I’ll think of her [on the field],” he told reporters.\nHoofnagle’s LinkedIn shows she now works at Renvio, a health technology company, while living in the Seattle area with Darnold.\nShe and Darnold went Instagram-official in 2023.\nWhen Darnold turned 26 in June 2023, Hoofnagle took to Instagram to post a sweet tribute to her then-boyfriend. The post also doubled as their hard-launch as a couple. Alongside selfies of her and the athlete, FaceTime screenshots, and snaps of them recreating his famous pointing meme, she penned a thoughtful caption.\n“[Y]our huge heart, goofy energy, and ability to quote every movie you’ve ever seen are unmatched. happy 26th birthday, celebrating you is so easy! 🤍,” the marketing specialist wrote. He commented, “#lactaid,” referencing the last slide of her post where both are holding the lactose-intolerance treatment.\nShe’d previously soft-launched their relationship in an April 2023 Instagram post, showing flowers she’d received from Darnold and dropping a subtle selfie of the two of them. “We’re pretty sick,” he commented on the post.\nShe’s the quarterback’s biggest cheerleader.\nHoofnagle isn’t afraid to show her support for her all-star partner, becoming a regular at games as she cheers on her future husband. At the start of the 2025-26 season, she posed with her fellow Seahawks WAGs and showed off their game-day style, captioning an Instagram post of the group, “football & my elevated resting heart rate are back.”\nWhen his team secured their spot in Super Bowl LX, she shared a photo of the pair kissing on the field to her Instagram with the caption, “WE’RE NOT DONE YET!!!” Perhaps they’ll recreate the shot after the big game?",
