They will dominate the ball in the final and are known for their focus on the technical, but there are two players in the England who are trained in exactly that themselves.\nBronze and Walsh both moved to Barcelona last summer and have seen the likes of Aitana Bonmati, Alexia Putellas, Salma Paralluelo, Irene Paredes and Mariona Caldentey on a daily basis.\n\"They're very technical. I think it will be a great game to watch as a fan,\" Kelly said of Spain in the latest episode of Lionesses: Down Under connected by EE.\nREAD THE LATEST LIONESSES WOMEN'S WORLD CUP 2023 NEWS HERE\n\"With Lucy and Keira playing for Barcelona, we have a lot of insight into their players which is great for us. And to see Lucy and Keira, the changes they've made since they went to Barcelona, we know the great football they play in Spain,\" she added.\n\"But I think we can focus on ourselves and how we can break them down. We have a lot of quality in this team, it's very exciting.\"\nKelly also lifted the lid on the mood in the England since beating Australia on Wednesday to book their place in the final.\n\"It's amazing. We keep saying round the hotel, 'What are you doing on Sunday?' A World Cup final, it's amazing. This is what dreams are made of,\" she said.\n\"For me, it feels like another game. Of course, it's the World Cup Final and there's a lot of buzz around it, but I think every game for us is very important and every game getting to this moment was very special. But a World Cup Final, when you grow up and watch these games, it was a dream to play in one, so I think everyone is of course very excited, but we have a job to do.\"\nWATCH THE WOMEN'S WORLD CUP FINAL PREVIEW EDITION OF 90MIN TALKS\nRachel & Sophie from Girls On The Ball chat with Alex Ibaceta for this extra special episode of 90min Talks, discussing the semi-finals which saw The Lionesses beat hosts Australia and look ahead at the historic World Cup final.
