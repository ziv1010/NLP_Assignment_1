The World Cup should be moved to another country to send a clear message that international law still matters.’\nThe US president announced over the weekend that he would be imposing 10% tariffs on the UK, increased to 25% from June 1, until a deal is reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark.\nHe said the same would apply to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland.\nThe move sparked outrage across Europe, with Sir Keir Starmer telling an emergency press conference today that tariffs were ‘completely wrong’.\nHe added: ‘It is not the right way to resolve differences within an alliance, nor is it helpful to frame efforts to strengthen Greenland security as a justification for economic pressure.’\nIn a joint statement warning about the potential impact of such a move, the eight affected NATO countries warned Trump’s actions could create a ‘dangerous downward spiral’.\nMore Trending\nThey said: ‘We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland.\n‘Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind.\n‘Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.’\nMetro has approached the Football Association and the Government for comment.\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.\nMORE: Top Trump ally sides with Starmer over Greenland hours after president’s tantrum\nMORE: Trump says he ‘gets on very well’ with Starmer after attacking him over Chagos Islands",
