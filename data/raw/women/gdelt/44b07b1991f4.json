Full details on how to watch Wales vs Armenia just below.\nWales vs Armenia: match preview\nAaron Ramsey captains Wales in Cardiff, as the home team also hand starts to Dan James, Brennan Johnson and Kieffer Moore.\nArmenia's XI features Grant-Leon Ranos, a 19-year-old forward who will join Borussia Monchengladbach on July 1.\nWales will be looking to bolster their Euro 2024 qualification hopes when Armenia visit the Cardiff City Stadium on Friday night. Rob Page's side got their campaign off to a decent start in March, drawing 1-1 with Croatia, before a 1-0 defeat of Latvia. Needing a top-two finish to book their spot at the tournament in Germany, Wales are second going into this crunch clash with Armenia.\nThis is the type of match the Dragons simply must win if they want to be among the 24 qualifiers. Their group is not the trickiest – Croatia are clear favourites to win it, with Wales and Turkey vying for second – and qualification could ultimately be determined by which teams are able to avoid unexpected slip-ups.\nWales are still in the infancy of the post-Gareth Bale era. Their greatest ever player hung up his boots after the World Cup, from which he and his compatriots were sent packing in the group phase. Bale was a long-time talisman for his country and it will no doubt take a while for Wales to hone their approach without him.\nPage's team do not lack spirit. They notched an equaliser in the third minute of second-half stoppage time to deny Croatia victory on matchday one. That result looks even better three months on following Zlatko Dalic's men's 4-2 victory of the Netherlands in the Nations League on Wednesday.\nArmenia are one of those sides who hope to benefit from the expansion of the European Championship, but reaching next year's edition looks like a tall order. They have gone nine matches without a win and lost 2-1 at home to Turkey in their opening qualifier.\nWith Croatia in action elsewhere, Wales will go top of the Group D standings with a win in this one.\nFollow our guide as we explain all the ways to get a Wales vs Armenia live stream wherever you are – starting with how to watch Euro 2024 for FREE on BBC iPlayer in the UK.\nRelated: how to watch a Premier League live stream\nHow to watch a Wales vs Armenia live stream in the UK for FREE\nWales vs Armenia kicks off at 7.45pm BST on Friday evening, and it's being shown for free on Welsh-language channel S4C, which is available through BBC iPlayer.\nTravelling outside the UK right now?\nUse ExpressVPN to watch BBC iPlayer from abroad.\nWales vs Armenia is also being shown on streaming service Viaplay, which has the rights to the lion's share of the Euro 2024 qualifiers in the UK, including and costs £14.99 per month or £143.88 per year.\nThe service also shows live coverage of La Liga football, the NHL, United Rugby Championship, the Rugby League Championship, plus the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship and Champions Hockey League.\nWatch a Wales vs Armenia live stream from anywhere\nIf you're abroad right now and struggling to tap into your usual coverage of the 2024 Euro qualifiers, you'll want a VPN.
