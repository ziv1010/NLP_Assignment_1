  "body_text": "BLANTYRE-(MaraviPost)-National Bank of Malawi plc has reaffirmed its commitment to gender equity and community empowerment through sports by officially launching the NBM Women’s Premiership on Saturday at Mpira Stadium in Blantyre, describing the sponsorship as a movement to break barriers for women in underserved communities.\nSpeaking during the launch, National Bank of Malawi plc Chief Finance Officer, Daniel Jere, emphasised the importance of investing in women and promoting equity through sports.\n“Our interest in sponsoring this tournament is rooted in our belief in the value that women bring to society, including in sport. Women’s football holds great potential to uplift lives, especially in underserved communities.\n“This is not just a tournament; it is the beginning of a movement powered by National Bank to promote inclusion, equity, and empowerment,” said Jere.\nJere also highlighted its intention to use the league to promote financial inclusion, leveraging its digital platforms such as Mo626 ice, Wallet, and Fast Serve Agents to reach more communities.\nFootball Association of Malawi (FAM) President Fleetwood Haiya hailed the league as a milestone in the development of women’s football in Malawi, stating that it aligns with FAM’s strategic plan to professionalise and expand opportunities for female athletes.\n“This is a national kick-off. We envisioned this in our strategic plan, and today we celebrate the realisation of that dream. We thank National Bank of Malawi plc for making this possible.\n“This league will improve competition and provide a strong platform for scouting talent for the Scorchers, just as the men’s Super League has done for the Flames,” said Haiya.\nThe launch was followed by a tightly contested opening match between FCB Nyasa Big Bullets Women and Kukoma Ntopwa Women.\nKukoma Ntopwa emerged victorious with a narrow 1-0 win.\nEsther Chauluka was the star of the day, scoring a decisive goal in the 45th minute, sealing the win for the side fondly known as the ‘Amaghetto Women’.\nThe NBM Women’s Premiership will see women’s football clubs from across the country battle for supremacy, with scouts, coaches, and fans keenly watching for the next generation of stars.",
