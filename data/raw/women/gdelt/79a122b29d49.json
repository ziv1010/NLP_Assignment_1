  "body_text": "Canberra United legend Grace Gill has high hopes that the club's rocky period of uncertainty is in the past as positive news about a deal with a new ownership group looms.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nIt's been one week since the 2024-25 A-League Women season wrapped up with the Central Coast Mariners crowned champions, but the Australian Professional Leagues and Capital Football have been tight-lipped on revealing details of what the future of Canberra United actually looks like.\nUnited fans have patiently awaited updates, but those have been few and far between, offering equal doses of promise as well as more uncertainty.\nBut former Matilda-turned-commentator Gill is adamant a breakthrough is on the horizon.\n\"I believe that there has to be a Canberra team in the women's game, and I feel confident that there will be,\" Gill told The Canberra Times.\n\"As to what that looks like, what the ownership looks like and the timing of that, I wish I knew a little bit more, but I don't.\n\"I do feel confident, and I do feel assured that there will continue to be a Canberra team, but I want it to be done in the right way, and I want the players and the coaching staff to be supported in a way that's sustainable as well.\"\nFor now, the same waiting game continues for the second-straight year. It must feel like de ja vu for United fans and those in the squad.\nJust like last year, Capital Football is not committed to operating the A-League Women team next season, meanwhile a prospective new ownership group is keenly but quietly working towards a deal to take over the licence - with or without an A-League Men's team.\nUnlike last year though, in April, APL executive chairman Stephen Conroy confidently declared United would definitely remain in the A-League Women competition next season.\nAlso unlike last year when the club faced a frantic process to avoid folding due to financial pressures, from the outset of the 2024-25 campaign Capital Football has made its intentions to focus on community football crystal clear, even though the sporting body remains supportive of United remaining in the A-League.\n\"Capital Football continues to work with the APL and ACT government on options to secure the future of Canberra United. Capital Football strongly believes that the region deserves an A-League club,\" a spokesperson told this masthead this week.\n\"However, we remain steadfast in our decision that the running of the team is not Capital Football's core business and transferring the team to a dedicated organisation is the best way to ensure the club's future success.\"\nUnfortunately until that transfer of the A-League Women licence to another operator is finally completed, there is a bit of frustration brewing in the background, from United fans and the off-contract squad.\nGill said delays to announcing United's future would be tough for the squad to deal with.\n\"I'd be naive to suggest that it wouldn't be [tough on players], because when you're a player you have conversations with the coach or the manager around what the future of the club is, and Canberra hasn't been in a position where they can offer longevity to players,\" Gill said.\n\"That's a really difficult position for the club to be in, and that's a really difficult position for players to then try and plan their future the next 12 months, because it's genuinely up in the air.\"\nGill said rookie head coach Antoni Jagarinec should be a priority for United to lock down for next season after leading the team to an A-League finals berth in his first year in the role, with a very young and inexperienced squad.\n\"He's absolutely done enough to be re-signed,\" the Canberra Croatia club legend said.\nMORE CANBERRA SPORT\n\"Carrying the team from where it was to where it finished this season with the context of not knowing what the future looked like, to sell that to a player I think is a real credit to Ant, and his knowledge of the local league, the players, and then being able to draw a few interstate players in to really bolster the team.\n\"The fact that they made finals says all we need to know. I really would hope to see Ant again in Canberra, but if for any reason that doesn't happen then I've got no doubt other clubs would be having conversations.\"\nAs the Matildas come to town to play in front of a sold-out crowd in Canberra on Monday, many of whom have played for United at one stage of their glittering careers, it brings more attention to the foundation club's plan for the next A-League season.\nBut for now, the wait for more clarity continues.\nCanberran Matilda makes 'significant' history in the commentator's booth\nIs this the new voice of Canberra soccer?\nFormer Canberra United star turned commentator Grace Gill is set to make history when the Matildas come to the capital to play Argentina next Monday night.\nGill will be the first former Matilda to be the main caller of a national soccer match when she leads the broadcast for Paramount Plus.\nDescribed as a \"landmark moment\" by the broadcaster, the achievement adds to an already impressive post-playing career resume for Gill, who retired from soccer in 2016.\n\"The significant point is the fact that it's a woman's voice on the women's game, so that feels really special,\" Gill told The Canberra Times.\n\"That there's a link to being a former Matilda as well magnifies it, and to do it in Canberra where I grew up too, it feels like a really special occasion.\"\n\"It's something that I've thought about for a while, and I wasn't entirely sure when that opportunity would come about. It's happened perhaps even a little sooner than I might have thought, but I'm taking the opportunity with both hands and I feel ready for it.\"\nGill was a foundation player at Canberra United and totalled 58 matches at the club until her retirement.\nShe also played in the NPLW for Canberra Croatia, and left such a legacy with the Deakin club that its annual women's MVP award - the Grace Gill Player of the Year trophy - is named after her.\nThe Matildas are set to play against Argentina in the first of the two-game series this Friday night at Docklands in Melbourne before the squad travels to Canberra over the weekend.\nOn Sunday, the Matildas will train in the capital in readiness for kick-off at 7.30pm on Monday at Canberra Stadium in Bruce.\nThe Matildas will feed off the energy of their trio of UEFA Women's Champions League winners as they seek to celebrate interim coach Tom Sermanni's milestone match in style.\nSermanni will take charge of Australia for the 150th time when they host Argentina at Docklands Stadium.\nArsenal stars Caitlin Foord, Steph Catley and Kyra Cooney-Cross are set to arrive in Melbourne little more than 24 hours ahead of kick-off, fresh off their historic 1-0 triumph over Barcelona in Lisbon. Their roles in the first Argentina clash are yet to be determined.\nBut veteran midfielder Emily van Egmond expects the trio's presence in camp to give the Matildas a huge boost regardless of how heavily they feature on the pitch.\n\"There will be a massive positive vibe around them,\" van Egmond said. \"Honestly, the girls will probably just want to ask them a bunch of questions about how it all went.\n\"It's a huge credit to them, they've worked so hard and I'm just really, really happy for the girls to be able to experience that.\n\"Not a lot of people in their careers would even get to play Champions League, so to be able to come out and say that you're a winner is amazing.\"\nFoord, Catley and Cooney-Cross joined their national teammate Ellie Carpenter, victorious with Lyon in the past, as Champions League winners.\nSermanni, who returned as interim coach after Tony Gustavsson departed last August, is in his third stint in charge of the Matildas. The 70-year-old famously guided Australia to the Women's Asian Cup title in 2010.\nJoe Montemurro looms as the next Matildas coach, with an announcement expected next month.\nVan Egmond predicts tough encounters with Argentina, who upset seventh-ranked Canada in one of their two meetings last month.\n\"It'll be a physical game again, probably not too dissimilar to Brazil,\" van Egmond said, noting the Matildas' two losses to the South American champions late last year.\n\"They're quite street savvy, so it's a good opportunity for us to get two other friendlies under our belt before the Asia Cup [next year].\"\n- with AAP\nMATILDAS SCHEDULE\nFriday: Matildas v Argentina at Docklands, 8pm\nMonday: Matildas v Argentina at Canberra Stadium, 7.30pm",
