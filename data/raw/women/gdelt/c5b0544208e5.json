  "body_text": "World Cup assigns Pride game to Iran, where homosexuality is punishable by death\nThe 2026 World Cup has assigned an LGBTQ-themed match to Iran, where being gay is punishable by death.\nSeattle was named as one of the host cities over three years ago, and a match set to be played there on 26 June has now been designated a “Pride” match.\nFollowing Friday’s draw and Saturday’s fixture allocation, it has been confirmed that the match will be played by Egypt and Iran, both countries with awful LGBTQ+ records.\nQuoting the local FIFA organising committee FOX 13 Seattle reported that the match is a “rare opportunity to make a lasting impact, one that educates the world, inspires our LGBTQ+ community, and uplifts those businesses and cultural organizations”.\nHowever, same-sex activity between men and women is outlawed in Iran and punishable by death. The regressive laws mean many LGBTQ+ Iranians look for asylum in other countries.\nIn 2021, a United Nations report found the Islamic Republic of Iran imposed electric shock torture on LGBTQ+ children, among other human rights violations.\nHomosexuality itself is not technically illegal in Egypt, but queer people living in the African country face high levels of stigmatisation and discrimination and can be convicted for “debauchery”, “indecency” and “scandalous acts”.\nIn 2023, a landmark documentary detailed queer folks’ “relentless courage” in the face of “relentless oppression” in Egypt.\nDespite concerns about the countries’ laws, the Seattle Pride Match Advisory Committee, set up by organisers to help with the event, have said the game will go ahead as planned.\nA spokesperson told Outsports: “The Pride Match has been scheduled to celebrate and elevate Pride events in Seattle and across the country, and it was planned well in advance.\n“Soccer has a unique power to unite people across borders, cultures, and beliefs. We are honoured to host a Pride Match and to celebrate Pride as part of a global football community.\n“This match reflects our ongoing commitment to respect, dignity, and unity for all.”\nIn 2023, LGBTQ+ non-profit organisation Pride House International announced plans to have a strong presence in every host city in the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\nThe year before, gay footballer Collin Martin blasted FIFA for failing to use the World Cup to advance LGBTQ+ rights in Qatar.\nHomosexuality is criminalised in Qatar and LGBTQ+ people are forced to live their lives in hiding. Despite this, the country was selected to host the World Cup, a decision which has been roundly criticised because of Qatar’s human rights abuses.\nShare your thoughts!
