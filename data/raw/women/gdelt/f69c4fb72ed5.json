Chris has been an amazing support to me and to the team and he has shown in my time here how good of a coach he is.\n“He has an incredible trust with the players, and we believe he is the best person to lead on developing individual talent and getting the best out of the group.\n“A bonus to his fantastic coaching abilities is his knowledge and history with the football club, and to have that within the department is extremely important.\n“Of course, Craig Short and Lewis Price were at the Club when I arrived, and again, they have been incredibly important during my time and beyond.\n“I’m extremely pleased with the coaching department we have, and following what has been a really positive pre-season, we are all looking forward to the upcoming campaign.”",
