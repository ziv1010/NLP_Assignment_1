  "body_text": "The A–Z of Viral Microtrends\nBlokette, whimsigoth, tomato girl, mobwife, gorpcore, old money. It’s 2025, and everything you see (or buy) can likely be folded into a microtrend—and every microtrend has a distinct name, and perhaps a community, behind it. It seems like every word gets the “core” amendment at some point—so much so that it’s hard to keep up with this cacophony of microtrends, thanks to TikTok’s echo chamber of information distribution. Sometimes there are many names for similar trends; can someone explain the exact difference between coquette and angelcore? Other times, the names don’t accurately reflect the aesthetic behind them. Y2K aesthetic fashion looks different today than what it references. To clear things up, we’ve cataloged and explained the biggest microtrends from the past few years.\n(Disclaimer: It can be hard to chart a year of origin, especially since these are often recycled aesthetics.)\nA\nAmericana\nYear of origin: 2010s\nDescription: The Americana aesthetic has debatably been around since 1776, but what we think of in today’s world of TikTok-fueled microtrends was inspired by 1950s WWII-era fashion. Lana Del Rey ultimately brought the patriotic style back when she wore a “Buttwiser” T-shirt and blue-jean cutoffs and waved an American flag in her 2012 “Ride” music video.\nAngelcore\nYear of origin: 2020\nDescription: Angelcore combines feminine coquette fashion with the aesthetic of ancient Greek and Roman art. Just dress like a Botticelli painting.\nB\nBalletcore\nYear of origin: 2023\nDescription: Clothing inspired by ballet, both in performance and practice. Think wrap tops, leg warmers, ballet flats, Ugg boots, baby pink, and lots of tulle. Natalie Portman in Black Swan was the blueprint.\nBarbiecore\nYear of origin: 2023\nDescription: Piggybacking off of the Barbie movie and its subsequent press tour, where Andrew Mukamal embraced what we now know as Method dressing with star Margot Robbie, the concept of dressing like a Barbie entered the mainstream.\nBella Swan core\nYear of origin: 2020\nDescription: Twilight’s main character was known for her late-2000s style of muted earth tones, low-rise jeans, and layered Hollister T-shirts—and now we’re wearing that again, 20 years later.\nBimbocore\nYear of origin: 2022\nDescription: Yet another Y2K subgenre based on ditzy characters like Elle Woods (pre-Harvard), Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie in The Simple Life, and Shelley from The House Bunny. It’s all hot pink on hot pink, tiny skirts, tramp stamps, and impractical heels.\nBlokecore\nYear of origin: 2021\nDescription: A play on the British slang term bloke, bloke core adds elements of English football (soccer) into everyday wear. Think vintage soccer jerseys, baggy jeans, and Adidas Sambas.\nBlokette\nYear of origin: 2023\nDescription: Of all the microtrends, this strange mix of “bloke core” (masculine, sporty) and “coquette” (feminine, delicate) styles might stand as the most controversial. The classic outfit was a football jersey, a frilly white skirt, Adidas Sambas, lacy socks—and bows everywhere.\nBoho Chic\nYear of origin: early 2000s\nDescription: A fashion trend, popular in the early aughts and now experiencing a resurgence, that draws on the aesthetics of the bohemians and hippies of the ‘70s. It’s characterized by flowing silhouettes, floral patterns, and layered, eclectic jewelry.\nBoom Boom\nYear of Origin: 2024\nDescription: The ‘80s popularized a certain in-your-face glamour in its corporate greed and showy displays of wealth. Last year’s Boom Boom aesthetic, coined by Sean Monahan of 8Ball, draws on the gaudy maximalism in loud prints, shoulder pads, and big, gold baubles.\nBrat Summer\nYear of Origin: 2024\nDescription: Initiated by Charli XCX’s “Brat” album, Brat summer is categorized by an edgy Y2k-inspired vibe and covered in Brat green.\nC\nChristian Girl Autumn\nYear of Origin: 2019\nDescription: What would you wear to drink a pumpkin spice latte and take Instagram pictures in a pile of orange leaves? Think cozy sweaters, skinny jeans, ugg boots, and a pom-pom beanie over loose curls.\nClean Girl Aesthetic\nYear of origin: 2022\nDescription: This trend centered on self care, minimalist fashion, natural makeup looks, and an organized lifestyle. Think quality basics, solid colors, skincare over wacky fabrics, heavy makeup, and loud prints.\nCoastal Cowgirl\nYear of origin: 2022\nDescription: Coastal cowgirl is the clash between westernwear and beachwear. The rugged elements of the west like cowboy boots, turquoise jewelry, and suede fringe merge with softer, more delicate influences like sundresses, ethereal linen, and seashell accessories.\nCoastal Grandma\nYear of origin: 2020\nDescription: This is the IRL manifestation of a Nancy Meyers’ movie; Coastal Grandma alludes to that relaxed coastal lifestyle she depicts so well via linen pants, knit sweaters, and nautical influences—all in a neutral color palette, of course.\nCoconut Girl\nYear of Origin: 2020\nDescription: This Y2K subset embodies a summery style reminiscent of the Australian mermaid show H20. Think hibiscus swimsuits, brightly colored tank tops, and tropical prints.\nCoquette\nYear of Origin: 2020\nDescription: This dainty, hyperfeminine style revolves around baby pink, lace, pearls, bows, and mary janes.\nCorpcore/Office Siren\nYear of Origin: 2023\nDescription: This cultural phenomenon brought the romanticization of cubicles and fluorescent lighting as Gen Z headed to the office for the first time. Think sexed-up officewear: bayonetta glasses, tight blazers, pencil skirts, and pointy heels.\nCottagecore\nYear of Origin: 2020\nDescription: Imagine the clothing of a Victorian milkmaid living in a meadow in the middle of nowhere. Think: flower crowns, prairie dresses, flowing skirts, lace, and gingham.\nD\nDark Academia\nYear of origin: 2020\nDescription: This craze brought a newfound mass interest in classic literature, a focus on intellectual pursuits, and a dark, moody aesthetic inspired by libraries, old universities, and vintage fashion. It centers the aesthetic of a 1970s professor: dark trench coats, round glasses, oxfords, tweed pants, and turtleneck sweaters.\nDopamine Dressing\nYear of origin: 2020\nDescription: Amid fallout from the pandemic, dopamine dressing was a way in which people used their clothing, particularly unique accessories, bright colors, and eccentric shapes, to bring them joy.\nE\nE-Girl\nYear of origin: 2019\nDescription: An E-girl is defined not by her IRL ensemble but by her online presence, be that on Twitch, Instagram, or any other social platform. The corresponding clothing, however, takes inspiration from the latter, with brightly colored hair, Sailor Moon skirts, colorful barrettes, pulling influence from the anime, punk, and goth subcultures.\nF\nFairycore\nYear of origin: 2020\nDescription: The magical sister of cottagecore blended earthy, fantasy, and feminine styles. Think whimsical maxi skirts, corset tops, and ethereal crystal jewelry.\nFarmer’s Daughter\nYear of origin: 2022\nDescription: A direct result of the Pearl movie, this style romanticized a vintage, country coquette aesthetic. Think cowboy boots, overalls, picnic baskets, braided pigtails, and lace bloomers.\n\"Fancy Nancy\" Core\nYear of Origin: 2024\nDescription: Fans of the beloved childhood character grew up to take the original maximalist girl’s style to a new level. Think layering, crazy tights, tutus, costume jewelry, hats, funky shoes, crazy patterns, and endless accessories.\nFisherman Aesthetic\nYear of Origin: 2025\nDescription: A cousin of coastal grandma, the fisherman aesthetic encourages adopters to dress like a fisherman on the New England coast with a mix of cable knit sweaters, breton stripes, boat shoes, netted accessories, and, of course, fisherman sandals.\nFrazzled English Woman\nYear of Origin: 2023\nDescription: Helena Bonham Carter and Bridget Jones are the queens of this quirky, early 2000s style. Think random scarves, stripes, layering, mismatched patterns, and, when more elevated, Vivienne Westwood.\nG\nGirlhood Aesthetic\nYear of Origin: 2023\nDescription: The girlhood aesthetic is the pink-washed embodiment of all things sweet and innocent—essentially combining all the stereotypical interests of a six-year-old girl. Think: bows, ruffles, flowers, tulle, headbands, and ballet flats.\nGoblincore\nYear of origin: 2020\nDescription: Goblincore adds a grungy edge to the fantasy elements of fairycore and cottagecore. It involves a lot of patched corduroy pants, oversized knit sweaters, and Dr. Martens—all in dark, earthy colors.\nGorpcore\nYear of origin: 2017\nDescription: This fashion trend combines functional outdoor gear with street style. Take your Gore-tex rain jacket, Solomons, cargo pants, and Patagonia backpack out of the garage—they’re stylish now.\nGrandmillennial\nYear of Origin: 2019\nDescription: Imagine dressing like your grandmother’s house with upholstery-like fabrics, antique-inspired jewelry, and furniture-like details like fringe, toile, and crochet. It was a manner of dress popular particularly among millennials.\nH\nHot Cheeto Girl\nYear of origin: 2019\nDescription: This baddie aesthetic was born of high school girls who wore long acrylic nails, false eyelashes, large hoop earrings, ripped skinny jeans, and sneakers.\nHot Girl Summer\nYear of Origin: 2019\nDescription: Hot Girl Summer is a cultural phenomenon named after the Megan Thee Stallion song and album, encouraging women to be confident, carefree, and single during the summer months. Clothes? What clothes? The fewer, the better.\nI\nIndie\nYear of origin: 2020\nDescription: This hyper-saturated TikTok trend brought an influx of ‘90s and y2k inspired fashions, such as baggy jeans, crop tops, bucket hats, and butterfly clips. The irony is that the fashion and artists associated with the Indie aesthetic (Clairo, Wallows) were already mainstream.\nIndie Sleaze\nYear of origin: 2021\nDescription: 2010s Tumblr returned in full force a few years ago, with everyone wearing ripped tights, grungy makeup, and thrifted, eclectic looks to rival Effy Stone and Sky Ferreira.\nM\nMcBling\nYear of Origin: 2019\nDescription: This subset of y2k was pioneered by Paris Hilton and experienced a resurgence toward 2019. Think endless sequins, bedazzled everything, hot pink tank tops, and skirts the size of a belt.\nMenocore\nYear of Origin: 2017\nDescription: Another term coined by ManRepeller’s Harling Ross, menocore was a precursor to coastal grandmother. It essentially encapsulates the act of dressing like a middle-aged woman on a beach vacation.\nMermaidcore\nYear of Origin: 2023\nDescription: All things aquatic were all the rage following the 2023 The Little Mermaid remake and this encapsulates that. Think: iridescent shell and pearl jewelry, floating light blue dresses, and shimmering makeup looks.\nMob Wife\nYear of origin: 2024\nDescription: This visually quite loud aesthetic glamorizes the confident, powerful women of mafia families—watch The Sopranos for inspo. Its iconic pieces are fur coats, flashy jewelry, sunglasses, tight dresses, and dark colors.\nN\nNormcore\nYear of Origin: 2010s\nDescription: One of the first microtrends of this “core” era we’re in, Normcore was essentially about dressing normally. It was the Jerry Seinfeld look; simple T-shirts, dad-style jeans, and New Balances.\nO\nOld Money\nYear of origin: 2023\nDescription: If you attended cotillion or boarding school, belonged to a country club, rode horses recreationally, benefited from legacy admissions to an Ivy League school, or if your name is followed by “the third,” there’s a good chance you might just have a claim to the old money aesthetic. This timeless style leans preppy in the most classic sense—forgoing flashy accessories while still looking filthy rich.\nP\nPrairie Girl\nYear of Origin: 2019\nDescription: Little House on the Prairie and Gunne Sax brought the 1870s to 1970s fashion, popularizing flowing floral cotton dresses adorned with lace-up fronts and billowing sleeves. This trend was revived yet again in 2019 through strange means: the fashion of Little Women (2019) and Kim Kardashian’s random milkmaid photoshoot.\nS\nSardine Girl\nYear of origin: 2025\nDescription: The fisherman aesthetic quickly devolved into just a fish aesthetic. Glittery, colorful designs based on sardine tins and the fish themselves have taken over this summer.\nShoppy Shop\nYear of origin: 2022\nDescription: Think of those fancy grocery stores that feel like an IRL version of your Instagram feed. They often carry tinned fish, swanky olive oil, and the latest prebiotic soda.\nSouthern Gothic\nYear of Origin: 2023\nDescription: This ghostly version of Farmer's Daughter brings to mind the image of a girl running through a corn field at midnight, wearing only her tattered vintage nightgown and crucifix. This nostalgic, spooky, and rural style was pioneered by Ethel Cain.\nStealth Wealth/Quiet Luxury\nYear of Origin: 2023\nDescription: This distilled version of minimalism emphasizes understated wealth, timeless pieces, and high-quality materials. Think classic silhouettes and neutral color palettes rather than flashy designer brand logos.\nStick of Butter Dressing\nYear of Origin: 2023\nDescription: What we now think of as the explosive butter yellow color trend originally started as “stick of butter” dressing. Writer Harling Ross coined the term in her ManRepeller days and it means to dress head-to-toe in neutral shades of yellow and beige.\nT\nTenniscore\nYear of Origin: 2024\nDescription: Reaching its apex with Luca Guadagnino’s Challengers, Tenniscore is perfectly preppy. Old Money’s sporty subtype features pleated skirts, cashmere sweaters, bright white sneakers, and striped navy polos.\nTradwife\nYear of Origin: 2020\nDescription: Tradwife is short for traditional wife and encompasses a movement of women embracing more traditional domestic gender roles. The corresponding fashion involves soft, feminine, conservative silhouettes. Mormon homesteading influencers Nara Smith and Ballerina Farm popularized this lifestyle trend.\nTomato Girl Summer\nYear of Origin: 2023\nDescription: Starting as a makeup trend, the tomato girl summer romanticized a mediterranean summer. Think flowing dresses, warm colors, linen, fruit prints, headscarves, and espadrilles.\nTwee\nYear of Origin: 2022\nDescription: Twee references the demurely feminine side of the hipster generation.

The video editing app VSCO became synonymous with scrunchies, messy buns, hydroflasks, oversized T-shirts, Birkenstocks, and reusable straws. We blame Emma Chamberlain.\nW\nWhimsigoth\nYear of origin: 2022\nDescription: Whimsigoth is a witchy, celestial aesthetic born of the many fantasy/gothic movies and shows from the ‘90s, like Practical Magic, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Charmed. Think ethereal velvet and lace dresses in deep jewel and earthy tones.\nY\nY2K Aesthetic\nYear of origin: 2020\nDescription: This microtrend is a distilled version of those popular in the late ‘90s and early 2000s. It’s become a sort of retro futuristic amalgamation of low slung jeans, flash “going out tops,” and baguette bags.\nYou Might Also Like",
