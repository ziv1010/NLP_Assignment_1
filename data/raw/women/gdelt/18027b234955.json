We don’t want the grease to transfer to equipment and then get grease on the cars behind them in the wash,” said Veronica Duran, Tommy’s Express Management Team at the Burley Overland Avenue site. They’ve been operating since April 2022.\nCURIOUS MIND: Civil protection orders are part of the public record\nQ: “If someone is under a protection order, will that show up on a background check for employment?”\nA: “If someone is currently under the protection of CPOR (Civil Protection Order) that information will show up on a driver’s license check or criminal history check whether they are the petitioner (person who sought the protection order) or the respondent (subject of the protection order),” Twin Falls County Sheriff’s Sgt. Ken Mencl.\nCURIOUS MIND: Collections\nCURIOUS MIND: Is the town pronounced Shoshone or Shoshoni?\nQ: “Is the town pronounced Shoshone or like Shoshoni?”\nA: “Shoshone” is the nation. “Shoshoni” refers to the people and the language. Just as “America” is the nation and “Americans” are the people.\nThe film and production crew for “Newe, The Shoshone People,” shot scenes the weekend of Feb. 2-4 in Ruby Valley, Spring Creek and Elko.\nCURIOUS MIND: Rights of way maintained by property owner\nQ: Who is responsible for mowing or burning the weeds in a right of way?\nA: “In Twin Falls County we have highway districts that maintain a certain amount of right of way on roadsides,” said Kali Sherrill, superintendent of Twin Falls County Noxious Weed Control. “However, property owners own to the middle of the road. The noxious weed law states that noxious weed control is the property owner’s responsibility. With that being said it definitely depends on where it is.”\nCURIOUS MIND: The US 93 right-of-way is too narrow for a snow fence\nQ: Gooding County had a project to build wind breaks on Idaho Highway 46. I've heard that farmers in Iowa are paid by the state to leave a few rows of corn next to highways for wind breaks. Has Twin Falls County considered doing anything like this for Highway 93 between Twin Falls and Hollister? The drifting snow can get pretty dangerous even with the snow plows running non-stop.\nA: “The Idaho Transportation Department uses various techniques along different stretches of highway to minimize drifting,” said Jesse Gwin, former spokesman for the Idaho Transportation Department.\nCURIOUS MIND: Addressing system in Twin Falls County enhances emergency response\nQ: How come Twin Falls County has such an unfriendly street numbering system? All I find are north and east streets, with north streets starting at the south end of the county near Jackpot, Nevada. Where are the west and south streets? I suppose whoever started the street number system is long dead, but county could rectify the situation. Maybe everything west of Blue Lakes Blvd. could be west and all south of Addison could be south?\nA: “Thank you for bringing up your concerns about the street numbering system in the city of Twin Falls and Twin Falls County,” said Matthew Long, a Twin Falls city building official. “It’s understandable that a seemingly one-sided orientation can be confusing for residents and visitors alike. While I don’t have specific information on the history of the street numbering system in Twin Falls County, it’s not uncommon for such systems to be established based on historical development patterns or other local considerations.\nCURIOUS MIND: It’s a meteor, it’s a UFO, it’s a… satellite.\nQ: I have seen a string of lights in the sky. What is it?\nA: “It is almost certainly a set of recently launched Starlink satellites,” said Chris Anderson, coordinator for the Centennial Observatory at the Herrett Center for Arts & Science at the College of Southern Idaho. “The easiest way to confirm this is by visiting www.heavens-above.com and entering your location. It will tell you when satellites were/will be visible from that location, including Starlink.”\nCURIOUS MIND: Burials near Salmon Dam relocated in Twin Falls cemetery\nQ: Where was the cemetery near Salmon Dam, and how many were buried before they were moved to Twin Falls?\nA: “Other than the two burials at Gray’s Landing, I do not know of a cemetery at Salmon Dam,” said Karen Quinton, local author and historian.\nCURIOUS MIND: Salmon once abundant in the Salmon River\nQ: Why is the Salmon River called that if there’s no salmon in it?\nA: “The river was named for the salmon found in it,” said Ashley Haycock, Twin Falls County Historical Society museum administrator.\nCURIOUS MIND: Exemptions permit firearms near school zones.\nQ: How was the Gem Prep school approved to build across from the Twin Falls Gun Club on Federation Road? I thought guns weren't allowed 1,000 feet from school property.\nA: “The reality is schools are located within 1,000 feet of firearms all the time,” said Josh Palmer, spokesman for the city of Twin Falls. “The law as it was passed under the ‘Gun Free Schools Act of 1990,’ excludes the possession of firearms on private property. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives also has a guide to the law which can be found at atf.gov, which again specifically excludes possession of firearms on private property that is not part of the school grounds. So businesses, homeowners, etc. can have guns even while being immediately next to a school.”\nCURIOUS MIND: For cheaper gas, take a drive to Buhl\nQ: Why is gas 35 cents cheaper on average in Buhl than it is in Twin Falls?\nA: “Fuel prices are always highly volatile, competitive and fluctuate geographically based on supply and demand,” said Troy Willie, with Oasis Stop ‘N Go. “Metro areas can vary from rural areas based on this demand and competitive factors.”\nCURIOUS MIND: How did Carey get its name?\nQ: How did Carey get its name?\nA: “The first post office was operated by James Carey, one of the earliest valley settlers. It came to be known as the Carey Post Office by locals and government officials alike. As a result, as it grew, the town came to be called Carey,” according to the city of Carey’s website.\nCURIOUS MIND: It’s the law — ‘Don’t speed up’\nQ: On Highway 93, is it illegal for a driver to speed up at a passing lane, or just idiotic?\nA: The Idaho Driver’s Handbook states “Don’t speed up. Maintain a steady speed or slow down.” When another driver is passing, you must yield the right-of-way if they sound their horn. You cannot speed up until they finish passing.\nCURIOUS MIND: More mental health help is on the way\nQ: One of my adult children is mentally ill. In Idaho they can only go to ER. Is there any way to get them help?\nCURIOUS MIND: Cedar Draw Park is closed indefinitely: ‘A crying shame’\nQ: Could you look into why the Filer Rest Area is closed, and has been since COVID-19? And if Filer isn’t going to upkeep it anymore, can they get someone who can?\nCURIOUS MIND: The rules for dispersed camping on public lands\nQ: The cost of housing is rising and RV parks are filling up. Is squatting on BLM land legal?\nA: “Squatting by its very definition is unlawful,” said Heather Tiel-Nelson, public affairs specialist for the Bureau of Land Management in the Twin Falls District. “Recognizing the nature of the question, it might be helpful to share information about dispersed camping.”\nCURIOUS MIND: E-bikes have same rights as regular bikes.\nQ: Can electric bikes legally drive on city streets?\nA: “I am not as well versed on this subject as I used to be, but I will tell you that ‘electric bikes’ are generally afforded the same rights as regular bikes,” said Sgt. Ryan Howe of the Twin Falls Police Department. “What your definition of an electric bike is may change that general answer. ITD put out a fact sheet several years ago.”\nCURIOUS MIND: Quagga mussels are edible but ...\nQ: Are zebra and quagga mussels edible?\nA: “Yes, but they are not recommended to be eaten. These mussels accumulate toxins as they filter water. These toxins can be harmful to humans, dogs, and birds,” reported the Okanagan and Similkameen Invasive Species Society’s Invasive Mussels Factsheet, which was recommended by the Idaho State Department of Agriculture.\nCURIOUS MIND: Artisan Labs doesn't sell direct to consumers\nQ: Does Artisan Labs sell cosmetics, or is it a testing facility?\nA: “We do not make products to be sold by Artisan Labs directly to consumers,” said Mary Searle, communications specialist for Artisan Labs, located at 290 Highway 30 in Hansen. “We service cosmetic and personal care brands directly who sell to their customers. We develop the formulas specific to each brand.”\nCURIOUS MIND: How Roseworth, near Buhl, got its name\nQ: Who is Roseworth named after?\nA: According to “Idaho Place Names: A Geographical Dictionary” by Lalia Boone, Roseworth (founded in the 1890s) was named for a local resident, but offers no additional information.\nCURIOUS MIND: Goodbye, Singing Bridge. Hello, Old Towne Bridge\nQ: When was the Singing Bridge replaced, and why?\nA: Built in 1920, the bridge was located south of Twin Falls on Shoshone Street crossing Rock Creek Canyon. The Singing Bridge got its name because when vehicles drove over it, it sang due to the metal decking.\nOUR VIEW: What we experienced in the waning days of September will be the norm — and sooner, not later — without a third bridge spanning the Snake River Canyon.\nCURIOUS MIND: The end of Sheriff’s Mounted Posses in Magic Valley\nQ: What happened to the area’s sheriff’s mounted posses?\nA: “My dad was part of the Twin Falls County Sheriff’s Mounted Posse in the late ’60s, early ’70s,” said Daron Brown, lieutenant for the Twin Falls County Sheriff. “The leader of the organization’s name was Dallas Mcquire. When he became elderly and couldn’t do it anymore, nobody else really wanted to take over and left the group, so it faded out.”\nCURIOUS MIND: The road is slightly angled, not the buildings\nQ: My curious mind wonders why most of the buildings on West Addison Avenue are turned slightly in relation to the street. West Addison Avenue seems to run true east-west, but several of the buildings on the south side lie west-southwest.\nA: “The city has no official information on this question,” said Jonathan Spendlove, Twin Falls planning and zoning director.\nCURIOUS MIND: How to drive safely around farm vehicles\nQ: I watched a near-accident when an SUV drove to the right of a tractor when it was taking a wide turn. What are guidelines for driving safely around farm vehicles?\nA: “It is important that farmers and ranchers follow the law for safe driving of tractors and farm implements on the road,” said Sgt. Ken Mencl with the Twin Falls Sheriff’s Office.\nCURIOUS MIND: Is that another entertainment venue near Twin Falls?\nQ: There is a new arena or venue north of Hollister. What is it?\nA: “It’s a rodeo riding arena,” said Malena Juarez, owner of Arena 93.\nCURIOUS MIND: Moose Lodge in Buhl was sold, merged with Twin Falls\nQ: What happened to the Moose Lodge in Buhl?\nA: “I do not have details but can verify the Buhl Lodge 305 closed Nov. 1, 2018. All members were merged into the Twin Falls Lodge 612,” said Dawn Bower, Moose International Member Services.\nCURIOUS MIND: Preferred seating gets closer to the action\nQ: What’s the preferred seating at the Magic Valley Stampede? It looks like new front-row seats on the floor of the main grandstand.\nA: “The preferred seating at the rodeo was new in 2022,” said Nancy Pitz, marketing assistant for Twin Falls County Fair. “This section is in front of the grandstand, right below the box seats. There is a raised platform set directly on the arena floor with a fence rail in front. There are 20 tables with four chairs each. We like to promote them as the seats where you get dirty in your drink…can’t get any closer to the action.”\nCURIOUS MIND: School gym closed due to flooding\nQ: Why did the Castleford gym flood when it rained? Roof or front door?\nA: “The gym flooded because the ground was already saturated with rainstorms and we had a downpour of rain in early May,” said Dena Allred, superintendent of Castleford schools. “After school, we did not have any flooding as we had janitors here cleaning. However, our drainage systems from the back parking lot, the concrete playground area, and the rain from the roofs did not work and were overwhelmed, or so we thought. The water came into the two main doors into the foyer and flooded the weight room, music/drama room, concession stand, the foyer, and part of the gym floor. This happened after the janitorial staff had finished cleaning and left. We found it that night because our track team had a meet at Raft River and when they arrived back at Castleford around 11 p.m., the area was flooded and we had standing, dirty water in the areas described.”\nCURIOUS MIND: Lincoln County Fair began in Hagerman, way back in 1910\nQ: When was the first year for the Lincoln County Fair & Rodeo?\nA: According to Chronicling America and the North Side News on Aug. 28, 1913, the first Lincoln County Fair was held in Hagerman in 1910. The second in Wendell in 1911, the third in Shoshone in 1912. In 1913, it was held in Jerome. Gooding, Minidoka, and Jerome Counties used to be part of Lincoln County.\nOUR VIEW: There are few things more American than rounding up the family, gathering with friends and meeting your neighbors at the fairgrounds every summer.\nNew high school is a tall tale\nQ: I heard Twin Falls is planning to build another high school. It was going to be built near the water tower south of Twin Falls. When?\nA: “No, the Twin Falls School District does not have plans to build a new high school in the near future,” Eva Craner, spokesperson for Twin Falls School District, said.\nCURIOUS MIND: Here’s how Oakley Vigilantes got their name\nQ: How did the Oakley Vigilantes get their name?\nA: “Becoming the Legacy” since 1882, the Oakley Vigilantes continues to host the Oakley Pioneer Days celebration, which takes place this year from July 14 through July 22. The nine-day celebration is filled with fun activities and events for the whole family, from car races and rodeos to Dutch oven cookoff/chuckwagon breakfast and sport tournaments.\nThe rules of the road for motor vehicles passing on the right\nQ: On Poleline Road traveling west, drivers that reside on the south side are driving in the passing lane backing up traffic. What’s the protocol?\nA: The answer can be found in Idaho Statute 49-633, Twin Falls County Sheriff’s Sgt. Ken Mencl said.\nNo roadkill service in the Magic Valley\nQ: Is there a roadkill removal service?\nA: “For wildlife that have been killed on the roadside, either the county highway department or the Idaho Department of Fish and Game are authorized to remove the carcass,” said Dr. Scott Leibsle, state veterinarian with the Idaho State Department of Agriculture. “For anything other than wildlife (dogs, cats, livestock), the county highway department would be responsible.”\nWindow tinting is regulated but not certified\nQ: Many drivers have dark window tinting, which makes it difficult to communicate if I can’t see them. What’s the regulation on window tinting?\nA: “To my understanding, their question can be directed under Idaho Legislation Title 49 Chapter 9,” said Amy Agenbroad, spokesperson for the Idaho State Police.\nExpanding to three lanes on the interstate indicates growth in Twin Falls and Jerome counties\nQ: What are they doing in the median between Twin Falls and Jerome?\nA: “The Idaho Transportation Department is widening I-84 between South Jerome Interchange (Exit 168) and Twin Falls Interchange (Exit 173),” said Anne Marie Peacock, spokesperson for the Idaho Transportation Department. “I-84 serves as a major corridor through South-Central Idaho and beyond, with traffic counts expected to increase substantially over the next 20 years. The purpose of this project is to increase capacity and improve safety on I-84. This project is part of Idaho Governor Brad Little’s ‘Leading Idaho’ transportation funding solution.”\nCook, Robert\nRobert Sylvester Cook\nNov. 18, 1932 ~ May 7, 2023\nDriving over manholes doesn’t make for smooth sailing\nQ: Why are the sewer manholes in the tire tracks instead of in the middle of the road?\nA: “Great question! I agree, it is disappointing when a sewer manhole lands in a wheel path because it happens from time to time,” said Joshua Baird, public works director for the city of Twin Falls. “There are several things that are at play that don’t allow for an optimal sewer manhole placement from time to time. First, parcels of land come in varying shapes and sizes, so when development occurs, it may not be feasible to avoid a manhole in a wheel path because of the constraints imposed by the shape, size, and contours of the property as well as right-of-way requirement and building setbacks.”\nWhy do road construction crews block off 8 miles of Interstate 84 near Burley but only work on a small section?\nQ: Why do road construction crews block off 8 miles of Interstate 84 near Burley but only work on a small section?\nA: “Safety and cost determine the size of construction zones,” Idaho Transportation Department spokesperson Anne Marie Peacock told the Times-News.\nNot all schools are created equal when it comes to track.

According to Franklin Building Supply’s website, he purchased building materials for the ramp from Volco Inc., and gives Volco his tombstone as collateral for credit charges made.\nCURIOUS MIND: If 'Idaho is too great to litter' then why are the medians on the interstate full of trash?\nQ: Idaho is too great to litter. If “Idaho is too great to litter” then why are the medians on the interstate full of trash?\nA: “We can all see the trash this winter season has left behind on our roads now that the snow has melted,” said Anne Marie Peacock, spokesperson for the Idaho Transportation Department. “The Idaho Transportation Department relies on volunteers through the Adopt-A-Highway program to help pick up trash along our roads as we do not have dedicated resources for it. Unfortunately, it is not always possible for volunteers to safely access medians to pick up trash; and therefore, is left there. ITD actually asks volunteers to avoid working in medians for their safety as well as narrow roadways, curves, bridges, overpasses, and on/off ramps. We ensure volunteers work in areas where they are easily visible to motorists and oncoming traffic.”\nCURIOUS MIND: Coyote was the original name of the Twin Falls High School annual\nQ: Is pull-through parking legal? I’ve noticed a lot of drivers are either backing or driving through into parking spaces. Is this even legal? I’ve backed into a vehicle because the hood was below my rear-view window.\nA: “AAA recommends that drivers back into parking spaces whenever possible, except where prohibited by law or parking lot restrictions,” said Matthew Conde, public and government affairs director for Triple A Idaho. “When you back into a parking space, you back into a designated area that you know is empty. But when you back out into the flow of parking lot traffic, reduced visibility can result in increased risk of a collision involving cross-traffic and pedestrians.\nCURIOUS MIND: Coyote was the original name of the Twin Falls High School annual\nQ: I was looking at my family tree on Ancestry.com and my aunt went to Twin Falls High School in 1927. She was a Coyote, not a Bruin. When did TFHS change the mascot?\nA: “Here at the Twin Falls School District Office, we have an archive of old yearbooks and I was able to find the answer,” said Eva Craner, Twin Falls School District public relations director. “The short answer is that since 1920, TFHS has utilized The Bruin as its mascot but The Coyote was the school’s name for the yearbook until 1965.”\nCURIOUS MIND: How to get assistance for the elderly\nQ: Where, or who, does the elderly turn to when they need help moving furniture or yard work? Transportation and food banks are available. But what if the washing machine or car needs repairs or replaced? Who assists the elderly?\nA: “IVC’s abilities are limited to transportation and home safety modifications — grabs bars, handrails, and wheelchair ramps,” said Jeanette Roe, executive director for Interlink Volunteer Caregivers. “We run our services only with volunteers. Most of our volunteers are seniors themselves. Our volunteer insurance does allow any weight bearing assistance.”\nCURIOUS MIND: Will the judicial building be expanded?\nQ: All the roses at the courthouse were pulled out last year. Still looks like a mess. Thought they were going to add on. Where does it stand?\nA: “We hope to have a groundbreaking ceremony in June,” said Brent Reinke, Twin Falls County commissioner. “We have experienced numerous unexpected delays. To be honest the delays may prove to be a good thing with the market improving with materials and labor availabilities.”\nCURIOUS MIND: Plans to convert old clinic into residential units\nQ: Who is responsible for the old Twin Falls clinic building on Shoshone St. and what is the fate of the building? After firefighters had to respond there last year due to squatters setting fires in the basement, it doesn’t feel safe to live nearby.\nA: “Previously the property owners did not have the building fenced and secured so transients often entered the building,” said Josh Palmer, Public Information Director for the city of Twin Falls.\nCURIOUS MIND: Is the town pronounced Shoshone or Shoshoni?\nQ: “Is the town pronounced Shoshone or like Shoshoni?”\nA: “Shoshone” is the nation. “Shoshoni” refers to the people and the language. Just as “America” is the nation and “Americans” are the people.\nThe film and production crew for “Newe, The Shoshone People,” shot scenes the weekend of Feb. 2-4 in Ruby Valley, Spring Creek and Elko.\nCURIOUS MIND: Rights of way maintained by property owner\nQ: Who is responsible for mowing or burning the weeds in a right of way?\nA: “In Twin Falls County we have highway districts that maintain a certain amount of right of way on roadsides,” said Kali Sherrill, superintendent of Twin Falls County Noxious Weed Control. “However, property owners own to the middle of the road. The noxious weed law states that noxious weed control is the property owner’s responsibility. With that being said it definitely depends on where it is.”\nCURIOUS MIND: The US 93 right-of-way is too narrow for a snow fence\nQ: Gooding County had a project to build wind breaks on Idaho Highway 46.

While I don’t have specific information on the history of the street numbering system in Twin Falls County, it’s not uncommon for such systems to be established based on historical development patterns or other local considerations.\nCURIOUS MIND: It’s a meteor, it’s a UFO, it’s a… satellite.\nQ: I have seen a string of lights in the sky. What is it?\nA: “It is almost certainly a set of recently launched Starlink satellites,” said Chris Anderson, coordinator for the Centennial Observatory at the Herrett Center for Arts & Science at the College of Southern Idaho. “The easiest way to confirm this is by visiting www.heavens-above.com and entering your location. It will tell you when satellites were/will be visible from that location, including Starlink.”\nCURIOUS MIND: Burials near Salmon Dam relocated in Twin Falls cemetery\nQ: Where was the cemetery near Salmon Dam, and how many were buried before they were moved to Twin Falls?\nA: “Other than the two burials at Gray’s Landing, I do not know of a cemetery at Salmon Dam,” said Karen Quinton, local author and historian.\nCURIOUS MIND: Salmon once abundant in the Salmon River\nQ: Why is the Salmon River called that if there’s no salmon in it?\nA: “The river was named for the salmon found in it,” said Ashley Haycock, Twin Falls County Historical Society museum administrator.\nCURIOUS MIND: Exemptions permit firearms near school zones.\nQ: How was the Gem Prep school approved to build across from the Twin Falls Gun Club on Federation Road?
