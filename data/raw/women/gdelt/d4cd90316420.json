  "body_text": "Pie Herring, Snoop.\nLONDON.- Artist Pie Herring is exhibiting a new series of paintings in a solo exhibition “I Am Because We Are: Paintings from a Ghanaian Residency” with Arms Around the Child co-curated by Lee Sharrock at CasildArt Contemporary in London from 28th February to 8th March 2025. The exhibition is curated by co-founder of AATC Art Residency Jason Colchin-Carter.\nPie Herring produced 20 paintings and a limited edition print of the main Exhibition painting ’Senya’ during an artist residency at the newly opened Arms Around the Child ‘Christian Atsu Educational Centre’ in Senya Beraku, Ghana in 2023-2024. This series showcases a kaleidoscope of multi-figured paintings seeped in colourful activity, as well as a collection of intimate portraits fusing classical methods with contemporary flair.\nHerring’s work is a celebration of the cultural richness that shaped her experience of painting along Ghana’s coast. On display is an array of bustling fishing scenes, lively markets, and women adorned in traditional attire. Through radiant hues and layered compositions, she immerses viewers in the rhythm, energy, and stories of the people she encountered in Senya Beraku.\n“Experiencing a new landscape steeped in heritage and culture has had a profound impact on my work. With this collection, I hope to share the vitality and spirit of this extraordinary community with a broader audience.” Pie Herring\nThe “I Am Because We Are” collection reveals a series of figurative paintings created by Herring during her artist residency with Arms Around the Child, a charity dedicated to providing safe homes, education, and support for children in need across the globe. The AATC artist residency offered Herring a unique opportunity to travel to Ghana, where she immersed herself in the charity’s mission and explored the country’s energetic culture, rooted in tradition and full of personality. She was also given the chance to engage with the country’s thriving and emerging global art scene, which deeply influenced her creative process.\nGhana Students.\nThe exhibition’s title “I am Because We Are” emphasises the concept of mutual responsibility and care within the communities which are at the heart of Arms Around the Child’s work. It emphasises the importance of supporting and uplifting one another, recognising that the flourishing of each individual contributes to the overall well-being of the community. This philosophy highlights the idea that individual identity is not isolated but rather emerges within the context of communal life. One’s sense of self is inseparable from the collective identity of the community, shaped by shared experiences, values, and cultural heritage.\nPie Herring, a celebrated name in contemporary figurative painting, is renowned for her ability to capture the dynamism of human experience and culture through her expressive brushwork and charismatic narratives. Her work explores themes of identity, community and human connection and is deeply influenced by her travels and residencies across the world. Her work has been exhibited with galleries internationally including New York, London, Nairobi, Marrakech and Mombasa.\nGhana’s contemporary art scene has surged in recent years, emerging as a dynamic force within the global art landscape. During her residency Herring spent time exploring Accra’s contemporary art spaces and scenes. She was heavily inspired by the bold use of colour, intricate patterns and powerful cultural storytelling she observed. This influence is no more evident than within Herring’s painting “Senya”.\nThe exhibition will include an invitation-only reception on 7th March, where visitors can meet the artist and explore the inspirations behind her work. Herring will also be present throughout the duration of the exhibition to host tours and discussions about the collection.\nPie Herring, Senya.\n“I Am Because We Are: Paintings from a Ghanaian Residency” is a celebration of connection, community, and cultural exchange. Visit CasildArt Gallery at 32 Connaught Street, London W2 2AF, to experience this unique and powerful collection.\nThe AATC Residency\nRecent events have seen Ghana’s influence on the art world continue to advance with this year’s U.K. Pavilion at the Venice Biennale showcasing a British/Ghanaian artist John Akron RA. The AATC residency programme is dedicated to furthering the promotion and support of Ghana’s art scene by creating a bridge whereby local and international artists can meet to share ideas and gain influence. In addition to supplying access to schooling, art and materials in rural areas of the country.\nThe AATC art residency launched as a tribute to the late Ghanaian footballer Christian Atsu who passed away in the devastating earthquake in Turkey/Syria Feb 2023. Christian was the charity’s main ambassador. With Christian’s support and additional fundraising AATC built school which hosts a bespoke artist studio for the purposes of its residency programme.\nAATC has been holding fundraising auctions for a decade, previously in New York with Sotheby’s auctioning one-of-a-kind teddy bears styled & signed by celebrities and opinion leaders from around the world; to the most recent event in November 2022 where art was auctioned in Christie’s London main sales room for emerging and established artists. In addition to this, the residency programme has the support and recognition from the FA’s Football Premier League, with both the Everton and Chelsea team previously helping to raise extraordinary funds by donating signed match-worn football kits.\nPie Herring, Two Boys.\nEllie Milner, Global Director, Arms Around The Child explains:“Pie Herring’s involvement in the AATC Art Residency has been extraordinary. Her passion, creativity, and deep commitment to connecting with Ghanaian culture have brought our vision for this residency to life most meaningfully. Pie’s art not only celebrates the vibrant traditions of Ghana but also shines a light on the children and communities we strive to support. Her work has enriched our mission, creating a bridge of understanding and compassion through creativity. This residency has grown into a vital platform for cultural exchange and advocacy, and Pie has been instrumental in its development, leaving a lasting impact on the charity and the communities we serve.”\nArtist Pie Herring says: “The AATC Art Residency has been a profoundly transformative experience for me. Immersing myself in Ghanaian culture—its vibrant traditions, art, and storytelling has not only inspired my work but also deepened my understanding of the resilience and beauty within these communities. Witnessing the incredible work Arms Around The Child does to support vulnerable children and families has been humbling and motivating. It’s a privilege to contribute to a project that bridges cultures and creates opportunities for artistic and human connection. This journey has left an indelible mark on my life and my art.”\nMore information on Pie Herring’s artist residency with Arms Around the Child can be found here: https://armsaroundthechild.org/pie-herring/\nPie Herring produced 20 paintings and a limited edition print of the main Exhibition painting ’Senya’ during an artist residency at the newly opened Arms Around the Child ‘Christian Atsu Educational Centre’ in Senya Beraku, Ghana in 2023-2024.
