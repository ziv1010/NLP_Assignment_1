Irene Paredes headed wide as Spain continued to dominate, culminating in Aitana Bonmatí making it 1-0 as she raced in to meet Olga Carmona's low centre.\nJust before half-time Laia Aleixandri came close after another Spain corner, and although France started the second period brightly it was soon 2-0 as Ona Batlle found Mariona Caldentey to strike home from inside the box. Peyraud-Magnin then had to be alert to smother Paralluelo's run.\nFrance still looked to test Spain and Élisa De Almeida volleyed wide. But they were not allowed a shot on target for the entire final as Spain confirmed their champion status.\nPlayer of the Match: Aitana Bonmatí (Spain)\nAlexandra Jonson, match reporter at La Cartuja de Sevilla\nThis Spain side just can't stop writing themselves into the history books – beating France for the first time ever to become the first Nations League champions. The result was never in doubt either, as from start to finish this was all Spain, with France restricted to a couple of half-chances.\nLa Roja dominated for pretty much all of the 90 minutes. France, like the Netherlands in the semi-finals, couldn't find an answer. There is a reason why Spain are viewed as the best in the world and they showed it once again tonight.\nPlayer of the Finals: Aitana Bonmatí (Spain)\nReaction\nMariona Caldentey, Spain goalscorer: \"We had never won against them before, but it’s been some time since we last played them, we have evolved a lot. We wanted to beat them and we have a lot of confidence in ourselves. Things are going well and we have to take advantage of the fact that this team doesn’t stop, and doesn’t want to stop. This gives us strength to continue on an individual level, at club level and at national team level. We want more, and the longer we can extend [this period of success] the better.\n\"Now we are going to enjoy this little by little. We know how difficult it is, because those who will be at the Olympics will have earned that qualification. It will be difficult, but we want to win every game and that’s what we aim for.\"\nJenni Hermoso, Spain forward: \"We work hard – there are a lot of training sessions. We also have to live up to being world champions. It sounds great, but it’s also a responsibility. The players know that we have to give our all in every game to defend this crest and our status as world champions. Today we once again got to celebrate, which I think we deserved.\n\"We were really happy with how many fans came for the semi-final and today it was even more. For us it’s a pleasure to be able to win trophies here in front of our fans, to feel their support and I think it goes further than that – this is proving that women's football is the future.\"\nMontse Tomé, Spain coach: \"We are all very happy for the performance that the girls have given on the pitch and all the coaching staff for all the work we’ve done in the last ten days, and since we started with this national team. From now on, the players have to celebrate, be happy and enjoy the work they’ve put in.\n\"We have a very good present and a very good future. These players have just won the World Cup, now this – and beaten France. It was an opponent we had never beaten before.\"\nHervé Renard, France coach: \"We didn’t play a good game against a team that are world champions and flying high in women’s football. You have to be aggressive and keep the ball when you get it, but we lost it again straight away.\n\"In the final 30 minutes we were a bit higher up the pitch and tried to apply more pressure, but it was tricky when these players are on the ball – they commit very few technical errors. The technical level is exceptional. When I coached Morocco, we were lucky enough to play Spain at the 2018 World Cup with their midfield of Iniesta, Isco and Busquets. Today I had the impression I was seeing the same thing.\"\nGrace Geyoro, France midfielder: \"They played to their strengths and we didn’t play as well as we should have. We didn’t manage to win any duels but that's because they put pressure on us.\"\nKey stats\n- Spain had never featured in a senior women's international final before August's World Cup, which they also won.\n- Spain beat France for the first time in their 14 meetings (having previously lost ten and drawn three).\n- France were in their first senior women's international final.\n- Cata Coll, Ona Batlle, Irene Paredes, Laia Codina, Olga Carmona, Aitana Bonmatí, Jenni Hermoso, Salma Paralleulo and Mariona Caldentey also started Spain's World Cup final win against England in August, while Oihane Hernández came off the bench in that match too.\n- Amandine Henry won her 100th France cap.\n- Vicky López came off the bench having in the semi-final become Spain's youngest-ever senior international.\n- The 32,657 crowd is a record for a Spain home women's international, breaking the record set in Friday's semi-final, also at La Cartuja de Sevilla.\nLine-ups\nSpain: Cata Coll; Batlle, Paredes, Codina, Olga (Oihane 68); Bonmatí, Aleixandri, Hermoso (Vicky López 85); Athenea (Eva Navarro 72), Paralluelo, Caldentey\nFrance: Peyraud-Magnin; De Almeida, Lakrar, Mbock Bathy, Karchaoui; Henry (Dali 58), Geyoro; Diani (Dufour 76), Le Sommer, Bacha (Majri 76); Katoto (D Cascarino 58)\nThird-place match: Germany earn Olympic berth\nKlara Bühl and Lea Schüller struck second-half goals to give Germany victory in Heerenveen and, with it, the bronze medal and Europe's third berth in the Olympic women's football tournament alongside Spain and hosts France. Germany previously won gold in 2016 (but did not qualify to defend the title in 2021) and also took bronze in 2000, 2004 and 2008.\nAlso qualified so far are defending champions Canada, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Japan, New Zealand and four-time winners the United States, with two teams from Africa to be decided in April.\nMatches will be played in Bordeaux, Décines, Marseille, Nantes, Nice, Paris (with the final at Parc des Princes) and Saint-Étienne.",
