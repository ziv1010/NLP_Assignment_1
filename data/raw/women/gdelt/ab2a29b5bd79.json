  "body_text": "Here’s a breakdown of the four teams comprising each Groups A and B in the Women’s World Cup, which starts at midnight PT Thursday.\nGROUP A\nNEW ZEALAND\nPrevious World Cup appearances: 5\nWorld Cup record: 0-12-3\nBest finish: Group Stage in 1991, 2007, ’11, ’15 and ’19\nCoach: Jitka Klimkova\nKey players: Hannah Wilkinson, Ali Riley, Gabi Rennie\nWhat to know: New Zealand has yet to break through in World Cup play. The Football Ferns have never won a World Cup match or reached the knockout stage despite appearing in five previous editions. This year’s co-hosts have history and a home crowd behind them as they try to record their first win, celebrating 50 years of women’s soccer in New Zealand. Longtime national team members Ali Riley and Hannah Wilkinson headline the roster with more than 200 appearances between them. Wilkinson ranks fourth in all-time goals for the Ferns. Gabi Rennie’s goal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, on her first career touch at the senior international level, showed some promise but the squad lacks firepower overall. In its last 16 international matches, New Zealand has won only twice. New Zealand stands 1-5 all-time against Norway, 1-0 against the Philippines and has never faced Switzerland.\nNORWAY\nPrevious World Cup appearances: 8\nWorld Cup record: 24-12-4\nBest finish: Champion in 1995\nCoach: Hege Riise\nKey players: Ada Hegerberg, Maren Mjelde, Guro Reiten\nWhat to know: Striker Ada Hegerberg missed the 2019 World Cup because of a five-year hiatus from Norway’s national team in protest of unequal conditions and treatment. Hegerberg, who won the Ballon d’Or in 2018, has 43 goals in 76 international appearances. Maren Mjelde is fourth in all-time appearances with 163 international matches. Since winning the World Cup title in 1995, Norway hasn’t finished higher than fourth place. Norway’s quarterfinal berth in 2019 was the team’s best result since a fourth-place finish in 2007. Norway is 5-1-1 all-time against host nation New Zealand, with the only loss occurring in a 2019 friendly. Norway has never played the Philippines.\nPHILIPPINES\nPrevious World Cup appearances: 0\nWorld Cup record: 0-0\nBest finish: N/A\nCoach: Alen Stajcic\nKey players: Sarina Bolden, Hali Long, Quinley Quezada\nWhat to know: The Philippines beat Taiwan in a penalty shootout in the 2022 Women’s Asian Cup quarterfinals to clinch a spot in this year’s World Cup. Sarina Bolden scored the winning penalty. It’s the first time that a team from the Philippines, either women’s or men’s, has qualified for a World Cup. Bolden and Quinley Quezada are tied for most international goals scored, with 22 each. The Philippines played New Zealand once, in a 2022 friendly, and lost 2-1. The team has never played Norway or Switzerland. The Philippines dropped the moniker Malditas in 2022 and adopted the nickname Filipinas. Stajcic is a former head coach of the Australian women’s team.\nSWITZERLAND\nPrevious World Cup appearances: 1\nWorld Cup record: 1-3-0\nBest finish: Round of 16 in 2015\nCoach: Inka Grings\nKey players: Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic, Ramona Bachmann, Lia Walti\nWhat to know: The team was struck a blow in May when midfielder Lia Walti, set to be captain for the World Cup, injured her ankle while playing for Arsenal in the Women’s Super League. But she could be back in time to help Switzerland. Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic is the team’s top scorer, with eight goals so far this year. Coach Inka Grings was appointed in November and officially took over in January. In Switzerland’s first match of the 2015 Women’s World Cup, both Ramona Bachmann and Fabienne Humm scored hat tricks, leading their team to a 10-1 victory over Ecuador. It was enough to get the Swiss to the second round, where they lost 1-0 to host Canada.\nGROUP B\nAUSTRALIA\nPrevious World Cup appearances: 7\nWorld Cup record: 7-13-6\nBest finish: Quarterfinals in 2007, ’11 and ’15\nCoach: Tony Gustavsson\nKey players: Sam Kerr, Clare Polkinghorne, Emily van Egmond\nWhat to know: In February, the Matildas went undefeated in the Cup of Nations, beating Jamaica, Spain and the Czech Republic. In April, they ended England’s 30-game unbeaten streak with a 2-0 win. The Matildas hired Gustavsson as head coach in 2020 after his tenure as an assistant for the U.S. women’s national team, during which time he helped lead the team to two World Cup titles. Forward Sam Kerr, team captain since 2019, is Australia’s all-time leading international scorer with 63 goals in 120 appearances. Australia is 7-8-3 against Canada. The Matildas have played Nigeria and Ireland once each, beating Nigeria 2-0 in 2015 and losing to Ireland 3-2 in a 2021 friendly.\nIRELAND\nPrevious World Cup appearances: 0\nWorld Cup record: 0-0\nBest finish: N/A\nCoach: Vera Pauw\nKey players: Louise Quinn, Denise O’Sullivan, Katie McCabe\nWhat to know: Ireland is making its World Cup debut after finishing second in its qualifying group and then defeating Scotland 1-0 in a playoff in Glasgow last October. Katie McCabe led all players in Ireland’s qualifying group with seven goals, while midfielder Denise O’Sullivan was second with six. In April, Ireland lost two friendlies to the United States to end a record nine-game unbeaten run. Ireland beat fellow Group B member Australia 3-2 in an international friendly in Dublin in September 2021. Louise Quinn scored the game-winner in what was Ireland’s first-ever match against Australia. Ireland has also faced Canada only once in its history, losing 2-1 in 2014. Nigeria is the only team in Group B that Ireland has not played before.\nNIGERIA\nPrevious World Cup appearances: 8\nWorld Cup record: 4-19-3\nBest finish: Quarterfinals in 1999\nCoach: Randy Waldrum\nKey players: Ifeoma Onumonu, Onome Ebi, Asisat Oshoala, Chiamaka Nnadozie\nWhat to know: Nigeria is aiming to advance past the group stage for the third time, following the run to the quarterfinals in ’99 and the Round of 16 in 2019. The Super Falcons have been successful on the African continent, winning 11 of the 14 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations tournaments that have been contested. After losing seven consecutive games dating back to 2022, Nigeria has won three matches in a row including victories over Costa Rica, Haiti and New Zealand. Nigeria lost its only match against Australia, a 2-0 defeat in the 2015 World Cup. Nigeria has a record of 1-2-1 against Canada, with its lone victory coming at the 2011 World Cup.

Beckie recently made her 100th appearanace for Canada against Brazil at the SheBelieves Cup in February. Captain Christine Sinclair, who made her debut for Canada aged 16 in March 2000, is the all-time leading scorer in international soccer with 190 goals. Canada claimed its first Olympic gold medal at the Tokyo Games in 2021, beating Sweden in the final. Over the last few months, the team has been in dispute with Canada Soccer over issues of equal pay and budget cuts. The women’s national team reached an interim funding agreement, retroactive to last year, after threatening to boycott team activities at the SheBelieves Cup. The team ended up competing in the SheBelieves Cup, finishing with a victory over Brazil and losses to the United States and Japan. Overall, Canada is 8-7-3 against Australia. The Canadians have won the only match they’ve played against Ireland. Canada is 2-1-1 against Nigeria.",
