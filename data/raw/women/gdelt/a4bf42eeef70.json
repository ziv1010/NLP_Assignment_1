  "body_text": "Angel City Football Club continued a late-season roster makeover by transferring midfielder Katie Zelem and defender Alanna Kennedy to the London City Lionesses for an “undisclosed fee.”\nLondon City is a newly promoted club in the Women’s Super League and the only independent club to win promotion. The other 11 clubs are all affiliated with English Premier League teams.\nZelem, who came from Manchester United, joined Angel City midway through the 2024 season. Zelem made 25 appearances in her time with Angel City.\nKennedy joined Angel City ahead of this season, after spending the previous four at Manchester City. With Angel City, Kennedy made 16 appearances, adding a goal and an assist.\nLast week, Angel City traded forward Julie Dufour to the Portland Thorns for $40,000 in intra-league transfer funds and an international roster slot. Dufour signed with Angel City during the offseason from Paris FC. She made 10 appearances this season with Angel City.\nAfter the moves, Angel City now has a pair of open international roster slots and 24 players on its active roster.\nAngel City returns to action Monday against Bay FC at BMO Stadium.",
