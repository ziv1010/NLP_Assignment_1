  "body_text": "Extra precautions were put in place to protect Fulham's women's team from the club's late owner Mohamed Al Fayed, a former manager has said.\nGaute Haugenes, who managed the team from 2001 to 2003, told the BBC that members of staff were aware Fayed \"liked young, blonde girls\" and steps were taken to protect the players from the late billionaire.\nHe said: \"I read all the newspapers yesterday of course and to be honest it's not the biggest surprise.\n\"We were aware he liked young, blonde girls. So we just made sure that situations couldn't occur. We protected the players.\"\nA Fulham FC spokesperson said: \"We are deeply troubled and concerned to learn of the disturbing reports following yesterday's documentary. We have sincere empathy for the women who have shared their experiences.\n\"We are in the process of establishing whether anyone at the club is or has been affected. Should any person wish to share information or experiences relating to these allegations, we encourage them to contact the club at safeguarding@fulhamfc.com or the police.\"\nA press conference yesterday which set out the claims made against the late Harrods' owner heard there was a \"systematic failure of corporate responsibility\".\nBarrister Dean Armstrong KC told reporters: \"And that systematic failure is on the shoulders of Harrods.\"\nThe legal team also represents women who were employed by the Paris Ritz and investigations were ongoing into \"all entities that he had involvement in\", including Fulham Football Club.\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.
