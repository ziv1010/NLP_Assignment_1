Kernick carves up Maroons\nBlues lock Olivia Kernick dominated by every measure, and last year's Dally M medallist was the undisputed player of the match.\nShe had two tries plus an assist, made 35 tackles, ran a mammoth 236 metres, and had 10 tackle breaks — the same as the entire Maroons side.\nBut her most poetic moment of the match was her classic don't argue to fend off Tamika Upton on her way to her first try.\nShe was understated when speaking to ABC Sport after the match.\n“I’m just super proud, we’ve worked so hard the last six weeks in our training block and this week in camp, so super stoked and happy,” she said.\n2. Waterworks don't stop Blues\nABC Sport commentator Andrew Moore summed it up simply: “This field is a disgrace.”\nHeavy rain dumped onto the Sydney Football Stadium before the match, and despite easing off in time for kick off – the state of the surface got progressively worse throughout the game.\nIt was nearly impossible to see many of the field markings, and there were multiple patches of large puddles.\nThe conditions had a bigger impact on the Maroons who made more errors, while the Blues kept it smart and simple, while still producing entertaining footy.\nUnfortunately it affected the crowd numbers — with just over 16,000 fans turning up, well shy of the record 26,022 fans that attended Game I in Brisbane.\n3. What's Origin without a bunker controversy?\nThe Maroons got the first real look at the tryline on the night and made sure to use the slippery conditions to their advantage when Lauren Brown poked a grubber into the in-goal from close range.\nKernick couldn't take the ball cleanly before Upton came through to dive on it, but everyone looked resigned to the result being a line dropout.\nOn-field referee Belinda Sharpe sent it to the bunker as no try, believing both NSW and Queensland players had knocked on, but Gerard Sutton saw it differently.\n\"At no point is Olivia Kernick trying to ground the ball, she is trying to gain possession and fails to do so. Queensland then comes through and grounds the ball in the in-goal. We have a decision,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the Maroons were all in position to field the dropout and couldn't hide their amusement when 'TRY' flashed up on the big screen. Kernick was slightly less tickled.\n\"Are you kidding? [I] grounded the ball,\" a stunned Kernick said to Sharpe.\nLater, NSW prop and Nine commentator Millie Elliott said: \"Even Tamika and the whole of the Queensland side were surprised that was a try.\"\nWhether it was a legitimate try or not, it certainly lit a fire under Kernick and the Blues.\n4. Strange refereeing\nAfter the bunker's dubious call, the Blues on the park showed remarkable composure to stay in the fight, but up in the box there was some tension building.\nNSW coach John Strange had a mid-game chat to broadcaster Channel Nine and relatively politely let his feelings be known about the refereeing, saying the Maroons were slowing down the ruck.\n\"Hopefully they get penalised for laying all over us,\" Strange said.\nThe ruck speed was slow and the calls were not forthcoming from Sharpe, but Strange appeared even more frustrated after the game when star centre Jessica Sergis missed the entire second half with a neck injury.\nSergis was clearly struggling after being caught in a tackle and was still ginger and disoriented after the game, with her tears appearing to be about more than the victory.\nStrange was again somewhat diplomatic in the press conference after the game, saying a number of his players were caught in unpunished crusher tackles, which was \"disappointing\".\n5. Bruising Blues defence\nThe Blues were damaging in defence – and like Game I, their forward pack once again laid the foundation for the win.\nThey were determined and unrelenting in forcing the Maroons back into their own territory and making them pay for any missteps.\nOne of the standout moments was in the build-up to the Blues’ first try.\nThey pinned the Maroons in their own half, piled the pressure on Ali Brigginshaw who couldn’t get a decent kick away, and from the ensuing set they steamrolled through the middle, with Simaima Taufa bursting through for the try that opened the floodgates.",
