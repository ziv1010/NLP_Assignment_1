  "body_text": "Overview:\nHaiti was eliminated from the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup after three extremely unsatisfactory performances. Statistically, it was one of, if not the worst, Haiti's World Cup campaigns in five participations across all ages and sexes. Les Grenadiers conceded 16 goals in just three games.\nHaiti was knocked out of the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup after losing all three of its matches in the group stage. Haiti’s Les Grenadiers were among the worst teams of the tournament as they racked the third-worst goal differential: -12. The team conceded the third most goals in the tournament, 16, and only found the net four times.\nStatistically, it was the worst performance in five World Cups across all age groups for Haiti, including men and women, suggesting that soccer is severely deteriorating rather than advancing.\nRanch de la Croix-des-Bouquets, a housing youth training center, has been closed since November 2021 due to gang violence. The Haitian League is operating with only 14 teams due to gang violence in Port-au-Prince, down from 18.\nAdditionally, the Haitian Football Federation is being led by a committee of normalization instead of a president. All of these factors have been detrimental to the development of soccer in the country. Before the World Cup, Haiti also put up disastrous performances in other competitions in recent years, such as in the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup in June.\nLes Grenadiers’ worst-ever showing in the World Cup in 2025 even included an embarrassing 8-1 loss to England. Haiti’s soccer is in dire need of a renaissance.\nScores of fans took over social media to lament and share their frustration and desire to see a renaissance — just like the country as a whole is in need of one. But it is a long shot.\nTranslation: It’s true, we Haitians love soccer a lot… But when you look at things closely, you see that Haiti is very far away when talking about soccer. The level is very low. But congrats because we had the chance to play in the World Cup.\nTranslation: I’m not going to criticize but we have to agree that everything going on in the country is done in a rush. Nothing is in order for success. There’s no regulation. We don’t even have traffic lights in the streets, see how bad we are. Guys, thank you for representing the country. Hats off to you, guys. Nothing to blame. You all did everything you had to do.\nTranslation: Let’s just give up on this soccer thing. Let’s take a break from playing it. Let’s just watch it.\nHaiti conceded the most goals but also scored the most in the recent World Cup it participated in. Les Grenadiers have never won a game in the global tournament and only earned one draw out of 15 matches. Across all five World Cups, Haiti’s record stands at 0 wins, 1 draw and 14 losses.\nHaiti’s defense looked extremely disorganized in the team’s three World Cup games. The players lacked energy and were often out of position. As a result, the team often conceded early. For instance, Haiti conceded its first goal in the third minute of the first game, which was against Egypt on Nov. 4. They lost that encounter 4-1. England bullied Les Grenadiers 8-1 on Nov. 7 before Venezuela beat them 4-2.\nHaiti performed best in the last game against Venezuela on Nov. 10 but still ended up losing. Two of Haiti’s top performers were right winger Franco Celestin and attacking midfielder Woodson Felix. Both players made history by becoming the only two Haitians to tally a goal and an assist in a World Cup.\nHaiti will attempt to qualify for a World Cup later this month as the senior team will end its qualifying campaign with games against Costa Rica on Nov. 13 and Nicaragua on Nov. 18.",
