  "body_text": "NFHS names national coaches of the year\nTwenty-three high school coaches from across the country have been selected as 2021-22 National Coaches of the Year by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) Coaches Association.\nThe NFHS, which has been recognizing coaches through an awards program since 1982, honors coaches in the top 10 girls sports and top 10 boys sports (by participation numbers), and in two “other” sports – one for boys and one for girls – that are not included in the top 10 listings. The NFHS also recognizes a spirit coach as a separate award category. Winners of NFHS awards must be active coaches during the year for which they receive their award. This year’s awards recognize coaches for the 2021-22 school year.\nRecipients of the 2021-22 national awards for boys sports are: Billy Bowen, baseball, Durant (Oklahoma) Silo High School; Greg Haagsma,basketball, Chandler (Arizona) Valley Christian High School; Rickey Baker, cross country, Keams Canyon (Arizona) Hopi High School; Greg Grant, 11-player football, Heppner (Oregon) High School; Brendan Patch, golf, Huntington Beach (California) Edison High School; Michael Hagerty, soccer, Yarmouth (Maine) High School; Richard Blanc, swimming and diving, Rancho Santa Margarita (California) Santa Margarita Catholic High School; Josh Munro, tennis, Kalispell (Montana) Glacier High School; Benny Mitchell, track and field, Taos (New Mexico) High School; and Jeffrey Matczak, wrestling, Kaukauna (Wisconsin) High School.\nThe recipients of the 2021-22 NFHS national awards for girls sports are: Mary Klinger, basketball, Somerset (New Jersey) Rutgers Preparatory School; Jill Evers, cross country, Kent City (Michigan) High School; Frank Gallant, golf, Springfield (Missouri) Catholic High School; Tim Godby, lacrosse, Milton (Georgia) High School; William Pfeifer Jr., soccer, Moon Township (Pennsylvania) Moon Area High School; Mark Watt, softball, Lincoln (Nebraska) Southwest High School; Michael Rose, swimming and diving, Brookfield (Wisconsin) East High School; Kirsten Ruchaber, tennis, Portland (Oregon) Jesuit High School; Sue Hysong, track and field, Avondale (Arizona) Westview High School; and Iona Stookey, volleyball, Worden (Montana) Huntley Project High School.\nThe recipient of the National Coach of the Year Award for spirit is Debbie Kishpaugh of Pendleton (Oregon) High School. Dan Shine, an ice hockey coach at Arlington (Massachusetts) Catholic High School, was chosen in the “other” category for boys sports, and Terri Simonetti-Frost, a field hockey coach at Thomas Worthington High School in Worthington, Ohio, was chosen in the “other” category for girls sports.\nThe NFHS receives nominations from its member state associations, which often works with the state coaches’ association in its respective state. The state association then contacts the potential state award recipients to complete a coach profile form that requests information regarding the coach’s record, membership in and affiliation with coaching and other professional organizations, involvement with other school and community activities and programs, and coaching philosophy. To be approved as an award recipient and considered for sectional and national coach of the year consideration, this profile form must be completed by the coach or designee and then approved by the executive director (or designee) of the state athletic/activities association.\nThe next award level after state coach of the year is sectional coach of the year. The NFHS is divided into eight geographical sections. They are as follows: Section 1 – Northeast (CT, ME, MA, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VT); Section 2 – Mideast (DE, DC, KY, MD, OH, PA, VA, WV); Section 3 – South (AL, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TN); Section 4 – Central (IL, IN, IA, MI, WI); Section 5 – Midwest (KS, MN, MO, NE, ND, SD); Section 6 – Southwest (AR, CO, NM, OK, TX); Section 7 – West (AZ, CA, HI, NV, UT); and Section 8 – Northwest (AK, ID, MT, OR, WA, WY).\nThe NFHS Coaches Association has an advisory committee composed of a chair and eight sectional representatives. The sectional committee representatives evaluate the state award recipients from the states in their respective sections and select the best candidates for the sectional award in each sport category. The NFHS Coaches Association Advisory Committee then considers the sectional candidates in each sport, ranks them according to a point system, and determines a national winner for each of the 20 sport categories, the spirit category and two “other” categories.\nA total of 870 coaches will be recognized this year with state, sectional and national awards.\nFollowing are biographical sketches of the 23 NFHS National High School Coaches of the Year for 2021-22:\nCOACHES OF THE YEAR – BOYS SPORTS\nBaseball\nBilly Bowen (Durant, Oklahoma)\nBilly Bowen has been the baseball coach at Silo High School in Durant, Oklahoma, for more than 20 years and has led his teams to 18 state championships – six in the fall and 12 in the spring. (The Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association conducts two state baseball championships each year.) Overall, Bowen has coached for 36 years and has won more than 2,200 games in the combined seasons. A 1979 draft choice of the Atlanta Braves, Bowen is a two-time Oklahoma Baseball Coaches Association (OBCA) Coach of the Year (2009, 2017), and a 2005 inductee into the OBCA Hall of Fame. Bowen also coached girls basketball for seven years and won 381 games in 19 years as a boys basketball coach. He also was a school administrator for 22 years and athletic director for 15 years. Bowen said he became involved in high school sports to “help mold students and better equip them for life through athletics.”\nBasketball\nGreg Haagsma (Chandler, Arizona)\nGreg Haagsma has led the Valley Christian High School boys basketball team to the Arizona Interscholastic Association (AIA) state tournament 20 times since the 2001 season. He has coached the Chandler, Arizona, school to seven AIA state championships, including last year’s Class 3A team that won the title with a 27-3 record. Haagsma has a 590-183 record in 25 years as high school boys basketball coach, and he has received numerous Coach of the Year honors. He also has served as the school’s athletic director since 2013 and was selected 3A Conference Athletic Director of the Year in 2020-21. He also coached girls basketball for six years and led his teams to five state tournament appearances, and has been co-owner of Valley Christian sports camps since 1996. Haagsma believes that “educational athletics play an important role in the overall development of each student at the high school level. The experiences are part of the process by which our young men and women are being taught character qualities and are being molded into the adults that we desire they become.”\nCross Country\nRickey Baker (Keams Canyon, Arizona)\nRickey Baker has become one of the most successful boys cross country coaches in the nation since his arrival at Hopi High School in Keams Canyon, Arizona in 1987. Three years later, Baker led Hopi to its first state boys cross country championship, and his teams didn’t lose another state title until 2017 – a streak of 27 consecutive team championships. The 27 consecutive state cross country titles is a national record, and Baker’s 1999 team scored a perfect 15, which means Hopi runners finished 1-2-3-4-5. Perhaps most amazing about the streak is that Hopi continued to win despite moving into larger classifications. Hopi won 11 straight 2A titles (1990-2000), six consecutive 3A titles (2001-2006) and 10 straight 4A titles (2007-16). He has also coached Hopi’s boys basketball team for 18 years, with a 2A state title in 1997, and the girls and boys track and field teams for the past 10 years. Baker was a 2021 inductee into the NFHS National High School Hall of Fame.\nFootball, 11-Player\nGreg Grant (Heppner, Oregon)\nCurrently the football coach at Heppner (Oregon) High School, Greg Grant has compiled an outstanding 330-76 record in 41 years of coaching. He has led his teams to three Oregon School Activities Association (OSAA) state championships (1992, 2015 and 2019) and three runner-up finishes (1989, 2007 and 2014). Grant, who ranks No. 4 on the all-time Oregon football coaching victories list, has received numerous State and Conference Coach of the Year awards. In addition to coaching football at Heppner High School since 1990, Grant also has served as the school’s athletic director since 2001 and has been an assistant coach for several other sports. Grant has served on the Oregon Athletic Coaches Association and the Oregon Athletic Directors Association Boards of Directors, and he has served on several OSAA committees. Grant’s philosophy of athletics is to “capitalize on the lessons available in athletics to enrich every player’s life now and into the future. It is my goal that players leave our program realizing that attendance, timeliness, effort and accountability are actions that will set them up for success in every facet of their lives.”\nGolf\nBrendan Patch (Huntington Beach, California)\nBrendan Patch has coached at the high school level for 26 years and is currently boys golf coach at Edison High School in Huntington Beach, California. He has led his teams to 250 victories, including the 2007 California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) state title. Within the CIF-Southern Section, Patch’s teams won the Central Division title in 2006 and the Southern Division championships in 2019. Edison, which finished fifth in the CIF state meet last year, won the SCGA Southern California and the Southern Nevada Invitational last year. Patch has also coached basketball at various levels for 15 years and served as a public-address announcer for several sports for 15 years. Patch said his coaching philosophy is very simple: “While success on the course (or in the gradebook) will always be an important goal, my main objective is to foster the growth of my players and students as individuals. My aim is to make them valued contributors to the betterment of the school, local community and society as a whole.”\nSoccer\nMichael Hagerty (Yarmouth, Maine)\nFor 30 years, Michael Hagerty has led and developed the youth soccer community in Yarmouth, Maine.
