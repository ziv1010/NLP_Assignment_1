  "body_text": "ON Friday 8 March, we celebrate International Women’s Day (IWD).\nMelbourne Football Club prides itself on being an inclusive and diverse workplace that uplifts women and female-identifying people.\nThis year’s official UN theme is ‘Count Her In: Invest in Women. Accelerate Progress’, which examines the pathways towards greater economic inclusion for women and girls.\nWe are committed to showcasing women across the organisation including leaders and emerging leaders; learn more in the interviews below.\nKate Roffey | President, Melbourne Football Club\nTell us about your journey to Melbourne Football Club?\nAn executive recruiter once described my journey as ‘career by chaos’; and that pretty much sums it up. I have always done what my gut has told me it feels like it’s what I am supposed to do - not what everyone told me I should do.\nI think of my journey as my ‘Hallway of Opportunities’. When you start out you look down this long hallway and at the end of it you think you can see a door with a big shiny star on it - no idea what that star means - but you focus all your energy racing towards it. Along the way you forget to stop and consider all these other interesting doors that may not have stars on them, but can lead you on great journeys.\nFortunately, when I was younger as I raced along I noticed a door that had ‘backpacking’ written on it. Everyone told me I would miss out career-wise if I opened that door - but I went through anyway. That door took me all over the world for almost 4 years. I taught horse riding in New York, drove dog sleds in Lapland, was taken off a train at gunpoint in the Ukraine and ended up in the middle of a knife fight in Mongolia. Not the most conventional of career choices - but that time taught me great resilience, self-awareness, tolerance and understanding - skills that I use every day as a President of an AFL Club. Sometimes it’s the most unconventional of choices that provide us with the most useful experiences.\nIn your opinion, how does Melbourne support women in the football industry?\nLong before AFLW was a thing, Melbourne was at the forefront of pushing women forward, both on the field and off. Wonderful women at our club - Debbie Lee, Karen Hayes, Daisy Pearce, Jen Watt to name a few - worked so hard to get a series of Women’s Exhibition matches against the Bulldogs off the ground.\nAs the pre-cursor to the AFLW – these matches really showed that the women's game was worth investing in. I couldn’t be prouder that AFL Hall of Famer Debbie Lee, West Coast Eagles Women’s program Head Coach Daisy Pearce and North Melbourne CEO Jen Watt - all started out as Melbourne people.\nThis year’s theme is ‘Count Her In: Invest in Women. Accelerate Progress’. How can the industry better remove barriers to help women accelerate progress?\nA huge part of progression for anyone is quite simply experience – the opportunity to learn by doing, to make mistakes in a safe space, to try again, to work out the answers for yourself. Giving women more opportunities to gain experience is critical, so proactively making sure that those opportunities are made available will go a long way in progressing women along that experience pathway.\nWho is a woman in the club who has inspired your journey and why?\nI am constantly in awe of the young women who play football for our club. To see them standing up and pushing women’s football forward is amazing. They aren’t full time professional athletes yet in a salary sense – and many still balance work and playing commitments – but despite these pressures their commitment to their sport and to representing our club is outstanding.\nAny time I feel too old or tired, I think of them heading to training after a full day’s work or recovering from their second ACL injury determined to play again. That gives me more than enough inspiration to stand up and take that next step up the mountain.\nJessie Mulholland | Head of Women’s Football\nTell us about your journey to Melbourne Football Club?\nI grew up in Wollongong, NSW and started playing football at 12 years old. I was then involved in the advocacy of female participation growth for Junior Girls football. This was really the start of my passion in female football and career in the AFL and I went on to drive female participation in the South Coast, NSW region which resulted in massive growth in both Junior Girls and Senior Women’s.\nI moved to Melbourne in 2016 to pursue my career in the AFL and started working for AFL Victoria to deliver and execute the AFLW’s Season 1 Marketing and Development Plan. My next role was with the Eastern Football League, Outer East Football League and Eastern Ranges NAB League Club as the Female Talent and Operations Manager. Here, I was responsible for the management of both the Junior Girls and Senior Women’s Competitions as well as the NAB League talent pathway players.\nI was then fortunate enough to be successful in the AFLW Football Operations Role with the Dees in 2020 where I have now recently become the Head of Women's Football.\nIn your opinion, how does Melbourne support women in the football industry?\nMelbourne supports its employees with a supportive and flexible working environment as well as personal development opportunities either chosen by the individual or as a club with guest speakers and ability to attend external events and conferences.\nI’ve been well supported not only in my role but as an individual with personal development opportunities. I was lucky enough to be put forward for the AFL Women in Leadership Course with Andi Pert in 2022 which was incredible to be involved in with some exceptional women from the AFL and other clubs. I’m also currently being supported through the Change Our Game – Next Generation Program.\nThis year’s theme is ‘Count Her In: Invest in Women. Accelerate Progress’. How can the industry better remove barriers to help women accelerate progress?\nAllies play a massive part in removing barriers. Male allies to female progression will only produce better output and overall success, not only to the women involved, their careers and sense of value but to the business and industry as a whole.\nWomen progressing and succeeding should not be seen as an inconvenience, a burden or a threat but should be prioritised and celebrated.\nI’ve been so fortunate to have male allies along my journey and honestly can’t imagine how much more difficult it would have been if I didn’t.\nWho is a woman in the club who has inspired your journey and why?\nOur Media Manager, Caitlin Nobes is a driven, determined and hardworking woman who consistently inspires me. Her ability to connect to players, staff and external stakeholders is genuine and authentic.\nShe is driven and determined in her role but also to ensure our club continues to improve and grows on and off the field. She always provides support whilst also challenging me to be the best version of myself. I love learning from her and love watching her growth also.\nMallory Smith | Head of Men's Football Operations\nTell us about your journey to Melbourne Football Club?\nI joined the Club 14 years ago in an Events administration role as a 21-year-old straight out of university. After four seasons, I transitioned across to the Football Department and have been a part of the Football Admin and Football Operations team for the past 10 seasons, working alongside and supporting a great group of coaches, players and staff. While I never thought my life at Melbourne would still be going when I started back in 2010, it’s the people within any organisation that make it great and why I am proud to belong and still be part of this Footy Club.\nIn your opinion, how does Melbourne support women in the football industry?\nMelbourne has supported my career progression with growth and development opportunities and experience in a variety of football areas. In recent times, a number key football positions have been occupied by women, and I’m really proud to have been part of a team with both a female Head Doctor (Dr Laura Lallenec) and senior Physiotherapist (Kathleen Sakadjian) over the past few seasons.\nThis year’s theme is ‘Count Her In: Invest in Women. Accelerate Progress’. How can the industry better remove barriers to help women accelerate progress?\nWomen being visible in all roles, particularly positions of leadership and key decision making, is an important step in allowing others to aspire to be in similar roles in the future. This is now evident in the AFL with female CEO, President and Senior Executive positions commonly held by women, as well as the AFL Football Department being led by a female Executive General Manager - Football.\nWho is a woman in the club who has inspired your journey and why? (Past or present)\nI am lucky to have worked alongside a number of incredible women at Melbourne. North Melbourne CEO Jen Watt, and Collingwood GM Football Operations and AFLW Clare Pettyfor, are just two examples of inspiring women I have been privileged to learn from and watch progress through the industry, making a positive impact.\nLibby Blampied | General Manager, Marketing & Digital\nTell us about your journey to Melbourne Football Club?\nI joined the Club back in 2018, in the role of Digital Content Manager.\nThe first chapter of my career was spent working in destination marketing and tourism, working in various comms and marketing roles at Mt Buller. The ski industry has some distinct similarities to footy; it’s seasonal, the product (weather!) is out of your control, and it’s fuelled by people’s love and passion for the sport. My time at Buller also spawned a love for being a part of a small team, responsible for a recognisable and loved brand.\nAfter departing Buller in 2015, I spent some time working in agencies and even did a stint in government. None of this set my world on fire, but it was valuable experience. I learned a lot in a short space of time and got a lot of clarity on what is important to me professionally.\nAfter spending some time working in an agency which focused primarily on music festivals, tours, and ticketed events, I knew I wanted to get back to my in-house, small team roots. Because of its similarities to the ski industry and my love of AFL, I set my sights on Clubland and I’ve been at the Dees ever since.\nIn your opinion, how does Melbourne support women in the football industry?\nIn my own experience, Melbourne has been nothing but supportive of my professional growth over the last six years. Whether it be through leadership and development courses, or exposing me to new professional challenges and roles, I’ve rarely been denied the opportunity to challenge myself and learn something new.\nIn our environment, if you’re able to identify and articulate a goal, you’re supported and encouraged to achieve it.\nThis year’s theme is ‘Count Her In: Invest in Women. Accelerate Progress’. How can the industry better remove barriers to help women accelerate progress?\nOne of the exciting things I’ve been able to witness at our Club has been the influence our females’ executive leaders have when we’re making important decisions for our organisation and our people.\nDiversity of experience and thought is critical to accelerating progress, and ensuring there are a variety of voices contributing in these moments has a significant impact.\nThe make-up of our executives, boards and football departments is changing for the better, which has real benefit not only for women working in football, but for everyone connected to our game.\nWho is a woman in the club who has inspired your journey and why?\nLooking back at what our industry looked like when I first started in football, it blows me away to see how far we have come in such a short time. Of course, AFLW was in its infancy and women’s’ contributions to the game was in the spotlight, but our leaders were still predominantly male.\nWe now see far more female representation at all levels of the game, and I am excited to see this continue and develop even more over the coming years.\nIt's the women whose drive, determination, tenacity, and ability to push for change who inspire me the most. They create more opportunity and an exciting future for anyone who follows in their wake.\nSteph Di Julio | HR Coordinator\nTell us about your journey to Melbourne Football Club?\nI've always been passionate about sports, especially AFL, and since joining the Dees two years ago, I’ve never looked back.\nMy journey to Melbourne Football Club began with my love for the game and my desire to contribute to the team's success. The Club allows you to really immerse yourself in the culture, its rich history, and getting to know your colleagues on a deeper level.\nEvery day brings new challenges and opportunities for growth, and I'm very fortunate to be part of such a dynamic and forward-thinking organisation, who value their staff, the playing group and their overall development. The ultimate goal is to make meaningful contributions to MFC and helping the whole club reach new heights of success, both on and off the field.\nIn your opinion, how does Melbourne support women in the football industry?\nMelbourne Football Club places a significant emphasis on professional and personal development for women. This investment manifests through various avenues, including tailored training programs and access to forums that facilitate skill enhancement and knowledge sharing. The club offers leadership courses designed to empower women to take on influential roles within the organisation, alongside internal training programs that offer valuable opportunities for skill refinement and career progression.\nBy prioritising these developmental pathways, MFC highlights its commitment to fostering the growth and success of women in football, equipping them with the tools and resources needed to thrive in their professional careers.\nThis year’s theme is ‘Count Her In: Invest in Women. Accelerate Progress’. How can the industry better remove barriers to help women accelerate progress?\nContinuing to celebrate and externally profile women who are already thriving within the industry is crucial to providing great visibility and showcasing the opportunities available to women. As the saying goes, \"You can't be what you can't see.\" By profiling successful women, we not only highlight their achievements but also inspire others who may have never considered working in this industry.\nBy promoting visibility, we can continue to improve representation by attracting talented women who wouldn’t have otherwise thought about a career in our great game, leading to better outcomes overall. Recognising and promoting the accomplishments of women in the industry not only fosters diversity and inclusion but also demonstrates the wealth of talent and potential within our organisation. Through these efforts, we can create a more inclusive and supportive environment where everyone, regardless of gender, can thrive and succeed.\nWho is a woman in the club who has inspired your journey and why?\nI've had the privilege of crossing paths with many remarkable women throughout the years, each of whom has left a lasting impression on me. It’s always difficult to choose just one individual. So, I’ll give you two.\nJess Vandelaak – General Manager – Human Resource\nThe driving force behind my career journey to date. Her passion, dedication, and level of care to not only myself, but to the wider organisation is truly inspirational. I’ve been fortunate to be guided by Jess’ leadership and to ask the question, ‘why we do this’. In our industry, fostering connections among individuals is paramount, and Jess makes it her mission to foster that sense of connection. She inspires my ambition for leadership in the realm of People and Culture, urging me to continuously push for improvement.\nJessie Mulholland – Head of Women’s Football\nJessie exemplifies excellence in her leadership, teamwork, and commitment to the advancement of the AFLW and VFLW programs. She sets a high standard for performance and inspires others to strive for greatness in the role they play within the club. Jessie has inspired me to think differently and look for opportunities to enhance and grow the game within.\nAmy Smith | Senior Membership Operations Executive\nTell us about your journey to Melbourne Football Club?\nI have always been passionate about sport and the way it brings people together to live healthily & happily, improving all aspects of wellbeing.\nI completed a double degree, Bachelor of Exercise and Sports Science/ Bachelor of Business (Sport Management) at Deakin University and upon graduating, I secured a contract at Cricket Victoria working as Membership Officer for the Melbourne Stars and Renegades. In this role, I loved helping to deliver match days and seeing junior members come to the MCG & Marvel Stadium with excitement to watch their favourite players. Whilst cricket runs through my background, AFL is my favourite sport to watch and the opportunity to take the next step into the Melbourne Football Club was so inspiring.\nUnfortunately, the week I was offered my first role at the Demons, the club and all of Melbourne went into lockdown and I couldn’t be advised of a start time. Months passed and I found myself working for a Civil Construction company in Site Administration whilst we lived through the depths of COVID-19. In March 2021, I was officially given the Membership Officer role.\nI believe that my time away from working in sport truly made me more grateful for the opportunity at Melbourne Football Club and I often think how fortunate I am to be where I am today, working for a proud, historic and successful sporting club.\nIn your opinion, how does Melbourne support women in the football industry?\nMelbourne provides incredible experiences for their staff and players. The club hold its purpose of ensuring its people are ‘Proud to Belong’ high in every decision.\nEvents on offer such as the ‘Change Our Game’ luncheons, Jim Stynes Foundation launch, MCC Sporting Sections Grand Final Week Lunch, Women in Sport Business evening, W Awards, AFLW Grand Final Week Lunch and AFL Women’s Summit provides the opportunity to learn from and network with likeminded people in sport.\nPersonal development seminars and programs such as Mental Health Training, Authentic Best Self, Acknowledging Country, Minus 18, Presentation Skills, Nutrition For You and Self Leadership shows that the club strives to support and guide us to be the best version of ourselves.\nThis year’s theme is ‘Count Her In: Invest in Women. Accelerate Progress’. How can the industry better remove barriers to help women accelerate progress?\nThe industry is moving in the right direction to create equality in the AFL.\nPromoting the opportunities and roles that are available for women is a key to ensuring that the presence of women in the AFL continues to build. If young women can see their seniors thrive and have amazing experiences within the industry, it is only going to encourage them to follow their passions into the AFL.\nWho is a woman in the club who has inspired your journey and why?\nIt’s extremely hard to narrow down to a single woman who has inspired my journey. I would not be here today without the belief that Kat Robb showed when hiring me. Kat is someone I can always rely on. She and the other mothers within the club are inspiring in how they continue to balance motherhood and excel in their roles. It provides me with hope that one day I may too be able to build my career in the AFL whilst creating my own family.\nI can’t go without mentioning the inspiration that Kate Roffey is. Integral, passionate, confident and competent are some words that come to mind when I think of Kate. She stands up for what she believes, puts the best interests of others first, is approachable, shows real care and will always proudly cheer for the Dees. Her leadership is second to none and she motivates me to continue striving high.",
