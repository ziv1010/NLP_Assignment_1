My pride and ego tells me to go but I think the team and the fans deserve more. Right now, I'm not able to give 100 per cent mentally or physically.\"\nThe departure of Bright, Earps and Kirby from the team is a loss of three experienced players - between them they have 218 international appearances.\nEngland midfielder Fran Kirby announced her retirement from international football on Tuesday. Earps announced she was quitting international football with immediate effect last Tuesday 27 May.\nRead more:\nLioness: 99.9% of female players couldn't retire on salaries\nLionesses qualify for Euro 2025 after drawing with Sweden\nOn Tuesday, England missed out on a place in the Women's Nations League finals after Spain beat them 2-1 in Barcelona to go through instead.\nWiegman has paid tribute to Earps and Kirby but is yet to comment on the departure of Bright from the squad.\nWhen asked about how Kirby's retirement would affect the team, the England boss said she's got more important things to think about.\nCurrent and former England team-mates of Bright offered support, including England and Arsenal forward Chloe Kelly, who wrote \"proud of you always\" in a post of her social media pages, while Aston Villa striker Rachel Daly - who retired from international duty last summer - said: \"Couldn't be more proud. With you through EVERYTHING my girl.\"\nA message from the official Lionesses account read: \"We're all with you, Millie.\"\nWiegman had previously expressed support for Bright's decision to rule herself out of Nations League clashes.\nThe Lionesses' opening match of Euro 2025 will be against France on 5 July.",
