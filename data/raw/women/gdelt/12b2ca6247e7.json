  "body_text": "Nikita Parris: Man Utd are no longer underdogs\nManchester United forward Nikita Parris has admitted the club’s status has changed off the back of the 2022/23 campaign, which proved they are no longer 'underdogs' when it comes to competing with the WSL’s most established sides.\nAfter a couple of near misses, United at last broke into the WSL top three. Not only did they qualify for the Champions League for the first time, Marc Skinner’s team were also the first outside Chelsea, Arsenal or Manchester City to do so since 2014.\nUnited had previously struggled in top of the table clashes. But this past season produced home and away league wins over Arsenal, a first ever league victory against Manchester City and agonisingly close 1-0 defeats to Chelsea in both the WSL and the FA Cup final.\nGoing into the season, few had predicted United would be able to have such an impact and sustain it. But now they have done it once, expectations are different and they way are seen has changed.\nREAD THE LATEST MAN UTD WOMEN NEWS HERE\n\"This season [2023/24] will be different to last because we are no longer the underdogs. Teams now see us as a threat and we've shown we can compete right until the end,\" Parris told Manchester World.\n\"There's no longer getting to Christmas in the top positions and then falling off. As a team, we have to concentrate on consistency and not look to far ahead. We have to take it game by game.\"\nBy finishing second in the final WSL table, United have automatically bypassed the often inconveniently-timed first Champions League qualifying round and will start in the second. With the likes of Real Madrid, twice conquerors of Manchester City, and 2023 finalists Wolfsburg among their potential opponents, just getting into the group will be tough in itself.\n\"I like a challenge - and it is going to be a challenge,\" Parris said. \"European football is hard, we've seen the depth of quality in each and every team increase over the years. The objective last season was Champions League football, now we've attained that it is about staying in the Champions League and getting into the group stage. Right now we have to focus on getting to the group stage.\"",
