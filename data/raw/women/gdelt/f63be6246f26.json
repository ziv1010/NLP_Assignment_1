People are intrigued by world events that are shrouded in mystery. In many cases, the strange occurrences give the reader a conflict between what is presumed normal in society, and the facts of the case. In August of 2010, Buffalo police made a routine traffic stop on a 51-year-old man named Gary Korkuc, in the state of New York. Upon arriving at his car, the officers heard a distraught cat meowing in the trunk. After investigation, they found Navarro, a four-year-old cat “marinating” in oil, crushed red peppers and chili peppers. Police say Korkuc told them he was going to cook the animal. He was arrested on animal cruelty charges.\nIn 2010, an American construction worker named Gary Brooks Faulkner traveled to Pakistan in order to conduct a solo mission to hunt down and kill Osama bin Laden. He was detained after authorities discovered him in the mountains carrying a sword, pistol and night-vision goggles. After an investigation, Faulkner was sent back to the U.S.\nIn early 2010, Royal Dutch Navy sergeant Dick de Bruin lost his camera while diving off the coast of Aruba. In January, a curious sea turtle found the camera and the yellow strap of the waterproof case became entangled around its flipper. While untangling itself, the turtle turned the camera on and captured a five minute video. Over the next four months, the camera made its way north to the Florida Keys, where it washed ashore on May 16, 2010. The recovered video clearly shows the sea turtle’s journey.\nVerkhoyansk is a small town located in the Sakha Republic of Russia. It is situated on the Yana River, near the Arctic Circle. Verkhoyansk is the third smallest town in Russia, and the residents maintain a river port, an airport, a fur-collecting depot and the center of a reindeer-raising area. The town is notable for its exceptionally cold winters. The average monthly temperatures range from −45.8 °C (−50.4 °F) in January to 16.9 °C (62.4 °F) in July. Verkhoyansk is one of the most remote places in the northern hemisphere and it lies within an area known as Stalin’s Death Ring, after the former dictator sent political exiles there due to the extreme conditions.\nIn 2011, strange reports began to surface from village residents. A huge pack of gray wolves was regularly seen around the city’s proximity. It has been estimated that the pack is made up of 400 animals. The report has baffled wildlife experts, who have indicated that a pack of wolves this size is unheard of. The animals usually prefer to hunt in smaller groups of just six or seven. The massive collection of wolves is believed to be made up of several separate packs. The wolves began to frighten Verkhoyansk residents when they started to attack and kill local livestock. In early February of 2011, thirty horses were targeted and eaten by the pack. It is unusual for wolves to hunt such large prey. However, the animal’s usual diet, such as rabbits, has greatly decreased this year due to lack of plants, berries and food.\nIt has been noted by specialists that wolves are very careful in choosing the most nutritious food source that is the easiest to obtain. In this case, the meal happens to be horses. The wolf pack will start attacking dangerous prey when they run out of these options. For this reason, 24 teams of hunters have been put together to kill the animals. The men are paid a bounty of £210 for every wolf skin brought to officials. They will patrol the town’s neighborhoods on snowmobiles and set wolf traps. Once the daylight increases, the hunters will start shooting predators from helicopters. Environmentalists and wolf experts continue to follow the story, as a normal pack of wolves is not this size and the animals usually thrive where humans do not, in mountains or other isolated regions.\nAn elderly man who appears to be in his mid to late seventies or eighties has been terrorizing banks in Southern California. Since August 28, 2009, the individual has committed 13 armed bank robberies. Currently, the FBI in California is asking for information leading to his arrest. The Geezer Bandit was featured on the television show Americas Most Wanted, in October of 2010. The man’s appearance is strange and, apparently, when entering the bank, he is not messing around. The Geezer Bandit is mobile and moves extremely well for his age. He has a strict agenda and flawless getaway when committing his crimes. The man enters the bank like a normal customer, approaches the teller with a leather case, and then draws a revolver from his bag.\nThe bandit then demands money by handing the teller a note. He does not speak. A witness gave information to Americas Most Wanted that one of his notes read, “Give me $50,000 or I will murder you.” In some of the Geezer Bandit’s early heists, he was reportedly seen wearing tubes connected to an oxygen cylinder. As you would expect from the Internet population, the man has gained a significant following of people who have started several Facebook pages showing support for him and his crime spree. News media outlets have reported that people are trying to capitalize on his fan base by marketing “Geezer Bandit” t-shirts, which show a printed picture from surveillance images of his robberies.\nEven an apparent copycat of the criminal has made an appearance. However, the thief was not as careful in his getaway. The man ended up being arrested by the police. The officers later stated that they do not think he is the real Geezer Bandit. The FBI has claimed that they have information indicating that the criminal may not be an old man, just someone using a movie special effects mask, a master of disguise. He may not even be white, which makes the case tricky. The police interest in this theory increased in probability after a young Asian man was able to board a plane from Hong Kong to Canada wearing a mask of an elderly white male.\nStanley A. Fulham is a man who has published a collection of writings that examine extraterrestrial activity, world climate change, terrorist activity and unexplained phenomenon. Fulham’s most recent achievement was a book titled Challenges of Change. In the book, he describes an elaborate alien plan that has been implemented to help save our planet from environmental contamination. In his writings, Stanley has indicated that the universe is governed by a regional galactic authority, which consists of the intelligent civilizations Pleiades, Orion, Sirius, Bootes, Alpha Centauri, Comsuli, Zeta Reticuli and Pouseti. According to Fulham, in 2010, the Council of 8 decided to intervene with advanced technology to clean Earth’s atmosphere before an environmental collapse occurs. The council did so after reaching the conclusion that modern human technology can’t prevent species extinction on Earth.\nHe specifically mentions that the world will enter a transitional period between the years of 2010-2014, which will be accompanied by climate changes, monetary collapse, natural disaster and governmental disruptions. On September 13, 2010, Stanley Fulham gave a press release for his book Challenges of Change. In the statement, he predicted that a fleet of UFOs would descend upon Earth’s major cities on Wednesday, October 13. On the afternoon of the 13th, thousands of people witnessed and reported several shiny, circular objects flying high above the streets of Manhattan. Videos and unexplained photos of the event quickly appeared online. New York’s three major airports experienced a closure on the day in question. Stanley Fulham also predicted a series of UFO sightings over Moscow in early January 2011, followed by activity in London. News articles have documented a wave of unexplained aircraft over Moscow in January of 2011.\nWe have examined the predictions of Stanley A. Fulham and the events of October 13, 2010. However, we must explore another side of the story. The information surrounding the life of Stanley A. Fulham is choppy, inconsistent, and hard to find. Some Internet pages claim that he served in the U.S. military, while others state NORAD and the Canadian forces. There is also the coincidence that Stanley’s name is the same as a collection of English football clubs, Accrington Stanley (Stanley A) and Fulham F.C. In Stanley’s writings, he mentions the alien conspiracy, but also tackles a wide variety of international issues, including terrorism, world banking problems, and the September 11 attacks. In regard to 9/11, Challenges of Change says that the WTC towers were destroyed by jet fuel alone, not explosives, and that it was not an inside job.\nThe book specifically mentions the WTC Building #7, and states that it was destroyed by sympathetic vibration in the ground. Certain pieces of information in Fulham’s writings appear to have an agenda. For this reason, it has been suggested that he is a creation or pawn used by the US and UK governments to pass misinformation to the public. Ultimately, using the conspiracy of alien involvement on Earth to explain occurrences that make no scientific sense, like UFO sightings and the physics surrounding the WTC collapses. This theory would suggest that the government was responsible for the spectacle seen on October 13, 2010, and that they wanted the lights to be viewed by the New York population. In December of 2010, it was reported that Stanley A. Fulham had died after a long battle with cancer.\nEvery year people from all over the planet attempt to break world records and accomplish strange feats of athleticism. Many of these individuals are able to perform some incredible, bizarre, and life-threatening accomplishments. For hundreds of years, people have been searching for unique ways to cross the English Channel. On September 26, 2008, Swiss inventor Yves Rossy became the first man to travel over the channel by way of Jet-pack. It took him only 10 minutes. During the crossing, Rossy achieved speeds of up to 186mph. He was wearing his Kevlar wing suit, and jumped from a plane traveling at 8,200ft (2499m) and landed using a parachute on the other side of the channel. On May 28, 2010, it was reported that a man named Jonathan Trappe crossed the English Channel by way of cluster ballooning. Cluster ballooning involves a harness and a large collection of helium-inflated rubber balloons.\nJonathan Trappe departed near Challock, England, crossed over the White Cliffs of Dover at St. Margarets Bay, and made landfall again over Dunkirk, France. Freddy Nock is a Swiss man who is an extreme high-wire artist. He was raised in a famous circus family. Nock has been performing on the high-rope since the age of four. In his lifetime, Freddy Nock has achieved several world records. In January of 2011, he undertook his latest stunt near the Swiss mountain resort of St Moritz. Using only a balancing stick and no harness or safety net, Nock walked down the wire of a cable car line on Mount Corvatsch, which is 9,908 feet (3,019m) above sea level. He walked more than 5,200 feet (1,584m) down the wire. During the journey, Freddy Nock traveled from an altitude of 10,836 feet (3,302m) to 8,865 feet (2702m).\nInedia is the ability to survive without food. Modern nutrition science indicates that human fasting for extended periods of time leads to starvation, dehydration, and eventual death. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are the body’s only observed sources of energy. In the absence of calorie intake, the human body normally burns its own reserves of glycogen, body fat and muscle. Breatharianism is a concept that is related to inedia, in which believers claim food, and possibly water, are not necessary, and that humans can be sustained solely by prana or, more importantly, the energy of the sun. There is currently no peer-verified published scientific research to support the idea of inedia. However, many believe the process is a skill that can be learned through specific techniques.\nOver the years, a number of individuals have emerged claiming to live without food or water. The most famous is a man named Prahlad Jani. Prahlad Jani, also known as Mataji, is an Indian mystic who claims he has survived without food and water since 1940. According to his legend, at the age of 11, Jani underwent a religious experience while living alone in the jungle. He became a follower of the Hindu goddess Amba and has since chosen to dress as a female devotee, wearing a red sari-like garment, jewelry and crimson flowers in his shoulder-length hair. Since the 1970s, Jani has been living as a hermit in a cave in the rainforest near to the Gujarati temple of Ambaji, awakening at 4am each day and spending most of his time meditating.\nTwo separate studies of Prahlad Jani have been conducted in his lifetime, one in 2003, and the other in 2010. In both cases, investigators confirmed his ability to survive healthily without food and water during the testing periods. However, as of early 2011, the results and claims into such abilities have not been discussed in any scientific journal. The official data of the 2010 study remains confidential and has not been released by the Defense Research and Development Organization of India. The director of the Indian Defense Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS) has said that the results of the observations could “tremendously benefit mankind”, as well as “soldiers, victims of calamities and astronauts”, basically anyone who may have to survive without food or water for a long period of time.\nDuring the 2010 examination of Jani, a team of over 35 individuals researched him with daily clinical examinations, blood tests and scans. He had round-the-clock surveillance. The researchers have proclaimed that Jani was taken out of the sealed room only for requested exposure to the sun. This is interesting, because in other reported cases of inedia, subjects always claim that sungazing is vital to the process. After fifteen days of observation, during which Jani was said to have consumed no food, water or used the toilet, all his medical tests were reported as normal. Researchers described him as being in better health than someone half his age. As you would expect, international speculation regarding the results is highly contended, however, many nations have offered help with future studies involving Prahlad Jani.\nTaiga, also known as the boreal forest, is a biome characterized by coniferous forests. Taiga is the world’s largest terrestrial biome and covers huge portions of the Earth, predominantly in Canada, Alaska, most of Sweden, Finland, northern Norway, Mongolia, Japan and Siberia. For centuries, the taiga has been a hotspot for Sasquatch and Yeti sightings. For this reason, many Bigfoot expeditions are routinely carried out in these areas of the world, particularly Siberia and Canada. In October of 2010, a group of men who were searching for the mysterious Yeti, in the Mountain Shoria region of the Siberian taiga, returned with some interesting conclusions.\nThe expedition was the third trip to this specific area of Mountain Shoria. One of the group’s participants, the director of the International Center for Hominology, Igor Burtsev, assures that Yetis leave traces of life in the taiga. He references giant footsteps, flocks of hair, and abnormal branch shelters. Burtsev claims that the creatures build strange pyramidal constructions of trunks and branches in the forest, sometimes 3 or 4 meters tall, while other examples are only 30 cm high. The expedition also claims that they found evidence that the Altai Yeti has moved into the Kuznetsk region of Russia. This is thought to be due to forest fires and an extremely hot 2010 summer, creating a food shortage.\nThe men claim that the migration of the Yetis has caused them to encroach heavily into bear territory. In response, the two creatures are fighting for food. The men suggest that they have recovered evidence that the stronger and smarter Yeti is dominating the bears. It has been recognized that some Russian bears have been struggling for food, making them unable to hibernate for the entire winter. In these cases, people are worried that the bears will enter villages in search of something to eat. Clearly, this story is based around the assumption that the Yeti is real. However, other disturbing tales have surfaced from Russia indicating that the wild bear population is struggling for nourishment.\nIn a small village named Vezhnya Tchova, located in the Komi Republic of Russia, a chilling story has been written. It appears that two women who were visiting the local cemetery came across a large brown bear feeding on the human remains of a resident. Apparently, the bear dug up the corpse and was in the middle of feeding when the women approached. The shocked ladies cried in panic and frightened the bear back into the woods. They were exposed to a ghoulish scene, with the clothes of the bear’s already-dead victim draped over adjacent tombstones. Other people in the northern republic of Komi have reported that, during the winter of 2010-2011, bears have resorted to scavenging in towns and villages, rummaging through bins, stealing garden carrots and raiding dumps.\nThe expansion of modern technology and video cameras in the last 25 years has provided people with an unprecedented level of documentation. For this reason, every year a collection of top celebrities, politicians and business associates are filmed under provocative and, often times, disturbing circumstances. Bizarre news stories are leaked over the Internet and top television producers search for the most shocking real life revelations. In some noted cases, the celebrities are extremely intoxicated, and express outlandish views on Nazi Germany and the Jewish population. The most noted example is the 2006 Mel Gibson DUI incident, where Mel became belligerent and made anti-Semitic remarks towards his arresting officer.\nThe same thing happened to famed British Dior fashion designer John Galliano, in late February of 2011. Galliano was filmed giving an anti-Jewish tirade in a Paris bar. In the video, he can be seen speaking anti-Jewish insults at a group of Italian women. John Galliano declares “I love Hitler… and people like you would be dead. Your mothers, your forefathers would all be gassed.” It is illegal to make these types of remarks in Paris. It was reported on March 2, 2011, that Galliano will face trial for “allegedly making racist comments to customers in a cafe.” He has denied the allegations through his attorney. John Galliano was the head designer for Christian Dior from 1997 to March 1, 2011, when he was fired.\nMackenzie Phillips is an actress who starred in the movie American Graffiti and the sitcom One Day at a Time. Mackenzie is the daughter of singer John Phillips. John Phillips was the leader of The Mamas & the Papas, which is an American band that has sold nearly 100 million records worldwide. In September of 2009, Mackenzie Phillips released her memoir, titled High on Arrival. She appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss the disturbing allegations in her book. Mackenzie told Winfrey that she first tried cocaine when she was 11-years-old and that her father did drugs with her and injected her with cocaine. Then comes the shocker, she said that at the age of 19, on the night before her first wedding, “I woke up that night from a drug blackout to find myself having sex with my own father.”\nMackenzie Phillips then told Winfrey, “It became a consensual relationship” and described her participation in the sex with her father as “sort of Stockholm Syndrome, where you begin to love your captor.” Phillips said the incestuous relationship happened gradually for ten years, during a time that she was married to a man named Jeffrey Sessler. The sex ended when Mackenzie became pregnant and did not know who the father of her child was. She has stated that John Phillips paid for her to have an abortion, “and I never let him touch me again.” Since the revelation, Mackenzie Phillips has been disowned by her family and called a liar.\nShahidka, or Black Widow, is a term used to describe a collection of Islamist Chechen female suicide bombers. The women are believed to be connected to the Riyad-us Saliheen, which is a small force of Islamic militants. The term Black Widow originated from the distinction that some of the women are widows of men killed or imprisoned by the Russian forces in Chechnya. In the late 1990s, the concept to recruit single females and children for terrorist activity was developed by the Chechen rebel movement commander, Shamil Basayev. Basayev would seek out unstable women and often refer to them as “Brides of Allah.” The ranks of the Shahidkas are filled mainly with 15 to 19-year-old girls. According to journalist Julia Jusik, many of the women have been sold by their parents, while others have been kidnapped or tricked.\nIn some cases, recently widowed individuals have been targeted by the terrorist groups. Many of the female bombers are prepared for the attacks with drug disassociation techniques. They are given very little training and no knowledge of the bomb. The Black Widow terrorist usually doesn’t detonate her own explosives. Females and children are primary used because police don’t suspect them as suicide bombers. This is a practice that is quickly changing in Russia. Islamist terrorists often use cheap unused mobile phones as detonators. The Shahidka handler will explode the weapon by sending the linked cell phone a text message. This is done at a time when it is thought the terrorists can inflict maximum casualties, and the female bomber doesn’t know exactly when the event will occur.\nAfter Chechen militant Islamist Shamil Basayev was killed, in 2006, the Shahidkas program was cancelled, but since 2009, the female terrorists are back in Russia. On March 29, 2010, 37 people were killed when two suicide bombers detonated explosives on the Moscow subway. The event was linked to the Shahidkas. On January 24, 2011, an explosion occurred at Domodedovo International Airport, which is Moscow’s busiest. The bomb was targeted at foreign travelers and killed at least 37 people, injuring some 180 citizens. The source of the attack is still unclear and a 20-year-old man has been identified as a main suspect. According to Russian newspaper accounts, the attack was carried out by two suicide bombers, a man and a woman.\nA disturbing event involving a Black Widow bomber occurred on December 31, 2010. In preparation for a New Year’s Eve Moscow terrorist attack, a female bomber was killed when her weapon was prematurely triggered by a spam message sent by her mobile phone operator. The text was wishing her a Happy New Year and it detonated her suicide belt. The damage was extensive and if the explosion had occurred near Red Square on New Year’s Eve, hundreds of people would have been killed. In most cases, the terrorist’s cell phones are kept switched off until the very last minute, but in this instance, Russian security sources believe, the terrorists were careless. The unnamed Shahidka is thought to be connected with the same group that struck Moscow’s Domodedovo airport 25 days later.\nIt has been observed that the sudden swarm of earthquakes in the U.S. state of Arkansas, including the largest quake to hit the state in 35 years, is possibly related to natural-gas drilling. Steve Horton, an earthquake specialist at the University of Memphis, is worried by the correlation between the Arkansas earthquake swarm and the disposal of wastewater in injection wells. Ninety percent of the earthquakes that have occurred since 2009 have been within 6 kilometers of the Arkansas salt water disposal wells. Arkansas has also been in the news for a bizarre collection of animal mass death events, one involving the loss of 5,000 red-winged black birds and the other over 100,000 freshwater drum. The official cause of the mass fish deaths remains a mystery.\nJohn P. Wheeler III is a man who was the chairman of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, and a senior U.S. military official. He was murdered on December 30, 2010, by way of blunt force trauma. The events surrounding his mysterious death have put forth some allegations that connect Wheeler with the Arkansas mass animal death events. On December 31, 2010, John Wheeler’s dead body was recovered by a landfill worker, who witnessed it falling into a trash heap at the Cherry Island Landfill, near Newark, Delaware. The police ruled his death a homicide. In the days prior to the discovery of his body, John Wheeler III was seen in a variety of locations acting strangely. According to the Washington Post, Wheeler was sighted on December 29 at the New Castle County courthouse. He was identified in the parking garage, disoriented and wearing only one shoe. He was incoherent and the attendant reported that Wheeler was extremely distraught.\nOn December 30, John was sighted wandering in various office buildings, including Mitre and DuPont locations, where he refused assistance from several individuals. His behavior was described as abnormal for his character. Following Wheeler’s death, a shocking report surfaced out of Russia, which has been discussed on various websites. The report is said to have been prepared for Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin by the Foreign Military Intelligence Directorate (GRU). It indicates that John P. Wheeler III uncovered, and threatened to expose, a failed U.S. Military test surrounding the Arkansas animal deaths. According to the report, in the early 2000s, the United States relocated an estimated 63,000 metric tonnes of the poisonous gas phosgene, from Iraq to the Pine Bluff Arsenal in Arkansas. Phosgene has been described as one of the most feared chemical weapons ever used, due to its ability to literally cause the lungs and respiratory system to explode.\nAccording to the report, after Russia accused the United States of not destroying Iraq’s phosgene poisonous gas stockpile, the Pine Bluff Arsenal began an accelerated disposal program, injecting the deadly substance deep into the ground of central Arkansas. However, the increased disposal activity caused a collection of earthquakes to hit the area. It is important to note that Iraq’s phosgene poisonous gas stocks are no longer able to be made by any Western country, including the United States. It has been speculated that the direct reason for John Wheeler’s murder was that he uncovered information about an accident involving the phosgene. The Russian report states that a U.S. Air Force KC-767 tanker aircraft experienced a critical malfunction of its aerial spraying computer command while transporting phosgene poisonous gas to Afghanistan. The error caused the plane to release phosgene into the air, killing birds and fish. The accusations have been called absurd by U.S. government officials.\nOn December 9, 2009, a strange phenomenon was witnessed over Russia, and photographed in northern Norway and Sweden. The event began when a blue light soared up from behind a mountain in the north end of Russia. The light stopped in mid-air, and then began to move in circles. Within seconds a giant spiral had covered the entire sky. Once expanded, a green-blue beam of light shot out from the center of the object, lasting for ten to twelve minutes before disappearing completely. Thousands of onlookers described the event.\nOne account indicated that the object appeared as a giant fireball which traveled around in circles. It had a powerful light that surrounded its center, and some shooting star visuals. The pictures and video of the bizarre event quickly spread over the Internet, and were accompanied by many claims that the lights looked like a path to another dimension, similar to one that you would see in the movies. After the story was published all over the world, the Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged a failed test of a RSM-56 Bulava missile, on the day in question. It has been suggested that the phenomenon was the result of the failed missile test.\nApparently, the missile failure caused the exhaust of the projectile to travel out sideways, sending the object into an uncontrolled spin. However, people have proclaimed that the event looks like a wormhole opening up, and that the occurrence has been linked with the recent high-energy experiments undertaken at the Large Hadron Collider, in Switzerland. Many Intellectuals have voiced a problem with the official explanation of a failed missile launch, stemming from the fact that the event was sustained for so long. Some have gone so far as to draw connections with the famous Project Blue Beam conspiracy theory, which involves a NASA plan to trick the world population into believing in extraterrestrial life, using high powered lasers that are often mistaken for UFOs. Others suggest a secret government weapons test involving the HAARP program or a Russian equivalent.",
