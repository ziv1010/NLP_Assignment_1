  "body_text": "Arsenal forward Beth Mead bagged a brace against Leicester City in front of 42,820 fans at the Emirates\nJUST shy of 43,000 supporters saw Arsenal secure the Women’s Super League’s third and final Champions League place on Sunday with a commanding 3-0 win over Leicester City.\nA Beth Mead brace sandwiched either side of an Alessia Russo goal was enough to send the 42,820 fans who had packed into the Emirates Stadium home happy.\nPraising another big Ashburton Grove crowd, Russo said: “It’s incredible. Every single time we play here, they come through in numbers and they’re so loud.\n“I think the growth in the women’s game is massive. And I think you can stop saying that people don’t want to come to women’s football anymore because they want to know about it. Come down to Arsenal, as we do it week in, week out.”\nGunners boss Jonas Eidevall echoed such views, adding: “It’s always magnificent coming out here and playing in front of the supporters. Again, they were amazing, they create such a nice atmosphere. So, thank you for being a part of this club.”",
