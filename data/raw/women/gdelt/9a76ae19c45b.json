We’ve got action on The Hill this afternoon and this evening, but not before we give our kudos to some top-notch showcases from the weekend.\nNow, what all is steeping in today’s Brew?\nSeason finale of Eric Musselman Live\nHave a weekend, Jared Wegner\nAnd much, much more!\nSigning off for now. Head inside Sassy’s one last time for the 2023 season, and hear Coach Muss breakdown his team’s recent games, and the upcoming path to the NCAA Tournament. Plus, Nick Smith Jr. and Jalen Graham join the program to discuss their year as Razorbacks.\n> SLUGGIN’ AIN’T NOTHING. Just ask an Oklahoma State fan.\nThe transfer from Creighton began his Razorback career with four extra-base hits and drove in eight runs during the College Baseball Showdown, wherein the Hogs won two games. Jared’s opening weekend was more than enough to be named the SEC Player of the Week.\nJared and Arkansas now turn their attention to Grambling. The Razorbacks will host the Tigers at 3pm this afternoon for their home-opener at Baum-Walker Stadium. If you can’t make it to the game, don’t fret. 17 consecutive home games are set to follow.\n> TO THE MOON. Arkansas women’s golf sits at seven-under-par after two days of the Moon Golf Invitational in Melbourne, FL. The Razorbacks shot a four-under 284 Tuesday with the help of a three-under 69 from Kajal Mistry. The senior climbed 11 spots to a tie for eighth place entering the final round today. Click here for a full recap of Monday’s action.\n> HIGHLIGHTING THE HIGHS. Just like that, Razorback softball has already played 10 games and won eight of them. Last weekend’s Clearwater Invitational saw the Hogs take three games and put together some clean performances. These three individual efforts really stood out to us:\n- Freshman LHP Robyn Herron got her second win of the season in a shutout performance against Indiana. Playing in her hometown of Tampa, Robyn allowed just four hits and recorded 12 strikeouts in seven complete innings.\n- Junior DH Rylin Hedgecock was busy during Saturday’s doubleheader as she hit a homer in each game. Six of the Hogs’ 13 runs scored on the day were driven in by Rylin.\n- Junior 1B Cylie Halvorson capped off a productive weekend with a four-RBI outing against Nebraska. She’s one of three Razorbacks to have at least 10 hits on the year thus far.\n> PLAN AHEAD. Now’s the time to mark your calendars. Arkansas’ Family Weekend is set for September 9 when the Hog football team plays Kent State, and Homecoming is locked in for October 21 when the Razorbacks host Mississippi State. Click here to learn more about each weekend.\n> DAWG-FREE HOUSE. Just two home games remain for Arkansas men’s basketball, and one goes down tonight. The Razorbacks are hosting Georgia in the second of back-to-back games inside Bud Walton Arena, and that’s historically good news for the home team. Arkansas is 12-3 against Georgia all-time in Fayetteville.\nTipoff is set for 8pm and the game will be televised on SEC Network. Be sure to watch the latest edition of Courtside With Eric Musselman to get set for the matchup.\nStraight from the source. Hogs+ senior contributor Clay Henry joins the show to talk all things baseball after a solid opening weekend for the Razorbacks. And Z’s here with his preview of the men’s basketball team’s game against Georgia tonight.\nDid someone send you the Razorback Brew?
