These games may be chosen as a “flex pick,” a dynamic programming feature that allows the most compelling Southland matchup to be elevated into a prime national broadcast slot, showcasing the conference’s excellence on a broader stage.\nAt the same time, fans can enjoy the full Southland experience on ESPN+ and the ESPN App, where a robust lineup of high-quality, school-produced broadcasts offers nonstop action and front-row access to hundreds of events across every sport throughout the season.\nA major highlight of the new agreement is the guaranteed national television exposure for two marquee Southland basketball games during Champ Week: one Men’s Basketball Semifinal and the Women’s Basketball Championship Game on ESPN platforms.

This places the league on one of the sport’s most visible early-season stages and builds on the momentum of already scheduled Week Zero contests, such as the 2025 game between Incarnate Word and Nicholls on ESPN2. These opportunities further elevate the Southland’s national presence and showcase its football programs to a broad audience.\nThe Southland Conference was founded in 1963 with institutions including Lamar, which has spent 49 years in the conference. The 12 current full-time members have an average tenure of 25 years, providing remarkable stability.\nThe Southland comprises 12 schools within a driving range of the states of Louisiana and Texas as the conference celebrates regionality in college athletics the “Gas Tank League,” making it more accessible and more manageable for family, friends, and fans to travel to away contests.\nThose 12 institutions include East Texas A&M University in Commerce, Houston Christian University, the University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, Lamar University in Beaumont, McNeese State University in Lake Charles, the University of New Orleans, Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, Stephen F.
