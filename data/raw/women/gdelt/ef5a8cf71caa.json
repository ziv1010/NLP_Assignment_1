  "body_text": "Locked Up in 2025: 120 criminals who were jailed this year\nMore than 800 people have featured in our monthly round-ups of people who have been jailed for the most serious crimes in Wales\nMore than 800 criminals have been locked up for the worst crimes in Wales over the past year. Every month we feature the people who have been jailed for the most serious crimes in Wales in a round-up.\nIn 2025 those round-ups included a man who strangled his partner and left her to lay dead in her own faeces, a teenage girl who stabbed two of her teachers and a woman who defrauded an elderly couple out of £150,000.\nThey also include a man who murdered his housemate by attacking him with two knives and a paddleboarding instructor who organised an excursion which left four people dead. One of the most upsetting cases was the sentencing of Michael and Kerry Ives, who murdered their two-year-old grandson Ethan. Ethan died in 2021 after suffering a catastrophic brain injury. At the time of his death, he was severely dehydrated and malnourished, and had more than 40 visible injuries on his body.\nThere was also a shocking number of men jailed for violent attacks against women. One of them was Daniel Wide, who laughed while he threatened to rape his ex-partner before he completed the sick act in her home.\nLast year we featured another 800 criminals in our monthly round-ups of criminals put behind bars for some of the most serious crimes. They included murderers, drug dealers, domestic abusers, paedophiles, dangerous drivers, and other criminals. You can see the worst crimes that were committed in 2024 here.\nJanuary - 78\nIt was a busy start for the courts in 2025 with with 78 criminals locked up during January. They included a man who murdered his best friend in what was described as a \"savage attack\", a murderer who killed a defenceless pub-goer and a pair who attacked and killed a festival worker outside a Swansea hotel.\nThere was also a dog owner whose XL Bully dog attacked a young girl and took a \"chunk\" out of her arm, and a driver who hit a pram outside a hospital killing a baby.\nDylan Thomas\nHe was sentenced to a minimum of almost two decades in jail after he murdered his housemate in a savage attack at their home. Dylan Thomas, 24, repeatedly stabbed William Bush, 23, on Christmas Eve 2023 at the house they shared in Llandaff, Cardiff.\nThomas is a member of the enormously wealthy Thomas family and his grandfather, Sir Stanley Thomas, has interests in several businesses including property and the famous family food firm Peter's Pies. A trial at Cardiff Crown Court previously heard Thomas had attended the Powys private school Christ College Brecon with William Bush and that the pair had been \"lifelong friends\".\nMr Bush, who had been planning to move out of their house to live with his girlfriend, suffered fatal injuries when Thomas attacked him with two knives on December 24, 2023 at their Ty Mathew home.\nChristopher Cooper\nThe murderer told a judge to \"go f*** yourself\" after he was jailed for life for killing a defenceless pub-goer in a \"cowardly attack\". Kelvin Evans, 64, was left gravely ill in hospital after being attacked by Christopher Cooper outside The Station Hotel in Gorseinon in May last year and died a month later.\nCooper admitted manslaughter but denied murder, claiming Mr Evans had been the aggressor and had threatened to \"glass\" his girlfriend over her performance at the karaoke machine - though he refused to give evidence to the jury at Swansea Crown Court. During a trial in November 2024 prosecution barrister Andrew Jones KC called Cooper's claims \"ludicrous\" and \"an insult to everyone’s intelligence\".\nThe 39-year-old was convicted of murder and his partner, 54-year-old Tracy Francis, was convicted of assisting an offender for her role in trying to cover up the killing.\nMacauley Ruddock and Joseph Dix\nThe pair murdered a festival worker in a \"two-on-one\" assault outside a Swansea city centre hotel. Dix and Ruddock were sentenced to life in prison for repeatedly punching Andrew Main in the head as he lay unconscious on the pavement, then claimed they had been acting in self-defence.\nDix and Ruddock were convicted of murdering 33-year-old Mr Main following a two-week trial at Swansea Crown Court. You can read our coverage of the trial here.\nJustin Allison\nJustin Allison owned an XL Bully dog weighing up to eight stone that attacked a young girl and took a \"chunk\" out of her arm in a horrifying incident. The animal had escaped from its Allison's home and was later euthanised in police custody.\nThe dog, named Rocco The Dude, got free due to a lack of a gate in the back yard of Allison's Nantyglo home. A 12-year-old girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was getting out of her father's car on October 7 2024 when the XL Bully approached her and growled.\nJason Bradford\nThe drink-driver killed his front seat passenger and seriously injured his rear passenger after flipping his car and colliding with a concrete fence. He was disqualified from driving at the time of the collision and had drunk around five pints of lager in a pub beforehand.\nJason Bradford had been out drinking at the Junction Inn in Hengoed, Caerphilly, with Callum West and Ryan Waters on November 14, 2020. Later that day, Bradford flipped the silver Renault Clio he was driving and caused the death of Mr West, who was pronounced dead at the scene, and seriously injured Mr Waters.\nBridget Carole Curtis\nShe killed a baby outside a Welsh hospital when she drove a total distance of 28 metres, mounted a kerb and crashed into a pram. Bridget Carole Curtis, 71, was dropping her daughter off for an appointment at Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, on the morning of June 21, 2023 when the incident occurred.\nCurtis, from Begelly, Pembrokeshire, stopped her white BMW 520 automatic car near the hospital entrance. Her daughter got out of the vehicle and went to the rear door to retrieve her handbag. Unable to see the bag, she tapped on the window to get the attention of Curtis, who turned around to look for it herself. At this point the car began to move forward. Read the sentencing here.\nKenneth McGonagle\nThe violent thug threatened to cut his partner's head off and was described as \"frothing at the mouth\" and with his \"eyes going dark\" before attacking her. He went on to fracture her arm after he had been released on police bail.\nKenneth McGonagle, 40, seriously assaulted his partner on two occasions while he was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. A sentencing hearing at Cardiff Crown Court heard he has previous convictions for assaulting former partners and also rape.\nLucy Paginton\nShe defrauded an elderly couple in their 80s who helped raise her out of £150,000 by creating false documents to suggest she was purchasing a house with their money. In reality, she was using the money on staying at the Celtic Manor, travelling and buying expensive clothes.\nPaginton, 28, of Newport, was partially raised by her victims, Jack, 88, and Mary Hillier, 90, from the age of two, and they described thinking \"highly\" of her, and trusted her with their finances. It later transpired that their trust in her was misplaced. Read more here.\nFebruary - 69\nThe list of 69 jailed in February include a man who brutally attacked his partner by biting her face and a woman who tricked her way into the home of an elderly man before throttling him with string and stealing his money.\nThere was also a workplace bully who left one of his colleagues in a coma after an assault.\nGareth Morgan\nThe violent bully left his partner's life a living hell after he repeatedly unleashed horrific assaults upon her during which she thought she was going to die. His extreme jealousy led him to strangling the victim as well as punching her to the face during his campaign of abuse.\nGareth Morgan, 29, of Aberdare, isolated her partner from her friends and family and forced her to cut them out of her life. She felt unable to tell them about the true nature of their relationship during which he subjected her to appalling fits of rage and assaults of a serious nature.\nSheila Sampson\nShe tricked her way into the home of an elderly man and throttled him with a length of string and beat him about the head with a heavy glass ashtray before stealing his money. As Sampson's vulnerable victim lay bleeding on the floor she emptied his wallet and even searched his trouser pockets for loose change.\nSwansea Crown Court heard Sampson has a history of committing violence, weapons, and dishonesty offences, and at the time she robbed the pensioner in his own home she was out of prison on licence following a previous conviction for robbing a man in the street then falsely claiming he had been one of her \"punters.\"\nAllan Harries\nHe left his wife with severe swelling to her face after throwing her to the floor and stomping on her head. She did not seek medical treatment for a number of days out of fear of her husband.\nAllan Harries, 43, attacked his wife at their home in Bridgend on March 9 last year after an argument broke out between them at breakfast. The defendant accused her of drinking too much the night before and she asked him to stop the argument.\nPaul Lewis\nThe paedophile carried out a \"campaign of sexual abuse\" against a girl which began when she was \"just a little girl\". He went onto rape her \"violently\" and left her struggling for decades with feelings of \"shame and self-hatred\".\nLewis, 72, carried out repeated sexual assaults against the victim over several decades after grooming her by gaining her confidence. He was described as a committed \"paedophile\" who left his victim with significant mental health difficulties and her attempting to take her own life. Read his sentencing here.\nJordan Crewe\nThe violent thug brutally attacked his partner by biting her on the face and strangling her while she was driving. He was controlling during their relationship by telling her what to wear, hiding her make-up and preventing her from seeing her family unless he was there.\nJordan Crewe, 27, caused his victim to make an attempt on her own life after she was subjected to controlling and coercive behaviour during their relationship. Bail conditions were placed on the defendant but he breached this to abuse and assault his partner.\nEthan Owen\nThe \"dangerous offender\" with a series of sexual offences sent two young girls sexual content on WhatsApp whilst asking them to do the same. Ethan Owen, 30, was at the time a registered sex offender for life and under a sexual harm prevention order.\nProsecutor Martha Smith-Higgins told Cardiff Crown Court Owen had been on a Fortnite game with two primary school-aged girls after they were added to the game. He subsequently added them both to a WhatsApp group named \"bad\" where he could see they were clearly children from their profile pictures.\nLogan Welch\nThe thug armed himself with a bottle of wine and attacked a man with a child's baseball on his own doorstep to the point he was beaten unconscious. He continued hitting him after the victim pleaded with him to stop due to him having children.\nLogan Welch, 34, brutally assaulted Lee Willmott outside the victim's home in Newport on May 5 last year. They had both been drinking at Bailey's public house where there had been an altercation between them which was broken up by others.\nJake Pinhorn\nA woman was drugged by the convicted sex offender who shaved her pubic hair and raped her while she was unconscious. He also sexually assaulted her with a sex toy which left her in pain worse than childbirth.\nJake Pinhorn, 33, met his victim on an online dating site and went on to sexually abuse her at a hotel in Caerphilly after forcing her to drink a green liquid. She was knocked out as the defendant committed a number of sexual acts upon her designed to humiliate her. Read his sentencing here.\nNicholas Walsh\nThe workplace bully seriously assaulted a colleague by kicking him to the chin and neck and caused him injuries which left him hospitalised and in a coma. As a result of the attack, the victim will have to take medication for the rest of his life.\nNicholas Walsh, 54, unleashed an unprovoked attack upon Shaun Davies at Pritchard's in Llantrisant on September 17 last year. The defendant was said to have carried out \"protracted bullying\" towards the victim which a judge described as going further than \"workplace horseplay\".\nLogan Harding\nHe kidnapped his girlfriend, bundling her into a car before he led police in a chase which resulted in him crashing into a tree. The victim was left \"frightened\" and \"in hysterics\" during the incident.\nLogan Harding, 31, had been in a relationship with the victim for seven weeks and had been out shopping together on December 1 when an argument took place between them. Later that day, the victim attended the Pandy Inn pub in Tonypandy when the defendant turned up.\nMarch - 72\nThe list of 72 criminals locked up in March include a man who beat and strangled his son's partner to death leaving her naked on the kitchen floor. There was also a man who killed his former work colleague in a fight about who could take a better punch and a \"disgraced\" vicar who sexually abused a young boy.\nRichard Jones\nRichard Jones brutally murdered his son's girlfriend in her own home before placing a set of keys on her naked body and casually driving away. He then went about his morning's business, ordering a new debit card at the bank and buying a custard slice from a bakery.\nJones later contacted his ex-partner and told her he had \"sorted\" the problem he had with his son's girlfriend and had \"erased\" it. But when arrested the 50-year-old claimed not to remember what had happened in Miss Evans' Llanelli home – a stance he maintained during his subsequent trial at Swansea Crown Court. After deliberating for less than three hours a jury found him guilty of murder.\nJason Thomas\nHe killed a former work colleague in an argument about which of the pair could take a punch better. Jason Thomas was jailed for the manslaughter of Liam Morgan-Whittle after a night out in Llanelli.\nPolice and paramedics attended a property in Robinson Street in the early hours of Sunday, March 25, 2023, where they found Mr Morgan-Whittle gravely ill. The 22-year-old was taken to hospital but could not be saved.\nSwansea Crown Court heard the pair had argued over who could withstand the most punches. Despite a friend telling Thomas to \"leave it\" the 40-year-old killer said: \"I'll hit you first\" and the victim's last words were: \"Go on then.\" Thomas then threw two ferocious punches causing Mr Morgan-Whittle fatal injuries.\nAnthony Pierce\nThe Church in Wales responded to the jailing of a former vicar and senior bishop for sexually abusing a boy by saying he inflicted \"appalling and lasting trauma\" on his victim and had \"disgraced the church\". Anthony Pierce was a parish vicar in Swansea in the 1980s when he subjected the young boy to a campaign of sexual abuse.\nPierce subsequently went on become one of the most senior clerics in Wales as the Bishop of Swansea and Brecon. By the time police were informed of Pierce's crimes he had resigned from his position.\nNicholas McMurray\nThe train manager sexually assaulted an 18-year-old woman after he asked to check her ticket. The incident happened on a Great Western Railway (GWR) service from Cardiff to Swansea when Nicholas McMurray assaulted the teenager who had been travelling to Swansea to get picked up.\nMcMurray assaulted the teenager, who is now a student, in June last year. The incident started outside of Swansea when McMurray approached the woman in an isolated section of the train near the carriage doors and began inquiring about whether she’d bought a ticket. He then began touching her and moving her skirt to “gauge whether a sexual assault would be feasible”, a sentencing hearing at Swansea Crown Court heard.\nDean Murray\nThe dangerous driver deliberately drove into three people standing on the pavement after acting inappropriately towards them. The victims required treatment in hospital after being struck by the vehicle in which the man drove off following the collision.\nDean Murray, 29, had been out drinking and taking cocaine in Blackwood town centre on November 13, 2022, when he began bothering a group of women. They did not want to interact with the defendant and he was told to leave\nThomas Edwards\nThe \"pathetically childish\" and jealous man controlled his partner's life then hit her with a horse whip after learning she would be working with a male colleague.\nDuring their \"toxic\" relationship Thomas Edwards cut his partner off from family and friends, insisted on having access to her social media accounts, and made her send him videos from work to prove who she was interacting with. Read his sentencing here.\nDaniel Fuge\nThe primary school teacher pretended to be a teenage girl to trick two young boys into sending intimate images and video of themselves. Daniel Fuge's crimes left the boys \"broken\".\nThe 38-year-old posed as a 16-year-old girl to trap the boys. He incited one boy aged 13 to send a video of himself carrying out a sex act. He then incited a second boy, 14, to send naked photographs of himself.\nRoisin Hannon\nShe poured her drink over her a former boyfriend's head then glassed him in the face in a busy bar. Roisin Hannon had confronted her ex about money she said he owed her before she \"lost it\" and hit him with the glass.\nA judge at Swansea Crown Court said the victim suffered \"significant injuries\" in the incident and said such glassing attacks could easily result in someone losing an eye. Hannon's barrister said his client was \"disgusted and mortified\" by what she did on the night in question and said such behaviour was out of character for the defendant.\nGrantham Jones\nHe was described as \"crawling around Swansea\" in the dead of night looking for drugs when he attacked a woman he had picked up in his car. Grantham Jones repeatedly punched the woman in the face as part of a series of events a judge called \"truly disturbing\".\nJones' barrister told Swansea Crown Court that the defendant \"deeply regrets\" his actions on the night in question and said his client has a partner and a job at a coal merchants to return to. Speaking after the sentencing police said 37-year-old Jones \"clearly took pleasure in enacting violence against a defenceless victim\". Read his sentencing here.\nLiam Lewis\nThe \"sexual predator\" arranged to meet someone he thought was a child under 13 in order to sexually abuse and rape her. He also offered to supply the decoy with crack cocaine and sent sexual images to them.\nLiam Lewis, 31, of Ferndale, was convicted of attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child and attempting to arrange/facilitate the commission of child sex offence – rape/assault by penetration of child under 13. Read his sentencing here.\nApril - 97\nThe list of 97 people who were jailed for the most serious crimes in April include a man who strangled his partner to death and left her to lay in her own faeces.\nThere was also a former head teacher who attacked the deputy head at his school in a jealous rage. A 14-year-old girl was sentenced for trying to murder two teachers and a pupil in an attack where she stabbed them with a knife while screaming \"I'm going to kill you.\"\nAlcwyn Thomas\nHe strangled his partner to death and was convicted of murder after claiming it was a sex game gone wrong. Alcwyn Thomas killed Victoria 'Vicki' Thomas after drinking heavily and taking cocaine but had denied murder saying the pair regularly enjoyed adventurous intercourse including strangulation.\nVicki Thomas was found dead on the floor in her son's bedroom on the top floor of the house the couple shared in Cardiff last August wearing a dressing gown. She had suffered injuries consistent with being strangled and was found lying in her own faeces.\nThomas showed little emotion as he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 20 years. Read the full story from his sentencing here.\n14-year-old girl\nThe teenager tried to murder two teachers and a pupil at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Ammanford when she was just 13. The pupil took her dad's multi-tool to school and used it to stab deputy head Fiona Elias, teacher Liz Hopkin, and a female pupil during the school's morning break on April 24 last year.\nDuring the trial at Swansea Crown Court the jury heard that the girl approached Mrs Elias in the school yard and said: \"I’m going to f****** kill you\" before stabbing the deputy head in the arms with the knife. When Mrs Hopkins intervened and tried to restrain the girl the teenager turned on her and stabbed her to her neck, back, legs, and arms. The teachers said they thought they were going to die during the attacks.\nShe was given a 15-year-sentence and will be eligible for release at the halfway point when she is likely to be 21 years old. But she will remain on licence until she is nearly 30 years old. The girl cannot be named for legal reasons.\nNerys Bethan Lloyd\nThe paddleboarding instructor was jailed after four people drowned during an excursion on a river in southwest Wales. Nerys Bethan Lloyd, a former police officer, organised a stand-up paddleboarding tour on the River Cleddau in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, in October 2021 despite “extremely hazardous conditions” and weather warnings in place.\nLloyd failed to warn the group about a weir on the route or how to navigate it. The participants were swept over with some becoming trapped under the fast-moving water. Paul O’Dwyer, 42, Andrea Powell, 41, Morgan Rogers, 24, and Nicola Wheatley, 40, all died.\nLloyd, 39, pleaded guilty to four counts of gross negligence manslaughter. She stared straight ahead as the judge sentenced her to 10 years and six months in prison.\nAnthony John Felton\nThe head teacher attacked his deputy head with a large spanner-like tool in jealous rage. Footage played to the court showed then-head teacher of St Joseph's Roman Catholic Comprehensive in Aberavon Anthony John Felton, 54, manoeuvring assistant head teacher Richard Pyke in front of his computer. He then took a weapon discreetly out of his jacket pocket and swung it towards Mr Pyke's head.\nShocking footage of the attack received audible gasps from the public gallery when it was shown. Felton continued to swipe at Mr Pyke with the weapon – only stopping when a staff member rushed into the office after hearing screams for help.\nThe judge told the ex-head he had badly damaged the reputation of a good school with his actions on the morning in March this year. Felton was sentenced to two years and four months behind bars, at least half of which he'll serve in custody.\nMark Jones\nHe sexually abused four young girls in a string of historical offences which were committed against the victims, the youngest of which were just six years old.\nAfter raping a girl when she was nine Mark Jones, 65, told his victim: \"It's the way of life – I'm showing you the way of life\". He went on to rape her a second time to \"satisfy his own sexual needs\" and gave her money not tell anyone.\nA sentencing hearing at Cardiff Crown Court heard the offences came to light after one of the defendant's victims contacted the police. There were four victims in total who were sexually abused by Jones when they were children.\nDaniel Wide\nThe dangerous rapist laughed while threatening his ex-partner before he completed the sick act in her home. The victim described how the actions of Daniel Wide, 33, have left her feeling “dead inside” and traumatised.\nThe victim, who bravely decided to waive her right to lifelong anonymity to allow the press to report the court proceedings in detail, used her mobile phone to audio record his behaviour \"so that she wouldn’t forget what he said to her the next day”. Cardiff Crown Court heard that on the recording, Wilde \"can be heard telling her he had people watching her…He [threatens to rape her] and says: ‘There is nothing you can say about it.’ He calls her a ‘b*tch’.”\nWithin seconds of the recording ending prosecutor Martha Smith-Higgins told the court how Wide pulled some of the victim's clothes off, pushed her on the bed, and raped her. She said the attack lasted five minutes and the victim experienced “nine out of 10 pain” which she later described as \"excruciating\".\nDaniel Hale\nHe stripped his partner naked before biting and suffocating her. Daniel Hale, 26, then told her to get dressed so they could go back to the pub. The woman was found running around the street in her underwear after Hale had forced her into the passenger seat of his car.\nProsecutor Amelia Pike said the defendant bit the victim three times on the chin and once to her left cheek. She attempted to get Hale off of her and shouted: \"Get off me\". He responded by putting one hand over her mouth and one hand over nose, suffocating her for five seconds. Hale suffocated her again 20 seconds later as she screamed for help.\nIn a victim personal statement read to the court the victim said she has been left \"in a constant state of fear, anxiety, and emotional exhaustion\" as a result of the attack. The judge described the attack as \"extremely violent\".\nEbony Jones\nShe sobbed in the dock as she was jailed for glassing her former best friend in a shocking attack in a packed bar in Caerphilly. Mother-of-two Ebony Jones, 26, shattered the half pint glass across the face of support worker Megan Smith in a drunken row over the sale of a dog.\nThe victim needed 36 stitches to her face and five more to her nose. In a victim impact statement Miss Smith said the attack had left her with permanent scarring and she was now known as \"Megan Scar\" around her hometown.\nShe added: \"Ebony has betrayed me in the worst possible way – she has ruined my life. I just can’t believe she assaulted me. She was my best friend.\"\nHarry Davies\nA teenager himself, he raped a teenage girl who was extremely intoxicated and asleep when she was attacked.\nThe victim said she was \"so vulnerable\" on the night she was attacked by Harry Davies, now 20, adding: \"I hate you for what you've done. I can't fall asleep because in moments of silence I think about what you did which plays through my head.\"\nHe was sentenced to five years and three months detention in a young offenders institute.\nJacob Ewing\nThe paedophile from the USA sexually abused a girl from Wales over the internet and controlled every aspect of her life. Jacob Ewing, 44, became obsessed with her and flew to Wales in order to meet her but he was detained by the authorities who found him in possession of knives and a cosh.\nHe began speaking to his victim when he was just 15 years old and pressured her into filming herself carrying out sexual acts. He would also tell her what to wear, what to eat, and made her film herself on a livestream to his device while she was asleep.\nMay - 82\nThe list of 82 people who were jailed in May include a teenager who murdered a dad-of-seven after an argument between a former couple.\nThere was also a former teaching assistant who was caught with child abuse images. A man was also jailed after killing a beloved grandmother as she walked home for bingo, leaving her on the floor and going to the pub after he knocked her over.\nCorey Gauci\nThe teenager was sentenced to life in jail for murdering a father-of-seven in Cardiff after an argument between a former couple. Colin Richards bled to death after being stabbed in the top of his right thigh by Corey Gauci, 19, in April last year.\nMr Richards, 48, suffered fatal damage to the femoral artery and vein. Gauci had become involved in an argument between a former couple which saw two groups travelling to an area of Ely in Cardiff, some armed with knives.\nGauci will serve a minimum term of 24 years in prison. Mr Richards' partner said she dreads having to explain what happened to him to her children, adding she has told them \"daddy is a star in the sky\".\nStephen Hindley\nHe subjected a young girl years of sexual abuse and \"effectively bought her silence\" with bribes of cigarettes and money. Stephen Hindley was a college security guard when he began to abuse a girl who was just nine years old.\nThe abuse would continue into her teenage years. The victim said her memories of her childhood are \"darkened by the abuse\".\nHindley was arrested over 12 years ago but skipped court bail and went on the run. He was caught by an off-duty police officer who recognised him in Llanelli town centre.\nDylan Edmunds\nThe father-of-two killed a 76-year-old woman when he reversed into her while she was walking back from the bingo. Dylan Edmunds, 27, from Mountain Ash, fled the scene and returned to the pub after seeing he had run someone over.\nEdmunds later told his mum he had felt a \"bump\" and got out his car to see a person lying on the floor. The victim, Wendy Setterfield, was described by her family as a \"charismatic, kind-hearted and sociable\" woman who would be missed by many.\nPerry McCarthy\nHe subjected a young girl to a \"campaign of rape and sexual abuse\" over a number of years which left her \"helpless, terrified, and ashamed\". Perry M Perry McCarthy, 65, of Penarth, carried out a series of rapes and sexual offences against the victim, which began when she was of primary school age. It started when the defendant asked the girl for a hug and made her wear a blindfold to conceal what he was doing.\nCardiff Crown Court heard McCarthy made the victim touch his penis and masturbate him until he ejaculated. The victim bravely read her own victim impact statement to the court.\nShe said she now lives with \"chronic anxiety, nightmares, and a constant feeling of unease\" as a result of his abuse. There was applause in court as the paedophile was handed a lengthy jail term.\nSteven Loveridge\nThe \"determined paedophile\" played a \"warped\" game of chance to dictate his sexual offending. Steven Loveridge had a set of coloured dice where the different colours represented the ages of the children involved while modified playing cards contained categories such as \"follow\", \"girl incoming\" and \"girl in radius.\"\nSwansea Crown Court heard Loveridge had also researched the movements of children and compiled maps and detailed notes showing the routes young girls took around his local communities, the schools they attended, locations such as parks and shops where they went and his \"escape routes\" which avoided CCTV cameras. Individual girls he had been monitoring were given nicknames in his notes such as \"Ponty Lollipop Girl\" and \"My Little Pony Girl.\"\nPolice described the 60-year-old as a \"monster.\"\nDean Hanford\nHe sold horrific images of children and babies being sexually abused and raped to like-minded people. It is not know how much Dean Hanford made from what a judge called the \"vile\" trade but police were able to get hold of data from online payment system PayPal which showed amounts being credited to him.\nThere was evidence he had been sharing the material with others and boasting in messages that he had \"tons\" of images which we was selling for \"£30 for over 100\". Sending the 23-year-old graduate from the Afan Valley to prison a judge told him: \"These were real babies somewhere in the world being tortured so people like you can masturbate over the images.\"\nTracie Harrison\nHer Staffordshire Bull Terrier \"chewed\" the arms and legs of a woman who she had attacked. The woman suffered significant injuries and permanent scarring and spoke of how she is now \"petrified\" of dogs.\nTracie Harrison, 47, was in charge of her dog named Fade when she and another woman attacked Michelle Pring in Cardiff in May 2023. It was during this attack that Fade began attacking the victim, and locked its jaws on her arms and legs, leaving her with multiple puncture wounds.\nThe defendant and the woman continued to attack Ms Pring and did not assist her as the dog continued to bite her. Harrison has 13 previous convictions, including for an offence of being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control and causing injury in 2015.\nThomas Morgan\nHe armed himself with a baseball bat and fractured his victim's skull in a brutal attack in front of his mother. It was described as a \"revenge attack\" after he claimed he found messages from the victim on his partner's phone.\nThomas Morgan, 35, attended the home of Christopher Holly in Tredegar at 7.30am and banged on the door, before assaulting him - \"motivated by rage\". In a victim impact statement he told the court: \"If the door knocks it puts me on edge and I also get more nervous about the door knocking if my kids are at the address with me...\"\nVictoria King\nShe was jailed for stealing over £100,000 from her employer for the second time. Victoria King, was jailed in 2014 for stealing £130,000 from a charity she worked for but she got a new job and did the same thing again, while failing to declare her conviction.\nMerthyr Crown Court heard that King - who is also known as Vikki Phillips - was already on a £45,000-a-year salary but paid herself an extra £7,500 a month by fiddling the books and creating payments to what looked to be a genuine supplier but was in fact herself.

He told police his motto was: 'Hit first, ask questions later'.\nAfter attacking the victim, Thomas also smashed up the Brynamman flat before stealing his phone, leaving him unable to call for help. The victim said he believed Thomas was intending to kill him during the assault and that the hours he spent drifting in and out of consciousness afterwards had been terrifying.\nAlex Rickwood\nHe was jailed for killing “most beautiful, caring” grandmother when he mounted the pavement she was jogging along. Catherine Bradford died at the scene after Alex Rickwood lost control of the MG ZR car he was uninsured to drive in Dowlais.\nRickwood, now 32, was described by witnesses as driving “like a lunatic” as he failed to negotiate a sweeping bend while driving well above the 30mph speed limit.

She helped her boyfriend by accessing sensitive data on the police national computer, which she passed on to him and he then passed on to his associates.\nA sentencing hearing at Cardiff Crown Court heard Langmead also accessed information to feed her own \"morbid\" curiosity, including information on the murder of five-year-old Logan Mwangi in the early stages of the investigation. Sending her to prison, the judge said she had \"done serious harm to policing and the public interest.\"\nDean Bradley\nDNA found on a schoolgirl's underwear led to this respectable \"family man\" being unmasked as a \"monster\". Dean Bradley abused a primary-school aged girl and his offending came to light when the girl's mum noticed a \"yellow-white discharge\" on her daughter's knickers.\nThe concerned mum spoke to the girl who broke down and made disclosures about the defendant performing sex acts on her and showing her \"sick, weird\" videos of people having sex.

The trio, aged between 23 and 25, had never previously been in trouble but their actions on a night out have landed them in jail.\nConnor Loddo, Adam Ford and Unotidashe Nikisi decided to attack George Clark in July 2022 on St Mary Street, Cardiff. CCTV footage showed them circling the victim, who had little chance to defend himself, before they dragged him to the floor.\nOnce Clark was on the floor the men took it in turns to kick Clark and stamp on his head in a horrific incident which could have killed him.

Rutherford was sentenced to 28 months in prison.\nJemma Lewis\nThe accountant stole more than £2.4m from the companies she worked for while receiving a salary of £200,000. Lewis, 40, stole millions from the company where she'd worked for over 10 years in order to fund her gambling addiction.\nNewport Crown Court was told Lewis's actions caused considerable stress to other members of staff, causing one director to leave, another to lose out on his salary, and one woman unable to access her pension. It also meant the companies she worked for didn't contribute enough tax. Lewis was jailed for five years.\nJack Llewellyn\nA driver killed his long-term partner and left a five-year-old child with a permanent scar to his face after an \"utterly appalling piece of driving\".

William Chiplin, a 21-year-old from Abergavenny, attacked the child on multiple occasions while he was between 15 and 17.\nChiplin showed the child pornography to \"normalise\" sexual behaviour and then forced her to strip naked before raping her. The abuse came to light when the girl became \"visibly distressed\" while watching TV. After being pressed on what was wrong she confided in her mother describing how Chiplin had \"hypnotised\" her, made her watch sexual videos, and rubbed against her while she held a unicorn toy.\nThe mother of the girl said: \"The abuse stole not only her innocence but her sense of safety, trust, and stability. She now carries an anxiety that no child should ever have to carry – one that seeps into her relationships, her sleep, her education, and her view of herself.\"\nJordan Wright\nHe pulled out a kitchen knife and threatened to kill a paramedic who attempted to assist him after he had become unconscious. Jordan Wright, 28, told her: \"I am going to kill you and cut you up\".\nWright was treated by a paramedic after he was found lying unconscious in the street in Tonteg near Pontypridd.

Abdul Kadir repeatedly abused the girls on multiple occasions in the prayer room of his house.\nThe judge told 54-year-old Kadir, of Penlan, Swansea, he had caused the girls \"unspeakable mental and physical harm\" and said while the courts encounter such cases far too, often rarely do the facts reveal \"such depths and depravity\" as Kadir's.\nBoth the complainants in the case were girls aged under 13. Kadir ensured the silence of his victims by making a series of threats including that if they told anyone what was happening they would end up in a brothel. The court heard he told one of the children that if she reported what was going on she would no longer be able to wear her hijab or eat halal food.\nKerry Price\nThe computer expert was handed an extended sentence as a dangerous offender for repeatedly sexually abusing a young girl and secretly taking intimate photos of her.

He began speaking to the girl on Snapchat when she was aged 13 and he was 19.

Shannon Ives covered up what was being done to her son and was complicit in the abuse, a court heard.\nThe judge said: “She knew that Ethan was at risk of being killed and had seen evidence of Michael opening Ethan’s mouth and taking the food out before he could swallow. She knew he could no longer walk or talk as he had done before.”\nGuy Simmonds\nThe horse-riding instructor is a \"manipulative sexual predator\" who poses a risk to young females, a court was told. Former showjumper Guy Simmonds abused a vulnerable young girl after arranging a \"so-called threesome\" with Lauren Jarvis and a child who was under 16.\nBoth Simmonds and Jarvis were found guilty of one count of engaging in sexual activity with a child.

She also said she had to deal with being called a “liar” by others after the matter had been reported to the police.\nThe judge said Simmonds was \"clearly the ringleader in all this\" and had manipulated both the complainant – \"a vulnerable and socially isolated young person\" – and his co-defendant Jarvis.

All his victims were aged under 13 with the youngest being five.\nA judge said the 74-year-old had a \"cloak of respectability\" which disguised the fact he was a paedophile. One of the victims told the court she had lived the years since the abuse with \"a heavy weight on my shoulders\" and felt guilty she had not come forward earlier.\nShe said Hughes had made her feel \"dirty and cheap\" and as a result of what he had done she had grown up \"viewing men as predators\".\nNovember - 72\nThe 72 people jailed in November range from a teenager who preyed on elderly and vulnerable women while pretending to be a masseuse to a woman who smashed a bottle against a bin and used it to stab a man in the neck in the middle of a busy shopping street.\nThere was also an abusive boyfriend who stabbed his partner in the leg with an eight-inch kitchen knife and killed her cat by repeatedly punching it.\nJimmy Tawse\nThe teenager preyed on elderly and vulnerable women while pretending to be a masseuse and a window cleaner.
