We will never forget the kindness and care you’ve shown, our gratitude is endless.”\nAfter Friday’s game – which Angel City won 2-0 with goals from Christen Press and Alyssa Thompson – both sets of players joined each other in a circle to offer a prayer for King.\nAlthough some players appeared affected by King’s collapse, the match resumed after King was taken off the field, a decision which was questioned by Utah head coach Jimmy Coenraets.\nKing – who was selected by Bay FC with the second overall pick in the 2024 NWSL draft – has started all eight games for Angel City this season, having joined the club in February.\nPrior to entering the NWSL, she played for the University of North Carolina and made multiple appearances for the US youth national teams at the under-17 and under-20 levels.\nCNN’s Jamie Barton contributed to this report.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",
