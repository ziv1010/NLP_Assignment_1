  "body_text": "Former Canberra United star and Matilda, Grace Gill, has called upon media to take greater responsibility in stopping misogynistic attitudes toward females in sport in the wake of the Marty Sheargold controversy.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nTriple M Radio \"mutually parted ways\" with Sheargold on Wednesday after the announcer made sexist, rude and lewd comments about the Matildas and women's sports during a news segment about Australia's performance in the She Believes Cup in the USA.\nGill, who played nearly 10 years in the W-League and is now a respected soccer commentator, was shocked but unsurprised at the behaviour of Sheargold and his co-hosts live on air.\n\"I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It's out-and-out misogynistic remarks,\" Gill said on 10 News. \"It's incredibly disappointing.\"\nGill demanded people in media - particularly men - to raise their standards in how they report and discuss women's sport, with a responsibility to not allow incidents like the one involving Sheargold to occur unchecked.\n\"It's about how we talk about these teams and people in those teams. When you've got this continual negative narrative and misogynistic comments around female sport, that's why the perception is what it is,\" she said.\n\"It's accountability of men in those moments pulling up other guys making those kind of comments, and saying that's not quite right and let's re-engage how we're actually talking about women's sport and sport in general.\"\nSheargold compared the Matildas to \"year 10 girls\" in reference to \"friendship issues and infighting\", he joked about the tournament saying, \"she believes in what? It better be men\", and said any criticism about him undermining the code should \"stick it up your arse\".\nWhile Gill said it was important to be critical of the Matildas performances, Sheargold's comments missed the mark by a long way.\n\"That [year 10 girls] comment is particularly derogatory,\" she said.\n\"The [She Believes Cup comment] was surrounded by laughter by the other hosts in the room, which is so disappointing, because you hope in those moments that someone goes, 'Hey guys, let's turn this conversation in another direction'. But again, just completely misogynistic behaviour.\"\nSheargold's ugliest moment came when a co-host mentioned the next big tournament for the Matildas, next year's Asian Cup, where Sheargold said: \"I'd rather hammer a nail through the head of my penis than watch that... got any men's sport?\"\n\"This is where it gets pretty ugly,\" Gill said.\n\"It's not just misogynistic, it's completely tone-deaf.\n\"It lacks any critical thinking, and it's a space where you think you're a media personality with a platform surrounded by women who consume this - young women as well - and you think that kind of comment is okay to make about anyone? It's an awful, awful comment.\"\nGill argued that Sheargold was only apologetic in the aftermath of the radio segment receiving widespread criticism from Matildas players, Football Australia, the players' union Professional Footballers Australia and even Sports Minister Annika Wells and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\nInterim Matildas coach Tom Sermanni weighed in too.\nREAD MORE:\n\"As sporting teams, we're used to criticism, but sometimes the comments cross the line,\" he said.\n\"It was completely unnecessary and generally outrageous. It's something that from a behavioural perspective, is really very disappointing.\"\nThe Matildas lost all of their matches to Colombia (2-1), Japan (4-0) and the USA (2-1) at the She Believes Cup in the States.\nThe next time the Matildas play will be in April in Sydney and Newcastle for a two-match series against Korea.\nOn Saturday afternoon Canberra United take on Melbourne City with Matildas striker Michelle Heyman returning from international duties for the match at McKellar Park.",
