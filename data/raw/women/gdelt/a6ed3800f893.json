  "body_text": "Last week, Tottenham Hotspur Women earned their first win since January 2025 against West Ham, although they showed signs of the same difficulty scoring from open play that dominated the conversation last season. Today, playing against Everton at Goodison Park, they showed no such offensive frailty. Spurs got a well-worked goal from midfielder Olga Ahtinen and a spectacular long-range shot from new signing Tika Tandberg, and put in another defensively stout performance to stay unbeaten in WSL play.\nEverton 0-2 Tottenham Women: Ahtinen, Tandberg fire Spurs to big win at Goodison\nIt’s pretty noticeable how different Spurs look this season compared to last, with basically the same team. Having Kit Graham back from injury helps certainly, and the two new signings of Toko Koga and Tika Tandberg look extremely astute, but something has changed from this year and last, and a lot probably has to do with new manager Martin Ho.\nSpurs are one of four teams that have maximum points from two games, along with Manchester United, Arsenal, and Chelsea. Feels pretty good!\nHere are my match reactions from today’s game at Goodison Park.\nLineup\nMatch Reactions\n- Goals: Ahtinen (27’), Tandberg (49’). Subs: Lena Gunning-Williams/Ahtinen (64’), Charlotte Grant/Rybrink (74’), Kit Graham/Tandberg (83’)\n- Final xG (FotMob): Everton\n- Spurs were unlucky not to score in the opening ten minutes. After a flurry of corners, Clare Hunt directed a header that fell right at the feet of Drew Spence, who had her point-blank shot saved. It was, ironically, the first shot on target for Spurs this season after they didn’t register one in the 1-0 win over West Ham last weekend. (Beth England scored a PK for the winner)\n- Spurs look a LOT more dynamic offensively, and it was on full display with the first half goal by Olga Ahtinen. Good progression and passing to get the ball wide to Jessica Naz; her central cross wasn’t great but it took a heavy deflection off an Everton player, Tinka Tandberg was able to poke the ball to Ahtinen central, and Olga slotted home. A bit fortunate maybe, but it was the result of a well-worked play.\n- The press is dramatically improved this season under Martin Ho. They’re not only pressing, but pressing high and effectively; Spurs created numerous turnovers in the first half and forced Everton into sloppy passing, limiting their buildup from the back. This is an Everton team that flattened Liverpool last week, so.\n- Last season Beth England dropped deeper to receive the ball (much like Harry Kane used to) because it was the only way she could get on the ball. This season Ho has made that ability into a feature, with Tandberg playing high and England as a deeper support striker, almost a false 9.\n- Everton didn’t muster a ton of offense in this one and the rare times they created a half-chance Tottenham’s defense rallied with a key block or tackle. Hunt and Koga are already looking like a formidable defensive pairing.\n- Spurs’ second goal was INCREDIBLE. Beth England pressed high and forced the turnover, the ball fell to Tandberg who recognized the keeper was off her line, and she put a long range high arcing shot that just squeezed in under the bar. Amazing goal, and excellent awareness from both Spurs attackers.\n- Related, this is the first real look we’ve gotten at Tika Tandberg, and she is a unit. Didn’t realize how tall she is, and she uses that body size and strength to her advantage. Early days, but she could be a real important signing for Spurs.\n- Everton tried to get their punches in and had a few moments of danger, but it never really felt like Spurs were going to concede. Toko Koga was really tested in this one by Ornella Vignola, who had a hat trick last week, and Kelly Gago. Koga got beat to the end line a couple of times, but her teammates were able to mop up whatever she let behind her. Considering she’s just 19, it was an encouraging performance.\n- 2-0 actually feels generous to Everton — their keeper Brosnan had some impressive saves down the stretch to keep Spurs from running up the scoreline.\n- I was very excited by the signing of Maite Oroz last season, and it’s interesting that while we’ve seen Kit Graham come in as a sub twice now, we have yet to see Oroz off the bench. Maybe there’s an injury, or maybe Ho sees something I haven’t seen yet.\n- Considering the way Spurs have played to start this season with basically the same team, my new fan-fiction based on nothing but vibes is that everyone must have hated Bob Vilahamn last season. Martin Ho appears to be getting a tune from these players.\n- In addition to starting the season 2-0, Spurs have also yet to concede a goal. They host Manchester City next Friday, sooooooooooooo that’s probably going to change. But who knows!",
