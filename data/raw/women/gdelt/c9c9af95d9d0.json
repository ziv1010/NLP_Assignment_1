At least in coaches’ minds.\nLonghorns Daily News: Is Iowa State Texas’ Big 12 ‘trap game’ in 2023?\nPlus: A bigger than big night for Texas ball\nIt’s something worth keeping Texas Longhorns fans up at night as we head into the 2023 regular season. 247Sports suspects that the Iowa State Cyclones have the potential to be Texas’ Big 12 trap come later this year.\nFrom 247Sports: “It’s OK, Longhorns fans: there’s no Oklahoma State on the Texas schedule this year. Instead, we turn to November, where Texas hosts Kansas State, travels to TCU, then heads to what should be a cold, windy day in Ames in mid-month. Texas returns home to play Texas Tech in Austin the next week for not just Senior Day, but also potentially a game needed to lock up a spot in the Big 12 title game. Remember: an offense-challenged Iowa State team threw a real scare into Texas in Austin last year, and while the Longhorns should be better this year, so should Iowa State.”\nWHAT THEY’RE SAYING ABOUT THE LONGHORNS\nAssociated Press: Mansfield Lake Ridge alum Jasmine Moore sets NCAA record while Texas women win track title\nAustin American-Statesman: Texas celebrates its volleyball team’s championship at the White House\nAustin American-Statesman: Bohls: Texas women’s team, Julien Alfred nailed it at NCAA outdoors\nAustin American-Statesman: How Ackelia Smith, Texas’ mindset let to an NCAA track championship\nInside Texas: On Texas Football: Are the Longhorns a more cohesive unit in 2023?\nICYMI IN BURNT ORANGE NATION\nRECRUITING ROUNDUP\n247Sports: The Stampede: Previewing the upcoming official visit weekend\nInside Texas: D’antre Robinson could be the next Longhorn out of Orlando\nInside Texas: IT Roundtable: Game-by-game predictions for the 2023 Texas Longhorns\nInside Texas: Steve Sarkisian hasn’t reaped the rewards of the portal... yet\nInside Texas: Latest on On3’s No. 1 2024 athlete Terry Bussey\nInside Texas: Jordan Washington will be hosted by Ja’Tavion Sanders this weekend\nInside Texas: Inside Scoop: Latest intel on 2024s mid-OV season, 2025 standouts camp at Texas\nBIG 12 BREAKDOWN\nAustin American-Statesman: New BYU president Shane Reese thrilled with reception from Big 12\nInside Texas: On Texas Football: The biggest non-conference games for the Big 12 this season\nFrogs O’ War: Baseball: TCU sweeps Indiana State to win NCAA Fort Worth Super Regional\nFrogs O’ War: Baseball: Klecker leads TCU over Indiana State in NCAA Super Regional opener\nWHAT WE’RE READING\nSB Nation: PGA Tour LIV Golf deal prompts U.S. Senate probe into Saudi’s Public Investment Fund\nSB Nation: Saquon Barkley to skip New York Giants minicamp this week as he awaits a new deal\nSB Nation: Tom Brady had quite the sports weekend\nNEWS ACROSS LONGHORN NATION AND BEYOND\n- It’s now or never (in 2023) tonight for Texas baseball.",
