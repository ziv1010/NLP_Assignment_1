  "body_text": "Trump: Biden is a sick, weak, pathetic man\nDonald Trump warned of “slaughter in the suburbs” and called Joe Biden a “sick, weak, pathetic man” in his first rally since surviving an assassination attempt last weekend.\nThe Republican presidential nominee had promised “unity” for the United States in the wake of his shooting in Pennsylvania last Saturday, which shocked the country and triggered a surge in support for Trump in opinion polls.\nMr Trump had this week urged his supporters to dial down their rhetoric to focus on national consensus amid a divisive US election race.\nBut at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Saturday night, Trump returned to his usual combative style – and at times dark tone – as he railed against the “radical Left Democrats”, accused his opponents of “rigging” the election and calling Mr Biden “crooked”.\nHe also goaded Nancy Pelosi over reports that she has advised Mr Biden to quit the election race, accusing her of turning on the president “like a dog”.\nIn a lengthy, near-two-hour speech that appeared largely to be improvised, Mr Trump also resumed his claims that South and Central American countries are sending their criminals to the US.\n“They’re dumping their criminals in the United States, and we’re not gonna take it anymore,” Trump said, prompting a standing ovation from the crowd as he promised to deliver the “largest deportation operation” in history.\n“When I return to the White House, we will stop the plunder, rape, slaughter and destruction of our American suburbs and cities.”\nTrump took to the stage on Saturday alongside his vice-presidential running mate JD Vance.\nHe appeared without the large, white bandage that he wore over his ear at this week’s Republican convention, instead wearing a small plaster.\n‘I took a bullet for democracy’\nThe former president, 78, was struck in the ear by a would-be assassin in an attack he told the party’s convention he would not speak about again because it was “too painful”.\nBut on Saturday, Trump retold the story of how the bullet from Thomas Matthew Crooks’ AR-15 struck his ear.\nHe cracked jokes about the shooting, saying how immigrants saved his life, referring to the immigration chart that he turned to look at in the seconds before he was fired upon.\nHe used the moment to hit back at Democrat assertions that he is a threat to democracy.\n“I took a bullet for democracy,” he said, to rapturous applause.\n'They keep saying 'He's a threat to Democracy'… What the Hell did I do to Democracy?'\n'Last week, I took a bullet for Democracy.'\nDonald Trump🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Yes This!!!\npic.twitter.com/oXgAsQg7yN— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 20, 2024\nMichigan is one of the vital swing states in the US election and has become even more important since the attempt on Trump’s life, with recent polls showing a chunky swing towards the former president, much to the alarm of Democrats.\nRepublican momentum is in stark contrast to the mire around President Biden, who remains hunkered at home with Covid, resisting unprecedented Democratic pressure to step aside.\n“They have no idea who their candidate is,” Trump said.\n“This guy goes and he gets the votes, and now they want to take it away. That’s democracy,” he told the 12,000-strong crowd of passionate supporters.\nPelosi is ‘crazy as a bedbug’\nTrump mocked Kamala Harris, the vice-president, amid reports she is being pushed forward by Democrats to replace Mr Biden.\n“We will take back the White House from crooked Joe Biden and Kamala,” Trump said. “I call her laughing Kamala. You ever watch her laugh? She’s crazy. You know? You can tell a lot by laughter. She’s crazy. She’s nuts.”\nTrump earned one of the biggest laughs of the night when he criticised Ms Pelosi over reports she has turned on Mr Biden.\n“Did you see Nancy Pelosi is selling out now? Did you see she turned on him like a dog?” Trump said.\n“Where did that come from? She was 100 per cent and all of a sudden she’s not sure. She’s crazy as a bedbug.”\nTrump denies any knowledge of Project 2025\nTrump also defended himself against claims from the Democrats that he and his allies want to instigate Project 2025.\nThe project is based around an ultra-conservative instruction manual setting out proposals for Trump’s second term in the White House.\nIt contains plans to restrict abortion access, deport immigrants en masse, and sack thousands of civil servants in favour of political appointees, among other ideas.\nTrump has claimed not to know anything about the document, despite many of its proposals matching his own priorities, and despite being mentioned in the document several hundred times.\nHe told the crowd: “I’m not an extremist at all. Some on the Right, the severe Right, came up with this Project 2025 and I don’t even know... I mean, some of them, I know who they are, but they’re very, very conservative, they’re sort of the opposite of the radical Left.\n“I don’t know what the hell it is. I mean, they’re seriously extreme, but I don’t know anything about it. I don’t want to know anything about it.”\n12:37 AM BST\nThank you for joining us\nThat’s it for Trump’s speech – thank you for joining our live coverage.\nRead more on our top US election stories today:\n12:17 AM BST\nTrump enjoyed every moment of that\nTrump’s rambling remarks ran for over 1hr 45mins.\nHe finished by telling the audience he would “make America great again”, before slowly wandering around the stage to soak in the applause.\nIt may have been lengthy and meandering, but you can tell Trump enjoyed every moment of that speech.\n12:12 AM BST\n‘We will make America great again’\nWith a familiar refrain, Trump closes his speech.\n“We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God and, together, we will make America powerful again.\n“We will make America wealthy again.\n“We will make America strong again.\n“We will make America proud again.\n“We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.\n“Thank you very much. Thank you, Michigan. Thank you very, very much. Thank you.”\nHe turns to all sections of the arena, waving and clenching his fist.\n12:10 AM BST\n‘American dream will thrive again’\nTrump now appears to be wrapping up.\n“The American dream will be thriving again for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed,” he says.\n“Law and Justice will reign all throughout our land. Freedom will be restored. The flame of liberty will be burning bright, crooked Joe Biden, the worst president of the history of our country, will be a fading memory of the past, and our great silent majority, including the once forgotten men and women of our country, will be the one shaping America’s magnificent future.\n“When I am the 47th president of the United States.”\n11:59 PM BST\nLonger than Thursday’s speech\nTrump’s speech has now gone on for longer than Thursday’s 93-minute address at the Republican convention.\n11:56 PM BST\nTrump points out key ally\nTrump has thanked a raft of people in the audience, including his daughter Tiffany and her husband Michael.\nHe also heaped praise on Michael’s father, Massad Boulos, the Lebanese-born businessman, who Trump said is also at the rally.\nMr Boulos has turned out to be an important ally for Trump. He has taken on the challenge of trying to convince the politically influential Arab community angry at Joe Biden over his response to the war in Gaza to vote for Trump.\n11:49 PM BST\nPelosi ‘turned on Biden like a dog’\nNow Trump is goading the Democrats, who are locked in a civil war over the ailing Biden campaign.\nIn the past few days, senior Democrats including Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and Barack Obama have reportedly indicated that Mr Biden ought to consider quitting the race.\n“We will take back the White House from crooked Joe Biden and Kamala,” Trump says.\n“I call her laughing Kamala. You ever watch her laugh? She’s crazy. You know? You can tell a lot by a laughter. She’s crazy. She’s nuts.\nBut Trump gets a big laugh for attacking Ms Pelosi and mocking her for reports she has turned on Mr Biden.\n“Did you see Nancy Pelosi is selling out now? Did you see she turned on him like a dog?” Trump says.\n“Where did that come from? She was 100 per cent and all of a sudden she’s not sure. She’s crazy as a bedbug.”\n11:36 PM BST\nSo much for ‘unity’\nThere has been little evidence of Trump toning down his attacks on his political rivals in the wake of last week’s attempted assassination.\nSo far tonight he has railed against the “radical left Democrats”, accused his opponents of “rigging” the election and called Joe Biden a “sick, weak, pathetic man”.\nHe also rolled out one of his favourite insults: that Mr Biden is “crooked”.\nMany Republicans blamed the Democrats’ rhetoric after the attempt on Trump’s life.\n11:32 PM BST\nDeportation gets a huge cheer\nOne of the biggest rounds of applause this evening came when Trump promised to deport migrants.\n“They’re dumping their criminals in the United States, and we’re not gonna take it anymore”, Trump said, prompting a standing ovation from the crowd.\nFans wearing bejewelled MAGA hats stood and cheered as Trump promised to deliver the “largest deportation operation” in history.\n11:32 PM BST\nFake election, fake indictments\nNow Trump attacks Democrats for stealing the 2020 election and setting up rigged trials against him.\n“Every time the radical Left Democrats, Marxists, communists and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honour. You know, I’ve been indicted more than the legendary Alphonse Capone Scarface.\n“These aren’t indictments. These are Biden indictments. This is a sick, weak, pathetic man who can’t run an election, so he indicts his opponent, thinking that’s going to win.”\n11:29 PM BST\n‘Slaughter in the suburbs’\nCrime is clearly something Trump thinks he can win on and his rhetoric is very dark.\n“In Oakland County [in Michigan], criminal squads of illegal alien gang members are hiding in the trees and breaking into Michigan homes after dark, looting them for jewellery, purses, taking the women’s purses right out of their bedrooms, electronics, cash they’re stealing,” he says.\n“Does anybody live in Kent County here? Sounds good to me, but you’re not going to like this: a sadistic illegal alien, of which there are many criminals, was sentenced for executing a 22-year-old Red Rapids woman while she was in her car with a one-year-old baby, shooting her at least five times with a rifle at point-blank range while the killer was wanted on an outstanding warrant for attempted strangulation of another woman.”\nHe adds: “When I return to the White House, we will stop the plunder, rape, slaughter and destruction of our American suburban cities.”\n11:26 PM BST\n‘We want safety’\nTrump now jokes that crime is so bad in the US that next year the Michigan rally will be held in Venezuela.\n“In Venezuela, crime is down 72 per cent, you know? Caracas, Venezuela, was a very, very dangerous place, and now, because of the great job they’ve done in removing their criminals into the United States, next year, we’re going to have our Michigan rally in Caracas, Venezuela, because it’s nice and safe.\nHe then gets one of the biggest cheers so far when he says foreign countries are “dumping their criminals into the United States and we’re not going to take it any more.”\nTrump adds: “That is why, as soon as I take the oath of office, we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country, even larger than that of President Eisenhower.”\n11:17 PM BST\nTrump apologises for his hair\nTrump gets the biggest laugh so far with a joke about his hair.\nHe stops mid-flow as he’s attacking ‘Bidenomics’ to tell the crowd to look up at the big screen.\n“That’s very severe that combover,” he says, and the crowd laugh. “That’s a severe sucker. What’s with that one? It looks OK from the other side,” he says, turning his head to the right, “but that is very severe. I apologise.”\n“I looked up there. I said, ‘Whoa, look at that. Wow, that’s like a work of art.’”\nHe later adds, as he speaks about a policy to stop taxing workers’ tips, that he doesn’t tip his barber.\n“I don’t give mine a big tip because I don’t think they do a very good job,” he jokes.\n11:14 PM BST\nI would duck, says unconcerned Trump supporter\nLast week the crowd sitting directly behind Trump were directly in the line of fire.\nFormer fire chief Corey Comperatore, 50, had a prime spot in the rows behind the former president when he was killed by a bullet intended for Trump’s head. Two other supporters are in critical condition after they were struck when gunman Thomas Crooks opened fire on the Pennsylvania rally.\nBut the supporters behind Trump today appear anything but concerned about their safety. They are waving their “Trump Vance” placards, laughing at his jokes and cheering on cue - even as Trump strays from tangent to tangent.\nWhen asked if he was scared following last week’s chilling attack, supporter Tim Dolan told me: “I’ll duck”.\n11:03 PM BST\n‘We’re leading Michigan by six points’\nOK, he’s back to talking about politics.\nHe hails new polls in Michigan that put him well ahead of Biden.\n“We’re leading Michigan by six points,” he says, and the crowd screams.\n“And a report just came out, actually we’re leading everywhere and nationally, that we have to keep it that way.”\nHe then refers to his often repeated and untrue claims that the Democrats stole the 2020 election.\n“Gotta make sure they don’t cheat,” he says. “Gotta make sure they don’t cheat.”\n10:59 PM BST\nOn the TRUMP index, this is about an 8\nAt the moment Trump’s saying something about electrocution and heavy boats and death by sharks.\nHe’s known for his rambling speeches and Trump is so far providing a classic of the genre.\nLet’s call it the ‘TRUMP index’ – the Trump scale of Really Unscripted Maga-y Ramblings.\nIf his 2016 inauguration speech was a 1, for teleprompter tightness, and his Republican speech on Friday was about a 6, with plenty of waffle, this is more like an 8 or 9 so far.\n10:55 PM BST\nImmigration saved my life, Trump jokes\nTrump is cracking jokes about attempted assassination and the crowd is eating it up.\nDemonstrating how he turned his head to look at a board showing immigration statistics, Trump gestured with his arms, saying: “the thing [bullet] went that way instead of that way”.\n“I owe immigration my life”, he said.\n“That sign is very good I think I’m going to sleep with it tonight”, he added, prompting huge cheers and laughs from the audience.\n“I hope we have to never go through that again everybody”, Trump said\n10:52 PM BST\nTrump: Musk is as smart as they get\nTrump is now hailing Elon Musk in a slightly rambling bit about electric engines.\nHe says: “You know, he’s a very advanced person, and he’s doing other things that are great, and so are other we have to make we have to make life good for our smart people. You know, we have some smart people. We have to make life good for us smart people, and he’s as smart as you get.”\nTrump then thanks Musk for his commitment to spend $45 million a month on his campaign.\n“Not $45 million, he gives me $45 million a month,” Trump says.\n“I talked to him just a little while ago to say I was coming here. And he didn’t even mention it. He didn’t mention it.\n“The other guys, they give you $2 and you got to take them to lunch. You got to wine them, dine them... No, he’s a great guy. He really is.”\n10:49 PM BST\nTrump talking about the shooting\nDespite telling the Republican convention on Thursday that he would never again speak about the attempt on his life because it is “too painful”, Trump is again talking about how he turned his head at the right moment to avoid the bullet that struck his ear.\nReferring to the immigration chart that he turned to look at in the moments before he was fired at last Saturday, Trump says: “I would have never been looking to the right, and I had to be. It was the only place that would have saved us.\nThey do these reports in The New York Times and all over the place where they had, you know, the shape, the ‘if he turns this way, this way’...\n“I hope we have to never go through that again. Everybody is just so horrible.”\n10:44 PM BST\n‘I took a bullet for democracy’\nThe former US president hit back at Democrat assertions that he is a threat to democracy.\n“I took a bullet for democracy”, he said, to rapturous applause.\nThe latest reference to his attempted assassination came after he tried to hold a “poll” to see which Democrat candidate the audience would prefer him to run against.\nThe crowd hoovered it up, loudly booing both options - Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.\n10:42 PM BST\nTrump addresses ‘Project 2025’\nTrump now defends himself against claims from the Democrats that he and his allies want to instigate Project 2025.\nThe project is based around an ultra-conservative instruction manual setting out proposals for Trump’s second term in the White House.\nIt contains plans to restrict abortion access and widen free-market control over US society, among other ideas.\nTrump has claimed not to know anything about the document, despite many of its proposals matching his own priorities, and despite being mentioned in the document several hundred times.\nHe tells the crowd: “I’m not an extremist at all. Like some on the Right, the severe Right, came up with this Project 2025 and I don’t even know, I mean, some of them, I know who they are, but they’re very, very conservative, they’re sort of the opposite of the radical Left.\n“I don’t know what the hell it is. I mean, they’re seriously extreme, but I don’t know anything about it. I don’t want to know anything about it.”\n10:35 PM BST\n‘Who would you like to run against?’\nTrump now says he will help the media by doing a free poll in the room, asking the crowd who they would rather run against: “Crooked Joe Biden” or Kamala Harris?\nLoud boos greet each name.\n10:32 PM BST\nBandage-free Trump relishes applause\nTrump walked out slowly on stage, soaking up the cheers from the crowd of some 12,000 supporters.\nChants of “USA, USA, USA” filled the arena and a sea of MAGA fans pumped their fists in the air as Trump entered the venue.\nThe former US president appears to have ditched the white ear bandage he was sporting at the RNC in Milwaukee.\nTrump joined his running mate, JD Vance, on stage, whispering in his ear before claiming the packed-out audience was like a “football game”.\nThe Republican nominee noted that the timing of the rally was a week ago “almost to the hour, even to the minute”.\nHe then repeated his previous claims that he “shouldn’t be here” and is only alive because “something very special happened”.\n10:31 PM BST\n‘They have no idea who their candidate is’\nTrump gets in his first dig at Joe Biden and the Democrats, saying the party does not even know who their candidate at the election will be.\n“Now we have something coming up where they’re going to go through the convention, and they have a couple of problems,” Trump says, getting a big laugh from the crowd.\n“Number one, they have no idea who the candidate is. That’s a problem, but we’ll see. Hopefully they get it worked out. Sort of interesting.”\n10:29 PM BST\nTrump pays tribute to dead firefighter\nTrump pays tribute to Corey Comparatore, the firefighter who was killed shielding his family during the assassination attempt on the former president last Saturday.\n“He was a big Trumper, and we will never forget him, right?” Trump says. “We’re all together. We’re all together. This is there’s never been anything like what you witnessed the other day with the convention. I don’t think there’s ever been a convention where there was such unity and love.”\nThe crowd chants: “Corey, Corey, Corey.”\n10:24 PM BST\nTrump is no longer wearing his bandage\nTrump does not appear to be wearing the white bandage he had on his ear at the Republican convention.\nHe says: “Let me begin this evening with a very special thanks to Americans nationwide, including all of you here today, for your extraordinary outpouring of love and support in the wake of the horrific last Saturday event.\n“When you think of it, it was exactly one week ago today, almost to the hour, even to the minute.\n“What a day it was. As I said earlier this week, I stand before you only by the grace of Almighty God. That’s true. I shouldn’t be here.”\n10:21 PM BST\nHere he comes...\nDonald Trump is out now, walking slowly to the stage, milking the massive applause.\n“Well, thank you very much,” he tells the crowd. “This is like a Michigan football game over here.”\n10:16 PM BST\nVance is back...\nJD Vance is walking on stage now to a raucous reception.\nIn a bit of a bait-and-switch, he says he is coming on to introduce Donald Trump... and the crowd erupts. But Vance continues: “Before I do that... Sorry, I had to screw with you a little bit, right?”\n10:03 PM BST\nOur existence depends on US vote, says Ukrainian MP\nUkraine believes its physical existence depends on the outcome of November’s US election after Donald Trump’s selection of JD Vance as his potential vice president, an MP has warned, Liz Cookman writes.\nTrump’s choice of the Ohio senator as his running mate has fanned fears that a new Republican government would push Ukraine to acquiesce to Vladimir Putin if elected, withdrawing aid if no peace deal is reached with Russia.\nRead more: Our existence depends on US election result, warns Ukrainian MP\n09:43 PM BST\nAttendees treated to My Heart Will Go On\nAn eclectic selection of music has been blaring through the speakers to keep the energy up at the Van Andel Arena.\nWe’ve had everything from Celine Dion’s My Heart Will Go On to The Winner Takes it All by ABBA.\nThe Trump fans are getting very excited.\nA stadium-wide Mexican wave has gone round the stands a few times with people holding up their “Trump, Vance” and “Joe Biden: You’re Fired” signs.\n09:21 PM BST\nTrump due any minute\nWe are waiting for the former president who is due to take the stage any moment.\nInside the arena, the extremely dodgy Wi-Fi is causing havoc with the TV feed.\nHopefully someone will try the guaranteed method to fix internet trouble – swear at and kick the router – and all will be fine in time for Trump’s speech.\n09:19 PM BST\n‘Vance will harm the US’s global interests’\nJohn Bolton, the former US ambassador to the UN, says Vance is a worrying pick to be Vice-President.\nWriting for The Telegraph, Mr Bolton says the Ohio senator will weaken Trump’s ability to recruit for a second term – and Ronald Reagan would be turning in his grave.\nTrump wants undiluted personal loyalty in his post-election government team, at all levels. Vance craved Trump’s endorsement in his 2022 Senate primary, and his help in that year’s general election. He worked for the past two years to get into Trump’s inner circle, adopting his policies as he went. He has now succeeded. As Chinese Communists describe their relationship with North Korean Communists: Trump and Vance are like lips and teeth.\nRead more: JD Vance is a disturbing choice for Vice-President\n09:00 PM BST\nTrump’s bullet wound is still bleeding\nDr Ronny Jackson, Trump’s former White House doctor, said he “evaluated and treated” the Republican nominee’s injury the night of the assassination attempt.\nIn a letter sent out by the Trump campaign, Dr Jackson said the former president is “doing well”.\n“The bullet track produced a 2 cm wide wound that extended down to the cartilaginous surface of the ear”, he wrote.\nHe added: “There was initially significant bleeding, followed by marked swelling of the entire upper ear.\n“The swelling has since resolved, and the wound is beginning to granulate and heal properly. Based on the highly vascular nature of the ear, there is still intermittent bleeding requiring a dressing to be in place. “Given the broad and blunt nature of the wound itself, no sutures were required.”\nDr Jackson said Trump will have further tests, including a hearing exam if necessary.\n08:54 PM BST\nVance marvels at ‘incredible’ turnout\nJD Vance walked onto the stage to chants of “JD, JD, JD” as he joined the campaign for the first time as Trump’s running mate.\nThe Ohio senator, 39, noted there was an “incredible turnout” for the Grand Rapids rally given this time last week a gunman fired a volley of bullets at the Republican nominee.\n“I find that hard to believe that a week ago, an assassin tried to take Donald Trump’s life and now we’ve got a hell of a crowd in Michigan to welcome him back on the campaign trail”, Mr Vance told the audience at the Van Andel Arena.\nOne woman sat behind Mr Vance looked like she was going to keel over from cheering so intensely.\n“I’ve had such an incredible, blessed week” Mr Vance added. “What a cool thing it was to be asked by President Trump to serve as his running mate and to get out there on the campaign trail.”\nLooking around at the placards bearing his name, Mr Vance added that it’s “still a little bit weird to see my name on the signs.”\n08:52 PM BST\nEnhanced security inside the arena\nThere is enhanced police presence at the Van Andel Arena today in response to would-be assassin Thomas Crooks opening fire at Trump’s last rally.\nJoseph Trigg, 47, Grand Rapids Deputy Chief of Police, told The Telegraph: “President Trump came in 2019 and we had about over 100 bodies so we wanted to at least match that right in light of what happened last Saturday.”\nMr Trigg said they enlisted the help of at least 10 outside agencies to ensure there were more than 100 officers, not including Secret Service, on site to “make sure the venue is safe”.\nThere are police officers on every corner and in elevated positions, he said. “It’s very, very serious”, Mr Trigg added.\nWhile protecting Trump is their “number one priority”, officers also want to ensure Trump supporters and protesters are safe.\n“We just want people to come have a good time, voice their First Amendment rights, and then have everybody leave with a good experience. That’s the goal.”\n08:47 PM BST\nTrump attacker may have used drone\nThomas Crooks may have used a drone to scope the site of Donald Trump’s rally ahead of his assassination attempt, the Wall Street Jurnal reported.\nInvestigators found a small drone in Crooks’s car as they tried to piece together a detailed timeline of what happened. It was discovered alongside explosive devices in his Hyundai Sonata/\nCrooks visited the event site six days before the rally. The New York Times reported he is believed to have flown the drown ahead of the shooting.\nThe 20-year-old, who was technologically savvy, started researching the site on July 3 shortly after the rally was announced and registered to attend four days later.\n08:43 PM BST\nWhy Trump picked Michigan tonight\nThe choice of location for tonight’s rally shows Trump is doubling down on trying to pick up voters in blue wall battleground states.\nMichigan is one of the crucial swing states expected to determine the outcome of this year’s election.\nTrump narrowly won the Great Lake State in 2016 by just over 10,000 votes.\nBut it is one of three states which turned blue in 2020 to help Joe Biden clinch the election.\nGrand Rapids is a historically Republican stronghold that has trended increasingly blue in recent elections.\nTrump will be hoping JD Vance, his newly anointed running mate, will help bolster his support among Rust Belt voters in the state.\nIt’s also an area where Nikki Haley secured a substantial number of votes in the Republican primary in February, a group of voters that both presidential campaigns are now hoping to pick up.\n08:39 PM BST\nTrump set to speak\nWelcome to our live coverage of Donald Trump’s rally in Grand Rapids tonight.\nJD Vance is currently on the stage talking up his new boss – and the former president is due to speak soon.\n05:10 PM BST\nThat’s all for today.\nThanks for following the Telegraph’s live blog.

And Joe Biden gets this,” Ms Kamarck, an expert on the party’s rules, reportedly told 50 delegates.\nIf enough of the 3,896 pledged delegates refuse to back Mr Biden and abstain the convention would be thrown wide open.\nIt would pave the way for around 700 “superdelegates” - an array of senior party officials, members of Congress and governors – to enter the fray.\nThis could see the party coalescing around Vice President Kamala Harris or a raft of candidates throwing their hats into the ring.\n02:57 PM BST\nBiden says he will return to campaign trail next week\nPresident Joe Biden says he’s ready to return to the campaign trail next week, even as a growing chorus of Democratic lawmakers called for him to step aside.\nMeanwhile, after wrapping their national convention in Milwaukee this week, Republican officials, strategists and activists are exuding a confidence not seen in decades.\nDonald Trump on Saturday will hold his first public campaign rally since he was injured in an assassination attempt, with an event in the battleground state of Michigan alongside his new running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance.\n02:29 PM BST\nHow JD Vance became the new king of America\nThe future of the Republican Party, and perhaps the United States with it, is James David “JD” Vance: former US Marine, best-selling author, senator from Ohio and now selected by Donald Trump for potential vice president, writes Tim Stanley.\nTrump had been tempted to go with someone else: Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, a solid conservative who wouldn’t outshine the boss.
