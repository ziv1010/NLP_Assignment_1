His voice was the soundtrack to so many iconic moments and his passion for Gaelic Games came through in every word he spoke.\n“As proud sponsors, we are thrilled to support the launch of this new cup in Mícheál’s memory, which will ensure that his legacy continues to inspire future generations of players and fans alike.”\nThe inaugural National Hurling and Football Leagues, which were started in October 1925 and ended the following spring, were won by Laois in football and Cork in hurling, with Dublin contesting both finals. The first cup for the football league was the New Ireland Cup and was first presented in 1929, with Kerry the inaugural recipients.\nIt seemed appropriate also that Kerry would win the centenary 2025 Allianz Football League Division 1 Final, with a 1-18 to 1-12 victory over Mayo. It would certainly have brought a smile to Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh, a fluent Irish speaker and schoolteacher who hailed from Dún Síon, near Dingle in Kerry.\nIn 1949, young Micheál answered an advert and won a radio commentary\ncompetition held at Croke Park and would go on to assume the mantle of the 'Voice of the GAA' after the retirement of the legendary Micheál O’Hehir, who had commentated on 99 All-Ireland finals.Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh’s first All-Ireland final day role was in 1953, when he broadcast the ‘as Gaeilge’ preview to the All-Ireland finals at 3.20pm from the then RTÉ HQ at Dublin’s GPO and then jumped on his bike and cycled to Croke Park in time for throw-in at 3.30pm. His involvement grew with the establishment of RTÉ in 1962.\nMicheál Ó Muircheartaigh made his last official RTÉ radio commentary in 2010. He saw every All-Ireland football final bar one (1950) from 1948 and every All-Ireland hurling final from 1951 up until 2023.\nJarlath Burns, Uachtarán CLG, captured the importance of the naming of the Corn Mhíchíl Uí Mhuircheartaigh trophy: “An Corn Mhíchíl Uí Mhuircheartaigh is a fantastic trophy that pays a lasting tribute to one of the greatest cultural ambassador’s that Ireland has ever known. Micheál was a man who spent a lifetime devoted to Gaelic games and used his inimitable commentaries to spread our gospel around the globe.\n“I also want to pay tribute to our friends in Allianz for being the inspiration behind this new cup. They are our longest standing sponsors and supporters in the GAA, and this is a trophy worthy of the excellent competition that is the Allianz Football League Division 1 title, which is fought for by the cream of our football talent.”\nIn fact, Allianz has proudly sponsored the Allianz Football and Hurling Leagues for more than 30 years, making it one of Ireland’s longest running sports sponsorships.\nIn 2023, Allianz announced that they were strengthening their ties to Gaelic Games by becoming sponsors of the GAA All-Ireland Senior Football Championship as well as the Camogie Association for three years. Allianz’s passion for GAA and their desire to see the sport grow from generation to generation is the very catalyst for their sponsorship of both the Allianz Leagues as well as Allianz Cumann na mBunscol.\nIn addition to their GAA sponsorships, Allianz proudly supports the Irish Olympic and Paralympic Movements, and are proud allies and supporters of the vital work undertaken by Women’s Aid.\nThe beautifully designed new Corn Mhíchíl Uí Mhuircheartaigh is a bespoke sterling silver GAA trophy crafted by John J Cooke & Co. Ltd and features a replica Allianz Football League medal on the front with the inscription: Corn Mhíchíl Uí Mhuircheartaigh — bronnta ar bhuaiteoirí Roinn 1 de Shraith Náisiúnta Peile CLG.\nIt is a fitting tribute to arguably the all-time greatest analyst of Gaelic sports. Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh’s love of Irish language and culture, his distinctive style, ability to weave anecdotes about players and move seamlessly between Irish and English made his commentaries immensely popular. He passed away in June 2024 at the age of 93, survived by his wife Helena and eight children.\nAllianz has been a steadfast supporter of the GAA for over three decades.
