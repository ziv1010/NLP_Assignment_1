I'm just super grateful and honoured to be part of this.\"\nFowler worked closely with Barbie to create her one-of-a-kind doll, she said: \"I wanted to have my Barbie doll replicate when I feel my most confident self and that for me is when I'm on the pitch playing football.\nFowler, who attended the school in 2018 and took the female soccer team to a Combined High Schools' championship, shot to prominence as a 16-year-old at the 2019 Women's World Cup.\nAfter leaving the A-League Women for Montpellier HSC in France, she signed a four year deal at English Women's Super League club Manchester City and scored an unforgettable goal in the quarter-finals of the Tokyo Olympics.\nThat was all before the 2023 World Cup when the then 20-year-old hit a whole new level as she stepped up for the Matildas in striker Sam Kerr's injury-enforced absence.\nBack in February she played a starring role when the Matildas wrapped up qualification for the 2024 Olympics in Melbourne.\nShe finished Australia's final qualifiers against Uzbekistan with two goals, an assist, her 50th Matildas cap, qualification for her second Olympics and a happy snap with Cathy Freeman.\nThe other celebrated athletes are US tennis player Venus Williams, Canadian soccer player Christine Sinclair, French boxer Estelle Mossely, Mexican gymnast Alexa Moreno, Brazilian gymnast Rebecca Andrade, Spanish doctor and paratriathlon athlete Susana Rodriguez, Italian swimmer Federica Pellegrini, and Polish track and field sprinter Ewa Swoboda.",
