(FOX5) - UNLV women’s soccer team to Colorado State, 2-1, in Thursday night’s Mountain West tussle at Peter Johann Memorial Field.\nWith the result, the Rebels (6-7-2) move to 4-2-1 against MW competition and the Rams (9-3-3) remain unbeaten in conference play at 5-0-2.\nAgainst the league’s highest scoring team in MW matches entering the week, the Scarlet & Gray stood its ground by responding to an early one-score deficit with a second-half goal.\nOn a volley sent toward the box by junior Gianna Newby, her junior counterpart Cadence Whitley stopped on a dime to keep the ball in play near the left post for the ensuing 1-1 equalizer in the 62nd minute.\nThe contest remained tied at 1-1 for nine minutes before CSU found the go-ahead goal in the 71st minute. Despite being out-shot in the contest (18-8), the Rebels were able to close that gap by adding six of their eight shots during their second-half push.UP\nNEXT: The Rebels are back in action at noon on Sunday vs. Wyoming.\n-UNLV-\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.
