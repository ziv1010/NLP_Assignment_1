  "body_text": "TEXAS – Texas Tribune photojournalists documented another year in Texas — one defined by turbulence, perseverance and deeply felt change. From the pink granite dome of the Capitol to student classrooms, immigrant communities, and a river town washed with tragedy, these images capture moments that shaped public life across the state.\nThe photo department works with multiple teams in the newsroom to cover a variety of beats. Every year, we deploy photojournalists — both staff and freelancers — far and wide to form a visual record of Texas, image by image. In December, photo editors sift through thousands of images to give you this special curation of the moments that stuck with us.\nRecommended Videos\nWe’re proud to share this work with you as we look back on the year and step forward into 2026.\nPolitics\nEconomy\nEnvironment\nHill Country floods\nPhotos: After Texas Hill Country flood, grief and recovery take hold\nCommunity members visit Louise Hays Park in Kerrville to look at the damage left behind by the deadly Fourth of July flood in Kerr County.\nBrenda Bazán for The Texas Tribune\nHealth\nImmigration\nEducation\nTexans",
