  "body_text": "The much weaker Tropical Storm Ragasa pushed west along the southern Chinese coast towards Vietnam on Thursday after flooding streets and homes in the economic hub of Guangdong province and causing deaths in Taiwan and the Philippines.\nRagasa churned into the Chinese province, home to tens of millions of people, with winds up to 145 kilometres per hour. The storm made landfall near Hailing Island at around 5pm on Wednesday.\nBy that point, authorities across China had already ordered businesses and schools to shut down in at least 10 cities across the nation's south, affecting tens of millions of people.\nNearly 2.2 million people in Guangdong were relocated by Wednesday afternoon, but local officials later said several cities in the province started lifting restrictions on schools and businesses.\nBy Thursday morning, Ragasa's sustained winds had weakened to a maximum 65kph, and it was forecast to dissipate eventually while remaining a rain threat for Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia.\nVietnam\nIn Vietnam, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh ordered government ministries and local authorities to protect infrastructure, like dams and hospitals, secure fishing vessels and coastal assets, and ready evacuation and search and rescue operations.\nSome flights were cancelled or rescheduled, and workers trimmed trees to avoid wind hazards in the northern part of the country.\nThe Vietnamese weather agency warned that parts of the country’s north could get rainfall exceeding 450 millimetres through Friday evening, as well as flash floods and landslides.\nTaiwan\nRagasa's passage in Taiwan killed at least 14 and injured dozens more when a barrier lake burst in eastern Hualien county, according to regional officials who revised the death toll down from 17 after eliminating duplicate cases.\nAuthorities initially said 152 people were unaccounted for, but later made contact with more than 100 of them and were still trying to confirm the actual number of missing.\nHong Kong\nHong Kong authorities said 101 people were treated at public hospitals for injuries sustained during the typhoon as of Wednesday evening, with more than 900 people seeking refuge at 50 temporary shelters across the city.\nAbout 1,000 flights were affected by Ragasa, the airport authority said, adding that they expected to return to normal operations within the next two days.\nHong Kong's weather service ranked the storm the strongest yet in the northwestern Pacific this year.\nPhilippines\nIn the Philippines, Ragasa left at least 11 dead, including seven fishermen who drowned on Monday when their boat overturned in northern Cagayan province. Two fishermen remained missing, officials said.\nNearly 700,000 people were affected by the onslaught, of whom 25,000 fled to government emergency shelters.",
