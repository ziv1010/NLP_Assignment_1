  "body_text": "The England Women’s football team have released a statement in support of the Spanish midfielder Jenni Hermoso, after she said a kiss from the head of Spanish football federation was not consensual.\nLuis Rubiales has received calls to resign and widespread condemnation for kissing Ms Hermoso on the lips following Spain’s World Cup victory over England.\nIt was expected her would stand down at a general assembly called by the RFEF on Friday but instead claimed he had been the victim of “false feminism”, describing the kiss as a “peck” in a lengthy rant, where he said “I will not resign” five times.\nThe 46-year-old claimed it was “consensual” kiss that occurred during the trophy presentation last Sunday, but on Friday evening Ms Hermoso reiterated: “I want to clarify, that at no time did I consent to the kiss.”\nThe Lionesses have come out in support of Ms Hermoso. In an official statement, the team said that “unacceptable actions” had been “allowed to happen by a sexist and patriarchal organisation.”\nThey wrote: “Abuse is abuse and we have all seen the truth.\n“The behaviour of those who think they are invincible must not be tolerated and people shouldn’t need convincing to take action against any form of harassment.\n“We all stand with you, Jenni Hermoso and all players of the Spanish team.”\nMore than 50 players including Hermoso and her teammates have signed a joint statement demanding Rubiales be sacked, saying they refuse to play for their country again unless he is removed from his position.\nRubiales has separately faced criticism for supporting Spain’s head coach Jorge Vilda after 15 players withdrew from the team citing concerns about the culture under his management.",
