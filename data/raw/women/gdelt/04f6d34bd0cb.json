That's absolutely what we want here.\"\nBorthwick has warned other NRLW teams that the Green Machine women will be a fearsome side to face.\n\"Without giving too much away off here, I think defensively we will be a real strong unit,\" the coach said.\n\"On the back of some really strong defence that gives you the opportunity to play some attacking football.\n\"We've got five home games and when you come down to Canberra to play the Raiders, you know you're going to be up against it defensively and in for a real battle.\n\"We've got some tough games early on which I think is good for us.\"\nIt was a full circle moment for Borthwick seeing the Mounties triumph.\nHe had helped recruit the women's squad before he accepted the NRLW gig in Canberra, but after his departure several players were disappointed he wouldn't be at the helm as they thought.\nIn November, Mounties faced the prospect of not having enough players for the upcoming season, but luckily they were able to find the numbers to keep the team together.\nThen when the Raiders announced that Mounties would be Canberra's NRLW feeder team, Borthwick was ecstatic.\n\"To know we've given some girls an opportunity up there to come here and represent this club, it's huge,\" he said.\n\"There was a lot of belief there and the girls that did come in when there were concerns, they bought into what Mounties were doing.\n\"I'm really happy for them to get the result.\"\nThe grand final win was certainly sweeter for Borthwick after everything that had gone down with Mounties.\n\"When you start coaching you, you have a second family. I always talk about having 20 new daughters,\" he said.\n\"There was definitely a sense of being super stoked to come to Canberra, and hard leaving some girls behind.\n\"But for us to have that feeder club pathway is beneficial to know that I can get back up there and help out.\"\nREAD MORE CANBERRA RAIDERS NEWS:\nThe Raiders have locked in nearly three-quarters of their total NRLW squad, with more player signings to be announced early this week.\nBorthwick is busy planning the Raiders' \"tough\" seven-week pre-season where team bonding as well as training will be a focus.\n\"I'm really happy with how everything has gone so far,\" he said.\n\"The stuff that we want to do right here as a club, as a brand, is to make sure that the experience when players get here is one that they'll never forget, and one that should be spoken about amongst the women's game.\"\nOur journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.
