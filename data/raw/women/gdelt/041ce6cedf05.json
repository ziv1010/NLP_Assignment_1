We type it up, and that team goes away and suddenly it’s all there on film.”\nWhy Coach Nate isn’t exactly popular with fans these days\nMohammed is polite and reserved, very much like the shy equipment manager for AFC Richmond we met in Season 1. Now that Nate has turned into a spiteful rival coach, both the actor and his fans have reservations.\n“This season’s Nate is not my go-to area in terms of my previous acting experience,\" Mohammed says. \"I had a comfort area in Season 1 where I was clumsy, bumbling and slightly awkward.\" Now, “There’s less room for that humor we associated with him, but to go on this journey with Nate is a joy.”\nFans are less philosophical. While being “generally kind,” Mohammed admits there was some “Nate hate” generated by his angry defection to West Ham United. “People do say how the show has helped them through tough times, but they’ll also sometimes add, ‘But you have been quite naughty, haven’t you?’”\nBrendan Hunt’s favorite part about playing Coach Beard\nHunt laughs at the question. “That’s easy,\" he says. \"That I will likely never have to purchase a ticket again to a U.S. men’s or women’s national soccer team match.”\nSo that means he’ll likely be all set for tickets to the 2026 World Cup, which will unfold in Canada, Mexico and the U.S.? “That’s why we’re doing all this, man, don’t jinx it!”\nBut jokes aside, he is genuinely pleased with the way the soccer community has embraced “Lasso” and its almost sacrilegious tale of an American football coach entering that world. “It’s incredibly gratifying. Of any group that has a right to stomp their feet and say ‘No, this is wrong,’ it’s the soccer illuminati. But they dig it, and that’s great.”\nHannah Waddingham’s workout\nWaddingham’s brassy team owner Rebecca is known for her sartorial flair, her longing for a romantic partner and a killer physique that emphasizes her sculpted arms.\nBut don't be fooled by Rebecca's outwardly collected appearance. “As Season 2 ended, she wound down something beautiful in her life,\" her relationship with young player Sam (Toheeb Jimoh), she says. “But I thought, ‘Hang on, I know my girl, there’s still a hot mess going on in there.”\nThe actress credits a writer’s room packed with “fierce feminists and female writers\" for Rebecca's honest introspection. As for her buff figure, she waves her hand. \"I recently had a little back operation on a bulged disc, so I’ve done no fitness at all for a year.\"\nWhy is ‘Ted Lasso’ set in England?\n“Jason and I not only have a true love for the game of football, as most of the world knows it but also a great appreciation for English culture,” says Hunt.\n\"When I was a kid I was into the Beatles, Shakespeare, Dr. Who, Monty Python. I didn’t know that Anglophile was a word then, but it’s what I was.”\nWhen told that “Fawlty Towers,” an iconic 12-episode series made in the late ’70s by Python veteran John Cleese, is reportedly being rebooted, Hunt genuinely recoils. “Come on Johnny, come on Johnny,” he says, shaking his head. “That show is cast in amber for all time. It does not need to be revisited.”\nMore TV news:\n- 'The Last of Us' season finale recap: Betrayal cuts deeper than zombies\n- Streep hits 'The Building': 'Only Murders in the Building' brings on Meryl Streep for Season 3 teaser trailer: Watch\n- What kind of animal is TV's Arthur?: An aardvark, though with some big differences\n- Natasha Lyonne on 'Poker Face' Season 1: Show's 'lazy' feel requires hard work",
