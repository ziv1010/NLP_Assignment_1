Russia was expelled from that year's World Cup in Qatar and was not part of qualifying for the 2026 edition to be held this summer in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\nInfantino said the ban has been fruitless in an interview with Sky Sports that took placed in London over the weekend during the FIFA Women's Champions Cup. His first desire is to have Russia's youth teams reinstated.\n'We have to (look at reinstating Russia), definitely, because this ban has not achieved anything. It has just created more frustration and hatred,' Infantino said. 'Having girls and boys from Russia being able to play football games in other parts of Europe would help.'\nUEFA's executive committee, whose next quarterly meeting takes place Feb. 11 in Brussels, Belgium, has the authority to reinstate Russia. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin has maintained the war in Ukraine needs to end for that to happen.\nThe European governing body in 2023 briefly planned to let Russia compete in Under-17 continental championship qualifying, citing a desire not to punish children for government actions. UEFA relented and upheld the ban after a dozen national federations threatened to boycott matches with Russia.\nAt the senior men's level, Russia has been limited to participating in friendlies, most recently against Chile and Peru in November.\nRussia hosted and reached the quarterfinals of the 2018 World Cup during Infantino's first term as FIFA president.\nInfantino told Sky Sports that his opposition to bans is unreserved and FIFA should 'enshrine in our statutes that we should actually never ban any country from playing football because of the acts of their political leaders.'\n--Field Level Media\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nFlip\nEmail\nGet a daily dose of Jamaican Times news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Jamaican Times.\nMore InformationROME, Italy: Record-high gold prices are reshaping how jewelry is made in Italy, pushing artisans and manufacturers to redesign everything...\nCUPERTINO, California: Apple is reshaping its iPhone launch strategy for 2026, planning to put its most advanced and expensive models...\nFRANKFURT, Germany: The eurozone closed out 2025 on firmer footing than expected, with domestic demand helping the bloc weather weak...\nNEW YORK CITY, New York: A steady drumbeat of layoffs across major U.S. employers is deepening anxiety for workers already navigating...\nHYDERABAD, India: India's rapid economic growth and swelling ranks of first-time flyers are set to fuel a dramatic expansion of the...\nESPOO, Finland: Global technology companies must operate across both sides of the Atlantic to compete effectively, Nokia's chief executive...\nBANGKOK, Thailand: Eleven people who killed 14 Chinese citizens, and ran a financial scam and gambling operations worth more than US$1...\nHYDERABAD, India: The World Health Organization (WHO) said on January 30 it sees a low risk of the Nipah virus spreading beyond India,...\nIn early January, several currency trackers briefly displayed the Iranian rial's value as $0.00, unable to process the speed and scale...\nMELBOURNE, Australia (Xinhua) -- Top seed Carlos Alcaraz won his first Australian Open title on Sunday to complete his set of major...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: The threat to impose a 50 percent tariff on any Canadian aircraft sold in the United States is the latest salvo in...\nBOSTON, Massachusetts - A New Zealand kid has shocked the athletics world with a stunning sub-4 minute mile run, and he says he has...",
