No matter your genre of choice, it turns out that zero can buy you quite a lot in the F2P game world, and even beloved classics are available at the steepest possible discount. We've collated the best free games on PC that are guaranteed to deliver a near-endless stream of complementary entertainment.\nAll you need to spend is your time. From cultural landmarks like League of Legends to all-time greats like Team Fortress 2, here are the best free games on PC.\nThe best free PC games in 2026 are:\n1. League of Legends\nInspired by the original Dota, League of Legends takes the same 5v5 base attack concept but introduces an entirely different roster of playable characters, constantly being expanded. Many players find League of Legends is easier and more accessible than Dota, but it is still incredibly nuanced; it has one of the highest skill ceilings in gaming, and the best players are considered tactical geniuses.\nMore than 100 million people play it every month, so you won't struggle to find a game, and you're guaranteed to find a few champions that you can't stop playing. They have a way of growing on you, which I guess is how it managed to grow into a popular Netflix series too. If you're already playing, then PCGamesN has you covered with the latest from the LoL Mythic Shop and a guide to which League of Legends skins are on sale.\n2. Enlisted\nThis Battlefield-esque tactical shooter prides itself on its historical accuracy, providing you with era-appropriate weapons and equipment as you lead your squad of AI soldiers through some of the most famous campaigns of WWII. As in War Thunder (developer Gaijin's F2P hit), you also have access to a range of aircraft, tanks, and vehicles to help you on your way to victory, which are unlocked through the distinct skill sets of each of your squad members.\nAs squad leader, it's up to you to command the actions of your troops throughout each battle, but should the worst happen and a stray bullet takes you out, you'll switch to the POV of a different member of your division. Surely, a welcome solution to those of us who've spent far too many hours face down in the mud, waiting to be revived by a teammate with different priorities.\n3. Delta Force\nWhile some may be wary of another free-to-play shooter when you've already got the likes of Call of Duty: Warzone and Enlisted to choose from, Delta Force still manages to carve out its own niche. It's like a free version of Battlefield, and one that looks like it has some staying power (unlike Battlefield Play4Free).\nWith a decent variety of maps (ranging from battlefields in the countryside to large industrial complexes), there's quite a lot to do here. With up to 63 other players, you'll be engaged in extraction missions and taking part in other operations with a more tactical angle (king of the hill type stuff). We're looking forward to seeing what else this game has to offer in the future as it continues to grow. Check out our guides to the best Delta Force weapons, loadouts, and operators To see if your PC can run it, check the Delta Force requirements for recommended and minimum system requirements.\n4. Wuthering Waves\nHoyoverse isn't the only weeby ARPG maker out there, and Kuro Games has made a play for the studio's crown. Though Wuthering Waves will feel very familiar to Genshin Impact fans, there are plenty of differences between the two that make WuWa a refreshing experience. While Genshin's story may be better established, we much prefer the sophistication of Wuthering Waves's parry and dodge-based combat, and you can even collect monsters called Echoes to use in battle.\nOf course, Genshin has other strengths Wuthering Waves doesn't, so you'll have to try both and figure out which you prefer. With these gacha-infused games, the quality of the characters has a big say in which ones stick around..\nPlay Wuthering Waves for free.\n5. World of Tanks\nOne of the mightiest tank games there has ever been, World of Tanks is an accessible and exciting tank simulator built on a foundation of complex game mechanics. It pits two teams of tankers against each other in a classic deathmatch scenario.\nThere are hundreds of vehicles to unlock across ten different tiers, from speedy scouts to hulking heavies. You will be surprised at how many tanks Wargaming has managed to cram in. There's even a mobile version of the game in World of Tanks: Blitz, which is a separate, but very faithful recreation of the experience.\n6. Fortnite\nEpic's battle royale needs no introduction: it's the most significant cultural shift in gaming since League of Legends. Aside from being free to play, there are several reasons why Fortnite has wiped the floor with the competition. Despite being thrown together in a couple of months and bolted onto the side of the original Fortnite: Save the World game, this cartoony last-man-standing is the ever-evolving foundation for weekly updates, seasonal changes, and genre-defining new ideas.\nHowever often you log in, there's always a new challenge to complete, and the Fortnite Battle Pass system rewards the most devout players with heaps of rewards. Casual players need not fear, though; simple shooting and rules keep it accessible, and the building mechanics offer depth to chase. We've got up-to-date guides with the latest Fortnite skins, new Fortnite weapons, and details on the next Fortnite map.\n7. War Thunder\nYou don't have to find a group of like-minded aviation enthusiasts on a message board and join their virtual squadron to enjoy War Thunder. You don't have to choose between realism or accessibility, either. You just download it, and then you're flying, driving, and shooting your way across the battlefields.\nThis massively multiplayer WW2 combat game effortlessly encompasses all of the explosions and excitement that planes and tanks are capable of. There's a growing selection of PvE options too, alongside the famous PvP mode, so however you like your war games, War Thunder will be able to cater to your tastes.\n8. Zenless Zone Zero\nZenless Zone Zero is the latest offering from gacha titan HoYoverse, and it's one for fighting game fans. This cyberpunk adventure follows hacker siblings Belle and Wise in the cyberpunk city of New Eridu. As alter ego Phaethon, they take on Inter-Knot commissions that send them into dangerous Hollows to fend off hostile Ethereals. This hazardous line of work puts them in the path of weird and wonderful characters from various city factions as they become embroiled in this cozy dystopia's political machinations.\nIn our Zenless Zone Zero review I praised it for its \"slick combat and tile exploration,\" but it is still subject to the gacha game grind. All the systems you'd expect from a HoYoverse experience are here. You can pull the best characters from ZZZ banners, which are all but required to build the best teams. However, there are also plenty of events to take part in for free characters, items, and Polychrome, so you don't have to rely entirely on luck to ace ZZZ's various combat challenges and alternate game modes. If you're ready to make New Eridu your home away from home, check out our Zenless Zone Zero tier list to discover which characters are worth your time and level-up materials, along with the current ZZZ codes for some easy freebies.\nPlay Zenless Zone Zero for free.\n9. World of Warships\nIf you like the idea of an ocean-based military simulation game, you need World of Warships. Introducing the navy to the concept of deathmatch, the controls are simple and welcoming, but have hidden depths (much like the oceans you're battling on). It's quite an addictive gameplay loop that cements itself as one of the best submarine games we've ever come across.\nWorld of Warships is more fun than Total War's pondering naval engagements, more approachable than Silent Hunter, and far more nuanced than you'd expect a free game to be. If you're fond of military history, you'll be pleased to see quite a vast selection of vessels drawn from a variety of nations at different points in history. With new content added all the time, there's plenty to keep you coming back.\nPlay World of Warships for free.\n10. Honkai Star Rail\nAll aboard! Honkai Star Rail is the latest installment of HoYoverse's interstellar sci-fi adventure series, and as our Honkai Star Rail review attests, it's a journey you won't want to miss. Like Genshin Impact, the turn-based RPG includes an ever-growing roster of eclectic and colorful characters to pull from Honkai Star Rail banners. Take your favorites into battle against the monstrous armies of the Antimatter Legion, confront the mysterious Stellaron Hunters, and interact with every trash can - we promise, it's worth it.\nThere are a lot of Hoyoverse games at this point, and if you've liked what came before, there's a good chance you'll like this one too. The RPG mechanics are well-polished, and it's got just the right balance of seriousness and wackiness to keep things fun and engaging as you progress through its continuously expanded storyline.\nPlay Honkai Star Rail for free.\n11. Crossout\nCrossout is a vehicular combat MMO where you craft outlandish cars and drive them into battle alongside other players. Set to a Mad Max-style backdrop of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, there's an emphasis on deep customization, skillful driving, and aiming.\nCrossout contains a variety of co-op and competitive game modes, as well as a marketplace full of tradable goods. The sheer number of Crossout factions, different body types, guns, cannons, and armor ensures that there are many ways to play… although they are all pretty deadly.\n12. Mech Arena\nMech Arena was brought into the world by Plarium, the developer behind Raid: Shadow Legends. However, there's very little that these two games have in common. Mech Arena is all about hopping into a mech suit and then doing battle against other players in their own mech suits. It's a simple premise, but one that can be an awful lot of fun.\nThere are several arenas to battle in, which keeps things feeling fresh, but most interestingly, there are countless options available for customization. Eventually, you'll be able to customize your mech to the extent that it perfectly complements your preferred playstyle, giving you a chance to cultivate and develop your battle tactics.\n13. Naraka Bladepoint\nAs battle royale games go, there are many free options out there. However, Naraka Bladepoint is more focused on melee combat and spectacular movement than the vast majority of its competitors, giving it more of a unique edge.\nSince going free-to-play, the game has exploded in popularity and is constantly one of the most-played games on Steam, so you'll rarely have issues getting into a competitive match. It's a refreshing change from a lot of the other free battle royale games, which often tend towards gun-based combat.\nPlay Naraka Bladepoint for free.\n14. Star Conflict\nA shiny, colorful space sim that places you in a massively multiplayer universe, Star Conflict drops you right in the middle of an interplanetary skirmish that encompasses both PvE and PvP. Its void is as roomy as any other sector of space you might name, while its busy, man-made surface environments recall the twisty tunnels of the Descent series.\n15. CRSED: F.O.A.D.\nSo many great things have started out as jokes: bacon-flavored cola, sincere Spinal Tap fans, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and now CRSED. Formally known as Cuisine Royale, this free-to-play battle royale game where you strap pots and pans to yourself in place of plate armor started as a spinoff for squad-based MMO shooter Enlisted but quickly garnered its player base. And it's easy to see why, as the freedom of being a 'joke' game has allowed developer Darkflow Software to experiment with mechanics PUBG wouldn't dare consider, like demonic powers, Champions, and even jetpacks.\n16. Wizard101\nLaunched in 2008, Wizard101 is a fantasy MMORPG that has been able to remain popular among gamers ever since. In it, you step into the shoes of a student at the Ravenwood School for Magical Arts. You choose whether you want to enroll in the school of Fire, Ice, Storm, Myth, Life, Death, or Balance, with each of these fields giving you access to a unique selection of magical abilities that will significantly affect the way that you approach enemies in battle. Teaming up with other players in battle will allow you to experiment with different strategies as you consider how different types of magic pair together.\nMeanwhile, the game has a fantastic story that initially sees you coming up against Ravenwood's former necromancy teacher, Malistaire. What at first appears to be a typical story about an evil wizard, soon turns out to be something much more nuanced. During your adventure, you'll have the opportunity to visit a range of exciting, fantastical locations, from enchanted forests to ancient desert communities and even a city under the sea. It's a charming experience.\n17. Friday Night Funkin'\nSince its release in 2020, Friday Night Funkin' is a game that has won a place in the hearts of gamers everywhere. For those who haven't encountered it before, this simple rhythm game is enormously addictive and packed with endless charm. You play as an innocuous backwards cap-wearing kid named Boyfriend who engages in sing-offs and rap battles against several opponents to impress your girlfriend.\nThe gameplay is quite similar to Dance Dance Revolution, but you use your arrow keys instead of a dance mat. Meanwhile, the songs are slapping, and the characters' electronic voices are pretty cute. It's really easy to get into it, and it's one of those games where you want to play for a minute but end up spending hours with it.\nPlay Friday Night Funkin' for free in Opera GX.\n18. Fragpunk\nThere's nothing like a bombastic shooter to get your PC working, and Fragpunk is a brilliant choice. At first glance, it may seem similar to other hero shooters like Valorant or Overwatch, but Fragpunk's 5v5 action offers a distinctive mechanic in the form of Shard Cards - unique abilities like giving you life-sapping bullets or making your allies' limbs bulletproof, that can change how you play the game.\nA gimmick isn't the only thing Fragpunk players can expect to enjoy. Solid gunplay rivals that of games like Apex Legends, while the various modes give you plenty of different ways to play. Want a competitive Valorant-style game mode? Go right ahead. How about a casual Team Deathmatch option? Be my guest. Don't forget to add free in-game rewards to your inventory by using our Fragpunk codes guide.\nThe environments are just as impressive, with Fragpunk's arenas offering plenty of verticality and ways to surprise your enemies. A temple-style map will give you Indiana Jones vibes, while an underground cavern offers debris as cover and a central point that will see you pop up to the top and shoot at your enemies from above. Gain an advantage over the competition using our comprehensive Fragpunk tier list.\n19. Where Winds Meet\nGet lost in an open-world RPG set in ancient China during the 10th century, Where Winds Meet from Everstone Studio sets you on a journey across a colorful world filled with mysteries to uncover as you tick off everything on the dense quest list. What's more, you can join up with your friends and go on co-op adventures, though you will have to unlock the multiplayer functionality first.\nIt's rare to see a free-to-play game that is as ambitious as this, and you can see the influence games like Ghost of Tsushima and Genshin Impact have had on it, mixing soulslike combat with gacha elements to create an entirely free 100+ hour-long epic.\n20. Skate\nAfter many years of watching console players enjoy the Skate series, we're so pleased to see that it's finally back and now available on PC. Skate is known for its Flick-It controls, an intuitive system with a high skill ceiling, rewarding you for spending the time mastering the controls to perform the game's most difficult tricks.\nSkate embraces the social element of the sport, allowing you to share the joy of landing a great line with your fellow skaters. San Vansterdam, the home of the Skate map, is open to everyone, featuring 150 skaters all on the same server. Every challenge in the game's campaign can be completed in co-op with random players, and you don't have to worry about any pay-to-win elements as the only purchasable items are cosmetics.\n21. 20 Small Mazes\n20 Small Mazes is a wonderful little puzzle game that is filled to the brim with creativity, ingenuity, and those types of puzzles where, when you solve them, you say something out loud. Could be an exclamation of joy, could be your preferred swear word, who knows. All we know is this is a fantastic game, it's free, and you should go pick it up on Steam right now.\n22. Warframe\nEverything's better in space, and Warframe proves precisely that by taking ninjas and putting them in space. It is a co-op third-person game where teams of ninjas suit up in powerful 'Warframe' armor and head out to slice up bad guys - or hang out at the dojo. It blends some MMO elements with the sensibilities of a more straightforward action game, creating something slick, exciting, and very sociable.\nIt's also not without depth; you can easily pour hundreds of hours into perfecting Warframe builds. The game is often compared to Destiny, and Warframe players will even tell you it's far better than Bungie's triple-A shooter. Though Tencent bought out the original developers, Warframe remains \"creatively independent.\" Check out our guide to the latest Warframe codes if you want to get a solid start in the game.\n23. Guild Wars 2\nGuild Wars 2 is one of the best MMOs available. Even better, you can play a huge chunk of it for free. There's a lot to do, from traditional questing for NPCs to zone events where everyone can suddenly get involved and work as a massive team to bring down a boss or help a burning village. The free-to-play base game is huge, and the devs continue to produce huge expansions, with the most recent being Janthir Wilds, and another due later this year.\n24. Albion Online\nAlbion Online's classless sandbox MMO is a refreshing journey into a medieval world where you're not bound to a certain playstyle. Albion is less about character builds and more about strategy and tactics in a PvP-driven environment that focuses on building a guild with fellow players. Although Albion Online's environment leaves much to be imagined, the player-controlled economy and unforgiving loot system make for hours lost battling foes, delving into dungeons, and riding through lush green fields on your loyal steed.\n25. Apex Legends\nSwooshing onto the scene from a well-placed zipline, Apex Legends has more than earned its place among the best battle royale games. From the developers behind Titanfall, Apex Legends takes the BR formula and adds a roster of intriguing characters that infuse each round with new tactical possibilities depending on your team composition. They've also stirred up the genre by adding intuitive contextual pings and introducing the ability to respawn your downed teammates, ensuring you can blame your squad for your demise at least twice a game.\nAs we discuss in our Apex Legends review, the game has particularly satisfying movement - you'll be skidding down slopes, clambering through buildings, and launching yourself into the sky to reposition - and character abilities that make you feel like you've got the chance to steal the edge in combat, even against the champion squad. If you're ready to get started, be sure to check out our Apex Legends tier list to help give you an idea of which characters to use.\n26. Destiny 2\nDestiny 2 arrived on Steam with the Shadowkeep expansion in October 2019 and simultaneously opened up the base game, the Leviathan raid, and several PvP modes to everyone for free. Team up with your friends and go on adventures searching for shiny loot like Exotic weapons, or duke it out against other players in The Crucible.\nDestiny 2 has something to offer everyone, from casual players looking for somewhere to hang out to hardcore raid fans and collectors. The Destiny 2 classes boast a surprising degree of nuance, though it'll take some dedication to craft the best builds of the bunch.\n27. Teamfight Tactics\nTeamfight Tactics is a free Autobattler game by Riot that takes the most beloved characters from League of Legends and places them on a chess-like board to duke it out until only one player's team is left standing. Playing against several opponents, you can pick a hero from a shared pool and slowly build a team by earning coins and trading heroes.\nThere's plenty of strategy in this fast-paced Autobattler, whether that's ensuring your heroes complement each other, factoring in a counter for every enemy type, or combining items to buff character stats. You'll grow a strong team by aligning attributes and earning perks from synergies and class bonuses. Like League of Legends, TFT undergoes regular updates and balance changes, such as rotating the hero pool or adding new items. Whether you want to jump into a casual game or take on ranked mode, it's always kept fresh.\n28. Rocket League\nMany games on this list exploded in popularity, but Rocket League may be the most surprising of them all. What is essentially soccer with rocket-powered cars, Rocket League had several factors going for it that made it a smash hit: it launched at a quiet time in terms of game releases, Psyonix partnered up with Sony to release the game on PS Plus to give it an instant audience, and the game itself was excellent.\nAs a free-to-play game with full crossplay compatibility across every game platform out there, the Rocket League audience continues to grow as more people learn about the game's spectacular esports scene. Of course, there's also a big casual scene too, and it's a lot of fun to play with friends, or just to unwind with when playing against strangers online.\n29. Brawlhalla\nBrawlhalla is a platform fighter that takes its inspiration from Super Smash Bros. While Brawlhalla's core roster consists of a selection of original characters, otherwise known as legends, that wield a variety of weapons, from pistols to rocket lances, the main draw is the selection of crossover characters available from various established IPs.\nDepending on the weekly rotation schedule, you can play as Street Fighter's Chun Li, Assassin's Creed's Ezio, Rayman, or even Shovel Knight. This eclectic mix of fighters is compelling in its own right, but Brawlhalla uses a range of arcade modes, online competitive ranked, and casual free-for-all formats.\n30. Magic: The Gathering Arena\nThanks to CCG titan Hearthstone, there are many more card gaming experts around than there used to be. Recent card-gaming converts can move onto games like Gwent or The Elder Scrolls: Legends for themed twists that boast a few new mechanics, but if you want a real challenge, you can't beat Magic: The Gathering Arena.\nWizards of the Coast's latest digital port of the revered paper card game is certainly not for the faint-hearted - it's based on the trading card game that's been going since 1993, so you can only imagine how many cards and keywords are at play. Magic: The Gathering Arena does an excellent job of shedding some of that historic baggage while retaining most of the complexity that makes Magic so unique, and it comes complete with all of the board animations and sensory delights that we've come to expect of modern CCGs. Read our full Magic: The Gathering Arena review for our full thoughts on this game.\n31. Valorant\nValorant is a 5v5 hero shooter that's a little more tactical than the likes of Overwatch or Apex Legends. Like in CS:GO, all Valorant characters begin a match with a baseline weapon, with the opportunity to purchase heavier firepower using the points you've accrued from completing objectives and defeating opposing players. However, Valorant agents also have signature powers that reinforce their designated role in their team and provide a bit of added flavor that you expect from a more traditional hero shooter.\nWhile only five agents are available to play at the game's outset, Valorant allows you to expand your roster by completing individual agent contracts without opening your wallet. There are also plenty of game modes, from the standard unranked and competitive matches to non-standard formats such as Deathmatch, Escalation, and Replication. Whether you're dead-set on climbing through the Valorant ranks or just playing casually, it's a game that caters to all tastes. To see if your PC can run it, check the Valorant requirements for recommended and minimum system requirements.\n32. PUBG: Battlegrounds\nOne hundred players drop onto the battlefield, but there can be only one winner. PUBG: Battlegrounds, formerly known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, is arguably the first battle royale game to kickstart the entire genre truly. At its peak as a premium title, PUBG had over three million concurrent players in 2017, obliterating the previous record set by DOTA 2. PUBG isn't as popular as it used to be these days, but it has since moved to the free-to-play model and still maintains a healthy player base on Steam.\nPUBG has a strong audience of new and returning players, making it easy to get into for the first time. It's not one of those games with a wholly competitive community, and if you want something a little bit like Fortnite, but which doesn't feel like a massive corporate smorgasbord of crossovers, this is well worth a try. Read our PUBG review for more insights.\n33. Once Human\nSurvival horror heads, don't think we haven't forgotten about you. The best survival games need robust base-building mechanics, plenty of cool beasties to avoid, and, above all, they need to respect our time. Though it's not a perfect experience by any means, Starry Studio's recent addition to the genre has plenty going for it.\nA malicious alien entity called Stardust has infected Earth's inhabitants, rendering them murderous, monstrous creatures. Fortunately, some humans have been able to resist and even harness Stardust, using it to their advantage. So, make sure you leverage our Once Human codes to claim helpful in-game rewards to power up your character.\n34. Marvel Rivals\nHero shooters have been in a weird spot. Overwatch 2 seemingly locked the subgenre down, while the huge disappointment that was Concorde seemingly reaffirmed that there really was one to rule them all. That is until NetEase's Marvel Rivals came along at the back end of the year.\nTaking everything good and joyous about hero shooters and splicing it with the strongest fighters in the Marvel multiverse, Marvel Rivals has already established itself as a major live service player. Whether you're locking down multiple players as Venom, or beating the snot out of hostiles as Iron Fist, Rivals is incredibly fun.\nIf you do jump in, make sure you get acquainted with the Marvel Rivals characters first. Once you've found your favorite, check out how they're performing in our Marvel Rivals tier list, the game's balance isn't bad, but there are notable outliers.\n35. Monopoly Go\nWhile not many people have time to spend six hours sitting around a Monopoly board, Monopoly Go gives players the chance to enjoy the experience of this capitalism simulator in bite-sized chunks on your PC and mobile alike. You play with friends and strangers across the internet, and your goal is to work through various maps to unendingly increase your property empire.\nWhile this version may be more accessible in the sense of not needing you to dedicate a huge amount of time to it in one go, it is not any less ruthless than its board game counterpart. Indeed, the extent to which players are pitted against each other and can drive each other into the ground (with things like limited time bonuses and so forth) is much greater than in the original version. Luckily, if you're planning on getting started, we've got a guide filled with free Monopoly Go dice links to give you a leg up.\n36. Umamusume Pretty Derby\nWe've seen some 'strange' games go viral in recent years, but Umamusume: Pretty Derby might just take the cake as the most surprising. The horse girl racing gacha game puts you in the shoes of a trainer who wants their racers to win every competition imaginable. So, instead of horses, Umamusume: Pretty Derby uses anime girls to represent the majestic creatures.\nYou don't actually participate in the races; after all, you're just the trainer of these hors… anime girls. Your job is to pick out the talent and train them to win races by creating practice routines and working on the strategy side of the competitions. Some of the girls are even based on legendary horses, featuring designs that mirror their horse counterparts. Despite the odd concept, this game has been a smash hit since it launched on Steam, and if you want to train up an army of horse girls, be sure to check out our Umamusume Pretty Derby codes guide to upgrade your riders.\n37. Infinity Nikki\nInfinity Nikki is an open-world gacha game that focuses on the beauty of life rather than slaying monsters and evildoers. Across the variety of luscious environments, you'll discover whimsical creatures that you can groom, partake in fishing at nearby ravines, and catch some bugs to learn more about the local wildlife.\nInfinity Nikki outfits are a big part of the game, giving you the chance to mix and match different fashion accessories to look your absolute best. Landing some of the rarer bits of clothing will require you to earn the in-game currency, and luckily for you, we have an Infinity Nikki codes guide to help you earn free in-game rewards. Give our Infinity Nikki review a read to learn more about this refreshing take on gacha games.\n38. The Sims 4\nThe Sims series has been the quintessential life game ever since the turn of the millennium. After the Sims 5 release date, EA has opted to make The Sims 4 free-to-play, lighting a fire under its thriving community. Using the extensive Sims 4 custom content tools and mods, you're granted the freedom to design your Sims however you like, from their looks to their sparkling personalities.\nIf you're partial to construction, you can also build their house from the ground up and fill it with as much kitsch as their budgets will allow - or you can use the extensive selection of chats to build to your heart's content. From there, it's getting to know the neighborhood, establishing your Sim's career, and eventually starting a family. Life, death, and all the messy bits in between serve as The Sims 4's playground.\nThe free-to-play version of The Sims 4 provides a solid foundation to experience the game without spending a single penny. Still, we'd be remiss if we didn't mention the enormous variety of Sims 4 expansion packs available to expand your horizons. If you'd like to keep it free, there's also an avalanche of Sims 4 CC creators and packs available to install. Read our full The Sims 4 review for more of our insights.\n39. Deadlock\nValve's not-so-secret project was unceremoniously dropped onto Steam, giving players a chance to try out the MOBA shooter hybrid. The MOBA genre has its favorite games locked in at this point, and we've seen developers attempt to create hybrids in the past, but it looks like Valve may have cracked the code with Deadlock.\nFeaturing a roster of over 20 Deadlock characters, each fighter comes equipped with various abilities and powers not too dissimilar from what DOTA and League players are used to seeing. Like in most MOBAs, there are cooldowns to think about, level-ups that allow you to upgrade your character, and an in-game store to spend your hard-earned gold. There's also a zip line mechanic to help get around the arena faster, saving you lots of time having to run around the map with nothing to do. Valve has nailed the third-person shooter mechanics, and with so many variables that lead to incredible team synergies, there's a lot of room to experiment with builds and item purchases.\nAt this time, you need to receive an invitation from someone who already has the game to gain access to the playtest. Fortunately, the game has been played by hundreds of thousands of people, so you're bound to know someone who has access.\n40. Dark and Darker\nDark and Darker had an equally incredible and rocky beginning, going from being a surprise hit during an open Steam beta, to be taken off the platform, and others, thanks to dramatic legal problems. With all of that resolved, though, the dungeon crawler has returned to Steam with a full free-to-play version.\nA PvPvE game, Dark and Darker pits you against both deadly foes and real-life players in a bid to loot as much as you can and extract, as you explore classically fantasy dungeons: gloomy caverns lined with torches and filled with skeletons and goblins. There are a range of classes to choose from, each with their own weapon proficiencies, and a well-rounded team can do some serious damage.\nThe free version of the multiplayer game gives you free rein of the 'standard' mode, but the High-Roller mode, harder dungeons, and better loot are reserved for those who pay for it. That said, there is plenty to get to grips with here if you just want to play for free.\n41. Fallout Shelter\nFollowing the Fallout resurgence that occurred with the release of the TV adaptation of the apocalyptic game series, there's no better time to try a Fallout game or two. While it might not have quite the same reputation as its action RPG siblings, there's only one Fallout game to try if 'free-to-play' is one of your requirements, and that's Fallout Shelter.\nJust because Fallout Shelter is free, though, doesn't mean it's not a great little time sink and a lot of fun. Again, sure, it's not the best of the Fallout games, but that's just because it's so different from the gorgeous, vast, single-player adventures of Fallout 4 and New Vegas, but it's still a great way to get a glimpse of the franchise in an entirely different genre.\nFallout Shelter is, instead, a cute, 2D base-building game, in which you oversee the day-to-day running of your vault. Start with a few new vault-dwellers, and expand as you get them to craft, build, and reproduce. Keep your Dwellers happy by ensuring they have enough food, water, and rest time, and encourage them to build romantic relationships, all while occasionally fending off various enemies. Eventually, you can send residents out into the post-apocalyptic hellscape to retrieve more materials and even new Dwellers to move in-if they make it back alive.\n42. Lost Ark\nOne of our favorite new MMOs, this game was out in South Korea for a while but finally reached Western shores a couple of years back. It's a curious mixture of Final Fantasy XIV and Diablo. Once you've chosen your preferred server, you can choose from various classes and refine their build while leveling up. Complete epic quests to unlock Awakening skills and jump into PvP for exclusive rewards.\nLost Ark is free-to-play but comes bundled with a seasonal battle pass that includes free and premium rewards. If you do fancy spending some money, there are some starter packs you may want to look at: Lost Ark Apprentice pack, Lost Ark Explorer pack, Lost Ark Vanquisher pack.\n43. Final Fantasy 14\nFinal Fantasy 14 has earned its spot among the best free PC games the hard way. After a disastrous launch and many months spent in recovery mode, developer Square Enix has managed to right the course of its ambitious Final Fantasy MMO and build one of the best gaming communities along the way. And yes, while the entire game isn't free, you can invest a solid chunk of time into the free trial version, which caps your progress at level 70.\nA Realm Reborn isn't just a great PC game; it really draws on everything that makes the Final Fantasy series so popular: beautiful worlds, eccentric characters, stylish cutscenes, and adorable critters. It's an adventure that feels like it never ends, with new expansions added on a regular basis.\n44. Conqueror's Blade\nEmbrace your inner knight as you engage in epic siege warfare in Conqueror's Blade. Pick a hero from a selection of medieval classes and lead them into battle, commanding a small battalion of troops into seemingly insurmountable sieges.\nThe medieval game switches between third-person combat and top-down views of the 30-player battles, so it's important to make the best use of your siege equipment and give astute tactical orders so that your troops emerge victorious - and alive.\n45. Trove\nTrove may look a lot like Minecraft, but in reality, it's a thoroughbred MMO replete with classes inspired by sword and sorcery classics. Just like those MMO greats, Trove is also all about grinding for more and more gear, making it a great hobby game, especially as it regularly receives hefty updates that add everything from new dungeons to PvP game modes for you to try out.\n46. Eve Online\nNo MMO can claim to be as player-driven as Eve Online, with the space game boasting mega-corporations run by legions of players and, very occasionally, gigantic space battles with upwards of 5,000 participating pilots.\nEve Online's free-to-play model lets players experience all that space madness (bar access to some end-game ships and skills) without paying a subscription fee. Its steep learning curve can be pretty daunting, so we highly recommend sticking to it, because once you're fully immersed in its world, it's one you won't want to leave.\n47. Call of Duty: Warzone\nUndergoing various interactions over the past few years, Call of Duty: Warzone has helped put COD back on the online gaming map in a way that it hadn't really been since the early 2010s. This battle royale captures the FPS essence of the series and wraps it in a package that is accessible to anyone with the hardware to run it.\nWith new Warzone guns and other goodies added at regular intervals, it's a game that is continuously growing and which manages to keep a large player base coming back for more. Read our guide on the best Warzone loadouts if you want to ensure you're starting out strong in the game.\n48. Overwatch 2\nBlizzard's hero shooter returns in a free-to-play format, and while it's received some welcome quality-of-life adjustments and a brand-new battle pass, it remains, at its core, the same game that captivated its player base back in 2016. The maps take players to various locales to engage in standard match formats, such as escorting a payload or capturing a point. It's also expanded to include an arcade suite for non-standard game modes like capture the flag and team deathmatch - all staples of the best FPS games.\nHowever, the biggest draw for Overwatch 2 is its ever-growing roster of heroes. With over 30 Overwatch 2 characters available, there's sure to be a hero whose aesthetic and playstyle appeal to you. The 5v5 combat encourages you to switch up your hero to counter your opposing team, and a carefully timed ult can turn the tide of a match. Be sure to look at our Overwatch 2 tier list for the best heroes and their roles so that you can rise through the ranks faster than ever.\n49. Counter-Strike 2\nCSGO was going strong for over a decade, and while many new free-to-play FPS titles have risen to prominence during that time, Valve decided to release the sequel in the form of Counter-Strike 2. Part of its appeal is its dedication to realism; CS2's gameplay is grounded in a way that sets it apart from more modern military shooters, which tend to include power-ups and perks that can drastically upset the emerging outcome of a match. The result is an exceptionally balanced FPS game that relies on player skill and strategy over luck, with a deceptively high skill ceiling that keeps its audience locked in for the long haul.\nGive our Counter-Strike 2 review a read to see what we thought about the game. If you're looking to take your first steps into the world of Counter-Strike, check out our best CS2 crosshairs guide to set yourself up with the perfect aiming reticle. We also have a CS2 ranks and ratings guide to help new players understand the competitive modes on offer.\n50. Hearthstone\nBlizzard's world-dominating card game is about as moreish as chips. Who's ever had enough chips? You've always got room for more chips, and you've always got time for another game of Hearthstone. With a gargantuan selection of cards, the game now supports hundreds of different play styles, which you can easily tailor by building your perfect Hearthstone decks. The heart of Blizzard's CCG is in its competitive multiplayer matches, but Dungeon Run provides an excellent and moreish solo card experience few other games can match.\nIf you're a fan of autobattler games, Hearthstone has its own tavern-tinged take in Hearthstone Battlegrounds, which pits you against seven other players and offers you a random selection of Hearthstone Battlegrounds cards to build your hand with each round.\n51. Dota 2\nTwo teams of five choose their Dota 2 heroes from a selection of hundreds before taking to the battlefield to destroy their opponent's base. It is no mean feat, as both teams' bases spawn waves of creatures and are protected by powerful towers. Each player will need to make the best of their hero's abilities in what is not only a game but a sport.\nIt is tough, complex and inspires fanaticism in its fans. It is one of the most played games on Steam and draws in hundreds of thousands of players every day. If you're feeling a bit daunted, our Dota 2 beginner's guide goes into the building blocks of how to play and hopefully win your first match.\n52. Team Fortress 2\nValve's class-based shooter, Team Fortress 2, has achieved legendary status thanks to its varied game modes, impeccable sense of fun, and being home to more hats than the world's millinery stores combined. The whole game is free-to-play these days, from the standard shoot-everything-that-moves deathmatches to the fantastic Mann vs. Machine co-op mode where teams fend off waves of robots. Not to mention it's constantly being cared for with regular seasonal updates.\n53. Path of Exile\nAn action RPG in the mold of Diablo, Path of Exile is one of the most polished, well-executed games on this list. Adventure with a friend or two through hundreds of areas in a dark fantasy world that provides a dizzying collection of monsters to click on until they squish repeatedly. Path of Exile does feature a microtransaction system, but it's admirably unobtrusive.\nIf you're partial to hack-and-slash looters, we have a list of the best games like Diablo for you. Its sequel, Path of Exile 2, is fantastic as well, but it won't be available as a free-to-play game until it leaves early access.\n54. Star Wars: The Old Republic\nAfter a long, slow start, Star Wars: The Old Republic is now a stellar MMO, particularly thanks to the Knights of the Fallen Empire expansion, which is basically 'BioWare does a proper KOTOR sequel'. It is a fast-paced action RPG with lightsabers, space combat, Jedi houses, and bounty hunters, and if you go full dark side, you can fire lightning from your fingertips. It really is one of the best Star Wars games around.\n55. D&D Online\nDo you want a chance to adventure in some of the most famous fantasy worlds there ever were? With D&D Online, you can set foot in the Forgotten Realms and the land of Eberron, stepping into the well-worn boots of a thief or a spellcaster as you fight dragons and demons. It's not often you get high fantasy for free.\n56. Runescape\nThis golden oldie continues to be one of the largest MMORPGs ever made and holds the record for being the most updated game in history. Runescape has an enormous player base and a massive, ever-evolving world to explore, full of challenges you can choose according to your interests. Want to fight, complete quests, or play minigames? In Runescape, it is entirely up to you.\n57. Spelunky Classic\nIt says something about how special PC gaming is that one of the best platformers we've ever seen is still free. Spelunky is inspired by the best old games from the 8-bit era, but it procedurally generates its levels, so you've always got somewhere new to explore every time you play. It also has snakes, ice caves, and more bats than you can shake your shotgun at - if you can find one in the dark.\n58. Super Crate Box\nSuper Crate Box is a superfast, super-dangerous platformer where enemies constantly drop from the top of the screen. Score points not by killing them but by collecting crates, each of which has a new weapon for you, though some are much better than others.\nLet any of the monsters past you and into the fire below, and they respawn more potent than before. Repeat this formula and enjoy ad infinitum. It's a shame that Vlambeer is no more, but at least this game is still here for us to play.\n59. Fall Guys\nIf you've ever wanted to play a version of Takeshi's Castle as a cute little bean, Fall Guys lets you live the dream as 60 players fight across a range of minigames. From platforming challenges to memorization puzzles, Fall Guys features a range of unique hurdles to test each player's skills in short bursts. Once the initial group of players gets whittled down to the final ten, things start to heat up as every challenger vies for the crown.\nA lot has changed for Mediatonic, the indie developers behind Fall Guys. Shortly after the game's launch, Mediatonic Games was acquired by Epic Games. This brought about some huge changes to Fall Guys, including cross-platform play, the switch to the free-to-play model, and plenty of crossover events with other video game IPs. Read our Fall Guys review to see what we thought about the game when it launched.\n60. Marvel Snap\nIf card games and comic books are your twin passions, then you can't go wrong with Marvel Snap. This fast-paced CCG allows you to construct a deck of twelve heroes and villains, and then send them into battle across notable locations in the Marvel Universe. A match only lasts around three minutes, but don't mistake its fast pace for simplicity.\nMarvel Snap also boasts regular updates introducing new missions, events, and challenges, so there's plenty to tide you over between matches with friends and rivals alike. It's ideal for Steam Deck users who like to game on the go, as well as anyone who prefers their deck builders on the short and snappy side (pun intended). Just check out some of the best Marvel Snap decks to get started.\n61. The Finals\nDo you like environmental destruction, team-based gameplay, and lots of money? The Finals welcomes teams of three to battle against each other in a fight for cold, hard cash. Using the best The Finals loadouts, your group can easily dominate the battlefield as you take everyone down with the best The Finals weapons at hand.\nThere are three The Finals classes to pick from, each with its own set of abilities and gadgets for you to experiment with. Destruction is a key element of The Finals, giving you the freedom to bamboozle your opponents by blowing open any building your enemies are holed up inside. If you have two friends to try it with, you're almost guaranteed to have a good time.\n62. Rocket Racing\nIf you've ever wanted to play Rocket League as a racing game, your dreams have finally come true. Built directly into Fortnite is Rocket Racing, a new game from the developers of Rocket League that lets you drive, boost, and even fly across a growing number of racetracks. Playable with up to 12 people, you can race against random people in casual play or go the competitive route and take on the game's best drivers.\nIt's fair to say Rocket Racing was released in a bare-bones state back at launch, but things are improving as the months go by. The latest update added two new advanced tracks to the game, as well as new quests and drift smoke colors to make other racers eat your dust. Considering its attractive price (free) and that the racer is built into one of the most popular games on the planet, there's no reason not to give Rocket Racing a shot.\n63. Aimlabs\nThe most difficult part of any FPS game is the aiming aspect, even if you're exceptional in one game, that doesn't necessarily mean your skills will translate to other titles. A shooter like Counter-Strike 2 that requires pinpoint precision may help in Valorant, but you're going to need to brush up on your tracking shots in games like Apex Legends. This is where Aimlabs comes in, a program designed to help you understand what areas you struggle with when it comes to aiming.\nAimlabs takes into consideration your favorite games, as well as the types of weapons you like to use to recreate the aiming experience. From there, you're given a series of exercises to test your skills on. Once the program analyzes your results, you can work out what side of your game you need to brush up on. Your results are so accurately broken down that you can verify which side you're dominant on, providing you with the data to fix any of your aiming deficiencies.\n64. Trackmania\nIf you want to prove who the best racer is, Trackmania is the perfect arena to show who is the master of the wheel. Pitting 60 players together on the same server, players continuously run through the same track to improve their lap times. Each millisecond added to the timer can be the difference between first place and last, depending on how good your competition is. The best part is that the core game is completely free, so you never have to invest any money unless you desperately want access to multiple campaigns and customization options.\n65. Throne and Liberty\nTake a trip to the vast open world of Solisium, filled with dangerous monsters and, arguably even scarier, threatening human players. That's right, this MMORPG pits player versus player, but if you work together, you can group up to take down some of the biggest monsters in Solisium. If you're thinking about jumping into the fight, don't forget to read our best Throne and Liberty build guide to help get you started.\n66. Crab Game\nRemember Squid Game? Of course you do! The Netflix series takes hundreds of contestants and puts them through a series of childhood games like Red Light, Green Light, and that dangerous one with the breakable glass panels. Crab Game condenses that experience down to 35 players, pitting you against every player on the server in a silly assortment of mini-games heavily inspired by Squid Game. It's a noisy, messy experience, but when played with a group of friends, it's surprisingly fun.\n67. Roblox\nForget one free PC game; try a limitless quantity of them, all in one place.
