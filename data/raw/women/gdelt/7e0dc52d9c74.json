  "body_text": "As he gets back into the groove following a Caribbean getaway with his family, Prince William was forced to delete a social media post because of a goof, Hello! reported.\nIn his first update post-Mustique trip alongside wife Kate Middleton and their three kids Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, William shared a photo of himself and the new men’s manager for England’s national football team, Thomas Tuchel, on X. The two men are pictured shaking hands at Windsor Castle, nearby the Wales family home of Adelaide Cottage on the grounds of the Windsor estate.\nThe first post on X read, “Great to meet new @england manager Thomas Tuchel for the first time today, and hear about plans for the team.”\nHello! reported that “minutes later, it was deleted and reposted,” with the new language reading: “Great to meet new @england men’s manager Thomas Tuchel for the first time today, and hear about plans for the team.”\nIn all likelihood, this was probably a member of William and Kate’s staff making the post, especially since it wasn’t signed with a “W,” which indicates that the message is from William himself. Similarly, if a message is personally from Kate, she’ll sign it “C,” shorthand for Catherine.\nThe edit to the post was reflective of the fact that England also has a women’s team, coached by Sarina Wiegman.\nAccording to Hello!, the February 25 meeting between the Prince of Wales and Tuchel lasted for over an hour, “and was an opportunity for the new coach to share his views on the team since taking on the role and his hopes for the future,” the outlet reported. Tuchel took over for former men’s manager Gareth Southgate, who left the role in January.\nWilliam has been a longtime football fan—the sport known as soccer in the U.S. He has been president of the Football Association since 2006, early in his working royal life, and in recent years has brought eldest son George along with him to watch England’s men's team play at both the Euro 2020 and 2024 tournaments.\nMore specifically, William is a passionate fan of Aston Villa, saying in 2015, “I wanted to have a team that was more mid-table that could give me more emotional rollercoaster moments. Aston Villa’s always had a great history.”\nHe’s also supported the women’s football team, called the Lionesses, including recording a good luck message for the squad in 2023 alongside daughter Charlotte as the team prepared to play in the FIFA Women’s World Cup that year.\nGeorge, Charlotte, and Louis returned to school from half-term break on Monday, and William and Kate are expected to undertake a joint engagement on February 26 in South Wales.",
