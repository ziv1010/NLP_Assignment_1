Yet another example was uncovered recently. As Fox News reports, sonny boy told his business associates back in 2013, while the Big Guy was serving his second term as Barack Obama’s veep, “that a top Chinese Communist Party leader allegedly asked him to travel to China to talk about future ‘business opportunities.’” Hunter accompanied his dad on a six-day Asia trip that included China, South Korea, and Japan, during which the junior Biden introduced his dad to a couple of those business associates in a hotel lobby. The unelected and unappointed son of the sitting vice president “attended multiple events with his dad, including a lunch that featured some of the most powerful CCP leaders in China.” Later, according to an email exchange with Hunter, one of his business associates offered to accompany him on a trip to Hong Kong “to discuss business opportunities” with “C.H. Tung, a former governor of Hong Kong and billionaire who served as the vice chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference between 2005 and 2023.” No influence-peddling to see here, though.

Outside the venue that evening, a Secret Service agent was robbed at gunpoint, with the suspect making off with a handbag. The agent reportedly fired a firearm during the incident, but the perpetrator got away. Police have been unable to locate the suspect. The incident demonstrates the problem of growing crime in many Democrat-run states and cities. For Los Angeles in particular, the homicide rate rose 30% between 2023 and 2024, with the overall violent crime rate rising by 3% and robberies up 10%. Much of the crime rate increases can be blamed on the city’s Democrat leaders’ soft-on-crime policies. Prosecutions of criminals have decreased thanks to political leaders committed to promoting woke ideology as opposed to blindly upholding the law.\nMigrant crime: While not all illegal migrants are violent criminals, by definition, all illegal migrants are lawbreakers because they have unlawfully entered the country. The distinction between “legal” and “illegal” matters, but Democrats and the Leftmedia intentionally ignore and conflate the two so as to bolster their spurious claim that Republicans are anti-immigrant and to justify Joe Biden’s border malfeasance. Well, sadly, thanks to Biden, Americans are seeing more violent crimes being committed by illegal migrants that would otherwise not be happening if Biden actually did his job and enforced our nation’s borders. For example, in New York City, a 25-year-old illegal alien from Ecuador was arrested after sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl at a park in broad daylight. The illegal alien entered the U.S. in June 2021. In February 2022, an immigration judge ordered him deported, but that clearly did not occur. Americans are increasingly frustrated by the growing number of violent crimes being committed by illegal aliens, primarily because these crimes would not be happening if our border laws were being enforced.\nICE non-detained docket is now over seven million (PJ Media)\nDoublespeak\nSanctuary state Maryland governor wants immigration reform: One sure sign that a presidency is in dire straits is when one politically ambitious party member after another begins to stake out positions in clear opposition to their incumbent president. An El Salvadoran illegal immigrant was arrested for murdering Rachel Morin, a Maryland mother of five, last August while she was out hiking. In response, promising young Maryland Democrat Governor Wes Moore scurried off the Bad Ship Biden. “My heart is broken for the Morin family, as is our entire state,” Moore said. “She should still be here.” Moore, who perhaps has forgotten that the state he governs offers sanctuary status to illegal immigrants, is now calling for something to be done. “We have an immigration policy that needed to be dealt with and was not. The consequences then fall on us as the leaders of our individualized jurisdictions.” Sadly, though, for Rachel Morin and her five children, the governor’s words can only ring hollow. Morin’s blood, as well as the blood of Laken Riley, is on the hands of every Democrat who failed to denounce Joe Biden’s disastrous border policies from the outset.\nThe two-faced Pentagon: “Bodily autonomy is not the only argument against Covid vaccine mandates. They are also unscientific and unethical.” So said former Harvard professor Martin Kulldorff, one of three bold epidemiological experts who drafted “The Great Barrington Declaration” during the height of our nation’s COVID-19 hysteria. Sadly, though, our Department of Defense wasn’t paying attention. But it’s even worse than that. As Reuters reports, at the same time the Pentagon was mandating vaccines for all service personnel — or else be discharged — it was also running a secret anti-vaccination campaign to undermine China during the pandemic. The clandestine op “aimed to sow doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccines and other life-saving aid that was being supplied by China,” said Reuters. “Through phony internet accounts meant to impersonate Filipinos, the military’s propaganda efforts morphed into an anti-vax campaign. Social media posts decried the quality of face masks, test kits and the first vaccine that would become available in the Philippines — China’s Sinovac inoculation.” Talk about doublespeak. None of the tens of thousands of American warriors who were kicked out of the service for refusing to take the experimental stick were asked for comment.\nEconomy\nThe wrong kind of jobs report: At a time when Joe Biden is desperate for good news, a new survey of 2,000 retirees delivers just the opposite: A growing number of retired Americans are thinking about going back to work due to chronic Bidenflation. As the Motley Fool reports, “More than 66 million retirees saw their Social Security benefits increase 3.2% in 2024 due to the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), which is determined by the rate of inflation. But most aren’t satisfied with the bump, and many are considering going back to work to generate extra income.” The Fool adds, “44% of respondents are considering looking for work because Social Security does not provide enough income to support their lifestyle. That points to dissatisfaction among Social Security beneficiaries with the 2024 COLA.” And, we’d add, it points to still more electoral trouble for Joe Biden.\nBudget-busting: On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office updated its government deficit forecast for Fiscal Year 2024. The CBO added $400 billion to the previous estimate, now calculating that the total deficit will hit $1.9 trillion. The reasons for the change have everything to do with more massive government spending. The CBO pointed to Joe Biden’s college loan debt cancellation order, foreign aide spending, growing Medicaid spending, and increasing FDIC costs for the forecast change. Over the next decade, the CBO projects that the deficit will be $2.1 trillion higher than initially forecast. Furthermore, annual interest payments on the debt alone will surpass $1 trillion next year, which is more than is spent on our national defense, and by 2034 the annual debt interest payment is forecast to hit $1.7 trillion. By that same year, the overall national debt is projected to hit $50.7 trillion.\nEV startup Fisker’s U.S. units file for bankruptcy (Reuters)\nNew Boeing whistleblower says company is using defective parts on planes (Washington Examiner)\nWorld\nRussia gets NoKo backing: In an unsurprising move, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new mutual defense deal with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. The deal provides mutual defense should either of the nations be attacked and includes new trade, investment, and cultural ties. The occasion was also Putin’s first visit to the communist nation in over two decades, as the two repressive regimes seek to strengthen ties amid Putin’s ongoing war in Ukraine. Under the deal, North Korea will provide Russia with “significant munitions” and weapons, and according to U.S. intelligence, Russia will share its nuclear submarine and ballistic missile technology. The concern is that it will help North Korea complete its first nuclear-armed submarine. Furthermore, Putin’s visit will help raise Kim’s domestic profile as a world leader, strengthening his grip on power.\nHouthi terrorists sink another major commercial shipping vessel as Biden fails to establish deterrence (Daily Wire)\nBrazil’s left-wing Supreme Court imprisons prominent conservative based on U.S. Border Patrol error (Daily Wire)\nMisc.\nBiden admin sends two FBI agents to the door of nurse who helped expose illegal gender program at Texas Children’s Hospital (Not the Bee)\nOregon doctors could soon lose their licenses for “microaggressions” under proposed Medical Board rule (Washington Free Beacon)\nClimate activists vandalize Stonehenge with spray paint (National Review)\nThere is apparently a “National Gay Flag Football League” and the Buffalo Bills are sponsoring it (Not the Bee)\nFor the Executive Summary archive, click here.\nFollow Thomas Gallatin and Jordan Candler on X/Twitter.\nFEATURED ANALYSIS\nWe’re a Republic, if We Can Keep It\nRebutting CNN’s man-on-the-street attempt to scare people about “threats to democracy.”\nNate Jackson\n“A republic, if you can keep it,” Benjamin Franklin answered when asked what kind of government had been established by the 1787 constitutional convention.\nArticle IV, Section 4 of the Constitution says, “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.” The word “democracy” is nowhere to be found.\nIn explaining our Constitution, James Madison outlined some differences between republics and democracies in Federalist No. 10. He wrote, “Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.”\nIn 1776, John Adams wrote, “There is no good government but what is republican.” A year earlier, he wrote, “They define a republic to be a government of laws, and not of men.”\nOf course, Adams also said, “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.” That’s something to ponder at a time when groomers target kids, and people who don’t even know what a woman is claim that she has a right to abort her child.\nBut cultural devolution is not the point here. Our Founders, who had many more thoughts on the subject, deliberately moved us away from a monarchy and to a republic while eschewing democracy. That’s important background for CNN’s latest effort to misinform the American people.\nReporter Donie O'Sullivan, who hails from — ahem — the Republic of Ireland, conducted a “man on the street” interview about the supposed “threat to democracy” posed by Donald Trump. When many interviewees told him we live in a republic, not a democracy, he was shocked and appalled by what was clearly “an attack on democracy.”\nAfter this outrage, he scurried to the newsroom for an interview with historian Anne Applebaum to disprove these backward MAGA types. “I’ve heard a lot of conspiracy theories,” he fretted. “I hear a lot of things out on the road, but to hear Americans, people who would describe themselves as patriots, say that America is not a democracy, that stopped me in my tracks.”\nApplebaum delivered the desired authoritative line, asserting without evidence, “America is a democracy. It was founded as a democracy.” Paging Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, and John Adams.\nApplebaum had a point when she said, “Honestly, the word ‘democracy’ and the word ‘republic’ have often been used interchangeably.” Cue the clips showing Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush using the word “democracy.” She was wrong, however, in her next sentence: “There isn’t a meaningful difference between them.” Again, Madison disagreed.\nFew people see a meaningful difference because the word “democracy” has long served as shorthand for “people voting.” Insofar as that is the case, I don’t want to make a mountain out of a molehill.\nHowever, there are important points to be made about our system of government. Republics protect minorities — and I don’t mean only or primarily skin color. I also don’t mean people with very public fetishes about their private parts. I mean political minorities — people with different opinions that aren’t the most popular. I mean states with smaller populations and less power. As the saying goes, democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what’s for dinner.\nA republic elected Trump in 2016. A democracy would’ve elected Hillary Clinton. That’s why leftists break out in hives when anyone uses the word “republic.”\nApplebaum tries to turn the tables, saying that because her Democrat and Leftmedia pals assert that Trump is such a threat to democracy, the only defense Trump supporters have is to claim it’s not a democracy and conclude that “it doesn’t really matter” if Trump is “attacking democracy.” That’s a logical fallacy that assumes leftists are telling the truth.\nShe goes further, saying, “There is a part of the Republican Party that would like to rule as a minority, and they need an excuse for why that’s okay.” She thinks they mean, “‘We want Donald Trump to be able to do whatever he wants.’” That’s pure projection.\nO'Sullivan concluded the segment by asserting that a constitutional republic is really just “a form of democracy.” But, he says, “This is not actually a debate about government, about democracy; it’s an attack on democracy.”\nThese people.\nThe real reason Democrats want everyone to use the word “democracy” is because their party is named after it. Ergo, they are its defenders. The opposite could be said of the GOP, as well, but Republicans have the advantage of the Constitution establishing a republic.\nDemocrats want to destroy the Electoral College, a cornerstone of our republic. They want to pack the Supreme Court, which Joe Biden ignores to transfer student loans to taxpayers. Biden also just issued another amnesty despite having no power to do so. What did Applebaum say about a president doing “whatever he wants”? They want to end the Senate filibuster and add states just so they can have more Democrats in the Senate. They foment hateful protests and violent riots when it suits their purpose of coddling a favored minority.\nOh, and by the way, they aim to jail the leading opposition-party candidate so as to make us a banana republic.\nThe only thing that matters to Democrats is power. Anything that facilitates the acquisition of it is “democracy.” Anything that gets in their way is a “threat to democracy” — including voters knowing that we live in a republic.\nFollow Nate Jackson on X/Twitter.\nPatriot Fund Update\nIn order to reach the largest audience possible, we have never charged a subscription fee.
