It saw 465 people compete for $4.56m (£3.66m), thought to be reality TV's biggest cash prize.\nStephen Lambert, the chief executive of the studio behind that show as well as The Traitors, Race Across the World and Gogglebox, received the outstanding achievement award.\nGbemisola Ikumelo and Hammed Animashaun won the female and male comedy performance awards for Black Ops, in which they play hapless community-support officers recruited to work on a Met Police undercover operation.\nOn the red carpet, they said it was a \"delicate balance trying to make a show that had comedy, a hint of drama and a bit of social commentary\".\nThe series' overall message was \"the underdogs can win\", Ikumelo said.\n\"This is the story of the people that you think aren't important, that you overlook because of the way they look, the colour of their skin or the work they do,\" she said.\n\"Sometimes you might underestimate these people - but they are actually really important.\"\nIn total, the BBC won 21 awards across 30 categories at Tuesday's ceremony, which was hosted by comedian Tom Allen.\nBBC chief content officer Charlotte Moore said: \"The wins speak to our unwavering commitment to backing the very best British storytelling and recognised our ability to bring people together, which will be so important to us going into the future.\"\nFull list of RTS Awards\nArts: Fight the Power: How Hip Hop Changed the World\nBreakthrough award: Lucy Edwards - Japan - The Way I See It - The Travel Show\nChildren's programme: A Kind of Spark\nComedy drama: Juice\nComedy entertainment: Rob & Romesh Vs.\nComedy performance - female: Gbemisola Ikumelo - Black Ops\nComedy performance - male: Hammed Animashaun - Black Ops\nDaytime programme: Scam Interceptors\nDocumentary series: Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland\nDrama series: Happy Valley\nEntertainment: Squid Game: The Challenge\nEntertainment performance: Hannah Waddingham - Eurovision Song Contest 2023\nFormatted popular factual: Sort Your Life Out\nHistory: White Nanny, Black Child\nLeading actor - female: Tamara Lawrance - Time\nLeading actor - male: Kane Robinson - Top Boy\nLimited series: The Sixth Commandment\nLive event: Eurovision Song Contest 2023\nPresenter: Chris Packham - Inside Our Autistic Minds\nScience & the natural world: Chimp Empire\nScripted comedy: Extraordinary\nSingle documentary: Otto Baxter: Not A F***ing Horror Story\nSingle drama: Partygate\nSoap and continuing drama: EastEnders\nSports presenter, commentator or pundit: Alex Scott - Fifa Women's World Cup\nSports programme: All Ireland Senior Football Championship Final\nSupporting actor - female: Bella Ramsey - Time\nSupporting actor - male: Éanna Hardwicke - The Sixth Commandment\nWriter - comedy: Jack Rooke - Big Boys\nWriter - drama: Sarah Phelps - The Sixth Commandment\nRoyal Television Society gold medal: Dame Esther Rantzen\nJudges' award: Mr Bates vs The Post Office\nRelated topics\n- Published20 March 2024\n- Published5 October 2023\n- Published24 January 2023",
