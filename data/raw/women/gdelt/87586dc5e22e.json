  "body_text": "'I've loved every minute' - Little reaches 400 Arsenal games\n- Published\nKim Little made history on Wednesday as she became only the third player in Arsenal history to reach 400 appearances for the club.\nArsenal's club captain replaced Olivia Smith from the bench in the 82nd minute of her side's 4-0 victory over OH Leuven in the first leg of their Champions League play-off round tie.\nThe 35-year-old Scott made her Gunners debut in 2008, and is behind only Ciara Grant (403) and Emma Byrne (459) in the club's all-time appearance list.\n\"You obviously don't count when you're playing but it's so special. I have loved every minute of those 400 games,\" Little told Disney+.\n\"Leah [Williamson] said some nice words in the huddle that made me a bit emotional. I have played with Leah for a long time, she is a close friend and she just spoke about how we've been playing, how we are as a club, our humility and our respect. That's all I want.\"\nArsenal were cheered on by a strong travelling contingent of fans who are hoping to see the Champions League holders defend their title.\n\"We've got an incredible fanbase and its growing and growing,\" said Little, who after the final whistle was hoisted into the air by her team-mates.\n\"They follow us far and beyond. Makes us on the pitch feel special. It is special to be a part of this club.\"",
