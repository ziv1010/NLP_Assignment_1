  "body_text": "Before every home game, Renée Slegers gives her thoughts around the team and our upcoming game in her manager's notes published in the matchday programme.\nAhead of our return to Barclays Women's Super League action, the head coach looks back on a historic week for the club and is excited to carry that momentum into a huge game this afternoon.\nGood afternoon and welcome to Emirates Stadium for this afternoon’s clash with Manchester City. It’s going to be an exciting battle here in north London today and we’re going to bring all the energy built over this block of games to come out on top.\nThis time last week we stood together on the Emirates Stadium grass to lift the inaugural FIFA Women’s Champions Cup. It was such an honour to go up against other continental champions, challenge ourselves against brand new opposition and, ultimately, come out victorious. I’m very proud of the team for their resilience, composure and, of course, brilliant football.\nFor now, it’s time to return to a very familiar opposition. Football is a game hugely dictated by momentum and our success last weekend, following on from our win at Stamford Bridge, has boosted the belief and spirits within the squad, but we know today will pose a completely different challenge. What Manchester City have managed to achieve in the league so far this season is very impressive. They have been consistent, ruthless and come into this game off the back of a big win against Chelsea. They have a very strong spine, particularly from midfield through to the forward line, very talented wingers and excellent full backs who like to join the attack and get crosses in.\nBut we also have recent experience to draw from. Considering the rollercoaster nature of our last game against City at Joie Stadium, we were all deeply disappointed not to take three points home to London. But we bounced back, because we had to. This match is a clean slate, on our turf, and we’re ready for it.\nOur team is always delighted to play at Emirates Stadium, but these games against top teams have that added edge. The atmosphere you created away from home against Chelsea was remarkable. We can’t wait to feed off even more of that energy at the Emirates today. So bring the noise. Bring the love and the passion you have for this club. And we’ll bring a performance to be proud of. Enjoy the match, and COYG!\nRead more about the game, as well as a host of other fantastic content, by buying the Arsenal v Manchester City programme either around the stadium or online.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
