Other European leagues, including the top leagues in France and Spain, run on similar schedules.\nA spokesperson said in a media briefing Wednesday that the WSL supports the concept of the Club World Cup, as well as efforts to grow the game worldwide, but want it to happen in the summer.\n'This is a scheduling issue rather than a strategic one. The timing is what causes us real concerns,' the spokesperson said. 'At best it will cause us real scheduling issues; at worst it is going to be catastrophic for the game in this country, our commercial program and, more importantly, the welfare of our players.'\nEuropean teams can secure up to six of 16 Club World Cup qualifying spots. Prospective entrants include Arsenal, the current Women's Champions League holders, and Chelsea, the six-time reigning WSL champion.\nThe WSL spokesperson said the group was not adequately consulted by FIFA and has the option to bar English clubs from competing.\nThe club tournament would be held between a pair of marquee international summer events -- the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil and 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n'There are no gaps,' the WSL spokesperson said. 'If the tournament is in a different time zone, with the rest and recovery needed, it could lead to rearrangement of a lot of fixtures.'\nOn the men's side, FIFA has organized a Club World Cup in most years since 2000. The field expanded to 32 teams for the 2025 edition held in the United States last June and July during the European offseason. It interrupted the season for Major League Soccer, which is shifting its schedule in 2027.\nFIFA chief football officer Jill Ellis defended the proposed timing of the women's tournament in speaking with media on Tuesday and said it could be reassessed four years from now.\n'We will enter a new calendar conversation in 2030,' Ellis said. 'We will look at the entire ecosystem, taking into account all shareholders. Players are a massive part of that. (January 2028) was the window that I think everybody agreed upon.'\n--Field Level Media\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nFlip\nEmail\nGet a daily dose of Brazil Sun news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Brazil Sun.\nMore InformationWASHINGTON, D.C.: U.S. aviation regulators have issued new safety warnings for airlines operating across parts of Latin America, cautioning...\nHONG KONG: China closed 2025 with its largest trade surplus on record, underscoring how exports to the rest of the world have cushioned...\n(Photo credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images) The Women's Super League sounded the alarm about the timing of the proposed FIFA Women's...\n(Photo credit: Robert Deutsch-Imagn Images) No. 1 seed Carlos Alcaraz of Spain and a dozen more seeded men's players advanced to...\nThe European Parliament has sent the agreement with South America's Mercosur bloc for judicial review amid protests ...\nBrussels [Belgium], January 21 (ANI): European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday called for greater European independence...\nLONDON, U.K.: Britain is weighing limits more stringent on children's access to social media, including the possibility of an outright...\nDAVOS, Switzerland: The world's richest individuals tightened their grip on both wealth and political influence last year, reaching...\nNEW YORK, New York - U.S. and global stocks, foreign exchange and bond markets continued to be rattled Tuesday, as U.S. investors and...\nBRUSSELS, Belgium: European governments are weighing a sweeping trade response to pressure from Washington over Greenland, as tensions...\nSUZHOU, China: At one of China's biggest bridal hubs, shop owners are watching demographic data as closely as fashion trends, hoping...\nDUBLIN, Ireland: Ireland was among the two EU member states that saw a decrease in tourist numbers last year, even as the European...",
