  "body_text": "The United States Women’s National Team has enjoyed a fantastic year, winning the CONCACAF W Gold Cup and SheBelieves Cup before taking home the gold medal at the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. While only in the technical box for half of the calendar, Emma Hayes’ tenure started with the expected aplomb to match the hype of her hiring. A friendly against the Netherlands will wrap the schedule, providing a challenging end to the Europe-based international window that included a scoreless draw against England. ADO Den Haag Stadium (or Bingoal Stadium), a 15,000-seat multi-purpose venue located in the domestic and continental political hub of The Hague with “state-of-the-art facilities” and hybrid GrassMaster surface, will host the match.\nUSA vs. Netherlands, 2024 USWNT Friendly: Scouting The Netherlands\nEmma Hayes’ side closes out the year.\nThis is the 11th all-time meeting between the two nations, with the USMNT holding an 8-1-2 advantage and drawing the most-recent result (1-1) at the 2023 World Cup. Ranked 11th internationally by FIFA, the Netherlands failed to reach the Olympics after finishing fourth in February’s UEFA Nations League Finals with defeats to Spain (0-3) and Germany (0-2). While ultimately successful, Euro 2025 qualifying was a similar struggle with Oranje (Orange) ending Group 1 in second place with a loss and a draw to Italy (0-2, 0-0), a win and a draw over Norway (1-0, 1-1), and a victory and a tie against Finland (1-0, 1-1). Recent friendlies include successful results with Indonesia (15-0), Denmark (2-1), and China (4-1).\nAndries Jonker was appointed to lead the program in August of 2022, replacing Mark Parsons who “left the post after a disappointing Euro” campaign – the role carried a “Sarina Wiegman-shaped void” following her departure to England. In addition to briefly holding an interim position with the team in 2001, the experienced manager took charge of a variety of club sides including Volendam, MVV, Willem II, VfL Wolfsburg, and Telstar. The 62-year-old from Amsterdam has expressed frustration with the “complete chaos” of the UEFA schedule, claiming that the “men have priority,” which provides his players with “no rest at all.”\n“We’re going to do our best [against the USWNT],” Jonker said after the victory over China. “I think they’re a great opponent. I hope we’re going to win. I think we have a great chance if we play football the way we can.”\nFor the friendlies against China and the USWNT, Jonker named a 26-player roster that features some of the familiar faces including a few key returns. The domestic Eredivisie is home to 11 call-ups, while seven compete in the Women’s Super League. Manchester City striker Vivianne Miedema is out after undergoing knee surgery in late October. Florida-born Damaris Egurrola departed camp following the first match due to “knee problems” and was replaced by Fenna Kalma.\n***\nGOALKEEPERS (3): Daphne van Domselaar (Arsenal), Lize Kop (Leicester City), Femke Liefting (AZ)\nDEFENDERS (6): Dominique Janssen (Manchester United), Lynn Wilms (VfL Wolfsburg), Kerstin Casparij (Manchester City), Lisa Doorn (TSG Hoffenheim), Ilse van der Zanden (Utrecht), Veerle Buurman (PSV)\nMIDFIELDERS (10): Sherida Spitse (Ajax), Daniëlle van de Donk (Lyon), Jackie Groenen (Paris Saint-Germain), Jill Roord (Manchester City), Wieke Kaptein (Chelsea), Kayleigh van Dooren (Twente), Nina Nijstad (PSV), Danique Noordman (Ajax), Ella Peddemors (Twente), Chimera Ripa (PSV)\nFORWARDS (7): Lineth Beerensteyn (VfL Wolfsburg), Renate Jansen (PSV), Esmee Brugts (Barcelona), Romée Leuchter (Paris Saint-Germain), Chasity Grant (Aston Villa), Lotte Keukelaar (Ajax), Fenna Kalma (VfL Wolfsburg)\n***\nJonker’s preferred formation is described as “something of a mystery,” with the flexibility to employ a 4-3-3, a 4-4-2, and a 3-5-2 that utilize “pressing the opposition and getting forward at the earliest opportunity.” The “modern” style is built around “gaining various superiorities in different phases of play,” with overloads and drop-backs during the build-up phase that “draw defenders out of position and entice them to step out of the defensive block” – a mobile “moving striker” is expected to play on the front foot in order to “seek out space.” As is expected of active systems, the wingbacks are given a heavy workload laden with two-way responsibilities to spread the field, shuttle possession into the attack, and cover multiple opponents.\nFor the time being, the number-one role appears to be held by Lize Kop, who picked up four starts during Euro qualifying after several years of floating around the squad. The 26-year-old Leicester City goalkeeper is described as a “shot-stopper,” takes a high level of touches per match with constant passing, and is fairly active when coming off of her line for one of the WSL’s weaker sides. Standing at five-foot-eight, she can handle herself on aerial balls and possesses the physical strength to absorb contact from opponents without being derailed from her objective. Her work on short- and long-range opportunities is composed with a sure-handed nature, the necessary quickness in getting to ground, and the presence of mind to handle chaotic scrambles.\nManchester United’s Dominique Janssen is a mainstay on the back line with confidence and “world-class defensive abilities” born out of “the tactical maturity to read different attacking initiatives and intercept passing combinations.” She is reasonably strong in the tackle and the air but does her best work to drive the tactics forward with long-range distribution that springs the counter and splits multiple lines. At 34 years old, Sherida Spitse is still racking up starts for the Netherlands and was named Ajax’s Player of the Year in 2023 and 2024, serving as a wrecker and accurate passer in the formation. She is a regular source of scoring, fights for headers on set pieces, and makes smart decisions during the build-up, but her chief asset is the audacious location of teammates across the field.\nThe “exciting” Chasity Grant switched from Ajax to Aston Villa in August, an attack-minded wing-back who “brings a lot of [speed]” and makes significant contributions with her tackling, intercepting, and heading. Whether advanced or deeper in the formation, she has an intelligent understanding of space and uses her frame to absorb contact and shield away opponents during runs into the final third. There is also Kerstin Casparij of Manchester City, described as a “modern, quick right wing-back” who thrives in a possession-based style with a high passing accuracy in the short- and medium-range. Her touch on the ball is impeccable with deft trapping and quick turns up the field while also thriving as a weak-side defender with well-timed volleyed clearances and tackles in isolation.\nJackie Groenen is a fibrous presence in the engine room, dropping deep to aid the centre-backs in possession but also stepping into the final third with menacing intent. The 29-year-old Paris Saint-Germain “box-to-box” midfielder and elite judoka provides the constant drumbeat and withstands pressure, taking quick dribbles into open space and pinging balls to teammates. The teenaged Wieke Kaptein enjoyed a fast rise in 2023 and earned a spot on the World Cup roster, continuing to gain reps for Oranje and Chelsea by bringing “brilliant energy in the middle of the park” while “playing between both boxes really well” with a “tenacious” style. Target Scouting hails her “discipline in carrying out tasks” despite her young age, knowing exactly where to be and what to do during the build-up and when dropping back to aid the centre-backs, displaying calmness and composure. After missing eight months with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, Jill Roord has returned to the field for both club and country, bringing “high-level passing ability” and the “clever ability to locate small pockets of space.” She is noted as “one of the greatest talents in Europe” as a dynamic interpreter who combines with teammates and plays as a “combative, aggressive, and energetic presser,” refusing opponents a break in either phase.\nThis is the last ride for Daniëlle van de Donk, as the multi-line veteran is set to retire after EURO 2025 and over 15 years of service to the Netherlands, providing a creative spark by “identifying gaps in the opposition defenses that put her teammates in behind.” The 33-year-old Lyon dynamo is a hard-working defender and cannot be shut down or penned into corners and specializes in breaking down crowded areas with angled balls and unpredictable movements. Still a relatively young talent but no longer a neophyte on the world stage, Esmee Brugts is a terrifyingly productive presence with eight senior goals for the Netherlands, seemingly adding to her highlight reel of dribbling flourishes and finishes with each fixture. Total Football Analysis praises her work in tight and open spaces by consolidating her touches and making quick decisions but also notes the abilities to “transfer the ball out of danger” and “recognize threats early.” Lineth Beerensteyn started every match during Euro qualifying and is on a torrid run of form for new club VfL Wolfsburg with eight goals in ten Bundesliga matches, a sometime-winger whose “fast, explosive” nature enables her to thrive on the counter and in quick-reaction opportunities. She is a driven, intelligent dribbler who uses her body and plays angles in order to dissuade opponents from even attempting challenges while also displaying a delicate touch with a variety of neat flicks.\nThe USWNT is looking to end a fantastic year on a positive note, although the result will have zero bearing on the work that Hayes has done to return the program to glory. Playing England and the Netherlands on the road is a well-scheduled challenge that should provide further experience for the younger players and an opportunity to build chemistry for the squad as a whole. With Oranje in the midst of a slump as evidenced by the failure to qualify for the Olympics and a subpar performance in Euro qualifying, the visitors should be expected to roll with a victory.\nThe match is scheduled for Tuesday, December 3rd at 2:45 p.m. Eastern, 11:45 a.m. Pacific. Viewing options include TNT, truTV, Universo, Max, Peacock, and Fubo TV (free trial).",
