Everybody gets that,\" said the FA's director of women's football Sue Campbell.\nThe WSL has followed the Premier League's lead in becoming a home for the top talent from around the world.\nNinety-four players from the English top-flight represented their nations at the World Cup, 31 more than the US National Women's Soccer League, which had traditionally been the standard bearer for the sport.\nChelsea have lost two of those as former captain Magdalena Eriksson and her partner Pernille Harder have departed for Bayern Munich.\nBut Emma Hayes' women remain favourites to defend their title, with American international Catarina Macario among their summer signings.\nArsenal have struck a major blow against United with the capture of England striker Alessia Russo on a free transfer to assemble a frightening array of firepower.\nBeth Mead and Vivianne Miedema are also fit again for the Gunners after suffering anterior cruciate ligament injuries.\nCity dropped out of the top three for the first time in nine years last season and are expected to bounce back with England stars Lauren Hemp and Chloe Kelly in their ranks.\n© 2023 AFP",
