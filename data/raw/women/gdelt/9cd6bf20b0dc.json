  "body_text": "Football pundit Gary Lineker has slammed Spanish FA president Luis Rubiales over his kissing of Jennifer Hermoso during the country's World Cup win.\nLineker called the president an \"awful bloke\" after news spread that the Spanish federation was looking to take legal action over claims that this was not consensual.\nSpeaking on X (commonly known as Twitter), he said: \"What??? Such a disgrace that one awful bloke has taken all the attention away from the Spanish women’s wonderful achievement. Shameful!\"\nThis comes after Rubiales refused to resign from his position in a bizarre press conference where he repeatedly declared: \"I will not resign\".\nDua Lipa has learned to keep 'certain aspects' of her life private\nDuring the conference, he also ranted about how the kiss was \"mutual\" and spoke of \"unjust\" campaigns and \"fake feminism\".\nThe FA president also sparked outrage when he grabbed his crotch in front of Queen Letizia (of Spain) and her 16-year-old daughter. He apologised for his actions but the country's PM has said this is \"not enough\".\nEngland's Lionesses speak out over Spanish World Cup kiss as Rubiales says he won't resign\nGary Lineker is not the only voice to have spoken out against Rubiales with World Cup runner-ups the Lionesses also releasing a statement.\nThe England team said: \"Unacceptable actions allowed to happen by a sexist and patriarchal organisation. Abuse is abuse and we have all seen the truth.\n\"The behaviour of those who think they are invincible must not be tolerated and people shouldn’t need convincing to take action against any form of harassment. We all stand with you, Jenni Hermoso and all players of the Spanish team.\"\nEngland's Jess Carter also added: \"It's obviously just something that's clearly unacceptable and it's really sad that it totally ruined what was supposed to be the most special moment, probably, in Hermoso's career.\"\nRecently, it was confirmed that FIFA would suspend Rubiales pending an investigation into his conduct.\nIn a statement, it said: \"The chairman of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, Jorge Ivan Palacio (Colombia), in use of the powers granted by article 51 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code (FDC), has decided today to provisionally suspend Mr. Luis Rubiales from all football-related activities at national and international level.\"",
