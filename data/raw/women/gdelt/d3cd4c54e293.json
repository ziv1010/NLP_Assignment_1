We didn't get it right from early on to late in the game.\"\nDespite the result, Ballantyne remained optimistic that the fourth-placed could once again return to the top of the table with seven games remaining in the season.\n\"It's on us; we've got six points to make up to get on top,\" he said.\n\"There's still one third of the season left and the team that can put seven wins together wins the league.\n\"We've got very strong characters in the group and some very good football players. It's just a matter of getting it right.\"\nSTRENGTH-TO-STRENGTH\nWhile it was a tough road trip for the men's side, the Strikers' Women's Super League side notched up their 10th win of the season.\nA double to Lucy Foote and Madeline Payne led the visitors to a 6-0 victory against the Knights on Saturday, July 13.\nBallantyne had nothing but praise for the side's efforts and even said parts of the game were \"really joyful to watch\".\n\"They've really taken on what we're trying to do with them and they just seem to be having fun now,\" he said.\nWhitney Knight and Danielle Capel also hit the scoreboard.\nGOALS GALORE\nA six-goal haul from Jordan Payne has helped the club's NPL Tasmania under 21 side to a hefty victory against Glenorchy.\nThe visitors proved difficult to stop in front of goals in the 12-0 win. Overeager Miles Barnard also hit the scoreboard on five occasions.\nThe win helps to cement the side's place at the top-of-the-table.\nNORTHERN CHAMPS MEN\n- Burnie United draw with Riverside 1-1\n- Launceston United def. by Ulverstone 1-4\n- Northern Rangers d. Devonport 8-1\nNORTHERN CHAMPS WOMEN\n- Launceston United def. by Ulverstone 0-1\n- Launceston City d. Somerset 5-0",
