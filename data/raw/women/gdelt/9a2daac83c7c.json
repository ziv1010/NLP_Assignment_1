  "body_text": "ST. LOUIS (AP) — Kyren Paris hit a tying triple in the seventh inning, Nolan Schanuel gave Los Angeles its first lead with a grounder in the 10th and the Angels held off the St. Louis Cardinals 5-4. Mike Trout had two RBIs for the Angels, who scored three runs on sacrifice flies and finally went ahead in the 10th without a hit. Ryan Johnson earned his first career save in his second major league appearance. Lars Nootbaar hit a leadoff homer and Brendan Donovan also went deep for the Cardinals. Nolan Arenado had an RBI single.\nMILWAUKEE (AP) — Kris Bubic struck out eight in six shutout innings in his first start in nearly two years, and the Kansas City Royals spoiled Milwaukee’s home opener with an 11-1 victory over the winless Brewers. Maikel Garcia and Salvador Perez homered for the Royals. Jonathan India had three hits and drove in two runs one day after he was struck on the left side of his face by a 98.9-mph pitch from Cleveland’s Emmanuel Clase. Bubic allowed three hits and walked two in his first start since April 15, 2023. The 27-year-old left-hander had Tommy John surgery later that month, and he pitched as a reliever last season.\nMILWAUKEE (AP) — Kansas City’s Jonathan India showed no signs of fear after getting hit by a 98.9-mph pitch. First he requested to get in the Royals’ starting lineup the next day. He then went 3 for 5 with two runs and a pair of RBIs as Kansas City trounced the Milwaukee Brewers 11-1 on Monday afternoon. India’s response amazed his teammates. They saw how frightening a scene it was Sunday when a pitch from Cleveland’s Emmanuel Clase hit India’s batting helmet on the left side of his face during the ninth inning of the Royals’ 6-2 loss to the Cleveland Guardians.\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Atlanta Braves outfielder Jurickson Profar has been suspended for 80 games without pay for performance-enhancing drug use. Major League Baseball announced that Profar tested positive for Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG). The suspension of Profar is effective immediately. Barring postponed games, Profar would be eligible to return June 29 against Philadelphia and would lose $5,806,440 of his $12 million salary. He is also ineligible for the postseason. Profar apologized in a statement and said he would never knowingly take a banned substance. He calls it “the most difficult day” of his career. Profar was an All-Star last season with San Diego.\nSPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Paige Bueckers carried UConn to its record 24th Final Four of the women’s NCAA Tournament, scoring 31 points Monday night in a 78-64 victory over Southern California, which couldn’t overcome the loss of injured star JuJu Watkins. UConn heads to Tampa, Florida, to face overall No. 1 seed UCLA on Friday. Freshman Sarah Strong added 22 points and 17 rebounds for the second-seeded Huskies, who have won a record 11 NCAA titles, all under coach Geno Auriemma. Their most recent championship was in 2016, the last of a run of four straight. Rayah Marshall scored 23 points for top-seeded USC.\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Madison Booker scored 18 points and No. 1 seed Texas used its stifling defense to reach the Final Four of the women’s NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2003, beating well-traveled point guard Hailey Van Lith and second-seeded TCU 58-47. The Longhorns will face defending champion South Carolina on Friday night in Tampa, Florida, for a spot in the national title game. Texas won a regional final for the first time under coach Vic Schaefer, who previously made two Final Four trips with Mississippi State. The Longhorns’ 35 wins are one more than its only national title-winning squad had in 1986 under Jody Conradt, who was in the stands Monday night.\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — The women’s Final Four is full of star players, top seeds and historic programs. There will be no Cinderellas in Tampa, Florida, this week with No. 1 seeds South Carolina, UCLA and Texas in the national semifinals. They are joined by the betting favorite to win it all, second-seeded UConn, which has been playing the best of any team over the past month and knocked off a top-seeded Southern California team that was missing its best player. Coach Dawn Staley and the defending champion Gamecocks are making their fifth straight trip to the Final Four. UConn has been there a record 24 times.\nUNDATED (AP) — Fittingly for an NCAA Tournament in which big schools from big conferences took record numbers of spots in the first week, then hogged them all for the second week, the Final Four will bring four teams seeded No. 1 to the sport’s biggest stage to play for the title. When Florida meets Auburn in an all-Southeastern Conference clash and Duke faces Houston in a meeting between the Atlantic Coast and Big 12 conferences, it will mark only the second time since seeding began in 1979 that all four No. 1s have made it to the final weekend.\nUNDATED (AP) — Duke, Houston, Florida and Auburn have posted elite efficiency numbers in making it a rare Final Four featuring only 1-seeds. Those four teams head to San Antonio this week. Duke, Houston and Auburn ranked in the top 5 of KenPom's daily rankings all season. Throw in Florida, and the four teams have ranked atop those KenPom rankings since the first half of February. Additionally, all four teams have KenPom net-efficiency marks of +35 or better going into the week. By comparison, only six teams have done that in data going back to the 1996-97 season.\nKANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) — Longtime manager Peter Vermes is out at Sporting Kansas City. The MLS club announced Monday that it “mutually agreed to part ways” with Vermes after nearly two decades and with Sporting KC chasing its first win since mid-September of last season. Vermes became the club’s technical director in 2006 before being elevated to head coach in 2009. The member of the U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame ranks third on the all-time MLS list with 203 regular-season wins. He is the only person to win the MLS Cup as a player and a coach with the same team. Sporting KC lost five of its first six games of the 2025 season. Kerry Zavagnin was appointed interim head coach.\nPALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The “tush push” is the hottest topic at the NFL’s annual meetings this week. Team owners, coaches and general managers have gathered at a posh resort to discuss several potential rule changes, including the Green Bay Packers’ proposal to eliminate a play that’s become a short-yardage staple for the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. The Packers cited player safety and pace of play as reasons for banning the tush push. NFL executive Troy Vincent said last month there have been zero injuries reported as a result of the play. Any rule change must be approved by 24 out of 32 team owners. Tampa Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles made it clear last month he wouldn’t support a ban.\nWEST SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — When a drone suddenly appeared near the left-field wall at Sutter Health Park, Athletics bat boy Stewart Thalblum decided to help thwart it. The drone tried to lift him off the grass but Thalblum used a bat and brought it down, careful not to cut himself with the spinning blades. Once the device had been corralled, Thalblum handed it off to a security guard. The drone appeared with Seth Brown batting for the Athletics in the seventh inning of the Chicago Cubs’ 18-3 rout and it delayed the game for a few minutes.\nMONDAY SCORES\nMAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL\nINTERLEAGUE\nFinal Kansas City 11 Milwaukee 1\nFinal Cincinnati 14 Texas 3\nFinal Tampa Bay 6 Pittsburgh 1\nFinal Toronto 5 Washington 2\nFinal L.A.
