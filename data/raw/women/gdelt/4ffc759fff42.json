We’ve just had a chance to come back to Australia and play the Olympic qualifiers in Perth, and to see sell-out crowds in my hometown was epic.”\nThe Chelsea player also became engaged to US player Kristie Mewis during the year but told how the action on the pitch was the highlight for her.\n“Playing to packed stadiums around the country, in front of family and friends, while having the whole country support and get behind us was the highlight of 2023 for me,” she said.\nNow the hometown hero said her focus is on finding the next generation of Matildas.\nTaking matters into her own hands, she said: “We are already seeing changes with funding being announced, which means better facilities and more opportunities for young girls to play the sport. I’ve also launched my own football schools, Sam Kerr Football, which will be starting early next year. SKF will hopefully inspire the next generation of kids and give young players the best chance to live out their potential on the pitch and to fall in love with the beautiful game.”\nWith the Paris Olympics in her sights, she said on her World Cup heroics, “It was a surreal time and something I will remember for the rest of my life.”\nFellow teammate Mary Fowler posed on the magazine’s cover for the prestigious awards. Fowler, 20, has seen her profile shoot through the roof both because of her on-pitch heroics and her high-profile romance with NRL star Nathan Cleary.\nOther WA winners inside Sydney’s Foundation Hall, Museum of Contemporary Art included singer Amy Manford, who won Creative of the Year and Tin Turner Musical star Ruva Nywenga, who won Rising Star of the Year.\nPop’s comeback queen Kylie Minogue won Entertainer of the Year, chosen by a panel of judges that included Grace Tame, Jessica Mauboy, Teresa Palmer, Janice Peterson, Kylie Kwong, Christine Holgate, Sarah Harden, Jane Huxley and Georgie Abay.\nFull list of winners at the 2023 Marie Claire Women of the Year Awards:\n- Champions of the Year: The Matildas\n- Icon of the Year: Sam Kerr\n- Entertainer of the Year: Kylie Minogue\n- Eco Warrior of the Year: Lottie Dalziel\n- Voice of Now: Chanel Contos and Maria Thattil (joint)\n- Powerhouse of the Year: Prof. Megan Davis\n- Advocate of the Year: Hannah Diviney\n- Designer of the Year: Rebecca Vallance\n- Rising Star of the Year: Ruva Nywenga\n- Changemaker of the Year: Jess Hill\n- Creative of the Year: Amy Manford and Made Up Stories (joint)",
