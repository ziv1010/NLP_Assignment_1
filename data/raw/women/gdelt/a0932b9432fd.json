  "body_text": "Pubs will be allowed to stay open until 1am if England or Wales reach the semi-finals or final of the Uefa Women’s European Championships.\nThe Home Office has announced that football fans will get extra time to celebrate if either home nation reaches the final stages of the Women’s Euros in July.\nIt would see closing hours of pubs put back from the usual 11pm cut off.\nLicensing hours can be relaxed to mark an occasion of “exceptional national significance”.\nEngland’s Lionesses are defending champions while Wales have qualified for the competition for the first time.\nBoth teams have been drawn in the same group, alongside France and the Netherlands.\nPolicing minister Dame Diana Johnson, said: “Nothing quite brings people together like watching our national football teams, which is why we want fans to be able to enjoy every minute of these matches.\n“We will extend licensing hours should either team progress through the tournament, to allow supporters to watch and celebrate together for longer.\n“I want to wish the best of luck to both teams and let’s hope for some more memorable nights this summer.”\nThe semi-finals take place on July 22 and July 23 while the final kicks off on July 27.\nAny home nation glory on the pitch could also see success for the hospitality industry which has welcomed the move to keep the doors open for longer.\nThe announcement is being made now ahead of the tournament – in Switzerland from July 2 to 27 – so pubs can sort out stock and staffing.\nIt also gives enough time to arrange the statutory instruments needed potentially to extend opening hours before Parliament’s summer recess.\nNight Time Industries Association chief executive Michael Kill described the extended hours as “a positive and progressive move that recognises the growing popularity of women’s football and its cultural significance across the UK”.\nHe said: “Much like previous extensions for national celebrations, this decision will give communities the opportunity to come together and celebrate in a safe and responsible way, while also providing a welcome boost to the night-time economy.\n“It represents a valuable opportunity for hospitality businesses to maximise trade during a major event – particularly important in today’s extremely challenging economic climate.”\nEngland will be hoping to defend the title they won at Wembley Stadium in July 2022 when they beat Germany in the final.\nRecommended reading:\n- Half of Brits not aware of the 50-year ban on women's football\n- Women’s sport to be front and centre in 2025\n- JD Wetherspoon to introduce new burger range\nThe two home nations will face off during this year’s tournament group stages on Sunday, July 13 in St Gallen.\nEngland will face France on July 5 when Wales will play the Netherlands.\nOn July 9 England will play the Netherlands while Wales’s opponents will be the Netherlands.\nScotland and Northern Ireland have separate licensing regimes.",
