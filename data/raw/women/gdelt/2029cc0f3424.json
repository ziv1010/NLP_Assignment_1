  "body_text": "Another day, another forward is linked with Manchester United with widespread reports suggesting free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin could be snapped up by the Europa League runners-up.\nThe England international is available after failing to sign a new deal with Everton after nine seasons at Goodison Park which promised greatness only for injuries to limit his potential.\nChampionship winners Leeds United were keen on signing the 28-year-old last month but dropped their interest because of his wage demands and it is believed the former Toffees target man ideally wants to join a club which is involved in Europe next season.\nChampions League Newcastle, who are 11/2 with William Hill and bet365, would be ideal candidates as they are searching for a goalscorer to push Alexander Isak after recently missing out on Brighton forward Joao Pedro who has opted to sign for Chelsea.\nBut moving from Merseyside to Manchester would appeal to Calvert-Lewin and Old Trafford boss Ruben Amorim is reportedly keen on the switch, especially if he can get Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia off the payroll with Rasmus Hojlund also primed to leave.\nCalvert-Lewin only scored three times in 26 Premier League outings last season but has previously managed double figures in back-to-back campaigns and would line up with Matheus Cunha, who has been snapped up from Wolves for £62.5million.\nUnited have offered Brentford a similar amount for Cameroon attacker Bryan Mbeumo but the Bees are holding out for at least £65million with United still monitoring the situation between Viktor Gyokeres and Amorim’s former club Sporting, although Arsenal appear to hold the upper hand if negotiations develop.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nCalvert-Lewin’s decision to run down his Everton contract and become a free agent saves money for United which can be spent elsewhere and the lure of playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world would satisfy his ambitions. That makes odds of 5/1 with Hills that he is wearing the famous red shirt at the start of next term difficult to ignore.\nWimbledon odds: End of the road for Cilic\nMarin Cilic is enjoying a renaissance in the twilight of his career with a strong run into the second week at Wimbledon, but it is possible he will find his next rival too hot to handle.\nThe 36-year-old has been involved in a couple of gruelling matches with a four-set victory over British hope Jack Draper followed by a similar success against Jaume Munar, who took the prized scalp of Alexander Bublik, a dark horse to win the title before a ball was hit, in the first round.\nNext up it’s Flavio Cobolli, who has yet to drop a set, and the 22nd seed’s last victory was an impressive one against No.15 seed Jakub Mensik. The Italian is evens to reach the quarter-finals with William Hill, Betfred and 888Sport.\nMore Trending\nClara Tauson has never reached the quarter-finals of a grand slam but that will change if she beats Iga Swiatek in what promises to be a thrilling match as Wimbledon’s women’s singles battle gathers pace.\nThe 22-year-old right-hander from Denmark will be full of confidence after defeating former champion Elena Rybakina in straight sets in the last round and can push Swiatek, who has picked up form on grass after losing her French Open crown at Roland Garros last month, all the way.\nIt is 13/8 with Paddy Power, Betfair and Sky Bet this goes to a deciding set and although the outcome is a tougher call, a small flutter on Tauson winning 2-1 is interesting at 13/2 with Ladbrokes, Coral, Sporting Index and SpreadEx.\nMORE: The huge transfer fee Chelsea expect to receive from Arsenal for Noni Madueke\nMORE: Martin Zubimendi speaks out on why he chose Arsenal over Real Madrid\nMORE: Last words of hero dad who died helping his family escape devastating Texas floods",
