Keep going, you can achieve anything you set your mind to.”\n“Sometimes success looks like this – collecting trophies and sometimes it’s waking up and putting one foot in front of the other. There’s only one of you in the world and it’s more than good enough, be unapologetically yourself.”\nAfter thanking everyone once again, host Jermain Jenas helped her down the steps and back to her teammates.\nEarps beat last years winner Christiane Endler and Ann-Katrin Berger to the prestigious award.",
