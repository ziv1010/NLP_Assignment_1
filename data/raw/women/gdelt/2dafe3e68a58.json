It's estimated Woden Valley has approximately 2000 juniors currently.\nThere are also potential commercial benefits for both clubs covering such a wide geographical area and getting a significant player numbers boost. Both clubs share the Hellenic Club as a sponsor.\nIt remains unclear exactly which club brought the proposal to the table, but it is understood there has been at least one meeting between senior representatives from each club two weeks ago. Woden Valley's committee has not yet been formally presented with the proposal.\n\"Any considerations with respect to this issue are a matter for the Woden Valley Soccer Club committee,\" a Woden Valley spokesperson said.\nThe value of clubs established in the NPL system has never been greater since Capital Football announced in May its overhaul for next season following a review report that sent shockwaves through the soccer community in the region.\nThe review led to the men's Capital Premier League competition - a grade below NPL Men - being scrapped for next season, with promotion and relegation going forward to involve the lower level, Community League 1, as long as clubs declare their interest and meet eligibility for NPL promotion.\nThe top NPL men's competition was also expanded from eight to 10 teams to play 18 rounds, with a six-team finals series over three weeks and a new pre-season competition against Illawarra Premier League sides.\nAll Riverina clubs were dropped from Capital Football competitions next year, which impacted Yoogali Soccer Club's NPL men's teams and Wagga City Wanderers' CPL and NPL boys teams.\nThe latter's NPL boys contingent was reinstated for 2026 following an appeal to Capital Football as long as they are not relegated which would prompt further review, while Yoogali SC's NPL men exclusion was upheld with the sporting body arguing the club was not \"compliant\" in regards to demonstrating its youth development pathway.\nWith Yoogali SC punted from NPL, at the end of the 2025 CPL season, the top three men's teams on the ladder that meet the eligibility criteria are to be promoted to the NPL next year. As it currently stands, that would be Belconnen United, Canberra Olympic and Brindabella Blues.\nChanges recommended in the Capital Football review for NPL Boys and Girls have also led to frustration from clubs.\nLeft in limbo amid a lack of consultation and communication from Capital Football, Monaro Panthers went public with their outrage over the NPL Boys overhaul.\nOn Monday, the Panthers shared a petition on its social media accounts, calling for Capital Football to give all clubs more time before implementing the changes outlined in the NPL review report.\nMonaro was also among the \"coalition of clubs\" that wrote a joint letter to Capital Football in early July, along with Canberra Croatia, Queanbeyan City, White Eagles FC, Juventus FC, Tigers FC, O'Connor Knights, Belconnen United, Wagga City Wanderers, Yoogali FC, and ANU FC.\nThough each club had various concerns, they all banded together to request further dialogue with Capital Football and asked for a pause on implementing the review's recommendations next year.\nThe Panthers are concerned that its current complete pathway offered from MiniRoos to the NPL and Masters will now become broken. The club has been excluded from playing in NPL Boys grades next year with teams reduced from 14 to 10.\nThe flow-on effect of an incomplete elite pathway is that junior players will leave to rival clubs that do offer an NPL Boys program. That causes a drain on Monaro's junior numbers, and also puts in jeopardy the Panthers' ability to fulfil Capital Football's criteria for its NPL Men team that requires clubs to fill all age grades at junior level.\nMORE CANBERRA SPORT\nCurrently Monaro's elite girls program go through Bella Monaro's NPL Girls pathway as part of a partnership.\n\"Our boys pathway will be broken and disjointed,\" Monaro committee member, Tina Brandt, said.\n\"Wagga got an exemption which made us feel that Capital Football can change the decision.\"\nBrandt met with Capital Football chief executive Samantha Farrow to discuss the review and has also put in a request for an audience with the board.\nMonaro did not apply for an exemption to the Capital Football review as it did not expect the implementation of recommendations to happen so fast.\n\"My key message to [Farrow] was I just wanted more time,\" Brandt said.\n\"I feel the review should have had a three-year grace period as minimum... but I would take one more year.\n\"It's not just us. We have to fight our own fight, but we have the interest of the competition at heart.\n\"There's a sentiment from families that they have invested in Monaro for a long time, and now that's for nothing. If you're playing under-13s this year, and you're hoping to come into our NPL Boys under-14s next year, it won't be there.\n\"They'll go to another NPL club which is understandable, older kids may go to another sport or they might play division one in the Junior League, which is a lower level of competition, a less intense program, and there's no trials. It's not the same as the NPL.\"\nBrandt also pointed out the superior playing fields and infrastructure that Monaro Panthers offers to Capital Football's NPL Boys competitions will be lost, with the club's location over the ACT border allowing for additional investment from NSW government and Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council.\n\"I think Capital Football haven't considered that aspect. I'm not getting the sentiment that they care,\" Brandt said.\n\"The benefit that quality grounds is it makes for improved play and training, which makes better players and it means less injuries.\"\nAs a result of their NPL Boys omission the Panthers committee is investigating its potential options for elite junior pathways playing under Football NSW rather than Capital Football.\nAn increased presence of the club's entire community is expected at this Saturday's Monaro Panthers NPL men's game at Riverside Stadium to \"send a message about the importance of grassroots sports\".\n\"We've only got a couple of weeks left of a fight,\" Brandt said.",
