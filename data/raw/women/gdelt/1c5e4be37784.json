  "body_text": "It was in February last year, after yet more upheaval, that Everton Women’s chief executive Alan McTavish realised something substantial had to change.\nMcTavish and other members of the club hierarchy, including recently appointed director of football Kevin Thelwell, were searching for their third manager of the season — a replacement for Frenchman Jean-Luc Vasseur.\nAdvertisement\nAs on the men’s side, Everton Women were locked in a debilitating cycle of churn. After a period of investment, hopes had been high before last season — so much so that some in the game were tipping them for a tilt at a top-four position — but a side with lofty ambitions was tangibly underachieving. The reset button was being pressed too often.\n“It was a challenging season on and off the pitch,” McTavish tells The Athletic. “We had more managerial changes than we would have wanted.”\nThe need for carefully planned, sustainable growth was clear. They had to get the next steps right. So Everton appointed the caretaker duo of Chris Roberts and Claire Ditchburn and took their time.\nTogether, McTavish and Thelwell “mapped the managerial landscape in Europe and further afield and “assessed lots of different options”, as the former puts it.\nEventually, following a series of video and in-person meetings, they settled on Fortuna Hjorring coach Brian Sorensen.\n“Brian was the standout candidate,” McTavish says. “He was clear from day one in how he wanted to play and it was aligned with what we wanted. What he said privately was very similar to what (men’s manager) Sean Dyche has been saying publicly. It was about hard work and determination.\n“Sorensen also demonstrated his expertise in being focused for 20 years on the women’s game. His knowledge of players at all levels of women’s football globally is encyclopaedic.”\nSorensen would not start officially until June but Everton reached an agreement with Fortuna that would allow him to see out the season there but also fly over to England every couple of weeks to help with preparations for the upcoming campaign.\n“When he came here to deliver his final presentation to myself and Kevin, it was the day of the game against Chelsea,” McTavish recalls. “So he had been at Walton Hall Park and then seen the team in action — it all helped with the planning for the new season.”\nAdvertisement\nThe evidence is that the new approach is paying off.\nSorensen’s side are on the rise, a point behind fifth-placed Aston Villa with a game in hand. They play with a clear identity, pressing high and looking to build from the back in possession.\nIt is a far cry from the underachievement of last term, when they finished 10th out of 12.\nThe improvement is underpinned by savvy recruitment. Summer signings Karen Holmgaard and Katrine Veje, two Denmark internationals, have both impressed. Unable to match some of the top sides financially, Everton have also mastered the loan market, bringing in Jess Park, Emily Ramsey and Aggie Beever-Jones from Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea. Park and Ramsey have already received England recognition this season after shining for Sorensen’s side.\nRecruitment is a collaborative process. Sorensen, his assistant Stephen Neligan, McTavish and general manager Aaron Little are all involved in discussions over potential targets.\n“We look at the stats, data and likelihood of governing body endorsement,” McTavish says.\n“Kevin (Thelwell) was heavily involved in the appointment of Sorensen but not so much in player-trading conversations. We consult regularly and have monthly meetings. Why wouldn’t you tap into his experience?\n“It’s a jigsaw. It’s important to retain experience in the squad but there has been a move to recruit younger players. This season with the loans, we’ve taken three young, very talented English players because we were confident they would have suitable opportunities here.\n“But age almost doesn’t matter if they have the attributes Brian wants. There are a couple of players mentioned by Brian during his presentation who he thought could positively influence the group.”\nIn his interview for the job, Sorensen had highlighted Park and Beever-Jones as potential targets and examples of how he wanted his side to look.\n“They were on my list before I was even here,” the Dane says. “I knew how they would fit in.\nAdvertisement\n“I recruit mindset first, and then skills. The most important is the right mentality. I need people I can trust. They need to give energy to the group. I love people who have an edge but they need to be able to function in a group.\n“I want them to have the hunger to learn and improve.”\nSorensen’s aim was to build a “clear identity” where the formation sometimes changes but “the principle of playing is always the same”. He wants his side to dominate games and impose their will on the opposition.\n“One of the most important principles is playing against the opposition’s pressure, because that’s how you control the game,” he says. “We want to break the first pressure. That’s what we work on.\n“We work in four phases. Phase one is goal kicks and our first third — it’s about how we can force them into phase two. Then phase two can be between the boxes — it’s about how you break into phase three. Phase three is breaking through in the final third and phase four is shooting on goal. We look for numerical advantages across the pitch.\n“Phase one and two have been nailed down pretty well. We play out against every team. Three and four are where we are really looking for more control. We are trying to teach the players that we need to find the right moment to push the knife in. If you go straight at goal all the time it’s like pushing ketchup out of a bottle. It won’t happen for a long time and then suddenly BANG.”\nOther members of the squad have been repurposed. The decision to move Gabby George, a talented centre-back pushing for England selection, and Scotland midfielder Lucy Graham (now Lucy Hope) to unfamiliar wing-back roles was initially surprising. But both have adapted well to their new positions.\n“I look at skill set and attributes for the way we want to play,” he explains. “I don’t want to put a lid over them and kill their strong skills. Gabby is so explosive, has a good engine and is defensively strong. Needs to work on her offence but is improving there with goals and assists.\nAdvertisement\n“The way I want to play, the centre-backs have to be super-calm on the ball. Gabby needs to release her energy. She can use that power at wing-back.\n“Lucy was a midfielder who could play No 6, No 8 or No 10. She needs space and there’s not much space inside. She can’t stand still. I want my midfielders to be very controlled.”\nDefender Megan Finnigan is an academy graduate and currently the longest-serving player at Everton Women.\nShe is well-placed to offer an insight into Sorensen and how he differs from what has come before.\n“This is probably the most I’ve enjoyed my football,” Finnigan, 24, says. “That’s a lot to do with Brian and his staff but also how we’re doing as a team.\n“The main change is that he has such a clear identity. I’ve never had that under a manager before. We don’t change the way we play depending on the opposition.\n“We’re taking more risks but we’re doing what he asks and he takes the ownership. We start attacks in the back line and adapt every week depending on the opposition press. It suits me as a ball-playing centre-back — I’m putting in consistent performances and developing.\n“We’re happy with the progress made compared to last season but obviously don’t just want to be content with fifth place.”\nMcTavish says Everton’s ultimate aim in the long term is to compete with the two Manchester clubs, Arsenal and Chelsea.\nIt is an admirable goal but the challenge is substantial. At the halfway stage of the season, Everton are seven points behind Arsenal in fourth and 13 behind WSL leaders Manchester United. That quartet keeps investing and getting stronger, but so do rivals in the chasing pack, such as Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa. Everton are looking to find another way.\n“Longer term, competing against the two Manchester clubs, Arsenal and Chelsea is going to be difficult because you’ve seen in recent windows that those clubs are strengthening even further,” McTavish says.\nAdvertisement\n“How can we work smarter and differently? Player identification might be an example. Are there players with similar attributes who maybe aren’t as prominent, who we can identify and provide with a platform?\n“Tottenham spent a UK-record fee on (England international) Bethany England. Villa have signed top players too. They are maybe taking a different approach to us. They are going for tried and tested players. What you’ve got just below the four is a group of teams below the top four utilising different strategies.”\nSorensen is also cautiously optimistic. This has been a season of progress, six months in which Everton have got back on track.\nHope has returned, but he is not looking to cut corners. The process continues. Under Sorensen, Everton will keep building one block at a time.\n“We’re closer,” he says. “The only way to get to the top is to continue to invest.\n“It’s not about having the biggest budget — I can get players where they want to go. We need to be one step ahead in finding the ones yet to break through.\n“Players would want to come here because they can see they will play and we play attractive football.\n“It takes time to build up.”\n(Top photo: Emma Simpson – Everton FC/Everton FC via Getty Images)",
