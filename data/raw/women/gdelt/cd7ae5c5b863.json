Barron Trump once joined FLOTUS.\nFirst lady Melania Trump is receiving the 2025 White House Christmas Tree on Nov. 24, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.\nKorson’s Tree Farms of Michigan was named the 2025 National Christmas Tree Association (NCTA) Grand Champion Growers and will present the tree to the White House. Traditionally, it arrives in a horse-drawn carriage.\nThe tree's arrival is the first event marking the holiday season at the White House. After receiving trick-or-treaters the day before Halloween, President Donald Trump is also scheduled to pardon a turkey ahead of Thanksgiving on Nov. 25. On Dec. 1, Melania Trump will also reveal this year's White House Christmas decorations, and tours will reopen on Dec. 2 after being paused for the new ballroom construction.\nThis is the Trumps' first holiday season back since the president's return to office. Could it be a chance for a rare sighting of the first son?\nMore: What did Barron Trump tell Biden at the inauguration? Eric Trump reveals moment\nWatch the arrival of the White House Christmas Tree\nThe delivery of the tree is scheduled for noon ET Monday, Nov. 24. Watch live:\nBarron Trump joined Melania Trump in first White House Christmas Tree welcome\nWhen the first lady first welcomed the official White House Christmas tree in 2017, she had an 11-year-old Barron Trump at her side. He was already close to her height, even as the 5-foot-11-inch former model inspected the incoming tree in heeled boots. In 2018, he did not return to the ceremony and the first lady's office said he was still in school.\nThe first lady's office did not immediately respond to an inquiry about Barron's whereabouts for this year's ceremony.\nWhere is Barron Trump now?\nBarron Trump is the youngest of President Donald Trump's children and the only child of the president and first lady Melania Trump.\nThe 19-year-old sticks out at approximately 6-foot-7 whenever he does appear at his father's side, but he usually stays out of the public eye. His last public appearance was at the Inauguration in January. His father has still given him credit for helping reach young voters through social media platforms and influencers like streamer Adin Ross.\nBarron Trump completed his freshman year at New York University's Stern School of Business this past spring. Reports indicate he did not go back to New York this fall and instead enrolled in a different NYU campus.\nMelania Trump reportedly complained about Christmas duties in a secret recording\nChristmas at the White House brought controversy to the first lady in President Donald Trump's first term.\nFirst, there were the red Christmas trees in 2018.\nMore in Politics\nThen, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, author of the book \"Melania and Me,\" secretly recorded conversations with Melania Trump complaining about her role promoting the White House at Christmas while being criticized for not doing more meaningful work, CNN reported in 2020.\n\"I'm working my (expletive) off with the Christmas stuff that, you know, who gives a (expletive) about Christmas stuff and decorations but I need to do it, right?\" the first lady said in the recording. \"And then I do it, and I say I'm working on Christmas and planning for Christmas ... And they say, 'What about the children that are separated?' Give me a f---ing break.\"\nWolkoff and the first lady were friends. Trump's first-term Justice Department sued Wolkoff over the tell-all memoir, but the lawsuit was dropped in 2021. In response to the recordings, the first lady's office said there was no way to know if the recordings were edited and accused Wolkoff of recording to \"peddle herself and her salacious book.\"\nContributing: Maria Puente, Bryan Alexander, Barbara VanDenburgh, USA TODAY\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.
