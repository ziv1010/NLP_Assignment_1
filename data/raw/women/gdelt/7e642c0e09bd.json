One of those things that only comes around very rarely and we're very lucky that Football Mid North Coast put our club through to have that opportunity,\" he said.\nGrassroots fortball is where the foundation starts\n- Barracudas U/8 coach, Toby Gollan\nYou go, girl!\nThe participation of women and girls in football is currently in a phase of rapid expansion, with the growth of the sport's popularity among females unsurprisingly attributed to the success of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup and the success of the Australian team at that event.\nFootball Australia's 2024 National Participation Report confirms football's position as Australia's most popular and fastest-growing sport, with over 1.9 million participants nationwide - an 11 per cent increase compared to 2023.\nOf particular note, women and girls' participation registered an increase of 16 per cent to 221,436 participants.\nWith the Matildas emerging from relative obscurity in previous decades to become one of the most iconic sporting brands in the country, it is little wonder that girls are taking up the sport in greater numbers than ever.\nAs more girls become interested in the sport, clubs like Hallidays Point Sports Club are doing their bit to create an environment encouraging female participation.\n\"The growth in women in football to the Matildas and their success...the development in grassroots women and girls playing in football is huge as a result of that,\" Mr Gollan said.\n\"I know my daughter changed from playing netball to football because we took her down to a couple of World Cup matches - she was just awestruck by the size of the crowd and the excitement.\n\"There's an aim to foster a better environment for women in sport and promote teams of women's football and encourage more gala days, training and activities, and that sort of stuff as well.\"",
