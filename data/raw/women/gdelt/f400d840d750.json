  "body_text": "KWPL: Police Bullets, Vihiga Queens set the pace after first round of matches\nAudio By Vocalize\nVihiga Queens head coach Boniface Nyamunyamuh believes his\nside is on the right track to restore their lost glory in the Football Kenya\nFederation Women Premier League (FKF-WPL) by winning the title this season.\nThe Vihiga-based club registered their seventh win of the\ncampaign after thrashing Kisumu All Starlets 4–1 on Sunday, January 11, at Moi\nStadium, Kisumu.\nGoals from Martha Amunyolete, Georgina Nanjala, Irene\nMadalina, and Ugandan forward Anita Namata sealed the emphatic victory.\nThe result leaves the four-time champions second on the\nstandings with 24 points, just one point behind leaders Kenya Police Bullets.\nUlinzi Starlets, Trinity Starlets, and Zetech Sparks\ncomplete the top five with 23, 23, and 18 points respectively.\n\"I'm very happy for the win. We dominated the match\nfrom the first whistle to the end and that's what gave us the maximum points,”\nsaid Nyamunyamuh.\n“Kisumu was a tough side to us, whenever we meet them they\nalways give us hard time on the pitch but this time round the work was easy.”\nNyamunyamuh reiterated that reclaiming the league title\nremains the club’s primary objective.\n“Our aim, as I have said before, is to win the title and\nrestore the lost glory and I'm sure we will achieve it. The only thing we need\nto focus on is winning all our matches. The league as you can see is currently\nvery tight. The gap between us and our competitors Police, Ulinzi and Trinity\nis very little and it means we need to keep winning to broaden the gap,” he\nadded.\nThe weekend fixtures marked the end of the first round of\nthe season and officially opened the January mid-season transfer window, with\nNyamunyamuh planning to reinforce his attacking options.\n\"In this mid-season transfer window, we are targeting\nat least three forwards. Striking has been our major problem because Irene\nMadina is the only striker we have. That has forced us to push midfielders\nAnita Namata and Martha Karani to assist her but they aren't performing because\nit's not their natural positions,” he explained.\nIn other matches played on Sunday, Kenya Police Bullets\ndefeated Madira Soccer Assassins 2–0 at Nyang’ori Grounds in Majengo, Kisumu,\nwhile Trinity Starlets thrashed debutants Gideon Starlets 3–0 at Comboni\nPolytechnic Grounds. Ulinzi Starlets edged Bungoma Queens 2–1 at Bungoma\nNational Polytechnic.\nOn Saturday, Zetech Sparks beat Kayole Starlets 2–0, while Kibera Soccer Ladies handed Kisped Queens a 2–0 defeat.",
