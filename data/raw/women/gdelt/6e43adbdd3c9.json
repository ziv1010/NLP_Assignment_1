  "body_text": "The project had to start somewhere for Mauricio Pochettino.\nWhat the Argentinian hopes to achieve with the United States men’s national team is no small task. In a way, he is winding back the clock to before his brief stays at Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea — and even beyond his Tottenham Hotspur side that was teeming with promise when he arrived in 2014.\nAdvertisement\nToday’s USMNT appears more reminiscent of his first posts. With Espanyol and Southampton, Pochettino was tasked with creating a side that could outperform teams with a higher level of talent.\nThose jobs, and the glitzier ones that followed, left more variables for him to account for and solve. He and his staff controlled the squad’s training habits. If he needed a player to refine their specific roles, he worked on it every day. If that proved an ask too far, the transfer market could provide.\nSuccess can take the enjoyment out of that routine. With PSG and Chelsea, Pochettino was officially in his ‘esteemed manager’ era, residing in a realm occupied by coaches like Thomas Tuchel and Jose Mourinho. Men with their reputations are rarely entrusted to lead projects, to see out a long-term vision with the benefit of patient owners. They are hired as the final piece to turn lavish expenditure into hardware. If they can’t, the owner will find someone else.\nPochettino’s new gig is readying the USMNT for the 2026 World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. There is no transfer market to offer the international starting-caliber center-back this program desperately needs. The right-back problem can’t be solved with months of daily training for a possible stopgap. He can’t ensure goalkeeper Matt Turner starts every week for Crystal Palace.\nThroughout his first international window, that reality seemed to be what Pochettino craved.\n“People sometimes say, ‘That’s my philosophy, and I’m going to die with my idea,’” Pochettino told the media before his first game against Panama. “No, I want to live. Because life is amazing. I want to be clever, and I want to win. I don’t want to die.”\nHow’s that for a marketing slogan? The USMNT: for those who don’t want to die.\nIt could be the mentality that this program needs to save face. After winning hearts and minds in 2022, the past two years have seen the USMNT fail to take the next step. There was the public spat between the Reyna family and Gregg Berhalter that immediately extinguished the good vibes from the World Cup in Qatar and called into question the once-harmonious nature of Berhalter’s locker room.\nAdvertisement\nFor over half a year, the program was under interim management before deciding to retain Berhalter — a calamitous waste of a crucial year before the Copa América.\nWhile Tim Weah did Berhalter no favors with an early and unconscionable red card against Panama, the defeat and ensuing failure to advance from their group laid bare just how bleak the team had become. A far cry from the expectations of a group of players fabled as a possible golden generation. To be this uninspiring at a time when they had a bona fide attacking superstar in Christian Pulisic was impossible to accept.\nFourteen months after signing Berhalter to a new pact, U.S. Soccer made an ambitious pivot. It pushed hard to secure Pochettino — a coach with a pedigree the U.S. had not had before.\nAs several key players saw the summer window close without improving their club situations, the only way for the USMNT to get better was from the top.\nIt may have required a career pivot, but Pochettino is back to managing a project. He will have nearly two years to come up with the right combination of players to challenge at a World Cup on home soil.\nWhat transpires in the summer of 2026 will be how his success in the role will be determined. Not friendly results, nor continental showings at the Gold Cup and CONCACAF Nations League. Berhalter had no issue winning those competitions, and it isn’t the point of hiring Pochettino.\nThere’s a crucial difference between Pochettino’s job and that of Tuchel, who was hired by England for similar reasons that brought him to PSG, Chelsea (do you see a pattern here?) and Bayern Munich: to take a talented squad and make the final push to win the highest prizes.\nTuchel will have the benefit of World Cup qualifying — that is, games with tangible stakes — to chop and change. And then, almost certainly, he’ll find a new employer in July 2026.\nAdvertisement\nFor Pochettino, those ramp-up games aren’t on the calendar. Qualification is secure as tournament co-hosts. The USMNT knows it will benefit from a more favorable draw for the competition as a result, being the Pot 1 team. Every decision between now and then comes with hopes of making that status appear deserved.\nAt worst, they will be grouped in friendly territory like Qatar and South Africa before them. The best-case scenario is to pull off what Russia managed in 2018, a tournament that the USMNT missed.\nIt’s uncomfortable to draw parallels between Russia and the U.S. in most contexts, but the lead-up to the 2018 World Cup provides a rare opportunity. In the 2016 Euros, Russia finished last in their group. They swiftly made a coaching change, replacing Leonid Slutsky with Stanislav Cherchesov, and players responded. A rough year followed in 2017, beating only Hungary and New Zealand, but it set them up for a surprising success.\nThis century, no nation (save, perhaps, Australia at the 2023 Women’s World Cup) has benefited more from hosting FIFA’s grandest tournament. Cherchesov’s side enjoyed a kind draw, finishing second behind Uruguay and ahead of Saudi Arabia and Egypt. From there, the home advantage came through as they upset Spain in the round of 16 before falling to Croatia in another shootout.\nRussia is a unique program for many reasons, but the moral of their hosting cycle remains. To have the best chance of success at a home World Cup, it’s imperative to have support on your side.\nThe Copa América should have been the first step toward building that, but the USMNT’s performance achieved anything but. Pochettino doesn’t seem concerned that his team will play friendlies against lower-caliber opponents.\n“We are our worst enemy,” Pochettino said. “We need to challenge ourselves to be better and better and better.”\nAdvertisement\nLike Bora Milutinovic when the U.S. hosted in 1994, he will hope to get the USMNT ready to inspire another generation of fans. Players should take motivation from how many members of that squad have enjoyed status and careers in various arenas on the back of their star-making turns three decades ago.\nThis is a perfect case study to examine whether coaches matter at the game’s highest levels. It’s a final and expensive push to get a group of players with years of hype to realize their potential. If they can’t under a world-class manager in a tournament at home, it will forever be stamped onto their legacies. At least we’ll know definitively how golden their sheen truly is.\nThere will be highs and lows. A 2-0 win over Panama months after they were shocked at the Copa América was followed by a dreadful showing in the 2-0 defeat to Mexico. Frankly, these results don’t matter in isolation. What will matter is getting Ricardo Pepi back among the goals, seeing Yunus Musah become the midfield’s centerpiece, and hoping relative newcomers like Aidan Morris, Auston Trusty and Patrick Schulte can turn this first Pochettino camp into sustained and impactful international careers.\nPochettino wants to live, because life is amazing. Perhaps the lower stakes from now until 2026 will provide opportunities for the fanbase to feel similarly upbeat about their national team.\n(Top photo: ULISES RUIZ/AFP via Getty Images)",
