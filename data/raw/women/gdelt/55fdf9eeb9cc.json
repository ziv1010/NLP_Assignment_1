  "body_text": "31 rainy day out ideas with the kids in and around Manchester\nThe bad weather doesn't have to spoil the fun\nWe all know Manchester gets more than its fair share of rain, but the wet weather doesn't stop play.\nThere are loads of places that make for a great family day out across the region - and they don't all have to cost a fortune.\nWith the cold and wet months ahead of us, we've been putting together a list of places to go where families can have some fun and stay dry.\nTo make sure you're always up-to-date with events, you can sign up to our Manchester Family newsletter or join our FREE Manchester Family WhatsApp group by clicking here.\nHere's our full round-up of rainy day events and things to do in and around Greater Manchester...\nAdventures in Wonderland, Z-arts\nFamilies can tumble down the Rabbit Hole to experience their own magical Adventures in Wonderland at Z-arts.\nCreated in partnership with Macmillan Children’s Books and running until December 2025, the immersive play experience celebrates the 160th anniversary of one of the most loved children’s books of all time, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.\nStepping into the shoes of Alice, children will find things in Wonderland become 'curiouser and curiouser'. Greeting you as your storyteller is the White Rabbit, and from the shape shifting Cheshire Cat to a game of croquet with flamingos, there are scenes that will be familiar, including the chance to take your place at the Mad Hatter’s tea party.\nTunnels to crawl through, mazes to get lost in, fairground mirrors to amuse and a ball pool to 'splash' into, plus interactive games and sensory areas, all 'bring Lewis Carroll’s fantastical world to life'.\nThe Z-arts’ café, Butties and Books, also serves up tea party themed food and of course jam tarts.\nTickets cost £12 (plus 60p booking fee), with a family ticket for four priced at £40 (plus £2.40 booking fee). Book on the website here.\nInflata Nation\nIf you're looking for somewhere the kids can burn off some steam, then Inflata Nation is a great option.\nLast year the indoor inflatable park underwent a makeover to add brand new features and a huge new ball pit with more than 400,000 balls.\nAs well as the supersize ball pit, it features other new attractions including new spiralling slides, climbing walls, games and obstacle courses. The dedicated under fours area also had a refurb for younger children to enjoy.\nTickets cost £13.99 for anyone four and above and £6.99 for under fours. You can add an extra hour for £8.50 and £3.50 respectively. Book on the website here.\nGMP Museum\nGreater Manchester Police Museum has been recognised twice by Visit England as being a 'hidden gem'.\nFounded in 1981, the GMP Police Museum is itself located in a former police station and hosts regular open days during school holidays on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\nIt collects and preserves relevant archive material and acts as an important resource for community engagement.\nOpen days run from 10.30am to 3.30pm and focus on different units within the police force from the North West Underwater Search and Recovery Unit to the Tactical Dog Unit and the North West Ambulance Service.

It will also reveal how this three-horned giant lived, what it ate and how it survived battles with predators like the mighty T-Rex.\nFree to enter, Triceratops: Eat, Roam, Repeat will opens on Saturday, October 25 and will run until February 2026.\nOf course visitors will also delight at seeing Stan the T-Rex, the museum's resident dinosaur, and checking out the Vivarium, a collection of live amphibians and reptiles, including many critically endangered species. The museum is completely free to visit and there’s a cafe too.\nChaos Karts\nThe UK's first live action video game karting experience is right here in Manchester, inside the Arcade Arena next to the Science and Industry Museum.\nChaos Karts combines real-life racing with augmented reality and makes it feel as if you're inside a game of Mario Kart.\nEach player has their own kart and, just like Mario, you get to pick your own avatar and even the colour of your vehicle. The players are real, the karts are real and the racing experience is real - you whizz around an actual track. But the track changes each time, as it's projected onto the floor along with the rest of the landscape that surrounds you.\nYou use the buttons on your dashboard to fire forwards or backwards, dodging virtual obstacles like splattered eggs as you go.\nDrivers have to be a minimum age of 11 and be at least 5ft tall (1.5m) to take part. Chaos Karts tickets cost £26.50 and can be booked online on the website. Guests who aren't playing can book a free companion ticket online.\nPac-Man Live Experience\nAlso inside the Arcade Arena is the new Pac-Man Live Experience, which opened at the site earlier this year using the entire floor space that hosts those Mario tracks.\nThis interactive, immersive experience lets you take on the identity of Pac-Man himself and again drops you into a real-life video game where you are chased by ghosts.\nYou have your very own 'Pac Master' to oversee proceedings and tell you what game is coming next - reminding those whose vest becomes a ghost to take a breather as players take it in turns to take short breaks from the action.\nTwo separate teams of eight play separately on either side of the room and the goal is to beat your opponents by running around and collecting power pellets and fruit while desperately trying to avoid those pesky ghosts, Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde.\nPac-Man Live is suitable for anyone aged eight and above. It is a physical experience so you are on your feet for the duration.\nTickets start from £22 each, with a discount applied for family bookings. Tickets can be booked here.\nTotal Ninja, Trafford Park\nAnother place the kids can burn off some energy is at Total Ninja which offers activities for all ages.\nThe park tests your Ninja skills while climbing, balancing and swinging across obstacles or bouncing across their inflatable – plus find out if you have what it takes to beat the wall.\nNinjas can 'find their inner calm' on Balance Logs, or sail through the Sea of Swings with more than 25 challenges to suit all ages and abilities.\nThere's a cafe for parents who'd rather keep watch.

Brains, Bogies and You, which is running until January 4, 2026.\nA second collaboration with the hit BBC show, it features the show's presenters Dr Xand and Dr Ronx as virtual guides for visitors, who get to become tiny brain explorers - setting out to investigate Dr Chris’ senses before being sneezed out of his giant nose.\nFrom poking around inside a giant eyeball and journeying through an ear canal covered in gooey wax, to being sneezed out through sticky snot, there's nothing kids won't love about the new exhibition.\nMini medics are invited to explore their own brilliant brains by banging on an eardrum, venturing into a massive eyeball and even taking a whiff of a 'smell library' during what promises to be 'a lively, interactive and playful adventure'.\nTickets are priced at £10, with children three and under going free. To find out more and book your tickets, visit the website here.\nVisitors can also explore five decades of play with a ticket to the popular Power Up 'ultimate gaming experience', where they can discover how far computer games have come.

Visit the website for more details.\nOxygen Activeplay, MediaCity\nA massive new trampoline play park Oxygen Activeplay opened in February and has proved a big hit with families.\nTaking over the former I'm a Celebrity Jungle Challenge site inside Quayside, formerly Lowry Outlet, at Salford Quays, the state-of-the-art venue features 24 trampolines, a mega-air bag jump, a high ropes course, a Sky Rider aerial ride, an interactive strike arena and more.\nThere’s even a dedicated Toddler Zone, so little jumpers can have just as much fun on their own trampettes. High above the park, the high ropes course will have fearless families navigating their way across six challenging crossings, while the Sky Rider will 'give thrill seekers a sky-high feeling, as they soar through the air on a harness'.\nTickets cost £14.50 for an hour's Open Play session, or £45 for a family of four.

Open Play is for ages four and above and children must be 135cm tall to use the high ropes.\nSee the website to book.\nMuseum of Illusions\nThe Museum of Illusions opened in Manchester city centre a year ago and is the first in the UK.\nBilled as 'one of the world's most Instagrammable museums', exhibits range from holograms and optical tricks to full-scale illusion rooms and playful mirror displays.\nThere are more than 50 exhibits in all, ranging from simple wall-mounted optical illusions to immersive experiences that challenge both mind and body.\nThere's the world’s first ever optical illusion centred around a tram inspired by the city's Metrolink, where guests appear to be hanging upside down on-board the specially made carriage; the Vortex Tunnel, a mind-spinning illusion that makes you feel like you're actually going upside down; and the Infinity Room, which multiplies your group as far as the eye can see.\nYou can take as long as you like inside the science-meets-entertainment attraction, but it typically lasts around an hour. Tickets, costing from £19.50, can be booked on the website here.\nArcade Club Bury\nIf you've got a little gamer in the family then they'll love to visit the Arcade Club in Bury.\nThe Ela Mill venue features hundreds of retro and modern machines over four floors and gamers have been flocking there since it opened in 2015.\nThere's everything from Pac-Man and Space Invaders to Donkey Kong and Sega Rally and kids can play their modern favourites like Fortnite and Rocket League.\nThe £10 entry fee is for kids aged five to 15 to play all day long.
