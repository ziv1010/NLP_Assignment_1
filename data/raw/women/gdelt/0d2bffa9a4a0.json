He made his debut in December of that year after veteran QB Carson Wentz’s performance began to deteriorate. Hurts came from a hugely successful college football career, throwing for a monstrous 2,780 yards and 23 touchdowns in his freshman year at Alabama Crimson Tide.\nRelated: Jalen Hurts’ Diet Lets Him Deadlift Twice His Body Weight—Here Are the Foods the QB Eats & Avoids\nAs a second-year starter in the NFL, the fact that Hurts has delivered MVP-level performances is noteworthy. Upon securing his team’s place in Super Bowl LVII on January 29, 2023, by taking out the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship, he said: “I don’t really know how to feel, to be honest. You work really hard to put yourself in this position and I’m forever grateful. Only God knows the things that each individual on this team has been able to overcome for us to come together as a team and do something special as a group. That’s what means the most. I always want to go out there and give my best regardless of what’s going on because I don’t want to let down the guy next to me. That makes us all go harder.”\nJalen Hurts’ net worth is around $30 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Hurts made his NFL debut in 2020 and took the Eagles to the Super Bowl just two years later. It’s a momentous achievement for an athlete who felt in the beginning that people “probably didn’t even want” him to be drafted, per a post-game press conference.\nGoing into Super Bowl LVII, Hurts has one year left on his rookie deal—which he signed in 2020 for $6 million over four years with a $1.9 million signing bonus and $2.8 million in guaranteed money. In the 2022/23 season, Hurts led the Eagles to a 14-1 record, throwing for 3,701 yards and 22 touchdowns, the fourth-best in the NFL.\nHurts is entering his contract year in 2023 and is scheduled to make $4.304 million on a $4,789,486 salary cap number. Joel Correy, a sports agent who writes for CBS, speculated executive vice president/general manager Howie Roseman “shouldn’t have any issue, at a minimum, treating Hurts like he did Carson Wentz, his predecessor. Wentz signed a four-year, $128 million contract extension in June 2019 after his third NFL season containing a then NFL record $107,870,683 of guarantees with $66 million fully guaranteed at signing. The deal was worth up to $144 million through salary escalators. As 2016’s second overall pick, Wentz had two years remaining on his rookie contract because of a fifth-year option in 2020.” At one point, Wenz was the NFL’s fourth-highest-paid player, earning $32 million per year with his extension.\nHurts’ Eagles teammates could not be more supportive of allowing him to continue his incredible record, but they have one request: “All I know is, and this is a fact: He’s about to get paid!” left tackle Jordan Mailata told ESPN in January 2023 after the Eagles nabbed the NFC Championship against the San Francisco 49ers. “Oh, my god. Pay the man! Second year as a full-year starter, and he’s taking us to the Super Bowl? Set I don’t know how many records. All I know is, that man is one of the hardest workers I’ve ever seen in my life.”\nHurts is hardworking personally, but he also surrounds himself with equally ambitious people. His management team, all women, is a sign of his dedication to improving the game for everyone. He brought on his agent Nicole Lynn when he was drafted in 2020 and on February 12, 2023, she’ll be the first Black woman agent to represent a player at the Super Bowl. “I know the agent world in the NFL, and all sports, is very male-dominated,” he told Sports Illustrated in August 2022. “But Nicole was really on top of her stuff. She was prepared. She knew what she was talking about. She was hungry. And she was determined. And I feel that determination like that never rests. Once you come across such a determined individual, that just hits me a little different.”\nHe continued: “I admire anyone who puts their head down and works for what they want. And I know women who do that daily, but they don’t get the same praise as men—they don’t get the praise that they deserve. I’ve seen that now with tons of different women in my life that are hustlers. Athletes, coaches, women in the business world of sports. I see it all the time. And they deserve their flowers too. So, if me saying something about it brings more attention to it, then I’m all for that.”\nAccording to Zippia, men make up 77 percent of sports agents and the most common ethnicity among sports agents is white (61.5 percent). Women make up just 23 percent of NFL agents, and of that, only 10.4 percent are Black (men or women). “I have a team of straight hustlers,” Hurts continued to SI. “They get things done. And that’s how I am on the field and off the field. We’re all trying to accomplish something.”\nFor more about the Super Bowl, football fans can check out When It Was Just a Game: Remembering the First Super Bowl by Harvey Frommer. The best-selling book delves into the history of the first Super Bowl, which was originally known as the AFL-NFL Championship Game. (The term “Super Bowl” was coined only in its third year.) The debut game, between the winning Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs, was played in front of only 61,946 people at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum—an audience well below the stadium’s capacity. Harvey Frommer, a sports historian and reporter, puts the tale of that momentous game together using oral history, gathered from hundreds of interviews with players, coaches, media and spectators alike.\nOur mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
