The Sarsfields clung on well however and were in no mood to give up or relinquish their lead and continued to chip away with the odd score to keep the Mitchels at bay for the majority of the second half.\nCastlebar were turning the screw however with a couple of black cards not helping the Sarsfields cause as their goal was finally breached which hauled the Mitchels level with momentum firmly on their side. They looked odds on to close out the match but the Sarsfields were giving none of it as they dug in and forced one final play with youngster Ava Casey belying her tender years as she displayed admirable composure to kick the winning score and keep the Sarsfields hopes alive of qualifying for the quarter-finals. The kick was as measured as it was good with the final whistle sounding immediately afterwards to scenes of great delight in the Sarsfields camp as they stayed in the championship and upset the formbook in some respects in the process.\nThe Sarsfields won on merit it must be said as they took the game to the hosts with some clever, incisive football and left them with a do or die contest with reigning count champions to see who can progress to the latter stages of the competition proper.\nThis was a display full of grit and determination as the girls invested everything in it from the get-go. Manager Sinead Halligan was beaming with pride afterwards with everything on the line in their final game of the group against reigning Westport in a game the Sarsfields will go into as big underdogs.\nThere was no winner of the Charlestown Sarsfields GAA lotto jackpot of €18,400 in the weekly draw held on Sunday, September 7, and the following were the four numbers drawn; 3, 21, 23 and 31.The winners of the €50 weekly prizes were Ann-Marie Honeyman and Jim Halligan, Longford (annual ticket).

The game had a winner take all feel about it with the winners securing their senior status for 2026 while the losers would go into the dreaded relegation play-offs which brings another layer of pressure altogether.\nBoth teams came into the game on the back of two losses so it was very much a 50/50 encounter with some so many interesting sub-plots. The weather turned rogue on the night with a strong wind very much in play with sweeping rain adding another degree of difficulty for both sets of players who were keenly aware of what was at stake ahead of the 8pm throw-in.\nClaremorris struck first with a sizzling two pointer from Conor McGuinness but the Sarsfields found their feet and hit back with two good points from play with Mattie Lenehan and Niall Murphy firing over two excellent points.\nThe next ten minutes saw a real scrap for control with Claremorris taking the initial lead as they kicked 4 points in a row, including a two pointer to move 0-6 to 0-2 clear as the swirling wind continued to play havoc with all attempts connected to the foot be it shooting or passing.\nThe Sarsfields fronted up however and came up with the ideal response as they kicked the next three points to reel in the South Mayo men and bring the green and white firmly back into contention. Matt Lenehan and Jack Mahon kicked two quality scores with Paul Towey getting his eye in with a straight forward free in front of goal.\nThe game changed course minutes later however, when Claremorris put together a fine flowing move with Darragh Beirne the last man on the end of the pass as he curled a delightful shot to the roof of the net to put Claremorris in the ascendency once again. Gareth O’Donnell replied with a point for the Sarsfields with a super effort from play but Claremorris struck again from the very next play as some lax marking from the Sarsfields saw Matthew Macken steal his way forward as he surged into acres of green grass with his fisted pass across the front of the Sarsfields goals palmed to the net by Cathal Joyce to put the real daylight between the sides for the first time as the blues galloped into a 2-6 to 0-6 lead.\nThe Sarsfields needed a response and it came in timely fashion as Paul Towey stepped up to kick a sizzling two pointer from distance to send the Sarsfields to the shed in better spirits as they trailed 2-6 to 0-8.\nThe Sarsfields needed a fast start to the second half, and it duly arrived with Jack Mahon, re-located at wing back, curling over a delightful effort to inject momentum into the green and white effort. Mattie Lenehan followed up moments later with his third from a play, a sweetly struck shot that soared over the bar from just inside the arc. Paul Towey kicked a glorious two pointed effort six minutes in to tie the game and bring a real sense of drama and excitement to the contest as the exchanges ratcheted up several notches.\nClaremorris finally broke their second half scoring duck with a Darragh Beirne free and they added to it from the very next play with a good point from play. The lead was pushed out to three with a Darragh Joyce point from play as Claremorris made their push for victory but the Sarsfields never went away as Towey narrowed the gap to one with another booming two point effort from distance. The battle for supremacy became frantic as balls were spilled or lost in contact with the Sarsfields having cause to rue some missed chances and poor decision making in front of goals as they left several point chances behind them when the need was greatest.\nClaremorris, too were equally as culpable, but they did manage to hold their nerve as they kicked a superb two-pointed score six minutes from time to widen the gap to three once again. Towey kept the scoreboard ticking for Charlestown with a point from play but the goal they so craved never arrived as the South Mayo men managed to prevent their goal from being breached which proved absolutely critical to the final outcome.\nAnother Towey point kept the Sarsfields hanging on grimly to the Claremorris coattails but a sublime two pointed effort from Niall Hurley gave the blues the vital space they needed to keep the gap wide enough to force the Sarsfields to go for broke. True to form the Sarsfields went at it but they lacked composure and coolness at the critical moments as balls drifted wide or shots were rushed and with that their hopes of victory were extinguished as Claremorris did enough to seal the win and end a long losing streak at the hands of the Sarsfields going back any number of years in the process.\nIt was a dour, tense and edgy game littered with mistakes on both sides with the need for victory very much the dominating factor at play. The Sarsfields contended at all times and will be disappointed at their shot conversion rate with Claremorrs, too, having much to mull over in this regard.\nIn the final analysis the goals proved the single biggest difference between the sides on a tough night for football with the Sarsfields having to steel themselves for a relegation play-off which will prove a real test of their mettle and endurance. They had good performances from Tadhg Horkan, Ben Conway, Niall Drudy and Jack Corley in defence as they played from the front at all times and defended with real courage and tenacity. Ruairi Cullen was a willing runner as ever and poured forward at every opportunity in both halves.\nThe middle third battleground was, as always, hotly contested but one would have to say Claremorris came out on top in this sector as they dominated the breaking ball area and gobbled up the second and third balls that dropped out of the sky notwithstanding Paddy Goldrick had some good moments and looked a real threat going forward on occasions.\nIn attack Paul Towey carried the scoring threat and weighed in with the hefty contribution of 0-9 of the Sarsfields final total of 0-16 and was a marked man throughout as Claremorris were keenly aware of the threat he posed. Jack Mahon and Matt Lenehan kicked five points between them and made some big plays and were dangerous and threatening on occasions albeit their influence waned as the game wore on. Gareth O’Donnell was a good outlet for possession from his wing forward station and probed and carried ball regularly and did his best to keep the Sarsfields moving towards the Claremorris goal. Ben Crean was also conspicuous throughout, linking the play well and running hard lines until his removal midway through the second half. Niall Fleming, Paddy Lenehan, Sean Dunleavy and Thomas Holton all had their occasional flashes and moments when they were threatening but the Sarsfields needed a goal to put the cat among the pigeons, and it never materialised hence Claremorris can be pleased with their defensive contribution throughout. Kenny Brennan was solid and competent between the posts for the Sarsfields and could in no way be faulted for either of the Claremorris goals.\nMayo Recovery College begin their autumn/winter suite of mental health and well-being modules on the following dates throughout September in the Atlantic Technological University in Castlebar (online options also).

This will be the first championship clash between the sides since 1999 when the Gaels toppled the Sarsfields with the Gaels also coming out on top in the intermediate championship semi-final of 1984 when they pipped the Sarsfields by a point in a replay. The Sarsfields did get a win on the board against the Gaels as they defeated the South Mayo side in the first round of the intermediate championship in 1997. Since then there’s been little or no history between the teams save for the odd league game which the Sarsfields have generally won so there will be plenty on the line when the two teams square off on Sunday next with the small matter of their senior championship status and securing the same very much to the forefront of both managements ahead of the throw-in.\nThe Sarsfields will be banking on the experience of Gareth O’Donnell, Paddy Lenehan, Paddy Goldrick, Kenny Brennan and the lads who have been on the premises a fair while to guide the younger players through what’s always a tense occasion. Both teams have some experience of this situation having survived their respective relegation semi-finals last years against Belmullet and Kilmeena respectively so they’ll have that to draw on at the very least.\nThe Gaels will be looking to the Gallagher brothers, Jack Fallon, Ruairi Keane, James Jennings and Ethan Henry to guide them over the line with the Sarsfields again leaning heavily on Paul Towey to come up with the goods in the scoring department with Matt Lenehan, Jack Mahon, Ben Crean et al hopefully providing him with plenty of support as the Sarsfields look to end the season on a positive note and bring plenty of the good points from their display against Claremorris and add a bit more consistency and precision in their shooting and decision making. Both teams will go at this hard as they will want to avoid the dreaded relegation final and put their feet up safe in the knowledge they’ll be playing senior championship in 2026.\nA 4 week flower arranging class with Angela Tansey will begin at Carracastle Community Centre on Wednesday, September 17, at 7.30pm.

Governor Gus had to be at his best to maintain law and order as tempers became frayed on several occasions. The Pillock blazed out of the blocks and blasted his way to a set lead with some imperious throwing and finishing. Podsie was unable to match the standard being set by his rampant opponent but never panicked and kept his emotions in check as the Pillock went on the rampage, whipping his supporters up into a frenzy in order to upset the champ.\nThe number one seed called on all his experience and class and reeled the challenger in with some special throwing. He thundered his way to victory as he won the next three sets in sensational fashion to leave his beleaguered opponent dumbfounded with a 170 finish in the fourth leg of set five almost bringing the house down as Podsie clinched the match in a manner befitting a champion. This was a vintage performance from the main man as he clinched his tenth title of the season and set off all manner of celebrations in the process as the crowd went absolutely ballistic. A great day for team Podsie and one which the Pillock will rue for many a long day.",
