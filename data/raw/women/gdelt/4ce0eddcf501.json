Ballaghaderreen's Aaron Dowd emerged as man of the match as he scored their four goals. His side were 2-1 up at half-time and they also missed a penalty before the break with Euan Kelly saving Danny Browne’s spot kick. Rian Carpenter scored for Moore United.\nCharles Nevin levelled the game early in the second half, but Dowd struck twice more within a few minutes. Just when it seemed the game would end 4-2 in favour of Ballaghaderreen, Moore scored first through Nevin and then Carpenter with both goals coming in added time.\nThere was also Connacht Cup and Shield action on Sunday and, overall, it was a day of mixed fortunes for the RDFL sides.\nIn an all RDFL clash, Premier Division side St John's Athletic beat Division 1 side Dunmore Town 6-2 at Lecarrow. The home side was flattered by the result as Dunmore were much better than the scoreline suggests. It was an entertaining game before a good crowd who had the benefit of a lovely clear sky.\nThe Dunmore keeper pulled off a good save early in the game, but it was the home side who broke the deadlock with eleven played thanks to a neat strike from Camin Boland. Fifteen minutes later, Dunmore were level following a good passing move and a neat finish from Ethan Coen.\nSt John's replied within a couple of minutes when Kevin Brennan's shot was tipped onto the post and Jamie Tiernan was on hand to score. Colin Comer levelled the game when he scored before half-time, but Jamie Tiernan had the home side 3-2 ahead at the break. Ronan Morris, Daire Keenan and Kevin Brennan added three more for the winners to make sure of a place in the quarter-finals.\nDivision 1 side Ballinasloe Town were beaten 4-1 at home by the Mayo Super League side Westport United. Castlerea Celtic and the Galway Premier side Renmore were level 1-1 at the end of extra-time but unfortunately for Castlerea, they lost 5-4 in the penalty shoot out. Chris Kelly scored for the home side.\nIn the Connacht Shield, Skyvalley Rovers had an impressive win away to the Mayo Super league side Glenhest Rovers. Mark Richardson scored for the Taughmaconnell side after five minutes and added his second 13 minutes later. Shortly afterwards the home side won a penalty kick but the Skyvalley keeper pulled off a great save. The Mayo side headed in a goal with 30 minutes played to leave the score 2-1 in favour of Skyvalley at half-time. Despite having a player sent off with 20 minutes remaining, Rovers defended very well and held on for a deserved win and a place in the quarter-finals.\nDivision 1 side Glen Celtic took on the Castlebar Celtic second side at Glenamaddy. The sides scored ten goals between them and then converted nine more from the penalty spot. Unfortunately for Glen Celtic they lost out 5-4 in a penalty shootout after the game finished 5-5 at the end of extra-time. Glen were 5-2 ahead at one stage but the visitors had a stronger panel of players and it paid off for them. Gavin Hegarty scored three and Michael Heneghan and Ethan O'Dowd scored one each for the Glenamaddy side.\nIn Division 1, Cloonfad United beat St Cuan's/Ahascragh United 5-1. The winners were 3-0 up at half-time and eased to a comfortable win over a young visiting side. Neil Morris scored two and Darragh Flynn and Conor Ruane one each with an own goal making up the Cloonfad total.\nIn Division 2, Kilkerrin United beat Roscommon United 2-1 at Roscommon. Oisin Hynes scored with nine minutes left to play following a good passing move, and Daniel Stephens added a second for the winners five minutes later. The Town side pulled a goal back near the end but just could not get an equaliser.\nCloonfad United beat Moore United 3-1 at Cloonfad in the only other game played. Marcus Denning scored his first senior goal for Cloonfad on 30 minutes and he made it 2-0 before half-time. Shane Kenny pulled one back for Moore with 64 played but Kealin Flynn made the win safe for Cloonfad when he scored their third following a brilliant pass by Liam Fleming.\nIn the Connacht Women’s Shield, Kilkerrin United beat Kilmore Ladies 2-0. Katie Connelly and Mairead McGann scored their goals. Ballinasloe Town were beaten 9-0 away to Westport United, and Ballaghaderreen were unlucky to lose 2-1 after extra-time at home to Manulla. Caoimhe Feeney scored for Ballaghaderreen.",
