  "body_text": "Hours before Tottenham Hotspur’s men’s team got drilled at the Emirates, Spurs Women punched their ticket to the quarterfinals of the Subway Women’s League Cup thanks to a 1-0 away win over Bristol City. Today, they found out their next opponent, and it’s a toughie. Spurs were drawn away at Manchester United, with the match scheduled to take place December 20 or 21.\nSpurs Women drawn away to United in League Cup quarterfinals\nA tough draw, but it could be worse.\nHere’s the full quarterfinal draw:\n- QF1 — Liverpool vs. Chelsea\n- QF2 — Crystal Palace vs. Arsenal\n- QF3 — Manchester United vs. Tottenham Hotspur\n- QF4 — West Ham United vs. Manchester City\nIn addition to the quarterfinals, the draw was also held for the semifinal matchups, which will take place January 21-22, 2026. The winner of QF1 will face the winner of QF4, while QF2 will host QF3. For Spurs Women, that means that if they should get past a tricky tie away at United, they’ll very likely face Arsenal away for a chance to play in the final.\nIn all honesty, there weren’t very many good pathways for Spurs in this draw. They basically had to hope they pulled an easy first round tie against either West Ham (managed by former Spurs head coach Rehanne Skinner) or Crystal Palace, who were relegated to WSL2 last season and are currently mid-table. Ironically, Arsenal is probably the best draw they could’ve had in the semifinals; Spurs played them pretty evenly in what ended up a scoreless draw on November 16.\nIt’s definitely not an impossible draw, but this is a tough one. Spurs’ next match is at home to Aston Villa in WSL league play on December 7.",
