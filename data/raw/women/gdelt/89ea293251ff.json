Additionally, these seven programs achieved a GSR score of 100 percent: Men's Cross Country, Men's Golf, Women's Golf, Rifle, Softball, Tennis and Volleyball.\n\"We are extremely proud of each of our more than 430 student-athletes and are grateful for the coaches and academic staff who are prioritizing success in the classroom,\" Director of Athletics Nico Yantko said. \"We continue to be intentional by investing in championship resources for each of our sport programs such as Alston Academic Incentive money so our teams can recruit top talent and maintain the academic success we have experienced. We are fortunate to have investors who believe in the holistic success and experience of our student-athletes, and we cannot thank them enough for believing in them and for believing in our overall vision for excellence.\"\nSince the Fall of 2022 and the inception of the Dennis Jackson Leadership Program, Murray State has excelled in the classroom, extending its streak of semesters with a 3.0 or better departmental GPA to 40 consecutive semesters. The Spring 2024 GPA of 3.34 marked the highest GPA in school history and was complimented by all Racer sport programs notching a 3.0 GPA or higher.\nGSR is a gauge of every team's graduation rate within a six-year period of a student-athlete's enrollment. The latest GSR figures examined the student-athlete cohort that originally enrolled in 2017 and would need to have graduated by August of 2023 to count as a graduate.\nThe GSR formula, intended to be a complete and accurate look at student-athlete success, removes from the rate student-athletes who leave school while academically eligible and includes student-athletes who transfer to a school after initially enrolling elsewhere. The GSR also allows for a deeper understanding of graduation success in individual sports than the federal metric, which has broader groupings.\n2023-24 Murray State Graduation Success Rate (by Sport)\nOverall Department GSR – 94 (School Record)\nSport/GSR\nBaseball – 90\nMen's Basketball – 91\nWomen's Basketball – 89\nMen's Cross Country – 100\nWomen's Cross Country/Track & Field – 92\nFootball – 90\nMen's Golf – 100\nWomen's Golf – 100\nRifle – 100\nWomen's Soccer – 96\nSoftball – 100\nWomen's Tennis - 100\nWomen's Volleyball - 100\nSix-year data for academic cohort that enrolled in 2017; through August of 2023\nFollow the Racers on X (@MSURacers), Instagram (@RacersAthletics) and Facebook to stay up-to-date on all that is happening with Murray State Athletics.\nThe Racers' overall score is the highest in the Missouri Valley Conference among the league's public schools and ranks fourth overall.
