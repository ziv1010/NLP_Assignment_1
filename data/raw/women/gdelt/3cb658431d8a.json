  "body_text": "Friday, 17th Jan 2014 12:00 by HarryFromBath\nHarryfromBath assesses the mood in the opposition camp ahead of Saturday's game by delving into their forums.\n\"The best managerial signing in my lifetime\", \"We now have a proper manager and I'll be behind him all the way, even if we don't have a great end to the season\", \"Ian Holloway is the best Christmas present I got this year\", \"I feel like I have got my Millwall back.\"\nLions are euphoric at the appointment of the former Blackpool and Palace manager, but are not blind to the scale of his challenge: \"I have never seen a team so lacking in fight, energy and sharpness for years\", \"People who think Holloway will hit the ground running may be in for a shock.\"\n\"With his West Ham connections, the Steve Lomas appointment alienated many. A number of players have come in on big money contracts. We are in big danger of going down. I'd say that was pretty disastrous\", \"This is going to be a long four months.\"\n\"After Southend, we couldn't have got any lower\", \"One of the most embarrassing performances in our history.\" A nadir was reached with a 4-1 FA Cup defeat two weeks ago at Southend, in which the lethargic and casual attitude of the players incurred the wrath of many fans.\nSouthend 4-1 Millwall (FAC3)\n\"You owe us a massive performance next week. We have had enough of your tantrums. If you don't like it, f*** off out of our club. No one is bigger than Millwall. It will be around longer than any of you lot.\"\n\"Overpaid, over-rated, piss-taking bastards\", \"Dross, total and utter dross\", \"Gutless, clueless disorganised piece of s***\", \"Another f***ing thrashing\", \"Mercenary, passionless wage thieves\", \"Getting bullied by a League Two side\", \"I wish I never went.\"\n\"That performance was an insult to every Millwall fan who took the time and trouble to go\", \"For those who think we won't go down, think again. There is something very, very wrong at this club and we are heading for relegation.\"\n\"Some of these ***** want to try living in the real world, where after Christmas you can't afford to put petrol in the car or go food shopping, and where, if you performed at work how they do, you would be in f***ing trouble.\"\nIan Holloway\n\"The best signing since George Graham\", \"It's a massive statement of intent from the board\", \"We've got the best possible manager given the s*** we're in. We really couldn't have got anyone better\", \"I haven't smiled so much since the wife threatened to leave me.\"\nHolloway's passion and honesty have struck a huge chord with supporters. \"He's a nutter for a club full of nutters\", \"The carrot crunching f***wit will show a lot more intent than Lomas\", \"He's your typical Millwall fella, albeit with a stupid accent.\"\n\"I'm not saying Holloway is going to s*** miracles, but any Millwall fan turning their nose up at him is stupid\", \"Holloway won't change us. If anything, we'll change him. It going to be fun watching him turn slowly into that fella from The Shining.\"\n\"He'll tell the players if they don't like it, they know where the door is\", \"We have the right mechanic on the shop floor\", \"Holloway's clever. Don't think he won't find the players out. He will see it as we do\", \"This week is going to be a defining one in the careers of a number of our players.\"\nAn Imbalanced Squad Lacking In Fitness and Confidence\n\"The squad is devoid of width and pace, is unbalanced and lacks leadership.\" Millwall used 23 different outfield players in a run of five losses and a draw prior to Ian Holloway's first game, last Saturday's defeat to a late goal at Huddersfield.\n\"At times we haven't had any wingers, play-makers, pace or a specialist left-back. We do have four right-backs and half a dozen holding midfielders\", \"Too much time was invested in getting players who were available, rather than targeting players who could improve us.\"\n\"The fitness coach has a lot to answer for given the state of some of the players performances\", \"There were huge spaces appearing towards the end of the Huddersfield game\", \"Lomas's six-meals-a-day training set-up\", \"Holloway's first job is extra training to get these f***ers fit.\"\n\"The players were not being managed, and has the confidence drained out of them by Lomas\", \"The whole squad is devoid of confidence. It's almost as if we need a shrink more than a manager to get the belief back in the players' minds\", \"No-one can lead a team that is playing with his head down.\"\nDefence\n\"We have conceded 2.2 goals a game, and we have the worst defence in the league\", \"It doesn't matter how we shuffle the pack at the back. We're not good enough\", \"It's blatantly obvious that our defence isn't good enough. We'll struggle to hold Ipswich at home next week.\"\n\"I can't believe that some of our defenders would go to absolute tosh over the space of a summer. Sorry, but I can't be having that\", \"Last year our defence seemed good but we couldn't score. This year we scored the odd goal but have let in a lot more.\"\nDavid Forde\nThere have been few complaints about 34-year-old Republic of Ireland keeper David Forde. \"Forde should be captain this season. His performances this season lead by example\", \"Top man\", \"He did alright in s*** conditions (at Southend) with a total shambles of a defence in front of him.\"\n\"Putting decent players around Alan Dunne is like putting lipstick on a pig\", \"His style of play is too reckless\", \"Dunne is frustrating. He does some decent things and them some ridiculous things. His concentration is poor.\"\n\"Dunne is 100% Millwall through and through\", \"Even if he isn't the best right-back in the world, he still puts his foot in\", \"He's done well in difficult circumstances this season.\" The 31-year-old club veteran \"runs around a lot, but gets caught out by speed.\"\n\"Hoyte is a waste of money\". Lions are bemused by the recent acquisition of 29-year old ex-Gunner Justin Hoyte. \"From what I've seen of Hoyte, he doesn't look any better than what we've already got\", \"He shouldn't start ahead of Dunne.\"\n\"Jack Smith at left-back means no width again.\" The 30-year-old former Swindon man \"looks all over the place at left-back. It's embarrassing to watch him try and pass a ball with his left foot\", \"Smith cannot be trusted at this level, and has been struggling for the last couple of years.\"\nSmith was at fault for Huddersfield's late goal. \"He had an awful game. He was continually out of position and was beaten loads of times. It was no surprise he cost us the goal.\" Most Lions would prefer to see 22-year-old ex-Bournemouth man Scott Malone start at left-back.\n\"If Shane Lowry gets his head out of his arse, he can still become the decent player he threatened to be.\" The 24-year-old former Villa defender \"is no longer a centre-half. He doesn't seem to read anything\", \"Lowry has the technique to score freekicks and can pass a ball, but his form is woeful.\"\n\"Lowry got totally clattered by a Southend player in front of us and went flying off the pitch. He got up and jogged away — no fight or anger, nothing\", \"He was cruelly exposed by Southend's forwards.\"\n\"I'm not sure when Mark Beevers had the operation to remove his right foot and replace it with a shovel\", \"The centre backs are lacking in confidence and Beevers looks terrified\", \"He has lost form and confidence due to the rest of the useless f***ers around him at the back.\"\nThe 24-year old former Owl \"is a quality centre-half playing in the leakiest defence in the league\", \"I rate Beevers and think he has a lot to offer\", \"Beevers carries the ball into midfield on occasion and should be encouraged to do it more often.\"\n\"Seeing Robbo's current form saddens me\", \"I think Paul Robinson's time is up\", \"Robbo has been finished at this level since his injury.\" The 32-year-old Lions veteran \"has been awful this season\", \"It has everything to do with injuries and a deterioration of a once excellent player for us.\"\nDanny Shittu\n\"Shittu is bad. Out of position and gave up running for three of their (Southend's) goals. [He] should never play for us again\", \"I seen some of them women in the church behind the Den in better nick than him and they're all massive.\"\n\"The fitness coach came in and put two stone on Shittu\", \"It looks like he got his two-year contract and then had a pre-season jolly-up\", \"His general play is too slow and is regularly beaten in the air.\"\n\"He's always out of position, turns like the Titanic, couldn't mark a piece of paper if he tried and just toe-punts it whenever he gets it to feet.\"\nThe 33-year-old former QPR man had a notably poor game against Southend, but rediscovered his form against the Terriers. \"Against Huddersfield, Shittu was back to his old self. He made good decisive clearances and was dominant in the air as well.\"\nCentral Midfield\n\"It's the midfield that is clueless. Teams just walk through us\", \"Until we get a bit of pace and power in midfield, teams are going to dominate us\", \"We lose the ball a ridiculous number of times when we start with comfortable possession.\"\n\"When we are pressed, we are panicky. The movement in midfield isn't good enough to help defenders do anything other than hoof it\", \"Trotter isn't mobile, and Abdou and Bailey aren't good enough on the ball, meaning we constantly lose the midfield battle\",\nJimmy Abdou and Dexter Blackstock\n\"Jimmy Abdou is a decent tackler, messer and defender. He's not a world beater, but his job is to disrupt. His technical issues would not be a problem in a more creative midfield\", \"My all-time favourite Millwall player\", \"He is everywhere at once.\"\n\"Jimmy would run through walls for this club.\" The 29-year-old ex-Plymouth player \"runs around and never tries to hide. At times (against Southend) it looked like a training session with him in the middle having to win the ball from ten others.\"\n\"I can't make my mind up on Chaplow. I don't know where he's supposed to play or what he does\", \"He's an enigma. He's not a proper wide player, but certainly isn't a central one\", \"His final ball and decision-making where it matters are poor.\"\n\"We need an attacking midfielder who can release forwards with a defence splitting pass and not a side-splitting pass\", \"Chaplow hasn't lived up to the potential of last year.\"\nThe 28-year-old former Southampton player played on loan for the Lions last season. \"I feel duped by Chaplow. In his appearances on loan, he seemed a decent player.\"\n\"Nicky Bailey is a good footballer and superb midfielder at this level, but only in a deeper position. He battles and can spray the ball. That bit of invention in and around the box is lacking.\" The 28-year-old former Middlesbrough man has been criticised for both his fitness and his attitude.\n\"Bailey was excellent in the first half (against Huddersfield), but then faded to almost nothing in the second. He has big fitness, issues, I reckon\", \"He needs to realise that we don't take to big-time Charlies\", \"He needs to get fit, stop moaning at everyone, get stuck in and work hard.\"\nLiam Trotter\n\"Some on here have an irrational hatred of Liam Trotter because he doesn't fit into their dated concept of a Millwall player. He's a gifted player, and we can build a formation around him that allows him to play his natural game.\"\n\"Trotter can make the difference. He has good vision, touch and strength, but he will always divide opinion because he doesn't chase every ball and lost cause\", \"Trotter runs ahead of the front two better than Bailey and Abdou, but he doesn't do enough elsewhere and goes missing.\"\nThe 25-year-old former Ipswich midfielder is widely acknowledged to be the Lions most creative player, but he is regularly criticised for both his lack of mobility and for disappearing from games.\n\"Laziest, trouble-making waste of air. He is consistent at being the laziest, greediest over-rated player we have had for years\", \"He's too immobile\", \"I wonder if he causes as much tension amongst the players as he does amongst the supporters.\"\n\"To get the best out of him, you need to structure the entire team around him to compensate for his lack of mobility, and he simply is not good enough to be building a team around.\"\nWide Midfield\n\"There's a worrying lack of balls coming in from the wings. Most of the crosses attempted hit the first man\", \"Our wingers are quite poor with chances created\", \"We need consistent good balls into the box for Morison.\"\nMost Lions believe that their lack of natural width has made them one-dimensional when attacking and defensively vulnerable down their flanks. \"Easter, Martin and Chaplow aren't wingers, but they can play out wide\", \"We have nothing down the left.\"\n\"Martin Woolford has been too good this year to go totally out of form\", \"After a magnificent start looks to have gone off the boil, and needs to be rested\", \"He's not the most flamboyant but is more effective than most.\"\n\"Woolford is not effective enough over 90 minutes. He plays in flashes like Liam Trotter.\" The 28-year-old ex-Bristol City player has been regularly swapped with the \"ineffective\" 26-year-old former ITFC player Lee Martin on the left flank, with one replacing the other from the bench.\nLee Martin\n\"If Lee Martin is a better player than James Henry, I'll give the game up\", \"Martin does not bring anything to the table\", \"I have yet to see anything from him and too injury prone.\"\n\"Liam Feeney offers nothing out wide. He never goes past a player, and can't cross a ball\", \"He had one good game when we beat Ipswich at home and scored four. He was dynamite.\" The 26-year-old former Bournemouth man \"is our most natural right-sided midfielder, but is not a match winner.\"\n\"Holloway likes wingers, so Feeney's season could be just about to get going\", \"Feeney is much maligned. He has pace and can take people on. He would be blinding in a team with attacking midfielders, but he does need some crossing practice.\"\nStrikers\n\"Looking at our attacking options, none of them have pace or offer natural width\", \"I know it's not all down to them, because the service is s*** or non-existent, but for two strikers who should be up with the league's best, their goal return have been pretty poor.\"\nSteve Morison\n\"We desperately need a goal poacher. Steve Morison is not a natural finisher.\" The 30-year-old former Budgie is back with the Lions, on loan from Leeds. \"He works hard but is pissing in the wind with zero creativity from midfield\", \"Morison will come good. He's a handful on his day for any defender.\"\n\"If Morison had anyone who could receive his flick-ons, he'd be well worth the money. He won almost every header at Watford\", \"Against Huddersfield, he started winning a lot of aerial balls and we suddenly looked much more of a threat.\"\nAustralia international Scott McDonald \"is a class act, but has been played in a ridiculous role as a target man, and has been carrying an injury.\" The 30-year-old former Celtic and Middlesbrough striker \"can't play too many games on the spin.\"\n\"McDonald is so annoying in the way he goes up blind alleys only to give the ball away. He does this in the middle of the pitch, which puts us under pressure when we lose possession.\"\n\"We all know what John Marquis can't do\", \"He should just be given a start elsewhere.\" The 21-year-old is seen as \"League Two standard.\" It's also worth adding that former Palace striker Jermaine Easter is suspended for Saturday's game, having been red-carded at Southend.\nAndy Keogh\nAndy Keogh\nThe 27-year-old Republic of Ireland international and former Wolves man has \"been missing since 2012, and has been a one goal in six games forward throughout his career\", \"One purple patch and a decent first touch\", \"On his day, he's a good player, but that day has not been seen for ages.\"\n\"I couldn't fault Keogh when he came on against Huddersfield. He looked eager to impress, even putting the effort in tracking back\", \"He got into better positions than McDonald or Martin had done, and looks a better partner for Morison.\"\nTactics at Huddersfield\n\"4-3-3. That's certainly different.\" Ian Holloway set the Lions out his favoured formation in their narrow 1-0 defeat last Saturday. \"Nicky Bailey seems to be playing the holding midfield role so that Jimmy Abdou can use his energy to break the play up higher up the pitch.\"\nAt Huddersfield, Holloway sent out ten of the starting XI which capitulated against Southend, changing formation and replacing the suspended Easter with Scott MacDonald. Despite regaining some of their self-respect, many Lions expect changes this Saturday.\n\"We would have closed Huddersfield down quicker is we had left Jimmy on\", \"Holloway wanted to go for it, but that point would have stopped the rot and been invaluable.\" Abdou was replaced by Liam Trotter midway through the second half, as the new manager sought a late winner.\n\"Both our full-backs left their wingers with lots of space out on the by-line, and tucked in to give us a more compact defence. That had to be on instructions, but it also meant that they were faced with wingers running straight at them.\"\n\"A decent performance to build on ahead of Ipswich at home\", \"The funniest moment happened while the players were warming up. Ollie came out and bowed to the Millwall end. The Huddersfield fans started to give him stick, so he flicked up his coat to show them his arse as he walked away.\"\nLions' Views on ITFC, the Game and the McCarthy Era\n\"If Ollie is the signing of the season, he should have an inauguration. Pack the Den to see such a great manager in the flesh. Should we call that Ollie's ‘Wall versus Big Mick's Tractor Boys?\" \"I think we can make a better judgement after Ipswich when he's had at least a week training them.\"\n\"There will be a nice Millwall welcome for Big Mick, and an opportunity to show Holloway that the crowd can play its part this season\", \"Ipswich have been doing well but lost their last two. I expect them to really come at us\", \"It's another big test for them all against Ipswich.\"\nMcCarthy as Millwall manager\n\"Why we give McCarthy such a hard time is beyond me. He did well when he was our manager. You can never blame anyone for wanting to better themselves\", \"Still got great respect for him. There's nothing better than good honest hard-working managers.\"\n\"I quite liked the McCarthy era\", \"He wasn't the best at signing good players, but we played some nice football and got some great memories from his time as manager\", \"McCarthy's side played the best football I have ever seen at Millwall.\"\nNot all Lions will give Mick a warm welcome, as one poster put it on one forum: \"Let's give the Irish **** Mick McCarthy loads of abuse as well. Mind you, he's too thick to even realise.\"\nLions' Views on Forest 5-0 West Ham\n\"Wet Spam? Please turn it in with that b***ocks, Vermin is fine, nothing else\", \"That little lad crying should tell the cameras to f*** off. Certain things are worth crying about. Losing a football match isn't one of them.\"\nLions haven't been able to conceal their glee at the heavy cup defeats suffered by their bitter rivals. \"My ex-wife went off with a West Ham fan. Revenge is sweet, and I didn't have to lift a finger. It's the only time I have felt sympathy for a West Ham supporter.\"\n\"Keep it up, Agent Sam, 13th best paid manager in Europe and a true tactical genius\", \"6-0 and no yellow cards. I'd have been kicking lumps out of the flash bastards at 2-0\", \"I'm going to call my missus West Ham. She also kicks off every 15 minutes.\"\n\"Sam Allardyce said ‘We are in a hole and we need to dig ourselves out'. Now Sam, what happens when you are in a hole and keep digging?\" \"Don't worry. They've signed a third division centre-half to save them\", \"Relegation Roger (Johnson).\"\nOne Final Rallying Cry For Saturday\n\"We can live on our knees, or in true Millwall fashion we can die fighting. That is Millwall. Not even money coming out of your eyes should come between your heart and this club. If we retreat or throw in the towel whilst we breathe, we should never have been here in the first place.\n\"We are Millwall. However you arrived here, we don't ever let anyone take this away. Not any one, and there are many who want to see our club and heritage fail. Let's turn out in numbers! I want a f***ing spectacular turn-out! Stand up and be counted, ‘Wall, no f***ing about!\"\nWebsites\nThere are two excellent forums to look at, with the customary warning for the omnipresent industrial language!\nThe House of Fun requires registration, but is the busiest and most informed message board and North Stand Banter is less busy but also very knowledgeable and informative.\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nsome of the lines from the Millwall fans are classic, very much don't want to meet them outside the ground\nMy 3 year old son has global delay (additional needs) and loves ipswich town, we have decorated hes room with all ipswich stuff and blue and white walls but he is missing one thing a itfc lampshade!! If anyone is selling or know where I can get one please let me know thanks very appricated.\nApologies for their length, but these notes are actually a watered down version of a first draft, and there were other comments which simply could never, ever be included.\nAs for the football, it won't be easy, what with it being the first home game of a new era, but their defensive and fitness issues cannot be solved in a week (they have a week off next week and are off to Portugal for a fitness training camp). It may not be a bad time to play them as it may be too soon for their momentum to kick in.\nI hope what we can generate a high tempo to wear them out and use our wide front men to get at their full backs, especially Frank Nouble on the right. Following on from Mick's comments in Phil's report, I anticipate that defensive errors will be kept to a minimum! Let's hope so anyway.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
