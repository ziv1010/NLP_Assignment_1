  "body_text": "Wales are relishing the prospect of “spoiling England’s party” by knocking them out of the 2025 European Championship.\nWales have a monumental task ahead of them if they are to progress to the quarter-finals of the competition, needing to beat England in their last group game on Sunday by four goals and relying on France to get the better of the Netherlands.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, Rhian Wilkinson’s side can also prevent England from reaching the knockout stages and should they at least avoid defeat against the Lionesses this could open the door for the Netherlands to progress at their expense.\n“These women have fought so hard for so long, many of them, their whole careers, to have this opportunity,” manager Wilkinson told a press conference on Saturday. “I will not allow us to feel like we’re just here to participate. So we will continue to celebrate.”\nWales, the lowest ranked side in the competition, have suffered two defeats against superior opposition in France (4-1) and the Netherlands (3-0) and sit fourth on 0 points.\nBut they have continued to celebrate the small wins, including their first goal at a major tournament scored by Jess Fishlock against France on Wednesday.\n“Why wouldn’t we go towards a rivalry?” said Wilkinson, a Canadian familiar with cross-border rivalries. “This will only benefit the women’s game, and we’re going to push them as much as possible to the very end.\n“We’re in an incredibly close group. England will be forced to play a strong lineup because it is such a close group, and there’s also a goal differential. So for my women, we get to show up and spoil the party, and that’s a wonderful job to have.”\nWhen asked what it would mean to knock out England, Seattle Reign midfielder Angharad James paused, sizing up her words for measure.\n“We just concentrate on delivering the game plan, getting the performance right and the result hopefully will come with that,” she said.\n“As a Welsh woman, do you want to knock England out? Of course you do. It’s in our blood, our DNA and the rivalry has always been there and always will be there. You have to come back to the occasion and this is just another game of football.”\nEngland defender Alex Greenwood said being the team others relish attempting to beat should be something the Lionesses take pride in.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s something we’re probably used to, that’s a pressure we’ve invited because we’ve been successful and we should be actually quite proud of,” Greenwood said. “We don’t really focus too much on that, we focus on ourselves and our game plan and the objective.\n“For me personally it’s another game. It’s now the most important game we want to play. That’s how I look at it and that’s how I treat it. For the fans and everyone around it I think it’s brilliant. The atmosphere tomorrow is going to be great and something we can all look forward to. But from a personal perspective it’s another really important game.”\nSarina Wiegman confirmed England had no injury concerns ahead of their final group game, with everyone available to play 90 minutes.\nWales, meanwhile, have a fully fit squad apart from goalkeeper Poppy Soper who was injured in training. In line with UEFA regulations, which states goalkeepers may be replaced before a team submits their match sheet for the next match, Wales will call up a third goalkeeper. An official announcement is expected later.\nWho can still qualify from Group D?\nBy The Athletic’s Cerys Jones\nThis is the only group where all four teams can technically still qualify, though for Wales, it is extremely unlikely.\nFirst, if England beat Wales on Sunday, they are through. If England and Wales draw, England would progress unless the Netherlands beat France. If England lose to Wales, they would need France to beat the Netherlands. That would send the decision between Wales, the Netherlands, and England going through to goal difference between the three, where England’s current margin of +4 puts them in a very strong position.\nFor the Netherlands to progress, they need to beat France and for England to lose or draw against Wales. France only need to avoid defeat to be certain of going through. If they lose to the Netherlands, they will still go through if England fail to win. If England win and France lose, it would come down to goal difference in the head-to-head clashes between France, England, and the Netherlands, where the Netherlands are at a significant disadvantage due to their heavy loss to England.\nWales can technically still qualify – but they would need to beat England by at least four goals and for France to beat the Netherlands.\n(Photo: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images)",
