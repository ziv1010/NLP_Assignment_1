  "body_text": "The 2025/26 Nigeria Women’s Football League (NWFL) Premiership officially kicks off on Wednesday, November 26, with twenty top-flight clubs set to begin their quest for glory.\nThe opening day promises an action-packed start, featuring ten matches across two groups as teams look to build early momentum in a season brimming with fresh talent, renewed rivalries, and tactical upgrades.\nThe most anticipated fixture of the opening day is the South-South derby between defending champions Bayelsa Queens and 2023/24 winners Edo Queens at the Samson Siasia Stadium in Yenagoa.\nHistorical encounters between the sides favour Bayelsa Queens, who have won four of their last seven meetings against Edo Queens, who have recorded only a single victory in that period. The derby promises intensity, skill, and competitive spirit as both sides aim to start their campaigns on a winning note.\nIn Group A, Adamawa Queens will host Pacesetter Queens in Makwada. Adamawa, who finished seventh in Group B last season, are determined to improve their fortunes by leveraging midfield stability and defensive discipline to counter Pacesetter’s dynamic front line.\nPacesetter, making their top-flight debut after extensive recruitment, blend youthful energy with experienced campaigners and will hope to emulate the survival success of other South-West newcomers like Remo Stars Ladies and Dannaz Ladies. Heartland Queens face Ekiti Queens in Owerri, with Heartland seeking redemption after a disappointing previous season.\nEkiti, entering their third consecutive top-flight campaign, are focused on maintaining their league status. The fixture promises tactical midfield battles and intense competition, with both teams looking to assert early dominance.\nMeanwhile, Naija Ratels will host Ibom Angels in Abuja. After a poor showing in last season’s Super Six, Naija Ratels aim for redemption, while Ibom Angels, guided by veteran tactician Edwin Okon, hope to start their title challenge confidently. Last season, both teams won their respective home fixtures 2–1.\nThe scheduled Castmog Ladies versus Rivers Angels match in Abeokuta will not hold, as Castmog failed to meet registration and club-licensing requirements, granting Rivers Angels a bye.\nIn Group B, Nasarawa Amazons take on Delta Queens in Lafia in a fixture likely to be decided by tactical discipline. Both sides missed out on last season’s Super Six, and each club won their respective home fixtures 1–0 in previous encounters.\nConfluence Queens will host Abia Angels in Iyamho, with Confluence hoping to improve on a poor season, while Abia aim to extend the momentum of winning the last two encounters.\nSunshine Queens face FC Robo Queens in Akure, with Robo having won three of the last five meetings, though newly promoted Sunshine recently claimed a 3–0 victory. Ahudiyannem Queens, debutants guided by Super Falcons assistant coach Ann Chiejine, will lock horns with last season’s Super Six side Remo Stars Ladies in Umuahia.\nThe match represents a tactical showdown between the only two CAF A-licensed women’s coaches in the league. Dannaz Ladies and Osun Babes will meet in Lagos in a South-West derby, with Dannaz entering their third consecutive top-flight season and Osun Babes making their top-flight debut.\nUPDATE NEWS:\nNigerians can now invest ₦2.5 million on premium domains and profit about ₦17-₦25 million.
