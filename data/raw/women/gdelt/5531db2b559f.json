  "body_text": "Arsenal Women crashed out of the Women’s FA Cup this afternoon, losing 0-1 to Manchester City, in the fifth round of the competition.\nArsenal, 14 time winners of the Women’s FA Cup, played well on the whole. But Manchester City were the better team on the day. The first half of the game was a little lacking in lustre, but in the second half both teams came alive, with good football either end and good chances either end. Arsenal’s Sabrina D’Angelo made some super saves for our Gunners, but Man City’s Khiara Keating made some wonder saves between the sticks. For me, no goal-line technology lost our Gunners the game when Keating looked to handle the ball over the line from an Arsenal corner but it wasn’t given..\nMany are calling for head coach Jonas Eidevall to go. This season Arsenal Women, under Jonas’ leadership, have:\n- been knocked out in Round 1 of the Champions League\n- been knocked out in the 5th round of the FA Cup\n- are struggling in the WSL after 3 defeats to mid-table teams\nEidevall has, arguably, has the best squad in the WSL, an embarrassing amount of midfield options and he keeps getting it wrong. It’s becoming a hugely disappointing season for us Gooners..\nShould Eidevall have been sacked after losing to arch north London rivals Tottenham, for the first time ever, in December? Or our our Gunners defeat to West Ham, again, for the first time ever?\nEidevall refuses to concede title after Arsenal Women suffer shock West Ham defeat.. Is Eidevall delusional?\nAre you still keeping your hopes up for the season Gooners? I’m struggling..\nMichelle Maxwell\nFollow JustArsenal’s Gooner Women on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Womens Team!\nDo you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?
