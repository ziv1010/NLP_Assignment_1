One of those sites is in Broward County and has an important history.\nThe former site of Broward County’s colored beach is now Von D. Mizell Eula Johnson State Park, named after two civil rights activists who led the charge to desegregate Broward’s beaches. When a statewide proposal suggested adding pickleball courts, the community was up in arms.\n\"Let’s have respect for the history that's there, and not try to gentrify the beaches,\" said Emmanuel George, a community archivist and historian who runs the instagram account Black Broward.\nHe says that the proposal is a step in the wrong direction, and that the park shouldn’t focus on commercial development, but instead cultural development.\n“With more emphasis on this being a historically black beach, it could then bring more people to appreciate the beach,” said George. “And more cultural based events could be more reminiscent of back in the day when black folks, this was our beach”\nPublic meetings on the proposed changes scheduled for early this week were postponed until early September, though no dates have been specified.\nREAD MORE: Florida drops proposal for golf on wilderness land amid demands to preserve state parks\nLow gas prices expected for Labor Day weekend\nFloridians could see the lowest Labor Day weekend gas prices for the first time in three years.\nAccording to Triple A, the average price for regular unleaded gas in Florida right now is $3.29 per gallon.\nDrivers last year, paid 39 cents more per gallon during the Labor Day holiday.\nREAD MORE: A cheaper, greener way to build in Florida?

Many tickets for earlier Copa matches reportedly went unsold. That led CONMEBOL to slash prices at the last minute in order to fill seats.
