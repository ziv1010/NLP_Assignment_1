You do that for 17 years of your life and you go through the motions.\n\"Making the transition, I had to turn the brain back on and hone in on the skills.\"\nGallagher has swapped the role of striker for that of a league winger and has already shown her potency for scoring with a double in last weekend's loss to North Queensland.\nShe could well make the switch to the forwards in the future and says she hasn't ruled out juggling both codes.\n\"I still think there's still a lot more to achieve in soccer,\" she added.\nAustralian Associated Press",
