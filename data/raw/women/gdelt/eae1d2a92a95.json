  "body_text": "Australia Out As Afghanistan Enter T20 World Cup Semi-Finals\nIn a game that featured multiple rain delays and questionable delaying tactics, Afghanistan scored 5/115 off their 20 overs and Bangladesh were set a target of 114 runs from 19 overs under the Duckworth Lewis method.\nIn a thrilling run chase, Afghanistan bowled Bangladesh out for 105 with just seven balls remaining to win their second Super 8 game and leapfrog Australia in the Group 1 standings.\nTalismanic legspinner Rashid Khan finished with figures of 4/23, leading another superb bowling display from his side.\nThe result means Afghanistan will play South Africa in the first semi-final on Thursday, before India take on England in a blockbuster semi on Friday.\nAustralia has been knocked out in the group stage in consecutive T20 World Cups and their quest to hold every men's and women's trophy in world cricket is over.\nBut Afghanistan's win was overshadowed by some time delaying tactics that bordered on blatant cheating, as they looked to book their spot in the semis on net run rate in case rain robbed them of the chance to bowl Bangladesh out.\nMidway through Bangladesh's rain affected innings, Afghanistan led by two runs under the DLS system when rain started to fall again after 11.4 overs.\nNoticing the rain, Afghanistan coach and former England international Jonathan Trott gestured to his players to slow down, clearly hoping play would be stopped before another ball could be bowled.\nAt that stage if play could not continue, Afghanistan would have advanced to the semi-finals over Australia.\nViewers and cricket fans were having none of it.\n“Oh no no no, sorry. You can't have this,” Simon Doull said in commentary.\n“I'm not accepting that.\n“Even Rashid (Khan) doesn't like it.\n“It's just delay tactics. I get it but I don't like that at all. It is unacceptable.\n“They might have gone off anyway for the rain but that's not a good look.\n“I know the Euros are going on in football, you'd be better off there.”\nWhen Gulbadin claimed the wicket of Tanzim Hasan Sakib moments later, Doull quipped:“Gulbadin, paper hamstrings but a golden arm.”\nAustralian spinner Adam Zampa described Gulbadin's injury as“the old rainstring”.\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan wrote on X:“Spirit of cricket is alive & kicking ...”\nCode Sports' Daniel Cherny said:“This is epically farcical.\n“The Test season 4 should just be footage of the Aussie boys on the piss watching this game.”\nCricket broadcaster Geoff Lemon posted:“Gulbadin Naib, the Luis Suarez of cricket.”\nOn Sunday, Afghanistan defeated Australia to draw level with the Aussies on two points each.\nAustralia's campaign was left in tatters after Indian captain Rohit Sharma obliterated them with a knock of 92 from 41 deliveries.\nBut Australia's 24-run loss to India put their World Cup fate in the hands of Bangladesh.\nThe early elimination also likely marks the end of David Warner's international cricket career.\nWarner, 37, retired from Test and One Day International cricket last summer and was expected to call time on his international T20 career after this World Cup. com)\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
