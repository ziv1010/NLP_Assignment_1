  "body_text": "Burger King Russia is at it again. In a recent ad offering, it vowed to offer any Russian woman that gets pregnant with a World Cup athlete $47,000 and a lifetime supply of Whoppers. The company’s goal was to “pass good genes” to Russia.\nEven though the burger chain has taken down the promotion offering and apologized for it being “too insulting,” the damage cannot be undone.\nWe apologize for the statement we made. It turned out to be too insulting,\nBurger King Russia said on the country’s main social media site, VK.\nThe restaurant first published the ad on Tuesday morning. Even though the company deleted the offensive ad, a print screen shows it promised Russian women $47,000 and free burgers for life if they got impregnated as requested. The ad included a close-up picture of a pregnant woman’s baby bump.\nThe Russian media trolled Burger King for pushing social responsibility too far, by offering Russian girls the possibility of getting the best football genes and a lifelong supply of Whoppers. The Russian national team will be reportedly thanking these women for several generations to come.\n- The U.S. chain’s media relationships department apologized for the blunder too.\n- The department labeled the ad as “clearly offensive” when contacted by Fox News.\nThe company also said that it had removed the ad as soon as it was brought to its attention. Burger King America insisted that the ad does not reflect the company’s values.\nBurger King Russia’s blunder was likely a reaction to a Russian lawmaker’s call to all Russian women for not having casual sexual encounters with World Cup athletes. The lawmaker was concerned that some Russian girls might have children with the visiting players.\nIt is not the first time, however, that Burger King Russia insults Russian women. Last year, it used the image of a rape victim in a similar promotion.\nLast year, @BurgerKing in Russia released an ad depicting a 17-year-old victim of rape and beating. They were obviously forced to take it down, however, this multinational corporation has never apologised. Perhaps it’s time? @StaceyDooley #Feminism #WomensMarch #Equality #Russia pic.twitter.com/hL5cy2GN7B\n— Michael (@Michael_Dunn4) February 3, 2018\nImage Source: Flickr",
