  "body_text": "2024/25 Women's FA Cup quarter-final predictions\n- The quarter-finals of the 2024/25 Women’s FA Cup take place this weekend\n- Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United among last eight\n- Sunderland are the only non-WSL club left in the competition at this stage\nEight clubs set to battle it out in the Adobe Women's FA Cup quarter-finals this weekend.\nAmong them are holders Manchester United, who claimed their first major honour when they overcame Tottenham Hotspur in the final at Wembley Stadium last season. 14-time winners Arsenal are also in the final eight, along with reigning Women's Super League champions Chelsea.\nAfter the weekend's quarter-finals, the semi-finals will take place in a little over a month's time on 13 April. The final is then scheduled for Sunday 18 May at Wembley Stadium.\nHere, 90min predicts who will come out on top in each of the four quarter-final clashes.\nManchester United vs Sunderland\nLast season's winners take on the lowest-ranked team left in the competition. Sunderland overcame Portsmouth, Exeter City and Huddersfield Town to reach this stage of the competition, while Manchester United beat third tier West Brom and Wolves in the fourth and fifth rounds, respectively.\nAlthough Marc Skinner's side are yet to face a significant test in this year’s competition, their form in the WSL this season points to a comfortable victory - it's seven straight league wins coming into the weekend and they are the closest challengers to leaders Chelsea.\nSunderland, on the other hand, are mid-table in the Women's Championship with just seven wins from 15 league games. Even if Skinner were to rotate his team for this fixture, United should have more than enough to come through it with relative ease.\nPrediction: Manchester United 5-0 Sunderand\nManchester City vs Aston Villa\nAston Villa have proven to be a tough test for Manchester City over the years, and this season has been no different. Villa found the net in each of their WSL meetings this term, but the Manchester club narrowly won on both occasions.\nVilla have shown before they are capable of upsetting giants in this competition. It was at this stage in 2022/23 that Rachel Daly fired Villa to a marginal 2-1 victory over City to reach the semi-finals.\nHowever, although Villa are now working under a new manager in Natalia Arroyo, their form this season has been rather inconsistent. For that reason, City should come out on top, although both teams are likely to find the net.\nPrediction: Manchester City 3-1 Aston Villa\nChelsea vs Crystal Palace\nIt is hard to see anything other than a Chelsea victory in this fixture. Unfortunately for Crystal Palace, they face arguably the most in-form team in Europe.\nChelsea’s 7-0 thrashing of Palace at Selhurst Park earlier this season is likely still etched in the memories of Eagles fans, a stark reminder of just how ruthless Chelsea can be on their day.\nAs they struggle at the bottom of the WSL table, it is already shaping up to be a season to forget for Palace. Chelsea should have more than enough to come through this tie unscathed.\nPrediction: Chelsea 5-0 Crystal Palace\nArsenal vs Liverpool\nThis is one of the tougher games to call this weekend, as Arsenal only narrowly edged their last WSL meeting with Liverpool, winning 1-0. While the Gunners have swept aside numerous teams this term, Liverpool proved a tougher side to break down.\nThat said, the Merseyside club have endured an inconsistent season, even undergoing a change of manager, and struggled to build on last year’s top-four finish. While reaching an FA Cup semi-final would be a significant achievement for Liverpool, priority is staying clear of relegation danger in the WSL and putting their safety beyond doubt.\nIt may not be straightforward for Arsenal, but they should come out on top by the final whistle. Unfortunately for neutrals, this year's competition is unlikely to produce any major upsets.",
