And controversies around YouTube star MrBeast are bubbling.\nHere’s what to know today.\nInside Harris’ ‘gut’ decision to choose Walz as her running mate\nBefore yesterday’s campaign rally in Pennsylvania, it’s possible that many people outside of Minnesota didn’t know who Tim Walz was. The Minnesota governor, whose recent use of the word “weird” on national TV to label the Republican opposition won him some notoriety, was considered a dark-horse contender to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate.\nMany people anticipated Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro would instead be Harris’ final choice. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona was also among the final three in consideration.\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.\nIn the end, after meetings with the three finalists, Harris concluded she had the best personal rapport with Walz and was convinced that he would have her back and not let his personal ambitions get in the way. Ultimately, people close to Harris said, it came down to trusting her “gut.” The choice was officially announced yesterday morning.\nNow, Americans are getting to know Walz: a politician, a longtime teacher and football coach, and a veteran. And Harris is betting that his Midwestern dad charm will win over America like it won over her own team.\nIn interviews with more than a dozen Democrats, several who requested anonymity to speak candidly about what happened behind the scenes, NBC News’ politics team got the inside story on how Harris whittled down the list of potential running mates (all middle-aged white men) and got to Walz.\nMore campaign coverage:\n- Harris and Walz are now hitting the campaign trail together, with stops today in Wisconsin and Michigan. Follow our live blog.\n- Trump and his allies reacted with a mix of relief and disbelief and moved quickly to cast the choice as liberal overload.\n- Walz’s 2022 election results don’t show a clear blue-collar boost, NBC News and MSNBC national political correspondent Steve Kornacki writes.\n- With Walz’s outspoken support of abortion rights and IVF, Democrats put the hot-button issue at the top of their agenda.\n- A Harris-Walz win would pave the way for Minnesota’s first female and Native American governor.\n- Walz’s former students, football players and colleagues have nothing but fond memories of Mantako West High’s “most inspiring teacher.”\n- The 2024 campaign reset is now complete, NBC News chief political analyst Chuck Todd writes. Now, a few key questions will decide the winner. Read the full analysis here.\nAmerican runners dominate on the track\nTeam USA racked up more gold medals in track and field, most notably in the women’s 200-meter and the men’s 1500-meter finals. Here’s what happened.\nIn the women’s 200-meter race, American Gabby Thomas won the championship that had long eluded her and denied 100-meter winner St. Lucia’s Julien Alfred a double gold. Thomas finished in 21.83 seconds (Watch her impressive run here). Alfred took second, and America’s Brittany Brown won third.\nIn the men’s 1500-meter, American Cole Hocker set an Olympic record in his dash to the finish line with a time of 3:27.65 — and in a surprising fashion. At 1,200 meters, Hocker was in fourth place, but he overtook two race favorites, Great Britain’s Josh Kerr and Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen, in the final 100 meters to win. Kerr won silver and America’s Yared Nuguse won bronze.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. women’s soccer team will play Brazil this weekend for the gold medal after beating Germany 1-0 in the group stage rematch yesterday.

Sinwar, accused by the Israeli military of being the architect of the Oct. 7 attack, was allegedly last seen in a video clip three days after the attack fleeing into a tunnel in southern Gaza with his family. Israeli officials have blasted the decision to install Sinwar.\nSinwar has long been in charge of Hamas’ governance within the Gaza Strip and reportedly helped form its security force. After spending more than 20 years of a life sentence in prison, he was released in a prisoner exchange in 2011 and rose through the ranks of the organization. Here’s what else is known about him.\nEPA issues emergency order to stop using pesticide\nThe Environmental Protection Agency issued its first emergency order in almost 40 years to immediately stop the use of a pesticide that can harm fetuses. The herbicide, dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (that’s a mouthful) is used to control weeds on a variety of crops, including broccoli, onions, kale, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and strawberries.\nIf a pregnant woman is exposed to DCPA or Dacthal, as it’s more colloquially known, it can cause changes to hormone levels that can have lasting consequences for the child, including low birth weight, impaired brain development, decreased IQ and impaired motor skills later in life, the EPA said. The chemical has been banned in the European Union since 2009. Read more about the ban.\nYouTube star MrBeast carries on amid controversy\nJimmy Donaldson, the YouTube personality known as MrBeast, has been subjected to some of the most intense scrutiny of his career as controversies swirl about a former collaborator and his new reality TV show.\nThe recent backlash began after his former collaborator Ava Kris Tyson was accused of sending inappropriate messages to a minor. Some fans have speculated that Donaldson knew about the messages, but he said in a post on X that he didn’t know about them. Then, reports surfaced that contestants on his upcoming reality TV competition show “Beast Games” were subjected to unsafe conditions, such as inadequate access to food and medical care while on set. A spokesperson for Donaldson said the shoot was “complicated by the CrowdStrike incident, extreme weather and unexpected logistical and communication issues.”\nAmid the controversy, MrBeast is still putting out content and growing his brand. As one expert put it, “there’s really no mechanisms for accountability” for large creators. And MrBeast is the biggest YouTuber in the world.\nPolitics in Brief\nPrimary results: Rep. Cori Bush lost the Democratic primary in Missouri, a race that exposed the party’s divisions in Israel.
