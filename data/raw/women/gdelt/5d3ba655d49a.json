That's our biggest loss this year and it's really just kicked everyone into gear.\n\"Hopefully it's one loss we had to have. But it highlighted things that we do need to be really switched on with, and hopefully we can bounce back this weekend.\"\nThe Jets produced a huge result south of the border on January 21, beating A-League Women heavyweights Melbourne City for the first time in the history of the competition.\nThey are targeting another big win in Victoria on Saturday night (7.30pm) against Ayres' former club Melbourne Victory in Shepparton.\nIt has been more than eight years since the Jets beat Victory on the road, a 3-1 triumph on December 29, 2017.\nA win would not only boost the Jets' confidence, it could lift them back into the top six.\nMORE SPORT:\nNewcastle are ninth on 16 points, just one point below Victory (17) with a game in hand and only three points adrift of sixth-placed Central Coast (19).\nLeaders City (23) are only four points ahead of the Mariners.\n\"Some people don't like to think about the ladder, but I know I want to play finals, so I'm looking at it and each game's so important from now on,\" Ayres said.\n\"It's there for the taking for sure.\"\nTo be a chance of success, the Jets need to be steelier in defence across the park.\nThree of Phoenix's goals came from outside of the 18-yard box and from players who were not challenged.\nAfter conceding five goals, four in the first 23 minutes, the Jets are now the second leakiest side in the league.\nUp the other end, Ayres was Newcastle's lone scorer, taking her season tally to four when she pounced on a rebound.\nNewcastle are taking plenty of chances - they have the fourth-highest statistic for shots attempted in the competition - but need to be clinical.\nVictory were ruthless with their chances when they beat the Jets 3-1 in Newcastle on December 18, but they have not won a game since.\nSeventeen-year-old goalkeeper Georgia Ritchie could retain her place in the Jets' starting side after making her A-League debut against Wellington in place of injured New Zealand international Anna Leat (shoulder).\nLeat remains in doubt this weekend and the Newcastle Herald understands captain Cassidy Davis could also miss the trip south as she manages ongoing foot issues.\nMeanwhile, attacking player Charlotte Lancaster has earned her first call-up to the New Zealand senior squad after scoring three goals in eight appearances for the Jets.\nLancaster and Jets forward Kelli Brown were named in the Football Ferns' squad for upcoming World Cup qualifying matches in the Solomon Islands.",
