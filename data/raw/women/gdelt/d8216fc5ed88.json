  "body_text": "Nearly four years after Jubilee, inde darlings Japanese Breakfast are out with their latest album: For Melancholy Brunettes (& Sad Women).\nThe Hoddle of Coffee: Tottenham Hotspur News and Links for Wednesday, March 26\nYour track of the day\nMichelle Zauner, who fronts the band, has done a lot since their previous album. She’s written a best-selling memoir in Crying In H Mart (seriously, a must-read), began adapting it for film, moved to Korea and partook in university, and recorded this album.\nWe’ve known the latest album’s been coming. Your hoddler-in-chief featured it in a Track of the Day back in January.\nZauner took inspiration from a collection of short stories from John Cheever, and she clung to the word “melancholy” which she said inspired the tracks to this latest output.\nAt about 30 minutes, this is a pretty short album.\nThere aren’t any heavy hitters here like Be Sweet or Slide Tackle, instead every song appears to draw the listener further and further inward.\nI’m not sure if it’s the album’s length or the music arrangements, but this album doesn’t feel complete. I listened to it twice in a breeze, each time left wanting something more.\nIt’ll be interesting to see where Zauner goes from here and how these songs will fit into the band’s upcoming tour. I’m looking forward to more songs of her and hope the music can carry the words better.\nFitzie’s track of the day: Picture Window, by Japanese Breakfast\nAnd now for your links:\nJay Harris ($$): “‘You have to prove people wrong’ – analysing Djed Spence’s interview with Rio Ferdinand”\nFootball London: “Tottenham’s best 25 players of the last 25 years: Numbers 20 to 16 revealed”\nESPN: “Trinity Rodman back on USWNT squad, first time since Olympics”\nTelegraph: “Joey Barton guilty of assault after kicking wife in head”\nHere are your missing Tuesday links:\nThe Athletic ($$): “Amid losing streak, Tottenham Hotspur give head coach Robert Vilahamn time: ‘We’re doing this together’”\nDan KP: “Djed Spence reveals Antonio Conte ‘shattered my confidence’ with transfer comments”\nFootball London: “Tottenham’s best 25 players of the last 25 years: Numbers 25 to 21 revealed”",
