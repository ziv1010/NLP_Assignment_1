  "body_text": "GOOD MORNING. This is Nick Vinocur, bringing you Playbook after a stint in my native Sweden, where the Midsommar celebrations are wilder than ever (though not like this), and the mosquitos are in full effect (though not like this).\nDRIVING THE DAY: AFTERMATH OF A MUTINY\nKREMLIN TRIES TO REASSERT CONTROL AFTER MUTINY: With thousands of mercenaries from the Wagner Group heading back to their bases, Russian President Vladimir Putin took to state TV on Sunday to proclaim that he remained fully focused on his so-called special military operation in Ukraine, and that the situation at the front occupied his every waking hour.\nWhat are friends for? The “nothing to see here” message came as Putin’s pals in Beijing voiced their support for his regime, praising what the Chinese foreign ministry in a statement called his “strategic guidance.”\nFashionably late: Yet as my colleague Stuart Lau notes, Beijing’s backing for Putin only came after it was clear that there was no longer any immediate threat to the Kremlin — raising the question of just how far Beijing’s “no limits partnership” with Moscow really goes.\n**A message from SQM: In 2023, SQM is quadrupling the production capacity of its lithium refinery in Antofagasta compared to 2018 to meet the growing global demand for lithium for use in electric vehicle batteries. Annual lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide production capacity will be increased to 210,000 metric tons by the end of 2023. Read more here.**\nBottom line: While it’s impossible to say what really spurred Prigozhin’s decision to turn back (speculation about the terms of a deal is rife, and Kremlin spin doctors are hard at work arguing that he had no choice), this much is clear: Putin’s image as Russia’s invulnerable leader is damaged beyond repair, and Russia’s ministry of defense, which oversees the war effort in Ukraine, may be in for some serious disruption.\nHow Ukraine sees it: Kyiv is cheering. “Prigozhin humiliated Putin [and] the state and showed that there is no longer a monopoly on violence,” tweeted Mykhailo Podolyak, a presidential aide. The spectacle of a narrowly avoided civil war in Russia was a powerful tonic for Ukrainians in the midst of a counteroffensive against Russian forces in the south and east, my colleague Zoya Sheftalovich writes in this must-read guide to what’s next after the mutiny.\nIt (probably) ain’t over: In a nutshell, uncertainty reigns and further head-spinning plot twists can’t be ruled out. Prigozhin, the caterer-turned-warlord-turned-mutineer, has dropped off radar screens ever since he was waved off by cheering locals from Rostov-on-Don, headed for Belarus, according to the Kremlin. His press service has said he is not in a position to speak to the media and will “answer questions when he is on normal communications.”\nWhither, Wagner man? His troops, the 25,000-strong Wagner mercenary corps, are either meant to go back to their field bases or sign contracts with Russia’s Ministry of Defense. But, as Zoya points out, to what extent can these troops, who were ready to storm Moscow, be trusted by their peers and by the Kremlin?\nWhat should most worry Putin: Wagner’s superstar exit as its tanks and heavily armed forces pulled out of Rostov, Zoya writes. Crowds of Russians applauded, whistled, waved Wagner flags and chanted “Great job! Great job!” and “Wagner! Wagner!” — just hours after Putin labeled Prigozhin and his followers traitors. Lots more in Zoya’s story, and you can read about Russians’ reaction to the Wagner mutiny here, by Leon Aron, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\nMEANWHILE, BACK IN EUROPE: Leaders and senior officials from more than a dozen countries — including all G7 nations, as well as India, Turkey, Brazil, South Africa and Saudi Arabia, but not Russia or China — gathered in Copenhagen to lay out plans for a future peace in Ukraine and work toward a “peace summit,” according to a senior EU official.\nUkraine ‘peace summit’: The aim is to build an international consensus around the idea of peace for Ukraine, building on the 10-point plan presented by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last year. While no date for the summit has been set, the EU official said it was most likely to take place “after the summer break.” Priorities, eh.\nWould you kindly join us? Asked how it was possible to plan for peace without the aggressor, Russia, the official said a potential blueprint was the Black Sea grain initiative, which was first discussed by Turkey and the U.N. before Russia was brought on board. As for China’s absence, the official said “several requests” for Beijing’s participation had been extended. “Both the global south countries as well as the G7 regretted that China did not participate,” the official said, adding that Beijing would be “invited again.”\nMutiny effect: Did the Wagner mutiny lend extra urgency to the gathering? Although leaders were keeping tabs, they stayed focused on the peace plan. “It’s far too early to judge to say in which direction this will go,” said the official.\nFOREIGN MINISTERS MEET: Meanwhile, EU foreign ministers are gathering today with the crisis in Russia likely to overshadow discussions, Suzanne Lynch writes in from Luxembourg. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba will participate by video link. The Ukrainian minister spoke to various Western officials throughout the weekend including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna.\nOn the agenda: Foreign ministers are expected to agree on a €3.5 billion boost to the EPF, the off-budget fund that has already allocated some €5.6 billion in military aid for Ukraine. The money won’t all go to Ukraine but also to other places like Africa, officials said. Yet Hungary is still blocking the decision to allocate €500 million from the same fund to Ukraine because the Hungarian bank OTP is still on Kyiv’s “name and shame” list, Jacopo Barigazzi writes in to report. You can read his story here.\nRussia everywhere: But the real focus will be developments in Russia and their implications for the war in Ukraine, on the back of a flurry of contact over the weekend between G7 countries. “We are following the situation in Russia with grave concern” Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon told Jacopo. “The events on Saturday prove once again how destabilizing and dangerous the war is for the entire international community.”\nGREEK CONSERVATIVES WIN ELECTION\nMITSOTAKIS SECURES ANOTHER TERM IN POWER: Greek conservative leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis led his party to a comfortable working majority in Sunday’s election. The far right also made gains, giving Greece its most conservative parliament since democracy was restored in 1974, Nektaria Stamouli reports.\nSunday’s election was the second held in the country in five weeks in Greece, after New Democracy came first on May 21 but fell short of an outright majority. “New Democracy is today the strongest center-right party in Europe,” Mitsotakis told enthusiastic supporters cheering him on outside his party’s headquarters.\nConservative surge: New Democracy got 40.5 percent of the vote and 108 seats, plus a bonus 50 seats under a new Greek system that boosts the largest party. Left-wing Syriza struggled with only 17.8 percent and 47 seats, according to official results. The socialist PASOK party had 11.9 percent and 32 seats and the communist KKE had 7.6 percent and 20 seats. The participation rate was 52.7 percent, the interior ministry reported.\nThe trend the EPP wants to talk about: “This is what we see in Greece, also what we saw earlier this year in national elections in Finland and regional elections in Spain. And this is precisely what we will see again in upcoming parliamentary elections in Spain in July and Poland in October. EPP parties are dominating the center, while the center-left is barricaded to its fringes,” said Thanasis Bakolas, secretary-general of the center-right European People’s Party.\nThe trend the EPP doesn’t want to talk about: Several fringe parties — mainly from the far right — managed to score more than 3 percent and top the threshold to make it to parliament. They will now have a platform to broadcast their populist message, putting pressure on the government exploiting politically toxic issues like migration, the relationship with Turkey, abortion, the role of religion in education and Russia sanctions. The far right’s success echoes that seen in other recent European elections.\nNeo-Nazi backed group “Spartans,” a party little known a few weeks ago, got 4.7 percent of the vote, helped by the endorsement of jailed former MP of neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party Ilias Kasidiaris.\nEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\nCRACKING DOWN ON HARASSMENT: The European Parliament’s quaestors — in charge of administrative and financial matters — are preparing a reform of the institution’s anti-harassment procedures, after a POLITICO investigation revealed repeatedly failures to protect victims of bullying by MEPs, Barbara Moens writes in to report.\nThe same, but faster: The proposals, obtained by POLITICO, include stricter deadlines for investigations into harassment complaints, as they can currently take as long as two years to conclude. Anti-harassment training would become mandatory and would become broader to educate MEPs on how to create functioning teams. The Parliament is also considering introducing a mediation service to prevent certain situations from escalating.\nBut but but: The proposals don’t go far enough, according to the MeTooEP movement, which combats sexual harassment and seeks better working conditions within the European Parliament. MeTooEP also pointed out the proposals only cover a small part of the measures which the Parliament adopted in June, arguing they should go further in revising the procedure and the composition of the committee which deals with harassment complaints. “Victims will not be better supported with these changes,” MeTooEP said.\nWhat’s next? Parliament President Roberta Metsola, who had asked for the proposals in January, will discuss the measures with the Bureau on July 10. Both the MeTooEP movement and the more progressive political groups are set to lobby hard for more far-reaching changes to protect alleged victims.\n**It’s tomorrow!

Also the agenda, though, is a discussion of relations with Latin America and the Caribbean ahead of next month’s EU-CELAC summit. Here’s what else could come up …\nPoland is under mounting scrutiny over its stance on gender-related issues, with Warsaw effectively blocking some development files in the realm of EU foreign policy. It has questioned the use of certain language, insisting on a more binary definition of gender.\nAlarm over Kosovo: Ministers will also be briefed by EU High Representative Josep Borrell on the stalled Pristina-Belgrade dialogue, after talks with Kosovo’s Prime Minister Albin Kurti and Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić in Brussels Thursday ended without agreement. Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon told my colleague Jacopo: “We are very concerned with the situation not only in Kosovo, but in the entire Western Balkans … Our urgent priority is de-escalation and we also call for new elections.” Background to all this here.\nMore qualified majority voting, please: Despite Europe’s ability to unify behind policies, Fajon said everyone wants to see a more efficient and effective EU. “That is why I welcome the reflection at European and national level” on more qualified majority voting in foreign and security policy, she told Jacopo. “As MEP, I’ve listened to citizens calling for it as well.”\nBELGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER UNDER FIRE — COALITION THREATENED: Belgian lawmakers will today grill federal Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib — and she could be in a fair bit of trouble. Some of her coalition partners expect an apology over how she handled an Iranian delegation who attended a summit in Brussels earlier this month — if that’s not forthcoming, it would risk consequences beyond her own possible resignation, Barbara Moens writes in to report. “Lahbib’s survival is a question of the government’s survival,” said a Belgian official.\nWhy should EU care? Lahbib, as foreign minister, EU minister and trade minister, is key for the Belgian presidency of the Council of the EU in the first half of 2024. Preparing a new minister for chairing that wide range of Council meetings in just a few months is a scenario Belgian diplomats are hoping to avoid — although some joke that they’ve seen worse. When Belgium last held the Council presidency in 2010, it didn’t even have an official government. Read more on the Belgian government crisis here by Barbara and Camille Gijs.\n**Last call!

Belgium is gearing up to helm the presidency of the Council of the EU next January and a draft version of the presidency events — which you can see here — details the delicate balance Belgian officials are hoping to reach to represent the regions of the country equally, Camille Gijs and Mathieu Pollet write in to report.\nCouncil meetings are set to take place in Namur, Mons, La Hulpe, Louvain-la-Neuve, Genk, Ghent, Bruges and in the Limburg province. Don’t worry, some will be in Brussels, too.\nHappening Tuesday: Spain, Belgium and Hungary — who together form a presidency “trio” — have prepared a joint draft program, which will be presented at the General Affairs Council Tuesday. More on that here.\nWIN FOR THE FOREIGN DRIVERS IN BELGIUM: Romanian driver Stefan Popescu, who worked for around €300 per month under a Romanian contract for an international company based in Belgium, will get salary arrears to match the Belgian wages he should have been paid, Hasselt Labor Court ruled on Friday.\nWhy this matters: Many foreign drivers in Belgium, mainly from Eastern Europe, are in the same situation. “This judgment opens the road to thousands of foreigners active on Belgian roads, but who have a contract in their country of origin and therefore a lower salary. This decision may allow them to go to a Belgian court in the future to claim their legitimate salaries,” said Koen Ryckenboer from the CSC-Transcom labor union.\nNO TAYLOR SWIFT FOR YOU: Pop star Taylor Swift recently announced Europe dates for her Eras tour in 2024 — but Brussels isn’t on the list due to noise pollution concerns. “The stage had to be on the short side and that is not possible in Brussels because of noise pollution for the neighbourhood,” said Swift’s concert organizer. Given the potential inflationary impact, it might be for the best.\nCALLING ALL FOOTBALL FANS: FC Irlande — the largest expat football club in Brussels — is recruiting experienced players for their three women’s teams.
