We salute the schools, coaches and administrators who continue to champion education as a core part of the student athlete experience.”\nNCAA Walter Byers Scholarship\nOle Miss Baseball pitcher Mason Nichols was named one of only two recipients of the 2025 Walter Byers Graduate Scholarship.\nNichols has now been awarded the highest academic honor by the UM and the NCAA.
