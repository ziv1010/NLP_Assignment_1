  "body_text": "In Emma Hayes’ final season, Chelsea won’t be lifting a domestic cup for the first time since 2020. But the chase for silverware is far from over, with the Blues still firmly in the title race for the Women’s Super League.\nChelsea FCW vs. Aston Villa WFC, Women’s Super League: Preview, team news, how to watch\nGot to get up for it again\nA bit of a pick-me-up after back-to-back cup defeats would be more than welcome. Aston Villa, against whom we have a perfect record, could be just what the doctor ordered.\nDate / Time: Wednesday, April 17, 2024, 19.00 GMT; 2pm EDT; 12:30am IST (next day)\nVenue: Kingsmeadow, Kingston upon Thames, UK\nReferee: Mel Burgin\nForecast: Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze\nOn TV: Sky Sports (UK); none (USA); elsewhere\nStreaming: Sky GO (UK); none (USA)\nChelsea team news: As manager Emma Hayes said in her post-match reaction to the 2-1 loss to Manchester United in the FA Cup semifinal, we have no choice but to get over the bad result. This match should be a very good way to begin doing so, even if the UEFA Women’s Champions League semifinal first leg clash against Barcelona this Saturday will likely force some rotation to save the squad’s best options for the weekend.\nWe still can’t count on defenders Aniek Nouwen and Maren Mjelde, nor on strikers Mia Fishel and Sam Kerr due to their respective injuries. While captain Millie Bright did return to team training last week, the boss didn’t give an exact timeline on her return.\nAston Villa team news: The Villans have been firmly mid-table this season: 20 points in 18 matches thus far guarantees them another season at the top of women’s football pyramid in England, all thanks to Bristol City managing just six points in the same amount of games.\nGiven this scenario, there isn’t much for Villa to fight for in the four remaining matches of the season but their own pride. But that alone could be enough motivation for them to get their first ever win against us.\nDue to fitness issues, manager Carla Ward won’t be able to call upon the talents of goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar, defender Lucy Parker, midfielder Lucy Staniforth, and attacker Kirsty Hanson. However Adriana Leon, who scored both of Canada’s goals in regular time against the USWNT in the SheBelieves Cup final, should be good to go, as should fellow forward Rachel Daly.\nPreviously: Six goals from six different players, and a clean sheet on Aston Villa’s turf.",
