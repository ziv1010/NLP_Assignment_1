  "body_text": "The season begins today! Some of yous have given your season prediction in the Sept 2 thread which was great. What will be the biggest key for your prediction to come true? I would say the play of JJ McCarthy is likely the #1 factor for most predictions. I think injury is going to play a role and the depth will be put to the test at some point this season. Which position group are you least comfortable with the depth? I have to go with cornerback.\nMinnesota Vikings News and Links: And We’re off!\nMinnesota Vikings News and Links\nNo 1. How will J.J. McCarthy handle the moment?\n“As we know, it’s gonna be a big moment for him,” O’Connell told KFAN’s Paul Allen this week. “We want to basically surround him with the best guys we can in the huddle. We feel like we’ve done that. We feel like the other side of the ball’s gonna play good football defensively for us, as well as in the kicking game. And then it’s just gonna come down to a lot of really boring things. It’s gonna come down to footwork and his comfort in doing the things that he’s done a lot now on the practice field and throughout this offseason.”\nNo 2. Does Ben Johnson really have Brian Flores’ number?\nIn the four meetings between the Vikings and Lions since Brian Flores was hired as Minnesota’s defensive coordinator two years ago, Detroit scored 30, 30, 31, and 31 points in four victories. The Lions recorded 389, 381, 391, and 394 yards in those games. That’s remarkable consistency. Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jahmyr Gibbs, and the rest of the Lions’ offense shredded the Vikings’ defense in those meetings. Johnson, of course, was Detroit’s coordinator.\nThe question is how much of that success was predicated on Johnson out-scheming Flores and how much of it had to do with the execution by the players on a Lions team that went 27-7 overall during those two seasons. Can Johnson have the same success with Caleb Williams and the Bears’ other offensive pieces that he had in Detroit? Will Flores have any schematic adjustments up his sleeve, especially now that he has Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave in the middle of his defensive line?\nNo 3. Will a few key players suit up?\nBoth teams are dealing with some injury question marks to key players heading into this game. The big one for the Vikings is left tackle Christian Darrisaw, who is less than 11 months removed from a major knee injury and sounds like a potential game-time decision on Monday. If he can’t play, backup Justin Skule would be out there, which would be a significant blow to the Vikings’ offense. Safety Harrison Smith’s status is also up in the air, which is another one to watch.\nEstablish the Run\nProtect J.J. McCarthy\nFeed T.J. Hockenson\nLast year, Williams had maybe his best game as a rookie when the Vikings came to Soldier Field. He completed 32 of 47 passes for 340 yards and two touchdowns, although the Vikings won in overtime, 30-27.\n…\nWinning interior matchups in the pass game\nAlthough the Vikings had one of the best defenses in football last year, they had to manufacture ways to generate pressure from the interior line. They used linebacker Jihad Ward in passing situations and leaned heavily on blitzes.\nUnfortunately, this formula was exposed when the Vikings faced the Lions last year. Johnson exploited vacated zones in the middle of the Vikings’ defense. With no viable counterpunch from his interior defensive linemen, Flores went down swinging with the blitz in a 31-9 loss in Week 18.\nChristian Darrisaw has done everything right in his rehab process from last year’s major knee injury, giving himself a real chance to play in Week 1. However, that decision hasn’t been made yet, head coach Kevin O’Connell said on Wednesday.\n“He had a great camp, checked every box from a workload standpoint, building into this week,” O’Connell said. “He’ll practice today. Always, with CD, just with how committed he’s been to taking the daily approach, we’ve done the same with him. We’re gonna progress forward and be smart, but we’re gonna give him every opportunity to practice and then see how he feels, and ultimately, in regards to his availability, we’ll make that decision as the week progresses.”\n…\n“He looks really good,” O’Connell said. “I think he surprised even himself early on in training camp, as we began that crafted plan by Tyler (Williams) and the doctors and Christian himself. He’s had some really good progression days where we’ve been able to stack it up. And we’re in game week now. He’s gonna take a lot of reps today, if not all of them, and then we’ll see how he feels.”\n…\n“Ultimately, Christian’s such an important player to our team that we want to make sure we’re smart about the plan, but also, I think he’s earned the right to, by all the things he’s done — there’s no reason to make the decision for any other reason than what’s best for CD, and he’s gonna be heavily involved in that,” O’Connell said.\n“Knowing we’ve got 17 games, including a short week next week, and then ultimately our trip overseas. There’s gotta be a big picture mindset to a player of Christian’s caliber. All that matters is this game to the Minnesota Vikings, Monday night in Chicago, but our jobs are to make sure we’re doing what’s best for the team for the greater duration of 17-plus games. And what that means for Monday night I don’t know as of right now. I just know what my eyes have shown me, what Christian’s demonstrated has given us, through a really calculated plan, a good possibility of (him playing) on Monday night.”\nOne of the other notable Vikings injury situations to watch this week pertains to safety Harrison Smith, who is recovering from a “personal health matter.” Smith is back at the Vikings’ facility and participated in Wednesday’s walkthrough, but he won’t practice.\n“The hope is we can ramp him up,” O’Connell said. “He’s back in the building in meetings and building up his workload for the week, so we’ll see where he’s at throughout the remainder of the week.”\nAccording to the Minnesota Star Tribune’s Ben Goessling, Jefferson’s hamstring injury isn’t expected to impact his play, but he could require “long-term maintenance” on his hamstring in practice as a precaution.\n“This is going to be a long-term maintenance thing. He’s had enough hamstring [issues] at this point… He practices hard, he does not like to miss practice, I wonder if they would mitigate any of that,” Goessling said on KFAN radio on September 2. “Hamstrings seem like a consistent enough issue for him that I think they are going to treat it with quite a bit of attention.”\n…\nJefferson missed seven games with a right hamstring injury during the 2023 season and revealed that the way he plays could put more stress on his body.\nWhen Jefferson exited the second day of training camp with a hamstring injury, head coach Kevin O’Connell described it as a “very mild” strain.\nThat was July 25.\n…\n“I’m different from a lot of other people,” Jefferson said on August 18.”The way I move, the way my body is positioned, the way I cut and the way I do everything is kind of different than what everyone else does. Different positions I might put a little bit more stress on my body than a normal typical person would.”\nSoldier Field, the aging home of the Bears, played host to five consecutive concerts over Labor Day weekend, culminating with System of a Down and Avenged Sevenfold performing both Sunday and Monday. The Lumineers were the main event Saturday, while My Chemical Romance headlined Friday and Oasis performed in front of 52,000 fans Thursday.\n…\nThe issue before last year’s preseason opener may have been due to the sod being laid less than a week before the game. Bears kicker Cairo Santo told reporters that the playing surface “was just a little loose” but he though the conditions would “be amazing by Week 1.”\nIn other words, Santo thought the fresh sod needed some time to reach ideal playing surface status. If that’s true, then the Vikings would be wise to prepare for some less than perfect field conditions Monday night by wearing 7-stud cleats. Regardless, O’Connell doesn’t sound worried.\n“This is professional football so our anticipation is the surface is going to be good enough to play on. But I would say this, at some point, the guys in purple and white aren’t going to be the only ones playing on the surface so we’ve gotta do our best to establish, through a lot of different people, once we’ve arrived, once we’ve had a chance to step foot, gotta have our players prepared to play on whatever the surface is,” O’Connell told KFAN-FM 100.3’s Paul Allen on Tuesday.\n“And truly, Monday Night Football, NFC North, if they want to clear out some space in the parking lot, we can play out there too. At this point, I would say that is not incredibly high on my priority list.”\nHowever, O’Connell did acknowledge that field conditions have been a pest in the past, and he was clearly hinting at Green Bay’s Lambeau Field, where Vikings players were slipping like crazy in a loss to the Packers on New Year’s Day during his first season as head coach.\n“We’ve seen at another location here in the NFC North that happens to have grass and a unique climate, we’ve seen that surface play a major role before. We want to make sure that we’re doing our part to prepare our players. It’s something I will talk about with the guys. We’ll have the equipment available and we’ll go play football,” O’Connell said.\nBut the player who embodies what the Vikings want to be this season more than any other? It might be the mountain of a man former All-Pro center Olin Kreutz called “a monster.” It might be Will Fries.\nThe Colts are in the pistol formation. Quarterback Gardner Minshew receives the snap, then hands the ball off to running back Zack Moss. Fries’ task? Lurch and grab the position of Titans defensive tackle Teair Tart.\nFries lunges and grabs Tart’s upper body. Tart tries to escape Fries’ grasp. Fries moves with him, maintaining control and pushing Tart up the field. Moss is in the defense’s grasp at this point, but Fries doesn’t care. He shifts from blocking vertically to simply punishing Tart, pushing him into the turf. After being splayed out on his back, Tart stands up and asks for a flag from the referee. It’s not coming. Everything Fries executed was legal.\nThese types of finishes from Fries — against those types of defenders — earned the Vikings’ attention. As much as anything else, the aggression Fries plays with is why he was made one of the highest-paid right guards in the NFL. To underscore the point, nasty was necessary.\nHours before Monday’s game between the Minnesota Vikings and the Chicago Bears, quarterback J.J. McCarthy will sit beneath one of the goalposts and close his eyes. He’ll cross his legs. He’ll focus on his breath. His meditation will be underway.\nIt’s about putting aside the pressures of a first NFL start, stalled in part by a meniscus injury and two surgeries.\n…\n“People make it up to be this complex thing where you’ve got to go meditate in the mountains in Tibet for two weeks to really get something done,” McCarthy told me during a press conference at Vikings training camp. “But no, it’s just about being present and just focusing on what’s in front of you, your breath, whatever it may be.”\n…\nIt feels like his meditation might palliate a perfectionism that eats away at him. He’s a guy who wants to eke out every yard, every rep, every bit of value. It’s what got him on the field as the Vikings’ QB1 at age 22.\n“That’s kind of the psycho in me,” McCarthy said during camp. “When a player catches a 20-yard high-cross and I’m like, ‘Could have been 30.’ … Good or bad, focus on the next play and kick it in the teeth.”\n…\nIt’s hard to say exactly how much a quarterback’s circumstances dictate the outcome of his career. It’s easy to say that the circumstances matter. Minnesota’s defense might make life difficult in practice, but the unit helped lead the Vikings to a 14-win season in 2024. O’Connell’s coaching staff is one of the top three in the league. Jefferson is one of the league’s top two receivers. Aaron Jones is one of the best running backs. And though there’s no guarantee the offensive line will improve, the Vikings made two key changes — signing center Ryan Kelly and drafting guard Donovan Jackson in Round 1 — with the intention of making the unit one of the league’s best.\nThis situation is too good to mess up.\nRight?\n…\nMcCarthy took his first loss as a starting quarterback in high school, and afterward, a young girl waited in line for an autograph.\nWhy are you so mad out there? she asked him. You need to smile more.\nHe explained that it was a bad game for him, and she responded by taking back the Sharpie and drawing a smiley face on McCarthy’s hand.\n“It was such a profound moment for how simple it was. I just wore it on my hand for the rest of the games because I took that message to heart, and we went undefeated from there,” McCarthy said back in 2022.\nThat doesn’t mean the game hasn’t hurt him. It has, badly. Just take a look at the photo of McCarthy standing on the field after TCU beat Michigan in the 2022 Fiesta Bowl.\nMcCarthy, then a 19-year-old sophomore, finished that game with 343 passing yards, three touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) and two interceptions. And he clearly agonized over that defeat. In the photo, you can see that the confetti has settled on the turf. The TCU mob has condensed. The emotions have settled. The celebration is clearly wrapping up. And there is McCarthy, with his hands behind his back — studying the victors.\n“It gives you chills, because if you know him, you know he’s standing there absorbing that, going, ‘That will be me next year and I will not be standing here. Next year, I will be underneath blue and yellow confetti celebrating a national championship,’” said Greg Holcomb, who has been McCarthy’s private quarterback coach since McCarthy was in seventh grade.\n“And sure enough, he did it.”\n…\nThere are other questions that McCarthy has faced over this offseason of ascent. Some of them stem from the pre-draft process, when the QB’s arm paled in comparison to his draft-class peers, Caleb Williams and Drake Maye. And to be fair, that’s true for most NFL quarterbacks. But it’s a question McCarthy answered nonetheless.\n“That’s a great question,” McCarthy said. “I would say, you know, a lot of it just comes with the stigma of playing at Michigan, and not throwing the ball a lot. But at the same time, it could be my frame. They don’t see a 6-5, 240 guy, so how can he throw 61 miles per hour at the combine? But at the end of the day, it’s gonna show up, and the people who know, know.”\n“That’s why I think he kind of smiles and laughs, because he’s like, ‘Wait till you guys see what I have coming?’” Holcomb said. “It’s that, like, ‘Don’t worry about it. I got something for you.’”\nMcCarthy might be smiling. He might seem chill. But don’t let it fool you. There’s the “pyscho” in him, like he himself said. Former Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh called McCarthy a “killer.” Whatever that quality is, it will serve him well in 2025, because doubt will come. The haters are ready. Minnesota hasn’t lost a game yet. McCarthy hasn’t thrown an interception. But given all the adversity the Vikings have faced in getting their starters on the field, it’s distinctly possible that Minnesota (and McCarthy) won’t get off to the hot start that everyone expects.\n“He’s going to have some bad games, he’s going to make some bad throws, he’s going to have some picks,” Holcomb said. “There’s going to be people that are going to be doubting him and all that stuff. And I just don’t think any of that’s going to get to him, and he’s just going to thrive through all of that.”\nIt’s important McCarthy knows what to do with doubt. It’s coming.\n…\nWhen a college quarterback transfers into a new program, it’s not customary for the incumbent starter to reach out, let alone welcome the newcomer. Because — speaking of doubt — a newcomer can spell problems for the returners in the QB room.\nBut McCarthy isn’t a man of custom. He’s his own man. And so when Tuttle transferred from Indiana to Michigan in 2023, he was stunned to see a text from McCarthy.\n“A lot of people are awkward about that,” Tuttle said. “There’s only one quarterback on the field, right? So there can be some tension at times, and it can be weird. But the first person to reach out to me was J.J. McCarthy. It was like, ‘Welcome. Can’t wait to have you. Excited to meet you.’”\nKeep in mind, McCarthy was 19 years old. He had just lost to TCU. He was a year away from winning the national championship and the Big Ten Quarterback of the Year award. This isn’t to say Tuttle was in an open QB competition with McCarthy, but it was a powerful gesture nonetheless. McCarthy eventually doubled down. When Tuttle showed up for practices, McCarthy went over to his backup QB in the middle of drills.\n“Dude, you’re really throwing the ball well,” McCarthy said to Tuttle. “You look great. I’m loving that you’re on this team. You look great right now. I know Coach Harbaugh is happy you’re here. I’m just stoked. I just wanted to tell you that.”\nWow, Tuttle thought to himself. No other quarterback has ever said that to me.\n…\nMcCarthy might face questions about his measurable qualities, but he won’t face them about who he is as a person. He has the personal skills, worth ethic and mentality to take charge of an NFL locker room.\n“People with ADHD, they find calm in the chaos and chaos in the calm,” said McCarthy, who was diagnosed with the disorder. “I’ve always felt, ever since I was a kid, just any competitive environment I was in, I felt like I was at home. Playing at Michigan, there’s 110,000 [fans in the stands] and you’re at one of the most prominent universities out there. That’s where I feel most comfortable — when the lights are the brightest, the stage is the biggest stage out there.\n“And I know it’s going to be a lot more of that to come.”\n…\n“He has a mentality to become great in the league,” tight end T.J. Hockenson said.\n“He was a national champion, so I feel like that says everything about him,” Addison said.\n“He wants to be great, and he’s hungry,” Aaron Jones said on NFL Network.\nHis energy is “infectious,” tackle Brian O’Neill said.\nYou hear superlatives like this all the time when teammates talk about their young QB.\nOnly McCarthy can prove it all true.\nJ.J. McCarthy throws for 3,600 yards, runs for 400\nJordan Mason runs for double-digit touchdowns\nJordan Addison gets to 1,000 yards despite suspension\nJonathan Greenard has a 17-sack season\n3 Vikings will register 10 plus sacks\nCornerback won’t be a problem if the room stays healthy\nVikings’ run defense will finish top 10\nWill Ragatz: 11-6\nThere are a couple things I’m confident in. One is that, in Kevin O’Connell and Brian Flores, the Vikings have at least a top-three coaching duo in the league. Those two are experienced and innovative and very good at leading a football team to success. Another is that, quarterbacks aside, the Vikings have at least a top-five roster in the league. The weapons are incredible, led by the best wide receiver on the planet, and the offensive line has been upgraded massively. The defense was the league’s second-best last year and is now improved on paper with the addition of two star pass-rushing defensive tackles. What that means is J.J. McCarthy simply has to steer the ship, take care of the football, and let his natural playmaking ability show up when needed. I think he’ll do just that, even if there may be some ups and downs in the first half of the campaign.\nJoe Nelson: 14-3\nTony Liebert: 11-6\nJonathan Harrison: 12-5\nWhy isn’t he picking Minnesota to make the playoffs for the third time in four years under head coach Kevin O’Connell? He gave two main reasons:\nNo 1. Can’t maintain winning rate in one-score games\nNo 2. Defense won’t force as many turnovers\nBarnwell suspects 22-year-old quarterback J.J. McCarthy will give the Vikings similar production to what they received in recent seasons with Sam Darnold and Kirk Cousins under center, but his instinct is that “a defensive decline and a less fortunate year in one-score contests push the Vikings back toward the middle of the NFC pack.”\n…\n“A thrilling defense led the league in turnovers, as the Vikings jumped from 19th in turnover rate to second. That’s difficult to sustain, especially with the Vikings turning over a chunk of their secondary,” Barnwell wrote.\nThe Vikings let cornerbacks Stephon Gilmore and Shaq Griffin enter free agency, while Cam Bynum signed a free-agent contract with the Indianapolis Colts. Gilmore is still a free agent and Griffin was cut by the Seahawks before re-signing to Seattle’s practice squad. That opened the door for Minnesota to reload in the secondary with Harrison Smith and Josh Metellus returning at safety, while Theo Jackson got promoted to Bynum’s role. The top cornerbacks are 2024 Pro Bowler Byron Murphy Jr. and newcomers Isaiah Rodgers and Jeff Okudah.\nAnthony Barr tends to leave things better than he found them.\nWhether impacting the Twin Cities community or making play after play on the football field, Barr made his presence felt in all the right ways during his nine seasons as a Vikings linebacker.\nNow, he’s back where it all started to write the end of that chapter.\n“It’s important for me to retire as a Viking because I am a Viking,” Barr recently told me.\nIt’s only fitting that as he stepped up to the Vikings media center podium for the final time, Barr quietly took in a room full of not only reporters but also members of the Social Impact team, coaches, personnel staff and, most importantly, former teammates.\nAn emotional Barr was grateful to see Andrew Sendejo, Audie Cole and Eric Kendricks there to celebrate their brother’s impact on the organization and community. Vikings Legend Scott Studwell also attended the press conference, and Chad Greenway made an earlier appearance to express his congratulations.\nKendricks provided opening remarks, during which he shared quite the ice breaker of an anecdote from a Vikings game in London (more on that later), and introduced Barr, whom he truly considers a “brother from another mother.”\n“It’s really good to be back here,” Barr said. “It’s important to me to retire as a Viking because the community means so much, the franchise means so much. It’s a franchise that changed my life, coming here in May 2014 as, really, a young boy trying to find his way playing a game he’s loved his whole life — and got a chance to showcase his talents here.”\nHe later recalled (with a few chuckles) his first visit to Minnesota leading up to the draft.\n“I was coming from California, I was in my T-shirt and my shorts, and I got off the plane and it’s snowing. I’m like, ‘Oh, [dang],’ ” he laughed. “This place is different. Hopefully we don’t come here, because I’m not trying to deal with the snow in April. Six weeks later, they called.\n“But it ended up working out,” Barr added with a smile. “Now I actually love the snow more than I do the heat, so that’s kind of changed, being a Cali boy. Now I’m, like, full Minnesota.”\n…\nHe was a special athlete. But more than that, he was a special teammate, a special friend. A special person.\n“A.B. is always gonna be A.B. And that’s what you love about him,” Eric Wilson said.\n…\nHarrison Smith, whose Vikings tenure overlapped Barr’s entire career in Purple, called him the smartest teammate Smith’s encountered over 14 seasons.\nHigh praise coming from The Hitman himself.\nSmith quipped he didn’t immediately recognize Barr’s smarts because “he didn’t talk for, like, six months.”\n“He didn’t talk to anybody for a while, but he was just getting the lay of the land,” Smith said.\nExactly that.\n“I’m a very naturally observant person,” Barr said. “I see everything, and I take note on a lot of things I might not vocalize.”\n…\nHe then was drafted by the Vikings and defensive-minded Mike Zimmer.\n“Zim’s very, very smart and can talk football at a high level,” Barr said. “Being under his wing, and being coached by his son Adam, who definitely learned from Mike at a young age and grew up in a football house — their knowledge, being able to observe and absorb all of what we discussed and what they asked for.\n“I didn’t have a whole lot of bad habits coming out of college, because I was so new to the position,” he added, “so I could just take coaching and do exactly what they were looking for. It ended up being helpful for me and for the team.”\nBarr started all 12 games he played his rookie season, and he was entrusted going into his second year with “green dot” duties that previously were held by Greenway. He excelled in the role, efficiently and smoothly conveying calls to the defense. Even in moments of miscommunication or misunderstanding through the headset, Barr’s shared wavelength with Zimmer — and composure in high-stress moments — allowed him to seamlessly relay the correct information.\n“He knew what Zim’ was calling even before he called it,” Smith said.\nNo matter the situation, Barr didn’t seem fazed.\n“I never felt overwhelmed,” he said. “You know, it’s football. You just have to adapt and adjust on the fly … and that was something I enjoyed a lot and took a lot of pride in.”\n…\nEven before you saw Barr, you’d know he was coming.\n“This guy whistles everywhere he goes. He’s just a whistler. He’s a whistling guy,” Kendricks laughed. “Everybody knows him for the whistles everywhere he goes. The more you’re around him when he’s whistling, the more you start to try to whistle like him, but you can’t really do it.”\nCalm in every situation. Strong communicator. Situationally aware.\n“I just don’t think people understand how smart of a football player he is,” said Kendricks, who later assumed green dot duties himself. “That rubbed off on me every year I was with him. I truly became a better football player mentally because of him.”\n…\nBeyond Barr’s brain is his brawn, of course.\n“He was just such a beast,” Greenway described. “The size, the height, the speed. I mean, he just had everything. He was so impressive.\n“It was motivating to me to see this young kid, so excited to be here, such a freak athlete, making crazy plays,” Greenway added. “It leveled up my ability to keep playing as a 31, 32-year-old. He was big enough to be so physical inside the box, taking on running backs and linemen, but then also fast enough to cover guys. I mean, he was literally just a freak.”\nA linebacker packaged in a defensive end’s body, with the hands of a receiver and speed of a running back?\nOffenses, beware.\nAaron Jones, Sr., knows all-too well the difficulty of playing against Barr, as the two faced off within the NFC North on multiple occasions.\nJones, who played for the Packers from 2017-23 before joining the Vikings last offseason, noted he “hated” playing against Barr because he knew just how much he’d be challenged.\n“His size, his speed, playing where he did, you don’t see that often; I feel like most of the time those guys have their hand in the dirt,” Jones said. “So, his ability to be able to do that, cover the backside of the backfield, drop into zone, it’s tremendous.\n“When he’s coming, all right, you’re getting another pass rusher running at you — and that’s not the easiest thing,” Jones quipped. “There’s a difference between linebackers and DBs rushing you versus outside linebackers and d-linemen. They use their hands, they have different techniques, and Barr had that in his game.\n“He made it hard to step up in the A or B gap and block,” he added. “Especially if the gaps are wide open and it’s mano y mano? Buckle up. He’s either gonna give you a move or he’s gonna drive you right back to the quarterback.”\n…\n“He’s very unique in the way he was physically built and mentally capable, and he was a smooth athlete, too,” Smith said. “A lot of guys are really powerful and strong and fast, but he was — you could tell he played a lot of sports, just nimble on his feet. A.B. could move in ways you wouldn’t think he should be able to move.”\n…\nEven in Barr’s pregame rituals, he gave it all. Quite literally.\nSome players listen to a specific song. Some pray. Some (ahem, Harrison Smith) throw back a shot of hot sauce. And Barr? Well, Barr vomited.\nBefore every single game. Like clockwork.\nHe didn’t have to make himself, he assured, but it just always happened. Usually into a towel on the bench.\n“I kind of liked to experience it,” Smith laughed. “I would go sit next to him. It was just his thing, so I’d get near him. He was getting amped up for the game.”\nAdded Kendricks: “Guys are quirky, they have rituals. We would all be waiting for that puke to make ourselves feel better about our routine, because it was part of our routine now.”\nAnd then there was the time in London when Kendricks came running out before the game and grabbed a towel off the ground to wipe his face — not realizing it was the towel.\n“I just remember tasting and smelling orange peel. And, like, little pieces of orange pulp were on my face as I ran out to play defense,” Kendricks recalled with a laugh, clearly no worse for wear.\n“Yeahhh, I felt bad about that,” Barr says now. “But I mean, he probably should have known better.”\n…\nBarr’s physical, mental and emotional commitment to the Vikings and to the game he loves were undeniable.\nAnd yet, arguably the most significant legacy Barr established — and continues to foster — hasn’t happened anywhere near the football field.\nDuring Barr’s second season in Minnesota, he and his mom Lori launched Raise the Barr, a nonprofit aimed at helping single-parent families break the cycle of poverty by providing access to post-secondary education, tuition and childcare scholarships.\nRaise the Barr has supported single parents and their children in Southern California (Lori and Anthony’s home region) and the Twin Cities over the past nine-plus years. Barr also grew deeply connected as a Viking to Jeremiah Program, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit with a mission that beautifully aligns with Raise the Barr.\nBarr connected with countless single mothers and their young ones during fundraiser events, holiday gatherings and humble visits to the center to play with and read books to youth.\nLibby Sanders’ family has been tremendously impacted by Jeremiah Program and Barr’s involvement. Libby is a single mother of two (Landon and Dominic) who graduated from Jeremiah Program in 2015 with a degree in human services. After working in elementary schools and juvenile correction reform, Libby returned to school and earned a second degree while participating in JP’s Alumni Fellowship. She now works as a social worker in OB/GYN and supports many pregnant women whose experiences mirror her own.\nReflecting on her experience with Jeremiah Program, where she currently also facilitates Empowerment and Leadership classes, Libby shared how much Barr’s commitment has meant to her and her family.\n“Having an NFL player like Anthony invest in single moms the way he does honors the women who stepped into motherhood in a society that often negatively regards single mothers,” Libby said. “Anthony’s work aligns with Jeremiah’s core beliefs that we are all lovable, valuable and important.\n“It makes our dreams feel even more possible,” she added. “Not only for us as moms, but in my situation, also for my sons.”\nLibby recalled the first time she met Barr in 2017, noting, “What stood out to me was how everyone was there to see him, but he was there to see us.”\nLandon, now 15, will likewise never forget that first interaction.\n“I remember he was very kind and selfless. His presence felt really warm, kind of like a teacher, but he was very big. His looks didn’t match his personality,” Landon described. “It was really fun because he was there to do fancy stuff with the adults, but he ended up playing football in the hallway with me.”\nIn words wise beyond his years, Landon emphasized how grateful he is that Barr has kept in touch with Jeremiah Program families from afar.\n“It’s really thoughtful, being able to stay connected to someone or somewhere you love even if you don’t live there anymore … like a long-distance relationship,” Landon reflected. “It feels like he can relate to me, knowing we’ve had a similar experience growing up.\n“Now I just hope I can continue to have the same experience he’s had, do what I love and connect with people I care about,” added Landon, who started playing linebacker because of Barr and now starts at the position. “I want to be a role model to them like Anthony has been a role model to me.”\nFor Barr, the Vikings Community Man of the Year in 2021, that’s what it’s all about.\nHe hasn’t forgotten where he’s come from or the community that helped him grow up in a loving, stable home while Lori completed her education and established a foundation for her family.\nHe understands consistency is key. For Barr, it’s all about establishing connection and trust.\n“I think that’s where the success comes into play,” he said. “You can give anybody $5, but if they don’t know what to do with the $5, then it’s not very impactful. So we try to build that community and build a network for our families so that they don’t feel like they’re going through this unknown aspect of life alone.”\nThose touched by Barr’s work through Raise the Barr or Jeremiah Program are forever affected by his genuine heart for making a difference.\n“My boys have grown up watching people they consider their friends play in the NFL; they get to wear their jerseys and have these beautiful core memories. That builds confidence. The day they played catch in the hall, Landon actually gave Anthony his signature,” Libby said. “My boys don’t see him as an idol; they see him as a role model, and that is something that will stick with them for the rest of their lives.”\nAs Barr reflects over his NFL career, it’s only fitting he returns to a place that became a home to officially hang up his cleats.\n“I’m really proud of my career and so thankful for the moments and opportunities I was granted by the Wilf family — some of the best owners in sports — and by the coaches and [former Vikings GM] Rick Spielman just giving me the opportunity to play,” Barr said. “And then all my teammates for supporting me. I don’t think they realized how impactful they were on my life. Observing some of the amazing pros that I was able to watch at a young age, whether it’s Linval [Joseph] or B-Rob (Brian Robison) or Everson [Griffen], ‘Zay’ (Rhodes), Dejo, Harry, E.K. … being good people, good humans, but just being amazing teammates and being guys that I loved going to work with. Guys I would put my life on the line for.\n“This is the team that gave me an opportunity. They let me come in and be my authentic self, while also expecting and demanding a lot from me,” he said. “It was a two-way street, and I think, for the most part, I held up my end of the bargain; and they did as a franchise, as well.”\nAs Barr continues making positive differences, and transitions to whatever adventures life next holds for him, one thing is certain:\nHe’s a Minnesota Viking for life.\n“He just is. He’s a Viking,” Smith said, shrugging. “It’s the only place for him.”\nKendricks added: “He deserves his flowers. He put a lot of work in with the organization, he was a leader of so many great defenses, and it’s a great story. It’s only right. It’s how it’s supposed to be.”\n11 NFL teams employ male cheerleaders for the 2025 season:\nTeam : Male cheerleaders : Year introduced\nRavens : 19* : 1998\nSaints : 12 : 2018\nBuccaneers : 9 : 2019\nCommanders : 9 : 2021\nRams : 7 : 2018\nTitans : 5 : 2019\nSeahawks : 3 : 2019\nEagles : 3 : 2019\nVikings : 2 : 2025\nPatriots : 1 : 2019\n49ers : 1 : 2023\n* — Only stunt men.\nAgain, we all know the rules, but in case someone is new:\n- No discussion of politics or religion\n- No feeding of the trolls\n- Leave the gender hatred at the door\n- Keep the bad language to a minimum (using the spoiler tags, if you must)\n- Speaking of which, if discussing a newer show or movie, please use spoiler tags\n- No pictures that could get someone fired or in serious trouble with their employer\n- If you can’t disagree in a civil manner, feel free to go away\n- While navigating the open thread, just assume it’s sarcasm",
