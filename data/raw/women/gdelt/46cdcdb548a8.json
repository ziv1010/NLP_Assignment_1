On Feb 13, coverage includes: the deaths of two Nigerians fighting for Russia in Ukraine amid growing concern over foreign recruitment, DRC accepting the principle of a ceasefire as mediators push to halt fighting in the east, and more.\nEvery day, OkayAfrica shares a roundup of news we’re following but haven’t published as full articles. These short updates cover what’s happening on the continent — in culture, politics, and beyond. For more on stories like these, be sure to check out our News page, with stories from across the regions.\nTwo Nigerians Killed Fighting for Russia as Scrutiny Grows Over Foreign Recruitment\nThe bodies of two Nigerians fighting for Russia have been found in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian authorities say. Hamzat Kazeen Kolawole and Mbah Stephen Udoka were serving in Russia’s 423rd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment and were killed in late November during an attempted assault in the Luhansk region, according to Ukraine’s military intelligence. Both men signed contracts with the Russian army in the second half of 2025 and received no military training. Kolawole is survived by a wife and three children. Ukrainian officials said the two were killed by a drone strike before engaging in a firefight.\nTheir deaths come as Russia faces growing accusations of recruiting foreign nationals under false promises of well-paid civilian jobs. Investigations and videos circulating online have drawn attention to Africans being sent to the front lines, including Ugandans and others reportedly lured with job offers in Russia or elsewhere. Uganda has uncovered recruitment networks targeting veterans, with some recruits intercepted while trying to travel and others confirmed dead in Ukraine. Survivors have described being forced to sign military contracts at gunpoint, while rights groups and journalists warn that many more Africans may have died fighting in a war they never intended to join.\nDRC Accepts Ceasefire Principle as Mediators Push to Halt Eastern Fighting\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo said today, Friday, February 13, it has accepted the principle of a ceasefire in the east, calling for a strict and immediate freeze of positions in its conflict with the Rwanda-backed M23. Kinshasa did not give a start date, but the move follows a call by Angola for both sides to respect a ceasefire beginning February 18. The announcement comes after renewed mediation efforts and as the UN prepares to help monitor any truce. The M23 has not formally responded.\nFor the first time, the Congolese government outlined terms for implementation, including an end to military reinforcements, rotations, and resupply, as well as a halt to external support for armed groups. The United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC is set to begin air reconnaissance in Uvira, and its acting head recently landed at Goma airport, closed since M23 seized the city last year. The African Union is now steering talks, with mediation led by Togolese President Faure Gnassingbé and supported by Angolan President João Lourenço, after earlier ceasefires and accords failed to stop the violence.\nSouth Africa to Deploy Army Against Gangs and Illegal Mining, Ramaphosa Says\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa will deploy the army to support police in fighting organized crime and illegal mining, starting in Gauteng and the Western Cape, the provinces home to the country’s largest cities. Speaking in his State of the Nation Address last night, Thursday, February 12, Ramaphosa called organized crime the most immediate threat to democracy and said criminal syndicates are fueling gang violence, illegal gold mining, and widespread gun crime. South Africa records more than 20,000 murders a year, with children and families often caught in gang crossfire. The government plans to use intelligence-led policing, deploy troops in affected communities, and hire an additional 5,500 police officers.\nRamaphosa also warned that municipal officials who fail to provide water could face criminal charges, as water shortages spark protests in cities like Johannesburg, where some areas have gone without running water for weeks. He said broken local government systems and poor infrastructure maintenance are driving the crisis, worsened by a drying climate. The moves come as South Africa heads toward local elections later this year, with voters increasingly angry over crime, unemployment, and poor service delivery. Ramaphosa, who leads the country’s first coalition government since 2024, is under pressure to show the state can restore safety, improve basic services, and curb corruption within the criminal justice system.\nUN Says RSF Atrocities in Darfur City May Amount to War Crimes\nThe United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights says abuses committed by Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces during the capture of El Fasher in Darfur amount to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity. In a report released today, Friday, February 13, the UN said more than 6,000 people were killed in the first three days of the RSF’s October 2025 offensive, following a long siege of the city. The findings are based on interviews with over 140 victims and witnesses conducted in late 2025 in Sudan’s Northern State and in eastern Chad. UN human rights chief Volker Türk called on all parties to halt the violations and urged countries with influence to act urgently, including by respecting the existing arms embargo and stopping the flow of weapons to those fighting in Sudan.\nMozambique Braces for Cyclone Gezani After Deadly Hit on Madagascar\nResidents in Mozambique’s port city of Inhambane are reinforcing homes and staying off the water as Cyclone Gezani approaches, days after the storm tore through Madagascar, killing at least 38 people and devastating the eastern city of Toamasina. Gezani made landfall in Madagascar on Tuesday with winds reaching up to 250 kilometers per hour, destroying more than 18,000 homes, displacing over 12,000 people, and cutting key roads and communications, according to authorities. Madagascar’s president said up to 75% of Toamasina was damaged and appealed for international support. Now forecast to regain strength over the Mozambique Channel, the cyclone is expected to pass close to Inhambane from today, Friday, February 13, prompting sailing restrictions and warnings of violent winds and rough seas. Mozambique is still recovering from recent floods that affected more than 700,000 people, with officials urging residents in high-risk areas to prepare for further destruction as the cyclone season continues.\nMalawi Launches Polio Vaccination Drive After Virus Found in Blantyre Sewage\nMalawi has launched a new polio vaccination campaign after health authorities detected a vaccine-derived Type 2 polio virus in sewage samples in the southern city of Blantyre, triggering an official outbreak declaration under World Health Organization rules. The drive began on Wednesday and aims to deliver 1.7 million doses of a modified oral vaccine to children through schools and door-to-door visits, starting in eight districts. Officials say the vaccine is designed to stop outbreaks linked to mutated strains from earlier oral vaccines, which have complicated global eradication efforts in recent years. Polio remains incurable and can cause permanent paralysis, though wild virus cases have dropped by more than 99% worldwide since 1988. Malawi last recorded a wild polio case in 2022, its first in 30 years, and health authorities say the current campaign will expand nationwide to protect children and prevent further spread.\nKenya to Reopen Somalia Border in April After 15-Year Closure Over al-Shabab Attacks\nKenya will reopen parts of its border with Somalia in April, nearly 15 years after it was shut following repeated attacks by the Islamist militant group al-Shabab, President William Ruto says. The border was closed in 2011 when Kenya sent troops into Somalia to push back the al-Qaeda–linked group after a series of deadly attacks, including the 2013 Westgate mall assault in Nairobi and the 2015 Garissa University massacre. Ruto says the reopening of two crossings follows years of security assessments and will come with heavy deployment of security forces to prevent attacks and curb the smuggling of weapons and contraband. The announcement comes despite recent warnings from a Mogadishu-based think tank that al-Shabab is regaining strength inside Somalia. Speaking in Mandera, a Kenyan border town with strong family and trade ties to Somalia, Ruto said the prolonged closure had unfairly cut off local communities and argued that reopening the border would boost cross-border trade while Kenya continues to fight al-Shabab.\nNigeria Sets February 2027 Date for Presidential Election\nNigeria will hold its next presidential election on February 20, 2027, with state governor races scheduled for March 6, the country’s election commission announced today, Friday, February 13. The commission called the timeline a key step in Nigeria’s democratic process, as the vote is expected to test the reform agenda of President Bola Tinubu, who is widely seen as seeking a second term. Labour Party leader Peter Obi has already confirmed he will run. The announcement comes after lawmakers approved changes allowing election results to be published live, building on recent efforts by the electoral body to use technology to improve transparency. Still, public trust in outcomes remains fragile, with court challenges after elections continuing to be common in Nigeria.\nChina Hands Over Satellite Ground Station to Namibia\nChina has officially handed over a satellite ground station to Namibia near the capital Windhoek, marking another expansion of Beijing’s overseas space program. Chinese state media said the facility will boost Namibia’s ability to receive and process satellite remote-sensing data and will be fully owned and operated by the Namibian government, with Chinese experts continuing to provide technical support after training 14 local technicians. The handover comes as China deepens its space footprint in Africa by supplying satellites, labs, and monitoring stations, even as the U.S. scales back aid. While Beijing says the projects support African space development, Reuters has reported that they also give China access to a wider surveillance network. A second phase of the Namibian facility is already planned.",
