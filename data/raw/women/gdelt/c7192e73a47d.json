  "body_text": "A NEW football training facility has been given the green light.\nCheshire West and Chester Council has approved plans to install a second 3G pitch at Moss Farm Leisure Complex in Northwich.\nIt is hoped the project will help encourage more players to participate, with a particular focus on women's and girl’s football.\n“The FA are actively promoting women/girls football with an aim to dramatically increasing the levels of female participation in the sport and it is therefore envisaged that this new facility will assist in achieving this aim,” reads a design and access statement included in the application.\n“The introduction of this new proposal will expand and improve the facilities available at the site and within the wider community, thus encouraging a wider range of participants.\n“The synthetic pitch will help to raise the standard of play and training opportunities within the local area as well as hopefully enhancing users enjoyment of sport.”\nThe application was submitted by the council itself, with the pitch to be managed and maintained by the Cheshire FA.\nThe plans include sports lighting, perimeter fencing, drainage, a storage container, access, car park and associated landscaping.\nCheshire FA and developer contributions will be used to match fund a grant bid to the Football Foundation to deliver the new facility, which will be built on an existing grass pitch.\nAccording to the Cheshire West and Chester Playing Pitch Strategy, there is a shortfall of four 3G pitches in the Northwich area.\nThe existing pitch at Moss Farm operates at 97 per cent capacity mid-week, with some local clubs forced to train at facilities that are ‘not ideal’ facilities or several miles away.\n“Within the borough of Cheshire West and Chester there is a current and future shortfall of 3G pitches that can only be met through increased provision,” the application reads.\n“With resources to improve the quality of grass pitches being limited, an increase in 3G pitches could also help reduce grass pitch shortfalls through the transfer of play, which in turn can aid pitch quality improvements.\n“Overplay on grass pitches is evident in Northwich and it’s not something that could be addressed through grass pitch improvements alone.\"\nOn Thursday (August 1), planning permission was officially granted.\nWork on the project must begin within the next three years.",
