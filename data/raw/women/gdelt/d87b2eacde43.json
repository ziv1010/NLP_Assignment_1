All the drama from cheating scandal to awful trolling\nAs the Euros kicks off it appears there's more drama happening on the sidelines than there is on the pitch as we take a look at some of this year's wives and girlfriends\nAs the England team get their 2024 campaign off to a start, we look at some of the players’ concerns off the pitch...\nWAGs at War\nIt’s the love triangle that has dominated headlines in recent months, after it was reported in December that footballer Kyle Walker had fathered a second child with his former mistress, reality star Lauryn Goodman. And to add insult to injury, it was Lauryn who told his wife of three years, Annie Kilner, in an explosive text to her on Boxing Day.\nAnnie announced she was taking a step back from her marriage to Kyle soon after, but the pair are understood to have moved past the Manchester City star’s infidelities after welcoming a fourth son together in April. He also issued a grovelling public apology to his long-suffering wife – who has had to deal with a number of other off-pitch scandals during her relationship with him – taking full responsibility for his “idiot choices”.\nBut it seems the drama is far from over. Annie and Lauren are reportedly preparing to face off on a very public stage, with both mothers keen to bring their kids along to support the England footballer at the UEFA Euros.\nLauryn, 33, reportedly told a pal: “I am determined my children [Kairo, four, and an eight-month old daughter] will get to see their daddy playing for the Three Lions this summer” and claims Kyle invited them to Germany – something he has categorically denied. Annie, meanwhile, will be in the stands with her boys, Riaan, Roman, Reign and Rezon.\nIt could turn into an almighty showdown between the two women, who have previously clashed publicly on social media. Annie appeared to brand Lauryn a “heartless h**” in a cryptic post, and Lauryn fired back with a stinging message which seemed to be aimed at Annie. “This is harassment,” she wrote. “I've just had a newborn baby and I'm dealing with this on a Sunday morning!” She also called Kyle’s wife “cruel and nasty” last year, as she claimed the WAG was trying to “eradicate from existence” the son she shares with the footballer.\nIf their past frictions are anything to go by, it seems the action off-pitch could be just as heated as it is on the pitch this summer!\nCruel Words\nIt’s not easy being in the public eye – just ask the girlfriend of Arsenal and England footballer Declan Rice. Lauren Fryer has found herself the victim of cruel bullying from footie fans in recent months, with anonymous trolls posting stinging comments about her online.\nAfter the 25-year-old was snapped enjoying herself on board a yacht with her partner of eight years in April, negative comments racked up in their thousands about how the mother-of-one looks, calling for the player to leave her as he “could do better”.\nShe’s now removed all photographs on her Instagram account, which is totally blank, while Declan's feed reveals no images of Lauren either. He’s defended Lauren, calling her beautiful and kind girlfriend, and saying that he loves her even more since the birth of their son, Jude, in 2022.\nThe cruelty hasn’t stopped there, though, as she was also subjected to abusive chants from a group of Chelsea fans at a match back in April.\nShe’s not the first WAG to have been targeted, with Victoria Beckham talking openly about her experiences with vicious chanting during the recent Beckham documentary on Netflix.\nSo, with Lauren back in the spotlight as she supports her man at the Euros, it opens her back up to the hateful comments once again. Hopefully, the childhood sweethearts’ strength as a couple will allow them to see this for what it is – cruel nonsense – and they will be able to ride it out together.\nWedding woes\nDani Dyer has made no secret about wanting to tie the knot with footballer Jarrod Bowen. The daughter of TV hardman Danny has been dating the West Ham United player since 2021 and last year she gave birth to the couple’s twin girls.\nBut now, the 27 year old former Love Island star – who also has a son, Santiago, from a previous relationship – has another personal milestone to fulfil: she’s keen to get engaged, and has openly spoken about it on TV.\nWhile sat in front of the camera for the latest instalment of Celebrity Gogglebox, Dani and dad Danny discussed the possibility of her marriage to the footballer, with the EastEnders actor saying he would give his blessing and joked that he’s even started writing his father-of-the-bride speech.\nThis is not the first time Dani has spoken about the possibility of tying the knot with the footballer, and in an interview earlier this year she said: \"That’s up to him [Jarrod]. We’ll see. We’ve just had twins, so we’ll see what happens next year.”\nBut with Jarrod’s mind completely taken up with football right now, as he focuses on his football performance at his debut England tournament, will Dani be left waiting far longer than she’d hoped for a ring on her finger?\nPicking Up The Pieces\nIt was a huge shock when Manchester City star Jack Grealish was passed over for England’s Euro 2024 squad, in favour of Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze. He was a leading man in England’s run to the finals at Wembley Stadium at the 2020 Euros, but scored just three goals in the Premier League over the last season.\nManager Gareth Southgate’s decision reportedly shocked his England team-mates, too, but it’s his long time girlfriend, model and influencer Sasha Atwood, who has been left to deal with the fallout from the disappointment.\nAs the team flew out to Germany for the first match, she was seen stocking up on delicious supplies from a local farm shop close to their £5.6 million home in Cheshire, such as fresh olives and cheeses – no doubt to try and cheer up her man.\nSasha then paid a visit to the café as she tucked into a hot chocolate with whipped cream and a huge marshmallow as well as a slice of Victoria sponge cake, presumably with her beau (although she carefully concealed who was joining her). She then rounded off the wholesome day with a sweet snap of the dog she shares with Jack and captioned it: “Oh the prettiest girl.”\nThe time out from football will, at least, give the couple a chance to enjoy some quality time together. Jack and Sasha, first met at St Peter's Roman Catholic Secondary School in Solihull and began dating at the age of 15.\nShe will also no doubt be relieved to have some time out of the limelight, after revealing that she was sent hundreds of death threats every day on social media during the 2020 Euros. So perhaps she can provide some support for poor Lauren Fryer, too...",
