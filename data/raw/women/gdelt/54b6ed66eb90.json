However, crucially, Dubai has built an ecosystem and a brand which investors want to be part of, whether that is individual buyers or global institutional capital.\"\nWhat can cause off-plan property delays?\nWith such an active real estate market, delays are to be expected, said Mr Green. \"Particularly given there is a shortage of quality contractors available to actually deliver projects, something that has been accentuated by the continuing construction boom in the region, which has resulted in a resource and brain drain in recent times.\"\nExperts have speculated on a correction in the UAE’s booming property market as new supply launches, potentially outweighing demand, but reputable developers have every incentive to deliver on time, “both to protect their brand reputation and to trigger milestone payments from buyers”, said Mr Adrees.\nLeading developers, such as Emaar, typically use payment plan structures, where 80-90 per cent of the price is paid during construction, ensuring cash flow, significantly reducing the risk of delays.\n“Developers offering more flexible or post-handover payment plans may face a greater risk of delays, especially if they have been launching projects at a fast pace to meet high demand,” he cautioned.\nWhen delays do happen, these are linked to more practical factors such as supply chain bottlenecks, permitting processes or resource allocation, Mr Adrees explained, “rather than deliberate attempts to manage pricing”.\n“In today’s fast-growing market, the rapid entry of new developers, some with limited track records, can also contribute, as these developers may face steeper learning curves in managing large-scale construction,” said Mr Adrees. “Flexible or post-handover payment plans can add further pressure, as cash flow is spread over a longer period.”\nEconomic downturns have also historically led to construction delays, but we are currently not seeing indications of this in Dubai, he added.\nMr Coates agreed it’s in the industry’s best interest for projects to deliver on time. “Off-plan delivery delays impact the market by reducing buyer confidence, increasing holding costs and tightening supply,” he said. In turn, this can push demand towards ready properties, slowing down resale activity and leading to stricter regulations, he added.\n“Over time, it benefits trusted developers but challenges overall market stability.”\nConsider carefully before you buy\nFor anyone looking to invest in off-plan properties in Dubai now, Mr Coates advised being selective in what you purchase. “Four or five years ago, any off-plan launch was seen as a strong investment … But now, because there are so many launches and there are so many properties under construction, and due to handover, there’s far more supply than there is demand,” he said.\nStick with established communities, such as Dubai Hills Estate, Arabian Ranches or Business Bay, for example, and projects from trusted developers, he said. “You know the build quality is going to be good and there are not going to be delays. There’s always going to be a demand for those types of properties on the rental market.”\nThat’s not to say don’t invest in smaller developers, he added. “But just be careful. Essentially, what may seem like a brilliant idea in the long run, probably isn’t.”\nAs for property type, he said, budget permitting, investing in off-plan townhouses and stand-alone villas right now is a smart decision since far fewer are due to be handed over than apartments. “There’s always going to be less of them for sale at one given time. The less of what there is available, the more there is of a demand – and you’re going to be able to resell that property for higher prices.”",
