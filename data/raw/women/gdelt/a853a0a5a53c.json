  "body_text": "And just like that, the Lionesses have made it all the way to the World Cup Finals.\nGrab yourself an England shirt because less than 12 months on from their Euro 2022 win, England’s Lionesses have fought their way through another major tournament: the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. Hoping to bag themselves another win and add even more silverware to their ever-growing cabinet of impressive shiny things, the England women's football team (aka the Lionesses) have made it to the final without some of their firm favourites – including former captain Leah Williamson, who is out of action due to an injury.\nHere's everything you need to know about the Women’s England Team, including when the final kicks off and where to watch?\nWhat time is the World Cup final taking place?\nThe World Cup final will kick off on Sunday 20 August at 11:00am, seeing the Lionesses play against Spain.\nWhere can I watch the Women's World Cup final?\nThe final will be broadcast on both BBC and ITV for free! Matches will also be available to watch on BBC iPlayer and ITVX, so you won't have to worry if you find yourself missing the big match for any pre-booked brunch appointments. Currently on holiday? Find out how to watch the World Cup Final 2023 from abroad.\nWhen did the Women's World Cup start?\nThe Women's World Cup 2023 kicked off on Thursday 20 July, taking place across Australia and New Zealand.\nWhat are the England Women's/ Lioness fixtures?\nThe Lionesses' first match was on Saturday 22 July, where they took on Haiti at 10:30am UK time, coming out with a 1-0 win. On Friday 28 July, they took on Denmark at 09:30am UK time, coming out with yet another undefeated 1-0 win. And on Tuesday 1 August, they beat China with an impressive 6-0 win - taking them through to the knockout stages.\nAfter getting all the way through to the semi-finals with wins against Colombia and Nigeria, the Lionesses secured their slot in the final with a 3-1 win over Australia.\nYou might have noticed all of the matches seem to be taking place during working hours (boo!) and that's because England is currently nine hours behind Australia, while New Zealand are 11 hours ahead.

Already posting loads of behind the scenes content, there’s no doubt they’ll be keeping fans in the loop with match dates and times as the team progress through the stages.\nWhere can I buy an England Lionesses shirt?\nThere's a number of places you can shop to show your support for the Lionesses this summer! Head on over to the official England Store for your football kits (but ASDA also have some cute official tees if you want to shop on a budget.)\nWho is the Lionesses manager, Sarina Wiegman?\nFrankly, Sarina Wiegman needs no introduction. The Dutch football manager made history after becoming the first coach to lead the Lionesses to their major Euro’s win on home soil last summer. It wasn’t only a major success for the squad, but for Sarina too – with the 35 year old now regarded as one of the best international coaches in the women’s game.\nWho are the England women's goalkeepers?\nMary Earps: First goalkeeper\nContinuing to be England’s undisputed number one goalkeeper, 30 year old Mary Earps is no doubt set to be a key figure on the pitch. Proving just how good she is in goal, the athlete ended this season at Manchester United with 14 clean sheets – winning her first ever WSL Golden Glove. For non footie-fans, that’s a big deal.\nEllie Roebuck: Goalkeeper\nA solid number two, 23 year old Ellie Roebuck already has plenty of experience performing under pressure. The Manchester City star has already played in Euros, FA Cups, and League Cups - with this World Cup proving an important one for securing her place in the Lionesses future.\nTalking to Grazia last year about her World Cup hopes, she said 'I'll just constantly have that winning mentality knowing there’s no better feeling than winning.'\nHannah Hampton: Goalkeeper\nOur third goalie comes in the form of Aston Villa star Hannah Hampton – but it’s certainly been a journey. The 22 year old was dropped from Wiegman’s first England squad back in September due to ‘personal issues.’ But after undergoing surgery on a muscle injury, she's now been recalled as one of this year’s Lionesses. Opening up about the star, Aston Villa manager Carla Wood said ‘She’s absolutely flying, playing some of the best football of her career, so long may that continue.’\nWho are the England women's defenders?\nMillie Bright: Defender\nFollowing a knee injury earlier this year, Chelsea’s Millie Bright didn't seem a done deal. But with the 29 year old rising to the role of captain after Leah Williamson’s injury, the 29 years old is set to lead the Lionesses to victory.\nLucy Bronze: Defender\nStepping on the pitch for every game during the Lionesses victory last summer, it’s really no surprise that 31 year old Lucy Bronze has once again made the squad. After moving from Manchester City to Barcelona just under a year ago, the athlete has been dubbed one of the best right-backs that women’s football has ever seen.\nJess Carter: Defender\nChelsea defender Jess Carter is back once again. The 25 year old is a regular fixture on the Lionesses’ trophy-winning squad, meaning she’ll no doubt be impressing even more this summer.\nLotte Wubben-Moy: Defender\nIt’s been a busy few months for Arsenal player Lotte Wubben-Moy. Even more impressive than the 24 year old's work on the pitch is her work off the pitch, using her platform to improve access to football and sports for girls across the country.\nAlex Greenwood: Defender\nAfter Rachel Daly’s move into forward, a spot opened up on defence for Manchester City’s Alex Greenwood, who was used as a substitute during the club’s 2022 victory. At 29, she’s considered to be one of the most experienced players.\nNiamh Charles: Defender\nNiamh Charles was one of the player’s cut from the Euro 2022 squad last summer, but after an ever-so-impressive season at Chelsea, it’s a no brainer to bring the 23 year old into the Lioness squad.\nEsme Morgan: Defender\nEsme Morgan might just be one of the Lionesses biggest weapons this summer... Known for her versatility, the Manchester city player is capable of filling roles across the pitch. Everyone loves an all-rounder! This will be the 22 year old’s first taste of a major tournament, but she has already defended England at a variety of youth levels before.\nWho are the England women's midfielders?\nJordan Nobbs: Midfielder\nOne of the Lionesses legendary players, Jordan Nobbs has secured herself a spot in the World Cup. The 30 year old left her longtime club in Arsenal to move to Aston Villa in the hopes of securing more regular football. It’s paid off, with Jordan jetting off to Australia and New Zealand to compete in her second World Cup.\nKiera Walsh: Midfielder\nYet another player who made a move in hopes of landing a place on the Lionesses, 26 year old Kiera Walsh left Manchester City for Barcelona last month. She’s a key player in the England squad’s success – as she should be, currently holding the title for the world’s most expensive player.\nElla Toone: Midfielder\n23 year old Ella Toone became a household name after scoring against Germany in the Euros final at Wembley – and with a knack for landing a goal right when it’s needed, the Manchester United star will be a great starter for the Lionesses.\nGeorgia Stanway: Midfielder\nIt’s hard to forget Georgia Stanway’s goal against Spain in the Euro’s quarter-finals, making the 24 year old Bayern Munich player yet another fan favourite in the Lioness line-up.\nLaura Coombs: Midfielder\nManchester City’s Laura Coombs has openly admitted that England wasn’t on her mind at the start of the season, but now the 32 year old is stepping up to show the leadership that the Lionesses have lost out on due to injury.\nKatie Zelem: Midfielder\nManchester United captain Katie Zelem will be jetting off for her first ever major tournament with England, after being cut from the squad last summer. In and out of the Lionesses over the last year, the 27 year old has already made plenty of appearances from the subs bench.\nWho are the England women's forwards/strikers?\nRachel Daly: Forward\nMeet Rachel Daly, the scoring sensation. The Aston Villa player’s 22 goals in the league saw her break the record for the most goals in a Women’s Super League Season – and land her the iconic golden boot. Here’s hoping the 31 year old brings some of that magic to the World Cup…\nLauren Hemp: Forward\nAnother star behind the Lionesses win last summer, Lauren Hemp started in all six matches during the Euros last summer. The 22-year-old Manchester City footballer is already a strong member of the team, having scored 10 goals in 35 games for her country. Sounds impressive to us!\nChloe Kelly: Forward\nLet us all cast our minds back and remember Chloe Kelly’s legendary shirt-off celebration at the Euros. Honestly, not much more needs to be said about the 25-year-old Manchester City star. Fingers crossed she brings us some more iconic moments.\nAlessia Russo: Forward\nAnother household name when it comes to the Lionesses, Alessia Russo's backheel against Sweden last summer sent the country into meltdown. Dubbed a hero by fans, the 24-year-old Manchester United star is once again ready to reporesent the Lionesses.\nLauren James: Forward\nSet to become one of England’s key players, Lauren James is quickly becoming one of the Women’s Super League’s rising stars. At just 21, she’s one of the youngest footballer’s stepping on the pitch. But football clearly runs in her family, with the Chelsea player being the sister of England footballer Reece James.\nKatie Robinson: Forward\nAnother of the Lionesses youngest stars, Katie Robinson received her call-up to the senior squad last year after she impressed bosses with her performance in the U23 team. Opening up about being in the World Cup, 20-year-old Brighton player Katie said ‘There’s a big jump in quality of training with the first team, it’s unbelievable. I’ve loved my time so far and Sarina is great to work with.\nBethany England: Forward\nGiven her last name is England, it only makes sense for Bethany to be part of the Lionesses. The 28 year old recently opened up about how a ‘big risk’ paid off in her World Cup dream, after leaving long-time club Chelsea for a move to Tottenham earlier this year. The move came with the hopes that more regular matches would increase her chances of making the Lioness squad – and it did!",
