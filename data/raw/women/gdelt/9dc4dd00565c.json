  "body_text": "UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin has mocked the Super League as \"fantastic\" and \"amusing\", hours after the European Court of Justice ruled that UEFA and FIFA had contravened EU law by preventing the league's formation.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nThe EU court said UEFA and FIFA had used their dominant position by threatening sanctions against the 12 clubs that proposed forming the breakaway European league which led to nine of them withdrawing.\nJuventus pulled out later, leaving Real Madrid and Barcelona as the only supporters of the Super League.\n\"We will not try to stop them. They can create whatever they want,\" Ceferin told a virtual press conference on Thursday after learning that the Super League concept was set to be revived by the sports development company, A22.\n\"I hope they start their fantastic competition as soon as possible, with two clubs.\n\"I hope they know what they are doing but I'm not so sure about that,\" added Ceferin.\n\"Football is not for sale - we have shown that many times.\"\nMocking the A22 presentation, he added: \"It's really hard to decide if you should be shocked or amused by the show that we have seen.\n\"Since it's close to Christmas, I will choose amusement. I am amused by it.\"\nCeferin was joined on the call by senior officials including Nasser Al-Khelaifi, President of Paris St Germain and the European Club Association, LaLiga President Javier Tebas and European Leagues President Pedro Proenca.\nCeferin pointed out that Thursday's ruling does not give the green light nor approve projects such as the \"so-called Super League\" as the court did not rule on it specifically.\n\"They see it as a victory but I don't see it at all,\" Al-Khelaifi said. \"The ruling has nothing to do with the Super League. All the stakeholders in Europe are sticking together with the same goal...it will just make us better and stronger.\"\nAl-Khelaifi also raised questions about A22, the sports development company which was formed to help set up the Super League.\nA22 have proposed a new competition with 64 men's and 32 women's teams playing midweek matches in a league system across Europe.\n\"Who's A22? That's my question to you, who is A22?\" he said. \"Where do they come from? What is their history?\"\nAl-Khelaifi described the Champions League, which was formed in 1992, as the \"best club competition in the world\".\nAustralian Associated Press",
