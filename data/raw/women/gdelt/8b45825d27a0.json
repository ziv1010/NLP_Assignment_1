Generally I believe in giving yourself time off from sport that hurts you but Spurs have been impossible to look away from this season. And I’m presenting the Women’s Ashes for TNT Sports so, you know.\nEngland women were my main frustration last year after the headless reaction to captain Heather Knight’s injury during the defeat to West Indies which led to their elimination from the T20 World Cup.\nIt didn’t help that Australia were subsequently knocked out in the semi-finals. Since they had won six of the previous seven World Cups and England had hammered eventual champions New Zealand twice that year, this should really have been a golden opportunity.\nThat it wasn’t was put down to a lack of leadership in the team, outside of the captaincy – held for more than eight years now by Knight. She has been one of the world’s most outstanding cricketers who led England to a famous World Cup win at Lord’s in 2017, was a Wisden cricketer of the year in 2018 and a key factor in the last England Ashes victory more than ten years ago.\nYou may notice that these accolades are from quite some time ago, like those of the England team.\nAustralia retained the Ashes on Monday at the earliest possible moment, taking all eight points available so far. Knight herself knows the performance of her side is crucial in growing the women’s game in this country – last year she said: ‘Ultimately our biggest chance to inspire is winning big competitions and performing in big events’.\nHead coach Jon Lewis took over three years ago and was credited with developing a more aggressive, freer style of cricket, like that showcased by the men. But at crucial points, with the eyes of the world on them, the England women have come up short.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nIt’s unsurprising Knight as captain hasn’t gone in on her team but her claims they have been there or thereabouts Down Under aren’t true. England have lacked in every area: sloppy fielding, batters – in the main – failing to fire, inconsistent bowling.\nTherefore, though the Ashes are gone, the three remaining games are crucial. Can England fight for their captain and their approach? I’d love to see it. Should a whitewash transpire change is surely indicated.\nTottenham’s recent defeat to Everton felt nearly as shocking. Personally I currently go into every game assuming we’ll lose. It’s a habit honed over many years, protecting me from slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. But right now I really believe it. The north London derby was actually a much better performance than those who’ve not seen it will have you believe. And it’s true that Ange Postecoglou’s side have a lot of injuries, much like Bournemouth. Did you see them at the weekend by the way?\nThe hollowed-out Spurs backline looks it. Micky van de Ven is an irreplaceable talent and Cristian Romero, World Cup-winning centre-back, would be a big miss from any team. But let’s not forget that Dr Tottenham’s losses to Crystal Palace and Ipswich were achieved with near-full strength line-ups.\nMore Trending\nUnlike with England, my feeling with Spurs is that change is not good. The instinct at moments of true crisis like this – Spurs really are eight points above the relegation zone more than halfway through the season – is usually to make some change, any change, to see if it will help. But new manager bounce is usually only a two-game strategy.\nThe five years when Spurs were a building club under Mauricio Pochettino were my favourite ever, and I still believe Postecoglou has the capacity to be that guy. See how Tottenham’s teenagers have done all that’s been asked of them and more. Ange undoubtedly needs help but the transfer window remains open. I fear the pressure now on the cups may crush any season-saving wins but I still believe consistency is key. And not just when I glance at the table and see Nuno Espirito Santo’s Nottingham Forest third, and remember how he bored himself out the door here.\nThe style gives what we want, but more pragmatism is needed, as are players. Results can follow. Please!!\nThe final games of the Women’s Ashes are live on TNT Sports and Discovery+.
