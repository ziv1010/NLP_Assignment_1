The Barcelona player made her debut for the Lionesses in 2013 and this will be her sixth major international tournament — after Euro 2013, 2017 and 2022 and the 2015 and 2019 World Cups.\nMeanwhile, eight members of the 23-player squad (35 per cent) have 10 caps or fewer, with 22-year-old goalkeeper Hannah Hampton having played for England the fewest times (twice).\nElla Toone is the squad’s top scorer; the Manchester United midfielder has scored 16 times for her country. The most famous of those goals came at Wembley last summer when she opened the scoring against Germany in the final of Euro 2022.\nOverall, 13 of England’s 20 outfield players have an international goal to their name. Wiegman will be hoping that number is higher come the end of the World Cup.\nThe age range of England’s squad is evenly spread across the field, as you can see from the graphic below. Those selected by Wiegman represent a nice blend of youth, experience and players currently in their peak years.\nThere are five squad members in their 30s, with Laura Coombs (32) the oldest England player going to the tournament.\nOnly Coombs and Bronze were alive during the first women’s World Cup — which took place in China in November 1991. England didn’t qualify.\nKatie Robinson is the youngest player selected and the 20-year-old Brighton & Hove Albion forward will be looking to add to her four caps this summer.\nNow let’s compare this England squad to the past 10 that were taken to major tournaments.\nThe average number of caps per player in this group is just under 32, which represents a significant drop from recent years. It is the first time England have gone to a tournament with the average number of caps in their squad below 40 since the 2011 World Cup.\nThe figure was approaching 60 for Euro 2017 but has dropped for each tournament since then.\nAdvertisement\nIt should be noted that there is a lack of data from Euro 2001, 2005 and 2009, with neither the FA nor UEFA having access to the relevant information for these tournaments.\nThe average age of the players selected for the World Cup is just under 26, which makes this England’s youngest squad at a major tournament since Euro 2009 in Finland. England lost in the final to Germany in that tournament.\nThe squad selected for Euro 2017 was the oldest in recent years, with the average player just over 28 years old.\nFor the fifth consecutive tournament, Manchester City are the club to provide the most players to England’s squad.\nThere are six City players heading to Australia and New Zealand with England: Ellie Roebuck, Esme Morgan, Alex Greenwood, Coombs, Lauren Hemp and Chloe Kelly.\nChelsea and Manchester United are next, with the top two sides in this season’s Women’s Super League each providing four players.\nThe last time City weren’t the best-represented club in a Lionesses squad at a major tournament was Euro 2013. That competition saw Arsenal provide the most players with six, and Lincoln Ladies, who have since dissolved, the second most (four).\nMeanwhile, this is the first tournament in the 21st century where Arsenal haven’t been among the three clubs providing the most players for an England squad.\nThree squad members play their club football abroad: Bronze and Keira Walsh at Barcelona and Georgia Stanway at Bayern Munich.\nWhen it comes to the birthplaces of the 23 players in Wiegman’s squad, Greater London, Greater Manchester and South Yorkshire lead the way with three players each.\nLotte Wubben-Moy, Kelly and Lauren James were born in London; Ella Toone, Walsh and Katie Zelem in Greater Manchester; and Roebuck, Morgan and Bethany England in South Yorkshire.\nThis is clearly a talented England squad, with a solid mix of experience and youth and one that contains players who play domestically across three of Europe’s best leagues.\nBut are they good enough to achieve something that all previous women’s squads have failed to do and become world champions? We will soon find out…\nGO DEEPER\nIntroducing England Women's 2023 World Cup squad: every player analysed\n(Top photo: Morgan Harlow – The FA/The FA via Getty Images)",
