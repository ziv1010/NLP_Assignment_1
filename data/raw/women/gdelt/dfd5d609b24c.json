  "body_text": "Never before had England manager Sarina Wiegman been so publicly criticised until last month.\nFormer England No 1 Mary Earps wrote in her autobiography All In that she believed goalkeeper Hannah Hampton had been “rewarded for bad behaviour”, a controversial extract in the book that sparked headlines and debate. Wiegman could have been “more direct and honest” about the competition for the No 1 spot, Earps wrote. The Dutchwoman’s reasoning, she said, recalling that Wiegman had said she always communicated openly, sounded like “bull****”.\nAdvertisement\nIf Wiegman and the Lionesses were affected by it all, they did not show it on the pitch with two commanding performances against China and Ghana, their first games since the fallout. Though two friendlies against lower-ranked opponents, England nevertheless won both, scoring 10 goals in total and conceding none.\n“I feel good,” Wiegman said when asked about Earps’ comments at England’s squad announcement before the two matches. “I make decisions to win.”\nShe would not have changed how she dealt with the matter, either: “As I say all the time, I can never control the mood of other people.”\nBut such public revelations of the three-time European Championship-winning manager’s modus operandi are even more significant given Wiegman keeps, in her words, “private conversations private”. Wiegman does so to build trust between players and so was disappointed that those discussions were made public.\nThe Dutch coach takes pains to create and maintain a secure bubble around the squad. As her now-England assistant Arvid Smit told The Athletic in 2023, when he was then the Netherlands assistant, Wiegman does not like leaks. “It can kill you as a team,” he said.\nBut Earps’ comments burst that bubble and had the potential to splinter the dressing room when the squad reconvened a few weeks later to prepare for the homecoming friendlies.\nHampton, however, was not selected because of injury, which made it easier to put the matter to one side.\nSome players are understandably closer to Earps than Hampton or vice versa. Take key leaders Lucy Bronze and Keira Walsh, for example, friends with Earps but also Hampton’s Chelsea team-mates. In her book, Earps details that after she told the team of her decision to retire at dinner five weeks before Euro 2025, it was Bronze who encouraged Wiegman to say some words to mark the achievements of a goalkeeper who was ending her 53-cap international career as a reigning European champion, a 2023 World Cup Golden Glove and two-time FIFA Best goalkeeper.\nAccording to Earps, Wiegman did so before saying, “I’m not handling this very well”. It was then Walsh who took it upon herself to speak about the goalkeeper’s contribution, according to Earps. The Football Association (FA) and representatives of Wiegman declined to comment when approached by The Athletic.\nThough the saga dominated last month’s squad announcement, with Wiegman facing multiple questions on the topic, she was not worried it would disrupt the squad. “In teams, there’s always dynamics going on,” she said. “We’re working with people and everyone’s different. I want my door to be open at all times to have conversations when needed.”\nAdvertisement\nAccording to sources close to the team, speaking anonymously to protect relations, there was no formal squad meeting led by Wiegman to specifically address Earps’ comments. Of course, informal conversations may have taken place.\nPlayers, understandably, did not publicly take sides.\n“They’re both my team-mates so I think it would be unfair for me to speak on that,” said Walsh, captain in place of the injured Leah Williamson, in Friday’s press conference before the China friendly.\n“We’re professionals, we know our jobs and we just have to crack on,” said Alessia Russo, who played with Earps at Manchester United, after the 8-0 win against China. “They’re both great people, it’s football, things happen, it’s really important we come here ready to perform.”\nBronze also dispelled that there was any extra motivation to quieten the noise. “It’s a completely separate issue,” she said following Saturday’s thrashing. “When we turn up to England, we play for England.\n“We’ve had issues in the media for a number of years — different topics, different players, noise on the outside, whether it’s people’s personal lives, pitch performances, players being picked, everything. When you put on the shirt and you come into the England team, it’s about focusing on what you can bring to this team.”\nWiegman had a similar, but less high-profile, experience during her time with the Netherlands national team. After the second group-stage game of a triumphant Euro 2017, Wiegman did not start her captain, Mandy van den Berg, for the rest of the tournament.\nAnnemarie Postma wrote the book Together Strong (The secret of the Orange Lionesses). Speaking to The Athletic, she recounts the extract which outlines the situation between the two, with Van den Berg saying she felt Wiegman’s decision to drop her came out of the blue. The Dutch coach told Van den Berg, writes Postma, that she was “unlucky” not to be taller as she opted for the centre-back pairing of Anouk Dekker and Stefanie van der Gragt instead.\nAdvertisement\nVan den Berg — who worked closely with her at Dutch side ADO Den Haag — was most disappointed Wiegman did not talk through the decision-making process with her along the way. It draws some parallels with Earps’ situation. Had she done so, the defender would have felt she had been treated like a “full professional”, rather than “putting me aside like a child”, it says in the book. “I hope I never treat people like that,” said Van den Berg. “No one has ever disappointed me as much as Sarina.”\nAfter the Netherlands’ Euro 2017 win, the book reveals that Van den Berg and Wiegman had a formal meeting in a hotel in the city of Den Haag, where Wiegman explained that, as the manager, she had to make such decisions and felt her process was the only option.\nWiegman is quoted in the book as describing the situation as one of the “toughest moments” in her career but, similar to the Earps scenario, would not have dealt with it differently. She acknowledged Van den Berg would have wanted to be informed earlier but had to keep her options open, given Van der Gragt had suffered an injury before the tournament.\n“I didn’t feel guilty about it,” said Wiegman in the book. “I did feel very bad.” When asked about the book by The Athletic, representatives of Wiegman declined to comment.\nBut difficult decisions are part of a manager’s life. Wiegman tries not to put herself in the player’s shoes. “I have to shut that out for that moment,” Wiegman told reporters before Euro 2025, raising her hand to her face as if putting up a barrier.\nEven before the 2019 World Cup, while Wiegman was the Netherlands manager and Van den Berg was recovering from a torn anterior cruciate ligament, the pair sat side by side on a TV show broadcast by NOS, the Dutch public broadcaster, and spoke about Van den Berg being dropped two years prior. When asked if everything had cleared up, Van den Berg said, “I still think it’s a shame”, while Wiegman said it was one of the hardest aspects of coaching.\nBut once Wiegman makes a decision, she does not look back.\nFran Kirby, who was honoured at Wembley on Saturday before the match against China, and Millie Bright have both also retired from international duty this year. The former before the Euros, saying she was unable to give “100 per cent mentally or physically,” and the latter in October after withdrawing from selection before Euro 2025. Discussions are ongoing between the FA and Earps and Bright to receive their tributes in 2026.\nAdvertisement\n“Sometimes I tell players they won’t be selected anymore and then they retire, that’s a natural process,” Wiegman said at the squad announcement for the homecoming friendlies. “These players have had a tremendous career with huge highs, and now it’s time to move on from them.”\nDespite the off-the-pitch disruption heading into Euro 2025, with much of the spotlight on Earps’ surprise retirement, and the rollercoaster performances on it, interestingly, Wiegman enjoyed England’s Euro 2025 triumph “more than the other tournaments before”.\n“The team was so calm and composed,” she said, looking back on the year before Tuesday’s 2-0 victory against Ghana in Southampton.\nIt was on the English south coast that Wiegman’s first match as England manager took place in 2021. As 2026 approaches, Wiegman enters new territory: her fifth year with England, surpassing her four years with the Netherlands, and the first tournament without her trusted Dutch lieutenants, assistant Arjan Veurink, who is now the Netherlands head coach, and general manager Anja van Ginhoven, director of women’s football operations at global investment firm Sixth Street.\nHer contract with the FA expires after the 2027 World Cup. She has not had, in her words, “clear conversations” but is relaxed about the situation. “I’m still really enjoying the job,” she told reporters before the Ghana match. “I think the team is still enjoying that I’m around. I think that’s really, really important too.”\nAs England start their next cycle, targeting the 2027 World Cup, no doubt there will be more difficult conversations to come but as recent history has proved, Wiegman will stay true to herself.",
