The transfer deadline in England closes on 3 February.”\nEchegini joined PSG from Juventus in June 2024 on a three-year contract that runs until June 2027, following her development at the Arsenal academy.\nSince her arrival in Paris, she has established herself as a key midfield presence, valued for her composure, tempo control and ability to influence decisive moments.\nHer growing reputation has also been shaped by her performances for Nigeria.\nEchegini scored the winning goal in the 2024 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final in Morocco, to secure a historic 10th continental title for the Super Falcons.\nAccording to Soccerdona valuations, Transfermarkt’s women football platform, Echegini is currently Africa’s fifth most valuable female footballer and Nigeria’s second most valuable, behind Rasheedat Ajibade at €375,000.",
