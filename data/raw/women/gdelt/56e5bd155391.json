And, if she wants to talk to us, it's totally her choice as well.\n\"So, if she's keen on having a chat, we'll certainly be open to it. But, I guess the biggest thing is, for Newcastle, why does she want to leave ... She's played here for most of her life. She's home here, but from my end, we're yet to have a chat with her, so we'll just have to wait and see where that lands.\n\"But, from my aspect, our focus is our football team right now, and week to week we're just focusing on preparing well and getting the job done on the weekend, and the other stuff is sort of white noise at the moment.\"\nThe speculation was first sparked by a News Limited podcast and grew legs during the week.\nKnights legend and NRL Immortal Andrew Johns even weighed in on the topic, saying he hoped Southwell \"doesn't go\" for the competition's sake.\nBut Broncos captain Ali Brigginshaw said people should be talking about one of the best halves in the game, and having the NRLW hitting the headlines showed how far women's sport had come.\n\"She's a 20-year-old kid, and she's forming to be one of the best sevens in the game,\" Brigginshaw said.\n\"So, I think if we just give her space to talk to all the clubs, there's no reason why she shouldn't be talking to every club, when she's playing that good a footy for a 20-year-old.\n\"We'll be watching her play 300 games, so just let her do her thing. She'll end up where she ends up, but I think it's a good thing that people are talking about our sevens like that, and they're in the media. There was a time when they weren't.\"\nThe Knights are adamant they want to keep their home-grown star, who has contract options for the next two seasons, and director of football Peter Parr told the Newcastle Herald last Monday that discussions had been \"positive and promising\".\n\"I just spoke to her then, and she said, 'It's just crazy, I don't know where it's come from',\" Brigginshaw said.\n\"She said, 'I just play footy and there's all these headlines about me'. I said, 'It's because you're good'.\n\"People talk about players that they see the future of, and I said, 'You know you've made it when people are talking about you, especially as a seven'.\n\"You'd be silly not to talk to her. I know that people try to form some rivalry between us, but I wouldn't hold anything against the club for talking to her.\n\"When you have a good seven out there and she's off-contract, you've got to lock them down. So, she's more than welcome to come to Brisbane, but she's more than welcome to talk to any club.\n\"She's a 20-year-old kid, and she deserves the opportunity to do that.\"\nThe 30-point defeat in front of a large home crowd was Newcastle's worst loss since their winless inaugural 2021 season, which was played in 2022 due to COVID, and 46 points is the most they've ever conceded.\nThe game turned quickly after Newcastle held a 16-4 lead midway through the first half.\nBrisbane ran in three tries in the final five minutes of the first half and then capitalised on having an extra player later in the second to run rings around the Knights.\nProp Kayla Romaniuk was sent to the sin bin with 15 minutes remaining for a hip drop on Broncos winger Hayley Maddick.\nAt that point, Brisbane led 30-16 after a strong start to the second half.\nThe second-placed Broncos ran in five unanswered tries in the second half, finding holes in some at-times brittle Knights defence.\nThe loss came after Newcastle were beaten 30-14 by defending premiers and unbeaten leaders the Sydney Roosters.\nBefore the back-to-back losses, which has left the third-placed Knights four points adrift of Brisbane with three rounds to play, Newcastle had only conceded 64 points in six games.\n\"The scoreline probably points towards defence more than anything,\" Knights coach Ben Jeffries said.\n\"There was probably way too many missed tackles compared to what's happened.\n\"I think we just sort of undone a lot of the hard work we've done. From rounds two to six we did a lot of really good work, last week as well.\n\"We'll regroup and go forward. What we've created is an environment where individuals own their mistakes and that will happen again. But we'll regroup and go again against Cronulla.\"\nThe Knights face the Sharks on the road next Sunday.\nCronulla joined Newcastle on 10 points on Sunday afternoon after beating the New Zealand Warriors 22-14.\nMATCH REPORT: Knights sustain biggest loss of season\nThe Brisbane Broncos have overpowered the Knights 46-16 to rattle Newcastle's NRLW premiership hopes.\nThe 30-point defeat is Newcastle's worst loss since their winless inaugural 2021 season, which was played in 2022 due to COVID, and 46 points is the most they've ever conceded.\nThe game turned quickly after Newcastle held a 16-4 lead midway through the first half.\nBrisbane ran in three tries in the final five minutes of the first half and then capitalised on having an extra player later in the second to run rings around the Knights.\nProp Kayla Romaniuk was sent to the sin bin with 15 minutes remaining for a hip drop on Broncos winger Hayley Maddick.\nAt that point, Brisbane led 30-16 after a strong start to the second half.\nThe Broncos turned a 16-4 deficit 25 minutes into the match into a 18-16 half-time lead after Shalom Sauaso (30th minute), Kerri Johnson (33rd minute) and Maddick (35th minute) all powered to the line in a lethal five-minute period.\nBrisbane then opened up an eight-point lead three minutes after the break through second-rower Lauren Dam after a Knights penalty gifted their opponents good field position.\nWith the third play, five-eighth Gayle Broughton took on the line then skillfully offloaded for Dam.\nFormer Knights fullback Tamika Upton tore Newcastle's line apart in the 48th minute, then Maddick (56th minute), Romy Teitzel (59th minute) and Julia Robinson (66th minute) all busted through flimsy defence to complete the bloodbath.\nTeitzel finished the game with five successful conversions from nine attempts.\nSheridan Gallagher gave Newcastle a 4-0 lead in the 10th minute when she stepped inside her defender to score in the right corner.\nProp Tiana Davison then burst onto a short ball from halfback Jesse Southwell to score next to the post from close range in the 16th minute.\nSouthwell converted after missing her first attempt to put Newcastle ahead 10-0.\nBut in a toe-to-toe first-half battle, the Broncos struck back through power-packed centre Mele Hufanga, who steamrolled her way to the try-line in the 21st minute.\nTeitzel's missed conversion kept the Knights up by six.\nAs she had done already twice this season, Newcastle five-eighth Georgia Roche then stepped, dummied and weaved her way to the line in the 24th minute and Southwell's conversion made it 16-6.\nBut it was all Brisbane from there in the first half.\nThe defeat came a week after Newcastle lost 30-14 to defending premiers and unbeaten leaders the Sydney Roosters.",
