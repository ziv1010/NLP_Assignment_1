They are aimed at building partnerships with organisations which support communities, the environment and with supporting the development of employability and skills. A total of £100,000 is being made available to charities, volunteering groups and grassroots community organisations throughout 2024.\nAmong the diverse mix of groups set to benefit from this latest round of funding are:\n• Knockbreda Community and Wildlife Garden, in south Belfast, a cross-community project which is running a programme of plant protection to support species which are under threat. Working with experts, the group has identified the Irish Bluebell as a priority, as it is being replaced by the Spanish Bluebell. It is hoped that the programme will be able to extend into preserving other native species in future.\n• The Greater Village Regeneration Trust, an urban charity based in the Village area of south Belfast, which will be delivering a women's DIY project, aimed at developing practical skills to support independence and counter the need for private contractors to carry out work.\n• Richhill Amalgamated Football Club, in Co Armagh, which will use their award in delivering regular holiday youth camps, helping to promote greater engagement for young people throughout the summer months.\nSuccessful applicants also include a group which supports refugees and asylum seekers, helping them to integrate better within society by creating personal and social development opportunities.\nJenni Barkley, Community Engagement Manager at Belfast Harbour, said: \"The Community Awards are about so much more than just offering simple donations. They are about helping to highlight and reward the incredible work which goes on every day within our communities – work which often goes unrecognised, particularly among those groups operating at a grassroots level.\n\"The organisations that have applied for funding are doing amazing work within their communities, and we are proud to support such a variety of projects across Belfast and beyond.\n\"Belfast Harbour, as a socially responsible Trust Port, is committed to building sustainable communities through strong grassroots engagement. The Community Awards are a key part of our ongoing commitment to building partnerships with the organisations who are out there supporting our communities, helping the environment and developing the skills people need to get into work.\n\"We look forward to supporting future projects through the Community Awards, investing in our communities, protecting our environment and developing people.\"\nJohn Warren, a committee member with Knockbreda Community and Wildlife Garden, said: \"The Knockbreda Community and Wildlife Garden aims to bring people of all abilities together to enjoy gardening. This fantastic funding received from Belfast Harbour will enable us to enhance the launch of our Bluebell Protection programme. Our initial aim through this project is to grow 1,000 Irish Bluebells and in doing so draw the public's attention to the environmental issues currently affecting us all.\"\nThe Belfast Harbour Community Awards will be open to community organisations, charities and not-for-profit groups for another round of funding in the Autumn.
