(KCTV) - The historic first regular season at CPKC Stadium in Kansas City ended with a 4-1 win, led by National Women’s Soccer League MVP candidate Temwa Chawinga.\nThe KC Current (15-3-7) beat the San Diego Wave (5-13-7) Saturday afternoon in front of yet another sold-out crowd.\nAccording to the Current’s Match Report, they have become the first team in league history to sell out every home game in a regular season.\nAs for the stadium itself, the KC Current leadership is soaking in this season, which will have a home playoff match, before making adjustments to their operations at this time.\nBut still, there have been successes and challenges in being a leader in the women’s sports world.\n“It’s exciting to be able to say that we have grown so much from March 16 until now,” said Vice President of Communications Dani Welniak. “How this has impacted the community, impacted women’s sports, and that is an incredible, incredible accomplishment but also how we can do it better next season knowing this is something that needs to be sustainable and is sustainable.”\nThe play by the team on the pitch is a major reason for the overall success of what’s been built on the Berkley Riverfront.\n“We‘ve gone from just being a spectacle to now selling our stadium for every regular season home match,” she said. “Having fans, as you can see with Fan Appreciation Day, wearing the teal, wearing the heartland red, and they’ve got KC Current gear that they wear to work.”\nKC Current superfan covered in teal, “Teal Man,” emphasized the significance that the KC Current playing in their own stadium had on the fans. He did not bash Children’s Mercy Park in any way but mentioned that going to that field and seeing the Sporting KC logo and colors created a different feel for the Current fans.\n“It‘s hard to be rah-rah-rah when you see Sporting KC on the seats. It’s just that bittersweet like we are being allowed to play here,” he said. “This is now our spot. A revolutionary, world-changing experience where little girls and women can feel inspired to achieve their own greatness.”\nNorthland resident Jack Barron joined his family at Saturday‘s regular-season finale. He said he‘s been to a few games but it was his parents’ first and knew they’d have a good time.\n“I’ve been out to a few ones and it’s just the best environment in the city,” he said.\nBarron is studying sports journalism at Arizona State University so he spends most of his time now in Phoenix. He‘s proud of his hometown team and lets them know what they are missing with the KC Current breaking barriers for women’s sports.\n“This stadium’s sold out every single game. So it’s so great to see this city rally around a team that’s so new,” he said. “They’re all from California, Arizona, they’ve got palm trees, and I’m like you don’t know. You guys got to get out to a Current game, get out to anything in Kansas City, you’re going to love it.”\nSaturday is not the last time the Current will play in CPKC Stadium as they have already secured a home playoff match. Also, the NWSL announced the championship match in late November will be played there too. Fans are hopeful the team can continue to win and win and win to play for a chance to keep a trophy at home.\nThere have been some growing pains over the months of the season, as the team leadership can really only have themselves to learn from with it being the only women’s professional sports stadium in the entire world, but they are still optimistic about how year one has gone.\nTransportation service improvements and looking deeper into their food and beverage operations to enhance the fan experience overall will be looked at eventually.\n“This was all shiny and new and it’s beautiful and amazing and we want it to be that much better next year,” said Welniak.\nSaturday’s match was also a celebration event for midfielder Desiree “The Destroyer” Scott. Her 18-year career, 311 career matches for both Club and Country, were highlighted before the start as a large picture of her hanging above the south goal. Scott spent seven professional seasons in KC.\n“The Destroyer” hand bands were distributed to fans as they entered CPKC Stadium and the team honored her after the final whistle.\nCopyright 2024 KCTV.
