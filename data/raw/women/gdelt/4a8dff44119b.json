  "body_text": "UCF has offered athletics director Terry Mohajir a two-year contract extension, multiple sources have told the Sentinel.\nThe deal, which was first reported by Brandon Helwig of UCFSports.com, would keep Mohajir with the school through June 30, 2029. It would be the second extension he’s received since being named UCF AD on Feb. 8, 2021.\nHe initially received a 5-year deal that also contained a two-year option. That option was picked up in 2022, according to a report by the Sons of UCF, extending his current contract through June 2027. The report also states that Mohajir is set to make $1 million annually through the 2025-26 season and that figure increases to $1.2 million for the next two years.\nNo financial details have been released on the new extension.\nMohajir’s name has been linked to recent job openings at South Carolina and Maryland. He previously served as AD at Arkansas State from 2012-21.\nSince his arrival, Mohajir has played a pivotal role in the school’s transition from the American Athletic Conference to the Big 12. He also worked with Orange County officials to help secure $90 million in funding from the Tourism Development Tax, which has allowed the school to expand the Roth Tower attached to the Acrisure Bounce House. The 58,000-square-foot expansion is part of a multi-phase football campus project that is expected to include a new promenade, a football operations building and a recovery cove.\nUCF reveals fall 2025 football roster with updated jersey numbers\nHe has hired several coaches during his tenure, including Gus Malzahn (football), Sytia Messer (women’s basketball), Matt Botsford (volleyball), Lloyd Bruce-Burgess (men’s tennis), Mara Allen (rowing) and most recently Scott Frost (football).\nThe athletic department recently announced it had generated an all-time high in fundraising, with $52.8 million in cash and commitments for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. The football program has sold out its season ticket sales over the past few seasons.\nMohajir is the 11th athletics director in the school’s history, and if he completes his contract, he will match Steve Sloan’s record for the longest-serving AD, with a tenure of nine years.\nPlease find me on X, Bluesky or Instagram @osmattmurschel.
