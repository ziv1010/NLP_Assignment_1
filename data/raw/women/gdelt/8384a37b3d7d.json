Feminists hold a strong belief that patriarchy harms everyone, including men, and that liberation will be had by all when we dismantle patriarchy and the sexist oppression it props up. Despite that, feminists remain seen by some as little... -\nIt’s the Skytanic! Plans revealed for world’s largest plane — it’s a whopping 356 feet long (wind farm turbine blade transport)\nCall it the Skytanic.

With a potential carrying capacity of 80 tons, it will... -\nIn Venomous Rant, Scarborough Supports Schumer's Call For Israeli Regime Change\nFor my sins, over the years I've suffered through countless Joe Scarborough rants. In recent times, Donald Trump has, of course, been Scarborough's favorite target. But for sheer anger and vitriol, it would be hard to match Scarborough's tirade against Benjamin Netanyahu at the opening of today's Morning Joe. Scarborough attacked Netanyahu for purposes of defending Chuck Schumer's shocking speech on the Senate floor yesterday, calling for regime change in Israel and the ejection of Netanyahu as Israeli Prime Minister. Scarborough had the chutzpah to depict himself as the virtual True Defender of Israel, a veritable modern-day Judah Maccabee. He... -\nBiden admin funnels $1 billion for climate programs at borders amid ongoing migrant crisis\nThe Biden administration is funneling $1 billion in taxpayer funds to America's northern and southern borders to make dozens of federal ports of entry more climate friendly. The General Services Administration (GSA) announced it would direct Inflation Reduction Act funds to support the climate initiatives at the border, even as the ongoing surge of migrants strains federal resources. While GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan and Andrew Mayock, President Biden's Federal Buy Clean Task Force co-chair, said the action would reduce \"harmful emissions,\" the move was slammed by Republicans and experts. “As usual, the Biden administration is refusing to address a problem... -\nAmerica First Legal’s Litigation Against Biden State Department Unearths Orwellian, Internal USAID “Disinformation Primer”\nToday, America First Legal (AFL) released documents from litigation against the U.S. Department of State’s Global Engagement Center (GEC), exposing the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)’s internal “Disinformation Primer.” Foundation for Freedom Online (FFO), founded by Mike Benz, analyzed these documents and discovered that: The US Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Center on Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance (DRG) created an internal “Disinformation Primer” that revealed the agency’s explicit praise for private sector censorship strategies and proposed additional censorship practices and techniques; USAID’s censorship proposals were aimed at influencing private-sector technology companies, media organizations, education ministries, national governments,... -\nUS appeals court temporarily pauses SEC climate disclosure rules\nMarch 15 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday temporarily paused new rules issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requiring public companies to report climate-related risks. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted request for an administrative stay of the rules roughly a week after oilfield services companies Liberty Energy Inc. and Nomad Proppant Services LLC filed a lawsuit challenging them.

It’s funny how things work. Last year at this time, Americans overwhelmingly supported a ban on TikTok. Polls showed a 50-22% overall margin in support of a ban and 70-14% among conservatives. But Congress couldn’t get the RESTRICT Act passed. >As the public learned more about provisions in the bill, and particularly since the outbreak of hostilities in Gaza, the legislative plan grew less popular. Polls dropped to 38-27% in favor by December, and they’re at 35-31% against now. Yet... -\nExpert Says Gaza Seaport is to Facilitate Mass Migration of Palestinians to Europe\nA Middle Eastern expert says the “hidden objective” behind the U.S. building a seaport in Gaza is to facilitate the mass migration of Palestinians to Europe. President Joe Biden announced during his State of the Union speech last week that the U.S. Military would establish an “emergency mission to establish a port in the Gaza Strip” to get humanitarian aid to the Palestinian enclave. However, according to Hisham Khreisat, a Jordanian military and strategic affairs expert, “the floating port off the shores of Gaza is a humanitarian facade hiding voluntary migration to Europe.” “This military tactical port will receive Israeli... -\nThat's forbidden love! ALAN DERSHOWITZ slams Georgia judge for letting DA Fani Willis continue her war on Trump despite paying her 'lover' with taxpayer dollars... it's more proof of America's rotten justice\nWho will guard against the corruption of some of America's guardians? No one, apparently. Not in Georgia anyway. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, adjudicating over the state's election interference case against Donald Trump, has essentially let District Attorney Fani Willis off the hook. Willis has been prosecuting the sprawling racketeering case against the former president and 18 other co-defendants. That was until proceedings were abruptly halted in early January when it was revealed that she had engaged in a secret romance with the special prosecutor she appointed for the trial. After weeks of silence, Willis and her now-former... -\nMichael Imperioli (Sopranos/ GoodFellas) and others eject an annoying activist from theatre (w video)\nBREAKING NEWS: Goodfellas and Sopranos actor removes activist from Broadway theatre in a no nonsense, Christopher Moltisanti style, reaction.

Stepan Glebov was the collateral damage of Peter’s ferocious conflict with his ill-favored crown prince Tsarevich Alexei — the whelp who had only recently been repatriated to his glowering father after fleeing Russia altogether, to cap a lifetime of letting dad down. Alexei was back in Peter’s clutches, and a few months from the events in this post would be shockingly knouted to death at Peter’s orders. This Freudian clash also mapped sharply onto Russia’s political schisms (and many of the... -\nPlanet Fitness does it again\nPatricia Silva of Fairbanks, Alaska recently recorded a video after she made a startling discovery in the Planet Fitness locker room.\"There's a man in the woman's locker room shaving, a little girl sitting in the corner,\" Silva detailed. \"She could have been 12 years old, in a towel, kind of freaked out that there's a man shaving in her locker room.\"Silva took a picture of the man and confronted him, but he assured her that his presence in the locker room was okay because of his sexuality.
