  "body_text": "Another installment of the Oregon State mailbag, where readers ask questions about Beavers athletics and The Oregonian/OregonLive’s Nick Daschel provides a response.\nLet’s go.\nIn your opinion, how does this Caitlin Clark story play out this weekend in Albany, NY? – Ed H\nThe TV folks are certainly hoping Clark’s Iowa Hawkeyes match last year’s run, where it ended in the NCAA championship game. With each game Iowa plays, viewership records for women’s basketball games are set. Albany is buzzing with a potential LSU-Iowa rematch in Monday’s regional final. My prediction is the Iowa story ends in Albany. The Hawkeyes will get all they want Saturday from a Colorado team hardened by a difficult Pac-12 schedule. The Buffaloes can win this game. If not Colorado, then either LSU or UCLA in the regional final. Frankly, the Big Ten was not that strong this season, and it’s showing up in the NCAAs.\nI saw where OSU/WSU will be on the CW network. CW doesn’t have its own sports broadcasting operation, so that will likely be done by the Pac12 Network. Question: Will CW then pay the network for the production of those game broadcasts? -- @scorobe1\nDetails still to be worked out, but multiple reports have CW with the inside track on televising OSU and WSU home football games this upcoming season. Utilizing Pac-12 Network assets only makes sense.\nIn an effort to get adjusted to East coast time and the fact our game Friday is at 11:30 AM, did Rueck try to do anything like having team go to bed at 7:00 pm and wake up at 4:00 am for the few days prior to heading east? – Jim C\nI’m not aware of that. What Oregon State did, though, was leave a day earlier than usual for New York. Typically for a Friday NCAA game, the team flies Wednesday. Oregon State flew from Eugene on Tuesday. The team was able to sleep in Wednesday morning and gradually adjust to the time difference. Also, is 11:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. EDT) really all that early? The Beavers routinely play Sunday regular season games at noon.\nShould we be scared about (Scott) Barnes leaving? – Brandon\nNo. This isn’t a Pat Chun situation. Barnes, 61, appears set on making Oregon State the final athletic director job of his working career.\nIf (Wayne) Tinkle had a good year this last year, do you think Stanford would have gone after him? – Max C\nI do not.\nWho’s been the biggest surprise and most improved on Beaver WBB this year? @SBeav\nI wouldn’t say surprise, because improvement is expected every year from young players. I’d say the upgrade in Timea Gardiner’s overall play has been a welcome development. No one would have put Gardiner in the category of lockdown defender at the start of the season. Her progress on defense has been remarkable. In addition, Gardiner has become a tenacious rebounder and reliable three-point threat.\nIs there really any academic or college credit concern for universities receiving a portal player? I don’t hear of players dropping out due to academics. But there must be, right? Is there a Big 10 or SEC school that has an amazing graduate rate for athletes? With that do you know the graduate rate of OSU and WSU athletes? -- Scott G\nTransfers must qualify for enrollment at schools, and not all do. Oregon State, in fact, has had a couple football players this past year who committed to transfer but couldn’t get into school. As for graduation rates, has there ever been a time when this is less relevant? With all the player movement, who is going to keep that scorecard?\nDo we Have any reason to believe that the PAC 2 will sign a short-term TV rights deal? Get them in front of more eyes for the future? – Alexander N\nAs mentioned above, it appears CW wants to televise the games. The key isn’t money in this instance. It’s a network capable of showing Oregon State on as many television screens as possible for the next two years. The Beavers have short term money. What they need now is continued exposure.\nAny word if (Jordan) Pope will transfer? – Cody\nWe’re nearly two weeks into the transfer portal period, and so far, so good. My two cents? Pope loves Oregon State, but that doesn’t mean he’ll be in Corvallis next year. I think he stays unless another school back channels an offer so strong that he can’t say no.\nNick Daschel covers Oregon State athletics, in particular football and basketball, and can be reached at 360-607-4824, ndaschel@oregonian.com or @nickdaschel.\nOur journalism needs your support.
