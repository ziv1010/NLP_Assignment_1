During the struggle, the suspect was also shot and is currently being treated at the same hospital, police reported.\nBoard of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin said he was briefed by a police captain who confirmed that Pearsall resisted his assailant, resulting in the suspect being wounded with his own gun.\nSee more S.F. Chronicle on Google\n“He wasn’t having any of it,” the captain told Peskin.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nPolice Chief Bill Scott confirmed at a press conference that only one firearm was involved and the suspect acted alone, noting that no evidence suggests Pearsall was targeted for being a football player. He declined to specify the item the suspect attempted to steal.\n“We have a good idea (but) we’re not ready to release that at this time,” Scott said.\nThe 49ers issued a statement expressing that Pearsall was in serious but stable condition.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n“We ask that you please respect his privacy at this time. Our thoughts and prayers are with Ricky and the entire Pearsall family,” it added.\nJohn Lynch, the 49ers' general manager, is at the hospital to support Pearsall, a team source said. Members of the 49ers' medical, security personnel and player engagement staff were also at the hospital.\nMayor London Breed described the incident as a \"terrible and rare occurrence\" for Union Square, emphasizing San Francisco's relatively low violent crime rates but acknowledged that “the data goes out the window sometimes when something happens like this.”\nDespite this, police presence in the area will be increased.\nThe San Francisco Fire Department reported that the first 911 call about shots fired came in at 3:28 p.m. on Saturday.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nWitnesses reported hearing shots and seeing people running and screaming. A Union Square security guard saw a man run into the Diptyque store carrying bags, followed by the sound of three shots.\nA witness reported being at a Kearny Street stoplight when he heard about five shots and saw six women running. He saw Pearsall with blood streaming down his left arm. The witness noted that police ran toward the victim, not the suspect, which he found unusual.\n“It was a scary situation,” said the witness, who requested anonymity.\nHours after the shooting, five shell casings remained on the ground at Geary and Grant streets. About a dozen police officers surveyed the scene, dusting two Teslas, one black and one gray, for fingerprints.\nFor those wondering after the Ricky Pearsall shooting, here are San Francisco's year-to-date crime stats.\n— Demian Bulwa (@demianbulwa) September 1, 2024\nHomicides are down so far that they may set a new low in the modern era — back to at least '85.\nRobbery down 22%, larceny down 43%, burglary down 14%, car boosting down 18% pic.twitter.com/GywP7qeHEY\nSan Francisco has relatively low rates of violent crime but high rates of property crime.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe city's overall reported crime rate during the first four months of this year was the lowest since at least 2018, according to a May report by the Chronicle.\nRecent declines reflect in part a significant drop in reported property crimes and larceny theft, including in the Financial District/South Beach neighborhood, which includes Union Square.\nThis year the overall crime rate is down significantly: As of Aug. 25, the number of reported crimes had decreased by 33% compared to the same period last year, with robbery reports falling by 22%.\n“Sadly gun violence happens all over America, but when we have one instance of gun violence in Union Square, it gets all the attention,” said Peskin, who is also a candidate for mayor. “It is horrible, it is tragic, it is frightening, but it is rare.”\nSan Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said her office is expected to make a charging decision by Tuesday or Wednesday.\nIn a statement, she expressed gratitude to the police department, saying, “We cannot and will not tolerate senseless crime in San Francisco, and my office will ensure that there is accountability.”\nPearsall had been signing autographs earlier Saturday at the Cow Palace.\nThe San Francisco 49ers invested their top selection in April’s NFL draft in Pearsall, a wide receiver from the University of Florida, aiming to provide another target for quarterback Brock Purdy.\nHowever, the 23-year-old faced injury setbacks during training camp. Shoulder and hamstring issues limited him to six of the 19 practices, and he missed all three preseason games.\nPearsall, selected 31st overall, returned to practice on Monday but was still wearing a non-contact jersey and a sleeve on his left shoulder during Thursday’s final practice of the week. His status for the season opener on Sept. 9 against the Jets at Levi’s Stadium remained uncertain.\n49ers players expressed relief that Pearsall was in stable condition. Wide receiver Deebo Samuel posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday, “He’s good. Thank God.”\nHe’s good🤞🏾🙏🏾. Thank god!!!!\n— Deebo (@19problemz) September 1, 2024\nOther contenders in San Francisco's mayoral race condemned the violence and emphasized the need for safer streets, reflecting the community’s concern and desire for change.\nDaniel Lurie denounced the “senseless violence,” while Supervisor Ahsha Safaí tweeted that the shooting was “deeply troubling.”\nMark Farrell, in his tweet, stated: “Enough is enough. If we want public safety in San Francisco, then we need change in City Hall.”\nChris Navalta, a San Francisco resident, sports memorabilia collector, and lifelong 49ers fan, drove to the Cow Palace on Saturday to see Pearsall.\n“He had been injured during preseason and training camp, so this was the only time we got to see him in any capacity,” Navalta said.\nPearsall signed his rookie card shortly after 1 p.m. and expressed his appreciation to Navalta, saying, “Thanks for coming out today.”\nThe two took a photo together, and Pearsall mentioned that he too was a gamer, like Navalta, who works in the video game industry.\nNavalta left the show by 2 p.m., and by that time, Pearsall’s table had cleared out.\nHours later, Navalta read about the shooting.\n“I was absolutely shocked,” said Navalta, who lives near Union Square. “It also hit a nerve for me. I lost my nephew to gun violence 10 years ago, so hearing that he had been shot literally just hours after I had interacted with him really shocked me to my core.”\nEric Branch, Matthias Gafni and Warren Pederson contributed to this report.\nReach Chase DiFeliciantonio: chase.difeliciantonio@sfchronicle.com; Twitter: @ChaseDiFelice.
