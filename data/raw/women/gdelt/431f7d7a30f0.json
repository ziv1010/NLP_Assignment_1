  "body_text": "England Women’s preparations for the 2023 Women’s World Cup continue on Tuesday night with a game against Australia at the Brentford Community Stadium.\nIf Thursday’s tense showdown at Wembley was a perfect warm-up for the harsh and nervous world of tournament football, then this next game could bring them even closer to the real thing.\nAdvertisement\nIf England win their World Cup group and Australia finish runners-up in theirs, or vice versa, Sarina Wiegman’s side will face the co-hosts in the round of 16.\nEngland are in a group with Haiti, Denmark and China, while Australia will face the Republic of Ireland, Nigeria and Canada.\nTuesday’s friendly between the Lionesses and Matildas feels crucial for both sides. The European champions will be heading to the World Cup with huge expectations and a target on their back. Australia will naturally have their own pressures as co-hosts of the tournament, with superstar forward Sam Kerr as the face of the event.\nFor England, Tuesday is a chance to fix the errors that caused them all sorts of problems in the Finalissima and ultimately allowed Brazil a way back into the game. Brazil’s tactical shift from a 5-3-2 to 4-4-2 gave them an extra body and edge in the second half, trapping England in their own half and forcing them to play out from the back, which they didn’t do effectively.\nEngland captain Leah Williamson admitted her team were “sloppy” and failed to recognise the pressure from their opponents. It wasn’t just poor passing and turnovers under pressure, England missed some big goalscoring opportunities, chances that will need to be taken when it’s knockout football.\nThursday’s game also showcased just how crucial Millie Bright is to this England side. Williamson and Alex Greenwood are still a strong centre-back partnership but Bright brings a much-needed calmness, physicality and confidence on the ball that was missing against Brazil. Her experience and assuredness also feeds into the rest of the back line. Jess Carter filling in at left back made a weakened back line even more vulnerable.\nGreenwood has since dropped out of the squad and returned to Manchester City for treatment and her absence on Tuesday will mean another major adjustment for Wiegman’s back line. Niamh Charles could come in and play at left-back to allow Carter to shift into centre back alongside Williamson. Lotte Wubben-Moy could play alongside club team-mate Williamson, as could Maya Le Tissier or even Lucy Parker, who would be making her England debut.\nWhatever defence Wiegman opts for, it won’t be an ideal scenario for World Cup rehearsals. Bright has been a core part of Wiegman’s side and the defender had played in nearly all of England’s games under the head coach, even some of the easier, one-sided World Cup qualifiers. The full extent of Bright’s knee injury is unclear — she is expected to play again before the end of the season but for now, England without the ever-resilient Bright is one of the biggest tests Wiegman has faced.\nAdvertisement\nAustralia head into this friendly after their seven-game winning streak was ended by defeat against Scotland on Friday.\nThe Matildas are depleted by injuries to key players Steph Catley, Alanna Kennedy, Caitlin Foord, Elise Kellond-Knight, Emily Gielnik and Clare Wheeler. The 1-0 defeat to Scotland was a bit of a shock but perhaps summed up how unpredictable this team can be at times. Australia missed a ton of chances in Friday’s game and that’s not necessarily surprising given Kerr sat out the game. She’s sure to feature on Tuesday and given how much she loves the big occasion, will be relishing the chance to take on a potentially shaky England defence and one without her Chelsea team-mate Bright.\nAustralia are building momentum and, given their injury issues, defeat to Scotland shouldn’t set them back too much. The familiarity for plenty of the Matildas and England players, who are team-mates or regular opponents in the WSL, should make this match-up even more entertaining.\nThe last time much of this England team faced Australia was in a chaotic quarter-final for Team GB at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Team GB lost the game 4-3 in extra time and the match featured a host of defensive errors and an Ellen White hat-trick. Plenty has changed since then.\nThe key for England, off the back of a straightforward World Cup qualification campaign and Arnold Clark Cup victory, is to learn some important lessons from all of their friendly games in the lead-up to this summer. England want to be tested and forced to solve problems and the Finalissima was the perfect first step.\nEngland’s impressive unbeaten run, now at 30 games, will come to an end at some point, but it would be some shock if it happened on Tuesday. Even so, Australia are the perfect, tricky opponents to potentially unsettle England and give them a taste of what’s to come this summer.\nFollow the Women’s World Cup coverage on The Athletic for related stories, news and more.\n(Top photo: Getty Images)",
