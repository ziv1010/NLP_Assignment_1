This would be a game-changer for the city, wider East Midlands region and beyond.\n“The success of England’s Lionesses, including the East Midlands’ very own Mary Earps and Millie Bright, has shown how sport has the power to bring people together. I am passionate about women’s football and the positive social and economic impact it has for our region and country. I look forward to continuing my work with Nottingham City Council and other partners to turn this incredible opportunity into a reality.”\nThe council also says there will be an opportunity to bring in money from businesses, and through a proposed tourist tax.\nNottingham would then have nearly a decade to plan and budget for hosting duties, with major expenditure not required until 2032 to 2033.\nNottingham Forest Football Club said the city council would be speaking on behalf of stakeholders when approached for comment.",
