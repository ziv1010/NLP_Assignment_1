The soccer player learned the sad news after the World Cup final,\" the Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF) said in a statement in Spanish.\n\"We send our most sincere hugs to Olga and her family in a moment of deep pain.\n\"We love you, Olga, you are the history of Spanish football.\"\nAnd without knowing it, I had my Star before the game started. I know that you gave me the strength to achieve something unique. I know that you were watching me tonight and that you are proud of me. Rest in peace, dad.Olga Carmona (@7olgacarmona) on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.\nDespite playing as left-back Carmona produced heroic goals in both the semi-final and final for Spain.\nOn Sunday night Carmona's venomous left-footed strike in the 29th minute delivered Spain the lead before Mary Earps saved Jenni Hermoso's 69th-minute penalty to keep European champions England's hopes alive.\nBut Spain, whose entire campaign has been overshadowed by last year's player revolt and a subsequent cloud hanging over coach Jorge Vilda, held on in front of 75,784 fans at Stadium Australia to claim football immortality.\nThe Spanish mutiny included 15 players stepping away from the national team, citing concerns over under-investment and Vilda's allegedly authoritarian approach to management - and only three have returned.\nSpain has consistently closed ranks throughout the tournament regarding their internal unrest.\nWhether it will remain that way with the job done is yet to be seen.\nSpain's football federation posted a photo of Vilda kissing the trophy with the caption \"VILDA IN\".\n\"I am proud of this team, very happy for all the people who are following us, that we have made them happy,\" Vilda told Spanish media.\n\"We have shown that we know how to suffer, this team has believed and we are world champions.\"\nLa Roja's triumph condemned Lionesses boss Sarina Wiegman to a second consecutive final defeat after she previously lost the decider with the Netherlands against the USA in 2019.\nWiegman is the only coach to lose two finals.\n\"We gave our everything, we did everything we could,\" she said.\n\"We tried different tactics but I have to give credit to Spain. I think that Spain was the team throughout the tournament that played the best football.\"\nSpain dropped two-time Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas for teen sensation Salma Paralluelo, while England didn't start Lauren James on her return from suspension, sticking with an unchanged line-up.\nParalluelo, who becomes the first player to win U17, U20 and senior Women's World Cups and was named young player of the tournament, gave England headaches from the opening minutes.",
