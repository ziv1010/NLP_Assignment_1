The merger’s been a long time coming and is very positive for football on the southern peninsula,” he said.\n“I’m very happy that it’s finally happening and it will be a really decent-sized club.”\nThe merger statement highlighted the on-field and off-field advantages to be gleaned from the creation of a powerhouse southern peninsula club.\n“Both clubs recognise the strengths that come from unity and the benefits of creating a clear pathway for junior players to progress into senior football.\n“Coming together as one club places us in a stronger position to plan for the facilities required for a growing and ambitious football community.”\nOne of the young guns expected to figure prominently in the new Rosebud United is current Rosebud ace Barney Johnson.\n“It’s always good especially in a community club like Rosebud to have a proper pathway for players to move from junior to senior football,” he said.\n“Having played at Mornington and at the clubs I played for in the UK there was definitely that element that was missing.\n“It’s a really exciting time for the club as it’s the southernmost club on the peninsula with no real competition and a great opportunity to grow.”\nThe Chichester-born 22-year-old arrived in Melbourne seven years ago and immediately got involved in the local scene.\nHe joined Mornington where he was coached in the under-15s by his current senior coach Symonds.\nJohnson progressed to the reserves and trained regularly with the seniors under head coach Adam Jamieson but senior game time remained elusive.\n“I had a heart-to-heart talk with ‘Jamo’ and we both felt I’d benefit from senior game time elsewhere.”\nThat prompted a switch to Rosebud in January 2023, the season in which the seniors finished fourth after a controversial points deduction.\nRosebud left nothing to chance the following season winning the State 5 South title by a comfortable margin.\n“Winning the title last year was made even more exciting given the setback the previous year and to see the reaction of senior players who had never won a title before put things into perspective for me and made me realise what an achievement it really was.”\nFinishing in the top six this year retained Rosebud’s league status for next season when teams from State 4 East join to form a new State 4 South-East division that is certain to be ultra competitive.\nIt’s a challenge that Johnson openly embraces.\n“I’ll definitely be at Rosebud next year and we pride ourselves on the good blend we’ve established between younger guys and more experienced players.\n“Our goal is promotion – if you’re not going for promotion you shouldn’t really be playing at all and we’ll give it our best shot that’s for sure.”\nStill in State 4 and Chelsea announced a number of major new signings last week laying bare its championship aspirations.\nRetaining the most prolific scorer on the peninsula in James Stinson was quickly followed by announcing the captures of Michael Swinnerton, Marcus Anastasiou and Victor Cruz De Faria.\nThe versatile Swinnerton has captained Collingwood City at State 1 level, Anastasiou has been Somerville Eagles’ star striker for the past few seasons while central midfielder Cruz De Faria has captained Monash University.\nIn other news Football Victoria released the NPL, VPL and provisional State League fixtures last week.\nLangwarrin plays its first three games at home then its next five away due to council works on Lawton Park.\nLangy gets the season underway on Saturday 14 February against Noth Sunshine Eagles.\nThe under-20s kick off at 2.15pm, the under 23s at 4.30pm and the seniors at 7pm.\nChelsea kicks off the 2026 State League for local clubs on Friday 20 March hosting East Kew (6.30pm & 8pm).\nRemaining fixtures for local clubs are all on Saturday 21 March.\nMornington is at home to Collingwood City (ground, KO times to be decided); Skye United hosts Mazenod (1pm & 3pm); Peninsula Strikers host Waverley City (12.45pm & 3pm); Baxter hosts Albert Park (1pm & 3pm); Rosebud hosts Ashburton (4pm & 6pm); Somerville Eagles host Fortuna 60 (1pm & 3pm); Seaford United is away to Sandown Lions (1pm & 3pm); Frankston Pines hosts Mentone (4pm & 6pm); Mount Eliza is away to Old Ivanhoe (1pm & 3pm); Aspendale is away to Croydon Ranges (ground, KO times to be decided); and Mount Martha is away to Keysborough (5pm & 7pm).\nIn pre-season news Langwarrin suffered a body blow with star recruit Zach Bates fracturing his fibula and ankle in Tuesday’s 1-0 home loss to Box Hill United.\nBates has had surgery and is expected to miss most of the first half of next season.\n“While Zac is a massive loss as he was a key signing we have other options who will now get an opportunity to make a contribution,” head coach Jamie Skelly said.\nOn Saturday morning Langy’s pre-Christmas friendly against Melbourne City at Lawton Park ended in a 3-0 loss but Skelly remained upbeat.\n“This was another opportunity to build our fitness and new game style,” he said.\n“And there were some really positive signs.\n“We got good minutes into players and also took another opportunity for younger players to get some exposure against a top side.”\nOn Saturday afternoon Skye United beat Casey Comets 3-1 at Comets Stadium.\nThe match highlight was the hat-trick to Skye triallist Marcus Spivey.\nThe big striker has been scoring for fun with Mentone for the past few seasons and has finally decided that the time is right for a move.\nSkye isn’t the only local club with Spivey on its radar.",
