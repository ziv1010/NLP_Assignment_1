Her existing deal had been due to expire next year, although the FA has long wanted to extend.\nWiegman was believed to be on a salary of £400,000 comparred to the £5m paid to male counterpart Gareth Southgate. FA chief executive Mark Bullingham detailed that he believes Wiegman to be the best women's coach anywhere in the world.\nThe historic appointment of Emma Hayes as new United States head coach made headlines as the 47-year-old is poised to receive equal pay with her men's team boss Gregg Berhalter, anticipated to be around £1.3m. Bullingham's remarks suggest that Wiegman's new salary is expected to be in line with that of the outgoing Chelsea manager.\n\"We see Sarina as the number one coach in the world in the women's game and we think that she's paid accordingly,\" he said. \"I don't know what other people in other federation's are paid, but I can say I think she's paid accordingly.\"\nWiegman added that she \"absolutley\" feels valued by the FA. \"Working for England, it is the biggest federation worldwide. England is at the highest level with the competition, with the players, with the way the FA approaches women's football,\" she added.\nWorld Cup heartache was a motivator for new deal\nWiegman admitted that the recent World Cup heartache was a driving factor in her choice to commit longer with the Lionesses. The two-time European champion has reached each of the last two World Cup finals. The first with the Netherlands and the latter ending in a devastating 1-0 defeat for England to Spain. The recent shortfalls of failing to progress past the Nations League group stage and secure Olympic qualification despite an emphatic 6-0 triumph over Scotland, also influenced her choice.\n\"I’m motivated anyway,\" she explained. \"Of course this motivates too. We had that disappointment, in the World Cup, we also won silver but we always want more. It’s very hard. Playing finals is not easy.\n\"I think we’ve done very well but you always want more and thrive for more growth. Grow the game and help players in their development. We still have very good connections and I see lots of growth in this team.\n\"I think we can go further. We also know that the world around us is improving a lot and very quickly too. We have to be at the top of our game and I really like these challenges.\"\nWiegman, favouring younger players, has a plethora of burgeoning talent at her fingertips that have not yet reached the pinnacle of their careers. Having given herself the next three years to develop their skills, the potential in the current squad was an attraction for agreeing to a longer term deal, with her sights set on another chance to clinch a World Cup title with England in 2027.\n\"There is so much potential. We have experienced players, young players coming in. The WSL is growing too. It is really nice to work in England and I see a lot of potential,\" she said.\nIt was the right time to commit three more years\nWiegman still had 18 months on her contract but decided now was the right time to sign a new deal.\n\"We have had conversations all the time,\" she said. \"I thought it was a good time to look a little ahead. I feel with this team we can grow so much more, I just wanted to do another tournament with this team too.\"\nWiegman was named Best FIFA Women's Coach for the fourth time on Monday - extending her own record - and is regarded as the most successful national team coach in women's football. Understandably, she might have considered exploring new options but dispelled the possibility.\n\"I don't think about my career too far ahead,\" she said. \"I am in the moment now, I am enjoying this job and I feel we can improve a lot. I didn't have doubts and I want to sty around a while longer.\n\"This is my home away from home. One of my personal goals was to try and get into another culture and learn about it and connect people, that remains a challenge but I feel at home.\"",
