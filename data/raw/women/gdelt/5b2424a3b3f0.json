  "body_text": "Trump ‘said men would think Stormy Daniels affair was cool’\nDonald Trump said stories of his alleged affair with Stormy Daniels would be a “disaster” with women but men would “think it’s cool”, Michael Cohen claimed.\nCohen, who acted as a “fixer” for the former president for a decade, said he was told to “take care” of the story while Mr Trump was running for president in 2016.\n“There was a lot going on at the campaign at the time”, Cohen told Mr Trump’s hush money trial in New York.\n“[Mr Trump] said ‘this is a disaster – a total disaster. Women will hate me. Guys – they’ll think it’s cool. But this is going to be a disaster for the campaign.’”\nCohen said that the then Republican-candidate was “polling very, very low with women” and that the affair story would have been “catastrophic”.\nProsecutors claim that Mr Trump falsified business records to conceal a $130,000 “hush money” payment made by Cohen to Ms Daniels, an adult film star.\n10:03 PM BST\nThat’s all for now\nThanks for following our coverage as the fourth week of Donald Trump’s “hush money” trial begin with Michael Cohen taking the witness stand. This live blog is now closed.\n09:38 PM BST\nTrump: ‘World is laughing’ at New York’s legal system\nDonald Trump has appeared outside the court with a sheaf of papers, apparently of news reports critical of the “hush money” trial.\n“This is more ways of keeping me from... campaigning,” he added. “The whole world is laughing now at the New York weaponised legal system,” he said at another point, claiming “every single legal analyst” believed “there’s no crime here”.\nHis voice rising as he once against attacked Juan Merchan, Mr Trump said: “We have a corrupt judge and we have a judge who’s highly conflicted and he’s keeping me from campaigning.”\n09:33 PM BST\nProceedings over for the day\nCourt has now adjourned for the day. Judge Juan Merchan is dismissing the jury.\n09:30 PM BST\nCohen ‘did not expect to be paid as personal counsel’\nMichael Cohen says there was no expectation he would be paid for his role as personal counsel to Donald Trump.\n“Did you have any expectation if you did work for him you’d be paid?”, Ms Hoffinger asked.\n“Not at all”, Cohen said.\n09:23 PM BST\nCohen repayment ‘would be for legal services’\nMichael Cohen said he thought he would receive the $420,000 as a lump sum but was told by Allen Weisselberg that it would be paid over the course of 12 months.\nIt would be recorded as “a legal service rendered since I was then going to be given the title of personal attorney to the president,” Cohen told the court.\n09:20 PM BST\n‘This is gonna one heck of a ride’\n“I just wanted to get my money back”, Michael Cohen said.\nHe said he went to Mr Trump’s office to speak to him about it.\n“What was he engaged in?”, prosecution lawyer Ms Hoffinger asked.\n“Being president elect”, Cohen replied.\nMore in Politics\nHe said during the meeting, Weisselburg turned to him and said they were going to pay the $420,000 fee over 12 months.\nThe payments would be put down as “legal services” because he was going to be “given the title as personal attorney to the president”.\nHe said they would “start making the payments in February not January because there’s a lot going on with Mr Trump moving to DC for the inauguration”.\nAsked what Mr Trump said, Cohen added: “He approved it and he said ‘this is gonna be one heck of a ride in DC’”.\n09:16 PM BST\n‘Trump didn’t deserve the difference’\nCohen said he actually paid Red Finch less than $50,000.\nBut, he said, he “didn’t think Mr Trump deserved the difference”. He ended up keeping the money.\nHe was also offered a $60,000 additional bonus.\n”It was still short of what I expected… he [Mr Trump] thought this was an amount that would make it right”, Cohen said.\n09:15 PM BST\nCohen details alleged repayment deal\nCohen said he went into Allen Weisselberg’s office and asked him about his repayment for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n“He said to me: ‘let’s sit down… let’s do it’”, Cohen said.\nCohen said Mr Weisslberg asked him to bring him a copy of the $130,000 payment.\nCohen was also owed $50,000 for paying Red Finch, which was for purchasing IP addresses “that sort of thing”.\nWeisselberg told him to “include everything” on the repayment as he no longer had a role at the Trump Organisation.\nBecause he was in the 50 per cent tax bracket they needed to “gross up” the payment otherwise he would have been short changed.\n“If they gave me the $180,000 and they didn’t gross it up… it would be $90,000”, Mr Cohen said.\n09:09 PM BST\nCourt shown Weisselberg repayment document\nThe court was shown a document on which prosecutors say Allen Weisselberg worked out how Michael Cohen wold be repaid for the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels.\n“I recognise the handwriting but I was also there in the room when he was writing,” Cohen said.\n09:06 PM BST\nTrump ‘said not to worry about bonus’\nDonald Trump called Michael Cohen from Mar-a-Lago and said “don’t worry about the other thing, we’re going to take care of it when we come back”.\nCohen said Mr Trump was referring to his bonus.\n09:01 PM BST\n‘Beyond angry, truly insulted, personally hurt’\nCohen said he was “beyond angry” when in December 2016 Mr Trump cut his bonus by two thirds.\nHe said he was “even for myself unusually angry”.\n“I was angry, beyond angry, he cut my bonus by two thirds”, he told the jury.\nHe said he was “truly insulted, personally hurt…. after all I’d gone through… laying out $130,000 on his behalf to protect him… it was insulting that the gratitude shown back to me was to cut my bonus by two thirds.”\nCohen said he spoke to Mr Pecker about it.\n“It wasn’t so much about the number as much as it was about the disrespect that came with it”, he told the court.\n“I was just personally insulted.”\n09:00 PM BST\nCohen ‘angry’ when bonus was cut\nMichael Cohen said he was “very angry” when his bonus was cut by two-thirds in 2016. “I didn’t expect more,” he said. “But I certainly didn’t expect less.”\n08:57 PM BST\nCohen’s daughter ‘concerned when he was turned down’\nThe jury has been shown text messages between Cohen and his daughter Samantha in which they discuss his future.\n“My daughter and I are very close… she was concerned I was upset I wasn’t considered for the role”, Cohen said.\nHe said his future job would be a “hybrid” role which would still give him access to Mr Trump but he would “still be able to monetise my relationship and my ability with these various different companies.”\n08:54 PM BST\nCohen ‘disappointed when turned down for chief of staff’\nMichael Cohen said he didn’t want the role of White House chief of staff but his ego was hurt when he wasn’t recommended for the job.\nHe said he wasn’t going to have a continuing role at the Trump Organisation.\n“My service was no longer necessary because I was special counsel to Mr Trump and he was now president elect”, Cohen said.\nHe said there had been discussions about him becoming assistant general counsel, but he didn’t want that role.\nAsked whether he was considered for chief of staff, he said: “No ma’am”.\nAsked whether this was disappointing, he replied: “Yes”.\n“I didn’t want the role, I didn’t believe the role was right for me… I just wanted my name to be included”, Cohen said.\n“I had other ideas for myself that I wanted… it was more about my ego than anything.”\n08:43 PM BST\nTrump team were ‘praying’ after McDougal story published\nWe’re looking at the texts between Cohen and Hope Hicks again about the WSJ story about Ms McDougal’s hush money deal again.\nCohen put on his glasses to read the texts from the monitor, before quickly whipping them off again.\n“The concern was again that this story would explode into a massive issue and we were monitoring… the traction… we were hoping, praying”, he said.\n08:23 PM BST\nMcDougal article ‘was a real serious problem’\nThe jury was shown a call log which showed Cohen speaking to Donald Trump on his bodyguard Keith Schiller’s phone on 4 November 2016 for five minutes and 55 seconds.\nThe pair spoke about the WSJ article.\n“This was a real serious, again, problem, especially as it was so close to the election day”, Cohen said.\n“I told him exactly who I’d spoken to” adding that he said they would do “everything in our power to protect Mr Trump.”\nHe agreed that Mr Trump was angry and upset.\nAsked why, he said: “Because there was a negative story that once again could impact the campaign as a result of women.”\nThe court is now taking a short break.\n08:22 PM BST\nCourt takes short break\nThe court is now taking a short afternoon break.\n08:21 PM BST\nTrump ‘really angry’ about Karen McDougal article\n“I wanted to ensure Mr Trump was safe,” Cohen said, referring to after the Wall Street Journal article about hush money payments to Karen McDougal surfaced.\n“He was really angry,” he added.\n08:15 PM BST\n‘Finished, accomplished, done’\nMichael Cohen’s desire to please Mr Trump - and get credit for solving his problems - has shone throughout his testimony.\nCohen said he “immediately” told Mr Trump when he had the signed agreement from Ms Daniels “so he would know the matter, the task he gave to me, was finished, accomplished and done”.\n08:03 PM BST\nCohen ‘immediately let Trump know about Daniels deal’\nMichael Cohen said he “immediately” let Donald Trump know that he had secured a signed non-disclosure agreement from Stormy Daniels.\n08:00 PM BST\nCourt shown wire transfer to Daniels lawyer\nThe court has been shown a wire transfer from Michael Cohen’s shell company to Keith Davidson, Stormy Daniels’ lawyer.\nIt is listed as a retainer - which Cohen said was inaccurate. It was really to “pay Stormy Daniels to execute the non-disclosure agreement and to obtain the story”, he said.\n07:59 PM BST\nCohen ‘needed Trump’s approval before paying hush money’\nCohen said he had several conversations with Donald Trump before he opened the bank account to make the $130,000 payment for Stormy Daniels’ story.\n“I wanted to ensure that once again he approved what I was doing because I require approval from him on all of this,” Mr Cohen said.\nCohen said he wouldn’t have gone through with the hush money payment had Mr Trump not approved it.\n“Everything required Mr Trump’s sign-off, on top of that I wanted the money back,” he said.\n07:53 PM BST\nCohen is calm and collected - but what about the cross-examination?\nCohen’s testimony today seems to be going as well as the prosecution could hope.\nHe’s calm, collected and answering prosecutor Susan Hoffinger’s questions succinctly.\nWe will have to wait and see how he fares on cross-examination.\nWill the temper the jury has heard so much about spill out?\n07:48 PM BST\nCohen: I couldn’t tell wife about porn star hush money payment\nCohen said he had to set up the limited company to make the payment to Ms Daniels as he could not use his joint bank account with his wife.\n“I clearly could not tell her. That would’ve been a problem for me”, Cohen said, prompting laughs in the court’s overflow room.\n07:45 PM BST\nPecker ‘refused to pay off Daniels’\nMichael Cohen said he asked David Pecker if he would make the alleged “hush money” payment to Stormy Daniels. The tabloid boss is said to have responded: “Not a chance.”\nMr Pecker has previously testified that he had not been reimbursed for payments to Karen McDougal and a Trump Tower doorman, and was not willing to buy Ms Daniels’ story.\n07:39 PM BST\n‘I was doing everything to protect my boss’\n“I was doing everything I could and more in order to protect my boss”, Cohen told the jury.\nHe would not, however, pay $130,000 for an NDA needed for somebody else, he said.\n07:38 PM BST\nTrump executive ‘suggested Cohen send money to Daniels’\nAllen Weisselberg eventually said that Michael Cohen put forward the money to Stormy Daniels, Cohen told the court.\nWeisselberg had apparently previously suggested American Media, Inc - which allegedly paid $150,000 to Karen McDougal for her story and $30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to know of a lovechild fathered by Donald Trump.\nProsecutors claim that Weisselberg later worked out how much Cohen would be reimbursed for the $130,000 “hush money” payment.\nAmong his other suggestions were apparently that they use a golf club membership to put someone else’s name on the payment - but Cohen responded that Mr Trump’s name would be attached to the club.\n07:32 PM BST\nCohen: Trump told me to ‘just do it’\nDonald Trump eventually agreed to pay for Stormy Daniels’ story, Michael Cohen told the court.\n“He expressed to me, just do it. Meet up with Allen Weisselberg and figure this whole thing out,” Cohen said, referring to the Trump Organisation’s chief financial officer.\n07:28 PM BST\n‘They’re going with the Daily Mail’\nThe same day, Dylan Howard, editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer, texted Michael Cohen: “I’m told they’re going with DailyMail. Are you aware?”\n07:27 PM BST\nStormy Daniels story ‘would have run in the Daily Mail’\nMichael Cohen said he warned Donald Trump that the alleged “hush money” deal with Stormy Daniels had fallen apart because he refused to release the money.\n“I called Mr Trump, in order to advise him of the situation that because I didn’t forward the funds, she’s now declared the agreement void,” he said.\nHe did not get through to the then-Republican candidate and left a voicemail on October 17. The story would have appeared in the Daily Mail, he said.\n07:24 PM BST\nCohen ‘was losing control of hush money deal’\nMichael Cohen said he was “very” concerned just weeks before the election that the Stormy Daniels story could come out.\n“We were losing control over the settlement of this agreement in order to prevent the story from coming out,” he told the court.\nAt the time, he said, he was attempting to stonewall a payment to Ms Daniels’ lawyer on instructions from Donald Trump.\n07:22 PM BST\n‘I’m not sure they would have opened it’\nMichael Cohen said he listed Resolution Consultants as a management consultancy company when filling out the paperwork to set it up.\nHe told the court: “I’m not sure if they would’ve opened it if it stated to pay off an adult film star for a nondisclosure agreement.”\nCohen said he then set up Essential Consultants, LLC after realising that the first company was a name already used by an acquaintance.\n07:15 PM BST\nCourt shown Cohen emails to banker\nContinuing its practice of using documents to back up Michael Cohen’s testimony, prosecutors are showing the court emails exchanged by Cohen and his banker, Gary Farro.\nThe messages concern a shell company Cohen was attempting to set up called Resolutions Consultants LLC - allegedly created to reimburse American Media, Inc. for a $150,00 payment to Karen McDougal.\nIn another tranche of emails, exchanged with Stormy Daniels’ lawyer Keith Davidson, Cohen said he used the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur as an excuse to delay paying him until after the election.\n07:02 PM BST\nCohen back on his witness stand\nJuan Merchan is back on the bench and court is now in session. Michael Cohen has returned to the witness stand and is giving evidence.\n07:00 PM BST\nTrump heads back into court\nDonald Trump has re-entered the courtroom as proceedings resume. He was followed by J. D. Vance, the Ohio senator who is seen as a possible running mate in the coming presidential election.\n06:16 PM BST\nPictured: Michael Cohen on witness stand as Trump looks on\n06:03 PM BST\nMelania ‘came up with Trump response to Access Hollywood tape’\nMelania Trump came up with her husband’s response after he boasted he could “ grab [women] by the p----”, his former lawyer claimed.\nMichael Cohen told Donald Trump’s “hush money” trial that she had decided he should downplay the comments, made on the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape released in 2016, as “locker room talk”.\nProsecutors argue that Mr Trump was desperate to stop any further stories about sexual misconduct coming out that could hurt his presidential campaign. As such, they argue, he falsified business records to conceal hush money payments to a porn star with whom he allegedly had an affair.\nCohen, testifying against his former boss, said that when the story came out “we needed to put a spin on this and the spin he wanted put on this was that it was ‘locker room talk’”.\nMr Trump told him Mrs Trump had “recommended” the locker room response, Cohen told a New York court. “He told me that’s what Melania had thought it was”, he added.\nCohen said he worried the recording “was going to be significantly impactful, especially with women voters”, and that the affair story would be “catastrophic”.\n05:56 PM BST\nCourt breaks for lunch\nThe court is now on a lunch break.\n05:56 PM BST\n‘Just get it past the election’\nMichael Cohen said the Stormy Daniels story “coupled” with the Access Hollywood tape was a “disaster” and Donald Trump told him to “get control over it.”\n“He told me to work with David and get control over this… purchase the life rights… do what you need to do to stop this getting out”, Cohen said.\nCohen also said Mr Trump had told him to “push it out for as long as you can.”\n“What he’d said to me is … ‘Just get past the election. If I win, it’ll have no relevance [as] I’m president. And if I lose, I don’t really care.’”\n05:54 PM BST\nTrump ‘said men will think porn star affair story is cool’\nDonald Trump said Stormy Daniels story would be a “disaster” with women but men will think “it’s cool”.\nWhen he told Mr Trump about the Stormy Daniels story, he told him: “Just take care of it”.\n“There was a lot going on at the campaign at the time”, Cohen said.\n“He said ‘this is a disaster – a total disaster. Women will hate me. Guys – they’ll think it’s cool. But this is going to be a disaster for the campaign.’”\nCohen added: “So at the time Mr Trump was polling very, very low with women… he was polling very poorly with women”.\n05:52 PM BST\n‘This was all about the campaign’\nDonald Trump “wasn’t thinking about Melania” when he arranged to kill a story of an affair with an adult film star, Michael Cohen told the court.\nCohen, Mr Trump’s former “fixer”, said he had raised the issue of Melanie Trump when speaking to his employer about his alleged affair with Stormy Daniels.\n“Don’t worry, he goes how long do you think I’ll be on the market for? Not long,” Cohen said. “He wasn’t thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign.”\n05:50 PM BST\nTrump ‘feared a lot of women would come forward’ during presidential run\nDonald Trump feared that “a lot of women” would come forward when he announced his presidential campaign in 2015, his former lawyer claimed.\nMichael Cohen told the former president’s “hush money” trial that he believed entering the race would cause negative stories about him to surface in the press.\n“You know that when this comes out… meaning the announcement… just be prepared there’s gonna be a lot of women coming forward,” Cohen said Mr Trump warned him.\nThe two men, along with tabloid boss David Pecker, are said to have formed a “criminal conspiracy” to kill stories of Mr Trump’s alleged affairs ahead of the 2016 election.\nCohen testified that he helped arrange efforts to kill stories about an illegitimate child allegedly fathered by his employer, along with an affair with Playboy bunny Karen McDougal.\nMr Trump apparently told Mr Pecker he would “take care” of a $150,000 payment to Ms McDougal. This did not happen.\n05:40 PM BST\nCohen ‘told to take care of Daniels affair story’\nMichael Cohen said he told Donald Trump that they needed to “take care” of Stormy Daniels’ story when he learned of their alleged affair.\nMr Trump is said to have responded: “Absolutely. Do it, take care of it.”\n05:37 PM BST\nTrump ‘said women preferred him to football star’\nCohen said Donald Trump told him about meeting Stormy Daniels.\n“He told me that he was playing golf… and they had met Stormy Daniels and others there. But she liked Mr Trump and women preferred Trump even over big Ben [Roethlisberger - an NFL quarterback who was playing in the tournament].”\nCohen asked Mr Trump whether he had slept with Ms Daniels.\nMr Trump wouldn’t answer, but “turned around and said that she was a beautiful woman”.\n05:35 PM BST\nStormy Daniels story ‘would have been catastrophic’\nAsked what the potential impact of Stormy Daniels’ alleged tryst with Mr Trump would be, Cohen said: “Catastrophic”.\nHe said he thought it would be “horrible for the campaign”.\n05:28 PM BST\nFears about impact of Trump comments on ‘women voters’\nAsked if he had concerns that the Access Hollywood tape would impact Mr Trump’s campaign, Cohen said he worried it “was going to be significantly impactful, especially with women voters.”\n05:26 PM BST\nCohen: Melania came up with ‘Access Hollywood’ response\nCohen said Donald Trump’s response to the Access Hollywood tape was proposed by Melania Trump.\nAsked whether he was concerned about the impact the infamous tape could have on Mr Trump’s campaign, Cohen said “yes”.\n“We needed to put a spin on this and the spin he wanted put on this was that it was ‘locker room talk’”, Cohen said.\nCohen said that Mr Trump told him Mrs Trump had “recommended” the locker room response.\n“He told me that’s what Melania had thought it was”, he said.\nHe said he wanted to “limit [the] impact on him and his campaign”.\n05:22 PM BST\n‘Who’s doing damage control?’\nMichael Cohen told the court he wanted to ensure that Donald Trump would be protected when the Access Hollywood tape became public.\n“It’s all over the place. Whose [sic] doing damage control here?” he wrote in an email to Steve Bannon, who was chief executive of the Trump campaign.\n05:16 PM BST\nTestimony turns to ‘Access Hollywood’ tape\nMichael Cohen said he was in London for his daughter’s birthday when he learned of the “Access Hollywood” tape, in which Donald Trump made crude remarks about women.\nHe said he was alerted by it by Hope Hicks, the former aide to Mr Trump who has previously testified.\nProsecutors have argued the tape is crucial to the “hush money” case because the then-Republican candidate was desperate to kill any stories about sexual misconduct which could derail his campaign.\n05:14 PM BST\nPecker ‘never asked to hear Trump recording’\nCohen said he never played David Pecker the recording in which he and Mr Trump allegedly talk about paying Mr Pecker back for buying the rights to Ms McDougal’s story.\nHe said he didn’t need to play it because Mr Pecker didn’t ask to hear it.\n05:12 PM BST\nProsecution ‘backing up Cohen claims with documents’\nCohen is a risky witness who the defence will try to tear apart as a liar and a criminal.\nThe prosecution is therefore trying to back up every one of Cohen’s claims with documents.\nThis includes showing the jury Cohen’s mobile phone call logs to bolster his claims he spoke to Mr Trump at a particular time or date.\n05:12 PM BST\nCohen: I set up shell company for hush money payment\nMichael Cohen said he set up a shell company - Resolution Consultants LLC - “to use this entity for the assignment of the McDougal matter” and other stories about Donald Trump.\nHe said that a seven-minute call he had with Mr Trump in late September 2016, just weeks before the election, was to tell him that Ms McDougal’s story was “being resolved”.\n05:09 PM BST\nCohen ‘acting for Trump’s benefit’\n“What I was doing I was doing from the direction… for the benefit of Mr Trump”, Cohen said.\n05:01 PM BST\n‘We need $150,000 to consummate this transaction’\nCohen says he and Allen Weisselberg both had offices on the 26th floor, the same floor as Mr Trump.\nBoth their officers were a “pretty similar” distance to Mr Trump’s, until Cohen was moved into an office closer to the former president.\nCohen said he went to speak to Weisselberg about repaying AMI for the rights to Ms McDougal’s story.\n“I expressed to him that we need funding of $150,000 to consummate this transaction”, Cohen said.\n“Allen then said to me ‘Well if we do it from a Trump entity it kind of defeats the purpose’” because they had not wanted anything to link to Mr Trump.”\n05:00 PM BST\nCohen ‘spoke to Trump CFO about McDougal payment’\nMichael Cohen said he had between 10 and 12 conversations with Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organisation’s chief financial officer, about the payment to Karen McDougal.\nProsecutors claim that Mr Weisselberg, who has not been called to testify, helped calculate the money repaid to Cohen for his alleged “hush money” payment to Stormy Daniels.\nNo payment was made by Donald Trump or the Trump Organisation to Ms McDougal.\n04:57 PM BST\nTrump speaking to lawyers as Cohen testifies\nMr Trump appears more alert after the morning break.\nHe is leaning back in his chair reading a document, occasionally speaking to his lawyers.\n04:53 PM BST\nCohen: I did not alter Trump recording\nAsked if he had altered the recording of his conversation with Donald Trump, Michael Cohen responded: “No.”\n04:51 PM BST\nCohen: Paying in cash was ‘bad idea’\nCohen said he thought it was a bad idea to pay in cash because they “needed to acquire the information” held by the National Enquirer.\nThis is in reference to documents Mr Trump wanted to obtain about him from AMI.\nCohen said the audio recording “cut off” because he received an incoming phone call.\n“I must’ve believed it was an important phone call”, Cohen said.\nHe also said he had “enough to show David Pecker… as to convince him he was going to receive the $150,000 back”.\n04:50 PM BST\nCourt returns\nCourt is back in session.\n04:40 PM BST\nTrump returns to courtroom\nDonald Trump is returning to the courtroom after a short break. He gave a brief thumb-up to cameras before heading inside.\n04:27 PM BST\nTrump ‘wanted to avoid paper transaction’\nAsked what Donald Trump meant when he said “pay with cash”, Cohen said: “To pay with green, which would obviously be one way to avoid any kind of paper transaction”.\nHe said he didn’t think this was the best way to repay the money.\nThe court is now on a short break.\n04:26 PM BST\nI bullied people for Trump, says star witness\nMichael Cohen said he bullied people for Donald Trump as he took the witness at the former president’s “hush money” trial.\nCohen, who acted as Mr Trump’s lawyer and “fixer” before being sent to prison for tax and campaign finance violations, said: ”The only thing that was on my mind was to accomplish the task so he’d be happy.”\nHe also said he “often” dealt aggressively with the press to take down negative stories about Mr Trump, threatening to “file an action” against them.\nCohen is alleged to have formed a criminal conspiracy with Mr Trump and David Pecker, the former tabloid boss, to suppress damaging stories about his boss during his 2016 presidential run.\nHe also said Mr Trump never used an email address because he “knows too many people who have gone down” from leaving a paper trail. Instead, they communicated by phone or in person, he testified.\n04:25 PM BST\n‘What do we got to pay for this?’\nHe said Mr Trump had previously “directed” him to speak to Allen Weisselberg, the former CFO of the Trump Organisation, about resolving the issue.\nIn the audio recording, Mr Trump can be heard saying: “So what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?”\nAsked what Mr Trump was referring to, Cohen said he was: “Referring to the $150,000... to purchase the life rights of Karen McDougal”.\nHe said he knew the cost “based upon conversations with David which is why he mentioned the number 150.”\n04:22 PM BST\nCohen ‘wanted to keep payment away from Trump’\nIn the recording, which has been played to the jury previously, Cohen talks about opening up a company for the transfer “regarding our friend David”.\nDiscussing what he meant, Cohen said he wanted to open up a company to keep it “separate” from Mr Trump.\nHe said he didn’t explicitly need to mention Ms McDougal because it was an “ongoing conversation”.\n04:21 PM BST\nCourt hears recording Cohen made of Trump\nCohen said he recorded a conversation with Mr Trump about repaying AMI for the rights to Ms McDougal’s story to reassure Mr Pecker.\nHe said he made the recording because the lack of repayment “became a regular conversation between the two of us and I also wanted him to remain loyal to Mr Trump.”\nHe said he recorded the audio using the voice memo app on his phone, which he held in his hand when he walked into Mr Trump’s office.\n“Was Mr Trump aware you were recording this conversation?”, prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked.\n“No ma’am”, Cohen replied.\nThe jury is now being played the audio recording.\n04:12 PM BST\nPecker ‘contacted Cohen about being reimbursed’\nDavid Pecker contacted Michael Cohen several times about being reimbursed the $150,000 for the Karen McDougal story.\n“He needed the $150,000, he wanted the $150000 back because it was too much money for him to hide from the CEO of the company”, Cohen said.\n“And he’d also laid out $30,000 previously”, he added, saying he was “putting pressure” on him to speak to Mr Trump.\nHe said when he spoke to Mr Trump he said “don’t worry, I’ll take care of it”.\n04:08 PM BST\nPecker ‘said McDougal deal was bullet-proof’\nAfter securing the Karen McDougal deal, David Pecker said he thought the agreement was “bullet proof”.\nCohen said he told him he had “prevented the story being released on ABC News and effectively the story has now been caught.”.\nCohen said he updated Mr Trump, who said: “fantastic, great job”.\n04:02 PM BST\nCohen: Trump said he would ‘take care’ of McDougal payment\nCohen said he was in Mr Trump’s office with the former president when he spoke to David Pecker about the Karen McDougal story.\n“Instead of lifting up the phone he used the speaker box so I was able to hear”, Cohen said.\nHe said Mr Trump “asked him how things are going with the matter… David Pecker said we have this under control and we’ll take care of this”.\nCohen added: “David had stated it was gonna cost him 150,000 to control the story”.\nMr Trump replied, Cohen said, with “No problem, I’ll take care of it”.\nCohen said he took this to mean: “AMI was going to lay out the funds and as Mr Trump had stated to David ‘I’ll take care of it’”.\nHe said he took this to mean Mr Trump was going to repay AMI.\n04:00 PM BST\nTabloid editor ‘had McDougal story locked down’\nDylan Howard told Michael Cohen, in a further exchange on Karen McDougal’s story: “I’ve got this locked down for you.
