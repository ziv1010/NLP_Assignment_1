  "body_text": "There were few surprises as Spain women's team coach Montse Tome on Tuesday announced the 23-player squad for next month's Women's European Championships.\nSpain travels to Switzerland as the reigning world and UEFA Nations League champion, and will play Portugal, Belgium and Italy in the group stage.\n\"The players have done an incredible job to be here, I am happy with the selection and I also remember the players who have been with us, who haven't made the 23, but I was thinking about what will be needed in the Euros,\" said Tome.\nTome has included 10 players from FC Barcelona in her squad, including Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas, along with goalkeeper Cata Coll and defender Irene Paredes.\n\"We have experience at club and international level and also young players, so I don't worry about a lack of experience, we have players who can play in different positions and I think we have the capacity to do well,\" added the coach, who insisted she was confident the players would arrive in good condition for the tournament.\nOne player who missed out is Jenni Hermoso, who made headlines after the 2023 World Cup after she was the victim of an unsolicited kiss by former Spanish Football Federation President Luis Rubiales.\n\"I have spoken to her and with her coach and we carried out the work we did with the other players. We have looked at our season and we valued what we need and what we don't need.\"\n\"Every squad is difficult and this is the hardest for me as coach and the technical staff,\" revealed Tome.",
