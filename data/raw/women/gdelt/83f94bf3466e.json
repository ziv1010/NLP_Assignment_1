  "body_text": "The 2025-26 school year is upon us, and the minivans and rented U-Hauls have departed Alderman Road and Jefferson Park Avenue. Whether this fall will be your first at the University or your last, one of the best ways to make the most of your time is by supporting the Cavaliers across multiple sports.\nAs a reminder, all home games are free admission with a student ID, as part of the University’s student ticketing system. And this year, there is a marvelous slate of home games to attend. Without further ado, here are some recommendations in no particular order — aside from the obvious showdowns against Virginia Tech — to attend this upcoming semester.\n1. No. 11 men’s soccer versus No. 21 Denver, Oct. 19 at 5 p.m.\nDenver has been a power as of late, and although Virginia has had a men’s soccer team since 1941 and the Pioneers have since 1961, they have only matched up three times. The Pioneers are up 2-1, so this meeting gives the Cavaliers a chance to even the series against a ranked opponent.\n2. No. 13 women’s soccer versus No. 6 Florida State, Oct. 23 at 6 p.m.\nIn last year’s matchup, the Cavaliers lost 4-0, their worst margin of defeat last season. Virginia has not beaten Florida State, a national superpower, since 2019. Since then, though, the Seminoles booted the Cavaliers out in the spring 2021 NCAA Tournament semifinals. A win is crucial, not just to snap the winless streak and earn revenge, but for possible seeding in the ACC Tournament.\n3. Football versus Coastal Carolina, Aug. 30 at 6 p.m.\nTwenty three players left Virginia football in the transfer portal this offseason, and 32 players joined the team. This year is an exciting make-or-break for Coach Tony Elliott, so heading over to Scott Stadium for the always-important first game of the season Saturday is a must for any Virginia sports fan. Make sure to wear orange.\n4. No. 4 field hockey versus No. 13 Maryland, Oct. 28 at 4 p.m.\nMaryland is among Virginia’s most hated out-of-conference rivals. Historically, the Terrapins have a 25-6 advantage, but with the Cavaliers winning two consecutive matchups for the first time ever, the tide may be turning. In the final National Coaches Poll for last season, Maryland ranked fifth, while Virginia ranked eighth, so this meeting could prove to be a tight battle.\n5. Volleyball versus NC State, Nov. 21 at 7 p.m.\nLast season, Virginia was upset by NC State, breaking its eight-match win streak. With that loss, the Cavaliers’ winless streak against the Wolfpack extended to 13 games — the last time Virginia won this matchup was exactly a decade and a day before this next match. This fall, they’ll get a chance at revenge not just for last year, but for a decade of defeat on a big stage — the match will be played in John Paul Jones Arena.\n6. Women’s soccer versus No. 3 Duke, Sept. 11 at 7 p.m.\nFrom 2018 to 2022, the Cavaliers played six matchups without losing to the Blue Devils. Since then, however, Duke has the advantage in two out of three meetings, with the third being a tie. A matchup against them is an opportunity for a win against a conference opponent and an upset against a title contender.\n7. Field hockey versus No. 2 North Carolina, Oct. 10 at 5 p.m.\nSenior midfielder Daniela Mendez-Trendler, Virginia’s back-to-back leading scorer, joined North Carolina in the transfer portal after three years in Charlottesville. The Cavaliers are still dangerous, now led by a pair of preseason All-ACC selections in graduate midfielder Suze Leemans and junior midfielder Mia Abello. On top of all this, the Tar Heels are the winningest program in NCAA history, providing an excellent mix of narratives to follow.\n8. Men’s soccer versus No. 5 Wake Forest, Sept. 19 at 7:30 p.m.\nVia a 5-1 drubbing, Wake Forest ended Virginia’s 2024 ACC championship hopes. The Demon Deacons would go on to win the tournament. The last 10 matchups between these programs are perfectly split, 4-4-2, so this Friday night showdown is a get-back opportunity and a possible tiebreaker.\n9. Volleyball versus No. 6 Stanford, Sept. 27 at 1 p.m.\nStanford ended last regular season as the fifth-ranked team in the country, and Virginia will face the Cardinal in John Paul Jones Arena this season. This will only be the third meeting in both programs’ histories, and through two, Stanford has the undefeated advantage. While this is a young rivalry, it could grow over the next few years, with the Cardinal joining the ACC and both programs on the rise.\n10. Football versus Florida State, Sept. 26 at 7 p.m.\nIt has been six years since these two programs last matched up, and Virginia prevailed in the last bout in a thrilling fashion. More than half a decade later, both programs will be looking to rebound after rough 2024 seasons — the Seminoles, in particular, went 2-10 in their worst season since 1974. This game is set to be nationally televised on ESPN in Friday night primetime — if there’s one Virginia Athletics event to attend, it’s this one.",
