Suddenly I felt a person behind me putting something on me. I tried to push, to move, but there was very little space,' she told Italian media.\nSpeaking in a video recorded after the horrific experience, the Italian influencer said: 'While I was there, as usual, there were those disgusting men who kept pressing against me from behind.\n'I kept elbowing them - I mean, I was glaring at them so hard, elbowing them, pushing them away - but since everyone was so crammed together, it was really hard to avoid people.\n'No matter how much I tried to move this way or that, there was always someone behind me. It was disgusting, honestly.'\nBut, Lara said, she did not realise just how awful the situation was until she was off the tube. 'The worst part comes after,' she told her followers. 'I got off and kept glaring at and pushing these guys away, but I went up [the escalator] without noticing anything.'\nShe was then stopped by a Spanish couple, who she said told her: 'You have something on your back.'\n'I put my hand out because I thought I was leaning on a dirty wall, it can happen,' she said. 'Instead, when I brought it back, it was completely covered in sperm.'\nSpeaking in a video recorded afterwards, Lara Rapelli described her grim experience on the Milan metro\nThe football fan said she did not realise just how awful the situation was until she was off the tube\nNineteen-year-old Imogen (left) was with friends (pictured - one of the friends, not involved in the attack) in Italy bringing the new year when she says she was attacked by a group of men\nThe vile assault left the young woman 'speechless' and she was comforted by the Spanish couple who gave her tissues to try to help clean her up, before finding her friend at the stadium.\n'I’ve never experienced something so gross in my entire life. I can’t even understand how something like this is possible. I still feel dirty, and I really just want to erase this memory,' she said.\nShe added that she wanted to share her experience to warn other young women in the city.\nSoon afterwards, she went to the police station to report what had happened, handing in her dirty trousers as evidence.\nShe told police that the main attacker who had been behind her was a man aged over 35 who had dark hair, a beard, olive skin, and was around 6ft (1.8m) tall.\n'I didn't hear him speak but the group of boys who surrounded me and giggled while looking at me had an Eeastern European look and accent,' she said.\nShe said police are using her description to try to identify the culprit on CCTV footage of the metro station.\nIt is the latest disturbing account of sexual violence on the streets of the northern Italian city, which is a popular destination for city breaks among British and European travellers.\nFootage from New Year's Eve of the Piazza del Duomo shows chaotic scenes\nEarlier this month a nineteen-year-old British student described being the victim of a horrifying mass sexual assault attack in Milan\nThe teenager, named only as Imogen, bravely shared how she was assaulted by an 'organised' group of men she did not know as she brought in the new year with friends.\nShe had spent the evening with two male friends from England and a group of six Belgian students they had met in Italy before heading to the Piazza del Duomo to watch the fireworks.\nIn a harrowing testimony she described how she was ‘grabbed and pulled back’ while passing through a busy crowd, surrounded by around 30 men she did not know. ‘They held my arms, my hands. I couldn’t defend myself.’\nLara Rapelli, 24, was heading to the San Siro stadium to watch AC Milan take on Girona when she said she was surrounded by a group of men on the city's packed metro\n‘Several men, at the same time, started to grope me, while another tried to pull up my dress,’ she said. ‘I was struggling to get free, and they were enjoying my distress.’\nAnother student described how she and friends were attacked by a mob who pinned their hands back while other men grabbed them during the harrowing affair that lasted ten minutes.\nLaura Barbier, one of six Belgians visiting the Piazza del Duomo to watch the fireworks with the British victims, also recalled the 'nightmare' of having men grabbing at them while others assaulted them under their clothes.\n'Three out of us four girls were sexually assaulted. A friend had her breasts groped and her buttocks touched. [The men] put their hands in my pants. It went very far,' Laura (pictured) told Belgian broadcaster RTL\nShe told Belgian outlet Sudinfo how three of the four female students were sexually assaulted, one groped on the breasts and buttocks.\nThey 'put their hands in my pants', the 20-year-old claimed. 'It went very far... There were so many people around us that we couldn't move.'\nItalian prosecutors have since opened an investigation into the allegations of group sexual violence, compiling a file 'on the basis of the numerous press articles collected' about the apparently coordinated attack.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured",
