It’s incredible, it’s been stuck in my head as well. So thanks to the fans.\n“I’ve felt at home here since I arrived, and having that chant is just incredible. I’m happy to be here and I’m happy to have that chant stuck in my head.”\nAfter seeing the Gunners storm into second place in the WSL, just three points behind leaders Chelsea, Eidevall was quick to praise his “phenomenal” players.\n“I think some of the attacking football we played in the second half was great to watch,” said the Arsenal boss. “It was a great representation of the way Arsenal play football.\n“We had a lot of speed and creativity in our forward four. We probably had just as many opportunities that we didn’t score as we did, which is very impressive away from home.”",
