Rachel Furness is hanging up her boots, joining Niamh Fahey in retirement.\nFormer Liverpool Vice Captain Rachel Furness Announces Retirement\nFurness finished her career at her hometown club Newcastle.\nThe former Liverpool Women’s vice captain announced on Thursday she was retiring from professional football, following the end of the WSL season a few weeks ago, and her final match representing Northern Ireland.\nFurness joined the Reds in 2019 from Reading, and went on to make 64 appearances and score 19 goals during her time on Merseyside, serving as vice-captain and being an important part of the squad that promoted Liverpool to the Barclays Women’s Super League by winning the Championship in 2021-22.\nFurness is also Northern Ireland’s record goal scorer, racking up 95 caps and netting 38 times. Her efforts helped Northern Ireland to qualify for the 2022 Euros, the country’s first international tournament appearance.\n“I’ve been in football a long time and I’d like to think over the years I’ve made a difference, especially with Northern Ireland,” Furness said. “That’s all I ever wanted; I wanted to make a difference.”\nFurney finished her career at her girlhood favorite club of Newcastle, after spending time with Bristol Rovers following her departure from Liverpool in 2023.\nHer passion, her excitement, and her goal scoring abilities made her a joy to watch in Red and she deserves every bit of retirement.",
