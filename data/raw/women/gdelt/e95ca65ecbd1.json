As you know in football, when you reach some age you count the months very quick.\n“I feel very good in this moment, I score goals, I still feel quick and sharp, I’m enjoying my game in the national team and Al Nassr – but of course, let’s be honest, when I mean ‘soon’ it’s probably one, two years I’ll still be in the game.”\nAsked if that meant the 2026 World Cup would be his last, he replied: “Definitely, yes, because I will be 41 years old and I think it will be the moment, and in a big competition.”\nScott has eyes on the World Cup\nSiblings at St. George's Park 🦁@AlexScott_7 on growing up with his @Lionesses step-sister @MayaLeTissier… pic.twitter.com/xBBCFL5cB8\n— England (@England) November 11, 2025\nAlex Scott is hoping his rapid rise can take him from non-league to the World Cup in just seven years.\nThe Bournemouth midfielder has been called up to the England squad for the first time for this week’s qualifiers against Serbia and Albania after impressing for the Under-21s.\nWhen he was released by Southampton at the age of 12 he did not think he had a future in the game, but he now has a shot at forcing his way into Thomas Tuchel’s plans for next summer’s global showpiece.\n“I’m over the moon, it is everything you dream for,” he said. “Six years ago I was playing non-league for Guernsey and I wasn’t even sure I was going to make it as a footballer.\n“So to be now in the England team is a dream come true. To be honest, I don’t think it’s really sunk in too much yet.\n“That’s the dream for everyone, especially the players here – to be in that World Cup squad.”\nWhat’s on today?\nDefending champions Arsenal travel to Bayern Munich in the Women’s Champions League.\nMary Earps returns with Paris St Germain to face her former club Manchester United.",
