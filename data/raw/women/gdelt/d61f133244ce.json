He became the Northeastern State coach on Dec. 17.\n“It’s a great opportunity to build something special and win championships,” Chiaverini said. “You’re going to love the creativity on offense and we’re going to attack on defense.”\nHitting the recruiting trail since his first day on the job, Chiaverini didn’t have to go far to secure an initial signing.\nQuarterback Dereun Dortch, a San Jacinto High School graduate who helped lead Chaffey College last season, announced his commitment to NSU via social media on Dec. 25.\nDortch led San Jacinto to wins in both CIF-Southern Section and CIF State regional championship games in 2022 and was the IE Varsity Offensive Player of the Year that season.\nHe emerged as Chaffey’s full-time starter in Week 2 this season and finished with 2,350 passing yards and 34 total touchdowns.\nNSU struggled to a 1-10 record this season. The RiverHawks were shut out five times, went 0-6 at home and ended the season with five consecutive losses.\n“We’re going to develop a culture of accountability and discipline (and) that starts with me as the head football coach,” Chiaverini said. “As I get going here, I want to develop that culture right away.”\nIn his first season as the head coach of his own program at Chaffey, Chiaverini took over a team that had been 2-18 since 2021.\n“We’re going to recruit great football players and we’re going to recruit great people,” Chiaverini said. “If they want to change what’s been going on in the past, they’ve got to be able to change things right now in the present.”\nPreviously the wide receivers coach, offensive coordinator and assistant head coach at University of Colorado, his alma mater, Rivals.com named Chiaverini one of the top 25 recruiters in the country three consecutive years from 2018-’20. He served on Chip Kelly’s staff at UCLA as a senior analyst in 2022.\nA graduate at Corona High, Chiaverini was a fifth-round selection by the Cleveland Browns in the 1999 National Football League Draft. He set the team’s then rookie receiving record with 44 catches for 487 yards and four touchdowns and went on to play for the Dallas Cowboys and the Atlanta Falcons during a four-year NFL career.\nBAPTISTE SIGNS AGAIN\nRiverside City College defensive back Kavon Baptiste is returning to NCAA Division I football after signing his commitment letter to Stephen F. Austin University on Dec. 20.\nA graduate of Riverside North, Baptiste was rostered at San Jose State before torn knee ligaments put his playing career into question. After recovery, Baptiste enrolled at RCC and played 12 games this season for the Tigers.\nHe had 26 tackles, nine pass break-ups and three interceptions – including one in the California Community College Athletic Association championship game – for Riverside, the JCGridwire.com co-national champions.\nBaptiste chose San Jose State out of high school over offers from Colorado, Utah State and Sacramento State.\nYELLICO LEAVES REDLANDS\nAfter two seasons leading University of Redlands men’s and women’s tennis programs, coach Pete Yellico has resigned effective Jan. 2 to become a women’s assistant coach at the University of Oregon.\nYellico guided the 2022 women’s team to the Round of 16 at the NCAA Division III championships. In 2023, the men’s team finished second in SCIAC and sent a doubles team to the NCAA Division III championships.\nHe coached nine all-SCIAC performers, qualified for the SCIAC tournament three times and had his women’s team earn a No. 15 national ranking while the men’s team peaked at No. 17.\nCBU LEADS LEARFIELD STANDINGS\nThe updated Learfield Directors’ Cup standings were released on Dec. 21, and California Baptist University leads the nation for non-football schools with 165.5 points.\nThe final standings will be released on Jan. 11 at the conclusion of the FCS football season, but the non-football list should stay the same with the Lancers ahead of programs perennially atop the list including Gonzaga, UC Irvine, Loyola Marymount, Creighton and Hofstra.\nCBU’s point total already surpasses its total from its inaugural season in 2022-23, when the Lancers finished with 135.5 points.\nThe Learfield Directors’ Cup was developed as a joint effort between the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics and USA Today. Points are awarded based on each institution’s finish in NCAA championships.",
