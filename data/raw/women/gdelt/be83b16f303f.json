  "body_text": "Australia’s broadcast regulator has ruled that four commercial radio stations – Triple M Sydney, Triple M Brisbane, Gold Coast FM and Maryborough Broadcasting Company – crossed the line when they put to air Marty Sheargold’s now-infamous tirade about the Matildas.\nThe Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) found the February segment, in which Sheargold dismissed the national women’s football team as “Year 10 girls” before crudely suggesting he’d rather injure himself than watch them play, amounted to sexist, demeaning commentary that breached the Commercial Radio Code of Practice.\nThe remarks came during a Drive program update about the Matildas’ results at the SheBelieves Cup. Sheargold told listeners the team reminded him of high school girls dealing with “friendship issues”, before adding: “I’d rather hammer a nail through the head of my penis” than watch them play in next year’s Asian Cup. “Got any men’s sport?” he added.\nClips of the broadcast were quickly shared on social media, drawing attention from athletes, fans and politicians. Former Hockeyroo Rosie Malone described hearing the remarks as “disgusting” and warned of the harm to young girls listening in cars with their families.\nMatildas players Alex Chidiac and Clare Wheeler also voiced their anger online.\nThe watchdog was blunt in its findings: Sheargold’s words, broadcast nationally via Southern Cross Austereo’s (SCA) Triple M network, conveyed “a level of contempt and disdain for women’s sport, and more generally of women”.\nEven if framed as humour, ACMA said, the remarks went beyond what “an ordinary, reasonable listener” would accept. The regulator was particularly critical of Sheargold’s reference to his “genitalia”, which it said compounded the offensive nature of the exchange.\nIn its submission, SCA maintained that the comments were not offensive when measured against “generally acceptable standards of decency for a Triple M listener”. The company noted that the show’s core audience is men aged 40 to 54, and argued that harsh criticism is often directed at sporting teams when they perform poorly.\nACMA rejected that defence, finding that standards of decency apply regardless of audience profile and that the language used in the segment went beyond ordinary sports commentary.\nThe fallout from Sheargold’s comments was immediate. The Marty Sheargold Show did not air in its usual 3pm slot the day after the segment, with Triple M instead running music and advertising.\nWithin days, Sheargold was stood down and later left the network. He apologised to the Matildas, admitting that comedy can sometime “miss the mark” and cause offence. Triple M also issued a public apology, stressing the remarks did not reflect its values.\nACMA has not yet finalised penalties for the four stations but options include staff training, formal warnings or new licence conditions.\nFor women’s sport, the ruling is being viewed as a symbolic step. The Matildas’ World Cup run in 2023 was heralded as a cultural turning point, and critics say sexist commentary undermines that progress.\n“Respect for women’s sport isn’t optional,” ACMA member Carolyn Lidgerwood said. “Broadcasters need to do better.”",
