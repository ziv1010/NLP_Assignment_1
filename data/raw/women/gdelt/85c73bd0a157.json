We will do everything we can to hold the person responsible accountable for his actions.”\nJackson entered the transfer portal in April after not playing for USC last season.\nHe was recruited by former coach Clay Helton’s staff, and he started two games during the 2021 season under interim head coach Donte Williams.\nJackson is expected to be arraigned this week.",
