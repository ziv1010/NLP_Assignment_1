Salisbury was 34 when she hung up her boots as one Australia's greatest ever player in 2009.\nAfter Polkinghorne steps aside, van Egmond will be the most experienced player in the Matildas' squad.\nShe has played at four World Cups and three Olympics but is yet to claim a medal at a major tournament, and that could prove a driving force in the next few years.\nIn 150 appearances, van Egmond has also notched 31 goals and her versatility as a deep-lying midfielder or attacking option should continue to make her an integral part of Australia's squad for years to come.\nThe Newcastle Jets product overcame a debilitating back injury to be one of the Matildas' best at the 2023 World Cup, where they fell short of a medal but captured the hearts and minds of a nation.\nOn Thursday night, van Egmond played a part in Australia's only goal with a clever fake in the box to put Caitlin Foord in the path of Ellie Carpenter's killer pass.\n\"You never know what can happen in football,\" van Egmond told the Newcastle Herald leading into this year's Paris Olympics.\n\"Every tournament, every time you get the chance to represent your country, you treat it like it is your last.\"\nVan Egmond had 129 caps for her country leading into the World Cup in July last year so could potentially surpass Polkinghorne's mark with another couple of years in the Matildas' frame.\nBy the end of this international window, she could be the second-most-capped player of all time.\nThe Matildas get another shot at Brazil on the Gold Coast on Sunday night before flying to Victoria next week for two games against Chinese Taipei.\nVan Egmond was blunt in her assessment of the Matildas' result and performance on Thursday night in a game that turned fiery against an extremely physical Brazil.\nThe match grew in intensity with Foord and Hayley Raso particularly incensed by their treatment. The Brazilians finished with 10 players after Vitoria Calhau was sent off in the 86th minute for a second yellow-card offence.\n\"We need to be able to match it, and we need to be better,\" van Egmond said.\nAmanda Gutierres struck in the sixth and 13th minutes at Suncorp Stadium to bring Australia undone in front of 47,501 fans.\nFoord finished off a wonderful team goal in the 43rd minute but Atletico Madrid winger Gio rounded out Brazil's win in the 54th.\nNewcastle's Clare Wheeler, who plays for Everton in England's Women's Super League, was one of four players to withdraw from a 36-player squad named by interim Matildas coach Tom Sermanni.\nWheeler (leg) and Gorry (shoulder) withdrew due to injuries. Cortnee Vine was unavailable due to personal reasons and Mary Folwer cited mental and physical fatigue after a heavy playing schedule.\nNewcastle Jets centre-back Natasha Prior, who has received her first Matildas call-up, was one of 12 substitutes on the bench on Thursday night but did not take the pitch.\nThe 26-year-old is among a wave of new talent included in an extended squad.\nQueensland duo Winonah Heatley and Sharn Freier, both 23, showed why they are two of the Matildas' most promising members of the next generation with strong performances against Brazil.\nHeatley, playing as a defensive midfielder, had her first start in the national team and did not look out of place.\nWith the home Asian Cup on the horizon, Sermanni said it was the right time to bring young players into the squad.",
