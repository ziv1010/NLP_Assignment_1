  "body_text": "To mark the end of the domestic season around Europe’s major leagues, The Athletic’s writers and editors have had their say on the young players who have most caught the eye in the 2022-23 campaign.\nHere are their verdicts. The one qualifying criterion was that the young player had to be 23 or under.\nAdvertisement\nPremier League\nBukayo Saka (Arsenal)\nThe consistency of Saka’s efforts were critical to Arsenal’s title chase.\nHe has played relentlessly, which might be one of the reasons he has looked jaded in the recent weeks as the effort required with the steamrolling Manchester City for company caught up with all of Arsenal’s squad, physically and mentally. As a group, Arsenal’s young players have absorbed a lot. Saka individually has learned too. That is one the features of his mindset — he is continually willing to improve.\nManager Mikel Arteta encourages him to aim as high as possible and be one of the elite capable of the highest standards every three days. Coming back next season to go again — and better — in both the Premier League and Champions League is an immense new challenge.\nHe always wants to give his all. Game after game, he produces. Training session after training session, he works. Week after week, he takes kicks, picks himself up and goes again. The majority of his goals put Arsenal in the lead or are equalisers. He can deliver goals of significance — the ones that turn or decide games, rather than those that embellish them. He’s a tough little guy with a huge heart.\nHe will be a pivotal player for Arsenal in their domestic and Champions League campaigns next season — as well as for England at Euro 2024. And he is not yet 22.\nAmy Lawrence\nWomen’s Super League\nLauren James (Chelsea)\nJames has been one of the stars of the WSL season. She had to bide her time at Chelsea, with Emma Hayes largely keeping her in the background for most of last season, but since permanently stepping into the first team she has been an important part of their success.\nJames is a joker in the pack for Chelsea as her unique talent makes her hard to read — and sometimes impossible to defend against. Everyone takes notice when James is on the ball because there is a feeling anything can happen.\nAdvertisement\nWith that excitement also comes expectation, which is hard for a player who is only 21. The second half of James’ season was disappointing, but it was also her first full campaign in the WSL as much of her career at Manchester United was impacted by injury.\nAt just 21 there is still so much for her to learn and deliver on the pitch — this is just the start.\nChampionship\nAlex Scott (Bristol City)\nRight now, the 19-year-old Bristol City midfielder is starting and influencing games for England at the Under-20 World Cup in Argentina. At the start of the campaign in August, Scott was already being talked about as one of the most prized young English players outside the Premier League.\nWhat has happened between those events over the course of the 2022-23 campaign has merely fuelled the fire of a talent with genuine class.\nScott already has more than 90 senior appearances and two full campaigns under his belt. There is a versatility to the midfield roles he can play, but in each he has proven able to cover ground, win possession, carry the ball effectively and then use it progressively and with threat.\nGO DEEPER\nBristol City's Alex Scott - Everything Everywhere All At Once\nOpposition teams know that too. No one was fouled more in the Championship last season (2.3 fouls per 90) than Scott, who has impressed in being able to resist pressure from his markers. That underlines his potential to be a future Premier League player.\nGuernsey-born and released by Southampton as a youngster, Bristol City know they have an exciting and valuable talent on their hands. This season has only made the point more obvious.\nMichael Bailey\nLa Liga\nVinicius Jr (Real Madrid)\nThis La Liga season has further confirmed Vinicius Junior as one of Real Madrid’s most important players — and often the most decisive.\nThe Brazilian will end the 2022-23 campaign as Madrid’s most-used player in the competition. He’s also likely to finish with the team’s greatest number of assists and as their second-highest scorer. Across La Liga, nobody has completed more dribbles than his 108.\nAdvertisement\nVinicius Jr, 22, is seen by everyone around Madrid as the most consistent performer in what has been a very irregular team in terms of desire and standards. Earlier this year, several of his opponents spoke to The Athletic about how he is almost impossible to stop.\nHe is a brilliant talent, and he is also taking a stand against the persistent racist abuse he has been facing at grounds across Spain. A global focus shifted to these efforts after last weekend’s fixture in Valencia, when he confronted fans in the stands and the match was interrupted.\nThat moment unleashed a series of reactions that has already contributed to what we can only hope will become a lasting and powerful reckoning with Spanish football’s racism problem.\nMario Cortegana\nSerie A\nKhvicha Kvaratskhelia (Napoli)\nKvaradona was undoubtedly the signing of the season in Serie A. Maybe only Paulo Dybala gets close in that regard.\nIt’s hard to remember a player coming this far out of nowhere and making such a big immediate impact in Italy. Kaka is someone who springs to mind.\nKvaratskhelia was devastating, particularly in the first two-thirds of the campaign. Napoli striker Victor Osimhen’s personal-best goal tally in Serie A was 14 until this season. Him being on 25 at the moment is partly down to having an unpredictable dribbler and great crosser like Kvaratskhelia around him. Now it remains to be seen whether the 22-year-old winger has only scratched the surface of his potential or if that period between August and March was a state of grace.\nRafael Leao, last year’s MVP, still qualifies for this award and, statistically at least, enjoyed a better season at Milan than when he won the league (not that it feels that way). Elsewhere, Rasmus Hojlund cost more than Kvaratskhelia but Atalanta’s young striker surprised even Gian Piero Gasperini with his ability. The league doesn’t lack talent, particularly in midfield, where I’ve been impressed by Udinese’s Lazar Samardzic, Monza’s Nicolo Rovella and another Dane, Lecce’s Morten Hjulmand.\nJames Horncastle\nBundesliga\nJude Bellingham (Borussia Dortmund)\nRaphael Honigstein\nLigue 1\nElye Wahi (Montpellier)\nLigue 1 is awash with young talent and there were a multitude of contenders for this award. Last year, Arsenal’s William Saliba claimed the official award and another loanee, Folarin Balogun, could well have taken this year’s crown. The 21-year-old has scored 20 goals in Ligue 1 for Will Still’s impressive Reims side, helping the team into mid-table. Nuno Mendes at Paris Saint-Germain has also had a hugely impactful season. Already a key player at the age of 20, his potential is frightening.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, The Athletic’s pick for the award is Elye Wahi, the 20-year-old Montpellier striker who has shown consistent progress since breaking into the first team in 2020. A forward who plays at his best through the middle, he has scored goals of all shapes and sizes: poacher’s finishes, headers, volleys and even the acrobatic, such as his excellent strike against Lyon, which earned him the UNFP’s (France’s equivalent of England’s Professional Footballers’ Association) goal of the season award on Sunday.\nHe has intuitive movement, with an eye for space and evading defenders, while he is sharp and agile in possession. But above all, he is a deadly finisher. He has 17 goals (and six assists) from 32 league matches. That’s despite averaging only 1.9 shots per game. He is clinical.\nA league known for its young talent continues to unearth hidden gems, and Wahi is one to keep an eye on.\nPeter Rutzler\n(Top photos: Clive Rose/Getty Images; David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images; Denis Doyle/Getty Images; design: Samuel Richardson)",
