  "body_text": "Best defensive midfielders in EA FC 25\n- 'CDM' is a term popularised by FIFA/EA FC\n- Rodri is in his own league with a 91-rated card\n- Granit Xhaka has enjoyed meteoric rise over past couple of years\nThe acronym 'CDM' wouldn't sound out of place in any documentary or film discussing the 2008 financial crisis.\nBut CDMs and CDOs are two very different things. One, thanks to EA Sports, has been thrust into the football lexicon to describe a holding midfielder, while the other was a key facilitator in ensuring the US housing market went bust 16 years ago. So, yeah, two very different things.\nNobody would have described Claude Makelele as a 'CDM' (central defensive midfielder) back in his apex. It's a modern phenomenon and, despite it's increased prominence in footballing jargon, it's not a phrase you're going to hear managers dish out in pre and post-match conferences.\nBut hey, it works for EA and the acronym remains a part of their latest game.\nHere are the ten highest-rated holding midfielders in EA FC 25, including those who have 'CDM' listed as an alternate position.\n10. Alexis Mac Allister - 86 OVR\nLiverpool didn't sign Alexis Mac Allister in 2023 with the intention of playing him in a holding role, but their inability to bring in a priority holding midfielder that summer meant the Argentine was thrust into a deeper position.\nWhile Mac Allister is far from the perfect #6, he performed ably in a holding position during his debut campaign but was at his best when he was able to affect proceedings in the second phase and higher up the pitch.\n9. Hakan Calhanoglu - 86 OVR\nHakan Calhanoglu certainly isn't bereft of confidence and rated himself as the best CDM in the world back in February.\nHis transition from inconsistent playmaker to dazzling holder has been pretty remarkable, but EA have not yet put him on the pedestal which the player himself believes he belongs.\nStill, an 86 rating places him among the very best.\n8. Granit Xhaka - 86 OVR\nGranit Xhaka's come a long way in a short space of time. The Switzerland international was 79-rated as recently as FIFA 23.\nThat final season at Arsenal, during which he was used in a more advanced role by Mikel Arteta, has proven to be the making of Xhaka amid his prime. He moved to Bayer Leverkusen ahead of the 2023/24 campaign and has been utilised as part of a midfield pivot for the German champions.\nHe's been an all-phase contributor in the Bundesliga, with Xhaka playing a leading role for Xabi Alonso's side during his first season with the club. The midfielder's 50 pace will deter many, however.\n7. Lena Oberdorf - 86 OVR\nThere are few midfielders who profile like Lena Oberdorf in the women's game. The majority of premier holders, like Keira Walsh and Patricia Guijarro, are technical performers whose brains are critical to their success.\nGermany international Oberdorf is cut from a slightly different cloth, however.\nShe's an immensely powerful operator capable of overwhelming her opponents through sheer physicality. Among defensive midfielders in EA FC 25, only Joao Palhinha (90) has a higher physical rating than Oberdorf (89).\nThe 86-rated Bayern Munich Frauen star is an elite destroyer.\n6. Nicolo Barella - 87 OVR\nNicolo Barella can do it all. He's always been a guy capable of grabbing games by the scruff of the neck.\nThe Italian may look fairly rugged in appearance and his play can seem scrappy at times, but deep down Barella is a cultured midfield operator capable of dictating at the base and wreaking havoc between the boxes.\nSimone Inzaghi has thrust him into leadership roles as one of Inter's older statesmen and he produces performances now and then which remind you of his undoubted majesty.\n5. Frenkie de Jong - 87 OVR\nEA have retained their faith in Frenkie de Jong despite the Dutchman enduring another injury-hit campaign. De Jong remains an 87-rated midfielder in EA FC 25.\nThe Barcelona man missed the end of last season and Euro 2024 with an ankle injury but his influence is almost always felt when he takes to the field.\nA dynamic customer who was once touted to be Sergio Busquets' successor in Catalonia, it remains to be seen whether De Jong will ever fulfil his potential at the base of midfield.\n4. Ilkay Gundogan - 87 OVR\nIlkay Gundogan has proven himself to be a master of multiple midfield roles, even excelling as a false nine during his first spell at Manchester City.\nThe German was primarily used in an attacking midfield role at Barcelona last season, but a stunning return to Manchester means Pep Guardiola could deploy Gundogan in a holding midfield position.\nThe stoic midfielder shone as a #6 during the run-ins of City's 2018/19 and 2022/23 title triumphs and Rodri's long-term injury means Guardiola requires mitigation at the base of midfield.\n3. Declan Rice - 87 OVR\nMany view a holding midfield position as Declan Rice's best, but Arteta got plenty out of the Englishman playing further ahead of the ball last season.\nThe Englishman altered between the #6 and #8 roles for the Gunners during his first campaign at the club and enjoyed the most productive season of his career in the final third.\nHowever, given his athleticism, physicality and ability to defend the counter, Rice is set to drop into a deeper position as the 2024/25 season progresses. EA lists him as a CDM, and a very good one at that.\nRice's 87-rated card is well-balanced, but his 73 pace is harsh.\n2. Patricia Guijarro - 87 OVR\nPatricia Guijarro's rating has decreased to an 87 after she was an 88 last year, but the Barcelona Feminino midfielder remains the highest-rated holding midfielder in the women's game.\nThe cultured Spaniard is a shrewd operator at the base of Barca's vintage 4-3-3, serving as the all-conquering team's metronome. Guijarro's work with and without the ball allows the likes of Aitana Bonmati to thrive.\n1. Rodri - 91 OVR\nAn ACL injury means fans might not see much more of Rodri this season, but EA FC 25 users can make the most of his whopping 91-rated card.\nHe's the best defensive midfielder on the planet by some distance and the gulf in ratings between the very best CDM and the rest makes that abundantly clear. Rodri's in his own league.\nManchester City's linchpin rarely loses football matches, while few have ever produced as frequently going forward from the base of midfield.\nHe's utterly dominant without the ball and rarely wastes a touch when he's got it. The Spaniard is the scorer of huge goals, and he goes about his work with a tucked-in shirt - surely worthy of a couple of ratings in itself.",
