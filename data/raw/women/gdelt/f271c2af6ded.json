  "body_text": "DETAILS: Melbourne v Western Bulldogs\nDATE: Saturday 16 September\nTIME: 3:05pm (AEST) (gates open from 2pm)\nLOCATION: Casey Fields | Bunurong\nBROADCAST: Seven Network, Fox Footy, Kayo Sports and womens.afl\nTICKETS: Available here\nMATCH PREVIEW:\nSaturday’s match will see the two clubs celebrate the 10th year of the Hampson-Hardeman Cup, a match that looks to recognise the immense impact Bob Hampson and Lisa Hardeman have had on the game as two pioneers in the development of women's football.\nThe game is the 13th instalment of the cup with both teams looking to add another notch to their history books. The Bulldogs are yet to register a win for the 2023 season, while the Demons are sitting at second on the ladder with back-to-back wins to kick off their year.\nMick Stinear joined media to preview the match and gave some insight into the challenges the Bulldogs present.\n\"They're a strong contested team,\" Stinear said.\n\"And if you go slow and allow their defence to reset, they're a hard team to score against.\n\"So, we'll have to be on our game to win our fair share of the footy...we're expecting a heated game and are looking forward to the challenge.\"\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Melbourne\nGeorgia Campbell\nWhile Campbell has only played three games for her career, this season has seen her shine after a strong pre-season in the red and blue, the young Demon impressing during Melbourne’s scratch matches against Hawthorn and Carlton.\nHer height and strong aerial skills give her a big advantage through the ruck and up forward, learning the ropes from one of the best in the league, Lauren Pearce. She's shown she can impact inside 50, kicking her first career goal during Melbourne's Round 1 win over Collingwood.\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Western Bulldogs\nKatie Lynch\nLynch is coming off a career-best season in 2022 where she earned All-Australian honours and has picked up where she left in the Bulldogs’ Round 1 match this year, registering 16 disposals and featuring among the best afield.\nThe utility has been strong at both ends of the ground in her 36 AFLW games, known for her footy IQ and ability to read the play no matter where she lines up on the ground.",
