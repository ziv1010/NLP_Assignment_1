They stand the test of time and are a reliable layer when the temperature drops slightly and you need a lighter option. Aside from their continuous timeless aesthetic, denim jackets are a practical way of elevating any look.\nThey add warmth, texture and formality to most basic pieces. To get a better understanding, we talked to experts to find the right fit formula for this wardrobe staple.\nWith so many different iterations, styles and washes, you can't go wrong with the classic denim route and embrace the look that has been around for over 100 years.\nWhy are denim jackets a wardrobe staple?\nThere's simply something about the silhouette and the style that make denim jackets something we constantly reach for, says celebrity and personal stylist Basia Richard, adding that it's why almost everyone has one (or multiple!) in their closet.\n\"No matter what the trends are, it’s just something that we can wear no matter what,\" she adds.\nThe overall versatility of the jacket make them easy to grab in a pinch, even when looking to transform an outfit.\n\"It’s a very classic silhouette that we can really wear with sort of anything,\" Richard explains. \"It goes with those clothes and looks that are a little bit dressier; that [denim] jacket is going to turn them into more casual looks.\"\nIf you don't own this wardrobe essential already — or if you're wanting to add more denim jackets to your collection — we found top-rated picks below that can easily become your year-round staples. Keep scrolling or use the links below to learn more.\nWhat to look for | Finding the right fit | Editor-approved picks | More denim jackets | How we chose | Meet our experts\nWhat to look for when shopping for a denim jacket?\nRichard notes that there are a few key factors shoppers should keep in mind when searching for the right denim jacket:\nFunction. \"It really depends on the function and where you’re going to wear it,\" Richard says. Are you going to be dressing up a casual summer outfit? Or throwing it over your shoulder to layer over an airport outfit?\nStyle. Are you going for a more light-washed look? Or are you looking to darken the hues of your closet with a dark-washed jacket? Do you prefer oversized or fitted? What kind of collar, sleeves or silhouette are you looking for? These are all questions Richard recommends keeping in mind.\nBody type and fit. Richard also suggests evaluating your body type and how a denim jacket might feel, fit and look. \"[Keep] in mind the styles overall just to make sure we don’t blindly follow the trends. ... When you pick the jacket, [make sure] it’s actually going to fit your silhouette,\" she says. Richard adds that those with wider hips might opt for a shorter jacket that will help accentuate their silhouette. On the other hand, those who like \"boyish\" oversized tees might instead go for oversized jackets that will provide a similar style and structure.\nDurability. Finally, while it's difficult to determine the quality of a jacket while online shopping or viewing it on the hanger in a store, Richard says that finding one that has longevity means you won't ruin it after a wash, nor will you have to buy a new one often.\nHow to find the right fit for denim jackets\nFinding the right fit depends on personal preference. According to SVP of denim design at Madewell Mary Pierson, the perfect fit is not “too long, short or oversized.”\nIn terms of colors and washes, “I like to opt for a medium to light wash as it pairs well with a wide range of outfits. Then depending on current trends, you might also find oversized or cropped versions available. I recommend looking for ones with classic details like double-needle stitching, metal shank buttons, and flap front pockets,” adds Pierson.\nAlso, a classic fit \"serves as a timeless staple, offering a balanced silhouette that’s neither too loose nor too tight.\"\nIf you prefer something more oversized, she recommends thinking about your look options. \"Consider how you’d like to style it—whether you prefer a traditional, fitted look or are interested in experimenting with oversized or cropped styles to suit your style and latest trends,\" says Pierson.\nBest denim jackets, according to editors\nTsher Oversized Vintage Washed Denim Jacket\n- Very comfortable and stylish\n- Only goes up to size XL\nColors: Four | Fit: Oversized, relaxed | Length: At the hip | Pockets: Four | Fabric: 98% cotton, 2% spandex | Sizes: S-XL | Care: Machine-wash with cold water\n“I LOVE this jacket.

I love it. This is an updated version of mine. I like that it has stretch, since mine is rigid and sometimes it’s a little tight when trying to wear over a long-sleeve bulkier shirt.

Associate editor Kamari Stewart loves this one and she says, \"I always get compliments on it. I got my normal size but it’s oversized enough that I can still wear a hoodie underneath.

It will hold the shape. If you wash it, the denim is always going to hold the shape. That’s just a very trendy thing. It’s very classic,\" she explains, citing Levi's denim jackets as an example.\nAccording to Richard, leather jackets require more \"specific\" styling.\n\"It does fit into more of the rocker chic style, but denim is, again, so much more versatile. It’s a little bit more casual, it’s not as heavy as leather. Leather jackets can be very warm and heavy,\" she explains.\nAgain, unlike denim skirts (which are rising again in popularity as of late) and tried-and-true denim jeans , it all comes down to how flexible you can be when styling a denim jacket, explains Richard.\n\"[Denim skirts have] one of those silhouettes that [are] more difficult. ... I hear from women, 'I don’t want to wear jeans because it’s ... very casual, everyone wears jeans; I want to dress it up,'\" she says. Denim jackets, on the other hand, can function in a wider set of scenarios. \"You can wear it in the winter; you can wear it in the summer,\" Richard adds.\nWhen it comes to denim, \"there are no rules to it,\" regardless of season, Richard says. \"It is a layering piece, but you can throw it just on top of the shoulders. Think of it as an accessory, almost,\" she adds.\nHow we chose\nWe selected the most popular styles based on the expert's recommendations and asked our editors for their tried-and-truth pieces.
