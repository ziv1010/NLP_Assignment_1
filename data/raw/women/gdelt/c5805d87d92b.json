  "body_text": "Jarrett Stidham’s wife, Kennedy Stidham, clearly used the recent winter weather as inspiration for her show-stopping 2025 AFC Championship outfit.\nKennedy, 29, wore a white, turtleneck bodysuit for the Sunday, January 25, divisional title game between the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots. She completed her look with a coordinating fuzzy coat, a silver chain hanging off her waist and matching metallic hoop earrings.\nFor a pop of color, Kennedy sported a pair of black knee-high riding boots, black leather gloves and a small football-shaped handbag. Kennedy’s purse, naturally, shows off her allegiance to Jarrett’s Broncos. The front of the charcoal-colored clutch featured the team’s logo below “Broncos” in white lettering.\n“Let’s go!!!!!!” Kennedy captioned a selfie of her game day ensemble.\nKennedy and Jarrett, 29, have been married since 2019, going on to welcome three children together. She has also been by his side throughout his NFL career, which led him to the Broncos in 2023. Jarrett served as Bo Nix’s backup quarterback in the 2025-2026 season. He is now the organization’s starter after Nix’s season-ending injury during the divisional round of the playoffs earlier this month. (Jarrett is the first quarterback to make his season debut in a conference championship since Roger Staubach took the field for the Dallas Cowboys in 1972.)\n“This is not about myself. First of all, obviously, my thoughts and prayers have been with Bo since Saturday night. I mean, it’s crushing,” Jarrett said during a Wednesday, January 21, press conference about taking over as the starting quarterback. “He’s one of my best friends. … I see Bo more than I see my kids, so it’s just one of those things.”\nHe continued, “You spend so much time with someone, you see how hard they work, how good of a teamwork they are and then [an injury] happens and you just feel crushed for him and everything. My prayers and stuff have been with him.”\nIn addition to sending Nix, 25, well wishes for a speedy recovery, Jarrett is focused on clinching the AFC title. (The winner of the AFC championship will play either the Seattle Seahawks or the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LX next month.)\n“Every week I’ve always — going back to when I was backing up Russ — I’ve prepared the same every single week like I am the starter,” Jarrett told reporters, referring to Russell Wilson, former starting quarterback for the Broncos starting in 2022. “My preparation [now] hasn’t changed one bit, and that’s just kind of how I view it.”\nJarrett further noted that he hadn’t treated his “preparation any differently” going into Sunday’s game.\n“I’m just going to go out there and play and be myself,” he stated. “I think that’s the biggest thing. I’m not going to try and to be somebody that I’m not. I know that I can play, and I know the kind of guys I got around me and the kind of team that we have. So, we all just have to play within ourselves.”\nAs Jarrett hits the field for each game, he always has Kennedy and their family ready to cheer him on.\n“What matters most 🤍,” Kennedy captioned January 10 footage via Instagram of her brood on the sidelines. “AFC west champs, #1 seed, & now playoffs time!!!!”",
