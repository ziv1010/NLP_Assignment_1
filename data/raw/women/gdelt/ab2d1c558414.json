And, yes, he thereby gave the Trump-haters what they’ve been drooling for ever since he whipped them in 2016.\n“They insisted on a mug shot, and I agreed to do that,” said Trump. “It is not a comfortable feeling — especially when you’ve done nothing wrong.”\nThe Trump-haters no doubt loved it, but they might want to be careful what they’ve clamored for. Because Donald Trump’s mug shot is the scowl that launched a million shirts.\nA quick trip to the MAGA store confirms just this. Team Trump has already seized the marketing moment and turned this ostensible setback into a fundraising bonanza. Brand new “NEVER SURRENDER” T-shirts, coffee mugs, beverage coolers, and car stickers are all available for purchase. And can baby onesies and cornhole boards be far behind?\nAs an indication of just how petty the Trump-deranged Democrats (but we repeat ourselves) are, they’re now incensed about some of Trump’s booking statistics. He’s not 6'3\", and he’s definitely not 215 pounds! they shrieked.\nAs it turns out, Team Svelte Trump submitted these stats in advance of his booking in order to speed up the process. And it worked: Trump was in and out of jail last night in around 15 minutes. Here again, Trump is teeing up the football. And here again, the Democrats are Charlie Brown.\nYes, Democrats, be careful what you wished for. Because if any mug shot could ever cut both ways, it’d be this one. What Democrats see as the bagging of Le Bête Orange, Trump’s legions see as the ultimate rallying cry and the symbol of the endless persecution of the nation’s 45th president.\nAnd perhaps, somewhere in the middle, folks who don’t tend to fixate on politics might see this as the straw that broke their centrist backs. Oh, sure, as American Majority founder Ned Ryun told Sean Hannity last night, “The low-information chardonnay sippers in the suburbs next fall are going to think, ‘Well, he must’ve been guilty of something.’” But perhaps even more of them will look at the oddity of four indictments conveniently coming down the pike in rapid-fire succession a full 30 months after Trump left office and just in time for the 2024 presidential campaign. And perhaps they’ll see the 91 felony counts against a former president and the potential punishment of 700 years in prison as, oh, a bit excessive.\nPerhaps.\nJust like a Rorschach test, Americans are increasingly viewing their politics in black and white. Donald Trump’s mug shot is no exception.\nAs for the architect of that mug shot, Fulton County DA Fani Willis might soon have some ‘splaining to do regarding her indictment of Trump for the non-crime of objecting to a presidential election. She’s deeply political and demonstrably hard-left, and she’s refusing to answer whether she’s been coordinating with Special Counsel Jack Smith, the federal prosecutor overseeing the probes into Trump’s actions around the events of January 6 and his alleged mishandling of government records at his Mar-a-Lago estate. We mention all this because such coordination would be a serious no-no. As the Washington Examiner reports:\nThe House Judiciary Committee is launching an investigation into Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, demanding the prosecutor turn over key information detailing the criminal indictment of former President Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\nIn a letter sent by Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) on Thursday, the committee leader accused Willis of using the 41-count indictment to interfere with the presidential election, of which Trump is the current GOP front-runner. The request for information comes just hours before Trump is expected to surrender himself to Fulton County officials for his arraignment in the case.\nAs Jordan’s letter notes: “News outlets have reported that your office and Mr. Smith 'interviewed many of the same witnesses and reviewed much of the same evidence’ in reaching your decision to indict President Trump. The House Committee on the Judiciary … thus may investigate whether federal law enforcement agencies or officials were involved in your investigation or indictment.”\nAdditionally, Jordan cites Willis’s purported launch of a new campaign fundraising site “that highlighted [her] investigation into President Trump” several days before her office indicted him. How’s that for blind justice?\n“We cannot,” said Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, “turn into a banana republic, where the party in power uses police force to indict and arrest its political opponents in the middle of an election. That is not how we do it in the United States of America.”\nIn Joe Biden’s America it is, and fair-minded Americans of every political stripe should resoundingly reject it come next November.\nConfirming a Gender Clinic Whistleblower’s Claims\nThe New York Times almost committed actual journalism in a report about “transgender” kids.\nNate Jackson\nAt least The New York Times didn’t wait a year and a half like the “newspaper of record” did to confirm that Hunter Biden’s laptop was real.\nOn February 9, 2023, a whistleblower named Jamie Reed wrote an op-ed for The Free Press — founded by New York Times refugee Bari Weiss to allow for real journalism — to tell the world about some of the horrific abuse being perpetrated on kids she thought she was “saving” in her work at a gender clinic at St. Louis Children’s Hospital. We covered it the next day.\nThe Times? Meh, we’ll get around to it in six months.\nJournalism takes time, we suppose. But so does thorough partisan hackery.\nReed introduced herself in February as “a queer woman, and politically to the left of Bernie Sanders,” and she’s married to a “transgender man.” She left the clinic because instead of helping people, she and her fellow workers were “permanently harming the vulnerable patients in our care.” The big news is that the Times confirmed most of the things Reed alleged, though maintaining, “It’s clear the St. Louis clinic benefited many adolescents.”\nThe Times quoted an email sent by one nurse at the clinic, who was concerned that “no one is ever told no.” That right there is one of the foundational problems in the entire trans movement.\nThe Times notes that it’s not clear whether the treatment being offered to virtually every patient was right, even by leftist standards. “As demand rose, more patients arrived with complex mental health issues,” the report said. “The clinic’s staff often grappled with how best to help, documents show, bringing into sharp relief a tension in the field over whether some children’s gender distress is the root cause of their mental health problems, or possibly a transient consequence of them.”\nIn fact: “Doctors prescribed hormones to patients who had obtained [quick] approvals, even adolescents whose medical histories raised red flags. Some of these patients later stopped identifying as transgender, and received little to no support from the clinic after doing so.”\nThat’s because this social contagion is only allowed to go one direction.\nUnfortunately, Reed never mentioned money as a motivator for the burgeoning “transgender” industry, and the word “money” doesn’t show up in the Times exposé either. But make no mistake: Money is a primary driver of this butchery. Ideological bankruptcy notwithstanding, doctors, clinics, and other snake-oil peddlers rake in enormous piles of money by creating lifelong patients who continue needing round after round of “affirming care.”\nReed also took her allegations to Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who opened an investigation of the clinic. The Times says, “Missouri’s ban of gender care for minors will begin on Aug. 28.” Apparently, that was all the Times needed to utterly twist the story. Its headline says it: “How a Small Gender Clinic Landed in a Political Storm.”\nUh, maybe by butchering kids to cash in on an ideological cult?\nEssentially, while the Times admits that nearly all of what Reed charged was correct, most of its article is dedicated to talking about the “unrelenting surge in demand” of young people struggling immensely with their need for “affirming care.”\n“Opened in 2017 inside a children’s hospital affiliated with Washington University in St. Louis, the prestigious clinic was welcomed by many families as a godsend,” the Times gushes. “It was the only place for hundreds of miles where distressed adolescents could see a team of experts to help them transition to a different gender.”\nIn other words, mistakes were made, but it’s just because the clinic was understaffed and the intrepid clinic workers were just so “overwhelmed” by the need for their services, “all while facing intense political pressure and an adolescent mental health crisis.”\nSpeaking of that crisis, the Times expresses practically no curiosity while reporting this nugget:\nTheir patients were part of a striking generational change: Between 2017 and 2020, about 1.4 percent of 13- to 17-year-olds in the United States identified as transgender, nearly double the rate from a few years earlier.\nOn the same day of the Times report, the American Medical Association’s JAMA Network Open published findings about the frequency of such “treatments.” Among those findings is the fact that gender surgeries in the U.S. tripled between 2016 and 2019, going from 4,500 procedures to 13,000. Fewer than 1,200 were minors, but that’s 1,200 too many.\nIsn’t it odd that there’s been a sudden explosion of young people, especially girls, claiming to be “transgender”? Why, it’s almost like it’s a social contagion caused by social media and that aforementioned ideological cult. In any case, the Times shrugs and moves on.\nThanks to Reed and others who know that this is a plague of abuse, more states and even members of Congress are working to end it.\nExecutive News Summary\nFEMA disaster training irony, Biden is losing non-white males, Disney fleeced taxpayers, and more.\nThomas Gallatin & Jordan Candler\nCross-Examination\nFEMA disaster training irony: While the wildfire on the island of Maui was beginning to spread, Maui’s top emergency management officials were on another Hawaiian island, Oahu, at an annual FEMA disaster training meeting. Furthermore, after these officials were alerted to the wildfire, they waited five hours before finally responding to the situation. Among those officials was Herman Andaya, who infamously decided against sounding emergency sirens on Maui, defending the decision by claiming that doing so would not have saved anyone. Survivors dispute Andaya’s claim, contending that if people had just 10 or 15 minutes more warning, then more of them would have gotten to safety. With at least 115 people dead and almost 400 still missing, Andaya’s excuse appears dubious. Andaya has since resigned, but questions have been raised as to why he was hired to the position of emergency management administrator in the first place. Andaya had no background in emergency response, and 40 other people with greater qualification and experience were passed over for the position when he was appointed back in 2017.\nBiden and exploited migrant minors: Joe Biden’s Department of Labor is under investigation by the department’s Office of Inspector General over reports of a potential illegal child labor scandal. The IG is probing whether thousands of unaccompanied minors the Biden administration has released into the country are being used for forced labor. Back in June, Senator Josh Hawley highlighted Biden’s failure to secure the southern border: “This administration has let tens of thousands of children be sold into slavery. They are doing nothing about it.” According to Bloomberg: “Agency officials said in July that over the past 10 months alone, the DOL’s wage division has concluded 765 cases involving 4,474 children employed in violation of federal child labor laws. Overall, the department reported that it’s seen a 69% increase child labor violations from 2018 and 2022.” This is just one of the many devastating consequences of Biden’s border malfeasance.\nBiden is losing non-white males: Folks across the country aren’t happy living in Joe Biden’s America. Bidenflation has made everyone poorer, and his administration’s attempt to gaslight the public with “Bidenomics” — the claim that the economy is do well and getting better — isn’t working. Evidence of this is seen in the number of Americans who are pessimistic about the future. In fact, Politico recently reported that this pessimism toward Biden is growing fast among a usually strong Democrat constituency: men of color. Non-white men have soured on Biden, which is bad news for his 2024 reelection bid. While the majority of this constituency hasn’t jumped ship and joined the GOP, they are not interested in casting a vote for Biden.\nOver half of imprisoned “transgenders” are there for sex crimes: A recent investigation conducted by The Heritage Foundation’s Oversight Project into the state of Wisconsin’s corrections records found that over half of male prisoners who self-identify as “transgender” women were convicted for sexual assault or sexual abuse crimes. At issue is whether Wisconsin is obliging transfer requests from these male prisoners, which as of April 2022 numbered 161, to be moved into female prison facilities. “Men belong with men and men only in prison,” stated Oversight Project Director Mike Howell. “Putting sex offender men claiming to be women in cells with women is another reason the world laughs at America’s moral decline. Prison is for punishment, not degenerate sexual behavior.” Exactly.\nDisney fleeced FL taxpayers: Disney’s decision to cross swords with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the state’s Republican-led legislature has not only cost the company its sweetheart self-governance deal, the Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID), but it has also served to expose the Magic Kingdom for being more full of ugly step sisters than Cinderellas. According to a recent report from the Central Florida Tourism District (CFTOD) that replaced the RCID: “For decades, the former Disney-run RCID used taxpayer funds to provide season passes and amusement experiences to its employees and their family members, cover the cost of discounts on hotels, merchandise, food, and beverages, and give its own board members VIP Main Entrance passes. In 2022 alone, it cost taxpayers over $2.5 million.” Upon discovering this scheme, the CFTOD board immediately “set in motion plans to eliminate it.” No more special perks on the taxpayers’ dime.\nHeadlines\nTrump makes first post on X in over two years after being booked into jail (Fox News)\n“46 Democrat senators voted for it”: Jen Psaki faces fact-check tidal wave over abortion claim (Daily Wire)\nHere’s where Republican presidential candidates stand on pro-life policies after the GOP debate (The Federalist)\nDOJ files lawsuit accusing SpaceX of hiring discrimination against refugees, asylum seekers (Fox Business)\nU.S. national debt continues to soar amid excessive spending and surging deficits (Forbes)\nFederal court in Maryland says parents don’t have “a fundamental right” to opt kids out of radical gender theory curriculum (Daily Wire)\nKremlin denies taking down plane allegedly carrying Wagner warlord who crossed Putin (Fox News)\nPolicy: How China’s crumbling real-estate market puts the world economy at risk (The Federalist)\nHumor: Trump pays $12 extra to get the cool laser background mug shot (Babylon Bee)\nFor more editors’ choice headlines, click here.\nBidenomics Sends Mortgage Rates Soaring\nThere are ominous signs in the housing market, and indications that we’ve forgotten the lessons of 2008.\nBrian Mark Weber\nMortgage rates are literally going through the roof, as Joe Biden might say.\nHe’s serious, he’s not joking, and this is not hyperbole.\nYes, thanks to the spending binge of Biden and the Democrats, inflation is making everything more expensive. To put it simply, whenever the government prints money it doesn’t have, the value of the dollar decreases. And while our money loses its purchasing power, prices of goods and services increase. Unsurprisingly, we’ve watched prices rising steadily in the grocery aisles, on the car lot, and in the real estate market.\nThis is certainly bad news not only for home buyers but also for those stuck with a home that’s too expensive to sell.\n“Higher mortgage rates exacerbate the supply situation,” reports CNBC. “Current homeowners are reluctant to list their homes for sale because the vast majority of them have rates around or below 3%. To move to another home would mean more than doubling that rate. It has created what is now being called ‘golden handcuffs’ among potential sellers.”\nCNBC adds: “The average on the 30-year fixed last year at this time was around 5.5%. For someone buying a $400,000 home, with 20% down on a 30-year fixed loan, the monthly payment today, with principal and interest, is roughly $420 more than it would have been a year ago.”\nIt’s no wonder that many who purchased a home in 2023 already wish they hadn’t. According to one report, more than half of Americans think it’s a bad time to sell and a bad time to buy a home. Even worse, since 2022 the percentage of home buyers who regret their purchase has risen from 72% to 93%, with 62% of recent homebuyers struggling to make their mortgage payments.\n“Even prior to this recent surge in mortgage rates,” reports Fortune, “housing affordability, as monitored by the Atlanta Fed, had already deteriorated beyond the levels seen at the housing bubble’s peak in 2006. Once this latest mortgage rate surge is factored in, August 2023 will become the worst month for housing affordability this century.”\nNo wonder demand for mortgages is at a three-decade low.\nBut how did we get to this point? According to Fortune: “The journey to this predicament can be traced back to last year’s sharp rise in mortgage rates, which escalated from 3% to over 7%. That rate surge, coupled with the Pandemic Housing Boom pushing U.S. home prices up over 40% in just over two years, deteriorated housing affordability (or better put the lack thereof) across the nation.”\nAnd it gets worse.\nAs Fox Business reports, “On top of high mortgages, there’s also a nationwide housing supply crunch: sales of previously owned homes tumbled 2.2% in July, while the National Association of Home Builders reported new home construction sentiment dropped six points in August.”\nAs proof that history repeats itself, we’re also making some of the same mistakes that led to the 2008 market crash. Some of these mistakes are intentional, too — such as the Biden administration forcing potential home buyers with higher credit scores to pay more for financing a home in order to shuffle money to those with poor credit scores. Hey, what could go wrong?\n“Progressives claim these rules need to be altered so those who have historically had a harder time breaking into the housing market can get a shot,” write Edward Pinto and Tobias Peter of The Wall Street Journal. “This approach has backfired. The last great credit expansion, done with the goal of expanding homeownership in the runup to the 2008 crisis, left some 14 million borrowers, many of them minorities, seriously behind on their mortgages as home prices crashed by more than 25%.”\nFor those who claim that the overall numbers for home sales in the past few years aren’t bad at all, that’s in part because real estate investors and corporations are buying up homes and turning them into rentals to take advantage of soaring rental rates.\nRight now, the news isn’t good for those who want to buy or sell a home, but let’s hope the 2024 election brings about new leadership that fixes the economy and prevents a housing crash and another Great Recession like we saw in 2008. That’s a history none of us want to see repeated.\nShouldn’t Journalists Favor Debates?\nIt would be nice if journalists could be humble enough to let the process play out throughout this year without slamming the fast-forward button.\nTim Graham\nThe first Republican presidential debate was feisty and substantive. Fox News overwhelmingly focused on policy issues that voters care about. A debate was seriously overdue; the television networks have shut out coverage of policy issues like they are protecting the public from a deadly plague.\nEven so, the same journalists who uncork grand proclamations about how democracy is precious seem to suggest this debate was a waste of time. Former President Donald Trump is so far ahead in very premature polling, why bother? This neatly lines up with Team Trump’s talking points.\nTake USA Today’s Susan Page, claiming, “It was as though most of the other contenders were living in an alternative universe, one in which Trump didn’t command a lead of more than 40 percentage points in the Republican race,” meaning the RealClearPolitics average of national polls.\nAn alternative universe? As if pretending there were no other contenders doesn’t sound like an alternative universe?\nOn ABC, Jonathan Karl similarly summarized the candidate event: “We got to see a world, maybe it’s a fantasy land. We got to see a world where Donald Trump was not a candidate, for a moment.” Karl said it was a lively and substantive debate, but a fantasy: “And then you realize, we don’t live in that world.”\nOn CBS, John Dickerson asserted the debate “felt like a job interview in which there is already an internal candidate. … In other words, the interviews take place, all the motions are gone through, but the person’s already been picked.”\nJournalists are saying the quiet part out loud. But that’s simply not true. In the NBC/Des Moines Register poll of Iowa voters, 52% of likely GOP caucusgoers have a first choice for president and say they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. In other words, the incumbent may have the upper hand, but there’s a lot of room for debates.\nTrump is leading Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in that NBC poll by 42% to 19%. Eight years ago, a CNN poll in mid-August showed Trump leading former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush by 24% to 13%.\nIf journalists really cared about democracy and voting, they wouldn’t be so mercilessly quick to declare everyone except Trump is toast. If they all think Trump is “dangerous for democracy,” as “CBS Mornings” co-host Tony Dokoupil insisted to Nikki Haley, why do they sound like debates (with or without Trump) are beside the point?\nAll this premature speculation feels like NFL football writers deciding who has won the Super Bowl before the preseason is over. If journalists actually respected the will of the people, they would wait and let the actual primary elections happen before they imply the primary elections are pointless.\nIn a New York Times podcast on the “sputtering” DeSantis campaign before the debate, reporter Shane Goldmacher interviewed voters and seemed a bit surprised: “A lot of these people were just barely beginning their understanding of these candidates. And a lot of them were just interested in learning more. I mean, the thing about talking to voters at this stage of a race is you’re reminded how early it is.”\nDebate season is when voters are just starting to pay attention, and the “pro-democracy” press is suggesting it’s a “fantasyland” that these people might form an opinion outside the current “wisdom.”\nMaybe Trump’s indictment-enhanced advantage will remain. But it would be nice if journalists could be humble enough to let the process play out throughout this year without slamming the fast-forward button.\nCOPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM\nA Foolish Generation\nHow moral relativism, technology, and lockdowns have shaped the behavior of our culture.\nEmmy Griffin\nNo rules, no right and wrong, live your truth, the “me generation”: these are all apt descriptions of our modern culture’s moral values. Moral relativism along with the infiltration of technology and the boredom of the COVID lockdowns have metastasized into a genuinely heartless generation.\nThe motto of the era is “you do you,” and that is leading to all sorts of chaos. As Federalist writer Maureen Mullarkey points out, we can mark our own cultural decline by the influx of amoral celebrities as the leaders of public voices and by the lack of public intellectuals.\nShe also throws out this disturbing stat: “The word ‘influencer’ is no longer an ordinary noun; it has become a career goal. To some 26 percent of today’s young people, it eclipses occupational choices that require training and formal qualifications like a college degree. The thrill of online affirmation, measured in followers, crowds out time-honored pride in useful work.”\nMullarkey accurately traces the start of this descent into cultural decline with the advent of screens. When this writer was training to be an elementary school teacher, it was common knowledge that screens, particularly personal screens like phones and tablets, were not good for children’s brain development. The overstimulation of the blue light alone is rewiring their brains. Now, though, it’s not talked about as much because there is a big push in education and really in all spheres of life to modernize with personal screens.\nBut alas, it is a Faustian bargain, and the trade-off of books for screens is taking its terrible toll.\nBesides the warped world of life on screens and through social media, another disturbing aspect appears through our modern notion of dating and relationships. There is the whole kerfuffle of online dating that is more often used for a one-night stand than for finding a serious long-term relationship.\nPart of the problem goes back to the moral relativism so celebrated in our culture. It prohibits more serious people from feeling like they can be honest about what they want. It manipulates both men and women into settling for a lifestyle that they really don’t want but culture says they should celebrate (hookup culture, ghosting, living with someone before marriage, and other risky behaviors).\nNo one is happy in the long term, and everyone pursing this is ultimately so lonely. The lack of taking love and relationships seriously is another factor messing with this foolish generation.\nPodcaster Matt Walsh in a show this week addressed another interesting aspect that has been exacerbated by the lockdowns: the lack of etiquette people show during performances.\nDuring the COVID pandemic, people got used to doing everything for their social media accounts, including all sorts of behavior that, in a kinder time, would have gotten them kicked out or arrested. These range from the rude (scrolling on their phones during a performance or movie) to disruptive (throwing things at performers on stage). These people are so addicted to their screens and so addicted to propping up their own social media profile that they are willing to do just about anything for clicks.\nNo such thing as bad publicity, right? Wrong.\nThe attitude of self-centeredness is not unique to our generation, though the technology certainly is. There is nothing new under the sun. In the Bible, the book of Judges cites over and over again the struggles that God’s chosen people had with following him. They were constantly doing “what was right in their own eyes.” Pastor John MacArthur called this period of Bible history “an age of absolute moral chaos.”\nOur foolish generation must abandon moral relativism — which enables and glorifies all atrocity and evil — lest they follow it to its logical, disastrous conclusion. The cure in Judges was total repentance and turning back toward God. That is also the cure for today’s moral decay. Let’s pray that miracle happens.\nVIDEOS\nMike Rowe and the Burn Pit Whistleblower — Dan Clare, Iraq War veteran and Chief Communications and Outreach Officer for Disabled American Veterans, explains the circumstances that led him to blow the whistle on the Iraq burn pits.\nHilary Got Wasted — Hurricane Hilary’s desperately needed, expensive, and scarce fresh water just flowed right through Los Angeles, straight out into the Pacific.\nJordan Peterson Responds to Reeducation Order — A Canadian court orders preeminent psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson to undergo social media “sensitivity” training.\nSurely Not — Big Pharma needs money.
