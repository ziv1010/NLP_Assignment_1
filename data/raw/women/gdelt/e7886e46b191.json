Nearly 25 million people - half of Sudan’s population - need aid as famine has taken hold in at least one displacement camp.\nBut counting the dead has been challenging.\nEven in peace time, many deaths are not registered in Sudan, researchers say. As fighting intensified, people were cut off from places that record deaths, including hospitals, morgues and cemeteries. Repeated disruptions to internet services and telecommunications left millions unable to contact the outside world.\nThe study “tried to capture that invisibility” using a sampling technique known as “capture-recapture”, said lead author Maysoon Dahab, an infectious disease epidemiologist and co-director of the Sudan Research Group.\nImpact Shorts\nMore ShortsOriginally designed for ecological research, the technique has been used in published studies to estimate the number of people killed during pro-democracy protests in Sudan in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic, when it was not possible to carry out full counts, she said.\nUsing data from at least two independent sources, researchers look for individuals who appear on multiple lists. The less overlap there is between the lists, the higher the chances that deaths have gone unrecorded, information that can be used to estimate the full number of deaths.\nIn this case, researchers compiled three lists of the dead.\nOne was based on a public survey circulated via social media platforms between November 2023 and June 2024. The second used community activists and other “study ambassadors” to distribute the survey privately within their networks. And the third was compiled from obituaries posted on social media, a common practice in the cities of Khartoum, Omdurman and Bahri, which together make up the greater capital.\n“Our findings suggest that deaths have largely gone undetected,” the researchers wrote.\nUncounted toll\nDeaths captured in the three lists made up just 5 per cent of the estimated total for Khartoum state and 7 per cent of those attributed to “intentional injury”. The findings suggest that other war-affected parts of the country could have experienced similar or worse tolls, the study said.\nThe researchers noted that their estimate of violent deaths in Khartoum state surpassed the 20,178 killings recorded across the country over the same period by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project (ACLED), a U.S.-based crisis monitoring group.\nACLED’s data, which is based on reports from sources including news organisations, human rights groups and local authorities, has been cited by U.N. officials and other humanitarian workers.\nDahab said the researchers did not have sufficient data to estimate mortality levels in other parts of the country or determine how many deaths in all could be linked to the war.\nThe study also notes other limitations. The methodology used assumes that every death has an equal chance of showing up in the data, for example. However, well-known individuals and those who suffered violent deaths may have been more likely to be reported, the researchers said.\nPaul Spiegel, who heads the Center for Humanitarian Health at the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and was not involved in the study, said there were issues with all three sources of data that could skew the estimates. But he said the researchers had factored such limitations into their methodology and analysis.\n“While it is difficult to know how the various biases in this capture-recapture methodology could affect the overall numbers, it is a novel and important attempt to estimate the number of deaths and bring attention to this horrific war in Sudan,” he said.\nAn official with the Sudanese American Physicians Association, an organisation that offers free healthcare across the country, said the findings appeared credible.\n“The number might even be more,” its programme manager, Abdulazim Awadalla, told Reuters, saying weakened immunity from malnutrition was making people more susceptible to infection.\n“Simple diseases are killing people,” he said.\nThe study was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.\n‘We buried him here’\nAmong the war’s many victims was Khalid Sanhouri, a musician whose death in Omdurman’s Mulazmeen neighbourhood was announced on social media in July last year.\nA neighbour, Mohammed Omar, told Reuters that friends and relatives were unable to get medical care for Sanhouri after he fell ill due to the intensity of the fighting at the time.\n“There were no hospitals or pharmacies where we could get medicine, not even markets to buy food,” Omar said.\nThey couldn’t even reach the nearest graveyard.\n“So, we buried him here,” Omar said, pointing to a grave just beyond the bullet-pocked wall surrounding the musician’s home.\nHundreds of graves have popped up next to homes across greater Khartoum since last year, residents say. With the return of the army to some neighbourhoods, they have started relocating the bodies to Omdurman’s main cemetery.\nThere are as many as 50 burials a day there, undertaker Abdin Khidir told Reuters. The cemetery has expanded into an adjoining football field.\nStill, the bodies keep coming, Khidir said.\nThe warring sides have traded blame for the growing toll.\nArmy spokesman Brigadier General Nabil Abdallah referred questions about the study’s estimates to the Ministry of Health but said: “The main cause of all this suffering is the terrorist Rapid Support militia (RSF), which has not hesitated from the first moment to target civilians.”\nThe health ministry said in a statement to Reuters that it has observed far fewer deaths than the estimates in the study. Its tally of war-related deaths stands at 5,565, it said.\nThe RSF did not dispute the study’s estimates, blaming the deaths in the capital on “deliberate air strikes on populated areas, in addition to artillery shelling and drone strikes.”\n“It is known that the army is the only one with [such weapons],” it said in a statement to Reuters.\nThe war erupted from a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule. The RSF quickly took over most of the capital and has now spread into at least half the country, though the military regained control of some neighbourhoods in Omdurman and Bahri in recent months.\nBoth sides have committed abuses that may, include attacking civilians, a U.N. fact-finding mission said in September. The war has also produced ethnically driven violence in the western Darfur region blamed largely on the RSF.\nHowever, the new report highlighted the significant and likely growing toll taken by the war’s indirect impacts, including hunger, disease and the collapse of healthcare.\nSick patients lined the hallways at al-Shuhada hospital in Bahri, which has seen a spike in cases of malnutrition and diseases such as malaria, cholera and dengue fever.\nFresh fruits, vegetables and meat were hard to come by until the arrival of the army opened up supply routes, said hospital manager Hadeel Malek.\n“As we all know, malnutrition leads to weak immunity in general,” she said. “This is one factor … which led to many deaths, especially among pregnant women and children.”\nBoth sides deny impeding aid and commercial deliveries.",
