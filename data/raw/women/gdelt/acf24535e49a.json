  "body_text": "Jonas Eidevall under pressure after Arsenal suffer humbling Champions League defeat\n- Arsenal lose 5-2 to Bayern Munich in opening game\n- Forward Pernille Harder scores hat-trick in thirteen minutes\n- Eidevall: \"I am not happy with the second half\"\nArsenal were left with their tail between their legs after losing 5-2 to Bayern Munich in their 2024/25 UEFA Women's Champions League opener.\nThe Gunners started well in Germany with a goal from Mariona Caldentey helping to secure the lead, but were unlucky to concede a few minutes before half-time, with Glodis Perla Viggosdottir's effort hitting the back of the net.\nAs the second half got underway, there really wasn't much separating the two teams. It wasn't long however, until the German side became the frontrunners for the first time with Sydney Lohmann helping to give them the edge.\nIt was almost immediately after that the Gunners endured a noticeable meltdown and forward Pernille Harder was waiting up front to exploit that. The 31-year-old smashed three goals past Manuela Zinsberger within the space of 13 minutes, marking a devastating end to the game for Arsenal.\nSpeaking to media after the game, Eidevall said: \"What really strikes in the second half is how we defend the crossing situations. That is not good enough, we concede goals as a result.\n\"When it is 4-2 it is a decision to want to sit back and control the result or to go for it, and I decide to go for it. I know, of course, that is a risk and it exposes us to concede again. But I am happy and willing to take that risk at that point becauze, at the end of the day, that was the only thing to have gotten us to a point.\n\"So, I am happy with the first half, I am not happy with the second half. We look a little tired, we can't play with that same energy like we do in the first half and we definitely can't defend like we did in the second half.\"\nThe result will be hard to swallow after Arsenal's run of disappointing results which have seen them make an underwhelming start to the new Barclays Women's Super League season.\nThe Gunners are sitting sixth in the league table after winning just one of their first three games so far.\nAll eyes will certainly be on Eidevall and his team this weekend as they take on current WSL champions Chelsea at the Emirates.",
