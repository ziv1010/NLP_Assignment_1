Her consistent form has now earned her a place among the world’s top five, underlining her growing reputation as one of the finest in her position.\nRead Also: BREAKING: Dembele wins Ballon d’Or 2025\nWhile Nnadozie celebrated international acclaim, Super Falcons coach Justin Madugu narrowly missed out on global honours. The Nigerian tactician, who masterminded the WAFCON triumph earlier this year, finished behind England’s Sarina Wiegman in the race for the Johan Cruyff Award for Best Women’s Coach. Wiegman was recognised after guiding the Lionesses to the 2025 UEFA Women’s European Championship title.\nTogether, Nnadozie and Madugu’s achievements underlined Nigeria’s rising stature in women’s football on the global stage.",
