  "body_text": "Of the 31,670 people who were entered in the 2025 Boston Marathon, 28,845 runners started the race, meaning that 2,825 did not line up in Hopkinton on Monday.\nBefore the event, the Associated Press reported that there were some concerns this year among international runners about an increase in border security under the Trump administration.\nIt appears, though, that this didn’t have a significant effect on marathon turnout. This year’s no-show number is close to last year’s (2,838) and the statistic from two years ago (3,039).\nFor those who did start this year’s event, 98.4 percent completed the race, making for a finishing total of 28,284—the most since 2014.\n128 different countries were represented. The United States, of course, led the way with 18,047 finishers, while Canada had the second-most with 1,586, followed by the United Kingdom with 1,230.\nThe smallest country or territory to have a finisher was Bermuda, which has a population of just 64,555. Four people from the island started and finished the race.\nAmong participants, there were 16,103 men, 12,210 women, and 71 people who competed in the nonbinary category.\nFifty-six different U.S. states and territories were represented on the course. Massachusetts, unsurprisingly, had the most with 4,292 finishers. California was next with 1,834 and then New York at 1,493. North Dakota had the fewest finishers with just 15.\nAnd shoutout to the nine states that had a 100 percent completion rate: Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, and Oklahoma.\nAt the front of the pack, Sharon Lokedi was the winner of the women’s race, holding off reigning champion Hellen Obiri in the final mile to run a course record of 2:17:22. And John Korir—the younger brother of 2012 champ Wesley Korir—was the men’s winner in 2:04:45.\nTheo Kahler is the news editor at Runner’s World. He’s a former all-conference collegiate runner at Winthrop University, and he received his master’s degree in liberal arts studies from Wake Forest University, where he was a member of one of the top distance-running teams in the NCAA. Kahler has reported on the ground at major events such as the Paris Olympics, U.S. Olympic Trials, New York City Marathon, and Boston Marathon. He’s run 14:20 in the 5K, 1:05:36 in the half marathon, and enjoys spotting tracks from the sky on airplanes. (Look for colorful ovals around football fields.)",
