  "body_text": "Lea Schüller, Germany’s openly lesbian national-team forward, is leaving Bayern Munich to join Manchester United, effective January 1. Both clubs confirmed the move. In England, the 28-year-old will sign a contract through 2029. Schüller’s departure reflects her decision to leave the unsatisfying situation with Bayern’s women’s team and with the Germany squad.\n“The squad and the club have always felt like a second family to me, no matter the season. Here, close friendships have formed that will last forever. So it is especially hard to take this step and leave my home, my friends, and my family,” Schüller said in Bayern’s announcement.\nThe forward joined Bayern in the summer of 2020, moving from SGS Essen. Her contract with Bayern would have expired at the end of the season, and the two clubs did not disclose a transfer fee. Across competitions, Schüller appeared in 181 matches for Bayern Munich and scored 103 goals, and she lifted the German league title four times.\n“Lea has helped shape and define the most successful years of our team. With her impressive goal-scoring rate and her work rate, she contributed significantly to our achievements over five and a half years,” said Bianca Rech, Director of Women’s Football at Bayern.\nGermany’s Footballer of the Year 2022 had recently not been a regular starter for coach José Barcala. With a move, the 82-time international (54 goals) also aims to improve her standing in the Germany setup under head coach Christian Wück. During the European Championship, Schüller lost her place to Giovanna Hoffmann. After Hoffmann sustained an ACL injury, Wück has recently favored Frankfurt’s Nicole Anyomi as the center striker.\nCuriously, Bayern could face a quick reunion with Schüller, because Manchester United might be a potential Champions League quarterfinal opponent for Bayern early next year. The transfer of the forward had long been anticipated. After the final game of the year, a 3-0 victory at Leverkusen, Schüller could not play but applauded Bayern fans with tears in her eyes.\nManchester United Women currently sit fourth in the Women’s Super League, which is led by local rivals Manchester City, home to German internationals Sydney Lohmann and Rebecca Knaak.\nSchüller publicly announced in the summer that she was in a relationship with Italian footballer Martina Piemonte. A year earlier she had split from sailor Lara Vadlau. In a 2023 interview with Bunte, Schüller described love between women in the national team as “completely natural.”",
