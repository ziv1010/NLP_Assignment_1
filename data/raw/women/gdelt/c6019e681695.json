Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nIt’s a change that nearly worked though, with Estevao coming close to scoring almost immediately, but chances were at a minimum for Chelsea despite dominating the second-half.\nMore Trending\nEnzo Fernandez and Trevoh Chalobah had half-chances but for the most part Maresca’s team looked devoid of ideas, with the home support growing increasingly frustrated.\nThe Black Cats looked content with the draw, but snatched all three points when a long ball found Brian Brobbey, who held up the ball and teed up fellow substitute Talbi to drill into the bottom corner.\nMetro’s LIVE matchday blog will bring you all the build-up, confirmed team news and starting XIs, goal updates and minute-by-minute coverage.\nLive Feed\nThis Live Blog has now ended\nThis blog is now closed.

Chelsea 1-2 Sunderland\nSanchez comes up for one last Chelsea corner… it goes behind and the ref blows for full-time.\nDisaster for Chelsea, delirium for Sunderland!\nThe Black Cats are second in the Premier League!\n90+5 mins: Chelsea 1-2 Sunderland\nIt’s given!\nSanchez was in no man’s land as Talbi fired a first time shot into the bottom corner.\nIncredible scenes at Stamford Bridge.\nGOAL! Chelsea 1-2 Sunderland (Talbi)\nOH MY WORD!\nSunderland have won it in the the 93rd minute!\nUnless VAR have anything to say…\n90 mins: Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nSantos’ first contribution is to get booked. Not ideal.\nSIX minutes added on…\n86 mins: Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nA last roll of the dice from Maresca: George and Santos are on for Pedro and Neto.\n82 mins: Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nBetter from the visitors as Talbi looks to cross for Brobbey at the far post but Sanchez does well to get a touch and the danger is averted.\nBoth sides running out of time to find a winner…\n77 mins: Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nThey’ve been on the back foot since half-time but Sunderland nearly take the lead!\nOne long ball finds a marauding Xhaka but Acheampong does really well to put off the ex-Arsenal captain and he scuffs the shot.\nMaresca makes more changes: Guiu and Acheampong are off, with Gittens and Tosin on.\nFor the Black Cats, Le Fee and goalscorer Isidor come off for Brobbey and Rigg.\n70 mins: Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nIt’s taken a while but we have the first yellow card of the game.\nLe Fee is booked for a late sliding tackle on Chalobah\n68 mins: Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nOuch. Cucurella is down after being clattered by Roefs as players contested a dangerous cross.\nThe left-back receives some treatment, while Sunderland make their first sub, Talbi replaces Traore.\n63 mins: Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nSo nearly an instant impact from the sub!\nEstevao brings down Cucurella’s cross and fires a powerful shot but its deflected behind.\nIt’s been almost all Chelsea in the second-half.\n59 mins: Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nGarnacho has a pop from range… way over the bar.\nIt’s his last touch, as Maresca brings Estevao on for the goalscorer.\nSafe to say, Garnacho is NOT happy to be coming off and to be honest I can’t blame in.\n56 mins: Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nNeto does better here to win a free-kick on the right of the box.\nJames sends it in and finds Cucurella arriving at the near post. His glancing header is good but Sunderland have men back to block and clear it away.\n52 mins: Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nIt’s more of the same after the break. End-to-end action.\nLe Fee wins a free-kick off Chalobah in a dangerous position which is cleared behind for a corner. It’s dealt with and Chelsea counter.\nA mistake from the defence means its two on one, but Neto’s pass to Garnacho is poor and the attack fizzles out.\nSecond-half kick-off! Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nAnd away we go again.\nNo changes for either side.\nHalf-time! Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nNot much to report from injury time. An action-packed first-half ends and 1-1 is the right result.\nChelsea probably thought they were going to run away with this after Garnacho scored after just four minutes but Sunderland have done very well and deserve their equaliser.\nMaresca made half-time changes to save the game against Forest last week and he’ll need to do the same today.\n45 mins: Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nAnd another fine save from Roefs!\nChelsea can’t break down Sunderland’s defence, so Chalobah decides to have a pop from range. It’s a good one and a slight deflection forces Roefs to tip it over the bar.\nThe subsequent corner is cleared and we’ll have three minutes of injury time.\n43 mins: Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nNow it’s Sanchez’s turn to make a good save.\nSunderland counter and Traore takes a shot from the edge of the box but the Spaniard claims the ball with relative ease.\n42 mins: Chelsea 1-1 Sunderland\nChelsea work a corner well, as they have done all game and Garnacho is sliding in at the far post unmarked.\nHe gets his effort on target but Roefs does really well to get across and make the save.\nMORE: Man Utd 4-2 Brighton: Bryan Mbeumo scores twice as Red Devils win three in a row\nMORE: Manchester United agreed Bruno Fernandes release clause on one condition\nMORE: Ruben Amorim sends warning to £62m Manchester United star: ‘He needs to improve’",
