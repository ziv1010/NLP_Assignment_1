Only four arrests were made before and during the game, while 14 Town supporters were given direction to leave notices by British Transport Police at Norwich railway station before the game.\nMatchday policing commander Chief Superintendent Nick Davison said: \"Overall there was good spirit between both sets of fans resulting in minimal disorder.\n\"The policing operation was firm in places and these tactics were used to ensure supporters enjoyed the game and journeys to and from the stadium in a safe environment.\n\"Fourteen away fans were given direction to leave notices at Norwich train station as a result of their behaviour; enough to cause concern to officers who took this reactive measure in a bid to prevent disorder.\n“These supporters had been spoken to by police during their journey from Ipswich and were fully aware of the standards of behaviour expected but sadly their conduct fell short of this resulting in police taking action.\n\"Additional road closures were put in place to ensure the safety of those attending before and after the match and I would like to thank motorists for their co-operation during this time.”\nTwo of the arrests were for breaching direction to leave notices, one man was detained for causing criminal damage at the ground, while the fourth person was arrested for being drunk and disorderly.\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nIts a shame the team could not match the obvious premiership flair or Norwich but brute force and the hoof are not the answer to that we must improve our mid-field.\nPraise to Suffolk police though. I was having a chat with a nice one on the platform as everyone was being manhandled. He couldn't understand it either ...turns out we went to the same school. He was not in the melee, probably because he was being respectful, and treating people like human beings, and was treated the same in return.\nPlenty of thuggish behaviour about, wouldn't like to imagine what might have kicked off but for the police.\nWhat's that?\nThat unfortunately will NEVER change - and makes it all the more gut wrenching to lose to them.\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
