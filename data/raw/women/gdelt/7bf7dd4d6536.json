Having initially opened further down the road, it relocated to a bigger premises twice the size of its original location two years ago due to sheer demand.\nThe coffee shop, which also hosts regular social events and community gatherings, has become known within the football fan community, and features mural art dedicated to the Lioness player Jill, who contributed towards the team’s UEFA Women's Championship win in 2022.\nTry MEN Premium NOW for just £1\nAs well as serving as a pilgrimage spot for football fans from all over the world, including Australia, America and Hong Kong, the café has also been frequented by many sports stars and footballers over the years. Two years ago, Jamie Redknapp posed for photos with Jill and Shelly following an impromptu visit, whilst Barcelona player Ona Batlle and Chelsea star Lucy Bronze MBE were also pictured visiting recently.\nAt the weekend, popular TV presenters Ant and Dec also took the time to visit the Northenden shop for a brew. Jill, who won I’m A Celeb back in 2022, posted on Instagram on Saturday (February 7) about their most recent famous customers. She wrote: “We couldn’t believe the Nation’s Favourite Duo popped in for a coffee! Thanks so much Ant and Dec - Welcome any time!”\nThe news was met with praise from both regular Boxx2Boxx coffee as well as some famous faces, including radio presenter Adele Roberts who commented: \"Love this\". One person posted: “Whaaaaaatttt!!\" Another said: \"Omg... love it ! Xx.\"\nOne other wrote: \"Love Ant and Dec.\" Remarking about their time together in the jungle, another said: \"it’s the reunion of I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.\" One person said: \"A national treasure and the two fellas from Byker Grove!\" Another simply put: \"They found Northenden.\"\nThe two presenters, from Newcastle, are currently preparing for the return of Britain’s Got Talent, which will see Alesha Dixon, KSI, Amanda Holden and Simon Cowell return to the judging panel. The duo also host the Hanging Out With Ant & Dec podcast, as well as ITV game show Limitless Win.\nBoxx2Boxx owners Jill and Shelly said they wanted the café to be a focal point for locals in Northenden as part of their varied line-up of events, which has already included sticker swaps, walking groups, open mic nights, sports screenings and after-club coffee sessions.\nHailing the ‘wonderful community’, the pair said their intentions were also about being able to serve up a good brew. Shelly previously told the M.E.N: “Me and Jill aren’t snobby people but one of the things we are snobby about is good coffee. It wasn’t just about us having a coffee shop, it was making sure every detail was right and thankfully, people really do like our coffee.”\nBoxx2Boxx is on 399 Palatine Rd, Northenden, M22 4JS",
