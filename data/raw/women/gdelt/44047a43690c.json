  "body_text": "The American high school experience has been immortalized in innumerable books, movies, and television shows.\nHomecoming. Dances. Class trips. Friday Night Football.\nFor the class of 2024, high school was anything but normal. No one else will ever have this particular experience. In a sense, this year’s graduates are unicorns.\nThey started high school months after a global pandemic ground the world to a standstill. Many met their teachers and classmates for the first time on a computer screen. Those who went to school in person often couldn’t see their peers’ smiles. The following school year brought teacher and staff shortages.\nWhen students finally returned to campus, it was like being a freshman all over again — even though they’d been in high school for months, a year, or more, in some cases.\n“I just remember at homecoming nobody was dancing because none of us had been to a high school dance,” said Lily Fredericks, a 2024 graduate of Shorecrest High School in Shoreline. “People were just like, ‘How does this work?’ ”\nBut they adapted amid the uncertainties. They discovered new hobbies to get through the doldrums of the pandemic years. And they are now ready to take on the world — with interests and career pursuits shaped, in part, by this once-in-a-lifetime event. By the end, COVID-19 was an afterthought for many.\nThe Seattle Times asked some of the region’s graduating seniors to reflect on the last four years, about what they learned and how it shaped them.\nProject coordinated by Seattle Times staff reporter Denisa R. Superville. Photos by Seattle Times photographer Ivy Ceballo. The students’ reflections have been edited for length and clarity.\nKamaya Craig\nHeritage High School, Marysville\nKamaya Craig, 18, deepened her connection to her Tulalip Tribes community over the last four years. She plans to follow in her parents’ footsteps and become an educator who can pass on her tribe’s culture and history to a younger generation.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic profoundly impacted both my community and personal high school journey, reshaping daily life, disrupting my education and fostering resilience in the face of profound challenges.\nI am a member of the Tulalip Tribes. The pandemic disrupted our traditional way of life. The Reservation places a strong emphasis on generational ties and ceremonial gatherings. But social distancing and restrictions on large gatherings forced us to adapt quickly to new ways of interacting with one another. This sadly reminded us of a time when my people were not allowed to practice our culture in this country.\nThe Tulalip Reservation is home to more than 100 elders, who are our cultural knowledge holders. There was great fear of losing them because the virus brought up past fears about deadly illnesses spread by colonial settlers.\nWe lost a high number of tribal members at the start of the pandemic, and we were unable to support them in the hospital and give them appropriate funeral ceremonies that the Tulalip people practice and cherish communally.\nMore directly, the pandemic took away my ability to see my grandparents. Grandparents are our first parents in my culture, and it still brings me great sadness remembering holidays without them.\nI was 15 and learning from a computer screen. The anxiety and loneliness caused from wearing masks didn’t help. If it hadn’t been for sports, I am not sure how my educational journey would have continued. To keep myself socially active, I played volleyball, softball, and basketball.\nBeing at a predominantly white school for the first time (I was looking for a secondary education that better met my needs), I felt astonished by some of the perspectives on the seriousness of COVID, Trump idolization and the George Floyd tragedy. Surrounded by this, I found it difficult to center my care and focus on the tragedy happening to my tribe.\nWhile this sounds negative, it’s actually what helped make me stronger and gain the courage to transfer to a school based on the homelands of my people.\nToday, my educational journey continues. I will be attending Evergreen State College — a school I selected for its Indigenous ways of teaching.\nI believe I persevered over the last four years, regardless of the roadblocks, because I practiced the growth mindset my mother instilled in me. I also intentionally stayed devoted to my culture.\nI have learned that whatever life throws at me, I survived the pandemic. It made me resilient.\nLily Fredericks\nShorecrest High School, Shoreline\nFor Lily Fredericks, 18, the last four years have been a period of discovery: finding a new hobby, a group of teachers and friends she could count on, and realizing that a shy girl can emerge from a life-altering event confident, outspoken and a champion for her peers.\nMy recollection of my freshman year is an abyss of black with floating white names, and a single pane of one-way glass peering into my teachers’ homes. Back then, I yearned to put my shoes on and venture out into the world. Having changed school districts the year before, I longed for connection.\nI began reading Webtoons, digital comics, and lost myself in the immersive stories of cursed princesses finding self-acceptance and talking cats with superpowers. Not only were these comics escapes from my bleak reality, but, as I began to see from the creator’s notes, they were outlets for the author’s emotions.\nThe notes inspired me to create my own series, Billy the Bean, which followed a bean named Billy as he navigated high school. From the horrors of Zoom breakout rooms to the return of homecoming, much of his experiences were inspired by my own. In my first comic, Billy struggles to communicate with his peers in a breakout room, describing this endeavor as fruitless as “talking to four walls.”\nDuring the pandemic, these comics were my way of processing and sharing my emotions with the world.\nAmid this isolating experience I also discovered a pocket of belonging in a college-preparation program called AVID. I met a unique array of peers with diverse cultures and career aspirations. They thought critically and empathetically, bringing fresh insights and open minds to discussions.\nAVID became my second family when we returned to school in person. I still recall hiding my blushing face behind my hands as my AVID teacher projected my Billy the Bean comic in front of the whole class.\nMy AVID teachers and peers continually celebrated my efforts. My uncertainty in my abilities lulled from an incessant monologue to a faint whisper. I discovered the power my voice held in improving my community.\nMy timid, soft-spoken freshman self feels almost irreconcilable with who I am today: a School Board representative advocating for students at public meetings, a Highland dancer performing before a crowd, a future Army nurse training to save lives.\nI’ve come to learn to love myself through the love others have bestowed on me. When I grow up, I hope to be like my AVID teachers and peers: someone who nurtures and guides others through grief and brings light and joy to their successes.\nI’m excited to see where I’ll be 10 years from now.\nAdwaya Bage\nAnnie Wright Schools, Tacoma\nAdwaya Bage’s father treasured his boarding school years in his native India and wanted his son to have a similar experience. The small boarding school gave Bage, 18, the opportunity to be independent and learn who he was.\nI never would have guessed I would spend my freshman year behind a computer screen.\nInstead of experiencing a bowling ball exhibit to learn about Newton’s second law of motion in physics class or getting to adjust the light color on stage in theater class, I watched my teachers demonstrate these labs on screen.\nIt was similar to watching an hourlong YouTube video, six times a day. Every student struggled to engage. As the year progressed, fewer people kept their cameras on. There was no demonstrated curiosity. Microphone problems, poor internet connection and lack of interest created an environment that was simply not meant for learning. After completing assignments, I would lie in my room, pondering what to do with all this spare time.\nIronically, being home all day ended up inspiring me to become more active. One of the few things that I can say COVID manifested is exercise. I remember one odd day during this time where I managed to finally complete 10 clean push-ups.\nI also used the extra time to look into computer videos on YouTube. Fascinated by the frames-per-second output of gaming computers, I decided to build my own computer and uploaded a video of the process to YouTube. I got a staggering 50,000 views.\nSophomore year — fall 2022 — is when things finally felt real. Annie Wright was the most lively it had ever been, with students and staff eager to reconnect.\nMy roommate Joseph and I spent nights talking about our school experiences, and what we wanted to achieve. Boarding created bonding that I never experienced at my larger, public middle school.\nDuring middle school, my dad and I would talk about my future. He had big dreams for me. Sometimes he talked about me becoming the first Indian president of the United States. I did not think too much about it at the time, but his aspirations grew on me. I wanted to prove him right. Maybe not as powerful as the U.S. government, but I still wished to fulfill his request by becoming president of Annie Wright Schools’ student government.\nI joined the Legislative Assembly of The Boys School and began learning speaking skills, practicing uplifting and guiding peers to create an environment of trust.\nI built relationships, refining my speech, conversation by conversation, until everyone knew who I was. I wished to be known not for popularity, but for dependability. I wanted every student in the Boys School to have at least one person they could befriend and believe in. I became vice president of the Legislative Assembly in sophomore year and was elected president at the end of my junior year.\nAlthough I was originally focused on gaining my father’s approval, I realized that the skills I learned and the friendships I garnered from running for president had served me in ways I could not have imagined.\nBecca Bryan\nFriday Harbor High School, Friday Harbor\nRemote learning was a disaster for many students. But not for Becca Bryan, 18. She thrived during that period, away from the perfumes, harsh lights and other triggers that made it hard for her to focus when she’s in a school building.\nMy life revolved around treatments and doctors during elementary and middle school. I remember being unsure that I would survive to go to high school. I had no expectations regarding high school.\nTo protect me — a neurodivergent person with many medical conditions, including Mast Cell Activation Syndrome — my family left Seattle for San Juan Island in March 2020, just days after schools closed. Surprisingly, socializing with my Seattle friends was accessible online. Hours online cemented relationships that might have otherwise faded.\nOnline school was easier. Being in a school building can be problematic because of MCAS, chronic migraine and central pain sensitization. Perfumes can trigger hypotension and nausea, overhead lighting causes migraines, and the typical classroom seating causes increased back pain, unless I have accessible seating. During remote classes, I controlled these variables, which allowed me to direct my energy toward learning.\nI benefited from special education services (for neurodivergence and chronic health issues) in small groups during remote learning. I was able to ask questions and get answers quickly. One drawback was that my dyslexia meant that learning Spanish remotely wasn’t feasible.\nIn the spring of 2021, we went to half a day at school, which allowed time for activities, like swimming, training a pony and working out. I got a puppy and trained her, with help, to become my service dog, who I will take to college next year. I found myself watching true crime and other shows that incorporated ethics and psychology, leading me to realize that I wanted to study psychology in college.\nI know myself better and have a clearer vision of what I want for my life because of the pandemic.\nHiyab Negash\nNathan Hale High School, Seattle\nHiyab Negash, 18, is pretty clear that in middle school she wasn’t the kind of student who would sign up to join a student-leadership group. It turns out, she was wrong.\nI am a daughter of two hardworking, dedicated and supportive immigrant parents, who were my motivation to seek out higher education and push myself to go above and beyond.\nIn middle school, I didn’t think that student groups or leadership positions were for me. But during my final months in eighth grade, I became aware of the lack of Black women representation in leadership roles on campus. I realized that there was no one who looked like me that I could reach out to if I needed help or support. I wanted to be that support for others.\nI also didn’t feel that Black voices were being heard or stated. While working remotely, I ensured that I was always attentive and that I included everyone’s thoughts and ideas in events and activities.\nI took the initiative to run for an officer position during my freshman year at Nathan Hale High School and became the treasurer of the class of 2024. Later, I was elected Black Student Union President and became the first Black/Eritrean president of the National Honor Society.\nOver the course of my high school career, I tried to ensure that students who looked like me had a voice and support and that I was never the only Black girl in a class or the first Black officer of a club. In junior year, I led a forum with Nathan Hale teachers and staff on how to support students of color. It was open to all students to ask questions and comment.\nI stayed involved and joined flag football, volleyball and basketball. I grew as a human and a scholar, with the support of Tiffany Robinson, my mentor and physics teacher, William Jackson, my principal, and my two loving and encouraging Eritrean parents, who never made me feel like my dreams were too big and who made me feel like I could overcome and accomplish anything I put my mind to.\nAt any minor inconvenience, my father would remind me, “Will it matter this much in five years?” If the answer is no, then I move on from the situation and look ahead. My mom taught me, “People come and go. But as long as you don’t lose yourself and settle, everything will work out.”\nWhen we were told in eighth grade that we would be out of school for two weeks, I did not think so much would change.\nI look back, and the COVID pandemic doesn’t seem so bad. It’s an event in history; it didn’t have as negative or life-altering effect on me and my family as other events during the same period, like the murder of George Floyd, the genocide of Tigray people in Ethiopia, and the seventh anniversary of the sinking of a ship carrying hundreds of migrants near the Italian island of Lampedusa.\nMy family escaped dictatorship and came to the United States as refugees. It reminded me that it could have been my family on that ship. I was nothing but grateful for the opportunity to have a better life.",
