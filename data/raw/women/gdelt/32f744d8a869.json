Magic are a pretty similar team to last year and they'll probably be the team to beat again, so for us it will be a good benchmark to see where we sit after some changes to the squad.\"\nMagic coach Jim Cresnar hoped to pick up where they left off this year with a strong showing in the Charity Shield before the season proper begins one week later.\n\"It's a game that's important to us to win,\" Cresnar said.\n\"It's a Charity Shield, but at the same time we want to make sure we're competitive and get an outcome.\n\"Over last season, I thought we definitely matured. We worked on a few areas that we needed to work on, which was creeping in during the first part of the season. We were clever enough to correct it in the second half of the season and I think we only lost one game during the second half of the season.\"\nMagic could lose this year's leading scorer Bailey Wells, who is trialling with A-League side Brisbane Roar this month.\nThe women's match will be a replay of this year's grand final, which Azzurri won 3-2.\nBoth teams are looking strong again in 2025.\nOlympic have been boosted by the return of experienced midfielder Laura Hall after having a baby and have also signed former A-League defender Alex Huynh plus fullback Maddy Howard from Maitland.\nThe women's NPL has been reduced to a seven-team competition next year after Mid Coast withdrew their senior teams while Lake Macquarie City have replaced Warners Bay.",
