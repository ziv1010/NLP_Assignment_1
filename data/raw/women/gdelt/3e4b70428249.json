  "body_text": "Chelsea’s last match of the season is an opportunity to completely sweep all the women’s competitions in the land. It would be a most excellent way to end manager Sonia Bompastor’s first season at the club, having kept the Blues unbeaten in domestic football for an entire year.\nChelsea FCW vs. Manchester United WFC, Women’s FA Cup Final: Preview, team news, how to watch\nThe chance for a domestic trophy sweep\nInvincibles we may be — and with a record points haul in the WSL — but at this point, bodies will be tired, and minds will follow. Motivation may be hard to come by, though we will surely want to avenge last year’s semifinal heartbreak against this very same Manchester United team, and beat them to the Women’s FA Cup trophy at Wembley.\nDate / Time: Sunday, May 17, 2025, 13.30 BST; 8:30am EDT\nVenue: Wembley, London\nReferee: Stacey Fullicks (on pitch); Peter Bankes (VAR)\nForecast: Sunny and warm with a slight chance of rain late on\nOn TV: BBC One (UK); none (USA); elsewhere\nStreaming: BBC iPlayer (UK); ESPN+ (USA); The FA Player (int’l)\nChelsea team news: The main concern is the fitness of center forward Mayra Ramírez, who was forced off in our last game against Manchester United a few weeks ago, which clinched our sixth straight league title. Thankfully, it looks like she will be able to play after sitting out our last two games.\nIn less ideal news, Lauren James remains out and Sam Kerr is still not quite ready to return, which means that she will have missed the entirety of the 2024-25 season. Hopefully we’ll see her next season as Treble winners.\nManchester United team news: The Red Devils were beaten 4-3 by Arsenal in their last WSL match of the season, with a late comeback from 4-1 down falling just short. The loss didn’t matter in the end, as they clinched third place in the league anyway, meaning that they will be in the Women’s Champions League for the second time in their history next season.\nTheir most notable absence is fullback Jayde Riviere, who is still recovering from an ankle injury. Meanwhile veteran striker Rachel Williams is a matchday decision due to fitness struggles.\nPreviously: Two years ago, Sam Kerr’s lone goal at the 68th minute was enough to give us our fifth FA Cup trophy. Who will win us our sixth?",
