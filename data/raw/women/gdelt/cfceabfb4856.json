But we also think we've got some existing settings that are really strong as well.\n\"So with Wembley hosting the final, and those other ones supporting us through the tournament, that'll be a great combination.\"\nRead more from Sky News:\nBudget 2025: The key points at a glance\nFormer Marine admits driving into fans at Liverpool FC parade\nBirmingham City's new 62,000-seat stadium could also be included in the bid, with plans unveiled last week for it to be built within five years.\nEngland is set to dominate the 2035 hosting, but the bid is jointly with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\nNorthern Ireland missed out on hosting matches in the men's Euro 28 that is being spread across England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales due to a lack of a suitable stadium.\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\nWhile England hosted the women's European Championship in 2003 and 2022, when the Lionesses won the trophy, the Women's World Cup has never been staged in the country.\nThe 2031 women's World Cup is set to be held in the United States.\nFIFA will publish evaluations of the bids in the first half of next year, before ratifying the 2031 and 2035 hosts - with the event expanding from 32 to 48 teams, mirroring the expansion of the men's World Cup.",
