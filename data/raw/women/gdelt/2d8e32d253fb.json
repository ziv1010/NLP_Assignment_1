The friends he made during his days in creche as a young child, still remained his close friends to this day.\nIt was during his time as a young child in creche that Mr Fitzpatrick first became friends with a young girl by the name of Ebony. “Unbeknownst to him, or at least I hope it was unbeknownst to him, Ebony was to become his one true love,” said Mr Fitzpatrick’s dad, Darran, during his son’s eulogy.\nAs Mr Fitzpatrick moved through life, joining various sporting clubs and enrolling in primary school, secondary school and college at South East Technological University (SETU), people couldn’t help but gravitate towards him as his circle of close friends expanded even further. These friends became like brothers to Mr Fitzpatrick.\nNot only was Mr Fitzpatrick a loyal friend, he was also a “truly great son and brother,” added Darran as he recalled how his son was lovingly nicknamed “blondie” when he was growing up because of his thick, blonde hair.\nOver the years, Mr Fitzpatrick became involved in hurling, soccer, football and rugby and when he was not on the sporting pitch, “he was hunting the land in all manner of means and also tearing up the land on his motorcross bike,\" said Darran with a laugh.\n\"Paul became an excellent manager of his time and he gave it generously to his friends, to his family and to all of his pastimes.”\nHowever, it was during one of Mr Fitzpatrick’s pastimes that he suddenly lost his life.\n\"Last Tuesday, December 2, true to form, Paul had a hectic schedule,” recalled Darran. “He had two exams to do with his brother, Billy, at SETU. He managed to get home and collect his younger brother, Niall, from school and dropped his mam’s glasses into Carlow to get repaired.\n\"Then himself and Billy started preparing for a presentation they had in college the next day. And of course, because he figured he had such little to do, there was plenty of time to go do a bit of fox hunting with his pals.\n\"It was during the pursuit of this passion of his that a very sad accident would lead to his untimely death.”\nDarran next addressed the emergency services who provided care that was “second to none” on that fateful night.\n\"I would like to sincerely thank the women and men of our emergency services,” said Darran. “The guards, the fire brigade, the ambulance services, the doctors and Fr Declan Foley and everybody who attended the scene of the accident in very difficult circumstances.\n\"The kindness and compassion and the professionalism of all of these people was second to none and it afforded Paul, and all of us who were there at the scene, the upmost care and dignity.”\nAs Darran reached the end of the eulogy, he spoke on behalf of his wife and sons when he said that Paul lived his life to the fullest, doing something he loved, “right up until his last second”.\n\"We are truly grateful to live in a community with so many good and kind people,” said Darran as he started to cry.\n“Rosemarie, Billy, Niall and myself will be forever grateful that Paul had the opportunity to live his life to the fullest, he got to love Ebony, share so much with his brothers, his family and his friends and that he was enjoying one of his favourite pastimes, in the company of one of his very best pals who is known in our house as number four, right up until his last second.”\nParish priest Fr Declan Foley added that despite our best efforts, sometimes tragic accidents can’t be avoided.\n\"What happened on Tuesday night was a tragic accident,” said Fr Declan Foley as he addressed the congregation.\n“In despite of our best efforts, accidents do happen and no matter how careful we are in our world, accidents do still happen.”\n“Paul will be eternally missed by his mam, Rosemarie; dad, Darran; brothers Billy and Niall and his forever loving girlfriend Ebony,” read his death notice on RIP.ie.\nHe will also be missed by his “grandparents, Carmel, Mary and Paddy, aunts and uncles, cousins and many, many friends and neighbours”.",
