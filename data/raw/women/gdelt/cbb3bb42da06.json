  "body_text": "How style guru Giorgio Armani revolutionised fashion\n- Published\nGiorgio Armani, who has died at the age of 91, was the first designer since Coco Chanel to bring about a lasting change in the way people dress.\nBorn in a pre-war era of rigid traditions and styles, his creations followed - and helped make possible - increasing social fluidity in the latter half of the 20th Century.\nChiefly, he will be remembered for reinventing the suit - feminising it for men and popularising it for women.\nArmani took away the restrictions and confinements of stiffer styles that went before him - making men feel sophisticated and women empowered in the workplace.\nNewspapers hailed him the \"first post-modern designer\". In many ways, he was a revolutionary.\nGiorgio Armani was born in Piacenza, northern Italy, on 11 July 1934.\nHis family's comfortable middle-class lifestyle was destroyed by the war and, with food hard to find, his earliest memory was hunger.\nArmani played with unexploded artillery shells in the street, until one suddenly went off. He was severely burned and a close friend was killed.\n\"War,\" he later said, \"taught me that not everything is glamorous.\"\nAs a young man, Armani drifted.\nIn 1956, he began a medicine degree - but dropped out after three years and joined the army.\nSwiftly tiring of life in the military, he found a job as a window dresser at La Rinascente - a department store in Milan - where he moved swiftly through the ranks.\nMost designers learn their trade as apprentices or at fashion school - but Armani's education took place on the shop floor.\nHe learned what fabrics the customers liked, and went to the textile mills to buy them. He became an expert in how the cloth was constructed, and used his knowledge to perfect the tailoring.\nSoon, Armani was working for Nino Cerruti - an influential haute couture designer. Within months, Cerruti asked him to restructure the company's approach.\nThe 1960s middle classes could not afford haute couture, but yearned for a stylish, distinctive look of their own.\nWith his expertise in fabrics, Armani provided an answer. His fine cloths made possible a menswear range with neat, precise cuts that could be manufactured at scale.\nIts distinctively Italian style began to influence the way the fashionable dressed.\nIn 1966, Armani met Sergio Galeotti, a young apprentice architect. Galeotti soon abandoned his own career and started to work at his lover's side.\nWith immense confidence in Giorgio's ability, he encouraged Armani to set up on his own.\nGaleotti masterminded the business side of the company - and sold his Volkswagen car to raise seed capital.\nThey started small - their first office was so dingy that Armani took the shades off the lamps in order to see the fabrics. But their work was nothing short of a revolution in fashion.\nIn broad terms, Armani softened menswear and hardened womenswear.\nMen's suits were made softer and more sensual.\nIt reflected a change in the way men saw themselves in the 1960s, but it had not yet been captured in fashion.\nAnd with more women entering the workplace, Armani spotted an opportunity.\n\"I realised that they needed a way to dress that was equivalent to that of men,\" he said. \"Something that would give them dignity in their work life.\"\nWith Armani's elegantly tailored power suits, women were offered an alternative to the stiff and stuffy dresses their mothers had worn to work. They exuded femininity, but were a powerful statement of equality.\nIn 1978, the company signed an agreement with clothes manufacturer GFT - which gave it the ability to produce luxury ready-to-wear clothes in volume.\nAt the same time, Armani pulled off a huge marketing coup.\nHe won a contract to dress Richard Gere in American Gigolo. In almost every scene of the 1980 film, Gere's handsome fantasy-figure form appears head-to-foot in Armani.\nIt was Armani's vision projected by the power of Hollywood - and publicity that money couldn't buy.\nHe went on to dress stars on the Oscar night red carpet, and design costumes for dozens of film and television shows: notably The Untouchables and 1980s crime series Miami Vice.\nWithin a decade, he had become the biggest selling European designer in the United States. As a result, Milan emerged as serious commercial and creative force in world fashion - second only to Paris.\nHe moved to extend his brand. He launched both Armani Jeans and Emporio Armani - and a deal with L'Oreal added fragrances to his arsenal.\nHe went on to introduce glasses, sportswear, cosmetics and accessories. Now, there was an entire lifestyle - under one label - to which the fashionable could aspire. GQ magazine described it as the \"total look\".\nIn 1985, Sergio Galeotti died of an Aids-related illness at the age of 40.\nAn intensely private man, Armani retreated into himself and considered retirement. Eventually, he decided to persevere rather than \"abandon all of Sergio's hopes\".\nPaying tribute to his long-term personal and business partner, Armani said that \"he helped me believe in my own work, in my energy\".\nIn a rare interview in 2001, Armani was asked about the greatest failure of his career. \"Not being able to stop my partner dying,\" he answered.\nWith no family to distract him, he dedicated his life to expanding his empire.\nWhile fashion conglomerates bought up other brands, Armani resisted external investment.\nInstead, he built the company into the vast global business it is today - and retained control of its finances and creativity. It made him a multi-billionaire.\nIn 2000, the Guggenheim Museum in New York hosted an exhibition of his work.\nIt recognised Armani's powerful influence on social change in the previous century - and boldly stated that \"design could be art\".\nHe stopped using models with low body mass indexes when one - Ana Carolina Reston - died of anorexia.\nHotel design was added to the portfolio with the opening of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai in 2010. Armani himself designed the interiors.\nA keen sports fan, he also designed suits for Chelsea and the England football squad - and made the uniforms for Italy's Olympic team in 2012.\nHe had a very public falling-out with US Vogue editor Anna Wintour when she failed to attend the launch of his new season in 2014.\nShe claimed a diary conflict, but was rumoured to have remarked that \"the Armani era is over\".\nAs he entered his tenth decade, Armani continued to present new ranges on the catwalks of Paris and Milan.\nIn March 2025, he said his Milan show aimed to pour oil on the troubled waters of global politics.\n\"I wanted to imagine new harmony,\" he said, \"because I believe that is what we all need.\"\nIn person, he was trim and business-like.\nNew York magazine described him as \"notoriously disciplined\" and \"dedicated to a self-control and self-containedness that can come off as coolness\".\nEach morning, Armani would do lengths in his swimming pool. It was 50 yards long but just one yard wide - and contained just enough water to facilitate the laps.\nTo some, the design of the pool encapsulated the designer's single-minded approach to life and business. It was minimalist, precise, and engineered for a purpose.\nThroughout his career, his styles remained in lockstep with changing society.\nThe acute sense of social direction came from Armani's early experience on the shop floor of that Milanese department store.\nThere, it was the customers who mattered - and a good designer ensured he adapted to their changing needs.\nFor 65 years, Armani dedicated himself to that task. And it amassed him a fortune estimated by Forbes at $13bn (£10bn).\n\"I'm never satisfied,\" he once told a reporter.\n\"In fact, as someone who is forever dissatisfied and obsessive in his search for perfection, I never give up until I've achieved the results I want.\"\nRelated topics\n- Published4 September 2025",
