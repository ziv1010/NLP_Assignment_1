Jónsdóttir also went close deep into stoppage time.\nIceland went down to 10 players in the 58th when midfielder Hildur Antonsdóttir was shown a second yellow card for a dangerous tackle.\nFinland’s 16-year wait\nBoth teams had failed to win a game at each of their previous two Euros tournaments.\n“The result is important for our confidence,” Kosola said after Finland ended a winless run that stretched to Euro 2009. “It was the kind of goal I have been practicing a lot. I had a couple of chances in the first half.”\nFinland’s win is a strong move in Group A, which has no clear standout team and is widely seen as the most finely balanced at the 16-nation tournament.\nNorway later joined Finland on three points, beating host Switzerland 2-1 in Basel after the official on-field opening ceremony for what was the second of 31 games in total. Basel hosts the final on July 27.\nIceland’s frustration\n“It’s terrible to lose and we feel frustrated,” Iceland coach Thorsteinn Halldórsson said in comments reported by UEFA. “It is an even group and we knew Finland were good, but our first half wasn’t good enough.”\nIceland also was hurt by having captain and star defender Glódís Viggósdóttir slowed by a stomach illness before being replaced at halftime, rather than a knee injury that forced her to missed playing time in Bayern Munich’s German league and cup-winning season.\n“I’ve had it for a few days. I tried to play with it but couldn’t,” Viggósdóttir said.\nSwiss heat wave\nEuro 2025 started with two Nordic teams playing in the heat wave that had Switzerland sweltering since before the squads arrived in the Alpine nation.\nIt had cooled to 81 degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius) for the 6 p.m. kickoff in Thun as electric storms threatened nearby. It was just 52 degrees (11 C) and cloudy in Iceland’s capital Reykjavik though 73 degrees (23 C) in Helsinki.\nFinland last won a game at the Women’s Euro in 2009, while Iceland had drawn 1-1 in each of its three group-stage games at Euro 2022 and lost all three at the 2017 edition.\nJónsdóttir’s fast-driving runs and long throw-ins were a regular threat, and two of Iceland’s most dangerous attacks were denied by Finland defender Emma Koivisto blocking the ball.\nFinland defender Natalia Kuikka, who plays for Chicago Stars, said the last 15 minutes had been “pretty chaotic. At the end, Iceland were just coming at us, so it honestly didn’t feel like they were missing a player.”\nThe Associated Press contributed to this post\nMore sports, gear and tickets\n- Where to stream Rising Stars Challenge and HBCU Classic live today\n- Where to watch NBA Celebrity All-Star Game today free\n- How to buy tickets to NBA All-Star Weekend: Celebrity Game, Rising Stars Challenge, All-Star Saturday Night, NBA ASG\n- Where to watch USA women’s hockey game today free\n- 2026 Olympics: How to stream Canada men’s hockey game today live",
