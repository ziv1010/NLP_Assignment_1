While The Prince of Wales, 43, has plenty of royal responsibilities, he has made it clear his children are always among his top priorities, something he has shown through his actions.\nFrom doing the school run to watching sports games, the first-in-line to the throne is a very hands-on parent, as is his wife Princess Kate. Like most parents, this means William sees the highs and lows of parenting on a daily basis, which can be tiring. Although William tends to not disclose too much about his private life, in his upcoming TV appearance, the future King makes a very relatable admission about what being a dad to three children aged 12, 10 and seven, is really like.\nSurprising gift Prince Harry gave King Charles during 'formal' reunion\nPrince Harry and King Charles made a big step towards healing their royal rift earlier this month after a meeting at Clarence House.\nThe Duke of Sussex, who quit royal life in 2020, was invited to his father’s home for a private tea just weeks ago during his four-day UK trip.

Various reports have cited sources claiming there is a wedge between the Prince of Wales and the monarch, shortly after the King's meeting with Prince Harry during his four-day visit to the UK.\nMeanwhile, renowned royal biographer Tina Brown said that the King is \"less irritated\" by Harry than William, as the heir's \"parenting dedication\" seems like a \"tacit criticism of the King’s own paternal deficiencies\". However, royal sources close to both the King and William have dismissed those claims and said their relationship is stronger than ever.\nPrince William says 'life is sent to test us' in frank admission to Hollywood star\nPrince William has said \"life is sent to test us\" as he opened up to the Hollywood actor, Eugene Levy, on his travel show, The Relucant Traveler in an episode that comes out on October 3 on Apple TV+.

Speaking on Fox News on Thursday, royal commentator Hilary Fordwich claimed the Duke of Sussex had inflicted \"irreparable wounds\" on the monarchy.\nShe further criticised his sharing of schedules with Buckingham Palace as a \"transparent PR manoeuvre\" laced with ulterior motives. Palace insiders have rejected Harry's rumoured push for a partial royal return as a \"tone-deaf delusion.” Ms Fordwich said that his \"victim narrative\" remains a \"toxic liability\" that could further embroil the royals in scandal. The Palace, she added, would be \"foolish\" to consider any reconciliation with the Duke of Sussex.\nExciting outing announced for Princess Kate - and it's just days away\nPrincess Kate will step out for a special visit to Royal Air Force Coningsby next Thursday (October 2).
