Now 21, Rosa made a total of 46 appearances for AIK Football, scoring 19 goals.\nRosa made the switch from AIK Football to BK Häcken in January 2022 and would go on to make 61 appearances and score 28 goals during her time at the club. She was Häcken’s top scorer in the 2023/24 season, scoring 15 goals including four in a thrilling UEFA Women’s Champions League run, which saw Häcken beat Real Madrid twice on the way to the quarter-final stage.\nAt international level, Rosa worked her way up the age groups before making her senior debut from the bench against Italy in the UEFA Women’s Nations League in October 2023. She has already made nine appearances and scored one goal for her country.\n“It feels amazing to join this club – I'm so happy to be here,” said Rosa. “I had a very good feeling after speaking to Jonas and Clare and it just feels right to be at Arsenal. I’m hungry to keep growing and I know this is the right place for me to do that and compete for the biggest trophies. I can't wait to get started and walk out at Emirates Stadium in front of all our supporters.”\nDirector of Women’s Football Clare Wheatley added: “Rosa is one of the outstanding young players in the game and we’re so happy to have brought her to Arsenal. She has already gained great experience, and has the ambition and desire to continue to develop and grow in our environment. I’m sure our supporters will join me in welcoming Rosa to the club. We look forward to watching her in red and white very soon.”\nHead Coach Jonas Eidevall said: “I’m delighted we’ve been able to bring Rosa to the club. She’s one of the most exciting young talents in the world and I’ve been a keen admirer of her game for a number of years. She plays with a fearlessness beyond her age and I know she has the hunger and mentality it takes to realise her potential here with Arsenal.”\nThe deal is subject to the completion of regulatory processes.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
