  "body_text": "—Three U of L head coaches — Rodrigo Da Silva (men’s tennis), Whitney Young (women’s golf) and Karen Ferguson-Dayes (women’s soccer) — received contract extensions on Wednesday.\nThursday afternoon Cardinal news and notes\nMy guy Beau is ready for a Cardinal soccer double header tonight.\n—The big rumor in the world of Cardinal athletics for the past 24 hours plus has been that former wide receiver Ahmari Huggins-Bruce could be leaving South Carolina to return to play for the Cards. AHB has missed USC’s last three practices, and coaches are refusing to comment on his status.\n—Eric Crawford writes that the Huggins-Bruce rumors are the latest piece of evidence that Louisville’s offensive concerns might be legitimate.\nWhether it will come to fruition, who knows? What it says about Louisville football and Jeff Brohm’s estimation of his offense, however, is of more interest than whether a receiver who had 20 catches (four for touchdowns) a year ago decides he wants to spend another year in Louisville after not wanting to spend another year here. He had one catch for seven yards in Louisville’s Holiday Bowl loss to USC and entered the transfer portal a day later.\nLouisville suffered an offensive blow last weekend when Caullin Lacy, the top transfer wideout in the country, injured his collarbone and will be sidelined for at least six weeks. Brohm himself has expressed some dissatisfaction with his offense, saying he needs more playmakers to develop.\n“For some reason, we’re not throwing the ball well and making plays,” Brohm said after a scrimmage last Saturday. “The running game has to pick us up. For some reason, they’re stoning us and they’re loading the box. So we’ve got to be good enough to pass the ball. That’s not all on the players. It’s coaching, too. You have to have a plan for looks you get that give your players an opportunity to do the best against the look and not just call plays to call plays. There has to be a rhyme and a reason. It has to be the ability to get from one to the other quickly so that you put yourself in a better chance to make plays. I think it was total blame by myself, all the way down where things need to be planned more strategically to give our players a chance.”\nI hear talk like that and generally take it with a considerable grain of salt. Some coaches use that kind of talk as motivation. You could always hear that kind of thing and hold out hope that the defense is being the kind of dominant unit that Brohm wants.\nBut if Louisville is, indeed, considering taking Huggins-Bruce back into the fold, it’s an indicator that Brohm means exactly what he’s been saying where his offense is concerned.\n—The Louisville men’s soccer team will host Jacksonville tonight at 7:30 in their 2024 season opener. Here’s a preview.\n—The Louisville women’s basketball team will open ACC play on Dec. 15 with a showdown against NC State in the Jimmy V Women’s Classic on ABC.\n—She’s a beaut.\n—Eleven members of the Louisville football team have been named to the 2025 Senior Bowl Watch List: Quarterback Tyler Shough, wide receivers Ja’Corey Brooks, Caullin Lacy, tight end Mark Redman, offensive lineman Jonathan Mendoza, defensive linemen Ashton Gillotte, Thor Griffith and defensive backs Tamarion McDonald, Tahveon Nicholson, Quincy Riley and Corey Thornton.\nLast season, running back Jawhar Jordan, wide receiver Jamari Thrash and cornerback Jarvis Brownlee were all Senior Bowl selections. Each player went on to be selected in the 2024 National Football League Draft.\n—Anonymous college basketball coaches confirm what we already knew: Louisville basketball is in a good position with NIL.\nOne other interesting thing about the results of our poll is that the programs coaches largely believe are swinging the biggest NIL sticks are either blue bloods and/or schools employing new coaches. Our top-five vote getters — Arkansas, Kansas, BYU, Kentucky and Indiana — all check at least one of those boxes. Kentucky checks both. And only six programs appeared on more ballots than Louisville, another traditional power with a new coach that is desperate to return to relevance ASAP.\n“They’re handing out f-cking money like it’s Monopoly,” one coach said.\nAs someone who watched the Louisville program crater over the past two years, I, for one, say good for them. Louisville should be handing out money like it’s Monopoly. It’s an ACC program with a large and proud fanbase that’s been through a lot over the years — everything from the end of the Rick Pitino era to the surprisingly disappointing Chris Mack era to the disastrous couple of years Kenny Payne was in charge.\nSimply put, college basketball is better when Louisville is good.\nI sincerely believe that.\nSo spend away, Cardinals!\n“Louisville Basketball: Handing Out Fucking Money Like It’s Monopoly” should be the new “L1C4.”\n—Athlon ranks the ACC as the fourth-best conference in college football for the upcoming season.\n—Andy Staples of On3 takes his first crack at projecting the 12-team College Football Playoff.\n—Straight to The Gulag.\n—The U of L women’s soccer team will look to move to 3-0 with a home win over New Hampshire Thursday night. Here’s a preview.\n—The Jeff Brohm Radio Show will debut a week from last night.\n—Iowa head coach Kirk Ferentz has been suspended one game for recruiting violations.\n—105 is a hell of a run.

They have the Cards in the “likely bowl team” tier, just below the “playoff contenders” tier.\nAnalysis\nJeff Brohm’s surprising run to the ACC title game in Year 1 can be repeated if the Cardinals get a full season of health from quarterback Tyler Shough and they maintain their standing as one of the best defenses in the league against the run and on third downs.\nLouisville lost some key personnel from an offense that ranked fifth in the league in both yards per play (6.2) and points per game (30.7). Brohm is counting on transfer portal success again to plug those holes with Shough (Texas Tech), running back Donald Chaney Jr. (Miami) and receiver Ja’Corey Brooks (Alabama) playing primary roles. South Alabama transfer Caullin Lacy (91 receptions in 2023) injured his collarbone in camp and could miss as many as six games.\nDefensively, there isn’t a team in the league with as many combined college starts on the line and in the secondary. All-ACC edge rusher Ashton Gillotte, cornerback Quincy Riley and safety Devin Neal are the primary holdovers, but there are a number of transfers expected to contribute.\nPostseason chances\nEven though the Cardinals weren’t among the four ACC teams ranked in the preseason AP Top 25, they’re a contender for the league crown. After finishing 15th in the final college CFP rankings last year, Brohm has a team capable of 10 wins again. Yes, there’s a trip to Notre Dame on Sept. 28, and another to Clemson in early November, but the rest of the stiffest ACC challenges (Miami, SMU, Georgia Tech) are at home.\nWhat would be a successful season?\nThe over/under for wins is eight, so getting back to the ACC Championship Game and contending for a Playoff spot would mean exceeding expectations. Brohm has proven to be one of the best play callers in the league, and he’s determined to rebuild his rosters via the portal. A step back in the win column might lead to some changes in philosophy. — Navarro\n—I will love Joey Votto forever. Happy retirement.

He has battled shoulder and collarbone injuries throughout his career, making just 11 starts in three years for the Red Raiders. Shough’s inconsistency displays itself on the field, as well.
