  "body_text": "After an incredible World Cup journey, our Lionesses were defeated 1-0 by Spain in the final on Sunday.\nSarina Wiegman's side battled until the very end, but they were unable to find a way behind the resilient Spain defence.\nHaving scored three goals in the tournament already, Alessia Russo was named in the starting XI while Lotte Wubben-Moy was on the bench.\nThe game's first big chance fell to Lauren Hemp who rattled the crossbar with a curling effort, but it was Spain who eventually opened the scoring, as Olga Carmona attacked down the left wing and fired beyond the reach of Mary Earps into the bottom corner.\nTrailing at the break, Sarina Wiegman made a big call to replace both Russo and Rachel Daly with Chloe Kelly and Lauren James.\nSpain had a chance to double their lead when Keira Walsh was penalised for handball inside the area, but Mary Earps stepped up to produce an incredible save to deny Jenni Hermoso.\nEngland continued to push forward in search of an equaliser, troubling Spain with a number of dangerous counter-attacks, but they were unable to carve out one last opportunity to take the game to extra time.\nEveryone at Arsenal is incredibly proud of the way you've represented your country this tournament, Lotte and Alessia.\nIf you want to watch our World Cup stars when they return to north London, you can now purchase tickets for our WSL opener against Liverpool at Emirates Stadium.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
