  "body_text": "Lionesess legend Fara Williams says the unique challenges of England’s Milton Keynes Arnold Clark Cup test will provide the perfect preparation for this year’s World Cup.\nSarina Wiegman's European champions kick off their title defence against Korea Republic at Stadium MK on Thursday before facing Italy and Belgium later in the week, with over 70,000 tickets sold.\nAnd Williams, who played in three World Cups and four European Championships for England, believes the unknown threat of the Koreans can help lay the foundations for an assault on global glory in Australia this summer.\nThe 39-year-old said: \"The Lionesses are going to be even greater this year.\n\"Last year, the Arnold Clark Cup was the tournament that really sent the Lionesses on their way to success and gave them that confidence going into the Euros.\n🚨GET YOUR TICKETS🚨\n— Arnold Clark Cup (@ArnoldClarkCup) November 8, 2022\nArnold Clark Cup tickets are now on sale! Make sure you get your tickets now, you won’t want to miss out!\nHead over to https://t.co/SolUPhUQ1j and we will see you in February 👋🏽 pic.twitter.com/xzP6t8Q3u8\n\"This time it's a different test, with three different types of opposition preparing them for the World Cup in Australia.\n\"The likes of Korea Republic, a team from the Asian continent that we don't really play that much, will be the one I'm looking forward to the most.\n\"With Alessia Russo and Ella Toone now having to make their impact at the start, this tournament might be a chance for Sarina to look at new impact players that will make those differences for us.\n\"When I've played against Korea in the past, they're a team that like to dominate possession and very technical on the ball.\n\"That is something that the Lionesses might not be as used to so it will be a new test.\"\nWhilst Korea will provide a relatively new and distinct style of play, with a range of talent unfaced at club level, Italy will be ready to reverse their fortunes following a disappointing Euro 2022 performance last summer.\nItaly failed to make it past the group stages with just one point and one goal and will walk out in Coventry on Sunday with a new hunger to prove their strengths.\n\"I think for Italy, this is a chance for them to re-evaluate where they are,\" said Williams.\n\"At the Euros, I think they would have felt like they left themselves down so coming back they will want to showcase their star players and let people know that they are better than what the showcased.\n\"Belgium probably did better than expected in the Euros but they are a team that are becoming our bogey team.\n\"So this is a tournament I think we should win, but it will be a good test going into a World Cup where our opponents will be so varied.\"\n🇰🇷 🇮🇹 🇧🇪\n— Lionesses (@Lionesses) February 16, 2023\nSarina gives her thoughts on our upcoming @ArnoldClarkCup opponents: pic.twitter.com/QdM2sVm5QJ\nThe Arnold Clark Cup is providing a thrilling double-header treat for fans this year, with ticket holders privy to not one but two world-class games of football on match day.\nAnd with the final few tickets on sale for Milton Keynes and Coventry, there's still time to catch the European champions continue their roaring period of success.\nWilliams said: \"Hopefully we get the support for the Lionesses but also for the other teams that are coming over.\n\"We want to support the women's game as a whole.\n\"I think a day out at women's game is such a different atmosphere.\n\"The entertainment they put on, if you want to take your family or friends who are interested in football, there's loads going on.\n\"The quality and calibre of players on the pitch is another dimension now so for any football fan this is a great opportunity to see some high-quality football.\"\nRoar on the Lionesses in the Arnold Clark Cup, 16-22 February 2023.
