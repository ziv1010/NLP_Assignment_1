Check in with ESPN throughout the tournament as we bring you the latest from Australia and New Zealand.\nThe lead: One game left with the winner to be crowned\nSpain vs. England, Stadium Australia, Sydney; Sunday, Aug. 20: 8 p.m. local, 6 a.m. ET, 11 a.m. BST\nOdds via Caesars Sportsbook: Spain +160, Draw +200, England +190\nSYDNEY -- England have a fully fit squad as they look to complete a remarkable double. Last summer they broke the nation's long wait for a major trophy when they won Euro 2022, but now they're looking to add the World Cup title. Coach Sarina Wiegman switched formation midtournament to 3-5-2, and they'll look to that system to see off Spain. Star forward Lauren James is back in the mix after returning from suspension, but Wiegman faces a selection dilemma over keeping faith with Ella Toone in the No. 10 role or bringing back James.\nLeah Williamson, England's injured captain from the Euros, will be in the stands supporting the Lionesses, and retired legends Jill Scott and Ellen White will also be in Stadium Australia, but this is a new-look England team from the one that won the Euros. England are fully aware of Spain's threat and have the local knowledge of Barcelona's Keira Walsh and Lucy Bronze as the Lionesses look to make it two major trophies in 13 months. -- Tom Hamilton\nSpain coach Jorge Vilda also has some big decisions to make. Vilda has not named the same side twice at the tournament so far, but he might be tempted to stick with the XI that beat Sweden. However, that would mean leaving out Salma Paralluelo once again. The Barcelona teenager started the first four matches at the finals but has starred off the bench in the past two games. She netted the winner against Netherlands in extra time and scored the opener against Sweden. There is no doubt she deserves to start, but will Vilda want to lose her impact off the bench?\nThe other dilemma centres around Alexia Putellas. The back-to-back Ballon d'Or winner returned to the team against Sweden only to be taken off after an hour. She has not completed 90 minutes since recovering from an ACL injury. Forward Jenni Hermoso could drop into a deeper midfield role, allowing Paralluelo or Esther González to come in if Vilda decides Putellas is not ready. There are also decisions to make at the back, with full-back Oihane Hernández returning from suspension and captain Ivana Andrés fit again. They are all welcome problems for Vilda, though, and demonstrate the depth La Roja have.\nGiven their star names and success at youth level in recent years, perhaps the biggest surprise is that Spain had never won a knockout game at a major tournament before this World Cup. They feel their time is now and are seeking revenge for last year's quarterfinal elimination to England at the Euros. -- Sam Marsden\nPlayer to watch\nEngland: Alex Greenwood\nThe jewel in England's defensive crown, Alex Greenwood has been England's standout player so far this tournament and if they are to create history against Spain, the 29-year-old is likely to play a starring role at the back.\nNot just able to wrest the ball from the opposition in the box, the defender remains one of England's best passers of the ball, able to progress it from deeper positions to set the lionesses on their way. -- Sophie Lawson\nSpain: Salma Paralluelo\nThe Barcelona winger has been the game-changer for Spain in each of their last two games by scoring crucial goals after coming off the substitutes' bench against both Netherlands and Sweden. Just 19, Paralluelo possesses undoubted game intelligence, pace and a clinical eye in front of goal. A former 400m runner, she chose football over athletics just last year and her ability marks her out to be one the biggest stars, if not the biggest, in the women's games for the next decade. -- Mark Ogden\nFinal predictions\nSpain 2-1 England. It will be a real clash of styles in the final. European champions England are tough, organised and predictable under Wiegman, and they know how to win. But Spain are the team with the flair and individual brilliance of Paralluelo and Putellas, who is still searching for top form after a long-term cruciate ligament injury. England have the winning pedigree, but Spain are the developing team, and if Paralluelo shines, La Roja will win. -- Ogden\nEngland 2-0 Spain. An all-European World Cup final in Sydney to determine the champions of the world. The technical brilliance of Spain against the resourcefulness and adaptability of England. Looking at the way the two teams have played in this tournament, something has got to give with both being ball-dominant sides. I can't see Spain giving up possession and playing on the counter. Wiegman, though, is one of the best managers in the world, and I fully believe she'll have a plan ready that can come through. -- Lynch\nSpain 2-1 England. The team I've picked to win has lost ever since the knockout rounds started: the United States, Sweden, now Australia. Based on that alone, it seems Spain will win. The players are incredible to watch, but knowing about the issues the players have had with manager Vilda and the lack of support from their federation makes it hard to fully back them. That said, the Spanish team's ability to dictate play and score at will is undeniable. La Roja have two of the very best players in the world in Aitana Bonmatí and Putellas, and they play like it. I think it'll come down to execution, and the Spanish players are just better. -- Caitlin Murray\nEngland 2-1 Spain. England have the difference-maker in this final: Wiegman. She knows what it takes to win these tournaments and is the best coach in the world. England will look to take the tempo out of the Spain passing system and control the balance of the match, with Alessia Russo and Lauren Hemp the threats up front. -- Hamilton\nEngland 2-1 Spain. It will be close, just as almost all the knockout games have been this tournament, but England will edge it. The Lionesses have found some much-needed momentum (and goals) over the past few games, growing into the World Cup, and have shown incredible calm throughout. Experience will be a factor on Sunday, and, against a Spain side who don't always make the best decisions, England will find their way through. -- Lawson\nEngland 2-1 Spain. England will make it a Euros-World Cup double on Sunday. Wiegman's tactical genius has so far gotten England through every obstacle at this tournament and they have found a way to win even when they haven't looked convincing. Throw in the fact that the Lionesses appear to be getting into a groove at exactly the right time, and their finals experience, and England look the goods. That being said, Spain will be no easy beats and goals should come from both sides. La Roja's best is exceptionally good, but England will find a way to crush Spanish dreams. -- Marissa Lordanic\nSights and sounds\nSweden take bronze, too strong for Australia\nBRISBANE, Australia -- Of course, Australia's last game at their home World Cup had to be against Sweden, marking the fifth meeting of the two since a Swede, Tony Gustavsson, took charge of the Matildas at the end of 2020. Sweden's 1-0 win in the semifinals of the Tokyo Olympics ended Australia's hopes of gold. And now on home soil in a bronze medal match, having already sealed their best-ever finish at a World Cup, Australia would fall short again.\nIn Brisbane, it was Sweden who looked fresher, with the cumulative minutes played by the Matildas' starting XI clearly taking its toll; every move, pass and tackle carried the weight of tired minds, heavy legs and scant recovery time.\nThe match seemed to be decided in the first half when, after a VAR review, Sweden were awarded a penalty for an innocuous trip in the box; Fridolina Rolfö's clinical finish into the bottom right corner was too good for Mackenzie Arnold to keep out.\nSweden's long history in the women's game casts a shadow over Australia's achievements; there was a familiarity with semifinals and medal matches that comes as a pedigree. The 90 minutes in Brisbane wasn't about know-how, it was simply about how the tournament had gone for the co-hosts. It was about the miles run by those in teal, of mental exhaustion leading to mistakes and broken attacks. Sweden had impressed in their round-of-16 win over United States and then knocked Japan out before falling to Spain in the semis. It wasn't the best football of coach Peter Gerhardsson's era, but it was consistently better than what their opposition could manage.\nThe exhaustion was on show again after the break when Stina Blackstenius teed up Kosovare Asllani, the two taking advantage of the gaps at the back, with Asllani delivering an inch-perfect finish to best Arnold again.\nAfter a fourth-place finish at the Olympics two summers ago, in Gustavsson's first tournament in charge of the Matildas, it would be fourth again in their own World Cup, leaving an immediate bitter taste of wasted potential. It could have been Australia's green and gold going for gold in Sydney, or at least finishing the World Cup with a flourish and shiny bronze medal.\nInstead, it was a tournament that ended with a loss. Sweden, the team actually in gold in Brisbane, were better on the night. Gerhardsson would be the victorious Swede in the dugout. -- Lawson\nEarps shirt still not on the shop shelves\nLionesses goalkeeper Mary Earps voiced her disappointment over a month ago that official kit supplier Nike hasn't made her shirt available to buy, yet the jersey is still not on sale to the public.\nNike have yet to comment on the reasons why they don't sell women's goalkeeper shirts, but English Football Association chief executive Mark Bullingham has said that the issue will be addressed \"soon.\"\n\"It's not something we're going to get into now,\" Bullingham said. \"But it will be something that is addressed quite soon after the tournament.\n\"Mary spoke passionately about it and we want to grow goalkeeping -- it's about building role models. It's something we're getting to, but it's not anything we're going to announce on now.\"\nTV ratings a winner despite Matildas' heartbreaking loss\nMELBOURNE, Australia -- The Matildas' efforts to secure a fairy-tale World Cup win on home soil came to a heartbreaking end on Wednesday evening, but Australia continued to smash records in support of them nonetheless. Yet again, television rating records were smashed as the nation rallied around its women in green and gold: free-to-air broadcaster the Seven Network has declared that its broadcast of the Matildas' 3-1 loss to the Lionesses was the most-watched television program in Australia since 2001, when the current rating system was established.\nPer the broadcaster, the semifinal clash reached 11.15 million Australians at some point during its broadcast (approx. 41% of the total population), with an average audience of 7.13m (approx 26.7%).\nThe Matildas have already smashed the previous benchmarks in Australian ratings history, such as Ash Barty's win at the 2022 Australian Open, Lleyton Hewitt's loss at that same event in 2005, and England's win over the Wallabies in the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Given that the Seven Network figures don't include those watching the contest on Optus Sport -- who on-sold the rights to select games, including Matildas' matches, to the free-to-air network -- or those watching at pubs, clubs and the dozens of live sites across the country, the number of viewers for the game could even surpass the record set when more than 8 million Australians watched as Cathy Freeman won gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics under the previous rating scheme.\nGiven that several members of the squad, including Sam Kerr, cite Freeman as their childhood inspiration, the Matildas breaking that mark would represent a piece of romantic serendipity. -- Lynch\nEarly USWNT exit a motivating force?\nSYDNEY -- Former two-time Women's World Cup-winning coach Jill Ellis said the failure of the United States women's national team at this year's tournament should galvanize leaders to make changes and be a turning point in the sport in the country.\n\"Do I see it as a step back? No, I see it as a motivating force,\" Ellis told reporters at the FIFA Women's Football Convention on Friday. \"People need to come to the table. We can spur more collaboration. Maybe this is a moment and reflection point for us to get together and for stakeholders to work out a bigger plan.\"\nSuch discussions should include changes at the U.S. youth development level, she added.\n\"At the end of the day, you want the best players to train with the best players,\" Ellis said. \"I mean, the ECNL had a 6-0 semifinal. There's so much disparity in that league, and it's the best.\"\nThe Elite Clubs National League, or ECNL, is the premier youth developmental league in the United States for girls.\n\"The beauty of the smaller countries is they get the best to train with each other, so how do we look at that environment?\" Ellis added. \"How do we get the best coaches in the youth environment? The training environment matters.\" -- Murray\nNews of the day\n- The USWNT shakeup continues with general manager Kate Markgraf set to leave her role at the end of the month, sources confirmed to ESPN. Her decision to not return was made prior to the World Cup, and she will follow manager Vlatko Andonovski in leaving. Markgraf was hired as general manager in 2019, and her first decision was to hire Andonovski. After a subpar performance in the Olympics (bronze medal) and the 2023 World Cup (round-of-16 elimination), the USWNT will look for candidates who can get the team back on a path of success.\n- Continuing in USWNT news, former two-time Women's World Cup-winning coach Jill Ellis said the failure of the national team in this year's tournament should be a turning point. \"Do I see it as a step back? No, I see it as a motivating force,\" Ellis told reporters at the FIFA Women's Football Convention on Friday. \"People need to come to the table. We can spur more collaboration. Maybe this is a moment and reflection point for us to get together and for stakeholders to work out a bigger plan.\"\nShe also stated that changes need to take place on a youth level, specifically creating programs that allow younger players to train with more senior players. \"There's a lot of talent, but I think there are opportunities to grow in certain areas and pull certain levers to accelerate,\" Ellis said.\n- Former Ballon d'Or winner Ada Hegerberg led the backlash against Gianni Infantino on Friday after the FIFA president said women need to \"pick the right battles\" and \"convince men\" to enforce change. The Norway and Lyon striker responded to Infantino on X (formerly Twitter) after his speech, which came ahead of Sunday's Women's World Cup final between England and Spain in Sydney. She wrote ironically: \"Working on a little presentation to convince men. Who's in?\" Infantino had earlier hit back at critics at the FIFA Women's Football Convention, saying that expanding the tournament to 32 teams has turned out to be a success and that \"FIFA was right\" to do so.\n- England's determination to host the FIFA Women's World Cup could be on hold until 2035 at the earliest due to the English FA opting against an attempt to bid to stage the 2027 competition. UK government Sports Minister Stuart Andrew said last month \"it is a matter of when not whether\" the country would submit a bid to host the competition, but the situation facing England is more complex than simply entering the bidding race. The FA has already accepted that a joint bid involving Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands will be Europe's sole submission for 2027, with South Africa, Brazil and a U.S.-Mexico effort also aiming for the hosting rights. A decision on the hosts will be made in May 2024.\nA successful Germany-Belgium-Netherlands bid would rule out a European host nation in 2031, so the English FA, although keen to capitalise on the accelerated growth of women's football and last year's successful staging of Euro 2022, are now prepared to play the long game to win hosting rights in the future.\n\"In terms of bidding, we're obviously conscious we've had a lot of tournaments,\" English FA CEO Mark Bullingham said. \"We've put a bid in for Euro 2028, and that's obviously a big commitment. We would love to host the Women's World Cup one day, don't get any doubt on that, but if you look at the landscape, you've got Germany, Belgium and Netherlands bidding for 2027, so potentially be the one after that [2035].\"\nEngland hasn't hosted a men's World Cup since 1966, and a proposed joint UK bid for 2030 has been dropped. There are no existing plans to bid for a subsequent Men's World Cup, but the women's event is a more likely target. \"There are 211 countries in FIFA, and the fact is we've had the women's Euros so recently, we've had the men's Euros final, we're hopefully going to secure the men's Euros for 2028; that's actually a lot of Euros in our country at one time, clearly the next step would be to get a World Cup, men's or women's,\" Bullingham added. \"And I think a Women's World Cup could be brilliant for us and brilliant for the game.\" -- Ogden\n- Seeking to attach itself to the momentum that has seen the Matildas break attendance and rating records across Australia, the A-League Women (ALW) competition will launch before its men's counterpart for the first time in 2023-24, attempting to break domestic attendance records in a stand-alone opening round this October. The coming season will mark the first time the ALW features 12 teams and a full home-and-away season -- the only major footballing code in Australia to do so -- and commissioner Nick Garcia said the league wants to see \"more fans in bigger venues cheering on our stars\" across its first week. The ALW has consistently battled for mainstream recognition in Australia, magnified in recent years as members of the Matildas squad struck out to play in European leagues -- Lynch\nFeatures of the day\nHow Wiegman has England on brink of Women's World Cup glory\nOn Sunday, England boss Sarina Wiegman will be contesting her fourth major final in a row. Her incredible skills could help end the country's 57-year wait for a World Cup.\nMeet the man in charge of every 2023 Women's World Cup pitch\nArguably the most important, yet ignored, figure at the World Cup is the man responsible for every single pitch used in Australia and New Zealand.\n'Mystic Meerkats' predict England Women's World Cup final run\nEngland's run through the Women's World Cup knockout phase to the final has been predicted, game by game, by meerkats at Drusillas Park.\nFive things the USWNT must do before the 2024 Olympics\nAfter a disastrous Women's World Cup, the USWNT needs serious reform with destination Paris less than a year away.\nAnd finally ...\nSYDNEY -- Alex Chidiac's hopes of reaching the final were dashed when she and her Australia teammates suffered a 3-1 defeat to England in their semifinal, but there's still one major prize she's after: teatime with Women's World Cup mascot Tazuni.\nA longtime appreciator of the mascot arts, Chidiac has taken a particular affinity to Tazuni -- a Eudyptula penguin native to Australia and New Zealand. Ever since Tazuni's reveal ahead of the tournament, Chidiac has gone as far as to don a penguin outfit when she and other Matildas met the mascot last November.\nThe talented midfielder has owned an Emperor penguin plush since her childhood, a toy that follows her on her travels around the world as an emotional stand-in for her mother, who also owns a small penguin plush representing Chidiac. With the tournament almost over, Chidiac is becoming slightly concerned that Tazuni hasn't been returning her calls.\n\"Is there anything we get, like a Tazuni plush toy?\" Chidiac asked. \"[Tazuni] leaves after the game. The live one leaves after the game, and I'd like to celebrate with her. Just to hang out. I've been wanting to get a cup of tea with her since I met her; she's been ghosting me.\"\nMore seriously, Chidiac's continued dearth of minutes this World Cup has become a significant point of consternation in the Australian fanbase.\nOne of the Matildas' most technically proficient players, one who is willing to embrace risk and possesses the talent to slice open a defence, the 24-year-old has featured just twice this tournament off the bench and, on both occasions, was thrown on with her side down 3-1 and the game largely settled.\n\"It's always up to the coach at the end of the day,\" Chidiac told reporters when asked what she felt she needed to do to play. \"So it's tough for me to say what else I need to do -- it's not up to me. I'm just trying to do my best every session and put myself forward in any way possible.\" -- Lynch",
