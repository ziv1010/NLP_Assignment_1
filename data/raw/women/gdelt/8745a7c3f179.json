  "body_text": "Friday’s briefing: Four points, Three Lions and two FA Cup ties\nArsenal’s lead at the top of the Premier League is four points after they were held to a 1-1 draw at Brentford.\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel signed a contract extension ahead of the Nations League draw, which put his side up against Spain, Croatia and the Czech Republic.\nManchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe apologised if he had “offended some people” after saying the United Kingdom has been “colonised by immigrants”.\nBees fight back to sting Gunners title push\nArsenal’s lead over Manchester City at the top of the Premier League stands at just four points after Mikel Arteta’s title-chasing side were held to a 1-1 draw at Brentford.\nNoni Madueke headed Arsenal in front on the hour, but the hosts were back on terms only 10 minutes later when Keane Lewis-Potter struck following Michael Kayode’s long throw.\nFollowing their equaliser, Brentford looked the more likely to score – with Igor Thiago wasting a golden chance in stoppage time.\nHowever, substitute Gabriel Martinelli might have then won it for Arsenal only to be denied by Caoimhin Kelleher in a frantic end to the match.\nArsenal – runners-up for the past three seasons – will still have to visit the Etihad Stadium in April as they look to end their 22-year wait for the title.\nAsked if he is concerned the title momentum is shifting towards City, Arteta said: “I understand (the question) – but that’s an ‘if, if, if’ – and if we would have lost to Newcastle, we were eight points behind Liverpool in October.\n“There are a lot of ifs for 10 months in this competition, and you can only focus on what you have to do and try to do that in the best possible way.”\nThomas Tuchel commits to England stay\nThomas Tuchel has signed an extension to his contract as England head coach through to the end of the home European Championship in 2028.\nThe Football Association announced on Thursday morning the German was set to stay on, with his previous deal only running until the end of this summer’s World Cup in North America.\n“I was always committed to this idea of extending the contract, the FA were always committed – there were no games, no second thoughts. The process was very straightforward,” said Tuchel, who had been linked with the Manchester United job.\n“There is a possibility that I will be tempted to go back to club football, but not in the next two-and-a-half years.”\n🇪🇸 🇭🇷 🏴 🇨🇿\nOur #ThreeLions will face Spain, Croatia and Czechia in Group A3 of the #NationsLeague! pic.twitter.com/zXEGEhCdZ9\n— England (@England) February 12, 2026\nThe Nations League draw, held in Brussels on Thursday evening, saw England in Group A3 with Spain, Croatia and the Czech Republic.\nWales will be in Group A4 along with Portugal, Denmark and Norway. In Group B1, Scotland take on Switzerland, Slovenia and North Macedonia.\nNorthern Ireland are in Group B2 with Hungary, Ukraine and Georgia, while the Republic of Ireland are in Group B3 alongside Israel, Austria and Kosovo.\nMan Utd stress club values\nManchester United said the club takes pride in being “inclusive and welcoming” following co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s claim that the UK has been “colonised by immigrants”.\nRatcliffe said he was sorry if he had “offended some people” for his remarks in a Sky News interview on Wednesday, which were heavily criticised by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham.\nThe Press Association understands Ratcliffe’s claims will also be examined by the Football Association to see whether they brought the game into disrepute, while on Thursday afternoon the Premier League club issued a statement defending their inclusion policy.\nManchester United prides itself on being an inclusive and welcoming club.\nWe will continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride.\n— Manchester United (@ManUtd) February 12, 2026\nIt read: “Manchester United prides itself on being an inclusive and welcoming club. Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters, reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home.\n“Since launching All Red All Equal in 2016, we have embedded equality, diversity and inclusion into everything we do.\n“We remain deeply committed to the principles and spirit of that campaign. They are reflected in our policies but also in our culture and are reinforced by our holding of the Premier League’s Advanced Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Standard.”\nWhat’s on today?\nLiam Rosenior makes his return to @HullCity this weekend, as his @ChelseaFC side travel to the MKM Stadium for the #EmiratesFACup fourth round 🏆\nRosenior was an FA Cup runner-up with The Tigers back in 2014 before managing the club upon retirement 🤝 pic.twitter.com/MuUQdrnaAE\n— Emirates FA Cup (@EmiratesFACup) February 11, 2026\nThe FA Cup fourth round action starts with Chelsea looking to avoid an upset when they travel to Hull – where Blues boss Liam Rosenior will face his old club – while Wrexham host Sky Bet Championship rivals Ipswich.\nIn the Women’s Super League, leaders Manchester City – beaten last weekend by Arsenal – take on bottom club Leicester at the Joie Stadium.\nSeveral Premier League clubs are holding press conferences on Friday ahead of the weekend’s FA Cup ties.\nArne Slot and Eddie Howe are first up in the morning, with Pep Guardiola, Unai Emery, Marco Silva, Daniel Farke and Scott Parker all part of a busy afternoon schedule.",
