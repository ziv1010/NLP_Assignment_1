  "body_text": "LeBron James is taking himself off the pedestal.\nBecause when it comes to his and Savannah James’ decade-long marriage, the NBA superstar insisted that their relationship is far from “picture perfect.”\n“I’m gonna be honest,” LeBron said during a Sept. 18 episode of Speedy Morman’s 360 with Speedy podcast. “A relationship is never picture perfect. But if you’re okay with working through the hardships and the adverse moments, then it will make it all worth it.”\nAfter all, the couple—who met as teenagers while attending rival high schools—has had plenty of time to learn how to navigate even the hardest bumps in their relationship.\n“We’ve been together since high school, so s--t ain’t gonna always be a bed of roses,” the 40-year-old continued. “In any relationship, let alone someone you’ve been living with for 20 years.”\nAs for what he considers the secret to their lasting romance? Well, Lebron and Savannah—who share kids Bronny James, 20, Bryce James, 18, and Zhuri James, 10—live by three main principles.\n“Communication is number one,” LeBron explained. “Being honest is number two.

Let's get it!\"\nAs for what the “Satellites” rapper actually said to spark their recent feud? Well, he made it clear that he wouldn’t want to trade places with LeBron despite being “one of the greatest players to ever play the game.”\n\"I don't like the way Savannah look at LeBron,\" Kevin said in an April 19 Instagram video. \"I like the way them white women look at LeBron. As soon as he walked out there, they just be like, 'Oh oh oh.'\"\nDescribing Savannah as \"the warden of the jail,\" he added that LeBron's spirit \"is so loving and giving, it hurt me to see it.\"\nFor more athletes who took inspiration from LeBron and married their middle school, high school or college sweetheart, keep reading…",
