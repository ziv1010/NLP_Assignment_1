  "body_text": "Simone Biles debuted a daring new look as she starts off her Gold Over America Tour — and she looks utterly stunning.\nThe Olympic gymnast took to Instagram to reveal that she'd got a brand new hairstyle ahead of the big tour, as her usually long, dark hair now has subtle golden blonde highlights streaked through it. She smiled brightly to show how happy she was with her new look, as she captioned the selfie: \"I did a thing.\"\nThe bold new look certainly added a contrast to her wavy dark hair, which she typically wears up in a bun while performing. Clearly proud of the golden look - worthy of a gold medalist - she tagged her hairstylist Jazmine Johnson in the post, who reposted the image with the caption: \"Yes ma'am!! A thing was done!!!\"\nClearly proud of the look, she shared another selfie of herself with the blonde highlights on show as she showed off her goat necklace, captioning the photo: \"can't go on tour w/o my GOAT necklace,\" in reference to her being named the greatest of all time.\nSimone's transformation comes as she is currently spending some time apart from her husband Jonathan Owens, who has traveled to Chicago where he is playing for the Chicago Bears. His team played the Tennessee Titans on September 8, winning a triumphant victory in their first match of the season.\nNo doubt, Jonathan is loving his wife's new look, as he is one of her biggest fans in her impressive career.\nTaking time off from pre-season training to watch her at the Olympics, he was by her parents' side throughout the finals, wearing a shirt with her face and name emblazoned all over.\nGushing about his wife after her triumph at the Paris games, Jonathan said: \"When she did come back, she accomplished everything that she set her mind to.\"\n\"Just being able to witness every day the training you go through, obviously the first day when she had the injury a little bit to her calf, and just her ability to persevere through that and go out there and still dominate. It's just amazing to watch, man,\" he added in a press conference ahead of the NFL season.\n\"My wife's a warrior,\" he said. \"That's the one thing I tell people, just because I equate it to how we are in football. You know, you'll limp around and it'll hurt a little before, and then as soon as you go, it's like you forget about it.\"\n\"The way she was able to go out there and, like I said, look graceful with everything. You can't hide your excitement when you're out there, man.\" he said about watching her, expressing \"how much I love her and just how I'm proud for her.\"\nHe added off her achievements: \"I know how much work she put in to get to that point. How many people in the world can say they have a gold medal?\"",
