Like there's not enough sport on TV already? Switched off.\"\nA third said: \"What's going on why is the news on at 5? Where is the Chase??\" while another echoed the sentiment: \"Why change the whole evening schedule for a football match?\"\nMeanwhile, other viewers chose to watch The Chase's rival gameshow, Pointless, on BBC One instead.\n\"#TheChase has been cancelled for football so I'm watching #Pointless. Why does the world have to stop for sport!!\" one viewer wrote, while another said: \"No #TheChase. Time for #Pointless then.\"\nThe popular ITV quiz show, presented by Bradley Walsh, pits a team of top quizzers against four contestants who are aiming to win cash.\nThe team of expert quizzers, known as the Chasers, includes Shaun Wallace, aka The Dark Destroyer, Jenny Ryan, aka The Vixen, Darragh Ennis, aka The Menace, Mark Labbett, aka The Beast, Anne Hegerty, aka The Governess, and Paul Sinha, aka The Sinnerman.\nThe Chase airs weekdays on ITV1 at 5pm",
