  "body_text": "Great Britain’s hopes of having a women’s football team at the 2024 Olympics rest on the shoulders of Sarina Wiegman’s England.\nThe beaten 2023 Women’s World Cup finalists visit Scotland on Tuesday knowing that anything less than victory will mean Team GB go without representation in Paris next year.\nAdvertisement\nAnd missing out on the Olympics might not be in the best interests of the Scottish players who could be included in the squad if qualification is secured, raising questions of the format’s integrity.\nHere is why both teams face a rather uncomfortable situation when they meet.\nWhat do England need?\nFirstly, let’s take a look at the permutations.\nA dramatic stoppage-time winner from Ella Toone against the Netherlands kept England’s hopes of topping Group A1 alive. They came from 2-0 down in that game and need another victory to have a chance of progressing in the Nations League.\nThat win moved them level on points with the Netherlands, but they are below them in the group because of inferior goal difference. The last two fixtures in Group A1 are:\n- Netherlands vs Belgium\n- Scotland vs England\nHere is what England need to finish top:\n- If the Netherlands win, England need to win by three goals more than the Netherlands\n- If the Netherlands draw, England need to win\n- If the Netherlands lose, England need to win (as Belgium would move onto 11 points)\nSo, why does Team GB’s participation rest on England?\nIn the Olympics, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are grouped together as Great Britain. Whereas, in FIFA and UEFA competitions, they compete as four separate nations.\nTo avoid Team GB having four opportunities to qualify, the home nations had to nominate one team to carry the Union Flag in an attempt to make it to the Olympics next year.\nUnsurprisingly, European champions and recent World Cup finalists England were chosen.\nAnd how does qualification for the 2024 Olympics work?\n12 teams will play in the women’s football tournament at the 2024 Olympics. Five of those teams have already been confirmed: hosts (France), 2022 CONCACAF Championship winners (United States), 2022 Copa America finalists (Brazil and Colombia) and CONCACAF play-off winners (Canada).\nThe seven remaining places will go to: the two UEFA Women’s Nations League finalists, two Asian Football Confederation (AFC) qualifiers, one Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) qualifier and two Confederation of African Football (CAF) qualifiers.\nAdvertisement\nPreviously, European qualifying has been settled via finishing positions at the Women’s World Cup. But, this time, the Nations League holds the key.\nAs far as Team GB’s involvement is concerned, England must firstly finish top of Group A1. If they are able to do that, they will qualify for the Nations League semi-final where they will face another of the group winners. Winning that semi-final will secure Team GB a place at the 2024 Olympics.\nHow does this affect Scotland’s players?\nWhile the England players are the ones chosen to carry Team GB’s qualification hopes, the team itself — if qualified for the 2024 Olympics — can be comprised of players from each of the home nations.\nThat means some of the Scotland players facing England on Tuesday would be in contention for the Olympics squad.\nThe best example is Real Madrid’s Caroline Weir who would be an excellent addition to the pool of midfielders in Wiegman’s Lionesses squad. However, an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury suffered in September may not have recovered in time for her to be included.\nElsewhere, Erin Cuthbert of Chelsea and Bayern Munich’s Samantha Kerr (not to be confused with Australia captain Sam Kerr) are two more Scottish players who would be in contention.\nThey will know that a draw or win in that match could deny them an opportunity to compete at a major tournament, something that has often eluded them. After qualifying for Euro 2017 and the 2019 World Cup, they have been absent from the last two.\nWhat has been said?\nNetherlands head coach Andries Jonker has criticised UEFA and said a scenario like this “shouldn’t be possible”.\nEngland counterpart Sarina Wiegman understands Jonker’s position but expects Scotland to play to win.\nShe said: “I understand the conversations about it but if you have seen our group and if you have seen Scotland and if you know the history of Scotland and England, then there is no way that they are going to give away this game, they really want to beat England and we really want to beat them of course.\nAdvertisement\n“There’s such a rivalry that that’s absolutely not going to be the case, we saw that when we played in England and that’s what it’s going to be.”\nHave Team GB played in the women’s football event before?\nYes, twice.\nThey qualified automatically the first time in 2012 when London hosted the Olympics. The Football Association (FA) then outlined their intentions to lead Team GB’s qualification for Rio 2016 but objections from the football associations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland meant they did not compete.\nFIFA had stated that they would not be able to enter the Olympics unless all four home nations were in agreement and, four years later, they found one. England reached of the semi-final of the 2019 Women’s World Cup after that agreement had been reached, so Team GB’s place at Tokyo 2020 was confirmed.\nHowever, like in 2012, they did not make it past the quarter-final.\nGO DEEPER\nTeam GB, the 2024 Olympics and why failing to qualify matters\n(Top photo: Lewis Storey/Getty Images))",
