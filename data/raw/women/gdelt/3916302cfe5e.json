Crain’s…\n-\n- “Swipe fees are the third-largest cost to restaurants beyond food and labor,” Sam Toia, president of the Illinois Restaurant Association said.\n- Illinois’ Interchange Fee Prohibition Act, the first of its kind and signed into law in June, reduces the fees merchants pay credit card processors by exempting state and local taxes and tips from the calculation.\n- Arguments for and against the measure have been pouring into Chicago federal court ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Oct. 30 on the banks’ bid for a preliminary injunction blocking implementation of the law.\n* Related stories…\n- ∙ Center Square: Legal battle deepens over Illinois’ Interchange Fee Prohibition Act\n∙ Digital Transactions: Motions Fly in the Battle Over the Illinois Interchange Case Ahead of an Oct. 30 Hearing\n* WTTW | Future of Chicago-Area Public Transit Hangs in Balance as State Lawmakers Wrap Up Hearings on Agency Funding, Oversight: “We cannot shy away from the scale of the funding needs our transit system faces,” city of Chicago COO John Roberson said at the news conference where the report was unveiled. “It is significant, but the value transit provides for the city and for our region is immeasurable.” One of the options in the report calls for a strengthened RTA with new powers to coordinate service, fare policy and more among CTA, Metra and Pace. But the second, far bolder option — one that some saw as too ambitious for lawmakers to touch — proposed doing away with the current hodgepodge of structures and creating a new, single agency to oversee all transit in the Chicago region.\n* Sun-Times | Michael Madigan’s friendship with alleged fixer could be tested during their corruption trial: When Michael McClain retired from lobbying in 2015, he told then-House Speaker Madigan he was “at the bridge with my musket standing with and for the Madigan family.” McClain’s fealty to Madigan will soon come into sharp focus as they face a federal jury together.\n* Tribune | Amid false claims, Illinois elections officials push integrity, transparency — and maybe body armor: The roughly 100 men and women who oversee elections in Illinois — both Democrats and Republicans — have launched a voter integrity campaign to help debunk falsehoods being fed in large part by lies from former President Donald Trump and his allies that the 2020 election was stolen. But even as the elections officials open their offices for tours and make themselves available for questions about the voting process and the equipment they are using to count ballots for the Nov. 5 election, the head of their state association said he is considering purchasing body armor amid fears the conspiracy theories will turn physical.\n* Center Square | Safe storage, lost and stolen bill a ‘hot mess,’ Illinois rifle association says: In a news release, the Gun Violence Prevention PAC, G-PAC, said when legislators are in session, they should act on a package of bills making gun storage and lost and stolen reporting laws more strict. “The Safe At Home legislation will address the sobering realities that today, there are more guns in our country than people, and every one in three children lives in a home with a gun,” a statement from G-PAC President and CEO Kathleen Sances says. “There is mounting evidence that the risk of unintentional shootings, mass shootings and suicide can be significantly reduced if we make simple changes in our laws to keep us all Safe At Home.”\n* WMBD | State Rep. Sharon Chung and Desi Anderson battle for Illinois 91st House District: State Representative Chung said two years is not enough to get everything on her agenda done. She said she’s proud of the work she’s done thus far concerning the state’s fiscal health. “We’ve had nine straight credit upgrades, we’ve put money into our rainy day fund, we are paying back our bills on time,” said Chung. “That’s something I’m really proud of that we’ve been able to come out of that.”\n* Daily Southtown | Illinois House 36th District candidates say public safety is a top priority: Both candidates seeking to replace former state Rep. Kelly Burke in the 36th District say public safety is a top priority to address in a district that encompasses multiple southwest suburbs. Rick Ryan, 58, of Evergreen Park, has Burke’s endorsement and is facing Christine Shanahan McGovern, 54, of Oak Lawn, in the November election. Ryan was one of two candidates in the Democratic Primary in March while Shanahan McGovern ran unopposed on the Republican side.\n* WGLT | State Sen. Dave Koehler, challenger Sally Owens talk housing, guns, ethics and more at candidate forum: Koehler, the assistant majority Leader, has been serving in the Illinois Senate since 2006. Owens said that’s too long for any lawmaker to be in office. “You have to kind of question the guy who’s been in there for almost 20 years in the same job,” she said. Owens said term limits would limit political corruption. Koehler replied that experience matters in Springfield. […] Koehler said it’s hard to stop a lawmaker who is truly corrupt, adding he supported recent changes that limit legislative leadership posts to 10 years. Owens wants that cap for all lawmakers.\n* Medium | Linda Robertson, candidate for IL House of Representatives, District 65: She Votes Illinois is pleased to feature Linda Robertson, running for IL House of Representatives, District 65. Follow our series, She Runs Illinois 2024, leading up to election day as we showcase and uplift the voices of Illinois women running for public office in the upcoming election, November 5, 2024.\n* WAND | Treasurer Frerichs honors Illinois LGBTQ+ leaders during LGBTQ+ History Month: Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs honored leaders from across the state for their work to lift up the LGBTQ+ community this week. Frerichs is a strong advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and is committed to investments for equality. Illinois is a national leaders in LGBTQ+ rights, and Frerichs voted for civil unions while serving as a senator in 2011. He also voted in favor of marriage equality two years later.\n* WAND | Indigenous Peoples Day: Illinois laws honoring Native American ancestry: Lawmakers have created strong relationships with Native American leaders determined to address wrongs of the past and improve lives for the future. A 2023 law required the Illinois State Museum and federally recognized tribes to return native remains and artifacts for proper burial. It also allowed the state to create a cemetery for unidentifiable remains.\n* Tribune | 82 cannabis stores opened in Illinois, but social equity owners remain on the margins: Eighty-two new cannabis stores opened in Illinois in the past fiscal year, marking “explosive growth” in sales outlets for an industry that surpassed $2 billion in sales, the state reported. State regulators boasted in the 2024 annual report that “social equity” marijuana business owners, those who come from poor areas or who were most impacted by the war on drugs, now own nearly half of the 220 dispensaries statewide. But social equity owners say they remain largely on the fringe of the industry, because the state favors previously existing big businesses. A state disparity report showed social equity businesses collected only 12% of statewide revenues in the past year.\n* WGN | Illinois letter carriers demand safety improvements amidst rise in attacks: In the latest round of contract negotiations, measures to improve safety are among the top demands being made. Union leaders even said their letter carriers feel under-appreciated, working without a contract since May 2023. “They don’t understand what we face in our day. Each and every day as we go out there in fear!” Elise Foster with the Illinois State Association of Letter Carriers said at a rally at Chicago’s Federal Plaza.\n* WSIL | Illinois Fire Engine Strike Teams Demobilized from Hurricane Relief Efforts, Return to Illinois: All strike teams were scheduled back to Illinois by Sunday night. This includes 68 fire personnel with 34 fire agencies who supported and responded from across Illinois, MABAS-Illinois reported.\n* WTTW | Chicago Board of Education Committee Meeting Postponed Amid Member Turnover: While Johnson has sole authority to appoint members to the board, he said last week that those six remained nominees while they continued undergoing a vetting process before they could be officially appointed to the board. The mayor said the plan was to have them all in place before the board’s regular monthly meeting on Oct. 24.\n* Triibe | Architects of Chicago police oversight commission applaud success in eliminating gang database, Shotspotter and more: Since the passage of the ECPS ordinance, the CCPSA has taken on several key responsibilities, including responding to community concerns about public safety, conducting outreach, and making recommendations on police policy. Notably, the commission nominated Larry Snelling as the new CPD superintendent, eliminated the department’s gang database, and held public hearings on ShotSpotter and pretextual traffic stops, two issues some organizers, residents and police district councilors have voiced their opposition to at the hearings.\n* Tribune | As 7 charter schools plan to close, Chicago Teachers Union asks district to step in: Thousands of students and hundreds of teachers were left in a lurch Wednesday after the Acero Charter Schools Board of Directors voted unanimously to close seven of Acero’s 15 schools, the latest turn of events during a week of turmoil for Chicago Public Schools. Helena Stangle, Acero’s chief culture officer, said the board of directors’ decision to “consolidate their school system” did not come lightly. Several factors informed the board’s decision, including insufficient funds due to a lack of federal and state dollars and CPS’ budget shortfall; declining enrollment; changes in the neighborhoods the schools serve; and inadequate spaces to ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Stangle said.\n* Streetsblog | NIMBYs win: Ald. Knudsen, CDOT have removed Dickens Greenway plaza, enabling dangerous cut-through driving in Lincoln Park again: With little warning, it appears a Chicago Department of Transportation crew scraped out about half the green and tan paint on the road, and removed many of the flexible plastic posts that helped keep drivers out of the space. According to CDOT, the Dickens Greenway, including the plaza, were funded by about $1 million in Divvy bike-share revenue, i.e. by bicycle riders. The department has not yet answered the question of how much this removal will cost, and who is footing the bill.\n* Daily Herald | The state of Union Station: Eye-catching art amid construction and a megaproject low on cash: For months, Metra and Amtrak riders have powered through a maze of scaffolding at Union Station as, above them, Canal Street is rebuilt. That drab landscape was hit with a kaleidoscope last week when Amtrak debuted three public art installations, which will be on display through summer 2025. Here’s a look at the exhibits, a construction update and what’s happening with an underfunded megaproject to upgrade the 100-year rail hub.\n* WGN | ‘Everyone loves a dog:’ Meet the Chicago Lighthouse Guide Dogs: “The Chicago Lighthouse has been 118 years in the making,” said Janet Szlyk, the president and CEO of the Chicago Lighthouse. The Chicago Lighthouse is a social service agency that helps the blind and visually impaired navigate life in the city.\n* NBC Chicago | Chicago Bears’ record holds strong in tough NFC North race: It’s a rare sight to see a team with a 4-2 record be in last place in their division, but for the Chicago Bears, this season has been far from ordinary in the NFC North standings. The Bears are indeed in the last spot in the division, with the Minnesota Vikings, Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions all off to strong starts to the season.\n* Tribune | ‘We were all stabbed:’ Community marks a year since the death of 6-year-old Palestinian boy: Wadee Alfayoumi, 6, and his mother were living in unincorporated Plainfield Township last fall when their landlord, Joseph Czuba, allegedly attacked them with a knife, killing the boy and leaving his mother Shahin with serious injuries. Wadee’s death drew national attention and highlighted the spike in Islamaphobia that accompanied the war’s outbreak, which has also brought a rise in anti-semitism. Will County prosecutors said later that Czuba had become “heavily interested” in the Israel-Hamas war through conservative talk radio and had become convinced that his Palestinian and Muslim tenants would hurt him and asked them to move out before he allegedly stabbed the pair.\n* WGN | Wild cat is on the loose in the northwest suburbs, police say: Hoffman Estates police personnel took to social media on Monday to confirm that department officials had been informed of the wild cat sighting. Police added that neighbors spotted the large cat in the area of Della Drive and the Hilldale Golf Course. “The cat has been identified as a caracal,” police said. “This cat is a native species to Asia and not common to the United States.\n* WCIA | ADM fire at Decatur facility contained with ‘no injuries’: A fire Monday afternoon at the ADM facility led to an evacuation, but no one was injured, according to an ADM representative. “This afternoon at approximately 3:10 p.m., a fire occurred at the Sorbitol production department in ADM’s Decatur complex. There were no injuries, and no other areas of the processing plant were impacted by the fire,” the ADM spokesperson said.\n* WTVO | Firefighters booed at South Beloit homecoming parade: Residents booed firefighters during a South Beloit homecoming parade and football game this weekend after the city entered a staffing agreement with a firehouse across the Wisconsin border, according to the fire department. According to city administrators, staffing issues at the South Beloit Firehouse, at 429 Gardner Street, forced the city to make a deal with the Town of Beloit Fire Department to provide a rotation of full-time employees.\n* Crain’s | NIU receives largest donation ever to fund new health-tech hub: Northern Illinois University just landed the largest gift in its history to help fund a new $87 million health care and technology-focused hub for students across disciplines. The Baustert Family Foundation, founded by James and Theo (Bahwell) Baustert, philanthropists who donate throughout Illinois, Minnesota and beyond, gifted $40 million to the state school in DeKalb, NIU announced yesterday.\n* Rockford Register Star | Rockford area animal shelter runs at-capacity, celebrates $2.4 million renovation: “It’s a great day for Winnebago County to have this expansion officially open.” said Joe Chiarelli, chairman of the Winnebago County Board. “It’s increased by 4,000 square feet, which I learned today is already at full capacity. It’s a constant need. We have a lot of animals that come in here for care.”\n* PJ Star | The last two months have been very good for Peoria’s airport: Peoria’s airport had two record-setting months in 2024, bringing more passengers to the airport than ever before during the months of August and September. This year marks the first time the airport has set a monthly record since before the COVID-19 pandemic began. General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport in August served 57,353 passengers across 400 commercial flights, a 1.3% uptick from the previous August high of 56, 639 passengers, set in 2019.\n* Tech Xplore | Google used influence, ultimatum to cut deal on California news: Google was negotiating to spend $110 million to support California’s struggling journalism industry, but the search giant had a demand: taxpayers would need to contribute tens of millions of dollars as well. State Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, the Oakland Democrat discussing a deal with Google, called California Governor Gavin Newsom’s office to secure his support for $70 million from taxpayers, even as the state faced a challenging budget deficit. The pact that Google, the governor and Wicks settled on in late August was a handshake agreement, according to Wicks’ staff. Weeks later, while there is now a written framework for the deal, some of the key provisions have yet to be worked out.\n* The Verge | The Optimus robots at Tesla’s Cybercab event were humans in disguise: Attendee Robert Scoble posted that he’d learned humans were “remote assisting” the robots, later clarifying that an engineer had told him the robots used AI to walk, spotted Electrek. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote that the robots “relied on tele-ops (human intervention)” in a note, the outlet reports. There are obvious tells to back those claims up, like the fact that the robots all have different voices or that their responses were immediate, with gesticulation to match.\n* Texas Monthly | The Border Crisis Won’t Be Solved at the Border: Whenever Texas politicians threaten to pass laws that would make it harder for businesses to employ undocumented workers, phones in the Capitol start ringing. Stuck with the need to show their base that they’re cracking down on migrants, politicians, including Abbott, have instead found a middle ground: They keep up their bombast regarding the border, but they avoid stringing any razor wire between undocumented immigrants and jobs in the state’s interior. Today, Texas is home to some 1.6 million undocumented immigrants, according to a Pew Research Center study of 2022 census data. No industry in the state employs a greater number of unauthorized workers than construction, the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute found. Since 2000, Texas’s population has grown by around 10 million, with many new arrivals chasing the “Texas Miracle”—a fast-growing economy that’s the envy of other states. Construction workers lacking legal status have laid the foundations for this miracle. They erected the work camps housing pipe fitters and roughnecks out in the oil fields. They rebuilt Houston after Hurricane Harvey. And they built thousands of apartment complexes and homes, helping Texas avoid the worst of the affordable-housing shortage that is crippling other states.\n-\n- @misterjayem - Tuesday, Oct 15, 24 @ 8:15 am:\n“There is mounting evidence that the risk of unintentional shootings, mass shootings and suicide can be significantly reduced if we make simple changes in our laws to keep us all Safe At Home.”\nMy firearms have trigger locks and are stored inside a case with two different locks.\nThat not only reduces the likelihood of their being stolen and used in a crime, three different combination locks is just too much effort when you’re super-depressed.\n– MrJM\n-\n- JS Mill - Tuesday, Oct 15, 24 @ 9:14 am:\n@MrJM- You are doing it right. In so many different ways.\n-\n- Anyone Remember - Tuesday, Oct 15, 24 @ 9:44 am:\nThe Nobel Prize in Economics. Those sounds you hear are Milton Friedman and Margaret Thatcher rolling over in their graves … .\n-\n- Donnie Elgin - Tuesday, Oct 15, 24 @ 11:56 am:\n=Safe storage, lost and stolen bill a ‘hot mess,’ Illinois rifle association says=\nThe safe storage bill is essentially impossible to enforce or regulate—the prohibited person language is just plain silly—and if passed, the actual compliance will be impossible to estimate. The law would make it illegal for a person in fear of various potentially violent situations (such as domestic abuse) from being able to quickly defend themselves.\n-\n- Loyal Virus - Tuesday, Oct 15, 24 @ 11:59 am:\nWelcome back Isabel!\n-\n- Fav Human - Tuesday, Oct 15, 24 @ 12:41 pm:\nThe three U.S.-based academics studied why some countries are rich and others poor and have documented that freer, open societies are more likely to prosper.\nDame Thatcher’s rotational velocity might be much less than you think.\n-\n- Demoralized - Tuesday, Oct 15, 24 @ 12:47 pm:\n==from being able to quickly defend themselves.==\nThat is such a cop out every time someone talks about being responsible in how you store your firearms. Maybe if people acted responsibly you wouldn’t need legislation like this. Secure your firearms. Period. No excuses.\n-\n- thisjustinagain - Tuesday, Oct 15, 24 @ 1:40 pm:\nI welcome back Isabel with a Laurel, and Hardy handshake.\n-\n- JS Mill - Tuesday, Oct 15, 24 @ 3:24 pm:\n=The law would make it illegal for a person in fear of various potentially violent situations (such as domestic abuse) being able to quickly defend themselves.=\nNo, it would not. Maybe take a minute to look into modern methods used to safely secure a weapon. There are many on the market. Mine cost less than $800 and takes me less than 10 seconds to access my weapon of choice.\nSorry, comments for this post are now closed.",
