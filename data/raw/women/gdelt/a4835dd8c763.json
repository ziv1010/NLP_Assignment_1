  "body_text": "USWNT forward Catarina Macario will miss this summer’s Olympics Games with a knee injury.\nUSWNT head coach Emma Hayes said on Friday that the 24-year-old has “minor knee irritation” and will not take part in the tournament.\nForward Lynn Williams, who was originally listed as an alternate, will replace Macario in the 18-player roster.\nDefender Emily Sams has been added as an alternate and will travel to Paris with the team.\nAdvertisement\nMacario suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury while playing for former side Lyon in June 2022 and missed the 2023 World Cup, making her return to playing after 20 months out in March earlier this year with new club Chelsea.\n“I think considering everything that Cat’s been through, it’s important she goes back to Chelsea and she will not be available for the Olympics,” Hayes said. “I’m absolutely gutted for Cat, someone I’ve worked hard with. In the last 12 months she’s really put a shift in to get there. But it’s not to be and I know the team certainly want to give her our best support.”\nMacario made eight Women’s Super League appearances for Chelsea last season, helping the club win the title on the final day of the campaign. She has been capped 18 times at international level, scoring nine goals.\nThe forward wrote on Instagram: “Gutted to have to withdraw from the Olympic roster and not be able to represent Team USA. I will be supporting the team every step of the way and the girls are ready.”\nTeams at the Olympics are allowed to replace an injured player in the 18-player roster up to six hours before a match with a listed alternate. The injured player is permitted to return to the roster after they have recovered.\nAlternates train with the team as though they might need to be available at a moment’s notice, and this change means there is now not much tangible difference between having an 18 player roster compared to one comprising of 22 players.\n“To be honest with you nothing (has changed) because I always viewed it as 22 with the rule changes and such. Absolutely nothing changes,” Hayes said. “What does change is that without Cat is I have to think about some different permutations for the team which I’ve already reflected on and for us, it’s about now looking towards that.”\nAdvertisement\nHer replacement Williams, 31, is the National Women’s Soccer League’s (NWSL) all-time top scorer and has been capped 63 times by the U.S., scoring 18 goals and providing 12 assists.\nThe Gotham FC forward was a member of the roster at the 2023 World Cup and was also called up to the final Olympic roster for the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 having initially been named as an alternate. She has been involved with the senior squad since 2016.\nSams, 25, plays her club football for Orlando Pride and this summer’s camp was her first USWNT call-up.\nShe has been part of the Orlando backline that has enjoyed the best defensive record in the NWSL this season, conceding just 12 goals in 16 matches.\nThe U.S., four-time Olympic champions in women’s soccer, took the bronze medal at Tokyo.\nHayes’ side face Zambia, Germany and Australia in the group stages of the competition. The Games mark new head coach Hayes’ first major tournament in charge.\nThe USWNT open its Olympic campaign against Zambia on July 25.\nThe U.S. Soccer Federation said in a statement: “NJ/NY Gotham FC forward and 2020 Olympian Lynn Williams has been confirmed by the IOC, the USOPC (United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee) and FIFA to replace midfielder Catarina Macario on the U.S. Women’s National Team roster for the 2024 Paris Olympics. Macario is unable to prepare physically for the Olympic tournament due to consistent irritation in her right knee.”\nDiscover more on the USWNT ahead of Paris 2024\n- Emily Sams speaks to Full Time with Meg Linehan\n- Hayes says Olympic roster policy offers ‘flexibility’\n- Breaking down USWNT’s Olympic roster and Alex Morgan’s snub\n(Dustin Bradford/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)",
