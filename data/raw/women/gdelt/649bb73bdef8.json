The result was a massive blow to Vinícius Júnior’s fans, teammates, and compatriots, who have taken the time to console him and question the integrity of the award.\nMeanwhile, Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmatí won the women’s edition of the Ballon d’Or award, beating teammates Caroline Graham Hansen and Salma Paralluelo. This marks her second consecutive win of the prestigious title.\nBarcelona wonderkid Lamine Yamal, who finished 8th in the Ballon d’Or ranking, won the Kopa Trophy, becoming the youngest player to claim the award at just 17 years old.\nArgentina and Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez won his second consecutive Yachine Trophy as the best goalkeeper in the world.\nThe Real Madrid team was awarded the Best Team of the Year in the grand finale held in Paris, France.\nCarlo Ancelotti from Real Madrid is the Men’s Johan Cruyff Trophy winner after guiding the team to their 15th UEFA Champions League triumph last season.\nWinner of the Men’s and Women’s categories of the award.\nAdemola Lookman, the sole African on the shortlist for the award, secured 14th place in the ranking.",
