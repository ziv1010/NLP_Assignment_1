Delay and dither over offering a sufficiently enticing deal — even though United say their offer would have made her the highest earner in the squad — meant Arsenal could convince her to head south to London.\nAdvertisement\nOna Batlle followed Russo out of the door and joined Barcelona as a free agent, with United again not tabling an acceptable offer soon enough.\nThe momentum from qualifying for the Champions League was diminished and a third exit was announced on June 30, with Martin Ho, Marc Skinner’s highly regarded assistant, leaving United to take the head coach role at Norwegian club Brann Kvinner.\nHo was viewed as tactically astute, would often lead training sessions and has been described as the driving force behind United. When he left, United said the search to find his replacement was “already underway”.\nHo’s successor, however, has not yet been appointed, despite their Women’s Super League season starting away to Aston Villa on October 1. The job advert, which Skinner posted on his LinkedIn profile, gave a deadline of August 6 for applications.\nWith Ho, Russo, and Batlle all gone, United could not afford to lose another prized asset. However, Mary Earps, their England international goalkeeper who is regarded as one of the world’s best in her position, made it clear she wanted to leave. United responded by digging their heels in.\nGO DEEPER\nMan Utd realise UWCL broadcast error, will show PSG game\nEarps’ deal expires next summer and her situation has turned into Russo 2.0. Negotiations about a new contract began after England’s European Championship victory in July 2022 and United turned down a world-record bid for the goalkeeper from Arsenal before the WSL transfer window closed on September 14.\n“She’s been exceptional for years, so of course we wanted to keep her and build on what we want to do, which is win,” Skinner said. “Our relationship has been brilliant through this — open conversation and communication and she’s 100 per cent committed.\n“She wants to win and so do I. We’re aligned in our thinking and our team needs to perform. As long as we want the same thing, it’s a perfect marriage.”\nAdvertisement\nSteve Deaville had always been responsible for negotiating women’s contracts at United, but in October the club appointed former Brighton & Hove Albion general manager Polly Bancroft as head of women’s football (a new role that involves dealing with player contracts).\nIt has been a testing period — no more so than when United’s decision-making over Mason Greenwood’s future threatened to deflect attention from the efforts of the club’s England internationals — Earps, Ella Toone and Katie Zelem — at the Women’s World Cup.\nDespite the outgoings, there is a consensus among sources close to the United dressing room, who have requested anonymity to protect jobs and relationships, that an argument can be made for the squad being stronger now than going into summer.\nTen players arrived during the window, including Japan international Hinata Miyazawa, the 2023 World Cup’s Golden Boot winner.\nOthers who arrived were Irene Guerrero, a World Cup winner with Spain, from Atletico Madrid on deadline day; Gemma Evans, who joined as a free agent from Reading; Geyse Da Silva Ferreira from Barcelona; Emma Watson from Rangers; Evie Rabjohn from Aston Villa; Gabby George from Everton; Phallon Tullis-Joyce from OL Reign; and Melvine Malard from Lyon.\nSkinner tried to entice players by selling United as an exciting project. He could point to their Champions League involvement this season and how they came within touching distance of winning the WSL, finishing second and just two points behind winners Chelsea.\n“They’re a top-three club, they’re fighting for the top spot,” Rabjohn said when asked what attracted her to United. “I’ve known Marc since I was young. To know he has my best interests at heart and wants the best for me is exactly what I need.”\nThere is a counter-argument, which is that the squad may not contain the quality to compete with Chelsea and Arsenal, especially with the demands of the Champions League.\nComing up clutch 💪\nEnjoy @LuciaGarcia17's goal and the rest of Sunday's key moments here 👇#MUWomen\n— Manchester United Women (@ManUtdWomen) September 18, 2023\nWhile trying to build that squad, the club also struggled to get deals over the line quickly owing to what has been described as a convoluted recruitment process, according to two agents who also spoke anonymously to protect their future relationships.\nAdvertisement\nHarvey Bussell, head of women’s recruitment, Sam Barnett, United’s head of negotiations who moved over from the men’s side, and Bancroft were all involved at different stages, confusing intermediaries in terms of who they should be contacting, according to the two agents.\nOn August 11, The Guardian reported a decision about Greenwood’s potential return to the men’s first team had been delayed to “consult World Cup players” in Australia and New Zealand.\nGreenwood had not played for United since January 2022 and the club launched an internal investigation after charges against the forward — all of which he denied — were dropped in February.\nUnited insist their plan was never to delegate the decision-making to their female players but they wanted to give the team notice and the opportunity for feedback. Instead, United’s female players found themselves the victims of social media abuse on the eve of England’s World Cup quarter-final against Colombia on August 12.\nIn response to social media posts from United’s official women’s account about the game, which England won 2-1, users petitioned Zelem, Earps and Toone to allow Greenwood’s return. The messages were seen by players and The Athletic has also been told that some of the posts were more threatening, to the extent one agent considered enlisting cybersecurity support for his client.\nUltimately, United decided not to bring back Greenwood, and waited until the day after England’s defeat by Spain in the World Cup final to make their public announcement.\n“Timings have also been influenced by my desire to minimise the impact of the investigation on our men’s and women’s teams, as well as our Lionesses,” said United’s chief executive, Richard Arnold. “I acknowledge that this gave more time for speculation, but the alternative would have been to compromise due process or create untimely disruption.”\nAdvertisement\nUnited called a meeting with their women’s players the next day. Football director John Murtough led the conversation, outlining the process that brought the club to this point. Bancroft also spoke.\nSeveral members of the women’s squad had been prepared to criticise the club in the media if Greenwood, now on a season-long loan at Getafe, had been allowed to stay at Old Trafford. Privately, one player even intended to ask to leave had he been brought back.\nBut the meeting between Murtough and the players was described as reaching a positive conclusion, even if the Lionesses trio were not involved as they made their way back from Australia. Crossed wires meant United did not facilitate a video call, believing the players wanted to get on with their post-tournament holidays. One non-World Cup player dialled in via FaceTime on a team-mate’s phone.\nOn the pitch, United drew 2-2 with Leicester City and beat Everton 1-0 in pre-season friendlies, before taking their preparations for the 2023-24 campaign to Adidas’ campus in Herzogenaurach, Germany.\nThey left Manchester on September 4 and were joined by Earps, Zelem and Toone. United’s six-day camp included a game against Bayern Munich, which they lost 3-2 after going 2-0 ahead.\nThe players travelled around the campus on bicycles and bonded by going on a trip to the local bowling alley, where they also played pool and darts. Time off was also spent playing basketball, beach volleyball, tennis and padel. On the players’ final night, they headed to Nuremberg for a team meal.\n“It has been a great camp,” Toone told the club’s website. “We’ve had some good days on the grass and we’ve also done a lot off the pitch, which is really nice.”\nFollowing their return to Manchester, Skinner’s side beat Liverpool 3-1 in a friendly, with Toone scoring twice, then finished their pre-season fixtures at St George’s Park, where they beat Tottenham 1-0.\nAdvertisement\n“I don’t want any easy games,” Skinner said after the victory against Spurs. “We aren’t going to get them in the league or in cup competitions. We are building connections still and there is loads more to come.\n“We’ve got a team full of international quality and for the work (transfers) we’ve done, ideally we would have liked to have done it earlier, but from my perspective, we will go into the first game as prepared as we possibly can.”\nAfter the start of their WSL campaign, United will then play their maiden Champions League match in the first leg against Paris Saint-Germain on October 10 at Leigh Sports Village.\nThey have already sold out their 4,052 season tickets — priced at £60 ($73) for adults and £30 for under-16s — which was a record and an indication of fans’ positivity.\nThe mood inside the dressing room is also positive, despite this summer of considerable change.\nGO DEEPER\nSpain's women are world champions - yet the disrespect goes on\n(Top photo: Naomi Baker via Getty Images)",
