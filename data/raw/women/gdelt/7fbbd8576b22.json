  "body_text": "England centre-back Millie Bright is taking the positives from her knee injury by insisting being able to rest ahead of the 2023 Women’s World Cup could be a blessing in disguise.\nBright, 29, has been out since sustaining the injury in March. It means the Chelsea defender has been able to rest and recuperate ahead of what could prove to be a busy summer in Australia and New Zealand.\nAdvertisement\nThe England regular, who has been capped 66 times and is set to captain her country in the absence of the injured Leah Williamson, was pictured on the training pitch at St George’s Park on Tuesday but said Saturday’s friendly against Portugal is likely to be too soon to make her comeback appearance.\nEngland’s first game against Haiti should be an acheiveable target however.\nBright said: “The amount of minutes I’ve played before this has been ridiculous. I feel physically and mentally fresher than I’ve ever felt.\n“Just based on the amount I’ve played it’s been a blessing that I’m recovering. I’ve been putting in the work and I’ll be doing that until the tournament, so I have no concerns at all.\n“I can’t remember the last time I had longer than two weeks off. It’s been a fair few years now. Not the injury but otherwise it has been a blessing in disguise that I’ve been able to have a clean slate. I’ve played through many injuries but with this one, I couldn’t quite get there.\n“I think Saturday will be a little bit too soon. I’m not back with the girls and I don’t want to rush that. Obviously, we have a lot of time until the first game. I’m gutted not to make that one but at the same time, I’m exactly where I want to be.\n“I think we are a little bit ahead. There’s a big chunk of time before the first game so we are really confident and everything is going exactly the way we want it to go.”\nAlex Greenwood suffered an injury scare during Tuesday’s training session but the Manchester City defender said it’s nothing to worry about.\n“I’ll be OK,” said Greenwood. “It’s sore, but it’s football. It was a tackle, part of the game. No (it’s nothing to worry about).”\nEngland’s World Cup campaign begins on July 22 when they face Haiti.\nThe European champions will then take on Group D rivals Denmark and China on July 28 and August 1 respectively.\n(Photo: Getty Images)",
