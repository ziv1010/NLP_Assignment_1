You can really feel the appreciation.\n\"It's incredible. When I came here in 2021 I never expected it to be like this. It's been so special. To be so accepted here and the journey we've been on, to be an honourary dame, is hard to describe what an honour it is.\"\nWiegman could not quite believe it when she received a call from the British Ambassador to the Netherlands at the end of last year confirming her exalted place on the New Year Honours List.\nIt is something she wishes she could share with the people that have played a role in her coaching journey.\n\"It makes it so special. We've done well but so much work has gone into the last 10, 20 years by people that haven't been visible. They paved the way and we've continued that with incredible people and incredible staff,\" she added.\n\"We've been accepted and people appreciate you being here and enjoy me being here. It gives me an incredible feeling.\"\nThe time for celebrating and receiving accolades is almost over and Wiegman cannot wait to get back to football again.\nShe has been planning ahead of England's difficult World Cup qualifiers, which kick-off in March.\nThe Lionesses are in a tough group with Iceland, Ukraine and world champions Spain.\n\"With the qualities we have, if we're at our best we should qualify for the World Cup,\" said Wiegman.\n\"We have different scenarios, we're going out there to win every game but we know that's very difficult. It's very hard to top the group.\n\"The team's in a good place, most of the players are. I can feel everyone's ready to get started again. We have to qualify first. We've started a new cycle playing games against Ukraine and Iceland, who I haven't faced with England.\n\"We've also got Spain, we can't get rid of each other. I'm also excited to look ahead longer term but not taking for granted qualifying.\"\nEngland won the Euros the hard way with extra-time and penalties needed to secure them their second European title.\nWith only the top team in the group automatically qualifying for Brazil 2027, she will be hoping for a less dramatic path to the next summer's tournament.",
