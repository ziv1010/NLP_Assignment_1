Benfica hosted the LaLiga side in the final league phase game this week, and heading into the final minute, needed a goal to secure their place in the play-offs.\nThey were already leading 3-2 against nine-man Real Madrid when goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin headed home. The defeat condemned Alvaro Arbeloa's side to ninth place in the table and two extra play-off fixtures.\nBenfica have now won three of the clubs' previous four European meetings, including the 1962 European Cup final, and it will be another chance for Mourinho to get one over on his old club, the 15-time champions of Europe.\nChampions League holders PSG also had to settle for a play-off spot after their draw at Newcastle on Wednesday, and will face an all-French tie with Monaco.\nJuventus have been drawn against Galatasaray, while fellow Italians Inter Milan face Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt, who beat Manchester City in their penultiamte league phase game.\nAtletico Madrid will play Club Brugge, while Bundesliga clubs Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen face Atalanta and Olympiacos respectively.\nThe draw for the round of 16 will be made after the conclusion of the play-off fixtures on February 27.\nChampions League knockout play-off draw in full\n- Benfica vs Real Madrid\n- Bodo/Glimt vs Inter Milan\n- Monaco vs PSG\n- Qarabag vs Newcastle\n- Galatasaray vs Juventus\n- Club Brugge vs Atletico Madrid\n- Borussia Dortmund vs Atalanta\n- Olympiacos vs Bayer Leverkusen\nWho could English teams face in the round of 16?\nArsenal - Borussia Dortmund, Atalanta, Olympiacos or Leverkusen\nMan City - Benfica, Real Madrid, Bodo/Glimt or Inter\nChelsea - Qarabag, Newcastle, Monaco or PSG\nLiverpool or Tottenham - Galatasaray, Juventus, Club Brugge or Atletico Madrid\nNewcastle - Chelsea or Barcelona\nEngland set for fifth Champions League spot\nOne of the benefits of English teams performing so strongly in Europe is that the Premier League is now all but certain to repeat last season's feat of clinching a fifth Champions League spot by finishing in the top two of UEFA's coefficient table.\nWith five Premier League teams having gone straight into the Champions League last 16, and with all nine Premier League teams in Europe still alive in their respective competitions, England sits comfortably top of the table ahead of Germany.\nNewcastle were the beneficiaries last season, clinching their place in this campaign's Champions League with a fifth-placed Premier League finish. Now the door is open for another side to take advantage as English teams continue to perform strongly on the continent.\nWhen are the 2025/26 Champions League knockout stages?\nPlay-off draw: January 30, 2026\nKnockout play-offs: February 17-18 and 24-25, 2026\nRound of 16: March 10-11 and 17-18, 2026\nQuarter-finals: April 7-8 and 14-15, 2026\nSemi-finals: April 28-29 and May 5-6, 2026\nFinal: Saturday, May 30, 2026\nWhere is the Champions League final being held in 2026?\nThe 2025/26 Champions League final will take place in Budapest at the Puskas Arena on Saturday May 30.",
