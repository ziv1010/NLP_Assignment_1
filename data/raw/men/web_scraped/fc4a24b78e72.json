Odobert was following his team-mate in his own car and had pulled over out of concern.\n- Transfer Centre LIVE! | Tottenham news & transfers⚪\n- Spurs fixtures & scores | FREE highlights▶️\n- Got Sky?

Unfortunately he picked up a hamstring injury to be out for four weeks.\n\"Micky has not travelled. Minor thing. It's possible he's available for the weekend (against Manchester City).\"\nFrank then clarified Van de Ven's \"minor\" issue was not hamstring related after the Netherlands international suffered similar injury problems during the 2024/25 campaign.\nFrank: Lots of things going in right direction behind scenes\nFrank insisted \"a lot of things\" are going in the right direction behind the scenes at Tottenham.\nIt is a case of deja vu for Spurs, given they have again struggled domestically this season but excelled in Europe, with last week's victory over Borussia Dortmund a much-needed lift for Frank at a time when the fanbase has turned on the Danish coach.\nHe faced more chants about \"getting sacked in the morning\" after Saturday's 2-2 draw at Burnley, which made it two victories in 14 league matches to leave Tottenham only eight points above 18th-placed West Ham.\nYet, Frank's current focus is on the Champions League and he added: \"We have a great opportunity to secure a position in the top eight, which would be a very good result, a very good achievement.\n\"Be very positive, we're looking forward to that. That's what we are focusing everything we can on.\n\"The other thing is that I think the performances for a while have been good in many ways. We just haven't got on the right side enough to get the three points.\n\"We are working very hard on that. Sometimes you are on that spell, the players are giving you everything but for me tomorrow, it's all about the opportunity.\n\"Again, it's my job to look a little bit in the bigger perspective. Even though we haven't won as much as we want, it's very, very few things that need to go our way, the small margins, keep doing the right thing.\n\"Sometimes it's the small things where even if you're doing them you don't get the result and then the whole thing is a catastrophe but actually behind the scenes, there's a lot of things going in the right direction.\"",
