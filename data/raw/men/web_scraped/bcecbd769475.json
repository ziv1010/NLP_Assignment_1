  "body_text": "Chelsea: Liam Rosenior's quietly impressive start comes into focus after Napoli win amid pivotal week\nChelsea boss Liam Rosenior has won five of his first six games in charge, including the important Champions League triumph at Napoli on Wednesday night; Rosenior has steered Blues into last 16 but key West Ham and Arsenal games up next in Premier League and Carabao Cup\nSaturday 31 January 2026 17:18, UK\nLiam Rosenior's arrival at Chelsea has generated plenty of noise, with critical focus on his CV, status and manager-speak comments to the media. But quietly his actions have created a positive foundation to build on.\nIt's five wins out of six matches for the head coach and the 3-2 win away at Napoli on Wednesday, which sealed Chelsea's automatic progress to the knockout phase, was the most impressive of the lot. In fact, it's the standout result of his managerial career to date.\nThe back-three system he began the game with didn't work as planned. But Rosenior's in-game changes swung the momentum towards his side in the second half.\n\"I'm learning all the time,\" Rosenior said afterwards, while also playing down his role and talking up his players.\nThat humble approach appears to have won admiration from the squad. A clip of Joao Pedro laughing with his head coach after the game in Naples was seemingly a glimpse of a happy camp, while captain Reece James said \"every session we're improving\" under Rosenior's management.\n- Got Sky?

Get Sky Sports or stream with no contract on NOW📺\nA first away win of this Champions League campaign, on the back of three points at Crystal Palace which bust a five-game winless away streak in the Premier League, certainly suggests he is getting the application he is after from his players.\nJames did note that it is still \"early\" in that relationship and \"we're still getting used to him and the style of football he wants to play\" and unquestionably there has been evidence of that on the pitch. Passages of play in the recent home wins over Brentford and Pafos, for example, were not as fluid as Chelsea fans would have hoped.\nBut there should be cautious optimism about the impact he has had so far.\nIt's certainly an early return which belies the criticism Rosenior has received for what he has done away from matchdays.\nThere have been jibes about the 41-year-old's enthusiastic clapping at the side of the training pitch and denied speculation of Lego-building sessions to sharpen his players' minds, while the resurfaced quote from his Strasbourg days about breaking down the word 'manage' into 'man' and 'age' drew mirth.\nBut while there seems to have been a desire to characterise Rosenior as someone who relies on gimmicks and corporate talk, his answers on his technical and tactical ideas in the game are detailed and interesting, reflective of his impressive stint as a Sky Sports pundit in the past.\nWatching him from the media seating behind the dugout at Stamford Bridge, he is constantly in dialogue with his coaching staff, listening, discussing and taking on board advice and observations. Set-piece coach Bernardo Cueva has been promoted to a front-row seat, reflecting a new, more collegiate approach under Rosenior.\nIn many senses, he is a typical modern manager. Young, connected to his players, committed to a clear style and detailed in patterns of play.\nThat youthfulness, and the fact he has managed just 159 games, has led to scepticism about his qualifications for the scale of the Chelsea job.\nThose concerns may yet still play out. But so far a 3-2 first-leg defeat at home to Arsenal in the Carabao Cup semi-finals is the only meaningful blot on his otherwise encouraging start to life in west London.\n- Transfer Centre LIVE! | Chelsea news & transfers🔵\n- Chelsea fixtures & scores | FREE Chelsea highlights▶️\nHe has spoken about needing to be a \"winning\" Chelsea manager but he will also feel he hasn't fully got going yet. The win over Napoli can help in more ways than one.\nAs a result of that victory, Chelsea have avoided a two-legged play-off to reach the last 16, which opens up training weeks in February to increasingly make his mark on this team.\n\"He hasn't had that length of time with these players since he arrived,\" reported Sky Sports News' Gary Cotterill from Naples. \"It's been match-prepare-match-prepare. I think he's looking forward to that.\"\nThat Napoli win - against celebrated former Blues boss Antonio Conte no less - is also the first part of an important trio of games for Rosenior and Chelsea.\nNext up is West Ham at home in the Premier League on Saturday, where the Blues will be aiming to strengthen their Champions League qualification prospects, and then the Carabao Cup second leg against Arsenal on Tuesday at the Emirates Stadium, with both live on Sky Sports.\nIt is set to be a pivotal week.\n\"The jury was still out on Rosenior with the Chelsea fans about whether he is experienced enough,\" explained Sky Sports' Paul Merson. \"However, beating Napoli away in a big football match to qualify for the top eight, that will go a long way to helping the fans overcome those doubts.\n\"Winning in Naples is a good start to what is a big week with games against West Ham and Arsenal to come. If he can get three wins, he'd be a hero at Chelsea.\"\nA quietly successful start? By this time next week there could be more people banging the drum about the job Rosenior has done at Chelsea so far.",
