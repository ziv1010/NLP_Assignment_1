Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester City also clinched top-eight finishes to go straight into the last 16.\nHere's a look at some of the key themes from the league phase and what we know about the impending knockout stages.\n- Champions League league phase final table\n- Got Sky? Watch Premier League games LIVE on your phone📱\n- No Sky? Get Sky Sports or stream with no contract on NOW📺\nPremier League clubs dominate\nThe final standings underline the strength of the Premier League.\nFive of the top eight are English clubs, while no other nation has more than one.\nGermany, Spain and Portugal have a representative each in Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Sporting.\nNewcastle are the only English side to have missed out on a top-eight finish but go into the knockout phase play-offs as one of the seeded sides, having finished 12th, meaning they will face one of two unseeded teams in Qarabag or Monaco.\nSince the introduction of the league phase format last season, the Premier League has had a combined eight top-eight finishes. It's more than twice as many as any other league, with Spain's La Liga next on three.\nEngland set for fifth Champions League spot\nOne of the benefits of English teams performing so strongly in Europe is that the Premier League is now all but certain to repeat last season's feat of clinching a fifth Champions League spot by finishing in the top two of UEFA's coefficient table.\nWith five Premier League teams having gone straight into the Champions League last 16, and with all nine Premier League teams in Europe still alive in their respective competitions, England sits comfortably top of the table ahead of Germany.\nNewcastle were the beneficiaries last season, clinching their place in this campaign's Champions League with a fifth-placed Premier League finish. Now the door is open for another side to take advantage as English teams continue to perform strongly on the continent.\nWhen English teams can face each other\nWith Newcastle the only English club in the knockout phase play-offs, there is no prospect of an all-English play-off.\nThe earliest opportunity for two English sides to meet is in the last 16, when Newcastle could come up against Chelsea, although we will have to wait until the draw for the last 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals on February 27 for that.\nThe earliest opportunity for any other all-English meetings is in the quarter-finals, when Manchester City could meet Arsenal and Chelsea or Newcastle could meet Tottenham or Liverpool.\nExtra fixtures for Newcastle\nWhile five of the six Premier League sides will benefit from back-to-back free midweeks in February having gone straight into the last 16, Newcastle add two games to an already hectic schedule.\nEddie Howe's side will play their play-off first and second legs on February 17 or 18 and February 24 or 25, in between Premier League games away to Manchester City on February 21 and at home to Everton on February 28.\nArsenal can't face Bayern until the final\nArsenal's first-place finish gives them a number of advantages. As the No 1 seed, they can't play a seed higher than 15th in the last 16, a seed higher than seventh until the quarter-final, Liverpool or Tottenham until the semis, and they avoid Bayern Munich until the final.\nIn addition, they will benefit from a new rule this season that states that the top two league phase finishers will play their second legs at home throughout the whole competition.\nMan City could face Real Madrid… again\nMeetings between Manchester City and Real Madrid have become annual events in the Champions League. The two sides have faced each other in five consecutive seasons in the competition having already gone head-to-head in the league phase in December.\nNow they could meet again in the last 16.\nWith Real Madrid having slipped into the play-off places, they will face either City or Sporting if they can get through their play-off tie against either Benfica or Bodo/Glimt.\nAnother meeting between Real Madrid and Manchester City would be good news for the neutral, if their previous knockout meetings are anything to go by. The last five two-legged ties have featured 40 goals, with Madrid advancing on three occasions and City on two.\nMourinho's Benfica rescued but big clubs to bow out\nIncredible drama in Lisbon saw Jose Mourinho's Benfica clinch a play-off spot on goal difference thanks to a 98th-minute goal by goalkeeper Trubin against Real Madrid.\nRemarkably, Benfica may now face Mourinho's former club in the play-offs, with the goal simultaneously knocking Real Madrid down to ninth.\nBut despite accusations of lack of jeopardy for the big clubs following the introduction of the league phase format last season, there were still some big beasts to fall this time around.\nIn fact, there are six European Cup wins among the clubs eliminated, with past winners Ajax, Marseille and PSV Eindhoven among the 12 clubs to bow out.\nNapoli, Serie A winners last season, also went out having slumped to a 30th-placed league phase finish with their 3-2 loss to Chelsea, having won only two of their eight games under Antonio Conte.\nSpain's Villarreal, two-time Champions League semi-finalists, went out even more meekly, failing to win a single game and taking a solitary point from their eight games as they finished second-bottom in 35th place.\nWhen are the 2025/26 Champions League knockout stages?\nPlay-off draw: January 30, 2026\nKnockout play-offs: February 17-18 and 24-25, 2026\nRound of 16: March 10-11 and 17-18, 2026\nQuarter-finals: April 7-8 and 14-15, 2026\nSemi-finals: April 28-29 and May 5-6, 2026\nFinal: Saturday, May 30, 2026\nWhere is the Champions League final being held in 2026?\nThe 2025/26 Champions League final will take place in Budapest at the Puskas Arena on Saturday May 30.",
