They went even further at the European Championship in 2021, but lost to Italy on penalties in the Wembley final.\nA quarter-final loss to France in the 2022 World Cup followed. Southgate contemplated leaving the role after that tournament but stayed on, taking England to the final at Euro 2024, where they lost to Spain.\nSam Allardyce (2016)\nOverall record: Played one, won one, drawn none, lost none, scored one, conceded none, win ratio 100%.\nSam Allardyce became England boss in July 2016 but only managed for one game - a late 1-0 away win against Slovakia in a World Cup qualifier.\nHe only lasted 67 days before he was dismissed. It followed a newspaper investigation claiming he offered advice on how to \"get around\" rules on player transfers.\nAn FA statement said Allardyce's conduct \"was inappropriate\" and he was gone.\nRoy Hodgson (2012-2016)\nTournament record: Quarter-final at Euro 2012, group stage at 2014 World Cup, last 16 at Euro 2016.\nOverall record: Played 56, won 33, drawn 15, lost eight, scored 109, conceded 44, win ratio 58.9%.\nAfter Fabio Capello's resignation, Roy Hodgson was appointed just before Euro 2012 and he took England to the quarter-finals, where they lost on penalties to Italy.\nEngland remained unbeaten through qualifying for the 2014 World Cup, although they then failed to win a game in Brazil, suffering elimination after losing to Italy and Uruguay in their opening two matches.\nThe Three Lions won all 10 of their qualifying games to reach Euro 2016 but then suffered one of their most humiliating defeats, 2-1 to Iceland in the last 16, with Hodgson resigning after the game.\nFabio Capello (2008-2012)\nTournament record: Last 16 at 2010 World Cup, qualified for Euro 2012.\nOverall record: Played 42, won 28, drawn eight, lost six, scored 89, conceded 35, win ratio 66.7%.\nItalian Fabio Capello, who had successful spells in charge in AC Milan, Real Madrid, Roma and Juventus, became only the second non-British candidate to manage England when he was given the job in December 2007.\nEngland cruised through qualifying for the 2010 World Cup, securing their spot with two games to spare after eight successive victories.\nHowever, they struggled through as group runners-up, after drawing with the United States and Algeria, and were then beaten 4-1 by Germany in the last 16.\nEngland again impressed in qualifying for Euro 2012, but Capello resigned in the February before the finals, less than a week after John Terry had been stripped of the captaincy by the Football Association, with Capello disagreeing with the decision.\nSteve McClaren (2006-2007)\nTournament record: Did not qualify for Euro 2008.\nOverall record: Played 18, won nine, drawn four, lost five, scored 32, conceded 12, win ratio 50%.\nSteve McClaren was named as England manager in May 2006, having taken Middlesbrough to the Uefa Cup final, where they were then thrashed 4-0 by Sevilla.\nIn Euro 2008 qualifying, England struggled with draws against Macedonia and Israel, but only needed one point from their final two matches to qualify.\nHowever, McClaren's side lost 2-1 away to Russia and then 3-2 to Croatia on a wet November night at Wembley to miss out, with McClaren sacked the next day.\nSven-Goran Eriksson (2001-2006)\nTournament record: Quarter-final at 2002 World Cup, quarter-final at Euro 2004, quarter-final at 2006 World Cup.\nOverall record: Played 67, won 40, drawn 17, lost 10, scored 128, conceded 61, win ratio 59.7%.\nSweden's Sven-Goran Eriksson became the first non-British manager of the England team, taking over in January 2001.\nAn excellent 5-1 away win in Germany gave England a chance of qualifying for the 2002 World Cup, which they did thanks to a dramatic 2-2 draw with Greece, with David Beckham scoring a 93rd-minute equaliser.\nEriksson guided England to three tournaments, but they went out in the quarter-finals in 2002, Euro 2004 and then the 2006 World Cup.\nIn 2002, they were beaten 2-1 by Brazil and in the other two competitions were eliminated on penalties by Portugal. The 2006 World Cup was always going to be Eriksson's last in charge of England after he announced five months earlier that he would leave the job when the tournament finished.\nKevin Keegan (1999-2000)\nTournament record: Group stage at Euro 2000.\nOverall record: Played 18, won seven, drawn seven, lost four, scored 26, conceded 15, win ratio 38.9%.\nKevin Keegan was named England manager in February 1999 - they finished well behind Sweden in their qualification group for Euro 2000, but edged past Scotland 2-1 on aggregate in a two-legged play-off to qualify.\nEngland threw away a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 to Portugal in their opener and led twice before losing 3-2 to Romania, a result that eliminated Keegan's team in the group phase.\nIn their first qualifying match for the 2002 World Cup - also the last match at Wembley before its redevelopment - England lost 1-0 at home to Germany, with Keegan resigning immediately afterwards.\nGlenn Hoddle (1996-1999)\nTournament record: Last 16 at the 1998 World Cup.\nOverall record: Played 28, won 17, drawn six, lost five, scored 42, conceded 13, win ratio 60.7%.\nGlenn Hoddle took over after Euro 1996 and faced a tough qualifying group for the 1998 World Cup. England lost 1-0 at home to Italy, but fought back and an excellent 0-0 away draw in the final group match in Rome secured a place at France 1998.\nEngland finished second in their group - beating Tunisia, losing to Romania and defeating Colombia - setting up a last-16 match with Argentina. Michael Owen scored an excellent goal to put England 2-1 ahead, but Beckham was sent off as the game went to penalties, with Argentina winning 4-3.\nHoddle was sacked in February 1999 following comments he was reported to have made in a newspaper interview about people with disabilities.\nTerry Venables (1994-1996)\nTournament record: Semi-final at Euro 1996.\nOverall record: Played 24, won 11, drawn 11, lost two, scored 35, conceded 14, win ratio 45.8%.\nTerry Venables became England manager in January 1994 and did not have to play any qualifying matches for Euro 1996, with England as hosts.\nEngland began with a draw with Switzerland followed by a 2-0 win over Scotland and then an impressive 4-1 victory over the Netherlands. They edged past Spain on penalties in the quarter-finals and hopes were high of winning the tournament.\nBut England lost to Germany on spot kicks in the semi-finals, with Southgate missing the decisive penalty.\nGraham Taylor (1990-1993)\nTournament record: Group stage at Euro 1992, did not qualify for 1994 World Cup.\nOverall record: Played 38, won 18, drawn 13, lost seven, scored 62, conceded 32, win ratio 47.4%.\nGraham Taylor came in after the 1990 World Cup and England qualified for Euro 1992 as group winners, despite only scoring seven goals in six matches.\nBut England finished bottom of the group at the tournament, drawing with Denmark and France and losing to Sweden.\nThere followed a disastrous qualifying campaign for the 1994 World Cup, England losing to Norway and the Netherlands as they finished third to miss out on the tournament. In Taylor's last game in charge, England went a goal behind inside nine seconds against San Marino and, despite winning 7-1, the manager was sacked less than a week later.\nSir Bobby Robson (1982-1990)\nTournament record: Did not qualify for Euro 1984, quarter-final at 1986 World Cup, group stage at Euro 1988, fourth at 1990 World Cup.\nOverall record: Played 95, won 47, drawn 30, lost 18, scored 154, conceded 60, win ratio 49.5%.\nJust as Sir Alf Ramsey had done in the 1960s, Sir Bobby Robson became England manager following great success at Ipswich Town, with Robson getting the national job shortly after England were knocked out of the 1982 World Cup.\nIt was a tough start as England failed to qualify for Euro 1984, coming second behind group winners Denmark. But Robson's side reached the quarter-finals at the 1986 World Cup, losing 2-1 to Argentina, with Diego Maradona scoring twice, including his infamous 'Hand of God' goal, when he punched the ball into the net.\nEngland lost all three games at Euro 1988, but then, for the first time since 1966, reached the semi-finals of a major tournament, before losing on penalties to West Germany in the last four at Italia 90.\nRon Greenwood (1977-1982)\nTournament record: Did not qualify for 1978 World Cup, group stage of Euro 1980, second group stage of 1982 World Cup.\nOverall record: Played 55, won 33, drawn 12, lost 10, scored 93, conceded 40, win ratio 60%.\nRon Greenwood became England manager in August 1977 and despite two 2-0 wins in their final qualifiers, against Luxembourg and Italy, it was not enough to get the team to the 1978 World Cup, with England missing out on goal difference.\nEngland were unbeaten in qualifying for Euro 1980, where they finished third out of four teams in their group and failed to make the final.\nThey won all three matches in the first group phase at the 1982 World Cup, but two 0-0 draws in the second group phase, against West Germany and Spain, ended England's tournament and Greenwood's time in charge.\nDon Revie (1974-1977)\nTournament record: Did not qualify for Euro 1976.\nOverall record: Played 29, won 14, drawn eight, lost seven, scored 49, conceded 25, win ratio 48.3%.\nIn July 1974, Don Revie accepted the job of England manager after Sir Alf Ramsey had been sacked two months earlier.\nRevie, a hugely successful manager with Leeds United, failed to take England to Euro 1976, although only four nations qualified for the later stages. England needed to win their qualifying group, but a loss to Czechoslovakia and a draw with Portugal left them second.\nAfter four of six qualifying games for the 1978 World Cup, Revie announced, via an interview with the Daily Mail, that he was to leave the England role and had accepted a lucrative offer to become the manager of the United Arab Emirates' side.\nRank the managers\nUse the form below to rank your favourite England managers and share your results after you've completed it.",
