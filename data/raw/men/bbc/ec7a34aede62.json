Plus, not every fan will have the same experience as others on the same trip.\n\"There are some things that are small humiliations - being forced to enter a stadium four hours before kick off, put on a bus for hours with no toilet, having lip balm taken off you,\" Evain said.\n\"These things are rarely necessary, and are either a way for the police to exert a form of social control, or just completely outdated.\n\"Then we see things like pushing thousands of fans through gates no bigger than an apartment door - there are clearly policing strategies and infrastructural failures that are putting people's lives at risk.\n\"It just takes a few people to panic for things to go really wrong.\"\nHow do European away trips play out?\nBBC Sport asked fans who are experienced European away travellers to document how English clubs' trips unfolded during the last two Champions League and Europa League matchweeks, choosing a range of games in different places with varied approaches to policing and security measures.\nGemma Manns, 44, Chelsea fan in Naples, Italy: \"We avoided arriving in Naples until the afternoon of the game, based on Napoli fans' reputation for hostility.\n\"Hearing about the two young guys who were stabbed was horrible but not surprising.\n\"In the end we didn't see any trouble around the ground once we got to Naples, and the checks were all efficient.\n\"We were kept behind for over an hour after the game, and big groups of ultras stayed in their stand to try to intimidate us, so we felt at risk.\n\"Once we headed towards the designated buses after leaving the ground, the police completely disappeared, and we were packed on.\n\"The doors were open doors and we had no protection when it felt like we might need it - that was really sketchy.\"\nJude Aston, 21, Aston Villa fan in Istanbul, Turkey: \"I am a wheelchair user, and although we were warned by Villa about what conditions would be like, it was still worse than I expected.\n\"Once we were in the ground, us disabled supporters had to sit inside a cage in front of the away end. It had thick bars and some wiring that meant I could hardly see any of the goal at the end of the pitch in front of me.\n\"The cage was locked for most of the match, and I was the furthest one along - I couldn't get out to use the toilet until half time and I don't know what I would have done if there was a fire or something. I felt quite claustrophobic. It was unsettling.\n\"My personal assistant was separated from me, outside the cage, and I was worried about my phone dying in an emergency because I wasn't allowed to take a power bank in.\n\"I know in theory the cage is for our safety from home fans, getting to and from the stadium was efficient, and the police and stewards were very friendly, but it's 2026 - there has to be a better way than this.\"\nJane Boland, 61, Liverpool fan in Marseille, France: \"The riot police made entering and exiting the stadium really hard work. After being told to arrive at a designated meeting point more than four hours before kick off, we were held in overcrowded areas and made to wait for ages, sometimes with difficult or no toilet access.\n\"Leaving the stadium took over two hours after full time - by far the longest I've ever experienced. We were stood packed on stairwells for what felt like forever, and I had awful back pain afterwards. I understand that someone passed out and needed medical attention, and in retrospect I'm surprised it was only one.\n\"After two days of everything being great and nothing but friendly interaction between the two sets of fans, we were treated like cattle.\n\"I probably spent about £1000 on the trip, most of that in Marseille itself, so it smarts to be treated so badly as a 'customer'.\"\nSue Fox, 68, Spurs fan in Frankfurt, Germany: \"Transport was pretty efficient, overall. The meeting point was well organised and the police gave clear instructions.\n\"Then we took a train and they marched us through a very dark, muddy forest for about half an hour. When we arrived at the ground the gates were locked so we had to queue for an hour, and we were all packed very close together. It was uncomfortable and inappropriate.\n\"The men were able to go to the toilet in the bushes, but what were we supposed to do? It was nearly two hours without being able to go.\n\"Inside, the only women's toilet was in the home end, so we had to use the one there, which felt wrong and had the potential to be unsafe.\"\nDylan White, 21, Arsenal fan in Milan, Italy: \"On the way to the stadium we had to wait in big, tight queues for the designated metro for a long time, and then got packed on like sardines.\n\"Outside the ground, some extremely thorough ticket checks meant we were in very tight queues again, which got tighter and tighter because the entry gates were locked until 20 minutes before kick off.\n\"Finally they let us through and we had to walk up the enormous spirals to enter the ground, just about making it in time for kick off.\n\"We were out of the San Siro within about half an hour of full time, which we'd have definitely taken, and then people had to go and collect their portable chargers which had been confiscated on the way in.\n\"The police were brilliant with us but the way of getting fans to and then into the ground could do with a lot of work.\"\nLuke Stanley, 22, Man City fan in Bodo, Norway: \"The whole experience in and around the stadium was very straightforward and everyone was very friendly - entry was as easy as it could have possibly been.\n\"We hardly saw any police officers and the ones we did were helpful guiding us.\n\"There were only three toilets in the away end, and there wasn't much food available to buy, but overall treatment was very good.\"\n'It's an attack on dignity'\nA number of negatives experienced by fans - including inadequate facilities for fans with disabilities, restricted access to toilets, and travel bans - break Uefa's own rules and guidelines.\nSupporters with disabilities can face particularly grim scenarios.\n\"It is absolute fury and frustration [seeing the cages for wheelchairs users],\" says Owain Davies, chief executive of Level Playing Field, which campaigns on behalf of sports fans with disabilities.\n\"This is not an isolated incident. We've had stories of disabled fans being carried into stadiums, or changing on urine-soaked floors. In one of our surveys, 79% of fans said they had been made to sit in home sections on European trips, potentially opening them up to abuse.\n\"It really is heart-breaking to see this inequality in a huge tournament run by Uefa. It is an attack on dignity.\n\"Uefa published its accessibility guidelines 16 months ago - it is well within their gift to make clubs change things. What is missing is them enforcing it.\"\n'Games should be moved or teams thrown out'\nThe practice of regional police forces banning away fans from even attending some matches has become more common in recent years, particularly in France, Italy and the Netherlands.\nLast autumn Maccabi Tel-Aviv supporters were banned by West Midlands Police from attending their club's fixture against Aston Villa, a rare instance of a travel ban in England.\nIn some cases where fans are allowed to travel, they are banned from visiting the centre of the host city. This happened to Marseille fans in Bruges and Juventus fans in Nice for their trip to Monaco earlier this week, with the announcements made only days before the matches took place.\n\"Away travel bans are a good example of a country saying, 'sorry, we can't organise this game in an acceptable way',\" Evain said.\n\"If that is the case, there should be a response from the tournament organiser - whether it be moving the match, or not allowing the home club to compete.\"\nWhat does Uefa have to say?\nBBC Sport put questions about the issues raised by fans to Uefa.\nUefa said: \"We have, in recent years, considerably strengthened our partnerships with key European stakeholders responsible for safety and security.\n\"For the first time in the past decade, Uefa has recorded a measurable decline in the proportion of matches affected by incidents, which is an encouraging indicator of progress.\n\"[Since 2022] we have implemented stronger integrated operational planning and increased safety and security deployment at finals.\n\"The competent local authorities retain their legal powers and the final decision-making authority for safety and security measures at matches taking place on their territory.\"\nOn disability access, they said: \"Uefa is fully committed to ensuring a barrier‑free and inclusive matchday experience for disabled supporters.\n\"While we recognise that challenges persist and that improvements are needed in some contexts, accessibility remains an integral part of our commitment to safe, inclusive and welcoming football environments.\"\nRegarding travel bans, they said: \"Although things cannot change overnight, all stakeholders have expressed a strong commitment to close cooperation in the search for sustainable solutions.\"\n'Deeply concerned by lack of reforms'\nSupporters commonly told the BBC that issues with organisation and the authorities occurred more often than risks posed by rival fans.\nSo why is a downward spiral in standards seemingly happening?\n\"The political atmosphere at the moment in Europe doesn't really help when it comes to police accountability,\" Evain says.\n\"We see a number of governments wanting to show muscle, and football fans are an easy target.\n\"The British clubs are often in a better position compared to fans from other countries because there are very good UK police delegations who travel with fans to away matches, and the clubs are well organised with pre-match security visits and bring a high number of their own staff.\"\nThe final report into the 2022 fiasco, commissioned by Uefa and compiled by a panel of independent experts, found Uefa primarily at fault and made a series of recommendations to improve fan safety at matches, including Uefa taking more responsibility for security in their role as the event organiser.\n\"I am deeply concerned by the lack of tangible reforms since our report,\" says Clifford Stott, professor of social psychology at Keele University and one of the authors of the report.\n\"Uefa's response to our findings was limited to formal statements, with no substantive follow-ups or evidence of implemented changes.\n\"The safety and security of future events remain at risk.\"\nIllustration by Eleanor Shakespeare",
