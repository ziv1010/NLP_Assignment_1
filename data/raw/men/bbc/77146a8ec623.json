The computer says...\n- Published\nIt was another case of so close yet so far for England, but few can argue that Spain were the worthy winners of Euro 2024.\nUsing the Opta index - which grades players across a wide pool of metrics - the sports analytics company have formulated a team of the tournament using data to support the selections.\nTheir picks have come from a plethora of extra insights from a database that contains every touch made at Euro 2024.\nA ‘best XI’ will, of course, never manage to reach consensus among the mass of football opinion, but here’s a data-led interpretation to test your fancy…\nGiorgi Mamardashvili (Georgia)\nGeorgia managed to qualify for the knockout stages in what was their first ever major tournament and they owed plenty of thanks to their goalkeeper for that fact.\nMamardashvili's 21 saves were the joint-most ever by a goalkeeper in a group stage at the European Championship, along with Alexanders Kolinko in 2004.\nIndeed, based on the quality of shots on target faced using expected goals (xG), the Georgian prevented more goals than any other goalkeeper at Euro 2024 (+4.7 – eight goals conceded from 12.7 xG on target faced).\nJoshua Kimmich (Germany)\nKimmich was one of only two German outfielders, along with Antonio Rudiger, to play every minute for his side at Euro 2024. Indeed, he was a staple of the side in both presence and contribution, particularly on the attacking end.\nThe German right-back led all players for passes that broke that opposition’s defensive line (17), and only Lamine Yamal (16) created more chances from open play than the Bayern Munich man (15).\nManuel Akanji (Switzerland)\nThough the Manchester City defender’s tournament ended in penalty shootout heartbreak against England, Akanji had a fine campaign in general play, helping a sturdy Swiss side to the cusp of the semi-finals.\nAkanji was a fixture at the heart of Switzerland’s defence, while they were the team who trailed on the scoreboard for the lowest percentage of their match time at Euro 2024 (2.5% - only behind for 13 minutes).\nMarc Guehi (England)\nIn what was his first ever appearance at a major international tournament, Guehi showed himself to be one of the most reliable defenders at Euro 2024. Indeed, the Crystal Palace man was one of the best developments throughout the tournament for England, and looks set to be a key part of their plans going forward.\nAppearing in all but one of his team’s seven games in the competition, no England player won more aerial duels (12) than the defender, while he also led the team for blocks (6).\nMarc Cucurella (Spain)\nLeft-back Cucurella had been one of the question marks for Spain heading into Euro 2024, but he proved many doubters wrong by the end of it. Competitive in his defending and a contributor going forward, the Chelsea man did a fine job in taking up Jordi Alba’s mantle from previous editions.\nAs well as assisting the winning goal for Mikel Oyarzabal in the final, Cucurella had the most combined tackles and interceptions for Spain (20) across the tournament.\nToni Kroos (Germany)\nKroos didn’t get the send-off his career would have otherwise merited (at least not internationally), but there was little doubt he went out on top in terms of his individual performance.\nKroos was the distribution master of Euro 2024 and went on to break the record (since 1980) for most completed passes in a single group stage in the competition (324).\nNot content merely to play from side-to-side, however, the German midfielder also led all players in the tournament for line-breaking passes (141) by a significant margin.\nFabian Ruiz (Spain)\nAnother tournament, another Spanish midfielder to remember. Following in the long line of crafty manipulators, Ruiz put together a superbly complete tournament at the heart of Spain’s midfield.\nAlong with being directly involved in four goals at Euro 2024 (two goals, two assists), he recovered possession more times overall (46) and in the final third (14) than any other player.\nLamine Yamal (Spain):\nThe youngest player to ever appear in a World Cup or European Championship final (aged 17), Yamal wasn’t content just to be in the showpiece. A trademark weaving run and composure to find the pass helped break the deadlock for Spain, as he assisted Nico Williams’ opener on the night.\nYamal was directly involved in five goals overall at Euro 2024 (one goal, four assists), a joint-high alongside teammate Daniel Olmo. Indeed, his four assists were also the joint-most on record (since 1980) at a single edition of the European Championship.\nDani Olmo (Spain)\nOlmo may have started the tournament on the bench for Spain, but he ended it as one of the most influential players at Euro 2024. With his vibrant and direct style from the number 10 role, Spain’s already-dynamic attack got a lot harder to handle once Olmo came along.\nThe Leipzig man produced the joint-most goal involvements in the tournament (five – three goals, two assists), while his 14 completed dribbles were the most by a Spain player in a single edition of the European Championship since Lobo Carrasco in 1984 (16).\nNico Williams (Spain)\nThe other half of Spain’s dynamic wing duo, Williams was another of the breakout stars to announce himself on the world stage at Euro 2024. In fact, when we look back on this tournament in the years and decades to come, many will remember this Spain team for the productivity of the wingers above all.\nIn opening the scoring in the showpiece against England, Williams (22y 2d) became the youngest player to score in a European Championship final since 1968, when a 20-year-old Italian Pietro Anastasi did so versus Yugoslavia.\nCody Gakpo (Netherlands)\nIf you thought Gakpo’s performance at the 2022 World Cup was a flash in the pan, then Euro 2024 will have made you think again. The Liverpool man has scored six goals in 11 games across the two tournaments, with Kylian Mbappe (9) the only European player to net more\nGakpo also scored and assisted in the Netherlands’ win in the round of 16, becoming the first Dutch player to do so in a knockout stage game at the European Championship since Frank Rijkaard in the 1992 semi-final.",
