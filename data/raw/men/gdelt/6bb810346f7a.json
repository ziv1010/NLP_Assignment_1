  "body_text": "There is a long version and a short version of what Eddie Howe did away from Newcastle United this summer and, if you’re pressed for time, the short version goes like this: football.\nThe longer version is only slightly more intricate: went on holiday in Greece; watched his sons play football while talking transfers on the phone; went on holiday to Iceland, saw some geysers, also went to Iceland vs Slovakia because he discovered Martin Dubravka, Newcastle’s second-choice goalkeeper, was starting; had two days in a camper van in Northumberland.\nAdvertisement\nPremier League managers veer towards the obsessive, but even allowing for the pressures, stresses and demands on their attention, Howe sits on the more extreme wing of his profession. This is the man who spent the gap between stepping down as Bournemouth manager in August 2020 and joining Newcastle 15 months later juggling visits to other clubs and sorting “my training sessions into digital format”.\nAnd then there is the specific nature of Newcastle United.\nYou might suppose that after sweeping in to rescue them from relegation and then, in his first full season as their head coach, lifting them to a fourth-place in the Premier League and back into the Champions League after a 20-year absence, Howe deserves a little respite. But this is a ceaselessly restless club pushing ceaselessly for more and he dare not blink anyway.\nIn his interview with Alan Shearer in The Athletic last season, Howe spoke about “living in fear (…) You’ve got that fear of tomorrow. If you don’t prepare right, you don’t get training right, you don’t get your game plan right, and then it falls away”.\nIn those circumstances, it is difficult to imagine Howe sitting on the beach with a novel in one hand and a cocktail in the other. In those circumstances, it is difficult to imagine him ever sleeping.\nGO DEEPER\nAlan Shearer interviews Eddie Howe: 'I’m probably not as nice as I was'\nHe expanded on the theme at the back end of Newcastle’s recent pre-season tour in the United States, speaking at a Premier League event in Kerney, New Jersey, with the champions’ trophy displayed on a dais a few feet away (he did not glance at it). It had been a hectic trip; three competitive matches against Aston Villa, Chelsea and Brighton, lots of travel, lots of press conferences but not so much training, which is Howe’s natural habitat.\n“I don’t have one point of fear where I am looking at it thinking, ‘I fear this’,” he said. “It is more just the fear of not being successful, which is a bigger picture. Fear of not doing my job well. Fear of letting the players down, letting the people of Newcastle down. That drives me. It sounds negative, but it is not, it is hugely positive for me because it makes me work as hard as I do. I don’t want people to think, ‘Poor guy, he is constantly fearful!’. I’m not.”\nIt should be pointed out that Howe was chuckling as he spoke.\nAdvertisement\nSo it’s more like an internal stress? “Yes, there is definitely an internal stress,” he said. “There is definitely an, ‘I’m not in a comfortable place right now’.”\nHow many of us could exist like that, even allowing for the adulation and the financial rewards and all the rest of it? It is a single-minded kind of drive and it is a big part of what makes Howe so good.\n“I try to enjoy it,” he insisted. “I love coaching. I love being on the training pitch, I really do. If I have delivered a good session, that was a good day. I think, ‘We (the team) have got better today’. That is the most enjoyable part of the job.\n“The gamedays are intense and a reflection of your work. You enjoy a win for a small period of time then it is on to the next one. You are caught in that cycle all the time. You don’t have a chance to sit back and say, ‘Haven’t I done a great job?’, because there is always another day, always tomorrow and if you sit and relax even for a second, whatever part of the season you are in, you are going to fall behind.”\nA year ago, Howe went on a road trip in California with Vicki, his wife, and their family, chatting about new signings on the hire car’s loudspeaker as Harry, Rocky and Theo, his young sons, messed about in the back seats. There was a single moment of serenity when they reached Joshua Tree National Park — it’s out in the desert and there was no phone signal. “You are on the other side of the world, but it doesn’t stop,” he said back then.\nThis summer, it was more of the same.\nIn Greece, “we went to a hotel that had a football and tennis academy and I was watching my boys play football at the side of the pitch and walking away from the other parents, finding out what was going on”, he said. “I did play tennis and I had one game.” Against, wouldn’t you know it, a footballer, who happened to be staying at the same complex.\nAdvertisement\nIceland “was slightly different and out of the normal scene. It was somewhere my wife wanted to go to and we really enjoyed it. It is a volcanic island. Geysers – that was probably the highlight. All day on a coach to see landmarks. It is picturesque and beautiful. The science behind the volcanoes, too, is very interesting.\n“My eldest boy, Harry, was doing tests when he returned to school — chemistry, rocks — and it couldn’t have fitted better. So we were talking about igneous rock, metamorphic rocks. Did I remember it from school? No, I had to study it! But it fitted perfectly for the holiday we were on. It was relaxing and quieter. I didn’t get recognised. My phone was always there, so there wasn’t a total mental switch-off. But (we had) quiet, scenery — beautiful.”\nThere is a punchline, of course: “I didn’t know it, but we found out Iceland were playing at home and Martin Dubravka was (playing for) their opponent, so I got a chance to go and see how Martin was doing. Every holiday I go on, I naturally morph back to football. So when someone said, ‘Iceland are playing’, we had to go.” (Dubravka and company won the Euro 2024 qualifying group game, 2-1.)\nHowe’s third mini-break was “two days with my camper van with my boys. That was local to Newcastle. We went to Alnwick (Castle) and the new playground there. The funny story is I booked a campsite on the internet thinking it was close to Alnwick, to stay another night and come back. But it was an hour away!”\nThe whole summer “was good”, he said. “The only disappointment for me was that it went by in a flash. Time goes so quickly. You think, ‘Right, I’m going to have some really good time with my wife and kids’, and we did have two really nice holidays. But when they were over, it was back to work mentally for me and a lot of energy was expended on the transfer market even though it has only resulted in two players. To get those two players was a lot of work.”\nThis was certainly not said as a complaint, more a fair reflection of a window which Howe always predicted would be Newcastle’s most challenging post-takeover, their success in reaching the Champions League balanced by the need to enhance an accomplished team while constrained by financial fair play (FFP).\nThey have made two quality additions in first Sandro Tonali and then Harvey Barnes, the latter arriving from relegated Leicester City during Newcastle’s brief stint in Philadelphia, with a third on the way now that a £40million fee has been agreed for Southampton’s Tino Livramento.\nAdvertisement\nHowe’s time off, if it can be called that, was spent “following” Tonali’s transfer from AC Milan, “playing a part and willing it over the line, and that took a long time. And, obviously, I am part of the process to entice the players to come”. It has been “as intense, if not more intense” compared to a year ago, with less in the way of end-product.\nLiving on the Volcano is the title of Michael Calvin’s book about the strains of surviving in management, which devotes a chapter to Howe’s long spell at Bournemouth. It was put to Howe that trip to Iceland might stand him in good stead for the season ahead. On this occasion, he didn’t laugh at the reference.\n“The dynamic this year is very, very different from last year,” he said. “Last year, we were coming off the back of a relegation battle and expectations were quite low. I don’t think we had huge pressure on our shoulders. There is always pressure, but externally we didn’t have the huge pressure we have this year — not from Newcastle but just the general world.\n“Now Newcastle are expected to do certain things. I don’t think it changes our focus on where we are and how we play, but I think it is something the players will feel at certain times.\n“The most important thing is not to think about it, to be ourselves and be natural and not change too much from last year in terms of the inner dynamic. We want the team spirit, togetherness, the fight for every point and not to change our mentality, which was one of being on a journey to have a successful season. We need to keep that dynamic.”\nSaudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund is the wealthiest of owners — though FFP restricts its spending on the team – but Newcastle’s spirit has been built on players who were promoted to the Premier League under Rafa Benitez six years ago; scrapping against relegation and then, last season, beating more established clubs, they have carried an underdog identity. The bigger they grow, the harder that becomes to maintain.\n“People’s thoughts about us will change,” Howe said, “but our thoughts about ourselves can’t. Our thoughts about how good we are can’t change. We have it all to prove. We have to have that mentality in every training session — ‘We haven’t arrived’. We have to continue, week in, week out, to show how good we are. That is what I have been trying to impress on the players about this season. It is all about the hard work we delivered last year. If we work with the same intensity we will be fine.”\nSo, to boil down that message?\nAdvertisement\n“Don’t believe the hype,” Howe said. “Pressure is only a thing created by other people, not ourselves. We have to remain very humble and committed to success.”\nThe lads have arrived at Lincoln Financial Field ahead of tonight's game! 👋#PLSummerSeries pic.twitter.com/7bQzeraVpN\n— Newcastle United FC (@NUFC) July 23, 2023\nFor this reason, just as he wouldn’t countenance making the Champions League in public until it became a reality, he will not contemplate qualifying for it again next May.\n“The key thing is not to think about that,” he said. “The key thing (last season) was, ‘Can we beat Nottingham Forest’ (on the opening day)? If we beat them it is a great place to build a season. Now it is, ‘Can we beat Aston Villa (in their first 2023-24 fixture next Saturday)?’ It is not a given. The start we have is very, very difficult. That is a challenge we have to overcome.”\nYet the pressures are not completely external at this version of Newcastle. They cannot be, when their stated aims are, in due course, to win everything. They cannot be when Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of PIF and Newcastle’s chairman, says in the new Amazon documentary series We Are Newcastle United, “To be number one, that is the ambition.”\nWithin the club, Howe is admired, respected and valued, but living on the volcano is fraught.\n“The pressure I feel is from myself,” Howe said. “If Yasir could sit me down and have a talk, I would welcome that, and if he wanted to give me direct objectives, no problem, that wouldn’t create a fear in me. The fear comes from myself.\n“I know the expectations of the football club. I know his thoughts and aims and ambitions and I want to hit those targets for him. Ultimately, I have to look at myself. I can only do what I can do. That is what I mark myself against: what I’m giving. If I’m giving my all, that is all I can do.”\nAs he said in his introductory press conference in November 2021, Howe is “all in” at Newcastle.\nThat does not leave much room for holidays.\n(Top photo: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United via Getty Images)",
