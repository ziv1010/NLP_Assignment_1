  "body_text": "Manchester United are reportedly “stepping up their interest” in Crystal Palace talisman Adam Wharton as the latest twist in the tale for the Red Devils’ summer plans emerges.\nEyed by England’s Elite\nWharton has established himself as one of the best young midfielders in Europe since arriving at Selhurst Park in January 2024.\nThe 21-year-old technician went from plying his trade for Blackburn Rovers in the Championship to playing for England at the European Championship in the space of six months.\nBut Wharton refused to allow his meteoric rise to go to his head, demonstrating the same calculated and measured approach off the pitch as he has become famous for on it.\nThe Palace maestro possesses a wand of a left foot, capable of incisive first-time passes which split apart opposition defences. His in-game intelligence is equally impressive, as he is constantly positioned to help defend transitions, while also helping direct his teammates into their rightful roles.\nWharton is something of a footballing hybrid – a cross between an old-school English midfielder and a Spanish deep-lying playmaker. Indeed, his new teammate from La Liga, Yeremy Pino, is adamant he has the “quality” to play for the Spain national team.\nThere is an argument Wharton lacks the prototypical physicality of a Premier League No. 6, as Elliot Anderson or Carlos Baleba – two of his competitors for a move to Old Trafford this summer – possess. But a football match is largely decided by a player’s ability between his ears as much as his legs, and here Wharton is almost peerless.\nIt’s little wonder, therefore, that United are joined in the hunt for the England international by the rest of the country’s elite, with Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Tottenham Hotspur all eyeing him this summer.\nHowever, TEAMtalk reveals the Red Devils are now ready to make Wharton their “marquee signing” ahead of Anderson and Baleba, despite both being thought to have been bigger priorities at Old Trafford.\nRed-hot pursuit\nThe report states United are ramping up efforts to secure Wharton’s signature after making “informal approaches” to gauge his availability.\nVirtually all of the ‘Big Six’ have “registered their interest [and held] preliminary discussions with Wharton’s representatives” – but it is Liverpool who pose the biggest threat to United.\n“Liverpool, in particular, are understood to be aggressive suitors, with sources suggesting they have held fresh talks and that Wharton himself is open to a move to Merseyside. Some outlets even claim the Reds are frontrunners, potentially offering a long-term contract to secure his services,” TEAMtalk claims.\nChampions League football is understood to be key to Wharton’s decision-making, with the midfielder ready to test himself amongst Europe’s elite.\nIt will be essential that United’s resurgence under Carrick continues for the remainder of the season if the Red Devils are to trump their bitter rivals in the race for a player described, ironically, as the “next Michael Carrick“.\nFeatured image Eddie Keogh via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
