United submitted the deal sheet before the 11pm deadline and are on track to complete it.\nMarcel Sabitzer (back, centre) has landed in England ahead of joining Manchester United\nSabitzer (left) had earlier been pictured at Munich Airport ahead of a possible move to Manchester United\nSabitzer (centre) is thought to be keen to join United and has spoken to Erik ten Hag\nIt is understood United want to sign Sabitzer on loan and there is no option to buy.\nUnited are still keen on Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong and know a permanent signing for Sabitzer could impact their interest in the Holland international this summer.\nUnited know they face a race against the clock - with the window closing at 11pm - but have prepared a medical for Sabitzer in an effort to get the deal over the line.\nFootage broadcast by Sky in Germany showed the Austrian international at the airport ahead of his flight to Manchester.\nThe Red Devils are looking to strengthen their midfield after losing Eriksen to injury for the next three months and Austrian international Sabitzer has emerged as a target as the 28-year-old searches for more game time.\nMan United are hoping to conclude a deal for the Austrian international on transfer deadline day\nSabitzer, 28, has struggled to win a starting spot at Bayern under Julian Nagelsmann (R)\nSabitzer has found himself frozen out at the Allianz Arena this season and has not started a game since before the World Cup in early November - during their 2-0 Champions League win against Inter Milan.\nSabitzer would add quality to Erik ten Hag's midfield alongside the likes of Casemiro, Scott McTominay, Fred and Bruno Fernandes, but time is running out to get the deal done with just hours remaining until the transfer window slams shut.\nHe has played 54 times since arriving at Bayern in 2021, scoring twice, struggling to nail down regular first team football.\nJapan international Daichi Kamada is also an option with United making an enquiry to Frankfurt\nSabitzer started just eight times in the Bundesliga last season, coming off the bench 17 times - scoring once and providing one assist. He made a name for himself at RB Leipzig with some impressive displays between 2014 and 2021.\nHe made 229 outings with the Red Bull-owned outfit, netting 52 goals in the process before earning a £14m switch to Bayern.\nThe Red Devils have also made an enquiry to Eintracht Frankfurt about Japan international Daichi Kamada\nThe 26-year old midfielder made his debut for Japan against Germany in the World Cup and has scored 12 goals in the Bundesliga this season. Kamada is out of contract in the summer\nMeanwhile, United have been offered the chance to sign Atletico Madrid's Yannick Carrasco as they seek reinforcements in the wake of Eriksen's fitness blow.\nEriksen picked up an ankle injury after a forceful challenge from Andy Carroll during United's 3-1 win against Reading on Saturday, and has been ruled out for three months.\nThe Red Devils have also been offered the chance to sign Atletico Madrid's Yannick Carrasco\nTen Hag was quizzed on bringing in a replacement for Eriksen during his press conference on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Nottingham Forest, but admitted that it will be difficult to sign anyone before the transfer window closes.\n'On deadline day it's difficult. You can't make policy on such bad injuries, but we have players in the midfield department, good players. We have players who can fill the gap,' Ten Hag said.\n'I think you can never fill that (gap) because every player has his own characteristics and identity.\nChristian Eriksen has been ruled out for three months with an ankle injury in a blow to United\nErik ten Hag believes it will be difficult to sign a replacement for Eriksen on deadline day\n'Another player will always fill in in a different way, but it doesn't mean you have to be less successful.'\nEriksen and Carrasco are widely regarded as different players, with the former operating almost exclusively in central midfield alongside Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes since arriving at Old Trafford last summer, while Carrasco tends to play out wide.\nCarrasco has shown his versatility over the years by featuring in a more central role at times, though, and with United facing a busy second half of the season as they continue to play in four different competitions they could see him as a useful option to have in their squad.\nTen Hag has Fred and Scott McTominay to deputise for Eriksen, but may seek to bring in an extra body to help his side with their congested fixture list before Tuesday's 11pm deadline.\nMost watched Sport videos\n- Disgusting drink act caught on camera at ICC T20 World Cup\n- Tiffany Salmond dazzles in red bikini at Bondi Icebergs\n- Team GB Winter Olympics hero: Matt Weston wins skeleton gold\n- IOC President in tears after Ukrainian athlete is kicked out\n- NBA player makes long-awaited debut after battle with cancer\n- Team USA skier Breezy Johnson gets engaged after crash\n- Aussie snowboarder Scotty James shows off his dance moves\n- Has VAR broken football?
