This likely reflects Facebook’s shift away from news-sharing towards a focus on friends and family, as well as young people’s preference for more video-based apps like TikTok and YouTube.\nFrench-Algerian influencer, videographer, humorist and actor Riadh Belaiche, known as Just Riadh, poses in January during a photo session in Paris.\nPhoto: AFP\nTikTok now reaches 44 percent of 18-24-year-olds, and 20 percent get their news from the app, up five percent on last year. The biggest challenge for traditional news outlets is the falling number who go direct to their websites — just 22 percent, down 10 points since 2018 — rather than relying on social media links.\nIn his foreword, Reuters Institute director Rasmus Kleis Nielsen said this shift presented “a much more fundamental change” for the news industry than even the shift from paper to digital a generation ago. “Legacy media... now face a continual transformation of digital as generations come of age who eschew direct discovery for all but the most appealing brands, (and) have little interest in many conventional news offers oriented towards older generations’ habits, interests, and values,” he said.\nThese new audiences are aware of the risks of relying on algorithms, with only 30 percent thinking this is a good way to get a balanced diet of news — but that is still considered better than relying on journalists, who scored just 27 percent. None of this is good news for media firms reliant on subscribers and ad revenue.\nThe report found that 39 percent of subscribers had canceled or renegotiated subscriptions, though the overall share of people paying for news across 20 countries surveyed remained stable compared with last year at 17 percent.\n-\nYou might also like\n-\nTaiwan in Time: Echoes of Kipatauw: Those who remember\n2026-02-08Feb. 9 to Feb.15 Growing up in the 1980s, Pan Wen-li (潘文立) was repeatedly told in elementary school that his family could not have originated in Taipei. At the time, there was a lack of understanding of Pingpu (plains Indigenous) peoples, who had mostly assimilated to Han-Taiwanese society and had no official recognition. Students were required to list their ancestral homes then, and when Pan wrote “Taipei,” his teacher rejected it as impossible. His father, an elder of the Ketagalan-founded Independence Presbyterian Church in Xinbeitou (自立長老會新北投教會), insisted that their family had always lived in the area. But under postwar\nBy Han Cheung\n-\nNotes from Central Taiwan: Time for US to act on Taiwan defense budget\n2026-02-09In 2012, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) heroically seized residences belonging to the family of former president Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁), “purchased with the proceeds of alleged bribes,” the DOJ announcement said. “Alleged” was enough. Strangely, the DOJ remains unmoved by the any of the extensive illegality of the two Leninist authoritarian parties that held power in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan. If only Chen had run a one-party state that imprisoned, tortured and murdered its opponents, his property would have been completely safe from DOJ action.

The surrounding seas are rising at twice the global rate, extreme heat is becoming a serious problem in the country’s cities, and typhoons are growing less frequent (resulting in droughts) but more destructive. Yet young Taiwanese, according to interviewees who often discuss such issues with this demographic, seldom show signs of climate anxiety, despite their teachers being convinced that humanity has a great deal to worry about. Climate anxiety or eco-anxiety isn’t a psychological disorder recognized by diagnostic manuals, but that doesn’t make it any less real to those who have a chronic and\nBy Steven Crook\n-\nBook review: What Asian century?\n2026-02-12When Bilahari Kausikan defines Singapore as a small country “whose ability to influence events outside its borders is always limited but never completely non-existent,” we wish we could say the same about Taiwan. In a little book called The Myth of the Asian Century, he demolishes a number of preconceived ideas that shackle Taiwan’s self-confidence in its own agency. Kausikan worked for almost 40 years at Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reaching the position of permanent secretary: saying that he knows what he is talking about is an understatement. He was in charge of foreign affairs in a pivotal place in\nBy Julien Oeuillet\n-\nCopyright © 1999-2026 The Taipei Times. All rights reserved.",
