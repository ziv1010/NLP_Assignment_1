A move to Liverpool, forcing his way out of Newcastle United, railroading the club into selling him by going on strike. The question now, though, is at what cost?\nIt is a cautionary tale for any player thinking of following the Isak route to force a move away from a club that does not want to sell you when you have three years left on your contract.\nThe same can be said of Yoane Wissa, who also missed a chunk of pre-season and did not play in any of Brentford’s opening three games of the season because he was trying to force a move to Newcastle.\nWissa picked up a knee injury on international duty with DR Congo at the start of September and has not played a single minute for Newcastle following his £55million deadline-day move. His return date was pushed back by Howe last week and the 29-year-old is unlikely to make his debut until the end of this month or even the start of November.\nAt least Isak is not injured, but by going to such extreme lengths - and in his defence there was no chance Newcastle would have sold him this summer if he had not gone on strike - he has damaged more than his reputation on Tyneside.\nIsak is not really match fit, not goalscoring sharp, and is not yet ready to fully justify his British record £130m transfer fee. He still looks as though he is in the recovery stage and it is possible he might not be playing at full tilt for several weeks.\nGiven he has not had an injury, it shows the harm going on strike can do. Isak did less than two weeks of full training in pre-season at Newcastle before he decided to agitate to leave. He returned from a training camp in Austria in mid-July and downed tools, well aware of the fact the board were refusing to sanction his departure.\nHe trained alone, doing only basic fitness work, after the rest of the first-team squad had left the training ground until August 31. He refused to return to training and to play for Newcastle even when the season was about to start.\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot has admitted Isak is effectively doing his pre-season work in competitive games. He has scored just once in six appearances. That is far from ideal when you were signed, at huge cost, to become the final piece in a team that aspires to win the Premier League and the Champions League.\nIsak’s behaviour left a sour taste and you suspect he knows it. Asked about his acrimonious departure from Newcastle by a Swedish journalist before their 2-0 home defeat by Switzerland on Friday night, the 26-year-old squirmed in his seat, blinking rapidly. His body language screamed “I do not want to discuss or dwell on this” even more than his words.\nWhen asked if he had spoken to Newcastle manager Eddie Howe since he left, the look that accompanied a one-word answer of “no” was uncomfortable. There appeared to be some sadness there, unsurprising when they had once been so close.\nIt suggests the summer saga took its toll mentally on Isak far more than he was willing to admit at the time. He was thrilled to sign for Liverpool but he had been forced to extreme lengths to get his dream move.\nMore in Sports\nIt cannot have been pleasant, knowing the anger and sense of betrayal he had caused, not just among Newcastle fans but with his manager and teammates too.\nTelegraph Sport asked sources at Newcastle repeatedly what Isak’s mental state was over the summer. They said he was so determined to get his move that nothing else seemed to matter. In Isak’s opinion, the end would justify the means, but six weeks on the impact lingers.\nLiverpool will not be too worried. They knew Isak’s physical condition needed a lot of work when he arrived on deadline day. They knew they would have to be patient with him and felt the benefits of signing a world-class striker outweighed the negatives of signing one who had not played competitive football – or trained properly – since May.\nIsak is too good, too talented for his poor form to last. He will get stronger, fitter and sharper and the goals will come. Liverpool signed him with the next few years in mind, not the first few weeks of this season.\nBut what damage has Isak also done to Sweden’s World Cup qualifying campaign? Sweden manager Jon Dahl Tomasson went out of his way to defend and protect his star striker during the summer-long saga, but Isak’s lack of fitness and match sharpness is also hurting his country’s aspirations.\nHe played just 18 minutes in the September international games, failing to score in a defeat to Kosovo. He failed to score against Switzerland on Friday too, missing one excellent chance in another costly defeat. Sweden are bottom of their qualifying group, with one point from three games and fans called for Tomasson to resign during the Switzerland game.\nAs with Liverpool, Sweden still have time to get their campaign back on track. It is not just Isak’s fault that things have gone badly and they could still qualify for the World Cup, but they will need to beat Kosovo on Monday. Isak will presumably be in better form for the November international break but the Kosovo match is huge.\nThere were many within football who were alarmed by Isak and Wissa’s behaviour back in the summer. The prospect of players going on strike to force moves makes contracts seem meaningless. In going to such extreme lengths, Isak’s slow start and Wissa’s injury should serve as a warning to anyone thinking of doing the same.",
