  "body_text": "At the end of a game you’re judged by if you win or lose. How it happened is quickly forgotten.\nJoan García gives Barcelona a reason to believe heading into the new year\nThe goalkeeper continues to be a game winning difference maker for Barcelona\nBarcelona were undefeated in December across all competitions, and have clawed their way back to the top of the league table with a four-point lead over Real Madrid.\nAgainst Villarreal, they were not perfect, and frankly, their performances throughout the winning streak have been at times less than convincing.\nHaving a world class goalkeeper like Joan García, however, has made all the difference in helping his team overcome adversity when they’re not playing their best football.\nThe way Barcelona plays, you almost need a superman between the sticks. A talented attacking team like Villarreal will inevitably get behind the backline from time to time, especially with Hansi Flick’s high-risk, high-reward tactics.\nIf any other goalkeeper were playing for Barcelona, and they have two proven backups in Marc-André ter Stegen and Wojciech Szczęsny, several of those one-versus-one opportunities with the keeper go in. It’s a totally different game we’re talking about.\nInstead, the Barcelona players are given second chances to take control of the game. With Raphinha and Lamine Yamal on the field, they are going to make it count eventually, and reward their hero in goal for his efforts.\nSince García made his return from injury against Athletic Club on November 22, Barcelona have won every game except for the Chelsea defeat in the Champions League.\nBarcelona are better with him on the field, not just because of his miraculous saves, but because his presence spreads calm and confidence to his teammates.\nI’ll do my job, he seems to be saying, and you do yours. There’s no passing the buck.\nReal Madrid have had their struggles of late, but I wouldn’t write them off in La Liga. Barcelona will win it if they minimize unforced errors. Focus and team work will count for more than the individual talent at their disposal.\nWhether this Barcelona is build to make a run in the Champions League with their current tactics is another question.\nIf they do make it through the knockouts, I have a feeling it will be because of Joan García. The goalkeepers are often times the ones who are the MVPs of this competition.\nAll it takes is one big save to turn your team’s fortunes around in the big games.\nJoan García has a chance to introduce himself as one of the best in the world at his position, and perhaps as well, Barcelona’s most valuable player in their pursuit of silverware.",
