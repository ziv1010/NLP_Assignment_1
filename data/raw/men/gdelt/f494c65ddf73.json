Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nWhile capable of playing across the forward line, Maresca has primarily deployed Neto on the right-flank, supported by Estevao Willian, with summer signings Alejandro Garnacho and Jamie Gittens competing to start on the left.\nAt the moment, the 25-year-old is first-choice, but with every passing week there are growing calls for Estevao to start, with many tipping the teenager to become one the world’s best players.\nMoreover, Chelsea already have a £44m transfer agreed for highly-rated right-winger Geovany Quenda, who will join from Sporting Lisbon next summer.\nAs a result, Neto’s place in the Blues squad may soon come under threat, which could prompt the club to sell him on if interest in the player rematerialises.\nMore Trending\nChelsea have form for this, signing England star Noni Madueke in 2023 with the view that he would be the future of the team, before selling him last summer to Arsenal to make way for Estevao, Garnacho and Gittens.\nBut this would be a surprising decision given Maresca’s fondness for the player, who is under contract until 2031, and he is not the only fan of the Portuguese.\nSpeaking ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League win over Benfica, legendary Blues manager Jose Mourinho said: ‘Pedro Neto is one of the best wingers in the world.\n‘Roberto [Martinez] at the [Portugal] national team is very privileged because he has not only Pedro Neto but four or five players of that profile. What can I say? I can wish him the very best, injury-free career.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Noni Madueke mocked by two ex-Chelsea team-mates during Arsenal draw\nMORE: Rio Ferdinand sends message to Man Utd star who was distraught after Crystal Palace win\nMORE: Why Arsenal will be hit with huge FA fine after Chelsea draw",
