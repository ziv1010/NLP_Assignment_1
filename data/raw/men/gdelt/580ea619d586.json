The hotel where Al-Nassr FC were booked to stay during their time in Goa even reserved the presidential suite and the room next to it for security reasons, just in case Cristiano Ronaldo had a change of heart and decided to make the trip to India.Ronaldo, a five-time Ballon d’Or award winner and ranked among the greatest footballers of all time, missed the previous two AFC Champions League Two games, home and away, and will now sit out of the group-stage clash against FC Goa at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Oct 22. The Portugal superstar’s absence left many disappointed. Outstation fans have cancelled their trip and some who had booked higher-priced tickets even put it for sale at a discount. The craze for “complimentary passes” hasn’t died down, though it’s no longer the most sought-after piece of paper, with tickets priced from Rs 2,500 for the lower stands behind the goals, to Rs 25,000 for the VIP enclosure.“Of course, we all would have enjoyed if Ronaldo had come and, as a footballer, you always want to play against the greats of all time, but when the game starts, I think it becomes more of a story to tell later, that I played against Ronaldo,” said FC Goa captain Sandesh Jhingan.\nEnd of Article\nFollow Us On Social Media",
