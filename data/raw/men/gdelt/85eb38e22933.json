The Reggae Girlz held on for their first Women’s World Cup point amid heavy rain at Sydney Football Stadium.\nThe French must now regroup for their meeting with fellow Group F favourites Brazil on 29 July.\nFrance came close to scoring in the first half when Kadidiatou Diani had a near-post drive scooped away by Becky Spencer before a deflected effort which flashed past the post. Diani twice headed narrowly wide before hitting the crossbar and post late in the second half, but Jamaica were roared on to a draw by the locals and neutrals as the latest smaller nation to impress at these finals.\nFrench optimism dampened in Sydney rain\nHaving fallen at the quarter-finals in the past three World Cups, this has been pegged as the tournament for France to go deeper.\nAfter the tempestuous Corinne Diacre reign – ended in March when Wendie Renard and several team mates threatened not to play at the World Cup at all – good feeling had returned around the French camp under new manager Herve Renard.\nHerve Renard, who masterminded Saudi Arabia’s extraordinary win over Argentina at the men’s World Cup, has brought in an attacking 4-3-3 formation to bring the best out of his immensely talented squad. But they were blunted in Sydney by a Jamaica defence which pressed hard and well, never allowing Diani or Eugenie le Sommer enough time or space to work their magic.\nRising star Selma Bacha – winner of four Champions League titles with Lyon by the age of 22 and very impressive at Euro 2022 – missed this game with injury but should return for the key meeting with Brazil. France cannot get her back soon enough.\nJamaica joy punctured by Shaw red\nIn attack, Jamaica had one tactic – hit main striker Shaw as soon as possible. Given the talents of “Bunny”, who scored 31 goals in 30 games last season for Manchester City, their approach was not surprising.\nHer presence alone was enough to stop France throwing too much forward, and a 35-yard free-kick fired inches wide in the first half showed her skills. But she was also booked for a late tackle on Sakina Karchaoui in the first half, before a clumsy challenge on Wendie Renard in the frantic dying seconds saw her sent off.\nHaving already gone better than their World Cup debut in 2019 – where they lost all three matches – Jamaica know victory over Panama in their next match will give them genuine hope of a last-16 place. But losing their captain, top scorer and talisman is a tough blow to take.\n(BBC)\nLatest News\nLandslide Early Warnings issued to the Districts of Kandy and Nuwara Eliya extended\nThe landslide early warnings issued to the Districts of Kandy and Nuwara Eliya by the Landslide Early Warning Center of the National Building Research Organisation [NBRO] have been extended until 0600 hrs on the 14th of February 2026.\nAccordingly,\nThe Level II [AMBER] landslide early warnings issued to the Divisional Secretaries Divisions and surrounding areas of Walapane and Nildandahinna in the Nuwara Eliya district and\nthe Level I [YELLOW] landslide early warnings issued to the Divisional Secretaries Division and surrounding areas of Pathahewaheta in the Kandy district have been extended till 0600AM on Saturday [14]\nLatest News\nAryansh Sharma, Sohaib Khan power UAE to thrilling win over Canada\nAryansh Sharma and Sohaib Khan fired Unitrd Arab Emirates to a hard-fought five wicket win against Canada in Delhi. It was UAE’s second win in the competition, after they beat Namibia in the 2022 edition of the T20 World Cup. Aryansh and Sohaib did justice to Junaid Siddique’s five-wicket haul which restricted Canada to 150 for 7.\nUAE were themselves down in the dumps at 66 for 4, before this pair added 84 of the 85 runs required at that stage. With eight needed from the last over, Aryansh struck a six off the first ball and then took a single. Sohaib top edged Jaskarandeep Singh to fall with UAE needing one off three balls before Muhammad Arfan scored the winning run.\nUAE however were nowhere near a win when left-arm spinner Saad Bin Zafar took 3 for 14 to put Canada a strong position by the 13th over of the chase.\nKaleem Sana had the UAE captain Muhammad Waseem caught at midwicket for four in the third over. Zafar then removed the other dangerman, Alishan Sharafu, in the seventh over to give Canada the early advantage. Sharafu couldn’t clear Nicholas Kirton at covers and fell for five.\nZafar was stingy and kept his subtle change of pace going, removing Mayank Kumar for four in the 11th over. Kumar’s intention to belt him down the ground only found Sana at long-on. In his next over, Zafar had Harshit Kaushik cagut at deep midwicket.\nUAE had their backs to the wall as they needed 56 runs in the last four overs. Sohaib hit Dilon Heyliger for two sixes and a four. He first smoked him over midwicket for a maximum, followed by a lofted shot over mid-off for four, and a six straight into the sight-screen. After the 17-run over, Sohaib then got stuck into Jaskarandeep with a four and a six off the first two balls of the 18th over.\nHe then cracked two more fours to start Sana’s penultimate over, before the left-arm quick’s beamer hurt wicketkeeper Shreyas Movva. Another top edged boundary and a straight hit for two got Sohaib to his half-century off just 28 balls, leaving UAE eight to win from the last over.\nThe 33-year-old Siddique began UAE’s push when he had Dilpreet Bajwa caught at mid-off in the second over for 11. Yuvraj Samra mistimed a pull to mid-on in Siddique’s next over. When Muhammad Jawadullah had Nicholas Kirton caught behind in the sixth over, UAE gained a stronghold in the game.\nSiddique returned with three more wickets in his late spell. He started off with Harsh Thaker’s wicket after he had reached his half-century. Siddique used the slower delivery to outfox a set Thaker. He removed Movva and Zafar in the last over, completing his maiden five-wicket haul in T20Is.\nDhaliwal, who made a half-century against South Africa in Canada’s previous game, struck four boundaries in his 34 off 28 balls. His run-out was unfortunate when Dhaliwal’s bat got stuck just outside the crease. Thaker later fell on exactly 50 off 41 balls, with two fours and three sixes, though Thaker held together the UAE innings till the 18th over.\nBrief scores:\nUnited Arab Emirates 154 for 5 in 19.4 overs (Arynash Sharma 74*, Sohaib Khan 51; Kaleem Sana 1-29, Jaskaran Singh 1-45, Saad Bin Zafar 3-14) beat Canada 150 for 7 in 20 overs (Dilpreet Bajwa 11,Navneet Dhaliwal 34, Harsh Thaker 50, Shreya Movva 21; Junaid Siddique 5-35, Muhammad Jawadullah 1-16) by five wickets\n[Cricinfo]\nLatest News\nMuzarabani, Bennett orchestrate famous Zimbabwe win\nZimbabwe remain undefeated against Australia in T20 World Cups after a career-best bowling display from Blessing Muzabarani and a gutsy 64 not out from Brian Bennett helped orchestrate a stunning 23-run win in Colombo and throw group B into chaos.\nMuzarabani took 4 for 17 from four overs, ripping out the top order alongside Brad Evans in the powerplay who also took 3 for 23, as Australia never really looked close to chasing Zimbabwe’s impressive 169 for 2 on a slow pitch that had been set up by even contributions from the top four.\nMatt Renshaw’s 65 off 44 gave Australia hope but on top of the polished display with bat and ball they also fielded superbly to restrict Australia and threaten their Super Eight hopes.\nBrief scores:\nZimbabwe 169 for 2 in 20 overs (Brian Bennett 64*, Tadiwanashe Marumani 35, Ryan Burl 35, Sikandar Raza 25*; Marcus Stoinis 1-17, Cameron Green 1-06) beat Australia 146 in 19.3 overs (Travis Head 17, Glenn Maxwell 31, Matt Renshaw 65; Blessing Muzarabani 4-17, Brad Evans 3-23, Wellington Masakadza 1-36, Ryan Burl 1-09) by 23 runs\n[Cricinfo]\n-\nFeatures6 days ago\nMy experience in turning around the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka (MBSL) – Episode 3\n-\nBusiness7 days ago\nZone24x7 enters 2026 with strong momentum, reinforcing its role as an enterprise AI and automation partner\n-\nBusiness6 days ago\nRemotely conducted Business Forum in Paris attracts reputed French companies\n-\nBusiness6 days ago\nFour runs, a thousand dreams: How a small-town school bowled its way into the record books\n-\nBusiness6 days ago\nComBank and Hayleys Mobility redefine sustainable mobility with flexible leasing solutions\n-\nBusiness3 days ago\nAutodoc 360 relocates to reinforce commitment to premium auto care\n-\nMidweek Review3 days ago\nA question of national pride\n-\nBusiness7 days ago\nHNB recognized among Top 10 Best Employers of 2025 at the EFC National Best Employer Awards",
