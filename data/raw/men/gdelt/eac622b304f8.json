A new starting striker will be signed, as will a winger who can potentially serve as an upgrade on Gabriel Martinelli on the left side.\nArsenal and Mikel Arteta’s dream target for the flanks is Nico Williams of Athletic Bilbao. The Spain international, 22, can be signed via a €58m / £49m release clause.\nHowever, recent comments by Williams appear to suggest his future for next season at least will continue to remain in Bilbao.\n“We have the goal of winning the Europa League and, next year, to crush the Champions League,” declared Williams.\nWith Athletic on course to qualify for the Champions League via league position, the club can satisfy his European demands.\nAs such, Arsenal may have to explore alternatives and according to reports from BILD and Football Insider, that’s exactly what they’ve done.\nBILD chief Christian Falk revealed Arsenal have firmed up their interest in Bayern Munich’s Kingsley Coman.\nThe 12-time league winner (two with PSG, two with Juventus, eight with Bayern) has the green light to leave Bayern this summer.\n“The club (Bayern) are hoping for a coup similar to that of last summer’s move for Michael Olise,” explained Falk.\n“The bosses want fresh blood for the squad. That’s why Kingsley Coman is to be sold.\n“In the meantime, Arsenal’s interest has also become more concrete.”\nThat tallies with a subsequent update from FI who claimed Arsenal are in ‘pole position’ to sign the Frenchman.\nTottenham too have shown interest in Coman, while a money-spinning switch to the Saudi Pro League remains an option.\nHowever, the report claimed Arsenal are ‘ahead of Tottenham’ in the race, with Ange Postecoglou’s side now ‘unlikely to beat their arch-rivals to his signature.’\nHow much will Kingsley Coman cost?\nOne of the reasons Bayern are willing to let Coman go is his high salary, believed to be around £275,000-a-week.\nWhether Arsenal would be willing to match those demands or whether Coman would be asked to accept a pay-cut is not yet clear.\nIn any case, what is clear is the transfer fee in play is relatively modest, with Ben Jacobs telling TEAMtalk a deal can be struck for just €35m / £30m.\nComan was valued at double that amount (€70m) one year ago. The drop in valuation reflects Bayern’s determination to shed his high salary, along with the fact he’ll be entering the last two years of his deal come the summer.\nWithout being a guaranteed starter Coman has featured 37 times for Bayern this season, notching seven goals and four assists.\nThe right-footer’s primary position this term has been the left wing, meaning he would serve as a direct alternative to Williams.\nLatest Arsenal news – Zubimendi, Gyokeres, Rice\n🔴⚪️ Arsenal to finalise €60m Zubimendi signing after Real Madrid plan monumental Man City raid instead\n🔴⚪️ ‘I like…’ – Gyokeres responds as Arsenal, Chelsea prepare for furious transfer battle\n🔴⚪️ ‘Outstanding’ Arsenal ace Rice would rather play for Man Utd, suggests Ferdinand",
