I don't think about it. It's just we have to win football games and let's see what that means in the end.\"\nVilla close on Champions League spot\nAston Villa last played in Europe's top club competition in 1983 -- a year after they beat Bayern Munich in the final.\nNow they are close to qualifying for next year's Champions League with just three Premier League matches remaining.\nUnai Emery, who has pedigree in European competition with Sevilla and Villarreal, was unfazed by his side's 2-2 draw with Chelsea on Saturday even after they squandered a 2-0 lead, preferring to focus on their consistency.\nIt has turned out to be a valuable point for Villa after fifth-placed Tottenham lost to Arsenal on Sunday.\nVilla are seven points ahead of Spurs with league games to come against Brighton, Liverpool and Crystal Palace.\nTottenham have two games in hand but a daunting fixture list including games against Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City.\nCan Burnley escape the drop?\nVincent Kompany's Burnley looked dead and buried just weeks ago -- certain to head back down to the Championship after just one season in the Premier League.\nBut they have earned the right to dream, with just one defeat in their past eight matches.\nZeki Amdouni scored a late penalty as Burnley drew 1-1 with faltering Manchester United on Saturday to earn one more precious point.\nThey are still second from bottom of the table but just two points behind Nottingham Forest, who are just outside the drop zone.\nMuch could depend on whether Forest have any success in their appeal against a four-point deduction for breaching Premier League financial rules, with a decision expected in the coming days.\n© 2024 AFP",
