That is the question.\nManchester United look increasingly likely to agree a deal with Paris Saint-Germain to sign Manuel Ugarte after a protracted pursuit of the 23-year-old midfielder this summer. However, doubts persist over whether the Uruguayan international is the ideal candidate for a much-needed upgrade in the club’s engine room, or simply just the best of a bad bunch from the options on the market.\nThe Peoples Person have dug a little deeper into what Ugarte’s signing could mean for United moving forward to answer this difficult question. Let’s get into it.\nA Scarcity of Midfielders\nIf there was one position severely lacking in viable options to buy this summer across Europe, it would be central midfield.\nArsenal are currently locked in negotiations for Mikel Merino – a 28-year-old midfielder with only twelve months left on his contract who endured a dismal year in England with Newcastle – but have, so far, been unable to strike a deal with Real Sociedad.\nLiverpool publicly failed in their pursuit of Merino’s teammate, Martin Zubimendi, with the Spanish international rejecting a move to Anfield and the Merseyside club not considering any alternatives as worth pursuing.\nManchester City look set to re-sign Ilkay Gundogan from Barcelona a year after the German international left the club. The midfielders signed last summer in his stead – Matteo Kovacic and, in particular, Matheus Nunes – are yet to fully settle at the Etihad and will likely play second fiddle to the 33-year-old should he return.\nTottenham agreed a part exchange deal worth up to £40 million to sign Archie Gray from Leeds – a fantastic talent but still an 18-year-old with only one year of Championship experience – while Aston Villa paid Everton £50 million for Amadou Onana – a physical monster but a player who Sean Dyche relegated to the bench last season, despite his side being in the midst of a relegation battle.\nIt’s clear, therefore, that midfielders are a scarce resource this summer with England’s biggest clubs either choosing cheaper options or paying over the odds for players they hope develop to justify their price tag in time.\nWhich is why United’s pursuit of Ugarte makes sense – there simply aren’t any better alternatives.\nThe Alternatives to Ugarte\nHaving established Ugarte as the primary target in midfield, United were also reported to be keeping tabs on Youssouf Fofana (AS Monaco), Sander Berge (Burnley) and Zubimendi as potential back-up options should PSG’s demands for the Uruguayan prove excessive. And a move for Sofyan Amrabat, whose loan deal at Old Trafford expired in June with the Moroccan returning to AFC Fiorentina, was also reported to be under consideration.\nZubimendi’s profile as a holding midfielder made him an attractive target, but the Spaniard’s desire to remain at Real Sociedad produced a public embarrassment for Liverpool and United were unlikely to want to suffer a similar indignity to their bitter rivals.\nHowever, moves for any one of Fofana, Berge or Amrabat were fraught with issues and it was their availability off the pitch which represented their most attractive quality, not their ability on it.\nFofana is the best footballer of the three, as proved by his move to AC Milan last week, but he is most effective deployed as a number eight, rather than the number six United are actively looking for. This issue applied to Berge as well, but the Norwegian international was confirmed to have agreed a deal to sign for Fulham last night, ruling out a switch to Old Trafford.\nAmrabat is a holding midfielder but, within the context of the Premier League, this is a fallacy. The Moroccan international, who turns 28 tomorrow, resembled a player moving in treacle at times last season and is wholly unsuited to the physical rigours of English football.\nThe Actual First Choice Option\nIn fact, the only outstanding candidate United were linked to this summer as an alternative to Ugarte was the player PSG ended up signing to replace the Uruguayan – Benfica starlet Joao Neves.\nUnited were reported to have tabled multiple bids for the 19-year-old at the beginning of the window but were met with firm resistance from Benfica. The Portuguese giants are notoriously difficult negotiators and were demanding Neves’ release clause – in excess of £100 million – be met in order to sanction their academy graduate’s departure.\nNeves is considered a generational talent, having already established himself as a key player for Benfica last season, and was selected to the Portuguese squad for the European Championship in Germany. He combines excellent defensive qualities with elite technical ones and is capable of playing a variety of roles in midfield.\nNeves would have constituted a statement signing for United, in a similar vein to the club’s capture of Leny Yoro, but the price was deemed too costly for the Red Devils given the need for upgrades elsewhere. Which is why the fee PSG were eventually able to broker for the 19-year-old – worth a potential €70 million with Renato Sanches going on loan in the opposite direction – would have been a shock to executives at Old Trafford.\nHowever, the Benfica midfielder is represented by Jorge Mendes and the Portuguese super agent’s influence at Benfica and PSG is extensive. He’s described as having played a “crucial role” in Neves relocating to the French capital and it’s likely PSG were able to sign the midfielder at a price unavailable to other prospective suitors.\nFrom this perspective, the fact United designated Ugarte as their first choice after a pursuit of Neves proved unsuccessful, and have persevered in this interest, despite PSG’s excessive demands, due to the weaknesses of the back-up options, makes sense.\nUgarte’s Strengths and Weaknesses\nFundamentally, Ugarte is a ball winner.\nThe Uruguayan international ranks amongst Europe’s best in relation to defensive metrics. He sits in the 99th percentile for tackles, 97th percentile for ball recoveries and the 95th percentile for interceptions. In the 2022/23 season, he produced the most tackles in Liga Portugal with 98. In 2023/24, he topped Ligue 1 with 121 tackles.\nUgarte resembles something of a heat-seeking missile for the ball; he will relentlessly pursue the opposition and seek to force transitions in midfield. The 23-year-old is a tireless presser with excellent stamina, capable of constantly applying pressure across the full ninety minutes.\nFor a team whose manager has spoken of his vision for them to become the “best transition team in the world“, this style of aggressive ball-winning appears ideal.\nYet, as The Athletic observes, Ugarte’s desire to win the ball means he often leaves “space behind him for teams to exploit.” As the deepest player in Ten Hag’s midfield unit, with Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes the first-choice options further forward, this may cause issues with gaps in the middle of the pitch similar to the ones which plagued United last season.\nUgarte is also extremely safe with the ball, ranking highly for passing accuracy, but almost to a fault. The 23-year-old is unadventurous in possession, ranking below the Ligue 1 average for progressive passes and progressive carries, despite PSG being by far the most dominant team in France. And it’s these limitations on the ball which meant the Uruguayan “struggled to meet the demands that Luis Enrique place[s] on his holding midfielders” and led the Parisian club to pursue the more technically proficient Neves as a replacement.\nFurthermore, despite possessing a 6′ frame, Ugarte is not a physically dominant number six in the mould of Rodri or Declan Rice – two examples of the Premier League’s best holding midfielders. The Athletic reveals the transition from Portugal to France saw the 23-year-old’s “tackle efficiency and interception volume” decrease, while his aerial duel success rate fell from 63% to 54%.\nThese drops are likely to be replicated again in the even more physical Premier League.\nThe Long-Term Answer in Midfield?\nIs Ugarte the definitive answer in United’s midfield then? No is the simple answer, but he does constitute a viable solution in the short-term and a strong asset in the long-term.\nUnited are unlikely to be able to bring in a number six who suits the press-heavy style Ten Hag is seeking to cultivate this season at Old Trafford as much as Ugarte does without breaking their already stretched transfer budget.\nThe fact that reports now indicate PSG are willing to agree to a loan deal with an obligation to buy means United could sign the midfielder this summer, but not have to factor in his cost until next summer. The Ligue 1 champions are also believed to be willing to reduce their €70 million demands for Ugarte with growing confidence at Old Trafford that a compromise on price can be reached.\nFrom the perspective of a limited budget, therefore, a loan deal for Ugarte is likely to be the best option United are able to agree. And there are a host of reasons why the Uruguayan’s profile is an attractive one for the club’s executives.\nAt 23, Ugarte is the ideal age United are seeking to prioritise moving forward, as opposed to costly deals for players coming towards the end of their prime. His wage packet in Paris is believed to be around £100,000-a-week – a third of Casemiro’s, by comparison – and he possesses a wealth of experience, at both Champions League and international level. He is thought to be a positive influence in the dressing room and is extremely keen on a move to Old Trafford, actively seeking to ensure the transfer happens having already agreed personal terms with United.\nYoung players on cheap wages who dream of playing for the Red Devils have been an underutilised target at Old Trafford over the last decade, but the signings of Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee suggest INEOS – who gained full control of the football operation at United in February – will be prioritising this profile moving forward.\nThe issues surrounding Ugarte’s ability to be progressive with the ball, as well as the potential impact the physicality of the Premier League may produce on his defensive numbers, are valid, but his ability to consistently win the ball is unquestionable and it will be a potent attribute in Ten Hag’s press-heavy system.\nAnd a player able to consistently find his teammates with the ball will also be valued, even if it’s with safe passes, given Casemiro looks set to remain at Old Trafford for another season, with interest from the Saudi Pro League having failed to materialise. The Brazilian looked improved in the Community Shield loss to City and the opening day win over Fulham, but his struggles with mobility and ball retention persist.\nUgarte is a player who can be deployed instead of Casemiro in the number six role or, against bigger teams for example, could line up next to the 32-year-old to buttress United’s midfield. This tactical versatility will be a welcome addition given Casemiro is the only viable defensive midfielder at Old Trafford at present and Ugarte offers strength in areas the Brazilian is weak.\nConclusion\nUgarte will prove an upgrade to United’s existing midfield options but he is not the long-term answer at defensive midfield for the club.\nInstead, the Uruguayan should be viewed as a strong squad option, capable of providing solutions in the number six or number eight positions, depending on the opposition. He is also a player far more likely to shine in a system predicated on pressing, as Ten Hag is seeking to implement, than passing, as Enrique established in Paris last season.\nIf United were to sign Ugarte this summer, without having to pay for him until next year, they could then look to sell Casemiro and sign a technically strong holding midfielder to replace the Brazilian next summer. One such candidate could be Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton.\nThe 20-year-old’s ascension over the last six months, from a midfielder in the Championship with Blackburn to being selected for the England squad for the Euro 2024 after an impressive streak of performances for Crystal Palace in the Premier League, has been nothing short of remarkable.\nWharton is a physically strong midfielder with a wand of a left foot and good mobility. He is as comfortable receiving the ball on the half-turn from defence as he is driving with it through the opposition midfield. His first-time passing is proficient and he is capable of playing short or long, depending on the options available.\nWharton is a candidate to be the long-term answer in the number six role at Old Trafford because he is strong in the areas Ugarte is weak, without sacrificing on the physical or defensive side of the game. However, having someone like Ugarte in the squad already would help the 20-year-old to acclimate as the manager could rely on a capable midfielder to play with Wharton, or instead of, depending on what the circumstances dictate.\nFurthermore, there is likely to be considerable competition for Wharton from England and Europe’s elite clubs. If United are to be able to compete to sign the Crystal Palace starlet, they will be able to do so far more easily with the offer of Champions League football next year. And without a signing like Ugarte, the prospect of top four qualification becomes far less likely for Ten Hag’s side this season.\nTherefore, Ugarte should be signed this transfer window as a short-term solution in midfield as long as another defensive midfielder is signed next summer to be the long-term answer.",
