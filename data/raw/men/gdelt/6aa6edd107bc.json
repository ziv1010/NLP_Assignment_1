The last six teams promoted to the Championship were all relegated immediately but Sunderland, last season's play-off winners, start Saturday's match level on points with Chelsea.\nRegis Le Bris has nailed it so far this season and the Black Cats sit in seventh place. Their success has been built on defensive foundations; only Arsenal have conceded fewer goals.\nOperating either side of an impressive back line that has in its ranks a genuine break-out star in the shape of Nordi Makuele, goalkeeper Robin Roefs and midfielder Granit Xhaka are a big part of the difference between Sunderland and the promoted teams before them.\nRoefs and Xhaka were very different acquisitions. The 22-year-old goalkeeper was brought in with barely a season's worth of league appearances under his belt for NEC in the Eredivisie. Xhaka, now 33, has proved a captaincy masterstroke.\nThe slight fly in the ointment in the context of this meeting is that Sunderland's only away win this season was against Nottingham Forest at the end of September, which really was taking candy from a baby.\nThis fixture was last played in May 2017, when Antonio Conte's already-crowned champions Chelsea spanked relegated Sunderland 5-1 despite conceding inside the first five minutes.\nGoals from Willian, Eden Hazard and Pedro, and a brace from Michy Batshuayi, restored the party atmosphere in west London.\nSee also ► These are the cheapest ways to watch the Premier League this season\nChelsea vs Sunderland: Expected line-ups\nFourFourTwo's prediction\nChelsea 3-1 Sunderland\nSunderland need to get their noses in front and stay there for a while to quieten the in-form Blues but we expect Maresca's men to be too hot to handle.\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses.
