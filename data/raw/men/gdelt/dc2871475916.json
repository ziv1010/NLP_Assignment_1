  "body_text": "Thierry Henry’s recent comments questioning Arsenal’s lack of trophies under Mikel Arteta reflect the high standards expected at a club of this size.\nThat ambition is welcome — Arsenal should always aim to be the best. But Henry’s take also strips away the context of what has actually been achieved in recent years, which makes it feel unnecessarily harsh.\nUnder Arteta, Arsenal have evolved from a team languishing in mid-table to one that has pushed Manchester City and Liverpool all the way in consecutive Premier League seasons and reached the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in 15 years.\nThese are not minor steps. They are signs of a club being rebuilt properly, with a long-term vision and tactical clarity.\nHenry drew comparisons with Manchester United, who have won two domestic trophies and reached five finals since Arsenal last appeared in one. But United’s success has not been sustained.\nThey continue to struggle in the league and lack a clear identity. If silverware alone is the measure of progress, then that would suggest United are in a better place than Arsenal — and few would genuinely argue that they are.\nArsenal’s own FA Cup triumph under Arteta in 2020 should not be dismissed either. It was a significant achievement for a manager just months into the job, guiding an imbalanced squad to victories over Manchester City and Chelsea.\nThat win was rightly celebrated, but even then there was an understanding among fans that it could not be the limit of their ambitions. It was a stepping stone — and it has proven to be just that.\nIt is also worth noting that Henry was part of Arsenal’s greatest European team — the one that reached the 2006 Champions League final. They did not lift the trophy, but the run is still revered because of what it represented.\nThe journey, the performances and the sense of belonging at the top level mattered. That nuance seems to have been lost in modern debates, where anything short of winning is often deemed failure.\nHenry himself referenced his Olympic coaching experience, where a second-place finish brought him pride because of the journey involved. That perspective is valuable — but it should apply to Arsenal as well.\nArteta’s side are competing with the best teams in the world, playing top-level football and showing signs that silverware is not far away.\nNo one is saying near-misses should be celebrated endlessly. Arsenal need to convert promise into trophies soon. But they are not fluking cup runs while underperforming in the league — they are consistently competing at the highest level again.\nThierry Henry’s standards are part of what made him a legend. But so too was his understanding of what it takes to build something lasting. He knows better than most that trophies are the target — but progress, identity and belief are what get you there.",
