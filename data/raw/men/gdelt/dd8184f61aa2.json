  "body_text": "Boubacar Traore has not had a great deal to smile about during almost two years at Wolverhampton Wanderers, but the Mali midfielder has smiled anyway.\nAsk anyone at Molineux to describe the 22-year-old midfielder and the replies will invariably involve the words “quiet”, “popular” and “smiling”. Traore might still be working on making an impression on the pitch, but he has already made one off it.\nAdvertisement\nIt would have been easy for Traore to become despondent with a Wolves career that has not taken off in the way he and the club hoped when he arrived in the summer of 2022 from Metz in a deal that became a £10million ($12.5m) permanent transfer a year later.\nBut Traore is known among his team-mates as a low-maintenance, permanently positive and supportive member of the squad.\nOff the field, Traore’s Muslim faith is a major part of his life. That has helped him while he has adjusted well to life in Wolverhampton despite living alone, having moved from France without any friends or family.\nBut the midfielder is still working to prove himself on the field.\nSince Traore’s arrival — initially on loan but with an option that was effectively an obligation to buy, with the move officially made permanent last July — Traore has started just nine games in the Premier League and completed six full matches.\nYet Saturday’s victory over Luton Town at Molineux felt like a potential breakout game for Traore, who was, by common consent, the star player in a Wolves team in which Matheus Cunha, Hwang Hee-chan and Rayan Ait-Nouri also excelled.\nNow, with fellow midfielder Tommy Doyle unavailable for this weekend’s trip to Manchester City — the club from whom he is on loan — Traore can look forward to another start at the Etihad Stadium and potentially two more games against Crystal Palace and Liverpool to stake a claim for more starts next season.\nAnd with Doyle’s permanent move from City yet to be finalised (although Wolves are expected to trigger the £4.3million purchase option) and with Joao Gomes’ impressive form already catching the attention of scouts from high-placed clubs, the makeup of Wolves’ midfield is something of a moveable feast.\nGO DEEPER\nO'Neil: Wolves plan to sign Doyle permanently this summer\nHead coach Gary O’Neil views Traore as perfect for specific matches, as he outlined when explaining why the Mali international was selected ahead of Doyle against Luton.\nAdvertisement\n“It all depends on how I see the game,” said O’Neil. “They can both impact Premier League games very differently. If we are going to dominate the ball, like we did against West Ham for 45 minutes, you think that will suit Tommy.\n“Knowing Luton would be man-for-man and there would be lots of loose balls and duels, I thought Bouba would give us something. His performance against Arsenal (on April 20) was excellent.\n“If it was not three games in a week, he would have played against Bournemouth (in between). I just thought it was maybe too much, having not played in a while. I always had him penned in for Luton. He did us proud. He was excellent. He gave us some really good moments on the ball.”\nTraore has played just 656 minutes this season in the Premier League — the equivalent of a little over seven full games — so any statistical analysis relies on a relatively small sample of data.\nYet there are some clear indications of his strengths, which broadly match what fans have seen in the games he has played.\nAmong midfielders who have played 450 minutes or more, only three Premier League players have made more tackles per 90 minutes than Traore: Fulham’s Joao Palhinha, Sheffield United’s Vinicius Souza, and his Wolves team-mate Joao Gomes.\nAnd among the same group of players, only Souza has won more tackles per 90 minutes than Traore.\nFBRef, the detailed football data website, produces ‘scouting reports’ of players based on various metrics, compared against others in their position in Europe’s ‘big five’ domestic leagues plus the Champions League and Europa League.\nAnd over the past year, it places Traore in the 99th percentile among his fellow midfielders — among the best in the league — for tackles. He also scores highly for successive ‘take-ons’, shots and blocks.\nBut he sits in the 15th percentile for ‘shot-creating actions’ and the 11th percentile for ‘progressive passes’ — passes that move play 10 yards or more towards the opponents’ goal or end in the opposition penalty area.\nAdvertisement\nTraore is in the 71st percentile for successfully completing ‘short passes’ (up to 15 yards), but just the 47th percentile for completing ‘medium passes’ (between 15 and 30 yards) and 35th percentile for completing ‘long passes’ (30 yards or more).\nSo Traore would benefit from tidying up some of his work on the ball, but as he showed against Luton, he already has the strengths to be a major asset in the Premier League.\nIn the opening seconds of the game, Traore anticipated Matheus Cunha might lose possession.\nSure enough, the Brazil forward was dispossessed…\n… but Traore covered the ground quickly to win the ball back.\nTraore attempted to find Cunha, but the striker lost his footing.\nTraore then made up ground again to contest a 50-50 ball with Luton’s Daiki Hashioka…\n… and the Wolves man came away with possession.\nFive minutes later, Traore’s tenacity disrupted Luton effectively. When Ross Barkley fed the ball back to Jordan Clark, the midfielder was eying a pass into one of his strikers.\nBut Traore’s speed in pressing forced him to play the ball sideways instead.\nTen minutes before half-time, Gomes lost possession on the halfway line and Barkley turned to run at Wolves’ goal.\nThis time, Traore moved quickly to track back and dispossess the former Everton man.\nAnd midway through the second half, Traore had a chance to showcase his technical ability as he tried to beat opponent Tahith Chong.\nTraore coolly nutmegged the former Manchester United trainee…\n… and emerged with the ball.\nTraore’s greatest challenge in improving might be simply to achieve more game time.\nHe has been dogged by a series of niggling injuries since joining Wolves and lost a period of this season because of international duty with Mali at the Africa Cup of Nations, where he played just 37 minutes across three appearances at the tournament in Ivory Coast.\nAdvertisement\nBy the time he returned, Doyle had already established himself as the chief understudy to Mario Lemina and Gomes, who have spent much of the season as O’Neil’s preferred central midfield pairing.\nBut with his eye-catching display at the weekend, Traore delivered a timely reminder of his talents.\n“It’s been a difficult one for him because of the form of Mario and Joao, then the fact he was away for a while. It’s made him play less than he probably would have done,” said O’Neil recently.\n“Everyone knows his physical attributes and how quickly he can cover ground, how quickly he can press and the energy he brings.\n“We haven’t got to see quite enough of it this year, so it’s important we keep trying to use him and improve him. He has a big future because he’s still very young.\n“I’m really excited by what he could be.”",
