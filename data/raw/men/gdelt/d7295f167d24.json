  "body_text": "Bahrain champions Al Khaldiya will be looking for a second straight victory in the AFC Champions League (ACL) Two tonight when they take on Air Force SC of Iraq in Baghdad.\nThe game is scheduled for a 9pm kick-off at Al Madina International Stadium in the Iraqi capital.\nIt is set to be the third assignment for both sides in Group B of the competition’s preliminary round. Khaldiya are coming off a 1-0 away victory over Altyn Asyr FC of Turkmenistan earlier this month. That followed their 2-3 home loss to Al Taawoun FC of Saudi Arabia in their opening fixture in September.\nThe Bahrainis are currently third on their division table with three points, while Air Force are first on six, having won both their games so far – first a 2-1 triumph over Altyn Asyr and then another 2-1 decision over Taawoun.\nKhaldiya head coach Ali Ashoor was upbeat yesterday and stressed on the significance of tonight’s game.\n“Tomorrow’s match is an important one for us as we fight for our position in qualification,” Ashoor said last night during his pre-match Press conference.\n“Air Force are top of the table – they are a great team, they have very good coaches and Iraq national team players, and we respect them a lot. But I hope we do our job and show responsibility in this match, play with confidence, and try to win the three points.”\nAshoor noted that he is looking forward to a lively atmosphere at the match venue, where Khadliya trained last night as part of their final preparations.\n“We know it will be difficult because they have a lot of fans, and there will be maybe up to 25,000 spectators tomorrow,” Ashoor said. “Our players are used to playing in this kind of atmosphere, and I hope they go out there with their passion to get these three points.\n“I believe in my players, I believe in my team, and inshaallah we do our best in this game. We are Al Khaldiya – we were born to win these kinds of matches!”\nAshoor added that his side has done well since their arrival in Baghdad to adjust to the different weather conditions.\n“Our preparations have gone well – we had five excellent days where we were able to train together and get ourselves ready for this game; then we arrived 48 hours ago and have gotten used to the climate,” he explained. “It is a bit cold for us as there is a big difference in temperature between here and Bahrain, but we are happy to be in Iraq and we will adapt and do our best in tomorrow’s match.”\nKhaldiya have a strong line-up of top Bahraini talent, spearheaded by national team stars Komail Al Aswad, Mahdi Humaidan, Mahdi Abdulhabbar, Sayed Mahdi Baqer, Ismaeel Abdullatif, Sayed Dhiya Saeed, and Ammar Mohammed, to name a few.\nThey are boosted by top professionals including Iraqi Dhurgham Ismail, Omani Salaah Yahyaei, Algerian Oussama Bellatreche, and Brazilian Igor Torres Da Silva, along with other top talents such as Gleison Wilson da Silva Moreira, Dominique Mendy, and Syedina Laye Dabo, among others.\nThe ACL Two is the second-tier club competition of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). Rebranded from the AFC Cup, it is one level below the AFC Champions League Elite and one above the AFC Challenge League.\nFollowing tonight’s game, Khaldiya host the Iraqis in their return match in Bahrain on November 6, before playing their penultimate fixture of this stage against Taawoun in Buraidah on November 27. Khaldiya then wrap up their Group B campaign against Altyn Asyr at home on December 4.\nThe ACL Two features 32 clubs from across Asia in its opening season. The top two clubs from each of the eight groups – from West Asia and East Asia – in this preliminary stage move on to the round of 16 knockouts, which are to be held in 2025.\npatrick@gdnmedia.bh\nTop stories for today:",
