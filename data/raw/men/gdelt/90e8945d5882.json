Disbelief.\nSome players fell to the ground, others swayed and stuttered. Unsure how to react, what to do.\nWas this real?\nMost ran. To each other.\nKatie McCabe ran and ran and ran, as she had done all game. She embraced her team-mates in a flurry of emotion, a haze of technicolour as brilliant Barcelona lay slain.\nIt was real: Arsenal were European champions for the first time since 2007.\nThe Irish captain soon got her hands on a tricolour, and was draped in it thereafter.\nShe ran to do TV interviews, sharing special moments with former team-mates, most notably Emma Byrne, in between. Byrne starred 18 years ago when the Gunners first conquered Europe, with Ciara Grant and Yvonne Tracy the other Irish legends involved.\nMcCabe took inspiration from seeing an iconic picture of the trio with the trophy and tricolour every day at the training ground. This was her time.\nShe ran for the trophy presentation, first in line to get her medal and kiss the silverware.\nShe jumped for joy as Kim Little and Leah Williamson lifted it aloft, and led the team’s celebrations from Estádio José Alvalade to the Emirates Stadium.\nAs Coldplay’s Paradise and U2′s Beautiful Day rang out in the sun, McCabe’s family joined her on the pitch. The hugs with her parents, Gary and Sharon, were charged with emotion: all of the highs and lows, ups and downs, and everything they had done for their daughter, from Kilnamanagh to the biggest stage, coming together there and then.\nHer brother, Gary, and sister, Lauryn — former and future League of Ireland stars — were among the McCabe party, and a brilliant picture of them all was snapped.\nWhile precious memories were made on the turf, a group of Ireland players waited to congratulate their captain. Jessie Stapleton and Grace Moloney, both decked out in ‘McCabe 11′ Arsenal gear, were joined by Aoife Mannion, while Clare Shine, a team-mate and friend right through the ranks, squeezed the trip in while home from Australia. Megan Campbell and Anna Patten were there too, as well as several other former Raheny United players.\nAll people and places that shaped Katie McCabe on her extraordinary journey to this point, as mapped by The 42 last week.\n*****\nOn Saturday morning, the sense of occasion grew with each and every step towards Praca do Comercio. Lisbon’s famous square staged the first fanzone for a Uefa Women’s Champions League final, and the huge Barcelona support was striking from early in the day.\nA sea of red and blue, made up of young and old, marched together; chanting, singing, waving flags, beating drums.\nBut sure, who cares about women’s football? No one watches women’s sport, we’re told.\nThe Arsenal fans, meanwhile, gathered on Rua Nova do Carvalho, aka Pink Street. They painted it red. They rattled through their impressive songbook; ‘We’ve got McCabe’ getting several rousing renditions under the colourful umbrellas, with Irish accents and jerseys aplenty.\nHen party goers were puzzled by the commotion, unable to capture #content for Instagram. Stags joined the fun. Some brave Barcelona fans wormed through the crowds on the pedestrian street only to be met by well-natured quips and jeers.\nThe over-and-back continued in the searing heat at Estádio José Alvalade. A wave of guilt hit The 42 amidst a very different matchday. ‘I should be working. If Arsenal win, I need to be in the mixed zone for the Katie McCabe interview.’\nBut in this job, it’s often difficult to take in the whole experience. To savour an occasion, to fully enjoy a moment. To remember why we all love sport.\nI did my utmost to do that on Saturday.\nThe 38,356 attendance fell well short of the 50,000 capacity billed, but the atmosphere was electric.\nThe Barca noise was spine-tingling, engulfing the stadium, their expectation clear with every decibel. 5,000 Arsenal fans were seated together in one corner, with others dotted around Sporting Lisbon’s ground, in full voice, waving red and white scarves.\nLike their team on the pitch, they rode the wave and picked their moments.\nOutnumbered but undeterred.\nThe game itself requires a rewatch, but Stina Blackstenius’ winning goal in the 74th minute will live long in the memory: Mariona Caldentey’s composure and vision, McCabe’s decoy run, Beth Mead’s stunning pass, and Blackstenius’ touch and finish.\nTwo substitutes combined as Reneé Slegers’ master plan came together, and against the odds, Arsenal’s rollercoaster season ended on the highest of highs.\nIn the history books forevermore.\nKatie McCabe’s won’t be the Irish name in there: Paudie Roche (physical performance lead) and Len Pentony (camera operator) are on the Arsenal Women’s staff, while Eoin Clarkin (S&C) works across the club. Their achievement must not be lost in this either.\nMcCabe’s certainly won’t.\nAn Irish Champions League winner after a decade with Arsenal, and a wonderful occasion befitting of the achievement.\nFrom Pink Street to North London, from Kilnamanagh to the biggest stage, the celebrations will run and run and run.",
