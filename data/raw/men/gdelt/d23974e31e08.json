I'm hoping to do it differently next time as well, but what has exactly been said or what has happened, there's an ongoing process and I don't want to disturb that.\"\nSlot, in his first season at Anfield, praised his team's mental strength in the highly charged atmosphere at Everton, who are much improved in recent weeks under David Moyes, back at Goodison Park for a second spell.\n\"We've been praised so many times this season about how well these players can play, but they showed a different side of themselves on Wednesday, in my opinion also much better than the year before (a 2-0 defeat),\" he said.\n\"They were mentally so, so, so strong during a game that was played maybe in the most difficult circumstances for them as well, and to stay strong together, to fight so hard, to be mentally so strong, that gives me a lot of confidence for the upcoming 14 games.\n\"I already knew how well they can play, but the togetherness they showed during the 98 minutes shows me that we are a very, very difficult team to beat.\"\nMoyes, speaking at his own press conference on Friday, expressed his sympathy for the Liverpool manager.\n\"I feel a bit for Arne Slot because this is the thing when I was a younger manager, I was always getting involved in heated things,\" he said.\n\"It shows he cares about his club and he's fighting for his players.\"\nGuardiola admits Man City are struggling\nPep Guardiola admitted Friday his Manchester City team are not as comfortable in possession as they used to be and that they lack the physicality to compete with their Premier League rivals.\nCity have dominated English football for most of the past decade with a possession-based style that chokes opponents but they have slipped from their stellar standards this season.\nThe English league champions in six of the past seven years are realistically out of the title race, though they are in fifth spot, just two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.\nCity also face an uphill battle to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League after conceding two late goals against Real Madrid in a 3-2 defeat in the knockout phase play-offs on Tuesday.\nGuardiola told reporters ahead of Saturday's tough match against Newcastle that City's problems were multi-faceted.\n\"It's everything, it's not one,\" he said. \"(If) it's one subject, it will be easy to solve it.\n\"We have been so comfortable with the ball and now we are not as comfortable when we have the ball and after, when it doesn't happen, we have to make use of our physicality and our physicality is not like other teams.\"\nHe added: \"We know the league makes a step forward with all the teams and we make some step backwards compared with previous seasons.\"\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
