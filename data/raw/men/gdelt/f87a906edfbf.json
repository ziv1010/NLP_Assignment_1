Lineker previously had an exclusivity deal with the Beeb, which he negotiated in order to present BT Sport's Champions League coverage.\nOver the weekend, SportsLens claimed that the former forward was Evens to become the next presenter of ITV behemoth quiz format Who Wants to be a Millionaire, following Jeremy Clarkson's sacking.\nMark White is the Digital Content Editor at FourFourTwo.
