History will be revisited in the latest round of matches with the likes of Paris, Newcastle and Feyenoord hoping to make headlines this time around.\nWe pick out some key talking points as European football's most prestigious club competition heads into Matchday 3.\n24 October\nGalatasaray 1-3 Bayern\nInter 2-1 Salzburg\nMan United 1-0 Copenhagen\nSevilla 1-2 Arsenal\nLens 1-1 PSV Eindhoven\nBraga 1-2 Real Madrid\nUnion Berlin 0-1 Napoli\nBenfica 0-1 Real Sociedad\n25 October\nFeyenoord vs Lazio (18:45)\nBarcelona vs Shakhtar Donetsk (18:45)\nCeltic vs Atlético de Madrid (21:00)\nParis vs Milan (21:00)\nNewcastle vs Dortmund (21:00)\nLeipzig vs Crvena zvezda (21:00)\nYoung Boys vs Man City (21:00)\nAntwerp vs Porto (21:00)\nWhat to look out for\nŠkriniar aiming to quell Milan again\nShould Milan Škriniar line up in the Paris defence for the first part of their crucial double header with Milan, the Rossoneri could be forgiven for experiencing that sinking feeling.\nThe Slovakian international will be taking on the Italian outfit for the 19th time in his career, meaning he will have faced them on more occasions than any other club. The centre-back seems to have the Indian sign over Milan too, having won 11 and only lost four of those previous encounters.\nSuch an omen will be welcome for Luis Enrique's side as they try to clear their heads following the 4-1 defeat at Newcastle, while Milan will hope breaching Škriniar's defence will kick-start their campaign after a pair of goalless draws in Group F.\nWieffer to tread the Roman road again?\nArne Slot's Feyenoord beat Roma in their UEFA Europa League quarter-final first leg last season – this term they go head to head with their city rivals Lazio at Stadion Feijenoord 'De Kuip'.\nOne player with particularly fond memories of that contest is Mats Wieffer. \"Things are going very fast for me at the moment,\" said the midfielder after that victory in March. He was not wrong. The 23-year-old scored the only goal of that opening instalment, having made his debut for the Netherlands a few weeks earlier.\nA word of warning for Wieffer and the Dutch hopefuls, though: Roma went through in that tie after forcing extra time with a very late equaliser in the second leg. There must be something in the water in the Italian capital, Lazio having taken last-gasp drama to new heights with 95th-minute goals in both of their Group E matches to date.\nWhen are the UEFA Champions League group stage games being played?\nMatchday 3: 24/25 October\nMatchday 4: 7/8 November\nMatchday 5: 28/29 November\nMatchday 6: 12/13 December\nFurther ahead\n• All the Matchday 3 fixtures are reversed when the 32 sides play their next matches in the competition on 7/8 November.\n• Christian Eriksen and Rasmus Højlund will be eyeing a victorious homecoming when they return to Denmark, though Manchester United's position will be looking precarious regardless of their result against Copenhagen on Matchday 3.\n• Shakhtar Donetsk had never played in this competition at the start of the century but they proved to be quick learners when they beat Barcelona 2-0 at home in 2004/05. Will they repeat that feat on Matchday 4?\nWhere is the 2024 UEFA Champions League final being played?\nThe 2023/24 UEFA Champions League final will take place at Wembley Stadium in London on 1 June 2024.",
