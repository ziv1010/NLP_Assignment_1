  "body_text": "Manchester United are keen on improving their attacking unit during the summer transfer window, and they have identified Victor Osimhen as a potential target.\nThe Nigerian international has established himself as a world-class striker and he should prove to be a quality acquisition for the Red Devils. However, a report from Fichajes claims that Manchester United will have to shell out a fee of around €120 million (£103m) for the striker. Osimhen has scored 13 goals and has picked up four assists across all competitions this season.\nWhile summer signing Rasmus Hojlund has shown impressive form in recent weeks, the talented young Denmark international needs more support in the attack.\nSigning a more proven goalscorer would be a wise decision and Osimhen is certainly one of the best around right now. He helped Napoli win the league title last season and he could transform Manchester United into genuine contenders as well.\nThe Red Devils have had a disappointing season by their standards so far and they could easily miss out our Champions League qualification. If they fail to secure a top for finish, attracting world-class players like Osimhen could be difficult for them.\nThe 25-year-old Napoli striker will want to compete at the highest level and join a club capable of winning major trophies.\nMeanwhile, Osimhen has been linked with other Premier League clubs as well and it remains to be seen where he ends up eventually. The report from Fichajes mentions that he is on the radar of Premier League rivals Chelsea and the player has shown his desire to move to Stamford Bridge in the past.",
