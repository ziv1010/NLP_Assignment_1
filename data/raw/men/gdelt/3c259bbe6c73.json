  "body_text": "Xabi Alonso spoke to the media after Real Madrid’s 1-0 win over Juventus on Wednesday night. He was asked about Arda Güler’s qualities, to which he said: “Arda is in the process of improving everything. He’s 20 years old and has already played a few games for Madrid. With his age and quality, we have to support him. He needs to improve his decision-making and pressing, but he has a lot of good qualities. He gives great meaning to the game. When he’s involved, we have a better team dynamic. Where? It depends on what’s around him or what the game demands. I’m very happy with his progress, but we want more. He really enjoys playing football. He wants to find the pass, take the free kick... Wirtz was like that at Leverkusen. He’s young, but he’s a great player. He’s in the process, but at a high level.”\nXabi Alonso: “Arda Güler is in the process of improving everything”\nHe spoke after Juventus.\nAlonso on the match\n“We knew it was going to be competitive, but there were different moments. We improved, and it was hard for us to get into the game. We adjusted and came out very well. After the goal, our best moments came. We have a great goalkeeper, he has the quality we’ve used on important Champions League nights. He comes through in key moments. Three more points, we’re happy.\n“There were different phases. We improved, we didn’t attack well, but we adjusted. We had more of the ball and increased the pace. It allowed us to create chances. I told them it was a game about working hard, looking for chances, and not losing our balance. And that’s how it turned out. Vini made a great play. We couldn’t kill them off, but we’re leaving with three points. Courtois was also very good. Let’s keep going.”\nAlonso on ‘defending the result’\n“We had to defend the result; Juventus put more pressure on us. They pushed us. This is the Champions League, there’s no easy victory. You have to enjoy defending a victory. It’s normal.“\nAlonso on Jude Bellingham\n“He played a very complete game. There was no space. Finding him between the lines was difficult. I liked him in Getafe and I liked him today. And he scored. I’m very happy for him; he enjoyed himself and was competitive. He’s a midfielder, with the quality to build and the determination to finish. He’s the kind of player who covers a lot of ground. He has many different qualities. That’s why he’s so complete, one of the most complete in the world.\n“I ask him to feel involved in the game. To be as effective as possible. We must approach him in advantageous positions. The numbers are a consequence of many things.”\nAlonso on improvements\n“We’re doing well, let’s see this week. We’ve been on the up. We’ve done some good things, some not so good. It’s the Clásico, it means a lot. For the game, for qualification.”\nAlonso on transitions\n“We weren’t good at the start. We knew why we were disorganized. We detected a mistake in Vlahovic’s case, and it will be corrected.\n”There are many points. We’re improving week after week. They caught us out on some transitions because we wanted to be aggressive in the opponent’s half. That play... As a spectator, it was a spectacle. I was praying he wouldn’t get sent off, and then there was Thibaut.”\nAlonso on Barcelona\n“We know the significance of Sunday’s match. We’re not making big decisions. We know how important it is. We’re playing against Barça, and it has a significant impact on the standings. We’re going to prepare well.”\nAlonso on Militao\n“It’s hard to compare, but for everyone, having Militao back at this level is tremendous news. We’re seeing it. We see it every game. That he’s recovered those sensations makes us very happy; he feels more powerful and more determined. I think he’ll only get better.”",
