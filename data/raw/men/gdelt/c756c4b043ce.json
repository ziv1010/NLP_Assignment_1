  "body_text": "As someone who struggles with change, I haven’t found the new Champions League format as stressful as I thought.\nA League table where you have to face seeded teams from all 4 pots ensures we get more competitive fixtures than we get in the Group stages. There should also be more jeopardy when it reaches its conclusion compared to the traditional Matchday 5 and 6 where most of the favourites would already be qualified.\nNot that this is the reason UEFA have changed their formula.\nMy initial reaction to Friday’s draw was our 8 fixtures could have been a lot worse and for travelling Gooners, there’s some lovely trips on the calendar.\nFor those planning around work or wanting to book flights, dates and times of all matches were clarified over the weekend.\nA top 8 finish guarantees us a place in the last 16.\n9-24 puts us in a two-legged play for a spot in the knockout rounds.\nHere is a closer look at those standing in our way ….\nAtalanta – A\nOne of Europe’s biggest talking points last seasons, the Europa League was their first trophy in 61 years and first ever European silverware. That meant they were the only side in the whole season to beat Bayer Leverkusen.\nAs is natural with any surprise package, the Italians have had interest for several of their key players.\nTeun Koopmeiners departure was a saga.\nIt’s in our favour for this fixture to come early as La Dea start the season with some of their attackers on the sidelines for a period of time.\nYet such is the spirit around the club that no matter any injuries or transfers, the expectation will still be a high press, flying wing backs and lots of energy.\nPSG – H\nI think it’s a good time to welcome PSG to the Emirates?\nThe club are in transition with the departure of Mbappe. While that’s hurt the whole of Ligue 1 in terms of sponsorship and TV contracts, there are many in Paris who are glad the club have got away from the Galactico model.\nNow Luis Enrique can work with a more balanced side with the understanding and patience to develop youngsters.\nThere is great talent, but they won’t rock up to North London with the air of prestige they have had over the years.\nShakhtar Donetsk – H\nLike most sports team from Ukraine, motivation and perspective slightly different to their peers creating a unique team spirit.\nEven before the war they were not good travellers, so we have luck of the draw that we face them at the Emirates.\nIt’s been confirmed their ‘home’ fixtures will be in Germany where the locals have been supportive and there is a large amount of refugees in the country.\nOne of the most emotional moments of last year’s CL was them beating Barcelona in front of unwavering support.\nAs is tradition, the Ukrainian Champions comprise of domestic based players surrounded by Brazilian exports?\nInter Milan- A\nOne of 5 Champions we will face with Inter Milan lifting the Scudetto for the 20th time.\nThe club have new owners after the previous regime built up debt which threatened bankruptcy, eventually unable to meet a deadline to pay what they owed.\nIt’s the kind of off the field issue which would have impacted them off the pitch previously, but this has been well managed.\nIn fact, they won Serie A by 19 points, despite getting big earners off the pay roll, bringing the average age of the squad down.\nA marquee signing to become one of the favourites to win the Champions League was unlikely this summer, but most of the Ultras will be content they haven’t had to sell any of their crown jewels.\nMartinez, Bastoni and DiMarco should all go from strength from strength.\nMost importantly, Inzaghi has extended his contract at a time his reputation around the world is high.\nHe’s being given the credit of masterminding the 3-5-2 formation.\nArsenal have been back at the San Siro since 2003 but not against Inter since our famous 5-1 win. It remains arguably our greatest ever performance in Europe.\nSporting Lisbon – A\nThis is a banana skin against some people’s dark horses.\nThis is the same team and manager who knocked us out of the Europa League two years, and they are better now.\nSuch is the nature of the Portuguese League they won’t be able to hang on to Ruben Amorim forever. At one point in the summer, it looked like he was going to be the Liverpool or West Ham manager.\nHis 3-4-3 formation, tactical adaptability and calm demeanour has made his reputation skyrocket, and this Champions League campaign might be his job interview to the world. Especially when the 39-year-old faces Arteta.\nGooners might also be fascinated how Gyokeres performs against us? Has been linked heavily as a striker we are interested in.\nMonaco – H\nAfter a period of financial chaos Monaco have steadied themselves. That’s the word I will give them, steady. It’s just if it’s a season too soon to challenge PSG domestically and compete in Europe.\nWissam Ben Yader was surprisingly allowed to leave as a free agent while the club continue to rely on youth like Ben Seghir.\nThe Runners up in Ligue 1 had the second worst defensive record in the top half which tells you there strengths and weaknesses. Great going forward but vulnerable at the back.\nAt this level that will cost them\nDinamo Zagreb -H\nThe easiest game on paper.\nThe Croatians are the only side out of our 8 opponents who needed to go through the qualifying rounds.\nBeen a decade since they last recorded an away win in the Champions’ League Group stages.\nIf this fixture were away, I would mention a hostile atmosphere, but at the Emirates they will struggle.\nA gulf in class between the two sides.\nQuite simply a home banker\nGirona – A\nPerhaps the most romantic tie we have been drawn against, with Girona only in the La Liga for the 5th time in their history and their first ever Champions League campaign.\nFor the majority of their life span have completed in the third tier so this is a Cinderella story.\nPart of the City Football Club who own Man City, there style of football is similar to that of the Etihad model.\nUnder the CFG model they have overseen promotion and qualification for Europe for the first time. Despite wealthy backers though it shouldn’t be assumed they have brought their way to success. Their scouting network has the rest of their country envious.\nLaw of averages says they won’t be able to domestically repeat their heroics again, but in Europe it’s a complete adventure where they have nothing to lose their intimate home of 14,000 fans.\nHow rare is that, where you face Spain’s 3rd best side, yet all the pressure is on you.\nIt’s so unique that we play a team who dominate possession and play attacking football, yet they can play with the freedom of having zero expectation.\nDan\nADMIN COMMENT\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.\nCALLING ALL ARSENAL FANS!
