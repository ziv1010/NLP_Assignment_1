  "body_text": "Nicolas Jackson says he was ‘very happy’ to hear Enzo Maresca play down rumours that Chelsea could look to replace him in the summer transfer window.\nThe 23-year-old has blown hot and cold in English football since swapping Villarreal for Stamford Bridge back in 2023, but remains Maresca’s first-choice striker when fit.\nOnly Cole Palmer has outscored Jackson this season and the Blues badly struggled during the forward’s two-month injury layoff, with Maresca forced to experiment with Christopher Nkunku and Pedro Neto up front.\nBut Jackson has returned to the fold to start Chelsea’s last two games and will no doubt be chomping at the bit to make an impact away to London rivals Fulham this afternoon.\nMaresca has, though, been cautious with Jackson’s workload since his comeback and took the Senegal international off at half-time during the side’s Europa League quarter-final second leg with Legia Warsaw last week.\n‘It’s not easy to come back from injury so right now I am trying to,’ Jackson told Chelsea’s official website ahead of the club’s trip to Craven Cottage.\n‘I’m trying to get back to my level, trying to push, because we have important games and I need to be at my best, so I’m pushing now and training hard.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nEarlier this month, Maresca poured cold water on speculation linking Chelsea with a summer transfer move for Ipswich’s Liam Delap, insisting he already had the ‘perfect No.9’ in Jackson.\n‘I saw that,’ a smiling Jackson replied when asked about Maresca’s comments.\n‘I just do my work and if the coach says what he thinks, I just work and the team help me, fighting for the team. I hope he is playing me and believing in me. I’m very happy with that.\n‘I know what I can do and what I cannot do. He will say I know what I can do in the pitch. I am happy, and that makes me want to fight for him and try to make him be where he wants to be, and where the club wants to be.’\nChelsea lost further ground in the race for Champions League qualification by dropping points at home to Ipswich last time out in the English top flight.\nBut Jackson insists the squad maintain a strong sense of ‘belief’ that they can secure a top-four finish.\n‘We believe because we have been there all season,’ the ex-Villarreal forward added.\n‘We are still there and to be top four I’m sure if we win all the games we will be there. We need to focus on ourselves, believe in the coach and fight for the team.\nMore Trending\n‘If we win the Conference League we are the first club in history to win all European trophies. That’s a good achievement.\n‘We try to finish top four, win the Conference and go to the Club World Cup, and see what happens from there.’\nChelsea’s inconsistent form has seen them plummet to seventh in the Premier League table ahead of their clash with neighbours Fulham.\nBut victory could see the west London giants leapfrog Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest into fifth place heading into their last five matches of the top-flight campaign.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: William Gallas makes shock prediction for Arsenal’s trip to Ipswich\nMORE: How Liverpool can beat Arsenal to Premier League title today\nMORE: Man Utd ready to offer Marcus Rashford in deal to sign ‘fuming’ Premier League star",
