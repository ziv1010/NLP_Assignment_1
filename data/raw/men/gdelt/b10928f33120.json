Despite their emphatic 3-0 win over Commercial Bank of Ethiopia FC in their first game, a goalless draw against Egypt’s FC Masar in their second game put the ladies in a precarious position.\nAdvertisement\nBut the South Africans struck first in the 24th minute through Melinda Ngadiete. Edo Queens squandered numerous chances in search of a response.\nAs the game crept past the 90-minute mark, the NWFL champions’ persistence paid off. A pinball situation inside the South African goal area led to the ball falling kindly for Emem Essien with the open post. The Edo Queens skipper stabbed the ball into the net, and the entire team wheeled away in celebration.\nIn the 11th minute of added time, the Nigerian club grabbed the unlikely winner and completed a dramatic comeback when Mary Mamudu rolled the ball into the net.\nAdvertisement\nEdo Queens become the first Nigerian side to qualify beyond the group stage of the CAF Women’s Champions League.\nThe team will face TP Mazembe Ladies in the semi-final on Tuesday.\nAdvertisement",
