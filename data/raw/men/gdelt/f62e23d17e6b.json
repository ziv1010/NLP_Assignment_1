They've won three of their last four including victories over Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool.\nThe south coast side are three points outside the European places, a target that will become more realistic if they can knock over a teetering Villa team.\nShould they go on to reach even the Conference League and a first European campaign, Iraola will be the most popular man in that corner of Boscombe since Buster Merryfield.\nHis battles with fellow Basque manager Unai Emery in the Premier League have mostly been tight affairs but Villa did a number on Andoni's new-look defence in November.\nTickets\nGet VIP Bournemouth tickets HERE with Seat Unique!\nBournemouth hospitality provides a polished experience in the intimate Vitality Stadium.

Their only other four-goal game was a 4-3 win away from home at Brighton & Hove Albion.\nAfter a colossal winning run punctuated only by defeat at Anfield, Villa have now lost three of their last six matches. They've won six away games in the Premier League this season, losing only to Arsenal and Liverpool and, in their early-season incarnation, against Brentford.\nThe Bees repeated their 1-0 win at Villa Park last Sunday and Villa are rocking. With Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool chasing them and the gap shrinking, Emery must restore their ability to simply find any which way to win.\nThat's what they did at the Vitality Stadium last season. Ollie Watkins barely touched the goal that made him Villa's record Premier League scorer but that slight diversion was enough to win the game. How they'd love more of the same.\nSee also ► These are the cheapest ways to watch the Premier League this season\nFourFourTwo's prediction\nBournemouth 1-0 Aston Villa\nVilla are in a bad spot and Bournemouth have the attacking weapons to inflict serious damage.
