We've got you covered. Newcastle vs Brighton is on Sky Sports in the UK. Brit abroad? Use a VPN to watch the Premier League with your subscription from anywhere.\nThis is a crucial game for both sides. Third-place Newcastle are looking to stave of a late-season run of form from Liverpool, who have mounted a challenge for the Champions League spots that seemed unlikely even a month ago.\nBrighton – one of this season's biggest surprise packages – still harbour European hopes themselves. Having dispatched Arsenal (and their waning title hopes) 3-0 at the Emirates at the weekend, they now lie seven points off Liverpool in fifth, but with two games in hand. Securing Europa League qualification may be unlikely, but so is everything else about Roberto De Zerbi's side.\nKick-off is at 7.30pm BST. Make sure you know how to watch the Premier League wherever you are.\nTeam news\nNewcastle's Sean Longstaff is still out with a foot problem, while Matt Ritchie, Emil Krafth and Jamaal Lascelles are all out too, and Jacob Murphy is doubtful.\nBrighton's list of absentees includes Adam Webster, Joel Veltman and Solly March, as well as Adam Lallana, Tariq Lamptey, Jeremy Sarmiento and Jakub Moder. Goalkeeper Robert Sanchez was not included in the weekend's squad, and remains out, according to De Zerbi.\nForm\nNewcastle: DLWWW\nBrighton: WLWWL\nReferee\nRobert Jones will be the referee for Newcastle vs Brighton.\nStadium\nNewcastle vs Brighton will be played at St James' Park in Newcastle.\nKick-off and channel\nNewcastle vs Brighton kick-off is at 7.30pm BST on Thursday May 18 in the UK. The game is being shown on Sky Sports Channel.\nIn the US, kick-off time is 2.30pm ET / 11.30am PT. The match will be shown on NBC in the US. See below for international broadcast options.\nVPN guide\nUse a VPN to watch Premier League football from outside your country\nIf you’re out of the country for a Premier League fixture, then you won't be able to watch on your domestic streaming service as usual. The broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!) and blocks you from watching it. You can use a VPN to get around that, though, without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and will let you watch. And all the info going between is entirely encrypted, anonymous and safe – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there. For the Premier League, FourFourTwo currently recommends:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS5 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price. Go get it!\nInternational Premier League TV rights\n• UK: Sky Sports and BT Sport are the two main players once again, but Amazon also have a slice of the pie in 2022/23.\n• USA: NBC Sports Group are the Premier League rights holders, with the Peacock Premium streaming platform showing even more than the 175 games it aired last season. If you pick up a fuboTV subscription for the games not on Peacock Premium, you'll be able to watch every game.\n• Canada: The way to watch Premier League football in 2022/23 is fuboTV, which has exclusive rights to all the action.\n• Australia: Optus Sport will screen every game of the Premier League season. Non-subscribers can access the action via a Fetch TV box and other friendly streaming devices.\n• New Zealand: Sky Sport are serving up all 380 games – plus various highlights and magazine shows throughout the week, as well as the Champions League.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nConor Pope is the former Online Editor of FourFourTwo, overseeing all digital content.
