We are appealing to well-wishers to assist in cash and kind.”\nOsman also said they are expected to meet their sponsors, Capital Oil Refining Industry, to present their budget for consideration tomorrow.\n“We expect them to contribute something, but certainly not the whole amount,” he said.\nMeanwhile, Osman has also approached Football Association of Malawi (FAM) for assistance.\nIn 2023, FAM offered Ntopwa free camp at Mpira Village which houses the association’s offices in Chiwembe Township, Blantyre. The association also did the same for 2024 representatives Ascent Soccer Academy based in Lilongwe.\nFAM competitions and communications director Gomezgani Zakazaka confirmed receiving Ntopwa’s plea for support.\nHowever, the 2025 tournament has coincided with the Malawi Under-17 National Football Team camp at Mpira Village in preparation for the Cosafa Under-17 Championship to be held next month and is also a qualifier for the 2026 Under17 CAF Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.\nBut Zakazaka said the association will consider the request.\nHe said: “We just got the letter from Ntopwa on Tuesday in which they are asking for camping assistance. The association will respond accordingly.”\nNtopwa FC have been drawn in Group A of the tournament.\nThe FAM-Goshen National Women’s Championship winners will face Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa, Beauties FC of Namibia and Zambia’s Zesco Ndola Girls in what is touted to be a group of death.\nBut Osman said they will target at least the knockout stage this time around.\nHe said: “I think we can make it. Mamelodi Sundowns are the only challenge in that group. The other teams are beatable.\n“We have a squad capable of making it to the knockout stage and we will also beef up the team with new players ahead of the tournament.\n“That’s why we really need the support to go and compete at the tournament.”\nGroup B includes Gaborone United (Botswana), Young Buffaloes (Eswatini), and Kick4Life WFC (Lesotho) while Group C features Herentals Queens FC (Zimbabwe), Club de Desportos da Costa do Sol (Mozambique) and Olympic de Moroni (Comoros).\nMalawi hosted last year’s edition at Mpira Stadium in Blantyre, but Ascent Soccer also bowed out in the group stage.",
