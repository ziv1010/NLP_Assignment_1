  "body_text": "Manchester United have been let down on a number of occasions due to the lack of a ruthless finisher up top, something manager Erik ten Hag is desperate to change.\nMarcus Rashford has enjoyed the best season of his career with 28 goals but he is not the best fit to play as the sole target-man up top.\nAnthony Martial‘s poor injury record and loan signing Wout Weghorst being goal-shy have not helped matters for the club post the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo.\nUnited need a top-class marksman in the summer\nThat is why the Red Devils have been linked with a plethora of strikers with Tottenham’s Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen of Napoli said to be among the favourites to land up at Old Trafford.\nBut according to 90min, United’s rumoured move for the Serie A top scorer is likely to fail as Premier League rivals are ready to blow their rivals from the water with a deal for the Nigerian.\nAccording to the report, the London side are confident that they can secure Osimhen’s signature despite not being able to provide Champions League football next season.\nTheir confidence stems from the fact that moving to London would appeal to 24-year-old and the fact that he would get the chance to emulate his childhood idol Didier Drogba, who was a Chelsea legend.\n“Chelsea believe Osimhen would want to move to Stamford Bridge even without European football and the Blues are also prepared to blow other clubs out of the water with a huge club-record bid for the striker.\nOsimhen open to London switch\n“Moving to England’s capital city is of interest to Osimhen but so too is the chance to follow in the footsteps of his childhood idol, Ivorian striker Didier Drogba, who is fondly remembered as one of Chelsea’s all-time greatest players,” the report mentioned.\nThe article further detailed that Chelsea hold the upper-hand over United as the Reds are more inclined towards securing the services of the Tottenham talisman.\nBayern Munich, who have also been linked with a move, cannot hope to match the financial package being prepared by Chelsea while Paris Saint-Germain remain far behind in the race.\nChelsea are planning to offload a number of major first-team stars in a bid to raise enough capital to go after Osimhen.\nFollow The Peoples Person on Twitter or Instagram for all the latest news as it happens and to join in the conversation.",
