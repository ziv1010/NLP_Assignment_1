  "body_text": "Last international break, Newcastle United’s prospects looked rather different.\nTheir performance in a 3-1 defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion was meek and insipid, having already thrown away a golden opportunity to beat Liverpool the week before.\nJust three points from their first four games — only a snapshot, granted, but one which raised concern over whether Newcastle could emulate last season. They may have played some of the league’s strongest sides, but it was the performances as well as the results that stirred these feelings.\nAdvertisement\nLast month, The Athletic discussed several of the narratives surrounding Newcastle’s start, such as the configuration of the midfield, a perceived loss of intensity, and whether the club had tried to be too clever in the transfer market.\nBut since that international break, many of those concerns have been dispelled.\nNewcastle are unbeaten in seven games, winning five of them. That stretch includes victories over Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain, two of the best teams on the continent, as well as an 8-0 demolition of Sheffield United. Only an 89th-minute equaliser from West Ham United prevented them from earning a perfect league record during this run.\nFootball moves rapidly and the current break provides an opportunity to reflect on those changes, so what is going right with Newcastle United?\nDespite difficult start, mood remained calm\nEighth-placed Newcastle have already played five teams above them in their opening eight games. Statistically, their first five matches were the most difficult fixtures faced by any side in the league — Aston Villa (h), Manchester City (a), Liverpool (h), Brighton (a) and Brentford (h).\nThough results in the first four games were still disappointing, there was no real sense of alarm. In the same fixtures the previous season, Newcastle only took one more point (four).\n“There was no crisis meeting or anything,” said one senior player of the mood after Brighton. “Internally we know how good we are, so there was no panic.”\nThe coaching staff had anticipated the opening block of fixtures being difficult but always remained optimistic that these problems would be overcome. Stay true to their principles against the best and results would duly follow against weaker sides.\nInside the dressing room, the nature of the Brighton defeat refocused some minds — the success of the previous season meant they had to continue doing the little things that brought them those results, not stop doing them. To tread water in the Premier League, you have to keep swimming. Those players who stayed behind during the international break were worked suitably hard.\nAdvertisement\nAbove Howe, Newcastle’s ownership were only concerned with empowering and helping the coach rather than questioning his position.\nThe display against Brentford in the first game back was not one of Newcastle’s best, but they emerged with their first win since the opening day thanks to Callum Wilson’s second-half penalty. Newcastle had momentum and in the subsequent matches, performances have followed.\nSince the break, the numbers of what might be considered ‘the basics’ have all seen an increase. Tackles per game are up from 8.0 to 12.5, ball recoveries from 46.0 to 52.5, while they have run almost 10km more as a collective than any other side in their Champions League group.\nThe opposition is undoubtedly a large factor in Newcastle’s improvement. Stay calm and trust the process. The league fixture against Manchester City, for example, was cited as excellent preparation for Burnley, who play in a similar style but not quite as well.\nBut this is also a team that ripped apart PSG. It is not just a case of them winning the games they should win. Newcastle have improved in other areas, too.\nSean Longstaff’s midfield balancing act\nIn terms of personnel, the major change after the international break was Sean Longstaff’s restoration to the midfield.\nAfter the best season of his career in 2022-23, an injury in pre-season and Sandro Tonali’s arrival meant he began the campaign outside the starting XI — his first start came against Brentford after the international break.\nAs analysed last month, the midfield had been struggling as a unit — both Joelinton and Bruno Guimaraes were out of form, while Tonali was adapting to the several different roles Howe demands from his midfielders. Tonali’s availability over the coming months is uncertain, with the 23-year-old part of an ongoing investigation into illegal betting in Italy.\nGO DEEPER\nTonali and Zaniolo betting probe explained: Accusations, potential punishments and next steps\nOne of the fittest players in Newcastle’s squad, alongside fellow local product Elliot Anderson, Longstaff immediately brought defensive solidity to a midfield that was played through with ease at Brighton, but since his recall, Longstaff has matched Joelinton and Tonali’s attacking numbers.\nThis season, Longstaff has been stylistically different from the other No 8 options. While Tonali and Joelinton like to carry the ball forward (particularly Tonali), Longstaff has brought his progressive passing into the side, either playing passes through the lines or going aerial to spread the ball quickly.\nHis passing accuracy may be lower, but that is a reflection of the ambition of his passes. Amidst a feeling that some of Newcastle’s passing had become too lateral — with the Liverpool match one key example — Longstaff formed part of the solution.\nIn practice, he likes to play raking passes out to Anthony Gordon on the left wing — getting the ball quickly into the feet of Newcastle’s most in-form attacker.\nHere is one example from late on against Brighton. On as a substitute, Longstaff immediately hits a long ball to Wilson on the half-turn.\nIt finds the striker perfectly in stride, who battles past Jan Paul van Hecke to score a consolation for Newcastle. Longstaff repeatedly tried a similar ball against Sheffield United three weeks later.\nRecalled to the starting line-up against Brentford, the following map shows he immediately became the midfield’s most valuable passer.\nHere, he bypasses four defenders to find Harvey Barnes’ run infield — a technically challenging pass that he curves with the outside of his laces.\nBarnes gets through on goal and only a good Nathan Collins challenge prevents a shot.\nBy being restored to the right, Newcastle have the same personnel on the flank as last season — where Guimaraes, Kieran Trippier and Miguel Almiron played the passing triangles that fired Newcastle’s attack.\nAdvertisement\nBut Longstaff has not just added variation to his passing. As No 8s, Tonali, Joelinton and Anderson all prefer to be further forward — bombing onwards and rotating with the winger on their side. Tonali improved when he was able to do this with Gordon rather than swapping with Guimaraes to spend phases as the No 6.\nBut Longstaff’s game is slightly different — he is happy rotating with Guimaraes as the deepest-lying midfielder. When he goes upfield, he tends to make runs directly into the box (such as for his goals against PSG and Sheffield United) rather than movements out wide.\nAgainst PSG, he often played as the No 6 and organised Newcastle’s press. The first goal is a perfect example.\nLongstaff is the deepest and most central player in Newcastle’s midfield three — Gordon is just getting back into position. Hakimi’s pass back to Marquinhos is Longstaff’s trigger.\nHe sprints to close down Manuel Ugarte, Marquinhos’ easy out ball between the lines. With Alexander Isak closing down the lateral pass to Milan Skriniar, the centre-back instead tries to lob the ball over the first two waves of Newcastle’s press — behind, Newcastle’s back four are man-to-man with PSG’s attacking quartet.\nGuimaraes intercepts Marquinhos’ pass and after Isak’s shot is blocked, Almiron gives Newcastle the lead. Longstaff’s decision to close down Ugarte sparked that selective press.\nThis has always been one of Longstaff’s strengths. He was tenacious against PSG, forcing the high turnovers that fed Newcastle’s attack.\nThough Joelinton gets through more tackles in total, Longstaff leads the midfield in high-value turnovers in the middle and final thirds and also enjoys the highest tackle success rate amongst the midfielders.\nSince coming back into the side, Longstaff has offered Newcastle balance. From third-choice No 8 entering the season (arguably lower if Joe Willock was fit), he has cemented his first-choice status in just seven matches since the last international break.\nBruno Guimaraes finding form\nTrippier and Gordon have been in form throughout the season. They have been consistent, even before the international break, but Guimaraes has only returned to prominence in recent matches.\nWhat has been behind this?\nAdvertisement\nFatigue could be an issue, with Guimaraes (and Joelinton) now a regular member of the Brazil squad. There were also contract negotiations, with Guimaraes’ long-term future now secured having signed a new five-year deal earlier this month.\nA large part was also collective expectations — having played so well in his 18 months at Newcastle, any slight fall from those outstanding levels, which are so difficult to maintain, appeared outsized.\nIn recent weeks, Longstaff’s introduction has made Newcastle much more solid defensively, allowing the Brazilian to play with freedom.\nTen years ago, creative freedom in midfield was limited to floaty No 10s popping up wherever they wished on the pitch. Guimaraes’ freedom is difficult — rather than conducting passing from deep in midfield, he is at his most dangerous when he can enter build-up play late, untracked by defenders and free to play the crucial pass.\nSince the last international break, with Longstaff doing much of the attacking grunt work, Guimaraes’ attacking numbers have gone up. He is recording 3.83 shot-creating actions per 90 compared to 2.25 before Brentford and is managing 2.0 key passes per match versus just 0.75 before.\nInherently, football looks fun again. Take this example, with Longstaff sitting in the No 6 role, where Guimaraes has the confidence to flick the ball over Josh Cullen’s head.\nBut here is an example of Guimaraes’ new-found freedom. At 1-1 against West Ham United, there are seven players in front of him, with the Brazilian not even in shot. Longstaff has been key to recycling the ball here, not Guimaraes, rotating possession with Anderson on the left.\nWith West Ham’s defence occupied — look at the eyes on Longstaff — Guimaraes is free to wander centrally. Though the hosts are set, Guimaraes’ entrance allows Newcastle to exploit a new angle, finding Trippier on the right…\n… who volleys back across goal for Isak to put Newcastle in front.\nAs a unit, Newcastle’s midfield is beginning to gain chemistry. Howe likes to pattern his team’s play based on triggers — aimed to put Guimaraes or Trippier, the team’s best passers, into position to make the crucial intervention.\nAdvertisement\nThe first half against Burnley is an excellent example. This image is taken from the 16th pass of a long move, in which eight Newcastle players have already touched the ball.\nBurnley’s defensive structure is excellent, forcing Newcastle to move the ball backwards and laterally. The midfield’s movement, however, manufactures space vertically.\nTrippier’s wide pass to Almiron is the trigger — as that is played, both Longstaff and Anderson turn their shoulders upfield, with Sander Berge and Josh Brownhill drifting to go with them. Zeki Amdouni had been in position to press Newcastle’s centre-backs, so missed Guimaraes’ movement towards the centre circle behind him.\nThat means that as Almiron turns to play the ball infield, Guimaraes has suddenly found space in the heart of midfield. Look how early Isak recognises the opportunity — pointing for the pass from Guimaraes before the ball has even left Almiron’s boot.\nThe pass is perfect and Isak should score.\nIn Newcastle’s first four games, the midfield looked like what it was — three players struggling to adjust to each other’s styles. In recent matches, they have been a well-oiled machine, making micro-adjustments on the fly to allow each other to shine.\nRuthless finishing\nAs much as it might sometimes seem possible, Guimaraes cannot both assist and score. Isak, Wilson, Gordon, and Almiron have all been in outstanding form in front of goal, resulting in tangible end product.\nHowe says he does not judge his attackers on goals and assists — that they can still be playing well without the headline statistics. Over the past month, there has been no need to make that case.\nBetween them, Isak and Wilson have 10 goals, with only one strike partnership in the Premier League having more — Erling Haaland and Julian Alvarez at Manchester City (11).\nAdvertisement\nGordon has already matched his goal involvements from last season and Almiron has scored three times in his last four appearances.\nThis has been the product of ruthless finishing — especially since the last international break.\nBefore the Brentford game, Newcastle’s finishing had been roughly on par with expectations. While it was excellent against Aston Villa on the opening day, they spurned multiple openings in the 2-1 loss to Liverpool.\nSince then, they have comfortably outstripped expectations. The difference between actual goals scored and expected goals scored has only been bettered by Brighton and Aston Villa.\nIn the 8-0 win over Sheffield United, their xG tally was 3.92. For the 4-1 victory over PSG, it was just 0.94 — a figure not even included in the graphic above.\nThese numbers have been helped by long-distance strikes from Gordon and Almiron (against Sheffield United and Burnley respectively). Last season, Newcastle scored more long-range efforts than any other side in the league despite taking the lowest percentage of shots from outside the area.\nThe concern is that these figures flatter Newcastle and that their luck in front of goal will revert to the mean as the season continues. This should not be a major issue.\nNewcastle currently have the highest xG figure in the Premier League (17.3), just ahead of Liverpool (16.8) and Brighton (16.5). Sustaining this level, even if they finish chances at an average level, will see them continue to climb the Premier League table.",
