  "body_text": "Mikel Arteta expects to have Kai Havertz available when Arsenal take on Portsmouth in the FA Cup third round on Sunday.\nHavertz has not featured since the opening weekend of the season, coming off the bench against Manchester United before undergoing what the club described as ‘minor’ knee surgery at the end of August.\nA setback delayed his return to action with the Germany international returning to the squad for the home game against Aston Villa at the end of December.\nHavertz was missing again for subsequent games against Bournemouth and Liverpool – decisions made with the player’s load management in mind rather than a fresh issue.\nArteta is now hopeful he will be able to call upon him at Fratton Park.\n”If everything goes well, I think so,’ the Arsenal boss said. ‘I think he’s going to be in the squad again in the next few days.\n‘He trains well, he’s increased his load, he’s coping with that really well. And it will be great if we can have him.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nHavertz’s return to fitness leaves Arteta with three options up top with Gabriel Jesus also fit again alongside summer signing Viktor Gyokeres. Mikel Merino has also demonstrated he can be an effective option leading the line.\nGyokeres returned from a hamstring injury at the end of November but has scored just one goal – coming from the penalty spot – in 10 games, drawing a blank in his last four. A return of five goals from 18 Premier League games has not been good enough.\nHis performance against Liverpool om Thursday night was a particular concern, raising further questions over his ability to test elite defenders having giving Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate nothing to worry about that night in north London.\nFormer striker Michael Owen suggested Gyokeres lacks the ‘class’ needed to cause problems against the best defences in football with Gary Neville describing his performance as ‘really poor.’\n‘He’s been ineffective, and that’s being kind. It’s a really poor night from him, he offered nothing. Neville said.\n‘Look, there’s not getting service and then there’s getting involved in the game and doing more – and he needed to do more.’\nArteta is likely to rotate his squad against Portsmouth but coming fixtures will provide a clearer indication of whether the Gunners boss still views Gyokeres as his first choice up front. Arsenal head to Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday before a trip to Nottingham Forest at the weekend.\nArsenal then take on Inter Milan in Italy in the Champions League before welcoming Manchester United to the Emirates on 25 January.\nMore Trending\nJamie Carragher watched Gyoekres labour up top in the 4-1 win over Villa with Gabriel Jesus scoring a minute after replacing the former Sporting CP star. When both Jesus and Havertz are fit and available, Carragher insisted both should be ahead of Gyokeres in the pecking order.\n‘Him or Havertz as the central striker for Arsenal is a better player than Gyokeres. Gyokeres is really game and I admire him for taking that penalty against Everton, he always looks really intense.\n‘But I think he just lacks that finesse and quality when you think about what they have on the bench.’\nMORE: Man Utd handed huge boost for Manchester derby but star fumes at ‘obvious decision’\nMORE: Football postponed latest: FA Cup and EFL games off due to Storm Goretti\nMORE: Eddie Howe stance on Manchester United job revealed after Roy Keane support",
