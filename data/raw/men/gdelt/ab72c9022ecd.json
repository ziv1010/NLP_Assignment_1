Eliminated in the group stages of the Europa League, Spurs went out of the League Cup in the third round.\nTottenham's 2012/13 season\nTottenham made a managerial change in the summer of 2012, with André Villas-Boas appointed to take over from Harry Redknapp.\nUnder the Portuguese, Spurs finished fifth in the Premier League and reached the quarter-finals of the Europa League, losing on penalties to FC Basel. The Lilywhites went out in the fourth round of both domestic cup competitions and in the summer, Gareth Bale left for Real Madrid in a €100 million (£85.3m) transfer.\nTottenham's 2013/14 season\nTottenham struggled after Gareth Bale's exit and manager André Villas-Boas was sacked before Christmas following a poor run of results, with Tim Sherwood taking over until the end of the season.\nSpurs finished sixth in the Premier League and were beaten by Benfica in the last 16 of the Europa League, with a third round exit to Arsenal in the FA Cup and a fifth round loss at home to West Ham in the League Cup.\nTottenham's 2014/15 season\nTottenham appointed Mauricio Pochettino in the summer of 2014 and with Harry Kane on fantastic form, Spurs fared much better in 2014/15.\nThe Lilywhites finished fifth in the Premier League and lost out to Chelsea in the final of the League Cup, exiting the FA Cup in the fourth round and the Europa League in the last 32.\nTottenham's 2015/16 season\nLeicester City won the Premier League in 2015/16 and for much of the campaign, Tottenham were the Foxes' closest challengers.\nSpurs ultimately finished third after taking just a point from the final four matches, going out in the fifth round of the FA Cup, the third round of the League Cup and in the last 16 of the Europa League.\nTottenham's 2016/17 season\nUnbeaten in the Premier League at home in their last-ever season at White Hart Lane, Tottenham finished second in 2016/17, seven points behind champions Chelsea.\nSpurs were also beaten by the Blues in the FA Cup semi-finals, losing out to Gent in the Europa League after exiting the Champions League in the group stages and going out in round three of the League Cup.\nTottenham's 2017/18 season\nWith building work on their new stadium ongoing, Tottenham moved to Wembley for the 2017/18 season and adapted fairly well to their temporary home, finishing third in the Premier League.\nSpurs beat Real Madrid in the Champions league group stages and topped their group, but lost out to Juventus in the last 16.
