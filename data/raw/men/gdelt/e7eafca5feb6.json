Still, this doesn’t mean that the club should lose all hope when it comes to thinking about a new goalkeeper signing.\nAs relayed by The Peoples Person, United are leading the race to sign Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who won the 2022 World Cup with Argentina.\nGiven this latest turn of events, it appears that United will do well to continue their pursuit of the Argentine, particularly as they look to shore up their defence ahead of next season.\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
