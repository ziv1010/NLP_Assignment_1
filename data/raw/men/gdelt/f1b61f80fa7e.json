Don’t blame Spain for this, it happened in every country,” Ancelotti said at his pre-match press conference on Monday.\n“Vini is managing really well, he is focused on the game and loves to play football and this doesn’t affect on the pitch. When games are important we see the best of him and it is obviously going to be a big game tomorrow.\n“At the moment it is wonderful to be watching Vinicius as every football fan likes his quality.\n“They like to see Pedri, Gavi, (Kylian) Mbappe, (Erling) Haaland. Vinicius is up there with these players and we can enjoy quality players like that.”\nMadrid’s La Liga title challenge has faded since the World Cup break with Barcelona opening up an eight-point lead at the top of the table.\nThe Spanish giants often save their best for the latter stages of the Champions League, but have been dealt a blow with Aurelien Tchouameni and Toni Kroos not making the trip to England due to illness.\n“Without Kroos and Tchouameni we are forced to make changes we wouldn’t want,” added Ancelotti.\n“But it doesn’t bother me because there is a good feeling in the team and we have played well without them in the past.\n“Those that have come in have done well and we have confidence in them.”",
