  "body_text": "By Sports Reporter\nDYNAMOS coach Lloyd Chigowe says they are going to give it all this Sunday when they face Botswana’s Orapa United at Obed Itani Chulume Stadium in a CAF Confederations Cup match to be played in Francistown.\nThe match stands as the last hurdle between ‘The Glamour Boys’ and the competition’s group stages.\n“Supporters should come and rally behind us. This is the biggest team in Zimbabwe, which has always made an impact in Africa.\n“It is also the team that carries the hope of the nation,” said the Dynamos coach ahead of Sunday’s crucial encounter.\nDynamos are marking their return to continental football after nearly a decade absence.\nThe best that the Harare giants have done in the African safari was to reach the CAF Champions League final in 1998.\nDynamos are yet to concede a goal in the ongoing CAF Confederations campaign following a 1-0 aggregate win over ZESCO United last month in the first round.\nA win or draw on Sunday will propel Dembare to the group stages where they will be guaranteed to pocket US$400 000.\nLack of a CAF approved stadium in the country has forced Dynamos to host Orapa United in its own backyard, something which Chigowe has termed a disadvantage.\n“We have a 50-50 chance just like the home team, yes we are at home but being home away from home is a challenge.\n“But we will give it our all, to make sure that Dynamos makes it through to the mini league stage of the tournament,” added Chigowe.\nDembare will be without Valentine Kadonzvo in the coming fixture as he is attending schools’ examinations.\nKadonzvo made the difference during the first match against Orapa United last week after scoring the goal that gave Dembare the three points.",
