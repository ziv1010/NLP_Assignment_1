Rosenior’s appointment represents a very different approach, however.\nChelsea confirmed his arrival in a statement released on Tuesday morningwith the former full-back ‘extremely humbled and honoured’ to land the role.\nBut the club subtly underlined their lofty expectations will remain the same despite the new coach’s relative inexperience.\n‘Liam has shown that he can build teams with a clear way of playing while setting the highest standards with players on and off the pitch. While there will continue to be a focus on player development, the Club’s expectations and ambitions remain high,’ the statement said.\n‘Liam has the ability to get the best out of this squad quickly and joins us with the responsibility and the backing to ensure Chelsea continues to compete at the top level in all competitions this season and in seasons to come.’\nRosenior said: ‘My job is to protect that identity and create a team that reflects these values in every game we play as we continue winning trophies. To be entrusted with this role means the world to me and I want to thank all involved for the opportunity and faith in undertaking this job. I will give everything to bring the success this club deserves.\n‘I believe deeply in teamwork, unity, togetherness and working for one another, and those values will be at the heart of everything we do. They will be the foundation of our success.\n‘I am excited to work with this extremely talented group of players and staff, to build strong connections on and off the pitch, and to create an environment where everyone feels united and driven by the same goal.\n‘There is a real hunger to win, and I will give everything, every single day, to help this team compete and win at the very highest level to make everyone connected and proud to be a part of Chelsea Football Club.\n‘I want our fans to be proud of who we are and what we represent in every single game that we play. They are the soul of this enormous, historic and huge football club.\n‘I cannot wait to meet you all. I cannot wait to get started.’\nThe Italian had been appointed as manager in the summer of 2024, winning the UEFA Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup in his time in charge.\nA statement from the Blues read: ‘Chelsea Football Club and Head Coach Enzo Maresca have parted company.\n‘During his time at the Club, Enzo led the team to success in the UEFA Conference League and the FIFA Club World Cup.\n‘Those achievements will remain an important part of the Club’s recent history, and we thank him for his contributions to the Club.\n‘With key objectives still to play for across four competitions including qualification for Champions League football, Enzo and the Club believe a change gives the team the best chance of getting the season back on track.\n‘We wish Enzo well for the future.’\nRosenior’s coaching career\nHis playing career ended at Brighton in 2018 but he stayed on with the Seagulls, coaching the under-23 side.\nHe moved to Derby County as first team coach in 2019 and when Wayne Rooney became the boss in 2021, Rosenior stepped up to assistant manager.\nAfter Rooney’s departure in 2022, Rosenior was briefly interim manager.\nHis first top job was at Hull City, taking over in November 2022 and surprisingly being sacked at the end of the 2023/24 season despite finishing seventh in the Championship. The season before he took over, the Tigers finished 19th.\nMore Trending\nRosenior moved to France to take over at Strasbourg in July 2024, replacing Patrick Vieira, and finishing seventh in his first season.
