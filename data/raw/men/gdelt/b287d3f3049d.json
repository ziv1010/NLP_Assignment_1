It’s definitely the kind of positive result that takes some of the sting out of what has been a grueling work week. I’ll be spending most of the day getting my ducks in a row before moving tomorrow morning. But enough about that, let’s dive into today’s links!\nOrlando City Beats Nashville On the Road\nThe Lions are returning to Orlando with three points after winning 1-0 against Nashville SC in an Eastern Conference showdown. A goal right before halftime was enough, as the Lions survived despite Nashville’s potent attackers and an absurd amount of stoppage time. No team in the league has won more road games than Orlando’s eight. Orlando’s win further cemented its spot in second in the Eastern Conference. The Lions will play their penultimate match of the regular season on Saturday against the New England Revolution.\nMessiah Bright Part of Upcoming NWSL Written Series\nThe National Women’s Soccer League announced a new written series that will give a platform to six players to share more about their life on and off the field while covering topics such as mental health and motherhood. Orlando Pride forward Messiah Bright was one of the six selected and will give her perspective during her first year in the league. Veteran Jess Fishlock, NJ/NY Gotham FC midfielder Sinead Farrelly, and 2022 NWSL Rookie of the Year Naomi Girma are a few of the other players who will share their stories. The series kicked off with Chicago Red Stars defender Casey Krueger writing about her pregnancies and return to soccer.\nEastern Conference Playoff Picture Takes Shape\nThings have been tight in the Eastern Conference standings for quite some time, but this round of midweek matches added some clarity to where each team stands heading into the final few games. The Lions are three points above the third-place Philadelphia Union, which won 3-2 against Atlanta United. The Columbus Crew are in fourth after leapfrogging over the New England Revolution following a 2-1 win at Gillette Stadium.\nAs for the teams still fighting for a playoff spot, the Chicago Fire picked up a massive three points by beating Inter Miami 4-1 at home. The New York Red Bulls revived their playoff hopes with a surprising 2-1 win on the road against FC Cincinnati, while Charlotte FC is back in the thick of things after winning 3-0 against Toronto FC in a match that included a nice goal from Brecht Dejaegere.\nFIFA Announces 2030 World Cup Hosts\nThe 2030 World Cup will be unlike any other as FIFA announced that six countries across three continents will host the centennial edition of the tournament. Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay will all host games and automatically qualify for the 2030 World Cup. The opening match will take place in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo, which is where the inaugural World Cup’s final took place in 1930. I’m curious how the logistics of this will affect fans, as some may need to travel across continents to support their team. The bidding for the 2034 World Cup has also begun, with both Saudi Arabia and Australia throwing their hats into the ring.\nKeeping Up With the Champions League\nNewcastle United came up with a huge win in the Champions League group stage, beating Paris Saint-Germain 4-1 at home. The English club now sits at the top of a competitive Group F after AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund played to a scoreless draw in Germany. Atletico Madrid, Manchester City, and Barcelona also claimed victory. Shakhtar Donetsk may have had the most exciting win though, as the Ukrainian club battled back from a 2-0 deficit to Antwerp to win 3-2. Antwerp had a chance to equalize with the final kick of the game, but defender Toby Alderweireld missed his penalty.\nFree Kicks\n- Cucho Hernandez was named MLS Player of the Month after recording eight goals and an assist for the Columbus Crew in September.\n- D.C. United’s Mateusz Klich won MLS Goal of the Matchday for his equalizer against the Vancouver Whitecaps. I’m not a huge fan of it winning due to how much of a role the deflection played into winding up in the net, but it was a good strike regardless.\n- Rob Page, the manager of the Welsh national team, stated that Wrexham forward Paul Mullin is a step away from joining Wales.\n- Many Americans struggled in Champions League action, but forward Haji Wright scored a winner in Coventry City’s 1-0 result against Blackburn Rovers in the English Football League Championship.\nI hope you all enjoyed today’s links! It’s a little bittersweet as domestic soccer seasons are winding down, so let’s all make sure to enjoy the beautiful game while it’s here. Have a great Thursday!\nLion Links\nLion Links: 2/13/26\nHannah Anderson challenging herself in Orlando, Luana called up by Brazil, broadcasting changes ahead of MLS season, and more.\nToday is Friday the 13th, so make sure to steer clear of black cats, ladders, and any other bad omens out there. Orlando City’s season opener is next weekend and the last thing we need to do is accumulate bad luck before the Lions take the field. Let’s keep our fingers crossed and dive into today’s links!\nHannah Anderson Prepares for First Season in Orlando\nDefender Hannah Anderson was drafted by the Chicago Stars in the third round of the 2024 NWSL Draft and spent two seasons there before the Pride traded for her in January for $70,000 in intraleague funds. Chicago conceded twice as many goals as Orlando last season, and now Anderson is challenging herself with an opportunity to improve as a defender with the Pride.\n“I don’t really look at it as pressure, I think it’s an opportunity,” she said. “The challenge is what’s going to help me grow. When you’re never challenged, you can’t grow. It’s kind of like how you see that challenge. Yeah, it could be pressure, but I also think it’s exciting to be a part of a group that’s been there, because the experience will help you get there again.”\nThe 24-year-old also spoke on what it’s like to go up against Orlando’s attacking stars in training, as well as her decision to join the Pride while engaged to Chicago Cubs pitcher Jack Neely. With Emily Sams on the other side of the country, hopefully Anderson can have a breakout year to help fill the void.\nLuana Returns to Brazil National Team\nOrlando Pride midfielder Luana was called up for Brazil’s friendlies against Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Mexico in a few weeks. It’s great to see her back with the national team after all she’s been through and Head Coach Arthur Elias spoke on her return.\n“Calling up Luana is a joy, but the greater joy was when she overcame cancer, a disease diagnosed during a period with the National Team. It was a huge shock for all of us. Luana has an incredible history in football, she is a woman of great strength, who showed this and set many examples for those around her,” he celebrated.\nShe will bring some experience to a Brazil roster that doesn’t include any other Pride players, although former Pride player Adriana was called up. Brazil has already secured qualification for the 2027 Women’s World Cup as its host, so the focus will be on playing quality opponents until then.\nGetting Ready for More MLS on Apple TV\nWe’re gearing up for the fourth MLS season streamed through Apple TV and the biggest difference this time around is that MLS Season Pass is a thing of the past. It’s a major boon for fans, as all games will be through an Apple TV subscription rather than a separate platform at an additional cost. For those of us who like to watch MLS games at our favorite bar, an agreement with EverPass Media should increase the reach of the league in commercial venues. Saturday night matches with increased production value, announcers returning to the actual stadiums to call games, and the removal of the Spanish version of MLS 360 are some of the other notable changes heading into this season.\nNottingham Forest Fires Manager…Again\nJust a day after Thomas Franks was fired by Tottenham, Nottingham Forest sacked Sean Dyche following the club’s scoreless draw with Wolverhampton this week. Dyche joined the club in October and was just nominated for Manager of the Month for his team’s results in January. However, Forest is just three points above the relegation zone and has now fired its third coach of the season. Vitor Pereira will reportedly replace Dyche as the club’s fourth coach of the season, which would be a league record. ESPN dove into how English Premier League teams that made multiple firings in the same season performed and it’s grim news for Forest.\nFree Kicks\n- Orlando City goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau went under the microscope to field a variety of questions. I’m pretty interested in why Duncan McGuire would be the first person he’d call if he found a dead body in his hotel room.\n- Construction is underway at Camping World Stadium as it begins its $400 million renovation to expand seating and improve the facilities.\n- Atletico Madrid put Barcelona to the sword in the first leg of their Copa del Rey semifinal, winning 4-0 thanks to four goals in the first half.\n- Raheem Sterling has joined Feyenoord as a free agent after a mutual agreement with Chelsea to terminate his contract last season.\n- The draw for the UEFA Nations League was completed and Spain was drawn into a group with England, Croatia, and the Czech Republic.\nThat’s all I have for you on this fine Friday. I hope you all have a lucky day and that all of your Valentine’s Day plans this weekend go off without a hitch!\nLion Links\nLion Links: 2/12/26\nOrlando City wins preseason game, Nolan Miller readies for rookie season, Hailie Mace settling in with the Orlando Pride, and more.\nHow’s it going, Mane Landers? It’s been a pretty hectic for me so far this week, but it’s nothing some ABBA and baking can’t help with. The return of Orlando soccer is right around the corner and I’m looking forward to seeing our favorite players back in action. Until then though, let’s enjoy today’s links from around the soccer world!\nOrlando City Wins Preseason Game\nAlthough Orlando City continues to keep most of the details of its preseason results close to the chest, we at least know that the Lions beat FC Cincinnati 3-2 in Tampa. Cincy got the scoring started with a goal from Evander, but Orlando came out swinging in the second half by scoring three goals in just five minutes. Martin Ojeda bagged a brace, with 20-year-old winger Tiago maintaining his solid preseason form with a goal as well. It’s a nice result and the Lions will play their final preseason game Saturday against the Colorado Rapids in a match open to season ticket members.\nNolan Miller Ready for Rookie Season\nDrafted by the Lions with the ninth overall pick in the 2026 MLS SuperDraft, Nolan Miller spoke on how he fit the profile Orlando’s coaching staff was looking for in a center back in the draft. The 21-year-old can play out of the back and possesses leadership qualities as evidenced by deciding to stay at Michigan to help build the program into a Big Ten championship contender as its captain. Signed to a first-team contract earlier this month, Miller discussed how he’s mentally prepared for his rookie season in the MLS.\n“I’ll tell you this, I’m the biggest guy in my mindset,” he said. “If you start thinking, ‘Wow, this is a big jump,’ it will be a big jump. But I tell myself I belong every day. I belong at this level. I know I belong. I’m mentally there, I’m physically there, and if I’m not there today, I’m going to be there tomorrow.”\nHailie Mace Finding Her Footing in Orlando\nOrlando Pride defender Hailie Mace is the most notable addition to the Pride’s roster this off-season and she spoke on how she’s settling in with Orlando after a terrific season with the Kansas City Current. Like the Current, the Pride have boasted one of the league’s best defenses in recent years, and Mace fits the team’s defensive mindset. That being said, Head Coach Seb Hines could have her making more of an impact on offense in the City Beautiful.\n“Seb wants me to join the attack more and play through the lines and those sort of things,” she said. “So I think he’s challenging me in that aspect. I would have liked to be more involved in the attack last year, but that wasn’t my role on the team. Coming here, having the freedom to join the attack and Seb encouraging me to do it, it’s nice and fun, and I’m excited to be able to do that.”\nShe also talked about how going up against attackers like Marta and Barbra Banda in training will only make her a better player. It’s hardly the first time Mace is adapting to a new team environment in her career, so hopefully she can be a difference maker for the Pride this season.\nNWSL Star Midfielders On the Move\nIt seems we’re still in the NWSL’s silly season, as the Current made a pair of major trades. American attacking midfielder Croix Bethune is no longer with the Washington Spirit after being traded to the Current in exchange for $900,000 in intra-league transfer funds and $100,000 in Allocation Money. Bethune requested the move according to Spirit President of Soccer Operations Haley Carter and gives the Current a young and talented playmaker.\nThat’s not all though. The Current also traded defensive midfielder Claire Hutton to Bay FC in exchange for $1.1 million in intra-league transfer funds. The 20-year-old was a finalist for NWSL Rookie of the Year in 2024 and started 22 games for the Current last season, making the NWSL Best XI First Team.\nFree Kicks\n- Gustavo Caraballo scored a great goal in Orlando City B’s scrimmage against the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n- Orlando City’s latest jersey placed 16th in CBS Sports’ rankings of the new MLS jerseys for the upcoming season. It’s nice to not be at the bottom of the list, where basic kits from Inter Miami and Nashville SC are joined by messy tries by St. Louis City and the Houston Dynamo.\n- A big change is coming to the SheBelieves Cup, as any matches that end in a draw will now go to a penalty shootout for an additional point. There will also be new rules regarding rosters, with teams now able to field 26-player rosters for the tournament.\n- U.S. soccer legend Abby Wambach announced that she is leaving Casey Wasserman’s talent agency and called for him to resign following the reveal of correspondence between him and Ghislaine Maxwell in the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n- Lionel Messi did not participate in training due to a muscle strain in his hamstring. The club’s friendly against Puerto Rico was postponed to Feb. 26, which is just a few days before its match against Orlando City on March 1.\n- Tottenham sacked Thomas Frank amid a disastrous season that has the club just five points above the relegation zone.\nThat’s all I have for you all this around. I hope you all have a wonderful Thursday and rest of your week!\nLion Links\nLion Links: 2/11/26\nNew Orlando City kit drops, Orlando City and Orlando Pride preseasons, MLS club valuations, and more.\nWelcome to Wednesday, Mane Landers. I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling a bit anxious about the upcoming season. I think it’s because we don’t know much of what is going on. We’re only a few weeks away from the first match for goodness sake. Hopefully, we’ll see some more signings for both clubs, but until then let’s get to the links.\nOrlando City’s New Kit\nOrlando City dropped the new Sunken Treasure secondary kit yesterday, and it is a stunner. This is the first time the club has used gold as the primary color on a jersey. It looks great with the purple shorts, and the purple stripes. There are some great details like the coin on the collar and sublimated lion head on the chest. This is truly one of the better kits that Orlando City has introduced. The club produced a great reveal video. Check it out.\nOrlando Preseasons\nThere’s not a ton of information to convey regarding Orlando City’s and the Orlando Pride’s preseasons. That seems to be purposeful on the part of the club, but a little news did slip out via social media. New center back Iago is fully participating in practice.\nWe also learned that goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau is back in training after missing last week. Of course, the Pride got in the action as well with various players trying to run drills. I’ll let you judge how well they did.\nMLS Club Valuations\nMLS clubs are increasing in value, including Orlando City. Sportico released the list of all MLS club valuations (paywall). Unsurprisingly, the top five were all big market teams with Inter Miami leading the way. When the Wilf family purchased Orlando City, they paid between $400 and $450 million. Now it is estimated to be worth approximately $565 million. That’s pretty good growth.\nChris Mueller’s Lost Year\nWe missed this last November, but former Orlando City attacker Chris Mueller had a tough time of things in 2025. The player was diagnosed with pericarditis. It meant that he couldn’t sleep laying down, let alone play or practice. He is now on the other side of it and has a new contract. It was a year of lessons for Mueller, and in typical fashion he has bounced back stronger.\nFree Kicks\n- The Lions weren’t the only team to announce new jerseys. There were 16 other clubs that did the same, though none are as nice as Orlando City’s new kit.\n- The USMNT U-17 squad has secured a spot in the U-17 World Cup. The berth came after a 1-1 draw against the Dominican Republic.\n- Former England, Chelsea, and Juventus forward Eni Aluko has reignited her debate over female pundits in soccer.\n- Defender Noahkai Banks will not be switching from the USMNT to Germany despite contact from the German federation.\nThat will do it for today, me hearties. I hope you have a wonderful day.
