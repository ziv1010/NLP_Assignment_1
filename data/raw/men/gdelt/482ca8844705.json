Established to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy away from oil dependence, PIF has strategically invested in various industries globally, including technology, real estate, and sports.\nIn 2021, the PIF acquired an 80% stake in Newcastle United as part of a consortium, with the goal of transforming the club into a competitive powerhouse.\nUnder PIF ownership, Newcastle United has witnessed a dramatic transformation, both on and off the pitch. The club has gone from flirting with relegation to becoming a force in the Premier League and European football. Backed by over €450 million in spending across six transfer windows, Newcastle have brought in top talent like Alexander Isak, Bruno Guimarães, and Sven Botman.\nThis investment has paid dividends, with manager Eddie Howe guiding the team to a fourth-place finish in the Premier League in the 2022/23 season, securing Champions League qualification.\nThe strict FFP and PSR rules which has not allowed the club to splash the cash and compete with the top rivals which sparked rumours that the owners may consider backing out of the project, but the recent developments suggest otherwise.\nNewcastle planning to upgrade the club’s current training facilities\nNot only are they buying more land in Newcastle but also making big investments in the city as well as planning to upgrade the club’s current training facilities with a new state-of-the-art training centre.\nA recent report confirmed that the Tyneside club are looking to expand Darsley Park and bring it in line with the elite clubs in the Premier League as the Magpies continue to close the gap bit by bit.\nFor Newcastle United, this latest development will come as a boost as it is a reassuring sign of the owners’ intent to remain fully invested in the club’s future. The potential airport stake acquisition, coupled with ongoing investments in the club and city, reinforces the notion that the Saudi-backed project is far from slowing down.",
