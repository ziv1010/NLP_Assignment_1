  "body_text": "Ange Postecoglou snapped at a reporter who brought up a Manchester United-related question during the post-match press conference following Tottenham Hotspur’s 2-0 victory over Bodo/Glimt (5-1 on aggregate).\nLike United, Tottenham have struggled domestically, but both sides now have the chance to qualify for the Champions League when they meet in the Europa League final later this month.\nUnited booked their spot in the final after beating Athletic Club 4-1 on Thursday and 7-1 on aggregate.\nIn the presser, Matt Law of The Telegraph asked Postecoglou, “Manchester United have constantly said this competition won’t save their season – managers have said it, players have said it.”\n“Would it save Tottenham’s season, is it different for Tottenham?”\nAn exasperated Postecoglou fired back, “I don’t care – why do I care what Man United think? Why is that relevant to me?”\n“Ask the Man United manager why he says that. Me, I’ve said all along that this is important.”\nThe Australian coach was then asked, “What does it mean for Tottenham’s season then?”\nHe answered, “You probably know better than me and probably followed this club longer than I have. What do you think a trophy would do for this club?”\nThe reporter replied, “Massive.”\nPostecoglou continued, “Exactly right, so the question answers itself. But what’s happening right now is that people are fearing that, that it actually might happen.”\n“Because it might happen they’re thinking, ‘Let’s see how we can tear it down somehow, diminish it somehow by saying it’s been a poor season, we don’t deserve this, we don’t deserve that’, or somehow comparing us to Man United.”\n\"Why do I care what Man Utd think?!\" 😡\nAnge Postecoglou wants to concentrate on his Spurs team, and their focus, ahead of the Europa League final 👀\n📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/5YNY5J5f20\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) May 8, 2025\nHeading into the weekend’s Premier League fixtures, United are in 15th place, with Tottenham just a point behind them in 16th.\nFeatured image Justin Setterfield via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
