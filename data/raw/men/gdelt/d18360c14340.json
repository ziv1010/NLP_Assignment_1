  "body_text": "Graeme Souness has named his ‘favourite’ player in the Premier League, overlooking the likes of Mohamed Salah, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka.\nWith 42 goal involvements in 28 games, Salah may be enjoying a potentially record-breaking campaign, but Souness believes another Liverpool player has been the pick of the bunch.\n‘It is easy to pinpoint Mo Salah for his creativity and goals, to hail Luis Diaz for his pace and energy or to laud Virgil van Dijk for his elegance and composure,’ Souness told the Daily Mail.\n‘But the one Liverpool player that I’d pick, even above those this year, would be Alexis Mac Allister.’\nMac Allister has enjoyed two impressive seasons at Anfield following a £55m move from fellow Premier League club Brighton in 2023.\nThe 26-year-old, a World Cup winner with Argentina, has helped Liverpool open up a 13-point gap at the top of the Premier League and reach the knockout stages of the Champions League.\n‘I’ve long believed that the best footballers come from Argentina,’ Souness added.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

It would be difficult for any manager not to favour him.\n‘He looks like he has the best of attitudes. Even when Bruno Guimaraes left one on him at Anfield the other night, his unruffled reaction says everything about him.\n‘I bet the manager never has to speak to him. He is brave, full of endeavour and has a fantastic appetite for doing the hard yards.\n‘I like him best when he is pushing further forward making mischief. I’m an enormous fan. The £35m plus add-ons that Liverpool paid Brighton for him looks like the bargain of recent times.\nMore Trending\n‘Whatever the bonuses, just sign the cheque now because he’s worth every penny.\n‘My only disappointment, is that he looks Scottish, has a wonderful Scottish name but he doesn’t wear a Scotland jersey. Saying that, it must have been a hard choice: Scotland or Argentina…’\nLiverpool have the weekend off following their shock FA Cup defeat to Plymouth Argyle but return to Premier League action next Saturday against bottom-placed Southampton.\nWhile the Reds are closing in on their 20th league title, Southampton are aiming to avoid the Premier League record for the lowest points tally across a season.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: John Terry explains why Chelsea have suffered a ‘drop off’ under Enzo Maresca\nMORE: IFAB confirm new rule that will punish goalkeepers for timewasting\nMORE: Theo Walcott urges Arsenal to sign former Chelsea star in shock move",
