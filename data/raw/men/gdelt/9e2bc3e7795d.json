Coaching staff were quick to applaud Kostoulas when, surrounded by opponents close to the technical areas at the Amex Stadium, he held the ball up to earn a throw-in.\nHead coach Fabian Hurzeler has given Kostoulas time to settle in since a £30million move from Olympiacos at the start of the summer transfer window. The size of the fee hints at the potential of the raw teenager. His speedy elevation to the scoresheet and a finish in training during his adaptation period evoke memories of Sergio Aguero, who was idolised by Kostoulas growing up in his home country.\nBrilliant from Babis! 😮💨👌\n— Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) September 11, 2025\n“I used to watch Manchester City, I liked Aguero a lot,” said Kostoulas, speaking exclusively to The Athletic before his recent Premier League debut. “They won a lot of trophies, but mostly I watched Aguero. Because, as a kid, I was always playing with older guys. And I was always short, and he was a short striker. So, I was imagining that I was Aguero. He would take the ball, turn, and finish. He had a very good shot.”\nKostoulas has since developed into a 6ft1in (185cm) striker, but he is still a kid, jumping into the Premier League after six goals in 21 appearances in one season in the Greek Super League at Olympiacos. “I watched the Premier League more than other leagues,” he said. “It’s a target for every player. I dreamed of coming to the Premier League. I just didn’t think things would come so fast!“\nThe connection to renowned Argentinian strikers for Kostoulas does not stop with Aguero. His nickname, Babis (a shortened version of ‘Babistuta’), is said to derive from comparisons in playing style to Gabriel Bastituta. “That is just for fun, a joke,” Kostoulas said. “I have only seen Batistuta on YouTube. I don’t remember him playing. That was before my time. My name (in Greek) is Charalambos, and Babis comes from that.”\nAdvertisement\nKostoulas’s father, Thanassis, achieved legendary status with Olympiacos, Athens-based giants of Greek football, during an era when Batistuta was still a headline act for Fiorentina, Roma and Argentina. Kostoulas senior, a central defender, won seven league titles and two Greek Cups in an eight-year stint between 1999 and 2007, which included facing Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus across 15 Champions League appearances. He played for another seven years after Olympiakos with Skoda Xanthi, Asteras Tripolis and his first club Olympiacos Volos.\n“I watched him from the stadium, but most of the years that he played, I wasn’t even born,” Kostoulas said. “I have watched many replays on TV. Football was different then. He was a strong defender. I was proud watching him.”\nKostoulas’ older brother, Konstantinos, also plays as a central defender in the Greek Super League with OFI.\nSo, why is he a forward? “We always played against each other, with me the attacker,” said Kostoulas. “We also played against my father, but he was easy on me when I was a kid. My grandfather from my mum’s side played locally in Greece as an attacker, so maybe I get it from him.”\nKostoulas had a lot to live up to following his father’s stellar career with Olympiacos, but he wasted no time making a name for himself as he graduated through the youth system. He became the club’s youngest-ever debutant as a 15-year-old for the B team in the second tier in 2023. At 17, he led the under 19s to the 2024 UEFA Youth League title — the Champions League equivalent at youth level — with five goals and two assists in nine outings.\nOlympiacos entered the 2024-25 campaign as winners of the Europa Conference League. Kostoulas took promotion to the senior ranks in his stride after manager Jose Luis Mendilibar turned to the wonderkid catching the eye for the juniors. He made history again, becoming the club’s youngest ever league scorer at 17 years, five months and 11 days, heading the opening goal in a 3-2 derby victory last October against PAOK in an intimidating atmosphere at the Toumba Stadium. Olympiacos ended up completing a first domestic league and cup double for three years to celebrate their 100th anniversary.\nAdvertisement\nPressure, what pressure? “I was never thinking about it like that,” said Kostoulas. “I was always wanting to become a champion in Greece with the club where my father played. I knew the club must win the championship. I was sure if I played that I would have the chance to win it.”\nThe chance to join Brighton in a deal which could rise to over £31m with add-ons overcame the emotional pull of staying put. “It was difficult to change everything, I was there many years,” said Kostoulas. “I have supported the club all my life, but in one year in the first team I did what I had to do. The chance came for me for the next step and I had to take it for my future.\n“Brighton give young players a chance and develop them. I knew of them. I didn’t watch them game by game, but I had seen some games. Also, they played in Europe two years ago against a Greek team (AEK Athens in the group stage of the Europa League). I didn’t know anything about Brighton as a place, by the sea. When the deal got closer, they showed me everything. The training facilities are great. I walk a lot on the beach, on the seafront. It’s nice.”\nThe fee for Kostoulas is comparable to the price paid to Watford two years ago for Joao Pedro, who was 21 at that time. Younger and less experienced than the now 24-year-old Brazilian forward sold to Chelsea in July for a package that could reach £60m, Kostoulas does not feel weighed down by expectation. He is similar to Joao Pedro in his adaptability to different roles and winning mentality.\n“I don’t think about it (the fee) a lot,” Kostoulas said. “Brighton have trusted this money on me and I’m ready to show my worth. I have this passion that I cannot lose. I will give my best on the pitch to win.\n“Mostly last year, I played like a second striker. I like it maybe more, I can be in the two positions (No 9 or No. 10). The target for me is to become better at everything, to help the team achieve the targets that we have this season and to enjoy all of it, play many games and, of course, to score. This is why I’m here, what I like most, like every striker.”",
