We've got you covered. Brighton vs Luton is not being shown in the UK. Brit abroad? Use a VPN to watch the Premier League with your subscription from anywhere.\nBrighton are enjoying one of the most remarkable periods in their history, and manager Roberto De Zerbi is a big reason for that. The Italian gaffer has transformed the Seagulls from a pragmatic side into one that is expansive and produces free-flowing attacks, and they'll certainly fancy their chances against Luton.\nThat could be a lot tougher than expected, though, with the Hatters' fairy tale story set to continue in the Premier League. Many are tipping Luton to be relegated at the first time of asking - something they'll be eager to prove wrong come May.\nKick-off is at 3pm BST. Make sure you know how to watch the Premier League wherever you are.\nTeam news\nRoberto De Zerbi has named the following Brighton starting 11: (4-4-2) Jason Steele; Pascal Gross, Lewis Dunk (captain), Jan Paul van Hecke, Pervis Estupinan; Solly March, James Milner, Mahmoud Dahoud, Kaoru Mitoma; Joao Pedro, Danny Welbeck\nRob Edwards has selected the following Luton starting 11: (3-5-2) Thomas Kaminski; Tom Lockyer (captain), Mads Andersen, Amari'i Bell; Issa Kabore, Pelly-Ruddock Mpanzu, Marvelous Nakamba, Tahith Chong, Ryan Giles; Carlton Morris, Elijah Adebayo\nForm\nBrighton are preparing for their first season of European football in their history, and are looking (somehow) to build upon their exceptional sixth-place finish in the Premier League last term.\nLuton Town are back in the top tier of English football after dropping down to the National League 14 years ago and climbing their way back, and are looking to enjoy every minute of their return.\nReferee\nDavid Coote will be the referee for Brighton vs Luton. His assistants will be Mark Scholes and Timothy Wood, with John Busby the fourth official. Robert Jones is the VAR, with Wade Smith the assistant VAR.\nStadium\nBrighton vs Luton will be played at the 30,666-capacity Amex Stadium in Brighton.\nKick-off and channel\nBrighton vs Luton kick-off is at 3pm BST on Saturday 12 August in the UK. The game is not being shown live in the UK.\nIn the US, kick-off time is 10am ET / 7am PT. The match will be shown on NBC in the US. See below for international broadcast options.\nVPN guide\nUse a VPN to watch Premier League football from outside your country\nIf you’re out of the country for a Premier League fixture, then you won't be able to watch on your domestic streaming service as usual. The broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!) and blocks you from watching it. You can use a VPN to get around that, though, without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and will let you watch. And all the info going between is entirely encrypted, anonymous and safe – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there. For the Premier League, FourFourTwo currently recommends:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS5 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price. Go get it!\nInternational Premier League TV rights\n• UK: Sky Sports and TNT Sports are the two main players, but Amazon also have a slice of the pie in 2023/24.\n• USA: NBC Sports Group are the Premier League rights holders, with the Peacock Premium streaming platform showing all 380 games in the season. A fuboTV subscription also lets you watch every game.\n• Canada: The way to watch Premier League football in 2023/24 is fuboTV, which has exclusive rights to all the action.\n• Australia: Optus Sport will screen every game of the Premier League season.\n• New Zealand: Sky Sport are serving up all 380 games – plus various highlights and magazine shows throughout the week, as well as the Champions League.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nRyan is a staff writer for FourFourTwo, joining the team full-time in October 2022.
