Here are some of Kerr’s best moments of 2023.\n1) Gets engaged to Kristy Mewis\nFirst of all, Sam Kerr got engaged this year. Kerr shared the beautiful moment she got down on one knee to ask the love of her life to marry her on social media in November.\nIn an Instagram post to her 1.8 million followers, the 30-year-old simply wrote, “September 1st, 2023,” sharing three snaps of the adorable moment she proposed to US soccer star Kristie Mewis. Wearing matching teal outfits the power couple declared their love to the world.\nThe three pictures showed the Perth-born sporting icon proposing to a surprised Mewis, a close-up of them holding hands showing off the stunning ring and Kerr’s reaction to Mewis saying, “yes”, sporting a huge smile and a hand up in the air.\nMewis revealed the news they were engaged in an interview with People on Thursday, November 9.\n2) Immortalised as a Lego figurine\nWhile Kerr has achieved plenty in a high-flying soccer career that has taken her from Perth to London and the international stage, this is one of our favourite moments this year.\nThe Aussie superstar was immortalised in brick form as a Lego character, alongside legendary United States national team striker Megan Rapinoe and Japanese pair Yuki Nagasato and Asisat Oshoala.\nIt is part of Lego’s Play Unstoppable campaign, promoting the “limitless potential of girls” and encouraging them to “play without boundaries”.\n3) Becomes second-fastest to score 50 WSL goals\nKerr achieved another impressive milestone in her Chelsea career, becoming the second-fastest to the landmark of 50 goals in England’s Women’s Super League in April.\nShe kicked a brilliant second-half strike in the champions’ 3-0 win at Aston Villa. The 56th-minute goal was another of her specials, as she cut inside before poking the ball high into the corner past Villa keeper Hannah Hampton, who later made a smart save to stop her from doubling her tally.\nKerr was lavished with praise after her cleverly directed toe-poke finish enabled her to reach the half-century in just 62 WSL games. Only Arsenal’s Dutch great Vivienne Mediema, who got there at a rate of a goal a game, has achieved the feat quicker.\n— With files from Ian Chadband / AAP\n4) The new WA State Football Centre is named in her honour\nKerr received a top honour in October when the new WA State Football Centre was officially named after her.\nShe opened Football West’s $50 million centre of excellence, which Premier Roger Cook announced would be known as the Sam Kerr Football Centre, on October 27.\nIn front of approximately 4000 eager fans who gathered in Queens Park to enjoy a community festival to celebrate the opening, Kerr was joined on stage by several of her Matildas teammates, including fellow World Cup stars Caitlin Foord, Mackenzie Arnold and Alanna Kennedy.\nKerr admitted she was taken aback and called it a career highlight while expressing her delight at being able to receive the honour in front of her family and friends.\n“It’s pretty crazy, to be honest, I haven’t wrapped my head around it, but I’m a proud West Aussie, so this is right up there with one of the proudest moments of my career,” she said.\n— With files from Ben Smith / The West Australian\n5) Kicks a spectacular hat-trick for Chelsea\nEmma Hayes praised an “80 per cent fit” Kerr after her stunning hat-trick helped Chelsea to a 4-1 Champions League win against Paris FC at Stamford Bridge in late November.\nAt the time, Kerr had been easing back to fitness after missing most of the World Cup with injury and had made a modest start to the Women’s Super League season with two goals.\nBut against Paris, she ensured her side’s European campaign began in earnest following a controversial draw with Real Madrid, though the result had looked in doubt when the visitors levelled through Thea Greboval’s header before half-time.\nThat cancelled out Kerr’s opener which she had prodded in on the half-hour mark after getting between goalkeeper and defender to turn home Lauren James’s superb right-footed cross.\nShe added quick-fire goals early in the second period to put down Paris’ resistance, the first a far-post finish from Johanna Rytting Kaneryd’s low ball in before an effort that looped over the head of goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie.\n— With files from Robert O’Connor / AAP\n6) Makes a young Perth fan’s day with selfie\nThis is one of Kerr’s sweetest moments of the year. She made a fan from Perth very happy in October when she called out to the young girl from her car so she could run over to take a photo with her.\nThe video of the moment, posted to the Matildas’ Instagram, shows a cheery Kerr leaning out of the window of her car as she leaves Optus Stadium and calls out to a young fan.\n“Come on quick. We’ll do a photo,” Kerr shouts.\nThe young girl runs over and poses for a photo with the soccer star and thanks her.\n“Thank you,” the young girl says.\nKerr suggests for the fan to take a selfie as well.\n7) Runner-up in UEFA’s Player of the Year Awards\nKerr’s magnificent European season, capped back home by her striking late contribution to Australia’s World Cup push, was rewarded with her being named runner-up behind Spain’s Aitani Bonmati in UEFA’s Player of the Year awards.\nKerr finished second between two Spanish Women’s World Cup winners, Bonmati and third-placed Olga Carmona.\nThe acknowledgement was a reward for another exceptional campaign for the Chelsea striker whose goals helped the Blues lift the women’s FA Cup and Super League ‘double’ in England before her injury-hit but still impressive showing at the World Cup, where she led the Matildas to the semi-finals.\n— With files from Ian Chadband / AAP\nMagnificent season\nSportSam Kerr’s superb honour at UEFA awards\n8) Puts on a show with Nikki Webster\nAs Brisbane fans came out in the thousands to celebrate the Matildas back in August, the Aussie team were surprised with a special performance by one of their favourite singers.\nEmerging as the star of the Sydney 2000 Olympics, singer Nikki Webster joined the Matildas on stage at Brisbane’s Riverstage for a public celebration following the success of the FIFA World Cup.\nThe Matildas had been blasting the singer’s triple-platinum song Strawberry Kisses in their dressing room throughout the entire tournament.\nThe team were seen singing along with Webster, with captain Sam Kerr taking centre stage to join in the chorus and even sharing the microphone with the Aussie icon.\n— With files from Aisling Brennan / Newswire\nWorld Cup\nNewsMatildas joined by surprise star\n9) Scores stunning hat-trick in Philippines clash\nHometown hero Kerr and Arsenal star Caitlin Foord both scored hat-tricks when the Matildas all but guaranteed passage to the next round of Olympic qualifying with an 8-0 rout of the Philippines in Perth in October.\nIn front of a sellout crowd of 59,155 at Optus Stadium, Kerr and Foord scored first-half doubles as Australia took a 5-0 lead into the break. Kerr secured her hat-trick just 24 seconds into the second half when she headed home a pinpoint cross from Mary Fowler for her 68th goal from 127 internationals.\nThe result thrust the Matildas to the top of Group A on six points, meaning all they needed was a draw against Taiwan at HBF Park to guarantee progression to the final stage of qualification in February.\n— With files from Jake Santa Maria\nGoals goals goals\nMatildasEvery goal from the Matildas massive qualifying win\n10) Crowned Asian Women’s Player of the Year\nKerr was named Asia’s Women’s Player of the Year.\nMatildas and Chelsea forward Kerr was named Asia’s best for the second time, having previously been crowned the confederation’s leading female player in 2017.\nHer year began with the golden boot for her seven-goal haul at the 2022 Asian Cup in India, while at club level Kerr helped Chelsea to the 2022/23 Women’s Super League and FA Cup double.\nShe became the third woman to claim the award more than once, joining Japanese duo Aya Miyama and Homare Sawa as a multiple title-holders.\n— With files from AAP\n11) Narrowly missed out on world soccer’s top prize\nKerr narrowly missed out on world soccer’s top individual prize, finishing second in the Ballon d’Or voting behind Barcelona and Spain midfielder Aitana Bonmati back in October.\nIt was the third time Chelsea and Australia forward Kerr had come agonisingly close to the prestigious award, having also finished in the top three in 2021 and 2022. She was the only Matildas player to finish in the top 10 for the award, with Real Madrid winger Hayley Raso ranked 17th by voters.\n— Files from Jake Santa Maria",
