Chanaka said that the first fuel shipment of China’s Sinopec, will arrive in the country early next month and that steps will be taken to replace the fuel price formula with a maximum retail price (MRP) that will be stipulated by the government, thereby creating a fuel competitiveness that benefits the country.\nHe expressed these views today (23) during a press conference themed ‘Collective Path to a Stable Country’ held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC).\nLatest News\nLandslide Early Warnings issued to the Districts of Kandy and Nuwara Eliya extended\nThe landslide early warnings issued to the Districts of Kandy and Nuwara Eliya by the Landslide Early Warning Center of the National Building Research Organisation [NBRO] have been extended until 0600 hrs on the 14th of February 2026.\nAccordingly,\nThe Level II [AMBER] landslide early warnings issued to the Divisional Secretaries Divisions and surrounding areas of Walapane and Nildandahinna in the Nuwara Eliya district and\nthe Level I [YELLOW] landslide early warnings issued to the Divisional Secretaries Division and surrounding areas of Pathahewaheta in the Kandy district have been extended till 0600AM on Saturday [14]\nLatest News\nAryansh Sharma, Sohaib Khan power UAE to thrilling win over Canada\nAryansh Sharma and Sohaib Khan fired Unitrd Arab Emirates to a hard-fought five wicket win against Canada in Delhi. It was UAE’s second win in the competition, after they beat Namibia in the 2022 edition of the T20 World Cup. Aryansh and Sohaib did justice to Junaid Siddique’s five-wicket haul which restricted Canada to 150 for 7.\nUAE were themselves down in the dumps at 66 for 4, before this pair added 84 of the 85 runs required at that stage. With eight needed from the last over, Aryansh struck a six off the first ball and then took a single. Sohaib top edged Jaskarandeep Singh to fall with UAE needing one off three balls before Muhammad Arfan scored the winning run.\nUAE however were nowhere near a win when left-arm spinner Saad Bin Zafar took 3 for 14 to put Canada a strong position by the 13th over of the chase.\nKaleem Sana had the UAE captain Muhammad Waseem caught at midwicket for four in the third over. Zafar then removed the other dangerman, Alishan Sharafu, in the seventh over to give Canada the early advantage. Sharafu couldn’t clear Nicholas Kirton at covers and fell for five.\nZafar was stingy and kept his subtle change of pace going, removing Mayank Kumar for four in the 11th over. Kumar’s intention to belt him down the ground only found Sana at long-on. In his next over, Zafar had Harshit Kaushik cagut at deep midwicket.\nUAE had their backs to the wall as they needed 56 runs in the last four overs. Sohaib hit Dilon Heyliger for two sixes and a four. He first smoked him over midwicket for a maximum, followed by a lofted shot over mid-off for four, and a six straight into the sight-screen. After the 17-run over, Sohaib then got stuck into Jaskarandeep with a four and a six off the first two balls of the 18th over.\nHe then cracked two more fours to start Sana’s penultimate over, before the left-arm quick’s beamer hurt wicketkeeper Shreyas Movva. Another top edged boundary and a straight hit for two got Sohaib to his half-century off just 28 balls, leaving UAE eight to win from the last over.\nThe 33-year-old Siddique began UAE’s push when he had Dilpreet Bajwa caught at mid-off in the second over for 11. Yuvraj Samra mistimed a pull to mid-on in Siddique’s next over. When Muhammad Jawadullah had Nicholas Kirton caught behind in the sixth over, UAE gained a stronghold in the game.\nSiddique returned with three more wickets in his late spell. He started off with Harsh Thaker’s wicket after he had reached his half-century. Siddique used the slower delivery to outfox a set Thaker. He removed Movva and Zafar in the last over, completing his maiden five-wicket haul in T20Is.\nDhaliwal, who made a half-century against South Africa in Canada’s previous game, struck four boundaries in his 34 off 28 balls. His run-out was unfortunate when Dhaliwal’s bat got stuck just outside the crease. Thaker later fell on exactly 50 off 41 balls, with two fours and three sixes, though Thaker held together the UAE innings till the 18th over.\nBrief scores:\nUnited Arab Emirates 154 for 5 in 19.4 overs (Arynash Sharma 74*, Sohaib Khan 51; Kaleem Sana 1-29, Jaskaran Singh 1-45, Saad Bin Zafar 3-14) beat Canada 150 for 7 in 20 overs (Dilpreet Bajwa 11,Navneet Dhaliwal 34, Harsh Thaker 50, Shreya Movva 21; Junaid Siddique 5-35, Muhammad Jawadullah 1-16) by five wickets\n[Cricinfo]\nLatest News\nMuzarabani, Bennett orchestrate famous Zimbabwe win\nZimbabwe remain undefeated against Australia in T20 World Cups after a career-best bowling display from Blessing Muzabarani and a gutsy 64 not out from Brian Bennett helped orchestrate a stunning 23-run win in Colombo and throw group B into chaos.\nMuzarabani took 4 for 17 from four overs, ripping out the top order alongside Brad Evans in the powerplay who also took 3 for 23, as Australia never really looked close to chasing Zimbabwe’s impressive 169 for 2 on a slow pitch that had been set up by even contributions from the top four.\nMatt Renshaw’s 65 off 44 gave Australia hope but on top of the polished display with bat and ball they also fielded superbly to restrict Australia and threaten their Super Eight hopes.\nBrief scores:\nZimbabwe 169 for 2 in 20 overs (Brian Bennett 64*, Tadiwanashe Marumani 35, Ryan Burl 35, Sikandar Raza 25*; Marcus Stoinis 1-17, Cameron Green 1-06) beat Australia 146 in 19.3 overs (Travis Head 17, Glenn Maxwell 31, Matt Renshaw 65; Blessing Muzarabani 4-17, Brad Evans 3-23, Wellington Masakadza 1-36, Ryan Burl 1-09) by 23 runs\n[Cricinfo]\n-\nFeatures6 days ago\nMy experience in turning around the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka (MBSL) – Episode 3\n-\nBusiness7 days ago\nZone24x7 enters 2026 with strong momentum, reinforcing its role as an enterprise AI and automation partner\n-\nBusiness6 days ago\nRemotely conducted Business Forum in Paris attracts reputed French companies\n-\nBusiness6 days ago\nFour runs, a thousand dreams: How a small-town school bowled its way into the record books\n-\nBusiness6 days ago\nComBank and Hayleys Mobility redefine sustainable mobility with flexible leasing solutions\n-\nBusiness3 days ago\nAutodoc 360 relocates to reinforce commitment to premium auto care\n-\nMidweek Review3 days ago\nA question of national pride\n-\nBusiness7 days ago\nHNB recognized among Top 10 Best Employers of 2025 at the EFC National Best Employer Awards",
