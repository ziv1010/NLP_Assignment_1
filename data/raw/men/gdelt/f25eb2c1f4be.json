  "body_text": "Manchester United’s pursuit to sign Viktor Gyokeres seems to be getting increasingly challenging as more clubs signal their interest in the striker.\nHaving previously worked under Man United manager Ruben Amorim, Gyokeres has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford, especially given his massive scoring record at Sporting CP this season.\nAs mentioned by The Peoples Person, Gyokeres was full of praise for Amorim given his record at Sporting, going so far as to say he felt “invincible” under the Portuguese manager. Understandably, such a claim would serve to excite the United fanbase given the club’s strong links to the Swedish striker.\nStill, United appear to be facing an uphill battle in their transfer race for Gyokeres, particularly as an increasing number of clubs signal their interest in the clinical finisher.\nEven after receiving a morale boost after Arsenal’s €70 million offer for Gyokeres was reportedly rejected by Sporting, United appear to be set to face further competition from another elite European contender.\n“Viktor Gyokeres is on Napoli’s list, with a very personal goal of its president Aurelio De Laurentiis in mind: winning the Champions League next season,” Portugal’s Correio da Manhã reported this morning.\n“The Sporting player has been a target for Napoli for some time now, and winning the Scudetto increases this desire even more,” the article continued. “Coach Antonio Conte recently renewed his contract and has outlined the priorities for strengthening the team’s attack for 2025/2026.”\nInterestingly, it is Gyokeres and an ageing Kevin de Bruyne who are at the top of Conte’s list if the report is to be believed.\nWhile Napoli is sure to provide stiff competition to United, at least Amorim knows that Sporting is not determined to resist the player’s departure, albeit that their transfer demands are sure to be steep.\n“Sporting is willing to negotiate for its top scorer, but only for between 80 and 90 million euros,” the report confirmed, hence explaining why Arsenal’s bid was soundly rejected.\nFollowing United’s official confirmation that Matheus Cunha has joined the club, it remains unclear as to whether they will be willing to fork out more money on another expensive signing such as Gyokeres or perhaps look to focus on acquiring several more affordable players as part of their squad rebuild.\nEither way, United would be wise to keep their options open, especially after fellow striker target Liam Delap decided to join Chelsea.\nGiven the lack of European football next season, it could be a tough transfer window ahead for United, who will need to act decisively in order to attract the talent they require.\nFeatured image Gualter Fatia via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
