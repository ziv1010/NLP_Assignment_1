  "body_text": "Union's Bjelica suspended for three games after altercation with Sané\nUnion Berlin coach Nenad Bjelica was suspended by the German Football Federation (DFB) for three games after an altercation with Bayern Munich winger Leroy Sané on Wednesday.\nHe was also fined €25,000 ($27.12 million) for unsportsmanlike behaviour in the 1-0 defeat to Bayern, the DFB said on Thursday. Union have agreed to the verdict, making it legally binding.\nThe incident happened in the 74th minute of the postponed match between Bayern and Union.\nBjelica shielded the ball away from Sané, who was trying to take a throw in. When Sané tried to retrieve the ball, Bjelica hit him in the face and both had to be separated by other players and the sideline staff.\nBjelica was sent off and on his way out, had heated discussions with the Bayern fans in the stands. Sané, menawhile, received a yellow card.\n\"I was in my area, wanted to give him (Sané) the ball and he pushed me. What I did was intolerable, I understand the red card, I was a bit upset,\" Bjelica explained after the game.\nHe was annoyed because he thought a potential penalty situation was not checked by video review. But the play was indeed checked by the team in the broadcasting centre in Cologne.\n\"You could give it (the penalty). But of course, I shouldn't have reacted as I did,\" Bjelica said.\nBjelica's suspension is another setback for Union, who are currently 15th in the standings and fighting against relegation. They played the Champions League last year but were eliminated in the group stage and earlier this season, they had a run of 10 winless league games, which included nine defeats.\nOn Sunday, Union host Darmstadt, who currently sit bottom of the table.\nBayern winger Sané said that the altercation with Bjelica was already in the past and that the most important was the 1-0 win on Wednesday.\n\"I don't hold grudges when it comes to things like that and the situation is already forgotten,\" Sané told the Bild newspaper.\n\"As far as I know, he was a bit emotional after the incident in our penalty area. Anyway, the most important is that we got the three points,\" he added.",
