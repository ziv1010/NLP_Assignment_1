  "body_text": "Trent Alexander-Arnold’s dream of joining Real Madrid from Liverpool in the January transfer window has taken a huge blow, according to reports.\nIt is believed that Alexander-Arnold has decided to sign for Real Madrid and has already informed boyhood club Liverpool of his plans to do so.\nBut the move has taken a twist after the Reds rejected an official approach from Real Madrid to permanently sign Alexander-Arnold in January.\nThat’s according to The Times, with the Anfield hierarchy immediately rebuffing Real Madrid’s approach on Tuesday.\nLiverpool refused to enter into any form of negotiations to sell the England international right-back, who is out of contract at the end of the season.\nArne Slot’s side, who currently sit top of the Premier League table and are fighting for this season’s title, have been keen to secure a new deal with Alexander-Arnold themselves but an agreement has not been reached.\nAlexander-Arnold can officially speak to foreign clubs about a free transfer from January 1 (Wednesday) – and Real Madrid will now hold talks with the player about a summer move – with a January switch looking unlikely.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

He would be a massive success. They wouldn’t focus on his defending critically as we do here – overly in my opinion. It’s a great fit and would be a huge loss for Liverpool.’\nMore Trending\nAlexander-Arnold, who came through Liverpool’s academy, has played 333 games for the club to date, registering 20 goals and 85 assists.\nThe 26-year-old has helped Liverpool win the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup, Club World Cup and Super Cup during his time at the club.\nAlexander-Arnold scored in Liverpool’s last Premier League match as they thumped West Ham 5-0 at the London Stadium on Sunday.\nMORE: Aaron Anselmino set to start Chelsea training next week in January boost\nMORE: Manchester United tentatively identify three targets for January transfer window\nMORE: Rio Ferdinand says he is ‘really gutted’ for Manchester United star after Newcastle defeat",
