  "body_text": "Norway, Italy clash in crucial World Cup qualifier\nWith Europe’s top leagues ending last week, with the playing of the Champions League Final, attention turn to the newly formed Club World Cup and World Cup qualifiers for the next few weeks.\nEvent # 1 – WCQ – Norway vs Italy – 1:45 PM\nNorway and Italy are set to collide in a crucial World Cup qualifier later today, which marks the third match day in the European qualifying campaign. The home side, Norway, have been in excellent form in recent times and leads their group with six points, from their opening two matches. Indeed, the Norwegians have made a blistering start to their qualifying campaign, scoring an impressive nine goals and conceding just two goals from their two games played so far. In their last outing, Norway easily brushed aside a hapless Israeli side 4-2 away from home, a result that solidified their position atop the group and proved that they can perform at an extremely high level away from home. Norway will enter this crucial clash against one of the European giants in a confident mood, having won four and lost just one of their last overall matches.\nThe Italians are seeking redemption, as they have been in a period of transition since their shock failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup. However, the Italians have been making gradual progress, as in their last outing they played to an exciting 3-3 draw with the in-form Germany, away from home, proving that they can again go head-to-head with the big hitters in world football. In their previous World Cup campaign, Italy was shocked and beaten at home by minnows North Macedonia, which ultimately cost them a place in the 2022 World Cup. Following their participation in the Nations League competition, this will be Italy’s first qualifying game of the campaign, which is a must-win for them as only the winner from the group is going straight through to World Cup 2026. Indeed, it’s almost 11 years on from their last trip to Norway, which ended with a 2-0 win for the Italians, and they return needing to avoid defeat at all cost if they are to have a chance of appearing at World Cup 2026.\nKey Stats\n● Norway – Norway has not appeared at a World Cup Finals since 1998, with the last major tournament being Euro 2000. However, Norway has won the last four matches on the trot.\n● Italy – Italy is winless in the last three overall matches,with seven of the last eight matches ending with over 2.5 goals.\n● Both sides – Three of the last four meetings between Norway and Italy have served up 3+ goals.\nThe betting Tip. Norway win or draw.\nEvent # WCQ – Finland vs Netherlands – 1:45 PM\nFinland and the Netherlands will face off in a crucial World Cup qualifier on Saturday, June 7, at the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki. Heading into this huge clash, Finland sits second in their group, with four points from their opening two games played, and they now face a stern test against the strongest side in the group. The Finnish team started their campaign on a positive note, winning their opening match, before blowing a 0-2 lead to finish 2-2 away to Lithuania. However, Finland have made progress on the big stage in recent times by reaching a major tournament for the first time at the Euro 2020, and they were a play-off away from repeating the trick last summer. However, qualifying for the World Cup is a much tougher proposition and they will have to be at their best if they are to realise this dream, as they finished bottom of their group in the Nations League qualifiers, without picking up a point.\nNetherlands will enter this World Cup qualifier aiming to build on their entertaining 3-3 draw with Spain in their Nations League quarter-final game, which they eventually lost on penalties. After missing out on two major tournaments, Netherlands seem to have rediscovered their mojo, as a quarter-finals run in the 2022 World Cup was followed by a semi-final run at Euro 2024, and now they aim to get their World Cup qualifying campaign off to a winning start against a nation that they have had the upperhand against in their most recent meetings. Indeed, Netherlands defeated Finland twice when they met in the 2012 Euro qualifiers, which was the last time both nations faced each other. The Dutch will enter this game in good form having lost just one of their last eight matches, but wins have been much harder to come by on their travels as they have won just five of their last eight away World Cup qualifiers. That said, they did win their last three in a row in the Euro 2024 qualifiers.\nKey Stats\n• Finland – Finland is winless in the last four matches against Netherlands.\n• Netherlands – Netherlands have won seven of their last eight matches against Finland and the other ending in a draw.\n• Both sides – Finland has hosted Netherlands at home on five occasions and were defeated in four of those matches.\nThe betting Tip. Netherlands win.\nJUSTBET ODDS – Norway vs Italy\nFriday, June 6, 2025\nPrediction Odds on Prediction Odds Calculation\nNORWAY TO WIN $2.62 which means a $1,000 bet would pay $2,620\nITALY TO WIN $2.50 which means a $1,000 bet would pay $1,610\nMATCH TO DRAW $3.33 which means a $1,000 bet would pay $3,330\nOdds on the Home Team (Norway)winning the game 2-1 at full time $10.00 which means that a $1,000 bet would pay $10,000\nOdds on the Away Team (Italy) winning the game 0-1 at full time $9.50 which means that a $1,000 bet would pay $9,500\nOdds on the game drawing 1-1 at full time $6.33 which means that a $1,000 bet would pay $6,330.\nJUSTBET ODDS – Finland vs Netherlands\nSaturday, June 7, 2025\nPrediction Odds on Prediction Odds Calculation\nFINLAND TO WIN $9.50 which means a $1,000 bet would pay $9,500\nNETHERLANDs TO WIN $1.27 which means a $1,000 bet would pay $1,270\nMATCH TO DRAW $5.33 which means a $1,000 bet would pay $5,330\nOdds on the Home Team (Finland) winning the game 1-0 at full time $21.00 which means that a $1,000 bet would pay $21,000\nOdds on the Away Team (Netherlands) winning the game 0-3at full time $7.50 which means that a $1,000 bet would pay $7,500\nOdds on the game drawing 2-2 at full time $26.00 which means that a $1,000 bet would pay $26,000.",
