I'm so happy, I can't believe it.\n'I'm so happy about you all, about the atmosphere, about the game, about being part of this family, about us, how we celebrated this day. It's just incredible. Thank you so much.\n'Honestly, for whatever reason, it doesn't feel like an end. It just feels like the start, because I saw today a football team playing full of talent, full of youth, full of creativity, full of desire, full of grit.\nKlopp was seen strolling through the city centre with his players and staff following their 2-0 win against Wolves at Anfield in his final game in charge\nVirgil van Dijk leads the Liverpool players into the Titanic Hotel as they finished the Premier League season in third place\nDarwin Nunez arriving at the Titanic Hotel to celebrate Klopp's farewell\nAndy Robertson, Joe Gomez and Dominik Szoboszlai were just some of the big name players seen celebrating with Klopp last night\nJurgen Klopp produced an emotional final speech to the Liverpool crowd on Sunday afternoon\n'That's one part of development, that's what you need obviously, but obviously since a few weeks I got absolutely too much attention, it's really uncomfortable, but in this time I realised a lot of things.\n'People told me I turned them from doubters into believers, that's not true. Believing is an active act, you have to do it yourself. I just said we have to, you did it. That is a big difference.\n'And who tells you, nobody tells you now to stop believing, because this club is in a better moment than, not ever, maybe ever, I'd have to ask Kenny (Dalglish). Probably ever…since a long time (ago), let me say it like that.\n'So we have this wonderful stadium, we have this wonderful training center, we have you, the super power of world football, wow.\n'We decide if they are worried or excited. We decide if we believe or if we don't believe. We decide if we trust or we don't trust.\n'Since today I am once of you, and I keep believing in you. I stay a believer, one hundred percent.'\nDuring that speech, he began singing the name of his Dutch successor Arne Slot - who last week confirmed he would be taking over after Liverpool agreed a compensation package that could reach £9.42million with his current employers Feyenoord.\nKlopp then carried out his trademark fist-bumps in front of the Kop as he took the adulation of the fans.\nPlayers and staff did a guard of honour for the German coach after their win over Wolves\nVirgil van Dijk was in tears as he hugged Klopp on the pitch after his final match at the club\nKlopp then chanted the name of his Liverpool successor, Arne Slot, after his last game\nKlopp waved goodbye to the Anfield crowd after their 2-0 victory over Wolves on Sunday\nAs his players watched on, Alexander-Arnold was also seen crying, having played all of his professional club football under Klopp.\nAfter the match, Klopp produces an emotional message and he addressed his Liverpool players for the final time.\nIn a video that appeared on Liverpool's official account on X, he said: 'I love you, that's all I can say.\n'The football you are able to play is absolutely ridiculous. I can't wait, watching you developing, making the next steps. We come in third. I don't even know yet who became champions.\n'You can do that again. I said to you this morning. There might be some people that say to you 'that's not enough', I tell you, they don't have a clue about football. Could we have done better in moments? Yes, of course, that's always possible.\n'But did we do better than you can usually expect? Oh yes, because it takes longer to become a top team again, and you did that like this (clicks fingers).\n'Then my expectations went (high) and then we couldn't keep the pace. That's the problem a little bit.\n'Guys, we come in third in the first season with Liverpool 2.0 and from now on with new energy from outside, with new influences, with new push, proving yourselves, that's good for squeezing everything out of your career.\n'I just want to say, I love you. It was absolutely outstanding. Thank you for the ride, I'm so proud of you and I'm so proud that I have been allowed to be part of this. Thank you very much, and the sky is the limit for you boys'.\nKlopp produced an emotional final speech to his players after his final match in charge\nKlopp also revealed his plans to retreat into a private life following his departure from the Premier League club.\nHe told reporters in his last post-match press conference: 'A private life must be planned and I didn't plan anything yet because I was here.\n'Probably Ulla (Sandrock, his wife) will update me where we go but I follow happily.\n'I don't know exactly why nobody believes I probably will not be a manager again but I understand because obviously it seems to be a drug, because everybody comes back and everyone works until they are 70-something.\n'Other people can do it in different ways, I have to be all-in, I have to be the spark, I have to be the energy, I have to be all these kind of things and I'm empty.\n'You only have to look outside which clubs are obviously available. There will be opportunities, but I don't sit here and think, \"Maybe in a year's time I take that.\"'\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured",
