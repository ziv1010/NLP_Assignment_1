Spurs stalled on taking action, though, and nearly missed out on his talent, as Pleat highlights what his role at Tottenham has been in recent years.\nTottenham almost missed out on signing Dele\n\"[My role at Spurs in recent years has been] consultant and scout,\" Pleat tells FourFourTwo. \"I’m very pleased with one or two players who came in where I had an influence, one being Jack Clarke. None of the managers handled him well. He can play.\n\"There was Dele Alli, too. I took Franco Baldini to watch him and he was on his phone the whole time – he didn’t even watch him. I’ve got six reports on Dele over a period of two years; they should’ve reacted after my first two. Eventually they heard he was going to Aston Villa or Newcastle. They rang me and I said, 'Well, fancy that? Serves you right. You have to get hold of him.' They did the deal really quickly and I persuaded the chairman that £5m wasn’t too much to pay.\n\"At one stage they could have sold him for over £80m, then things happened. I’m sad because I saw him at 16 and he already had that stature about him, and he could play, too.\"\nWhile Dele moved to Everton in 2022 in a deal that could have risen to £40m, he is now without a contract, though he continues to train with the Merseysiders as he seeks a return to football.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nPleat, meanwhile, recently stopped working for Tottenham. The 79-year-old isn't intent on retiring now, though, as he also looks to get back into the game in some capacity.\nVIDEO: How Arne Slot's GENIUS System Has Made Liverpool Title Challengers\n\"I finished at Tottenham recently,\" Pleat says. \"I was the last scout standing – they’ve gone for data completely now. Good luck to them, but there’s a place for scouts. A scout can tell you things data can’t: if the boy is popular with his team-mates, how he reacts when he hasn’t got the ball, what he’s like off the field... Your contacts will tell you that. You’ll know enough people.\n\"I intend to stay in football, and I’ve been talking to one or two people – I will continue.\"\nRyan is a staff writer for FourFourTwo, joining the team full-time in October 2022.
