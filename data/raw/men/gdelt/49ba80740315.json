We have to look at ourselves and take responsibility.” Amorim did clarify his stance later during the same press conference.\nMaguire on poor form\nThe 31-year-old was asked about what the players could do to turn their fortunes around to which the England international replied that the players are individually quite good but need to work together as a team to take the club out of their current predicament.\n“If I could explain it, we would change it straight away. Like you said, we have players who have played numerous games internationally and have won lots of trophies in club football.\n“But we’re not playing well enough as a team at the moment and the league shows that. We need to stop looking for excuses and it’s really important as an individual you improve yourself.”\nAmorim has previously stated that Maguire is a leader on and off the pitch and his good displays in a back three have seen him earn a contract extension.\nThe former skipper was asked whether losing the captaincy has freed him and allowed him to express himself more freely on the pitch, especially in the aftermath of brutal trolling on social media.\nMaguire on leadership\nMaguire denied these statements, and revealed that he always prides himself as a leader and claimed that United legends such as Wayne Rooney and David Beckham had seen even worse but they never cowered down and neither will he.\n“I wouldn’t put it down to that, whether I’m captain or not, I see myself as a leader in this group of player. I’m experienced and now playing for this club, there are ups and downs.\n“It’s part and parcel of playing for this club. I look at previous players and the likes of Rooney and Beckham, they had a large amount of scrutiny on them and they’re world-class players.\n“It is a huge privilege and honour to represent this club and the scrutiny is a part and parcel of playing for this great club and I would not have it any other way.”\nThe England international showed his leadership qualities when Joshua Zirkzee was going through a tough time when he was booed off the pitch by the Old Trafford crowd in the first half of the game against Newcastle.\n“I sent him a private message after the (Newcastle) game. Listen, Joshua is a good player – you don’t play for this club if you’re not a good player. We have amazing fans who stick with us through thick and thin. It’s not about individuals.”\nFinally, Amorim said in the press conference that the players were nervous while playing at Old Trafford due to their poor home record and Maguire responded to that by stating that small margins have not been going in their favour but the players will not stop trying to correct this moving forward.\nNerves at home?\n“No, we spoke about the first goal at Old Trafford and it’s not teams are coming and opening us up and breaking us down. The game against Brighton was 50/50, it could have gone either way and we need to stop giving away the first goal.\n“Football games are defined by small margins. We know things can turn and tomorrow is a chance to go out there and put on a performance.”\nThe Rangers game under the lights at The Theatre of Dreams represents a great chance to prove that this team can handle the pressure.\nEurope represents the club’s best chance at qualifying for the Champions League next season and despite their woeful league form, the Red Devils are one of five sides still unbeaten in this year’s Europa League.\nA win could take United closer to automatic qualification, something Amorim desperately wants. Now for the players to respond.\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
