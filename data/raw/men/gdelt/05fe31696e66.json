A compensation package for the 45-year-old, with two years remaining on his contract, has been settled, reportedly up to £9.4 million. Slot expressed eagerness for the Anfield role, backed by Klopp's praise for his coaching style and character.\nNEW DELHI: According to British media reports, Liverpool and Feyenoord have reached an agreement for Arne Slot to replace Jurgen Klopp as the manager of the Premier League club. The Press Association reported that a compensation package for the 45-year-old, who had two years remaining on his contract, has been agreed upon. The BBC stated that the deal is worth up to £9.4 million (10.9 million euros).\nSlot expressed his confidence in securing the Anfield job on Thursday, saying, \"I would like to go to Liverpool. Now I'm waiting to see whether the clubs reach an agreement. I'm very confident in that.\" He joined Feyenoord in 2021 after an impressive stint as the manager of AZ Alkmaar. In his first season with Feyenoord, Slot led the team to the inaugural Europa Conference League final, where they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma. The following season, he guided the club to their second league title in 24 years before signing a new three-year contract.\nKlopp, who will step down at the end of the current season after a successful nine-year reign that included winning the Champions League in 2019 and the Premier League in 2020, praised Slot's qualities, saying, \"I like the way his team plays football. If he is the one, I like that he wants it.\" He added, \"I don't know him, but some people who know him say he's a good guy. I like that a lot. So good coach, good guy. Looking forward for the club, if he is the solution, if he is the man, I'm more than happy.\"\nInitially, Bayer Leverkusen manager and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso was considered the favorite to succeed Klopp. However, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title. Sporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim was also linked with the Liverpool job but has reportedly held talks with West Ham about replacing David Moyes next season.\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk believes that Slot's attacking tactics could be an ideal fit for the Premier League club, stating, \"I think Arne Slot is perhaps one of the better Dutch coaches at this moment. I think the way of playing and the philosophy he has, that he could be a Liverpool coach.\"\n(Inputs from AFP)\nGet the latest IPL 2025 updates on Times of India, including match schedules, team squads, points table and IPL live score for CSK, MI, RCB, KKR, SRH, LSG, DC, GT, PBKS, and RR.
