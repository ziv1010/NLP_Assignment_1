Despite having a contract that runs to 2029, the Villans are widely tipped to be cashing in, hoping to replace the Argentinian with a younger keeper.\nThe star was spotted crying after the recent match against Spurs, leading Sky Sports to suggest that it might have been one of the last of his 211 appearances for the Birmingham side.\n🗣️ \"He'll be a big loss to them\"\n🗣️ \"That does look like he was waving goodbye for sure\"Roy Keane and Jamie Redknapp on Emi Martinez waving to the Villa Park crowd with tears in his eyes 👋 pic.twitter.com/wNaMId6Cij\n— Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 16, 2025\nThe keeper’s market value as per transfermarkt.com is €25 million (£21m) but Villa are probably looking for an amount in excess of that as they seek to balance the books from a PSR perspective.\nIronically, one of the names tipped to replace Martinez at Villa Park is Espanyol’s Joan Garcia, who has also been heavily linked with an Old Trafford switch.\nMartinez has also been reported to want Champions League football, which would rule out Saudi but could put United in the picture if they were to win the Europa League final on Wednesday.\nIf indeed United were to land the South American, it would call into question whether Onana would then be sold or whether they would be left to battle it out for the number one jersey.\nSerendipitously, United are set to face Martinez and Villa in their final Premier League match of the season next Sunday.\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
