  "body_text": "FIFA has announced the stadiums for the 2025 Club World Cup, which will be held in the United States for the first time.\nThe tournament will feature 32 teams worldwide and be held in 12 stadiums in 11 U.S. cities.\nThe final match is set for July 13, 2025, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which will also host the 2026 World Cup final.\nIt’s worth noting that the venues include a mix of NFL and Major League Soccer (MLS) stadiums, with five of the 2026 World Cup stadiums included.\nThese sites include the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, and Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida, both used in the 1994 World Cup.\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino shared the news at the Global Citizen Festival in New York City’s Central Park.\nThe word spread on a Saturday when many U.S. sports fans were focused on college football and Major League Baseball.\nAcross the United States, the 2026 World Cup venues include Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, MetLife Stadium, Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, and Lumen Field in Seattle.\nOther stadiums in the tournament include Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, Geodis Park in Nashville, Inter&Co Stadium in Orlando, and Audi Field in Washington, D.C.\nSurprisingly, SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, despite hosting eight World Cup games in 2026, was not selected for the 2025 Club World Cup.\nEight groups of four teams will compete, with the top two from each group moving on to a single-elimination knockout stage.\nSome of the world’s best clubs will play, including Real Madrid, Manchester City, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Boca Juniors, and Flamengo.\nNotably, Seattle Sounders are the only U.S. team confirmed so far, qualifying by winning the 2022 Concacaf Champions League.\nAnother U.S. team will join, likely the winner of this year’s MLS Cup, although there is speculation that Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami might be chosen for the “host nation” spot.\nFIFPRO, the international players’ union, criticized the tournament’s timing, raising concerns about player recovery after the 2024-2025 season.\nThey also expressed worries about the physical and mental health of players, as well as the impact on their personal lives.\nThough FIFA has not yet announced any TV broadcast agreements for the tournament, the venue announcement was streamed on YouTube.\nPhiladelphia’s Lincoln Financial Field is one of the chosen venues, which allows the city to experience international soccer before the 2026 World Cup.\nLooking ahead, details about the number of matches in each city will be announced after the group stage draw in December.\nUnfortunately, the Philadelphia Union missed qualifying, but the chance to watch top teams will still be exciting for local fans.\nThe 12 chosen venues span the U.S., from Seattle to Miami, covering different regions of the country.\nFor example, Seattle’s Lumen Field, home to the Sounders, is expected to be a lively venue, as the city has a strong soccer fan base.\nIn addition to Seattle and Miami, other cities, such as Charlotte, Atlanta, and Orlando, will host matches, while MetLife Stadium will host the final.\nThe FIFA Club World Cup 2025 will feature top teams from around the globe, including Europe, South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania.\nAs the U.S. prepares for the 2026 World Cup, the 2025 Club World Cup will be an important test for hosting large international soccer events.\nSoccer fans are eagerly awaiting what promises to be an exciting summer of competition in 2025.",
