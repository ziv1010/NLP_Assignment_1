The team’s qualification, tied to Haiti’s revolutionary legacy, became more than a sporting event—it was a moment of cultural redemption.\nDespite gang violence forcing home matches to be held abroad, the team triumphed behind star performances by Don Louicius, Ruben Providence, and returning veterans Duckens Nazon, Frantzdy Pierrot and Johny Placide. Head coach Sébastien Migné also recruited top European talent, including Jean-Ricner Bellegarde and Hannes Delcroix.\nNow, drawn into Group C with Brazil, Morocco and Scotland, Haiti faces long odds. It is facing them heads on.\nCarel Pedre — Influencer lands in ICE detention after domestic violence arrest\nHaitian media personality Carel Pedre ended up in ICE custody after being arrested on a misdemeanor battery charge stemming from a Tamarac, Florida, domestic dispute with his live-in girlfriend that prompted neighbors to call police.\nDespite his lawyers’ efforts to keep him in local custody to resolve the criminal case, ICE transferred Pedre to Krome Detention Center, then “Alligator Alcatraz,” before moving him back to Krome. Supporters have launched a #FreeCarel campaign and a Change.org petition calling for his release. Details of his immigration case remained undisclosed.\nSheila Cherfilus-McCormick — Federal indictment adds drag to historic rise\nRep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, the first Haitian American woman elected to Congress from Florida, faced a defining moment in 2025 after a federal grand jury indicted her on fraud, money laundering and campaign finance violation charges.\nProsecutors allege Cherfilus-McCormick illegally funneled $5 million in pandemic relief funds from her family’s healthcare company into her 2021 congressional campaign, using straw donors and falsified tax filings to conceal the money. The indictment caps years of financial scrutiny surrounding her razor-thin election victory and ethics investigations, even as she built a profile as a vocal advocate for Haitian and immigrant communities in South Florida.\nCherfilus-McCormick has denied all wrongdoing, calling the case a “baseless” political attack and pledging to fight the charges in court.\nHotel Oloffson — Historic sanctuary lost to flames\nOn July 6, Port-au-Prince’s iconic Hotel Oloffson was reduced to ashes, the victim of gang violence that has devastated the capital. The gingerbread Gothic mansion, once a presidential palace, was a beloved sanctuary for artists, journalists, Vodou practitioners and Haiti’s LGBTQ+ community.\nBuilt in the 19th century and famously featured in Graham Greene’s The Comedians, the Oloffson under Richard and Lunise Morse became a heartbeat of Haitian cultural life. Its RAM Thursday night concerts and Fèt Gede celebrations drew crowds from all walks of life.\nIts destruction marked not just the loss of a building—but the silencing of a radically inclusive, historic cultural space.\nKonpa — Haiti’s popular music genre gets UNESCO and NYC recognition\nKonpa, Haiti’s beloved national popular music and dance genre, was officially recognized by UNESCO as part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in December 2025. Coming on the music’s 70th anniversary, the UNESCO nod affirms konpa’s status as a cultural treasure and opens the door to more preservation, education and global appreciation.\nThe global honor followed the New York City Council declaring July 26 as Haitian Konpa Day, cementing the genre’s influence in one of the diaspora’s cultural capitals.\nCreated in 1955 by Nemours Jean-Baptiste, konpa blends Haitian rhythms, big band sounds and Caribbean influences. Over time, it evolved into a defining sound for generations of Haitians and fans worldwide.\nIn Memoriam\nPasquet, Frankétienne, Pierre & Leconte — Cultural giants who passed away\nSwipe to browse.\nHaitian Creole — Receives recognition across different institutions\nSeveral institutions approved the study of Haitian Creole or Haitian studies as part of their curricula this year, indicating a much-overdue embrace in the diaspora’s eyes.\nIn Chicago, Professor Gerdine Michel Ulysse launched a pioneering Creole and Haitian Studies minor at the University of Chicago. In New York City, CUNY Brooklyn College approved Haitian Creole as part of its Global Languages, Literatures, and Cultures department.\nJoé Dwèt Filé & “4 Kampé”— Remix and royalties yield beaucoup bucks and awards\nJoé Dwèt Filé’s “4 Kampé” reached stratospheric heights globally in 2025, earning accolades around the globe and compensation too. The song won nominations for Best Caribbean-Inspired Song award at the 2025 Les Flammes Awards in Paris, Best International Act at the 2025 BET Awards and “Song of the Year” at the African Arts Entertainment Awards for the Burna Boy remix.\nSACEM, a nonprofit France-based organization that collects and distributes royalties to artists, played a huge role in helping “4 Kampé” earn commercial recognition and big bucks for its creator Joé Dwèt Filé. Its massive streaming success earned “4 Kampé” certified Diamond status in France, making Joe Dwèt Filé the first Franco-Haitian artist to be nominated for the Flammes honor.\nFabrice Rouzier — Copyright and culture collide in lawsuit\nHaitian music veteran Fabrice Rouzier shook the diaspora music world in April when he sued Franco-Haitian artist Joé Dwèt Filé, Nigerian superstar Burna Boy and comedian Tonton Bicha. Rouzier, co-founder of Mizik Mizik and composer of the 2002 song Je Vais, alleged unauthorized sampling and performance of Je Vais in Joé Dwèt Filé’s 2024 global hit “4 Kampé.”\nThe lawsuit raised urgent questions about intellectual property, generational respect and the commercialization of culture. Despite the suit, the song’s success has been massive: 4 Kampé and its sequel have topped 100 million streams, far surpassing the original’s modest reach.\nMelchie “Corventina” Dumornay — Earns second Women’s Player of the Year award\nAt just 22, Melchie Daëlle Dumornay — known globally as “Corventina” — continued to shine in 2025, earning CONCACAF Women’s Player of the Year for the second consecutive time, a feat matched only by American legend Alex Morgan.\nAlready a standout at the 2023 Women’s World Cup, Dumornay was also named UEFA Women’s Champions League Young Player of the Season and selected to the Champions League Best XI for the second year in a row — solidifying her status as Haiti’s most accomplished international athlete.\nHurricane Melissa — Tragedy sparks mourning and anger in Petit-Goâve\nHurricane Melissa killed at least 25 people in Haiti’s Petit-Goâve commune, including 10 children swept away by the overflowing La Digue River. The disaster left entire neighborhoods submerged and families shattered.\nDuring a mass funeral on Nov. 15, hundreds of residents demanded accountability, blaming years of neglected river maintenance, deforestation and state abandonment for amplifying the storm’s deadly impact. The absence of government officials at the ceremony deepened public anger and grief.\nBoulos and Vorbe — Arrested as US targets Haiti’s elite for alleged ties to gangs\nTwo of Haiti’s most powerful oligarchs — Reginald Boulos and Dimitri Vorbe — were arrested in the U.S. in 2025, accused of supporting armed gangs and destabilizing Haiti. Both are being held by immigration authorities amid allegations of immigration fraud, corruption and criminal conspiracy.\nBoulos, who renounced his U.S. citizenship to run for president in Haiti, was detained in Miami for allegedly funding criminal groups and concealing political ties on immigration forms. Weeks later, Vorbe, whose family controls the private utility power company SOGENER, was also taken into custody in Florida.\nTheir arrests came as Congress passed the Haiti Criminal Collusion Transparency Act, mandating investigations and sanctions against elites tied to gangs. The new law, signed into the 2026 U.S. defense bill, reflects a turning point in U.S. policy toward Haiti’s entrenched power players.\nSanctioned Haitian elites — Facing international accountability reckoning\nSeveral Haitian political and business leaders — including unnamed figures in the current sanctions list — faced travel bans, asset freezes or immigration detentions in 2025 due to alleged gang ties, corruption and human rights abuses.\nTheir growing legal troubles underscore the shifting balance of impunity and accountability at the highest levels of Haitian power.\nErik Prince — Mercenary’s deal raises alarms over Haiti’s sovereignty\nErik Prince, a Trump ally and founder of the disgraced private military firm Blackwater, emerged as one of the most controversial figures tied to Haiti’s security crisis. His company, Vectus Global, signed a long-term contract with Haiti’s transitional government to fight gangs, deploying foreign fighters, drones and helicopters in and around Port-au-Prince.\nReporting revealed that Prince’s network attempted to recruit Haitian American military veterans as paid mercenaries—prompting sharp backlash from diaspora leaders and U.S. Army veterans like Rod Joseph, a congressional candidate in Florida.\nPrince’s involvement revived painful memories of Haiti’s history with mercenaries, especially after Colombian contractors were implicated in the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. While some residents say safety matters more than who provides it, critics warn the deal threatens national sovereignty, transparency, and human rights.\nAland Etienne — Security officer shot dead, turned into a civic symbol\nAland Etienne, a 46-year-old father of four, was killed while shielding others during a mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan. His act of heroism inspired the Aland Etienne Safety and Security Act, passed by the New York City Council in December, which sets minimum wage, benefits, and PTO standards for over 81,000 private security officers — many of whom are immigrants like Etienne and people of color.\nThad “Silverback” Jean — The ‘Silverback’ who claimed the cage\nIn August, Thad “Silverback” Jean became the 2025 PFL Welterweight World Champion, remaining undefeated at 11–0. For the Broward County–born son of Haitian immigrants, the victory was about more than belts or money — it was about faith, pride and visibility for Haiti.\nKai Cenat — Streaming king and architect of digital Black identity\nKai Cenat, 23, is one of the most-watched streamers in the world with over 18 million followers. A defining cultural figure of Gen Z. While best known for Twitch antics, viral skits and celebrity interviews, 2025 marked the year that Cenat redefined the streaming medium with Streamer University. This multi-day content creator experiment pulled in 27 million hours of watch time on Twitch alone.\nBorn in The Bronx to a Trinidadian mother and Haitian father, Cenat speaks openly about growing up in and out of shelters, his academic struggles and his climb from YouTube prankster to multimillion-dollar brand ambassador. With Twitch subscribers alone generating at least $3.6 million per year, plus deals with Nike, McDonald’s and State Farm, Cenat is building an entertainment empire on his own terms.\nA performance artist, businessman, and reluctant role model, Cenat says his true mission is to change the narrative for kids like him:\nHaiti’s air travel — IBC Airways and Sunrise help refuel sector\nWith Haiti’s main airport in Port-au-Prince shut to U.S. airlines due to gang violence, IBC Airways launched the first direct commercial flights from Miami to Les Cayes’s Antoine Simon Airport in November 2025. The historic milestone gives Haiti’s long-isolated south a much-needed aerial link to the U.S. diaspora, paving the way for regional growth.\nMeanwhile, Haitian-owned Sunrise Airways continued operating from Cap-Haïtien throughout the hemisphere — despite challenges including aircraft damage and service suspensions. Though criticized for high fares and delays, Sunrise remained a vital connector while major carriers stay away.\nPras Michel — Sentenced to 14 years for foreign donations dealings\nFugees rapper Pras Michel was sentenced to 14 years in prison in November 2025 for illegally funneling millions from Malaysian financier Jho Low into Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. Convicted on 10 counts — including conspiracy, acting as a foreign agent and witness tampering — Michel’s case featured testimony from major figures and sparked controversy over alleged trial misconduct.\nBen Mathurin and Lu Dort — Haitian pride brought to NBA Finals\nHaitian Canadian NBA stars Bennedict Mathurin (Indiana Pacers) and Luguentz Dort (Oklahoma City Thunder) made history in the 2025 NBA Finals, becoming the first players of Haitian descent to face off on basketball’s biggest stage. Their performance brought unprecedented global visibility to Haitian talent.\nBaptiste, Eugène & Dieujuste — Haitian fashion designers edit the global style script\nIn 2025, Haitian creatives didn’t just walk the runway. They reshaped what it means to design from memory, culture and diaspora identity. From red carpets to runways, three Haitian designers — Daveed Baptiste, Patrick Eugène, and Charles Dieujuste — turned recognition into revolution.\nDaveed Baptiste\nCFDA Empowered Vision Award\nCrowned the winner of the 2025 CFDA Empowered Vision Award, Baptiste brought his signature fusion of high fashion and lakou memory to the industry’s most elite stage.\nPatrick Eugène\nDior Lady Art Project\nAtlanta-based painter-turned-designer whose three redesigned Dior Lady handbags premiered at Art Basel Paris as part of the house’s Dior Lady Art Project.\nCharles Dieujuste\nFounder of Scorcesa\nIn New York’s garment district, Dieujuste disrupted bridal fashion with nontraditional gowns rooted in Haitian women, family memory and bold fabric choices.\nHaitian migration — Countries curtail Haitian movement across borders\nFrom the Western Hemisphere to farther afield, countries began implementing stricter migration rules that have limited the movement of Haitians seeking safety and stability as Haiti falls further into decline.\nIn North America, the U.S., Canada and Mexico introduced new policies affecting Temporary Protected Status (TPS), humanitarian parole and family reunification programs, leaving many families scrambling.\nNeighboring countries such as the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Panama, The Bahamas and Turks and Caicos updated visa requirements and eligibility for residency. France and its territories in the Caribbean also tightened entry requirements and began returning many Haitians.\nDominican Republic abuses — A year of racialized violence and resistance\nIn 2025, a series of tragedies exposed yet again the systemic mistreatment of Haitians and Black Dominicans in the Dominican Republic:\n- Stephora Joseph, an 11-year-old Haitian student, drowned on a school outing in Santiago amid gross negligence.\n- Lourdia Jean-Pierre, a pregnant Haitian woman, died during a home birth after avoiding a hospital for fear of deportation.\n- A report from NYU’s Global Justice Clinic details abuses under the DR’s 10,000-people-per-week deportation policy, including:\n- Racial profiling\n- Family separations\n- Targeting of pregnant women\n- Detentions based on skin color and surname pronunciation\nThe incidents sparked protests, international petitions and demands for accountability—but also laid bare the human cost of anti-Haitianism.\nGepsie Metellus — Street renamed in her honor\nIn recognition of her decades of community leadership, the City of North Miami renamed NE 134th Street as “Gepsie M. Metellus Street.” As the longtime executive director of Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center, Metellus has been a tireless advocate for equity, education and Haitian American empowerment.\nThe tribute came as Sant La celebrated its 25th anniversary and Metellus prepared for retirement.\nChef Leen — Cooking up new records for Guinness and feeding diaspora pride\nDanaisa “Leen Excellent” Orchestre, also known online as Chef Leen, completed a record-breaking 192-hour cooking marathon in April, aiming to earn a Guinness World Records title for cooking while celebrating Haitian cuisine and culture.\nOriginally from Guinaudée in Jean-Rabel, a commune in Haiti’s Northwest Department, Orchestre has become a symbol of Haitian resilience and national pride. She cooked for a total of eight days.\nMelissa Sapinni — Haiti in the spotlight in global pageantry\nMelissa Sapinni made waves with her participation in the Miss Universe 2025 pageant.
