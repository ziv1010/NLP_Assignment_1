Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘Not yet. The most important thing is the challenge now and this afternoon, recovering and then preparing for the match against Brighton tomorrow,’ the Villa boss said of the matter in his post-Preston press conference.\n‘Still there are a lot of matches to play. If we are in the Champions League, if we are in the Europa League, if we are in the European Conference League or not in Europe or winning a trophy, it is completely different.\n‘A decision about each individual players… it is to get the best of them and the best of us. We don’t want to waste time thinking about it.’\nVilla also have PSG’s Marco Asensio and Chelsea’s Axel Disasi on loan and should Emery also want to buy them outright, it could make a permanent transfer for Rashford more difficult.\nThe United loanee is set to get more chances to prove his worth with Villa still in the FA Cup and Champions League and pushing to finish as high as possible in the Premier League.\nMore Trending\n‘Firstly, his commitment to work and adapt quickly is very important. He is doing it,’ Emery said of Rashford’s performance.\n‘To feel comfortable playing at his best level, there is still work to do. Weeks to get it. Today, he did one step forward, feeling comfortable, gaining confidence and scoring goals.\n‘There is still work to do and adaptation to get together, the teammates and himself. Today, I think this was one step forward.\n‘He was coming here in the last two months not training consistently and not feeling very fit in the first matches with us. After playing more and with the national team, it has helped him to feel better. Today was confirmation of his progression with us.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Erling Haaland injury update as Man City star leaves stadium on crutches\nMORE: What Bruno Fernandes has said about leaving Man Utd as Real Madrid ‘prepare bid’\nMORE: Gary Neville names the Man Utd legend who England ‘forced into retirement’",
