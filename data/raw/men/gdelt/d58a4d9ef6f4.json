  "body_text": "Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold has been linked with a move to Real Madrid after entering the final six months of his contract at Anfield.\nThere is no indication that he will sign a new contract at the club and he has his heart set on a move to the Santiago Bernabeu.\nThe England international has been one of the best players of the club this season and his contribution has helped them reach the top of the Premier League and the Champions League group stage.\nLiverpool fans are starting to get worried about Alexander-Arnold’s long term future at the club.\nNot only the right-back but Mohamed Salah and Virgil Van Dijk are also facing uncertainty over their future due to their contract situation.\nJournalist Ben Jacobs has provided the latest update on the transfer saga, detailing the demands that Alexander-Arnold has in order to sign a new contract at Anfield.\nHe told talkSPORT:\n“Although Trent is not open to a mid-season move, what he does want from Liverpool, if he is to extend, is a three-year contract minimum and, in the long-run, to be captain of the football club.\n“So keep an eye as to whether perhaps Virgil van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold talks are somewhat intertwined. And if Trent is told he’s going to be captain in the long run, does that impact Virgil van Dijk?\n“But as of now, what I think we can say is that Liverpool are more confident that Van Dijk and Salah might stay, whereas Trent Alexander-Arnold feels like an open situation at the moment.”\nReal Madrid ready surprise transfer package to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold in January\nShould Liverpool accept Alexander-Arnold’s demands?\nThe demands mentioned by Jacobs are not something that Liverpool cannot fulfill.\nThe promise of being the captain of the side and a three-year deal is something that a player of Alexander-Arnold’s talent and caliber deserves.\nIf the Merseyside club giving him this opportunity could make him sign a new contract and reject Real Madrid then they should not waste time in offering him that.\nA player of his quality is not easy to find in world football and Liverpool are lucky to have him.\nNot only Alexander-Arnold but Luis Diaz has also been linked with a move to La Liga.",
