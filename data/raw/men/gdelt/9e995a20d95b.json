In the Champions League, they came agonizingly close to an appearance in the final. All of this in Hansi Flick’s first year as manager.\nNow they are in the middle of his second season in charge with a four point lead at the top of the domestic table. They will have a chance early on in 2026 to repeat as Supercopa champions in Saudi Arabia, as well as make a late charge for a top eight finish in the Champions League table ahead of the knockouts.\nIf you’re Joan Laporta, you couldn’t be more pleased with Flick’s performance as coach.\nWhere I stand in terms of realistic expectations, this version of Barcelona is in a strong position to win trophies in Spain, but could find it hard to make a deep run in the Champions League.\nWhat I love about Hansi Flick is the calm and stability that he has brought to Barcelona. For as good as the results have been on the field, his true value has been his managerial skills that transcend what his players do tactically from game to game.\nBarcelona are judged primarily in relation to Real Madrid. Coaching these teams has less to do with your football genius, and more to do with your ability to manage through the drama and distractions that come with leading such a high profile and demanding organization.\nFrom what we’ve seen so far, Flick has proven his worth in this department. Even when fans and pundits have been critical, and in many ways from a football point of view these criticisms have been valid, he has trusted himself and the plan he has in place, and his players have followed suit in terms of belief and temperment.\nThese qualities could be enough for Barcelona to repeat as Spanish champions, especially if the players can stay healthy.\nIn the Champions League, however, it could be déjà vu. Flick will have many skeptics that his tactics can lead Barcelona to the final in Budapest, let alone as far as they made it a year ago, which was the semifinals.\nPerhaps the most important variables will be the ones that are out of the manager’s control. If Pedri, Lamine Yamal, and Raphinha are fit and available for the critical games, Barcelona have a chance.\nI would predict, however, that Joan García will be the x-factor. Those Champions League nights come down to small margins, and the way Barcelona plays, they will need shot stopping heroics. Ultimately, that’s what García was brought in to do, and he will almost certainly have a trial by fire coming soon.\nIn the big picture, Barcelona are a top club in Europe again. They are taken seriously by everyone, you might even go as far as to say feared.\nAs the year comes to a close, it’s important to reflect on that, and have proper perspective and appreciation heading into 2026. Let’s hope that under Flick the team continues to be steady first and foremost, while finding ways to improve and hit their stride at just the right time.\n2025 was an excellent year for the club, and there’s no reason why they can’t build on that success going forward.",
