As a former Liverpool and Crewe trainee he has been brought up the 'right' way in football terms.\nHe played just two League games for Crewe, a Boxing Day 3-1 victory over Burnley at Gresty Road in 2003 followed by a 1-0 home win against Millwall a fortnight later.\nHowever, as happens with many young footballers, he was discarded as a teenager and must have thought that his career was over when Dario gave him the chop.\nHe moved on to the League of Wales, where he had stints with Bangor City (where he played in the Champions League), Rhyl and Welshpool Town. While he was at Welshpool he attracted the attention of Swansea City and had a trial with the League One outfit, but the interest wasn't taken any further.\nHe joined Stanley in March last year and was an instant success in Stanley's all-conquering Conference-winning side and was a regular in the National Game XI (the England team for players from outside of the Football League).\nHe has taken the step-up to the Football League superbly scoring eight goals in 14 league appearances and attracting the attention of a number Championship sides, including Stoke City and Ipswich Town.\nHis versatility will be an enormous asset as he can play as either an out-and-out left winger or up front. When on the wing he has pace and strength and is able to take his tackler either way, going outside to the byline to put in the cross or cutting inside to set up a chance for himself or a well-placed colleague.\nWhen he has played up front he has combined superbly with Paul Mullin, an experienced non-league target man who provides plenty of flick-ons for Roberts to utilise his pace. His eye for goal is obvious, he has a powerful shot and has also scored a few with his head.\nHis superbly taken goal at Torquay must have made a few observers sit up and take notice. Receiving the ball in the box, he coolly drew the last defender, slipped the ball to his left and slotted it into the corner giving the keeper no chance.\nThe lad has ambition and a move to Yeovil Town was mooted in the summer until Stanley's chairman turned down their derisory £75,000 offer. He is out of contract next summer and it will be important for Stanley to cash in during the January transfer window.\nI wish Gary all the best at Portman Road and hope he proves his ability, allowing him a decent move to a footballing side where he should thrive. And obviously providing Stanley with a decent fee - probably something in the £150,000-£200,000 range - in the club's quest for not just Football League survival this term but a play-off place to celebrate the club's first season back in the 'big time' for 45 years.\nThanks to Ian, TheStanleyArms.com can be visited here.\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
