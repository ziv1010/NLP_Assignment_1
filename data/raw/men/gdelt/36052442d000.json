You have to look at the photos and the videos, you have to look [scorer of the winning goal] Arjen Robben in the eye and see how all of our team-mates, me included, jump on him. Pictures speak louder than words.\nOf course, you could say now: \"OK, perhaps [Wembley] is a good omen.\" But I don't believe in that to be honest. We have to put in the work again. But sure, I won my first Champions League title in that stadium. That's something very special for a footballer and it's a big dream, so we want to go back there again. Of course, the city of London has always had huge significance for us since the victory. We always like coming to London.\nOn team-mate Jamal Musiala\nI've known Jamal since he took his first steps here with the senior team. One of his good qualities is that he always asks questions. He's tried to learn by watching the older players and it shows. He doesn't rely on his talent for dribbling, but instead he wants to improve. We have a good relationship, even though we're rivals in theory [positionally].\nOn Harry Kane's impact\nSo far it has been \"amazing\", as the English would say, not just in terms of statistics or goals but also how he handles himself as a person as well as a player, the way he does it all. He isn't selfish and thinking \"Goal, goal, goal\". He just plays his football.\nIt's team play. He gives his all to ensure in the end that the team wins and is a very funny guy off the pitch, so it's awesome.\nOn extending Bayern's unbeaten group stage record\nThe most important thing is to reach the next round. In the knockout stages everything starts from scratch again. It just gives you a good feeling and you don't want to be under pressure in your last group stage game in case you get knocked out.\nFor this reason, we felt good about it. We achieved an unbeaten record in the group stage and that's all nice and it shows our quality. But if you want to win the Champions League you have to come out on top in the knockout stages.",
