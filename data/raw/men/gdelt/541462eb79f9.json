Wilfried Zaha and Conor Gallagher scored the goals.\nAfter a lengthy dip by their standards, City are back on the up. With Premier League leaders Arsenal beaten at Villa Park last weekend, Guardiola's men closed the gap at the top of the table to two points.\nSitting in second place between Arsenal and Villa, City have won 10 of their 15 Premier League matches including the last three against Leeds United, Fulham and Sunderland.\nThey're the top scorers in the division by a country mile and it won't have escaped the notice of Palace boss Oliver Glasner that goal glutton Erling Haaland shook off a slightly quiet week or two to score in the Champions League in midweek.\nTickets\nGet Crystal Palace tickets at Seat Unique\nCrystal Palace hospitality at Selhurst Park guarantees a stylish matchday with premium seating and access to exclusive lounges.

He's scored six goals in four Premier League matches against them, starting with a hat-trick at the Etihad Stadium at the start of 2022-23.\nPalace are a rather tougher nut to crack under Glasner and they are now climbing from the comfort of mid-table stability into a legitimate push for the top four.\nIndeed, they sat in fourth place at the beginning of the weekend, five points behind City in second and one ahead of Chelsea in fifth. They welcome Guardiola and his team to Selhurst Park on Sunday looking for their third win on the bounce.\nGlasner will be eager to have one, two or all of Jean-Philippe Mateta, Ismaela Sarr and Jaydee Canvot available after absences through injury and illness, but Daniel Munoz is expected to be out until the new year.\nSee also ► These are the cheapest ways to watch the Premier League this season\nCrystal Palace vs Manchester City: Expected line-ups\nFourFourTwo's prediction\nCrystal Palace 2-3 Manchester City\nMan City matches have been full of goals lately and both of these teams know where the net is.
