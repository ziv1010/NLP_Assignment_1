We won everything we could. Now time to try again.\"\nBut some of the shine was taken off their victory by the sight of Rodri - so influential for the side - going off injured towards the end of the second half.\nMeanwhile, Egyptian side Al Ahly claimed third place with a 4-2 win against Urawa Red Diamonds of Japan.\nCity seal another title to round off memorable 2023\nCity's win in Jeddah completed a trophy-laden and unforgettable year for the club.\nAlthough winning the Club World Cup has often carried less importance for English sides, Guardiola had spoken of his determination to \"close the circle\" and lift the trophy he believed would complete City's collection.\nWhile this was their first appearance in the tournament, Guardiola had won it before with Barcelona and Bayern Munich and underlined his desire to triumph again by naming a strong line-up.\nThe outcome was a dominant display by the reigning Premier League champions, with goalkeeper Ederson largely untested aside from a Jhon Arias header just before half-time, and a late John Kennedy strike.\n\"We were a little lucky at the start, we got the ball and scored early and then they had an incredible 10-12 minutes that made you realise how tough it would be,\" added Guardiola.\n\"The second goal helped us, but maybe we didn't deserve it. We adjusted something in the second half and we were much, much better.\"\nCity will celebrate before switching focus back to domestic matters, with their next game an away trip to Everton on Wednesday, 27 December.\nWith one win in their last six Premier League games, they will hope to use the momentum of their confident victory, and accolades of being crowned world champions, to get their title defence back on track.\nRodri concern after midfielder limps off\nWhile City fans will be pleased to see another piece of silverware added to their trophy cabinet, they will be concerned by midfielder Rodri going off in the 74th minute.\nThe midfielder was hurt by a challenge from Alexsander and looked in pain as he received treatment.\nRodri was able to get back on his feet and attempted to continue, but was substituted to avoid risking him further.\nCity have struggled when the Spaniard has been absent this season, with their three defeats in the Premier League coming without him in the side.",
