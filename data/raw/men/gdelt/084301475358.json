  "body_text": "Arsenal have officially announced the release of twenty players across the men’s and women’s teams, as well as the youth academy, ahead of a summer that is expected to bring significant change. Is a 2021 level shake-up on the cards?\nWith the club preparing for a rebuild, departures were always going to be part of the process. The Gunners are facing a period of transition, with a need to increase both depth and quality throughout the squad. While much of the focus is naturally on potential new signings, the club must also make room, particularly for returning loanees and academy graduates.\nAccording to a report on Arsenal.com, the club have confirmed the full list of released players, including senior squad members and several scholars. The list also includes players who were out on loan during the 2024–25 season.\nHere is the full list, arranged alphabetically:\nNathan Butler-Oyedeji\nReece Clairmont\nKhayon Edwards\nJakai Fisher\nRomari Forde\nTeyah Goldie\nJimi Gower\nJack Henry-Francis\nLina Hurtig\nAmanda Ilestedt\nJorginho\nMax Kuczynski\nSalah-Eddine Oulad M’Hand\nIsmail Oulad M’Hand\nNeto\nBrian Okonkwo\nElian Quesada-Thorn\nZacariah Shuaib\nRaheem Sterling\nKieran Tierney\nTierney and Jorginho headline senior departures\nTwo of the more notable exits include Kieran Tierney and Jorginho. Both have departed the club upon the expiry of their contracts, with Tierney returning to Celtic and Jorginho heading to Brazil to join Flamengo. Neto and Raheem Sterling also left after completing season-long loan spells.\nWhile several players are moving on, the club also confirmed that they are currently in negotiations with three others to extend their contracts. These include Thomas Partey, Arsenal Women’s Chloe Kelly, and 19-year-old academy midfielder Michal Rosiak.\nArsenal keen to keep Partey despite outside interest\nThe Gunners are particularly eager to keep hold of Thomas Partey. Despite being on the wrong side of 30, the Ghanaian remains a key part of the midfield. His ability to contribute defensively and dictate play makes him a valuable asset, especially with Champions League football on the horizon once again.\nPartey is believed to be happy to stay at the club. However, interest from Barcelona persists, with the Spanish side remaining in contact with his representatives over a possible free transfer.\nStill, Arsenal’s confirmation that contract talks are ongoing will come as encouragement to fans who recognise Partey’s importance to the team’s balance and composure in midfield.\nWhat do you make of the departures and negotiations, Gooners?\nBENJAMIN KENNETH\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\nADMIN COMMENT\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.\nCALLING ALL ARSENAL FANS!
