They hope to reach the fifth round of the FA Cup when they take on Wigan Athletic on Sunday.\nMikel Arteta has assembled one of the strongest squads in Europe to end their long wait for major silverware but were handed a major blow in January when Merino suffered a stress fracture in his foot during the 3-2 defeat to Manchester United.\nThe former Real Sociedad star underwent surgery this week with Arsenal expecting him to be out for an ‘extended’ period of time.\nArsenal will hope to have a very busy month of May with the FA Cup final taking place on the 17th. The final weekend of the Premier League season takes place a week later with the Champions League final taking place in Budapest on 30 May.\nMerino has repeatedly demonstrated how important he is to Arteta’s plans with his injury prompting a late and ultimately unsuccessful search for a replacement late in the January transfer window.\nBoth Arteta and Merino’s father have described the injury as ‘rare’. While the exact nature of the injury has not been disclosed, Stephen Smith, CEO of Kitman Labs which specialises in injury welfare and performance analytics, suggests Arsenal will err on the side of caution when it comes to his return.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nWhile an estimated timeline could see Merino available again for the season run-in, Arsenal will be wary of undoing the hard work done behind the scenes.\n‘The foot has multiple different bones and there are some that are much easier to deal with,’ Smith told Metro. ‘There are some metatarsal stress fractures that are much easier to deal with because they have a higher blood supply than others. The fifth metatarsal or the navicular are two bones that are rare to break but when they do, because they have a poor blood supply in that area, they can take much longer.\n‘On the lower end, stress fractures can be dealt with in four to eight weeks. But if you have a scenario where it is in one of these tricker areas with poor blood supply you are talking anywhere from eight to 12 or even up to 16 weeks.\nWhat Mikel Arteta has said about Merino's injury\n‘I think the doctors were really happy with the way [the surgery] went,’ Arteta told a press conference on Tuesday ahead of this week’s Premier League clash with Brentford.\n‘Now it’s the start of obviously a long process, we’re talking about bone healing. So, we’ll respect the timings, and I’m sure he’s going to do everything he possibly can to speed up that recovery.\n‘The timeframes, we’re talking about months – whether it’s three, four or five, we don’t know.’\n‘If surgical fixation is required, you are generally talking about the higher side of two to three months and it often can be longer. It depends on the specifics of the issue. but if there is surgery, it will add to the timeline.\n‘Even in those more serious scenarios, a return to play would generally be one erring on the side of caution. As soon as you go back to training you are loading again and you can go back to square one if there is a breakdown.\n‘I would think at this point in the season, unless someone’s rehab goes incredibly well or there are really important games you absolutely need a player back for, they are probably going to be more conservative and ensure there is no recurrence.’\nWill Merino be fit in time for Spain’s World Cup campaign?\nMerino has made 33 appearances for Arsenal this season, stepping into midfield while again proving to be an effective option up front when called upon with six goals this term. He has developed into a similarly key presence in the Spanish national team, scoring eight times in 10 appearances for La Roja in 2025.\nHaving developed into such a key player for his country, the Arsenal star would have been expected to head to the World Cup this summer with Spain opening their campaign against Cape Verde on 15 June. This injury blow could leave that in doubt. But while Arsenal will be understandably cautious, Merino will have the final say.\nMore Trending\n‘Arsenal will want to be protective over him given the expectations they have for him,’ Smith said. ‘The last thing they will want is to go through the rehab process and have someone go off to the World Cup and get hurt.\n‘But at the same time, they will not want to hold a player of that quality back. Spain ill have their own expectations. So it will be a shared decision but the player will decide, taking advice from all involved, both club and country. But there is still lots of time to go. It would be a very different conversation if we were in March or April.’\nMORE: Gary Lineker urges Tottenham to ‘look at’ two ex-Chelsea managers to replace Thomas Frank\nMORE: Keith Andrews fires warning to Arsenal ahead of clash with in-form Brentford\nMORE: Mikel Arteta responds to Tottenham sacking Thomas Frank before Arsenal clash",
