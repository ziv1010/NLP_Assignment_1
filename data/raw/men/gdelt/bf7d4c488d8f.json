  "body_text": "Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel expects his former club to keep up their decent current form and secure a vastly improved Premier League finish this season.\nThe last campaign was something of a disaster for the Red Devils as they finished 15th in the top flight and failed to lift any silverware.\nThat has left them with no European football this season, and after a shock early exit from the Carabao Cup at the hands of Grimsby Town, their schedule is extremely light.\nWith just the Premier League to concentrate on Ruben Amorim’s side are sixth in the table, just three points adrift of a top four spot.\nA win over Newcastle United last time out sees them now sit level on points with Chelsea who hold fifth place, so there is some optimism returning to Old Trafford.\nIconic goalkeeper Schmeichel is not getting carried away, but does think they can maintain their current standards and finish the season about where they are right now.\n‘I think fifth or sixth. Fifth is good, but they’re fighting with another couple of clubs that are doing quite well,’ the Dane said on ViaPlay. ‘But I think that’s the level that Manchester United are at.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘With the signings of [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo they should be able to do fifth or sixth.’\nOn whether he would be pleased with that finish, he said: ‘If fifth gives access to the Champions League I’d be delighted.’\nWhether fifth will be enough for a Champions League spot is yet to be discovered, with the performance of clubs in European competition over the season set to decide the UEFA coefficient.\nSchmeichel was alongside Liverpool legend Jan Molby, who was less convinced about United’s hopes of returning to European competition next season.\n‘I think they’re quite capable of finishing anywhere between fifth and tenth,’ said the former midfielder. ‘I think that’s the problem with Manchester United’s season.\n‘You’re always looking at that next game, if they win it, it’s kind of a good season and if they lose it you’re back to square one.’\nFormer Red Devils captain Roy Keane is also struggling to pin down Amorim’s side, seeing some encouragement but not exactly overwhelmed by their success so far this season.\nAfter the 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day, the Irishman said on Sky Sports: ‘I’m not convinced. He [Ruben Amorim] got a pre-season and signings, they have no Europe but they are still not showing it. We are still waiting. The question marks are still there for me, we talk about top four but they are not ready for that.’\nHe added: ‘Man United just need to be better. We are not going to compare them to the great defensive teams like Arsenal but they need to be better. I still feel that any time I watched Man Utd, as good as they are going forward, teams seem to create chances so easily.\nMore Trending\n‘If you want to make progress as a football club you have to be harder to beat. They need to improve or we will keep talking about the same problems. If they keep giving up chances and goals like they are, they will never make the next step.’\nJamie Carragher has also ruled out the Red Devils from a top four finish, but feels there is no excuse for them not to qualify for Europe.\n‘I don’t think they’ll finish in the top four but they need to get into Europe,’ said the former Liverpool defender.\n‘The bar has been set so low after last season. They spent a good chunk of change in the summer. They should be where they are in the table, qualifying for Europe. The Champions League would be a step too far. They were really good at Aston Villa.’\nMORE: Ruben Amorim tells Man Utd star he has ‘no chance’ of playing against Wolves\nMORE: Chelsea signing targeted for January move just six months after £35.5m transfer\nMORE: Alan Shearer identifies three signings Chelsea need ahead of January transfer window",
