  "body_text": "Turkmenistan’s Arkadag football team has drawn Saudi Arabia’s Al-Nassr, one of the favorites to win the AFC Champions League, in the round of 32. The Riyadh-based club features global football icon Cristiano Ronaldo.\nThe play-off stage draw was held on December 30 in Kuala Lumpur. Arkadag could have faced Jordan’s Al-Hussein or the UAE’s Al-Wasl, but the outcome proved more challenging. Al-Nassr, widely considered a top contender for the title, will now travel to Ashgabat for a critical away match.\nCristiano Ronaldo has been with the Saudi club for three seasons but has yet to play a match in Central Asia. In both 2023 and 2025, Al-Nassr shared a group with Tajikistan’s Istiklol. However, in each case, the matches in Dushanbe occurred late in the group stage, with Al-Nassr having already secured qualification, prompting the club to rest its key players.\nThe upcoming encounter may break that pattern. As the first match of a two-legged tie, Al-Nassr is unlikely to underestimate its opponent.\nArkadag, the reigning AFC Challenge League champion, has established itself as a formidable home team, maintaining an unbeaten record since its founding. In last season’s Challenge League playoffs, Arkadag defeated India’s East Bengal 2-1 and Kuwait’s Al-Arabi 3-0 on home turf.\nIn this season’s AFC Champions League, the team has continued its strong form, securing a 1-0 win over Bahrain’s Al-Khalidiya and drawing 1-1 with both Uzbekistan’s Andijan and Qatar’s Al-Ahli.\nFor Al-Nassr, the match represents an away challenge against a little-known but dangerous opponent. Arkadag’s home advantage, unwavering support from local fans, and spotless home record make the team a serious threat, even for a club boasting global superstars.\nThe first-leg match is scheduled for February 10 or 11 in Turkmenistan, with the return leg set for February 17 or 18 in Saudi Arabia.\nArkadag is Central Asia’s sole representative in the AFC Champions League round of 32. However, the region will also be represented in the AFC Challenge League playoffs, with Kyrgyzstan’s Muras United advancing to the next stage.\nThe Ashgabat fixture may become not only the highlight of Turkmenistan’s football winter, but also a rare opportunity for Central Asian fans to witness one of the world’s greatest players compete on regional soil.",
