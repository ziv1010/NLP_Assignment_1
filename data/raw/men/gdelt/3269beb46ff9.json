With 11 v 10, the challenge was just too big, so it didn’t go our way.”\nRegarding Johnson’s dismissal for two bookable offences, he said: “I think the first yellow is the key decision, in my opinion. I think we’re really frustrated with that one because as I saw it at the time, Ben Johnson’s running through, takes a touch past the last man and is running at pretty much full pelt with the ball.\n“Dan Burn sticks his leg out, his foot and his knee across Ben. Whether there’s minimum contact, little contact, no contact, I don’t know, but I think it’s natural for the forward in that situation to go over the contact. You don’t have to get smashed by the defender, it’s natural to ride the contact.\n“Of course, whether it’s a foul or no foul is really, really marginal and there will be 100 slow motion replays to see what contact there was that I haven’t seen, but I don’t think there’s any need to give a yellow card. It’s not simulation, he’s not that type of player, I think he’s expecting the contact when Dan Burn sticks his leg out and he tries to get out of the way of the contact.\n“If the referee doesn’t think it’s a free-kick then fair enough, but to book a full-back in that situation makes it really, really difficult.\n“The second yellow, I think in isolation you can say a yellow can be given but when it’s a player’s first foul of the game and the first yellow is a couple of minutes earlier and was very debatable, in my opinion, I’ve said that because it happened earlier in the season.\n“I think a red card in football is such a big thing that there should be room for discretion in those areas when it’s a first foul and it’s very close after a very debatable yellow card.\n“We’ve had a couple of those this season, we had Axel Tuanzebe [at Aston Villa]. Twice the full-back has been sent off for two yellows for one foul and that’s pretty tough to take.\n“I think that had a big impact on the game today. It was tough and it was going to be tough. It had a big impact on the game today but in terms of reflecting on the whole season and stuff like that, we’re not going put it all or hide behind referees in any way.”\nMcKenna had sympathy with Jack Clarke, who was withdrawn for the second game running as the Blues sought to strengthen at the back following a red card, Leif Davis having been given his marching orders against Arsenal at Portman Road last weekend.\n“Frustrating for him,” the Northern Irishman continued. “I thought he started well, to be honest.\n“We spoke about it yesterday, he obviously played against Kieran Trippier last year with Sunderland and it was a big challenge.\n“He was really looking forward to the game and I thought it was a good tussle. They were both going at it and I thought it was set to be a really good battle.\n“Really frustrated for him, but he's taken some good progress in different areas and he's going to be at the club for the long-term and hopefully he can keep improving.”\nRegarding the penalty from which Alexander Isak scored Newcastle’s opening goal following a foul by Julio Enciso on Jacob Murphy, a decision given by VAR after referee Michael Salisbury initially waved away protests, the Blues boss added: “I’ve not pored over it, it looks like there’s a touch, so it can be given.”\nThe defeat confirmed Town’s relegation from the Premier League and McKenna was asked if there was anything different he would have done if he had his time again.\n“Today it’s mathematically to catch teams but you reflect as the season goes on and probably since the Wolves game we’ve known that the climb was going to be too big,” he continued.\n“Of course, there are things to reflect on, of course there are things that we’ll look back at and think we could have done better or differently.\n“But we look back from a position where we’ve tried to do the right thing in a pretty unique jump coming from League One to the Premier League in two seasons, which hasn’t been done in a very long time and I’m not sure it will be done in the way we did it again. There isn’t really a rulebook for that.\n“People can see that the jump from the Championship to the Premier League has grown and has become really difficult and we were in a pretty unique position in the summer.\n“We’ve tried to act in the best interests of the long-term future of the club, while still giving us a chance to be competitive this year. I think we’ve been competitive for the most part.\n“We couldn’t have worked any harder and we’ve tried to do the right things. Of course, there are things that we’ll look back on and think we’ve made good decisions and done the right things and there are things we’ll look back on and think certain things didn’t work out or we could have done a little bit differently. But those reflections are always going to be in detail best kept in-house.”\nMcKenna believes the club is still on an upward curve, despite their stay in the Premier League lasting only one season.\n“I think it’s definitely so from where we were a few years ago,” he insisted. “To establish in the Premier League following the two promotions this season would have been fantastic and we’ve given it our best shot but we’re going to fall short.\n“But I think in almost every aspect, from work at the training ground, work at the stadium, staff infrastructure, people infrastructure, the squad, strength and development of players, I think in every area we’re much stronger than we were a couple of years ago.\n“That doesn’t guarantee us anything, there’s no guarantee that we continue that progression but if we work hard again, if we continued to work as hard as we are, if we do the right things, if we make the right decisions, I think the club’s got a great chance to push on again.”\nAt the end, the Town players and staff were given a warm reception by their supporters sat high in the Leazes Stand Stand and McKenna said it meant a lot.\n“It does,” he said. “We’ve had it plenty of weeks and it’s humbling and incredibly appreciated. I think we’ve got an incredible supporter base, as the team we faced today do and there are some similarities there and the singing for Sir Bobby [Robson] at the end was fantastic.\n“The reception that we got is so appreciated, it’s humbling and we want to keep earning it. We know it’s not just for our efforts this year. I think the supporters can see that the players have given everything today, as they have on so many days, but we’ve fallen short.\n“But they know that everyone’s given everything, but they also know that the journey has been an incredible one and this is now a step back but if we stick together and do the right things it can still be a great springboard to push on again. We really appreciate it.”\nPhoto: TWTD\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nThe same goes for supporters.\nMakes you proud to be a Blue\nThey go down under minimal contact and they get a pen\nI think our set pieces have been better recently- we just mess them up , O shea at the back post at Chelsea and Delap unmarked today do not come about by accident, defending them is not so sharp\nIs anyone thinking that Palmer is rubbish - where was he for their 2nd, he was too small for the 3rd and his kicking is useless. Get Hladky back\nIt might of been 0-0 but the whole game was being played in the Ipswich half. Newcastle were just finding their feet.\nThey had 73% possession 11 corners, 25 shots (5 on target)\nin total.\nWe had 2 corners 5 shots 0 on target, that is the facts , need to not hang on Mckennas every word its just deflection, ive never seen anything like this before in football that the manager with the worst records in the clubs history Is treated like some sort of god for a league 1 promotion, a fluke promotion and a horrific relegation\nCouldn’t possibly level that at some on here!\nEvery thread.\nExtremely booooooooring.\nOh a new one, in a tantrum hello @DWP77\nBeen on the beers?\nToxic BS, so anyone who disagrees that with you is not allowed to have an opinion, you go and support Colchester if you want to see lower league football and applaud losing and have no ambition for IpswichbTown Football Club.\nDoesn't matter if it was a fluke, a miracle, or the greatest promotion of all time, its history, we are relegated with the same players and sane manager and the worst records in club history so you applaud away and wash your mouth out with soap.\n@Barrystedmonds\nTold you before don't like my opinion just don't read it, very easy.\nWho exactly do you think you are? Pushing the agenda that\nIf someone doesn't agree with your narrative then they must not be a supporter or have mental health problems or be brain dead, thats the woke nonsense that we now live in a culture where if an opinion is not agreed with its abuse not stop.\nI am not here to wind people up I am just giving my opinion on how I personally think the club should go forward and there is no better day than the day we got relegated.\nI respect anyone's oponion its a forum but I do not agree with applauding the worst season in the club's history backed up with things like 'we tried hard' , 'we will bounce back stronger', 'Its bad signi gs','its long term injuries', 'It's Muric', 'we are best of bottom three', 'Next season will be better with 'Burns and Chaplin', 'we will bounce back stronger', In Mckenna we trust' its every excuse accept the facts, Davis was diabolical, Morsy too old, Mckenna too soft and arrogant, you can't compete in Prem with league 1 players.\nLook at Yesterday,Newcastle bri g on Anthony Gordon and we bring on Luongo\nHe has Cajuste on bench who was injured, how bad a manager is it to let an injured player travel to Newcastle even if he wanted too.\nAnd who is 'We'?\nSo this isn't a forum and is like a cult because you say opinions are allowed but only ones you agree with, that's not democracy that's dictatorship.\nThere are some really articulate posters who dont agree with me but will put their arguement across without abuse and name calling and obscenities.\nIf you know everything answer this - We got relegated, we were always likely to get relegated, the owners and Ashton and many supporters outside of this forum would like to see Ipswich Town football club as an established Premier League club, we competed okay but ultimately the gulf at the moment is massive, we were found out tactically etc so the majority say we will bounce back once the fine margins ironed out etc so we are only allowed 25 players in Championship, we have 4 loans going 5 coming back. So we have the squad as big as it can be. You want Mckenna and all the league 1 signings to stay, we know most can compete in Championship but not in the Prem and the standard will be the same next year. Alot have contracts up in 2026 and won't play in Prem if we got back there, we need to mould a team who can first of all get us promoted again and secondly be equipped to stay up So with that in mind out of the squad 26 players, we will have at end of season, who goes? And who stays? And if all the league 1 lot stay how do we possibly improve? And if Mckenna stays how is he going to improve when he is following his philosophy and doesn't want or like change?\nStraightforward question what's the masterplan to match the owners ambitions?\n@poet as per you literally described your own post with your own post, with no topic that's an art form, have you got on opinion on how and with who we get back to Prem with, or you like rest trying to grind me down with insults?\nI responded because it was an attempt at undermining my opinion. Still can't answer question can you, none of Mckenna fanclub can, very straightforward, who stays, who goes and who then has the ability from squad now to become established in the Prem and how will Mckenna do it with his favourites who just got us relegated?\nAnd I'd love some insight on which teams we are better than in top half of Chsmpionship? Boro, Saints, Leicester, Birmingham, Wrexham, West Brom, Luton, Sunderland, Sheff Utd to blame a few breezing past them are we, obvs 1 will go up? All them teams will want to get back in Prem.\nWe haven't beaten Southampton or Leicester this season so why would we next? Leicester have us and Southampton still to play so they are likely to go above us and then watch Man City will go down, Leicester stay up and that's another huge team to contend with!\nNo answers only excuses\nWe needed to address this in the summer whether we went up or not and the majority of our signings have not been physically stronger or quick enough. The signing of Philogene seemed to be a confused one in my eyes\nMaybe we have all been drawn into thinking that McKenna is capable of turning water into Wine - the previous 2 seasons suggested he might be able to but everyone has a limit.\nWe are in a better position than so many clubs below us - Coventry 4-1 showed that we have better finishers, we should have beaten Southampton and Leicester in all the games we played this season and we could easily have lost all 4 games last season against these 2 - so maybe progress is being made against the other clubs with parachute payments. West Brom have lost key players and Jed Wallace is now 50. Birmingham, Wrexham are unknown have momentum and can maybe compete but they will be looking at us and naming 8 players who can score 10 goals + at this level\nWho knows what the squad looks like in August but I'm pretty optimistic that we will be in the top 4 at least.\nOff the pitch the recruitment has to learn and improve.\nNice Post and I respect your opinion totally.\nIt's seems that again though there is no mention of the lack of quality capable of Premier League football and the signings thing everyone talks who are weak is surely only Phillogene, J Clarke and Hutchibson and it was the first to that ran Coventry down and both have a big turn of pave, they did so well because they both played in their natural positions in FA Cup.\nThe two newly promoted clubs will attract very good signings as will Wrexham, If Sheff Utd or Sunderland don't go up they both have good squads, Leicester will have a fresh start, Southampton will have a huge amount of money to spend as they have some individuals who will go, Boro have good squad, Luton are similar to Ipswich with league 1 players who once their Prem experienced talent left they were nothing, Adebayo got 10 in the Prem only handful this year so shows how important Gareth Barry, Ogbene and Andros Townsend were.\nWe have the speed and talented forwards and wings potent in fact but the problem is Mckenna won't play them.\nWe need defense solid and that means a new LB to vover Townsend and a RB if Tunazabe goes. Davis will be first name on Mckennas team sheet and playing him makes wingers pointless, he will have Davis on left and Burns on right, he can't let go and that's why we may do okay top 10 but if we did win promotion again we know they aren't good enough in Prem so surely we need the next generation in securing Prem status.\nI think it was the old signings (not all) and Mckennas stubborness is why we are relegated.\nPalmer was shocking yesterday but like me Muric is hated on here and he could be the difference his statsvwhen Burnley went up are excellent.\nAppreciate your opinion without abuse.\nTHE most disappointing thing, and it happens here too often, is fans turning on each other. Apart from the ones that turn up away again and again, generally our fans could do a lot better.\nIts likely we will have a good season next year. Everyone should be behind the efforts we make. Progress doesn't come easy, but it's progress we are making.\n.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
