I was looking around for a club to support, and all my friends at school were either Manchester United fans or Chelsea fans.'\nDetermined not to follow a 'run-of-the-mill' team, William opted to support Aston Villa.\nIn an interview with The Sun, the prince revealed he had a 'nice connection' with the club as they lifted the European Cup in 1982 - 'the year I was born'.\n'I wanted to have a team that was more mid-table, that could give me the more emotional rollercoaster moments,' he explained.\n'To be honest, now, looking back, that was a bad idea - I could have had an easier time!'\nWilliam confirmed that family friends who were 'big Villa fans' took him to one of his first FA cup games at the age of 17.\nIt was the semi-final between the Bolton Wanderers versus Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium on April 2, 2000 - a match that certainly would have set the prince's heart racing.\nThe agonisingly close game went into penalties when Aston Villa thankfully emerged triumphant, winning 4-1.\nLike father like son: Prince George has been spotted at Villa Park with his father on a number of occasions\nPrince William was born in n June 21, 1982 - the same year Aston Villa lifted the European Cup\n'It was fantastic,' the prince recalled.

It was the atmosphere, the camaraderie, and I really felt that there was something I could connect with.'\nAlthough Villa did not go on to win the FA cup that year, William was not put off.\n'I kept an eye on Villa from then on but didn't get too involved initially,' he said. 'But Villa being relegated to the Championship in 2016 got me even more interested, strangely.'\nSince, Prince William has been a regular if anonymous contributor to online discussion sites.\nOne of the eight Villa supporters to meet the prince at Wetherspoon's in Birmingham, Steve Jones revealed: 'He said he keeps abreast of Villa gossip because he is on all the fans’ forums.\n'He goes under different names and he posts on there because that’s how he gets the feeling of what’s going on and what’s the opinion.'\nWilliam's favourite villa player? Paul McGrath - a stalwart defender nicknamed 'God' who played for Villa between 1989 and 1996.\nThe Prince of Wales, who now lives between Kensington Palace in London and Adelaide Cottage in Windsor, admitted that getting to Villa Park 'isn't the easiest thing for me'.\nBut he tries his best to attend all the Champions League game - often with childhood friend Thomas Van Straubenzee as well as William and Edward Van Cutsem.",
