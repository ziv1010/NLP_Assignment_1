  "body_text": "After the last game of the year involving Nigerian players abroad, ABIODUN ADEWALE presents the numbers of five forwards with Ademola Lookman reigning supreme again\nAdemola Lookman (Atalanta – 22 goals and 12 assists)\nAfrican Player of The Year for every reason, Lookman has once again come tops with his contribution for his club among Nigerian strikers thanks to his 22 goals and 12 assists in 42 games across all competitions (excluding club friendlies) for Atalanta in 2024.\nDespite missing the start of the year with the club due to his participation at the 2023 AFCON which was held between January and February in Ivory Coast, the 27-year-old returned to action on February 25 against AC Milan.\nHis first goal of the year for the club came against Bologna in a 2-1 home defeat on March 3 while his first assist was also during a 2-1 defeat at Cagliari on April 7.\nLookman didn’t look back from there and added more goals, including a historic hat-trick in the final of the UEFA Europa League which sealed Atalanta’s first-ever European title.\nThe England-born forward surely had a great year and capped it off by winning the 2024 African Player of The Year award.\nVictor Osimhen (Napoli/Galatasaray – 21 goals and 4 assists)\nLike Lookman, Osimhen started the year with Nigeria in Ivory Coast and didn’t return to club football until February and ended the year with 21 goals and four assists in 29 games. But the year 2024 could be described as a stormy one for the 26-year-old and he did weather the storm, particularly in the summer transfer window when he had a failed transfer away from Napoli before landing a surprise loan move to Galatasaray.\nOsimhen’s first game at club level in 2024 was a 1-1 draw between Napoli and Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League and the Nigerian announced his return in style with Napoli’s goal in the game. By summer, his relationship with the club had completely broken down and he was looking for a way out before the Turkish giants called.\nIn Turkey, the striker began life with three consecutive assists before netting a brace in their 3-3 draw against Kasimpasa on September 28. He also scored a brace in his last game of the year as they beat Kayserispor 5-1 away from home to solidify their top position in the league.\nCyril Dessers (Rangers – 25 goals and 8 assists)\nGlasgow Rangers forward Dessers played more games than other strikers on this list (54), scoring 25 goals and eight assists in the process. He had the most goals but was bettered by Lookman in terms of goals plus assists while Osimhen’s less number of games gave him the edge ahead of the Scotland-based Dessers.\nThe 30-year-old has been busy from the second day of the year, providing an assist in their 3-1 win over Kilmarnock in a league game before grabbing his first goal of the year 18 days later in the 4-1 Scottish Cup win over Dumbarton.\nTolu Arokodare (Genk – 20 goals and 4 assists)\nArguably one of the most in-form Nigerian strikers abroad, Arokodare has been on the ascendancy since joining Genk in January 2023 and seems to have settled fully in Belgium. He played his first game for Genk this year on January 20 and his first goal was on February 11 during their 1-a draw at Mechelen. He has been in great form since the start of the 2024 campaign and that has propelled him to the top of the Belgium Pro League scoring chart with 13 goals in 20 games so far this season. His club Genk are also on top of the table with 42 points from 20 games.\nVictor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen – 13 goals and 2 assists)\nPlagued by injury at the start of the year, Boniface is currently sidelined and has managed a decent 13 goals and two assists in 26 games, proving he can be a prolific goal scorer when fit.\nThe 23-year-old started the year on the treatment table, missing three months of action including the AFCON. He returned in April, playing 26 minutes in a DFB Pokal game and marked his return with a goal during their 2-0 win over West Ham United in the Europa League. His last goal of the year was scored in October and he’s been out with a thigh injury since the end of November.",
