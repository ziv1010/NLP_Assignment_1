The Gunners remain hopeful over an extension for defender William Saliba, but an announcement isn't imminent.\nArsenal's improved output in attack has been key to their success this season, with Gabriel Martinelli, Saka, Odegaard and Gabriel Jesus all hitting ten plus goals. The young backline consisting of Aaron Ramsdale - who has penned a new deal - Saliba, Gabriel and Ben White has also surpassed expectations.\nThe majority of players mentioned are all under the ripe age of 25, which provides Arteta and his entourage with an encouraging skeleton to build upon.\nCentral midfield rebuild\nOdegaard been brilliant in connecting midfield and attack throughout the campaign, while Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey were consistent for much of the title charge before the wheels starting to fall off.\nHowever, upgrades on Xhaka and Partey are out there and Arsenal need to make the central midfeld area a priority in the summer transfer window.\nThe benefit of sealing Champions League football for the first time since 2016 will make the Gunners a much more attractive option for a world-beating central midfielder, a category in which Declan Rice fits into.\nXhaka is set to leave and Partey hit a poor patch of form, making this summer an opportune time to bring in some midfield reinforcements, even with January addition Jorginho.\nSign an elite goalscorer\nGabriel Jesus is a fantastic forward, but in order to dethrone City, Arsenal need to acquire some further firepower. Someone with the same output as Erling Haaland, maybe? Is that too much to ask?\nDespite missing a chunk of this season after picking up an injury at the World Cup, the Brazilian frontman managed to score 10 goals and assisted a further six in his first campaign in north London.\nInterestingly, the Gunners do have the services of 21-year-old Folarin Balogun, who was loaned out to French side Reims where he has netted 19 goals in Ligue 1 this term. The now-USA international deserves further exposure at the Emirates Stadium, but Arteta may be wary of his lack of credibility in England shown by his less than impressive three goals in 18 matches for Middlesbrough.\nTheir May clashes with Liverpool and West Ham were prime examples of the lack of ruthless finishing as they ceded two-goal leads in back-to-back fixtures. When opportunities to put games to bed go amiss, it's clear that prolific goal threats are needed up top and Arsenal would be wise to scour the market for that this summer.\nRead the latest Arsenal news here\nImprovements in squad leadership\nYou think of the great teams ingrained in football folklore and the common denominator between them all is clear leadership, which you could suggest Arsenal lack.\nThey may be blessed with the second youngest squad in the Premier League behind the freshly relegated Southampton, but critics have suggested their failure to control emotions contributed to their title hopes dying.\nArsene Wenger's Arsenal teams were not just packed with quality but with leaders such as Tony Adams, Martin Keown, Lee Dixon and Patrick Vieira to name a few. A boost in leadership in the dressing room and out on the pitch would provide them with that extra edge.\nCentral defender reinforcements\nArsenal's downfall coincided with the absence of Saliba, who picked up an injury in their second-leg clash against Sporting CP in the Europa League. Rob Holding replaced him at first before January arrival Jakub Kiwior was given a chance.\nBoth Holding and Kiwior are comfortable defenders in their own right but the gap in quality between that duo and Saliba is undeniably stark, and Arsenal's results have suffered.\nAt just 22 and 25 years old respectively, Saliba and Gabriel provide Arsenal with a suitable defensive pairing who have proved they can operate together. The problem lies, however, with the squad depth if one of them is unavailable.\nJust compare Arsenal's defensive options to champions City, who have the likes of Ruben Dias, John Stones, Manuel Akanji, Nathan Ake and Aymeric Laporte at their disposal. That's the difference Arsenal and any other title hopefuls will need to make up next season.\nLISTEN NOW\nOn this edition of The Chronicles of a Gooner, part of the 90min podcast network, Harry Symeou looks back at Nottingham Forest 1-0 Arsenal in the Premier League, discussing the team selection and performance and Manchester City being crowned champions.
