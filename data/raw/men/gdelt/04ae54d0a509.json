We are in big, big trouble.\n“I had the feeling we were tired in the last games. We will decide tomorrow what we have to do.”\nThe absence of key players such as Nathan Aké, Phil Foden, and Kyle Walker due to injuries only compounds City’s woes. Foden’s late exit from the draw against Real Madrid further emphasises the fragility of the squad, while the ongoing fitness concerns of Aké and Walker add to the manager’s selection headaches.\nAs City prepares to face Luton Town, a struggling opponent, Guardiola faces a delicate balancing act. The need to secure three points while also managing the fitness of his squad presents a formidable challenge. The outcome of this balancing act could have far-reaching consequences for City’s season and Guardiola’s legacy at the club.",
