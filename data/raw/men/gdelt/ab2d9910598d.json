  "body_text": "FOOTBALL – Manchester City survived an FA Cup scare for the second straight game as they beat second-tier strugglers Plymouth Argyle 3-1 to reach the quarter-finals last night.\nTeenager Nico O’Reilly saved City’s blushes with two headed goals after Maksym Talovierov had sent thousands of visiting fans into delirium by heading Plymouth into the lead.\nPlymouth were unable to emulate their shock victory over Premier League leaders Liverpool in the fourth round and City will now be big favourites to win the Cup for the third time under Pep Guardiola.\nCity also had to come from behind to beat third-tier Leyton Orient in the previous round.\nO’Reilly headed home a Kevin de Bruyne cross in first-half stoppage time and City laid siege to Plymouth’s goal in the second period before O’Reilly again was in the right place to head De Bruyne’s corner into the net in the 76th minute.\nDe Bruyne rounded off an impressive display by making absolutely sure of City’s progress in the final minute with a tap-in after Erling Haaland had been denied.\nThe FA Cup is Premier League champions City’s last chance for silverware this season after stumbling badly in the domestic league and crashing out of the Champions League to Real Madrid.\nPlymouth are second-bottom of the Championship but held their own against City with a display every bit as gritty as in their stunning victory over Liverpool.\nEarlier, Premier League high-flyers Bournemouth reached the FA Cup quarter-finals for only the third time as they knocked out Wolverhampton Wanderers to join Crystal Palace in the last eight after they beat second-tier Millwall.\nPalace’s 3-1 victory was marred, however, by an injury to in-form French forward Jean-Philippe Mateta who was taken to hospital with concussion and a head wound after being clattered by Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts who was sent off.\nBournemouth are chasing a European qualifying spot in the Premier League and their superb season under Andoni Iraola continued as they beat top-flight rival Wolves 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw on the south coast.",
