  "body_text": "Manchester City picked up a comfortable Champions League win over Galatasaray on Wednesday night, but suffered a setback as Jeremy Doku was forced off through injury.\nThe Belgian limped out of the game at the Etihad after 37 minutes, replaced by Phil Foden.\nIt was frustrating timing for the winger as he had looked in tremendous form, providing assists for both Erling Haaland and Rayan Cherki to give City a 2-0 lead.\nThat is how the game finished as Pep Guardiola’s side secured a place in the top eight of the group stage, so head straight into the last 16.\nDoku’s injury was described as ‘a knock’ by Manchester City’s official socialmedia account during the game, but Guardiola suggested it was a calf problem after the contest.\n‘It’s a big miss,’ he told TNT Sports. ‘Jeremy is such an important player for many reasons. The creativity in the final third. But yeah, we’ll see.’\nAdding in a post-match press conference, he said: ‘Injured. A calf. Felt something.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nAsked whether Doku would likely miss Manchester City’s trip to face Tottenham on Sunday, he said: ‘I think so.’\nIt will be frustrating for the 23-year-old who has only recently returned from injury, which kept him out of a string of games earlier this month.\nThe win for Manchester City secures their spot in the top eight of the Champions League group, which will be a relief after an up-and-down European campaign.\nThe defeat at Bodo/Glimt earlier this month was a stunning loss, but five wins from eight games have proved enough to head straight into the last 16 and avoid a play-off, finishing eighth.\nMore Trending\nGuardiola told TNT: ‘[Making the top eight] was the first target, being so tight. We had many chances to score more goals. We could not do that and in the end was in the hands for other teams. We come back and try to improve.’\nOn his side’s performance, he said: ‘I think the first half was much better than the second and the second had more chances than the first. The second half still we are not at our best. We continue.’\nCity do not have to worry about the play-offs, but they already know that they will face one of four sides which are heading into the two-legged affairs.\nCity or Sporting will take on Benfica, Bodo/Glimt, Inter Milan or Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League.\nMORE: Antonio Conte takes swipe at Chelsea after Napoli’s Champions League exit\nMORE: Jose Mourinho aims dig at his critics after wild Benfica win over Real Madrid\nMORE: Joe Cole singles out Chelsea star for praise after Champions League win over Napoli",
