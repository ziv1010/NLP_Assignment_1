  "body_text": "Brazilians have a word for players like Jair Cunha, Nottingham Forest’s latest defensive recruit. He is a classic example of a Xerifao, a big sheriff, the kind of centre-back whose very physique screams authority and ruggedness.\nCunha is just shy of two metres tall (6ft 6in). He is only 20, probably still filling out, but is already a big slab of rock.\nAdvertisement\nOne glance at him and you immediately worry for any forward hoping to match him for strength. Anyone hoping to beat him in the air should probably source some crampons, because they’re going to need to climb him first.\nThere is more to Cunha’s game than the brute dimensions of his skeleton, however. He is confident on the ball, smart with his positioning and loves to compete. There is no getting around it, though, like there is no getting around him: it is that frame that has propelled him from relative obscurity in Brazil to the Premier League in the space of a year.\nIf you were feeling corny, you’d call it a tall tale.\nFor Cunha, it began in Orlandia, a little rural town in the state of Sao Paulo and on the outskirts of nowhere. His early passion was athletics: Cunha, taller than average from day dot, dominated the 50-metre dash and long jump in local competitions.\nWhen he played football, it was as a forward. His father, a striker at amateur level, had designs on not-so-little Jair following in his footsteps. Even his name was part of the plan: Cunha was named after Jairzinho, the attacking hurricane of Brazil’s 1970 World Cup win.\nCunha played for his local team until the age of 11, when he came onto the radar of Juary, a former Santos player now known as a crack talent-spotter. “He was already tall and strong,” Juary told Brazilian sports news outlet GloboEsporte last year. “He read the game and anticipated well. He had a good pass on him and was good in the air. I thought he would make a great centre-back.”\nJuary signed him up. Cunha moved to Santos, based in the city of that name, an hour’s drive south of Sao Paulo, living with family friends until his mother could join him. It was a big change for a kid not yet in his teens, but he settled well and progressed serenely through the ranks at Santos, eventually signing his first professional contract in June 2021, aged 16. The inclusion of a €70million (£61m;$82m) buyout clause laid bare the esteem in which the club held him.\nAdvertisement\nAt the start of 2022, Cunha did well in the Copinha, Brazilian football’s big under-20s competition (and scouting bonanza), despite being four years younger than some of his opponents. By the end of that season, he was training with the Santos first team and earning rave reviews — along with comparisons with a former captain of Brazil.\n“He’s 17 and has a lot of quality,” Santos’ then-head coach Lisca said in August 2022. “He reminds me of Lucio when he came through: a bit rough around the edges, but strong and committed. Jair has enormous potential. He’s tall and fast. I’m desperate to throw him into the team, but there’s a right time for everything.”\nCunha’s favourite player during his adolescence was Real Madrid and Spain centre-back Sergio Ramos. The youngster is relatively two-footed and tidy on the ball, but we’re not really talking about a guy who is going to ping 30-yard passes around. Lucio — leggy, brave, sturdy in the challenge — is probably more appropriate as a reference point.\nIn January 2023, Cunha suffered a major setback. Back with the under-20s for another Copinha, he collapsed to the ground during a game and left the pitch screaming. Scans revealed a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament and damaged meniscus in his right knee.\nHe didn’t play again for 10 months. He did, though, keep growing: when he returned, he was 2cm taller than he was before the injury.\nCunha made his senior debut at the end of 2023. Then, when Santos lost regular centre-back Joaquim to injury in July last year, he broke into the starting XI and stayed there, putting in a string of assured performances as the seasiders won the Brazilian second division title in November. By the end of the season, Santos were fielding — and turning down — offers for him from Porto of Portugal and Italy’s Atalanta.\nAdvertisement\nWhen he did leave Santos in February, it wasn’t for Europe but for fellow Brazilians Botafogo. It struck some as a sideways move. A risky one, too, given that the Rio de Janeiro side had a high-class centre-back pairing in Alexander Barboza and Bastos. An injury to the latter, though, gifted Cunha his chance and he surfed a wave of momentum into the Club World Cup.\nIt was in the U.S. this summer that the secret really got out. Cunha was magnificent in a shock 1-0 win against UEFA Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain, holding Goncalo Ramos at arm’s length throughout and coolly playing through the French press. He also scored his first senior goal in the group-stage victory against Seattle Sounders, powering home a brilliant header.\nIn other circumstances, those displays would have had scouting departments across Europe scrambling for their phones. Forest, though, had already set up the deal that brought both Cunha and team-mate Igor Jesus, a striker, to Nottingham. The Club World Cup just served to make that double swoop look like less of a gamble than it otherwise might have.\nCunha is still young. He only has 46 senior appearances to his name. He is far from the finished product.\nThe potential, however, is clear.\nLiving up to it will be a tall order, but tall shouldn’t be too much of a problem for the City Ground’s new giant.\n(Top photo: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images)",
