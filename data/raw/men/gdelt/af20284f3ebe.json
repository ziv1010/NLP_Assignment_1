  "body_text": "The next Manchester United manager odds after Amorim is sacked\nSir Gareth Southgate heads a list of names being considered by Sir Jim Ratcliffe\nSir Gareth Southgate has emerged as a frontrunner to become the next Manchester United manager after Ruben Amorim was sacked.\nListen to this article\nThe Portuguese gaffer was fired on Monday following a 1-1 draw with Leeds at Elland Road, which leaves the Red Devils sixth in the Premier League after 20 games.\nAmorim spent more than £200m on Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbuemo, and Matheus Cunha over the summer after the side finished only 15th last season and lost the Europa League final.\nUnited were also humiliated in the early stages of the League Cup, losing on penalties to the fourth tier side Grimsby Town.\nFormer player Darren Fletcher will be in charge of Wednesday’s match against Burnley, with Amorim having left the same day as Celtic sacked their manager Wilfried Nancy.\nOnly a few days earlier, Chelsea parted ways with Enzo Maresca.\nManchester United’s director of operations Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire boss of chemicals company Ineos, is yet to name a full-time replacement but Sir Gareth has been hotly linked.\nThe former England manager has been out of football since leading the Three Lions to the final of Euro 2024 and is the bookies’ fourth favourite, according to Oddschecker.\nWhat is Sir Gareth Southgate doing now?\nTwo days after England lost to Spain in the final of Euro 2024, Sir Gareth stepped down as manager.\n\"As a proud Englishman, it has been the honour of my life to play for England and to manage England. It has meant everything to me, and I have given it my all,” he said.\n“But it's time for change, and for a new chapter.”\nHis “new chapter” has, however, been out of the public eye and seen him work as Goodwill Ambassador for the Prince's Trust.\nSir Gareth is also known to be writing a book and has business interests outside of football, but although aware that few positions could top a World Cup semi-final, he hasn’t ruled out a return to the dugout.\n“You can’t say never to anything because 15 years ago I left Middlesbrough and I wasn’t certain I would manage then,” he said last year.\nWho could be the next Manchester United manager?\nAll odds were taken from Oddscheker at 4.30pm on Monday, January 5.\nDarren Fletcher (5/1)\nThe interim manager was a midfielder for years under his fellow Scot Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and went onto play for West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City.\nThe 41-year-old has been in charge of United’s under-18 side for the past year.\nXavi (12/1)\nXavi Hernandez, who played for Barcelona and Spain under his first name, is out of work, having been sacked as manager by his old club in April 2024. The 45-year-old is known for an attacking style and for developing young players.\nEnzo Maresca (11/4)\nThe Italian is an option, having last week left Chelsea - who he steered to World Club Cup glory last summer in the US.\nThe 45-year-old had admitted to speaking to Manchester City about potentially taking over as manager in the future.\nGareth Southgate (7/1)\nSir Gareth is also a free agent and has been out of work since leaving England in 2024.\nWhile he could return to the game, the Mirror has reported he has “serious reservations” about taking over at Manchester United.\nOliver Glasner (6/4)\nA favourite for the role is Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner, who led the Eagles to their first ever trophy, in winning last season’s FA Cup.\nThe Austrian has set up a tough side on a limited budget and made stars of Marc Guehi and Jean-Philippe Mateta.\nAndoni Iraola (16/1)\nThe Bournemouth manager has great credentials having guided the Cherries to a top ten finish last season.\nWhile their 2025-26 campaign has had its ups and downs, United would do well to lure the Spaniard to the north west.\nMarco Silva (20/1)\nAn outside bet is Fulham’s Marco Silva, who has settled at the West London club, having had spells in charge of Hull, Watford and Everton.\nThe Portuguese led Fulham to 54 points last season, which was their highest ever total.\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer (22/1)\nSolskjaer was in charge of United from 2018 to 2021 but has been out of the dugout since, save for a brief spell at Besiktas last year.\nThe Norwegian led the club where he played as a striker in the 1990s and 2000s to second in 2020-21, but was sacked later that year after a poor run.\nKieran McKenna (14/1)\nThe Ipswich manager has only managed his current club but worked as a coach of Manchester United from 2016 to 2021.\nHaving led the Tractor Boys to the Premier League in 2024-25, he has since readjusted to life in the Championship after an instant relegation.\nLaurent Blanc (33/1)\nFormer centre back Blanc finished his playing career with United in 2003 and has since gone onto coach PSG as well as the France national team.\nNow 60, Blanc most recently managed Al-Ittihad in the Saudi Pro League.",
