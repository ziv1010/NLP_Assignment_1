  "body_text": "Bukayo Saka has been ruled out of this weekend’s huge Premier League clash between Arsenal and Liverpool after suffering a hamstring injury.\nAnd while it is said his injury is not as bad as first feared, the England winger could also miss the game against Manchester City at the end of September.\nSaka scored the second goal of Arsenal’s 5-0 thrashing of Leeds United last Saturday to help the Gunners go top of the Premier League table.\nBut the mood at the Emirates was dampened as both Saka and captain Martin Odegaard hobbled off injured, the latter badly hurting his shoulder in the first-half.\nWhile unable to give a proper update on the pair, Mikel Arteta said Saka’s injury was ‘significant’, with fans fearing the worst after the talisman spent four months on the sidelines last season due to a tear on his other hamstring.\nHowever, early scans indicate that neither player will be out for the long-term, with BBC Sport now reporting that Saka will miss up to four weeks.\nIf this is the case, the 23-year-old will not return to action until after the first international break of the season.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

He plays on that side, that’s where he likes to play… fill that gap until Saka comes back because he’s got a chance now.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Liverpool face surprise Premier League rivals in race to sign Marc Guehi\nMORE: Gary Neville predicts who will replace injured Bukayo Saka for Arsenal’s clash with Liverpool\nMORE: Carabao Cup clash looks a must-win affair for under-fire Wolves and West Ham managers",
