From humble beginnings in a social welfare house, wearing second-hand shoes, to representing both the German and Philippines national teams.\n“From cage football and facing endless doubters to winning titles in Europe and Asia-the buzz has been unreal! I’m forever grateful for every moment.\n“Here’s to new ventures and new beginnings as I kickstart a new adventure.”\nSchrock’s announcement brings down the curtain on an eventful 20-year career for the talented midfielder.\nHe first played for the Philippines against Sri Lanka in June 2011 having previously represented Germany at age group level and he was a key member of the squad that reached the final of the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup in the Maldives.\nSchrock had represented Germany at under 18, under 19 and under 20 level while starting his club career with Greuther Furth in 2004 before stints with 1899 Hoffenheim and Eintracht Frankfurt.
