  "body_text": "The survival celebrations were in full swing at Molineux and Mario Lemina, swept along by the upbeat mood, allowed himself to become a touch carried away.\n“We are going to try to build from now and, in pre-season, try to have the best shape that Wolves have ever seen,” said the all-action midfielder in the immediate aftermath of Saturday’s narrow victory over Aston Villa.\nWoah there, Mario.\nAdvertisement\nWolves have had some pretty good teams in the past and this one has flirted with relegation. Still, you could see what the likeable Lemina was getting at. From a dreadful situation at Christmas, Julen Lopetegui has orchestrated a remarkable turnaround that could see his side mathematically safe by close of play on Monday. In reality, they are effectively secure already.\nAnd if they are not yet close to the “best shape they have ever seen”, they have given themselves a platform upon which to build something genuinely exciting.\nNow they need a good summer to cash in on Lopetegui’s initial efforts. So what has to happen to ensure they do not find themselves battling the drop again a year from now?\nFind an identity\nIn his 20 games at the helm, Lopetegui has amassed an amazing tally of 30 points with a horses-for-courses approach. The turnaround he has overseen has been astonishing.\nBut he has used a range of players, several different systems and varying tactical approaches to eke out the points he needed to keep his side in the top division.\nWhile a degree of tactical flexibility is commendable, Wolves supporters will now be keen to see what a Lopetegui-inspired Wolves look like moving forward. He has three more games this season, a summer transfer window and a pre-season programme in which to implement a style of play with which supporters can relate.\nSupporters will approve if it is anything like the front-foot approach that defeated Chelsea and Brentford, with a healthy dose of the resilience that saw off Crystal Palace and, on Saturday, Aston Villa.\nResolve Ruben Neves’ future\nTo a large degree, what happens next to the inspirational captain will be out of Wolves’ control, but it wouldn’t half help to know early what the summer is going to look like for the Portugal midfielder.\nAdvertisement\nIt has long been assumed behind the scenes that this will be the summer when Neves departs and that remains the working hypothesis. Yet nothing is guaranteed.\nBarcelona, long been seen as a likely destination for Neves, are currently out of the running. Their head coach, Xavi, does not share the enthusiasm of others at the club to sign Neves, which will leave agent Jorge Mendes looking for an alternative.\nAny bidder must tick two boxes.\nThey must offer Neves Champions League football and be able to pay both him and Wolves what they require.\nThere are only a handful of clubs that could possibly fit the bill. Neves seeing out his contract and spending a final year at Molineux would be welcomed by many fans, but the prospect of him leaving for nothing next summer would be the worst-case scenario financially and leave Wolves with even less to spend in a summer where the net outlay is expected to be modest.\nWhatever happens, the mutual adoration between him and the club is not under threat.\n“I don’t know what is going to happen, but it doesn’t matter what happens — the club will always be in my heart and I will always follow the club everywhere,” Neves told BBC WM after his 250th Wolves appearance on Saturday.\n“Who knows, if I go, whether I will come back again. You never know.”\nSign a goalscorer\nWolves have undoubtedly improved under Lopetegui, but they are still crying out for a striker who can score regularly — a weapon they have been lacking since Raul Jimenez was in his prime.\nDiego Costa and Matheus Cunha have struck up a promising partnership, but have managed just three goals between them this season and are the only recognised strikers to find the net in the league.\nWith Costa likely to depart when his contract expires this summer, Sasa Kalajdzic expected to need time to return to full speed after a season out with a serious knee injury and Fabio Silva’s future still far from clear, adding goals from forwards must be a priority for Lopetegui and the club.\nClear out the deadwood\nThere are some players who, despite his diplomatic words in press conferences, Lopetegui clearly does not consider part of his plans.\nAdvertisement\nJonny has not featured since being sent off against Leeds. Rayan Ait-Nouri was involved on Saturday as an unused substitute, but that was his first appearance in a matchday squad for almost two months. Modern-day great Jimenez has been missing, too, with Lopetegui citing niggling injury concerns.\nWolves need to be ruthless with the players Lopetegui does not want, find a way to clear the decks and allow him to build the best squad possible to suit his needs.\nAdd leadership\nWith Neves potentially departing and Joao Moutinho and Costa among those whose contracts are due to expire, the most senior figures in the Wolves squad could all be gone.\nIt is an issue that must be factored into Wolves’ plans for the summer transfer window.\nNot only will Lopetegui need players who can slot into his tactical plan, but he will need characters who can lead the group and ensure the head coach’s standards are upheld, as well as galvanising the side in tricky situations.\nTackle those issues and Wolves can seek to kick on.\n(Top photo: Jack Thomas – WWFC/Wolves via Getty Images)",
