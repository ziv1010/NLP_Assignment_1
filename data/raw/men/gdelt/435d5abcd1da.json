  "body_text": "Tottenham are reportedly planning to make a move for England international Eberechi Eze once the Three Lions’ Euro 2024 campaign is over.\nThe Crystal Palace star is attracting interest from several Premier League stars but it is said that Spurs are leading the race for his signature.\nIt is not surprising to see Eze so coveted after a fantastic season with the Eagles where he scored 11 goals and made six assists in 31 appearances.\nNine of these came in the final 12 games of the campaign under new manager Oliver Glasner, with this upturn in form earning the 25-year-old a place in Gareth Southgate’s squad for the Euros.\nLast week, he made his major tournament debut, coming off the bench to play the last 22 minutes of England’s 1-1 draw with Denmark.\nEze, who previously spent five years in Arsenal’s academy, joined Palace from QPR in 2020 in a deal worth £15million.\nLike so many other Palace players, Eze has been linked with a big money move away from Selhurst Park this summer and, according to The Athletic, Tottenham will ‘push to buy’ the player once he returns from the Euros.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nAnge Postecoglou’s side are confident they can beat their rivals to the player and have not been put off by his release clause which is believed to be around £60m.\nMore Trending\nIt has previously been reported that Eze is content to stay in south London and would only consider leaving if he feels the buying club can fulfil his ambitions.\nIt is for this reason that Palace teammate Michael Olise snubbed the opportunity to sign for Chelsea or Manchester United, with the Frenchman now set to join Bayern Munich as they could offer him Champions League football.\nGiven that Glasner’s team are set to receive £60m for Olise, they will be less inclined to let Eze go and as his release clause cannot be triggered in a straightforward manner, it is possible he will be staying put for next season.\nFor now, Eze’s focus is solely on aiding England’s Euro 2024 campaign which continues on Sunday evening when they take on Slovakia in the last-16.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Two Euro 2024 referees sent home by UEFA after complaints\nMORE: Jack Wilshere ‘feels sorry’ for England and Chelsea star Conor Gallagher after Euro 2024 snub\nMORE: Fermin Lopez responds after Manchester United submit £25m bid to sign Barcelona midfielder",
