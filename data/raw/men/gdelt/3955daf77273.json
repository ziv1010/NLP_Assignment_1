  "body_text": "Lille striker and reported Manchester United target Jonathan David has confirmed he is set to become a free agent in the\nsummer when his contract expires and will consequently be available for transfer.\nDavid has been linked to United for several years but a transfer has never materialised.\nWith United expected to be on the market for a reliable goalscorer during the summer window amidst Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund’s struggles for form, speculation that David could finally seal a switch to Old Trafford is rife once again.\nThere were suggestions that United explored the option of signing him in January but a deal failed to get over the line.\nSo far this season, David has scored 20 goals and provided nine assists in 35 appearances across all competitions. His performances played a key role in Lille reaching the last 16 of the Champions League after finishing seventh in the league phase.\nUnsurprisingly, the Canada international is not short of suitors. The likes of Barcelona, Arsenal, Inter Milan and West Ham have all been mentioned to be admirers of his.\nNow, David has seemingly confirmed that he will be available for transfer in the summer as he declared his intention to play for one of the biggest clubs in world football.\nThe 25-year-old told Onze Mondial, “Yes, I will be free at the end of the season. And as for my future, I hope to grow, to become a better player, and to play for the biggest clubs in the world, if I can.”\n“But first of all, I just want to have fun, never forget that football is fun. I started playing football because I had fun.”\n“And even though it has now become my job, you have to remember that I wake up every morning for football, for the pleasure of playing.”\n“Do you want any clues about my future? You will all know, in due time, that is at the end of the season. I will not comment before then.”\nHe added, “First of all, I want to finish this season well, the end looks exciting and I want to play well and help the team. And when the season is over, the decision will be made and announced.”\nMeanwhile, the Red Devils are back in action on Saturday at lunchtime when they face David Moyes’ Everton at Goodison Park.\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
