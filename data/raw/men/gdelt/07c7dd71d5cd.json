But his bet on Paz should not be seen as a mere sop to the gallery.\nAfter receiving final instructions from assistant coach Davide Ancelotti, Paz came on midway through the second half, replacing Brahim Diaz in attacking midfield. His team needed something extra (the score was 2-2 at the time) and he had 25 minutes plus stoppage time to show his football.\nHe didn’t start especially well, playing a little too conservatively and also losing possession a few times. But then, before Wednesday, Paz had only played 22 minutes for the first team across three late substitute appearances this month, twice in La Liga and once in the Champions League — he made his senior debut against Braga in the previous group match three weeks ago.\nEverything then changed in a flash.\nPaz received a pass from Antonio Rudiger about halfway between the Napoli box and the centre circle. In five touches he controlled the ball and turned sharply beyond marker Jens Cajuste, a sixth touch saw him advance towards the edge of the penalty area, and his seventh was a rasping left-footed drive that just had too much power for goalkeeper Alex Meret.\nJoselu would later add the gloss but this was the goal that decided the match.\nAdvertisement\nThe Bernabeu crowd exploded with happiness — not only because of the value or quality of Paz’s strike but the identity of its scorer. It is a fanbase that always puts great hope in young players and, in this case, Paz is recognised as one of the jewels of the Madrid academy.\nGO DEEPER\nInside ‘La Fabrica’: How Real Madrid’s academy turned into a talent factory supplying Spain\nIn celebration, Paz ran towards the left corner of the ground in ecstasy, as if out of himself. His team-mates mobbed him, Rudiger grabbing and pulling him around in special glee. The German defender accompanied him on the walk back to the restart, as Paz listened to his name chanted in the stands and called out over the stadium speakers, almost in disbelief. Rudiger encouraged him to look back to the fans one more time, to soak it all in.\nJudging by his words on Spanish TV after the game, Paz might not quite have been fully aware of just what he had done.\n“I dared; it was in automatic mode and I didn’t know what I was doing. I hit it… and freaked out, really,” he said very spontaneously on Movistar.\nManager Ancelotti embraced him warmly after full-time and again praised the young playmaker at his press conference. “Nico has brought, in a moment of difficulty, what everyone expected,” the Italian said. “For him, it’s a special night. He is a player for the future of Real Madrid. He has all the qualities that a player of the Real Madrid squad must have.”\nPaz was born in Spain, on Tenerife in the Canary Islands, but has been playing for Argentina Under-20s. He is the son of Pablo Paz, a defender for Argentina at the 1996 Olympics (winning silver) and 1998 World Cup. In January, Paz represented Argentina at the South American Under-20 Championship. Their senior team coach Lionel Scaloni included him in a 44-strong provisional squad before last year’s World Cup.\nHe arrived at Madrid’s youth academy from its equivalent at Tenerife in 2016. But his path to experience with the first team has not been as easy as you might expect — he has until recently been rather overlooked, with others promoted instead.\nGO DEEPER\nReal Madrid’s academy, the Dani Carvajal route and dilemma facing youth players\nPaz’s talent has always been appreciated but excitement within the academy truly began to build during his 2021-22 season with the under-18 Juvenil B side, then managed by Fran Beltran.\nAdvertisement\n“I remember an away game against Atletico Madrid — second against first,” Beltran told The Athletic. “Nico was coming back from injury and we were fighting all week with the medical staff so he could play. He could only play 15 minutes. (In the end) he had a little more time and destroyed them. He had not played for a month.\n“Nico is special: the son-in-law we all want, but competitive; technical, but strong; with power, but with creativity and personality. His left foot is so strong and he finishes with his head like a perfect centre-forward.”\nMadrid academy directors have also highlighted Paz’s mix of quality, strength and his ability to withstand harsh physical treatment from rivals. They admire his control in tight spaces, something considered essential when moving up to the first team.\nLast season, Paz stepped up to the under-19 Juvenil A team managed by Alvaro Arbeloa, and in the second half of the campaign featured prominently for Castilla, who narrowly missed out on promotion from the Spanish third tier.\n💬🌟 We're BUZZING too, @BellinghamJude!#UCL pic.twitter.com/KS036xNWUV\n— Real Madrid C.F. 🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@realmadriden) November 29, 2023\nHe also caught manager Ancelotti’s eye and was called up for several senior training sessions.\nAncelotti included him in Madrid’s squad for their first Copa del Rey match of last season in January, and for the La Liga visit to Real Sociedad in May, but he has had to wait until this month for his senior debut. Paz has also played 10 matches for Raul’s Castilla side this season, scoring six goals and providing one assist.\nDuring this process, Argentina’s Football Association (AFA) has been ahead of Spain’s in terms of Paz’s international commitment.\nAt Madrid, they still cannot understand why Spain’s youth sides have never called him up, especially as he did make some preliminary squad lists.\nAdvertisement\nThe AFA, meanwhile, acted quickly and successfully, informed by the scouting of Juan Martin Tassi, who is based in Madrid and tasked with keeping an eye on selectable youth players in Europe. Despite having indicated previously that he wanted to play for Spain, after experiencing an Argentina camp Paz feels convinced he will stay with the current world champions.\nAlso key has been the influence of Bernardo Romeo, coordinator of the Argentina youth teams, under-20s coach Javier Mascherano, who visited Madrid’s Valdebebas training complex last season, and Juan Ignacio Gallego, who guided Paz when he was at the Best Of You agency and is expected to do so again when contracts permit at DC Global, the firm he is at now.\nArgentina have already been enjoying Paz. His next chapter with Madrid is just beginning.\n(Top photo: Florencia Tan Jun/Getty Images)",
