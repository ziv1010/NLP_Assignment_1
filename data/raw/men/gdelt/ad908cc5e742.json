That's my opinion.\"\nIn previous seasons, the top two teams in each group qualified for the last 16. This time around, only the top eight in the league phase were guaranteed a place in that round. The next 16 finishers, which includes Madrid after several disappointing results, first must navigate a two-legged play-off instead.\nIt adds even more matches to the schedule. To reach the final again this season, Madrid will have had to play four more times than they did in 2023/24. The final would be a 17th Champions League game for them this season, compared to it being the 13th last season.\nThe new 32-team FIFA Club World Cup still lies ahead of Madrid in the summer, extending the club season into July. FIFA also added the Intercontinental Cup to the calendar in December.\nWhen UEFA increased the number of Champions League entrants from 24 to 32 in 1999, a second group stage was created that added six additional games for the competing clubs, up to 17 in total for the finalists. The replacement of the second group stage with the last 16 in 2003 significantly reduced the demands and automatically took four games out of the schedule. But, 21 years later, UEFA decided once again that more football, despite the calls against it, was the way to go.\nDue to their placing in the league phase, 11th, Madrid have a 50/50 chance of facing perennial foes Manchester City in the knockout play-off round. But Ancelotti isn't actually too bothered about that, acknowledging that to win the competition, it is necessary to face the biggest sides at some point regardless, whether it be later down the line or in the immediate future.\n\"There will be a draw and whatever comes, comes. Not much changes: to win the Champions League, you have to beat the biggest teams,\" he said.",
