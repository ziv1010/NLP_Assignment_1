And negotiations on this have not resulted in an agreed outcome.\"\nMs Cooper said the government has been \"very clear\" the proceeds from the Chelsea sale \"need to go into humanitarian support in Ukraine\".\n\"It is the Ukrainian people who have suffered as a result of Putin's aggression as a result of this war, and that is where this funding needs to go,\" she added.\nDowning Street said Mr Abramovich would need to set up the foundation and arrange the transfer in line with the licence, otherwise legal action would be taken - although the spokesperson would not say under what legislation they would take action under.\nThis move from the UK government is in line with a wider European push for Moscow to foot the bill for deaths and destruction triggered by its invasion.\nSky News has contacted Mr Abramovich's last known legal representatives in the United States and Belgium for comment.",
