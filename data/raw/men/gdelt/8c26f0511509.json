  "body_text": "Erik ten Hag’s disastrous second season in charge of Manchester United has left him fighting for his position at the club.\nFailing to qualify for next season’s Champions League coupled with an embarrassing early exit from Europe this year has left INEOS under pressure to make a change.\nGiven Ten Hag’s struggles, Dutch journalists claim there is a safe route out of Old Trafford for Ten Hag – back to his former club in The Netherlands.\nFootball expert Marcel van der Kraan says the 54-year-old is the number one choice to take over at Ajax and the Dutch giants have a date in mind to make their move for the United coach.\n“Alex Kroes (Ajax technical director) has got Erik ten Hag at the top of his wanted list. He is his man and will wait for him until the end of this month because by June 1st they have to appoint a manager or make a decision,” he said.\nJournalists Mike Verweij echoed Van der Kraan’s sentiments and believes Ajax will want the issue of a new coach resolved as soon as possible at the end of the current season.\n“It is a kind of poker game, because on the one hand you want to wait for your dream candidate, but not too long, otherwise the trainer’s carousel will start moving and you will miss your numbers two and three (but) Ten Hag is definitely number one,” he said.\nFormer Chelsea and Brighton coach Graham Potter has been heavily linked with both the United and Ajax posts but Valentijn Driesse, another expert on Dutch football, believes there is a clear solution to the situation.\n“The information we have is that he (Potter) is not number one at Ajax either,” he said on a De Telegraaf podcast.\n“I also heard on English radio yesterday that Potter is waiting for Manchester United. That would be a good swap, Potter to United and Ten Hag to Ajax. Ten Hag is just not yet convinced that he should wobble at United,” he added.\nTen Hag’s kamikaze style of play has led to some horror shows throughout the season and his reluctance to change tactics has been the major issue behind United fans’ growing frustration.\nHowever, amidst the chaos, the Dutchman has steered United into back-to-back FA Cup finals and the showpiece occasion against Manchester City next month looks like his only chance to save his position at the club.\nBefore then, United must navigate four tricky looking league games and know they need to go into the final with confidence if they are to stand any chance of avenging last season’s defeat in the competition.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
