  "body_text": "Alexander Isak’s rich goalscoring form continued as Newcastle United took control of their Carabao Cup semi-final with a superb first-leg win against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium.\nNewcastle have never won the competition but will make their second final in three seasons if they avoid defeat, or lose by a one-goal margin, in the second leg at St James’ Park on 5 February.\nArsenal, second in the Premier League, started the tie as favourites, but have it all to do in the return fixture.\nIsak scored his 14th goal in 15 games to set Newcastle on the way to their seventh successive win.\nGoalkeeper Martin Dubravka’s free-kick was launched forward, Sven Botman headed the ball on and Jacob Murphy played it into Isak’s path with the Swede lifting a composed finish past David Raya.\nAnthony Gordon doubled the visitors’ lead in the 51st minute, converting the rebound after Raya could only parry Isak’s shot.\nGabriel Martinelli had hit the post for the Gunners when the game was goalless, with Jurrien Timber and William Saliba also failing to score with close-range headers.\nTottenham host Liverpool in the first leg of the second semi-final on Wednesday (20:00 GMT), with the final at Wembley on 16 March.\nNewcastle fans still dreaming after superb win\nNewcastle have been English champions four times and won six FA Cups, but have not lifted silverware since the Fairs Cup in 1969.\nHowever, their fans will be dreaming this is the year that long wait for a trophy ends.\nEddie Howe’s side, beaten 2-0 by Manchester United in the Carabao Cup final in 2023, know they still have a lot of work to do to get back to Wembley, but the first leg in London could not have gone any better.\nIndeed, history is on their side as since 1987-88 all eight away teams to have a two-goal advantage after a semi-final first leg have reached the final.\nIsak, a striker long linked with a move to Arsenal, showed the Gunners what they were missing with an excellent performance which got him a goal and an assist as he provided constant problems for Gabriel and Saliba.\nJacob Murphy and Gordon also played their part again in Newcastle’s resurgence, but everyone contributed in handing Arsenal their first home loss of the season.\nDubravka made an excellent save to deny Gabriel, with Newcastle’s defending typified by last-ditch blocks from Dan Burn and Botman as they battled to deal with Arsenal’s constant threat from inswinging corners.\nSince a 4-2 loss at Brentford a month ago, the Magpies have beaten Leicester, Brentford, Ipswich, Aston Villa, Manchester United, Tottenham and now the Gunners.\nThat run has lifted Newcastle to fifth in the Premier League, in contention for a return to Champions League football after playing in that tournament last season, though they have no European football this campaign.\nThey now have an FA Cup tie and four league matches before they must focus on the second leg.\nNewcastle fans will already be looking forward to 5 February, which promises to be a raucous evening at St James’ Park, with them hoping to finish the job off and return to Wembley.",
