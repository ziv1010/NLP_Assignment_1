  "body_text": "Everton fans comments on claims Kieran Trippier could sign – Interesting, or is that bizarre?\nEverton fans have been reacting to news that Kieran Trippier could be moving to Goodison Park.\nWidespread reporting claiming the England defender wants to leave Newcastle United to get regular first team football.\nTrippier of course has also seen Bruno Guimaraes now made team captain, with Lascelles ‘club captain’, effectively making the 33 year old now third choice to lead the team in matches, compared to last season United’s captain in all matches he played, unless Lascelles was selected.\nWho knows what truth there is in these claims of Trippier leaving and indeed Eddie Howe is said to still want him to stay regardless, whilst I am not convinced at all that the full-back would drop down as low as Everton if indeed he did leave.\nAnyway, I was intrigued to see what Everton fans were saying about these transfer claims and I have to admit, I was amazed by how much negativity there was.\nI think Kieran Trippier is still a top player and a club/team like Everton, he would be a huge asset.\nEverton fans commenting on widespread reports that Kieran Trippier could be moving from Newcastle United, comments via their Grand Old Team message board:\n‘He was actually abysmal all last season. He is just finished.’\n‘An abysmal season and finished with 10 PL assists.’\n‘He’s 34 years old and stunk the league out last season, bit weird this.’\n‘An aging fullback who’s dubious defensively, but still miles above anything else we have.’\n‘Lunacy! Another abysmal right back to add to the 3 that we already have!’\n‘Good Lord no, we should swerve this absolutely.’\n‘Will sign for us, get a handsome wage, and never play again.’\n‘He’s more fit than the majority of our squad despite being close to his mid 30’s’\n‘Our three right backs would have combined age of 107.’\n‘Do we get a letter from the King for this?’\n‘Tbf he’d probably be so many times better than Young This is our life, we are shopping in the bins.’\n‘If you wouldn’t start him over Ashley Young then there’s something wrong with you.\nThat’s essentially what the question in bringing him here is.\nIs he better than 39 year old Ashley Young ffs?\nObviously yes.’\n‘We’re skint so a loan would make sense, he may be kinda finished but he would still be our best rb by a country mile.’\n‘People turning their nose up at Trippier should be forced to watch Holgate on player cam v Spurs with their eyes pinned open like in Clockwork Orange.’\n‘I will be shocked if he fancies us you know.’\n‘Who would fancy us right now?\nAt this point we’re hanging around waiting for the pub to close and the beer goggles to kick in to even have a chance.’\n‘If this is true I can see stories of DCL to Newcastle resurfacing.’\n‘Ha ha – Hell of a swap deal that!’\n‘I’d rather spend money on the next Trippier at this stage.\nAlso, if Cash is going spare at Villa I wouldn’t mind him.’\n‘Simple facts, Newcastle are recruiting at the level of a team that expects to qualify for the champions league, we aren’t even close to that luxury.\nNewcastle players being replaced by players that can take them forwards short to long term are by and large going to be short term big improvements for us.’\n‘On loan, this would be a good deal for us.’\n‘I think they’re would be less ire if we didn’t already have two fullbacks that were mid thirties and over, but as I stated in another post age is relative , Thiago silva was decent till he was 39.’\n‘Great to see our good work into employment for geriatric full backs continues with such aplomb!\nTake a bow all the staff involved at Everton football club.\nWe are beyond parody now as a football entity. An absolute laughingstock!\nThe sooner this rabble of a club is sold or relegated the better for all long suffering fans.’\n‘Why do people still not understand we have no money to buy a new rb?’\n‘Honestly, Ashley Young at 50 would get in my starting 11 over him.’\n‘Did trippier do something personal to you for you to have such a perplexing view, does he owe you money?’\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
