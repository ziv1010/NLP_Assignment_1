  "body_text": "As a three-time Champions League winner, Mariona Caldentey’s experience will prove invaluable as we face Lyon in tomorrow’s semi-final at Emirates Stadium.\n“We are here because we deserve to be here,” said Mariona in the pre-match press conference. “We have to believe that.”\n“Now we face Lyon and they’re a top, top team, and we have to respect that but we have to have no fear. We want to go for it. It's two games, and the first one is at home with our fans, so we are there for that. We are so excited to play. We have our football as well and we want to show to the world.“\nWhen asked if Mariona had shared her previous Champions League experience with the squad, she spoke of a focus on the here and now.\n“We do speak a lot about life and about football, because we spend a lot of time together, but I think the team has the mentality to win as well. That’s the most important and I think that’s a bit contagious as well.\n“Champions League is a big one. It's three games for that, but we have to start tomorrow. I think everyone is hungry for a title, so this mentality, we need to keep it. We need to improve every day, and we are there because we deserve it. There are four of the best teams in Europe, and we are one of them, so we want to go for more.”\n“What I’ve learnt is that talent is not enough. You need to work hard, you need to be fit and be ready for a match, for the physical momentum as well. It’s not that easy and does take time. It needs teamwork and that is what we’re building here now. I can feel it, I can see how much we’ve improved already with that month, so sometimes we are impatient, and we want to see everything already, but sometimes football takes some time.\n“I think we need to believe in what we are doing and the Arsenal way, how we want to play. We are there, we are on the way, and we just need to keep going.”\nIn her first season at the club, the Spanish international has quickly made north London her home - on and off the pitch.\n“I'm so happy to be here. I feel like home from the first day. Everyone has helped me a lot. I thought I would maybe need some time to adapt because it's a big change for me. But to be honest, everyone in the club, on the team, has made that process so easy for me.\n“I can play my football. I can enjoy it. I think that's the best thing. That's when you can perform and when you feel yourself and comfy. I'm in the right place. I am where I want to be. I just hope we keep working how we are doing and I'm sure the titles and the good moments will arrive for the club because I think that's what we deserve.“\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
