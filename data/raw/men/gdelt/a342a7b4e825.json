It’s more that you feel deflated after and you feel disappointed. You feel like you’ve let the fans down and there’s just a real disappointment, to be honest,” said Morsy.\n“It’s definitely not the result we wanted today. I think on the game, we got a lot of things right, we had a lot of shots, the keeper’s made some great saves, we’ve hit the woodwork a couple of times and there were lots of good things to like about us today.\n“Unfortunately, on the breaks we didn’t manage it quite good enough. I don’t remember them breaking too many times but it seemed like they scored two goals from it. That’s something we have to get better with.\n“If you have 38 shots, the woodwork hit a couple of times and if you can only score one goal from it, then you probably put the game in the balance, and that’s what we did. We should have scored more today.\n“I think we had five or six really clear-cut chances which we should have done better with. But, fair play to the keeper, he’s made some brilliant saves. It’s bitterly disappointing, it’s a great day for them but it hurts, we have to bounce back and be better.”\nWhile he admitted the fans might not like to hear it, Morsy admitted that there were positives to take from the defeat and was proud of his side’s application throughout the contest.\n“It’s a disaster of a day but you can never question the desire and the application of the players, which for me is the biggest positive. I’d rather lose how we lost today than lose not fancying the game,” he said.\n“We haven’t had many bad moments here and the losses teach you so much more than the wins will ever teach you. So, we have to bounce back, we have to be better individually and collectively.\n“We have to look at why we couldn’t score and maybe you look back and just go ‘it was a freak game’ because we had enough chances to score six or seven goals.\n“The day belongs to them, it’s an incredible achievement for them. I’ve been on the other side where you’ve knocked out Premier League teams and it’s an amazing feeling. They’ll always remember it so fair play to them.”\nTown will have to put the shock result behind them ahead of their return to Sky Bet Championship action when they travel to Preston North End next Saturday (3pm).\nMorsy said: “We understand the importance of every league game. We’ll prepare for it again, on Monday everyone will come in fresh and raring to go and raring to get better.\n“Like I said, every setback is an opportunity to get better and that’s what we’ve always done.”\nPhoto: TWTD\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nHmm.\nthis season and has done us proud-\nCan’t believe what some posters uploaded at\ntimes -\nCOYB\nCongratulations to Maidstone-\n38 chances created against a team in the sixth tier as a top championship team you just have to score more than one goal. Nothing to do about it now apart from own it and try to make sure it doesn’t happen again !\nSeemed the players were trying too hard to score the perfect goal today too much intricate passing instead of getting half a yard and having a shot.\n18 massive matches left and good results are needed straight away to get confidence back\nBloody embarrassment\nLeeds have to make the long midweek treak to Plymouth for a replay, hope Southampton draw with Watford tomorrow.\nShocking today but surely we are in dreamland overall this season.\nWell done Maidstone,\nbut Ipswich some of those performances today were completely unacceptable for a full time professional football club\nWe hit the woodwork 3 times. We missed 2 sitters (Aluko and Edmondson) had numerous other chances. We had a good shout for pen turned down. Their 2nd goal should have been pulled back for a foul. Another day an identical performance yields a 5-2 victory and all the bed wetters who don’t understand football come on here and praise the team for a job well done.\nWe had knocks this time last season and we know what happened. So congrats to Maidstone and on we go. COYB\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
