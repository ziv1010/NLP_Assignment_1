  "body_text": "Eddie Howe is not under pressure despite what some ‘experts’ say\nAs Newcastle United collapsed and folded like a high-rise building brought down by a sky-blue demolition crew in Manchester, it raised a difficult question about where it leaves the rest of their campaign.\nWhere are Newcastle heading, because they are clearly struggling? Things are in danger of unravelling and it could happen very quickly.\nHowever, before you make the mistake of believing that Eddie Howe is in trouble, consider the fact that the travelling fans sang his name loudly and proudly when his team were 3-0 down at the Etihad Stadium. It sent a powerful message of support and unity in adversity, but in truth, it was not one the board needed to hear. They retain unwavering support in Howe too.\nThat does not, however, change the fact that Newcastle are in a hole; their form is poor and they are trapped in a spiral of injuries and a relentless run of tough games.\nTheir run of upcoming fixtures is particularly daunting. After losing their League Cup semi-final to Manchester City 5-1 on aggregate – a tie that was effectively over after the 2-0 home defeat last month – Newcastle enter a period of games that could see things get even worse.\nAfter Saturday’s tricky home game against Brentford, they travel to Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday and then head to Aston Villa in the fourth round of the FA Cup.\nWith a two-legged Champions League play-off tie against Qarabag to navigate later this month, there is another trip to the Etihad followed by home games against Everton and Manchester United, all finished off by an away game at Chelsea.\nIt is worth considering how people are going to react because there may be more pain and discomfort ahead.\nHowe’s job among most secure in the league\nIt is going to test relationships and patience but one thing is abundantly clear. While there are a growing number of fans on social media and armchair experts with no affiliation for the club calling for Howe to go – the argument being that he has taken the team as far as he can – that is not going to happen.\nThis season would have to turn into a complete and utter disaster for that to even be a topic of conversation at boardroom level. Newcastle’s hierarchy and the vast majority of supporters are of the view that you do not turn on the most successful manager in the club’s modern history at the first sign of trouble.\nHowe is arguably one of the most secure managers in the Premier League. He retains the faith and backing of sporting director Ross Wilson and chief executive David Hopkinson. This has been strongly and repeatedly communicated both internally and externally.\nThere is an understanding this season was going to be difficult. The departure of star striker Alexander Isak on the final day of the summer window compounded the problems of tackling four competitions – including the Champions League – with a squad that lacks the depth and experience to cope. Injuries have cut deep, yet for all the outside noise and suggestions of a crisis, Newcastle’s hierarchy take a more considered view.\nNewcastle may be 11th in the Premier League table, but they are also only three points off seventh and the prospect of more European football next season. The schedule will eventually ease and Howe will get some much-needed time on the training ground with his players.\nDespite the City defeat, Newcastle were playing in their third League Cup semi-final in four years, the trophy they won last season, a feat that would have seemed unthinkable when Howe took charge with a mission to save the club from relegation in November 2021.\nThey are also still in the FA Cup and have an excellent chance to reach the last 16 of the Champions League by beating a Qarabag side they should be too strong for over two legs.\nWhile some may be frothing at the mouth, calling for heads to roll, Newcastle are determined not to be that sort of club. They want stability and unity.\nThey will ignore outside noise and in doing so they will make light of the pressure supposedly building on Howe.\nThings may get worse before they get better, but Newcastle and Howe – who has not uttered a word of complaint over the failure to strengthen the squad in January as he appreciated the need to focus on the medium to long term in recruitment – remain as tightly bonded as ever.",
