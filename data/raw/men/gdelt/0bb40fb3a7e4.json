I can understand with the new generation but there is something that will never change at a big club, you have got to compete. If you don’t compete, someone is going to come.”\nHe continued, “If you take Phil Foden, he is a very good player but Manchester City keep buying players. You are at a big club and that is how it is, and if you are not happy at the big club, then you have got to go.”",
