And knockout matches are managed on this basis.’\nSpeaking ahead of the first leg of Roma’s Europa League knockout-round playoff versus Feyenoord, De Rossi revealed that he had been ‘studying’ his predecessor’s work but had his own ‘vision’.\n‘I studied Mourinho’s Roma very carefully, even before when I was simply a fan,’ the newly appointed Roma head coach told reporters.\n‘He achieved great results in Europe and went all the way for two years running.\nMore Trending\n‘Having said that, every coach has his vision, his preferences and a different approach.\n‘I will make a few changes, but I will never do a complete squad rotation of 11 players against Frosinone.\n‘It doesn’t look good, it doesn’t help keep players in shape and makes it difficult for those who have never played together.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Jose Mourinho names Newcastle as his Premier League bogey team but loved facing Arsenal\nMORE: Jose Mourinho lifts lid on Man Utd’s ‘deep, deep problems’ during his tenure\nMORE: Jose Mourinho reveals England job offer and predicts Euro 2024 glory",
