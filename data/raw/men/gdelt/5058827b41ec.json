For a small school to just keep producing year on year shows the great set up we have across the school in PE and sports clubs and how engaged the children are to keep fulfilling their potential and show their abilities.\n\"To be so successful across so many sports too really shows the variety of talents that the children have, winning competitions in football, netball, cricket, dodgeball, athletics, basketball, hockey and gymnastics.\n\"This will definitely be a year that will be remembered for a long time, with some incredible achievements along the way, some of the biggest highlights were winning five county finals and our girls cricket team winning the regional finals.\n\"Combining all of this along with the Year 6s doing so well in their SATs, they will leave with an incredible legacy.\"\nTwo years ago, the school won 17 competitions in a single year - with this year's tally eclipsing that result.",
