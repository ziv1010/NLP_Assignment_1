We've got a lot of quality throughout; they're competing for places, and that's how you want it.\n\"I'm pleased with what we've got, and excited to see what they can do.\n\"We want to be the best we can be, we want to entertain, and we want to win football games.\n\"But you don't go into anything if you don't have the mentality and the ambition to win it. That's our goal, simple as that.\n\"We're putting the work in, we're going to go through the processes, and the outcome will take care of itself.\n\"The boys have been waiting for this moment to come.\n\"They've been putting in the work, we're prepared, now it's time for action.\"\nWilkshire admits to knowing little about South Hobart FC but expects a tough outing against Tasmania's most successful football club.\n\"It's even hard to get good video footage of their games and things like that, but obviously they've been the best team in Tasmania for decades,\" he said.\n\"They've got a lot of history down there, and rightly so, they are in the Championship for a reason.\n\"We treat them like any other opponent, with the utmost respect, and we are prepared to go there and put in a performance needed to get the job done.\"\nPlaying only six group games, the Championship teams had little time to find their feet.\n\"Games come thick and fast,\" Wilkshire said.\n\"[The Championship] has come upon us really quickly, and you don't have time or room for slip-ups. It's a Champions League-type competition, so every game is crucial.\n\"We are looking forward to kicking it off, getting a positive result in Hobart, and then getting back home to a full stadium here [Collegians Sports Centre on October 18].\"",
