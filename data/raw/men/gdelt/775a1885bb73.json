  "body_text": "Jadon Sancho produced an entirely forgettable first-half performance at Anfield which would have felt like something resembling Groundhog Day for any Manchester United fan tuning in to watch Chelsea fall to a 2-1 defeat against Liverpool.\nThe 24-year-old switched Old Trafford for Stamford Bridge in the final hours of the summer transfer window, with United agreeing to send the troubled winger on a season-long loan to Chelsea.\nIt brought an end to a frustrating three-year spell for Sancho following his £73 million move from Borussia Dortmund in 2021. In this time, the winger provided just 12 goals and 6 assists in 83 appearances for United – a far cry from the attacking returns in Germany which made him one of the most highly-coveted players in world football.\nA public feud between Sancho and Erik ten Hag, centred around the Dutchman’s reasoning for dropping the 24-year-old for a trip to play Arsenal last September, saw the winger expelled from the United first-team squad.\nAn uncomfortable compromise was eventually reached in January with Sancho returning to Dortmund on a six-month loan. It offered him a chance to rebuild his reputation in the environment which previously saw him thrive, while United deliberated over his long-term future; and it proved a relative success.\nSancho was welcomed with open arms at the Signal Iduna Park and his performances helped Dortmund reach an unlikely Champions League final against Real Madrid, though they would fall short against Los Blancos at Wembley. Yet Dortmund were unwilling to entertain the price Old Trafford officials had set to make the move permanent – believed to be in the region of £40 million.\nInstead, Sancho returned to Manchester with the club facilitating ‘peace talks’ between him and Ten Hag, and the 24-year-old was reintegrated into the first-team.\nThis was never a genuine reconciliation, however. Rather, it felt like a tactical move by United to maintain the winger’s dwindling value on the transfer market as they actively sought to agree a permanent exit. But, with the transfer window drawing to a close, a suitable offer never arrived.\nThis led to hastily-agreed loan move, with a permanent sale clause included, to Chelsea in the final hours of August 30.\nSancho joined the Blues on a twelve-month loan with a obligation to buy for between £20-25 million, depending on Chelsea’s final league standing. If the London club finished lower than 14th in the Premier League, the clause would be void; if they finished 14th or higher, the transfer would be mandatory next summer, and the price would be dictated by their position.\nGiven a club the size of Chelsea would be sent into a state of existential crisis should they end the season in 15th place, this arrangement essentially amounted to a permanent deal.\nAnd there were signs in Sancho’s opening displays for his new team that Chelsea may have struck a good deal. But, as United fans have grown all too accustomed to seeing, the positivity the 24-year-old demonstrated has quickly waned, with his ‘performance’ at Anfield pouring cold water on this idea.\nSancho lined up on the left-wing for Enzo Maresca’s side against Liverpool. In forty-five minutes he was utterly anonymous, producing 0 goals, 0 assists, 0 shots, 0 key passes, 0 tackles, 0 interceptions, 0 dribbles and 0 successful duels, while losing the ball 7 times (Sofa Score).\nJadon Sancho's first half vs Liverpool:\n– 0/3 successful dribbles\n– 0/3 ground duels won\n– 0 tackles wonCOLD! 🥶🔥 pic.twitter.com/zixmNP5pkj\n— UF (@UtdFaithfuls) October 20, 2024\nAt half-time, Maresca felt he had no other choice than to hook Sancho, replacing the winger with Pedro Neto, who was far more impressive on the left-wing than his teammate in the second half.\n“Tactical”, the Italian manager responded when asked about the decision to substitute Sancho.\nWhile Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold is a brilliant attacking force, he is a defender who opposition wingers should always feel confident of finding some joy against, given how often he vacates the defence to drive forward.\nSancho was completely incapable of doing so however, offering a timely reminder of the ineffective performances which plagued his time at Old Trafford. Neto, by comparison, was a livewire who offered far more of a threat with his direct and aggressive style.\nWhile there is certainly the possibility Sancho regains the form which made him so imperious at Dortmund, it feels increasingly unlikely he will do so in English football. The speed and intensity of the Premier League does not lend itself to a player who only thrives with time and space.\nSancho is not the first Bundesliga product who is unable to translate his talents outside of Germany, nor will he be the last. It will just be interesting to see how the 24-year-old responds to the latest manager to choose to omit him in order to improve the team’s performances.\nHistory tells us it does not have a happy ending.\nFeature image Richard Heathcote via Getty Images",
