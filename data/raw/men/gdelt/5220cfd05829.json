  "body_text": "The big absence for PSG vs Bayern Munich\nParis Saint-Germain head over to Bavaria on Wednesday evening looking to overturn a 1-0 deficit from their first leg meeting with Bayern Munich.\nThe two Champions League giants met in the first game of their last 16 tie and Kingsley Coman's strike against his former club saw Bayern leave Paris with an advantage to take into the return fixture.\nPSG have often struggled to create a calm and positive atmosphere ahead of crunch UCL games and are once again staring down a premature exit from the competition despite being an established football superpower with the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar.\nThey will, however, be without one of their key stars in attack.\nIs Neymar fit?\nNeymar often dominates the headlines at Parc des Princes. He started the season in fine fettle but in recent weeks murmurings of his unhappiness at PSG have resurfaced again.\nThe only conjecture we'll hear regarding Neymar now will be over his future as he's been ruled out for the rest of the season with an injury to his right ankle.\nOn his absence against Bayern, Christophe Galtier said: \"I see there has been a debate around this. It's a loss, clearly. Is the team more balanced? Yes. Is it better like this? I will say that having him is better to score goals.\n\"Beyond the result I want us to be more aggressive than in the first leg. If we're getting into this game with this mindset we can qualify tomorrow night.\"\nREAD NEXT\nIt's going to be around three to four months before the Brazil international can return to training. It's also a recurring problem for Neymar, who missed two of the Selecao's World Cup group games after getting injured against Serbia.\nHe previously missed the 2019 Copa America as the likes of Gabriel Jesus, Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino led Brazil to victory.\nPSG suspension news vs Bayern Munich\nParis Saint-Germain have no players who will miss out on Wednesday through suspension. Marco Verratti has already served a one-game suspension for yellow card accummulation, as has Neymar who won't feature due to injury.\nBayern, on the other hand, will have to make do without France international defender Benjamin Pavard, who was sent off late in the first leg and suspended for one game.\nPSG injury news vs Bayern Munich\nAs well as Neymar's absence, manager Galtier is without regular defender Presnel Kimpembe. That could result in PSG lining up with a back three and Mbappe partnering Messi up front.\nMidfielder Danilo Pereira will likely join Sergio Ramos and Marquinhos in defence with Vitinha and Verratti screening in front.\nWing back Achraf Hakimi was included in the travelling squad after being formally charged with rape. Hakimi has denied the charges.",
