  "body_text": "Napoli are aiming to reach an agreement with Manchester United to sign Rasmus Hojlund today with a key detail emerging from the proposed loan deal, according to reports from Italy.\nConfidence in Naples\nItalian football expert Gianluca Di Marzio reveals Napoli have “confidence” that Hojlund will complete his switch to the Diego Armanda Maradona stadium today.\n“Napoli are trying to close the deal with Manchester United and Hojlund: the hope is to close it today. Napoli continue to work on Rasmus Hojlund , who could arrive to replace the injured Lukaku.\n“Contacts between the Azzurri, Manchester United and the player are continuing today to finalise the agreements and try to close the deal today. The Italian champions hope to conclude the deal today, and there is confidence in this.”\nUnited are open to Hojlund’s departure following the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig earlier this month.\nHojlund has been excluded from the matchday squads for both of this season’s opening fixtures by Ruben Amorim, who has made it clear where the Denmark international now sits in the pecking order.\nUnited would prefer a permanent transfer but there is acceptance that Hojlund’s dismal form over the past twelve months means a loan deal is the only viable option for an exit.\nDi Marzio reveals Napoli’s offer will be likely be finalised as “a loan with an obligation to buy subject to certain conditions, and the figure is around €45 million.”\nThe Obligation to Buy\nThis description of “certain conditions” will prove key to whether this loan is a good deal from United’s perspective or not.\nIf the obligation clause is triggered and the Red Devils bank €45m (£39m) for Hojlund next summer, when the Dane’s remaining book value will be around £29m, it will constitute a great piece of business.\nItalian newspapers have offered further insights into the exact nature of the deal between Napoli and United, as relayed by Football Italia.\nLa Gazzetta dello Sport reveals Champions League qualification at the end of the season for Napoli will trigger the buy clause – and given Antonio Conte’s side won Serie A last year, this feels a very likely scenario.\nCorriere dello Sport reports Napoli have already agreed a “five-year contract plus [an] option to extend” with Hojlund, signalling their intention to translate the loan into a permanent transfer.\nThis feels a deal that is on the verge of completion – and one which will benefit both United and Hojlund in equal measure. Good business all round.\nFeatured image Michael Steele via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
