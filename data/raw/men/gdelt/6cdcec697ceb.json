A lot of work had to be done to restore the sound.”\nRoy’s film, inspired by Vittorio De Sica’s “Bicycle Thieves,” tells the story of a poor farmer forced to move to the city as a rickshaw-puller to save his land from a rapacious landlord. The connection between Italian neo-realism and Indian social cinema wasn’t lost on Dungarpur.\n“‘Bicycle Thieves’ had a deep impact not just on Bimal Roy but also other Indian filmmakers like Raj Kapoor,” he notes. “The Italian neo-realist movement grew out of the ravages of the Second World War, while Indian social realism emerged after Partition in a newly independent India that was grappling with its own issues of migration, displacement, urbanization, poverty and corruption.”\nThe film marked a radical departure from Indian cinema’s studio-bound traditions. “Till ‘Do Bigha Zamin,’ the films of the time were usually shot in studios, melodrama and mannered acting was the order of the day,” Dungarpur observes. “With ‘Do Bigha Zamin’ he showed his contemporaries that films could be shot out of the studio and in the streets.”\n“Do Bigha Zamin” fits into Film Heritage Foundation’s broader mission to preserve endangered Indian cinema across multiple languages and regions. Recent restorations include the Odia film “Maya Miriga” (1984), Aribam Syam Sharma’s Manipuri film “Ishanou” (1990) and Shyam Benegal’s “Manthan” (1976).\n“‘Do Bigha Zamin’ is a landmark film of Indian cinema and I was always very keen that films of Bimal Roy should be restored,” Dungarpur says. “Each one of his films whether it’s ‘Madhumati,’ ‘Bandini’ or ‘Devdas’ are milestone films in Indian cinema.”\nThe collaboration with Criterion and Janus ensures the film reaches international audiences with proper context and presentation. “I am glad that Criterion Collection/Janus Films agreed to come on board to restore and distribute the Bimal Roy films,” he says. “In this way we have ensured that Bimal Roy’s legacy will survive for posterity.”\nHe praises the partners’ approach: “Criterion Collection/Janus Films play a crucial role not just in restoring films, but they celebrate the works by the quality of their restoration, their special features and outstanding packaging, inviting the interest of new audiences and making them accessible to future generations.”\nThe film will be presented at Venice by Roy’s family, including daughters Rinki Roy Bhattacharya and Aparajita Roy Sinha, son Joy Bimal Roy and Dungarpur.\nLooking ahead, Film Heritage Foundation has a full slate of upcoming restorations, including John Abraham’s Malayalam film “Amma Ariyan” (1986), Pradip Krishen and Arundhati Roy’s “In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones” (1989), Pattabhirama Reddy’s Kannada film “Samskara” (1970), and Kamal Amrohi’s “Pakeezah” (1972).\nThe restored “Do Bigha Zamin,” which won the Prix International at Cannes in 1954, serves as both historical artifact and contemporary mirror. At its core, Dungarpur suggests, lies a universal truth: “At the heart of both the neo-realist films and the social realism in Indian cinema is a humane and compassionate view of humanity and its frailties.”\nFounded in 2014, Film Heritage Foundation is a Mumbai-based non-profit dedicated to film preservation and restoration, with a growing collection of 700 films and 200,000 pieces of film-related memorabilia.",
