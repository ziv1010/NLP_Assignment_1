Signed Manchester United memorabilia, meanwhile, continues to surge in popularity ahead of the new season.\nSesko, 22, figures highly on Man Utd’s shortlist. The Slovenian international notched 21 goals across all competitions last season and is widely considered one of the most exciting young forwards in Europe.\nNewcastle, meanwhile, had identified Sesko as a potential replacement for Alexander Isak and were willing to make a big push to sign him. However, the situation has now changed, with Liverpool reportedly pulling OUT of negotiations to sign Isak in a dramatic twist.\nAccording to a report from United in Focus, there is ‘internal confidence’ at Man Utd that they will sign Sesko this summer, after positive negotiations with the player’s camp.\nJournalist Graeme Bailey told the outlet: “During their talks Sesko confirmed that a lack of Champions League football this season was not a problem to him as the long-term project and the chance to work with Ruben Amorim were the major draws.\n“I can also reveal that United made it clear to Sesko’s people that they are aware of the size of deal that would be required to land him and that they would not have entered into talks without that consideration.\n“United are confident, there is no denying that but they are waiting – they also know that Newcastle have put forward a very strong case.”\nREAD MORE 🔴⚫ Every completed Man Utd transfer in summer 2025: Signings, exits, loans\nNewcastle move for Sesko in doubt? Man Utd have alternative in mind\nLeipzig are understood to be holding out for €70-80million (£60-£69m / $81-92m), plus €5-10million (£4.3-8.6m / $5.7-11.5m) in add-ons for Sesko.\nThe striker’s preference is reportedly to join Man Utd, even without European football, but that hasn’t stopped Newcastle making moves for him.\nTEAMtalk transfer correspondent Fraser Fletcher revealed on July 30 that Newcastle are willing to pay Sesko lucrative wages and match Leipzig’s price demands.\nHowever, if the latest reports are to be believed that Isak could now stay at Newcastle, whether the Magpies will still move for Sesko remains to be seen.\nAs for Man Utd, they must be mindful of PSR and player sales may be required before they can match Leipzig’s valuation.\nTEAMtalk also understands that the Red Devils are considering a move for Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani as a potential alternative to Sesko.\nPSG will consider offers around the £50million (€57.8m, $66.2m) mark for Kolo Muani, making him a cheaper option than Sesko.\nDON’T MISS 👉 Ranking all Premier League clubs by transfer net spend in 2025: Man Utd move above Liverpool…\nLatest Man Utd news\n🔴⚫ Jadon Sancho makes career-defining decision as Man Utd transfer falls into place\n🔴⚫ Man Utd plot stunning late hijack of ‘agreed’ deal as star stalls medical\n🔴⚫ What Chelsea really think of Garnacho as two conditions for Man Utd transfer set",
