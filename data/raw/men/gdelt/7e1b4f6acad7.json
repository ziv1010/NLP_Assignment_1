Feel free to discuss the topics presented here, or start your very own discussions! The Open thread will be posted every day by one of the mods you’d totally do an action movie night with: Valyrian Steel, Felipejack, Kung_Fu_Zizou (AKA KFZ), Juninho and, of course... yours truly.\nOpen Thread: August 5, 2023\nYour Saturday Edition of the Daily Merengue\nYeah, it’s another slow news day...\nLooks Fine\nWhat Do YOU Think?\nI will never forget that season. Without a doubt, the best team to not win the UCL for me. That semi final still hurts. Seeing Jose on his knees is one of the most crushing moments I’ve watched in sports. Still, I think it’s best to keep the best moments o the surface. THAT counter-attack vs Ajax.... THAT Calma celebration... and THAT ultimate show provided by the club in that season... Simply indescribable... simply majestic.\n;e\nRemember the Greats\nThough, admittedly, it’s way too early to forget about this one.\nTony... what a guy... You know what, though? 1 CDR and Tony’s going into his 9th season as a RMA player. Goes to show we aren’t doing too good in said competition.",
