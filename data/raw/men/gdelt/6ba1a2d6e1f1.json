  "body_text": "What have we learned from the Euros?\nWith the Euros having come to a predictably disappointing finale, I thought I’d have a look at what learning points there are for Everton. Here’s a top 10 in no particular order.\n1. Tournaments are not the place to judge transfer targets\nBased on performances at the tournament alone, you’d take Mikautadze of Georgia ahead of lumbering Harry Kane any day. Stars like Mbappe and Musiala haven’t really shone. We shouldn’t be put off the likes of Broja just because he was a bit anonymous against Italy (did okay against Spain though). Nor should we be buying Mikautadze either, by the way.\nThe only exception would be things like the U20 World Cup - and more routine U21 (and younger) international games. There are pretty much no hidden gems these days. They are all hiding in plain sight for the France U-19 side etc etc.\n2. Older players can still cut it\nModric, Giroud, Pepe, Navas, Ronaldo – and to some extent 34-year-old pace-merchant Kyle Walker have all shown remarkable longevity. There’s hope for old man Ashley Young yet if he drinks plenty of green tea and squeezes in an afternoon nap. It doesn’t hurt to have veterans in the squad especially if they are a good influence on the squad.\nThat said, Portugal would probably have fared much better with Jota or Ramos up front instead of the world’s most self-orientated footballer (Ronaldo). So they need to be used appropriately.\n3. Everton can afford talented players\nThe best players all have to start somewhere. Here’s a short (and by no means comprehensive) list of cracking players at the Euros who, at the time of sale, were within our reach and would not have been far-fetched signings:\n· Rafael Leao: £17m Sporting to Lille (2018)\n· Eze: £15m QPR to Palace (2020)\n· Zirkzee: £7m Bayern Munich to Bologna (2022)\n· Jota: £12m Atletico Madrid to Wolves (2018)\n· Kvaratskhelia: £11m Dinamo Batumi to Napoli (2022)\n· Cucurella: £2m Barcelona to Eibar (2019) and £11m Barcelona to Getafe (2020)\n· Hjulmand: £2m Admira Wacker to Lecce (2021)\n· Hojlund: £1.5m Copenhagen to Sturm Graz (2022)\n· Frimpong: £300k Man City to Celtic (2019)\n· Muani: Free transfer Nantes to Eintracht Frankfurt (2022)\nHard though it is to find such players, you definitely won’t find them if you don’t shop in the right markets. The right markets are generally (a) rich club reserves / academies; (b) The Championship; (c) cheaper leagues around Europe and beyond. Also, don't spend more than about £20m on a player... (there will almost always be a cheaper one just as good).\n4. 4-4-2 (or 4-4-1-1) still works\nThis is true (see Slovenia’s decent showing) but it primarily works for a particular purpose – closing down passing lanes against a superior outfit. However, it is poor for other purposes and chances tend to be forced rather than created in open play – with set-pieces providing other opportunities.\nPretty much none of the world’s best attacking players of the past 25 years would fit into a conventional 4-4-2 and none of the world's best teams have played that way in the same period. Not a coincidence. However, with us currently having the 16th best (or 5th worst) squad in the Premier League, we generally will be playing superior opposition each week – hence it’s not a bad Plan A.\n5. Nothing wrong with a bit of direct play\nPlaying out from the back is great if you have the technique and structures to find passing lanes against the opposition. However, it’s very high risk if you’re not good at it. Direct or long play is haphazard but lower risk and forces the opposition to defend. Few teams are genuinely good at defending unless in a compact low block so, you will force chances – again, as per a couple of breakaways by Sesko for Slovenia against an exposed Pepe. I actually thought we looked quite dangerous against Spain when we forced the game to be more chaotic.\nSimilarly, fairly straightforward crosses into the box cause problems and make the opposition defend – especially if you get players up in support. Fullkrug, a very traditional centre-forward, looked very dangerous this tournament as he did in the Champions League Final. But you have to support a player like that.\n6. English Football has become more tactical\nAt the highest level, football is about passing lanes. When in possession, you need to create passing lanes to break the opposition’s defensive structure. This is done through a combination of relentless movement, technique and creative genius. Without the ball, you need to block the passing lanes available to the opposition.\nHowever, I’m not sure this transition to increasingly tactical football is particularly well received. In fact, I think Dyche is often labelled clueless because he does take such a tactical approach (which can make it look like we’re very passive in games when actually we're working hard to close down space). I think many fans (not just of Everton) would rather watch a more aggressive or chaotic \"up and at 'em\" type of approach. We might just reserve that for an annual ding-dong against Newcastle Utd.\n7. Football generally has become more athletic\nI am probably a bit rose-tinted about this – but go back to Euro 96 for example and there were many excellent technicians of much more limited athleticism such as Gascoigne, Bergkamp, Stoichkov, Djorkaeff, Zidane, Hagi, Del Piero, Zola, Prosinecki, Sukur, Laudrup, Figo and Rui Costa.\nAlthough there are some brilliant players in this tournament, the emphasis seems to be on relentless movement rather than true genius. Spain have been exceptional at this and Portugal were good too. I don’t think I can single out a particular player – except possibly Yamal – who has approached games like some of those old throwbacks. Most others have been part of an efficient and athletic team – eg, Witz, Musiala, Foden. Really effective players have included sprinters like Rafael Leao and some of the French forwards.\nAlthough we are now a very fit side, our movement on the ball is not great (we work much harder without the ball) and we are just so slow (some parallels to the England side there – although shame on Southgate for dragging such a high quality group down in this way). Hopefully we add more pace on the flanks and in the final third (England too!).\n8. Boring central defensive midfielders are all the rage\nFor those of you still wondering what the fuss is about Onana, take a look at the unspectacular (but effective) performances of players like Danilo, Palhinha and Tchouameni. Even brilliant Rodri in the final had a quiet half before being withdrawn through (I think) injury.\nMany of these players are really centre-backs positioned in front of the defence to accommodate the fact that full-back in higher quality sides is now a midfield position (and the back-pass rule has eradicated the traditional sweeper). However, this only really works if the central defensive midfielder is surrounded by quality attacking talent. Hence it’s probably no big deal that we’ve sold Onana since a lesser player may even give us more.\n9. Calvert-Lewin does a cracking job\nWatching Harry Kane (an exceptional striker in exceptional form) toil fruitlessly up front in a slow side with poor wing play, shows what a difficult job Calvert-Lewin does for us. Unlike the ineffective Kane, Dom creates a lot of space for the attacking midfielder – hence the good showing from limited Doucoure. Kane and Bellingham had no such chemistry despite being far better footballers. Dom also defends so much more effectively from the front. I do hope both England and Everton improve their wing play from here (especially Everton's abysmal right flank).\n10. Set pieces make a massive difference\nIn previous recent tournaments, the presence of Maguire has made England a threat at every set-piece. In this tournament, we seem to have almost no aerial threat at set-pieces (which Branthwaite could have provided). Which is a shame given the quality of our set-piece takers. Even from a defensive point of view, whilst Guehi and Konsa have been good (possibly better than the often uncertain looking Stones) they would both benefit (as Stones does) alongside a defender who is really dominant in the air.\nFortunately, Dyche does not need educating on the benefits of good set pieces.\nReader Comments (44)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission. Comments are the responsibility of the poster. Disclaimer ()\n1 Posted 15/07/2024 at 22:43:40\nI think point 7 is particularly valid. Jordan Pickford got stick today from Carragher because, according to the lamentable pundit, he was acting on his own by playing it long. None of his teammates or even Southgate felt emboldened enough to tell him to cut it out.\nHe did indeed play it long and it was, in my view, because of his teammates' inability to or fear of making themselves available for passes.\nThat's Everton last season and why Calvert-Lewin was vital to us. I think Dyche will start next season much the same, gather some confidence-boosting points and then vary the tactics.\nFive defeats in a row forces average players into hiding. It won't happen next season.\nI enjoy the work you put into spotting bargain targets. I hope that Dyche has people around him who are as astute as you and Sam Hoare!! Top stuff, Robert!\n2 Posted 15/07/2024 at 23:37:55\nReally made me think.\n3 Posted 15/07/2024 at 23:50:39\nGeorgia for me were the most enjoyable side to watch.\n4 Posted 16/07/2024 at 05:11:14\nPerhaps the Asian Cup might be a happier hunting ground especially Korean or Japanese players. Didn't we have some sort of arrangement a few years back with Chang to take a couple of Thai youngsters as well as a couple of Chinese players albeit we kept getting the wrong Won or Wu.\nAs for the style of play, I still think the old way of playing the space, constant movement, or getting those with the skill into one-on-one positions works. Unfortunately our/Everton's midfield rarely seem to be on the same wavelength and seem mostly grouped on the left with a sole player wide right.\nI'm not too sure though that the high points, tournaments, are the right place to look if the majority of your game is long ball with emphasis on strong defence.\n5 Posted 16/07/2024 at 05:42:52\nThe only point that I might want to sit down with you with a well chilled dry white to go back and forth on is the very first one. I feel that tournaments are a natural shop window. Mind you, you do say 'judge' not spot. Still, I would be up in arms if Thelwell right now is not combing squads like Merle's Georgia.\nSurely each piece of buying and selling involves some degree of risk?\nI know it's Opta Index, but I was intrigued to see that the only England fella in the Tournament XI was Guehi. Hmmmm.\nRobert, I was somewhat surprised to see that a post as good as this by a poster as good as you signally failed to address the most important 'what have we learned from the Euros' thing.\nThis is, needless to say, the absolute gormless twatdom of the linguist-less Lorraine Chase smart Republicans in the Fox USA erm tournament team: Ian Darke, various Studio gumps, sewage pundits who reduced footy observation and awareness to the fecking Flowerpot Men. Landon border-wall builder Donovan is the worst of the slime bunch. He is so vacuous yet more full of himself than his fellow extreme right-wing traveller Oswald Mosley.\nNot one of these people should be allowed anywhere near a microphone ever again. They must be ordered to surrender their passports after forced removal to American Samoa, where TVs are banned by the government, for the duration of every tournament from this day on.\n6 Posted 16/07/2024 at 06:18:21\nI have said, had it not been for Jordan, the score against Spain could have been 4- or 5-1, so I don't know where Spit the Dog is coming from.\nThe Euros:\nSpain were deserving winners. That young winger looked electric. Was he wearing jet boots?\nFrance, who I thought were favourites, just didn't really get going.\nGermany, who I thought might use home ground to rally them, fell short. Not the force they were, especially from their 2014 team. But they will rebuild.\nI was quite impressed with Austria, and Switzerland weren't too bad either. Close call between England and the Netherlands.\nEngland managed to squeeze through and were unspectacular, but it's tournament football. Often, they looked like a collection of talented individuals rather than a cohesive team.\nI enjoyed watching it. It passed time and gave me football until the season starts and we have Everton back. I usually cut an impatient figure during the summer!!\nBy the way Andy, let us all know when your'e getting over to Goodison next. Always a pleasure.\n7 Posted 16/07/2024 at 08:15:14\nAnother player who we got linked with quite a bit and is not on your list is Embolo, a player with skill awareness and pace who knows how to play up top.\nIf I was Dyche, I'd go for quantity over quality to push Everton a few places up the league before we go to the new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock for those similar reasons why you say that tournaments aren't the best places to judge a footballer, Robert!\nThe game has become more athletic and our manager has mostly used a very small core. This definitely showed at times and this is my reason for wanting quantity rather than expensive quality right now.\n8 Posted 16/07/2024 at 08:23:27\nIt's a recurring thing, Haaland too. Strange we have had the up-and-coming talent in our sights but failed to take the chance.\n9 Posted 16/07/2024 at 08:25:05\nAndy and Danny, Carragher is simply talking his usual one-eyed cack.\nJordan was obviously told to play long balls to beat Spain's very effective high press.\n10 Posted 16/07/2024 at 08:55:55\nI've changed my mind, I've read some of your other stuff and I don't believe there is much in this article that you didn't know before this tournament kicked off.\nIt appears (to me) that you have used this article to express your own opinion on tactics, players and VFM, I honestly don't believe you saw anything you haven't seen before.\nI really enjoyed the tournament, but I saw nothing new in terms of formations or tactics, just more teams from so-called lesser football nations being able to put them into practice.\nI was interested in your thoughts about recruitment; with today's scouting networks, I think the days of finding \"hidden gems\" have long since passed. A kid only has to show he can control a football these days and he has a profile. The gems are not so hidden now.\nThe problem we face now is persuading the player to come to us. Barely a week goes by in the transfer window without reading about a youngster preferring to sign for what we consider lesser clubs. We are forced to gamble. Often jumping the gun and buying duds - Too numerous to name.\nTo be fair, given how far we've fallen down the mountain, I don't think we do too badly. The signings of Branthwaite and Calvert-Lewin are up there with any of the above suggestions. You're right though: we do need more.\nMoving into the new stadium will help make us more attractive, but the only way to stay that way is to climb back up that mountain.\nFor the record, the thing I learned from this competition is that national team managers are no longer simply wary of upsetting an entire nation by leaving out superstars — even when they are knackered, unfit, and hopelessly out of form.\nThey're now so terrified, they won't even consider it.\n11 Posted 16/07/2024 at 09:03:28\nI agree re Korean and especially Japanese players. Sounds like a very broad statement but, in particular, Japanese players generally tend to be really good technically (their youth development system is one of the best in the world) and also pretty tough.\nIt's an area that we should be scouting if we are looking for quality bargains.\n12 Posted 16/07/2024 at 09:17:00\n\"Romelu Lukaku left for Manchester United that summer and Everton gave me a feeling there was a good chance to come through there. When I was there they offered me a contract straightaway.”\nYet Zirkzee waited until he got an offer from Bayern…\n13 Posted 16/07/2024 at 09:26:59\nThe main problem in attracting talent has perhaps been our ability to compete in terms of transfer fees and salaries. Thelwell has had to build transfer deals \"on the drip\" with no upfront payments, we are outbid by promoted teams and clubs are willing to stretch their salary bands when we are reducing ours.\nBeing the DoF and recruitment team at Everton must be an permanent exercise in humility at the moment. Fortunately, they are trying to be ingenious with it.\n14 Posted 16/07/2024 at 09:46:24\nFor me, it highlights how the modern game has become all about systems and tactics, and less about individuality, flair, skill, creativity and flawed human beings. It's all about 'fit' and how the players need to fit the system being employed. Football has become dull, lifeless, and sanitised as a result.\nEvery team now tries to employ the Pep Guardiola model of keeping the ball at all costs — which is fine if you're Pep Guardiola and Man City or Real Madrid because you have all the best players to pick from.\nFor the rest of us, we find ourselves employing the same system with players who aren't really up to it. Hence why Man City keep the ball and play progressive football, and we keep the ball but fanny around at the back, playing in our own half until the opposition presses us, and Pickford hoofs it up field. This goes for Everton and England.\nPersonally, I find modern football boring by comparison to say 10, 15, 20 years ago, and yes the players are fitter, and technically 'better' (whatever that means) but is the game more exciting, or more fun to watch? No, I don't believe it is. All the joy is being sucked out of it.\nVAR also plays a major part in the way the game has become sanitised — add that into the mix as above and the game is unrecognisable from the one we all love to watch. So where do we go from here?\nWell, I don't see how the game can evolve from here — once VAR and technology gets involved and everyone gets bogged down by systems and things like xG (apparently xG measures the quality of a chance by calculating the likelihood it will be scored from a particular position on the pitch during a particular phase of play.\nSo you can see my point when you talk about sanitisation and removing the joy from the game) then the game is handed over to the technical elements, and removing the human element — the very thing that makes football so popular in my view.\nFootball is a simple game made complicated, and that's what's killing it.\n15 Posted 16/07/2024 at 09:46:30\nThe best team won; as long as Southgate is in charge — forget about the coming home.\nPickford is mad!\n16 Posted 16/07/2024 at 11:01:45\nFitness, stamina and athleticism have supplanted skill — meaning if you put 11 men behind the ball, even the best teams struggle to find almost non-existent space.\nWe can't alter the pitch size so the only answer is to reduce numbers — make the games 10 a side and allow only one substitute.\n17 Posted 16/07/2024 at 11:13:43\nI wouldn't ever want to see Southgate linked with the managerial position at Everton!\n18 Posted 16/07/2024 at 14:25:46\nChange the offside rule so that, instead of being offside when the ball is played, this becomes void if the player is onside when he receives the ball.\nInstead of the defensive team having so much control, such a rule change would instantly give an attacking team a lot more control and should definitely make for a much more adventurous game.\nI say 'should' but football is littered with teams who don't take many chances, hence the reason why the Golden Goal, was eventually scrapped.\n19 Posted 16/07/2024 at 15:17:20\nThat's quite brilliant — although my preference would be players can't be offside beyond 12 yards from goal. That would stretch the playing space.\n20 Posted 16/07/2024 at 15:48:48\nMy take on football is that it has become what I call 5-a-side football requiring constant passing and movement. This is so different from how the game used to be with the average goal coming from 3 touches or less.\nThis changes the demands on a player to being fast, fit and a good thinker rather than technical or dribbling abilities. In fact, that is the one thing I really miss about modern football: that there is very little dribbling in evidence.\nHaving said all that, I really enjoyed the Euros and saw some good play and plenty of tight games that could have gone either way, even the final.\nMy only hope now is that we get some decent players in and start to enjoy more expansive, confident and brave football.\n21 Posted 16/07/2024 at 15:49:40\nMaybe it would be better if everyone had to have a pint before each half of football (including extra time and penalties).\nJudging its impact on my darts, someone like Calvert-Lewin might improve his finishing this way.\nInteresting to see Ivan Toney do a no-look penalty 5 pints in...\n22 Posted 16/07/2024 at 16:05:45\n\"Older players can still cut it\".\n\"Hard though it is to find such players, you definitely won't find them if you don't shop in the right markets. The right markets are generally (a) rich club reserves / academies; (b) The Championship; (c) cheaper leagues around Europe and beyond. Also, don't spend more than about £20m on a player... (there will almost always be a cheaper one just as good)\".\nThe Lukuku up and coming talent, or a Gareth Barry on a nominal fee is the right approach. Potential and good quality pros to nurture. We have instead not gone after up and coming talent for a long period of time, or have over paid for middle/older players.\n23 Posted 16/07/2024 at 17:03:19\nAshley Young is leading the \"clamour\" for Sean Dyche to be considered.\n24 Posted 16/07/2024 at 17:06:52\nI own AJ Hudson's, where were you sitting?\n25 Posted 16/07/2024 at 17:08:06\nI loved the game I grew up watching, but down the years, we have had to endure a steady steam of well meaning idiots who have contrived to fix just about everything that wasnt broken.\nPeople claiming the game is no longer as entertaining as it was, are only offering their opinion. Surely It's in the eye of the beholder. The game has never been so globally popular. Tickets\nto watch top class football have never been in greater demand. TV companies are still filling their boots years after the prophets of doom predicted the bubble would burst.\nNot all the changes have been for the worse. The hatchet men have been erased. The Vinnie Jones's and the Chopper Harris's (depending on how far back you go) wouldnt last five minutes today. The pitches are better today too. The days are gone when we would watch 90 minute slogs on underwater pitches and consider it entertainment.\nWe all remember the brilliance of Pele. Best, Maradona, Cruyff.. (again depending how far back you want to go), but lets not let time rewrite every line. Hooligans, Hatchet men, footballs heavy enough to stove you brains in. Rivers of piss running down the terraces and pitches better suited to a round of golf are part and parcel of that bygone era. We cant just simply choose to forget.\nOlder fans will continue to knock today's game. They remember when game was beautiful and \"entertaining\". The young ones would look at old footage of that \"entertainment\" and simply piss themselves laughing.\n26 Posted 16/07/2024 at 17:20:53\nOddly the Malmo coach in Sweden is doing a version of this too apparently.\nThe \"product\" is probably tense and dramatic now but the game would benefit from a few more artists. And maybe just a few clashing styles too. Like I say, nothing wrong with a bit of very direct play too if that's your strength\n27 Posted 16/07/2024 at 17:32:06\nI could be a smartass and say the meaning of gozzy is what I learned but instead I will play it straight for points 4 and 5. We may be in a lucky position wherein we must play the defensive structure and just need to figure out how to time or get numbers for the occasional attacks and goal zone possession. How we get there doesn't matter, just how we get numbers in the final third and when to unwind it to cover a transition.\nGana regaining confidence and Garner's positional awareness make us capable of timing our pushes forward to compensate for lack of overall speed. While Garner sometimes loses his man on runs into the box, I believe this was a mixup more than ineptitude. Gana has the sixth sense about knowing when to challenge or when to drop into coverage. Once they know each other better, some consistent and coherent coverage should give us a way of turning on the momentum from the midfield.\n28 Posted 16/07/2024 at 18:09:17\nLists of players who went cheap 3-5 years ago that we supposedly could have had if we'd \"shopped in the right market\" are sort of a false flag in my opinion, because they leave out the long lists of hundreds of players sold for similar prices at similar times who didn't become Euro stars. On a percentage basis, how often does something like that happen? What are the odds? How many of the players purchased in those years are now on a fourth-division roster or waiting tables instead of scoring against Switzerland? Such lists never say.\nIt's also a real reach to speculate that Branthwaite could have provided an aerial threat on set pieces, since he has scored exactly one goal that way. And he would have had to be on the pitch instead of the excellent Stones or Guehi.\nNonetheless, good stuff.\n29 Posted 16/07/2024 at 18:52:52\n30 Posted 16/07/2024 at 19:18:39\nMost of fans think they know the answer to football. As if it's a simple question. Just sat in my car waiting for my lad to KO at 8 in a pre season game. Listening to one fella telling another where and how England went wrong. 'Should have took Grealish', 'Too many touches from defenders', 'not enough ambition' etc etc. All pretty decent points but no one really knows if it would work.\nI was convinced that England needed to go for it after equalising (there's an excellent minute by minute breakdown in the Guardian today of how England surrendered the initiative in the last 15 mins) but again this is just an opinion. If they had who is to say that Spain wouldn't have broken and scored anyway?\nFootball is so tactical now, that move and counter move take place so quickly. Additionally, players are human and make mistakes (even positional miscalculation of a yard or so can be fatal). Fans believe they know the answers. We don't really. Most people on here are well informed and have a solid understanding of the game, but coaching and, vitally, impacting the game whilst it is happening is so difficult.\n31 Posted 16/07/2024 at 19:49:50\n1. From the time of 'Maradona's hand of God', including Tierry Henry's 'sorry it hit my hand keeping the ball in' to Spain and other teams tripping up players to stop breakaways in this tournament, cheating is not only condoned it is rarely punished properly at International or home level.\n2. Yes older players can still perform but not as long as they did in their twenties. They should be used as 'super subs\". We criticised Rondon saying the only time he ran was when he came onto the pitch. Would Portugal have fared much better if Ronaldo had come on the pitch at minute 75 and not started the game? Same with Kane? perhaps starting with Gordon instead?\n3. Just as oil and water does not mix neither do players from 'keep possession' teams and attacking teams that is why we played better as a team after a few games. I thought I was watching Man City or Arsenal for the first 4 games.\n4. Accuracy, Accuracy, Accuracy should be the first three key aspects to choosing any player for your club or Country. Yamal scored a goal from nothing. Conversely France squandered several golden and scorable chances in their semi final.\n5. If a team is best or second best in the Premiership at NOT conceding goals then it has to have very good defenders and a good goalkeeper (Pickford). I have no doubt Branthwaite would have played better than Guehi he proved it all season.\n6. Feeling of failure. This feeling permeates football right up to managers and even Presidents of countries. No one said well done to the Scottish Manager for making it to the Euros instead the press and football commentators emphaised that Scotland did not make it to the second round. I am certain this why the first round of the euros was so boring. No one wanted to be out of the competition in the first round.\nSouthgate did ok but not brilliant considering the talent available.\nThe next manager of England and any other team should realise that the players are also very fickle and hardly any player so close to a tournament will say they played badly, missed too many chances, hurried their crosses or failed to make a tackle or did not run enough.\nAnybody who earns millions is open to criticism such as football managers, footballers, singers, actors, club owners, so why say 'it is unfair to criticise me'.\n32 Posted 16/07/2024 at 19:57:42\nI do agree with your point 5 that a more direct type of play is in order for the less skillful teams and would be more productive than all this pissy passy stuff your supposed to play now.\nJames @14 in his very good post is much of the same opinion as myself as is Barry @15.\nToo much football now is sleep inducing, sure you do still get some entertaining games but who wants to waste their time watching defenders passing the ball back and forth endless times.\n33 Posted 16/07/2024 at 20:12:54\nEven with so many other sports and entertainment at our finger tips today. The clamor to watch top class football has never been greater.\nThe numbers in which people will travel to foreign lands to see their national team play is simply jaw dropping.\n34 Posted 16/07/2024 at 20:46:36\nSo I think there is a case for making the pitches and goals slightly bigger. This would lead to a few more goals (not a ridiculous increase), reduce the number of scoreless draws, and generally reward those teams willing to attack and have shots on goal, and discourage teams from “parking the bus”.\n35 Posted 16/07/2024 at 20:54:28\n1) It's a global game making millions for the media companies who now control it.\n2) Has-been pundits are given too much time and money to express opinions that a 9-year-old could give.\n3) A perfectly honest and honourable manager can be abused and derided by drunken louts masquerading as fans because they believe that they could all make better decisions than him.\n4) The team containing the most talented and gifted players will usually win.\n5) Most games will be boring non-events between teams who have little chance of getting to the next round. Great for promoting the game!\n6) Post mortems by experts in the media will last for weeks.\n7) Managers, coaches etc will lose their jobs or resign, as decided in the court of Public Opinion.\n8) Positive is that some people will get a month away from the mundane drudgery of everyday working for a living.\n9) Contribution to the greater good of mankind, or English football — nil.\n10) Re-enforcement that all other countries in the UK will always support the opposition.\nAll-in-all, the most positive result was disrupting the crap TV schedules and demonstrating just how much professional footballers are overpaid.\nWell, the question at the top of this article did ask me!!!\n36 Posted 16/07/2024 at 21:47:34\nWaterlog the pitches before kick-off and let battle commence!\n37 Posted 16/07/2024 at 22:34:58\nLooking at the pundits, Carragher and Neville discussing the next England manager, Carsley not their choice; considering the Spanish manager who just won the Euros, was promoted from their U21s, it works.\nNeville, who I like on overlap, lasted less than 4 months at Valencia, and then to say Kane was England's best player ever! He wasn't even Spurs' best player.\nThen another useless pundit, Merson, saying there was no one to touch them in the Euros, and France wouldn't have more than 2 players to make England team… ever wonder why everyone hates them!\n38 Posted 16/07/2024 at 22:40:47\nThe amount of fluffed one on one chances and mishits in front of goal was horrendous.\nNot sure who we're going to replace him with when he goes - was there a clinical finisher anywhere in the tournament?\n39 Posted 17/07/2024 at 01:40:29\nSo did Foden, who also rarely misses in league play, and the half-fit Lewandowski.\n40 Posted 17/07/2024 at 07:28:27\nWhat I would add is the substitutions, an issue that seems to be in all the premiership managers, English or overseas. If a player is not doing it on the day we can't wait to see if he wakes up and contributes.\nA couple of examples would be Kane who has been a great servant for England but this time it was a competition too far.\nBellingham, whilst a fantastic player failed to show what he has been doing for Real Madrid all season, tiredness? I don't know, but the new manager needs to be able to pull an ego if it is not happening and try something different.\nFor too long, we have been doing like-for-like subs, this only helps the opposition who do not have to change their style just remember it's another big Number 9.\nStill, what do we know?\n41 Posted 17/07/2024 at 07:48:59\nSecondly Zirkzee... yes, he scored a few at Bologna last year, but the guy is a perennial loanee and had 3 minutes of game time at the Euros. He has shown potential in the past, but never realised it. I would be surprised to see him do well at Man Utd.\nOne player I was really impressed with at the Euros was Mykola Shaparenko of the Ukraine, who reminded me a bit of Lampard as a player; I would love to see him in blue.\nOverall though I was disappointed by the football. I have nothing against seeing some decent shots from outside the box and spectacular goals, but in many cases it seemed desperate for want of alternatives. Were the players just tired all round?\nMy player of the tournament though was Dani Olmo... always looking to do something different, something unique and surprising... and a very clever player. Not sure why City are linked with him as he is very similar to De Bryune.\nAnyway, glad to have a few weeks now without footie to recharge.\n42 Posted 20/07/2024 at 11:36:56\nOne time it would be an absolute treat to watch a great France team with Zidane, Platini etc etc.\nAn Italy team filled with household names and rugged hairy arsed defenders (now all Brazilian waxed).\nGreat Germany teams with stellar names like Klinsmann, Beckenbauer.\nThey all seem to be trainied to just pass the ball in slow motion now. It's not even good football really is it? It's mundane and at times like watching golf more than football.\nEngland were as boring as fuck but, even with Southgate gone, they'll still play the same chessboard football, won't they? Because that's how everyone is coached now.\nCan't use two feet, must only use one foot and must work the ball into the box with a thousand passes…\n43 Posted 29/07/2024 at 10:37:00\nâ— Speed of thought — The moment Spain lost the ball in the first half, they were running at twice the speed and twice the intensity of England to retrieve it.\nâ— High pressing\nâ— Flying wingers — Not just Yamal, but Wiliams too.\nâ— High individual skill. The ability to be cool on the ball while being challenged by two England players.\nâ— Telepathy — So well coached that they knew instinctively where their teammates were.\n44 Posted 11/11/2025 at 21:26:54\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
