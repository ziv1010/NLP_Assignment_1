The extensive programme incorporates workshops, photo walks, talks and films as well as the display of images by finalists selected for the show, such as Gavin Libotte (pictured). It is staged at RESET, a newly-opened collective space overlooking the sloping park entrance to Saint Michel and Saint Gudula Cathedral. Until 1 June, Rue de Ligne 8\nOver 30 artists at WIELS – as well as a selection at Argos – reimagine life in a world marked by ecological crisis and planetary change. The exhibition Magical Realism: Imagining Natural Dis/order immerses viewers in a biosphere suffering from climatic change, offering new ideas and perspectives on the relationship with our planet. To convey its important message, the show also takes the form of a publication and a public programme of activities, including a selection of films from Argos’ archive that resonate with the exhibition's themes.
