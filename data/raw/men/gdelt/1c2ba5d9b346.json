  "body_text": "LOS ANGELES — What comes with $10 million and a trip to the FIFA Club World Cup on the line?\nHigh drama.\nNeeding extra time to reconcile the outcome of a play-in qualifier that determined the 32nd and final team in the upcoming $1 billion Stateside competition, the Los Angeles Football Club battled Mexican giants Club América to the end, prevailing 2-1 on a strike from Denis Bouanga in the 115th minute.\nTied after regulation when a go-ahead penalty by América forward and former LAFC player Brian Rodriguez was offset with a headed corner in the 89th minute from Black & Gold midfielder Igor Jesus, the big-stakes match will go down as one of, if not the most famous, days in the club’s young history.\n“It means to us as a group first and foremost, the players and coaches, a tremendous amount of togetherness,” LAFC head coach Steve Cherundolo said. “And then as a club, I think it puts you above and beyond many, many other clubs in MLS. I think it puts you at a different level and is also a help for the entire league, of putting the league on the map at the Club World Cup with one more team. And I think it’s an important night for everybody involved in our sport in this country, and more specifically, this league.”\nBouanga’s stunning game-winner was well-worked, a seamless movement that culminated in a deserved goal for LAFC’s best player, who never downshifted during 120 minutes plus stoppage time.\nIn front of a sold-out crowd of 20,714, which was dominated in the stands by América fans save for LAFC’s “3252” supporters in the North End, all night Bouanga was the key man for LAFC, bursting down the field, driving into the opponent’s box, earning corners and being the same menace that MLS defenders know well coming off his back-to-back 20 goal seasons.\n“[Bouanga’s] competitiveness is a little underrated,” Cherundolo said of his star winger. “He’s a true competitor that doesn’t stop and is absolutely livid with me when I take him off the field. He hates it when training is over. He wants to keep going.”\nThe intuitive give-and-go, a product of all that effort on the practice field, began near the América box where Bouanga dished the ball to midfielder Frankie Amaya, who touched it to forward Olivier Giroud, allowing the iconic French striker to tee the ball up for his countryman.\nBouanga’s shot wrong-footed América goalkeeper Luis Malagón when it deflected off the inside of defender Miguel Vazquez’s left leg, sending the LAFC bench into a frenzy, including Cherundolo who sprinted down the sideline to celebrate with his team.\nBouanga’s immense effort, combined with strong performances from his teammates, puts LAFC in Group D of the Club World Cup alongside Brazilian standout Flamengo, Espérance Sportive de Tunis and English power Chelsea FC. LAFC will open the competition on June 16 against Chelsea in Atlanta before facing Tunis in Nashville (June 20), and finishing with Flamengo in Orlando (June 24).\nBy denying América, LAFC is the third MLS team in the tournament, joining the Seattle Sounders and Inter Miami CF.\nA significant moment materialized out of nothing three weeks ago when Club León, which had defeated LAFC in the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League final and was supposedly eligible for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, was officially deemed ineligible because it shares ownership ties with another Mexican team in the field, Pachuca.\nFor the six players left on the roster from 2023 – Bouanga, Aaron Long, Sergi Palencia, Ryan Hollingshead, Eddie Segura and Nathan Ordaz – that turn of events offered them and LAFC a chance at redemption.\n“It’s something that we thought was gone forever,” Long said. “A Champions League title and a berth into the Club World Cup was absolutely one of our biggest goals going into that year and every year. So to get a chance at a one-off game playing at home, it was an opportunity we had to seize. As a group we knew how important it was and it’s amazing to come out on top in this game and give ourselves and this club the opportunity.”\nThe contest ended furiously but did not begin that way, as América attempted to contain Bouanga and his fellow attackers throughout the first half. One shot on goal for each side in the opening 45 minutes didn’t reflect the intensity and work rate on the field. By the time the yellow and black smoke wafted away from the supporters’ sections and cleared the stadium nearly a quarter hour into the match, the contest settled in for the long haul.\nAmérica struggled to reach LAFC’s box, taking one touch within the 18 before the break.\nLAFC still showed initiative around the opposing goal, taking four corner kicks compared to none for América, along with decent looks for Nathan Ordaz and Ryan Hollingshead.\nAt the half, América head coach André Jardin made two key changes, including Rodriguez, a familiar face to LAFC supporters after he was signed in 2019 as a young Designated Player, and midfielder Jonathan dos Santos. As América spread the game out and began creating chances, Cherundolo stuck with his starting XI until Rodriguez converted his penalty in the 64th minute, which sent Bouanga into overdrive.\nIn addition to the latest game-winning goal in LAFC history, Bouanga created the corner kick that Jesus scored on, his first for the club, with one minute remaining in regulation.\n“Of course you come alive a bit when you’re down and there’s a lot on the line,” said Cherundolo, who described the evening as the most personally gratifying experience he’s had with LAFC since taking over for Bob Bradley in 2022. “Our response was incredible physically, tactically and mentally.”",
