He obviously has even more at home. I also heard the interview and I was very pleased to hear it, not as Benfica’s president but as a Benfica fan.”\n“I’ve been out there as a player and I know that it often doesn’t just depend on the player, but on the club he represents.\n“It’s not something for tomorrow. The day he decides to return to Benfica, whoever is president will have to make that decision. As it’s not until 2025, I can’t make any decisions about that.\n“We’re all to blame when something doesn’t go well. If we’re talking about Bernardo, we’re talking about one of the best players in the world.\n“We’re all very sorry he’s not at Benfica, but he’s deservedly among the elite of world football today.\n“He’s never hidden his passion for Benfica and I like that a lot. I and all Benfica fans hope that he can wear our shirt again.”\n-\nFeatures3 days ago\nTactical trap of Erling Haaland and Omar Marmoush doing more harm than good for Pep Guardiola\n-\nNews2 days ago\n“You don’t need to be blind” – Pep Guardiola dissects Manchester City’s second-half misery of late\n-\nMatch Coverage2 days ago\nMatch Report & Player Ratings: Manchester City 3-0 Fulham (Premier League)\n-\nFeatures3 days ago\nBernardo Silva is showing doubters age is just a number after stellar Anfield performance",
