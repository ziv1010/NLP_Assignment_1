In November, he stunned then-leaders Napoli with an early brace in a statement victory that eventually saw Atalanta usurp the defending champions.\nHis first goal showcased his predatory instincts, as he capitalised on Matias Olivera’s poor clearance to connect with Charles De Ketelaere’s flick-on, volleying home from an acute angle at the back post.\nThe second was even more spectacular – receiving De Ketelaere’s cross-field pass, Lookman cut inside Giovanni Di Lorenzo before unleashing an unstoppable right-foot curler that left goalkeeper Alex Meret clutching at thin air.\nIn September, he orchestrated a remarkable comeback against Fiorentina, contributing to all three goals in a thrilling 3-2 triumph.\nFirst, he displayed exceptional skill to skip past Edoardo Bove on the left wing before delivering a precise cross for Mateo Retegui’s equalising header.\nThen, with his team trailing 2-1 and time running out, Lookman took matters into his own hands. Just 60 seconds after De Ketelaere had levelled the scores; the Nigerian seized possession on the left, cut inside with purpose, and threaded a precise finish through a maze of defenders into the bottom corner to complete an extraordinary turnaround.\nHowever, his finest hour came in May’s Europa League final, where he produced one of the greatest individual performances in the competition’s history.\nHis hat-trick against Bayer Leverkusen began with a master class in movement, as he ghosted unmarked into the box to meet a flowing move involving Teun Koopmeiners and Davide Zappacosta with an emphatic first-time finish.\nHis second goal showcased his technical brilliance, receiving the ball outside the box; he embarrassed former Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka with a sublime nutmeg before unleashing an unstoppable long-range strike.\nHe completed his historic treble with a display of raw power and precision, racing onto Gianluca Scamacca’s pass before hammering an angled drive into the net from the left side of the area.\nThat performance, which dramatically ended Leverkusen’s 51-match unbeaten run, earned him widespread acclaim, including from Real Madrid’s Jude Bellingham, who confessed after their Super Cup clash, “Ademola Lookman, who I’m a big fan of, is really good at one-on-ones. We had to prepare specifically for him.”\nThe Nigeria international will be eager to prove himself against Los Blancos after August’s UEFA Super Cup disappointment, where despite his threat; Atalanta fell to a 2-0 defeat against the Spanish giants.\n“These are the games you dream about as a child,” Lookman said before that clash.\n“We don’t need great motivation. We will face the greatest team in the world, and it’s an appointment with history.”\nThe stakes are particularly high for this encounter. Atalanta, currently fifth in their Champions League group with 11 points, have been formidable on their travels but are yet to score at home in the competition, drawing 0-0 with both Arsenal and Celtic.\nMeanwhile, Madrid have endured a difficult European campaign, collecting just six points from five matches and suffering three defeats, including their last two against AC Milan and Liverpool.\nWith Carlo Ancelotti’s side desperate to avoid missing the knockout stages for the first time in 28 campaigns, and having won their last eight away matches against Italian opposition, the stage is set for another memorable European night in Bergamo.\nSince joining Atalanta for €9.35m from RB Leipzig in 2022, Lookman has been a revelation, amassing 42 goals and 23 assists in 95 appearances. His performances have attracted interest from Paris Saint-Germain, with Atalanta reportedly willing to negotiate a €40m fee for their prized asset.\nLike Roosevelt’s speech of a warrior who “strives valiantly” and “knows great enthusiasm,” Lookman has consistently shown he belongs in the arena with football’s elite. Tuesday presents another opportunity to prove it against the kings of European football.\nThe question now is: Will he rise to the occasion once more and add Real Madrid to his list of big-game conquests?",
