Their 2-0 victory over Wolves on Wednesday night closed the gap to fourth-placed Tottenham to six points. The Reds have a game in hand and Spurs must also travel to Anfield on April 30.\nHowever, snatching Champions League qualification will simply paper over the cracks and Jurgen Klopp is fully aware an overhaul is required.\nThe bulk of Liverpool’s business will centre around midfield additions. Jude Bellingham is their primary target, though the arrivals cannot stop at just one.\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Naby Keita and James Milner are all free agents at season’s end. The option to buy in Arthur Melo’s loan from Juventus won’t be activated.\nChelsea have surprisingly emerged as a club Liverpool are looking to plunder. Indeed, Mason Mount has an admirer in Klopp and the homegrown Chelsea star is no closer to signing an extension. His current deal expires in the summer of 2024.\nHowever, a second Blues target has been touted in the form of N’Golo Kante. His situation is even more pressing for Chelsea given his deal expires in June.\nLiverpool have explored Kante coup\nNow, speaking to GiveMeSport, journalist Pete O’Rourke confirmed landing the Chelsea great on a free is a move Liverpool have explored.\n“It’s a deal they’ve looked at, hoping that they can maybe persuade Kante to leave Chelsea on a free transfer,” said O’Rourke. “We all know about Liverpool’s need for midfield reinforcements.\n“It looks like it’s going to be a big rebuild job in that engine room for Jurgen Klopp’s side and Kante, with his experience and know-how, is a winner. Wherever he’s been, he’s had great success.\n“To get someone like that on a free transfer would be an astute piece of business.”\nKante has featured just twice in the league this season due to a hamstring issue. However, despite his ever-increasing injury absences, the French destroyer remains one of the most effective holding midfielders in world football when on the field.\nHis intensity, willingness to press and ability to cover up the weaknesses of those around him would make him an ideal midfield addition for Klopp.\nHowever, according to Fabrizio Romano, the German boss is due to be left empty-handed.\nNew Chelsea deal close; contract length hinted\nRomano recently reported Kante “loves” Chelsea and is on the cusp of signing a new deal at Stamford Bridge.\nRomano claimed the length of the contract was all that was holding up the extension. French outlet FootMercato believe they have the drop on how many years Chelsea are willing to offer.\nThey claim Kante will sign a three-year deal running until 2026 and it’s ‘probable’ there’ll be a club option for a fourth year.\nWith so much churn in player personnel of late, retaining a proven and experienced performer like Kante is essential for Chelsea.\nThe Sun add their take to the Kante saga, noting the 31-year-old ‘has rejected summer transfers away from Chelsea in favour of staying at the club’.\nWhile the Sun didn’t divulge which clubs had tabled proposals, they did namecheck Liverpool among the three clubs who were sizing up a move. The others were Atletico Madrid and Barcelona.\nTRANSFER GOSSIP: Liverpool make firm move to sign £70m Prem star who is ready to move; Man Utd target Bundesliga keeper; Chelsea near £17.7m deal for Ecuador talent",
