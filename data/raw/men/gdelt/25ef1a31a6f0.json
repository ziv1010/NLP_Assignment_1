We've looked at five options Everton could turn to to boost their firepower.\nThe lure of Champions League football has proven persuasive and the England international will join Chelsea's army of young talent next season. Everton's striker search continues, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin likely to leave as a free agent and Armando Broja's injury-hit loan concluding. Beto has become a cult figure over the run-in since David Moyes's arrival, but there's no doubt the Toffees need a talisman upfront.\nHere are five alternatives to the Ipswich Town striker:\nFive Liam Delap alternatives that Everton could target\nMatthis Abline (Nantes)\nAn interesting profile given Everton's interest in Liam Delap. The 22-year-old enjoyed a breakout campaign with Nantes in Ligue 1, scoring nine times in France's top division. Statistically, the France U-21 international has similarities with Delap and ranked in the top 15% of forwards across Europe's top five leagues for progressive carries, carries into the penalty area, total carrying distance, and successful take-ons in 2024-25.\nIn a Nantes side that were one of Ligue 1's lowest-scoring sides, Abline's return of nine goals came from an xG of 9.25. That slight underperformance in chance conversion (-0.25) was still far superior to both Beto (-1.44) and Dominic Calvert-Lewin (-5.27).\nEverton fans can watch Abline in action at this summer's U-21 European Championship.\nErmedin Demirovic (Stuttgart)\nErmedin Demirovic is weighing up his future at Stuttgart after becoming frustrated with his role. Demirovic failed to command automatic status at Stuttgart despite boasting an impressive goal record.\nThe Bosnia international scored 15 times in the Bundesliga from just 20 league starts, with only Patrik Schick and Omar Marmoush bettering his non-penalty goal per 90 ratio.\nHe averaged a goal every 123 minutes for the German side last season.\nLorenzo Lucca (Udinese)\nEverton have traditionally thrived from set-pieces and there are few better penalty box presences than Lorenzo Lucca.\nThe 6ft 7in forward scored 12 league goals for Udinese last season, leading the division for headed goals (5). A traditional target man, Lucca developed his game in Italy's lower tiers before netting 20 times over the last two Serie A campaigns.\nSeveral of Italy's top clubs are monitoring the striker's situation, with Udinese valuing Lucca at around €30m (£25.3m).\nRicharlison (Tottenham)\nCould Richarlison return this summer? Mutual appreciation remains between Everton and the forward, whose move to Tottenham has not quite worked out as hoped. The 28-year-old struggled with injuries last season and the arrival of Dominic Solanke has seen him fail to command a regular role when fit.\nHeading into a World Cup year, Richarlison will want regular minutes to secure his place with Brazil in 2026. For the right price, it is a deal that could be explored.\nNick Woltemade (Stuttgart)\nEverton have been linked of late with Nick Woltemade, who has enjoyed a coming-of-age campaign at Stuttgart. The 23-year-old is attracting notable transfer interest after scoring 17 goals in all competitions last season.\nWoltemade was the DFB-Pokal's leading scorer as Stuttgart won the German Cup and combines a 6ft 6in frame with delicate footwork and dribbling.\nWest Ham forward Niclas Fullkrug this week endorsed Woltemade's credentials, following the forward's first senior call-up to the Germany squad.\n“Nick is a good friend of mine,” Fullkrug told DFB.\n“We stayed in touch, even when we no longer played together. In Bremen, we had a lot of contact and often ate together. He is a down-to-earth and good boy, but he is also intelligent and clever. He has had the qualities he has shown for a long time.\n“But he needed the time and the trust to be able to show them. He has deservedly established himself at VfB Stuttgart. He brings a lot of qualities that can help us here. Nick, and also Deniz Undav, are good for number nines because they not only finish the game themselves, but also provide a lot of assists. Every striker can benefit from that.”\nReader Comments (33)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Only 22.\n3 Posted 03/06/2025 at 15:55:11\nHang on a minute! What if there is no wall? :-)\n4 Posted 03/06/2025 at 15:56:22\nOr are we all resigned to only ever playing one man up front?\nEditorial Team\n5 Posted 03/06/2025 at 16:04:41\nGetting him out of Villarreal would be the trickier part after Champions League qualification!\n6 Posted 03/06/2025 at 16:07:46\n7 Posted 03/06/2025 at 16:27:29\nAs I live in Spain and watch a fair few games, Barry was very raw and may not even make the grade in a competitive Premier League.\nVillarreal are owned by the local Ceramica Company and don't need to sell. Unless someone comes in with a silly bid.\n8 Posted 03/06/2025 at 17:06:02\nI think Moyes could improve him. I have seen him play several times, and have been impressed.\n9 Posted 03/06/2025 at 17:32:15\nI'd look at Ivanovic from Millwall. 12 goals in 37 games, 20, Serbian, 6ft-2in, first season in England. That's pretty promising for a young lad. Somebody will probably buy him, send him on loan, and then trouser a nice profit.\nPlayers out of contract next summer:– Mateta, Wissa, Embolo, Muniz, Mbeumo, Cherki, Bakayoko. If there's no option, some of these are going cheap this summer.\n10 Posted 03/06/2025 at 17:36:59\nI'd happily loan him back to do that job, but we'd still need a No 9.\n11 Posted 03/06/2025 at 17:39:00\nChermiti was reportedly impressing Dyche's coaching staff pre-season before he unfortunately got injured. Admittedly, we haven't seen enough of him to conclude if the long injury lay off has seen his skills wane.\nA run of games with more than 5 minutes of ‘grass' time will probably enable him to kick on, but not sure if Moyes will be patient with him.\n12 Posted 03/06/2025 at 17:42:54\nJosh Sargent is a decent player but no way do I see him cutting it at the top level. He didn't even make the latest USA national team squad. I'd love to be proven wrong, but I'd be sorely disappointed with that signing at any price.\n13 Posted 03/06/2025 at 17:43:17\nWe have three strikers at the club better than him already.\n14 Posted 03/06/2025 at 19:18:46\n15 Posted 03/06/2025 at 20:14:17\n16 Posted 03/06/2025 at 22:10:06\nDemirovic: very average and not cheap.\nLucca: very tall and not that good. Disaster in only other spell outside of Italy for Ajax.\nRicharlison: very injured.\nWoltemade: very strange player. Ridiculously tall dribbler. I think he'd be a terrible fit for us - like Scammaca was at West Ham - despite being a good player. Not dynamic enough for our purposes.\nSergeant: very Championship\nBarry: Beto but younger? Bit like Bonny at Parma? Possibly flattered by physical attributes but not sure whether he's that good.\nI don't think any would improve on Beto or DCL and most are worse. Abline or Barry might come good if they kick on markedly from where they are now. Could take a while.\nFor me the stand out candidate by a mile is Santiago Castro of Bologna.\n17 Posted 03/06/2025 at 23:19:27\n18 Posted 04/06/2025 at 02:45:08\n19 Posted 04/06/2025 at 03:46:44\nRe Castro, everybody seems to agree he has tremendous potential -- Italy's trying to lure him away from Argentina -- but you're not gonna ask an undersized 20-year-old with one top-level season (8 goals) to lead the line in the Prem. He could be a great young buy, but doesn't seem like a Delap alternative to me.\nAgreed on Sargent. Fierce competitor who has become a quality finisher, but absent great pace or explosiveness. He's fringe in the US picture for a reason.\n20 Posted 04/06/2025 at 05:48:37\nRetain Beto and buy for potential, for example Santiago Castro as Robert says. £30M plus but Italian clubs will usually sell if the price is right.\n21 Posted 04/06/2025 at 06:01:06\nI'd be looking at keeping Beto around the squad and then looking for a slightly different profile type.\nObviously we still don't know what's happening with DCL, but the fact that he still hasn't signed a new contract with days remaining tells me that he doesn't see his future here and frankly I still think we'd be mad now offering him a new one albeit it would be greatly reduced wages.\nI don't discount some of what Calvert-Lewin has done for us over the years but I can't ignore that he's the worst natural finisher I have seen leading the line in the last two decades either, coupled with the injury record.\nI still think we need two strikers in this summer.\nI love Richarlison but unless it was a loan deal I wouldn't be revisiting that one if it meant having to pay millions out.\n22 Posted 04/06/2025 at 06:40:03\nLooks similar to me to Igor Jesus and the other Brazillian lad Alberto, arguably less of a risk though? I think we will get a statement about Dom this week and will know one way or another.\n23 Posted 04/06/2025 at 06:45:17\nYes he was poor in the Premier League last time – but so were Norwich – and he was stuck out on left wing.\nI still think he could be a Moyes style signing.\n24 Posted 04/06/2025 at 07:39:42\nIgor Jesus seems more like a wing forward / second striker than a main striker. Yuri Alberto is more of a target man style striker but also a very good footballer. I think Castro is better than both of them – albeit he's 4 years younger too so could take longer to settle in.\n25 Posted 04/06/2025 at 07:40:07\nSantiago Castro looks a talent though I wonder if he's not a great fit for the PL? He has some great technical skills but is not the fastest or strongest (though not weak or slow by any stretch). Would he do better in a posession based team perhaps but I wonder if he's a good fit for a counter attacking team? Has Aguero/Lautaro vibes and could certainly be a great player but just wonder if he suits Moyes?\nSomeone like Barry (or Bonny) has those physical attributes but as Robert suggested may not be an improvement on Beto. Though could outstrip him in time.\nUltimately I suppose we are unlikely to be able to afford an improvement on Beto currently. So taking a punt on someone with potential is probably our best move. My bet would still be Evan Guessand who is fast and technical enough to play on the RW while he adapts to the league and managed 12 goals and 8 assists last season. 20 G+A at 23 years old in Ligue 1 is a good achievement and shows he should be ready to impact straight away in the PL. Brighton are looking at him apparently which is always a good sign.\nPrice will no doubt be an issue, which is why Delap at £30M was appealing. difficult to guage prices for strikers and depends on competing interest. Castro for example I've seen valuation ranging from £25M to £40M. The reality is we are not going to beat the likes of Spurs, Newcastle, Inter, Atletico etc to players and so may have to either think outside the box or wait for some more dominos to fall as lots of big teams want a new striker.\n26 Posted 04/06/2025 at 07:42:26\nIt's a shame we can't buy both!\n27 Posted 04/06/2025 at 08:44:47\n28 Posted 04/06/2025 at 09:25:53\nThere's a few interesting players who are a little down on their luck and could be available on favourable loan deals:\nEvan Ferguson\nAlexandr Mitrovic\nTammy Abraham\nYoussoufa Moukoko\nDatro Fofana\nBrian Brobbey\nEl Bilal Toure\nI remember being really keen on Bilal Toure who then immediately got a bad injury and is now finding his way back to some form. He's only 23 and is probably surplus to requirements at Atalanta. Maybe a loan with a £16/17m option?\nAlso like the idea of a punt of Promise David from Belgian. Raw but rapid and huge!\n29 Posted 04/06/2025 at 10:15:07\nWheres Straquilarsi?\n30 Posted 04/06/2025 at 17:47:27\nWhat about Karim Konate from Salzburg? Has just come back from an ACL injury but surely the kind of quick footed quality finisher we should be after?\nAlso, just seen links to him from AS Roma? Let them buy him and loan to us!\n31 Posted 04/06/2025 at 18:09:37\nLoan with obligation to buy might work for both clubs.\n32 Posted 04/06/2025 at 18:12:30\nIf the aim is to find a player to out-score Beto next season, then the chances are very low.\nWe're probably just naming players who are of the same similar standard to the likes of Onuachu of Saints and Daka of Leicester here.\n33 Posted 05/06/2025 at 07:45:51\nI'm always happy to take a punt on a player like that to see if he can rediscover his form and grow on potential but doubt he'd be ready to replace Beto and he'd probably be best served going somewhere he'd get more game time.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
