Missing out on the Champions League proved costly for the club, denying them a massive £85 million payday.\nWith the Red Devils’ finances under pressure, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have been exploring multiple strategies to steer the club back to profitability.\nUnited took part in a post-season tour of Asia which is believed to have earned the club around £8m.\nNow, according to the Daily Mail, Ruben Amorim’s side could make much more from a visit to Saudi during Riyadh Season, which kicks off on Friday through to March.\nHow much United stand to rake in from Saudi fixtures\nThe Daily Mail report that United stand to pocket north of £10 million if they reach an agreement to play in Saudi Arabia this season.\nThe newspaper notes, “The General Entertainment Authority (GEA), headed by Turki Alalshikh, released an initial schedule on Monday and there is a gap for a high-profile football event.”\n“One of the three options open to United would be to take part in the Riyadh Season Cup, a three-way tournament against the capital’s two biggest clubs, Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr and Darwin Nunez’s Al-Hilal, which featured Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami in February.”\n“United would be expected to earn around £5m per game plus more in prize money if they win, and additional revenue from commercial opportunities during an extended stay in Saudi.”\nAnother option being considered is a shorter trip, where United would play an exhibition match against a Saudi All-Star side. Such a move could bring in around £5m.\nAdditionally, the 20-time English champions could visit the Saudi royal family or the GEA and hold a warm-weather training camp before playing a one-off match, most likely against Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr. This deal is valued at £5m.\nIt’s understood that if these plans go ahead, Saudi will foot the bill for United’s travel, accommodation and training facilities.\nFeatured image Matt McNulty via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
