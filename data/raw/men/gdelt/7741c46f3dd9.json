  "body_text": "How do you replace the irreplaceable?\nThat’s the task facing Tottenham Hotspur as they try to cope in a post-Harry Kane world.\nIn reality, they’ve had to start planning for this for some time. For the last year in fact, Tottenham’s recruitment staff have been succession planning in case Kane left. They had no alternative, not when such a pivotal player was soon to be in the final year of his contract.\nAdvertisement\nAs Kane’s departure began to look increasingly realistic, the conversations at Spurs became less hypothetical and more about concrete plans.\nIt was agreed that the best solution was not to try to replace Kane with one big-name replacement, but to bring in multiple forwards to bolster Ange Postecoglou’s fluid front line. As Postecoglou pithily put it on Friday: “I don’t think there’s a like-for-like replacement for Harry, mate.”\nHe added that: “But in terms of a striker, again we’ve been planning for this, it’s fair to say, for a while. It doesn’t take too much investigative work to realise that this was going to happen, so we’ve been planning for it to happen anyway. A lot of our business up to now is with that in mind.”\nEven before Kane left, 19-year-old striker Alejo Veliz was signed from Rosario Central for £13million ($16.5m), though it’s unclear how quickly he’ll be a regular part of the first team. Attacking players James Maddison and Manor Solomon have also come in and in total Spurs have spent around £115million on fees for players this summer, plus an additional £64.6million on making the loan deals of Dejan Kulusevski and Pedro Porro permanent. The ‘Kane money’ has already been reinvested, according to some sources. Though that’s not to say there won’t be further incomings this window.\nOf the marquee strikers Spurs looked at, there were varying factors that made signing them prohibitive. The lack of Champions League, or any European football, meant someone like Victor Osimhen of Napoli was out of reach. And as Osimhen demonstrates, this summer there was also the Saudi factor to contend with. The Nigerian was courted by Al Hilal for huge money earlier in the window.\nBut the brutal reality is that Tottenham are not currently at the level where the best strikers in the game would want to join them. Realistically, if they want a striker at Kane’s level again in the near future, they’ll have to produce someone from within.\nAdvertisement\nEvan Ferguson was another potential Kane replacement Spurs looked at, but he recently signed a new contract that runs until 2028 and Brighton & Hove Albion have absolutely no intention of selling. Rasmus Hojlund was also discussed prior to him joining Manchester United.\nAnd Hojlund underlines what the market is currently like for strikers. With prolific No 9s at a premium, Hojlund, who only scored nine Serie A goals for Atalanta last season in his first year in a big European league, still fetched £72million this summer.\nAn intriguing option as more of a like-for-like replacement for Kane, certainly in terms of the goals he could contribute, is Ivan Toney. An additional part of the logic of not rushing to bring in a first-choice striker now is that it might open the door to a move for Toney in January. This has been discussed internally and is an option being considered for when he returns and is back up to full speed after his ban.\nA less expensive option in the meantime would be Gent’s Gift Orban, who has been the subject of a lot of scouting from the Spurs recruitment team, especially on the data side. His data has been very impressive, especially when it comes to what appears to be exceptionally good finishing. The decision Spurs will have to make is whether those finishing numbers are sustainable or whether it’s just a hot streak and/or how linked it is to the fact he has been playing in the Belgian top flight, which is a way off the level of the Premier League. The sense at Spurs is that he could be attainable for around £20m plus add-ons.\nNottingham Forest’s Brennan Johnson is another player Spurs like, though he would predominantly be bought to compete with Kulusevski for a spot on the right wing. Tottenham consider this a bit of a gap in their squad and so may well have pursued a deal even if Kane had stayed (on Friday Postecoglou claimed Kane leaving “doesn’t change things dramatically”), especially with Bryan Gil injured and it not being clear yet whether he’s at the required level. Nothing has been agreed regarding Johnson at this point and Spurs will likely try to include one of their many unwanted squad players as a makeweight in any deal.\nAdvertisement\nIn general, after looking at reports over the past year and contingency planning for Kane’s departure, the expectation is that goals will be spread around the team rather than concentrated so much on one player — as has often been the case with Kane, especially last season. In 2022-23, Kane’s 30 Premier League goals accounted for 43 per cent of Tottenham’s total, which was the highest proportion of any one player for one team.\nSpurs better hope other players are more able to contribute this season because the man expected to lead the line in Kane’s absence — certainly initially — is Richarlison, whose best-ever Premier League total is 13 (Kane’s worst-ever in his nine years after becoming a regular starter was 17). Richarlison managed one last season.\nThe hope is that his hard-running, pressing-from-the-front style will suit Postecoglou, with various experts familiar with the new manager’s work tipping the Brazilian to do well under him. Richarlison has looked sharp in pre-season, scoring a hat-trick against the admittedly low-level Lion City Sailors.\nSpeaking in his press conference on Friday, Postecoglou was full of praise for the Brazil international.\n“Richy is a fantastic player and I said before he’s got some really strong attributes that fit in well with the way my team is set up,” the Spurs manager said. “He’s a hard worker for the team and apart from doing the stuff he needs to in front of goal, there are other aspects of his game.\n“He’s represented his country at a World Cup, which is not an insignificant thing and sometimes when things like this happen, opportunity exists and it’s up to somebody to step through that door. That’s Richy or anyone else. That’s all you can ask for in football, just to have that opportunity.\n“I wouldn’t be expecting one player, and it’s not the way we’ll be set up, to cover the absence of Harry. It’s about the collective and how we can become a really strong offensive force with the players we have. We have some really fantastic attacking players and Richy is one of them.”\nAdvertisement\nRicharlison is hardly a nobody — he cost Tottenham £60million last summer, another sign of their reasonably long-term Kane succession planning and is Brazil’s starting No 9. He scored three goals for them playing in that role at the World Cup last year.\nHe is clearly not at Kane’s level, very few are, and internally Spurs are aware that not bringing in a big-name replacement will go down very badly with many supporters. But the people tasked with making these decisions believe that a more fluid attacking system is the way to go and it’s something that has served Postecoglou well before. Both Son Heung-min and Richarlison are experienced playing up front or on the left, while Kulusevski can operate in central areas as well as on the right. Solomon can play on either flank, and Maddison could move forward from midfield to operate as part of the front three.\nFor what it’s worth, when Kane wanted to leave two years ago, Nuno Espirito Santo’s plan was to move the team towards a counter-attacking style with three rapid forwards. Postecoglou’s vision is very different, but it’s becoming increasingly common for teams to play without what would be considered a conventional No 9. Some of the most successful Premier League teams of the past few years have played that way — Liverpool with Roberto Firmino and Manchester City briefly in between the Sergio Aguero and Erling Haaland eras. Of the Premier League’s nine top scorers last season, only five would be considered out-and-out strikers.\nNo one is suggesting Spurs will be better without Kane. It’s about making the best out of what is a very challenging situation, especially right on the eve of the new season.\nThankfully for Spurs, they have a manager in Postecoglou who rather than being daunted by the challenge will embrace it. Last month in Perth, he told a small group of reporters that in his previous jobs, he also had to deal with major rebuilding issues early on. At Celtic, the team’s star striker, Odsonne Edouard, was sold soon after his arrival, while at Yokohama F Marinos, he had to get rid of the legendary 40-year-old centre-back Yuji Nakazawa at the end of his first season because he was too slow to play in his high defensive line.\nGO DEEPER\nHow might Tottenham look without Harry Kane… Could Richarlison help fill the void?\n“Relaxed is probably not the right word, but I’m probably not as anxious as others are because it’s familiar territory for me — whatever the scenario is, we’ll deal with it,” Postecoglou said.\nThe manager may also be helped in some respects by the fact expectations will be lower and there will be an understanding that there has to be a period of post-Kane transition.\nAdvertisement\nAnd as he said on Friday: “Harry going doesn’t change my vision of what I’m trying to bring to this football club.\n“It’s fairly obvious that a club of this stature has to find a way to win things. I think you can do that in many different ways. I have a very specific way of trying to bring success to a football club, that is playing the game a certain way and that is what I’m going to focus on.”\nIt’s early days, but how he navigates the post-Kane transition will surely be the defining challenge of Postecoglou’s tenure.\n(Top photo: Getty Images)",
