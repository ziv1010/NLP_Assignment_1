  "body_text": "Miami without Messi? Why FC Cincinnati might not face off against superstar on Saturday\nFC Cincinnati returns to the pitch Saturday after the league gathered in Austin, Texas for All-Star festivities.\nCaptained by Evander, the MLS' best defeated Liga MX, 3-1, but did so without the league's most recognizable player.\nLionel Messi, along with Inter Miami teammate Jordi Alba, were voted into the MLS all-star side but neither participated in the week's festivities. Under MLS rules, players who are voted to the mid-season exhibition but do not participate without a credible injury report are subject to a one-match suspension.\nThis was the case for Los Angeles Football Club's Zlatan Ibrahimović, who missed the 2018 affair and missed LAFC's next game.\nIf the suspensions hold, this would mean both Messi and Alba would miss Miami's next match, which will happen in south Florida against the Orange and Blue.\nHowever, in a press conference prior to kickoff Wednesday, MLS commissioner Don Garber declined to confirm if the suspensions will be upheld.\nGarber, saying that he wished he would have known about the Argentine's plans for missing the game sooner, also said a decision would come late this week.\nThe commissioner cited a busy summer for Messi and the Herons, which is a fact: Aside from MLS matches, Miami took part in the FIFA Club World Cup, which saw Miami play four matches.\nPrior to the summer, Miami made a deep run into the CONCACAF Champions League, which ended when they fell to Vancouver in the semifinals in late April (the competition started the last week of February).\nOver his last nine matches across all competitions, Messi has played all 90 minutes.\nWith or without one of the most beloved players of all time, FC Cincinnati should prove to be a tough test for the Herons. Since joining MLS at the end of the 2023 season, Messi has yet to score against The FC.\nCincinnati and Miami will kick off Saturday at 7:15 p.m. It'll mark Cincinnati's final MLS game before Leagues Cup play kicks off on Thursday.",
