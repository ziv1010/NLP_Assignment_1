  "body_text": "Tottenham 0-2 Aston Villa: Angry Spurs fans turn on Daniel Levy and boo the players off the pitch after second-half goals from Emi Buendia and Douglas Luiz give Unai Emery's side a deserved victory\n- Tottenham Hotspur missed the opportunity to return to the Premier League top four as they lost to Aston Villa\n- Manchester United remain in fourth with Liverpool now breathing down the necks of Antonio Conte's side\n- Villa were good value for their win, earned courtesy of goals by Emi Buendia and Douglas Luiz after the break\n- Buendia slotted home after Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris failed to hold a long-range effort from Luiz\n- The Brazilian then applied the finishing touch to John McGinn's through pass to double Villa's advantage\n- Harry Kane saw an effort cleared off the line by Ashley Young but Tottenham struggled to make much impact\nAntonio Conte completed an unwanted and imperfect 10 as Hugo Lloris suffered a post-traumatic World Cup flashback at the hands of another Argentinian and dissent simmered in the stands.\nOn the touchline, short on options, Conte did not wear the expression of a manager keen to activate a one-year extension clause in his contract. Up front, Harry Kane toiled in vain, forgiven if he once more pines for an escape as he moves towards the last year of his own deal.\nThe fresh optimism that is supposed to accompany the start of a new year was Aston Villa’s to enjoy alone. They are improving with Unai Emery at the helm.\nEmi Buendia jumps for joy after scoring Aston Villa's opening goal in their 2-0 win over Tottenham on Sunday afternoon\nBuendia slotted home after Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris wasn't able to hold on to Douglas Luiz's long-range attempt\nVilla were good value for the lead handed to them by Buendia early in the second-half as Tottenham struggled to impose\nThe excellent Douglas Luiz then applied the finishing touch to double Villa's lead on 73 minutes after John McGinn's pass\nThey deserved this victory, which lifted them further from trouble and into mid-table while stirring a mood of rebellion among home supporters, who turned on chairman Daniel Levy with a chorus imploring him to get out of the club and booed the players from the pitch at the final whistle.\nEmerson Royal’s entrance as a late substitute was met with groans while Djed Spence came on to ironic cheers, aimed at Conte for using the young wing-back so sparingly since his arrival from Middlesbrough.\nThey are entitled to air their grievances. They pay the highest ticket prices in the country and can detect another season about to implode and end in nothing more than disappointment.\nLuiz celebrated his goal with a knee slide as Villa doubled their lead and ensured that Spurs would not return to the top four\nIt was a poor afternoon for Tottenham, with their forwards Son Heung-min (left) and Harry Kane (centre) both off-colour\nCaptain Lloris was at fault for Villa’s first, spilling what ought to have been a routine save from a 35-yard effort by Douglas Luiz, and then beaten to the rebound by Ollie Watkins who set up Emiliano Buendia to score.\nTwo weeks after France lost the World Cup final on penalties, Lloris was beaten by another Argentinian playmaker, five minutes into the second half. For the 10th game in row, Spurs conceded the first goal in the game.\nYves Bissouma failed to track the run of Luiz for Villa’s second. Boubacar Kamara, outstanding in midfield, won the ball from Kane. Luiz traded passes with John McGinn and beat Lloris as he collected the return.\nKane snatched at a second-half chance that flew wide of the target as Tottenham struggled to generate clear openings\nVilla manager Unai Emery urges his team on during a highly satisfactory afternoon in north London as they beat Tottenham\nOne negative for Villa was the knock Douglas Luiz suffered that forced him off late in the match after he scored their second\nMcGinn tweaked a hamstring soon after and Luiz twisted an ankle as he threatened a third. Emery said he hoped neither injury was serious.\nConte is the manager with more on his mind as he warned against the dangers of losing control and slipping away from contention.\nWith Dejan Kulusevski absent with an apparently minor muscle injury, the Italian handed a rare start up front to Bryan Gil.\nCristian Romero made his first appearance since the World Cup and returned in typically physical style, booked in the first half-hour for a rash tackle from behind and perhaps fortunate to escape a second yellow for a barge on Philippe Coutinho towards the end of the game.\nTottenham’s most encouraging spell came towards the end of the first half, and the closest they came to a goal was a header by Kane cleared off the line by Ashley Young during this period.\nClement Lenglet picked out Ivan Perisic, on the move, behind the line from the left. Perisic took it past Robin Olsen but his touch forced him too wide to shoot and he turned and clipped a pass towards the back post, where Kane climbed to win the header.\nIt was on target, bouncing inside the post with Olsen out of his goal, but Young was back to clear.\nVilla were comfortably the better team once they had the lead, always more likely to extend it on the counter attack than lose it.\nTottenham enjoyed plenty of the ball while creating very little. Son Heung-min took his frustrations out on his protective mask, discarding it angrily after losing the ball to Leon Bailey.\nSon has worn it since fracturing his cheekbone in four places near his eye socket in Marseille at the start of November, but his poor form predates the injury. For whatever reason, last season’s Golden Boot winner has not been the same threat this term.\nHe is not alone at Spurs, however, in misfiring in this strange season. They have won only two of their last seven games in the Premier League and look like one of those teams to have come out of the World Cup break badly, as their north London neighbours stride on at the top.\nThe doomsday scenario looms over the second half of this season. If they finish outside the top four, they could lose Conte. If they lose Conte, they could lose Kane — be it this year, or next on a free.\nA pile-up as Villa keeper Robin Olsen stops Tottenham's Bryan Gil as Tyrone Mings watches on in north London\nVilla striker Ollie Watkins dragged a poor shot wide of the near post during the opening period as Tottenham were opened up\nThen the rebuilding job will feel enormous without big money to compete in the transfer market at a time when rivals such as Liverpool and Chelsea are investing in players like Cody Gakpo and Christopher Nkunku.\nAll ifs and buts, you might say, but it will provide the backdrop for the rest of the season at Tottenham if they cannot arrest this slide.\nRE-LIVE ALL THE ACTION AS IT UNFOLDED WITH ADAM SHERGOLD BELOW\n-\nAdam Shergold\nHost commentator\nMany thanks for accompanying me on the live blog this afternoon.\nIf you refresh this page in a few minutes’ time, you can read the match report from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium - and we’ll have all the reaction from the game on our sports page throughout the evening.\nNottingham Forest vs Chelsea is coming up at 4.30 and you can follow that one live by clicking below.\nGoodbye for now.\nThat is that for the first Premier League game of the year and a few boos greet Tottenham’s performance, which has been pretty shocking as they pass up the chance to return to the top four.\nThat will delight Manchester United, who remain fourth for a few more days.\nBut credit must go to Villa, who performed solidly in the first half and then got the goals they deserved after the break. The first one came from Emi Buendia and the second from the excellent Douglas Luiz.\nIt’s only encouragement to begin 2023 for Unai Emery but Antonio Conte has some serious questions to answer.\n90+6min: The game winds down with Villa winning another corner. No rush as you’d imagine. They have been very good value for the three points they’re about to win here.\n90+4min: Son Heung-min, who’s been really poor all afternoon, miscontrols a simple pass and the ball dribbles out of play. And that sums it up for him and his team….\n90+3min: Calum Chambers gets a booking for delaying the restart at a Spurs free-kick. Doubt he’s bothered.\n90min: We enter seven minutes of additional time…\nThere is absolutely no reaction from the home fans, which tells you everything about their optimism they’ll come back into this.\n88min: Tottenham win a late corner as they somehow try to claw their way back into the game. Son once again with a shocking delivery than doesn’t beat the first man. There are groans.\nA final change for Spurs as Hojbjerg is replaced by Oliver Skipp, and Perisic is taken off for Djed Spence. This is actually the earliest Spence has come on in a Spurs game - it’s minute 88.\n86min: Romero once again walking the tightrope as he barges Coutinho over the touchline in quite a painful fashion. The Argentine probably would have been booked had the ball not already crossed the line.\n84min: Villa slowing the game down to a crawl in the final few minutes as they earn another corner courtesy of Danny Ings. Lucas Digne milks the applause of the away fans as he takes it. The corner is easily cleared.\n82min: Villa making a triple change as we enter the final 10 minutes. Calum Chambers, Jan Bednarek and Danny Ings on for Emi Buendia, Douglas Luiz and Ezri Konsa.\n79min: This is more worrying for Douglas Luiz, who appears to have tweaked something in the act of shooting for goal.\nWhile he receives treatment, Spurs are going to make two changes. Pape Sarr comes on for his Tottenham debut, replacing Yves Bissouma, while Emerson Eoyal is on for Matt Doherty.\nJohn McGinn will have to go off and on comes Philippe Coutinho.\nCristian Romero on a booking but that doesn’t stop him taking a swipe at John McGinn, who has stayed down to receive treatment on what looks like his hamstring.\nThat could well do it for Aston Villa! Douglas Luiz has been excellent and he’s finished very nicely there to make it 2-0.\nThey have looked the greater scoring threat since going in front and after winning the ball back, John McGinn chips a lovely through ball to Luiz in the box and he takes a touch before nudging it beyond Lloris.\nThat goal has most likely ended Tottenham’s hopes of going into the top four again today.\n71min: Good football by Buendia, who gets into a pocket of space and drives to the edge of the Spurs box. He doesn’t shoot and there’s no obvious pass so he tries the Rabona through ball looking for Watkins. That was unfortunately never going to work.\n68min: It just hasn’t been Harry Kane’s day so far and the ball bounced awkwardly there as he swung his boot to shoot in a good position. It balloons up and wide of the target and Villa breathe a sigh of relief.\n66min: Some blatant time-wasting by Villa’s Enzi Konsa there and he is booked. Villa in little rush to do anything at the moment and who can blame them.\n65min: Villa make a sub - Leon Bailey is the man taken off, to be replaced by Matty Cash. A little bit more cover against Son Heung-min on the Villa right.\n64min: Villa still causing issues and Douglas Luiz, who’s having a storming game in midfield, slips the ball through to Ollie Watkins, who sees his shot blocked. He did snatch at the chance.\n63min: Antonio Conte turns to his bench just past the hour mark as Bryan Gil goes off for Ryan Sessegnon. 50th Spurs appearance for Sessegnon today.\n61min: A crucial sliding tackle there by Ashley Young to prevent a dangerous Tottenham counter. Son and Kane had combined with the South Korean poised to cross to Bryan Gil in the centre.\n59min: Yves Bissouma the latest in the book as he brings down Kamara, who was in full flight for Villa. That’s his fifth booking and he’ll miss the game with Palace on Wednesday.\n57min: Spurs almost in for an equaliser - the ball breaks really nicely to Ivan Perisic inside the box after a cross breaks nicely for him. Konsa is sliding in, which hurries Perisic up and he can only clear the bar with his eventual effort.\n56min: Ironic cheers from the Spurs fans as Harry Kane wins a free-kick when Mings caught him late with the ball gone. Mings into the book.\n54min: Villa trying to cause more problems as they float in a free-kick. Mings almost wriggles free inside the box but Matt Doherty eventually clears the danger.\nI did say that Villa might fancy their chances the longer this remains goalless - and so it has proved.\nTottenham fall behind yet again and it’s their keeper Hugo Lloris at fault. It was a long range shot by Douglas Luiz that the Frenchman can’t keep hold of, Ollie Watkins is first to the loose ball and he turns and picks out Buendia, who slots home very nicely.\nI’m sure Lloris won’t thrilled at being beaten by an Argentinean given recent events!\n46min: A promising situation for Spurs ruined when Harry Kane shoulders Tyrone Mings while trying to run into a good position. He is bemused to be penalised.\nThe two teams back on the pitch ahead of the second period. Solid enough from Aston Villa so far and they’ll fancy their chances of getting all three points out of this the longer it remains 0-0.\nTottenham really do need to improve if they’re to break back into the top four.\nNo changes at the break.\nThis game is the first part of a Sunday double-header this New Year’s Day.\nThe second match sees Chelsea aim to move a little closer to the top four themselves as they head to second-bottom Nottingham Forest.\nYou can follow all the build-up to that one by clicking the link below.\nIt’s been a poor spectacle to kick off 2023 in the Premier League. Tottenham have become accustomed to slow starts and here’s another example.\nAside from Harry Kane’s header being cleared away by Ashley Young in front of the line, they’re created very little. At least they haven’t conceded, however, which is an improvement on most recent games.\nVilla have enjoyed the odd moment without really threatening.\nThings can only get better.\n45min: Into two minutes of additional time which is more than enough to be honest.\nIt comes as Villa counter and Emi Buendia decides to shoot and curls high and wide.\n44min: Spurs enjoying their best spell of pressure in the game and Son has the chance to whip in a free-kick from the left that was conceded by Young.\nSon goes for goal but Robin Olsen is simply able to reach up and pluck it out the air.\n43min: Some neat football by Tottenham, with Bissouma, Hojbjerg and then Son combining to almost set Harry Kane through clear on goal. Just a fraction ahead of the England captain and Olsen can claim it.\n40min: That’s by some distance the closest Tottenham have come to taking the lead. Harry Kane with the back post header and Ashley Young does well to head it off the line!\nIt came after Robin Olsen did well to steer Perisic just wide enough so he could only cross and not shoot.\n37min: A bit of a flashpoint and Ben Davies now has a yellow card to complete the set of Spurs defenders on bookings. He jumped in naively on Ashley Young there.\n31min: A few groans around the stadium as another Spurs ball into the box is easily collected by Robin Olsen. That came a few seconds after Son badly under-hit a corner.\nClement Lenglet is now into the book for a foul. That’s two of the Tottenham back three on a caution.\n28min: Cristian Romero was a little over-zealous with his tackle on Ollie Watkins there and he receives a yellow card. Romero taking the ball and the man there.\n26min: Bissouma down after taking a blow to the head as he went for the ball with Ollie Watkins, who was back on defensive duty. An accidental coming together with Watkins raising his leg to clear the ball and Bissouma ducking down to reach it.\n24min: Young struggling a little bit after a collision with Ben Davies. The 37-year-old needs a bit of treatment and Matty Cash is quickly warming up just in case.\nYoung is back on his feet and will continue for now.\n22min; Tottenham finally starting to enjoy more possession as we pass the midway point in the first half. But Villa holding firm defensively until Spurs resort into a long ball looking for Ivan Perisic and Ashley Young can clear.\n19min: Son is slack in possession inside his own half and is robbed of the ball by Leon Bailey. The move doesn’t come to anything as Son atones with the tackle. The South Korean rips off his face mask in frustration and will play on without it as it's thrown to the side of the pitch.\n17mins: Harry Kane hasn’t had a single touch of the ball so far - Villa have to be satisfied with that. It’s been a very low key start.\n15min: A coming together right on the edge of the area between Doherty and Lucas Digne as they try to reach a diagonal ball. Doherty goes down but the referee decides there wasn’t enough contact.\n12min: Better football there from Tottenham, first with Perisic on the left and then Bryan Gil on the right. Doherty gets into the Villa box with a nutmeg and they win a corner.\nThe low, flat delivery is easily cleared by Tyrone Mings.\n9min: The first shot in anger of the contest as Ollie Watkins surges forward down the left for Villa. He cuts inside the defenders, who was caught on his heels, but it’s a poor finish and dragged wide of the near post.\n8min: That’s better from Tottenham as Ivan Perisic is picked out on the left touchline and floats a cross in looking for Harry Kane. Villa get the ball away after Douglas Luiz was fouled trying to dribble the ball out.\n5min: Villa enjoying a lot of the ball in the opening minutes as their travelling fans taunt their Tottenham counterparts with chants of ‘champions of Europe, you’ll never sing that.’\nDouglas Luiz tries to bulldoze his way through but can’t do it and Leon Bailey then comes away limping from his trip on Son.\n3min: Tottenham have conceded the first goal in each of their last nine games and Villa have won themselves an early free-kick opportunity about 35 yards from goal.\nIt’s shifted to the right to Ashley Young but his speculative effort is blocked by Son Heung-min.\nThe first Premier League match of 2023 is off and running.\nIn accordance with all Premier League games this weekend, the two teams lining up around the centre circle for a minute of applause for the late, great Pele, who died last week aged 82.\nThe two sets of players are welcomed out onto then pitch in north London. Spurs playing in their usual white and blue, Villa in familiar claret and blue.\nLet’s get the Premier League action for 2023 underway then… a sell-out crowd at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this afternoon as Tottenham aim to return to the top four with a win over Aston Villa.\nCan Spurs get off to a quicker start than they usually do and not concede the first goal today?\nTottenham’s Brazilian star Richarlison is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury and is expected to be out for six weeks. But he is in the house to watch today’s game.\nTottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Lenglet, Romero, Davies, Doherty, Bissouma, Hojbjerg, Perisic, Gil Salvatierra, Kane, Son.\nSubstitutes: Skipp, Sanchez, Emerson, Dier, Sessegnon, Forster, Spence, Tanganga, Sarr.\nAston Villa: Olsen, Ashley Young, Konsa, Mings, Digne, McGinn, Kamara, Douglas Luiz, Buendia, Bailey, Watkins\nSubstitutes: Martinez, Cash, Sanson, Ings, Chambers, Augustinsson, Bednarek, Coutinho, Archer.\nReferee: John Brooks (Leicestershire)\nSon Heung-min still taking no chances after suffering that fracture around his left eye in the game with Marseille two months ago.
