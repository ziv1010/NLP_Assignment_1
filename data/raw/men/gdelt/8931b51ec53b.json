  "body_text": "Football transfer news journalist Fabrizio Romano has given his latest update on the Xabi Alonso to Liverpool links as it seems the Reds have taken some steps to find out how they could appoint the Bayer Leverkusen manager to replace Jurgen Klopp.\nKlopp recently confirmed that he would be stepping down as Liverpool manager at the end of this season, and ever since then we’ve heard Alonso’s name mentioned as one of the favourites to take over at Anfield.\nThe Spanish tactician has done superb work at Bayer Leverkusen and it’s fair to say Romano is a big fan of the work he’s been doing, as he described him as ‘fantastic’ and ‘incredible’ as he spoke exclusively to CaughtOffside for his Daily Briefing column.\nWhile it still seems to be the case that Liverpool need to sort out appointing a sporting director before deciding on their next manager, Alonso seems to be clearly emerging as a strong candidate for the Reds.\nHowever, Bayern Munich have also been mentioned as potential suitors by Romano, who has explained that Thomas Tuchel’s position could soon be assessed as the team’s current form and the mood inside the club just isn’t good enough.\n“Bayern Munich have spoken publicly and privately about the manager situation, saying that their intention is not to fire Thomas Tuchel. Of course people at the club are very disappointed after the 3-0 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen – the performance was poor, and the general atmosphere at the club is not what was expected. Bayern are not happy, but it hasn’t changed their plans for the moment,” Romano said.\n“At the moment the situation is not easy, and for sure the situation of Tuchel will be assessed at the end of the season. There is no intention to make a change now, but of course there will be internal talks about the situation because they can’t continue like this in the Bundesliga, and now Champions League games are coming too. Results in these games will of course be important when it comes to assessing the position of Tuchel.\n“It’s important to say that Xabi Alonso, a former Bayern player, has always been appreciated by people at the club, and now he’s also having this fantastic experience as Bayer Leverkusen manager. He could be a future candidate for the Bayern job, as they have appreciated him since last year, but it’s not something happening now, and Liverpool are also well informed on the situation of Alonso – they know everything about his contract situation at Leverkusen and how to appoint the Spaniard in the summer.\n“So, Liverpool are really well informed, but we’ll have to wait also for the Reds to appoint a new sporting director. Then they will decide how and when and in which way to ‘attack’ the Alonso situation.\n“We also have to see if they go for another candidate, because there is a shortlist, it’s not only Alonso. But, for sure, Alonso is the main candidate for Liverpool – this is not something new that is happening today, but something they’ve had in mind for a long time.\nBut, again, let’s wait for the new director to see what happens in terms of the direction of the project and with the new manager. Before proceeding in concrete negotiations for a new manager Liverpool will appoint a new director of football.\n“In my opinion, even if other names can’t be ruled out, Alonso is an incredible, top coach and he’d be a fantastic pick for any club.”",
