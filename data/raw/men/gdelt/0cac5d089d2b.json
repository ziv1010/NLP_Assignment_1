No questions asked.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nFailing to win their qualifying game in the Champions League does not mean they would fall into the Europa League, and therefore, they could still earn two spots into Europe this season and yet still, mathematically, not play any football in any European competition in 2025/26.\nTo add further potential misery, Ligue 1 side Strasbourg are on course to qualify for Europe too, with Liam Rosenior's side also owned by BlueCo.\nAs previously reported with Manchester United and Nice's situation, Strasbourg would be required to move into a 'blind' trust to remove any conflicts, or BlueCo could reduce their stake in one of the clubs to satisfy UEFA's rules.\nFor now, the Blues seem persistent in their aims to qualify for the Champions League and manager Maresca is backing his side to do so.\n\"Personally, the goal from Pedro (Neto) doesn't change my view of the season,\" said Maresca after the win over Fulham last month. \"I said three or four days ago, and I will repeat, Chelsea in the last two years have never been in the Champions League spots and this season we spent all season there.\n\"So today's win doesn't change my view. It's already a good season and can become very good if we finish in the Champions League spots, no doubt.\n\"But for sure, today was an important win because first of all it's a derby, second, it gives us the chance to be there. And probably it was the most difficult win, and the reason why is because they (league rivals) all played yesterday.\"\nMatthew Holt writes freelance for FourFourTwo, amongst others, and boasts previous experience at GOAL and SPORTBible.
