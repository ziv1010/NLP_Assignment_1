  "body_text": "English Premier League (EPL) players are \"close\" to going on strike, according to Manchester City midfielder Rodri.\nTalk of strike action comes after a number of EPL players - including City defender Manuel Akanji and Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker – have expressed concerns about the additional workload facing elite players.\nChief executive of the English players’ union, Maheta Molango, has also said those running the game must “sit up and take notice” of their comments.\nCity is one of the clubs that faces a busy season as they compete in the new-look Champions League and an expanded Club World Cup next summer.\nEuro 2024 winner Rodri, one of the leading contenders for this year’s Ballon d’Or award, agrees the scheduling issue is a major concern.\nEPL players \"close\" to going on strike and that's \"the general opinion\"\nAsked during a press conference on Tuesday (September 17) if players would strike or refuse to play due the hectic schedule, Rodri said: “I think we are close to that. I think if you ask any player he will say the same.\n“It is not the opinion of Rodri or whatever. I think it’s the general opinion of the players.\n“And if it keeps this way, there will be a moment where we have no other option, I really think, but let’s see.\n“I don’t know what’s going to happen but it’s something that worries us because we are the guys that suffer.”\nNew schedule is \"too much\"\nRodri was speaking ahead of City’s Champions League opener against Inter Milan at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday (September 18).\nThe match will be City’s first taste of the event’s new league phase – a 36-team competition in which all teams will play eight unique fixtures.\nThat is an increase of two on the old group stage, while teams finishing in positions nine to 24 will play an additional two-legged play-off tie.\nThat means City, having featured in the Community Shield in August, could potentially play 75 matches this season.\nPlayers featuring in international football could face even more.\nRodri said: “From my experience between 40-50 is the amount of games in which a player can perform in the highest level.\n“After that you drop because it is impossible to sustain the physical level.\n“This year we can go to 70, maybe 80. I don’t know, it depends how far you go in the competitions.\n“In my humble opinion I think it is too much. I think we have to take care of ourselves.\n\"Someone has to take care of ourselves because we are the main characters of this sport or business or whatever you want to call it.\n“Not everything is money or marketing – it is also the quality of the show.\n“When I am not tired I perform better and if the people want to see a better football, we need to rest.”\nFootball calendar \"doesn't work\", says PFA chief executive\nThe Professional Footballers’ Association is involved in two separate legal challenges to the sport’s global governing body FIFA over the fixture calendar.\nWhile the introduction of a 32-team Club World Cup has been widely described by unions and domestic leagues as a “tipping point” in prompting the actions through the legal system.\nResponding to Rodri’s remarks on Tuesday, PFA chief executive Molango said: “The impact of fixture congestion and increasing player workload is no longer a problem that’s coming down the line. It’s already here.\n“This is the year when we can look at the calendar and say clearly ‘this doesn’t work’. Players see that and they are now experiencing it.\n“They’re making their feelings increasingly clear but, as I’ve said before, this is no longer just a player problem – this is a problem for everyone in football.\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n- UEFA issues warning England 'could face Euros ban' over regulator plans\n-\nSee the 10 stadiums in the UK and Ireland that will host Euro 2028 matches\n“As unions, we are already taking legal action to challenge this and players are now openly talking about what options are available to them to force change.\n“They want to be listened to, and those who run the game must now sit up and take notice.”\nFIFA did not respond directly to Rodri’s comments, but has previously hit out at the “self-interest” and “hypocrisy” it claims is at play.",
