And just when he thought another opportunity had passed him by with Nigeria on the march to another African Cup of Nations campaign, an injury to Super Eagles midfield enforcer, Wilfred Ndidi, culminated to a late call-up for Royal Antwerp midfielder, Alhassan Yusuf to join the Eagles party to AFCON in Cote D’Ivoire. The big question is if the former IFK Goteborg man can cash-in on the opportunity and make his national team’s place permanent with a convincing performance at the biennial competition\nHe has shown high level of consistency since his time in Sweden where he won several awards including IFK Goteborg Young Player of the Year in 2020 before he was snapped by Royal Antwerp. Alhassan Yusuf has been knocking on the door for a place in the Super Eagles. Little wonder former Nigeria caretaker coach, Augustin Eguavoen once said of him, “He has that quality I want.”\nWith Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi out of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Côte d’Ivoire due to injury, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), has called on Royal Antwerp midfielder, Alhassan Yusuf as a last-minute replacement for the midfield enforcer.\n“Midfielder Alhassan Yusuf replaces injured Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho still hopeful to join the team before AFCON commences,” an official statement reads.\nThe 23-year-old Yusuf who has been in fine form for Royal Antwerp is uncapped player for the Super Eagles but helped his team to the Belgian league title last season and competed in all their Champions League group matches between September and December.\nYusuf is one of the new players to be invited to the Nigeria senior national team, having made the cut for the international friendlies against Mexico and Ecuador.\nBorn in Kano, Nigeria – the midfielder began his professional career at Nigerian side FC Hearts before moving to Allsvenskan outfit IFK Goteborg in 2018 after impressing at Gothia Cup in Sweden.\nIn his maiden season at the Gamla Ullevi, he made one league appearance for the Comrades – making a 93rd appearance for Giorgi Kharaishvili’s side in the 2-0 away win at Brommapojkarna on October 22, 2018.\nThe following season, he featured prominently in Goteborg’s squad, accruing 26 league appearances with two goals to his credit.\nHis displays were not left unnoticed in the Swedish league as he won the Allsvenskan Newcomer of the Year award.\nOverall, he made 66 league appearances while finding the net on two occasions and providing four assists.\nIn the 2021-22 campaign, Yusuf’s maiden season at Royal Antwerp, the midfield trojan has been a key figure in Brian Priske’s squad, making 29 league appearances plus three goals.\nYusuf is an adaptable midfielder who has a predatory instinct in terms of scoring goals.\n“He is currently playing as a defensive midfielder at Royal Antwerp, but can also play as an attacking midfielder,” Tripple 44 Academy president Samuel Olatunji-Okuku told GOAL about the player’s stirring qualities.\n“He’s a talented youngster. He is box to box kind of midfielder, a very hardworking midfielder who can win the ball and also find a final pass.\n“He has got an eye for goals as well. Overall, he’s got a very wonderful mentality and he will go places.”\nYusuf is a strong and quick midfielder who is very good when it comes to aerial balls and long-range shooting.\nBlessed with a petite look, the 23-year-old is tactically sound and on a good shift, he can cause restless moments for opponents.\nAlthough he does not score often, he occasionally assists the attack.\nMeanwhile, Belgium’s reigning Jupiler Pro League champions, Royal Antwerp, have responded to Alhassan Yusuf’s inclusion in Nigeria’s squad for the highly anticipated 2023 Africa Cup of Nations.\nThe 23-year-old midfielder was officially named the replacement for injured Leicester City star Wilfred Ndidi, marking his debut call-up to the esteemed Super Eagles.\nIn a gesture of support, the Belgian champions conveyed their best wishes to Yusuf via their official X platform, expressing their excitement as he prepares to represent Nigeria in the upcoming continental tournament.\n“Alhassan Yusuf has just been called up to the Nigerian national team. Good luck at the Africa Cup, Yus!,” shared Royal Antwerp through their social media page.\nYusuf, formerly with IFK Goteborg in Sweden, has since joined the Super Eagles at their training base in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\nWith 25 appearances for the Belgian side under his belt this season, Yusuf notably contributed a goal during their UEFA Champions League encounter against Porto FC and provided an assist in their 3-2 victory against Barcelona.\nAs the tournament approaches, Yusuf’s addition to the Super Eagles’ roster is expected to inject a sense of hope in the Super Eagles midfield.\nWhile Yusuf has not yet been capped for the Nigerian national team, his inclusion in the provisional list for AFCON speaks volumes about his potential and the expectations placed on him. His performance in the UEFA Champions League, where he scored on his debut, further cements his status as a player of international calibre.\nYusuf’s journey from a young talent in Nigeria to a rising star in European football is a story of determination, skill, and passion. His story is not just about football; it’s about the potential of youth and the boundless opportunities that come with talent and hard work.\nAs he steps in to replace Ndidi for AFCON, all eyes will be on him to see if he can translate his club’s success to the international stage.\nNigeria’s Super Eagles are to begin their Group A campaign against Equatorial Guinea on 14 January, and the three-time African champions will also face hosts Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau in the group stage.",
