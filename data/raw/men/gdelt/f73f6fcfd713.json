He struggled somewhat as he only scored four goals in his 17 Premier League appearances.\nThat seemingly hasn’t put Tottenham off however and the report claims they’ve decided on Toney as their top attacking target for the summer.\nREAD MORE: Lazio to ‘make an exception’ to seal ‘quality’ Tottenham raid after broken Postecoglou promise\nIvan Toney ‘agrees’ Tottenham contract\nIt’s no secret that Toney is keen to join a big club this summer and he’s reportedly ‘agreed personal terms’ with Tottenham, per Football Transfers’ report.\nThe only thing left for Postecoglou’s side to negotiate is a transfer fee with Brentford. The Bees are ‘asking for a fee of £65m’ but it is understood that ‘an offer of £55m would secure the deal.’\nThey claim Spurs ‘have the financial capability to outbid any competitors for the Bees hitman. However, the available funds will need to be carefully managed, as the Lilywhites plan to bring in five new signings to boost their chances of securing Champions League football next season.’\nPostecoglou reportedly views Toney as the ideal replacement for the departed Harry Kane and talks will continue in the coming weeks.\nBrentford boss Thomas Frank was on punditry duty on BBC One for Monday’s clash between Romania and Ukraine and hinted that Toney’s departure is far from agreed.\nBefore the match, discussions centred around Ukrainian striker Artem Dovbyk.\nThe 26-year-old is reportedly being tracked by a number of European clubs, after scoring 24 times for La Liga side Girona last season.\n“There’s a lot of clubs looking at him I don’t doubt that,” Frank said of Dovbyk. “I can see him in the Premier League in the future as well, I like his left foot, it’s really, really good.”\nThis brought a jibe from Mark Chapman, who said: “Maybe in red and white (Brentford colours)? I wasn’t expecting you to tell us your transfer plans.”\nFrank laughed before replying: “You never know…..but no I don’t think so, I think we have a pretty good striker in Ivan Toney.”\nDON’T MISS: Tottenham striker targets: EVERY single option linked with a summer 2024 switch",
