Marcus Rashford is in the form of his life at the moment, while the likes of Antony, Jadon Sancho and Bruno Fernandes have shined under Erik Ten Hag.\nAsensio would provide some world-class cover for all of those players though and arguably, is good enough to go straight into the Red Devil’s starting XI.\nAsensio could be a huge signing for Tottenham\nTottenham, however, are probably the most in need of new recruits, as they look to rebuild their squad ahead of next season.\nThis summer could be an eventful period for Spurs, with Antonio Conte coming to the end of his contract and Mauricio Pochettino lined up by Daniel Levy as a potential replacement.\nConte has previously said that his current squad is not at the level required to challenge for trophies, so bringing in Asensio could be a step in the right direction.\nThe Italian manager brought in Richarlison at the start of the campaign, but so far, he has failed to find form in London. Heung-min Son’s form has also been fairly inconsistent, while Harry Kane is being linked with a shock summer departure.\nWith that in mind, Levy and co will need to bring in players who can both create and score goals consistently, something that Asensio has done throughout his career.\nIt will be interesting to see which of the Premier League giants come out on top in the race for the Real Madrid star. At the moment, Asensio looks set for a switch to England.\nREAD MORE: Tottenham talks progressing as plans emerge for versatile star to make three-year commitment",
