He loves the players he plays with, the staff, the team, and I've never had any issue with him.\"\nNewcastle had a £70m bid rejected for Ekitike, while they have an interest in Brentford forward Yoane Wissa.\nMeanwhile, Newcastle defender Lewis Hall, who has not featured since February with a foot injury, has been included in the tour squad.\nNewcastle face Arsenal on Sunday in Singapore before travelling to South Korea to play a K-League All-Star team on 30 July and Tottenham on 3 August.\nInjury claim 'ridiculous' - Shearer\nNewcastle legend Alan Shearer said the claims that Isak's absence from their Asia tour are injury-related are \"ridiculous\".\nThe former England striker, who scored a record 206 goals for the Tyneside club, believes they should have been open about the situation.\n\"It's ridiculous what Newcastle put out this morning to say he wasn't on the trip because of a slight thigh injury,\" said Shearer.\n\"If they thought people wouldn't see through that... it was disappointing.\n\"They should have just told the truth straight away. I understand it's a very difficult situation for them, but it is what it is.\n\"Eddie Howe has to use all his persuasive powers to do what he can and try to make him stay at least one more year. If that can't happen, then it is what it is.\n\"You have to get the very best deal for the football club, and if someone is prepared to pay north of £150m, and if he really, really wants to go, you can't step in his way.\"\nWhich teams could afford Isak?\nNewcastle have been steadfast in their stance on Isak throughout the summer as Howe looks to keep his squad intact for a return to the Champions League.\nThe forward has three years left on his contract, and the Magpies, owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), are in a comfortable position with profit and sustainability rules (PSR), meaning they are under no pressure to sell.\nMost Premier League clubs are unable to match Newcastle's reported £130m valuation.\nArsenal have previously been credited with an interest and have the budget, but they have since turned their attention to his fellow Swede Viktor Gyokeres and are close to finalising a deal.\nManchester City have the funds to go after Isak, but are unlikely to pursue a transfer with Erling Haaland under a contract until 2034.\nChelsea have also added strikers Liam Delap and Joao Pedro to their squad this summer.\nLatest Stories\n-\nThis is not the time to settle political scores – Bawumia to government\n52 minutes -\n37% of SHS students exposed to drugs – Opare-Addo\n1 hour -\nNLC secures court injunction against striking tertiary unions\n2 hours -\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n2 hours -\nRed Notice cancellation: OSP official fires back at Ofori-Atta’s lawyers\n2 hours -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n3 hours -\nAAG raises alarm over billboard demolitions, calls for presidential intervention\n3 hours -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n4 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n4 hours -\nCocoa crisis, galamsey complicity and election credibility to dominate this Saturday’s Newsfile\n5 hours -\nINTERPOL deletes Red Notice for Ofori-Atta as extradition process continues — OSP confirms\n5 hours -\nMasterMinds resources positions itself as key player in skills development and workforce training\n7 hours -\nINTERPOL has deleted Ofori-Atta’s Red Notice – Lawyers\n7 hours -\nSteven Spielberg donates $25,000 to James Van Der Beek’s $2m GoFundMe\n7 hours -\nSix possible effects of Trump’s climate policy change\n8 hours",
