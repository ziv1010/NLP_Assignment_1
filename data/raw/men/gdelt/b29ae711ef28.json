It’s hard to imagine that being realistic at this stage, but things certainly can’t go on like this for too much longer.\nCity’s next game is away to Liverpool in the Premier League this Sunday, which is hardly the fixture Guardiola and co. will have wanted at this moment in time.\nArne Slot’s Reds are in superb form right now and will be the clear favourites for this weekend’s clash, though after that there could be a bit of respite for City as they have some easier-looking fixtures in the form of Nottingham Forest at home and then Crystal Palace away, though immediately after that they have Juventus in the Champions League and the Manchester Derby to look forward to.",
