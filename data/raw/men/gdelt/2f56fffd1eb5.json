  "body_text": "New manager, new silly season. Liverpool FC fans can expect to see all sorts of transfer rumours crop up, especially in the vein of “will [insert Feyenoord player] follow Arne Slot to Merseyside?” variety.\nRumour Mongering: Kvaratskhelia’s Agent Speaks of Liverpool Interest\nWe do love our left-wingers.\nI didn’t expect an old, familiar name to turn up in the rumour mill this morning: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. The 23-year-old Georgian winger who gave us an ass-kicking last season in the Champions League is at a contract impasse with Napoli and could be moving on this summer.\nGazzetta dello Sport journalist Bacho Tsalugelashvili spoke to 1 Station Radio’s 1 Football Night (courtesy of Area Napoli) on Kvaradona’s future at Naples, with speculation rife about talks between the player’s agent and club president Aurelio De Laurentiis:\n“Is Kvaratskhelia’s agent talking to De Laurentiis? I believe the agent will meet the president next week.”\n“However, either the contract renewal will materialise or Kvara will go to a top club. I don’t know if it is Barcelona or another team.”\n“Could it be a Premier League club? I don’t know. Liverpool are also interested in Kvaratskhelia, although Barcelona’s interest is more concrete. There are management sources who confirm the Blaugrana’s desire.”\n“What could be the amount for which De Laurentiis would deprive himself of Kvaratskhelia? I can’t say precisely, but I understand a valuation between €100 million (£85million) and €120m (£102million).”\nFirst of all, another left-winger? Secondly, the idea of Barcelona dropping another casual €100 million is extremely funny.\nThere’s always a chance Liverpool will decide to do something with their forward line, possibly moving on from one of Diaz, Jota, or Gakpo. But Napoli and De Laurentiis are notoriously tough customers to negotiate with, and even with this contract situation, Kvara’s contract runs until 2027, which explains why the journalist dropped that massive valuation. For a club that loves to exploit contract situations and other market inefficiencies, I don’t see Liverpool getting into the game. I will encourage the rumour solely just to see Barcelona engage in more unhinged shopaholic behaviour, though.",
