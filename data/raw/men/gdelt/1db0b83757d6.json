  "body_text": "Popular Nigerian singer, Chinagorom Onuoha, better known as Africa China, talks about his love for football, Arsenal, Victor Osimhen, and more in this interview with Johnny Edward\nGrowing up, what sport did you enjoy?\nGrowing up, like most young kids across Nigeria, I enjoyed and still enjoy football. I love playing football. I also represented my secondary school in a relay race once but it obviously was not my calling as I loved music a lot.\nDid your parents ever discourage you from pursuing a career in sports?\nThey did not need to discourage me because I did not take up any sport as a career.\nWere you passionate about football growing up?\nI was back then but not any more even if I still play once in a while. I became a football lover in the late 1980s watching Nigerian national teams.\nAre you a fan of the Super Eagles?\nAbsolutely, yes.\nHow impressed were you with the team at the recent AFCON?\nI was impressed with the team based on the fact that they reached the final of the competition but I was so disappointed with the way they played throughout the tournament. They were too defensive right from the first game till the final game against Ivory Coast. The only time the Eagles played like the real Nigerian team we knew of old was when we were trailing 2-1 in the final and that was when the coach (Jose Peseiro) introduced Kelechi Iheanacho to support Victor Osimhen. Osimhen played alone up front and helped get us to the final but we needed another pattern be effective but our coach reacted too late to salvage the game.\nDo you think the Nigerian Football Federation should keep Peseiro on the job or allow him leave?\nI think they should let him go and give someone else a chace to lead the team. He has done his best and its obvious that all he can offer.\nWhat club do you support?\nI support Arsenal.\nWho is your favourite player in Arsenal?\nAt the moment it’s Bukayo Saka. For his young age, he plays with more composure and intelligence than his older teammates. He recently etched his name into Arsenal’s history books as the youngest player in the Premier League era to reach the 50-goal milestone following his two goals and assist against West Ham. I wish he plays for Nigeria, while my all time Arsenal favorite is Theirry Henry. He was amazing to watch. He led the lines so well for Arsenal winning titles but was unlucky not to have won the Champions League with the\nGunners.\nWhat do you think of Arsenal’s season so far?\nThey have been doing well but they lose games their fans least expect just like the game against FC Porto. Watching them over the years, Arsenal has made my heart so strong that I don’t suffer heart breaks or disappointment again but I believe Arsenal stands a good chance of winning the EPL this season if they maintain their league form.I see Liverpool and Manchester City losing more grounds.\nIf you could spend a day with any sportsperson, who would it be?\nCurrently, Victor Osimhen.\nWho do you think is the Greatest Footballer of all Time?\nThat is a tough question, but if I am to pick one I will take Pele.\nIf any of your children show an interest in sports, would you encourage them?\nOf course yes, it is the right thing to do.\nWho do you think is the best African player of all time?\nI know some will argue that I might be choosing him because he is Nigerian. Some will say he did not win much during his time of playing, but I choose Okocha any time, any day. To me, he is the most naturally skilled footballer I have ever seen.\nIn the Eagles squad, who is your favourite player?\nMy friend, Osimhen. Not just because we are friends, but his stats speak for him. He has achieved a lot as a footballer, broke our jinx and won the African Best Player award, which Okocha didn’t even win, and what he did last season in the Serie A.\nAre there any plans to collaborate with these new artist?\nCollaboration is something we cannot rule out in the industry. But, things have changed, and I understand. However, I don’t like the fact that when younger artistes see the people that laid the foundation (of the industry), they don’t respect them. They don’t know what we went through. These days, it is easier to stream one’s songs on digital music platforms. Before, those sites were not accessible to Nigerians. Back then, we would go to cyber cafes to do things like that.\nThen, people were not paying attention. We were just trying to make them love Nigerian music. In those days, we were competing with mega American artistes such as 2pac Shakur, P Diddy, Jenifer Lopez, R Kelly, and Busta Rhymes. We were not even competing with fellow Nigerian artistes, because we were all united in trying to push the industry to where it is today.\nWe are not asking the young artistes to give us money, but to respect us, if not for our age, but at least for the sacrifices we made for the\nindustry.",
