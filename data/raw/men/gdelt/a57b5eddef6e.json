According to journalist Ben Jacobs, he is on the radar of Chelsea, and it will be interesting to see if they decide to make a move for him.\nLiverpool are interested in the Netherlands defender as well.\nChelsea need defenders\nThere is no doubt that the Netherlands defender is an elite prospect with a bright future, and he could be a key player for the Blues in the long term. He can operate as a left-back as well as a central defender.\nThe player has nine goal contributions for Ajax this past season, and he could add a new dimension to the back line. The opportunity to join one of the biggest clubs in the world will be quite exciting for the players as well.\nChelsea have secured Champions League qualification for the next season, and they will look to fight for trophies.\nThey need to tighten up at the back, and signing the 19-year-old could be a wise decision. They have looked vulnerable at the back this past season.\nJorrel Hato could fancy Chelsea move\nHato has proven himself in Dutch football, and he will look to test himself at a higher level. A move to the Premier League could be ideal for him this summer. It remains to be seen whether Chelsea come forward with an offer to sign him. They have the resources to get the deal done, and the 19-year-old could prove to be a long-term investment for them.\nThe player has been labelled as a “special” talent in the past, and he will look to fulfil his potential with regular football in England.",
