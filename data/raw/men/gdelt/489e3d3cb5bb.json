The couple, along with their two youngest sons, Kit and Cass, enjoyed a magical day at the iconic theme park.\nColeen and Wayne Rooney recently treated their children to a magical family trip to Disneyland Paris.\nThe couple, who have been married for over a decade, were joined by their two youngest sons, Kit and Cass, for a memorable day at the iconic theme park. During their visit, the family posed for a photo with beloved Disney characters, including Mickey Mouse and Stitch from Lilo & Stitch.\nThe mother of four took to Instagram earlier today to post snaps from her family getaway. Coleen captioned the post: \"Such a magical trip to @disneylandparis . We absolutely loved it.\"\nFans flooded her comments, with one writing: \"Gorgeous memories forever.\" Another echoed: \"What amazing memories you’ve all made such a beautiful video of you all.\" A third penned: \"The unique family time with Kit and Cass,\" alongside a heart emoji. And a fourth added: \"Gorgeous family, Beautiful children.\"\nThe family trip to Paris followed the announcement that former footballer Wayne had secured a major new job. Wayne will join Prime Video for their coverage of Manchester City's Champions League clash with Real Madrid on Tuesday.\nWayne was sacked as Plymouth manager at the start of January, having endured a disastrous reign at Home Park. He oversaw just four league wins, all of which came at home, and left with the Pilgrims rock bottom of the Championship.\nThe Manchester United icon has stepped back into punditry by returning to The Overlap's Stick to Football podcast. And he will now be on the screens to provide analysis of City's play-off first leg against Madrid on Tuesday.\nWayne will join former Liverpool star Daniel Sturridge, AC Milan legend Clarence Seedorf and three-time Premier League title winner Gael Clichy on the punditry team. Gabby Logan will anchor the matchday show, with Jon Champion and Alan Shearer on commentary duty.\nIn a statement, Prime said: \"Prime has signed England and Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney to its UEFA Champions League punditry team, and he will make his debut tomorrow night when Manchester City take on Real Madrid in the first leg of their heavyweight Knockout Phase Play-Off clash.\n\"UCL winner Rooney will join Daniel Sturridge, Clarence Seedorf and Gael Clichy on the punditry team at the Etihad Stadium tomorrow night. The group will provide expert analysis from the moment coverage starts at 6.30pm, ahead of the 8pm kick-off available exclusively on Prime.\n\"Prime Video’s inaugural season of UEFA Champions League coverage in the UK and Ireland includes the top-pick match every Tuesday which is available to millions of households at no extra cost to their Prime membership.\"\nLike this story?
