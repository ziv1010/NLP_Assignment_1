And with the summer window opening for business in under two months’ time, preparation work is now underway.\nDespite signing Jorginho in January, the Arsenal boss remains keen to strengthen his midfield.\nAnd he has now set his sights on two players from neighbouring London clubs to boost his squad.\nFirst up, the Gunners are looking to sign Crystal Palace playmaker Michael Olise. The midfielder is capable of playing in a variety of roles across midfield or on the wing.\nAnd according to Football Transfers, a £40m approach is being prepped. However, the 21-year-old attacking midfielder will not come cheap, and the Eagles may well hold out for a fee nearer the £50m mark.\nThe former Reading man though has impressed Arteta. And with two goals and eight assists this season, the Gunners boss believes he has what it takes to play at a higher level.\nArsenal also confident of Declan Rice deal – but Kante move fails\nArsenal also remain on the trail of West Ham midfielder Declan Rice. And there is a growing confidence that a £100m deal will soon be struck.\nRice is now also wanted by Newcastle, according to The Sun. However, the Gunners remain strong favourites owing to their almost-certain guarantee of offering Champions League football, together with the player’s desire to stay in the capital.\nAs such, Arteta is ready to push through plans to sign the £150m duo quickly in the window to get their summer business off and running.\nArsenal’s move for the pair comes amid fresh claims that they saw an approach for N’Golo Kante batted away.\nPer Le Parisien, Arsenal made an attempt to prise the Chelsea man in the January window, prior to the capture of Jorginho.\nHis deal at Stamford Bridge is due to expire in a matter of months. And with a new deal yet to be agreed, Arsenal were seemingly looking to pounce.\nHowever, Kante quickly knocked back their advances with the 32-year-old preferring to stay at Chelsea than move to Arsenal. However, a move overseas cannot be discounted if the Blues fail to tie down their man.\nREAD MORE: Arsenal learn hugely appealing asking price for top midfield target as sellers identify replacement\nLIVERPOOL IN HUNT TO SIGN JOAO PALHINHA\nLiverpool are ready to make Fulham’s Joao Palhinha a top target this summer after watching him closely in recent weeks.\nJurgen Klopp is desperate to rebuild his midfield this summer after a difficult season left them facing missing out on the Champions League.\nJude Bellingham, for a long time, has been their No 1 target. But there is now an acceptance at Anfield that the costs involved for the Borussia Dortmund star far exceed what Liverpool are willing to pay.\nAnd with the scale of the Reds’ rebuild now greater than first feared, Liverpool want three or four major new signings this summer.\nTo that end, the £130m required to sign Bellingham will now be put to better use.\nAs a result, a report on Wednesday named the six-man list of midfielders Klopp was keen to snare.\nHowever, Football Insider now reports that Portugal star Palhinha has moved firmly up their wanted list.\nThe 26-year-old moved to Craven Cottage in a bargain £17m move last summer. But he has adapted brilliantly to Premier League football in his first season, spearheading Fulham’s impressive return to the top flight.\nNow it has emerged that Liverpool are watching him closely with regards a summer swoop.\nAny deal though will not come cheap with Fulham likely to demand a £60m fee for the tigerish midfielder.\nLEEDS STICK £40M FEES ON MESLIER, GNONTO\nLeeds United will demand £40m for any clubs looking to poach goalkeeper Illan Meslier this summer.\nThe France Under-21 star has endured a tricky couple of weeks, shipping in 10 goals in his last three games. That includes a woeful 5-1 home thrashing at the hands of Crystal Palace last Sunday.\nHowever, Meslier will likely be in demand this summer as a number of clubs look to poach him from Leeds.\nTo that end, the likes of Tottenham, Chelsea and Barcelona are all reportedly keen.\nOf the trio, a move to Spurs perhaps seems most likely. They are seeking a new No 1 to succeed Hugo Lloris this summer and could target his countryman.\nIndeed, Brentford’s David Raya – valued at £45m – is also under consideration.\nNow, according to Football Insider, Leeds are sticking a £40m price on Meslier’s head. And the club knows they will have no choice but to sell in the event of relegation.\nThe same outlet claims there is a similar fee also put on his Leeds United teammate Wilfried Gnonto.\nThe Italy star has impressed this season after a bargain £5.2m move from FC Zurich. And while he has been regularly benched by new boss Javi Gracia, he remains in high demand after some excellent displays.\nThe 19-year-old forward is reportedly on the radars of a number of Premier League and Serie A sides.\nThe strongest interest will likely come from Juventus, who are huge admirers of the breakout star.\nBut the report claims Leeds will try and dissuade his departure by placing a £40m fee on his head too.",
