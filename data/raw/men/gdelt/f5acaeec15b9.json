And as football fans, I remember going to the final of the men at Wembley (in 2021) and just the atmosphere around the stadium.\n\"England fans love football and we're ready to get behind the team. So I think it's important that we have many celebratory moments together.\"\nThere are hopes a decision on 2031 could be accelerated, with FIFA only this year picking its 2027 hosts despite already lining up countries for the men's event until 2034.\nEngland defender Lucy Bronze hopes their tournaments are given a greater priority within football bodies.\n\"That's what we're trying to change in women's football,\" Bronze told Sky News.\nRead more from Sky News:\nDave Grohl admits to having child 'outside of my marriage'\nPrisoners speak to Sky News after early release\nFour bodies found on Mont Blanc\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\nFew have had a better view of the transformation of the game than Bronze, who started playing in England youth teams 17 years ago and has been part of runs to three World Cup semi-finals and a final in 2023.\nThe Euros showed her how much of a boost a World Cup here could be - although the Americans would be a threat having stepped aside from hosting the 2027 edition.\n\"After winning the Euros, it completely changed the landscape again,\" said the 32-year-old, who is back playing in the Women's Super League after a spell at Barcelona.\n\"I think if we were to hold another tournament, it would be great. Maybe you could hold me to this, but I think it would be the best World Cup.\n\"I think the countries that really buy into women's sports and into women's football, like ourselves and the US, would be the ones who are capable of holding these amazing tournaments and we have these unbelievable stadiums available.\"\nAnd the spread of stadiums in the UK and Ireland would put England in strong contention to host the Women's World Cup having shown through the WSL that the support is growing here.\nChelsea's new French manager Sonia Bompastor is certainly impressed, having previously won Champions League titles as a player and coach with Lyon.\n\"Being here now for almost two months, I can feel the difference weekly between England, France, even Spain,\" she told Sky News, speaking generally about women's football in England ahead of the WSL season starting this weekend.\n\"I think in Europe there is no comparison between England and the other countries. I think England is the example to follow and it's really good.\"",
