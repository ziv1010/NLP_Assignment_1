Stop him and you have a chance.\nThe Belgium international is undeniably a class player but he has lost a yard of pace due to serious injuries. Casemiro must not get caught up the field and must use his wealth of experience to stay in position to deal with the massive threat of De Bruyne.\nIf he gets stranded up the field, with City breaking into space, the end result is unlikely to be that satisfying for United fans. He will need to show immense discipline to play a strict defensive midfield role where he can solely focus on using his positional sense to stop City’s attackers, especially De Bruyne, from picking up the ball in pockets of space.\nDespite the poor performances, Casemiro is a serial winner. He has played so many big games, coming out on top over and over again. Five European Cups, three Club World Cups, three UEFA Super Cups, three La Liga titles, one Copa del Rey and three Spanish Super Cups, to go along with last season’s Carabao Cup, suggests he knows how to get over the line in a final.\nIt will be a tough ask but with his future likely to be away from Old Trafford, it would be quite the final act of his United career to expertly snuff out the danger of City’s assist king and deliver the famous old trophy back to Old Trafford for the first time since 2016.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
