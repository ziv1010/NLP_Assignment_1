  "body_text": "Liverpool reach agreement for Slot to become manager\nThe 45-year-old will success Klopp with a reported deal worth up to £9.4 million\nLiverpool reached an agreement with Feyenoord on Friday for Arne Slot to succeed Jurgen Klopp as manager, British media reported.\nThe Press Association said that a compensation package for the 45-year-old, who had two years left on his contract, has now been agreed.\nThe BBC claimed that the deal is worth up to £9.4 million (10.9 million euros).\nSlot had said Thursday that he was \"confident\" of landing the Anfield job.\n\"I would like to go to Liverpool. Now I'm waiting to see whether the clubs reach an agreement. I'm very confident in that,\" he told reporters.\nSlot moved to Feyenoord in 2021 after impressing in his first managerial role at AZ Alkmaar.\nHe led the Dutch giants to the inaugural Europa Conference League final at the end of his first season, in which they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma.\nSlot then delivered just a second league title in 24 years to De Kuip last season before penning a new three-year deal.\nKlopp will step down at the end of this season after a nine-year reign which brought the Champions League title in 2019 and Premier League trophy a year later.\n\"I like the way his team plays football. If he is the one, I like that he wants it,\" Klopp told reporters on Friday when asked to highlight Slot's qualities.\n\"I don't know him, but some people who know him say he's a good guy. I like that a lot. So good coach, good guy. Looking forward for the club, if he is the solution, if he is the man, I'm more than happy.\n\"It's the best job in the world, best club in the world. Great job, great team, fantastic people. A really interesting job.\"\nFeyenoord are currently second in the Eredivisie table, with PSV Eindhoven nine points clear at the top.\nFailing to win the Dutch title would be a disappointment for Slot, mirroring Klopp's frustration at Liverpool's own faltering title bid.\nLiverpool are in third place in the Premier League, three points behind leaders Arsenal and two adrift of second-placed Manchester City.\nCity have a game in hand on both Arsenal and Liverpool, who look to have blown their chance after defeats against Crystal Palace and Everton.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
