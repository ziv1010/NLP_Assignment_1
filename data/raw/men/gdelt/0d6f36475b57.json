Figures in March showed United's debt has grown to £970 million.\nSheikh Jassim's bid was for full control of United and promised to clear the club's borrowings. The BBC reported that his bid was worth £5 billion, but that further talks this week had broken down.\nQatari Banker Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jaber Al-Thani. - AFPBy contrast, Ratcliffe is reportedly willing to buy a smaller stake to break the impasse over the Glazers' £6 billion asking price.\nFounder of petrochemicals giant Ineos, Ratcliffe is a boyhood United fan and already has a portfolio of sports investments.\nIneos owns French club Nice and Swiss side Lausanne-Sport, as well as leading cycling team Ineos Grenadiers and is a major sponsor of the Mercedes Formula One team.\nUnited's fortunes on the field have also faded under the Glazers' tenure.\nThe Red Devils have not won the Premier League since former manager Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 and last won the Champions League in 2008.\nThey currently sit 10th in the Premier League and have lost their first two Champions League group stage matches for the first time in the club's history.\nFans have also been left frustrated at a lack of investment in United's infrastructure over the past two decades.\nOld Trafford remains the largest club football stadium in England, but is in need of significant redevelopment to keep pace with the facilities offered by their rivals.\nUnited's home was overlooked in favour of Manchester City's Etihad Stadium for the UK and Ireland's successful bid to host Euro 2028.\nReigning Premier League champions City's fortunes have been transformed since a takeover from Sheikh Mansour, a member of Abu Dhabi's ruling family, in 2008.\nIn 2021, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund bought a controlling stake in Newcastle.\nBut the bid by Sheikh Jassim, the son of a former Qatari prime minister, raised concerns over the potential growth of state influence in the Premier League.\nAmnesty International has called on the Premier League to tighten ownership rules to ensure they are \"not an opportunity for more sportswashing\".\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
