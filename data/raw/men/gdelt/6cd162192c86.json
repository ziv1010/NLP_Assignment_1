  "body_text": "Man City vs Bayern Munich: Complete head-to-head record\nBy Euan Burns\nAs modern heavyweights of European football, Manchester City and Bayern Munich have enjoyed some wonderful tussles in recent times.\nCity are still searching for their maiden Champions League crown while Bayern are established six-time winners on the continent.\nThe two don't have a detailed history, given City's relatively late arrival on the top level scene, but the meetings are racking up between the two as both continue to make it through to the latter stages of Europe's premier club competition.\nHere's who has come out on top during their meetings.\nManchester City vs Bayern Munich H2H record\n1. Bayern Munich 2-0 Manchester City - 27 September 2011\nThe first professional meeting between the two sides was a 2011 Champions League group stage match. Jupp Heynckes was the Bayern coach and Roberto Mancini was leading City.\nThe two goals came from Mario Gomez either side of half-time and helped the German side top the group.\n2. Manchester City 2-0 Bayern Munich - 7 December 2011\nSurprisingly in the second meeting between the two sides in that group stage, it was City that ran out as winners with a 2-0 victory at the Etihad. David Silva and Yaya Toure were the goalscorers.\nThe group contained Napoli and Villarreal and it was the Italians who joined Bayern in the next round. City dropped into the Europa League after finishing third.\n3. Manchester City 1-3 Bayern Munich - 2 October 2013\nIn the 2013/14 season, City and Bayern were drawn in the same group once again with the first game in Manchester. This time, Pep Guardiola was in charge of the Bavarians against Manuel Pellegrini.\nFranck Ribery, Thomas Muller and Arjen Robben made it 3-0 to Bayern before Alvaro Negredo grabbed a late consolation. Jerome Boateng was also shown a late red card.\n4. Bayern Munich 2-3 Manchester City - 10 December 2013\nJust like in the previous group stage meeting, City won the return game.\nThis time, Bayern were 2-0 up after 12 minutes thanks to Muller and Mario Gotze, but goals from David Silva, Aleksandar Kolarov and James Milner secured a win for City.\nBoth teams progressed to the next round but it was Bayern who topped the group. Both teams had 15 points after the six games.\n5. Bayern Munich 1-0 Manchester City - 17 September 2014\nThe 2022/23 matches will be the first knockout games between the two sides as the next two meetings were also in the stage. The following season they were in the same group and Guardiola was still at Bayern.\nThe first match was very tight and it was a stoppage-time winner from Boateng that secured the points for Bayern.\n6. Manchester City 3-2 Bayern Munich - 25 November 2014\nSticking to the script laid out in previous seasons, City won the second game of the group stage between the two teams. Mehdi Benatia was shown a red card after just 20 minutes and Sergio Aguero scored the resulting penalty.\nSurprisingly, Xabi Alonso and Robert Lewandowski scored twice before half time and it took until the 85th minute before Aguero was able to score twice more and turn the game around, even though Bayern had ten players for 70 minutes.\nThe win was crucial as City only scraped into the round of 16 with eight points from six games.\n7. Manchester City 3-0 Bayern Munich - 11 April 2023\nThe pair had to wait over eight years to renew their Champions League rivalry, this time at the quarter-final stage.\nThomas Tuchel had just been appointed as Bayern's new head coach, but he could do nothing to prevent his side from slipping to a devastating 3-0 defeat at the Etihad.\nRodri got the ball rolling, scoring a superb goal from outside of the penalty area, before Bernardo Silva and Erling Haaland wrapped up a comprehensive win.\n8. Bayern Munich 1-1 Manchester City - 19 April 2023\nWith it all to do in the second leg, Bayern needed to come out firing at the Allianz Arena.\nBut after Leroy Sane spurned a glorious opportunity, City settled things down and eventually took the lead through Haaland after he missed a first half penalty.\nJoshua Kimmich netted a spot kick of his own with under ten minutes remaining on the night, at least helping Bayern avoid defeat on the night.\nMan City vs Bayern Munich H2H record\n- Man City: 4 wins\n- Bayern Munich: 3 wins\n- Draws: 0",
