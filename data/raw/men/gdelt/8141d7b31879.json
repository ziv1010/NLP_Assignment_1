We lost important players in the summer and it was going to take some time.\n“We didn’t manage to be on our top level in September but now we are a totally different team. We are ready to compete and fight to win the trophy.\n“If you play 10 games against Real Madrid it is difficult but if you go to a final everything is possible in football. It is about the game not the occasion.\n“We’ve had 60 games to prepare ourselves for the game tomorrow. It is clear they have the role as a favourite but we don’t care, we weren’t favourites against Atletico or PSG.\n“If we are brave and ready to show we are not here to see how Real Madrid are going to lift the trophy and we are here to give them a game then we are going to have a chance.”\nJust a boy and his ball. pic.twitter.com/DJapttkQlX\n— Borussia Dortmund (@BlackYellow) May 31, 2024\nThe 41-year-old Terzic also spoke of his respect for opposite number Carlo Ancelotti, who is looking to win his seventh Champions League as player and manager.\n“He is one of the managers who not only made it with one team but made it with different teams in different countries and in two decades he has been successful as a manager,” he said.\n“The way he manages the team and the way the player play for him he needs to be a role model for young coaches. I still think I am a young coach so he’s a role model for me.”",
