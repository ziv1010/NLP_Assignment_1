  "body_text": "Arsenal midfielder Mikel Merino says the team are fully focused on the return leg in Paris after falling 1-0 to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last night.\nThe midfielder acknowledged the slow start in the first leg of the semi-final at the Emirates Stadium but praised the team’s reaction and belief after going behind early in the match.\nMerino started in midfield and played a key role as the Gunners fought hard to respond after Ousmane Dembele’s early strike gave the visitors the lead.\n“It was a tough game,” he reflected. “Every minute counts, and in the first 10-15 minutes, maybe we did not perform at the level we are used to.\n“But I think the team recovered really well from the goal. We showed a lot of character and personality, and we almost dominated the rest of the game.”\nMerino confident Arsenal will respond in the second leg\nMerino was clear in his belief that the tie is far from over, and backed Arsenal to go to Paris and turn things around.\n“We know we have a really good team, a powerful team, and we are really confident that we are going to win the second leg. I think people are optimistic,” he added.\n“We know that what we showed today is just the beginning of what we are. We are really confident, really full of power for the second leg.”\nDespite the narrow loss, the midfielder highlighted the performance as proof that Arsenal are strong enough to be competitive in Europe.\n“I think what we will learn is that we are able to dominate any team, anywhere,” Merino said. “This team wants to be on the ball the whole time – wants to keep you in your box.\n“We proved that we can play against anyone and be the main team on the pitch. Today showed us that we are really capable of performing anywhere. We cannot wait to go to Paris.”\nMerino had a header ruled out for offside after converting Declan Rice’s free-kick, but he stressed the importance of fine margins in top-level football.\n“It was tough, but those are the margins that we manage in these kinds of games,” he said.\n“This is elite football, and a few centimetres can determine your future. So, hopefully in the second leg, those ten centimetres can go to our side.”\nArsenal now turn their attention to Saturday’s clash with Bournemouth as they aim to end the Premier League campaign on a strong note.",
