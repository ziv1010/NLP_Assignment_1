Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nIn that period, only Chelsea have spent more money than United in the Premier League, with Todd Boehly blowing over £1b on new players.\nWhich players has Erik ten Hag signed for Manchester United?\nOf the 16 new faces through the Old Trafford door, Antony is the most expensive, with United forking out around £88.3m to acquire his services from Ajax in September 2022.\nHowever, the Brazilian winger has had a hugely turbulent time with the Red Devils, managing just eight goals and three assists in his first full season in English football.\nIn September 2023, he was granted leave of absence by the club to address allegations of domestic assault made against him by numerous women, including ex-girlfriend Gabriela Cavallin, of which Antony denies.\nAntony’s compatriot Casemiro joined up with him in the north west during the same transfer window, with United electing to pay £70m to sign the midfielder from Real Madrid.\nDespite criticism over the size of the transfer fee for the then 30-year old, the Brazilian enjoyed a stellar year at the base of United’s midfield and had a transformative effect on United’s fortunes.\nHowever, Casemiro’s second year at United has so far failed to lift up to the lofty heights of the first, with the player, who has at times looked sluggish, dangerously exposed by teammates in the middle of the park.\nChristian Eriksen arrived last season as a free agent but his impressive performances have seemingly waned ever since he made his comeback from an ankle sustained in January 2023, whilst Tyrell Malacia has proven a capable understudy to Luke Shaw at left back since he moved from Ajax last summer for around £14.7m.\nWout Weghorst arrived on loan at the start of 2023 but only managed two goals in 26 appearances since swiftly leaving in the summer, whilst Martin Dubravka, Jack Butland and Marcel Sabitzer were also drafted in via the loan market – all of whom have now departed.\nMason Mount was Ten Hag’s first signing this season, with the Chelsea academy graduate swapping blue for red in a £60m deal.\nMore Trending\nBut the 24 year-old has had an underwhelming start at his new club, as has Andre Onana, who has made a series of high profile errors in goal since his £47.2m move from Inter in the summer.\nRasmus Hojlund’s £72m price tag raised eyebrows following his move from Atalanta, with the Dane having to wait until Boxing Day for his first goal in the Premier League.\nAfter a protracted transfer saga, United finally completed a loan move for Moroccan midfielder Sofyan Amrabat on deadline day and have an option to turn the deal into a permanent one should the Fiorentina man impress at Old Trafford.\nTurkish goalkeeper Atlay Bayindir has been bought from Fenerbahce to provide competition for Onana, Jonny Evans has been snapped up on a free following his exit from Leicester, whilst Sergio Reguilon is on a season-long loan from Spurs.\nErik ten Hag signings at Manchester United\n- Antony – £88.3m\n- Casemiro – £70m\n- Lisandro Martinez – £55.3m\n- Tyrell Malacia – £14.7m\n- Wout Weghorst – Loan\n- Martin Dubravka – Loan\n- Christian Eriksen – Free\n- Jack Butland – Loan\n- Marcel Sabitzer – Loan\n- Mason Mount – £60m\n- Rasmus Hojlund – £72m\n- Andre Onana – £47.2m\n- Sofyan Amrabat – Loan\n- Atlay Bayindir – £4.3m\n- Jonny Evans – Free\n- Sergio Reguilon – Loan\nMORE: Paulo Dybala’s bargain release clause alerts Manchester United, Chelsea and Newcastle",
