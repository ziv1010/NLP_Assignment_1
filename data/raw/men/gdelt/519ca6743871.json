Their tally of seven is only slightly more than half that of the two teams who share the second-lowest, one of which is Forest.\nOnly Burnley have had fewer shots and no other team is less efficient with they've had. It really has been a woeful season.\nNew manager Rob Edwards took his Wolves team to former club Aston Villa in his second game in charge. They were defeated in both. It's going to be a long season.\nTickets\nGet Wolverhampton Wanderers tickets at Seat Unique\nThe WV1 Club Hospitality at Wolves offers seats behind the goal and access to the WV1 Lounge two hours before kick-off and one hour post-fixture. Guests enjoy an unlimited two-course self-service grazing menu and half-time refreshments, providing a comfortable, continuous, and great-value matchday experience.\nLike Wolves, Forest have changed manager this season. Indeed, they're on gaffer number three already and, if nothing else, Sean Dyche has them floating above the relegation zone.\nLosing at home to Brighton at the weekend was an unwelcome setback but it was preceded by an unbeaten run stretching to five matches in the Premier League and Europa League, and indeed a three-match winning sequence.\nDyche will surely try to drill that positive perspective into his team as they prepare to take on one of the most beatable teams in Premier League history. Forest can go 13 points clear of the bottom team and that's a decent stepping stone.\nNext up for Forest? A return to Everton for Dyche, whose impact at Goodison Park will have been high on the agenda when he spoke to Evangelos Marinakis about his current role.\nSee also ► These are the cheapest ways to watch the Premier League this season\nWolverhampton Wanderers vs Nottingham Forest: Expected line-ups\nFourFourTwo's prediction\nWolverhampton Wanderers 0-2 Nottingham Forest\nWolves looked beaten as soon as they went a goal down against Villa on Sunday and FourFourTwo predicts that Forest will also get their noses in front.\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses.
