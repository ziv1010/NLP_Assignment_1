  "body_text": "Transfer Gossip: Liverpool in meeting for World Cup winner to replace flop linked with former club; Man City have serious chance of Chelsea transfer\nA Liverpool midfielder has been linked with a return to his former club, while the club have been meeting with the agent of a potential replacement, and elsewhere, Man City are firming up plans to bid for a Chelsea man – all in Wednesday’s transfer gossip.\nWORLD CUP WINNER’S AGENT MEETS LIVERPOOL\nLiverpool have been in physical contact with the agent of Brighton midfielder Alexis Mac Allister, according to a report.\nMac Allister was a member of the Argentina squad that won the World Cup in December. He further enhanced his reputation in the process after already impressing for Brighton.\nThanks to his development, he is now on the radar of bigger clubs. Although Brighton have been above Liverpool in the Premier League this season, a move to Merseyside may still be considered a step up.\nAccording to Football Transfers, Mac Allister’s father, who acts as his agent, was at Anfield to watch Liverpool’s loss to Real Madrid in the Champions League alongside club officials.\nThere is a theory that Liverpool may be looking to sign someone like Mac Allister as well as another target like Chelsea’s Mason Mount.\nHowever, to take the South American, Liverpool might have to pay more than £70million. Brighton have Mac Allister under contract until 2025 with the option of a further year, after all.\nIt is unclear how much Mac Allister’s name was discussed during his father’s visit to Liverpool. But his presence there may not have been a coincidence.\nThe update comes as one of Liverpool’s existing midfielders is being tipped to retrace his steps.\nNaby Keita could leave Liverpool for Leipzig\nAccording to Bild, Naby Keita – who is out of contract at the end of the season – is back on the radar of his former club, RB Leipzig.\nThe Guinea international has been unable to match his Leipzig form in five years at Liverpool. Therefore, he is likely to be let go at the end of the season.\nA return to the Bundesliga has already been suggested. But, as TEAMtalk has already indicated, it may well happen specifically with the club that used to employ him. The German source claims Leipzig would have gladly bid for Keita in January, but Jurgen Klopp did not want to lose him mid-season.\nNow, Liverpool are facing up to the prospect of getting rid of Keita without receiving a transfer fee, since he does not want to renew his deal. It could lead to him having a second spell with Leipzig.\nAlternatively, Keita is on Borussia Dortmund’s list of potential replacements for Jude Bellingham, who is coincidentally one of Liverpool’s dream options for their own midfield.\nBut Bellingham would be more expensive than Mac Allister, for example. There may also be greater competition for his signature.\nTherefore, Liverpool will be weighing up all their options, but it seems an evolution is due – or perhaps overdue.\nMAN CITY HAVE CONCRETE HOPE OF SIGNING CHELSEA STAR\nManchester City are seriously interested in Chelsea full-back Ben Chilwell, it has been claimed.\nChilwell was linked with City last month amid the reigning Premier League champions’ need for a new left-back. They allowed Joao Cancelo to leave on loan for Bayern Munich during the winter.\nCity have held an interest in former Leicester left-back Chilwell before. Now, they are thinking of revive their pursuit – especially after Chelsea signed Marc Cucurella in Chilwell’s position last summer.\nAnd according to Football Insider, City have established Chilwell as a concrete target ahead of next season.\nIt is not yet clear how much they might have to pay in order to sign the England international. His contract with Chelsea is due to last until 2025 as things stand.\nBut a change of scenery might be necessary for Chilwell if he wants to be more than a rotation option. Clearly, he can still attract big clubs.\nChilwell would be an upgrade on Sergio Gomez, the only other natural left-back in Pep Guardiola’s squad. Hence, he could become a more regular starter at the Etihad Stadium, despite City in theory being more competitive than Chelsea at present.\nCity’s interest in Chilwell comes as they are also linked with his Chelsea teammate, midfielder Mateo Kovacic. On the latter front, though, Chelsea are keen to explore a contract extension.\nIt remains to be seen if City might have better luck in their pursuit of Chilwell at least.\nASTON VILLA AMONG THREE CHASING CHAMPIONSHIP DEFENDER\nAston Villa are among the contenders for the signing of Hull City defender Jacob Greaves, per the Daily Mail.\nGreaves is also of interest to Nottingham Forest and Brentford, according to the report. Brentford, coincidentally, already made a signing from Hull in the summer when they took Keane Lewis-Potter.\nNow, defender Greaves is the latest Hull player to be in demand. If he is to step up to the Premier League, he might cost any of his suitors around £7m.\nAble to play as a left-back as well, the homegrown option appeals to several top-flight sides.\nThe 22-year-old is under contract in East Yorkshire until 2026. Although, the Tigers can extend his deal by another 12 months should they wish.\nThe Championship side are bracing themselves for interest in him this summer, though.",
