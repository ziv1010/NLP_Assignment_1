  "body_text": "The UEFA Champions League (UCL) enters its penultimate stage, where the supposed best four teams in Europe slug it out for a chance to win the most coveted trophy in club football. These teams have scaled every hurdle and challenge put before them, and now they must face one another. It is time for teams to go beyond just brilliance and reach for grit, hunger, and concentration as the season grinds towards an excruciating end.\nArsenal demolished ragged Real Madrid in the quarter-final and will face Paris Saint-Germain, which narrowly edged past Aston Villa. Barcelona overcame Borussia Dortmund and set up a mouthwatering clash against Inter Milan, which looked brilliant against Bayern Munich.\nBetween Arsenal and PSG, there certainly will be a team that has never won the UCL in the final. Either Barcelona or Inter will also have an opportunity to add to their previous continental triumphs.\nSmall margins of quality or madness, and tactical twists are expected to shape the outcomes of the two semi-final ties.\nAdvertisement\nBARCELONA VS INTER MILAN\nHansi Flick’s Barcelona are a free-scoring team with 37 UCL goals this season. The German coach has moulded the side with a fluid passing style reminiscent of Pep Guardiola’s legendary tiki-taka side, and, in 17-year-old Lamine Yamal, he has a prodigy that can impact a match in an instant.\nWhile technically gifted Pedri and Frenkie de Jong are expected to dictate midfield, the attack could perhaps be the biggest issue, as despite the presence of Raphinha, the current UCL’s highest goalscorer, Robert Lewandowski’s absence will be felt.\nAdvertisement\nAlejandro Balde’s continued absence in defence has seen the team concede more goals recently, and Inter Milan would seek to exploit these flaws.\nThe Nerrazzurri are goal-shy, with 19 UCL goals so far, but have mastered the art of scoring when it matters most. While coach Simeone Inzaghi’s well-recognised ability to tweak tactics cannot be overemphasised, the loss of injured Marcus Thuram has contributed to a four-match winless run for the Serie A side. The French striker, set to face a late fitness test, has forged an understanding with captain Lautaro Martinez in attack, and it remains to be seen how Inter would improve this department at this crucial stage against perhaps the best team in Europe this season.\nFans would not mind a repeat of the epic 2010 Jose Mourinho vs Guardiola battle, but whoever makes the fewest mistakes while taking the scarce chances would advance. Evenly poised.\nARSENAL VS PSG\nAdvertisement\nIt remains a shock to the football world that Arsenal are in the last four of the UCL. The Gunners have, however, deserved their spot, especially with the emphatic way Mikel Arteta’s side dispatched Real Madrid, UCL reigning champions, in the last round.\nDeclan Rice continues to demonstrate his dexterity in the team, the defence remains one of the best in Europe, and Bukayo Saka is the leader who drives the attack forward. Despite these, Arsenal are also perennial bottlers in Europe – they are the side with the most games (199) without winning the UCL – and Arteta’s side is known to fizzle out when it matters most.\nIn PSG, they face a young and well-oiled Luis Enrique team that has forged an understanding with lesser-known players following Kylian Mbappe’s departure in the summer.\nThey are also driven by the sheer individual brilliance of the duo of winter signing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, whose driving central runs cut the opposition open, and Ousmane Dembélé’s excellent wing wizardry.\nAdvertisement\nBoth sides have similar playing styles and player attributes, and an entertaining battle is expected in both legs. The team that bosses the midfield and bullies the defence better should win the tie, with PSG predicted to advance to their second-ever UCL final.\nFIRST LEG\nTuesday, April 29 – Arsenal vs Paris Saint-Germain\nWednesday, April 30 – Barcelona vs Inter Milan\nAdvertisement\nSECOND LEG\nTuesday, May 6 – Inter Milan vs Barcelona\nWednesday, May 7 – Paris Saint-Germain vs Arsenal\nAdvertisement",
