His current contract expires in 12 months’ time and there are no plans to extend the deal, with Vincent Kompany eager to bring in Joao Palhinha from Fulham.\nIt’s added that the German’s exit from the Bundesliga giants is ‘getting closer’ and that, if he’s to leave, he ‘only wants to join’ one of Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, Real Madrid or Barcelona.\n🚨🔴 As revealed and now confirmed again: Joshua #Kimmich could leave FC Bayern already this summer!\n▫️Kimmich, captain and regular starter, can leave the club with a suitable offer.

While we don’t necessarily expect it to happen, we wouldn’t dismiss it out of hand either, particularly after this update from one of the most trusted sources in German football.\nEOTK Close-up with John Welsh: ‘a local lad who lived his dream’ and Slot’s LFC predictions",
