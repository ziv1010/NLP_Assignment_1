With Liverpool firmly on the decline as a club in 2010, slumping to seventh in the Premier League, Carragher earned himself a surprise recall to the national team for the 2010 World Cup under new manager Fabio Capello.\nVIDEO How Arne Slot Just Fixed Liverpool's Biggest Problem Against Milan\nSpeaking on SkyBet's speaking on Stick to Football, Carragher explained the circumstances surrounding his return.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\n“When [Fabio] Capello first came in, he was always constantly on to Stevie [Gerrard] because the number of centre-backs wasn’t sorted. Stevie was always raving about him. Some of the players just thought, “What the f*** is he doing here?”\n\"Ledley King was in the tournament and someone else was injured on the last game of the weekend, so they asked me, but Liverpool hadn’t qualified for the Champions League. I just thought, ‘My age, would we get into the Champions League? F*** it, I’ll go play in the World Cup’. I did play a couple of games in the World Cup. For me, it wasn’t to go back and play for England. It was to go and play for Capello and the whole Milan thing.\n\"Capello for me was like a God. But I was disappointed because I was used to Rafa [Benitez’s] structure. He was the [Jose] Mourinho before Mourinho, wasn’t he? Everywhere he went he won and got the job done.”\nMore Liverpool stories\nREVEALED: The football clubs with the biggest social media followings, with English sides DWARFED by European rivals\nLiverpool star Trent Alexander-Arnold to stay with huge caveat involving team-mate, warns ex Reds star\nLiverpool receives £30m windfall - thanks to Taylor Swift\nJames Ridge is a freelance journalist based in the UK.
