During Saturday's 4-2 win away to Osasuna which keeps Real top of the table by six points going into the international break, it's alleged that Vinicius Jr, who scored twice, was abused once again.\nLos Blancos say that referee Juan Martinez Munuera \"voluntarily and deliberately\" ignored the alleged insults, omitting them from his match report on purpose. Real's players are said to have told Munuera about the abuse during the game, while the Brazil international was booked for dissent in the first half and will now serve a one-match ban for an accumulation of yellow cards.\nIn a statement, Real condemned the 41-year-old referee, saying: \"After the serious insults uttered, once again, against our player Vinicius Junior, in this case during the last league match played by our team at El Sadar (Osasuna home stadium), Real Madrid CF communicates the following.\n\"Our club has filed a complaint with the Disciplinary Committee of the Royal Spanish Football Federation against the match referee Juan Martínez Munuera, as a result of the negligent drafting of the referee's report. This referee voluntarily and deliberately omitted the insults and humiliating shouts repeatedly directed towards our player Vinicius Junior, despite being warned insistently by our players at the same time they were occurring.\n\"In addition, Real Madrid has also filed a complaint with this federative body in relation to the aforementioned insults and humiliating shouts, and has forwarded them to the State Commission against Violence, Racism, Xenophobia and Intolerance in the Sports, so that those who uttered them are identified and punished.\"\nLast week, Real complained about alleged racist chanting by Barcelona and Atletico Madrid supporters ahead of their Champions League round-of-16 clashes with Napoli and Inter Milan respectively. A video on social media appeared to show Atletico fans chanting a racial slur about the 23-year-old forward, while Real say that Barcelona supporters did similar.\nThe Mirror\nThe Brazilian, 23, has been the subject of racism on several occasions since his £36million move to the Bernabeu in 2018, all while becoming one of the best wingers in Europe.
