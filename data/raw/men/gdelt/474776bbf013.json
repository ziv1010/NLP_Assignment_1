There are other options for coach Xabi Alonso but Boniface remains key in this away tie at Anfield this night.\nWhile Leverkusen‘s recent domestic form has been relatively underwhelming as they have recorded two consecutive draws away to Werder Bremen and at home to VfB Stuttgart, their European results are solid.\nThey are unbeaten after three games and are hoping to improve on their most recent outing, a 1-1 draw away at Brest. For this clash, Alonso will be glad to be able to select a team from a near complete pool of available players, with Victor Boniface expected to lead the line once again after missing the Brest encounter. Amine Adli will miss out, Jeanuël Belocian and Nordi Mukiele are all set to miss out. Martin Terrier should return after sitting out the Stuttgart game. Alongside Boniface, the likes of Florian Wirtz and Jonas Hofmann will be hoping to cause the Reds’ backline plenty of problems.\nLiverpool are however one of the in-form teams in Europe at the moment. Arne Slot’s side are one of only two teams in Europe’s premier club competition to have won every one of their games in the tournament so far (alongside Aston Villa), most recently a 1-0 victory over RB Leipzig. On the domestic front, Liverpool are as fine as fettle as they sit at the top of the Premier League with just one defeat this season across all competitions. They may be without Diogo Jota, Federico Chiesa, Harvey Elliott and ex-Leipzig centre-back Ibrahima Konaté for this fixture but are still stacked with talent all across the pitch with the likes of Mohamed Salah, Virgil Van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Cody Gakpo all at Slot’s disposal. Bundesliga alumni Dominik Szoboszlai, Wataru Endō and Ryan Gravenberch could all also feature.\nUCL (Today)\nPSV v Girona\nBratislava v Di’Zagreb\nBologna v Monaco\nDortmund v S’ Graz\nCeltic v RB Leipzig\nLille v Juventus\nLiverpool v Leverkusen\nR’Madrid v AC Milan\nSporting v Man City",
