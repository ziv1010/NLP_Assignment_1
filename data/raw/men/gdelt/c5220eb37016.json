It is Djurgarden v Chelsea in the Conference League semi-final first leg, an 8pm kick-off as well.\nAnyway, BBC Sport has pointed out the MONEY involved.\nHow much money certain clubs could make in the Champions League next season and more importantly, how much they would miss out on if they don’t qualify!\nBasically, it could cost the likes of Manchester United, Spurs and Chelsea as much as £100m if they don’t qualify for the Champions League next season (Chelsea can only do it through the Premier League, though they could ensure Europa League by winning the Conference League this season).\nThe new format of the Champions League that was introduced this season, has seriously increased the money clubs can make. Factors such as eight guaranteed league matches instead of six now, plus increased prize money.\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport:\n“A good season in the Champions League can be worth far in excess of £100m. By the time you combine gate receipts, sponsor bonuses and the prize money available, the numbers involved are eye-watering.”\nAs Newcastle United fans, you would have to be crazy if you weren’t desperate for the likes of Manchester United, Spurs and Chelsea to miss out on the Champions League riches.\nThe fact is, there is still a massive financial chasm between the likes of Newcastle United and the usual six suspects, so every season where the likes of Manchester United, Spurs and Chelsea miss out is a bonus, especially if at the same time Newcastle United do qualify.\nThe signs are promising and this has been the recent Champions League qualifying for these clubs:\nManchester United – If they miss out again and don’t qualify by winning the Europa League, it will mean only one season in the Champions League in four years for Man U.\nChelsea – If they don’t qualify via the Premier League, it will mean a third season in a row where Chelsea haven’t had Champions League football.\nSpurs – If they don’t win the Europa League this season, then it will mean that Spurs next season will have no Champions League football for the fifth time in six seasons.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
