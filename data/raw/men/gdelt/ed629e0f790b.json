I can only think of one word. Turgid.\nSurely there could be a filter system for there to avoid matches like this? A bit like the FA Cup qualifying rounds.\nThey (England) play Senegal next week. At least we get to see Gana and Ndiaye.\n23 Posted 07/06/2025 at 19:16:27\nHis left ear sticks out at a weird angle, much more acute — or is it obtuse? I always get those mixed up.\nAnyway, I don't trust him.\n24 Posted 07/06/2025 at 19:26:01\n25 Posted 07/06/2025 at 19:28:34\nSkinny legs, an obtuse ear and a comb over. Tuchel is probably an alien.\n26 Posted 07/06/2025 at 19:32:47\nDoes he believe that Dean Henderson (2 caps) will be good enough to dislodge Jordan (75 caps) by playing in the Europa League?\nCan't imagine previous world class England goalkeepers such as Banks and Shilton being treated in such an ignorant manner.\nThankfully I only endured the last 35 minutesof today's match. Evidently another dismal managerial appointment.\n27 Posted 07/06/2025 at 19:59:57\n28 Posted 07/06/2025 at 20:05:10\nI was never fussy on the hurling games — those sticks get in the way! Give me a Gaelic football game and I'll watch it all day long, although I'm glad Seamus turned his back on that and joined us instead.\n29 Posted 07/06/2025 at 20:20:07\nGollum lookalike even said his goalkeepers need to play in Europe – not thinking that none of his selected keepers are in Europe.\nComplete dope and awful performance.\n30 Posted 07/06/2025 at 20:41:15\nVenue: Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field, Hartford, Connecticut.\nNo Cenk Tosun for Turkey (Shame!) but this kid Alladin is playing No 20 — Oguz Aydin, winger at Fenerbahçe — linked with Everton!\n31 Posted 07/06/2025 at 20:46:41\nA brilliant finish by Jack McGlynn.\n32 Posted 07/06/2025 at 21:01:50\n33 Posted 07/06/2025 at 21:05:48\n34 Posted 07/06/2025 at 21:07:30\n35 Posted 07/06/2025 at 21:10:18\nUh-oh, now 1-2, Turkey score again! Aydin likes to get forward, his shot deflected, I think, kneading to the goal.\n36 Posted 09/06/2025 at 20:18:18\n37 Posted 09/06/2025 at 20:29:51\nWhen De Bruyne had to high-jump over the advertising hoardings, chasing to keep the ball in play, the replay shows a sly push in the back from the Wales defender.\n38 Posted 09/06/2025 at 20:39:10\n39 Posted 09/06/2025 at 20:45:46\nBut having ex-kopite Bellamy as manager really puts me off. Someone who attacked a teammate with a golf club, left a youth coaching job due to bullying allegations, was cautioned by police for common assault on a female, and has been charged or convicted for numerous other offences.\nA horrible person.\n40 Posted 09/06/2025 at 20:48:46\nLove to see Wales make a fist of this.\n41 Posted 09/06/2025 at 20:57:16\n42 Posted 09/06/2025 at 20:59:34\nMy abiding memory of Craig Bellamy was when he refused to shake hands with John Terry in support of his teammate Wayne Bridge.\n43 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:00:37\n44 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:02:08\n45 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:18:41\n46 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:21:09\n47 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:21:32\nFlat track bullies reeling.\nWho'd have thought that?\nCome on the Taffs!\n48 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:24:29\n49 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:30:09\n50 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:30:23\n51 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:32:20\n52 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:34:33\n53 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:34:38\n54 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:37:13\nDe Bruyne makes it 4-3.\n55 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:52:58\nI wasn't expecting that after 35 minutes.\n56 Posted 09/06/2025 at 21:53:21\nDe Bruyne still has it. And that Duko is someone who terrifies defenders.\nI always wonder, what language do the Belgium players speak to each other? Dutch or French? Sorry, random thought.\n57 Posted 09/06/2025 at 22:33:20\nDesperately poor officiating all night, I thought.\n58 Posted 09/06/2025 at 22:39:54\nIt makes you wonder why VAR isn't used for other decisions rather than just offsides, goals and penalties.\nI still think Belgium overall deserved the win.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
