  "body_text": "Wolves have been here before. The challenge of coping without Pedro Neto is nothing new for head coach Gary O’Neil.\nBut this time around, as Wolves prepare for Neto’s second extended absence of the season, and another caused by a hamstring injury, the task facing them is even harder.\nBecause this time around, the alternatives are badly limited too, with Hwang Hee-chan still several weeks away from the end of his own hamstring-related lay-off, Matheus Cunha only just feeling his way back from a similar issue and Jean-Ricner Bellegarde recovering from a knee problem.\nAdvertisement\nSo for ninth-placed Wolves, the loss of Neto is a major issue if they want to make a serious push for Europe over the run-in.\nFor Neto, though, another hamstring tear creates its own issues personal to him.\nWill he be fit in time to cement his place in Portugal’s squad for the European Championship squad in June and July, having already missed the 2022 World Cup because of injury?\nWill he be able to manage a couple more appearances in Wolves colours to say a proper farewell, if this summer is indeed the one when he makes his expected move to a club operating at Champions League level?\nAnd will he have time to break a club Premier League record that at various points since the season began last August he has appeared certain to smash?\nNeto is already the joint-holder of the record for most assists by a Wolves player in a single Premier League season, tied on nine with Adama Traore from the 2019-20 season.\nBefore this latest injury, it seemed just a matter of time before he moved to double figures and left Traore in his wake. Now, it will be a matter of whether he can get back for the final few games and whether he can use his time on the pitch in those fixtures to set up at least one more goal.\nNeto has always had talent but this season he has become a different animal.\n“I’ve improved a lot in terms of how I work in terms of maturity,” said Neto to the 1 PARA 1 podcast in Portugal. “The decision-making is better. The execution is also better. Starting to play more on the right side now helped me a lot.\n“I started to be more decisive in terms of that thing I lacked, which was the final pass and decision-making. I’ve improved a lot in terms of maturity in that aspect.”\nWolves team-mates will testify to that. Before this season began, Neto’s most recent Premier League assist was in May 2022, when he set up a goal for Leander Dendoncker against Manchester City. But throughout 2023-24, when fit, he has been a regular creator of goals — so much so that The Athletic took the liberty of preparing a look back at his assists during it, in preparation for when that record was broken.\nAdvertisement\nSo, please don’t blame us for tempting fate. Instead, look back with whimsical pleasure at a season of assists that is already a triumph, however it ends.\nAugust 26, for Sasa Kalajdzic; Everton 0-1 Wolves\nThere was an element of the American football ‘Hail Mary’ pass about Neto’s opening assist of the season, which settled a stinker of a game in visitors Wolves’ favour and brought O’Neil his first win as their coach following his appointment just four days before the opening game.\nYet the delivery was still pinpoint and offered a taste of things to come as Neto checked back onto his left foot on the right flank and swung a hopeful but dangerous cross towards the far post.\nOnly Kalajdzic will know what part of his anatomy connected with it in front of the goal but it was enough to find the bottom corner and get Wolves’ season up and running.\nSeptember 3, for Hwang Hee-chan and Matheus Cunha; Crystal Palace 3-2 Wolves\nOne game, two fantastic crosses. Two goals for Wolves but no points.\nBefore Neto got into his marauding stride a few weeks into the season, his assists were all about quality of delivery — more David Beckham-esque than the Gareth Bale-type efforts that would come later.\nHis assists at Selhurst Park were carbon copies of each other — high, looping, left-wing crosses that found the heads of his team-mates for glancing efforts — although one was from a dead ball and the other from open play.\nThe first, a free kick for Hwang, helped make it 1-1 and gave Wolves hope of a result but the second for Cunha was purely a consolation, coming in the dying seconds when Palace were 3-1 ahead.\nSeptember 16, for Hwang; Wolves 1-3 Liverpool\nThis one counted for nothing in terms of points, either, but strangely, the dominant first-half display Wolves produced at home against Liverpool in September provided inspiration and belief that they could mix it with the best sides in the division.\nAdvertisement\nAnd the highlight of that 45-minute performance, which ended with Wolves leading 1-0 at the break, was the first clear sign of the season that Neto’s old confidence was back.\nWhen he picked up the ball 30 yards from goal with three Liverpool players around him, he did not look likely to conjure a chance. Yet a combination of acceleration and fabulous footwork took him away from all three and allowed him to cross to the far post for Hwang to score:\nOctober 8, for Hwang; Wolves 1-1 Aston Villa\nIf there was any doubt about Neto finding his attacking mojo, they were dispelled in this local derby, with Pau Torres the unlucky recipient of a ruthless demonstration.\nThe Villa defender was favourite to shepherd Neto into a non-dangerous area when he picked the ball up tight on the right touchline, but he switched on the afterburners, left Torres standing, and pulled the ball back from the byline for Hwang to tap home with his first right-footed assist of the season.\nOctober 21, for Cunha; Bournemouth 1-2 Wolves\nWe’ve covered long-distance crosses and talked about majestic dribbling but, on this day at the Vitality Stadium, Neto added passing precision to the conversation.\nTommy Doyle started the move that allowed Wolves to equalise with a fine pass that took the home side’s midfield out of the game.\nBut it was Neto who added the sublime final ball, taking two defenders out of the game with his left foot…\n…and allowing Cunha to sweep home a fine finish and set up a big win.\nOctober 28, for Mario Lemina; Wolves 2-2 Newcastle\nBy this point, Neto was in rangy, powerful, dribbling form, leaving defenders in his wake with ease.\nIt was one such devastating run in the second half of this game that led to him pulling his hamstring while in full flight. But before that he found time to deliver his latest assist from a corner, picking out the head of Lemina with a perfect outswinging left-footer…\n…which the midfielder redirected to draw his side level at 1-1.\nFebruary 4, for Cunha; Chelsea 2-4 Wolves\nA lengthy injury lay-off interrupted the flow of assists and Neto had switched roles by the time his next one arrived, with the winger playing as a centre-forward in the absence of Hwang due to Asian Cup duty with South Korea.\nAdvertisement\nBut it was from a familiar area of the pitch that he came up with his first post-injury assist, drifting out to the right and leaving Chelsea’s Thiago Silva for dead.\nNeto burst into the box…\n…and the precision of his pull-back gave Cunha a relatively simple finish.\nFebruary 17, for Joao Gomes; Tottenham 1-2 Wolves\nIf one assist sums up Neto’s season better than any other it was the one at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium that helped Wolves pull off their most recent giant-killing.\nThe acceleration from deep inside his own half to the edge of the penalty area underlined the athleticism, stamina and pace that Neto possesses, and the quality of the pull-back for Gomes on the edge of the box spoke to the clarity of mind in the final third that has taken him to the next level this season.\nIt remains to be seen if Neto will have the opportunity to break Wolves’ assists record for a single Premier League season but, whatever happens, the body of creative work he has amassed over the past eight months deserves to be savoured.\nWolves will miss his vision and incision during the run-in to the end of the season if, as expected, he does move on and if fans have to be content with what might have been, then at least the memories are sweet.",
