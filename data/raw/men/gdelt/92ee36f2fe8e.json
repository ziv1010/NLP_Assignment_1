  "body_text": "Arsenal need a new centre-forward this summer, but just how far should they be prepared to go for the perfect No 9?\nArsenal and Liverpool are among the clubs casting admiring glances at Alexander Isak ahead of the summer transfer window. Prising him away from Newcastle United would be extremely difficult, especially if Eddie Howe’s team are able to reach the Champions League.\nAdvertisement\nCurrent speculation suggests Isak, 25, could command a fee of up to £150million ($194.4m). Such a deal would surely eat up almost the entirety of Arsenal’s budget — if they were even capable of reaching such a figure.\nIt presents an intriguing hypothetical: is Isak so good that Arsenal should consider going all-in on him as the final piece in the jigsaw? Or is that kind of outlay better spent on several players to strengthen multiple areas of the squad?\nThree of The Athletic’s Arsenal writers share their views…\nJordan Campbell: Is it possible for your head to be repeating that Arsenal require a change of profile in two or three positions, but for your gut to be yelling that Isak could be so transformative he overrides everything?\nThat’s where I’m at, which is a convoluted way of admitting I’m conflicted.\nArsenal have had two summers billed as ‘finishing touch’ windows. The fact we are still debating a striker shows that, despite their alterations in other departments, they have not found it.\nIn the absence of a forward who can score 20-plus goals, logic follows that ‘it’ is simply an elite striker. Arsenal definitely need at least one given Gabriel Jesus’ ACL injury leaves only Kai Havertz in that position.\nBut an upgrade on Gabriel Martinelli — or a player close to Bukayo Saka’s level who can rotate on both wings — feels overdue, while Thomas Partey and Jorginho’s contract situations make a No 6 feel imperative too.\nIt would be a risk to neglect those issues completely, but Isak can pretty much do it all. He is as good as guaranteed to score plenty of goals and is a player who can drop in to link play, dribble, run in behind, score off both feet and with his head.\nThe compound interest of adding a player with such a varied skill set could potentially unlock other elements of the team’s attack, but would Isak alone fix those problems or does it require a wider recalibration?\nAdvertisement\nHavertz, Mikel Merino and Declan Rice could share the responsibility of the left eight role, but Arsenal do not create enough at times and, Martin Odegaard aside, Arteta has not recruited many small-space players to overcome the issue with low blocks.\nBlowing the budget on Isak is one thing but Arsenal would need to front-load their investment and place all their PSR (Profit & Sustainability rules) eggs for the next couple of years into one player.\nThe obvious upside is that he could score 30 goals a season for five years, but the risk is that he suffers a serious injury. Then what?\nArteta’s outlook has been that it is best to have as wide a base of goalscorers as possible, but it has not proven to be enough versus Erling Haaland or Mohamed Salah.\nIsak would represent a change of strategy, a gamble that could leave other areas of the team vulnerable, but it does feel like Arsenal have arrived at the point where they need to prioritise a killer who possesses that aura of inevitability. Isak is as close to that as it gets.\nArt de Roché: If the opportunity to pursue Isak presents itself, I would be minded to go all in. In my opinion, he could have a similarly transformative impact on the team as Rice did in 2023, and Jesus in 2022.\nHis efficiency in front of goal is what first catches the eye, but he has so much more to his game. Standing at 6ft3in (190.5cm) and still having the agility and technical ability that he does, both when dribbling and striking a ball is exceptional.\nI have written about this before, but those attributes and the style he plays with make him reminiscent of the profile of striker Arsene Wenger would recruit in his first decade at Arsenal. Thierry Henry is the prime example, but Emmanuel Adebayor, Kanu and Robin van Persie all fit the bill of tall, quick and technical strikers who could do much more than just score goals too.\nAdvertisement\nIsak possessing all of this is what made him the most intriguing as option to me in January 2022, despite him scoring just four La Liga goals at that point in the season:\nThere is also something to be said about Isak’s personality. It’s often on display when he celebrates, whether that be with a shrug or a screw of the face and jab of his thumb. He plays football like he is having fun and Arsenal are in desperate need of that in attacking areas.\nWhat would the solution for other areas of the squad be if most of the budget is used on Isak?\nWell, moving Myles Lewis-Skelly back into midfield with Rice feels like a natural point of evolution. Truly utilising the transfer market by unearthing young talent as opposed to always buying ready-made players in their mid-twenties could also help fill the squad after potential sales in other areas.\nUltimately, in my opinion, it would be better to have Isak as another crown jewel rather than more complementary pieces to a puzzle that always seems to need an extra piece. Even if some of that comes down to a feeling as opposed to just goals, that is what makes Isak so appealing.\nJames McNicholas: Full disclosure on this one: I’m torn.\nOn the one hand, I do believe that paying a premium for Premier League-proven talent is an effective strategy. The signing of Declan Rice is a great example. Arsenal probably paid an inflated fee in the summer of 2023, but the fact that he was such a well-known quantity significantly reduced the risk.\nOf all the centre-forwards linked to Arsenal, Isak is the one that feels closest to a sure thing. He’s settled in England, proven in the Premier League, and the right age to make an instant impact on the team. As with Rice, there’s also the risk that not signing could see him end up with a rival, such as Liverpool — or that he could propel Newcastle into contention for major honours.\nAdvertisement\nSigning Isak would be a huge statement. But would it be enough? Arsenal are likely to need players in several positions this summer. A new striker would improve their attack, but ideally would be complemented by other additions, including a creative player.\nRice was a centrepiece signing — but in the same summer, he was joined by Kai Havertz, Jurrien Timber, and David Raya. It’s rare that a single addition can make the difference alone.\nAt £100m, a deal for Isak would leave a little wiggle room for other business. Perhaps even at £125million there’d be some flexibility. At £150million, plus a huge salary, there’s no doubt that Arsenal would be all-in on one player. When it’s a player of Isak’s calibre, that’s tempting… but on balance, it might be too big a risk.\nRather than pay top price for a player whose valuation has already skyrocketed, perhaps Arsenal should focus on finding a forward who’s about to explode.\nAmy Lawrence: Regrettably, this question just makes me think about age. Why? Because with the audacity of youth I am sure I would have said, hell yes, go all out for an Isak. Bring it on.\nBut life’s experience teaches us to be more cautious, to pause and take a breath and analyse the details and probabilities. Boring, I know. It wasn’t always like this.\nIf money was no object then there is no debate here. But Arsenal do not operate in that reality, so spreading the funds around various players who can all improve the team makes sense.\nIt is not as if the club only have one missing piece of the jigsaw — even if a dynamic, prolific, powerhouse of a striker has been the most obvious omission for some time. The highest calibre forward available within the overall summer plan is a must.\nBut there also needs an injection of thrill on the left wing, a controller in midfield to replace the likely departures of Thomas Partey and Jorginho, and a goalkeeper to cover for and challenge David Raya. Isak is great, but the price is not. A next-best striker who has a bit more growth in front of him is worth consideration if it means adding four classy players across the squad.\n(Top photo: Isak scoring against Arsenal in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final in January; Glyn Kirk/AFP via Getty Images)",
