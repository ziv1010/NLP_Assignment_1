On one side: Paris Saint-Germain, packed with youthful flair and chasing a historic treble. On the other: Inter Milan, stacked with experience, desperate to salvage their season.\nFootball fans, punters, and online betting communities are all asking the same thing: who’s going to lift the trophy in Munich? You can bet on PSG to Win the Trophy @1.61 or bet on Inter to Win the Trophy @2.30 with BetKing — the choice is yours.\nYouth vs Experience: The Main Plot\nPSG’s starting XI is among the youngest in the tournament, averaging just over 23 years. These “kids” already took out Liverpool, Arsenal, and Aston Villa on their way to the final. Meanwhile, Inter fielded the oldest lineup in the competition in their quarterfinal against Bayern. Their biggest weapon will be their superior experience.\nPSG’s journey has been brutal. They faced Arsenal, Atletico, Bayern, and Man City just to get through the group stage. But a mid-season reset led by Luis Enrique saw them turn things around, thanks in part to star man Ousmane Dembélé – The bet of the Day to score in the final (@2.85).\nInter, on the other hand, started strong defensively — conceding just 1 goal in 8 group stage games before optimizing for goals over a secure defense in the knockout rounds, scoring 15 and conceding 10. If they win, it’ll be redemption for their domestic collapse.\nPlayers to Watch + BetKing’s Bet Builder Picks\n- Ousmane Dembélé – 33 goals, 13 assists, and a serious Ballon d’Or shout if he bags a UCL medal.\n- ⚡ Khvicha Kvaratskhelia – facing Inter again after years in Serie A with Napoli. Back him for 2+ shots + 1 assist with BetKing @6.00.\n- Lautaro Martínez – top scorer in Inter’s UCL history and captain of chaos. Bet on him to score + 2+ shots on target @5.25.\n- Alessandro Bastoni – elite defender with 6 assists this season. The glue in Inter’s backline can also score important goals, as he showed against Barcelona in the semifinal.\nKey Tactical Battle: Hakimi vs Dumfries\nExpect fireworks down both flanks. PSG’s Achraf Hakimi (8 goals, 14 assists) and Inter’s Denzel Dumfries (11 goals, 6 assists) are redefining what it means to be a modern full-back.\nOne or both right backs could decide this final, so Nuno Mendes and Federico Dimarco will have to be at their best down that right flank.\nKey Stats Before You Book a Bet\nIt’s important to note that:\n- This is the 5th UCL final hosted in Munich — and each previous winner lifted the trophy for the first time. A good omen for PSG?\n- PSG have scored first in 7 of their last 9 UCL matches. If you think that trend is going to continue, you can back them to Score First @1.80\n- Both Teams to Score @1.71 is a smart punt, given the combined firepower on show tonight.\nPlace your bets now to enjoy amazing UCL freebies! here: https://m.betking.com/promotions/bet-and-get/bet-and-get-405\nWhether you’re here for the storylines, the stats, or the shot at turning your ₦1,000 betting stake into millions, this final is one you don’t want to miss.\nRead the full preview for more betting tips here: https://m.betking.com/blog/betting-tips/psg-vs-inter-milan-who-ll-win-the-2025-ucl-final/",
