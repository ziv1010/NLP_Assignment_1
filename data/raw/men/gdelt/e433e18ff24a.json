  "body_text": "Audio By Carbonatix\nEnzo Maresca has left his role as Chelsea manager with the club sitting fifth in the Premier League.\nThe Italian, 45, departs less than six months after winning the Club World Cupat the end of his first season at Stamford Bridge.\n\"With key objectives still to play for across four competitions including qualification for Champions League football, Enzo and the club believe a change gives the team the best chance of getting the season back on track,\" Chelsea said.\nThe Blues have won just one of their past seven league matches and took only six points from six games in December to fall 15 points behind leaders Arsenal.\nBut results are only a small part of the story.\nMaresca, who had a contract due to run to 2029, delighted key figures at Stamford Bridge - including sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, and influential co-owner Behdad Eghbali - by steering Chelsea to a top-four finish and winning the Uefa Conference League and Club World Cup last year.\nYet success soon turned to sourness in his relationship with the hierarchy.\nMaresca stunned even members of his own staff when - after beating Everton 2-0 for Chelsea's solitary Premier League win in December - he said \"many people\" had made it his \"worst 48 hours\" since joining the club.\nThose comments came without any warning to club staff or senior management, who would have preferred any discussions to remain private.\nBut friction had been brewing in the months before that.\nMaresca had hoped to raise his profile following the Blues' successes through opportunities outside the club. He was planning to publish a book before being blocked, and spoke at Il Festival dello Sport - an event in Italy organised by La Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper - without the club's permission.\nHe also made public that he disagreed with the club not signing a central defender after Levi Colwill injured his anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season. The club's hierarchy explained that doing so could prompt academy prospect Josh Acheampong to request a transfer, which ultimately led Maresca to back down.\nThe former Leicester manager has also switched agents - from the Wasserman agency to Jorge Mendes - and has been talked of as a potential successor to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, which Maresca has dismissed.\nIn addition, he has increasingly avoided wearing club tracksuits - opting instead for his own clothing.\nFollowing his last game with Chelsea - a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth on 30 December - assistant manager Willy Caballero said Maresca felt too unwell to do his post-match media duties, but it is understood his absence was more due to his disillusionment at the club.\nAnd it was noticeable that when Chelseaposted a 52-second video on social media on New Year's Eve summarising their year, there was no trace of Maresca.\nThe Italian, for his part, believed the pressure on him was unfair given what he felt were difficult working conditions, and that a line had been crossed in terms of attempts to influence his team selection.\nWhile he was not angry about overseeing a young squad, he felt supporters' expectations needed to be managed regarding what was achievable - especially given key injuries to Colwill and attacker Cole Palmer.\nChelsea initially intended to assess his position at the end of the season if results improved, but Maresca's unhappiness was a factor in them parting ways sooner.\nThe Blues' next match is against second-placed Manchester City on Sunday - starting a difficult month that also includes games against Arsenal and Napoli.\nLatest Stories\n-\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n4 minutes -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n49 minutes -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n2 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n2 hours -\nCocoa crisis, galamsey complicity and election credibility to dominate this Saturday’s Newsfile\n3 hours -\nINTERPOL deletes Red Notice for Ofori-Atta as extradition process continues — OSP confirms\n3 hours -\nMasterMinds resources positions itself as key player in skills development and workforce training\n4 hours -\nINTERPOL has deleted Ofori-Atta’s Red Notice – Lawyers\n5 hours -\nSteven Spielberg donates $25,000 to James Van Der Beek’s $2m GoFundMe\n5 hours -\nSix possible effects of Trump’s climate policy change\n5 hours -\nBooming Indicators, Dying Rivers: Ghana under Chronic Environmental Poisoning\n5 hours -\nWorld’s rules-based order ‘no longer exists’, Germany’s Merz warns\n6 hours -\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n6 hours -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n6 hours -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n6 hours",
