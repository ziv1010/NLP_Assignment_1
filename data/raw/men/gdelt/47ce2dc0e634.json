I felt that later in the game we would be stronger and I felt Cole’s performance was magnificent.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘Not just his quality, his pressing, his running for the team. We need to look after him. He’s had so many games over a long period of time.\n‘We need to look after him and I think the way that he’s managed himself in the last two weeks has been magnificent and hopefully we can now see the best of him now that he’s fully fit. We need to see him absolutely relish nights like this on a big occasion.’\nAsked if it was a scary prospect for Palmer to produce such quality after such little game time of late, Rosenior said: ‘Yes, scary good.\n‘I don’t like to talk about individuals. I felt [it wasn’t] just Cole [who played well] when he came on. I thought Jamie Gittens came on and I asked him to play a left wing-back role which he was magnificent.\n‘Ale Garnacho came on to help the team. Obviously, Joao Pedro is top. Actually, the tactical change, I thought Andrey Santos actually had a very good game but we needed to go for the win.\n‘When Enzo [Fernandez] moved back into the No.6 role, he started to really dominate and control the game with Moi [Caicedo]. Again, so many pleasing individual performances but I think the most pleasing aspect was the collective mentality of the group to have a positive reaction to a difficult first half.’\nRosenior has now won five of his first six games in charge of Chelsea and is thrilled with how his players have responded to what he is asking of them.\nMore Trending\n‘I think to get through in this competition is the most important thing, so I’m delighted to do it,’ he said. ‘In this way, in terms of our season, in terms of my time on the pitch with the players, that’s going to help us so much.\n‘I had no time. It’s not an excuse, it’s a fact. And I’m asking the players, and I’m so proud of them, even in the first half, I’m asking them to press in a completely different way that they’ve never done before and hardly had any practice at.\n‘So that time over the next few weeks will help us get better and improve, but we still need to win games in this moment.’\nMORE: Is Premier League dominance starting to ruin the Champions League?\nMORE: Antonio Conte singles out ‘truly important’ Chelsea star after Champions League exit\nMORE: Cole Palmer injury update with Chelsea star’s mystery condition explained",
