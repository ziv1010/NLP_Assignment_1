  "body_text": "We’ve got our sights set on winning the UEFA Women’s Champions League this season, says Lia Walti.\nSpeaking in her pre-Bayern Munich press conference on Tuesday, our midfielder spoke about our ambitions in the competition and how excited we are to compete with the best teams in Europe.\n“Bayern is one of the best teams, currently dominating the German league and I think that’s exactly who we want to be measured against,” she said. “I’m really looking forward to seeing where we’re at as a team.\n“I think the Champions League is a competition we all want to win. It’s the biggest stage, again you can compete against the best players in the world, against the best teams. I do think and believe we belong there, and I do think we have the quality to be competing to one day win the trophy with the team we have.\n“I think why not this season, why not have a good start tomorrow against Bayern Munich, arguably the toughest opponent in our group? I’m looking forward to it, I’m really excited for it and glad for the team that we’re back on the big stage.”\nWe’ll be looking to show a positive response to the weekend’s 0-0 draw at home to Everton in the Barclays Women’s Super League, when we were unable to get the goals to show for our dominant performance at Emirates Stadium.\n“I think after games like that, you just want to play again and show that you can do it better,” Lia said. “I think we all know that we didn’t show up on that day the way we wanted but there is a new opportunity tomorrow.\n“Football is a quick business so things change in every moment, and I think we can turn it around tomorrow. Full focus on that and hopefully we get some chances in the net tomorrow.”\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
