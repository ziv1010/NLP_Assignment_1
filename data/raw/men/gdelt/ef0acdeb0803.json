Taawoun posted their fourth win in five outings and improved to 12 points in solo first place.\nThe defeat will prove crucial in the Bahrainis’ hopes of making it to the ensuing knockout stage as they are now tied on points in the standings with Air Force SC of Iraq, who defeated Altyn Asyr FC of Turkmenistan 2-0 in yesterday’s other divisional clash at Ashgabat Stadium in the Turkmenistan capital.\nThe win was the third for Air Force in five games and it put them in third place, behind Khaldiya only on goal difference. Altyn Asyr suffered their fifth loss and stayed winless with zero points.\nThe group is now headed for a crunch final matchday on Wednesday next week, which will decide the teams that advance to the round of 16, which will be held next year.\nKhaldiya host Altyn Asyr at home, while Air Force welcome Taawoun to Al Madina International Stadium in Baghdad.\nThe ACL Two is the second-tier club competition of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). Rebranded from the AFC Cup, it is one level below the AFC Champions League Elite and one above the AFC Challenge League.\nThere are 32 clubs from across Asia competing this season. They have been divided into eight groups for this opening phase, with only the top two from each advancing.\nTaawoun opened the scoring last night in the 31st minute when Flavio Medeiros da Silva passed to an unmarked Adam, who headed home from close range.\nAl Aswad then equalised in the 39th minute on a quick counter-attack. An Oussama Bellatreche effort in a one-on-one was saved by Taawoun goalkeeper Mailson Tenorio dos Santos, but the ball rebounded directly into Al Aswad’s path, and he sent it into an empty net.\nAfter the interval, Khaldiya threatened and Igor Torres da Silva hit the crossbar with a shot from an acute angle.\nBut Taawoun regained the advantage in the 55th minute with a sloppy goal by Mandash. The Khaldiya back line were unable to clear a pass headed towards the face of goal, and Mandash was did enough to send an under-hit effort home.\nKhaldiya tried to salvage a point and a shot from close range by Gleison Wilson da Silva Moreira was blocked by dos Santos.\npatrick@gdnmedia.bh\nTop stories for today:\nMystery shoe thief ‘caught’\nCouncil urges crackdown on illegal tattoo parlours\nHundreds of families flock to Mara’ee 2024",
