My legs were shaking.\"\nGetafe did not include on-loan Manchester United striker Mason Greenwood in its squad, after his arrival on Friday.\nThe forward had been suspended by the Red Devils since January 2022 after facing allegations of abuse although prosecutors subsequently dropped the charges.\n\"Obviously we can only talk about football, about other issues, I think,that the people and the relevant systems did what they had to do, and everybody knows how it ended -without a condemnatory sentence,\"said Getafe coach Jose Bordalas.\n\"Therefore, (he's) a free person, a footballer of the highest level, who comes to Getafe with enormous hope. We are going to help him to recover his best level.\"\nMayoral started up front for the visitor and, looking to keep his place in the side, he quickly pounced to put the visitor ahead after a heavy Fran Garcia pass.\nHowever, Joselu netted his first Madrid goal from close range just after the break when Getafe could not clear Luka Modric's teasing cross.\nThe Spain international started in place of Vinicius, who suffered a hamstring injury and is set to miss over a month.\n\"It's a shame to go behind on the scoreboard but the team worked and we came out with the mentality that we would turn it around,\" said Joselu.\n'Surprising' goals\nMadrid turned the screw with Toni Kroos and Dani Carvajal hitting the woodwork, while Getafe goalkeeper Soria made a string of good saves.\nHowever, the goalkeeper's only mistake ended up costing his team,when he could only parry Lucas Vazquez's long-range drive and Bellingham reacted quickest to turn the loose ball home.\nThe former Borussia Dortmund man has now scored five of Madrid's eight La Liga goals this season, helping to fill the void left by Ballon d'Or holder Karim Benzema's departure.\nBellingham joins a small group of players to have netted in each of their first four Liga matches, including Madrid's all-time record scorer Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\"His quality isn't surprising anybody, but the number of goals he's got is surprising,\" said Ancelotti,who deploys Bellingham behind the forwards in a No 10 role.\n\"He's very professional, and he has a lot of examples for professionalism in this squad. He is learning very quickly.\"\nEarlier, Takefusa Kubo hit a brace to help Real Sociedad earn its first win of the season, beating promoted side Granada 5-3 in San Sebastian.\nImanol Alguacil's side drew its opening three league games in a frustrating domestic start, as the club looks forward to its Champions League return after a decade away from Europe's top club competition.\nAFP\nMost Popular\n- Guangdong beats Macao 2-0 in first leg of soccer cup\n- Para teams set to leave mark on ice\n- US skier Johnson wins women's downhill as Vonn crashes at Milan-Cortina Games\n- Su Yiming clinches first medal at Milano-Cortina\n- Over 300 athletes from 35 countries and regions kick off Asian championships in Tianjin\n- Legacy of Beijing 2022 lives on as Milan welcomes Games",
