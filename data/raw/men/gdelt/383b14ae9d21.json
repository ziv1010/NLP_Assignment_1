But I like what I saw the other day when he came on [against Man City].’\nIn an interview with Sky Sports ahead of kick-off, Arteta was asked about his team selection and said: ‘Nine changes is a lot.\nMore Trending\n‘A few [players are] starting for the first time for us and deserve to have minutes.\n‘Freedom and expression is a big part of our game.
