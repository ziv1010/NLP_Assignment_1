  "body_text": "Many will deem Arsenal’s 2022-23 season to be a failure given they missed out on the Premier League title after a late collapse. However, that assessment would be totally wrong.\nMikel Arteta’s side originally set out to secure Champions League football but a superb run of form saw them in a title race with Manchester City.\nThe Gunners remained at the summit of the table for the majority of the campaign but a slump in form in April allowed City to overtake them in the standings.\nPep Guardiola’s side firmly took control of the title race after they ran out 4-1 winners against Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium.\nArsenal ultimately failed to break their Premier League title drought, finishing five points behind City.\nBut they still managed to secure Champions League football for next term, which is a huge achievement in itself considering they last played in the elite competition since the 2016-17 season.\nMikel Arteta’s side will now be aiming for another title challenge as they have been very ambitious in the English transfer window so far. They have signed Kai Havertz in a £65 million deal while Declan Rice’s move to the Emirates Stadium is also imminent.\nArsenal’s pre-season friendlies\nThe North Londoners will start their pre-season campaign by flying to Germany, taking on Nurnberg at the Max-Morlock-Stadion on July 13.\nThey will subsequently be in action against MLS All-Stars at Audi Field on July 20 before a mouthwatering fixture with Manchester United at MetLife Stadium, New York.\nThe Gunners will conclude their US tour after meeting Barcelona on July 26 at the SoFi Stadium.\nMeanwhile, their final pre-season fixture will be against Monaco at the Emirates Stadium on August 2.\n- July 13: Nurnberg vs Arsenal – Max-Morlock-Stadion, Nuremburg\n- July 20: MLS All-Stars vs Arsenal – Audi Field, Washington\n- July 22: Arsenal v Manchester United – MetLife Stadium, New York\n- July 26: Arsenal vs Barcelona – SoFi Stadium, Inglewood\n- August 2: Arsenal vs Monaco – Emirates Stadium, London",
