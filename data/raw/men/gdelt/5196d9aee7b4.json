His eyes appear to be bloodshot in an orange-yellow pigment.\nImmediately, fans flocked to the comments section, questioning whether they should be worried about Jordan’s health. Some X users thought his eyes were a sign of liver failure.\n“That boy’s liver is cooked,” one blunt individual wrote, while another questioned: “Does he have Jaundice?”\nAnother concerned fan wrote: “Why the h** MJ out here with JAUNDICE tho? Eyes lookin’ like a Vampire In Brooklyn.”\n“Yellow eyes.. man might have some problems,” a fourth added.\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, jaundice is a condition that causes the whites of the eyes and the skin to turn yellow.\n“It’s caused by a buildup of bilirubin, a yellow chemical in hemoglobin that’s produced when the body breaks down red blood cells,” the Cleveland Clinic report states.\nJaundice occurs when the liver can’t efficiently process red blood cells or if the liver is “overloaded or damaged,” per a Mount Sinai report.\nThough jaundice can occur at any age, the condition poses serious health risks in older individuals. Jaundice can be a sign of problems with the liver, pancreas, or gall bladder, which could signal liver disease or a severe infection.\n“Yellow eyes should not be ignored because they are a sign of something more going on. There is literally more than meets the eye,” Dr Val Phua, an ophthalmologist at Eagle Eye Centre Singapore, told VICE in 2020 after the release of Jordan’s The Last Dance documentary on Netflix.\n“Leaving eye conditions untreated includes compromise in vision and even blindness.\n“His eyes are slightly discoloured which may point to jaundice, but there seems to also be a slightly raised lesion on the eye, which can point to something local causing the discolouration like a pinguecula,” said Dr Phua.\nAccording to the American Optometric Association, pinguecula is an abnormal growth of tissue on the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white of the eye.\nJordan has not spoken publicly about the color of his eyes nor any recent health issues.\nThe Independent has contacted Jordan’s representative for comment.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments",
