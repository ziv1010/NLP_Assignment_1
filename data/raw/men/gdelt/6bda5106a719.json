  "body_text": "The father and agent of Tottenham defender Emerson Royal has sensationally claimed that his son is good enough to play for Real Madrid and is likely to seek a transfer this summer.\nEmerson has endured a decidedly mixed career in north London since joining from Barcelona in 2021, with the defender often struggling defensively and providing little in the way of an attacking threat.\nAxed boss Antonio Conte decided to spend £40million on Pedro Porro to rectify the problem, although ironically Emerson enjoyed his best form for Spurs just after the Spaniard was signed.\nHe kept Porro out of the starting XI initially and even earned a call-up to the Brazil national team earlier this year, though his progress was curtailed by injury.\nNow the 24-year-old’s father and agent, Emerson Zulu, claims the full-back has outgrown Tottenham and deserves a move to a European giant – like Champions League holders Real Madrid.\n‘There is a great possibility that Emerson Royal will leave Tottenham,’ the defender’s father told the Charla podcast.\n‘We want this because we believe it’s time for him to take a bigger leap and go to a team that fights for titles.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘It can be in the Premier League or outside of it, but it has to be a giant.\n‘I think that Real Madrid is the football that best fits with the style of Royal.’\nInterim head coach Cristian Stellini was full of praise for Emerson prior to his injury, saying: ‘If he continues to play like this, I think it’s compulsory for Brazil to recall him. I hope for him that that can happen.’\nMore Trending\nOn why Emerson took so long to settle at Tottenham, the Italian coach continued: ‘We have different cultures in Europe and South America. Emerson needed time to understand the difference in the culture of football.\n‘But at the same time, he has to be himself. He has to show who he is. Sometimes this type of player loses confidence if he doesn’t feel love around him.\n‘We don’t have to stop to give him this, but let him understand the difference in the type of football. When his pace and his intensity is really high, he can enjoy. When he thinks too much, he’s not the same player. So we have to follow this aspect, to feel Emerson every time being involved in the game.’\nMORE: Cristian Stellini defends Tottenham players and blames 6-1 mauling on switch to back four\nMORE: Julian Nagelsmann ‘very tempted’ to accept Tottenham job after snubbing Chelsea\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
