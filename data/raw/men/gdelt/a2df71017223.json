They are currently on track to achieving qualification as they third fourth in the Premier League table.\nWe revealed back in early December that United’s top three midfield targets are Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton.\nThe trio still top the shortlist, but luring any of them from their respective clubs has proved impossible this month.\nThe likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro (who’ll leave at the season’s end), and Manuel Ugarte will instead be entrusted with pulling the strings in midfield for the remainder of the campaign.\nMan Utd latest: De Zerbi sack puts Red Devils on alert / Hojlund update\nMeanwhile, reports from France suggest that Marseille manager Roberto de Zerbi is in ‘serious danger’ of being sacked after his side were eliminated from the Champions League on Wednesday.\nMy colleague, Fraser Fletcher, has reported previously that United are admirers of De Zerbi, and the ex-Brighton man would jump at the chance to move to Old Trafford if it arises.\nIn other news, we have revealed that United remain confident that loanee Rasmus Hojlund will join Napoli permanently.\nUnder the terms of Hojlund’s loan move, the transfer will become permanent for £38million (€44m / $52m) provided Napoli qualify for next season’s Champions League.\nThat scenario is no longer guaranteed, but sources at United insist there is no sense of alarm.\nGet the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.",
