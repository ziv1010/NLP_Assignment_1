I’m here to help the team, to get some trophies, to play in Europe and win everything.\n“I’m a player who likes to press and to give everything, so I think it’s the right choice to come here to continue like I did at my former club.”\nBalikwisha, who could make his debut in this weekend’s Old Firm derby against Rangers, added: “I need to be ready because it’s the most important game for the fans and for the club.\n“If I play in the game, I will give my best to help the team win.”\nElsewhere, Chelsea have agreed a fee with Manchester United for the signing of Argentina winger Alejandro Garnacho.\nThe PA news agency understands Chelsea will pay a £40 million (€46 million) fixed fee for the 21-year-old, with United retaining a 10 per cent sell-on fee clause.\nThe deal will represent United’s fourth-largest sale after the transfers of Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria, and is the largest fee received for a graduate from the club’s academy.\nGarnacho will follow Marcus Rashford to become the second member of United’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ of unwanted players to secure a move away from Old Trafford, with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia still working away from Ruben Amorim’s first-team squad.\nChelsea had initially offered a fee of £25 million (€29 million) for a player who had scored 26 goals in 144 games for United, but who fell out of favour with Amorim towards the end of last season and was told he could leave the club after being left out of their final Premier League game against Aston Villa.\nGarnacho had made pointed remarks to the media after being kept on the bench until the 71st minute of United’s 1-0 Europa League final loss to Tottenham, with his brother Roberto using social media to complain about his situation.\nChelsea have already signed Jamie Gittens, Liam Delap, Joao Pedro and Estevao Willian in a revamp of their attack this summer, and Garnacho is likely to compete with Gittens on the left wing.\nThe deal for Garnacho comes as Christopher Nkunku closes in on a move to AC Milan in a deal understood to be worth around £36 million (€42 million) to Chelsea.",
