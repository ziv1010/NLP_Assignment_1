We trust in Fraser so we are happy to play with him in the squad and also we say to Hugo 'see you soon'. He needs a good recovery, maybe between five and seven weeks to be back with us.\"\nForster, who signed from Southampton on a free transfer last year, has played just four times for Spurs so far and has made only one Premier League appearance, in the 2-2 draw with Brentford on December 26.\nLloris, 36, retired from international football following the recent World Cup in Qatar.\nStellini confirmed Conte had returned.\n\"Antonio is back,\" he said. \"This morning he was on the pitch with us. He has to take it easy for a bit but we were so happy to meet him again. He spent time hugging everyone.\n\"We didn't speak about what he would do in the next match but he's back and we are happy for that and we have time to arrive to the game ready also with Antonio.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
