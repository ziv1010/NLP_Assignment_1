  "body_text": "When the news first broke of Brazilian wonderkid Estevao signing a pre-agreement to join Chelsea, there was an array of reactions from the Blues' supporters. This was a result of the whopping £29m initial fee for a player many fans had never heard of in a time when the club's then position and results were far from expectations. However, for football fans in Brazil, his name was anything but unknown.\nTo rise through the ranks of Brazilian football you have to be more than just talented. Afterall, Brazilian footballing skill is more synonymous to the identity of the country than anywhere else in the world.\nEstevao, while immensely talented, was fiercely motivated to prove why he deserved to rise to the pinnacle of football as just a teenager. And he seems to be doing a pretty good job at that.\nToday, his name is spoken in excitement by Chelsea supporters, far from the sentiment that once followed his signing. In his two debut friendly appearances at Stamford Bridge versus AC Milan and Bayer Leverkusen, he displayed just why fans should support his development. And he followed that up with a bright cameo against Crystal Palace and a Man of the Match display against West Ham United, in which he became the youngster player in club history to assist in the Premier League.\nEstevao's rise in Brazil and move to Chelsea\nIn the country known for beautiful football, Estevao had already made a name for himself and by the age of 10, even Nike had taken notice, where Estevao signed the youngest Brazilian contract ever. His electrifying display of flair and goals dazzled fans as they travelled to watch the youth star play, even at such a young age. While he is not a fan of the nickname, the term “Messinho” or little Messi became a common term of endearment for him.\nOnce he joined Palmeiras from childhood club Cruzeiro, he flew through the ranks as he proved his level was far above U17 or U20. By the age of 16 he helped Palmeiras win the top division and solidified his place amongst the senior team. But in a country where so many players are developed, what proved that he was even a standout amongst the special?\nThe evidence can be seen in awards and recognition. After completing his first full senior season in the Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A, at age 17, he was given the award of best breakthrough player as well as best striker. His breakthrough even surpassed Neymar, one of the greatest teenage rises in football history, as Estevao created more Serie A G/A (25) than his iconic predecessor (17) by the end of his 17-year-old season.\nFinally, on the greatest stage in the Club World Cup semi-final against his future club, Estevao stepped up to the occasion and scored a wondergoal to tie the game. And while Chelsea went on to win the match, it was perhaps the perfect poetic moment to display his talent to his future home and say goodbye to his old one.\nExpectations for his first season in Chelsea colours\nTwo primary questions remain; What impact will Estevao have during his first season with the Blues and what should the fans expect?\nWhile his talent is undeniable, the limiting factor will be his adjustment to the physicality and tempo of the Premier League. But for what we have seen in the first two games, he is doing a pretty solid job adjusting to the English game.\nEstevao is likely to begin his Chelsea career from primarily a substitute and support role. Playing football at a massive club like this comes with harsh criticism and can quickly crush the confidence of young players if not properly managed. While the Brazilian will be given the license to impact the game, an ease into the starting XI keeps his confidence and, subsequently, his development protected.\nEstevao might have started the season on the bench, but we believe his quality, combined with the vast amount of matches, means that he will get his fair share of chances. Enzo Maresca has proved that he will give minutes to young players in big matches, such as Josh Acheampong, but not without limitations and the time to be shielded from overexposure.\nWhile to many who follow the youngster, there is a sense of vast confidence in him having a successful season, the question is, what does that look like?\nLet us speak first about the beginning of his career. As with Chelsea in recent years, youth is not always quantifiable in numbers, though we believe he will accumulate them, but by the improvement throughout the season. For Estevao to be successful early, he will need to show flashes of brilliance and work selflessly with his teammates and off the ball to prove he is cut for the top level.\nThere is no doubt this will include flashy dribbles and incisive passes that few in the world would attempt. The only negative to be seen early in his career will be consistency as it is expected for him to make mistakes while conditioning himself to a new environment. We saw that in his big misses against West Ham and Crystal Palace.\nNext it is about seeing him grow into his role, by Boxing Day he should look comfortable in his new team. He will be expected to start Champions League, cup, and Premier League matches occasionally while helping Cole Palmer in the creative aspects of build-up.\nBy the final match day he will be competing with Neto for every minute and pushing for a permanent home in the starting XI. Yes, these are massive expectations for an 18-year-old leaving the comfort of his homeland for the first time but he is a supreme talent and he will show the world what his fellow countrymen already know.\nRemember the name, Estevao.",
