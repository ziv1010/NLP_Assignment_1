Thus, the group stages no longer boast the dreariness of yesteryear. There's been an exuberance to the opening phase in recent times, and that's set to continue in 2023.\nThree Premier League teams are in Europa League action with Brighton aiming to secure their first continental points. Liverpool and West Ham, meanwhile, are aiming to take full control of their respective groups.\nHere are 90min's predictions for the upcoming Europa League Matchday 2 fixtures.\nEuropa League predictions: Group stage Matchday 2\nEarly kick-offs\nWest Ham and Brighton are the Premier League representatives in Thursday's early kick-offs and both teams are flying overseas on Matchday 2.\nThe Hammers have a tricky away tie in Freiburg following their opening win at home to TSC Backa Topola, with Christian Streich's pragmatic style somewhat resembling David Moyes'. This is bound to be a cagey affair with the spoils being shared.\nAs for Brighton, they really need to get some points on the board if they're to progress out of Group B. The Seagulls were beaten by AEK Athens on Matchday 1 and they'll be visiting a raucous Velodrome in Marseille on Thursday evening. The hostile environment will ensure it's a challenge, but this isn't a Marseille side to fear and Roberto De Zerbi's men could claim a historic away win.\nRangers are also in action away at Aris Limassol after parting ways with Michael Beale. Finalists in 2022, the Scottish side will fancy securing back-to-back wins in Group C after beating Real Betis on Matchday 1.\nThere are a few other interesting ties to keep an eye on in the early kick-offs, particularly in Group D as Atalanta visit Sporting CP. While Gian Piero Gasperini's side are no longer the swashbuckling outfit of their imperious apex, their match-up with Sporting should produce plenty of goals with Ruben Amorim's men enjoying an excellent start to the season.\nAEK Athens will fancy their chances of beating a dysfunctional Ajax side in the Greek capital, while Betis should get back on track at home to Sparta Prague.\nLate kick-offs\nLiverpool are in action at Anfield on Thursday night as they play host to Belgian side Union Saint-Gilloise. While the Pro League leaders certainly shouldn't be underestimated, the Reds will have the bit between their teeth after Saturday's injustice and the visitors could feel their wrath.\nToulouse are likely to match Liverpool's win in Group E and move into second place behind the Reds. The French side host LASK on Matchday 2.\nJose Mourinho's Roma are in action against the lowly Servette. The Giallorossi secured a big three points in Serie A at the weekend and while the hosts are unlikely to dazzle on Thursday, they'll surely get the job done against the side that sits eighth in the Swiss Super League.\nBundesliga high-flyers Bayer Leverkusen have a tricky away fixture in Molde in Group H. Xabi Alonso's side will be expected to triumph in Norway, but they may have some difficulties in doing so. This could be a very entertaining contest with goals arriving at both ends.\nVillarreal's clash against Rennes is well worth keeping an eye on, too. The Spaniards need three points after their Matchday 1 defeat at Panathinaikos, but the unbeaten Ligue 1 outfit will fancy their chances of securing a big away win.",
