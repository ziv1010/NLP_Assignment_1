  "body_text": "The transition from Sweden’s Elfsborg to Celtic has been nothing short of a whirlwind for defender Gus Lagerbielke. As Carl Starfelt made his way to Celta Vigo, Lagerbielke emerged as his replacement. The journey so far has been a blend of soaring highs and testing lows.\nLagerbielke’s Celtic tale began with a bang, savouring the euphoria of a Glasgow Derby victory. However, the tides turned swiftly as his Champions League debut was marred by a red card, an early lesson in the harsh realities of European football. On Saturday’s win against Kilmarnock, the Swede didn’t make the bench.\nIn a recent interview with Fotbollskanalen, Lagerbielke opened up about his Celtic journey. When asked about the reason behind his absence from the squad, Lagerbielke responded, “I do not know. There have been many matches that I have had to play a lot. I think it’s about rotation and that we are a lot of centre-backs competing and that he wants to see everyone. I’ve had to play a lot and feel that it’s gone well, and that’s the most important thing.”\nThe probe continued, with questions veering towards Brendan Rodgers’ decision to exclude him from the squad, to which he stated, “Yes, you might think so, but I am very happy with my first time at Celtic and I think it has gone very well. So it’s not something I’ve thought about or worried about.”\nMissing the Kilmarnock clash raised some eyebrows. However, the return of Cameron Carter-Vickers from injury has bolstered Celtic’s defence. He is by far the most experienced and best centre-back at the club.\nLagerbielke’s early days in Celtic green have showcased a player of promise, albeit with rough edges awaiting refinement. With the Ibrox victory under his belt and the January departure of Nat Phillips to Liverpool more than likely at this point, Lagerbielke has a golden chance to cement his place in Celtic’s defensive line-up throughout the season.",
