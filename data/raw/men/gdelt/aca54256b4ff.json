  "body_text": "Enzo Maresca’s Chelsea has had the occasional flash of promise.\nBut it’s not enough, as the Blues are 9th in the Premier League and 11th in the Champions League. So, naturally, doubts remain. Can his long-term plan turn Chelsea into top-four regulars? More importantly, can he bring trophies back to Stamford Bridge?\nRight this second, the board is still not set on sacking him immediately, but patience has limits. Poor results could quickly change everything. Chelsea’s hierarchy has never been one to wait things out, and under the current ownership, the club is still stuck in a cycle of big visions followed by quick resets.\nThese 3 options could replace Enzo Maresca at Chelsea\nInsiders say the decision makers are already looking at backup options if Maresca’s project stalls. The January 2026 window has been mentioned and a few names keep coming up here and there: Andoni Iraola, Marco Silva, or Xavi Hernández. Each a different type of remedy.\nSo it all boils down to direction. Do Chelsea want evolution or a revolution?\nAndoni Iraola\nOf Spain’s new generation of coaches, Andoni Iraola is the one who plays smart, high-intensity football. A former Athletic Club right-back, he made his name at Rayo Vallecano, where his pressing game and quick transitions had the team punching above their weight. His Rayo sides were tight without the ball, quick on the break and full of intensity.\nSince he became the head coach at Bournemouth in June 2023 (until the end of the 2025–26 season), he has adjusted incredibly well to the Premier League. After a tough start, he guided the team to their highest-ever points total in the top flight and got a contract extension until 2025–26.\nHis footballing philosophy, namely aggressive pressing, attacking full-backs and rapid and fluid combinations, would align well, stylistically and fundamentally, and strategically, to Chelsea’s squad with youth and athleticism.\nPlayers such as Cole Palmer or Mykhailo Mudryk would benefit greatly from a style and philosophy centered on occupying space and playing with intent and a goal.\nBut the question is experience. Managing Bournemouth is one thing, managing Chelsea with all its pressure and expectation is another. Still, Iraola’s rise, tactical acumen and ability to build teams are the most interesting long-term options out there, the kind who could grow with Chelsea’s project.\nMarco Silva\nIf Chelsea’s bosses start looking for a more seasoned option to take the reins, Marco Silva probably fits the bill. The Portuguese manager has done a pretty impressive job of turning Fulham into a decent, well-rounded team with a clear sense of who they are and how to go about things.\nHis teams are disciplined but not boring to watch — they can pick their moments to be patient and build up a good attack, but also suddenly switch to a quicker pace when needed.\nMarco Silva has got a deep understanding of the Premier League and has managed a string of English clubs, including Hull City, Watford, Everton and Fulham (where his contract ends next year), so he knows exactly what to expect from the British media and the gruelling pace of English football. That sort of experience would be super valuable at a club like Chelsea where everyone is always watching.\nEveryone seems to rate him as a top communicator and man-manager too ; his players like him because he’s clear and level-headed. While he might not be the most glamorous or big‑name manager out there, his teams are rarely a total shambles, which is something Chelsea could really do with after years of chaos and change.\nXavi Hernández\nThen there is Xavi Hernández , the name that would actually shake everything up at Chelsea. He would be a complete reset, a bold statement of intent.\nThe legendary former Barcelona player has constructed a coaching philosophy built upon the same tenets that created his own football identity as a player: total control, precise passing and a game based on intelligence and structure.\nHe trusts young players, values technical quality and wants his teams to dominate the ball — all things that fit the kind of identity Chelsea are trying to build.\nXavi is a free agent and he has expressed his desire to coach in the Premier League before.\nIf he did come in, his style, possession-based, sharp and youth-focused, would fit Chelsea’s vision of appointing a manager grounded in the Pep Guardiola philosophy.\nIf the board still believes in the current model — young players, long-term planning and modern football — then Iraola or Silva would be logical, steady choices. But if they want another big statement, a full reset with a star name, then Xavi Hernández would be something entirely different — a bold and philosophical new start.",
