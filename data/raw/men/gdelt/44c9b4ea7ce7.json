Diogo Dalot remains the only defender not to fail to feature in a match due to a physical setback.\nRaphael Varane has already confirmed that he’ll leave the club in the next few days once his contract expires.\nCombine this with the fact that the likes of Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire are all facing an uncertain future at Old Trafford and it makes sense why United are on the hunt for defensive reinforcements.\nThe Red Devils have been linked to a number of players including Jarrad Branthwaite, Marc Guehi, Edmond Tapsoba, Leny Yoro, Jean-Clair Todibo and Ronald Araujo, just to mention a few names.\nAnother star thought to be on United’s radar is Bremer. A previous report covered by The Peoples Person related that Erik ten Hag’s side are prepared to fork out as much as €50 million to tempt Juventus into selling their prized central defender.\nIt was further stated that United are ready to increase Bremer’s salary to €10 million a year.\nThe Brazilian’s stock continues to rise and is at an all-time high after he helped Juventus pick up the Coppa Italia as they beat Atalanta.\nThe Serie A club’s sporting director Giuntoli was asked (via La Gazzetta Dello Sport) whether Bremer would be sacrificed in the summer, with the likes of United circling around him.\nHe said, “Bremer, Vlahovic and Cambiaso are untouchable, the others can be reasoned with. These are assessments that will be up to the new coach given that Allegri’s adventure is over.”\nGiuntoli explained that those players would be allowed to leave if they expressed a desire to move in search of pastures anew, similar to what happened with Matthijs de Ligt.\nThe Juve chief went on to remark that he believes Bremer wants to stay in Tutrin to play Champions League football and fight for the biggest trophies. He added to this effect that only a fee in the region of 100 million euros would convince them to part ways with the 27-year-old.\n“Not for the 60 million of the clause, a hundred would be needed. I am convinced that he will stay in Turin”\n“Juve will play the Champions League and the Club World Cup, what would he do at United?”\nThis term, Bremer has helped Juve keep 15 clean sheets. He averages an impressive pass accuracy of 86% and four long balls per 90. He also wins 5.3 duels and 1.6 tackles per match. He’s evidently a combative operator who can bring something different at United. However, at Giuntoli’s quoted price, the 20-time English champions are unlikely to go anywhere near that deal.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
