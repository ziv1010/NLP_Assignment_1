  "body_text": "What next for Kieran Trippier?\nPound for pound, Kieran Trippier has got to go down as one of the greatest ever Newcastle United signings.\nJoining for a reported £12m + add ons in January 2022, he was the first inbound transfer after the Newcastle United takeover.\nA player with vast experience at the top level, both in club and international football. He took a cut in wages and a huge gamble and left La Liga champions, Atletico Madrid, for relegation battlers Newcastle United.\nFor what he did for us, you’d think he arrived wearing a cape. That first half season was cut short through injury but he still scored free-kicks in back-to-back home games to help us defeat Everton and Aston Villa. He then travelled with the squad to the majority of (if not all) games he was unfit for, grinning in the winning photos, crutches displayed.\nI have no doubt his guidance and leadership would have been priceless, even when he couldn’t aid the team on the pitch.\nThe following season he played every single league match as Newcastle United qualified for the Champions League, the first time since the days of Shearer, Solano and Given. He captained us to our first cup final of the millennium that season too.\nIn the following couple of seasons, he’s had a player with fantastic ability and potential in Tino Livramento to contend with. Despite Tino and Lewis Hall, on the other side, becoming the favoured options, Kieran Trippier has provided cover for both and still managed a combined 53 Premier League appearances in the two campaigns prior to this one.\nKieran Trippier played the full 2025 cup final, assisting Burn for the memorable opener. He stood beside new on-field captain Bruno and the club captain Lascelles, hoisting our first domestic trophy for 70 years.\nTrippier has played more top flight games for Newcastle than any of the other clubs he’s represented. For the last couple of seasons, he has regularly been linked with moves away.\nFor whatever reason, those departures didn’t materialise and he remains with us, a leader and inspiration within the dressing room and on the pitch.\nYou can probably tell I am a huge fan of Trippier’s. I think he’s probably in my top five favourite players of the last two decades. But even I have to admit he’s deteriorating as a player. He was never quick but looks more exposed than ever against rapid wingers. His passing has been sloppier than we’re used to seeing.\nHe has only managed 14 league appearance so far this term and he’d no doubt have far less gametime if not for our extensive defensive absences.\nHis performance against Brentford at the weekend was possibly one of his worst for us. He could have seen red early on for a pull back in the penalty area that wasn’t given. He was completely out of position for the winner. Although nobody in the backline came out with much credit in that move, Botman with the poor defensive header and Thiaw not spotting the danger of the gap left by Trippier. In Trippier’s defence, he was getting back from an advanced position having been part of the attack when we’d been in possession.\nI was naturally delighted to see him have such an encouraging performance against Tottenham. Rarely troubled defensively, always talking and regularly progressing the forward actions.\nIn his pomp, from the moment he signed, then through the 22/23 and 23/24 seasons, I think he may be the best right back I’ve ever seen play in the black and white stripes (Newcastle fan since 1996 for reference). Across those latter two seasons he contributed 17 league assists and was instrumental in so many big performances and victories.\nDefensively he’s been brilliant, a lack of pace made up for with a sharp mind and reading of the game. Offensively he’s always provided a threat down our right as shown by those assist stats.\nAfter the Spurs game, Kieran Trippier and Bruno pushing Howe in front of the fans to receive their adoration. The look of satisfaction on Trippier’s face after the travelling support had roared their approval was a picture. Yet again he showed excellent leadership in his desire for the manager to get the plaudits he deserved in that moment.\nI don’t know what’s next for Kieran Trippier.\nI am loathe to admit that I think his time as a player for us is nearing an end. As I said, I appreciate him immensely, but even I think it’s probably time for a young versatile player to come in and replace him. There just haven’t been as many good performances from him this season. Maybe lack of game time is part of that and he could well finish the season in top form and earn an extension. However, turning 36 in September, his performances are likely to continue on a downward trajectory.\nHe could still do a job in the Premier League. I wouldn’t be surprised if a promoted club took a chance on him à la Burnley with Kyle Walker this season. Maybe a change of scenery and a nice final payday somewhere like the MLS might appeal to him.\nMy dream scenario would be that he hangs up his boots at the end of the season and joins Eddie Howe’s coaching team.\nThe pair clearly have an ocean of respect and admiration for each other. We as fans have those some feelings towards him too. The players appreciate and look up (figuratively speaking) to him. He seems the sort of character destined to go into coaching or management and it would be wonderful for him to at least start that journey at the team he has been such a modern-day icon for.\nWhatever happens next, I hope he can see out this season positively and put in a few more performances such as Tuesday’s. Wherever his next step takes him, this fan will adore him forever and I’m sure I won’t be alone in feeling that way.\nYou can follow the author on Twitter @billymerlin\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
