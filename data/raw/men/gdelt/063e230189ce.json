And they could receive another penalty later this season if a second sporting trial looking into the salaries they allegedly paid under the table takes place.\nUEFA could also take action, potentially banning the Turin giants from European competitions for at least one season.\nThat would leave the club in even more turmoil and almost certainly lead to some form of a firesale.\nAnd now Il Corriere dello Sport states that Juventus could part company with Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal target Vlahovic.\nGazzetta dello Sport reported earlier this week that Vlahovic could be one of the players sacrificed on the market if the Old Lady fails to gain access to Europe’s elite competition this term.\nAnd Friday’s edition of Il Corriere dello Sport confirms Vlahovic could move elsewhere in the summer, although the Bianconeri would only consider offers of at least €90m.\nPrem trio all in the hunt for prolific Serb\nUnited, Chelsea and Arsenal are all known to have recently held talks with the player’s entourage. However, there were no formal offers submitted for the player, who is currently sidelined with a groin injury and has not played since October.\nBayern Munich, PSG and Barcelona are also being tipped to join the race for his signature. However, the financial positions of the Premier League trio makes a move to England more likely.\nThe Serbia international has scored 16 goals in 36 appearances for Juventus since his €80m move from Fiorentina a year ago.\nIn terms of which one of the Premier League trio needs Vlahovic most, United are certainly the frontrunner there.\nHaving lost Cristiano Ronaldo, they now have Wout Weghorst on loan. However, it’s not thought his current deal will be turned into a permanent one – despite his desire to do.\nARSENAL MIDFIELD TARGET KEEN ON MOVE\nReal Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi has ‘decided to bet on Arsenal’ in the summer. But only if they pay his €60m (£53m) release clause. (Sport)\nAt least six Inter Milan players will leave by the summer and the Nerazzurri have targeted Liverpool striker Roberto Firmino for the 2023/24 campaign. (Gazzetta)\nChelsea want a fee of just £17.5million for Hakim Ziyech before Tuesday’s deadline, with Everton, Aston Villa and Newcastle all showing interest in the Morocco World Cup star. (Gianluca Di Marzio)\nSir Jim Ratcliffe is ‘close to acquiring’ Manchester United, with a huge deal at ‘an advanced stage’. (TuttoMercatoWeb)\nBarcelona are ‘attentive’ to the possibility of a renewed bid for Cesar Azpilicueta in the summer if Chelsea continue to add to their squad in the coming months. (Sport)\nChelsea want to sign Everton midfielder Amadou Onana. However, the Belgium international has turned down the move as he wants to focus on helping the relegation-threatened Toffees for the rest of the season. (Het Nieuwsblad)\nMORE EURO TRANSFER GOSSIP\nLeeds will have to fight with Arsenal and Aston Villa to sign Weston McKennie in the winter market, with all three clubs still in the running for the Juventus midfielder. (Calciomercato)\nRoma owners are trying to force Nicolo Zaniolo’s move to Bournemouth. They are threatening that he won’t play for the Giallorossi again if he stays at the Stadio Olimpico. (Il Corriere dello Sport)\nMatteo Darmian has agreed to sign a new contract with Inter Milan and will put pen to paper soon. (Football Italia)\nLeicester are ‘convinced’ they can sign Brazilian star Tete from Lyon in the next few days. (Foot Mercato)\nJuventus owner John Elkann insists the troubled Bianconeri are not up for sale. (Football Italia)\nCarlo Ancelotti has dropped a hint over the future of Dani Ceballos, who he would prefer to stay. (Marca)\nHellas Verona midfielder Ivan Ilic has decided to accept Torino’s offer, despite the insistence of Olympique Marseille. (Gianluca Di Marzio)",
