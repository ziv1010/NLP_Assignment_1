  "body_text": "Inter Milan have reached the Coppa Italia final after beating Juventus 1-0 to go through to next month’s showpiece 2-1 on aggregate.\nFederico Dimarco poked home the only goal of an underwhelming game at the San Siro, meeting Nicolo Barella’s pass which was intended for Edin Dzeko and rolling past Mattia Perin.\nIt was the Italian’s fifth goal of the season for his boyhood club and one which continues Inter’s cup campaign.\nSimone Inzaghi’s side have already won the Italian Super Cup and will have the chance to retain the Italian Cup in Rome on May 24, most likely against Fiorentina.\nThey are also preparing for a blockbuster derby with AC Milan in the Champions League semi-finals.\nOn Thursday, Fiorentina host Cremonese 2-0 ahead from their first leg and almost guaranteed passage to the final.\nProgress would have been more straightforward for Inter had Lautaro Martinez managed to get his toe to an inviting Denzel Dumfries cross in the 67th minute.\nAnd Perin also pulled off a great save to deny Henrikh Mkhitaryan when he tipped aside the Armenian’s stinging drive in the 73rd minute.\nJuve were surprisingly flat for a match against their arch-rivals which is usually a feisty affair full of controversy, and exit the competition with a whimper.\nMassimiliano Allegri’s team have lost their simplest route to European football next season and now have to earn a place in continental football via their Serie A placing or by winning the Europa League.\nJuventus are third in Serie A after having their 15-point penalty for illicit transfer activity revoked but are awaiting a potential new punishment from the Italian Football Federation which could bump them back down the league.\nMeanwhile, LaLiga leaders Barcelona were defeated 2-1 away to Rayo Vallecano, thanks to goals from Alvaro Garcia and Fran Garcia early in either half.\nRobert Lewandowski had a late consolation goal but Barca’s third league defeat of the season still leaves them 11 points clear of Real Madrid.\nAtletico Madrid cut the gap on second-place rivals Real to two points with a 3-1 win over Real Mallorca.\nDiego Simeone’s side, wearing special blue and white kits to mark the day of the club’s 120th anniversary, put on an entertaining display with Antoine Griezmann at the heart of it once again.\nThe forward produced two assists as Rodrigo de Paul, Alvaro Morata, and Yannick Carrasco struck for the hosts at the Metropolitano after Matija Nastasic had put Mallorca ahead.\nAlmeria climbed up to 15th with a 2-1 win at Getafe, which left the hosts 17th, while Celta Vigo’s late 1-0 win against bottom-side Elche moved them into 12th.",
