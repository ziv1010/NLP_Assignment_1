Calling the former YouTube star a 'clown', Bellew comically challenged the 28-year-old on behalf of who he believes should be his next opponent - a 107-year-old great grandfather!\nParading alongside Bellew in full robe and gloves, Bellew paraded the elderly gentleman and told Paul - as well as the watching audience - that the 'great grandfather' should be his next opponent.\nHe said: \"Jake Paul, the biggest clown in boxing if Mike lets you survive on Saturday night, then I've got your next opponent here, mate. I've got a great-grandfather. This guy's got two new hips, and at 107, he's ready for you!\"\nThe organisers quickly shut down Bellew's stunt, but it lasted long enough to appear on social media and raise the question of a possible comeback for the 41-year-old - possibly against Paul.\nWatch Gilberto 'Zurdo' Ramirez vs. Chris Billam-Smith free on DAZN on Saturday\nMore Paul vs Tyson\nTyson will step back in the ring for the first time since 2005 when he goes head-to-head with Paul in Texas, but as the pair were previewing the big encounter at yesterday's press conference, they were interpreted by former British boxer Tony Bellew.\nBellew, with mic in hand, interrupted a journalist who was about to ask Tyson a question to aim his own query at Jake Paul.
