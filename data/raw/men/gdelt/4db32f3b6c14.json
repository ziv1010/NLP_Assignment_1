Reluctantly, the Blues are ready to cash in on their academy graduate rather than allowing him to run down his deal into next year before leaving for free.\nAfter reportedly deciding against signing Marcel Sabitzer on a permanent basis after his loan spell from Bayern Munich, Man Utd are giving serious thought to a move for Mount.\nThe England international has plenty of suitors, but is believed to prefer Man Utd out of all of them. And according to Sky Sports News, Erik ten Hag’s side have now made an approach to Chelsea to register their interest.\nWhile they are yet to make an official bid to Chelsea for Mount, they have given a strong signal of what their intentions are.\nElsewhere, the Evening Standard has also confirmed that formal talks have begun between Man Utd and Chelsea regarding Mount.\nAccording to the Standard, Chelsea have responded to Man Utd’s approach by telling them they want a transfer fee in the region of £70m for the 24-year-old.\nDespite the steep demands by the selling club, Man Utd are said to be ‘increasingly confident’ of signing Mount – and think they can reduce the price to somewhere between £50m and £60m.\nMason Mount ready to accept Man Utd terms\nThe earlier report on Sky relayed that personal terms shouldn’t be a problem for Mount. First of all, though, Chelsea will need to give the green light.\nThe Blues have already granted permission to Mateo Kovacic to speak to Manchester City. Kovacic, like his fellow midfielder Mount, is about to enter the final year of his contract in west London.\nIndeed, there could be several departures from the Chelsea midfield this summer. Todd Boehly needs to balance the books after spending excessively on players in his first two transfer windows as chairman.\nIt would also help Mauricio Pochettino to have a smaller squad to inherit after the large group became difficult for Graham Potter to manage.\nAs the Standard reflects, Man Utd believe they can capitalise on the pressure Chelsea are under to raise funds via player sales.\nTherefore, they might be able to buy Mount this summer, which would end his 18-year association with Chelsea, where he came through the academy.\nA regular member of the Chelsea first-team squad since 2019, it would be a blow for the Blues to lose him, but it now appears to be the most likely outcome.\nBy joining Man Utd, Mount will be able to step back up to Champions League level after Chelsea failed to qualify for any kind of European football for next season.\nREAD MORE ~ Rasmus Hojlund: Why Manchester United want the striker and everything you need to know about him",
