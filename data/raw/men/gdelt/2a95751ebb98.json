  "body_text": "Arsenal might have been alerted to the performance of one transfer target in the Champions League.\nTuesday night saw the Gunners secure their second win of the 2024/25 Champions League campaign, beating Shakhtar Donetsk 1-0 at the Emirates.\nIt was a rather uneventful evening for Mikel Arteta’s side, who returned to winning ways after suffering defeat to Bournemouth in the Premier League.\nWhilst the game played out at the Emirates, there was a lot of other action going on in the tournament, with one rumoured target lighting up the European stage once again.\n- READ MORE: Five key talking points from Mikel Arteta’s press conference after Arsenal win vs Shakhtar Donetsk\nArsenal target Viktor Gyokeres shines in the Champions League\nIn the summer transfer window, Arteta welcomed five players to his squad however, failed to sign the striker that fans so dearly wanted.\nThat being said, rumours did circulate that Arsenal were taking an interest in Sporting CP marksman Viktor Gyokeres, who signed for the Portuguese side from Coventry City in 2023.\nIt was reported that Arsenal sent scouts to watch Gyokeres in pre-season, following his remarkable first campaign at Sporting.\nIn 2023/24, the Sweden international scored 43 times in all competitions for his new club, with his form not showing any sign of slowing this term.\nHaving only played 13 times so far this season, Gyokeres has already scored 13 goals, adding to his tally on Tuesday night when Sporting faced SK Sturm Graz.\nThe striker scored a phenomenal solo goal to steal the headlines, with his clinical streak surely alerting Edu Gaspar to revisit the prospect of signing him ahead of the January transfer window.\nEdu has to sign Gyokeres\nWhile Arsenal’s start to the season has been strong, there’s certainly something missing and to many, that something is a striker.\nThe Gunners have no issue creating chances, but so often find themselves scrambling for a goal after failing to convert multiple times.\nManchester City added Erling Haaland to their team in 2022 and never looked back, something that Edu and Arteta must take some inspiration from, with players like Gyokeres hard to find in today’s market.\nIf Arsenal truly want to compete for the Premier League and Champions League, they should look no further than the 26-year-old, who is one of the best performing finishers in world football right now.",
