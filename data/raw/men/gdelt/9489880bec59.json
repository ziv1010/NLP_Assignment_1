The majority of the action occurred on Real's left flank, as the Brazilian duo of Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo consistently combined to threaten Al Ahly's defence, while being complemented by the overlapping runs of Eduardo Camavinga.\nSimilarly, Hussein El Shahat was Al Ahly's main outlet going forward, twice testing the gloves of Real goalkeeper Andriy Lunin.\nYet, it was the La Liga side that took the lead just before the break through Vinicius Jr. Al Ahly failed to clear, allowing the 22-year-old to break through the lines before confidently chipping the ball over a hapless Mohammed El Shenawy.\nShortly after half-time, Real doubled their advantage when Federico Valverde tapped in a rebound after Rodrygo's effort was parried away by El Shenawy.\nAl Ahly found a lifeline, however, when they were awarded a penalty at the hour mark. El Shahat was brought down in the area by Camavinga, and Tunisia international Maaloul duly converted his spot-kick.\nAl Ahly pressed for an equaliser but, with five minutes remaining, Real were also handed a penalty when Vinicius Jr was fouled. Luka Modric stepped up but saw his effort saved. Real shortly restored their two-goal advantage in stoppage time when Rodrygo finished a lovely passing move.\nSubstitute Sergio Arribas added a fourth against the resilient Al Ahly in the dying embers of the game after slotting home from a Real free-kick.\n(Photo: Getty Images)\nGood night!\nThank you for joining us for tonight's coverage.\nFULL TIME: Al Ahly 1-4 Real Madrid\nAfter an uncomfortable period in the second half, Real showed their quality late on with a flurry of goals.\nIt ended up being a comfortable victory for the La Liga side but the scoreline might be slightly unfair for Al Ahly, who put up a spirited performance.\nGOAL!
