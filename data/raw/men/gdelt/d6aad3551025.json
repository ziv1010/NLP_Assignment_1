He now only has two years left on his contract and turns 26 just before the 2025/26 season kicks off.\nI think fair to say that this is the absolute prime time for Brentford to sell their biggest asset. Very unlikely his valuation will ever be as high again if he stays with the Bees, whilst if say injury or just average form next season. If Bryan Mbeumo ended up still at Brentford next summer with only a year left on his contract, then the price Brentford would be able to demand could be half what they could get now, maybe even less.\nWhich then begs the question of which club Bryan Mbeumo could end up at?\nAn exclusive from The Telegraph today has reported that Newcastle United are definitely interested in signing Bryan Mbeumo, that they have scouted him for a number of years whilst at Brentford, that Eddie Howe and every member of the NUFC recruitment team would love to sign him.\nTwo possible obstacles.\nWould Bryan Mbeumo see Newcastle United as the club he’d like/love to join, then would Newcastle be willing to offer the money that would see Brentford sell?\nHaving won a trophy already this season, if Newcastle United can also add Champions League qualification, then clearly not many clubs could match NUFC as an attractive option, a club progressing so quickly under a brilliant manager.\nIronically, Bryan Mbeumo could score the goals to help make that Champions League football for NUFC a reality.\nBrentford are away at Forest tonight and if the away side get a draw, or even better the win, then that would be a huge boost to United’s chances of Champions League with four games to go.\nThe Telegraph say the big worry is what price Brentford would be demanding but obviously, if Newcastle United end up as the club Bryan Mbeumo does see as his favoured option, then it would massively help in keeping the price from going beyond Newcastle’s reach. Brentford surely intend to sell and if a Champions League competing Newcastle United is favoured by the player over certain rivals, it can only help.\nThe newspaper says that; ‘Bryan Mbeumo has featured prominently in recruitment meetings and is viewed as an ideal target…But an asking price of more than £60 million is likely to give Newcastle pause for thought, given the club also need to bring in reinforcements at other positions.’\nBryan Mbeumbo is a quality player (scored home and away this season against Newcastle), the right kind of age with his best years still in front of him, plus can play through the middle as well as on the right, a massive bonus. Something which would arguably give you two players in one for the price.\nOne thing for certain surely, is that if Newcastle United did sign Bryan Mbeumo, then he would help give massive extra goal threat.\nHe signed for Brentford just before his 20th birthday in August 2019, a £5m signing from Troyes (Bryan Mbeumo born in France but plays for Cameroon), his direct goal involvement (goals scored and assists) stats in the league for Brentford are stunning.\n23 (16 goals and 7 assists) in 2019/20 (playing in the Championship)\n18 (8 goals and 10 assists) in 2020/21 (playing in the Championship)\n11 (4 goals and 7 assists) in 2021/22 (playing in the Premier League)\n17 (9 goals and 8 assists) in 2022/23 (playing in the Premier League)\n15 (9 goals and 6 assists) in 2023/24 (playing in the Premier League)\n24 (18 goals and 6 assists) in 2024/25 (playing in the Premier League)\nWith five games remaining for Brentford, it isn’t impossible that Bryan Mbeumo could hit 30 direct goal involvements for the season, especially if he manages a few against Nottingham Forest tonight…\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
