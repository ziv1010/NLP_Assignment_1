Honest. Driven. (So blessed to have this genuinely honest and forthright man as our gaffer. He’ll be the man to bring a trophy to Tyneside. Lovely and genuine bloke).\nWhat do you think Eddie Howe’s first choice eleven will be this coming season, when all current squad are fit?\nPope, Livrimento, Schar, Burn, Hall, Tonali (Longstaff), Bruno, Joelinton, Murphy, Isak, and Gordon.\nYour thoughts on the signings made this summer?\nTwo good outfield players that’ll provide depth. I am actually more excited about Osula – wonderful physical attributes with his size and speed – that’ll learn from, and be surrounded by, quality. Lots of upside! Also, it’ll be interesting who backs up Pope come transfer window close.\nPredict the top five in the Premier League (in order) and which three clubs will be relegated.\nArsenal will win the league.\nThey’ve improved the best defence in the league with Calafiori and last season they scored 91 goals without a great striker. I am not a fan of their manager personally – but he sets their team up to win.\nPep will have Citeh in second place unless there is an unlikely point deduction as a result of the Premier League investigation.\nNewcastle get third place (and a cup trophy). A healthy Pope and Joelinton are worth 10-12 points over last season! Tonali and a favourable and uncongested schedule will also allow this to team with anyone.\nLiverpool and Villa round out the top five. Chelsea, Liverpool, and Man U all will have huge pressure on their managers and I predict two out the three will be sacked by Christmas!\nIpswich, Leicester, and Southampton go down – unless Man City gets the huge point deduction they deserve!\nName a Newcastle player who you think could be a massive surprise success this season, doing far better than most fans expect.\nJacob Murphy has been top notch since January and I will not be surprised if that continues…but I am banking on Tonali to be the Toon Player of the Year. He’s incredibly fast, athletic, intelligent, and a winner and I think he’ll have a point to prove. Sandro is the highest quality player that really is “like a new signing”.\nHand on heart, where do you think Newcastle will finish in the 2024/25 Premier League?\nThird and a cup trophy are in the cards for the Mighty Mags this season! I’d like a bit more depth at CB (no Guehi in as I write this) and more quality up front, but I predict we’re going to be back to the fast, high-pressure, front-footed team that made the Champions League whilst having more athleticism, quality, and depth.\nA healthy Pope, Joelinton, Isak, with Gordon, Bruno, and a wonderful supporting cast led by our aggressive gaffer should put fear into the league. A favourable early schedule will be a blessing. I predict massively improved away form.\nCan we catch Arsenal and Man City? Not without a quality addition or two and a bit of luck… but I am betting on the Toon to win it as the odds are good and Eddie’s Mags are worth a punt!\nWhat would be your ideal future stadium if these two were the options – St James’ Park increased to 60,000, or brand new 80,000 stadium just a few hundred yards up the road where Leazes Park and/or Castle Leazes is?\nLeazes Park makes the most sense to house a 80,000 seat stadium. I am sure the board is “licking their chops” at creating a world-class masterpiece with the caveat…it must keep St James’ Park in the name.\nEales oversaw a masterpiece in Atlanta with Mercedes Benz Stadium and with PIF’s money and ego… Newcastle’s stadium could be the envy of the world. Fill it with 80,000 screaming supporters and it’ll be heard in Salford.\nHow much of a shock was it that Newcastle United had to sell Elliot Anderson and Yankuba Minteh this summer to cover a £50m+ PSR shortfall?\nI hated to lose either player but I can’t complain about the reported £68m plus likely add-on and sell-on clauses. Personally, I was shocked the club left it that late but the result was very good.\nIt’s diabolical that the farce that is PSR and/or FFP reward clubs to sell young players and homegrown talent. The shenanigans at Chelsea and possible corruption in Manchester make every fan outside of the Big Six question everything related to the league.\nBUT – it’ll also make it that much sweeter when we win with our honour in tact!\nWhich Newcastle United player sale would have hurt the most if they’d gone this summer?\nAlexander Isak is a once in a generation talent. Intelligent, athletic, versatile, and committed to the project – we’d have suffered if he was sold. I am biased and love each and every player but I must admit, Alex leaves me speechless at times. I think he wins the Golden Boot this year. He can create and make goals and is “as cool as the other side of the pillow”. A year ago he looked ungainly and slight…Eddie has developed him into a beast.\nWould you like to draw Sunderland again in one of the cups this coming season?\nNo need to rub elbows with a club that would relish hurting a Toon player or the fans of that club. The thought of winning 10-0 is enticing but not at the risk of an injury. Joelinton’s injury last year cost us a European spot I truly believe.\nWith that said, I may be in the minority, but I’d like them to be promoted as derby days were classics and I am genuinely feeling a bit sorry for them. Call me a softy.\nNext three seasons, would you rather finish top four all three seasons BUT win nothing, or finish mid-table all three seasons AND win the League Cup in one of the three?\nWe need a trophy! All of us would support the club through thick and thin.. but many of us are getting a little “long in the tooth”.\nWe need to celebrate a trophy in Newcastle…it’ll be madness!\nCompared to how you felt just after last season ended, are you more or less optimistic now about the season ahead, taking into account all the pre-season matches have now been played and the transfers in and out so far?\nOptimistic is too small a word to how I feel!\nLast year was ups and downs…freak injuries…brutal schedule…and it all seemed snakebit. It’s all positive at the minute. Let’s get this season started with a 4-0 win v Southampton and press on from there.\nHow worried are you about PSR/FFP affecting Newcastle United over the course of the next decade?\nPSR/FFP is anti-competitive and many view it as illegal. I believe it’ll be replaced by a simpler, fairer system or will be scrapped entirely. Too much money is at stake and PIF (or others) will legally challenge it at some point.\nNewcastle start the season with Southampton (Home), Bournemouth (Away), Spurs (Home), Wolves (Away) and Fulham (Away), what would you see as success in these opening five Premier League matches?\nTen points would do me – although I think we could win all five against these teams. Arguably, the best of the lot is Spurs and their high line tactics were exposed last game and will be further exploited this match.\nChelsea are spending incredible amounts of money under these current owners and appear to have a rule book all of their own in terms of what they are able/allowed to do. What do you predict will happen to Chelsea, will it all suddenly collapse like a deck of cards or will they simply continue doing as they are and potentially competitive on the pitch as well?\nChelsea loading up on young players as “investments” is interesting and I am honestly intriqued on how it turns out. Their reliance on long-term amortisation of contracts will come back to bite them.\nHowever, it’s the financial shenanigans with selling club assets at inflated prices to related companies that will be their undoing. Man City and Liverpool will likely challenge (at least I hope they do) and Newcastle and Villa will press the issue too. It may very well be a legal accounting trick but it spits in the face of every other club in English football.\nI am an American but fear the league being run by a super-majority (14) of American owners. They know nothing about the beautiful tradition of football…only profits. They’ll ruin it.\nWhen did you begin actively supporting Newcastle United/realise you were an NUFC fan? How would you describe the differences between now and then? Do you think it is better supporting Newcastle United now (and being a football fan in general), or was it better back when it all started for you?\nI saw my first match in 1978 when visiting Newcastle family with my dad. I came for a match in 1988 and 1992…. but I wasn’t a fanatic until the internet (1995/1996) brought the world closer!\nAnd I can watch every match on TV since 2013 or so. It’s never been any better than it is right now. Thank you PIF and Eddie…and all the wonderful Geordies I can call friends.\nWhich player from your early days supporting Newcastle United would you most like to see in the NUFC 2024/25 team?\nPedro is my favorite player of all time and Beardley’s the best in my lifetime. Can you imagine him, Bruno. Isak, and Gordon???\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
