  "body_text": "Anthony Gordon is available for Newcastle United’s Premier League opener against Aston Villa.\nThe Magpies have endured a frustrating summer transfer window but must now switch focus to Villa as they begin a season where they will be fighting on four fronts having secured their return to the Champions League.\nGordon, who scored nine goals and provided seven assists last season, picked up a knock in his side’s final pre-season game against Atletico Madrid, forced off in the 2-0 defeat to the La Liga giants.\nEddie Howe suggested post-match his winger had suffered a twisted ankle rather than any muscle damage, with Gordon later writing on social media: ‘Just twisted my ankle, no problems. Glad to be back home. Business time next.’\nSpeaking ahead of the trip to Villa Park for Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off, Howe confirmed he has an almost-fully fit squad to choose from with new signing Malick Thaw also in line to make his debut.\n‘Everyone is available apart from Joe (Willock), and he’s not too far away himself. We have a relatively good-looking squad in terms of injury news.\n‘Malick (Thiaw) will be part of the squad. He has trained for two days, it’s never easy coming in at the end of pre-season, but he’s doing well.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

The players are aware he’s not here, the focus will be on each player playing to the best of their ability.’\n‘I want him to play. I want him to train. I’ve had those conversations [with Isak] but the details of those will remain private.\n‘There is no change to the situation. All my focus has been on the training, Aston Villa and the transfer front in terms of getting players in – that is all-consuming for me.\n‘Alex’s situation has been unchanged for a while and that will continue to be the case.’\nMORE: Enzo Maresca hits back at Arne Slot over Chelsea Premier League title claim\nMORE: Benjamin Sesko’s agent reveals truth behind Man Utd transfer and Arsenal talks\nMORE: Man Utd dealt Carlos Baleba transfer blow as Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler speaks out",
