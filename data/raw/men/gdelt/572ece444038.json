Me? Mister, mister! Me?’ Vinicius was heard yelling in Alonso’s direction as the fourth official showed his No.7 on the board.\nAs he approached the bench, Vinicius is alleged to have muttered, ‘Always me! I’m leaving the team! I’m leaving, I’d better go!’, before making his way straight for the home dressing room.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

It’s an important victory, a deserved one.\nMore Trending\n‘Regaining the feeling of a competitive team in big games is important. All coaches know there are different personalities.\n‘Now we’ll enjoy it, and when the time comes we’ll talk about these things in the changing room, of course.’\nVinicius’ representatives have reportedly held discussions with teams in the Saudi Pro League in the past, with some clubs reportedly willing to offer in excess of £200million for the attacker.\nThe former Flamengo man is tied into a contract with Madrid until June 2027.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Manchester United revealed to have failed in £50m bid for Premier League star\nMORE: Former Liverpool coach and Real Madrid legend dies aged 64\nMORE: Arsenal striker Gabriel Jesus admits he is ‘interested’ in joining former club",
