  "body_text": "Kylian Mbappe clearly has no shame whatsoever, as the current Paris Saint-Germain star and his representatives have made yet another stunning demand to Real Madrid.\nThe French World Cup winner is believed to already want to be the best paid player in Los Blancos history, alongside receiving a €100m+ signing on bonus plus not playing for his club until well after the 2024/25 season begins because he wants to represent his country in the Olympics.\nGiven that the tournament is being held in Paris, one can slightly understand his desire.\nAt the start of Pep Guardiola’s tenure at Barcelona, Lionel Messi was similarly intentioned and came back with a gold medal.\nKylian Mbappe has demanded Real Madrid also sign his brother\nHowever, the latest twist in the Mbappe transfer saga really does take the biscuit.\nAccording to OK Diario, a request was made to Real Madrid for Ethan Mbappe, Kylian’s younger brother, to also be signed by the Spanish giants.\nIncredibly, it appears as if Florentino Perez has acceded to this wish, showing that the Frenchman already has his new club over a barrel before a ball has even been kicked in earnest.\nThere’s clearly no doubting his talent as a football player, but his ego needs to be reigned in just a little.\nPerhaps when he first pulls on the white shirt alongside the likes of Vini Jr. and Jude Bellingham, he’ll understand, just as he did when flanked by Lionel Messi and Neymar at PSG, that he’s not necessarily the main attraction.",
