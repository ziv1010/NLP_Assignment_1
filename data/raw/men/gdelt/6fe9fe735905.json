And while there will be a hint of regret that they couldn’t end their 19-year title drought, their campaign truly exceeded all expectations. Now plans are being put in place to ensure Arsenal can once again look to muscle in on City’s trophy success.\nTo that end, the north London giants are making plans to spend the best part of £200m on new stars this summer. And their top target remains Declan Rice, despite entering into something of a bidding war with City for the West Ham midfielder. To that end, the golden number of Rice’s potential fee has finally come to light.\nIt’s not just in midfield though when Arsenal intend to strengthen. They are also looking to strengthen in defence with a deal for Jurrien Timber gathering pace. The Dutchman looks destined to sign from Ajax, with Rob Holding set to depart. A move to Turkey beckons for the long-serving Englishman, bringing to an end his seven-season stay with the Gunners.\nIn addition, Edu and Mikel Arteta are also keen to strengthen their right-back options. To that end, the likes of Ivan Fresneda and Sacha Boey have both been linked with the Gunners.\nAnother name strongly linked has been Cancelo, though City’s asking price for the star – together with the apparent high demand for his services – means a deal has looked tough to pull off.\nMan City willing to sell Cancelo to Arsenal\nTo that end, Bayern Munich and Barcelona are among the European heavyweights strongly linked with a move. Indeed, Bayern had looked in the driving seat given they had an option to make their loan star’s stay permanent this summer.\nHowever, the German champions have let that option pass, while Barcelona’s finances means they too are unlikely to make an approach.\nThat potentially leaves Arsenal as sole suitors for Cancelo. It had been previously claimed that Manchester City do not want to strengthen a direct rival by offloading one of their big names.\nBut, having just won the Treble, it’s now suggested the opposite is true and City have zero qualms over selling Cancelo to Arsenal. These latest claims come from journalist Dean Jones, who argues that a cut-price £26m deal could be on the cards.\nAnd speaking to Chasing The Transfer YouTube channel, Jones believes Arsenal are ready to pounce.\n“Absolutely, they have their eye on this,” Jones said of Cancelo. “Arteta knows where to go shopping when he wants to level up the levels of his own squad. And Cancelo at Man City is the perfect place for him to pick up a great talent.\n“[He’s] Ready to leave. And Man City are willing to let him go to another Premier League club. People constantly keep questioning whether they’re going to keep doing this.\n“Man City don’t care what other teams do. They believe that they are the best. They believe that if they’re willing to let a player go, then it doesn’t matter where they go, they will have a better plan in store.”\nCancelo can help Arsenal level up\nCapable of playing at either left-back or right-back, it came as a shock to many when Guardiola decided to let Cancelo leave in January.\nHowever, with City well covered in both positions, the 29-year-old really was not missed.\nNow reports in Spain claim there is no way back for the 44-times capped star at the Etihad.\nAnd it looks like Arsenal would be the perfect next landing spot for the star.\nThe Gunners relied on Benjamin White as their right-back during the 2022/23 campaign. However, while he excelled there and proved himself capable, that is not his natural position. Moreover, he perhaps does not have the engine and creativity that other, more established right-backs can offer.\nThat is where Cancelo can prove an excellent upgrade for Arsenal. He has 19 goals and an impressive 41 assists from 380 career appearances – a goal contribution every 6.3 appearances.\nThat is certainly a level up from what Arsenal have been used to in previous seasons. And his experience of international and Champions League football offers added appeal for Edu and Arteta.\nIf the price of £26m is accurate, Arsenal would surely snap City’s hands off.",
