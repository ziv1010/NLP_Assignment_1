They’ll be quality. There’s a lot of players missing, but they’ve a lot of strength in depth and a lot of strength in depth in their squad as well.\n“We need to recover because we’ve to go again in three days. But we’ll be ready for them.”\nBoth Ireland and their keeper will head for London on a high after Thursday night’s 1-0 win over Finland in Dublin, in which his 76th-minute penalty save from substitute Joel Pohjanpalo ensured that Evan Ferguson’s header was enough to secure the points.\nHowever, they rode their luck at times – the Finns twice hit the post – and head coach Heimir Hallgrimsson admitted that they would have to be better to get anything against England.\nKelleher said: “We know we can improve on things and it’s big opposition in England. Any England versus Ireland game is big and we’ll definitely be up for it.\n“We’ll look at the game to see what we could have done better, what we need to improve on and get ready.”\nKelleher is currently the man in possession of the shirt with Liverpool and Ireland as Alisson Becker and Gavin Bazunu respectively work their way back from injury.\nHe said: “It’s looking good at the moment. That run of games is very important, keeping that rhythm is good. I’m happy to be getting a chance to show everyone the levels I can play at.\n“It’s common sense. If I’m playing week in, week out, I’m going to be coming in more match-sharp and ready. There’s confidence from playing week in, week out.”",
