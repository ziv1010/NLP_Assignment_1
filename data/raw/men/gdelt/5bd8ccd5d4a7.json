After finishing third last term, they occupy 11th spot this time around.\nThere is little chance of them making the Champions League qualification spots. They could still scrape a top-six finish, although this will only happen if they go on a brilliant winning run in the final few months of the season.\nDespite Leverkusen’s struggles, they have some good players in their squad. Striker Patrik Schick finished as the Bundesliga’s second-top scorer last term, behind only Robert Lewandowski.\nSchick has only found the back of the net three times in the league this season, which is one of the reasons why they have fallen down the table.\nLeverkusen boss Xabi Alonso can also rely on Moussa Diaby, an exciting winger who has been looked at by Arsenal and Newcastle.\nThere is also 22-year-old Jeremie Frimpong, who has established himself as one of the top right-backs in Germany.\nOn Tuesday, journalist Ben Jacobs revealed how Newcastle are rivalling Man Utd for the latter’s signature. Football Insider have now provided an update on Frimpong’s situation.\nMan Utd hope to win race for Newcastle target\nThey claim Man Utd will try to get the jump on Newcastle by submitting an offer for Frimpong before the summer transfer window opens.\nThe Red Devils have decided to move for the Dutchman after scouting him on several occasions. And the Man Utd officials who have watched Frimpong in action have apparently sent back ‘rave reviews’ to Old Trafford.\nLeverkusen have set Frimpong’s price tag at between £40-50m. They believe this price is justified by his top performances in the German top flight, plus the fact his contract does not expire until June 2025.\nHowever, Man Utd have no intention of paying this much. They think they can secure an agreement by bidding £30-35m.\nMan Utd signing Frimpong for £30m would see them save £20m in comparison with the upper end of Leverkusen’s valuation.\nThe report also hands Ten Hag a boost in his pursuit of Frimpong by revealing how he would like to join Man Utd if presented with that chance. While Frimpong is content at Leverkusen, he would like to represent a major English team in the Champions League.\nThe full-back arriving at Man Utd could see Aaron Wan-Bissaka depart. Ten Hag has helped Wan-Bissaka improve in recent months, but he still does not possess the attacking threat that his manager demands.\nFrimpong is much better in the final third, as shown by his superior assists record. While Wan-Bissaka has set up just one goal this season, Frimpong has registered seven assists so far.\nMeanwhile, Man Utd are rivalling Arsenal for the capture of a La Liga midfielder, according to a report.",
