Meanwhile, Young Africans will face the Congolese team TP Mazembe in the CAF Champions League at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Saturday.\nNeither Simba nor Yanga have progressed to the quarter-finals yet, with both teams vying for tickets to advance.\nSimba currently hold six points and are tied with other teams in their group—Constantine and FC Bravos do Maquis—while CS Sfaxien sit at the bottom without any point.\nA victory for Simba in Tunisia would raise their total to nine points and put them in a strong position to qualify for the next round.\nSpeaking from Tunisia, Simba’s Media and Communication Officer, Ahmed Ally, confirmed the team’s arrival and their positive morale ahead of the match.\nHe stated: “We landed safely here in Tunisia, and our players are in good shape. Everything is going according to set plan.\nWe will take some time to relax and have a light workout the day before the game. We are well-prepared for the encounter.”\nDespite their positive spirits, Simba understand that a loss to Sfaxien would complicate their qualification prospects. Conversely, if Sfaxien win, it could give the Tunisian side the momentum needed to turn their season around after a poor start.\nThe match will be held behind closed doors due to a two-match fan ban imposed on Sfaxien by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) following crowd troubles at their previous home games.\nThe next three weeks will be crucial for Simba as they complete their remaining group-stage fixtures. After the match in Tunisia, they will travel to Angola on January 12 to face Bravos, followed by a return home for their final group match against CS Constantine on January 19.\nOn the other hand, Yanga are facing a challenging campaign in the CAF Champions League, having secured only one point from their opening three games and currently sitting at the bottom of Group A.\nTheir upcoming match against TP Mazembe on Saturday, January 4, at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium is a must-win if they hope to salvage their campaign and pursue qualification.\nALSO READ: CAF-CL: Dube’s late equaliser earns Yanga 1-1 draw at Mazembe\nGroup leaders Al Hilal from Sudan have accumulated nine points, while Algeria’s MC Algiers follow with four points.\nTP Mazembe, with two points, are on third place, but Yanga’s poor performance has left them trailing and fighting for survival. Yanga’s Media and Communication Officer, Ali Kamwe, is optimistic ahead of the critical match.\nHe said: “The team is well-prepared and ready to face TP Mazembe. We are aiming for a win to secure crucial points that will help us improve our standing in the group.”\nKamwe also shared positive news regarding the return of some key players, saying: “Clatous Chama and Djigui Diarra are back from injury, and we hope to perform better in this upcoming game.”\nThe highly anticipated match will kick off at 4 p.m. on Saturday at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium, where Yanga seek to turn their fortunes around in front of their home fans.",
