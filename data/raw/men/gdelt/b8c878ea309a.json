Money always has an impact.\n“But this cannot be that much of an impact, let me say it like this.\n“Of course it is influential but this is a summer where we have to be in the market, definitely.\n“I am sorry that we cannot guarantee the Champions League at this moment but it’s not done yet. We will fight for it so we don’t have to talk about it as though it is not possible. But it is tricky and difficult and if (we qualify), it will be a late decision, I guess.\n“We have to start doing work earlier than before we know where we will end up position-wise and European competition-wise, so these things are clear here.”\nPrincipal owner John W Henry confirmed this week that Fenway Sports Group are in discussions with interested parties about buying a minority stake in the club.\n“Are we talking with investors about LFC? Yes. Will something happen there? I believe so, but it won’t be a sale,” Henry said.\nAsked about the possibility of new investment before the summer and how significantly that could influence the club’s plans, Klopp said: “I am optimistic when he (Henry) is optimistic because it is his business.\n“I am not involved in the search for investors. Not yet! That would be funny! I can be by the way, I did I think at Dortmund once.\n“My job is to make it 100 percent clear what we need from a sports point of view and then other people are responsible for giving us the resources or whatever. I have nothing to do with that.\n“I think we’ve played five years in a row in the Champions League, which is massive, and we went to the final three times in that time, which is massive from a money point of view.\nAdvertisement\n“We built a stand and a training ground and the club is in a really good place, but around us, a few people are speeding up a little bit and you cannot ignore that.\n“It’s still about finding the right players, it’s not about bringing in a lot. And thank God in the world of football there are a lot of right players. Not all of them are affordable or want to come, but there are a lot of really good players out there.\n“The only reason I don’t like to talk too much about it now is because there are a lot of games to play. You always ask about transfers but this team is the basis for what we do. And even now, when people are in the mood, ‘he should go, he can go’. My God, calm down please!\n“Have a look, go on YouTube and remind yourselves, ‘that is what he did, he threw his heart and soul on to the pitch’. That doesn’t mean we have to be thankful to him for the rest of his life, but that’s still in there, so let’s make a decision at the end of the season and while we are together, let’s support this group together with me with all we have. That is all I am asking for to be honest.”\nKlopp insists the process of identifying transfer targets hasn’t changed since sporting director Michael Edwards left the club nearly a year ago and is adamant he hasn’t become more influential in recruitment.\n“I’ve always had the same say. I cannot decide at all about money. Not about one penny. It is always the same. The old school managers maybe had a budget and could work with that, it is not like this,” he said.\nLiverpool are next in action against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park tomorrow.\nGO DEEPER\nYes, Liverpool are in transition, but huge overhauls rarely work - just ask Chelsea\n(Photo: Getty Images)",
