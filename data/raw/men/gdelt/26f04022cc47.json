  "body_text": "FOOTBALL – BARCELONA twice battled back to draw 3-3 at home against Inter Milan in a rip-roaring first leg of their Champions League semi-final at Montjuic Olympic Stadium last night.\nInter Milan made an explosive start, opening the scoring within the first minute courtesy of a cheeky back-heel goal from Marcus Thuram. The visitors extended their lead in the 21st minute with Denzel Dumfries finding the net with an acrobatic volley from a corner.\nHowever, an electrifying Lamine Yamal led Barcelona’s fightback, unleashing a superb strike from inside the box after a clever run from the right to reduce the deficit three minutes after Inter’s second goal.\nYamal went close again, hitting the post from close range before Ferran Torres levelled the score in the 38th minute with a first-time finish.\nDespite Barcelona’s dominance, it was Inter who regained the lead in the 64th minute when Dumfries headed home from a corner. The hosts responded immediately, as Raphinha’s thunderous strike from outside the box hit the post before ricocheting off the back of Inter keeper Yann Sommer and into the net to restore parity.\nThe result leaves everything to play for in the return leg at the San Siro next Tuesday, as both teams seek a place in the final in Munich against either Arsenal or Paris St Germain.",
