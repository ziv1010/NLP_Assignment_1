As a Group, we delivered strong results in line with our guidance, demonstrated rapid progress against the strategy presented at our listing and strengthened our financial position.\nIn Content production & distribution, strong profitable growth is linked both to new shows, including scripted hits Marie-Antoinette and SAS Rogue Heroes, and the continued evolution of our unscripted superbrand offering built on powerful IP such as Masterchef, Big Brother and Survivor which are relaunching in key markets and entering new territories. This production, as well as our successful execution of 15 bolt on acquisitions in 10 territories have driven a 30% increase of our overall content catalog, cementing our position as the number one global independent content producer. We are perfectly positioned in this business to capture market consolidation opportunities going forward.\nIn Online sports betting & gaming, the growth of our revenues has been also very strong, despite a high comparison base in 2021. The overall number of Unique Active Players increased by 25%, powered in part by our strong commercial performance during the football World Cup. Betclic has been the most downloaded sports betting app in our core markets of France, Poland and Portugal, and the second most downloaded across Europe, thanks to our state-of-the-art technology platform which leads the way in terms of reliability and efficiency. Looking ahead we will capitalize on increased player numbers to drive continued organic growth at a high pace.\nFl Entertainment’s first yearly results are a testimony to the strength of our business model. We are well positioned to reinforce our leading positions in our structurally growing markets in 2023 and continue to demonstrate our proven ability to delivery profitable growth at scale”.\n*****\nFL Entertainment invites you to its 2022 results conference call on:\nThursday, March 16th 2023, at 6:00pm CET\nWebcast live:\nYou can watch the presentation on the following link:\nhttps://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/4i46xfmv\nDial-in access telephone numbers:\nYou need to register to the following link:\nhttps://register.vevent.com/register/BI60d2c660f0f54582b32a5db6f13db8d3\nSlides related to 2022 results are available on the Group’s website, in the “Investor relations” section:\nhttps://www.flentertainment.com/\nKEY FINANCIALS IN 2022\n2022 – KEY EVENTS\nContent production & distribution: active year 2022 in M&A\nBanijay continued to execute its M&A strategy in 2022, enriching its content and geographical footprint, creating economies of scale and contributing to long-term performance.

Despite exceptionally high betting volumes, the platform remained fully secure, with no security breaches and zero app downtime.\nESG: At the heart of the FL Entertainment business model\nBanijay: improving its position in diversity, inclusion, and environment\nBanijay is committed to ensuring a truly representative and inclusive workforce and has implemented a framework to monitor the impact of these initiatives.\nThis framework has three pillars:\n- Create global employees’ groups (e.g., pride, disability, women-led) to foster inclusion and promote diversity;\n- Create a safe working environment for all employees; and\n- Equip all employees with a sustainability-led mind-set to reduce carbon footprint and overall impact on environment.\nBanijay aims to create an environment where employees can perform to the best of their abilities in an inclusive work culture. In that context, it set up its first dedicated Diversity & Inclusion Board in 2022 and will go further in 2023 to effectively drive best practices and initiatives around the world. Banijay also partnered with 3Degrees to create a carbon emission measurement system for its operations, which will be launched in 2023.\nBetclic: pursuing the highest standards for responsible gaming\nBetclic puts player protection at the heart of the company’s strategy and development. It ran three initiatives to raise attention to responsible gaming through a dedicated campaign, partnerships with associations with the launch of the first ever French website to prevent underage gaming as well as a dedicated communication during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022.\nAs part of its commitment to ensuring the highest standards, Betclic ran three initiatives to responsible gaming:\nA major responsible gaming education campaign in France in October 2022, based on four pillars:\n- Educate players via the Betclic app as well as large-scale marketing campaign focused on playing with control;\n- Increase public awareness to prevent underage gaming\n- Deepen training on risky behavior prevention measures with all Betclic employees;\n- Innovate with a responsible gaming “lab sprint” made up of 100 Betclic experts including engineers, product managers and responsible gaming experts.\nAlongside those initiatives, Betclic had two partnerships with two reference associations in 2022:\n- E-Enfance, to build the first website for parents to help them prevent teenage gaming together: www.pasdujeu.fr\n- GamCare, a recognized European expert in the prevention and treatment of gaming problems.\nDuring the FIFA World Cup, Betclic launched a communication campaign to raise awareness among players and public opinion on that matter.\nBetclic also initiated actions related to its social and societal impact including the introduction of a sustainable mobility package to reduce its environmental footprint.\nMore information on the Group’s existing policies and action plans will be included in chapter 2 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document, that will be published at the end of April 2023.\nFL Entertainment will report annually in its Universal Registration Document on the progress of its key non-financial performance indicators.\nBusiness combination\nOn 10 May 2022, FL Entertainment N.V., announced that it had entered into a definitive business combination agreement with Pegasus Entrepreneurial Acquisition Company Europe B.V., a special purpose acquisition company, to become a listed company on Euronext Amsterdam.\nThe business combination was completed on 1 July 2022 and provided the Group with additional capital of around €608m after deduction of the fees and expenses of the business combination, at around €35m. The first day of trading on Euronext Amsterdam took place on 1 July 2022.\nGroup reorganization\nThe Group conducted reorganization between entities within Financière Lov group and with minority interests in order to achieve the Transaction described above.\nLiquidation of Bet-at-home Entertainment Ltd\nOn 22 December 2021, Bet-at-home Group announced the winding up by the court procedure of bet-at-home.com Entertainment Ltd, a Maltese entity operating casino activities under license by the Malta Gaming Authority, consolidated at 53.9% as of December 2021, which took effect in the first half of 2022.\n2022 - PROFIT & LOSS STATEMENT\n2022 “Normalized P&L” highlights the underlying performance of the Group by removing the impact of one-off items related to reorganization and business combination (refer to page 11).\nAccounts are presented under IFRS standards, unless explicitly mentioned.\nCONSOLIDATED REVENUE\nIn 2022, Group revenue increased by +13.2% at constant currency to €4,046.6m, driven by solid growth across its two business lines. This includes +15.7% in Q4 2022.\nOn a reported basis, consolidated revenue grew by +15.7% over the period.\nThis is reflected as follows by business:\nContent production & distribution:\nRevenue totaled €3,212m, up +16.5% in absolute terms and +13.3% at constant currency in 2022. Overall, growth was fueled by high-quality IP, a comprehensive content offering to serve clients needs and to a lesser extent the positive impact from bolt-on acquisitions.\nContent production revenue was up +17.7% to €2,665m in 2022, driven by 216 launches of successful new non-scripted shows and around 67 new scripted shows.\nThe Group delivered new shows with universal appeal across both non-scripted (“Starstruck” in the UK, “Love Triangle” in Australia), and scripted (“SAS Rogue Heroes” in the UK, “Marie-Antoinette” in France and “Grantchester” in the UK). Recommissioned or returning formats generated 69% of Content production revenue. “Masterchef”, one of the top travelling formats, was recommissioned in France, and aired in 39 countries in 2022. Other top travelling formats included “Survivor”, showing in 21 territories for its 25th anniversary and “Big Brother” in 33 territories.\nDistribution revenue increased by +16.9% to €388m driven by a firm demand from both linear TV and streaming platforms (OTT) for key non-scripted and scripted content such as “You” for Sky and “Peaky Blinders” for Netflix in the UK.\nIn 2022, partly due to the delay in production during Covid, scripted programs’ production has been higher than in 2021 and totaled 24% of Content production & distribution revenue compared to 20% in 2021.\nThe share of OTT increased drastically in 2022 to 18% of Content production & distribution revenue, up 5ppts compared to 2021.\nOverall, the number of content hours at the end of December 2022 increased sharply by +30% compared to 2021 to ~160,000 hours6.\nOnline sports betting & gaming:\nThe Online sports betting & gaming business recorded +12.7% revenue growth on a reported basis7 in 2022 (+12.8% at constant currency) with a strong performance in Q4 2022 (+34.2%) boosted by the impact of the World Cup.\nThe football World Cup in Q4 2022 contributed 7.5% of Betclic Group annual sportsbook stakes and 31% in annual new sportsbook Unique Active Players (UAP). The Group recorded +38% increase in its UAPs’ base in December 2022 compared to prior to the World Cup in October 2022.\nBy division and including Bet-at-home, revenue rose by +13.8% in sportsbook in 2022 with +25% increase in UAPs, by +2.7% for online casino due to greater gamification and launch of new exclusive games (Mega Santos in Portugal), and by +13.1% for online poker partly linked to cross-sell during the World Cup.\nAt constant exchange rates and excluding discontinued Bet-at-home operations in certain jurisdictions, revenue was up +19% in 2022, driven by the solid continued performance of Betclic entity (+21%), offsetting the -10% decline at Bet-at-home. In Q4 2022, growth stood at +36%.\nAs part of its commitment towards responsible gaming standards, Betclic primarily operates in regulated markets. This is illustrated by the proportion of its revenue generated in locally regulated markets: 96.5% of 2022 revenue.\nADJUSTED EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA rose by +10.0% to €670.2m in 2022, on revenue up +15.7% on a reported basis. This split into +9.1% rise to €472m for Content production & distribution and +14.8% increase to €202.8m for Online sports betting & gaming.\nNORMALIZED P&L: FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA TO ADJUSTED NET INCOME\nNormalized P&L highlights the underlying performance of the group for 2022 without one-off items related to reorganization and business combination.\nComments thereafter analyze the “Normalized P&L” in 2022 compared to 2021 reported P&L.\nOne-off items related to the Transaction:\nFL Entertainment recorded one-off items from the Group reorganization and listing Transaction:\n- Restructuring and other non-recurring items: €106m related to listing and transaction fees and costs incurred to realize the Transaction. Under IFRS, the merger with the SPAC is considered as an equity-settled share-based payment for a service rendered by the SPAC to list the Group. This service is valued at €86m and is recorded as a listing fee;\n- LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses: €33m mainly driven by the change in fair value of financial instruments explained by the LTIP following the upward reassessment of the Banijay Group’s shares;\n- Other finance income / loss: €96m attributable mainly to the change in fair value of financial instruments. This includes re-evaluation and the change in fair value of Vivendi’s convertible bond derivatives following the upward assessment of the Banijay Group’s shares. This bond was paid back as part of the Transaction.\nExceptional income from the deconsolidation of Bet-at-home Entertainment Ltd\nFL Entertainment recorded a net exceptional income of +€11m mainly coming from the deconsolidation of Bet-at-home Entertainment Ltd in H1 2022.\nNet financial result\nNet financial result amounted to -€160.3m in 2022 compared to -€133.4m in 2021. Of this amount:\n- Cost of net debt totaled -€143.8m in 2022 vs -€135.3m in 2021, attributable to a higher level of interest charges due to a currency effect in Content production & distribution and a timing effect of interest charges related to Betclic loan issued on 13 December 2021.\n- Other financial income and expenses amounted to -€16.5m in 2022, compared to +€1.9m in 2021, mainly explained by financial instruments in 2022.\nIncome tax expenses\nThe tax charge in 2022 rose to -€76.9m compared to -€49.2 in 2021, due to greater use of tax loss carry-forward in 2021 and a change in country mix.\nAdjusted net income\nAs a result of the above, Adjusted net income amounted to €306.7m in 2022 compared to €282.5m in 2021.\nFREE CASH FLOW AND NET FINANCIAL DEBT IN 2022\nFREE CASH FLOW CONVERSION\nAdjusted free cash flow (after lease payments) reached €554.7m, up +11.5% in 2022, driven by the business performance as well as a tight control of cash expenses and capital expenditures.\nThe change in working capital reflected the seasonality of the two businesses.\nAdjusted free cash flow conversion after capex and leases payment amounted to 83%.\nThe rise in income taxes paid was mainly attributable to greater use of tax loss carry-forward in 2021.\nAdjusted operating free cash flow rose by 11.1% to €495m in 2022 compared to 2021.\n*Excludes LTIP paid and exceptional items cash-out\nSOLID FINANCIAL POSITION AND DE-LEVERAGING\nThe Group’s Net financial debt declined by €178m to €2,091m as of 31 December 2022 compared to €2,269m as of 31 December 2021. This reflects the robust business performance over the year.\nNet financial debt mainly came from an increase in Adjusted free cash flows for -€495m and cash proceeds received following the transaction (-€121m), partly offset by LTIP paid & exceptionals for €152m, net acquisitions for €130m and €144m interests recognized during 2022.\nThe financial leverage ratio stood at 3.1x as of 31 December 2022, compared to 3.7x as of 31 December 2021, at the low end of 3.0-3.5x 2022 guidance.\nThe Group’s Net financial debt is at fixed rate with no maturity before 2025. The Group may, from time to time and depending on prevailing market conditions, seek to extend the maturity of, or to refinance, all or part of its financial indebtedness.\nAt Banijay level, two agencies recently upgraded their ratings on its strong performance: B+ by S&P on 15 September 2022 and B+ by Fitch Ratings on 15 March 2023.\nDIVIDEND\nIn line with its strategy presented at the listing in July 2022, FL Entertainment plans to distribute dividends in respect of the financial year 2022 which will represent at least one third of Adjusted net income.\nThe proposed dividend for the financial year 2022 amounts to €150m, i.e. €0.36 per share, representing a 49% payout ratio on Adjusted net income. It will be paid fully in cash and will be submitted for approval to the Annual General Meeting on 15 June 2023.\n2023 OBJECTIVES IN LINE WITH MID-TERM OUTLOOK\nIn 2023, growth momentum will remain solid, driven by:\n- Content production & distribution: continued focus on scripted and unscripted opportunities from new content and the Group’s rich content catalogue, as well as meeting client needs through non-scripted offer of powerful superbrands well suited to the current economic climate.\n- Online sports betting & gaming: leveraging on increased player numbers generated in 2022 after the FIFA World Cup to drive increased betting volumes as well as coming events such as UEFA Champions league, while focusing on customer centricity and experience through market leading technology & IT platform.\nFor the financial year 2023, FL Entertainment anticipates the following:\n- Revenue:\n- Mid-single digit organic growth for Content production & distribution\n- Double-digit organic growth for Online sports betting & gaming\n- Adjusted EBITDA of around €710M\n- ~80% free cash flow conversion\n- Dividend payout ratio: at least 33.3% of the Group’s Adjusted net income\nMID-TERM OUTLOOK CONFIRMED\nThe Group confirms its mid-term outlook presented at the time of the listing:\n- Content production & distribution: mid-single digit annual organic revenue growth and stable Adjusted EBITDA margin\n- Sports betting & online gaming: low teens annual organic revenue growth and stable Adjusted EBITDA margin\n- Group Adjusted cash conversion rate at around 80%\n- Dividend payout ratio: at least 33.3% of the Group’s Adjusted net income\n- Group Net financial debt / Adjusted EBITDA below 3x\nAgenda\nQ1 2023 results: 30 May 2023\nGeneral Shareholders’ Meeting: 15 June 2023\nA brand-new website now available\nInvestor Relations\nCaroline Cohen – Phone: +33 1 44 95 23 34 – c.cohen@flentertainment.com\nPress Relations\nflentertainment@brunswickgroup.com\nHugues Boëton – Phone: +33 6 79 99 27 15\nNicolas Grange – Phone: +33 6 29 56 20 19\nAbout FL Entertainment\nFounded by Stéphane Courbit, a 30-year entertainment industry pioneer and entrepreneur,\nFL Entertainment Group is a global leader in multimedia content and gaming, combining the strengths of Banijay, the world’s largest independent producer distributor, with Betclic Everest Group, the fastest-growing online sports betting platform in Europe.
