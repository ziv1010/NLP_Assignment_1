Maybe thank you to Steve Clarke for putting me higher up the pitch.”\nClarke's decision to push McGinn closer to goal was borne as much out of necessity as tactical ingenuity.\nThe lack of a goalscoring number nine has dogged Scotland for generations and Clarke has instead had to lean on a goal threat from midfield.\nManchester United's Scott McTominay also ended the season in a more advanced role for his club after scoring seven goals in Euro 2024 qualifying, including both in a 2-0 win over Spain.\nMcGinn chipped in with three goals in qualifying and has grown into a leadership role off the pitch as well as the dressing room entertainer.\n“He's the life and soul of the boys,” said Scotland striker Lyndon Dykes, who has remained with the squad despite being ruled out of the tournament due to injury.\n“He's always got puns coming out left, right and centre. I think he must sit in his room and think about things he's going to say the next day because I don't know where he pulls them from.”\nBehind McGinn's jovial nature, though, is a steely determination to succeed that has characterised Scotland's rise under Clarke.\nOverlooked by Glasgow giants Celtic and Rangers, he made his name at St. Mirren and Hibernian before joining Villa while they were still in England's second tier.\nHaving fought his way to the top with both club and country, the biggest game of his career now awaits on Friday and Germany are in McGinn's sights.\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
