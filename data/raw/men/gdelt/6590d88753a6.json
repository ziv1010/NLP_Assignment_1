  "body_text": "Roberto De Zerbi, who has been linked to Liverpool and Barcelona, has acknowledged that he is content at Brighton & Hove Albion but that he is open to working for “a big, big team” in the future.\nBoth Liverpool and Barcelona are looking for a new manager as Jurgen Klopp and Xavi have decided to step down from their position.\nBrighton’s De Zerbi is one of the favourites for both the jobs after impressing during his time in the Premier League. The Italian has been a huge success after taking the Seagulls to the Europa League.\nDe Zerbi stated in an interview with Sky Sports that while his goal is to help Brighton, he is still committed to competing for titles in the future.\n“We feel we can write another part of Brighton’s history,” De Zerbi began.\n“Everyone feels this responsibility and we are working very hard to make happy our fans and our people working in the club. We will try and show our best.\n“When I hear that big teams are interested in me it is an honour. I am proud, but my focus is on my work day-by-day.\n“About the future, I will speak with the owner [Tony Bloom] and with the club because I want to compete in the best way I can. I want to understand the plan, and then it is not a problem to work in a big, big team or another big team.\n“I would like in my career to compete to win the Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga, La Liga, Champions League but there isn’t a time when you have to go and compete, or to wait some more time.\n“Milan for me is not a normal club because as a player I was born in AC Milan. For my life I will always be grateful for Milan.“I love my country, I love Italy, I love Italian football. For sure one of my targets is to go back and work in my country, but I don’t know when is the time.\n“I am feeling very well in the Premier League and I have to say thanks to Brighton and for all of the coaches and people in [and supporting] the Premier League in the UK.\n“But it is not a problem where you work, it is how you are working, not the place.”\nAfter Graham Potter joined Chelsea in September 2022, De Zerbi assumed leadership of Brighton.\nThe Italian, in his first season with the Seagulls, guided the team to their best-ever league result, finishing sixth in the Premier League standings and earning a first-ever trip to Europe.\nBrighton qualified for the Europa League round of 16 after topping a group that included Ajax, Marseille and AEK Athens.\nThey are currently seventh in the league ahead of Newcastle United, West Ham and Chelsea.\nJust like Potter left Brighton for a bigger job, De Zerbi is expected to do the same at some point in his career with big clubs coming for him.\nThe Italian has made a name for himself with his team playing some of the best football in the league.",
