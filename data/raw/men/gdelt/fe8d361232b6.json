With individual errors we gave our opponents belief again.\"\nMissing out on the title on the final day last season is just a distant memory to Dortmund fans at the moment but they remain in the fourth and final Champions League spot by a point - mainly due to the inconsistency of others.\nFifth-placed RB Leipzig lost 2-1 late on at Bayern Munich on Saturday while in Sunday's early game, Eintracht Frankfurt in sixth failed to make much headway with a last-gasp 2-2 draw at home to Wolfsburg.\nFans threw tennis balls and other objects onto to the pitch in Frankfurt at the start of the second half despite the German Football League (DFL) abandoning unpopular plans to recruit an external investor last week.\nSupporter protests against the proposals had been going on for weeks in the Bundesliga but given the DFL's climb-down, Saturday's matches were largely played without incident.\nWhy fans in Frankfurt continued the protest was initially unclear - although one banner criticized Volkswagen-owned Wolfsburg.\nDespite a stoppage-time leveller from Omar Marmoush, it is now four league games in a row without a win for the Eagles, who are seven points off Dortmund with only 11 games left.\nFrankfurt, knocked out of the Europa Conference League by Union Saint-Gilloise on Thursday, went behind to Maxence Lacroix's goal after just 2 minutes.\nMore in Sports\nLeft wingback Philipp Max soon equalized on the overlap after a quick break for his first of the season.\nBut the visitors went back ahead on 36 minutes through a first Wolfsburg goal for January recruit Kevin Behrens.\nThe former Union Berlin forward netted with a header, but Marmoush's late goal means Wolfsburg are still waiting for their first win since mid-December as coach Niko Kovač remains under pressure.\nThe draw at Kovač's former side left the Wolves in 13th.\nFrankfurt boss Dino Toppmöller said: \"Of course we wanted to play a bit better football, which wasn't easy today, and we want to win games. But we are coming out of a difficult phase. The reaction after the nightmare start was good, we deserved to equalize.\"\nIn Dortmund, Hoffenheim seized an early lead thanks to Ihlas Bebou but Donyell Malen and Nico Schlotterbeck had the hosts ahead midway through the first half.\nAs so often this season though, Dortmund lost their way and German under-21 international Beier scored on 61 and 64 minutes.\nA 1-1 draw at PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League last-16 first leg on Tuesday at least sets Dortmund up as favourites for a quarter-final place after March's second leg - but only if they make their cavernous stadium a fortress again.\nFreiburg, who reached the Europa League last 16 on Thursday, are ninth after losing 2-1 at an Augsburg side who roared up to 11th from fourth-bottom. Freiburg's Vincenzo Grifo won and converted a penalty but Felix Uduokhai and Arne Engels turned the game around.\nOn Friday, unbeaten Bayer Leverkusen prevailed 2-1 at home to second-bottom Mainz and lead the table by eight points.",
