  "body_text": "Man Utd vs Liverpool: The results of their last 10 meetings\n- Man Utd and Liverpool enjoy a ferocious rivalry\n- The two sides have clashed 241 times over the years\n- Liverpool have enjoyed some big victories in this fixture recently\nFixtures don't come much bigger than Manchester United vs Liverpool.\nA fierce rivalry between England's most decorated football clubs, these two teams loathe one another. Their battles on the pitch have often been legendary, fuelled by hatred and the opportunity for not only bragging rights, but silverware.\nDespite Liverpool having enjoyed greater success in recent years in terms of trophies, meetings between these two old foes remain incredibly tight, even if there have been one or two batterings.\nHere are the last ten meetings between Man Utd and Liverpool.\nMan Utd 4-3 Liverpool - FA Cup\nA game that will go down as one of the great FA Cup quarter-finals, Man Utd were the side who left Old Trafford smiling in March 2024.\nThe Red Devils had got off to a dream start following Scott McTominay's early goal, but quick-fire efforts from Alexis Mac Allister and Mohamed Salah put Liverpool ahead just before the break. The Reds had countless chances to kill the game off as they took control of proceedings, but their wastefulness was punished by Antony's late equaliser.\nHarvey Elliott's strike put Liverpool ahead during the additional 30 minutes, but an equaliser by Marcus Rashford was followed by an incredible 121st minute breakaway goal from Amad Diallo to send United through to the final four.\nLiverpool 0-0 Man Utd - Premier League\nLiverpool were expected to wipe the floor with Man Utd during their first meeting of the 2023/24 season in the Premier League, but Erik ten Hag's side somehow held out for a goalless draw despite facing 34 shots across the 90 minutes.\nIn fact, they remain the only side to have stopped Liverpool scoring in all competitions this season, and one of the few teams to avoid defeat at Anfield this term.\nLiverpool 7-0 Man Utd - Premier League\nLiverpool's most historic victory against Man Utd came last season and it still doesn't quite feel like it really happened. Not only did the Reds waltz to an enormous victory, they put seven unanswered goals past their close rivals.\nAmazingly, Liverpool didn't open the scoring until the 43rd minute following Cody Gakpo's smart finish, but the Dutchman's delightful second, a Salah volley and a Darwin Nunez brace put the home side five goals to the good with 15 minutes to play.\nSalah then grabbed his second and Roberto Firmino produced his final goal against United to rub salt in the wounds on a day that will live long in the memory for the Anfield crowd.\nMan Utd 2-1 Liverpool - Premier League\nLiverpool had come close to a quadruple during the 2021/22 season but had made a poor start to the following campaign, drawing their opening two matches. Things got even worse for Klopp's side when visiting Old Trafford on matchday three, with the Reds tasting a disappointing defeat on the road.\nJadon Sancho had put the hosts ahead with a rare goal and Rashford, who has a fantastic record against Liverpool, doubled their advantage just after half-time. A late Salah goal couldn't salvage anything for the visitors, and it was a sign of things to come for Klopp's men during a torrid campaign.\nLiverpool 4-0 Man Utd - Premier League\nRalf Rangnick didn't enjoy his only trip to Anfield in the Man Utd hot seat, with his side outplayed and torn apart in a 4-0 defeat. Things got off to the nightmare start for the visitors, with Luis Diaz opening the scoring after just five minutes, and a fabulous Liverpool team goal made things two before the break.\nSadio Mane added a third before Salah grabbed his second of the match to continue his marvellous record against the Red Devils. Ultimately, it was a drubbing for United.\nMan Utd 0-5 Liverpool - Premier League\nTheir humiliation at Anfield later in the 2021/22 season would still be no match for what happened at Old Trafford earlier in the campaign, with Liverpool coming away from Manchester with a famous 5-0 victory.\nThe Reds were four goals up by half-time thanks to efforts from Naby Keita and Diogo Jota, as well as a brace from, you guessed it, Salah. The Egyptian grabbed his hat-trick shortly after the restart, with Paul Pogba also seeing red in what was a truly disastrous day for United.\nThe only positive for the hosts is that Liverpool took their foot off the gas in the second half.\nMan Utd 2-4 Liverpool - Premier League\nA first of three straight wins for Liverpool in this fixture, this particular match was played in front of an empty Old Trafford due to the coronavirus pandemic. That was fortunate for United supporters, who would have had to witness their side fall to a 4-2 defeat.\nBruno Fernandes' deflected effort put Man Utd in front after just ten minutes but Jota's backheel and Firmino's header turned things around for the visitors before the break. The Brazilian swiftly grabbed his second after half-time, with Rashford pulling a goal back to create a nervy finish.\nHowever, Salah once again downed the Red Devils with his late effort to secure the points, with the result proving pivotal in Liverpool's Champions League qualification during the 2020/21 campaign.\nMan Utd 3-2 Liverpool - FA Cup\nLiverpool had travelled to Old Trafford just four months before their 4-2 league victory to face United in the FA Cup fourth round, but it was Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side that came out on top on that particular occasion.\nSalah had bagged another double against the Red Devils to level the scores at 2-2 heading into the final half-hour, but Fernandes would prove the match-winner for the hosts with a fantastic 78th-minute free kick.\nLiverpool 0-0 Man Utd - Premier League\nMeetings between these two sides don't always live up to the hype, perfectly exemplified by the drab goalless draw at Anfield during the 2020/21 campaign. Man Utd created the best openings of the game but their profligacy and Alisson's brilliance denied them a crucial win.\nThe Red Devils were top of the table at the time but missed the chance to move further clear of local rivals Manchester City. For Liverpool, it was a sign that they would be in for a tough campaign.\nLiverpool 2-0 Man Utd - Premier League\nThis was the match that made Liverpool fans truly believe that the Premier League title would finally be theirs, with the victory moving the Reds a staggering 16 points above second-placed Man City with a game in hand.\nVirgil van Dijk's towering header had given Liverpool an early lead but Man Utd had shown their teeth with some promising opportunities of their own. As the clock ticked down and the nerves jangled inside Anfield, Alisson's volleyed pass in behind the visitors' backline was latched on to by Salah in stoppage time, with the winger keeping his cool to secure all three points.",
