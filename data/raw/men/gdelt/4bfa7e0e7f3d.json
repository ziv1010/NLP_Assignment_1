  "body_text": "Dull seasons are rare in the recent history of Brighton & Hove Albion.\nThe last decade has packed in a promotion near-miss, reaching the Premier League, eight years in the top division spent under four managers while progressing from regulars in the bottom six in the table to the top 10, plus a first taste of UEFA competition.\nAdvertisement\nThat is reflected by the variety of questions posed by subscribers for our mailbag. Here, our correspondent, Andy Naylor, attempts to answer them, addressing everything from the futures of Kaoru Mitoma and Evan Ferguson, the job done so far by head coach Fabian Hurzeler, the recruitment model and areas of the squad that need strengthening.\nIs the club optimistic of extending Mitoma or is the writing on the wall? — A.i.G.\nIt is hard to predict what will happen in the summer transfer window, especially with Brighton’s quest for European qualification still in the balance with four games to go. So I will concentrate on what I know as things stand through sources in the player’s camp and at the club (all sources in this article have asked to remain anonymous to protect relationships).\nMitoma is very happy at Brighton. The unflustered way the club is run from the top is a perfect fit for his personality and he continues to thrive on the pitch.\nHe has zero interest in a money-motivated move to the Saudi Pro League, while the rejected offers from Al Nassr of £54million ($72.1m) and £61m in the January window leave the club in a strong position.\nMitoma is under contract until June 2027. There are bigger clubs in the Premier League and in Europe able to afford significant fees, but the number of potential suitors reduces when taking into consideration how many of those clubs need a left-winger and pursue a transfer model that would see them paying a large sum for a player who turns 28 later this month.\nThere is also Mitoma’s commercial value, stemming from the explosion of interest in the club in his native Japan and Asia in general, to take into account in what would represent a fair price and a good deal overall.\nMitoma is ambitious, but he also appreciates what he has at Brighton. Qualifying for Europe would improve the chances that he stays.\nDo we have the squad depth to improve on our last European campaign or is the risk of suffering significantly in the league again the same? — Simon C\nClubs with far bigger resources than Brighton have felt the impact of the addition of European football on their league form. Newcastle dropped by 11 points and three places to seventh last season after competing in the Champions League. Aston Villa are on course to suffer a similar fate this time around.\nAdvertisement\nThe squad does have more depth, but not as much quality and experience in the first-choice XI as the group that reached Europe under Roberto De Zerbi in 2022-23.\nThe achievement of winning a Europa League group the following year containing Marseille, Ajax and AEK Athens should not be underestimated, even though the first leg tie at Roma in the last 16 went horribly wrong with that 4-0 defeat.\nBrighton are more likely this time to qualify for the Europa Conference League. The third tier competition brings benefits and disadvantages — more chance of a deep run, but more draining travel to far-flung European outposts.\nWhat is Fabian’s tactical vision for our team as you see it? I still can’t tell if he has one. Will there ever be “Hurzeler Ball”? — Garrett C\nIntensity with and without the ball, combined with controlling games in possession.\nWe have seen it in patches, but not consistently. There are good reasons for that. This is an inexperienced squad which has been ravaged by injuries. The constant chopping and changing has made it difficult for players to build connections with each other to enhance fluidity.\nI was struck by Hurzeler saying during the sequence of six straight wins, which followed the 7-0 debacle at Nottingham Forest, that the players were getting there but they were still not fit enough.\nIt is still early days in his tenure; it remains a work in progress. It is far too soon to make cast-iron judgments.\nDo you think Fabian has learned and adjusted to managing in the Premier League throughout the year? And in what ways do you think he can continue to learn and grow if he is to become a permanent fixture in the PL? — David M.\nI don’t know about you, David, but I am still learning through life experiences and I am knocking on towards 62, not 32! He’s had plenty of those in his first year.\nAdvertisement\nMistakes are part of the journey. The important bit is not to keep on repeating them. The fluctuating experiences in Hurzeler’s first season both as a head coach in England and at elite level will stand him in good stead going forward. He has a hunger for self-improvement.\nDo you think the decision makers at Brighton view this year’s defensive weaknesses as a feature or a bug? In other words, are they willing to continue conceding goals as part of a high risk/high reward style of play, or do they see defence as an area to be improved, whether through recruitment, fewer injuries, or tactics? — Anonymous\nEvery end of season is accompanied by analysis internally of areas where there is room for improvement. It cannot be any other way in the fiercely competitive environment of the Premier League. If you stand still, you go backwards.\nThe past three seasons in which Brighton have progressed from a bottom-six club into a top-half club are a useful barometer. More goals (55) have been conceded in 34 games than in the 38 when qualifying for Europe in sixth place under De Zerbi in 2022-23 (53) and when finishing ninth under Graham Potter in 2021-22 (44).\nThe current leakage rate also leaves Hurzeler’s side on course to exceed the 62 conceded last season, when the drop to 11th for De Zerbi’s team was accompanied by the distraction and extra strain of the Europa League.\nThat the team is saddled with the worst defensive record of any team in the top 12 is a transparent area for gains to be made.\nDefending starts from the front and Hurzeler has been very unlucky with injuries in the back line. However, after concentrating on attacking areas in last summer’s big splash on nine new signings, an injection of pace at the other end will assist Hurzeler’s desire to defend with a high line. That tactics has been adjusted by necessity as the season has worn on to fit the personnel at his disposal.\nOne of the most interesting stories for 2025-26 will be who is going to be our goalkeeper and who will be No 2. It’s a big disappointment that Rushworth never played a game and probably never will. What are your thoughts ? — Simon W.\nBart Verbruggen will be No 1 again unless speculation about interest in the 22-year-old Netherlands international from some heavyweight clubs in Europe progresses into a meaningful bid. He has made mistakes, but he is still developing.\nAdvertisement\nThe experienced Jason Steele, 34, fits the bill as a No 2, which leaves no room for 23-year-old Carl Rushworth to satisfy his understandable desire for game time if the status quo continues. I can see him becoming a permanent first choice at a Championship club next season.\nThe depth in the goalkeeping department is impressive, but it is difficult to maintain, with Kjell Scherpen, James Beadle and Tom McGill in a cycle of loan spells. Matters could come to a head this summer with one or two departures.\nOver recent years we have included a handful of experienced Premier League pros in our squad and these have proved to be beneficial additions both on and off the field. Do you think there is any chance that the club will look to bring in Kevin De Bruyne for a season or two? — Mark H\nWages and competition for his services might be an issue!\nMats Hummels was a target before choosing what has turned out to be the 36-year-old German defender’s final season before retirement at Roma. Jordan Henderson was also a player of interest last year before the midfielder, now 34, moved to Ajax from the Saudi Pro League.\nLosing the versatility and nous of James Milner, 39, to hamstring trouble after starting the first three league games of the season is one of the many injury blows suffered by the head coach.\nAn addition of that ilk is possible this summer after losing Pascal Gross (to Borussia Dortmund) and Adam Lallana (back to Southampton) last year.\nDo the hierarchy view Malick Yalcouye as a squad addition for next season or a further loan? Similarly Ibrahim Osman? — Matthew F\nI am not avoiding a straight answer, but any current view can be impacted by variables — for example a departure opening up a place or a player catching Hurzeler’s eye in pre-season. Who would have expected Yasin Ayari to feature so prominently in midfield this season after modest loan spells in the Championship at Blackburn and Coventry last season?\nAdvertisement\nOf the pair you mention, Malick Yalcouye has done particularly well at Sturm Graz. The 19-year-old Mali midfielder is still raw, but he has the potential to grow into a Premier League player. How soon that happens is hard to tell.\nWhat’s next for Evan Ferguson? My preference would be a loan to a Championship side. What do you think? — Nigel G\nA more beneficial loan than West Ham. That move made sense on paper, but the reunion with Potter in January has not worked out. Ferguson, 20, has made just one start and six substitute appearances out of a possible 10 matches when the idea was to secure more minutes than he had been getting under Hurzeler.\nNo 9 competition at Brighton next season has already increased for the goal-starved Republic of Ireland international with the January window signing of Stefanos Tzimas from Nurnberg in Germany’s second tier. The 19-year-old Greek talent was loaned straight back to Nurnberg. He will link up in July when the players report back for pre-season training.\nIs there any prospect of a movement in the business model towards keeping our standout players for longer before the sale or does the model remain as is? — Nicholas B\nThere is a general misconception that Brighton have an open door policy to sell prized assets for a bumper profit at the drop of a hat. That is not the intention and nothing will change.\nThe price and the circumstances have to be deemed suitable before they are willing to trade. They know where they are in the food chain. The fact is that a move to a bigger and more successful club, if the opportunity presents itself, will be attractive to their players nine times out of 10.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
