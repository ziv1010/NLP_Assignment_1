And City have now broken that golden rule twice.\nIt would be harsh to criticise the Premier League champions' performance, which was outstanding for so long, pinning Real back with a sustained assault in the second half that was eventually rewarded by Kevin De Bruyne's 76th-minute equaliser to cancel out Rodrygo's early strike.\nReal were, literally in many instances, run to a standstill until blessed relief came in the shape of the final whistle and penalties.\nAnd this will be the frustration for City and Guardiola, who thanked his players for their efforts but admitted he must wait to see what condition they are in after a gruelling evening on every level.\nCity's players have shown resilience and staying power before but they will find the manner of their exit, and the loss of the giant trophy they won for the first time against Inter Milan in Istanbul last season, a bitter pill to swallow.\nIt will have taken a heavy mental and physical toll, Guardiola admitting De Bruyne and Erling Haaland told him they could not continue, the striker replaced by Julian Alvarez at the end of 90 minutes and the Belgian taken off during extra time.\nHaaland suffered another tough night, being kept at arm's length by Real's battle-hardened defence apart from when he hit the bar with an early header. There is no shortage of effort from the Norwegian but he is not quite getting the chances he is accustomed to at present.\nIt was all in sharp contrast to Real , and England's, golden boy Jude Bellingham on another landmark night in his young career.\nThis was a testing night for the 20-year-old who has taken Spain by storm this season, suffering just as much as his team-mates and City penned them back and ran them ragged, particularly in the second half.\nAmong this stress, Bellingham twice demonstrated exactly why he is marked down for greatness, even though he was never allowed to show himself at his best.\nBellingham displayed magnificent technique to pull a pass out of the sky in the build-up to Rodrygo's goal then, accompanied by a cacophony of jeers from City's fans, stepped forward to coolly slot home Real's second penalty after Modric's miss.\nIt came after Silva's failure under pressure and shifted the momentum of the shootout back in Real's favour.\nReal go on, as they so often do, and few would bet against them claiming their 15th win in this tournament's different guises as the European Cup and Champions League and giving Ancelotti his fifth triumph.\nAs for City, this will hurt badly but they must bounce back instantly. There is still much to play for.\nOur coverage of Manchester City is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\nListen to the latest We're Not Really Here podcast from BBC Radio Manchester",
