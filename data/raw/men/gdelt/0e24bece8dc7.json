And regarding Semenyo, Liverpool do NOT expect Salah to depart next month, meaning ‘there wouldn’t be a space in the squad [for Semenyo] to fill.’\nIsak’s injury will sideline the striker for up to three months, meaning the Swede will return for the latter stages of Liverpool’s season.\nAs such, and despite growing links to new strikers, the expectation is Liverpool won’t move for a new No 9 in January.\nDoing so would leave Liverpool with three strikers vying for one spot when Isak returns, and Liverpool are not a club who make panic, short-term buys.\nSo… will Liverpool make any deals?\nHarvey Elliott could return from his disastrous loan spell at Aston Villa. There is no recall clause in his deal, however, meaning the two clubs must negotiate the return from scratch.\nLiverpool are weighing up whether to send Trey Nyoni out on loan. Doing so would give the youngster a chance to play regular first-team football, but only if he lands at the right club who are willing to throw the teenager in at the deep end.\nLiverpool would not want Nyoni to leave on loan and spend the second half of the season rooted to the bench or playing sparingly. In that scenario, the Reds would rather he continues developing in-house.\nTrent Kone-Doherty and Rhys Williams were listed by The Athletic as others Liverpool could loan out next month.\nREAD MORE: Grading the 8 Liverpool players Arne Slot let go by how they’re faring in 2025-26",
