Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nCarvajal, who missed the game after undergoing knee surgery in October, made a beeline Saka and grabbed the Arsenal winger around the neck while he spoke to him.\nBut as Saka went to walk away, Carvajal held the 23-year-old by the arm and refused to let go before a member of Arsenal’s backroom staff stepped in to intervene.\nIn the closing stages of the game, Carvajal was seen watching the match from one of the corporate boxes at the Bernabeu.\nAccording to Marca, Carvajal confronted Saka because he was unhappy with the Arsenal winger’s ‘disrespectful’ decision to take a Panenka penalty against Madrid at the Bernabeu.\nBut Carvajal, who scored a Panenka penalty in a shootout against Croatia in Spain’s Nations League final win in 2023, now faces punishment from UEFA for his clash with Saka.\nMore Trending\nAs Carvajal was injured, he was not included in Madrid’s squad for the game against Arsenal and should not have been allowed in the technical area at any point during the match.\nIn 2014, Xabi Alonso was given a one-game ban by UEFA for his touchline celebration in the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid.\nAlonso was unable to play in the final due to suspension and was not permitted to be on the bench during the game as he was not in the squad.\nThe former Liverpool midfielder was subsequently suspended for Madrid’s Super Cup final against Sevilla.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Arsenal star slammed for utter ‘madness’ despite brilliant Real Madrid performance\nMORE: Mikel Arteta ‘wanted to slap’ Arsenal star after what he did against Real Madrid",
