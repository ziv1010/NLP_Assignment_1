We work so hard every single day, and we have wanted to win this trophy for so long,” Man City captain Ilkay Gundogan said.\n“The Champions League is a beautiful competition, and we are all incredibly happy to have won. This team deserves the highest recognition and winning the Champions League elevates us to the very top of the game.\n“And to win the Treble is something amazing. It is the ultimate achievement for any club team, and we have done it. It reflects the quality we have in our squad, but it also shows how dedicated we are.\n“I want to thank the Manchester City fans for their support this season. I can honestly say that we could not have done this without them. They have been amazing, and they deserve this moment.”\n🏆 Premier League\n— Premier League (@premierleague) June 10, 2023\n🏆 FA Cup\n🏆 UEFA Champions League@ManCity have completed an historic Treble! 👏 pic.twitter.com/VgaqKMbTjU\nIt was one of a few clear-cut opportunities for both sides, though City could have led earlier had Erling Haaland converted in the first half.\nHe could only shoot straight at Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana after being played in by Kevin De Bruyne.\nThe task also became tougher for Pep Guardiola's side when De Bruyne was forced off shortly before the break.\nDespite this, Rodri would ensure City would not face heartbreak again, after losing the 2021 Champions League final to Chelsea.\nThere were several scares for the Premier League champions though, as Federico Dimarco's header hit the bar moments after City went in front.\nAnd an even bigger chance fell to Romelu Lukaku, whose header from six yards out was thwarted by Ederson.\nThis. Save. pic.twitter.com/rLQ4N0xBHp\n— Premier League (@premierleague) June 10, 2023\nThe Brazilian then produced a flying save to deny Robin Gosens from an Inter corner in the final seconds.\nCity's success also means they win a first European trophy since securing the Cup Winners Cup in 1970, and it caps off a superb season for English clubs in Europe following West Ham United's win in the UEFA Europa Conference League.",
