However, there’s plenty of bumps in the road for Spurs to overcome before then.\nIndeed, Micky van de Ven and James Maddison have both been ruled out until the new year through injury.\nElsewhere, Yves Bissouma, Pape Sarr (both AFCON) and Son Heung-min (Asian Cup) will be absent for up to a month in early 2024.\nSon’s absence will hit hard, forcing Richarlison – if recovered from groin surgery – into the No 9 role.\nThat’ll leave Ange Postecoglou light out wide and per The Independent, a new winger is wanted in January.\nThe Independent stated Spurs are monitoring Juventus’ Samuel Iling-Junior. However, a more readymade fit would come in the form of former Celtic ace Jota.\nThe 24-year-old is known to Ange Postecoglou through his time in Glasgow and Jota was a revelation during his two-year stint at Celtic.\nJota was sold to Saudi Arabian side Al-Ittihad for £25m in July. However, he’s barely got a look-in thus far and various reports all agree he’s already angling for a return to Europe.\nTEAMtalk has confirmed Tottenham hold an interest in forging a reunion between Postecoglou and Jota in north London.\nFootball Insider later claimed Spurs would only pursue the move if Jota was made available via the loan route. Now, according to The Daily Record, that’s exactly what has happened.\nJota to Tottenham a match made in heaven\nCiting information coming out of Saudi Arabia, The Daily Record declare ‘forgotten Jota will reportedly be allowed to leave Al-Ittihad on loan in January’.\nThe decision comes amid Al-Ittihad being on the cusp of replacing Nuno Espirito Santo with Argentine Marcelo Gallardo.\nGallardo will not stand in Jota’s way if intent on leaving the club in January. Per the report, Al-Ittihad’s decision-makers are now ‘open to a loan move away’.\nA seemingly perfect move is therefore available for the making for all involved.\nREAD MORE: The five Tottenham players who are out of contract at the end of the 2023-24 season\nJota wants to return to Europe and would be joining a club potentially entrenched in a Premier League title race.\nTottenham would be landing short-term cover in the forward line without having to make a long-term commitment.\nPostecoglou would be reunited with a forward he trusts and knows the Australian’s system like the back of his hand.\nJota plays primarily on the left wing, though his two-footedness allows him to operate on either flank with ease.\nThe Portuguese notched 28 goals and 26 assists during 82 appearances for Celtic. He won three separate Player of the Month awards while in the SPL.\nDON’T MISS: Tottenham star’s career labelled ‘over’, with Daniel Levy to sanction hasty January exit",
