The tournament is just a couple of weeks away, and soccer fans are ready to witness the top nations in Europe battle it out for a spot in the finals at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany. Elite football stars worldwide, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappe, Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham, and many more, will represent their nations when the contest starts on June 14, 2024.\nAfter a three-year break, Euro 2024 coverage is back on RotoBaller. Our dedicated team is ready to bring you comprehensive coverage, from Group Previews to the fantasy game and the day-to-day action of DFS during the tournament.\nDon't miss out on our extensive Euro 2024 coverage. This is just one of our six group previews. You can access the other five previews and the rest of our Euro 2024 coverage here on RotoBaller.\nOverview: Group C\nIt's already a foregone conclusion that England will win the group. But with potentially two more qualification spots for the second round available, Group C appears to have plenty of intrigue. Denmark will expect to make it past the group stage and will be wanting to avenge its semi-final defeat to England three years ago.\nThis will be Slovenia's first appearance at the Euros since 2000, while Serbia is making its first appearance as an independent state. England's 1-0 victory over Croatia in its opening game of the last Euro was the first time it had won its opening game at the competition. A slow start this year may throw the group wide open.\nSchedule\nEngland\nBettings Odds (Bet365)\nWin Group: -250\nAdvance: -2500\nWin Euro 2024: +300\nPlayer to Watch: Jude Bellingham - Midfielder, Real Madrid\nBellingham is coming off arguably the best season by an English player in a foreign league. He was La Liga's Player of the Season and inspired Real Madrid to a League and Champions League double. At just 20 years old, Bellingham already has 29 international caps and will go into the tournament having scored 23 goals and assisted 13 in all competitions for Real Madrid. Not bad for a debut season and the eyes of the world will be on England's newest superstar.\nAt just 20 years old, Jude Bellingham has:\nWon the Champions League\nWon La Liga\nWon the DFB-Pokal\nWon La Liga POTS\nWon the Golden Boy award\nScored a brace in El Clásico\nScored at the World CupWHAT. A. PLAYER. 🤩 pic.twitter.com/i4CaZ7OTEc\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) June 1, 2024\nPrediction: Win Group; Losing in the Final\nEngland has arguably the best attacking options in the world right now. It can boast the La Liga (Bellingham), Bundesliga (Harry Kane), and Premier League (Phil Foden) Players of the Season. That trio doesn't include Bukayo Saka, who has been England's Player of the Year for the last two seasons. Kane is England's record goal-scorer (63 goals) and scored 44 goals in 45 games for Bayern Munich this season. He could be supported by Saka, Foden, and Cole Palmer in attack, who combined for 90 goals and assists in the EPL this season.\nThen there's Bellingham and Declan Rice (coming off his best season) rounding out the midfield. The concern is the defense and that is ultimately what could let England down. Head coach Gareth Southgate isn't offensively minded and likely won't be able to get the best out of England's attacking players. That is ultimately what is set to lead to more heartbreak for England. It has the best squad in years, the best attacking players in European football, and should be able to win its first major trophy in 58 years. Unless it plays to its strengths, more disappointment is afoot.\nDenmark\nBettings Odds (Bet365)\nWin Group: +400\nAdvance: -300\nWin Euro 2024: +4000\nPlayer to Watch: Rasmus Højlund - Forward, Manchester United\nHøjlund didn't have the best debut season at Manchester United. He did end the season as an FA Cup winner and scored 10 goals in 25 EPL games, so it wasn't a bad season. Højlund did shine for Denmark in the qualifiers, scoring seven goals in eight games (six starts). Five of those goals came in his first two games and this will be a big step up in quality for the young forward. His success will come down to the level of service he gets. Højlund represents the new generation of Danish football, so he will have to carry some additional weight on his shoulders.\nPrediction: Advance; Losing in the Round of 16\nAfter suffering near tragedy three years ago when Christian Eriksen collapsed on the pitch, Denmark almost made a remarkable run to the final. England needed extra time to beat it in the semi-finals but Denmark does have a good record of reaching the latter stages at the Euro. The 1992 champions have now made it to the last four on three occasions, although three years ago was the first time since 2004 in which they had reached the knockout stage.\nThree years after suffering a cardiac arrest on the pitch, Christian Eriksen will feature again for Denmark at the EUROs 🥹\nThe football world united around Eriksen as he recovered and eventually made his return to club football in February 2022.\nA month later, he returned to… pic.twitter.com/XLpr6U6oEq\n— Optus Sport (@OptusSport) May 31, 2024\nEfficient and generally difficult to beat, Denmark should have enough to get out of the group stages. The problem could come in the Round of 16 as the runners-up in the group will face the winners of Group A. That is set to be Germany. There's a lot of football to take place before that possibility and Germany isn't the powerhouse of the past. Unless they can win the group or Germany fails to, an early exit looks on the cards for the Danes.\nSerbia\nBettings Odds (Bet365)\nWin Group: +800\nAdvance: -175\nWin Euro 2024: +8000\nPlayer to Watch: Dušan Tadić - Forward, Fenerbahçe\nAt 35 years old, this could be the last tournament Tadić features in. The Serbian captain had four assists (eight games) in qualifying and continues to be one of the most consistent players in European football. His first season in Turkey saw Tadić hit double figures in goals and assists for the sixth consecutive season. He's averaged 14.5 goals and 15.7 assists in the league during that period. Serbia's best route to goals may come from Tadić's set-piece delivery and he should be its most creative player in open play. He's certainly got an eye for the goal and can score from anywhere.\nDusan Tadic with a stunning strike 🚀pic.twitter.com/IUzWpJnLoK\n— 𝗪𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗲𝘀 (@widescores_com) April 3, 2024\nPrediction - Eliminated in the Group Stage\nSerbia had arguably the easiest qualifying group and still had to settle for second place to reach the Euro. It won four of its eight games with the victories coming against Montenegro and Lithuania, who rank 70th and 127th, respectively, in the FIFA World Rankings. Serbia conceded nine goals in its final six qualifiers and lost both games to Hungary, the only nation ranked inside the top 30 in its group. Its chances of qualification might come down to its second game against Slovenia and there's no guarantee third place will be enough to get through the group stage.\nSlovenia\nBettings Odds (Bet365)\nWin Group: +1000\nAdvance: +125\nWin Euro 2024: +25000\nPlayer to Watch: Benjamin Šeško - Forward, RB Leipzig\nŠeško top scored for Slovenia in the qualifiers with five goals (nine games). After helping RB Leipzig to a fourth-place finish in the Bundesliga, the forward has been strongly linked to a move to Arsenal this summer. His 14 goals and two assists in 31 games (17 starts) caught the eye of many top European clubs. If he isn't signed before the Euro, there's every chance he'll add a few million euros to his price tag if he shines in Germany. His pace on counter-attacks will be crucial if Slovenia can progress to the knockout stage.\nThe Daily Mirror is reporting RB Leipzig's striker Benjamin Šeško is interested in joining Arsenal, and Tottenham have 11 players available for transfer 😮👇 pic.twitter.com/kSEcHCmEXa\n— Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) May 31, 2024\nPrediction - Advance; Losing in the Round of 16\nAt 48th in the FIFA World Rankings, Slovenia is the lowest-ranked nation in Group C. However, it finished level on points with Denmark in its qualifying group, only finishing second due to its head-to-head record. It managed to draw with Denmark in the qualifiers and recently beat Portugal in a friendly. Slovenia knows it can get a result against Denmark in its opening game. Its final group game is against England, who could already have qualified as group winners. The schedule is ideal and it could be a dark horse to reach the Round of 16. That is likely as far as it goes.\nFantasy Preview\nOur very own The FPL Manual is breaking down each group with his threads on X.
