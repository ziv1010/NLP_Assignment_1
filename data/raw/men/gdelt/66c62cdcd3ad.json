Whilst Tiga were more methodical and cautious, keeping hold of possession and building field position with shorter passes.\nFresh from scoring a hat-trick in the final game of the group stage, Hekari tried to get Rex Naime involved as much as possible. He injected himself into the action straight from the kick-off, powering a long-range effort just wide of the bottom-right corner inside 10 seconds.\nTiga felt as though they had found a way to nullify his threat as the first half progressed, until the speedy winger found the back of the net in the 27th minute.\nNaime raced onto a pinpoint long ball from Lucas Santos, before sprinting into the box and smashing the ball past Thomas Schmidt, with the help of the underside of the crossbar.\nTiga pressed higher in search of an equaliser after conceding, and Hekari had Dave Tomare to thank for sending them into half-time with the lead.\nThe goalkeeper pulled off one of the saves of the tournament, getting down to parry Mickaël Partodikromo’s bullet header onto the left post with a strong left hand.\nLeonardo Lopez’s side continued to be caught out by long balls over the top in the second half though, and it cost them a man in the 52nd minute, when Wadria Hanye received a red card. The defender collided with Ati Kepo near the edge of his own box, and referee Campbell-Kirk Kawana-Waugh reduced Tiga to ten men.\nNaime was keen to capitalise on the advantage soon after, forcing Schmidt to rush off his line and parry away in a one-on-one situation inside the box.\nDesperate and fatigued with just 10 men on the park, Tiga’s hopes of reaching the final began to slip away from them.\nDespite a number of attacking set-pieces, they struggled to carve out any late chances for an equaliser, as Erick Joe led the Hekari defensive effort.\nAfter a nervy twelve-minute period of injury-time, the final whistle was met by wild celebrations from those in in Hekari United FC colours, who are now scheduled to meet Auckland City FC in the final at the National Stadium on Saturday.\nHekari United FC 1 (Rex NAIME 27’)\nAS Tiga Sport 0\nHT 1-0\nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz\nOriginal url",
