Osimhen was ranked in the 8th position last year.\nLookman is however the only African player that made the award nomination list this year.\nLookman was in scintillating form as Atalanta won its first-ever European trophy last season, with the Nigerian scoring a hat-trick in the Europa League final against Bayer Leverkusen.\nHe scored scored 17 goals and made 11 assists in all for Atalanta last season.\nThe former Everton player was also instrumental in the Super Eagles run to the final of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cote d’Ivoire early this year.\nHe scored two goals as the Nigerian team finished as runners up in the competition after losing 2-1 to the hosts in the final.\nIn the new season, Lookman has picked up from where he stopped last season, recording 5 goals, 3 assists so far. One of the goals is for Nigeria against Benin Republic in Africa Cup of Nation’s qualifier.\nLookman has also been shortlisted by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) for the 2024 African Footballer of the Year award.\nThis year’s Ballon d’Or list is dominated by players from the Spanish national team which won the Euro 2024 in the summer and the Real Madrid team that won the UEFA Champions League.\nSpanish and Manchester City midfielder is strong favourite to emerge the winner of the Award this year.\nCHANNELS TV",
