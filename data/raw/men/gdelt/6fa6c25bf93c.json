The continent's finest football talent will descend on the tiny country that hosted the 2022 World Cup for a month from January 12.\nJordan's route to the Asian Cup final is stunning. The Jordanians' 3-2 defeat of in-form Iraq in the last 16 was all the more impressive for being 2-1 down going into injury time but goals from Yazan Al-Arab and Nizar Al-Rashdan in the fifth and seventh minutes of stoppage time respectively pulled off the most improbable of victories for the Chivalrous.\nBeating Tajikistan in the last eight made the semi-finalists for the first time but that was nothing compared with the 2-0 defeat of Jurgen Klinsmann's South Korea in the last four. Yazan al-Naimat, who had scored in the 2-2 draw between the sides in the group stages, was again on target as Jordan reached a first final without conceding so much as a shot on target.\nIn the final, Jordan will face defending champions and hosts Qatar, who retain many of the players that represented their country with great pride at the World Cup just over a year ago. Attacking pair Almoez Ali and Akram Afif were electric in winning this tournament four years ago and have again impressed as the Maroons topped Group A with three wins out of three, then beat Palestine 2-1 to make the last eight.\nThey beat Uzbekistan on penalties to reach the last four, before a trilling 3-2 semi-final defeat of Iran that was arguably the game of the tournament. The Maroons fell to Sardar Azmoun's fourth-minute opener but fought back to lead 2-1 through goals from Jassem Gaber and Afif only to be pegged back to 2-2. Then Ali struck the winner eight minutes from time to secure back-to-back finals for the Qataris.\nTo keep up to date with the tournament as it progresses, keep scrolling down for all the latest news, groups, teams, mascots and much more for the Asian Cup 2023.\nNext Asian Cup 2023 games\nWho is playing next in the Asian Cup 2023?\nSaturday February 10\nJordan vs Qatar 3pm GMT / 10am ET / 7am PT / 2am AEDT (Sun)\nAfter a month, 22 teams fallen by the wayside and 49 matches, we're finally here – the Asian Cup 2023 final. Tournament hosts and defending champions Qatar were among the favorites four weeks ago, but the presence of Jordan in their first continental final is an opponent few would have expected four weeks ago. And isn't that what the Asian Cup is all about?\nJordan have been the revelation of this year's tournament. The Chivalrous' playmaker-in-chief Yazan Al-Naimat scored the opening goal in his country's stunning 2-0 semi-final victory over pre-tournament favorites South Korea and has excelled throughout in coach Hussein Ammouta's impressive side in transition. Two-one down to Iraq going into quarter-final injury time, they showed incredible resilience to score twice and turn defeat into improbably victory. Could they do so again?\nHaving cruised through the early stages of the tournament, Qatar have had to show real grit in the quarter-finals and last four. The Maroons needed penalties to dispose of a spirited Uzbekistan in the last eight, then had to come from behind for the first time at an Asian Cup finals since 2015 to knock out Iran in a topsy-turvy semi-final 3-2. Akram Afif has been excellent all tournament, but strike partner Almoez Ali's winner last time out was his first and may spark the star forward into life.\nFREE Asian Cup 2023 live streams\nHow to watch Asian Cup 2023 for FREE in Australia\nFootball fans Down Under can catch every Socceroos fixture at the Asian Cup 2023, plus the semi-finals and final, for FREE in Australia, courtesy of Network 10 and the broadcaster's streaming service 10Play.\nUse a VPN to watch free on 10Play or from abroad.\nAll you need to do to tune into the live stream of the Asian Cup 2023 on 10Play to register for an account first.
