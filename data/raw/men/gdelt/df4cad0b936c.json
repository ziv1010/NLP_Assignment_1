Why is its format being dictated by the Premier League who represent circa [about] 3% of them? Protest is needed!\" Palios added.\nProfessional Footballers' Association chief executive Maheta Molango said football needs \"a collective approach\" to the global fixture calendar and \"not a fight for available dates\".\nHe added: \"The current unsustainable approach to the calendar needs to be seen as an issue for every club at every level if we want to continue to protect our domestic competitions.\"\nFair Game chief executive Niall Couper said the decision \"deprives lower league clubs of a much-needed source of revenue\" and is a \"short-sighted move that does nothing to strengthen the game\".\nFamily ties, teenage kicks and exhilarating music: A high-octane thriller from Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight\nRomesh Ranganathan's bittersweet comedy gem returns: From lost to found, follow Jonathan's journey as he navigates single parenthood",
