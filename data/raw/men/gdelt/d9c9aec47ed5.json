RTÉ has at least one game live each week, which goes out on RTÉ 2 and the RTÉ Player (also available as a browser player). Meanwhile, Virgin Media TV has the rights to eight matches each week, half of which are available for free on Virgin Media Two and the Virgin Media Play streaming service - which can be used in-browser without registration.\nIn the UK, the final of the Champions League is likely to be shown for free on Discovery+, given the parent broadcaster TNT Sports has opened up the past two finals in this way. You can also get a 30-day free trial with Amazon Prime Video to watch one game per week. You can also watch Champions League highlights for free on the BBC iPlayer and BBC website for the second season in a row.\nElsewhere, DAZN Canada often opens up games for free, when they feature Canadian stars. You can also watch some games for free through Tapmad, which operates in certain Asian territories, including Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. CBC Sport in Azerbaijan also has occasional games for free.\nUse a VPN to watch from anywhere\nGeo-restrictions apply to all major streaming services these days, but that doesn't mean you can't get your usual Champions League coverage if you're overseas.\nAll you need is a VPN (Virtual Private Network), a handy piece of internet security software that can make it look like your device is still back at home. Assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, you can use a VPN to unblock your usual streaming services and enjoy the football wherever you are in the world.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there, but FourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar are big fans of NordVPN.\nDEAL: Up to 77% off NordVPN + 3 months FREE\nTechRadar love NordVPN’s super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS4 and loads more.
