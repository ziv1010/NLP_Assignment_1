Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nLike Isak, Guimaraes is under contract with Newcastle until 2028 but that may not prevent Arsenal from testing the waters as they look to rebuild their midfield.\nArsenal have already reportedly agreed a deal to sign Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi, but could need another marquee signing with both Jorginho and Thomas Partey looking likely to leave the Emirates at the end of the season.\nArsenal’s quest to sign either player will prove difficult, with Isak, in particular, considered unsellable by Newcastle chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan.\nWill Arsenal sign Alexander Isak this summer?\nAll the indicators suggest Arsenal are prepared for a huge summer of investment and will at least test the waters where Isak is concerned.\nThe Gunners kept their powder dry in January when it appeared they were in dire need of attacking reinforcements even before Kai Havertz’s season-ending injury.\nIt will, however, take a fee well in excess of the £100 million Arsenal spent on Declan Rice two years ago to land a player they really ought to have bought as far back as January 2022, following the decision to exile Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.\nWhether it would represent a shrewd decision to spend the farm on a player who would solve the striker conundrum at the Emirates is another question.\nIndeed, Jamie Carragher recently suggested Arsenal’s main issue at present is a lack of creativity and a more sensible course of action might be to sign another winger plus a creative midfielder which would still, in theory, allow Mikel Arteta to sign a centre forward at a more accommodating price.\nIt must be said, as well, that Isak, for his part, has shown absolutely no desire to leave a club who will undoubtedly make him the best paid player in their history should they qualify for next season’s Champions League.\nSpeaking ahead of Sunday’s Wembley final, the Sweden international said: ‘I am not really thinking about the summer yet.\n‘That will be a talking point when the season is finished. No talks have been held yet. I have said many times that I don’t really think too much about my future.\n‘I have said many times I am happy here and we are competing for titles, which is what you want as a football player. We have been to one final and now we are in another one.\n‘The chances are there. We should look at it one season at a time, and this season we can win a trophy.\n‘I have said many times I am focused on doing a job. All of our focus is on Sunday and bringing a trophy back.’\nNothing overly sensationalist in those words, but you could infer that this is a player acutely aware of his own value whose desire might well be to remain at Newcastle should they match his ambition and there is little, on recent evidence, to suggest they can’t.\nJames Goldman | Metro Sports Editor\nThe governor of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment fund was in attendance on Sunday and, according to the Daily Mail, has made clear to Newcastle’s hierarchy that Isak will not be going anywhere and has refused to even set a ball park asking price.\nNewcastle would like to enter into discussions over a new deal and a significant pay rise for Isak, but the player appears to be in no rush, particularly with qualification for next season’s Champions League hanging in the balance.\nMore Trending\nClub legend Alan Shearer, though, has questioned why Isak would want to leave now that Newcastle have finally lifted the trophy monkey from their backs and believes last Sunday’s success could act as a springboard to greater things under Eddie Howe.\nHe told the BBC: ‘Kevin (Keegan) and Sir Bobby (Robson) were both fantastic for the club and both brought different things, but they didn’t bring a trophy. That’s what Newcastle fans have yearned for and now Eddie has done it.\n‘Of course now we want more of the same. I look at what happened at Chelsea after they won their first trophy under Jose Mourinho, the 2005 League Cup, and at Manchester City when they ended their long wait for a trophy with the 2011 FA Cup.\n‘There are no guarantees, obviously, and we don’t know what will happen next but I am really hoping this is just the start of something very special in the years ahead for Newcastle, and that this trophy is the first of many.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Ayden Heaven provides update after Man Utd star stretchered off with injury against Leicester\nMORE: Jean-Philippe Mateta reveals what he texted Millwall goalkeeper after horror challenge\nMORE: Arsenal defender says he wants to learn to play in midfield",
