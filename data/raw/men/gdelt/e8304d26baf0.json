Ange Postecoglou’s Spurs are a fluid, exciting unit when on form but can be porous as sponge when not – the north Londoners conceded 61 league goals last season, only six fewer than 17th-placed Nottingham Forest.\nResults against direct rivals need to improve, particularly at home: Spurs’ 12 defeats in 2023/24 included backyard reverses to Aston Villa, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City – each dealing a key blow to their ambitions and boosting a competitor’s. Playing free-flowing football is nice, but fans demand greater consistency.\nPremier League seasons consist of 38 games. Last time out, Spurs entered November top of the table and unbeaten, with eight victories, two draws and 26 points taken from a possible 30… then an implosion at home to Chelsea on matchday 11 obliterated their form.\nLong-term injuries (sustained during that fiery derby clash) to James Maddison and Micky van de Ven contributed to a five-game winless streak from which the side never truly recovered. Spurs ultimately missed out on Champions League football.\nIf Postecoglou’s side can start just as strongly and maintain that standard this season, they’ll be challenging for more than just European qualification. But can they avoid collapse when inevitable injuries and suspensions strike?\nTottenham squad for 2024/25\nTottenham squad for 2024/25: Ange Postecoglou's full team\n- GK: Guglielmo Vicario\n- GK: Fraser Forster\n- GK: Brandon Austin\n- GK: Alfie Whiteman\n- DF: Sergio Reguilon\n- DF: Radu Dragusin\n- DF: Destiny Udogie\n- DF: Cristian Romero\n- DF: Pedro Porro\n- DF: Djed Spence\n- DF: Ben Davies\n- DF: Ashley Phillips\n- DF: Micky van de Ven\n- MF: Oliver Skipp\n- MF: Yves Bissouma\n- MF: James Maddison\n- MF: Archie Gray\n- MF: Lucas Bergvall\n- MF: Giovani Lo Celso\n- MF: Pape Sarr\n- MF: Rodrigo Bentancur\n- MF: Alfie Devine\n- FW: Son Heung-min\n- FW: Richarlison\n- FW: Timo Werner\n- FW: Dejan Kulusevski\n- FW: Brennan Johnson\n- FW: Manor Solomon\n- FW: Wilson Odobert\n- FW: Dominic Solanke\nTottenham squad numbers for 2024/25\nTottenham manager\nAnge Postecoglou\nAnge Postecoglou made an instant impact after arriving at Spurs from Celtic one year ago, making shrewd signings, implementing a high-octane style of football and wooing a beleaguered fanbase with his no-nonsense personality. The Australian’s dogmatic, attack-no-matter-what philosophy has been widely lauded, though recent jibes about the club’s ambition will have some fans worried.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nTottenham's key player\nSon Heung-min\nSon Heung-min hit 17 goals and 10 assists in the top-flight last term to help fill the goalscoring void left by Harry Kane. Tottenham’s skipper is now the club’s fifth-highest scorer, with 162 strikes, and remains their most potent attacking threat. Arsenal fans aside, who doesn’t love the South Korean?\nOne to watch\nMicky van de Ven\nMicky van de Ven became the quickest Premier League player in history when clocking a top speed of 37.38km/h against Brentford in February, leapfrogging Man City and England speedster Kyle Walker to top spot. The Dutch defender enjoyed a stellar debut campaign and will be desperate to avoid injury and contribute even more this time around.\nThe mood\nGrumbles around exorbitant ticket prices, Daniel Levy’s perceived penny-pinching and a lack of silverware persist, but the current mood is far better than it ever was under Postecoglou’s predecessors Antonio Conte and Jose Mourinho. On their day, this team is capable of serving up the type of football worthy of the club’s magnificent stadium. Whisper it, but there’s belief around Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nMost likely to...\nLeak goals at set pieces. Spurs were among the worst sides in last season’s Premier League when it came to defending dead balls, leading to questions over a lack of dedicated set-piece training. Postecoglou claimed he had “no issue” with the worrying statistics. \"Eventually I will create a team that has success and it won't be because of working on set pieces,\" he sniffed. “I'm just not interested in it. I never have been.”\nLeast likely to...\nWin anything. Since Spurs lifted the 2008 League Cup, 64 of their players and coaches have won more than 200 trophies… at other clubs after leaving Tottenham.\nView from the stands\nRicky Sacks (@RickySacks)\nThe big talking point is whether Ange Postecoglou can be successful at Spurs with the style of football he’s intent on playing.\nThis season will be different because Spurs will be back in Europe – it’ll be interesting to see how serious Ange takes it and how he handles the Thursday-to-Sunday turnaround.\nOur key player will be James Maddison – after a stop-start season, we hope he’ll find his best form and be spurred on by his Euros omission.\nOur most underrated player is Pape Sarr. He offers the midfield plenty of young legs.\nLook out for [young Swedish midfielder] Lucas Bergvall – the youngster was on the verge of joining Barcelona before Spurs swooped in late. He’s viewed as a potential teenage superstar.\nFans think our owner could invest more into the club when you look back at ENIC's stewardship and the decisions they’ve taken when Spurs had the chance to push on.\nThe opposition player I'd love here is Eberechi Eze, and it’s a realistic signing given Spurs need more attacking options and Eze's ability to play more than one role.\nThe opposition player who grinds my gears is Neil Maupay – an average footballer whose only intention is to wind up opposition players and supporters.\nThe active player I'd love to have back is Harry Kane. Spurs scored more goals without him last season – imagine how many they would score with Harry in this team.\nThe player I'd happily drive to another club is I don't need to now, but it was Emerson Royal. Despite his ability to get forward, he isn't good enough competition for Pedro Porro.\nThe thing my club really gets right is work in the community.\nThe one change I'd make would be for the sole focus to be on the football club’s success rather than other financial avenues (motor racing, boxing, concerts).\nOur season ticket prices are extortionate compared to the rest of the Premier League.\nI'm least looking forward to playing Ipswich at Portman Road. It has real banana-skin potential in front of a packed on-top-of-you home crowd.\nThe fans' opinion of the gaffer is mixed. While he plays a brand of football welcomed by a lot of fans, results towards the end of last season were a concern, along with Spurs’ penchant for conceding from set pieces.\nIf he left, he should be replaced by Mauricio Pochettino. There’s still a feeling that, despite joining bitter rivals Chelsea, he has unfinished business at Spurs.\nWe'll finish 4th.\nEd is a staff writer at FourFourTwo, working across the magazine and website.
