Willian\nYear: 2020\nArsenal appearances: 37\nArsenal goals: 1\nWillian enjoyed a successful seven-year spell with Chelsea, winning two Premier League titles, an FA Cup, the League Cup and the Europa League.\nHe wanted to extend his stay at Stamford Bridge beyond the end of the 2019/20 season, but the Blues would not sanction a new three-year deal.\nThe former Brazil international then left Chelsea on a free transfer and found the three-year deal he was after at the Emirates.\nHis Arsenal career got off to an excellent start as he registered two assists in a 3-0 victory over Fulham on the opening day of the 2020/21 season.\nBut that’s as good as it got for the winger, who suffered a woeful drop in form and finished the 2020/21 season with just one goal in 37 appearances in all competitions.\nWillian became a much-maligned figure at the Emirates and agreed to terminate his three-year contract in August 2021 – just 12 months after arriving at the club.\n“Yes it did,” he said when asked if hateful messages from Arsenal fans influenced his decision to leave.\n“I received a lot of messages on social media from them, but also because I came from Chelsea I think if I came from another club maybe the fans would be better.\n“But because I come from Chelsea and I didn’t perform well and because of them, I think about that and I have to go.”\nDidier Drogba couldn’t resist after Willian left Arsenal 🤭 pic.twitter.com/NFryFL8AOx\n— ESPN UK (@ESPNUK) September 1, 2021\n8. Lassana Diarra\nYear: 20\nArsenal appearances: 13\nArsenal goals: 0\nDiarra won Chelsea’s Young Player of the Year award in 2005/06, but he failed to usurp Claude Makelele and made just 31 appearances for the club.\nThe midfielder decided to leave Stamford Bridge in search of more first-team football and joined Arsenal on transfer deadline day in 2007.\nBut he was also unable to establish himself at the Emirates, featuring only 13 times in all competitions before joining Portsmouth in a £5.5million deal in January 2008.\n“I did not learn anything from [Arsene] Wenger,” he said when reflecting on his unhappy four-and-a-half-month stint at Arsenal. “He just taught me to doubt everything. The relationship I had with him was not good.\n“You cannot understand the whole world. I respect the way you train, but I learned more with [Jose] Mourinho. Mourinho taught me to fight. I spoke looking into his eyes.\n“If you had a problem, it would be discussed. Wenger never addressed me until I told him I was going. He talked to others, but not me. I feel like I never played for Arsenal. If people do not remind me of them [Arsenal], I forget about them. It’s erased from my memory.”\n7. Raheem Sterling\nYear: 2024\nArsenal appearances: 28\nArsenal goals: 1\nAfter being deemed surplus to requirements by Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca, Sterling joined Arsenal on transfer deadline day on a season-long loan deal.\nThe move to north London saw him reunite with Mikel Arteta, having previously worked under the Spanish coach during his time at Manchester City.\n“We all know Raheem’s qualities, he is a top talent with a lot of experience who can help the team in a big way,” Arteta said.\nBut the England international was unable to show those qualities in an Arsenal shirt, registering just one goal and five assists in 28 appearances for the club.\nThe Gunners decided not to pursue a permanent move for the winger, and he returned to Chelsea at the end of the 2024/25 season.\n6. Yossi Benayoun\nYear: 2011\nArsenal appearances: 25\nArsenal goals: 6\nThirteen years before Sterling, Benayoun also left Chelsea and completed a season-long loan move to Arsenal on transfer deadline day.\n“I first heard about the interest from Arsenal eight days before the end of the window and when I knew they wanted me it was an easy choice,” he said.\n“I had a few good options from clubs in England and outside but as soon as I heard about Arsenal my mind was made up.”\nThe midfielder initially struggled to break into Wenger’s team in the first half of the 2011/12 season but proved to be a useful addition for the Gunners.\nHe produced his best performances in an Arsenal shirt during a 5-2 win over Tottenham and a 1-0 win over Manchester City. His displays in both games saw him receive standing ovations from the Emirates faithful.\nThe winger also scored in a 3-2 win over West Brom on the final day of the Premier League season, which helped Arsenal finish above Tottenham and secure Champions League qualification.\nBut his overall record of six goals and three assists in 25 appearances in all competitions wasn’t enough to earn him a permanent deal at the Emirates.\n5. David Luiz\nYear: 2019\nArsenal appearances: 73\nArsenal goals: 4\nAfter being deemed surplus to requirements by the then-Chelsea manager Frank Lampard, Luiz joined Arsenal in an £8million deal.\nHis two seasons at the Emirates were punctuated by a catalogue of errors, most notably in that cameo performance away at Manchester City in the first match of project restart.\nRemarkably, the centre-back earned three red cards and conceded six penalties during his 53 Premier League appearances for the Gunners. In comparison, he received just one red card and gave away three penalties during 160 league games for Chelsea.\nBut Luiz did play a key role in Arsenal’s FA Cup success in 2019/20, producing a Man of the Match performance against Manchester City in the semi-final before helping the Gunners beat Chelsea in the final.\nThe former Brazil international also brought a wealth of experience into the dressing room and some of the young stars at Arsenal have praised him for assisting their development.\nBukayo Saka says David Luiz made the most impact on his career so far:\n🗣 “David did so much, he went out of his way for us [Young players], advice on and off the pitch. He was a really good guy.” [@sportbible]. pic.twitter.com/txdGOX3QoK\n— Connor Humm (@TikiTakaConnor) November 26, 2021\n4. William Gallas\nYear: 20o5\nArsenal appearances: 142\nArsenal goals: 17\nGallas played a key role in Chelsea’s early success under Jose Mourinho, helping the club win back-to-back Premier League titles in 2004/05 and 2005/06.\nBut things eventually turned sour and he reportedly threatened to score an own goal if he was selected for Chelsea’s first game of the 2006/07 season.\nThe centre-back then moved to Arsenal on transfer deadline day as part of the deal that saw Ashley Cole go in the opposite direction.\nHis time at the Emirates is best remembered for that strop on the pitch at Birmingham City in February 2008, but he did a decent job for the Gunners.\nThe former France international made 142 appearances in all competitions and also scored 17 goals, including a winner against Chelsea in December 2007.\nHe left on a free transfer at the end of the 2009/10 season and joined Tottenham – making him the first man to have played for Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.\n3. Kai Havertz\nYear: 2023\nArsenal appearances: 87\nArsenal goals: 29\nDespite scoring the winning goal in the 2021 Champions League final, Havertz failed to live up to expectations during his three-year stint at Chelsea.\nEyebrows were raised when Arsenal decided to fork out an initial £60million and another £5million in potential add-ons to sign him in the summer of 2023.\nThe Germany international endured a slow start to life in north London as he struggled to adapt to his role as a No.8 in Arteta’s midfield.\nBut he flourished as a centre‑forward in the second half of his debut season, finishing the campaign with 14 goals and eight assists in all competitions.\nThe 26-year-old registered 20 direct goal contributions in 2024/25 but now faces a fight for his place in the first team due to the impending arrival of Viktor Gyokeres.\n2. Jorginho\nYear: 2023\nArsenal appearances: 79\nArsenal goals: 2\nJorginho made 213 appearances for Chelsea and won the Champions League, Europa League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup at Stamford Bridge.\nAfter trying to sign the midfielder in the summer of 2020, Mikel Arteta finally brought him to Arsenal in January 2023 in a deal worth an initial £10million and another £2million in add-ons.\n“I want to say too, the warm welcome from the fans as well was so important for me, because I need to be honest, you know, coming from Chelsea, I was like, ‘OK, let’s see what’s going to happen here.’ I made the decision that I will be myself and hope they like me,” he said.\n“Then as soon as I arrived, I could feel the warm —really warm— welcome from the people in the training ground, from the fans on the streets, at the stadium, on social media.\n“It made it so easy for me to feel integrated. It was really nice, and now I’m here, I try to help the new players have that same journey.”\nThe Italy international proved to be an astute signing and his leadership qualities saw him handed the captain’s armband on multiple occasions.\nHe made 79 appearances in all competitions during his two-and-a-half-year stint with the Gunners before joining Flamengo on a free transfer.\nJorginho 👉 Saka 👉 Trossard #UCL pic.twitter.com/PeN7Gb3dRX\n— UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) June 17, 2024\n1. Petr Cech\nYear: 2015\nArsenal appearances: 139\nArsenal goals conceded: 158\nCech established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the world during his 11 years at Chelsea and won 15 trophies, including four Premier League titles and the Champions League.\nAfter he lost his place in the team to Thibaut Courtois in the 2014/15 season, the Gunners offered him a chance to stay in London.\n“He [Roman Abramovich] wasn’t too happy, and didn’t want to see me in that [Arsenal] shirt, but he knew I’d done everything for his club,” he said.\n“I expressed the reasons why, and he kind of closed his eyes and said: ‘OK, you can go.’ I was nervous because I didn’t have a plan B.”\nHe enjoyed an impressive debut season at Arsenal, keeping 16 clean sheets in the Premier League and winning the Golden Glove as the Gunners finished second.\nThe former Czech Republic international added another FA Cup and two Community Shields to his CV but errors began to creep into his game as his time at Arsenal wore on.\nHe also struggled to adapt to Unai Emery’s style of playing out from the back and was eventually usurped by Bernd Leno during the 2018/19 campaign.\nCech’s final game for the Gunners was the 2019 Europa League final against Chelsea but his old side put four goals past him to win the trophy.\nREAD MORE: The 10 most expensive Arsenal sales of all time, with Liverpool deal in top spot",
