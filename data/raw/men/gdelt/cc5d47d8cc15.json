  "body_text": "BRUSSELS — EU Sport Commissioner Glenn Micallef said there’s no way a flagship European event like football’s Champions League final should ever be held outside the continent.\nThere have been persistent suggestions for years that the annual iconic game — which this year takes place on Saturday in Munich between Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain — could one day head to the U.S., where football is a growing market, or big-spending Saudi Arabia.\n“These are European competitions and European competitions should be played in Europe, I think that’s quite clear.
