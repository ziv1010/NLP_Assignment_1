  "body_text": "FOOTBALL – BAHRAIN’S Al Khaldiya arrived yesterday in Tabriz, Iran, to take on hosts Tractor FC in the second leg of their round-of-16 clash in the 2024-25 AFC Champions League (ACL) Two.\nThe match is scheduled for tomorrow evening with a 5pm kick-off, Bahrain time, at Yadegar-E-Imam Stadium.\nThe two-time defending Bahrain league champions have an uphill task ahead of them in their away fixture, having lost the first leg 1-2 last week at home. Mohammed Al Rumaihi scored the game’s opening goal for Khaldiya but then Tractor’s Amirhossein Hosseinzadeh and Croatian Domagoj Drozdek were on target to give the Iranians the win and the all-important two away goals.\nThe victors in this round-of-16 head-to-head will move on to the ACL Two quarter-finals, which are scheduled for next month. The semi-finals will then be held in April before the tournament culminates in a single-game final on May 17. The ACL Two is the second-tier club competition of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). Rebranded from the AFC Cup, it is one level below the AFC Champions League Elite and one above the AFC Challenge League.",
