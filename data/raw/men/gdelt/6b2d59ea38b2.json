The rest of the opening-week games will be split across Wednesday and Thursday.\n“The reigning champions will get their title defense underway in a standalone fixture in front of their home fans,” the statement said.\nThe tenders offer launched on Monday also includes four-year deals for the five main media markets in Europe: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.\nRelevent also promises “new approaches to sponsorship” likely drawing in a wider range of buyers to game broadcasts.\nThe 800-member EFC group, UEFA and Relevent hope to top at least 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) in total revenue from broadcast, sponsor and licensing deals for European club competitions each season from 2027-28.\nRevenue is at least 4.4 billion euros for each of the three seasons through 2027, which pays almost 2.5 billion euros into the prize money fund shared by the 36 Champions League teams.\nThe second-tier Europa League pays 565 million euros ($653 million) in total prize money this season and the third-tier Conference League is worth 285 million euros.\nRelevent’s role in European soccer\nRelevent, which was co-founded by Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, is both UEFA’s key commercial partner for the Champions League and the promoter of a planned Villarreal vs. Barcelona game in La Liga on Dec. 20.\nThe proposed game was called “regrettable” last week by UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin, but the European soccer body said it will not oppose La Liga’s plan as an exception.\nNetflix’s first major move into soccer broadcast rights was buying U.S. rights from FIFA for the Women’s World Cup in 2027 in Brazil and 2031, which is expected to be in the U.S., likely co-hosting with Mexico.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",
