  "body_text": "Featured Video\nLeBron's Historic Triple-Dub 👑\nReport: Neymar Unlikely to Sign MLS Contract Amid Chicago Fire Rumors\nDespite talks between Neymar and the MLS' Chicago Fire, it remains \"unlikely\" that the Brazilian star will sign a deal with the club, according to Paul Tenorio and Mario Cortegana of The Athletic.\nPer that report, \"Sources cautioned that MLS is not currently a priority for Neymar and his family, despite the exploratory dialogue between his camp and representatives of the Fire.\"\nNeymar, 32, currently plays for Al Hilal in the Saudi Pro League, though injuries have limited him to just seven appearances since transferring from PSG in Aug. 2023. He'll be out of contract over the summer, though leaving for MLS wouldn't secure him anything close to the reported $103 million he's making per year at Al Hilal.\nTenorio and Cortegana noted that previous reporting put Neymar's prospective earnings at Chicago around $20 million, similar to what Inter Miami is paying Messi. Partnerships with Apple, Adidas and Fanatics likely take Messi far about the $20 million figure, however, and his deal with Inter Miami includes the option to purchase an ownership stake in the club upon his retirement.\nWhether Neymar would have been offered such perks is unclear.\nIn his prime, the Brazilian superstar was one of the sport's most exciting players, both for club and country. His playing days included stops at Santos, Barcelona—where he was teammates with Messi and Luis Suárez and won two La Liga titles and won Champions League title—and PSG. He is Brazil's all-time leading goalscorer (79 goals in 128 caps).\nDespite his recent issues with injuries, he would be a huge draw for MLS. While his return may not ultimately come with Chicago, Neymar has expressed an interest in potentially reuniting with Messi and Suárez again.\n\"Obviously, playing again with Messi and Suárez would be incredible,\" he told CNN's Aleks Klosok and Amanda Davies earlier in January. \"They are my friends. We still speak to each other. It would be interesting to revive this trio. I'm happy at Al Hilal, I'm happy in Saudi Arabia, but who knows. Football is full of surprises.\"\nInter Miami does not currently have room to add Neymar as a designated player, however, as Tenorio and Cortegana noted. And if he's not interested in playing MLS soccer in general, it's all a moot point.",
