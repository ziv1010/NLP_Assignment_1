  "body_text": "Exciting changes in coaching line-ups ahead of Interclubs competitions start\nThe 2023-24 TotalEnergies CAF Champions League and TotalEnergies CAF Confederation Cup campaign will commence this Friday and amidst the excitement, several clubs have undergone coaching changes.\nSome of the top clubs have made managerial changes as they seek to build championship-winning squads for Africa's continental club football competitions.\nNotably, Esperance de Tunis has witnessed the departure of coach Nabil Maaloul following their semi-final loss to Al Ahly SC in the previous season.\nIn his stead, the Tunisian powerhouse has reappointed Moin Chabaani, a figure well-versed in Champions League triumphs, having led the team to consecutive victories in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons.\nAnother finalist from the last edition, Wydad AC, embarks on a fresh journey under new leadership.\nAdil Ramzi has taken the reins as head coach, succeeding Belgian trainer Sven Vandenbroeck.\nIn a fascinating managerial shuffle, Vandenbroeck now finds himself at the helm of Algerian champions CR Belouizdad, stepping into the shoes of Nabil Kouki.\nIntriguingly, Moroccan giants Raja Club Athletic welcome Josef Zinnbauer as their new coach, marking a historic occasion as the first-ever German to lead the club.\nMeanwhile, TP Mazembe has welcomed back former coach Lamine N'Diaye for the 2023-24 season.\nN'Diaye's return aims to reignite the team's fortunes after a disappointing campaign last season, during which they exited the TotalEnergies CAF Confederation Cup at the group stage.\nHis previous tenure saw the Senegalese coach guide the Ravens to victory in the 2009-10 competition and secure back-to-back CAF Super Cup titles in the 2009-10 and 2010-11 editions.\nNasreddine Nabi, despite steering Young Africans SC to their first-ever continental final in the previous term, has now taken up the reins of Moroccan champions AS FAR Rabat in the Champions League.\nThis move sets the stage for a captivating journey for both coach and club. Consequently, Young Africans SC has appointed Argentinian tactician Miguel Angel Gamondi to fill the void left by Nabi's departure.\nAs the TotalEnergies CAF Champions League 2023-24 draws near, these coaching changes promise an engaging blend of experience, tactics, and aspirations, setting the stage for a thrilling chapter in African football.\nThe countdown is on as the TotalEnergies CAF Champions League 2023-24 campaign is poised to kick off on Friday with sixteen coveted spots up for grabs for the group stage, African football enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating the tournament's commencement.\nIn a notable departure from previous years, this edition will see a significant alteration in the format.\nFor the first time in recent memory, there will be no playoff round for teams that face elimination in the second preliminary stage.\nThis change adds an intriguing dynamic to the competition, intensifying the race for a place in the prestigious group stage.",
