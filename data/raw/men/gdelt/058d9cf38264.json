This led to his appointment as Real Madrid manager in 1996, where he was tasked with unifying another potentially great team.\nCapello guided Real to the La Liga title in his only season at the helm. He repeated this achievement a decade later during David Beckham's stint at the Santiago Bernabeu before becoming England's manager in 2007. However, according to former player Alvaro Benito, part of the 1996/97 championship-winning squad, the secret to Capello's success in Madrid was his emphasis on the team's body fat percentages, becoming the first Real manager to take note of each player's weight.\nREAD MORE: Swimming record holder, 97, who refuses to quit reveals secrets and routine you can copy\nREAD MORE: 'I don't believe in diets but I lost three and a half stone doing these two simple things'\n\"Perhaps he was a bit ahead of his time in terms of demands,\" Benito told Jordi Wild on The Wild Project. \"He was the first to weigh us and measure our body fat during pre-season. Then, he would call you one by one with the nutritionist and the physical trainer.\n\"He told me, 'you're fat', and I said, 'boss, how is that possible? I'm great. I'm ready to debut'. He said I had to follow a diet, and he was right.\n\"I wasn't fat, but I lost a couple of kilos to reach my ideal weight to compete, and I felt like I was flying. I was a lot faster than before.\"\nCapello's strict fitness regime failed to bring success during his time as England manager. \"We got weighed every day and at the start of the squad, I would say more than three-quarters of the squad would have been told they were overweight,\" recalled goalkeeper Rob Green on BBC Five Live about his experience at the 2010 World Cup.\nDespite England's disappointing performance, only reaching the round of 16 and losing 4-1 to Germany, the approach did yield success at Madrid. Benito, who now serves as an analyst for Spanish broadcaster Movistar, regards his rise under Capello as a career highlight before a knee injury forced him into early retirement at 26 in 2003.\nCompeting against the likes of Davor Suker, Predrag Mijatovic, and Raul, Benito credited Capello's impartiality with helping him move ahead of more established stars in the pecking order.\n\"He was very demanding. He didn't favour anyone, not even the veterans,\" Benito said. \"He was fair. And that is what you want from a coach. I'll tell you an anecdote. In pre-season, Fabio told me he wasn't counting on me.\n\"I started looking for a team; I had already recovered from an injury and was training hard. A few weeks later, he asked where I was going and told me to stay. I wanted to play elsewhere, but he said I had to stay.\n\"After that, I wasn't called up for the first eight matches. But I kept training like an animal. In the ninth match, I played a bit against Racing and did well. In the following match, I was a starter against Real Sociedad and also performed well.\n\"It was very difficult to play in that team. Imagine. Illgner, Panucci, Roberto Carlos, Hierro, Sanchís or Alkorta, Redondo, Seedorf, Raul, Suker, Mijatovic and a spot on the right wing that we all fought over to play. But I started playing there, eight or nine matches as a starter, playing well, playing the best football of my life, until I got injured.\"",
