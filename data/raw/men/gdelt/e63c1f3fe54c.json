  "body_text": "Barcelona striker turned La Liga pundit Gary Lineker reckons that one thing is guaranteed when his former club visit Real Madrid in Sunday’s Clasico at the Bernabeu.\n“My prediction is: goals, as I can’t see Barcelona changing how they play,” Lineker tells The Athletic.\n“Barca play a really high-risk, high-reward game, with their high (defensive) line. They don’t even tend to drop when they don’t have pressure on the ball. They back themselves to score more than the opposition. And Real Madrid have that danger on the counter-attack with the pace of Vinicius (Junior) and (Kylian) Mbappe. So I can’t envisage it being a low-scoring affair.\n“If Lamine Yamal is fit, Barcelona have a real chance. I’ll go: 4-3 to Barca.”\nAdvertisement\nWith Madrid currently two points ahead of second-placed Barcelona in the table after nine games, Sunday’s result could again be crucial in Spain’s title race. Last season, Barca’s two La Liga victories over their arch-rivals proved crucial as Hansi Flick’s side finished four points clear of them in top spot.\n“Winning a Clasico is worth more than three points,” says Lineker, who will be covering the game for The Rest is Football: La Liga podcast, which launched in August. “In England, the classic six-pointer was about teams fighting relegation, but when it’s Barcelona and Real Madrid, the difference between winning and losing is vast. A victory gives you that springboard, the momentum for the rest of the season.”\nSunday’s game could be the first Clasico to feature English players in both teams — with Madrid duo Jude Bellingham and Trent Alexander-Arnold potentially taking on Barcelona’s Marcus Rashford. Lineker said he is not surprised that top English players are attracted to play for Spain’s big two, whose allure continues to outshine even the best-paying Premier League clubs.\n“The really top players, the genuine superstars, go to Real Madrid or Barcelona, over everywhere else, even the Premier League, despite the wealth in England,” Lineker says. “They nurture superstars at Barcelona, with the off-the-charts talents La Masia keeps producing. And Real Madrid are very much about bringing in great players.”\nLineker was one of those superstars when he joined Barcelona from Everton for £2.8million in 1986, the same summer his six goals for England won the Golden Boot at the 1986 World Cup. He hit the ground running in Catalonia, scoring both goals in a 2-0 win against Racing Santander on his La Liga debut, and famously got three more in that January’s home Clasico at the Camp Nou as Barca beat Madrid 3-2.\nAdvertisement\n“Scoring a hat-trick in a Clasico is indescribable really,” Lineker says. “In those days, the Camp Nou held 120,000 fans, and the noise was amazing when I scored two goals in the first five minutes. To complete the hat-trick just after half-time, one-on-one with the ’keeper, was great. Then (Madrid) actually scored twice, and through the last 10 minutes I just remember thinking: ‘Keep them out, don’t ruin this, don’t ruin this’. But it was an incredible feeling, and doing something like that also cements you in the hearts of the Barcelona fans.”\nOn arrival at Barcelona, Lineker made an effort to speak Spanish and learn about the area’s Catalan culture and history. Local fans and media also quickly embraced him as one of their own — especially when he scored all four goals for England against Spain in a 4-2 friendly win in Madrid’s Bernabeu just a couple of weeks after that Clasico hat-trick.\n“Once you join Barcelona, you don’t like Real Madrid, but there’s a lot more to it than just two football clubs,” Lineker explains. “As soon as you arrive there, people explain to you that it goes beyond football, with the politics and the history, going back to (former Spanish dictator Francisco) Franco. The one place they could show their Catalan identity was inside the Camp Nou. When I scored four goals at the Bernabeu for England, the headline in (Barcelona-based newspaper) Sport said: ‘Catalan player scores four against Spain’. That’s one of my favourite ever headlines.”\nPlaying initially in a team managed by fellow Englishman Terry Venables — who led Barca to their first La Liga title in 11 years in his 1984-85 debut season, and was agonisingly denied the club’s first European Cup by a penalty shootout defeat in the final against Steaua Bucharest in the following one — Lineker arrived after that World Cup in Mexico and promptly scored 21 goals in 1986-87.\nVenables was dismissed early in the next campaign following three straight defeats, but Lineker went on to net another 20 times that season, helping win the Copa del Rey under Luis Aragones.\nIn June 1988, Barca playing legend Johan Cruyff was appointed head coach. Lineker was not central to the Dutchman’s plans — he was moved to the wing but still scored 11 times — and while he ended that season by winning the now defunct Cup Winners’ Cup against Sampdoria, he returned to England to join Tottenham Hotspur in 1989.\nAdvertisement\nHis total of 51 goals in 138 games over his three seasons at Camp Nou makes him “very proud”, Lineker says, even if the relationship with Cruyff was not the best.\n“My goal ratio was much better until I was played on the wing in my last year,” he says. “Cruyff clearly wanted his own foreign players, and I would have understood if he had come to me and said that. The disappointing thing is that he messed me about, played me out of position. I knew what was going on, it was frustrating, but I learned so much. Cruyff was an incredibly intelligent coach.”\nLineker’s connection to Catalonia continued after he finished playing and moved into the media in the UK.\nHis work presenting the BBC’s football coverage, including the flagship Match of the Day programme, was recognised when he won the 2021 Manuel Vazquez Montalban International Journalism Award, which is awarded jointly by Barcelona’s charitable foundation and the Association of Catalan Journalists. Lineker left the BBC after 25 years in May.\nHis Goalhanger company produces leading podcasts including The Rest is History, The Rest is Politics and The Rest is Football. Since last August, he has been co-hosting The Rest is Football: La Liga with Alex Aljoe, formerly a presenter for Real Madrid’s in-house TV channel.\nThe Rest is Football is part of a recent trend in football coverage which sees ex-players turned pundits — such as Gary Neville, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards — being very open about their continuing allegiances to former clubs.\n“I still think you can be very objective, but it’s not politics, there’s no reason to try and hide your slight bias towards your own team,” Lineker says. “Actually, as fans, we tend to be more critical of our own team than we are of others. Maybe you get defensive if someone else has a go. But it adds to the package, and Alex has her allegiance to Real Madrid. This will be our first Clasico, and hopefully we won’t fall out too much.”\nAs a Barca fan, Lineker says he has not been surprised by different controversies around current club president Joan Laporta, such as the series of financial manoeuvres dubbed ‘levers’, and continuing delays in renovation work at the Camp Nou.\nAdvertisement\n“Barcelona is a most wonderful club, but it’s also a madhouse,” he says with a smile. “There’s always something going on off the field. But at the same time it has that magic. Hopefully the Camp Nou will be finished in time for the next Clasico (in May). I’ve met Laporta a few times, he’s quite a charismatic guy.”\nUnlike his own travails under Cruyff, Lineker says that Flick’s 4-3-3 shape suits Barca’s current England attacker Rashford, who has five goals and four assists in 12 appearances since joining on a season-long loan from Manchester United.\n“Marcus is a hugely gifted, talented player, and he has made an encouraging start,” Lineker says. “Marcus can play anywhere across the front three, but he is at his best on the left of the attack. It always takes a little bit of time to get to know your team-mates. Given the injuries, he’ll be key for Barcelona in the Clasico.”\nLineker also weighed into the debate over how Bellingham fits into the 4-2-3-1 shape new Madrid coach Xabi Alonso is using.\n“Jude can play any role, really,” he says. “He can play on the left side, or as a 10, as he has mostly so far for Madrid. But I think he is at his best as an eight. The way Xabi Alonso likes to play, he wants legs in midfield, and Jude can provide that. He is equally as good with his defensive duties as he is going forward. There is always a place for him.”\nMadrid’s other Englishman has had a frustrating time since joining from Liverpool in May, but could return from a month out with a hamstring problem in time for Sunday’s game. Lineker believes that — over time — Alexander-Arnold will fit well within what Alonso is trying to do with the team. “Trent has had his injury,” he said. “But Madrid’s football will be made for him.”\nAlexander-Arnold addressing the gathered media in Spanish at his Bernabeu unveiling will have been a “total shock” to most people around Madrid, says Aljoe, who worked for Real Madrid TV between 2012 and 2019. “Nobody expects a British player, especially after Gareth Bale, to stand up and speak in such impressive Spanish,” Aljoe tells The Athletic. “He’s got the right attitude, he doesn’t want people at the club practising their English on him.”\nAdvertisement\nAljoe’s experience at Madrid means she knows just how important winning on Sunday will be to everyone at the club.\n“Working at Real Madrid TV, you really understand the weight of a Clasico, and what it means to everyone at the club, not just the players,” she says. “The nerves are huge. You quickly learn that the only option is to win. The atmosphere after a heavy defeat, you really don’t want that. But the feeling after a Clasico victory is amazing, incredible, and lasts a long time.”",
