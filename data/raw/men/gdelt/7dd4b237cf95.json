Memphis Depay – £21.7m\nYear: 2017\nTo: Lyon\nMan Utd appearances: 53\nMan Utd goals: 7\nHaving played under Louis van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup, Depay completed a £25million move to United a year later and reunited with the manager.\nBut the Netherlands international fell out of favour following the arrival of Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford in the summer of 2016.\nHe made just one start under Mourinho and joined Lyon in January 2017 in a deal worth £16million and another £5.7million in add-ons.\nThe forward registered 76 goals and 55 assists in 178 appearances for the Ligue 1 side before joining Barcelona on a free transfer at the end of the 2020/21 season.\n9. Morgan Schneiderlin – £24m\nYear: 2017\nTo: Everton\nMan Utd appearances: 47\nMan Utd goals: 1\nAlongside Depay, Schneiderlin also endured a disappointing 18-month stint at United after arriving at Old Trafford in the summer of 2015.\nHe moved to Everton in a deal worth up to £24million with add-ons and linked up with Ronald Koeman, whom he played for at Southampton.\nBut the midfielder also failed to find his best form at Goodison Park and was sold to Ligue 1 side Nice for just £2million in 2020.\n8. David Beckham – £24.5m\nYear: 2003\nTo: Real Madrid\nMan Utd appearances: 394\nMan Utd goals: 85\nBeckham left United due to a breakdown in his relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson, who famously kicked a boot at the winger after an FA Cup defeat against Arsenal.\n“The next day the story was in the press,” Ferguson said. “In public, an Alice band highlighted the damage inflicted by the boot. It was in those days that I told the board David had to go.\n“My message would have been familiar to board members who knew me. The minute a Manchester United player thought he was bigger than the manager, he had to go.”\nReal Madrid fought off competition from Barcelona to sign Beckham, paying an initial £17.5million and another £7million in potential add-ons.\nThe former England international registered 20 goals and 51 assists in 159 appearances for Madrid and won a La Liga title in 2006/07.\n7. Scott McTominay – £25.7m\nYear: 2024\nTo: Napoli\nMan Utd appearances: 255\nMan Utd goals: 29\nMcTominay decided to leave United in search of regular first-team football and completed a £25.7million move to Napoli in 2024, ending his 22-year association with the club.\nThe sale of the academy graduate represented ‘pure profit’ in the books, which helped United operate within the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).\nBut the Scotland international won the Serie A title in his debut season and was also voted the league’s most valuable player after contributing 12 goals and six assists.\n“Scotty was a player that you look for in a dressing room to get you where you want to be,” former United coach Benni McCarthy said.\n“To let him go for what was a small transfer fee was a big shame. I think everyone at the club regrets that decision.”\nWHAT A GOAL SCOTT MCTOMINAY 🤩\nIT HAD TO BE HIM 🏴\nCross in the box from Politano, and McTominay’s overhead kick puts Napoli in the driving seat for the Serie A title now 🏆\n📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/UapBowrdnN\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) May 23, 2025\n6. Mason Greenwood – £26.6m\nYear: 2024\nTo: Marseille\nMan Utd appearances: 129\nMan Utd goals: 35\nGreenwood’s United career was brought to a sudden halt when he was arrested in January 2022 and later charged with attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour and assault.\nWhile the charges against him were dropped, United ultimately opted against reintegrating the striker back into the team.\nHe had an impressive loan spell at Getafe in 2023/24 before completing a permanent move to Marseille, who paid United an initial £23.2million and a further £3.4million in potential add-ons.\nThe 23-year-old made an immediate impact and netted 21 goals in his debut season, making him the joint top scorer in Ligue 1 in 2024/25.\n5. Dan James – £30m\nYear: 2021\nTo: Leeds\nMan Utd appearances: 74\nMan Utd goals: 9\nThe first signing of the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer era, James joined United from Swansea City in a £15million deal in 2019 and proved a useful squad player at Old Trafford.\nBut the Wales international was deemed surplus to requirements after United signed Jadon Sancho and Cristiano Ronaldo in the summer of 2021.\nUnited still made a profit by selling him to Leeds in a deal worth an initial £25million and another £5million in potential add-ons.\nThe winger had a difficult debut season at Elland Road and was sent on loan to Fulham but has since turned things around, winning the Leeds Player of the Year award in 2024/25.\n4. Alejandro Garnacho – £40m\nYear: 2025\nTo: Chelsea\nMan Utd appearances: 144\nMan Utd goals: 26\nHaving joined United in 2020 as a 16-year-old, Garnacho worked his way through the academy and established himself as a key player under Erik ten Hag.\nBut the winger fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim and criticised the manager after being named on the bench for the 2024/25 Europa League final defeat against Tottenham.\nHe was told to find a new club a few days later and joined Chelsea in a deal worth £40million after United agreed to lower their £60million asking price.\nThe deal, which also includes a 10 per cent sell-on clause, makes the Argentina international the most expensive academy graduate sale in United’s history.\n3. Angel Di Maria – £44.3m\nYear: 2015\nTo: Paris Saint-Germain\nMan Utd appearances: 32\nMan Utd goals: 4\nUnited agreed to pay a then-British transfer record fee of £59.7million to sign Di Maria from Real Madrid in the summer of 2014.\nThe Argentina international failed to justify that price tag and joined Paris Saint-Germain in a £44.3million deal after just one season at Old Trafford.\nHe got his career back on track and registered 93 goals and 119 assists during a seven-year stint in Paris and also won 19 trophies, including five Ligue 1 titles.\n🔴🔵 Ángel Di María = Paris hero 🔝@PSG_English | #UCL pic.twitter.com/La1ErHuEHe\n— UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) August 18, 2020\n2. Romelu Lukaku – £73.9m\nYear: 2019\nTo: Inter Milan\nMan Utd appearances: 96\nMan Utd goals: 42\nThe most expensive signing in United’s history, Lukaku was bought for £90million in the summer of 2017 and scored 27 goals in his debut season at Old Trafford.\nBut the goals dried up in his second season, and he was sold to Inter Milan in a deal worth £64.7million and a further £9.2million in potential add-ons.\nThe Belgium international rediscovered his goalscoring form at Inter, scoring 64 goals in 95 appearances in all competitions. He also won the Serie A title in the 2020/21 season before returning to England with Chelsea.\n1. Cristiano Ronaldo – £80m\nYear: 2009\nTo: Real Madrid\nMan Utd appearances (first spell): 292\nMan Utd goals (first spell): 118\nAfter joining United from Sporting in 2003, Ronaldo developed into one of the best players in the world and picked up his first Ballon d’Or award.\nBut he expressed his desire to move to Real Madrid, who spent a then world-record £80million fee to prise him away from Old Trafford in the summer of 2009.\n“I respect everyone’s opinion but I don’t agree with these people (who have criticised the fee),” Ronaldo said after joining Madrid.\n“If Real Madrid have paid so much money it is because they wanted me and considered it good value. I am going to do all I can to play well and prove the money they paid for me has been well spent.”\nThe Portugal international didn’t disappoint, scoring 438 goals in 450 appearances for Madrid while winning two La Liga titles, two Copa del Reys and four Champions Leagues.\nREAD MORE: Man Utd wages: Top 10 earners at Old Trafford after Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha sign big contracts",
