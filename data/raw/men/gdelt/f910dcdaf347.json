Thanks for joining us for maybe the most remarkable FA Cup semi-final ever.\nManchester United led 3-0 and looked in total control but Coventry scored thrice in the final 20 minutes to force extra time.\nIn the final minute of extra time they thought they were becoming the first Championship side to reach the FA Cup final since 2008 but had a goal disallowed by the VAR.\nThe Sky Blues led the penalty shootout at one stage but ended up losing it.\nThe football isn't over tonight. El Clasico kicks off at 20:00 BST - follow Real Madrid v Barcelona here.",
