As a 33-year-old in the twilight of a glittering career in Europe, collecting domestic and continental silverware, the former Real Madrid forward’s goal set LAFC on its way to its first MLS Cup title.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s a well-trodden path for an aging player whose star burned brightest in Europe to finish their career in MLS. The league’s early years saw Lothar Matthaus, Roberto Donadoni, Hristo Stoichkov and others join off the back of stellar European careers. Then there was David Beckham, who joined LA Galaxy in 2007 from Real Madrid while in the back end of his prime. Later came Thierry Henry, who, like Beckham, returned to Europe on loan after signing with an MLS club. Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Andrea Pirlo unspectacularly called quits on their footballing careers after uninspiring stints in New York City and Los Angeles, respectively. The most headline-grabbing of the latter group was Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who scored 52 goals in 56 league games across two seasons for the Galaxy before returning to Europe with AC Milan permanently in 2020, earning the club’s first Serie A title in 11 years.\nWhile those stars still exist in MLS, and it’s improbable any team would turn down the chance to welcome the likes of Lionel Messi, the recruiting process is much more comprehensive than when Beckham first arrived.\nIt is no coincidence that nearly all of the players mentioned above played in either New York City or Los Angeles — the two biggest markets in the U.S. that present an opportunity to grow a player’s brand while winding their careers down in a less pressurized environment. While LAFC’s success proves they are not merely a retirement destination for over-the-hill European stars, the prospect of attracting big names using the pull of the city is not lost on the recruitment team.\n“I always like to think when we are in discussions with a player or a staff member that they’re making an informed decision, and I think that really helps ensure that it goes well. I don’t think we want any surprises in how LA fits into that. It’s certainly an advantage in many regards,” said John Thorrington, LAFC general manager and co-president. It’s a global city. People around the world know of it and know what the city has to offer.\nAdvertisement\n“It also has some disadvantages: more expensive, higher taxes, etc. So it’s not all good, but we certainly make sure any incoming player or staff member knows what LAFC and LA, in general, have to offer,” he said.\nBeyond the opportunities offered in those major cities, MLS’ reputation has grown from a retirement league to an attractive prospect for players worldwide to develop, compete for silverware and potentially set themselves up for a transatlantic move to a top-five European league.\n“Before, when you were looking for a player, you would hit your agents, and they would send you a bunch of names of guys who kind of meet the profile that you were looking for. And then you would go to the agent and work with the agents in the club to try to get a player out,” said Greg Vanney, head coach and sporting director of the Galaxy. “The infrastructure has evolved inside our league over the past 10 years. Now it’s even tougher when you go into South America, and you’re battling with more of our clubs from this league who are heavy into those areas. Whereas before, not so much. You didn’t really encounter the other clubs in the league, but now scouts are down there working for different clubs. It’s become much more competitive in that aspect.”\nDue to the geographical proximity, South America has long been a viable market for MLS clubs. Many areas in the U.S. have significant Spanish-speaking populations, making the transition between home and the United States easier. It’s particularly handy for clubs in California, Texas and Florida, among other states, whose demographics are similar to many of the areas that MLS clubs recruit from.\n“A focus for us is we want to go to South America just because of our landscape within our city,” Houston Dynamo general manager Pat Onstad said. “We have over 2 million Spanish-speaking people in our city, so I think for most South Americans coming in, they can feel very comfortable and integrate into the market quite quickly.”\nAdvertisement\n“We’re heavily focused on South America because of the culture of the club, city and state itself,” Orlando City technical director Ricardo Moreira said. “It is easier for South Americans to adapt in Orlando than in different markets. And because of the talent in that region, obviously.”\nBrazil and Argentina have historically received the most attention from MLS and the world as the big names of South American football. The influence of the two nations continues to be significant in the league, with Atlanta United’s Thiago Almada, a 2022 World Cup winner with Argentina, arguably the jewel in the league’s crown. With an excellent season start, Almada is receiving attention around Europe’s biggest clubs, with reports linking him to Serie A champions-elect Napoli. Argentine attacker Sebastian Driussi, an MVP candidate last season, is a star player in the league, while NYCFC’s Talles Magno and Cincinnati’s Brenner (who will make a move to Udinese in the summer) are impressive young Brazilian talents who fit into the salary cap-friendly U-22 initiative and young designated player slots.\nHowever, as the rest of MLS has become wiser to the opportunities in Brazil and Argentina, the price of young talent has increased. Instead of paying the premiums, some clubs are now looking to smaller South and Central American nations to unearth the next Miguel Almirón, a Paraguay international who departed Atlanta United in 2019 for Newcastle United.\n“We have two Peruvian players; one is a cap-friendly movement, and the other, Pedro Gallese, came from a club that was on the verge of bankruptcy in Mexico after playing a good World Cup in 2018,” said Moreira. “We try and look at every market and find opportunities. We have a scout in Colombia covering the north of South America. We like to go to live matches. We like to be onsite to talk to people, be seen, and get people to know you. With that, we get inside information that other clubs don’t have – that way; we can be a step ahead of 29 other teams looking in the same market.\n“We’re growing as a club, and we have to be smart. We want to grow step-by-step. That means bringing in Martin Ojeda from Argentina, but we also want to look at Peñarol (Uruguay) with Facundo Torres and smaller Argentinian clubs like Union Santa Fe with Gaston Gonzales – not in the Boca (Junior)s and the River (Plate)s. We want to be everywhere because everyone knows the hot prospects, and they’re going to be more expensive. If we can’t do that, why not look at step-below talent with room to improve?”\nHouston Dynamo have exemplified this approach of late, adding four players from South America. Defensive midfielder Luis Caicedo was recruited from Cortulua in the Colombian second tier (though he previously played in MLS with the New England Revolution from 2018-2021), while Nelson Quinones, Ivan Franco and Micael were signed from the top divisions in Colombia, Paraguay and Brazil, respectively. Brazilian defender Micael is the only one in the group not to register MLS minutes this campaign, suggesting Houston’s idea to recruit in smaller South American markets is proving fruitful.\n“What is happening now in Argentina is if you want a player that’s going to make a difference, I’m not saying you have to shell out a load of money, but you’ve got to go down and put a fair amount of money down, so it becomes a pretty significant investment for your ownership group,” Onstad said. “And you want to make sure when you’re doing that you’re getting it right. If you’re dabbling in the $1-to-3 million range, you still want to get it right, but there’s a lot of upside there if one or two of them take off.”\nAdvertisement\nThe U.S. Dollar reached a 20-year high from late April to late September last year, according to Forbes, placing the league in a strong position to negotiate with clubs worldwide. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a lasting impact on several leagues in South and Central America, MLS’ financial position has grown owing to recent landmark deals with Apple TV, Fanatics and Adidas, allowing them to make budget-efficient deals while providing an often much-needed monetary injection into faltering clubs in poorer leagues. It is also beneficial for the players, who, given the success of players like Almirón in the Premier League, now see MLS as a legitimate stepping stone to fulfilling their dreams of playing in Europe.\n“We want to develop young players, have them be successful here and then move them on,” said Onstad. “I think when you do that, everybody in the club benefits. Not just ownership or our salary cap but the players training with that player. When I was in Columbus, and Zack Steffen moved on to Manchester City, the guys in that locker room felt honored to play with the guy that went on to play a bit in the Premier League and now the Championship. I think everybody’s desire is to play in a top-five league, so that’s something we’d like to do.”\nA critical development over recent seasons is that MLS has grown into a league that players already playing in top-five European leagues are now joining to elevate their careers. Having received offers from other elite European leagues after being told he could leave Barcelona, Riqui Puig instead joined the Galaxy, where he was immediately elevated to star player status. While he has made no secret about his desire to eventually return to Europe and the Champions League, an MLS club proving they can attract a highly-touted young European by offering him a platform to shine as a leading man is a significant recent development.\nDenis Bouanga, one of the league’s standout players so far this campaign, is another to turn down offers from Europe’s elite leagues to shoulder the responsibility of being a star player in an important franchise. His ability to play across the frontline was an attractive quality for LAFC, which is competing across four fronts this season with CONCACAF Champions League added to MLS, Open Cup and Leagues Cup fixtures. With salary cap constraints, MLS clubs must be conscious about signing players with positional versatility. Players developed in elite European academies where the total football ideology is taught from a young age, like Barcelona’s La Masia, are deemed particularly helpful.\nBut it is not just a league for European players to join as a star, but also to develop into one.\n“Because of the constraints in our league, it forces us to be even more thorough about how we look for opportunities,” said Vanney. “When doing that, you find players like Dejan (Joveljic). He was a player for Frankfurt, but he was having a hard time breaking through because Frankfurt is a highly competitive team inside the Bundesliga, so he was out on loan in the Austrian league, where he scored 20 goals. Frankfurt then buys Rafael Borre to come to be the striker, and now it’s going to be even more difficult for Dejan to get through the pecking order, and he becomes available. We were looking for a young striker to develop an understanding with Chicharito, and the pieces started to fit together. The more broad you are in your scouting and the more relationships you have, the better your network is, the more of those types of things you can pull off.”\nSince joining Galaxy, Joveljic has become more established in the Serbia national team, where he plays and trains alongside Fulham’s Aleksandar Mitrovic, Juventus’ Dusan Vlahovic and Ajax forward Dusan Tadic. His reputation as a reliable goal-getter, particularly from the bench, and experience learning the striker role from former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker Chicharito serves him well to continue developing into a star in MLS or returning to Europe a more well-rounded player.\nFor unearthing these hidden gems, MLS also has the data and analytics boom to thank. There is a conscious effort across the league to move away from the agent-based recruitment style and create a comprehensive department for that purpose, pooling the opinions of scouts, coaches, and technical staff while valuing the contributions of data analysts. It is more complicated than inputting specific attributes into a machine and signing a player based on fit according to the numbers, but the data assists the recruitment process in several ways.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s central,” Thorrington said. “There are cases where the initial entry of a player into our database comes from a scout watching someone, but data serves both as a filter as well as a check on a player. Whether scouts or an agent recommends a player, the data sometimes feeds players into the system or serves as a check, but we always have some form of data to inform every single player in our database.”\nTimothy Tillman, for example, joined LAFC in the primary window from Greuther Furth in Bundesliga 2. With LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo’s experience in Germany, he was aware of the player, having seen him develop in Bayern Munich’s academy and briefly in the Bundesliga with FC Nuernberg and Greuther Furth. With a need to sign a player of Tillman’s qualities, Cherundolo made the recommendation to the recruitment team, where the data analysts then assessed how his play style fit into the team’s requirements through specific metrics that the club looked for depending on the position. In this case, the process was relatively straightforward.\nMLS clubs are forming and building recruitment teams with analytics at the heart of their operations to ensure they are making the most of every opportunity in the transfer market. Houston has recruited the help of SRC FTBL to build an analytics department for the club focusing on player identification. The Houston-based consultancy and data provider’s founders have experience working and building analytics frameworks in MLS with Seattle Sounders and in the Premier League with Arsenal. With their help, Houston signed Ibrahim Aliyu on the primary window deadline day to a U-22 slot after impressing scouts for Croatian first-division side Lokomotiva Zagreb.\nGO DEEPER\nThe good, the bad and the weird from MLS' primary transfer window\nOccasionally, however, a club can love a player statistically and from the scout report, but their attitude turns them off.\n“I like to say, ‘Man first, player second’,” Thorrington added. “If there are any red flags that are present or a reason that we just to believe that that player would not fit within our culture, the process stops. Now sometimes that’s secondary in the process, and we’ve done our filtering and identified a player, but often, at least in the way we work, our scouting and our process is as much about what the data tells you as much as your connectivity within the game to where you can get connected with people and get an understanding as to the player’s character, their personality, their mentality, which is critical for us. There are certain players who, if they don’t necessarily match the physical criteria, can make up for it in other ways. That is one thing that you cannot make up for in my mind. So that is a critical part of the process.”\nThe final step is the same worldwide: getting them to sign on the dotted line. This can be an arduous process, with the prospect of potential deals dragging across several transfer windows. To expedite the procedure, several MLS clubs have signed up to TransferRoom, football’s online marketplace where more than 650 clubs worldwide can buy, sell and advertise players directly and transparently. In recent years, the online and event platform has helped broker deals, including Obinna Nwobodo’s transfer from Goztepe to Cincinnati, Dylan Borrero’s transfer from Atletico Mineiro to New England Revolution and Portland Timbers breaking their transfer record for Evander from Danish side FC Midtjylland.\n“The deal came about as a result of Portland Timbers sharing their exact requirements in an instant with hundreds of clubs on TransferRoom,” said Jonas Ankersen, TransferRoom chief executive. “With access to club requirements in real-time, Midtjylland got an alert that Timbers were looking for a player profile similar to one of their players. This ultimately resulted in a transfer fee of around $10 million, the largest ever outlay for Portland Timbers, one of Midtjylland’s biggest ever sales, and among the top 10 most expensive incoming deals in MLS history.”\nStill, there is plenty of value to unearth closer to home, with trades, transfers and loans within the league remaining a central part of the strategy for most MLS clubs. This offseason, Colorado Rapids traded for Kevin Cabral from the Galaxy for $1 million in allocation money, just two years after he left French club Valenciennes for around $6 million. Galaxy was in pursuit of a deadline day trade for Paul Arriola, but FC Dallas, which acquired Arriola from D.C. United in January 2022 for $2 million of general allocation money (GAM) plus incentives, rejected their offer. In the Eastern Conference, CF Montreal’s five most recent signings have come from fellow MLS clubs, and Philadelphia Union’s most notable offseason acquisitions came via trades.\nAdvertisement\nOne aspect of recruitment that has diminished in recent seasons is MLS clubs’ use of the SuperDraft. While it is not typically seen as a resource to rebuild a franchise, unlike in NBA, NFL, MLB and NHL, it is an opportunity to sign cap-friendly young players with the potential to improve.\n“(The players) won’t have problems adapting to the culture or style of play because the transition from college to MLS is easier to either make an impact immediately or complement the roster,” Moreira said. “The academies are getting better; there is a tendency for players to sign professional contracts before moving to college now. But you’re still going to have the late developers. They’re kids at the end of the day – let’s not make the constant mistake of discarding players at 16,17, or 18. Some talents flourish in their early 20’s. It’s opportunity.”\nLeeds United midfielder Jack Harrison is a notable example, joining NYCFC as the No. 1 pick of the 2016 draft and later transferring across the City Football Group to Manchester City for $6 million. So too, is U.S. men’s national team forward Daryl Dike, whose $8 million transfer to West Bromwich Albion in 2022 represented a landmark deal for Orlando.\n“I remember being in the college cup final. It was maybe 20 degrees — as cold as it could be. Everybody else left the stadium because it was raining, but myself, Oscar (Pareja), and a couple of other scouts and coaches from MLS stayed to watch, and Dike stood out,” said Moreira. “We were following him for a while, but he shone in that game specifically. We were lucky enough to be present and see things in his game that we hadn’t seen before. He was a rough talent, but he fit into what we needed, and we could help him improve.”\nSixteen years after Beckham arrived in MLS, the league has evolved into a respected destination for young players worldwide to develop their skills to secure a move to their dream club or country. It is also a league for players in their prime to take responsibility and help lead a club to success and championships. And some older players come, like Giorgio Chiellini, to use their winning experience to support a team to get over the line. In simpler terms, MLS clubs are constantly looking for various profiles that can benefit the club in different ways.\nThe lack of a uniform youth development landscape does not always assist some clubs in MLS from reaching their potential, nor do the complicated roster rules. Still, there is a conscious effort across the league to develop a recruitment strategy that is the envy of the Americas.\n(Top photos: John Dorton/ISI Photos/Getty Images; Rich Graessle/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images; Matthew Ashton – AMA/Getty Images)",
