See original.\nBy MUHAMMAD IKHSAN MAHAR\n09 Jun 2024 13:58 WIB · English\nOne week after the completion of the 2023-2024 BRI Liga 1 2023-2024 championship series final, dozens of local players took part in the ”This is Indonesian Football?” campaign on social media on June 7-8 2024. They voiced their anger at the rules for increasing the foreign player quota in the 2024-2025 edition of League 1.\nThe campaign is in the form of a photo upload with a black background and a big question mark added with the writing \"IsThisIndonesianFootball?\". In the caption, the players added the writing: \"A question for all of us, is this Indonesian football competition?\"\nA number of players taking part in the campaign include Barito Putera goalkeeper, Muhammad Ridho; Persija Jakarta goalkeeper and captain, Andritany Ardhiyasa; PSIS Semarang defender, Alfeandra Dewangga; as well as a number of main Persib Bandung players, Beckham Putra, Edo Ferbriansah, and Rezaldi Hehanusa.\nThe players are objecting to PT Liga Indonesia Baru's (LIB) new regulations regarding the additional quota of foreign players. Prior to the second final match of BRI Liga 1 on Friday (May 31, 2024) at Gelora Bangkalan Stadium in East Java, PT LIB's CEO, Ferry Paulus, announced an increase in the quota of foreign players.\nAlso read: After winning, Persib Bandung holds Indonesia's dignity in Asian competitions\nAccording to Ferry, in the 2024-2025 Liga 1 season, each of the 18 teams can contract up to eight foreign players. The composition is that six foreign players can come from anywhere, such as Europe, South America, and Africa, while the other two foreign players must come from Asia.\n\"If a club contracts eight foreign players, all of those players can be included in the list of players. However, the main players on the field are limited to a maximum of 5+1, meaning five foreign players and one Asian player,\" said Ferry.\nUnder these conditions, the actual number of foreign players playing on the field is still the same as in the League 1 competition season which has ended, 2023-2024. Five independent foreign players and one Asian representative have dominated the team's performances from the regular series to the championship series.\nThe two teams that reached the top of the match, Persib Bandung and Madura United, have always fielded six foreign players since the start of the four games of the championship series. This shows that the quality of foreign players from both teams is able to lift the team's performance during the 2023-2024 season.\nThis condition has led to some local players expressing their opposition to the campaign \"IniSepakbolaIndonesia?\" (Is this Indonesian football?). This was publicly expressed through their personal social media accounts by Borneo FC defender, Diego Michels, as well as Zulkifli Syukur, former player of Arema and PSM Makassar.\nThe most important thing is to improve early age education. This must be done so that local players do not lose in the competition in Liga 1 teams.\nZulkifli assesses that the addition of foreign players is a challenge for all local players to prove their quality in the best domestic competition. In addition, Zulkifli, who is now the coach of the Central Sulawesi PON team, believes that the quality of the competition will be boosted if clubs can attract high-quality foreign players.\nAlso read: Import Attackers' Unstoppable Domination\n\"A good competition will produce quality players and a strong national team. Don't be afraid to compete, prove your quality (local players), and fight to be able to defend the Garuda emblem on your chest,\" said Zulkifli.\nCoach Indonesian national team Shin Tae-yong said that adding foreign players was a necessity because of the trend in Asian leagues like that. Shin thinks Indonesian teams need to increase the quantity of good foreign players. This is to encourage local players to improve their quality in order to compete for the first team at their respective clubs.\n\"The most important thing is to improve early-age development. That must be done so that local players do not lose out in competing with teams in Liga 1,\" said Shin, who is from South Korea.\nAs a comparison, the Malaysian Super League has implemented a rule that allows each team to register nine foreign players. Even teams competing in inter-club competitions in Asia, such as the Elite Asian Champions League, Asia Champions League 2, and ASEAN Club Championship, can register 10 foreign players.\nThe quota of nine foreign players consists of seven free players, one Asian player, and one ASEAN player. An additional foreign player for the Malaysian ambassador team in Asia can come from outside of Asia. This has been done by Johor Darul Ta'zim, which has registered 10 foreign players consisting of eight free foreign players, one from Asia, and Jordi Amat who fills the ASEAN player quota.\nAlso read: Indonesian League: Star Action, Foreign Players and Player Regulations\nThe issue of air pollution is not a new phenomenon. The community has long been affected by the threat of air pollution, and there is ample research evidence indicating the impact of air pollution. However, despite this, significant efforts to control air pollution have not been realized. As a result, residents continue to suffer in the midst of air pollution. The Thailand league has also set a quota of nine foreign players, consisting of five free agents, one Asian player, and three ASEAN players. Completing the quota of foreign players in the 2023-2024 Thailand League is BG Pathum United. The three ASEAN players will be contracted from Singapore, namely Ikhsan Fandi, Irfan Fandi, and Ryhan Stewart.\nIn the Asian club competition, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) doesn't limit the number of foreign players that can be registered from the 35-player quota for each club. However, clubs are only allowed to include six foreign players - five free foreign players and one from Asia - in each match.\nSo, what are the positive impacts of increasing the foreign player quota in League 1 2024-2025?\nFrom the positive side there are at least two things. Foreign players have the opportunity to improve the quality of competition and help spread exposure of Indonesian League 1 internationally.\nThe presence of more players from countries with a better football history can certainly help improve a team's game. Players from Europe, South America, and East Asia, for example, have grown up in a climate of better football development and facilities compared to Indonesia.\nThey are able to be the difference-makers in the club they defend. Even more so, they become a key factor in the achievement of their team's championship title. This was done by Paulo Sergio (Portugal) and Wiljan Pluim (Netherlands) who helped Bhayangkara FC and PSM Makassar respectively to achieve their championship titles. Both of them completed the club's trophy with the title of Best Player.\nSince the League 1 era in 2017, foreign players from Europe and South America have dominated the list of top scorers. Sylvano Comvalius, Aleksandar Rakic, Marko Simic, and naturalized Indonesian striker born in Montenegro, Ilija Spasojevic, are goal hunters from Europe. Then, the Brazilian attacking duo, Matheus Pato and David da Silva, won the golden boot in the last two seasons.\nApart from increasing competition for teams and individuals in Liga 1, these foreign players are also expected to boost the performance of Indonesian teams in international tournaments.\nApart from that, the presence of foreign players can also increase international knowledge of League 1. Persib's achievement of the title this season, for example, made the Italian and Dutch media report on the final of the League 1 championship series. The Italian media reported The story of Stefano Beltrame, who comes from Italy, then Nick Kuipers invited the Dutch media to report on Kuipers' journey in Indonesia until he became a champion.\nMeanwhile, the negative impact of the increasing presence of foreign players is the decreasing opportunity for local players to participate and the potential financial issues faced by clubs.\nEvery club competing in the season can register 30 players. This number does not yet include young players from the Elite Pro Academy team who can be included in the main team once the season is underway.\nOut of the 30 players, only 21 players can be listed for each match. With the rule of eight foreign players, it means only 13 local players can be included in the match list. Out of that number, only five local players can be fielded if each team maximizes their quota of six foreign players per match.\nIt's no wonder that many local players are speaking up due to the diminishing opportunities they have to play in their own domestic league. Moreover, the majority of teams have also been employing foreign coaches. This makes trust in foreign players higher than trust in local players.\nOut of the 18 participants in the 2024-2025 Liga 1, only three clubs have confirmed that they will entrust the helm of their team to a local head coach. They are Barito Putera with Rahmad Darmawan, Malut United still with Imran Nahumarury, and Semen Padang retaining Hendri Susilo.\nFinally, the team's ambition to hunt for quality foreign players will have a negative impact on the club's finances. Of course, the higher the ability of foreign players, the higher their price will soar, even though the salary of foreign players is still lower than that of local players with the label of the Indonesian national team.\nTherefore, in order to prevent more Liga 1 clubs from receiving transfer embargoes from FIFA due to their failure to fulfill their obligations to players, especially foreign players, PT LIB also needs to impose strict financial regulations on clubs. This has been attempted by tightening the rules for clubs that must pass the club licensing test in Liga 1 2024-2025, which includes requirements related to financial conditions.\nHowever, as the competition operator, PT LIB also needs to conduct stricter monthly monitoring of clubs to evaluate their licenses, including ensuring that there are no salary arrears for players and coaches. Point reduction penalties can be imposed to serve as a deterrent to clubs that neglect the rights of players.\nApart from the organizer's side, clubs also need to be aware of themselves when pursuing foreign players. They must be able to plan their financial condition well for the next season so that there are no problems that follow along with big ambitions at the beginning of the season.\nThe addition of foreign player quotas should not only make clubs think about short-term programs to excel at the senior level. Liga 1 clubs also need to maximize foreign players to help with youth development programs that must be carried out by clubs to improve the quality of local players in the future.\nWriter:\nMUHAMMAD IKHSAN MAHAR |\nEditor:\nPRASETYO EKO PRIHANANTO",
