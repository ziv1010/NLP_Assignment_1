  "body_text": "Mikel Arteta has spoken to the media for his post-PSV Eindhoven press conference.\nThe boss was asked about the game, how we've performed in the competition, Declan Rice's role at centre-back and more.\nHere is what he had to say on the following subjects…\non his thoughts on the game:\nYeah top match, we made eight changes. There were good moments, there were moments we lacked that cohesion and timings especially in the way we pressed against a really good side, when you don’t get the timings right you have to defend awkward spaces and we had to do that a few times tonight which could have cost us the game. But the reality is we had some very good moments as well, I’m really happy with the attitude and behaviour of every single player, how they tried and in the end we could’ve won it with the chance of Leo and the goal that was disallowed.\non why the younger players didn’t feature:\nI don’t think it was the right context, making eight changes already to throw them in there against a team that hasn’t lost here almost in two years, I didn’t think it was the right moment and I went on to wait to see how the game developed, but it was too much for them and as well we have three little issues, we had to make the subs and then we had no room because we really wanted to play a game as well.\non how PSV developed since our previous game against them:\nWell very good because they win every single game so I only have thoughts of pride for the way they play, the coach and let’s see what they can keep on doing. On Monday we have the draw. We finished first and they finished second and let’s move on.\non Declan coming on at centre-back:\nWe are very short at the back, I really wanted to try when something happens, how we are going to resolve that situation and I think it was really good.\non how our return to the Champions League has felt:\nHow long do we have? I think overall very, very positives, after six or seven years without being in the competition with a team that doesn’t have a lot of experience there I think we have competed very very well, I really like the approach of the team in every single game, the way we try to play and dominated the opponents, we have some big results and big experiences as well. Like what we had in Seville, or in Lens and even today, when we make that many changes as well, how the team can act, or how fair it is for certain players to give that exposure, overall finishing first with a game to play we have to be really happy, close that chapter, leave it until February and make sure in February when that chapter opens up against we are in the best possible place to compete against another top side.\non what made it difficult for us in the first half:\nFirst of all credit to them, the way they play. The creation and timing when the ball was really far from our goal, we weren’t very clear and what we wanted at sometimes. We mis-kicked the ball twice which is pretty unusual for us to do and we have to adapt and we have to put our head backwards and run backwards and we did that and it could’ve been a different result.\non Jesus and Smith Rowe coming on late on and if there was a temptation to bring on the younger players:\nEmile we wanted to play him a little bit earlier. We were waiting because we had two players with niggles. I was asking them can they continue? I was hesitant to make the change too early and than have six or seven minutes with ten men.\non the experience for the younger players to be around the team:\nGreat. They’ve been around at the game and they are very used to it now.\non there being two extra games in the group stages next year and how that will impact player welfare:\nWe’ll see. We will have bigger squads, I don’t know because we will have even more competitive matches. I don’t know it’s something new. We have to experience it, we want to be in the competition and have the right to be in the competition again so that’s a long way away.\non if he has seen enough for us to dream to win the competition:\nWhat I’ve seen is that we can compete at this level and we came top of the group which is very important. Especially the way we did it with a game in hand. We have to win game by game and we arrive again in February.\non if Mo was a hamstring injury:\nYeah we don’t know the extent of it but he’s done something.\non what Declan brings at centre-back:\nWell he’s played there before and we have to try in case of an emergency. I will have to make sure that we can fill the gap in the right way.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
