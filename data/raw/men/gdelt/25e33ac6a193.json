INEOS billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe has arrived at the club – and now, Telegraaf writer Valentijn Driessen says that the signs are clear that Ten Hag is approaching the end.\n“I think he is in his last months: if you really wanted to continue with this coach, because the organisation is now pretty much [run by] new co-owner Jim Ratcliffe, then you would also have given Ten Hag reinforcements to continue building a team that should be there next year and finish in the top four,” Driessen told the Kick-Off podcast, via Football 365.\n“I assume that [reinvestment is] destined for the new coach, and not for Ten Hag. And that they will leave it now and only start investing and selling it in the summer.”\nDespite Driessen's assertions, he admitted that Financial Fair Play could be a factor, though he claimed United could fetch “quite a bit” through selling. Ratcliffe's investment is yet to be ratified, however, hampered financially when it came to making incomings last month – meaning that the new ownership's lack of intent when it comes to improving the squad would likely be similar regardless of the manager.\nIt may also have made sense not to invest in the squad just yet, given that this is a transitional season with youth coming to the fore, and the key directors behind the scenes in charge of recruitment have yet to be integrated.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nWith United struggling this season and plenty of Ten Hag's signings failing to have made an impact, there may be some truth in Driessen's beliefs that Ratcliffe does not have faith in his manager. Another factor in the club's decision to continue with the Dutchman could be the lack of stability in sacking a manager midseason, with a bigger payoff involved and fewer quality options available to replace him.\nWith 57 wins in 90 fixtures as boss at Old Trafford, Ten Hag has a win ratio of 60 per cent.\nMore Manchester United stories\nStuart Pearce reveals how Sir Alex Ferguson helped him cheat at Fantasy Football\nManchester United icon snubbed move back to Premier League: report\nMartin Edwards on Sir Alex Ferguson’s move to Manchester United: “Terry Venables was mentioned, but I made up my mind quickly that he was the one”\nMark White is the Digital Content Editor at FourFourTwo.
