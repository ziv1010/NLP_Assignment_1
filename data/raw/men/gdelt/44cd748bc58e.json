Łukasz Fabiański, Vladimir Coufal and Danny Ings also left the Hammers.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nKevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)\nA mainstay for Manchester City over the past decade, Kevin De Bruyne was instrumental in central midfield in a hugely successful era for the Sky Blues.\nOut of contract at the end of the season and not offered a new deal, De Bruyne left with 422 appearances, 108 goals and 19 trophies. He was described by chairman Khaldoon Al-Mubarak as the \"greatest player\" to play for the club. Hard to argue with that.\nÓscar de Marcos (Athletic Club)\nAfter coming through the youth ranks at Deportivo Alavés and playing a season in Spain's second tier, Óscar de Marcos joined Athletic Club in 2009.\nThe versatile full-back, who can also play in midfield, racked up 573 appearances for Athletic over 16 years, more than any other player in the club's history. De Marcos is retired this summer at the age of 36 and played his final match for Athletic in the last round of La Liga, against Barcelona at San Mames in late May.\nÁngel Di María (Benfica)\nÁngel Di María's European career began at Benfica in 2007, with the Argentine winger sold to Real Madrid in 2010 after three successful seasons with the Lisbon club.\nFollowing a season at Juventus in 2022/23, Di María made an emotional return to Benfica and departed in the summer after two more years with the Portuguese giants as he returned to the club where he started his career in Argentina, Rosario Central.\nJaume Domènech (Valencia)\nValencia captain Jaume Domènech left the club this summer after spending the last 12 seasons at Mestalla.\nOften a back-up, the goalkeeper has made over 100 appearances with the first team after spending two seasons with the youth side, having joined from local club Huracán. He was in goal as Valencia beat Barcelona to win the Copa del Rey in May 2019.\nAbdoulaye Doucouré (Everton)\nAbdoulaye Doucouré's time at Everton came to an end in the summer and the Malian international waved goodbye after five seasons at Goodison Park.\nThe midfielder made 166 appearances for Everton and scored 21 goals, including a crucial winner against Bournemouth at Goodison in May 2023 which preserved the Toffees' top-flight status.\nChristian Eriksen (Manchester United)\nOne of the finest midfielders to grace English football in recent years, Christian Eriksen said goodbye to Manchester United after three seasons at Old Trafford.\nThe Dane, who spent six-and-a-half years at Tottenham and also had a spell at Brentford after suffering a cardiac arrest at Euro 2020, made over 100 appearances for United and helped the Red Devils to League Cup and FA Cup wins under Erik ten Hag.\nJonny Evans (Manchester United)\nJonny Evans started his career at Manchester United and the Belfast-born defender made close to 200 appearances for the Red Devils before a move to West Brom in 2015.\nAfter three years at West Brom and five at Leicester City, the Northern Irishman returned to United in the summer of 2023 and has hung up his boots after two seasons back at Old Trafford. Evans won 12 trophies as a Manchester United player, with all but one of those coming in his first spell at the club.\nAlexandre Lacazette (Lyon)\nAlexandre Lacazette is out of contract this summer at Lyon and it has been confirmed that the club captain will be leaving the cash-strapped Ligue 1 side.\nThe former France forward came through the youth ranks at Lyon and made 391 appearances for the club across two spells, either side of a five-year stay at Arsenal, scoring 201 goals. Two of those came in his final match as he hit both in a 2-0 win over Angers.\nLuka Modrić (Real Madrid)\nLuka Modrić joined Real Madrid from Tottenham in the summer of 2012 and the Croatian midfielder has won it all in 12 seasons at the Santiago Bernabéu.\nThe 39-year-old had wanted to stay another year, but left Madrid after the Club World Cup and will go down as one of the greatest players in Real's history. Instrumental in six Champions League triumphs, Modrić has won 28 trophies in total during his time with Los Blancos.\nThomas Müller (Bayern Munich)\nThomas Müller left Bayern Munich after the Club World Cup, bringing to an end his 25-year association with the Bavarian giants.\nMüller has played 751 times for Bayern in a career spent entirely with the Munich club and scored 248 goals, winning over 30 trophies in that time.\nJonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen)\nJonathan Tah left Bayer Leverkusen to join Bayern Munich after 10 years with the Black and Reds.\nThe Hamburg-born German international defender joined Leverkusen from his hometown club in 2015 and went on to make over 400 appearances. A key player as Leverkusen won a Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double in 2023/24, the 29-year-old joined Bayern on a free transfer.\nJamie Vardy (Leicester City)\nJamie Vardy joined Leicester City, a Championship side at the time, from non-league Fleetwood Town in 2012 for a reported fee of £1 million and leaves the Foxes 13 years later as the club's greatest-ever player.\nInstrumental in Premier League and FA Cup wins for Leicester, Vardy scored on his final appearance against Ipswich Town to make it 200 goals in 500 games for the Foxes and was given a guard of honour as he left the pitch for the last time at the King Power Stadium.\nLucas Vázquez (Real Madrid)\nLucas Vázquez is another player leaving Real Madrid, with the winger out of contract and departing after this summer's Club World Cup.\nNot always the most popular player with fans, the former academy player has been a reliable performer for Madrid for an entire decade and has had to operate at right-back in the absence of the injured Dani Carvajal. A five-time Champions League winner with Madrid, the 33-year-old has contributed to 20 trophies in total.\nJoel Ward (Crystal Palace)\nJoel Ward joined Crystal Palace from Portsmouth in 2012 and the defender has racked up over 350 appearances for the south London club in the past 13 years.\nThe last remaining member of the 2013 Championship play-off winning squad, Ward was an unused substitute as Palace won the FA Cup in May and lifted the club's first-ever trophy along with Marc Guéhi at Wembley. The 35-year-old, who retired from football, started in a 4-2 win over Wolves three days later and went off to a standing ovation at Selhurst Park.\nBen Hayward is a European football writer and Tottenham Hotspur fan with over 15 years’ experience, he has covered games all over the world - including three World Cups, several Champions League finals, Euros, Copa America - and has spent much of that time in Spain. Ben speaks English and Spanish, currently dividing his time between Barcelona and London, covering all the big talking points of the weekend on FFT: he’s also written several list features and interviewed Guglielmo Vicario for the magazine.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.",
