Which you can be absolutely sure UEFA will try to expand in very near future. Having gone from the previous 32 teams in the Champions League group stage to now 36 (why???), UEFA will no doubt say, “hasn’t this been a brilliant success, why not go up again to 40…”\nJust to remind you, in the ‘old’ school last 32 of the Champions League, you had 32 teams that played in total 48 group games, in order to then provide the last 16. This new ‘exciting’ Swiss League’ (European Super League) has replaced that with 160 matches to get from 36 down to 16, with 144 Swiss League matches and 16 play-off games (what is the justification for the top 16 in the Swiss League not going automatically through??? Oh, that’s right, to make sure none of the ‘wrong’ clubs are eliminated after 144 league matches!\nAfter 144 group games, just look at all the big clubs that have been knocked out…not!!\nLook at recent seasons under that old boring Champions League format, after 48 matches the following all eliminated these three previous seasons:\nEliminated in the group stage 2021/22: AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona, Atalanta, Sevilla\nEliminated in the group stage 2022/23: Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen, Juventus, Sevilla\nEliminated in the group stage 2023/24: Man U, Sevilla, AC Milan (and Newcastle United!)\nThis is all just a cynical ploy from UEFA, backed by the usual suspects (the ‘big’ clubs) to protect them as much as possible, ensure they get through to the later stages. Ensure loads more moneyspinning (mostly pointless) matches, to enrich UEFA and especially certain clubs.\nCan you fool all of the people all of the time?\nWell, UEFA are giving it their very best shot.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
