Being physically well, with nutrition a big part of it, is something the 25-year-old has paid particular attention to since his loan to AC Milan in the 2020-21 season.\nAdvertisement\nWhile living in Italy, amid the Covid-19 restrictions in place at that time, he would talk to legendary former Milan and Italy full-back Paolo Maldini, then the club’s technical director, about football — and insisted on being addressed in Italian as he learned the language.\nHe began paying more attention to how he ate, slept and kept fit. Maldini’s advice included being more patient on and off the pitch, and more vocal during matches. Milan were impressed by the young defender they had borrowed from Old Trafford and gave him regular minutes, as he played in 21 of the 38 Serie A games. They even enquired about signing him back for this season, as did Borussia Dortmund, who have ended up in the Champions League final this weekend. The year before, Juventus and Atletico Madrid did the same.\nCristiano Ronaldo has been an important figure too, with Dalot considering the former United star the most influential person in his career. Ronaldo was his idol for years, and since being Portugal team-mates at the previous Euros in 2021 he has considered him a friend — something Dalot finds surreal. The full-back thinks every conversation with the man he considers Portugal’s greatest-ever ambassador is an education, a chance to draw on his knowledge, talent and wisdom.\nAnother important influence was their countryman Jose Mourinho, who first brought a teenage Dalot to United from Porto in summer 2018 with the view that he’d be the next Gary Neville and make the right-back position his own for a decade. Mourinho, Dalot reckons, can make you feel like the best or worst player in the world if he wants.\nAnd it’s all paid off.\nDalot is The Athletic’s Manchester United player of the season for 2023-24, having continued to improve despite being in a side that fell well short of expectations.\nAdvertisement\nNo outfield player at the club saw more action than Dalot, who clocked up 4,364 minutes in 50 appearances across four competitions. The only one of United’s nine senior defenders not to lose a considerable part of the season to injury, he was absent for only two games.\nOne of those was the wretched 2-0 defeat at West Ham in December, due to a suspension after getting sent off the previous weekend against Liverpool at Anfield. The other was the season’s opener against Wolves, his place on the bench indicating he wasn’t in manager Erik ten Hag’s best XI then, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka preferred at right-back.\nDalot didn’t start against Tottenham the following week either — hence the transfer interest mentioned above as the summer window was still open — but once he replaced Wan-Bissaka after 66 minutes that day he kept his place, playing 90 minutes of every Premier League game the rest of the way, bar that West Ham trip.\nTen Hag has been happy to use him since August, whether at right-back or left-back, which is where he played for six of the final seven games of the season, including the FA Cup final win against league champions and neighbours City.\nSwitching positions doesn’t come naturally. Dalot says his perception changes with spaces and body shape. “When I go from the right to the left, having played 10 games in a row on the right, I must prepare in training before,” he explains. “You approach players in a different way on the left, the way your feet are for example.”\nUnited’s previous permanent manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer feels Dalot has improved since he was fired in November 2021, and become a better defender. Anyone who watched him getting skinned by Villarreal’s Arnaut Danjuma that season would concur — though he was one of United’s best players in that dramatic Champions League last-16 away win against Paris Saint-Germain in March 2019.\nAdvertisement\nIn a dressing room where the mood has been on the floor at times this season, Dalot is the DJ — sociable and connecting with everyone in the squad. His excellent English means he gets on with the Brits, but he is also integral for both the Portuguese and Spanish speakers. His best friends in the group are Casemiro, Antony, Lisandro Martinez and Bruno Fernandes, with whom he argues about the Sporting Lisbon-Porto rivalry back home.\n“He’s a very mature player for his age. It’s easy to forget how relatively young he still is,” one United source, speaking anonymously to protect relationships, told The Athletic. “He’s very professional and very switched-on tactically. He’s played inside as the extra midfielder well at times this year. His crossing is mixed, but as you saw against Aston Villa in February, you can see how good it can be.\n“And you can see how good some of his defending can be. He’s been inconsistent with certain things: some of his defending at the back post, some of his positioning, but there’s a feeling that it’s all slowly improving and getting better.\n“He’s had a good run of games this season and he has to be in the conversation for the player of the year, given his number of appearances and level of performance.”\nGO DEEPER\nHow 'grafter' Dalot is starting to deliver as Manchester United's top right-back\nOthers at Carrington have noted how his speed, strength and endurance have improved, that he’s developed into a multi-faceted asset.\nFormer United full-back Patrice Evra says: “For me, Diogo Dalot is a consistent player, with great regular performances. What I like most when I watch him play is the energy he puts on the field, he always wants to get up the pitch and never gives up, and that’s why, in my opinion, he has been United’s most consistent player this season.”\nEncouraged to attack more by Ten Hag, Dalot scored one of United’s goals of the season — a screamer at Sheffield United in October. That was among his three goals and five assists for a low-scoring side.\nHe also became a father for the first time, to Clara. “She was born in Manchester and is a proper Mancunian,” he says of a place where he has finally begun to feel at home after a difficult first couple of years. A shop in the city centre selling Portuguese foods is handy for when he decides to really push his strict dietary boundaries and have a ‘pastel de nata’ — a custard tart.\nAdvertisement\nDalot grew up in the northern city of Porto and was indoctrinated into supporting the local team of the same name, especially by his father, who went to every home game. When he wasn’t playing football, or the piano, Dalot junior would be a ball boy at Porto matches, where he’d jump into the crowd and celebrate big goals with his fellow fans, before rising through the ranks to make their first team, making his league debut at age 18.\nHe has talked to people from United’s new co-owner INEOS, as the other players in the squad did, and Dalot is optimistic about the club’s future. He uses as motivation his belief that most people in England want to see United fail rather than return to greatness. The opposite, he thinks, was true during his season in Italy, where most people in that country wanted to see seven-times European champions Milan strong again.\nDalot recently passed the milestone of 150 United appearances, but his focus for summer is now on playing for Portugal at the European Championship, kicking off next month. He feels the mood in the camp is better than he’s ever known, and he’s been surprised by Roberto Martinez as their new coach since the 2022 World Cup, admiring his personality, his rules, discipline and tactics.\nBut it’s at United where Dalot’s stock has risen most, his absolute focus paying off on the pitch and recognised off it with individual awards after his best United season — his team-mates voted him players’ player of the year.\nHe is hugely proud to have won the FA Cup, their second trophy in 15 months, hardly a bad return for a stuttering team.\nGO DEEPER\nDiogo Dalot on becoming vital for Man Utd: 'Erik showed me that I could do it'\n(Top photo: Glyn Kirk/AFP via Getty Images)",
