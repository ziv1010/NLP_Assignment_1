  "body_text": "There was an era at Nottingham Forest when it felt normal to see the likes of Stuart Pearce, Des Walker, Nigel Clough, Neil Webb, Steve Hodge and others depart for England duty.\nHaving a half-empty dressing room during international breaks was as familiar as the club’s regular visits to Wembley to play in cup finals. It was nothing out of the ordinary. It was just what happened at Forest.\nOver the past three decades or so, that has changed.\nAdvertisement\nDean Henderson and Jesse Lingard, who have their own history with England, were in the Forest squad that edged to survival in that first season back in the Premier League under Steve Cooper in 2022-23, even if they did not add to their cap collections while at the club.\nBefore that, in the Championship, Michael Dawson returned to Forest for a second spell after winning four England caps during his time at Tottenham Hotspur, and they signed midfielder Jack Colback, who had received an England call-up while a Newcastle United player, only to have to withdraw from that squad through injury. Going even further back, England forwards Andy Cole and Ian Wright both had short, unmemorable spells with Forest, deep into the autumn of their careers.\nForest have had their fair share of international players since returning to the Premier League, ranging from Argentina to New Zealand, so there has often been a fairly empty dressing room during international breaks, but it has been a long time since one of their squad has been able to voice serious ambitions about regularly representing England.\nWhen Morgan Gibbs-White came on in the 76th minute of September’s 2-0 win against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin, he became the first Forest player to appear for the senior England side since Pearce in 1997. It was a landmark moment. He will hope to be fit enough to earn a recall next week for the November matches against Greece and the Irish again, as he works to recover from an ankle injury.\nBut there may also be more like him on the horizon.\nWe are not realistically yet at the stage where a clutch of Forest players are likely to be called up for England duty at the same time, but there are four or five Englishmen in Nuno Espirito Santo’s squad who do at least hold realistic ambitions of representing their country at first-team level in the future.\nAnd that alone is a sign of the evolution and progress within the ranks at the City Ground.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Forest made their Premier League return, away against Newcastle United on the opening weekend of the 2022-23 season, their bench included Cafu (not that one), Alex Mighten, Loic Mbe Soh, 19-year-old academy kid Oli Hammond and veteran forward Lyle Taylor.\nWith complete respect to those players, the dynamic has changed dramatically in the two years since, with the squad this season including Ryan Yates, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Elliot Anderson, James Ward-Prowse and Gibbs-White, all of whom will be hoping to attract the attention of both interim England head coach Lee Carsley and Thomas Tuchel, who will take on the role permanently in January.\n“We have always had a lot of players involved during the international break. We normally have around 12 players involved with different teams, which shows the quality of the squad,” said head coach Nuno in his press conference ahead of the visit of West Ham United on Saturday. “But these English players… it is natural that they have this ambition now because it is a new cycle that is starting for England (under Tuchel, on the road to the 2026 World Cup) and they are good players.\n“It is great to have players who want to play for their national team because it makes them push harder; it makes them have a desire to get better. Because only the best will go to their national team. If you are involved, if you have that idea around you, it makes you believe more; it makes you work harder. We are delighted to have a young group of English players who have that ambition to play for England.”\nAfter representing Scotland in several age groups from under-16 to under-21 level, English-born then Newcastle midfielder Anderson (top left) was called up to their senior squad in August last year. He pulled out through injury. This August, shortly after his move to Forest, he accepted his selection for the England Under-21 squad — and has subsequently made four appearances at that level, scoring his first England goal in a 7-0 win against Azerbaijan Under-21s last month.\nAdvertisement\nThere is a feeling at Forest that it will not be long before he receives his first senior England call-up, even if he is not in the squad for those games against Greece in Athens on November 14 and Ireland at Wembley three days later.\nAnderson’s performances this season have already persuaded Forest they landed a bargain, with the 21-year-old having effectively cost them £15million ($19.3m at the current exchange rate). He has filled the void created by Gibbs-White’s absence, producing outstanding performances in that No 10 role during wins over Crystal Palace and Leicester City. The latter came despite playing through the pain of a foot injury last Friday — one that does make him a slight doubt for this weekend.\nThe £25million — rising to a possible £42m — Forest invested to sign Gibbs-White from Wolverhampton Wanderers in summer 2022 is also looking great value, with the attacking midfielder having rapidly evolved into one of the most influential players in the team.\nHis relationship with Carsley — who he played under as England won the Under-21 European Championship last year — might have been a factor in Gibbs-White’s senior call-up, but if he can retain his influence at Forest, there is no reason why he should not get another England opportunity.\nHudson-Odoi — who already has three senior England caps won in 2019 during his Chelsea days — might similarly benefit from his past relationship with Tuchel, who he played for during the German’s time as head coach of the west London club in 2021 and 2022.\nTuchel often used Hudson-Odoi as a wing-back, as well as a winger, and trusted him enough to include the now 23-year-old in the matchday squad when Chelsea beat Manchester City 1-0 in the 2020-21 Champions League final.\nCarsley was at the City Ground to watch Forest beat Palace 1-0 on October 21. He will have witnessed former Forest goalkeeper Henderson make a bad mistake for the visitors but will also have seen impressive performances from Anderson, Yates and Hudson-Odoi. He should have headed home with plenty of food for thought.\nAdvertisement\nWard-Prowse already has 11 England caps, although his first challenge in terms of making it 12 will be to win back his place in the Forest side. The on-loan midfielder is not permitted to face his parent club this weekend and was an unused substitute at Leicester, after serving a one-match ban for his red card against Chelsea. But Nuno has liked what he has seen from the set-piece expert (who turns 30 today) in his four Premier League starts, saying: “He immediately had a huge impact on the team. He settled down and we are very happy.”\nHad anyone suggested Yates would be pushing for England recognition a few years ago, few would have believed them. But the 26-year-old midfielder’s continued progress and determination to improve has seen him prove his doubters wrong — and hold onto his Forest place, even amid increased competition.\nIncluding time out on loan as a youngster, Forest academy graduate Yates (top right) has played in the top five divisions of English football, so there would be a certain symmetry to it all were he to follow that up by playing for England’s senior side.\n“It is every young boy’s dream to play for their country. I feel as though I am playing well, but I feel as though I can give even more,” said Yates in a roundtable interview with journalists on Tuesday. “I have more to come. I want to keep improving.\n“But I never say never with anything. I look back on the loan spells I had with Barrow, Scunthorpe and Shrewsbury (there was also one at Notts County)… to be playing my third season in the Premier League with Forest now, it makes you believe that anything is possible.\n“If the club bring in players with more Premier League experience than me, I just ask myself, ‘Why do they have more experience?’, ‘Why have they played at this level for so long?’, ‘What can I take from them, to improve myself?’. There are still things for me to improve all the time. I have always been on that path. I feel as though I always tell you the same things but, in truth, nothing really changes. Each season that passes, I have become a better player and I do not want to put a ceiling on where I can get to.”\nWithin their academy setup, Forest already use Yates as the poster boy, the example of what the club’s young players can achieve with the right attitude. Were he to add an England cap to his Wikipedia page, it would only enhance that status. And there is, in theory, room for a combative, destructive midfielder of his kind within the current England squad.\nAdvertisement\nBut, for Nuno, the important thing is that the circle is maintained. If his players play well, they will continue to be talked about and be on the international stage — and Forest should flourish as a result.\n“It is a reality. National team coaches travel to see the games and, when a team is doing well, it is normally only because the players are doing well,” said Nuno, who played in goal for Portugal in various age groups, at B-team level and in the 1996 Olympics and made their Euro 2008 squad but never won a senior cap.\n“If the players are doing well, the team is better, the club grows. I know how much these players want this (England opportunity) and I am delighted for that.”\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
