Enjoy.\nZinedine Zidane's potential transfer destinations - ranked:\n5. Manchester United\nIs the Manchester United job attractive for any manager at the minute? Absolutely not, but Zidane has been linked with a move to Old Trafford if they are to let go of Erik ten Hag this summer.\nIt's clear that United are working hard behind the scenes to redevelop the coaching and recruitment areas of their business, with INEOS keen to restructure operations.\nBut a job like this for Zidane would be beyond a baptism of fire to Premier League life. Serious development is needed at United if they are to return to the glorious club they once were, and it's hard to imagine that the former Madrid boss would be keen on this project.\nFit? 2/10\n4. Liverpool\nLiverpool will be keen to bring in a successful manager to fill the boots left by legendary Reds boss Jurgen Klopp. Anyone that comes in will need to boast experience and be able to conduct entertaining football.\nIn terms of a box-ticker, Zidane doesn't look like a bad option at all. But for the manager himself, the Premier League as a whole is not a sound choice, even ruling out his own chances of such a move due to a lack of fluency in English.\nFit? 3/10\n3. Real Madrid\nZidane is one of Real Madrid's most successful managers ever, and it's possible that the club would be keen to bring him back again.\nThe team are doing well without him, sitting comfortably atop the La Liga table and battling through the Champions League. But even when Zidane returned for his second stint at Madrid, he was able to lead them to a league victory.\nIt's unknown whether a return to Los Blancos would be of interest to the 51-year-old, but his knowledge of the club at an elite level would be beneficiary.\nFit? 6/10\n2. Bayern Munich\nThere is soon to be a vacant spot at Bayern Munich, with Thomas Tuchel on his way out of the club at the end of the season.\nA move for Zidane would be welcome news for Bayern and Harry Kane in particular, who is desperate to achieve silverware. Zidane could be the answer to all of Kane's woes, and the Bundesliga side have already identified him as a target post-Tuchel.\nA club playing Champions League football will also appeal to Zidane, offering the opportunity to build on his success in the tournament.\nFit? 7/10\n1. Juventus\nA role at another one of his former clubs may be what it takes to bring Zidane back to management.\nSuch a move, however, would depend on Massimiliano Allegri, who is contracted to Juventus until 2025. Allegri is looking more likely to depart though and has been linked with Napoli, which may open the door for Zidane.\nIt's clear that Zidane will wait for the right job and the best vacancy. Juventus would certainly be of interest to him, and he has previously opened up about his desire to work in Italy.\nHe has fond memories of Juve, especially of his former manager Marcello Lippi, who he says was the first coach to really believe in him.\nZidane may be keen to replicate this sentiment with the current squad, leading Juve back to success in Italy.\nFit? 8/10",
