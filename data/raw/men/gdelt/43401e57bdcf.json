Both managers would likely accept a draw if it were offered ahead of kickoff, and we are struggling to separate them in this contest, believing that it will ultimately end in a low-scoring stalemate.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nChelsea welcome Championship-bound Southampton\nTwo struggling sides on downward spirals seek to restore some Premier League parity on Tuesday evening, when Chelsea welcome Championship-bound Southampton to Stamford Bridge.\nEnzo Maresca‘s men are reeling from a third straight loss in all competitions – going down 2-1 to Aston Villa – while their visitors put up little resistance in a 4-0 drubbing at the hands of Brighton & Hove Albion.\nAs we speak, the Chelsea transfer gurus ought to be busy compiling a list of goalkeeping targets for the summer window; after the error-strewn Robert Sanchez was dropped in favour of Filip Jorgensen, it was the Scandinavian’s turn to make a fatal mistake at Villa Park.\nFor all of Chelsea’s recent turmoil, the Blues faithful should not expect a shred of sympathy from Southampton supporters, whose side could still set a new lowest-ever Premier League points total before their seemingly inevitable drop down to the second tier.\nEven with a fully-fit defence, Southampton are carved open with ease more often than not, and the Saints’ depleted backline only spells even more danger for the basement boys.\nChelsea might have persistent problems on the road, but the Blues are good value for a few goals at home and should defy their attacking absences to storm to a routine win over Juric’s men.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nBrighton welcome Bournemouth to the Amex Stadium\nAs the race for European football in the Premier League intensifies, Brighton & Hove Albion are set to host Bournemouth at the Amex Stadium on Tuesday night.\nThe Seagulls trounced Southampton 4-0 on Saturday and are in ninth place with 40 points, three points behind sixth-placed Bournemouth, who were beaten 1-0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers on February 22.\nBrighton were outstanding against Southampton, with the victors creating nearly four xG, producing 10 big chances and attempting 15 shots from inside the box.\nBoss Fabian Hurzeler will be pleased by his side’s response to their 7-0 thrashing at the hands of Nottingham Forest on February 1 given his team have only conceded once in their three games since while scoring nine times.\nBrighton have won six of their last eight matches – losing two – while keeping four clean sheets, and their tally of 12 points in their past six league games is only bettered by Liverpool, Arsenal and Everton.\nBournemouth’s defence will undoubtedly be tested given Zabarnyi’s dismissal last time out, and the hosts could create several opportunities in front of goal.\nHowever, the Cherries’ form on the road is outstanding, and they will feel they can regularly threaten Brighton during counter-attacks.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nCrystal Palace and Aston Villalock horns at Selhurst Park\nBoth Crystal Palace and Aston Villa will be aiming to make it successive wins in the Premier League when they lock horns at Selhurst Park on Tuesday night.\nPalace, who occupy 13th spot in the Premier League table, will enter the contest off the back of a 2-0 victory over Fulham on Saturday, while eight-placed Villa were 2-1 winners over Chelsea on the same afternoon.\nPalace have a record of eight wins, nine draws and nine defeats from their 26 league matches this season, with a total of 33 points leaving them in 13th spot in the table, 16 points clear of the relegation zone and 10 points off sixth-placed Bournemouth.\nThe Eagles are six points behind 10th-placed Fulham, and they were 10th last term; a lack of goals this season has thus far cost them a spot higher up the table, but there is plenty of time for that to change.\nVilla have only won four of their 12 away Premier League matches this season, but Palace have struggled at home, posting just two wins; the Eagles have shared the points on five occasions in front of their own fans, though, and we can see an entertaining contest finishing all square on Tuesday night.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nSpanish Copa Del Rey\nSemi-finals\nBarcelona 20:30 Atlético Madrid",
