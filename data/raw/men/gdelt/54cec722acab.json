Not if you listened to the on-record press conferences, the politeness and slightly barbed niceties exchanged from United manager Marc Skinner and Martin Ho — Spurs head coach and Skinner’s former assistant — across the Zoom airwaves on Friday morning.\nAdvertisement\nBut the warring emotions on the Leigh Sport Village touchline seem to tell a different story: the surge of pure red blood cells at each of the six goals scored; the seething, silent resentment at conceding them; how both sets of coaching staff and players experienced this gloriously unhinged draw in varying states of emotion. There were jeers, boos, bone-crunching tackles, defensive bodies hurled on the line inside 50 minutes, a fourth official caught on either side by teeth gnashing over alleged officiating injustices.\nROLFÖ VOLLEYS IT FROM CLOSE RANGE 🔥#BarclaysWSL @ManUtdWomen pic.twitter.com/Gxdti98zsz\n— Barclays Women’s Super League (@BarclaysWSL) December 14, 2025\nIf anything, this is rivalry at its best: full-throated, inebriating, believing, with all your heart, you are simply better than your opponent.\nIt has been nearly six years since Spurs and United arrived in the WSL in the same season, Spurs runners-up to the Championship title winners United in 2019. Their respective journeys to reach that space were different — the north London side working their way through the leagues from the bottom up, United finding a team and earning entry straight into the Championship (now WSL2) in 2018. The six years on the other side have been similarly different. Spurs’ highest finish in the WSL is fifth (2021-22), while United have only finished outside the top four once (2023-24). Where Spurs reached a maiden FA Cup final in 2023-24, the occasion marked United’s second time on the stage and the experience told as they claimed a 4-0 win.\nBut there is more here than just the mere coincidence of timing. There is also some slowly cooking beef: United used Spurs as an education port for midfielder Grace Clinton in the 2023-24 season, ultimately transforming the England midfielder into a sensation but not able to keep a hold of her after her loan; United then pried Norway winger Celin Bizet away the following summer. Martha Thomas, who thundered home Spurs’ third goal on Sunday, wore the United shirt for two seasons between 2021 and 2023 but was unable to break into Skinner’s plans, ultimately finding a home at Spurs.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, it was former United head coach Casey Stoney who put in the formal call to Tottenham’s managing director of women’s football, Andy Rogers, this summer to endorse Ho, then at SK Brann, as Spurs’ No 1 managerial candidate. Ho then convinced Spurs to poach United’s highly rated analyst Lawrence Shamieh to his backroom staff.\n“He’s probably one of the most knowledgeable people I’ve worked with and one of the most dedicated and hard-working people,” Ho said in his pre-match press conference. “United definitely know that will probably be a loss for them in terms of what he gave to them and what he would do. I was just delighted that Lawrence decided to join us — he’s leaving a team that’s competing for the title and in the latter stages of the Champions League. He’s decided to come to Tottenham, where he sees a real ambitious project, somewhere where he can grow and develop around good people, good players.”\nBACK ⏩ FRONT\nA brilliantly worked team goal from @SpursWomen that Martha Thomas fires home! 🔥#BarclaysWSL pic.twitter.com/2K8vKnIruD\n— Barclays Women’s Super League (@BarclaysWSL) December 14, 2025\nWhich is the real point of tension in this gurgling rivalry: not anger or resentment so much as both sides believing they are within a certain touching distance of each other.\nHow great is the gap, if there is one? United might argue it’s a long stretch, given the raw numbers from Sunday night’s match: United’s xG of 4.59, their 47 touches in the opposition box, their 34 shots at goal, 11 on target, four off the woodwork and another four cleared off the line.\nSpurs, by comparison, boasted an xG of 0.78, five shots with four on target, desperately defending as early as the 20th minute.\nYet, until the 75th minute, it was Spurs who were 3-0 up, giving United a mini clinic in ruthlessness and once again proving to be a far greater sum of their parts under Ho’s tinkering.\nAdvertisement\nIn their 13 previous WSL meetings with United, Spurs lost 11, failing to score in their last three, a run which started with that FA Cup final defeat. Yet, On Sunday, for 75 minutes, such meek submission was absent. Rather, it was United desperate to reassert the power balance.\n“Nine point nine times out of 10, we win that game,” assessed Skinner post-match. “Obviously, Tottenham are investing. I have a lot of respect for Martin as a coach, and basically, there’s a lot of our DNA in what they do. It’s probably clever to do as you’re growing and trying to grow a club.\n“But what I’d say is the quality… that we show shows that we’re ahead, and we need to make sure that we stay in those spaces. Tottenham will take a little bit of time and investment to get there, but we need to stay ahead when we can.”\nTHAT TOONE TECHNIQUE 🌟#BarclaysWSL @ManUtdWomen pic.twitter.com/ceDF1rBvXT\n— Barclays Women’s Super League (@BarclaysWSL) December 14, 2025\nThere is a degree of truth there. United, so often the subject of a limited squad this season, could boast some superiority, able to call on summer signing Rolfo from the bench to score United’s second and third goals after capitalising on Spurs’ decision to move to a back five.\nSpurs, meanwhile, had just one attacking player on the bench in 20-year-old England youth international Lenna Gunning-Williams, with Charlotte Grant, Olga Ahtinen and Cathinka Tandberg all sidelined until the new year after the most recent international break, while winger Jessica Naz suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury last weekend in the 3-2 win over Aston Villa.\nThe absences are a severe blow to a squad that has surpassed all expectations this season, sitting fifth in the table with a team almost identical to the one that trundled to 11th last campaign, barely registering on their opponent’s competitive radar. The same cannot be said now. Spurs are occupying league table space as much as psychological head space.\nUnited rotated heavily for their mid-week Champions League group-stage match with Lyon, opting to rest key players Jess Park, Ella Toone, Dominique Janssen, Hinata Miyazawa and Julia Zigiotti Olme in anticipation for Sunday. They lost 3-0.\nAdvertisement\nIn the days following, there was even talk of getting a member of United’s coaching staff to impersonate the loud Scouse twang of Ho on the touchline in pre-match training sessions, an idea quickly abandoned.\nCould it have made a difference? Both sides are desperate for an edge with just a point separating them in the league table and a League Cup quarter-final this weekend, an opportunity to discover just whether, 9.9 times out of 10, United come out on top.\nThe true distance between these two clubs might be better gauged after the January transfer window. Spurs are set to invest heavily, with the signing of Norway forward Signe Gaupset already secured with more on the way. United, too, are looking to add.\nFor now, Ho is mostly pleased.\n“I feel a lot of pride and a lot of joy for the players because they give me everything,” he said. “With the result, obviously we’re disappointed. But in terms of the long term, if you’d have looked six or seven months ago, people wouldn’t expect us to be where we are.”",
