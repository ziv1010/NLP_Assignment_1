  "body_text": "Fulham 1 - 3 Everton\nAfter a really poor first half where a strange Everton line-up had allowed Marco Silva's Fulham to take the lead, a much more competitive second half saw Everton take all the points at Craven Cottage in the glorious spring sunshine.\nNo Jake O'Brien today, as he has apparently sustained an injury! But Alcaraz starts... along with Harrison and Doucure. Hard to understand why McNeil, Ndiaye and Calvert-Lewin are benched if they are fit, while David Moyes appears to prefer a very strange-looking side that features the error-prone Micheal Keane at the heart of the defence.\nFulham are without Antonee Robinson today. The left-back, a product of Everton Academy, is having his minutes managed due to a knee issue.\nGlorious spring sunshine on the banks of the River Thames for this one, as the Premier League approaches its conclusion for this season, ahead of next week's final game at Goodison Park.\nGarner with the kick-off, back to Pickford for the punt upfield. The first few minutes were pretty scrappy from both sides. Alcaraz seemed to have a brielf chance to run in but he lost the ball. Garner with a long throw that Branthwaite could not dig out.\nDoucoure was a bit too strong and Fulham made pretty good use of the free-kick, Wilson shooting straight at Pickford. Harrison got forward and swung the first of his ineffectual crosses beyond the far post. But Everton were unable to keep the ball, losinng it repeady until Iwobi fired in a low one that Pickford held.\nAll the play was coming from the home side, who seemed to have a greater desire for the ball and to drive forward at Everton, benefitting from some incmpetent passing by the players in Blue. Everton finally played some passing football, Harrison heading a great cross back that didn't quite reach Beto in front of goal.\nBeto and Gueye then had to defend, albeit unconventionally, the Senegalese falling on the ball rather than tackling his man in the Everton area. Fulham continued to zip the ball around, and a nice cross to Raul Jiminez was too good to resist as he powered his way through two Everton defenders, flooring both Branthwaite and Mykolenko, and giving Pickford little chance to stop it going over the line after just 17 minutes.\nA really poor start by the Blues, who just don't seem to be at the races today. After a brief foray upfield for Everton, it was Wilson who fired in a dangerous shot that just curled away at the last secoind. Finally, Alcaraz got some room to play in Harrison, who could do no better than shoot straight at Leno.\nWith Fulham content to be in the lead, Everton had more possession but were unable to do a great deal with it until Mykolenko forced the first corner. Young took it short from the left, then hoofed the return well beyond the far post.\nIn the next Everton attack, Mykolenko's cross was headed clear by the first defender. Gueye found Harrison wide right with a deep crossfield ball but Harrison could not retain it. Pereira tried a long-range shot, well over.\nA sloppy giveaway by Mykolenko on half-way allowed Jimenez to gallop forward into space before finding Iwobi, who curled his shot over the ball. Branthwaite was having trouble after Jiminez had jumped into him earlier in the half.\nEverton got forward but were quickly closed down. However, another turnover went their way, and Garner had another chance for a long throw that won another Everton corner but it didn't cause Fulham any trouble. Pereira was too clever for Alcaraz and Wilson wanted another go, his deflected shot plamed just outsiide the post by a brilliant Pickford save.\nFulham had a couple of goes at the cormer as 3 minutes were added to the first half. Alcaraz stole a clearence but he could only shoot straight at Leno. Another long throw came in and was cleared as far as Docucoure who played it back for Mykolenko, his low shot taking a wicked deflection off Andreas Pereira to put the Blues right back in this one just before the break.\nThe game restarted and it was end to end but with no real cjhances until a loose ball fell nicely into the path of Alcaraz but he could only smack it lamely at a blocking defender. Garner got another of his now trademark long throws into the 6-yard box but it ewas headed clear.\nEverton pushed forward . A quick corner was then delivered in well by Young, forcing another one from the other side. This one was right to the nearpost and behnd off Leno's arm but no third corner give, only a goal kick, incorrectly.\nFulham went straight up the other end and Iwobi set up Sessegnon for a shot that go down Pickford did very well to see and parry. The corner saw Alcaraz. Everton went forward again but the ball was turned over and an audacious attemot at a lobb by Wilson was palmed out brilliantly by Pickford who had leapt wildly like a cat but fallen back down like an elephant. He was okay after teatment and Virginia was not required.\nThe Fulham corner was good but cleared. Berge felt he had to foul Beto for a yellow card. The free-kick was curled in by Young and Beto somehow avoided converting it, only playing it back to Gana and the chance was gone. At the other end, Wilson had another shot, high and wide.\nAlcaraz looked to be struggling with the physicality of the game, getting close attention when he got the ball at his feet. Beto got forward and a chnce to play in Docucoure buthis low cross was too close to Leno. At the other end, yet another attempt from Wilson before David Moyes made his first changes on the hour mark.\nYoung took out Smith-Rowe, who was then subbed. Jimenez was called for a foul as the free-kick came over, Everton attacked again, Beto again the one to cross rather than be recieveing the ball up high. But most of the play was being driven by Fulham who were keen to restablish their lead. Some clever work by Iwobi almost forced a breakthrough before the Everton defenders cleared.\nIt was far from dull with both sides now heavily committed and the intensity of the game seeeing good attacking moves at both ends, Alcaraz somewhow winning a corner for Everton. McNeil sent it over superbly to the far post where that enigma, Michael Keane sent a bullet header that almost burst the Fulham net. Brilliant stuff.\nBut VAR decided there was either a foul or an offside… just completely ridiculous. Finally, they backed down and Everton's excellent go-ahead goal was confirmed.\nThen, from a turnover on the half-way line, Alcaraz burst forward and fed Beto. Now his shot was not great, but Leno allowed it to somehow squirm under his hands and into the back of the net! Excellent work by the Blues.\nFulham were stunned but knew they had to do something, a good cross was headed inches wide by Jiminez as the happy singing of the Blue Army came across loud and clear. Some great chasing by Alcaraz forced a high turnover, but no long throw this time.\nAt the other end, Fulham kept firing in crosses, Keane struggling a little as more changes were made by each side with less than 10 minutes left. A Fulham free-kick and another ball curled in and headed clear, Alcaraz then taking the applause of the Everotn fans as he was replaced after a pretty good game from him.\nAs the time ticked away, the fight seemd to finally ebb away from the Fulham players as they realized the magnitude of their task was surely impossible. But the balls kept coming into the Everton area and each one needed defending by hook or by crook. Godo got forward and produced a great cutback but Iroegbunam saw the danger and made a brilliant interception.\nMore changes by Moyes broke up the play as 7 minutes of added time were shown, with Calvert-Lewin and Coleman joining in the fun. More danger from Godo, somehow stopped again by Iroegbunam.\nMcNeil had a chance to relieve the pressure but he played an awful pass between Calvert-Lewin and Ndiaye. Another chance for the Blues to run forward saw Calvert-Lewin chase the ball but he couldn't strike it far enough away from Leno, who was out quickly.\nVAR wanted to look at a Mykolenko handball, with 8 minutes of added time already played. Another ridiculous and completely unnecessary involvement, forcing Darren England to look at it on the monitor... but — respect — the ref was having none of it.\nAnd thus ended a fantastic away win for Everton who had completely turned around an awful first half display.\nFulham: Leno, Tete, Andersen, Bassey, Sessegno\nn (83' Godo), Andreas Pereira (75' Cairney), Berge [Y:56'], Wilson (75' Willian), Smith-Rowe (63' Traore), Iwobi, Jimenez.\nSubs not Used: Diop, King, Cuenca, Vinicius, Benda.\nEverton: Pickford, Young, Keane, Branthwaite, Mykolenko, Gueye (90+1' Coleman), Garner, Harrison (61' McNeil), Doucoure (61' Ndiaye), Alcaraz (84' Iroegbunam), Beto (90+1' Calvert-Lewin).\nSubs not Used: Broja, Chermiti, Patterson, Virginia.\nReader Comments (304)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

I mean why do we have Doucoure and Harrison starting this game?\n14 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:06:49\n15 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:07:44\n16 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:08:09\n17 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:09:53\nDont think for a minute this will be the ending line up.\nI am sure many of those you thought would start will be on the pitch on 90.\n18 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:10:18\nScratches head...\n19 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:10:23\n20 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:11:18\n21 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:12:16\n22 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:14:30\n23 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:18:59\n24 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:20:41\nHoward (19) I think that the one win in the last ten games might have something to do with anti Moyes negativity\n25 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:20:45\n26 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:20:57\n27 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:22:57\nWe know Keane is a bust, Young is 39 etc.?Why not give Chermiti a run out, even a couple of the fringe players from the U21’s?\nIsn’t this a perfect time to look at what we have in the U21’s, rather than give the old, well past it brigade?\nA better line up than last week!!!? You have got to be joking. But hey, let’s just forget the fact we only have one win in the last 10 eh?\nMoyes will never change, it isn’t in his dna.\n28 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:23:43\n29 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:26:50\nBut it does feel like he wants a good look at the players that are leaving to see is there anything worth keeping.\n30 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:28:07\n31 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:30:48\nIf O Brien is not available who do they suggest play in defence.\n32 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:30:57\n33 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:33:17\nCOYB\n34 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:34:16\nThats the starting line up, it leaves him plenty options to change the team when needed.\n35 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:34:48\n36 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:36:08\n37 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:37:43\nAlthough not sure who could have played CB?

Can you share\n40 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:40:51\n41 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:42:16\nI think Moyes has set himself up\nMcNeil and Nd started last week now on the bench\nDCL came on last week should give him minutes and Beto comes on later\nKeane, well maybe no option\nYoung already on holiday looking for another Club\nIf this team pulls something off then he’s the Moyesiah\nIf it doesn’t then his words about ending the season gung ho on a high will haunt him when he’s behind the couch\n42 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:45:37\n43 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:47:53\nHe shouldn't be here next year and as such is a waste of a starting place. We should use it on players that are staying.\nIt's worrying he's a shoe in as soon as he's available like they are going to offer him a new contract.\nIf he scores the winner it still won't change my opinion, even if it makes me look stupid\n44 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:48:49\n45 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:49:50\nCan they please let me eat my words as the Europa league finalists could go above us this weekend otherwise.\n46 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:50:08\nKeane to score the winner\n47 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:50:46\n48 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:50:51\nChanges yes, but the old familiar failures. Why no new, younger faces if the result doesn't matter ?\nSeems like Moyes doesn't really want this job ?\nBring on next season !!!!\n49 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:51:10\n50 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:52:49\n51 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:53:07\nI don't know if he has but I'm sure it has been said that Mykolenko had played centrally before joining us.\nI suppose that Moyes feels he needs to know something more on Keane, Young, Doucoure and Harrison although he's probably seen more of them than McNeil, Patterson, Chermiti, Iroegbunam and Calvert-Lewin. Still, he's got another game or two yet.\n52 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:55:31\n53 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:56:17\nA hope for the future dashed by instance on fielding the past\n54 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:57:50\n55 Posted 10/05/2025 at 14:58:18\n56 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:00:09\n57 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:03:45\n58 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:09:54\n59 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:11:06\nYoung over Patterson. Wouldn't have been my call, but I can see it.\nI thought Garner and Gana had a tough time with Doucoure helping them through the work last week.\nNot the team I would have predicted. But he doesn't have that many ways to go. Let's see how they play.\n60 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:11:55\nThe move is said to be just a “matter of time” with negotiations already underway between representatives of both clubs for a concrete agreement.\n61 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:17:41\n62 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:18:55\n63 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:20:32\n64 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:20:46\n65 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:21:16\n66 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:21:36\n67 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:26:02\n68 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:26:27\n69 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:26:36\n70 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:27:34\n71 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:28:49\nAre you honestly saying that it wouldn’t have been better to give some U21’s a run out, rather than bring the donkey Keane back in?\nIf we are going to lose, at least lose by checking out the young players. It wouldn’t surprise me if Moyes gave the likes of Keane an extension. He does c love his defenders.\nGoing well so far though isn’t it?\n72 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:30:12\n73 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:30:19\n74 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:33:23\n75 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:33:50\n76 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:35:36\n77 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:36:45\n78 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:37:44\n79 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:40:16\n80 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:40:25\n81 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:44:36\nWe were never getting relegated.\nWe did not have to pay him off.\nWould not have hired Moyes.\nNew (proper) manager would not entertain keeping Keane, Doucoure, Beto, DCL, Harrison, Young, Mykolenko and Patterson.\nMoyes would keep them all!\n82 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:45:15\n83 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:48:49\n84 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:48:53\n85 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:49:03\n86 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:52:02\nI guess we could have played Reece Welch instead of Michael Keane today. He is the most likely of the U21 CBs.\nThat said, he hasn't made the grade this season in the Belgian 2nd division - being returned mid-season after managing just 2 matches.\nSo it would be a bit weird to pick him for the first team.\n87 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:53:08\n89 Posted 10/05/2025 at 15:58:33\n90 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:01:32\nI take them back. He's awful.\n91 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:02:17\nIt's a workmanlike side aimed at a point, snatching a win. Truth is, however, it's bereft of any quality. Most are slow ponderous uncomfortable with a football.\nThere are not many here to be retained, I include Alcaraz sadly, we need new fullbacks. Branthwaite, Pickford, Gana you can do something with; the rest… no thanks. Big reset in Summer. Get some young hungry players with a point to prove…\n92 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:04:07\nThen another soft goal with both Young and Keane in a sort of no man's land marking nothing and not even getting in the way of anything. Indeed, Fulham seem to be making more of a target of Young's side and he's been found wanting.\nDoucoure has been his usual rubbish self so maybe he'll turn up in exactly the wrong place to score and while Harrison hasn't done badly without doing anything exceptional, when he does get in a position to cross there's, at best, only Beto somewhere in the penalty box.\nWe got a fortunate equalizer but if we want to win this we have to get more men forward, I was going to say in support but we need to start working the ball more rather than just hoping to thread one through for Beto to run onto. Moyes needs to make changes and for me Gana and Garner are the men he needs to look at.\n93 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:07:41\n94 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:12:22\n95 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:28:59\nHe's praised for his save from Wilson but it was his positioning that put him in trouble!\n96 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:29:53\n97 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:29:55\n98 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:30:29\n99 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:30:30\n100 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:30:51\n101 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:31:10\n102 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:31:35\n103 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:31:58\n104 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:32:28\n105 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:32:44\n106 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:33:04\n107 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:33:28\n108 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:33:49\n109 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:33:58\n110 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:34:36\n111 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:34:41\n112 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:35:04\n113 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:37:00\n114 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:37:02\nWhy didn't they start with this line-up?\n115 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:37:31\nMoyes hater's must be gutted he's proved them wrong again! 😁\n116 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:39:08\nA pair of useless pricks!\n117 Posted 10/05/2025 at 16:39:43\nI posted earlier but lost it cause I was underground but I did reply to you cheekily that we were not doing too bad at half time and would love a win and maybe Keane would score.\nNow that I'm above ground, can't believe my eyes.

I was wrong to doubt you!\n134 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:04:08\n135 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:04:34\n136 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:06:58\nUp till then, we were piss poor.\n137 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:09:06\nMoyes, Keane, Mykolenko and Beto all shite, apparently.\nWhat stood out for me is what a different team we look when McNeil is playing.\n138 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:10:05\nAs such, that plan worked to perfection today.\n139 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:10:13\nTo be fair, you were right, we didn't win with the starting line up...\n140 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:10:30\nDelighted with the win, still feel there's lots and lots of squad improvement to be had.\n141 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:12:14\nWe won but this team needs a massive dose of ability. UTFT!!\n142 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:15:02\nA deflection for the first goal, an elementary keeper's error for the third, and a hand ball decision flagged away that could easily have been given.\n143 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:15:12\n144 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:16:43\n145 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:17:21\nHe's doing a good job. Forget the past.\n146 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:18:02\nShite that Moyes, eh, Michael?! 😜\n147 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:18:27\n148 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:19:39\n149 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:20:56\nI was disappointed with Alcaraz being subbed as he was our best player carrying the ball forward but will look forward to Moyes's press conference and next week's team selection.\n150 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:21:26\nKeane was excellent as was Harrison. McNeil also excellent, but he wasn't fully fit to start, we know that from last week.\nMoyes certainly deserves credit for the team selection. Patterson and Ndiaye both deserved dropping after last week and McNeil isn't 100% fit yet. Moyes got it spot on.\n151 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:24:42\nKeane might be a useful backup. Young can still play, but he's too old to be given another year.\nDom and Seamus are also saying their final ta-ras.\nAlcaraz is worth buying.\nGood day for the boss, there.\n152 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:24:43\nAndy Walker, Harrison was great? He looks like he's playing piggy in the middle ffs.\n153 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:25:43\nWell done, lads, and the away support was terrific.\n154 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:26:07\nMcNeil made a hell of a difference. When we go on the front foot, we're a well better team.\nBrilliant refereeing as well. Is just me or does McNeil look like he's gained a yard of pace?\n155 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:26:18\nBut, all that aside, it was a horrible starting line-up, and most honest fans said so. They were no match for Fulham who steamrollered them to the fist goal., then eased off the intensity that had gotten them the lead.\nAfter that, some massive, massive luck: The Mykolenko deflection. That's usually a block and not a goal.\nThen the corner. Brilliantly taken and exquisite far post pile driver by Keane... but was it that corner which didn't even touch a Fulham player and should have been a goal-kick? (I know we had one earlier go their way...)\nAnd the third goal... well, Leno apparently saves those for breakfast, lunch and dinner. But not today.\nAnd the penalty VAR non-call? Remarkable considering what they normally do to us.\nBut hey, that's football. If you think it's down to Moyes's brilliance, have at it. A great win in the end but he and we were very lucky.\n156 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:29:48\n157 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:32:32\n\"It didn't look [like it would go] that way after the first 20, 25 minutes. I thought we were terrible on the ball but we stuck at it.\nWe are a resilient crew and the players did a good job in the end.\n\"Michael Keane was terrific today, he was a proper centre-half. Keano scored a really good header, it was a really good goal.\"\nOn Beto's development: \"He's done great, he's improving. If he was a 19-year-old striker you'd say he's got a bit to go; he's not but he's certainly improving. Let's hope he can get goals in the remaining games.\n\"I have been pleased [with performances away from home]. It was a worry for me how this game would go [missing key players] but great credit to the players, we hung in a little bit but certainly improved in the second half.\"\nOn referee Darren England standing by his decision not to award Fulham a penalty after being sent to the pitchside monitor: \"I clapped him. I would have had a Mexican wave. I saw it on the iPad and I saw the boy was running so I don't know where you'd expect his hands to be. Isn't it great we have someone who is willing to go to the screen and stick with his decision? We want referees to go by their own decision, and from what I've seen, the correct decision.\"\nOn next week's final game at Goodison Park: \"I have just said to the players we have the biggest game of the season next week, and we are all ready for it.\"\n158 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:34:38\nBecause Ndiaye and McNeil from recent observation did not have 90 minutes in them, then Harrison and Doucoure were the obvious starters to protect a very vulnerable backline. We did not want to lose and hopefully could snatch a win.\nThe anti-Keane and anti-Moyes hysteria was comical to observe, especially when both Keane and Beto scored.\nWell done to all today and I'm going to enjoy that winning feeling this weekend.\n159 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:35:57\nGiven what was available through injuries and, after last week when Ndiaye and McNeil both looked knackered well before the end, it was a starting lineup and bench to do a job away from home, which it did.\nOh and we weren't lucky either, outfought Fulham all second half and thoroughly deserved the win.\n160 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:38:39\nMcNeil was excellent and Charly Alcaraz much improved once he went central. He's wasted playing out wide.\nGood second half and we'll deserved win.\nIf we'd won all our drawn games, we'd be on 72 points now.\n161 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:39:16\nLet's just enjoy it.\n162 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:40:24\nThose who feed it won't acknowledge it though.\n163 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:42:19\nPrior to the game, I was on the fence about the team. Thought Moyes had set himself up,\nHowever, after a dismal first half, and bringing on two players I thought he should have started, off we went!!!!\nGreat result, regardless of performance.\nPity the other 3-1 result at Celtic Park didn't go the way I wanted.\nStill midweek!!!!!\n164 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:42:56\nhttps://youtu.be/Bo7zkd0kRS4?si=QCuHrdQ8nYjkK_GP\n165 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:43:59\nWe were terrible in the first 25 minutes due to the team selection and the lack of intensity from the players.\nSecond half was much better when Ndiaye and McNeil replaced Harrison and Doucoure. So the manager got it wrong in the first half, but made all the right decisions after the break.\nI thought Alcaraz really grew into the game.\n166 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:47:55\nJust to see rat boy's ugly mug…\n167 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:53:07\nAs soon as I see your name Neil @ 158, I know the same tired cliche is on its way.\nIronically, you are almost hysterical yourself in screaming about anti-Moyes bias.. usually preceded by “I never wanted Moyes but.” Sure buddy.\nAt least try and come up with some variation to it, so we are not all bored to death.\n168 Posted 10/05/2025 at 17:56:34\nHowever, a Moyes masterclass if ever there was one. Bringing the calvary on when they're really needed. Those thousand odd games in the Premier League count for something.\nThis was how you manage your playing resources to get maximum effect. COYB!\n169 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:01:05\nTaking off Doucoure and Harrison changed things around. Harrison was doing well, but Doucoure was atrocious. Beto was poor and he got lucky with his goal, really poor goalkeeping.\nKeane played well – not only the goal but the couple of pinpoint cross-field passes that he played were quite breathtaking. And he was solid most of the game. Enough to convince Moyes to give him a new contract? Possibly.\nBut well done to the players and David Moyes. Huge improvement in the 2nd half to overturn a 0-1 deficit.\n170 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:01:32\nThat will have influenced his decision to play Doucoure and Harrison, to avoid being left wide open against two lads that are not first choice away from home.\nHis bench gave him the opportunity to change it up. I think that's key in the last 20 minutes of Premier League games, and so it proved.\nAs has been said, it's why hes managed a 1,000 games, and remains a respected figure in the game.\n171 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:04:52\nLess said about the 1st half, the better!\n172 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:06:46\nHe took over a sinking ship utterly devoid of confidence and he has us doing well with the bare bones of resources at his disposal. Let's at least give him the summer window and a pre-season to see if he can get anywhere near some of your impossible expectations of him so far.\nNot the best performance first half, far from it in fact, but it's a points game, can't wait for next season!\nWell done, Moyes and Everton. I've just cracked a beer. COYB.\n173 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:11:49\nBut you often see keepers make mistakes when the striker takes the shot early. They don't get 'set' properly.\n174 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:15:57\nHe was left a shit hand but has dealt with it brilliantly.\n4 cracking away wins at Palace, Brighton, Forest and Fulham, not many managers in the league with a struggling side would come away with maximum points from those.\nYes, the home form has been shit, thanks, Sean, but sign off with a good win next week and we will all go home from our last ever game at the POld Tart more than happy.\nOnwards and upwards at the new cathedral then!\n175 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:21:04\nWe all know some of these players are limited but Moyes doesn't have a lot of options (and the options he does have are coming back to fitness, which is why they're used sparingly).\nLet's get behind Moyes and the squad and see this season out.\n176 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:23:11\nI couldn't have said it better.\n177 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:26:05\nOf course we dream but dreaded Everton v Shrewsbury or someone in the new stadium.\nNow stop whinging. Just a few months ago, we were fucked. Reality.\n178 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:28:46\nFor some reason, with 10-15 minutes to go, he kept on kicking the ball into touch. Weird boy.\n179 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:30:57\nIf you read my posts, they have consistently stated that I believe he was the only option available.\nI'm also bored with the same old culprits constantly looking to find fault.\n180 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:35:18\nThus is what I tried to post at half-time. I didn't think I was prophetic, I just found it again, so posted for its irony. No offence intended. No, just looking for some balance.\nI'm not pro- or anti-Moyes. I definitely didn't fancy Dyche to keep us safe so we did need a change. I didn't see too many candidates putting their hand up for the job so Moyes was probably the only option at the time.\n1:1 Not too bad so far but would love a win. Maybe Keane to score it? [Tongue-in-Cheek joke]\n181 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:40:49\nHis name on the teamsheet causes dread, anger and incredulity. We are all fully aware of his shortcomings.\nHowever here we are, and there's a guy who hasn't played for ages. O'Brien is out – still not sure why? Keane steps in and, in my opinion, he was the Man of the Match\nJust can't work it out? No doubt he'll go seasons end but someone will pick him up. Good on him.\n183 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:41:23\nWhen better footballers came on, I also hoped that Alcaraz would be kept on and moved central. Moyes used his subs well today, he didn't last week, and the brains did a lot more than the brawn and got us the points.\nI thought we deserved the win but again why was VAR used for Everton's second goal and Mykolenko's handball?\nThere was nothing to see over the goal although they had a very long look, desperate to find something wrong.\nIt was great to see a referee sticking to his decision rather than be persuaded by those interfering part-time refs in the studio.\nJust get us that win in the final game at The Old Lady and get the points that gets us a lot more money for a higher position and leave us all with smiles on our faces and a final winning memory.\n184 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:50:30\nThe fortunate goal before half-time allowed us to do that (mix it up). And our manager did it. I have reservations about Davie, but he managed that 2nd half superbly.\nI'm absolutely made up for everyone who travelled, it sounded magnificent, and it must have been brilliant when Séamus came on.\nFinally, top marks to the referee. It looked as though the faceless ones were trying to tell him that Mykolenko handled it, but he was, rightly, having none of it.\n185 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:52:04\nKeane had to play because O'Brien was injured, no problem with that. But were we right, because when Moyes replaced Harrison and Doucoure with McNeil and Ndiaye, we were a much better team. The 2nd half was a complete contrast to the 1st, so totally vindicated.\nHaving said that, I'm totally lost when Michael and Co start saying how lucky we were with the first and third goal, guys credit Moyes, that's football.\n186 Posted 10/05/2025 at 18:56:40\nNow we just have to beat Southampton in the last game at Goodison to finish above the media darlings.\nOne thing that bugs me enormously though is VAR's determination to overturn our goals or give a penalty against us. A blind man could see Keane's header was not offside so why check that after deciding there was no foul on the keeper? And as for the penalty review, it is becoming tedious now. The ball was a yard away from Mykolenko. What was he supposed to do? Chop his arms off.\nIf it takes 3 or 4 minutes to review a referee's decision in real time then there is something wrong with the individuals doing the review.\n187 Posted 10/05/2025 at 19:07:38\nFair play to Keane — he had a very good game.\n188 Posted 10/05/2025 at 19:12:33\nSteve #172,\nWho are you calling old? You are a bit of a dinosaur yourself...\n189 Posted 10/05/2025 at 19:24:51\nI love to see Alcaraz pushing forward and releasing Beto to score. Beto is great when he has that service.\nWell done, Blues, and well done to the travelling Evertonians who have always given incredible support to the team. Wish I was there.\n190 Posted 10/05/2025 at 19:39:26\nPatterson or Dixon\nMykolenko\nBranthwaite\nKeane\nGarner\nGana\nAlcaraz\nNdiaye\nMcNeil\nBeto\nI assume that's the side people wanted to see.\nTo me that looks decent going forward, but weak out of possession away from home. There is a lack of match fitness in some also, and on a bad day would be shipping in multiple goals.\nIt also leaves little genuine game changers from the bench. Last week, the combination of McNeil, Ndiaye and Alcaraz didn't work, so trying again from the off was unlikely.\nHis enforced selection had me worried. But credit to them for staying in the 2nd half, and then hitting Fulham.\nThe snipping from those that don't want Moyes is tiresome. He's come in and turned it around. Please give him some credit and please reserve any judgement until he's brought his own players in.\nEvery one of us want the blue boys to move forward. It's clear that there is going to be no sackings to bring some hipster to take us to a promised land of make believe. The club needs stability and it needs good players coming in. Moyes over the next 2 years is the best bet to achieve both.\n191 Posted 10/05/2025 at 19:39:30\nTo me, Moyes just demonstrated he is a superior manager to Dyche. Facing some similar constraints, Moyes has continually come up with solutions more favorable to the players' skill set and desire to play proper football.\nTypically, this group would try and would somehow experience a relapse. Whether by bounce or actual tactics they now show some resilience. That's not a new manager bounce or luck, that is possibly a feature of team spirit Andy talked about. Moyes gets credit for that.\nI don't like the move, and I am with those who think we would have survived. That said, Moyes is preserving a lot of potential transfer value that the club desperately needs to turn the squad over.\nIt's not like anyone wishes for Moyes to fail just to be right. On the other side, there are clear similarities in what Dyche and Moyes bring to clubs at different levels. This level was perhaps a bit above Dyche's but around Moyes'. If you were asking for a revolution from Dycheball, there is room to believe that you did not get it with the arrival of Moyes.\nIt may turn out to be a sensible move in tbe uncertainty of funding what needs to be done in the next few transfer windows.\n192 Posted 10/05/2025 at 19:41:31\n'Michael Keane sent a bullet header that almost burst the Fulham net.'\n193 Posted 10/05/2025 at 19:50:31\n100 out of 10 for our truly amazing supporters. Relentless from start to finish.\nThe new Pickford song is great. At one point, it seemed not to stop.\nWe even got a rendition of \"Everton, oh we love Everton\" at half time on the concourse.\n194 Posted 10/05/2025 at 20:01:31\nGood to see team running forwards. Good result today. Well done, Mr Moyes, cant beat a win in the sun!\n195 Posted 10/05/2025 at 20:19:42\n196 Posted 10/05/2025 at 20:21:25\n197 Posted 10/05/2025 at 20:25:09\nWatching Springsteen on Wednesday night, last game at Goodison on Sunday.\n198 Posted 10/05/2025 at 20:28:00\n199 Posted 10/05/2025 at 20:39:18\nHowever, regardless, this kid Alcaraz, well if they're talking £12-15M?\nSeems a steal!\nGreat result today. Pickford and Keane were immense!\n200 Posted 10/05/2025 at 20:46:54\n201 Posted 10/05/2025 at 20:55:20\nHe made an error of judgement last week, by listening to us, and corrected that this week.\nFor example pairing Patterson and McNeil on the right from the start last week we payed the price. Patterson was all over the place and even on a good day McNeil doesn’t provide sufficient cover to compensate.\nBut today Young and Harrison were solid, as was the much maligned Michael Keane, with Mykolenko probably having his best game yet in a blue shirt, and Gueye & Garner were outstanding. That solidity kept us in the game, and despite all these TV pundits talking us down, we kept Fulham’s real chances to being few and far between, and even their headed goal was a defensive misjudgement by Branthwaite and Mykolenko.\nBut Moyes played his hand brilliantly by bringing on the subs at the point when the Fulham players were tiring and the likes of McNeil and N’diaye could have maximum impact, unlike last week where both were on from the start and neither looked fit and had minimum affect. So hands up, Mr. Moyes you’re more of a manager than any of us👍💙\n202 Posted 10/05/2025 at 21:02:17\nThat landing was how you do rotator cuff injuries. And they can be a real prick of an injury and even worse of a surgery/recovery.\nHopefully he's dodged it.\n203 Posted 10/05/2025 at 21:05:33\nPete #200, you beat me to it. Too quick.\n204 Posted 10/05/2025 at 21:10:06\nTotally agree\nWe lost a 2:0 lead last week because playing Ndiaye, McNeill and Alcaraz would have left us totally exposed at the back, considering that format had not played together. Needed Harrison and Doucs to work defensively to try and contain Fulham and hopefully sneak a goal later when the game opened up..\nBasically that is what we did.\n205 Posted 10/05/2025 at 21:10:14\nA first half, where we were initially outplayed by a good Fulham side, came good for us and, by the end of the half, we had equalised and were the better side. Their goal was a superb header by Jiminez, ours a decently worked effort by Mykolenko.\nIn the second half, we were superb and neither goal was lucky. We took over the game completely, breaking down their attacks and playing the ball out really well.\nOur Men of the Match? Jordan as always but this time Keano too, superb not only defensively but his play out of defence was superb at times. Garner and Gana top class.\nWho had a bad match? Nobody apart from Jack Harrison who tries so hard but looks to be not up to this level of game; everybody else played well overall.\nSubstitutions? Really well done and at 60 minutes to give time. All subs knew what was needed of them and all fitted in to improve the team.\nA superb performance, a beautiful day on a beautiful ground, with beautiful friends and a great bunch of travelling fans at the ground. I could possibly raise the odd criticism but why after a performance like that?\nTwo awful VARs and 10 minutes overtime but Fulham by then were never going to touch us.\nMy Mother told me that there'd be days like this.\n206 Posted 10/05/2025 at 21:18:11\nNice to see Beto get his 10th goal of the season in only 1500 minutes. He’s certainly got things to work on but seems to get the ball in the net by hook or by crook.\n207 Posted 10/05/2025 at 21:37:31\nI'm not sure why some (not all) posts have descended into oneupmanship and gloating over \"Moyes haters\".\nWe've just won a game of football some this morning predicted we wouldn't.\nThe supporters had a great day out, as I'm sure those watching and listening at home did.\nEnjoy it and Match of the Day in an hour.\nWrong selection, good changes. Who cares? We played well once we woke up. And Everton won. Thats what matters.\n208 Posted 10/05/2025 at 21:46:03\n209 Posted 10/05/2025 at 21:54:22\n\"He's a Maccam, he's a blue, he's a toffee through and through. He hates Newcastle, he hates the white, Jordan Pickford is dynamite\"\n210 Posted 10/05/2025 at 21:59:01\n211 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:04:58\n212 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:05:35\nI'd have gone for \"the shite\".\n213 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:08:03\nPissed\nExstatic\nUTFT\n214 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:09:45\n215 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:16:11\n216 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:18:25\nThe team did alright too.\nWell in blues. UTFT!\n217 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:26:53\nToday, I don't think he was lucky at all with his goal. I think he caught Leno out by striking the ball well and early.\nThat's now 8 in 28 league games and 12 in 33 all competitions. That's really not bad at all in fairness.\nBy contrast, Liam Delap has 12 in 38 (all competitions) - and he gets a lot more support in a very attacking Ipswich side.\n218 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:32:09\nInflation runs higher in the transfer market than normal life. And just think of the price of a pint these days.\n219 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:32:30\n220 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:33:19\nIt's 8 goals in 15 full games equivalent (1350 minutes).\nHe's also missed 10 big chances. He's getting into goal scoring positions.\nWill be interesting whether we are prepared to sell that?\n221 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:35:39\nMaybe if we view him as a useful prem ready squad player, that's enough..\n222 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:37:37\nGangly, clumsy, couldn't trap a bag of sand etc. But does have a goal threat. Not to be sniffed at.\n223 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:37:40\n224 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:49:35\nNot sure if you are including me in those comments\nI have been already been accused of being a Moyes cheerleader #35 ir tiresome #167 but if you read the first 20 post most (not all) are slating of the team selection and the manager. I prefer balance not bias and will call out posts where I think bias is blinding fair analysis (caveat IMO). For me the most measured posts are from Ian #190 and Erik #201.\nAs you often say we are all Blues and want our team to win. Today was a good day so let’s enjoy the moment.\n225 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:52:56\nSince David Moyes’ first Premier League game back with Everton (15 January), only three players have scored more goals in the league than Beto: Isak, Salah and Mateta.\n226 Posted 10/05/2025 at 22:53:49\nAsking Delap to hit the ground running at a bigger club is a challenge, see Hoiyland, so to me id keep Beto - and lose dcl.\nYes Dcl is a more of a neat footballer, but if he\"s not getting chances or converting them, isn't what we need.\n227 Posted 10/05/2025 at 23:01:12\n228 Posted 10/05/2025 at 23:04:41\nDanny quite often calls out those who criticise the \"Moye's bashers\".\nNever seems to intervene to the same extent to defend the Blues who are supportive of the manager.\n229 Posted 10/05/2025 at 23:20:11\nSpot on mate !\n230 Posted 10/05/2025 at 23:51:02\nI'd just rather the conversation didn't go that way.\nWe can all debate the manager and players and that is fine.\nThat's a bit unfair to be honest Brendan mate. I will call out people with my own views. I don't see why I should defend anyone's on either side of the divide.\nUnfortunately, his re-appointment was always going to create this. I'd rather just concentrate on the good job he's done so far and hope he get's the backing to build on it in the summer for next season.\nI'll question anyone, just as anyone can question me. Big shoulders and I never take offence.\n231 Posted 11/05/2025 at 00:09:10\nLet’s finish ahead of Utd, Spurs, Wolves & the Hammers!\n232 Posted 11/05/2025 at 01:21:39\n233 Posted 11/05/2025 at 04:25:39\nVs Fulham we go behind early then win 3-1 and (some) people aren't too happy.\nVs Bayern we go behind early and win 3-1 and it's the greatest game ever.\nWho said football fans are fickle?\n234 Posted 11/05/2025 at 05:09:09\nMy sense is that there will be better alternatives internationally, but it would be great to hear who could be considered.\n235 Posted 11/05/2025 at 05:21:42\nDefinitely a game of 2 halves (I long for a full pint of Everton one day).\nI watched the highlights on MOTD early this morning, and felt the edit showed that they were trying to show a game of two halves.\nI felt Myko was at fault for the 1st goal, but to be fair, I think that was Raul Jiménez's 6th goal against us (?) and I wasn't surprised he out-jumped Myko.\nLater in the game it was shown that Myko misplaced a pass - I couldn't be arsed to rewind to see who it was - but someone in our midfield played a horrible ball to him, and unfortunately he doesn't have legs like Inspector Gadget.\nGood goal from Keane. \"Celebrated\" like someone who knows he's gone at the end of the season.\nI know Beto's goal was assisted by Leno, but he hit it first time, which I think caught Leno off guard.\nThe pundits gave Pickford MOTM - by some distance. Now here's my controversial point. Does anyone think Beto looks a different player under Moyes (pretty much in the same team he was labouring under Dyche previously)? Moyes made the point in his post-match commentary that if he was 19, you'd work on certain areas... Beto himself said he feels like he's improving - as long as he's playing.\nThat's now 10 for the season... not bad in that team? So would you try to cash in on a 27/28 year old or keep him as a back up (not sure he'd like that himself, but it's a squad game).\n236 Posted 11/05/2025 at 05:35:13\n237 Posted 11/05/2025 at 06:20:06\nThis is all if's, but's and maybe's, but if DCL does decide to stay on, and on the assumption we have a limited budget and other priorities, I personally don't think going into next season with DCL, Beto, Chermiti (another year older etc.) and a.n.other or someone stepping up, would be the worst outcome.\nAlso partly as I still have sleepless nights of some of the shaftings we've had when buying big-ticket strikers in recent history.\n238 Posted 11/05/2025 at 07:26:29\nI agree\nIt frustrated the hell out of me when this thread started off being about Moyes rather than discuss options available with Jake out.\n239 Posted 11/05/2025 at 07:37:49\n240 Posted 11/05/2025 at 07:38:54\nIf the budget is £30m, that's really not a lot of money for a Premier League transfer - especially a striker. It's less than Villa paid for Ollie Watkins nearly 5 years ago. It's £20m short of what Wolves paid for Cunha 2 years ago.\nIn world football, there won't be many who would cost that little and deliver more than about 8 to 12 goals in their first season.\nOn that basis, for the £30m release clause, I think Delap is probably one of the best options out there.\nOther good options would include:\nFerguson (Brighton) - although probably costs more than £30m.\nCastro (Bologna) - again probably costs more than £30m. He's the most talented and potentially gettable striker out there.\nBonny (Parma)\nBarry (Villareal)\nEmegha (Strasbourg)\nArokdare (Genk)\nThe latter four could kick on and develop into a Marcus Thuram quality player - but equally might be more likely to plateau out as a Beto standard player (or like Onuachu at Saints, fall well short of Beto).\nThat's the problem with trying to buy \"ready made\". At that price, all you're really doing is stock piling players who are no better than the players you already have.\nPersonally, I think it is better to hunt around for players of exceptional talent aged 16 to 20 - and then try to develop them over a few years. Even then, many of the most likely have already moved recently - Tzimas (Brighton), Harder (Lisbon), Oskarsson (Sociedad), Tel (Spurs) and Kroupi (Bournemouth). But Franculino (Midtylland), Stassin (St Etienne) and Ivanovic (Millwall) stand out as interesting options amongst dozens and dozens of much younger players.\n241 Posted 11/05/2025 at 07:41:25\n242 Posted 11/05/2025 at 07:42:45\nOther options might be Mika Biereth, Arnaud Kalimuendo, Lucas Stassin, Tolu Arkodare, Mikkel Bro Hansen, Hugo Ekitike (likely too expensive), Manfred Ugalde, Franjo Ivanovic, Simon Banza.\n243 Posted 11/05/2025 at 07:45:23\nBireth is a good shout Sam but now likely to cost more than £30m.\n244 Posted 11/05/2025 at 07:58:12\n245 Posted 11/05/2025 at 08:11:19\n246 Posted 11/05/2025 at 08:12:20\nKeep an eye on Jackson at Chelsea if hes surplus to requirements. Ekitike is as likely as Jonathan David sadly.\nIt's going to be hard to find a better goal scorer than Beto. I do think he can score 10-15 goals over a full season if he's given the minutes. Yes, I cant believe I typed that.\nNot the most polished clearly, but he's getting chances. It's when strikers don't get chances you've an issue.\n247 Posted 11/05/2025 at 08:32:21\nI think an all rounded striker like Guessand is the way forward. Ekitike looks to have an all round skill set too but will be too expensive I suspect.\nDepending on what money is availbale I think its quite possible we go into next season without a new striker (maybe another option if DCL leaves). It will be harder to improve on Beto than it will be at RW, RB and CM.\nI don't think Ferguson will cost more than £30m any more for what it's worth. He's had 2 dud seasons (due to injury mainly) and is 21 soon with less than 15 club goals since he broke onto the scene young. Could be a risk worth taking for someone but I'd be surprised if he cost more than £25m at this point.\n248 Posted 11/05/2025 at 08:37:52\n249 Posted 11/05/2025 at 08:39:48\nBeyond that, probably better to stick with Beto and stock up on a few high potential teenagers who cost up to around the £20m mark.\nWilson, Ings and (of course) DCL are available as free transfers. So could provide cover (although wages are high and injuries an issue)\nAnd I could see a decent logic to giving Broja another go on loan. He has talent and once he gets a run of games could start scoring.\n250 Posted 11/05/2025 at 09:00:47\nFor the first goal Myko didn't hit the shot particularly well but it got a great, for us, deflection and went in.\nFor the third goal Alcaraz's pass to Beto had a real touch of good fortune in that the pass itself ended up being the pass he intended only because it caught the defender's leg and fell very nicely for Beto.\nBeto's goal itself, which he hit well, but in most games the keeper would have saved that rather than failing to deal with that bounce just as it got to him.\nI make the point not to denigrate any player but, as I said, just to show how very small margins can have a huge effect on the outcome.\nYesterday those small margins went very much in our favour but, as we all know but lots seem sometimes unable to accept, the difference between scoring and not scoring doesn't always make the player attempting to score a donkey, or useless, or \"get rid\" material.\n251 Posted 11/05/2025 at 09:02:44\nSorry Billy # 227, I know it was you. I guess it’s so easy to forget past results at some grounds, whilst some stick in the head ie Anfield, OT, Stamford Bridge etc.\nDefinitely a game of two halves. A couple of decent saves by JP to keep us in the game until a (in my opinion) flukey equaliser by Myko took us in level at half time. Another great save by JP to keep the game level until Keane and Beto stepped up to finish the game. Plenty of debate between our gang as to whether it was a foul by Charly on their defender for the corner from which we scored. I say it was a fair shoulder to shoulder, whilst Dave thinks it was a push by Charly. And why the long VAR review for the goal? First of all the screen said possible foul, then possible offside? Having seen the goal on MOTD, there is clearly no foul by anyone and no flick on to Keane, and we all know you can’t be offside from a corner, so what were they looking for? The third goal, another break by Charly, we’ve definitely got to sign him up, and a first time shot by Beto, with a massive helping hand from Leno to finish the game. I can just imagine the uproar on here if JP had made that error!!\nThe traffic report flashing up on the screen towards the end of the game did not make good reading…….Putney Bridge closed, meant a long walk to Hammersmith, meant we didn’t get back to Euston till about 18.30. Still enough time for a couple before the 19.40 train, when we were joined again by the team!\nSo overall, a good day out. I’d say JP was MOTM, and I can’t wait for the visit to Skunksville in two weeks time when the new song for JP will be booming out up in the gods. The skunk maggots will definitely be dragging their knuckles when they hear this one!!\n252 Posted 11/05/2025 at 09:05:11\n253 Posted 11/05/2025 at 09:11:05\nI will personally apologise for the trains. I think it is me. I am cursed!!\nBrian, I'm still on a high from yesterday. Transfer talk can wait until the summer as it isn't going to affect the next two matches.\nI'm just enjoying a great win and looking forward to the next one.\nThe only players that can deliver that are the ones we have now.\n254 Posted 11/05/2025 at 09:20:24\n255 Posted 11/05/2025 at 09:23:31\nSometimes the manager will get the rub of the green and therefore have got the tactics right. Sometimes the ball just won’t go in and the manager will be incompetent.\n256 Posted 11/05/2025 at 09:25:38\nThe manager has to decide. That's his job. It didn't pay off, but he changed it, which did.\n257 Posted 11/05/2025 at 09:32:50\n258 Posted 11/05/2025 at 10:12:23\ndon t score enough goals, but surely that is heard at every football club, but I was suprised to hear yesterday, that Danny Wellbeck reached double figures for the first time in his career, with that penalty.\n259 Posted 11/05/2025 at 10:24:13\n260 Posted 11/05/2025 at 10:31:37\nI would respectfully disagree\nWhen I saw the team I also raised my eyebrows and went straight to the subs to check if Jake was there. When he wasn’t I think I understood the logic.\nIf he started with Ndiaye and McNeill I think we would be in danger of capitulating like last week. They are attack minded players. As I posted already, I think Harrison and Doucs were selected to protect an inexperienced defensive lineup until the game opened up and then bring on the two. Don’t think either are up to doing 90min yet\n261 Posted 11/05/2025 at 11:00:04\nI think its really worrying to see you say it was better he started with Harrison and Doucoure to protect inexperienced defenders. Keane and Young have played 100s of games, Branthwaite has been a regular for practically 2 seasons and Mykolenko has played for the last few years. We should be starting with our strongest side which in my opinion doesn't include Harrison and probably Doucoure, the fact we went 2 up against Ipswich then gave up the lead was nothing to do with having attacking players starting a game it was silly individual mistakes that stopped us winning that game.\nHave we been ground down so much over the last few years that some fans are now wanting to see players who can fill a defensive jobs rather than creative players.\n262 Posted 11/05/2025 at 11:10:19\nQuite a few were a bit concerned that young Jake didn't feature at all. I certainly must have missed any reports of him being injured.\nIt was good management by Moyes yesterday. I think in the main the criticism of the starting line up was the persistence with Doucoure and Harrison. He's obviously got his reasons and I'm guessing that's work rate, but you couldn't question any of those players in the second half for work rate off the ball.\nPoor Beto was, once again, running on empty, but kept going.\n263 Posted 11/05/2025 at 11:11:15\nI can’t believe some people on Twitter are now suggesting we should keep Keane (Doucoure/Harrison) because he showed some basic competence as a defender yesterday. And the other two for their work rate,\nThis is why Everton needs a total mentality reset. NSNO needs to be respected, and obeyed, again.\n264 Posted 11/05/2025 at 11:18:41\nBesides, we had Gana and Garner sat in front of the defence to do that job.\nJust like we shouldn't get carried away with a half's worth of a decent performance and result this week, I don't think we should judge on last week's either.\nWe were very poor for nearly 45 minutes yesterday and it would have been no surprise had we headed for the tunnel trailing at the break. Possibly by more where it not for a very good save by Pickford.\n265 Posted 11/05/2025 at 11:20:03\nIwobi, Smith Rowe, Pereira, Wilson, Sessengnon, jimenez are all good ball players. Better than ours at least as a collective.\nTactically he will have decided that the counter press was the way to stop them playing.\nDefeatist? I am not sure a midfield of Garner, Gana, Alcaraz, Ndiaye and Mcneil controls thst midfield- and with Keane and young that's a fair gamble away from home.\n4 wins away from home in the last 8, vs 1 in 21 previously if I heard it right.\n266 Posted 11/05/2025 at 11:29:05\nAs Brian points out earlier, this was a game of fine margins. We did deserve to win in the end but got back into it with a lucky deflection.\nAs all of our past 4 managers have concluded, our limited attacking talent means we're more likely to get a good result playing conservatively.\nWith someone like Ipswich's McKenna as manager - we would definitely approach the game differently. Players like Ndiaye and McNeil would start and we would take the initiative and attack the opposition.\nHowever, that leaves us vulnerable on the counter and space in open play to pick off an exposed 40 year old full back and slow as a snail Michael Keane. Our defence is so good because the whole team prioritises the defensive effort (none more so than Harrison and Doucoure), not because the defensive players are good.\nYou might have been more likely to get a 4-3 Fulham win than a 1-3 Everton win.\nAt some point I would like us to go with a manager like McKenna - but realistically, he is probably the sort of guy who might takeover once Moyes has steadied the ship and sorted out a firmly bottom half bunch of players (especially in attack / wide). In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if McKenna does join us after being sacked by Spurs in a couple of years...\n267 Posted 11/05/2025 at 11:40:57\nRobert, I'll have to be convinced by McKenna. It might be me being harsh or uneducated, but I instantly think of Graham Potter or, worse still, Mike Walker.\nYou are right about Moyes. He can and should stabilise us, but I don't see us lifting up any trees with him at the helm. I genuinely hope I am wrong. Time will tell.\nThe summer will tell us a lot about our ambition. Not just the manager, the club.\n268 Posted 11/05/2025 at 11:53:56\nThis is the thing that gets me so exasperated.\nOf course Moyes will not pull up any trees in the next two years. In June we will have a squad of 13 first team players, quite a few of whom aren't very good. It also looks likely we'll have only a modest kitty (anything below £75m net spend being modest these days compared to what the likes of Palace, Bournemouth, Forest, Brighton etc have all been spending).\nSo if you want someone to play front foot football next season (which Moyes generally won't) then you have to accept there's a good chance our results will be worse, not better (albeit we'll see more goals).\nThe thing that is really stopping us from playing successful front foot football (and choosing managers who do that) is the crap squad.\n269 Posted 11/05/2025 at 11:54:56\n270 Posted 11/05/2025 at 12:06:49\nAnd he's a ringer for Kurtan Mucklowe from 'This Country'\n271 Posted 11/05/2025 at 12:17:09\nThe game did not change because Doucourie was substituted. it changed as a direct result of his persistence which lead to our equalizer.\nWithout that goal, we go in at half time trailing having been comprehensively outplayed. Fulham, on the other hand would have gone in leading after completely dominating.\nThey say goals change games, but so does a kick in the bollocks. Fulham simply didnt recover from from a 48th minute kick in the bollocks\n272 Posted 11/05/2025 at 12:24:14\n273 Posted 11/05/2025 at 12:31:41\nI don't do band wagons. Not even against puppy dogs.\nThat means I wont say a game changed when a player went off the pitch when I clearly saw it change when he was on it and he had contributed to the change.\n274 Posted 11/05/2025 at 12:35:44\nWho knows best — you or Everton's coaching staff? Not being funny but we must also accept our own shortcomings sometimes.\n275 Posted 11/05/2025 at 12:49:15\n276 Posted 11/05/2025 at 12:56:12\nI like Doucoure. I thought he was better at Watford than he is for us. He’s a big lad who causes defences trouble, but players like that are ten a penny. We need someone who can trap a ball, defend a ball, pass a ball. These are qualities Duke lacks.\nAs for Harrison? No comment\nSorry, CC, I just re-read your previous post and it seems we do agree about Doucoure.\n277 Posted 11/05/2025 at 12:58:28\n278 Posted 11/05/2025 at 13:01:40\n279 Posted 11/05/2025 at 13:01:55\n\"You need to accept\" that you maybe.... Actually, you are, definitely are talking shite.\nIt wasnt just me who saw Doucourie's contribution to our equalizer. nearly thirty thousand people inside Craven cottage saw it too. Not to mention the millions who saw it on their TV's.\n\"Not being funny\" but I didnt mention Selection. Moyes, or his coaching staff.\n280 Posted 11/05/2025 at 13:12:02\nId say yes, it's a very good turn around compared to the prior 4 or 5 years. Add in the squad quality and injuries.\n281 Posted 11/05/2025 at 13:36:52\nStrange lot.\n282 Posted 11/05/2025 at 13:51:47\n283 Posted 11/05/2025 at 14:34:19\n284 Posted 11/05/2025 at 15:00:01\nWe won all three of those.\nSo he / we can do it. We all know the limitations of the current players, but there are enough in the team to do it.\nThat's why my main point was that the summer will tell us a lot in terms of ambition. And for next season, not 2 or 3 years time. It will be a stepping stone, but we should expect forward (no pun) movement.\nI mentioned Doucoure in my own report, which is yet to appear. I did mention him being involved in the equaliser, but aside from that, he was poor. But then so were most of the players in the first half, Pickford and Keane aside.\nWe all judge players on performances, be it individual games or over the course of season(s).\n285 Posted 11/05/2025 at 15:12:31\nWe bought him the cheapest ticket we could - last row next to the away fans. Somehow (?!) he just waltzed in with the away fans and ended up in the away section.\nHe was over the moon, had the time of his life. What a game to see! Three goals. He sent us videos and you'd of thought we'd won the league! 😂. He'll never forget it as long as he lives.\nSomeone named Paul bought him a beer. Paul said he knew me through TW. When I asked, \"Paul who?\" My son, bless him, replied, \"I don't know.\" 🙄\nTo Paul - please identiy yourself so I know who bought him the beer, and thank you!!!\n286 Posted 11/05/2025 at 15:16:14\nI did it myself for the second half. There is no segregation on the concourse, and the stewards don't check. Everyone stands anyway, so as long as you could squeeze in next to someone, it was fine.\n287 Posted 11/05/2025 at 15:34:24\nHe was just thrilled.\nIt was hilariious. On the second goal he sent video and you could hear him give three quick but strong, \"WOOO\"s.\nMy family was like, SO American...\nHe probably stuck out like a sore thumb but didn't care at all. 😂\n288 Posted 11/05/2025 at 15:36:08\n289 Posted 11/05/2025 at 15:36:28\n290 Posted 11/05/2025 at 15:41:30\nLiverpool away was a better performance.\n291 Posted 11/05/2025 at 16:00:40\nI thought they managed the game very well against city, with it going city's way after the Tarkowski injury. Before hand city didn't look their normal self.\nVilla I thought it was a brighter performance, despite him only have the players for a day or two. I remember getting done on the counter-attack by Watkins, with Calvert-Lewin having some very presentable chances and a good penalty shout.\nCertainly not a lot between both those sides, whilst they stayed in the game against Chelsea. Certainly an improvement on the prior year at Stamford Bridge.\nLimited squad, injuries to lots of players. Biggest defeat by 2, once, and three 1 nils.\n292 Posted 11/05/2025 at 17:49:38\n293 Posted 11/05/2025 at 18:04:09\n294 Posted 11/05/2025 at 18:08:11\nHaving said that most agreed that the lineup was strange and didn't give us much confidence about winning.\nHowever footie being unpredictable as it is, there was always the outside chance especially as they had unexpectedly beaten Forest a few weeks back.\nNot surprisingly the first half was awful except for the fluke equalizer and the performance was still shaky until the substitutions.\nI was glad to see Robinson not playing especially with Young at right back. Young's tackling is poor to say the least.\nAlcaraz for me was excellent and I do hope he is kept as a starter.\n295 Posted 11/05/2025 at 22:17:40\nThanks for it, and very best wishes to your lad.\n296 Posted 11/05/2025 at 22:30:26\n297 Posted 11/05/2025 at 23:26:27\nThank you. Sincerely hoping I find out who the \"mystery Paul\" is.\nHewitt? Can't be Ferry he's stateside. Kossoff?\nColin is already in Rome now. He's doing the smash n grab Euro tour. Then back to London for a week for his study program, then to Dublin for 2.5 days.\nHis father wouldn't let him go to Europe without seeing the Vatican and going to Ireland. 😜\n298 Posted 12/05/2025 at 03:41:51\nVery nice story on the lad. I watched the game back yesterday and there's a lad in a black top in the seat nearest to the 3000 going apeshit when we scored.\nLots of folk on here just read and choose not to write and that might be your Paul.\n299 Posted 12/05/2025 at 04:53:33\nKids are lucky these days, they have such amazing experiences. A trip to Cornwall for our hols was the most we could expect when I was a nipper.\n300 Posted 12/05/2025 at 05:19:33\nI always enjoy reading your posts even if we don’t always agree. You make your points really well, and that makes them very interesting.\nI have never once read you critique a post as “anti-Moyes brigade” simply because a fellow fan posted that a differing opinion on the team’s selection, gameplan, performance or substitutions.\nIf a poster wants to set out why Mr Moyes has done a brilliant job, then great. I think he has done a good job overall so the differences are marginal. In certain games, I think he has surrendered the initiative to high quality teams in poor form due to his caution (as he has done for most of his career).\nBut, I admired the way he changed things against Fulham after getting the initial line-up, frankly, completely wrong. Decisiveness, willingness to make changes and go for games will win Mr Moyes admirers from all Blues.\nIn the last 11 games, he has smacked into the reality of a poor quality squad, made worse by injuries to key players. He needs serious backing in the transfer market in the summer if we are to progress. If he doesn’t get it, fans should focus on the owners not the manager.\n301 Posted 12/05/2025 at 06:03:08\n302 Posted 12/05/2025 at 06:12:36\nMy main memory of our holiday to Cornwall was that the car broke down outside Newquay, and my poor old man spent the first few days of the break fixing it.\n305 Posted 12/05/2025 at 07:35:51\n306 Posted 12/05/2025 at 20:47:13\nWere you hiding from the round again??\n307 Posted 12/05/2025 at 20:49:12\nWe were in The Rocket near Putney Bridge before the match, then headed straight back to Euston afterwards.\n308 Posted 12/05/2025 at 21:02:03\n309 Posted 13/05/2025 at 09:48:34\nSorry that we didn't get to see you in the Eight Bells, Rob.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
