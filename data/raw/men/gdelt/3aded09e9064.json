  "body_text": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Aryna Sabalenka has advanced to her fourth consecutive Australian Open final and its a rematch of the 2023 decider against Elena Rybakina. The top-ranked Sabalenka defeated Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-3 and moved to within one victory of a third title in four years at Melbourne Park. Fifth-seeded Rybakina beat sixth-seeded Jessica Pegula 6-3, 7-6 in the second semifinal. Rybakina was the 2022 Wimbledon champion and runner-up here to Sabalenka three years ago. A point penalty for hindrance against Sabalenka at the start of the fourth game proved to be only a momentary distraction.\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — Count New England Patriots team owner Robert Kraft among those shocked that Bill Belichick reportedly will not be selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. In a statement to The Associated Press, Kraft said he believes Belichick’s accomplishments unequivocally merit election to the Hall on his first ballot. Citing unidentified sources, ESPN reported Tuesday that Belichick didn’t receive the necessary 40 votes from the 50-person panel of media members and other Hall of Famers. Tom Brady, who played under Belichick for 20 seasons and won six Super Bowl titles together, called that decision “completely ridiculous.”\nBill Belichick’s reported snub from the Pro Football Hall of Fame after winning a record six Super Bowl titles as a head coach has placed scrutiny on the process of picking pro football Hall of Famers. While the specific reasons why Belichick didn’t get into the Hall in his first year of eligibility are unknown, there are some possible explanations.\nMILWAUKEE (AP) — American speedskater Erin Jackson is the first Black woman to win an individual Winter Olympics gold medal in any sport. She wants to make sure she is not the last. Jackson will be at the Milan Cortina Games in February to defend the title she won in the 500 meters at Beijing four years ago. She also will be racing in the 1,000 meters. She has made it a goal to increase the number of minority women in her sport and wants to start a foundation after she retires from competition.\nSome blind and low-vision fans will have unprecedented access to the Super Bowl thanks to a tactile device that tracks the ball, vibrates on key plays and provides real-time audio. The NFL teamed up with OneCourt and Ticketmaster to pilot the game-enhancing experience 15 times during the regular-season during games hosted by five teams. About 10 blind and low-vision fans will have an opportunity to use the same technology at the Super Bowl when Seattle faces New England. With hands on the device, they will feel the location of the ball and hear what’s happening throughout the game.\nCLEVELAND (AP) — The Cleveland Browns hired Todd Monken as the franchise’s 19th full-time head coach, wrapping up a three-week search. He replaces Kevin Stefanski, who was fired on Jan. 5, the day after Cleveland finished a 5-12 season. This is Monken’s first NFL head coaching job after 11 years in the league as an assistant. He spent the previous three seasons as Baltimore’s offensive coordinator. He first interviewed on Jan. 10 and had a second interview on Jan. 20. Monken previously served as the Browns’ offensive coordinator in 2019.\nSTORRS, Conn. (AP) — Allie Ziebell had a UConn program record-tying 10 3-pointers and a career-high 34 points, and Sarah Strong had 19 of her 25 points in the first half as the top-ranked Huskies won their 38th consecutive game with a 97-39 win over Xavier on Wednesday night despite missing two of its top four scorers. Ashlynn Shade had 12 points, nine steals, six rebounds and six assists for UConn. It was the 50th regular-season win in a row in Big East play. Mariyah Noel had 12 points, and Meri Kanerva added 11 for Xavier.\nSAN DIEGO (AP) — Patrick Reed is leaving LIV Golf with an eye on returning to the PGA Tour. Reed is the second major champion to leave LIV. He posted his intentions Wednesday on social media. His decision comes the same week that Brooks Koepka returns to the PGA Tour at Torrey Pines. The PGA Tour has shared the news in a memo to players. Reed is eligible to return to the PGA Tour in September. It will be one year since he last played on LIV in August 2025. The tour season will be over by then but he can play in the fall.\nCLEVELAND (AP) — LeBron James doesn’t know if Wednesday night will end up being his last trip to Cleveland as a player. If James doesn’t return, the Cavaliers and their fans continued to let James know how much he means to them. James teared up during a video tribute played during a timeout in the first quarter. The 41-year-old Akron native wiped his eyes with a towel after the Cavs played highlights of him scoring 25 straight points in the 2007 Eastern Conference finals. The Lakers lost 129-99 to the Cavs, but James appreciated getting to see his son, Bronny James, play in the fourth quarter.\nReal Madrid was stunningly dumped into the knockout playoffs of the Champions League by its former coach Jose Mourinho and will be joined there by Paris Saint-Germain. Madrid started play third in the 36-team standings but despite two goals by Kylian Mbappé lost 4-2 at Benfica and fell to ninth — one place below advancing direct to the round of 16. Benfica only advanced to the knockout phase in 24th place because goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scored deep in stoppage time. PSG and Newcastle both started in the top eight but drew 1-1 in Paris. They fell to 11th and 12th respectively.\nFinals\nNATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE\nFinal N-Y Islanders 5 N-Y Rangers 2\nFinal Columbus 5 Philadelphia 3\nFinal Ottawa 5 Colorado 2\nTOP-25 COLLEGE BASKETBALL\nFinal (10)Houston 79 TCU 70\nFinal (19)Florida 95 South Carolina 48\nFinal (25)St. John's 92 Butler 70",
