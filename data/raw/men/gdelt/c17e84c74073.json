Both clubs offer a better opportunity for the midfielder than Newcastle at the moment.\nThe high interest in Pereira makes complete sense for all three teams who are looking to turnaround their disappointing season in the January transfer window by making new additions to the squad.\nHis technical skills and vision could help unlock opposition defenses, while his work rate would align well with the attacking style of play of Spurs and Villa.\nIt remains to be seen if Fulham would be open to the midfielder leaving in January. A move in the summer transfer window is more likely for the Brazilian.\nDespite Fulham having an impressive season, they could be forced to sell the player in the coming future.\nAnother midfielder being eyed by Villa is Chelsea midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall.",
