We will never forget days like this.\n“Next season I want to take another step forward. The goal at this club is to always win trophies so next season we want to add to that. We want to win the Champions League and win the Premier League again. Hopefully we can do that and make next season another special season. In every huddle Virgil [van Dijk] says enjoy the moment.

I am really happy and I want to enjoy this moment as much as we can. We know how in football things can change quickly. Tomorrow we go for a new challenge but we celebrate now.\n“We [the senior players] have built a really special bond and connections and it feels even more special to win titles with these kinds of connections.

If they didn’t believe me, they believe me now.”\nArne Slot’s interview on the team bus made it sound like - despite all his experiences and success this year - it has fully sunk in what it means managing his club.\n“It is beyond what you can dream of,” said Slot.\n“You cannot imagine what you see over here. I have won things before, and it is so beautiful, but this cannot compare to anything. It is (like a spiritual experience). You look into their eyes and it says it all. There are so many people.”\n05:20 PM BST\nPeople everywhere\nThere’s a cruise ship docked near the Liverpool bus’ final destination. Not sure whether to envy or sympathise with any passengers who’ve popped out for a quick stroll.\n05:19 PM BST\nThe thoughts of Arne Slot\n“This is by far the number one day, this is beyond what you can expect, what you can dream of maybe. This is unbelievable. I won a few things before and they were beautiful but this you cannot compare with anything. Young, old, every age is here. You look the fans in the eyes and you see it all.\n“You can hardly imagine that there are still more citizens of Liverpool still to come. All through the route there are so many people. This is beyond my dreams.”\nWhat a fella pic.twitter.com/tguQGQZ5ag\n— The Anfield Wrap (@TheAnfieldWrap) May 26, 2025\n05:15 PM BST\nInto the heart of the city\nThe bus is heading down Leeds Street and will soon be turning onto The Strand, ready to head past the Liver Building and the Albert Dock.

We deserve it, my teammates were incredible this year. This is an amazing achievement and we truly deserve to celebrate with the fans today. The parade for winning the European Championship was really good but today the city is crazy, it is madness out there. It is unbelievable.\n“I have to thank the fans for my song because I did not play too much this season but to get this love back from the fans is amazing. The song actually has a good tune. I am so proud of the team and from the moment I arrived they made me feel part of the team, supported me even during the tough times this season. I am one of the boys.”\nCalvin x Fede pic.twitter.com/h68YQjtJMK\n— DaveOCKOP (@DaveOCKOP) May 26, 2025\n05:03 PM BST\nThe thoughts of Caoimhin Kelleher\n“We are trying to take it all in. It is amazing with all the fans coming out. There are so many people already it is mental. It is a dream to be on the bus to be honest. Everyone on the team is really close with each other. You see we are a close unit and the best thing is we can enjoy this together and that is how it should be.\n“It has been a long season and we have put a lot of effort in. If you get the reward you have to celebrate it well. It is nice to be able to do that. We are not finished yet.”\n04:59 PM BST\nHarvey Elliott speaking on the bus\n“I feel amazing. It has been incredible. The fans have come out in their numbers and the support has been unbelievable. We always try and take the time to interact with the fans, especially the younger ones. It will last with them for a lifetime. It is not about us today, it is about the whole city and the whole club. You cannot really describe how it feels. In the moment you have to see it to feel how you feel.\n“We have worked so hard for this this season, everyone including the fans, the people at the training ground, the people who work at Anfield. It is all of us together, not just the players. We are all as one and times likes this when everyone gets involved, these memories last you a lifetime.\n04:54 PM BST\nMeanwhile at the Liver Building\n— The Redmen TV (@TheRedmenTV) May 26, 2025\n04:48 PM BST\nDarwin Nunez posing for a photo\nThe Uruguayan has been linked with a move away this summer, potentially to Saudi Arabia, so this could well be his final outing as a Liverpool player.\n04:42 PM BST\nRed everywhere\n04:38 PM BST\nLuis Diaz enjoying himself\nThe Colombian scored 13 goals and assisted seven in the Premier League this season, playing an important role in Liverpool’s title success.\n04:33 PM BST\nFans continue to line the streets\n04:30 PM BST\nThe scenes towards the conclusion of the parade\n📍The Strand pic.twitter.com/4AALD2CDXV\n— The Anfield Wrap (@TheAnfieldWrap) May 26, 2025\n04:24 PM BST\nSelfie time with the manager\nIt was just over a year ago that Arne Slot was announced as Jurgen Klopp’s successor and 12 months on he is celebrating being a Premier League champion at the end of his debut season.\nOur gaffer 😁🤳 pic.twitter.com/smn4sJApu9\n— Liverpool FC (@LFC) May 26, 2025\n04:16 PM BST\nView from the Liverpool coaching staff on the bus\nLiverpool assistant coach John Heitinga:\n“This is amazing.

You have to fight for each other and the players fight for each other.”\nLiverpool assistant coach Sipke Hulshoff:\n“We already saw it in the stadium when we beat Tottenham to seal the title. The nicest thing about winning the big prizes is seeing the smiles on the faces of the fans. Our job is to make the people happy, to make them go home happy. If you have good football and get good results you get this, what you see now.

We obviously had high hopes for this season but he has been an extraordinary coach,” said Werner. “I think there have been three coaches who have won the Premier League in their first season and Arne is one of them. He is just an extraordinary leader. Great compliment to Arne, he’s authentic, he’s not trying to be anyone else. The team was an extraordinarily good team but he brought the best out of them.”\nWerner has also vowed further investment to build on title number 20.\n“We go again. It never gets old, winning.

We know that people want to enjoy the party atmosphere in the city but it is important that we think of everyone’s safety and wellbeing.\n“The parade will have its own professionally organised special effects, including confetti canons and fireworks, which will be adding to the fantastic atmosphere in a safe and controlled manner and my urge would be to people to leave it to the professionals.”\n02:09 PM BST\nParade about to get started\n02:07 PM BST\nNo-one wants to miss out\nLiverpool City Council estimated at least 500,000 on the streets.

Merseyside Police cited concerns around pyro-related injuries as the force warned against further “reckless actions” during the club’s victory parade on Monday.\nIn a warning that supporters using flares or drones face potential arrest, the force said “there were reports of 17 people, including one police officer, being injured as a result of flares ahead of the final LFC game at Anfield”. Hundreds of thousands of supporters are expected to line the city’s streets when the parade takes place However, club bosses had already warned last week that celebrations when the Reds clinched their 20th league title last month resulted in 50 reports of burns suffered by those outside Anfield Stadium – including an injury to a three-year-old child.\nLiverpool have joined forces with police, Liverpool City Council and Alder Hey Children’s Hospital – where several youngsters were treated last month for burns to their hands, face and scalp from flares – to ask fans to protect children from pyrotechnics and celebrate safely. Merseyside Police then delivered a further warning on Monday. “A quantity of pyros were seized from Arkles Lane and a summons has been issued for the owner,” the force said. “We also seized four drones that were being flown over Anfield in breach of a temporary air restriction in place over the ground.”\n01:31 PM BST\nGetting their hands on the trophy yesterday\n01:24 PM BST\nTime to celebrate\nThis is the moment Liverpool fans have been waiting for. Having missed out on the opportunity to celebrate winning the Premier League in 2020 due to Covid restrictions during the pandemic, the fans now have their chance to properly celebrate winning their 20th league title through the streets of Liverpool. In reality, the fans have been celebrating for a month already having wrapped up the title courtesy of a thumping 5-1 of Tottenham at Anfield at the end of April with four games to spare.\nAfter yesterday’s 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace on the final day of the season, captain Virgil van Dijk was handed the Premier League trophy by Liverpool great and former captain Alan Hansen, who was the last Liverpool captain to lift the league title in front of fans at Anfield, and lifted it aloft in front of a packed-out Anfield. When Liverpool won the league in 2020, then-captain Jordan Henderson lifted the trophy at a nearly-empty Anfield, with only family, close friends and media permitted to attend during the pandemic. It is just over a year ago that Liverpool said goodbye to Jurgen Klopp after nearly nine years under the German. 12 months later Liverpool are celebrating winning the Premier League in Arne Slot’s debut season.\nThe route is 10 miles in length, which could take between three and five hours as the parade will wind around the streets of Liverpool. The parade will begin at Allerton Maze and travel north on Queens Drive before heading along Mill Bank, West Derby Road, Islington, Leeds Street and The Strand before finishing on Blundell Street. In recent years Liverpool have had trophy parades along the same rout to celebrate winning the Champions League and the domestic cup double. In 2019, nearly a million people descended on the city centre after Liverpool beat Tottenham 2-0 in Madrid in the Champions League final, which was the first trophy won under Slot’s predecessor Klopp. Three years later in 2022, Liverpool paraded the League Cup and FA Cup, with a similar number of Liverpool fans congregating to have a party.\nDJ Calvin Harris was on board the Liverpool bus back on 2022 so might we see him again this afternoon providing the tunes. The parade is set to begin at 2.30pm.",
