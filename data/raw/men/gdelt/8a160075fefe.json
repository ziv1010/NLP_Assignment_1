The likes of Neymar, Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo and Gabriel Martinelli all were recruited from Brazil and have become key players for their teams.\nIn January, we saw big moves for players such as Vitor Roque (Barcelona), Lucas Beraldo and Gabriel Moscardo (PSG), and leave the South American country.\nThere are often moves agreed in advance so that when the player turns 18 they’ll move to their new club – see, for example, Endrick’s move to Real Madrid.\nSo who are the next stars currently playing in Brazil destined to move to one of Europe’s top leagues?\n1. Andre (Fluminense) – Defensive-Midfielder, 22\nAndre was one of the most discussed Brazilian talents towards the end of 2023 as he was a key figure in Fluminense’s Copa Libertadores win.\nHe also got his first few caps for Brazil under caretaker Brazil manager (and Fluminense boss) Fernando Diniz.\nDespite playing in losses to Argentina and Colombia, he was the most impressive player for Brazil in these games.\nAndre played with such composure on the ball, defended huge spaces to prevent counter attacks and nullified the opponent’s attacks.\nThe defensive midfielder plays in a fluid system at Fluminense under Diniz (also known as Dinizsmo’s relationism style).\nIt’s this system where he’s constantly at the heartbeat of all build-up play. Interchanging positions, playing short passes and driving up the pitch to progress play. He’s a combative midfielder with good technical ability.\nAndre had been linked with so many European teams in January with Liverpool, Arsenal, Fulham, Manchester United, Barcelona just some of those mentioned.\nDue to so many clubs struggling with FFP, however, not many clubs were active in the January transfer window and he ultimately stayed at Fluminense.\nHe’s clearly good enough to move to a top five league, though, and looks set to join a top European club in the summer.\n2. Estevao (Palmeiras) – Right-Winger, 16\nEstevao is one of the best young talents in the world and has been described as ‘the next Neymar’.\nThe whole world would stay up to watch a young Neymar Jr. shining at Santos when he broke through as a teenager, so Estevao’s comparison to him is high praise indeed.\nEstevao, like Neymar, is an entertainer, with the ability to embarrass defenders all over Brazil and South America.\nThe 16-year-old has generated so much hype already even though he’s not played at senior level much, but this season he will do and there will be a war over who will sign him.\nAll the biggest teams have been linked with Estevao: Barcelona, Real Madrid, PSG, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund – you name it.\nRightly so, too.\nEstevao has that superstar factor: a silky skilful dribbler who loves to take on players; a right winger with a deadly left foot that will cut inside to shoot from distance to great effect.\nFor such a slight build, he has a seriously powerful shot from outside the box.\nHe’s the type of player you can imagine winning a top team the big games: Champions League finals, league title deciders…\n3. Luis Guilherme (Palmeiras) – Attacking-Midfielder, 18\nLuis Guilherme is another one of Palmeiras’ elite talents coming through.\nHe plays mainly behind the striker or off the right wing. Guilherme is a high-IQ player with so much composure on the ball. He’s technically excellent too and loves to float around the pockets.\nGuilherme’s profile makes him an interesting prospect for the future as he’s shown great dribbling, finishing and intelligence further up the pitch and also physicality in duels.\nThis could see him develop as a CM more than a RW/ST, but Guilherme is particularly eye-catching as a second striker when making runs of a centre-forward, creating chances for the attackers ahead of him.\nGuilherme’s next destination remains to be seen, but he’d suit a team who plays a possession based, fluid system – the type of system who love versatile players who can do it all.\nIt’s there where we’ll see Luis Guilherme develop the many aspects of his game and become a more all-round player.\n4. Pablo Maia (São Paulo) – Defensive-Midfielder, 22\nPablo Maia was one of the more consistent defensive midfielders in Brazil last season.\nHe’s the type to cover lots of ground and be everywhere on the pitch.\nFront-footed defending and aggression in duels and tackles make him a really good ball-winner for the midfield. He also has a good passing range and can strike the ball well when shooting from distance.\nMaia was of interest to a lot of Premier League teams in January including Arsenal, Brighton, West Ham United and Fulham.\nHe won’t be at Sao Paulo much longer if his top performances continue.\nREAD MORE: What experts are saying about Man Utd target Dan Ashworth – ‘He was a game-changer’\n5. John Kennedy (Fluminense) – Striker, 21\nJohn Kennedy was one of the stars of Fluminense’s Copa Libertadores-winning team and, in fact, he scored the winning goal in the final last year.\nThe 21-year-old striker has a great mentality and has so much confidence in his own abilities, which is clear when he plays.\nKennedy has a real hunger to take on players, to score goals, to shoot, to press. He hunts down opponents by pressing with real intensity.\nKennedy can play across the front line or behind the striker but is best as a number nine or left-winger.\nIn these positions he loves to run in behind, shoot from distance and link up with team-mates. He’s not the tallest, but has a very strong physical presence with aerial prowess.\nKennedy’s finishing ability is his best trait. He’s an instinctive finisher so he doesn’t need much time to get shots away.\n6. Robert Renan (Internacional, On Loan From Zenit St. Petersburg) – Centre-Back, 20\nRobert Renan is part of a golden generation at Corinthians which brought players such as Nottingham Forest’s Murillo, PSG’s new signing Gabriel Moscardo, Zenit’s Pedrinho, and other talents like Guilherme Biro, Wesley, Breno Bidon.\nRenan, like Pedrinho, ended up at Zenit St. Petersburg who invest in the Brazilian market a lot.\nBut unfortunately, when he went, he had mixed performances and wasn’t a regular for them. He is now on loan back in Brazil and is a key player for Internacional.\nRenan’s style as a ball-playing midfielder is one which didn’t suit Zenit but will suit many other possession-based teams in Europe.\nOn the ball he’s so agile that you almost forget how tall he is. It seems certain that will be on the move to a top team after a strong season on loan.\n7. Bento (Athletico Paranaense) – Goalkeeper, 24\nBento is a ready-made keeper for a top European club but is yet to move to one.\nHe is an all-rounder keeper, standing at 6ft3 with good box presence.\nHe’s effective on penalties, has quality reactions to make good reflex saves and also has quick speed to get up quickly and make double and triple saves.\nIn addition to all this, Bento has good ball distribution able to pick out players accurately with long passes. He brings leadership from in goal.\nBento even got in the Brazil squad a few times as the back-up to Alisson and Ederson.\nHe and Lucas Perri will be the two keepers battling it out for Brazil’s number one spot in the future.\n8. Matheus Nascimento (Botafogo) – Striker, 19\nMatheus Nascimento is one player we’re surprised hasn’t moved yet because he has shown so much promise, but wasn’t given lots of game time last season.\nMany clubs have been linked with the striker, the most concrete interest coming from Nottingham Forest.\nNascimento is an intelligent, skilful striker with an excellent awareness of space around him.\nHe loves to drop deep and flick the ball onto advanced runners. As a striker he can be the facilitator or the goal-scorer.\nNascimento is unselfish, runs the channels, presses from the front, links other players.\nHis long legs give him a good top speed to be a threat running in behind or on counter attacks into space and he has a calmness in front of goal.\nHe could be developed into a serious striker.\n9. Rayan Vitor (Vasco da Gama) – Striker, 17\nVasco da Gama’s attacking star Rayan Vitor is ready to explode on the senior stage and he’s already started well. He’s a versatile attacker capable of playing across the front three.\nAt youth level he often played on the right and would cut inside on his deadly left foot, but his best position is as a striker.\nA forward packed with power and skill, Rayan loves to take on players.\nHis back to goal play is good but needs work, but that’s what he’ll develop over the next few years of playing centrally more often.\nRayan’s best trait though is his finishing. He strikes the ball with so much power and gets shots off quickly and frequently.\nHe shows so much composure in front of goal and doesn’t hesitate to get shots off.\nAs an instinctive finisher, he always is aware of the space around him and where the goal is.\nHe’s deadly in the box. Simply give him the ball and he’ll find a way to shoot.\n10. Victor Hugo (Flamengo) – Centre-Midfielder, 19\nAn all-action midfielder, Victor Hugo loves to carry the ball on attacking transitions.\nHe’s able to play in a variety of attacking positions but also standing at 6ft also offers good duel and ball winning capabilities.\nVictor Hugo’s strengths definitely lie more in the attacking side of the game where he’ll take players on, weave in and out of challenges, play final passes and arrive in the box to finish cutbacks.\nAs an eight, he has the profile to be effective in all phases of play.\nEURO PAPER TALK: Arsenal to rescue classy Bayern star in huge summer deal with Tuchel relationship ‘broken’; Man City want electric PSG ace",
