A lot of kids have incredible feet, they can shoot, they can pass – the technical aspects of the game. But the mental side, having that understanding of space, can be crucial. Cole would make very intelligent runs all the time. I was excited to be working with him.”\nPalmer was regularly training with Pep Guardiola’s first team by the age of 19, with his debut coming in a Carabao Cup triumph at Burnley, before a late cameo away at Marseille in the Champions League.\nPalmer remained grounded. “He was happy to play in any position you asked him to, with no complaints whatsoever,” recalls Barry-Murphy. “If you put him somewhere new, he wanted to master it. We had so many brilliant players in the academy, but Cole had moments of skill that could blow you away. He could turn a game on its head with a goal from anywhere. I was constantly in touch with Pep about his performances.”\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nCome the end of the 2021-22 season, Palmer had made 11 appearances in Pep Guardiola’s first-team, scoring three goals and nabbing an assist along the way. “Cole really looked ready to kick on and play an even bigger role for Pep in the first team the following season,” Barry-Murphy adds. “We were all feeling very excited for him.”\nBut with the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, Jack Grealish, Riyad Mahrez, Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden all battling for minutes in Guardiola’s first-team, Palmer found regular and consistent minutes hard to come by.\n“Mahrez was probably the main one because, like Cole, he was a left-footed winger who liked to cut in and create,” Barry-Murphy says. “The problem was, Riyad was one of the most dangerous and reliable players in the world.”\nAfter playing a key role in England’s European Under-21 Championship victory in 2023 and scoring in the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal, Palmer would inform Guardiola that he wanted to leave.\n“There comes a period where young players either get enough game time to satisfy their journey or don’t,” says Barry-Murphy. “It’s always sad to see a player of that talent go elsewhere but, at a big club like Manchester City, you move on.”\nFor more than a decade, Joe Mewis has worked in football journalism as a reporter and editor.
