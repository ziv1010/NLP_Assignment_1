  "body_text": "The truth is out there – The nine Newcastle United defeats and who NUFC have lost to\nNewcastle United have played 35 matches so far this season.\nEddie Howe and his players have a minimum of 13 more games to play, hopefully 16 (see remaining matches/schedule below).\nIf indeed Newcastle United are to end up playing 51 matches this season, that would mean there will have been three trips to Wembley in the space of nine weeks.\nThat would involve the League Cup final on Sunday 16 March, a potential FA Cup semi-final on the weekend of Saturday 26 April, then potentially, the FA Cup final on Saturday 17 May.\nLet’s not get ahead of ourselves just yet though.\nI wanted to concentrate on the 35 matches Newcastle United have played.\nThese have brought twenty one victories, five draws, nine defeats.\nI wanted to especially concentrate on those defeats.\nNow, I am never happy when Newcastle United lose any match, against any opposition.\nThe same as all football fans.\nHowever, I think this season has become really bizarre.\nThe number of pundits, journalists and especially Newcastle United fans, who want to portray these past six and a half months as being peppered with so many terrible defeats to opposition sides, where we should supposedly never have been under any threat at all of losing to.\nI find this really strange and it feels like a collective madness has broken out.\nWhere the truth of what has really happened, is totally ignored.\nThose nine Newcastle United defeats have been against Liverpool, Man City, Chelsea, Bournemouth, Brighton, Fulham(x2), Brentford and West Ham.\nHave a look at the current Premier League table with three quarters of the season now gone:\nThe nine Newcastle United defeats have come against the clubs currently positioned 1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th(x2), 11th and 16th.\nSeven of the nine defeats coming against the clubs who are currently in the Champions League positions (top five), or at worst up to four points off the CL qualifying positions.\nFor some really bizarre reason, which I can’t begin to understand, you have Newcastle United fans who think it is some kind of a disgrace to lose to teams ‘like’ Bournemouth, Fulham and so on. Totally ignoring the reality that these teams have proved themselves to be very good across the opening three quarters of the season.\nFor these people, they seem to be incapable of seeing things as they are in reality. I assume that in their heads it would have been more acceptable to have lost to say Spurs and/or Man U this season because they are ‘big’ clubs, even though the table above proves they are closer to the relegation positions than the Champions League qualifying ones this season.\nThe idea that Newcastle United have had a load of disgraceful defeats this season to opposition they should never ever possibly have lost to, is just plain daft. It is indeed, quite the opposite.\nThe only defeats outside those against top nine clubs, have been at Brentford, who at the time had easily the best home record of any Premier League team. Then that one against West Ham, who scored with pretty much their only attack of the first half and one of those matches where Newcastle just couldn’t get a goal. The Hammers won away at Arsenal in their most recent away game and kept a clean sheet, they aren’t having a great season but they do have some great players such as Bowen and Paqueta, amongst others, who on their day, are capable of still pulling off some very good one-off wins.\nAs I said earlier, it is gutting when Newcastle United lose any match, but the way some fans go on, it is as though the likes of Fulham, Bournemouth and others are total non-league no hopers who don’t even deserve to be on the same pitch as NUFC, when it couldn’t be further from the truth.\nWorth pointing out as well that of the 11 remaining Newcastle United Premier League fixtures, only three of those PL games are against clubs currently in the top nine, with the other eight against those outside the top nine.\nWhilst after the next Premier League match at West Ham, six of the remaining ten PL games are at St James’ Park.\nAll remaining Newcastle United fixtures and the dates of the remaining FA Cup rounds, if needed:\nNewcastle United upcoming matches:\nSunday 2 March – Newcastle v Brighton (1.45pm) – FA Cup fifth round ITV1\nMonday 10 March – West Ham v Newcastle (8pm) Sky Sports\nSunday 16 March – Newcastle v Liverpool (4.30pm) Carabao Cup final!
