The Bees had hoped to appoint Justin Cochrane, a member of Frank’s coaching staff, but he had also moved to Tottenham.\nThey could still hire from within with set-piece coach Keith Andrews the new favourite for the job, while Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna and even Postecoglou are among the frontrunners.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Bryan Mbeumo makes decision over Manchester United transfer after £70m Spurs bid\nMORE: Tottenham begin talks to hijack transfer of £60m Man Utd target\nMORE: Man Utd beat Arsenal, Spurs and Chelsea to sign highly-rated Southampton prospect",
