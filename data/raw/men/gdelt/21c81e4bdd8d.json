We've got you covered. Aston Villa vs Everton is on Sky Sports in the UK. Brit abroad? Use a VPN to watch the Premier League with your subscription from anywhere.\nBoth Aston Villa and Everton are looking for their first points of the season following their opening day defeats to Newcastle and Fulham, respectively.\nDespite being tipped for big things this term, Villa started with a 5-1 loss at Newcastle and need to recover quickly. Unai Emery has added a lot of quality to the squad over the summer, but players still seem like they're gelling and getting to grips with the Spaniard's system.\nEverton had multiple chances to score against Fulham last weekend, but failed to capitalise on any of them. A lack of a goalscorer could really haunt them this campaign if they fail to bring a new body in or keep Dominic Calvert-Lewin fit, but Sean Dyche will inevitably keep the side resolute regardless.\nKick-off is at 2pm BST. Make sure you know how to watch the Premier League wherever you are.\nTeam news\nAston Villa's luck on the injury front has gone from bad to worse. Just a week after losing Emi Buendia to a serious knee injury, Tyrone Mings then suffered the same fate in the defeat to Newcastle last weekend. Alex Moreno, Leander Dendoncker, Bertrand Traore and Jacob Ramsey are all ruled out for Villa, too.\nEverton, meanwhile, have Seamus Coleman, Jack Harrison and Dwight McNeil all out, though Sean Dyche is hopeful of their return in September. Dele is also missing for this game.\nAston Villa XI: Martinez; Cash, Konsa, Torres, Digne; Kamara, Douglas Luiz; Bailey, Diaby, McGinn; Watkins.\nEverton XI: Pickford; Patterson, Keane, Tarkowski, Young; Garner, Gueye, Onana, Iwobi; Doucoure; Calvert-Lewin.\nForm\nAston Villa: L\nEverton: L\nReferee\nAnthony Taylor will be the referee for Aston Villa vs Everton. His assistants will be Gary Beswick and Adam Nunn, with Robert Madley the fourth official. Darren England is the VAR, with Timothy Wood the assistant VAR.\nStadium\nAston Villa vs Everton will be played at Villa Park in Aston, Birmingham, which has a capacity of 42,640.\nKick-off and channel\nAston Villa vs Everton kick-off is at 2pm BST on Sunday 20 August in the UK. The game is on Sky Sports Premier League and Sky Sports Main Event in the UK.\nIn the US, kick-off time is 9am ET / 6am PT. The match will be shown on NBC in the US. See below for international broadcast options.\nVPN guide\nUse a VPN to watch Premier League football from outside your country\nIf you’re out of the country for a Premier League fixture, then you won't be able to watch on your domestic streaming service as usual. The broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!) and blocks you from watching it. You can use a VPN to get around that, though, without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and will let you watch. And all the info going between is entirely encrypted, anonymous and safe – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there. For the Premier League, FourFourTwo currently recommends:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS5 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price.
