The glamorous support squad cheering on England ahead of their first Euros match in Germany - from a stewardess to a Love Island star and a 'nepo baby' model\nEngland's Euro 2024 opener against Serbia takes place on Sunday - and as they take to the pitch, the players will be supported by a host of glamorous wives and girlfriends.\nThose cheering from the crowd could include former Love Island star Dani Dyer, whose partner West Ham star Jarrod Bowen's stellar season was rewarded with a call-up to Gareth Southgate's team this summer.\nElsewhere, fans will likely be hoping that Trent Alexander-Arnold's girlfriend Iris Law makes an appearance in Germany. The model's parents are A-listers Jude Law and Sadie Frost.\nIf that wasn't enough glitz and glamour, the WAGs this tournament also include Jude Bellingham's stunning girlfriend Laura Celia Valk, who's a model, TikTok star, and clothing designer, often sharing her glamorous lifestyle with her many followers.\nHere, FEMAIL takes a look at some of the very glamorous partners supporting the Three Lions...\nDANI DYER\nGirlfriend to Jarrod Bowen\nJarrod Bowen with his partner, Dani Dyer.
