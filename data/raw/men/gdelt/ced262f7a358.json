What I want is that the family is good, but it's the fans who decide.\n\"I feel appreciation from the fans but I didn't like the chants against the president.\"\nXavi reiterated his words before the game, saying the club conveyed \"calmness\" to him and that there was no development to report on his future.\nBarcelona are guaranteed to finish ahead of upstart neighbours Girona, who earned a 3-1 win at Valencia.\nArtem Dovbyk's goal leaves him two behind Sorloth in the race for Spain's golden boot.\nEuropa bound\nBrais Mendez sent Real Sociedad ahead early on against Betis with a perfectly-placed free-kick as they secured sixth place.\nManuel Pellegrini's side, shorn of key injured midfielders Isco and Guido Rodriguez, battled hard to level but Mikel Merino doubled the visitors' lead shortly before half-time.\nAlex Remiro saved Ez Abde's penalty to keep Betis at arm's length and Ayoze Perez had a goal disallowed for the hosts, who will play in the Conference League next season.\nAthletic Bilbao stalwarts Raul Garcia and Iker Muniain both struck on their last home game for the fifth-place Copa del Rey winners in a 2-0 victory against an underwhelming Sevilla.\nDiego Simeone's Atletico Madrid, guaranteed to finish fourth, fell 4-1 at home against a rampant Osasuna.\nThere is nothing left to play for in the final week of the season, with Cadiz joining Granada and Almeria in Spain's second division next season, while the European qualifying places are set.\n© 2024 AFP",
