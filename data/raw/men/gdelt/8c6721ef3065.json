But rather than chat about another Wembley victory for the defending FA Cup champions, the Man City boss wanted to make clear his grumblings at the scheduling,\n“It’s unacceptable,” the 53-year-old began. “It’s really unacceptable. Coventry, United and Chelsea don’t play in the week, [but] they let us play today. Next week, on Friday it would be better. Instead of Saturday, put it on Friday to let us have a recovery.”\nWhen asked by Lineker if he felt unfairly treated, Guardiola added: “It’s impossible, for the health of the players! It’s not normal. Honestly, it’s not normal. We didn’t have the courage to tell you, to FIFA we shut up, but it’s not possible. It’s unacceptable – 120 minutes. All of you are football players. The emotion against Madrid, the quarter-final, we lose and everything. So honestly, I know this country, it is special for many things but it is for the health of the players. I don’t understand how we survived today.”\nAsked if he had raised his concerns with the Football Association, the Man City coach replied: “Gary, you think us demanding is going to change something? The only power I have is to say here. It’s not going to change anything. I know it for many years. But why we play today and not tomorrow, with one day off, when Coventry and United and Chelsea don’t play in the mid-week? Why?\n“Why don’t you have one more day for the health of the players? For me, as a manager, tell me how you prepare for this game against Chelsea in their best moment of the season? How? It’s impossible. There is no chance.”\nPep Guardiola was not happy that Manchester City had to play the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday after facing Real Madrid on Wednesday.#BBCFootball #FACup pic.twitter.com/YaAKsLwTfG\n— BBC Sport (@BBCSport) April 20, 2024",
