  "body_text": "Gerhard Aigner, who has died aged 80, was a sports administrator who became the general secretary of Uefa, European football’s governing body; courteous but firm, he oversaw the inception of the Champions League, successor to the European Cup, as well as dealing with the fall-out from the Bosman transfer ruling which left players – and consequently their agents – more powerful than ever before.\nGerhard Aigner was Bavarian, born in Regensburg, Germany, on September 1 1943, and was keen on football from an early age, playing for a local amateur side in his teens as well as coaching and refereeing. After leaving school he did various jobs, including spells in England, Spain, and Switzerland, where he turned out for a non-league side, FC Moutier.\nIn 1969 he was taken on by Uefa, which at that time was based in modest offices in Bern, as head of the refereeing and youth sections, and in 1973 he was put in charge of the competitions section. He became a highly respected figure in the organisation, and in 1988, when Hans Bangerter stepped down, Aigner became Uefa’s fourth general secretary.\nThe most dramatic event in the evolution of modern European football came a few years into his tenure, with the 1995 Bosman Ruling. The Belgian midfielder Jean-Marc Bosman had sued his old club Standard Liège, the Belgian FA, and Uefa, arguing that Uefa’s rules, which prevented him from leaving his club even though his contract had expired, were a breach of his rights established in the 1957 Treaty of Rome.",
