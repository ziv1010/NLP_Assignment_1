I know their ability. It's more so providing that opportunity to be able to play.\n\"Unfortunately, they're playing at a big club where we have some big names in certain positions and then sometimes they don't get the opportunity.\n\"We'll still have some senior players that have played regular football in the squad, so it'll be a balance of some youth and some experienced players.\"\nEmerging talents Jaiden Kucharski and Corey Hollman are a chance to feature in Talay's starting line-up, alongside teenagers Tiago Quintal and Patrick Kennedy.\nOff-season recruit Harrison Devenish-Meares will retain his spot while first-choice goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne recovers from a corked thigh.\nRedmayne suffered a massive knock to his upper thigh after a collision with teammate Joe Lolley during their A-League Men win over Western Sydney.\nDevenish-Meares has played two games for the Sky Blues, joining the club in June for his first A-League stint after starting his career in Romania.\n\"Every match that I play is like a World Cup final,\" Devenish-Meares said.\n\"For me, in a competitive goalkeeping squad, every minute that I get is important.\n\"I said to one of the other goalkeepers at the beginning of the season, every opportunity you get to perform under any circumstances is important.\n\"It's almost just as important to play even when things are stacked up against you.\"\nSydney dominated Kaya in their last ACL2 meeting, erasing an early deficit to secure a 4-2 win in hot conditions at Manila's Rizal Memorial Stadium.\nAustralian Associated Press",
