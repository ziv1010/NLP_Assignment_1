If you get 98 points and lose the title on the final day or lose the Champions League final in extra-time because of a bad refereeing decision you’re not going to get rid of the manager, are you? That would be ridiculous.\n‘So I don’t think he has to win something but he would have to be damn unlucky and be competitive right until the end in both competitions to be forgiven.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nThe most important player in Arsenal’s title charge, according to Murphy, is England midfielder Declan Rice.\nRice has hardly missed a game for the Gunners since his £105m move from West Ham in 2023.\nArsenal signed the likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Martin Zubimendi last summer but Murphy still views Rice as the ‘main man’ at the Emirates Stadium.\n‘They’re not reliant now on one or two players,’ the ex-England star added. ‘They’ve got so much back-up across the pitch.\n‘I still think Declan Rice is a massive player for them. I know they brought in Christian Norgaard from Brentford who is a good player actually, I like him a lot.\n‘But Rice has got that physical athleticism, he’s so good on the press. I’m not saying Arsenal wouldn’t win games without him but I think he’s the one, he’s become their main man.’\nArsenal’s impressive form continued on Tuesday night as Mikel Arteta’s side thumped Atletico Madrid 4-0 in the Champions League.\nRice provided the assist for Gabriel Magalhaes’ headed opener before fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli doubled Arsenal’s lead.\nViktor Gyokeres then ended a run of nine games without a goal with a quickfire brace, firing Arsenal to an emphatic win over La Liga side Atletico.\nFollowing Atletico’s heaviest Champions League defeat, Diego Simeone hailed Arsenal as the ‘best team’ his side have faced so far this season.\nMore Trending\nAtletico lost to Premier League champions Liverpool earlier in the campaign and beat Real Madrid in the league but Simeone believes Arsenal are playing at a higher level than both of those clubs.\nAsked whether Arsenal were the best team Atletico Madrid have played this season, Simeone told Amazon Prime through a translator: ‘Yes, I would say the best team we have faced this season.\n‘They compete so well, their players run and run and they have quality all over the pitch. They deserved to win today and I want to congratulate them.’\nArsenal’s next opponents, FA Cup holders Crystal Palace, are currently eighth in the Premier League, two points outside the top-four.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: David James claims £25m star can fire Chelsea to Premier League title\nMORE: Paul Merson tells Ruben Amorim to drop Man Utd star for Brighton clash\nMORE: Man Utd eye ‘ambitious’ move for Chelsea star valued over £60m in January window",
