Athletic are seventh, 11 points behind their rivals.\n\"La Real have had a very good year and are towards the top of the table, but in a home derby you have to give everything you've got,\" said Athletic defender Yeray Alvarez.\n\"We're going to have 'La Catedral' behind us and that is practically like playing with an extra player.\"\nReal Sociedad coach -- and former player -- Alguacil boasts a strong derby record, with six wins, two draws and two defeats since taking over in 2018.\nThe highlight of his time thus far is the Copa del Rey final victory over Athletic in 2021, after which he celebrated in his post-game news conference by donning a shirt and screaming a club chant.\nReal Sociedad captain Asier Illarramendi, 33, may play in his final Basque derby, with his deal expiring at the end of the season.\n\"I don't know if it will be the last, but it could be, yes, it could be,\" he said.\n\"It's true I'm out of contract but right now I'm not thinking about that, I'm focused on the team's objective, which is qualifying for Europe, staying in fourth place, and this is an important game to keep that position.\"\nAthletic romped to an emphatic 4-0 victory over Real Sociedad last season at home in La Liga, but Illarramendi said the game was history now.\n\"That's more than forgotten, all derbies are different and this one will be too,\" said the former Real Madrid midfielder.\nVillarreal, who have gone six games unbeaten in the top flight, including earning a 2-0 win over Real Sociedad, host Real Valladolid on Saturday.\nLeaders Barcelona visit Getafe on Sunday, while Real Madrid, second, face Cadiz on Saturday.\nPlayer to watch: Taty Castellanos\nGirona striker Taty Castellanos, on loan from New York City, was left in tears in the dressing room at Camp Nou after missing a big chance on Monday against the Catalans in the 0-0 derby draw. His coach Michel backed him to bounce back and the visit of bottom-of-the-table Elche provides a fine chance to add to his tally of six goals.\nKey stats\n0.83 - Although Karim Benzema is not La Liga's top goalscorer, he has the best goals per 90 minute record this season in the top flight\n4 - Atletico defender Mario Hermoso has netted four times, having scored the same number in total across his previous three La Liga campaigns\n10 - Alex Baena, in the spotlight after being allegedly punched by Madrid's Fede Valverde, has the most bookings this season, along with four other players\nFixtures (GMT)\nFriday\nRayo Vallecano v Osasuna (1900)\nSaturday\nVillarreal v Real Valladolid (1200), Athletic Bilbao v Real Sociedad (1415), Real Betis v Espanyol (1630), Cadiz v Real Madrid (1900)\nSunday\nGirona v Elche (1200), Getafe v Barcelona (1415), Atletico Madrid v Almeria (1630), Valencia v Sevilla (1900)\nMonday\nCelta Vigo v Real Mallorca (1900)\n© 2023 AFP",
