It was just because of that but now he is back in the squad. He is training well.\n‘Probably in this moment, if he is in the squad, one offensive player has to be out for the Fulham game and that probably would have been Tyrique.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Real Madrid respond to Copa del Rey final boycott claim over referee comments\nMORE: Andoni Iraola reveals how Dean Huijsen has reacted to Chelsea transfer rumours\nMORE: Tranmere Rovers midfielder Sam Finley given 13-game ban for homophobic comment to opponent",
