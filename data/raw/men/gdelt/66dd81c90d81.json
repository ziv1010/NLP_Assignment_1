  "body_text": "Lloyds warns Arsenal fans over Champions League ticket scams\nArsenal fans have been warned to watch out for ticket scams surrounding the Champions League final.\nThe Gunners toppled Galacticos Real Madrid over two legs to set up a semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain.\nBut should they beat the Ligue 1 champions, a final in Munich awaits against either Barcelona or Inter Milan.\nIt has prompted major bank Lloyds to issue a warning to fans over potential scams relating to tickets to the final.\nOn the rise\nLiz Ziegler, fraud prevention director at Lloyds, says: “Recent trends show a sharp rise in online ticket scams, with social media platforms such as Facebook Marketplace and Instagram being popular places for fraudsters to lure victims with offers of fake tickets.\n“Our research from 2024 shows that football ticket scams increased by around a third last season, with victims losing £177 on average. However, in some cases, this can be in the thousands.”\nThe bank has issued a list in which fans can use to stay vigilant when getting Champions League tickets, which included calls to resist and avoid pressure tactics, verify sellers, choose secure payment methods and think twice when the deal appears to be too good to be true.\nZiegler adds: “These scams often involve posting pictures of authentic-looking tickets to convince buyers they’re genuine. Once the buyer pays, typically via an insecure payment method like a bank transfer, the scammer disappears, leaving fans disappointed, without tickets and their hard-earned money.”\nChampions League tickets\nOften, as seen at the recent European Championships, tickets can be invalidated if they are illegally sold on by so-called fans and touts.\nIt can lead to fans forking out hundreds of pounds for a ticket that would never be accepted at a stadium turnstile.\nArsenal take on PSG at the Emirates on Tuesday 29 April before the return leg in the French capital on 7 May.\nThe final, should they get there, will take place at Munich Football Arena on 31 May.",
