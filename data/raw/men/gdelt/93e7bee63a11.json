Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nVictory for the Gunners is 10/11 with Coral who have chalked up the same price for Tottenham to continue their hot start by beating visiting Villarreal. Spurs made light work of West Ham in a 3-0 victory at the London Stadium on Saturday with key players Rodrigo Bentancur, Randal Kolo Muani, Richarlison and Brennan Johnson on their bench, which looks significantly stronger to last season after an impressive spending spree during the recent transfer window.\nNew manager Thomas Frank has hit the ground running by also taking nine points from 12 and attacking midfielder Xavi Simons is 15/2 to open the scoring and 29/10 with BetMGM to add his name to the scoreboard at any time.\nChampions League winners odds\nParis Saint-Germain looked as though they were embarking on the start of a dynasty when they thrashed Inter Milan 5-0 in last year’s Champions League final after beating Manchester City in the group stages and eliminating Aston Villa, Liverpool and Arsenal in the knockout rounds.\nThey then swept all before them to reach the final of the Club World Cup but were ripped apart by Chelsea in the New Jersey decider and were then taken to the brink of defeat by Tottenham Hostpur in the Super Cup before winning on penalties.\nA tough group schedule this time around and a series of injuries to key players at the start of the season raises further questions about their ability to win successive titles for the first time since Real Madrid in 2017 and 2018, but they started slowly last year and could follow the same path to ultimate glory at the Ferenc Puskas Stadium in Budapest in May at 13/2 with bet365.\nAs for the six English clubs involved, Liverpool are joint favourites with Barcelona at 6/1 with multiple firms, Arsenal are 15/2 with Betfred while Manchester City are 12/1 with Betway. Chelsea are priced at 14/1 with Sporting Index and SpreadEx, Tottenham are 40/1 with BetMGM and Newcastle are the same odds with BoyleSports and Unibet.\nMore Trending\nPunters looking for a club at a decent price could do worse than back Bayern Munich each-way at 12/1 with bet365 and BoyleSports as they look full of goals following the addition of Luis Diaz and Nicolas Jackson to an attack which already boasts Harry Kane, Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise among others in its ranks.\nKane has already scored nine goals in six games this season and is definitely worth an each-way bet at 10/1 with William Hill, bet365, Paddy Power and Betway among others to win the tournament’s Golden Boot.\nCarabao Cup odds\nBrentford have already beaten Aston Villa 1-0 in the Premier League and can complete a double over Unai Emery’s side by knocking them out of the Carabao Cup in west London.\nThe Bees are 19/20 with bet365 to qualify for the fourth round and can also be put in a treble with Nottingham Forest, who should give Ange Postecoglou his first win at Swansea, and Grimsby, who memorably beat Manchester United on penalties in the last round and will be too good for troubled Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough.\nMORE: Gary Lineker ‘really worried’ about Ruben Amorim’s treatment of Manchester United star\nMORE: Martin Keown thinks £71m star may already be questioning Man Utd transfer",
