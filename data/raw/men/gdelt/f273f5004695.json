Thiago Motta's first test on global stage\nJuventus ushered in the era of manager Thiago Motta this summer, having been dazzled by his exploits with Bologna.\nHe may have overachieved with Bologna, but expectations in Turin are different, and Tuesday's clash with a PSV Eindhoven side who have scored 20 goals in their first five games of the campaign will prove to be a major test for Motta and Juventus.\nJuve come into the game on a run of two straight draws but fans will demand a return to winning ways.\n2. Viktor Gyokeres vs Jonathan David\nIf your team is looking to sign a new striker, chances are you're very familiar with the names Viktor Gyokeres and Jonathan David.\nThe pair will butt heads when Sporting CP host Lille, battling to prove who should be the top transfer target for Europe's elite sides.\nGyokeres already has eight goals to his name this season, while David, who is in the final 12 months of his Lille contract, netted twice in qualification as his side saw off Fenerbahce and Slavia Prague.\n3. Erling Haaland eyes Cristiano Ronaldo's record\nErling Haaland has 99 goals to his name for Manchester City and will hope to make it 100 when Inter travel to the Etihad on Wednesday.\nIf Haaland scores in this one, he'll break Cristiano Ronaldo's record for the fewest games needed to reach a century for one club. The former Real Madrid star did it in 105 games for the Spanish side, and Haaland is currently on 103 appearances.\nThis next outing will be his final chance to claim the record for his own, and you just know he'll come out like a man possessed.\n4. Bayern Munich's quest to bounce back\nAfter a bitterly disappointing 2023/24 campaign, Bayern Munich have reshuffled. Vincent Kompany is in the dugout, Michael Olise is strutting his stuff on the wing and Matthijs de Ligt has been shipped off to Manchester United.\nThree wins from three to start the season has helped build some momentum, but European eyes will be watching to see how they fare on the international stage.\nBayern are up against a tricky Dinamo Zagreb side which features 21-year-old midfielder Martin Baturina, a reported target for both Man Utd and Real Madrid.\n5. Kylian Mbappe's first taste of the Champions League juggernaut\nReal Madrid haven't been very good this season, despite what 11 points from five games might suggest. Kylian Mbappe's start to life in Spain has hardly gone to plan.\nAs we all know, however, Madrid are a different animal in the Champions League, and they may have to be to avoid an upset at home to Bundesliga overachievers Stuttgart.\nThe German side are still finding their feet after losing most of their top talents in the summer, but Sebastian Hoeness is a fantastic young manager who will fancy his chances of exploiting the holes in Madrid's shaky team.\n6. Pep Lijnders flees the nest\nFor years, Pep Lijnders was synonymous with Jurgen Klopp, but the former Liverpool assistant has now spread his wings and is back for another crack at management with Red Bull Salzburg.\nThe Austrian side are always a popular outfit among neutrals, many of whom are watching to see whether their favourite Football Manager wonderkids can justify the hype in real life.\nAll eyes will be on Oscar Gloukh, Amar Dedic, Mads Bidstrup, Lucas Gourna-Douath and Bobby Clark, as well as Liverpool loanee Stefan Bajcetic.\n7. PSG prepare to send a message\nMany feared for Paris Saint-Germain following Mbappe's summer exit, but the French side wasted little time switching up their image and coming back with a bang.\nTheir young side has been cooking under Luis Enrique, winning four from four thanks to the dazzling showings of Bradley Barcola and Joao Neves, and they will be keen to prove they can compete for this trophy even without Mbappe in the ranks.\nGirona will head to Paris on Wednesday looking to bounce back from a crushing 4-1 defeat to Barcelona.\n8. Conor Gallagher's Atletico love-in\nDiego Simeone fought and fought and fought for Conor Gallagher to join Atletico Madrid from Chelsea this summer, and the midfielder has quickly lived up to the hype.\nGreeted by a hero's welcome, the 24-year-old has already won over supporters of his new club and even scored his first goal for Atleti in the weekend's 3-0 win over Valencia.\nGallagher will lead his new side out on Thursday for a potentially tricky clash with RB Leipzig.\n9. Barcelona face a major test of their credentials\nBarcelona are arguably the in-form team in Europe. They've been absolutely flying under Hansi Flick and have quickly forced their way back into the list of pre-tournament favourites to go all the way this season.\nTheir first test under the Champions League lights comes away to Monaco, who are unbeaten in Ligue 1 and boast a mean defence that has conceded just once in four games this season - and that was a penalty.\nWith Dani Olmo missing through injury, Lamine Yamal will need to stand up and produce one of his top performances to guide Barca through this one.\n10. Do Arsenal have the squad depth?\nArsenal will welcome Declan Rice back into the team after he served his domestic suspension, but the Gunners remain without the injured Martin Odegaard and Mikel Merino. There are even fears Bukayo Saka could be set for a spell on the sidelines.\nAn away trip to last season's Europa League winners Atalanta on Thursday will prove a massive test to a strained squad, not least because Mikel Arteta also needs to have one eye on Sunday's clash of the titans against Manchester City.\nArteta will need all his tactical acumen to navigate this tricky period and keep his biggest names healthy for what could easily be a season-defining four days.",
