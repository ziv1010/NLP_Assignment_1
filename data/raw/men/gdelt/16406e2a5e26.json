Juventus reach verbal agreement with Kenan Yildiz and his camp over new long term deal.\nNew contract will be valid for the next four years as Yildiz has agreed to put pen to paper with salary increased.\nHe’s gonna be among the best paid players in the squad. ?? pic.twitter.com/FCS7RnlZRF\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) February 7, 2026\nRomano posted: “Juventus reach verbal agreement with Kenan Yildiz and his camp over new long term deal. New contract will be valid for the next four years as Yildiz has agreed to put pen to paper with salary increased. He’s gonna be among the best paid players in the squad.”\nKenan Yildiz staying at Juventus but transfer interest will surely remain\nJuventus fans will surely be delighted that Yildiz has committed his future to the Turin outfit for the time being, but one imagines it won’t entirely kill off the transfer speculation.\nClubs like Arsenal and Chelsea have the financial power that can be persuasive at the highest level, so that could mean they’re able to offer big money to both Juventus and to Yildiz at some point in the future.\nUltimately, the Premier League is widely regarded as the most competitive and prestigious league in the world these days, so it’s hard to imagine a quality player like Yildiz doesn’t have ambitions to play in England at some stage.\nJuventus are fourth in Serie A at the moment, but one imagines if they fail to qualify for the Champions League then they could be at risk of losing star names like Yildiz.\nThe 20-year-old’s new deal is a four-year one, according to Romano, so that could open the door to a big move just as he’s approaching his peak years.",
