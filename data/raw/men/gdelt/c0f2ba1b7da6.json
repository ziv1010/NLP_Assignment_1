  "body_text": "Having prevailed 3-1 when the teams last met in May, Chelsea are seeking back-to-back Premier League victories over Liverpool for the first time since 2014.\nThe Reds have won four of their last ten league visits to Stamford Bridge, as many as the managed across their previous 25 outings in West London beforehand.\nChelsea vs Liverpool preview\nAfter the week from hell, bringing to an end their perfect start to the campaign, can Liverpool respond with a statement victory on Saturday evening? Last weekend, the Reds were beaten by in-form Crystal Palace, battered throughout the first half, lucky to only be one goal behind. Thus, when Federico Chiesa equalised three minutes from time, most expected the champions to score a trademark late winner, but it was Palace who deservedly pinched the points right at the death.\nThen, on Tuesday night, at the cauldron that is the Ali Sami Yen, Arne Slot's side slipped up again, this time beaten 1-0 by Galatasaray in the Champions League. The only goal of the night came from the penalty spot, Dominik Szoboszlai adjudged to have fouled Barış Alper Yılmaz early on, and the visitors were unable to find an equaliser in İstanbul thereafter.\nThus, while many are claiming this is a crisis, some perspective is required. The jeopardy at this early stage of the Champions League is extremely minimal while, in Premier League terms, the Reds had won five out of five before their trip to Selhurst while, excluding matches after the title was secured, they've lost just three of 40 league games since Slot's arrival. However, performances this season have been undeniably incohesive and underwhelming so, with this key clash coming before an international break, the result could drastically swing the mood from one director or another.\nSo, can Chelsea take advantage of their visitor's shortcomings? Well, based on recent performances, probably not. In mid-week, the Blues battled to a 1-0 Champions League victory against Benfica, a Richard Ríos own goal the difference, on a night that rather turned into the José Mourinho show; who could have seen that coming? In the opposite dugout, that was a key victory for Enzo Maresca.\nThis is because, before this, the only team the Blues had managed to beat in September was Lincoln City, currently without a win in three Premier League games. After conceding a stoppage time equaliser at Brentford, thereby forced to settle for a point, they've lost against both Manchester United and Brighton, rather imploding after being reduced to ten men on both occasions, conceding twice in stoppage time last weekend in a 3-1 defeat. João Pedro's late red card on Tuesday means Chelsea have seen a man sent off in each of their last three Premier League or Champions League fixtures, a concerning trend. Here though, can the Blues kick-start their campaign with a statement win, thereby sounding the alarm bells just that little bit louder on Merseyside?\nChelsea vs Liverpool head-to-head record\n- Matches Played: 199.\n- Chelsea Wins: 66. Draws: 46. Liverpool Wins: 87.\nChelsea team news\nEnzo Maresca is very short of defensive options. Trevoh Chalobah's red card against Brighton means he is suspended, while Levi Colwill, Tosin Adarabioyo and Wesley Fofana are all injured.\nSo, forgotten man Benoît Badiashile started against Benfica, with Jorrel Hato likely to come in as his partner; 19 year old Josh Acheampong is the only obvious alternative.\nIn attack, in the absence of Cole Palmer and Liam Delap, Tyrique George started up front in the Champions League but, despite being sent off late on in mid-week, João Pedro will return.\nIn-behind, summer signings Facundo Buonanotte and Alejandro Garnacho got the nod on Tuesday, but Jamie Gittens and Estêvão Willian, who has been underutilised to date, are hoping to come in.\nChelsea predicted lineup vs Liverpool: (4-2-3-1): Sánchez; James, Badiashile, Hato, Cucurella; Caicedo, Fernández, Neto, Buonanotte, Garnacho; João Pedro.\nChelsea player to watch vs Liverpool\nEnzo Fernández scored when Liverpool were beaten at Stamford Bridge in May, his first win over the Reds at the sixth attempt, and he will be key to Chelsea chances on Saturday too.\nLiverpool team news\nTuesday was not just a costly night for Arne Slot in terms of the result but injuries too. Alisson was forced off in İstanbul, so there will be a Premier League debut for Giorgi Mamardashvili in goal, becoming the sixth Georgian to feature in the competition; he's a more than handy back-up.\nOut-field, speaking of serviceable deputies, Hugo Ekitiké also hobbled off against Galatasaray, so Slot will have to pick the most-expensive player in British football history Alexander Isak instead.\nInterestingly, Slot deployed Dominik Szoboszlai at right-back and Jeremie Frimpong in attack in the Champions League; perhaps replacing Trent Alexander-Arnold will be a tough task after all.\nAlexis Mac Allister and Mohamed Salah were rested in mid-week but will return here, the latter having scored eight times to date against the club that cast him aside.\nLiverpool predicted lineup vs Chelsea: (4-3-3): Alisson; Szoboszlai, Konaté, van Dijk, Kerkez; Mac Allister, Gravenberch, Wirtz; Salah, Isak, Gakpo.\nLiverpool player to watch vs Chelsea\nSummer signing Florian Wirtz has not registered a goal nor an assist since the Community Shield, so now would be a good time for the German to come to the fore and prove his doubters wrong.\nChelsea vs Liverpool prediction\nWe are forecasting an away win at Stamford Bridge. Liverpool have their obvious weaknesses, but we do not believe this iteration of Chelsea, without any of their first-choice centre-backs nor Cole Palmer, will be capable of derailing the champions in West London: Chelsea 1-2 Liverpool.\nChelsea vs Liverpool FAQs - Premier League\nHow to watch Chelsea vs Liverpool in the Premier League on TV channel?\nChelsea vs Liverpool in the Premier League will be available on the following TV channels;\n- UK: Sky Sports Main Event, Premier League & Ultra HD.\n- USA: fuboTV, NBC, Peacock & UNIVERSO\n- Canada: Fubo Sports Network Canada\nHow to watch Chelsea vs Liverpool in the Premier League on live streaming?\nChelsea vs Liverpool in the Premier League will be available on the following streaming services;\n- UK: SkyGo & NOW TV.\n- USA: fuboTV, nbcsports.com, Peacock & UNIVERSO\n- Canada: fuboTV Canada\nWhat is the date and kick-off time for Chelsea vs Liverpool in the Premier League?\nChelsea vs Liverpool takes place on Saturday 4 October 2025, with kick off at 17:30 (BST), 12:30 (EDT) & 9:30 (PDT).",
