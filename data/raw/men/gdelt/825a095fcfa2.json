Get ready for Sunday's title match with theScore's comprehensive preview package.\nThe lowdown 📝\nWho: Spain vs. England\nWhat: European Championship final\nWhen: Sunday, July 14 at 3 p.m. ET\nWhere: Olympiastadion (Berlin, Germany)\nReferee: Francois Letexier (France)\nVAR: Jerome Brisard (France)\nHow to watch 📺\nTV: FOX, TUDN, Univision (U.S.); TSN, TLN (Canada)\nStream: fuboTV, FOX Sports (U.S.); CTV (Canada)\nBetting odds 🤑\nOdds via theScore Bet\nSpain: +145\nDraw: +180\nEngland: +230\nKey questions ❓\nWill Spain dominate possession?\nIt seems impossible, but it's true: England has averaged a higher rate of possession than Spain at Euro 2024. The difference is marginal - England's 58.8% mark narrowly tops Spain's 57.3% - and it has a lot to do with the level of opposition each team has faced. Spain navigated a more difficult path to the final, facing Georgia, Germany, and France, while England fought off Slovakia, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. La Roja's type of football is no longer a byproduct of infinite possession anyway. Coach Luis de la Fuente allows his team to play riskier vertical passes and take on defenders. England could follow the same blueprint as Germany did in its narrow quarterfinal defeat to Spain. With 22 fouls in that game, Germany successfully disrupted Spain's rhythm and nearly took it to a penalty shootout.\nWill Kane win the Golden Boot?\nDespite coming under heavy criticism from the likes of Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker, Harry Kane goes into Sunday's final with a share of the lead in Euro scoring. His three goals have either given England the lead or leveled the score, and no one will forget the way he dispatched the winner in the round of 16 against Slovakia. While Kane usually delivers when England so desperately craves a breakthrough, the 30-year-old has played too deep to truly stand out up top. He only had 13 touches in the attacking third against the Netherlands, far too low of a figure for a player surrounded by so much talent. But sometimes the margins are indeed fine, and Kane has used his touches wisely. Now he has a chance to become a Golden Boot winner at both the World Cup and Euros. Gerd Muller is the only player to have achieved that feat. Kane just has to outscore rival Dani Olmo in the final.\nCan Yamal do more damage?\nLamine Yamal is now officially 17 and all the wiser after becoming the youngest player to score in Euro history. We all know he's capable of magic, but England's width could stymie his and Nico Williams' best attempts down the wing. Gareth Southgate has preferred a 3-4-3 formation as of late, with Bukayo Saka at right wing-back and fit-again Luke Shaw emerging on the left. Kyle Walker's recovery pace on the right side of Southgate's back three is an added bonus. So Yamal and Williams may not have as much freedom to dribble down the flanks and into dangerous areas. Then again, England hasn't faced many dribblers like Yamal and Willimas at these Euros. The Three Lions have largely had to unpick low blocks of four and five defenders, so the challenge Sunday will be far different.\nFurther reading 📖\nDive into some of the storylines surrounding the contest\n- 5 key battles that will decide Euro final\n- Kane out to crown England legacy with Euro 2024 glory\n- England's decade of development rewarded\n- Understated Mainoo vital to England's success\n- Spain's 'computer' Rodri finally in charge at Euro 2024\n- Is divisive Morata Spain's weak link or vital cog?\n- Sparkling Spain shows versatility en route to final\n- How Spain has risen after dire decade\nInjury updates 🤕\nThe latest on the lingering lineup questions\nConfirmed lineups ✅\nSpain (4-2-3-1): Unai Simon; Dani Carvajal, Robin Le Normand, Aymeric Laporte, Marc Cucurella; Rodri, Fabian Ruiz; Lamine Yamal, Dani Olmo, Nico Williams; Alvaro Morata\nEngland (3-4-2-1): Jordan Pickford; Marc Guehi, John Stones, Kyle Walker; Luke Shaw, Declan Rice, Kobbie Mainoo, Bukayo Saka; Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden; Harry Kane\nKit matchup 👕\n(Photo courtesy: UEFA)\nPath to the final 🏟\nReviewing how both teams got to Berlin\nSpain\nGroup stage: First place in Group B\nRound of 16: Beat Georgia 4-1\nQuarterfinals: Beat Germany 2-1 AET\nSemifinals: Beat France 2-1\nEngland\nGroup stage: First place in Group C\nRound of 16: Beat Slovakia 2-1 AET\nQuarterfinals: Tied Switzerland 1-1 (won 5-3 on penalties)\nSemifinals: Beat Netherlands 2-1\nBy the numbers 🔢\nRaw statistics for the two finalists\nAdvanced metrics\nTournament pedigree 🏆\nBest European Championship finish for both nations\nSpain: Champion (1964, 2008, 2012)\nSpain is the only team to have won back-to-back European Championships, and the country is looking to become the first to win four in total. La Roja's reign of terror from 2008-2012 - during which time they lifted the World Cup - is considered one of world football's most defining eras. Spain also has an incredible record in finals. Since May 2001, Spanish teams competing in the Champions League, Europa League, World Cup, and Euros have won all 22 finals in which they've faced non-Spanish teams.\nEngland: Finalist (2020)\nEngland is playing in a major tournament final on foreign soil for the first time. It won the 1966 World Cup at Wembley Stadium and lost there to Italy during the Euro 2020 final. No team has ever been defeated in consecutive Euro finals before, and England will hope to avoid making the wrong kind of history. A win in Berlin would end England's 58-year wait for a major men's championship. England's women's team won the Euro in 2022 after beating Germany at Wembley.\nFun facts 🤯\n3: Dani Olmo, who started the tournament on the substitutes' bench, has scored a goal in each of Spain's three knockout matches. David Villa is the only player who's scored in four consecutive matches at either the World Cup or Euros.\n3: England has come from behind to win all three of its knockout matches at Euro 2024, tying the Czech Republic (2004), Turkey (2008), and France (2020) for the most consecutive comeback victories at a single Euro.\n8: Spain has won eight straight matches across all competitions, including all six at this year's Euro. England has won five of its last eight.\n14: Spain needs just one more goal to tie France's 1984 team as the most prolific side in Euro history with 14 goals in a single tournament.\n255: No team at Euro 2024 has won the ball more times than Spain, which has battled off opponents to claim possession on 255 occasions. The statistic is a testament to Spain's high press and commitment to winning duels in midfield.\nWhat they're saying 🗣\nDe la Fuente: \"Our idea of football is based on our self-assurance. I know that we are able to play football, we've seen it throughout the tournament. Individually, (the players) are fantastic, but they offer the collective benefits of their individual qualities ... they always work for the common good, for the collective effort. They are very generous in their efforts and work rate. This is just one more sign that this is an insatiable team, that they want to keep improving with the spirit of sacrifice. I want you to know that this may surprise you more than it surprises us because we knew the possibilities we had.\"\nSouthgate: \"We all want to be loved, right? When you're doing something for your country, and you're a proud Englishman, when you don't feel that back, and when all you read is criticism, it's hard. So to be able to celebrate a second final is very, very special, especially with fans that travel. The traveling support is amazing. The amount of money they've spent to travel, the commitment to do that, to be able to give them nights like this - and we've definitely given them a few over the last six years from Russia onward - means a lot.\"\nPrediction 🔮\nSpain 1, England 1 (England wins 4-3 on penalties)\nOn paper, Spain should beat England. But the game is played on grass, and in Germany, the Three Lions have already snatched victory from the jaws of defeat more than once. England has won games like Real Madrid have won titles, scoring in critical moments and doing just enough to advance. All you need in tournament football is a great sense of timing, and England appears to have it. Expect Kane, Phil Foden, or Jude Bellingham to score the goal that takes the game to extra time. Spain will limit England's chances using possession as a form of defense but will eventually fall in a shootout, handing the English their first-ever European Championship.",
