  "body_text": "Will Cristiano Ronaldo, N’Golo Kante and the other Saudi Arabia-based stars be ready to impress at this summer’s European Championship and Copa America after spending time away from the respective continents’ major leagues?\nThat is one of the big questions as the tournaments gets underway this week.\nAdvertisement\nRonaldo, in particular, continues to pick up accolades for his record-breaking feats, but has not been able to help Al Nassr to success this season. Kante, meanwhile, is finally back in the France squad after a lengthy absence from the national setup.\nTwo other former Premier League players, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ruben Neves, have both excelled for Saudi Pro League winners Al Hilal, but there have also been a fair share of flops, too. But, after a season in the Saudi Pro League, how prepared will the contingent be heading to Germany or the Copa? And how concerned are their national team coaches about their ability to perform on the biggest stage?\nThe Athletic takes a look.\nOn an individual level, at least, Cristiano Ronaldo continues to grab headlines. The 39-year-old struck 50 times in 51 appearances for Al Nassr this season, including a record 35 in the Saudi Pro League.\nIt was the kind of impact expected when the Portuguese joined on a dizzying £170million ($216.4m) annual salary at the end of 2022, but not enough to prevent the Riyadh-based club finishing 14 points behind league winners Al Hilal in the Pro League table.\nIndeed, the domestic season ended in disappointment for Ronaldo, with Al Nassr beaten on penalties by Al Hilal in the King’s Cup final at the end of last month. After a 5-4 shootout defeat, a visibly upset Ronaldo slumped to the turf before leaving the pitch in tears to chants of “Messi, Messi” from some fans, much to the apparent delight of Al Hilal’s injured former Barcelona forward Neymar watching on in the stands.\nHe’s a troll🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/KhapbfBqAL\n— JJ🇬🇵 (@jovicism1) June 1, 2024\nMessi-inspired taunts are nothing new for Ronaldo, of course, but have led to him losing his cool this season. In February, he was given a one-match ban for an offensive gesture after cupping his ear to Al Shabab supporters and thrusting his hands towards his pelvis.\nAdvertisement\nEven at 39, though, Ronaldo remains a key man for his country. He struck 10 goals in qualifying for Roberto Martinez’s side and is likely to dovetail with Paris Saint-Germain’s Goncalo Ramos in an exciting-looking Portugal attack.\nRonaldo has spent a period after the King’s Cup defeat recuperating with family on holiday, missing last Tuesday’s 4-2 friendly win over Finland before watching the 2-1 defeat to Croatia from the bench.\nBut the fact that he scored twice in Tuesday’s 3-0 win over the Republic of Ireland underlines that he remains pivotal to Portugal’s chances of success. This summer may represent a final chance to bow out from major international competition on a high.\nTwo years after his last call-up, N’Golo Kante is back in the France squad. The former Chelsea midfielder missed the 2022 World Cup through injury but made 44 appearances for Al-Ittihad after joining last summer.\nLast season’s champions slipped to fifth this time around, finishing a staggering 42 points off top spot, but Kante did enough to prove his fitness to national team head coach Didier Deschamps.\n“I am convinced that the team will be better with him,” Deschamps said after naming his squad. “He has regained his athletic abilities. We can discuss the specific intensity in Saudi Arabia, but he played more than 4,000 minutes.\n“He has a status and that weighs heavy, but it’s N’Golo and N’Golo is always fine. Even in training, players prefer to have him in their team than facing him.”\nSome 733 days after his last cap, Kante played 64 minutes of a 3-0 win over Luxembourg last Wednesday before playing a full 90 in a goalless draw with Canada on Sunday.\nHis return is timely for Les Bleus, especially given fellow midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni’s recent injury problems.\nA popular member of the squad, Kante has impressed team-mates since joining up with the group at Clairefontaine ahead of this summer’s tournament.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s incredible because I think he is capable of occupying two positions at the same time,” right-back Jonathan Clauss said. “His work rate and intelligence are very impressive.\n“We’ve found him the same as always: very quiet but always smiling, always positive and never with a bad word to say.”\nAfter developing leadership traits in Saudi, he is expected to impart his vast knowledge on France’s youthful core of players such as Tchouameni, Eduardo Camavinga and Warren Zaire-Emery.\n“I’m almost the same but it’s a new experience being in Saudi, in a different role as an experienced player who has to help young players,” Kante said. “Passing stuff on to the team is something I’ve learned there. Here, it happens naturally and doesn’t need to be forced.\n“I knew that it would perhaps be more difficult to get back into the squad, but also I knew that if I performed well I still had a chance.\n“I have no doubt over my capacities. I come off the back of a season where matches were very close. I played regularly and that was an excellent way of getting into top condition.”\nOnly Ronaldo scored more Pro League goals this season than Aleksandar Mitrovic (28) as the former Fulham man helped steer Al Hilal to the league and cup double.\nThe Serbian has bullied defences with his physicality this season, scoring 40 times in just 44 games across all competitions, including the opener in the recent King’s Cup final.\n“The physicality of the league, of the players, the tempo of the game is different,” the 29-year-old told Sky last month. Repeating the feat in Germany is likely to be challenging.\nFellow Serbian Sergej Milinkovic-Savic has also thrived at Al Hilal this season, scoring 12 times and registering 17 assists in 44 appearances, and will be key to his country’s hopes.\nFormer Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves was another member of that dominant Al Hilal side, registering 19 goal involvements across 48 appearances from his deep-lying role. Neves officially joined the Saudi club on July 1 last summer for a fee of £47million and ruled himself out of a January loan move to Newcastle United.\nAdvertisement\n“There was Newcastle interest before I came here but I’m really happy here, my family’s really happy, so I’m having a great time,” he told the BBC.\nLike Ronaldo, the 27-year-old played 120 minutes in the King’s Cup final at the end of the month, missing a penalty in the shootout, and was given extra leave by Portugal to recuperate before joining up with the group ahead of the Euros.\nNeves will compete for a place in a stacked Portugal midfield also boasting Bruno Fernandes, Joao Palhinha, Matheus Nunes and PSG’s Vitinha among others.\nAl Hilal lost just once in 53 games this season and won three domestic trophies. But concerns over the quality and competitive balance of Saudi’s top division remain.\nAccording to Opta’s most recent power rankings, the Saudi Pro League is the 27th-strongest league in the world. Analysis from Twenty First Group ranks them even lower, at 59, with the expansion from 16 to 18 teams dragging the overall average down. Twenty First’s rankings are based purely on results, with both Al Nassr and Al Hilal losing to the UAE’s Al Ain in the AFC Champions League.\nAymeric Laporte made headlines earlier this season when he spoke out about the difficulties in adapting to life in the Pro League. In an interview with Spanish media, the ex-Manchester City defender claimed “many players are unhappy”.\n“It’s a big change and they have not made it easy for us,” he said. “Many of us have also come here not only for football and are happy with that. In terms of quality of life, I expected something different because in the end here you spend three hours a day in the car.”\nLaporte made 39 appearances for second-place Al Nassr, who ended with the joint-fifth-best defensive record overall.\nHe was named in Spain’s 26-man squad for the Euros but missed their 5-0 warm-up win over Andorra last Wednesday after playing in the King’s Cup final, before a second-half appearance as a substitute in the 5-1 win over Northern Ireland.\nGeorginio Wijnaldum was made captain by his former Liverpool team-mate Steven Gerrard at Al-Ettifaq after Jordan Henderson left the club for Ajax in January.\nAdvertisement\nEttifaq struggled between November and February, going winless in eight games and finished sixth overall, with the Dutchman their second-top scorer on seven.\nNow 33, Wijnaldum admitted that he had pushed to join Feyenoord before leaving PSG for Saudi last summer. He has since told Dutch media that “life is very good” in his new home. “From what I have seen, everybody is welcome in Saudi,” he said.\nWijnaldum faces competition from Frenkie de Jong and Ryan Gravenberch for a place in Ronald Koeman’s side this summer.\nVersatile Belgian forward Yannick Carrasco managed seven goals and seven assists as Al Shabab finished eighth. The 30-year-old started on the left wing as Belgium warmed up for the Euros with a 2-0 win over Montenegro last week.\nDemarai Gray struck four goals and registered four assists for Ettifaq this season after joining from Everton and is expected to be a key part of Jamaica’s attack for this summer’s Copa America alongside Fulham’s Bobby Decordova-Reid.\nThen there are the absentees. The most high profile from this summer’s Copa is Neymar.\nThe Brazilian, who joined Al Hilal in an £80million move last summer, is recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury sustained playing for his country in October.\n“It’s painful, there’s a lot of suffering,” he said this month. “Seven months have already passed since the injury, and there are still some to go, but we’re getting there.”\nThe 32-year-old also played down talk of a move back to former club Santos.\n“I still have one year left at Al Hilal and hope to have a great season. It’s true that Santos is the club of my heart and I would like to return one day, but I don’t have a plan in mind”.\nBrazil’s Copa squad contains no Saudi-based players, with former Liverpool duo Roberto Firmino and Fabinho high-profile omissions.\nAdvertisement\nFirmino scored a hat-trick on his debut for Al-Ahli but failed to score in his next 18 appearances, prompting speculation he was looking for a move back to the Premier League.\nHe was relegated to the bench in November but ended his drought in February from the penalty spot and ended with nine goals and six assists in 32 league appearances.\nFabinho, meanwhile, won five of his first six matches at Al-Ittihad, but missed two months of the season through injury before returning to play 45 minutes on the final day against Al Nassr.\n“Embarrassing” was Toni Kroos reply to news that Spanish gem Gabri Veiga had chosen to swap Celta Vigo for Al-Ahli last summer. Veiga, for his part, said he saw it as his “best option to develop as a player”.\nBut the move has not yet worked out as hoped. Troubled by an ankle injury, midfielder Veiga managed just 18 starts and four goals this season and was left out of Spain’s squad for this summer’s tournament.\nA host of top clubs have been linked with a move to bring the 22-year-old back to Europe.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
