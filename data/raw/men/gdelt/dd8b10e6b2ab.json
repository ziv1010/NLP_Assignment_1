  "body_text": "Farewell, Gareth Southgate - thank you for the memories\n- Gareth Southgate has stepped down after an incredible eight years in charge of England\n- Former Middlesbrough boss remains only Three Lions manager ever to reach two Euros finals\n- Southgate's successor has yet to be named\n102 games, 64 wins, two successive Euros finals - Gareth Southgate has closed the door on a truly illustrious eight years in charge of England, etching his name into the history books as the nation's second-most successful manager.\nA man who lives and breathes English football, Southgate has stepped down from leading the Three Lions after missing out on another chance to claim victory at a major tournament. A World Cup semi-final in 2018, an immense run to the final of Euro 2020 and now a heartbreaking finish to Euro 2024, fans continued to believe that Southgate was in fact 'the one'.\nBut now, if England do end their countless decades of hurt, it will be with someone else at the helm.\nRecent years have painted Southgate in a misguided light, highlighting only his inability to bring football home to England and lift a major tournament trophy.\nHowever, his tenure began long before the likes of Jude Bellingham and Kobbie Mainoo arrived - when Southgate worked to turn a team of underachievers into some of the world's most memorable names on the international stage.\nHis work with England's Under-21 squad from 2013 to 2016 forged a pathway to the senior team for so many bright stars. Marcus Rashford was one of the key young players to shine under Southgate's guidance upon promotion from the Young Lions to the Three Lions - the Manchester United star scored a hat-trick during the boss' last ever game in charge of the young squad, a 6-1 win over Norway, marking an unbelievable debut and later securing a spot in the first team.\nBefore long, both Southgate and Rashford were stepping up to the big leagues together with just one goal in mind - to win.\nAnd, the England boss' introduction to the senior team came as a shock to everyone, after initially just filling in when Sam Allardyce was sacked after just 67 days in charge.\nThe interim boss impressed, overseeing two wins and two draws, and soon Southgate found himself putting pen to paper on a four-year deal. Four games turned into eight years and countless tournaments, as Southgate rose to become one of the most prominent names in English football.\nBut the England job is truly a poisoned chalice, and no matter how much success Southgate brought, his tactics were constantly questioned and ridiculed.\nHis cautious manner brought problems for the nation, who always seemed to play reactively rather than proactively. This was once again shown on the international stage in Germany this summer, as England reached yet another Euros final but fell short at the final hurdle, with substitutions and changes often coming too late.\nBut, aside from the heartache, Southgate allowed England fans to believe that football could one day come home again. Memories of tears, elation and desire came with him in the dugout, and for that his achievements are immeasurable.\nHis reign will be looked back on with fondness, as most eras in football often are, and soon fans will forget the long nights and sometimes uninspiring displays.\nSouthgate's successor remains undetermined by the FA, but anyone willing to follow in his footsteps must be brave and willing to take the hits of leading this great nation.\nEnglish football boasts unbelievable talent. An attacking line up of the Bundesliga's top goalscorer Harry Kane, Champions League winner Bellingham, treble winner Foden and Arsenal starboy Bukayo Saka to name just a few screams success, and a tournament trophy is just within reach.\nSouthgate may not be 'the one' to end England's wait for success, but the power of his football will be remembered forever.",
