However, the likes of Nick Pope, Kieran Trippier, Sven Botman and Dan Burn have been instant hits and all have their place in Newcastle’s strongest eleven.\nUnsurprisingly, Newcastle have excelled in their own half, with their mark of 15 by far the fewest goals conceded by any Premier League side this season. The joint-second meanest defences come from Arsenal and Chelsea who’ve both shipped eight goals more (23).\nHowever, finding the net at the other end has been a challenge for Newcastle. Indeed, they’ve slipped down to fifth place in the league following a run of one win in seven. The Magpies have scored just three times in that stretch.\nA creative midfielder is believed to be on the club’s radar over the summer and one name banded around was Eintracht Frankfurt’s Daichi Kamada.\nThe Japan international, 26, will become a free agent at season’s end and per 90min, Newcastle were among those chasing his signature.\nKamada operates in an attacking midfield role and has bagged 13 goals and five assists across all competitions this season with Frankfurt.\nNewcastle were labelled ‘confident’ they were leading the race, but per Fabrizio Romano, their hopes have been dashed.\nThe transfer guru tweeted Borussia Dortmund are ‘closing in’ on the free agent swoop after Kamada ‘verbally agreed’ to a five-year deal.\nRomano noted there were approaches made by ‘three more clubs’, though stopped short of confirming whether Newcastle were among them.\nIn any case, barring a dramatic late U-turn, Kamada will be joining Dortmund in June.\nKamada miss to heighten Maddison need\nThe transfer miss is unlikely to deter Newcastle who may now be emboldened to pursue Leicester City’s James Maddison.\nMaddison is the same age as Kamada and the Magpies have twice seen bids for the playmaker knocked back since the Saudis took charge. Their latest offer last summer, per Sky Sports, was understood to be worth £50m.\nLeicester refused to budge, though the story could be different one year later.\nMaddison will have just one year remaining on his deal at season’s end and as such, the summer window will represent Leicester’s last chance to extract full market value for their talisman.\nThe Northern Echo reported Newcastle made another ‘enquiry’ into a Maddison transfer in January. Leicester quickly dismissed any notion of a mid-season sale, but Howe’s men are primed to make a more concrete approach in the summer.\nThe Northern Echo stated a ‘renewed attempt’ to sign Maddison will be made and potentially being able to offer Champions League football would be a feather in their cap.\nMaddison is a bona fide creative force and has racked up 14 goal contributions in 19 matches for Leicester this term.\nThat’s doubled down on his undoubted talents after he returned figures of 18 goals and 12 assists in 53 matches last season.\nTRANSFER GOSSIP: Klopp turns to Serie A to fix leaky Liverpool defence as £50m Inter star becomes top target; Newcastle leading quartet of clubs in £26.5m defender chase",
