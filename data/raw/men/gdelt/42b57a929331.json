They'd experienced a dip in form at the back end of last season, but given the sanctions the club were under, that was at least understandable.\nIn Thomas Tuchel, Boehly had one of the best and most tactically flexible head coaches in world football to help steer his vision, with the American tycoon appointing himself as the interim sporting director for his first transfer window.\nPerhaps the alarm bells should have been ringing when Tuchel had to talk Boehly out of an ill-advised move for Cristiano Ronaldo.\nThe summer of Boehly saw Chelsea spend a world record £271.1m on transfers. Tuchel was inexplicably fired one week after the window closed.\nA strange decision, sure, but not one without reason (even if the reason isn't a particularly good one). In American sports, the owners of new franchises are known to act impulsively after purchasing a team. They go wild and get busy, making big moves for big hitters.\nBoehly saw something in Graham Potter, a tactical tinkerer who oversaw Brighton's transition from relegation battlers to a solid mid-table side.\nBut his whole tenure was marred by strange formation and personnel choices, which were largely a backdrop for another chaotic and expensive transfer window.\nThe briefs came out - Cobham's training facilities could not physically house all of Chelsea's first-team, the extremely bloated squad could not gel, and the out-of-his-depth coach was not able to piece a crooked jigsaw together.\nEnding the Potter experiment made sense, but re-appointing Frank Lampard as a caretaker did not. Again, Boehly aggressively swerved to the left when all he needed to do was gently veer to the right. They finished 12 in the Premier League table, losing nine of 11 games under the legendary midfielder.\nREAD MORE ON MAURICIO POCHETTINO'S APPOINTMENT AT CHELSEA\nChelsea have now turned to Mauricio Pochettino, former boss of rivals Spurs, on a two-year contract with the option of a third.\nThe situation at Chelsea isn't ideal for any manager to walk into, but of all the realistic candidates to succeed Potter, Pochettino ticks the most boxes.\nThere is a charm and charisma about the Argentine that is exactly the sort of galvanising factor to breathe life into that overcrowded dressing room. Potter was intensely criticised for his bland Joe Bloggs demeanour, despite the desperation to push his 'glow up' into the mainstream discourse.\nIf Chelsea are serious about a long-term project centred around the development of young players and trying to punch up instead of down (a venture they didn't even need to embark on when Boehly took over, but that's an argument for another day), then Pochettino's track record trumps most others. The only club he was not able to focus on this was PSG, where instead the remit was to get the most out of three superstars.\nThat dynamic doesn't really exist at Chelsea anymore. There are good and borderline world class players at Stamford Bridge, but none that could seriously argue that they should have a team built around them - again a factor which fits Pochettino's cerebral philosophy.\nThe deepest red flag against Pochettino is his connection to Tottenham, but he'll undoubtedly have a bit of a chip on his shoulder that will drive him forward, desperate to get one over his former boss. He was, of course, seemingly overlooked for a return to north London.\nAnd besides, Chelsea just love inflicting needless misery to Tottenham. This is a move more in-keeping with the popular old regime.\nThe resources available to Pochettino at Chelsea greatly outweigh those he had at Spurs. One can only assume that he's been assured some sort of say in transfer policy unlike at PSG - walking into another such setup would be unwise.\nPochettino has a wealth of Premier League and Champions League experience, has dealt with up-and-coming stars and ready made ones, and now even has silverware. He is the most suitable candidate to lead a new era at Chelsea.\nLISTEN NOW\nOn this week's edition of Talking Transfers, part of the 90min podcast network, Scott Saunders is joined by Toby Cudworth and Graeme Bailey to discuss all the latest transfer news.
