But there was concern late on in the game as Bellingham hobbled off the pitch minutes before the full-time whistle, with many onlookers already turning their attention to the weekend clash with Barcelona.\nAfter the final whistle, Ancelotti was quizzed over the severity of Bellingham's injury, and the Italian provided an encouraging update for those concerned that the Englishman may be missing from what many consider to be the biggest game in world football.\n\"He is ok. His adductors are a bit charged because the pitch was a bit soft. But nothing special. He will recover,\" Ancelotti told Movistar (via Marca).\n\"He is ok. He is a bit tired, like everybody else. But that's normal.\"\nAncelotti's comments suggest Bellingham's withdrawal was nothing more than a precautionary measure, giving a huge lift for Madrid as they look to build on their strong start to the domestic season.\nBellingham has played a huge role in the club's charge to the top of La Liga - they've won eight games from a possible ten and collected 25 points - but Madrid face the ultimate test against a Barcelona side who trail them by just a point and are still unbeaten.\nBarca have been dealt an injury blow of their own, with Pedri unlikely to feature despite initial hope that he'd have overcome a hamstring injury, although Xavi has a number of emerging talents from the club's academy to keep spirits raised in Catalonia.",
