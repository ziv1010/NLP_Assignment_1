Foden featured prominently as England reached the Euro 2024 final and admitted after the 5-0 midweek win he has needed time to get back to full fitness.\n\"Last year there were so many games,\" Foden said. \"I put everything I could into it. I came back a little bit fatigued, which is normal. Rodri came back like that as well, a few players.\n\"It's normal how many games we play - you have to burnout at some point. I'm making steps in the right direction and trying to get back to my best.\n\"I had a bit of fatigue coming back from last year, a bit of illness.\n\"A few niggles as well. A few things added together. But if you speak to any player they've all been through it, the ups and downs of football. It was just a bump in the road if you like, I'm delighted I'm back and enjoying my football.\"\nFoden put City into an early lead with a third-minute effort against Sparta before Erling Haaland struck twice alongside goals from John Stones and Matheus Nunes.\nThey are now third in the newly reformatted Champions League table after two wins and a draw, with only English rivals Aston Villa and Liverpool ahead of them. The latest victory also helped City break a historic record previously held by local foes Manchester United for 15 years.",
