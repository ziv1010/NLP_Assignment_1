There is also a four-part podcast series, brought to you by George Caulkin, The Athletic and Sir Bobby Robson’s family. To listen, just search for ‘Pod on the Tyne’ on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, The Athletic app or wherever you get your podcasts, or follow this link.\nAdvertisement\nAn hour earlier, he had been playing down there for Newcastle United, playing like it was his first game or his last, and now he clambers up the stadium steps, turns right and crunches his tall frame into plastic moulding. Dan Burn is high in the East Stand of St James’ Park, back where it started — “Row S, seats 106 and 107, me to the left of my dad” — and he is gawping at the turf and falling in love, all over again.\n“Class,” he says, years dissolving into night. Class is a word he uses a lot.\nAs we approach what would have been his 90th birthday, we are here to talk about Sir Bobby Robson, whose team Burn watched from this seat as a kid. We are talking about how one life touches many others, how it expands beyond itself. We are talking about Sir Bobby sitting here with his father, just like Burn did with his, Bobby marvelling at Albert Stubbins, Dan “100 per cent thinking I was going to be the next Alan Shearer”.\nMemory groping, Burn picks through his version of Sir Bobby’s side: “Shay Given, Olivier Bernard, normally Titus Bramble, maybe Jonathan Woodgate. Right-back would have been… Stephen Carr? Laurent Robert, Nobby Solano, Jermaine Jenas probably. I remember Gary Speed a little bit and then Shearer and Shola Ameobi or Shearer and Craig Bellamy. I loved Robert and the goals he scored. Him and Bernard down the left. Class, like.”\nBurn is Eddie Howe’s left-back. Playing behind Robert, a winger high on thrills and low on tracking back — Sir Bobby reckoned he cajoled the Frenchman more than any other player — might have been different. A little less class. Burn laughs. “No! No chance,” he says. He pauses, a natural comedian building to his punchline. “Mind, Allan (Saint-Maximin) is similar!”\nThe hardest thing for Burn, 30, to grasp, the bit that makes his brain swim, is how he and Bernard, or he and Shearer, are now the same. When Sir Bobby came home to Newcastle in 1999, it was to a club floundering and a team bottom of the Premier League. He grafted and rebuilt, lifting them to fourth, third and then fifth, into the Champions League, those heady nights, competing and pushing, getting closer.\nAdvertisement\nBurn’s Newcastle are fourth in the table and in the Carabao Cup final, one game away from what Sir Bobby and Kevin Keegan never quite achieved, one game away from releasing the great obsession. He is already living his childhood dream and now he is reliving the echo of it, that old yearning for this year to be our year. He is a big lad, a Blyth lad, but it makes his throat constrict.\nHe tries “to be cold”, on the pitch, he says, to “cut every emotion off because I know I’ve got a job to do. I try not to think about it too much because you can lose your focus”, but the idea that children in the East Stand might one day reel off his name just like he reels off Robert and Shearer, like Sir Bobby did with Stubbins, is almost too much to compute. “It’s amazing. Very emotional,” he says.\nSir Bobby once asked, “What is a club, in any case?” His answer was: “The noise, the passion, the feeling of belonging, the pride in your city.” His answer was family and the ties that bind us, the trek up steep stairs of the stand, hand-in-hand with Dad or Mam or sister or brother. Burn did it, Shearer did it, Sir Bobby did it; we all have our own version. We hold it close.\nSir Bobby was Newcastle’s manager for five years. A County Durham boy, he came home to the north east of England after five decades away and a career of many lives; pitman; player and manager; 20 England caps; club-builder and trophy-winner at Ipswich Town; Maradona’s ‘Hand of God’; Paul Gascoigne’s twinkling feet and sprinkling tears; those pioneering outposts in the Netherlands and Portugal and Catalonia.\nThere was a quality, just beyond description, which made him belong to everybody, but Newcastle was his core. The Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, which has raised millions of pounds to help detect and treat cancer through the NHS, represents a huge part of his legacy, but what is striking — and moving — is how far and deep that legacy stretches here, even now.\nAdvertisement\nAmeobi and Steve Harper, Sir Bobby’s players, are in positions of prominence at Newcastle. Neil Stoker, the kitman, is another direct link. Andy Tully, the groundsman, says Sir Bobby “took me under his wing, like a grandad” — he still tends Lady Elsie’s garden.\nThere’s Burn on the pitch. There is a statue at the ground, a bust in the old Milburn Reception, a memorabilia cabinet on Level Two, rooms named after him. His “What is a club” quote is on a banner in the East Stand and on a wall at Newcastle United’s foundation. His likeness is everywhere.\nWhy? What did he do or represent that still resonates? “It’s an interesting point,” says Ameobi, who is now Newcastle’s loan manager. “We didn’t win anything. But he was instrumental in unifying the club, bringing it together. Seeing the demise of that, the deconstruction of what he built, underlined it. He understood what Newcastle meant and realised its power. He’s woven into us.”\nSir Bobby was humble, but he also knew his own worth. He returned to Newcastle with the dressing room riven and the club on its knees, with the money gone and primitive training facilities he described as “appalling”. “I had to make the club a giant again,” he would say. “I set it right.”\n“He was a man of the people,” Burn says. “Everyone had a bond with him. You felt like he was part of your family. I remember when they fired him. It was horrific. I hated it. I’ve never had that feeling about a manager. You felt as if everyone loved him, everyone had respect for him, the players played for him and the fans fed off it.\n“People still speak about him. He’s a massive part of the club. The fabric of it. He’s what we stand for. When I came for my medical last January, as soon as you walk through the training ground door, there’s a picture of Sir Bobby. First thing I saw. You just think, ‘Class, that’. He’s never forgotten.”\nStoker stands beside that picture. It is the reception area at Longbenton. There is an electronic screen greeting the players with an honours board for the squad’s best trainers (Burn is one of them). Sir Bobby’s photograph is to the right, immaculate in club blazer and black and white tie. “Sometimes when I walk in I’ll say, ‘Morning Bobby’,” Stoker says. “It’s just a picture, but I do.”\nOther photos of heroes and iconic matches have been recycled and moved. Not this one.\nStoker was on the club’s stewarding team when Sir Bobby was appointed. Pretty soon, at Robson’s behest, it became a full-time job on the kit staff, which Stoker combined with an unofficial role driving him to functions, “and the best time of my life”.\nAdvertisement\nThe affection is unashamedly personal. “He looked after you,” Stoker says. “He had time for everybody. Honest, straight to the point. I’m proud of working with him, proud I got to know him. I wish I could go back to those days, just for 10 minutes, and ask him, ‘Gaffer, what do you think?’. I can hear his voice in the distance, always with that little laugh.”\nThere is something else there, too. With Newcastle stirring and straining again, it is a reminder of how Sir Bobby did the same, bringing it together, with no takeover and very little cash. For the first time, since his time, they are truly one. “I couldn’t believe the years after Sir Bobby left, when everything started going downhill,” says Burn. “The club never really recovered.”\n“Bobby had to rebuild from the bottom and it was a slow process,” Stoker says. “It was a struggle because we had players who didn’t want to be here. He put in a structure without being able to spend. It’s been more quick now, but with Eddie the bond is obvious. It’s all about togetherness. That’s what Bobby did; in it together, out together, play together, fight together.\n“The first week Eddie was here, I was like, ‘Ah, this is just like the Bobby days’. Just watching the way Eddie is so passionate. Bobby was so passionate. He was all football, football, football. Eddie is all football. The two of them are the same.”\nAmeobi says similar. “Like Sir Bobby, Eddie understands the culture has to be right, to the point he doesn’t want anyone to come in who will disrupt what he’s trying to build,” he says. “Walking into the training ground and seeing all the lads sitting together, knowing it hasn’t been forced — that takes me back.\n“Sir Bobby was never off the training pitch. He loved being out there. Eddie is the same; time, effort, attention to detail. Bobby loved developing young players; he put so much into me and the others. There’s a mirroring of that work ethic. It’s not that other managers haven’t worked hard, there’s just a different intensity.”\nHowe did not know Sir Bobby but “admired him from afar”.\nAdvertisement\n“The bridge between club and supporters has been rebuilt,” says Harper, former goalkeeper, the longest-serving player in Newcastle’s history and now its academy manager. “Sir Bobby would be first to say that when Newcastle is united it’s a force. Nobody would be prouder now. I was fortunate enough to play in the Champions League for him and those days are hopefully on the horizon again. It’s been too long. He’d tell you: it’s where the club should be.”\nThere were always little messages, little lessons.\nAmeobi: “Sir Bobby had been managing in Europe and there were a lot of things he brought in that weren’t the norm.”\nStoker: “He had a rule — everybody ate dinner (lunch) together. One o’clock on the dot; players, staff, everybody in the canteen.”\nHarper: “We weren’t allowed to start until he came into the room. He would have soup, a couple of bread rolls and then his main course. But he would be telling stories so it would take a long time.”\nStoker: “All the players would be finished and suddenly you’d hear this banging.”\nHarper: “There would be banging on the tables, people shouting, ‘Come on! Hurry up!’.”\nAmeobi: “People used to get really annoyed.”\nStoker: “More banging. The lads were saying, ‘Gaffer, can we go?’. He wasn’t budging. He looked at me one time and said, ‘They’re not going’.”\nHarper: “Alan was probably the biggest one for wanting to get away, the biggest culprit in terms of voicing his not-so-subtle dissent.”\nStoker: “More banging. ‘They can do it all day if they want’, Bobby says. And then it stopped. And after about five minutes he would get up and say, ‘Right, see you tomorrow, lads’.”\nAmeobi: “If you look at our team, we had the likes of Alan, Rob Lee and Speedo, but then you had a big chasm with the younger players. If he hadn’t manipulated us into spending time together it would never have happened.”\nAdvertisement\nHarper: “Was he asserting his authority? Was he trying to forge team spirit by everybody eating together? Probably both.”\nAmeobi: “Those moments are where you started forming bonds, when people talk to each other. Sir Bobby understood you had to sacrifice things for the greater good. It was his way of saying nobody is bigger than the collective.”\nHarper: “Fast forward to 2009. Alan, who is one of my best mates, is named Newcastle’s interim caretaker manager. What does he do, day one? Everybody eats at 1pm… and nobody starts until he enters the room.”\nTo Newcastle’s academy, a few fields across from the first-team training ground. Harper patrols the corridors. He knows everybody by name as he shows off a thriving, buzzy facility. As with the rest of the club, the takeover has brought expansion, a lifting of standards, and a link between age groups and departments. Finally, united.\nWe walk through the busy canteen. “Bobby used to say, ‘You’re all Ferraris and you can’t run a Ferrari unless you put the right fuel in it’,” Harper says. “It gets quoted in our dining room all the time. Even if I’m more like a midsize estate car now.” We stop outside the Sir Bobby Robson Room. “I pull up everyone who drops the ‘Sir’,” says Harper. “I’ll say, ‘He worked hard for that knighthood’.”\nHe pokes his head inside. “Sir Bobby detested lateness,” Harper says. “If anybody missed the start of a meeting he’d say, ‘You’ve missed the train, son’. One of his favourites was, ‘If you’re on the 9am train and you get to the station at 9, the train’s gone. Good pros are always five, 10 minutes early’. I’ve heard 17-, 18-year-old boys here saying, ‘You’re going to miss the train’. He lives on in all those golden nuggets.”\nOn the front door of the building, a few words: ‘Today is your opportunity’. On the other side, seen when players walk out: ‘Did you make the most of today?’.\nAdvertisement\n“Those things, they’re all him,” Harper says. “They might not have his name underneath, but they were what he was about. Like me, he was from a mining community, and he passionately wanted players to appreciate where they were, feeling the honour, fighting for the jersey, taking that opportunity.”\nHarper was one of the senior players Robson called his “blue chip” boys, but he related to everybody. “He could play multiple parts,” Harper says. “As manager, you’ve got to be tactician, father, grandfather, counsellor, mentor, public speaker, and because of his experience, he was comfortable in all of those roles. That’s a real skill. He was almost omnipresent.\n“Day one, he got to know you as an individual. He looked you in the eye — ‘big club this, son, can you play here?’ — and he worked out if you needed an arm around your shoulder or a kick up the backside. If he thought you weren’t maxing out, he’d be on you. He would really listen. You could talk to him. He had a personal investment in you.\n“He also had a spiky side. He was a proud man who would defend himself and the club and he could stick his elbows out. I remember playing Blackburn (Rovers) away in the cup and I got beat to a through ball. Bobby gave it to me at half-time. I’ll never forget it because I’d never had it before. Anyway, I didn’t concede in the second half and we won. The art was what was needed in the moment.”\nHarper and Ameobi relate similar anecdotes from their playing days. “For the first couple of years me and Shay (Given) went toe to toe and then Shay kicked on and was phenomenal, and there were long stints when I was out of the team,” Harper says. “I wanted to go out on loan. I was psyching myself up, I was going to say this or that to Sir Bobby, I was full of hell and then I went into his office…\n“Ten minutes later, I’m walking down the corridor feeling on top of the world and definitely not going on loan. I walked another few yards and stopped: ‘How the hell did that just happen?’. I was trying to process it. He’d shaken me by the hand, given me a hug and completely disarmed me.”\nAmeobi recalls: “Monday afternoon, there was always a queue outside his door, with three or four people waiting to see him, frustrated they weren’t playing. Everyone would come out with his arm round their shoulders, smiling, best friends. It became a thing — how does he do it?”\nIt wasn’t just about verbal dexterity. Harper also recalls: “Shola out there practising his left foot as a youngster. It was nowhere near what it was by the end of his career and it was because Sir Bobby was on him, ‘Come on, son, keep working’, pulling his leg if he missed the target but appreciating he was putting it in.”\nAdvertisement\nAmeobi made his debut under Sir Bobby. Chelsea at home. “It was the first time I’d really spoken to him,” he says. “The first thing he says to me, that voice of his, ‘Hello, son’. I was 18 and shaking, standing in front of this mystical figure.\n“It was hard because I didn’t really feel part of the group at that point. He tried to make me comfortable, to encourage me and calm me down. On the morning of the game, I remember him saying, ‘Don’t try to be anyone else, son. Just be you — that’s what I need’.”\nAmeobi takes a breath. “He was my everything,” he says. “In terms of manager, in terms of mentor. He was like a father. That’s how I viewed him, as a father figure. From a football standpoint, what I learned from him was immense, but it was more about being a human being, a man. When I think of Sir Bobby, it wasn’t just about what you did. It was who you were.” He says it again and the room becomes misty. “He was everything.”\nSir Bobby Robson would have turned 90 this Saturday.\nTo mark that special occasion we've released Bobby '90, an exclusive podcast series featuring previously unheard interviews with one of football's most iconic figures.\nListen for free wherever you get your podcasts… pic.twitter.com/RPYSpZgtmJ\n— The Athletic | Football (@TheAthleticFC) February 13, 2023\nThe name business.\nHarper: “I’m not sure if he had me mixed up with Paul Cooper, who he’d had at Ipswich, but he called me ‘Paul’ for a few months.”\nStoker: “Bobby used to call Lee Bowyer ‘Neil’. In training one day, he starts shouting, ‘Neil, get over here’, so I started walking over and he goes, ‘No, not you… Neil, get over here’, and he’s shouting at Lee. The real Lee went off on one: ‘If he calls me Neil one more time I’m going to say something’.”\nAmeobi: “Everyone knows the Carl Cort story, it’s been told a million times. You might not know how annoyed I used to get being called ‘Carl’ though. It wasn’t just a couple of weeks, it was a few months. I was having arguments with John Carver, his assistant, saying, ‘What the hell is he doing?’.”\nAdvertisement\nStoker: “So Lee was doing something and Bobby called out again, ‘Neil, get over here’, and Lee has just shouted: ‘GAFFER, MY NAME IS LEE’. And Bobby says, ‘Yes, I know, son, calm down, just testing you’.”\nHarper: “We used to talk about it, me and Alan. I’m not so sure he wasn’t doing it on purpose, you know.”\nAmeobi: “John would say to me, ‘Show him who Shola is. He wants to see you for you’. He wanted me to come out of my shell, to prove that I belonged there. At the time, I was so frustrated, but I get it now. He knew exactly what he was doing.”\nSo many stories.\n“We played Barcelona at home, pre-season 2002,” Harper says. “They were unbelievable. We were 3-0 down after about 50 minutes and they were playing keep-ball. Shay was playing and Sir Bobby says to me, ‘Come on, Stevie son, get warmed up’. And I’m like, ‘What?’. ‘Come on, son, you’re going on’. And all I’m thinking is, ‘Ah, cheers Gaffer, we’re going to get hammered five or six, I’m going to get net rash and that’s all anybody will remember’.\n“So I’m standing there waiting to go on, feeling all nervous and thinking, ‘I’ll snap your hands off for a 4-0 here’, Shay is coming off, furious, and I hear another shout. ‘Stevie!’, and I turn around. Sir Bobby says, ‘Don’t let any more goals in son, we’re getting bloody murdered’. And my shoulders have started going and I’m laughing my head off’. He could always read the room. I needed it.”\nSir Bobby was sacked by Newcastle in late August 2004. “It was very painful and really unjust,” Harper says.\n“It was a really challenging moment,” Ameobi says. “He was the one manager that wasn’t just a manager to me. He was part of my family. Don’t get me wrong, we had our ups and downs, but it all came from a good place. I suppose I wondered how much damage it would do to pull him out like that. It was just brutal. His heart had been ripped out. I was gutted. I couldn’t understand it.”\nAdvertisement\nThe thing about Sir Bobby is that his stardust clung to you. He left, but he remained, in words and deeds, in his mannerisms and memory. “He’s just here,” Harper says, and he means it. “I think he’d like what we’re doing. It’s not a vanity project. I do it for the right reasons. I do it for the kids. Everything here is about having that black-and-white heartbeat. I hope he’d be proud of that.”\n“When you talk about building a winning and inclusive culture, that was always one of his strengths,” Ameobi says. “You would come into the training ground and he’d already be there, chatting to Liz in the canteen or one of the cleaners. He related to them in exactly the same way he related to the players. That’s one of the abiding things. It takes everyone. It’s come full circle with Eddie; everyone matters.”\nWe are back in the East Stand and the cold is drawing in. Burn is dredging his memory for the route of his matchday walk to St James’. “The first time I came, I completely fell in love with it,” he says. “Class.”\nHe adored the night-time games, the Champions League matches, like Juventus when Andy Griffin scored and this fella in front of him was going properly berserk, shouting, “I had a fiver on him!” and says Burn, “Everyone was buzzing, absolutely buzzing.” He remembers going home, shivering, his mam giving him a hot water bottle, “stupid things like that”.\nExcept they are not stupid. They are ties and bonds and links in a chain. They are the reason we did it and the reason we come back. They are Bobby and his dad, Stubbins and Shearer, Burn and Howe, Harper and Stoker and Ameobi. They are Wembley and yearning and pride and belonging. They are lives that touch our lives and live on inside us. They are who we are.\n“When we played the semi-final (against Southampton), I was out warming up, the place was bouncing and I was filling up,” Burn says. “I had to compose myself. That’s what I remember from being a kid, from watching Sir Bobby’s side. It brings it out of you. That’s what I love so much about it, that it can provoke those emotions sitting here watching it, never mind playing.\n“What’s happening now has got that feel about it, the Keegan teams, the Bobby teams, and when I allow myself to, I feel it. I know it’s going to be the same with the final. I know how big it is and I know I have to be professional. I was thinking about it driving in today. In some ways, I have a bit of disappointment because I’m not going to experience it like everyone else, like a fan. I want to be with my mates, my family, watching it.”\nAdvertisement\nOnly a bit, though. “To have the chance of playing at Wembley, in a final, and thinking about all those teams that didn’t quite get there and that we could be the team that does.” Burn’s voice drifts away. He is gazing at that hallowed stretch of grass beneath him, lost and in love. He snaps out of it. “I’m confident,” he says and perhaps there is a whisper from Sir Bobby, from these empty seats, from all those ghosts around us.\nYou can do it, son.
