  "body_text": "Brendan Rodgers has left his role as Celtic coach, ending his second spell in charge after a poor start to the season, with their former boss Martin O'Neill appointed interim manager.\n\"Brendan Rodgers has today tendered his resignation. It has been accepted by the Club and Brendan will leave his role with immediate effect,” Celtic said in a statement, Reuters reported.\nCeltic's largest individual shareholder Dermot Desmond then released a strongly worded message in which he accused Rodgers of publicly undermining the club despite being offered a contract extension and full backing only months ago.\nRodgers' exit comes amid mounting pressure over results, including a shock Champions League qualifying defeat by Kazakhstan’s Kairat Almaty in August and a 3-1 league loss at Hearts on Sunday that left Celtic trailing in the title race.\nIt marked the champions' second consecutive league defeat, keeping them second with 17 points, eight behind leaders Hearts.\nRodgers returned to Celtic Park in 2023 for his second stint, guiding the Glasgow side to back-to-back league titles.\nThe 52-year-old had also steered Celtic to domestic trebles during his first spell in 2017 and 2018.\n\"The Club appreciates Brendan's contribution to Celtic during his two very successful periods ...\" the team added.\n\"Brendan leaves Celtic with our thanks for the role he has played during a period of continued success for the Club and we wish him further success in the future.\"\nThe club said 73-year-old O’Neill and former Celtic player Shaun Maloney have agreed to take charge of the first team.\nO'Neill won the treble with Celtic in 2001 and guided them to a total of three Premiership titles and three Scottish Cup triumphs plus the UEFA Cup final in 2003.\nDESMOND SLAMS RODGERS\nDesmond said that when Celtic brought Rodgers back two years ago, it was done \"with complete trust and belief in his ability to lead the club into a new era of sustained success\".\n\"Unfortunately, his conduct and communication in recent months have not reflected that trust,\" he added.\n\"In June, both (chief executive) Michael Nicholson and I expressed to Brendan that we were keen to offer him a contract extension ... Yet in subsequent press conferences, Brendan implied that the club had made no commitment to offer him a contract. That was simply untrue.\"\nDesmond added Rodgers was given final say over all football matters and was backed in the recruitment process, with \"record investment in players he personally identified and approved\".\n\"Regrettably, his words and actions since then have been divisive, misleading, and self‐serving,\" Desmond added. \"They have contributed to a toxic atmosphere around the club and fuelled hostility towards members of the executive team and the Board.\"\nDesmond stressed that the club’s structure, \"where the manager oversees football, the Chief Executive manages operations, and the Board provides oversight\" had served Celtic well for more than two decades.",
