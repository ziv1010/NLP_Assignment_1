While no opponent was able to dribble past him, Yusuf won three tackles and one interception.\nThe man, who has been likened to Chelsea legend N’Golo Kante, created one big chance, made one key pass and completed two of two attempted crosses in the game.\nWith the numbers posted by Yusuf, the little-known 23-year-old midfielder became an instant hero back home despite the scathing criticisms launched at the team.\nOriginally not part of the Eagles’ final 25-man squad for the AFCON in Ivory Coast, the 23-year-old was lucky to make the team after a late injury to Wilfred Ndidi, which ruled the Leicester City midfielder out of the tournament.\nAs a player yet to don the Eagles jersey, the Antwerp man was called straight into action and was handed a start against the National Thunder as the three-time AFCON champions began their quest for a fourth title.\nWhile Nigeria failed to get the much-needed victory over Juan Micha’s men, who are ranked 18th in Africa, Yusuf put up a great performance that left many Nigerians singing his praises.\n“Indeed, he was my best player, very energetic and was everywhere,” CAF Champions League winner, Victor Ezeji, said of the Antwerp midfielder.\nWhile Equatorial Guinea’s goalkeeper, Jesús Owono, was voted Man of The Match, Kalu Emmanuel believes that Yusuf deserved the accolade.\n“Alhassan Yusuf, Man of The Match. So bad he got injured in the game,” he said.\nDisappointed with the game, Favour Azubuike reserved her praises for Yusuf.\n“The only impressive person to me was Alhassan Yusuf. He wasn’t invited initially but he made his mark in this game, he used his debut well.”\nAnawo Michael simply wrote, “Alhassan was fantastic.”\nYusuf was on the field for 69 minutes before he was stretched off after sustaining an injury to his thigh.\nFor a player who just made his debut, his injury raised so much fear among fans who were hoping that he would be fit in time for the Eagles’ second Group A game against Ivory Coast on Thursday.\nYusuf has however confirmed that he only suffered a cramp during the game against Equatorial Guinea.\n“My injury is just a cramp, we will see if I’ll be available against Ivory Coast,” he said.\nThe news came as big news for some fans.\nKaima wrote, “Thank God. This 23-year-old was bullying our opponents and schooling (Alex) Iwobi and co on how to play midfield football, he was exceptional. When he was taken out I was just praying we manage the score line till the final whistle.”\nAli_boja Alwaezyy added, “Thank God, our main hustle on the midfield, he doesn’t get tired. He must have played a lot of hide and seek while growing.”\nAlso pleased with the report, Talmudic Sage tweeted, “That’s good news. He was our best player today (Sunday) and we need him to be 100 per cent fit against CIV.”\n“I hope he stays fit because we need him. What a game he had before the injury scare,” Sir Uno wrote.\nWith a lot to play for on Thursday against the hosts, fans will hope that Yusuf can replicate his impressive debut display when both sides clash in one of the most highly anticipated group games of the AFCON.",
