This one was a mockup of an old Eminem album cover with the player centre stage and the velvet curtains drawn back.\n“The Sancho Show.”\n“Sancho’s back, tell a friend.”\nThe staged excitement continued with a clip released of the 23-year-old greeting some new and old teammates in the dressing room at the training ground. There was something almost poignant about him leaning into Marco Reus and burying his head in the German’s chest for a cuddle.\n“All smiles,” read the caption of another photo of Sancho in training.\n“We are happy that Jadon is finally with us. He had a lot of fun on the training pitch. He is healthy, he has trained a lot in the last few weeks. We will use the session again today and see how far he is,” Dortmund head coach Edin Terzić said on Friday.\nSancho is needed now if they are to qualify for the Champions League.\nSancho’s back, tell a friend 🎤 pic.twitter.com/g1LAgkMi3Y\n— Borussia Dortmund (@BlackYellow) January 11, 2024\nAfter losing the Bundesliga title on the final day of the 2022/23 season – when they had a two-point lead over Bayern Munich going into the last game but could only draw 2-2 at home to Mainz – the departure of Jude Bellingham to Real Madrid compounded their woes.\nDortmund are fifth now, have scored 30 goals in 16 games (the fewest of the top five) and are six points adrift of Red Bull Leipzig in fourth.\nThis is why they have brought Sancho in for the remainder of the season. It is a deal that will cost them a minimum of €3.5 million and see his estimated £200,000-a-week wages at United covered.\nNot a bad short-term fix for a player they sold for close to €80m in the summer of 2021.\nBut needs must for Dortmund and the question is whether their needs actually tally with a player who they have banked on delivering an upturn in results.\nDortmund are in a fight for points to climb up the table yet Sancho spoke about his happiness at the move so he can “play football with a smile on my face.”\nPerhaps the change of environment will be conducive to that but it feels as though these are two parties with wildly contrasting priorities.\nSancho is looking to find his rhythm again, understandably so given he has been training and even eating lunch alone at United’s training ground since August.\nThat falling out with Erik ten Hag, in which he refused to apologise for publicly contradicting the manager’s reasoning for being left out of a squad to face Arsenal and accused the Dutch boss of making him “a scapegoat for a long time” has proven insurmountable.\nSancho has not started a match since the FA Cup final defeat to Manchester City on 3 June.\nThe last time he played a full 90 minutes was the week before in the last game of the 2022/23 Premier League season.\nDortmund will hope Sancho can keep smiling while still delivering on the pitch.\nWhat happens over the next five months could also prove to be a defining moment for Ten Hag and trust in his judgement.\nThe jury is already out, given he has had considerable say on a number of transfers that have flopped, but the Sancho situation could prove another form of vindication.\nIncidents of the England international’s lateness – also highlighted recently by Nemanja Matic – and poor performance in training have supported the view that Sancho’s character and professionalism are not of the required standard for a club that has been in disarray.\nThe belief that Ten Hag has at least been able to identify those that need to be rooted out is what most supporters have clung to.\nThe arrival of INEOS as minority stakeholders at Old Trafford adds another layer of complexity. Once their 25% deal is ratified by the Premier League Jim Ratcliffe is to install trusted figures to reconfigure a failing football infrastructure. Some of that work has already begun.\nShould Sancho thrive in a different kind of environment and rediscover the form that excited so many before, it could lead to the first test of INEOS’ trust in Ten Hag given the player will have two years left on his deal and, in theory, will outlast a manager whose contract is up next summer.\nJust what path United are on could be determined by the fate of these two men at odds.",
