When the players are fit we can play good football. This was a very good performance against the best team in the world.\n“I think the criticism has been unfair. The team. Me as well. It was not right. We didn’t have the players. We have seen the same things, not always good football – definitely not – but we had to make compromises all the time and then you can’t play the football you want.\n“I had the full squad available maybe three or four times in two years. Even here we were missing massive players like Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw and Casemiro.”\n'If Man Utd don't want me, I'll win somewhere else'\n- Published25 May 2024\nGuardiola admits tactical 'mistake' in FA Cup final\n- Published25 May 2024\nAll fair points but undermined by a lack of strategy and control on too many occasions, and a Champions League campaign that was a wash-out, United not even getting out of the group stage.\nAnd United certainly flew by the seat of their pants as they took a scenic route to winning the FA Cup for the 13th time.\nThey lost a two-goal lead before beating League Two Newport County in the fourth round, secured a dramatic 4-3 win against Liverpool in the quarter-final with Amad Diallo’s goal in the last seconds of extra time, before avoiding serious embarrassment in the semi-final, giving up a 3-0 advantage to Championship side Coventry City.\nThis wonderful win over the four-time Premier League champions was almost routine in comparison but nothing must be taken away from Ten Hag’s masterly gameplan and organisation that brought them two goals to cherish in the first half.\nAnd the fact they were scored by teenagers Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo will bring added pleasure, if that is possible, to United, a club that has always cherished young talent.\nMainoo’s goal was a thing of beauty, Marcus Rashford’s perfect raking cross finding Garnacho, whose cross was met by the subtle touch and perfect vision of Bruno Fernandes.\nMainoo, at just 19, was voted player of the match with a display of consumate maturity and control, proving he has the temperament for the biggest occasion against the best opposition – which will be noted by England manager Gareth Southgate ahead of Euro 2024.\nYou could also see how much it meant to Rashford after a miserable week in which his decline this season was underlined by Southgate's decision to axe the forward from England's 33-man provisional squad for the tournament in Germany.\nRashford was in tears during United's celebrations with their fans after the FA Cup was presented.\nSo where does all this leave Ten Hag?\nTaken in the round, this had been a poor season up to this point, until the glorious salvation and redemption in this unlikely triumph that brings Europa League football to Old Trafford next season.\nOne side of the ledger he can point to two trophies in two seasons, the FA Cup and last season’s Carabao Cup, in an era of huge domestic domination by Manchester City.\nTen Hag has also had to work within a flawed structure with desperately poor recruitment (some of it made by him) which Ratcliffe, long-time cohort Sir Dave Brailsford, chief executive Omar Berrada and sporting director Dan Ashworth, when he finally arrives at Old Trafford, are trying to cure.\nWill Ratcliffe feel Ten Hag might operate better within that new structure or will the lingering belief that his mind is made up, irrespective of United pulling off this stunning FA Cup win, prove to be correct?\nThe problem for the manager lies elsewhere, with so much of this season locked in a decline with a team lacking any obvious plan or identity, resulting in nine home losses and the concession of a club record 58 league goals.\nGuardiola, who worked with Ten Hag at Bayern Munich, backed his old colleague: “He’s a lovely person and an extraordinary manager.”\nTen Hag was certainly extraordinary on this day but this has been the exception rather than the rule. Whether it will be enough to save him remains to be seen, and remains in doubt.\nFor now, however, Ten Hag deserves to enjoy the glorious success he fashioned free of those worries - for one night at least.\nThe long-term future for him and Manchester United will be clear soon enough.\nRelated topics\n- Published26 July 2022",
