They would get even better if they do make it into the Champions League, too.”\nThe feel-good factor is already back\n“The last time they were there, in 2002-03, I was a Newcastle player under Sir Bobby Robson and the whole city was buzzing, not just the club.\n“The same thing is happening now, and it has been like this for the past few months. Wherever you go and whoever you speak too, the feeling with the fans is back to what it was like under Kevin Keegan or Sir Bobby – it is a happy football club again, something it had not been for such a long time.\n“Howe deserves great credit for making that happen, and a top-four finish would help him continue the amazing progress he has already made.\n“Champions League football would help with everything, from attracting bigger and better players to being able to pay for them without worrying about breaking any Financial Fair Play rules.\n“More than anything, though, it would mean so much to the Newcastle supporters.\n“The mood in the city would just be ecstatic and I don’t think many people would disagree with me when I say that if any fans deserve a little bit of success, it is them – they have been starved of it for far too long.”\nNewcastle won’t want this season to end\n“From front to back, Newcastle have been great to watch in every department, right through the team.\n“They still have the best defensive record in the Premier League this season, with just 27 goals conceded in 33 games but, as well as being solid, they have so much creativity and they are scoring lots of goals.\n“We saw that attacking flair make the difference again against Southampton on Sunday, thanks to another good decision by Howe, when his side were trailing 1-0 at half-time.\n“Some of the usual top-four contenders like Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham have all under-achieved this season but that takes nothing away from Newcastle – they are doing well enough to qualify for the Champions League anyway.\n“Another victory would see them already surpass the points total reached by Chelsea when they finished fourth in 2019-20 and 2020-21. Two more wins would take them to 71 points and no team has got that many without making the Champions League places since Arsenal in 2017.\n“The only real blip came in February when they lost the Carabao Cup final after a couple of league results did not go their way.\n“A few injuries and suspensions seemed to be taking their toll and the team lost some of its spark, but they responded with a run of five straight wins to get back on track.\n“It was the same story after they lost at Aston Villa a few weeks ago. That’s the only time they have really been battered this season but they reacted to that by coming back looking stronger than ever.\n“Newcastle don’t fear anyone, and when Arsenal come to St James’ Park next Sunday, the place will be rocking. The Toon players must be loving that – I know I did – walking out there, into that atmosphere.\n“Isak’s form is incredible when you consider this is his first season in the Premier League and he was sidelined for the early part of it.\n“I was there at Anfield in August, when he scored against Liverpool on his debut, but he suffered a thigh injury a couple of weeks later and did not start another league game until February.\n“It must have been very a frustrating period, but just look at him now. At the moment, Isak is close to being unplayable when he is on the left, which is where he moved to against Saints when Callum came on.\n“But Howe has other options there, like Joelinton, who has been unbelievable this season and scored some crucial goals. It shows how much depth Howe has got in his squad now, and there is plenty of quality as well.\n“It’s been a long time since that has been the case at Newcastle and, if Champions League football does arrive, you’d have to think there will be more exciting additions in the summer too.”\nStats from BBC Sport:\nNewcastle 3 Southampton 1 – Sunday 30 April 2pm\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nWilson 54, 81, Walcott OG 79,\nSouthampton:\nArmstrong 41\n(In brackets the half-time stats)\nPossession was Southampton 35% (37%) Newcastle 65% (63%)\nTotal shots were Southampton 4 (4) Newcastle 22 (5)\nShots on target were Southampton 3 (3) Newcastle 5 (0)\nCorners were Southampton 2 (1) Newcastle 11 (3)\nReferee: Anthony Taylor\nNewcastle United:\nPope, Trippier, Schar, Botman, Burn, Bruno, Joelinton, Gordon (Wilson 45), Murphy (Almiron 69), Willock (Anderson 90+2), Isak (Ritchie 90+2)\nUnused Subs:\nDubravka, Dummett, Lewis, Targett, Manquillo\n(Newcastle 3 Southampton 1 – The instant NUFC fan / writer reaction – Read HERE)\n(Bruno Guimaraes gets emotional after final whistle – Newcastle United make it 8 wins from 9 – Go HERE)\n(Newcastle 3 Southampton 1 – Superb comeback win takes United to brink of Champions League football – Read HERE)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
