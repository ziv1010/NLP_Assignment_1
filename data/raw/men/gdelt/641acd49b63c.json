What are the possible line-ups? All you need to know about the UEFA Women's Champions League quarter-final second leg between Chelsea and Lyon.\nArticle top media content\nArticle body\nChelsea and Lyon meet in their UEFA Women's Champions League quarter-final second leg on Thursday 30 March at Stamford Bridge.\nChelsea vs Lyon at a glance\nWhen: Thursday 30 March (21:00 CET kick-off)\nWhere: Stamford Bridge, London\nWhat: UEFA Women's Champions League quarter-final second leg\nHow to follow / Where to watch: Build-up and live stream from DAZN can be found here\nSemi-final: vs Barcelona (22/23 & 29/30 April)\nWhat do you need to know?\nHaving lost for the first time in the 19 home opening legs they have played in this competition – Guro Reiten giving Chelsea the advantage at OL Stadium – Lyon now hope to avoid their first elimination at an away ground since departing the 2008/09 semi-finals at Duisburg.\nThey have won in London already this season, 1-0 at Arsenal in the group stage, and that is their minimum requirement if their eighth title defence is not to end at Stamford Bridge.\nThere was an extra boost on Saturday as Ada Hegerberg came off the bench against Guingamp, having been an unused substitute in the first leg in her first selection since injury in early September. The Norwegian forward immediately scored with the first touch of her latest comeback, while Amel Majri also started for the first time since maternity leave.\nChelsea showed their ability to soak up pressure and counter effectively in the first leg, leaving them well placed to avenge their 2018/19 semi-final exit to Lyon. However, injury on the day to central defender Millie Bright was a concern, increased on Sunday when Erin Cuthbert – so impressive in the first leg – limped off in the 2-0 defeat at Manchester City that cost Chelsea their Women's Super League lead. Manager Emma Hayes suggested that Cuthbert would be \"fine\" but Bright did not train on Wednesday, but is not ruled out.\nForm guide\nChelsea\nLast six games (most recent result first): LWWWWL\nLast match: Man City 2-0 Chelsea, 26/03\nWhere they stand: 3rd in Women's Super League, FA Cup semi-finals\nLyon\nLast six games (most recent result first): WLWWWW\nLast match: Lyon 6-0 Guingamp, 25/03\nWhere they stand: 1st in Division 1 Féminine, French Cup final\nWhere to watch\nEvery game in this season's UEFA Women's Champions League from the group stage onwards is broadcast live in most territories on streaming platform DAZN, together with YouTube.

Their record speaks for itself but it's important for us as a team to be impose ourselves and be aggressive at the right moments, be positive in everything we do on and off the ball.\n\"We know what to expect. It's the champions of Europe over a long period of time and it's not for no good reason. They are not used to being in this position. We want these situations and be in a position where we can impose ourselves and our game in our stadium.\"\nMagdalena Eriksson, Chelsea captain: \"We know that there is 90 minutes left to go, could be more, and we have to be switched on right from the start.\n\"It's going to be a great challenge. Almost on a weekly basis we play against the best strikers in the world so we are prepared for it as a team, but we also have to go out and do it and show the Chelsea mentality we know we have as a group.\"\nSonia Bompastor, Lyon coach: \"With Lyon we are used to difficult situations. OL have been performing at the highest level for years. We have the best track record in women's football. Last year when we got to the Champions League final, we said that Barcelona were big favorites but we managed to reverse the situation. We are still focused because we know that there is the possibility of qualifying.\n\"We know the importance of Ada in a squad, she is a leader, a scorer. When she is there she brings a lot of confidence to the team. She is delighted to have been able to score for her comeback, it gives her a lot of confidence.\"\nDamaris Egurrola, Lyon midfielder: \"We know what we did well and less well in the previous game. We know what needs to be corrected. We don't have to change much because we have a good team. The first leg was not enough but we will improve some things tomorrow night.\"\nAda Hegerberg, Lyon forward: \"We have a big game to prepare for. We know that we have to show something different to the first leg. We will do everything to be ready; we don't want to lose in the Champions League quarter-finals.\"\nWhere is the 2023 UEFA Women's Champions League final being played?\nEindhoven's PSV Stadium will stage the 2023 UEFA Women's Champions League final at 16:00 CET on Saturday 3 June.\nFirst opened in 1910, the 35,000-capacity PSV Stadium has a long history of hosting major matches, including the UEFA Cup finals of 1978 (second leg) and 2006, the second leg of the 1988 UEFA Super Cup and three games at UEFA EURO 2000.\nOn 6 April 2018, 30,238 fans at the home of PSV Eindhoven watched the Netherlands beat Northern Ireland on the way to the FIFA Women's World Cup, a record crowd for any UEFA-organised women's qualifier.
