  "body_text": "The Dallas Cowboys make the trek to the Mile High City in Week 8 of the NFL season to face a surging Denver Broncos team that features one of the league’s best defenses. The game is scheduled to start at 4:25 p.m. ET (2:25 p.m. MT) with TV coverage on CBS and streaming on-demand.\nHow to watch Cowboys vs. Broncos on TV and stream without cable:\n- When: Sunday, Oct. 26 at 4:25 p.m. ET (2:25 p.m. MT)\n- Where: Mile High Stadium, Denver, Colo.\n- TV channel: CBS\n- Streaming on: FuboTV (free trial) | DirecTV (free trial) | Paramount+ (free trial)\nCowboys vs. Broncos: The matchup\nThe Cowboys offense has been a pleasant surprise in the face of a backfield overhaul and the early loss of top wide receiver CeeDee Lamb to injury, leading the NFL in total yardage (390.6 ypg) and ranking second in passing (268.4 ypg) and scoring (31.7 ppg) through seven full weeks. The team has gone 2-1-1 over its past four games, scoring 27-plus points in all of them, highlighted by last week’s 44-22 division win over the Washington Commanders. Lamb returned to the lineup with 110 yards and a touchdown as quarterback Dak Prescott threw for 264 yards and three scores, but Dallas struck a balance with Javonte Williams rushing for 116 yards and a TD.\nThe Broncos are 3-0 at Mile High Stadium this season and they enter the contest on a four-game win streak while showing an ability to win close-and-late games at a high level. There was perhaps no better demonstration of that prowess than last weekend, when they overcame a 19-0 fourth-quarter deficit to stun the New York Giants (33-32) on a Will Lutz 39-yard field goal as time expired. Held scoreless for 45-plus minutes, Bo Nix led an attack that put up 33 over the final 14:08 and mounted a winning response when the Giants took a 32-30 lead with 0:37 remaining.\nCowboys vs. Broncos: Know your live streams\nFuboTV (free trial) - FuboTV scores high marks for viewer experience with a huge library of live sports; the monthly rate after trial starts at $54.99 with a $30 off promotion.
