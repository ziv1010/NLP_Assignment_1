  "body_text": "Mikel Arteta believes Aston Villa can be considered Premier League title contenders ahead of their big clash against Arsenal on Saturday.\nArsenal have the chance to move eight points clear at the top of the table when they travel to Villa Park but face one of the trickiest tests of the season so far.\nAfter a poor start to the campaign, Unai Emery’s side look more like their old self, winning seven of the last eight games across all competitions.\nThis includes a 1-0 victory over Manchester City and Wednesday night’s 4-3 comeback win at Brighton, a result that has lifted the Villans to third in the table.\nAfter 14 games, many believe the title race is between Arsenal, City and Chelsea, but Villa have quietly moved to within just six points of the Gunners, and are only a point behind the Citizens.\nAsked in his pre-match press conference if he thought Villa were title challengers, Arteta replied: ‘Well, if they continue where they are already, so if they continue what they’ve been doing, I think any club, any team in that position has chances for sure.\n‘For what they’ve been doing, the way they’ve been playing and winning matches, certainly it’s a team that is in great form and we know that.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

We have to focus on performing, preparing really well for tomorrow, we know the kind of game that we’re going to play and be ready for it to fulfil our potential.’\nEmery has worked wonders since replacing Steven Gerrard in the Villa dugout in 2022, consistently qualifying the club for Europe and reaching the Champions League quarter-finals last season.\nAre Aston Villa title contenders?\n-\nYes\n-\nNo\nIt has proven to be somewhat of a redemption arc for the Spanish manager who was sacked by Arsenal in 2019, just 18 months after being given the unenviable job of replacing club legend Arsene Wenger.\nMore Trending\nArteta, who replaced Emery at the Emirates, said he wasn’t sure if this fixture provided ‘extra motivation’ for his predecessor.\n‘I think when you look at Unai, his career, his motivation level, everywhere he’s had an impact, it’s all been remarkable,’ he added.\n‘So I don’t know, that’s a question for him. But in my opinion, he never needs anything extra. I think he’s good enough in himself.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Mikel Arteta told to drop Arsenal star for Aston Villa Premier League clash\nMORE: Enzo Maresca shares ‘regret’ over Chelsea star ahead of Bournemouth clash\nMORE: ‘Enough is enough’ – Paul Scholes lashes out at Ruben Amorim for ‘ruining’ Man Utd star",
