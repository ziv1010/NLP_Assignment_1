Ideally it would have ended a draw but fact remains that Klopp’s team have only five games left and are nine points behind NUFC, plus Newcastle with an 11 goals advantage on GD.\nStats from BBC Sport:\nNewcastle 3 Southampton 1 – Sunday 30 April 2pm\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nWilson 54, 81, Walcott OG 79,\nSouthampton:\nArmstrong 41\n(In brackets the half-time stats)\nPossession was Southampton 35% (37%) Newcastle 65% (63%)\nTotal shots were Southampton 4 (4) Newcastle 22 (5)\nShots on target were Southampton 3 (3) Newcastle 5 (0)\nCorners were Southampton 2 (1) Newcastle 11 (3)\nReferee: Anthony Taylor\nNewcastle United:\nPope, Trippier, Schar, Botman, Burn, Bruno, Joelinton, Gordon (Wilson 45), Murphy (Almiron 69), Willock (Anderson 90+2), Isak (Ritchie 90+2)\nUnused Subs:\nDubravka, Dummett, Lewis, Targett, Manquillo\n(Newcastle 3 Southampton 1 – The instant NUFC fan / writer reaction – Read HERE)\n(Bruno Guimaraes gets emotional after final whistle – Newcastle United make it 8 wins from 9 – Go HERE)\n(Newcastle 3 Southampton 1 – Superb comeback win takes United to brink of Champions League football – Read HERE)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
