  "body_text": "Rio Ferdinand singled out Casemiro for praise during Manchester United’s 3-0 win over ten-man Athletic Bilbao, applauding the midfielder for ‘coming to the fore’ when his club needed him most in the Europa League semi-final first leg.\nCasemiro headed home on the half-hour mark after some superb wing-play from an unlikely source in Harry Maguire to break the deadlock at a shellshocked San Mames Barria.\nThe visitors were much the better side in the first half and deservedly doubled their lead just seven minutes later, with Bruno Fernandes converting from the penalty spot after Dani Vivian’s sending off for a foul on Rasmus Hojlund.\nFernandes finished cooly past Julen Agirrezabala to grab his second of the evening – and seventh in this year’s competition – on the stroke of half-time, capping off a dream opening 45 minutes for Ruben Amorim’s men.\nThe Red Devils held firm in the second period to come away from Bilbao with an imperious three-goal advantage and put one foot in the final ahead of next week’s return leg at Old Trafford.\nCasemiro has blown hot and cold across his three-year spell with United but Ferdinand waxed lyrical about the Brazilian’s display, in what was his 112th game in European football.\n‘I don’t think Casemiro has put a foot wrong. He’s been sensational tonight. He has been so disciplined,’ the legendary ex-United and England centre-back said on TNT Sports’ commentary during the second half.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

But he’s more facing the game now, he knows what he’s doing.\n‘Instead of playing through him, where he’s taking lots of touches, I think he’s facing the right way more times than not now.’\nFerdinand agreed with Savage and argued that the greater ‘support’ Casemiro had received left the midfielder far less ‘exposed’ in the middle of the park.\n‘I totally agree with you, Robbie, about facing the game,’ he responded.\n‘They’re not trying to play through him like a pivot where he’s got his back to things and he can pressed and lose the ball. That’s not his game.\n‘This makes it simpler for him but, also, they’re allowing big spaces around him where he would be exposed physically.\n‘He’s got that support behind and communication.’\nMore Trending\nThough understandably pleased with United’s showing, Casemiro was keen to remind his team-mates that it was still only half-time in the tie.\nAsked whether a stunning comeback was beyond Athletic Bilbao, Casemiro told Movistar+: ‘No, of course not.\n‘I give that message as it is not over. I know this Athletic Bilbao team very well, I know there have great players.\n‘We have to show a lot of respect and I ask on behalf of Manchester and everyone that we have to have respect them as an opponent because they never give up.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Ruben Amorim names two ‘nervous’ Man Utd stars who needed help against Athletic Bilbao\nMORE: Athletic Bilbao star Williams hits out at referee and sends clear warning to Man Utd\nMORE: Paul Scholes pinpoints where ‘sloppy’ Man Utd must improve despite huge Europa League win",
