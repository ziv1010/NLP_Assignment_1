Marcelo Bielsa doesn’t do press conferences by halves. Yesterday, he called himself “toxic”, “robotic” and a “generator of tension”. But the under-pressure Uruguay boss isn’t quitting.\nComing up:\n⏰ Bielsa’s 105-minute showdown\n🤯 Inside Jamaica World Cup turmoil\n🍫 Birmingham’s Willy Wonka stadium?\n🇺🇸 Muller versus Son\nAdvertisement\nVintage Bielsa\nBreaking down the Uruguay manager’s astonishing press conference\nI know from experience that Marcelo Bielsa’s press conferences demand a high level of stamina, from him and the journalists present. His introduction at Leeds United in 2018 ran for almost 80 minutes — so long that at one stage, Bielsa turned and asked his English translator if he wanted to take a break.\nThe Argentinian also has a track record of scheduling briefings out of the blue in times of tension and without much warning about what he intends to say. So it went last night in Uruguay, where cracks are showing in his reign as national-team coach. Bielsa summoned the media in the wake of a grim 5-1 defeat against the United States on Tuesday. The obvious question was whether he planned to resign.\nHe didn’t quit, but what ensued was an edge-of-your-seat, 105-minute exchange, in which Bielsa was Bielsa: animated, self-flagellating and passionately introspective. Felipe Cardenas watched the whole event play out for The Athletic and it was hard — nay, impossible — by the end of Felipe’s dissection to predict with confidence whether Bielsa has any chance of bringing the crisis to heel.\nUruguay did qualify for next year’s World Cup with limited fuss, so it might seem strange that Bielsa is fighting for his job. But the aura he gave them early on after his 2023 appointment has vanished. Results are deteriorating and recent games have been dogged by a shortage of goals and loud murmurings of discontent in the dressing room. Some reporters in the South American country are calling for Bielsa’s dismissal.\nInternal tensions were laid bare in October by Luis Suarez — a forward Bielsa dispensed with — attacking the culture of the 70-year-old’s regime. More striking again was Uruguay’s current captain, Federico Valverde, backing up Suarez’s comments. Bielsa isn’t walking away, and his eyes are on the World Cup in June. It appears the Uruguay Football Association will stick with him. But can Bielsa punch his way out of a tight corner?\nAdvertisement\n‘I’m toxic. Don’t think I enjoy it’\nAcross an hour and 45 minutes in Montevideo on Thursday, Bielsa — renowned as being highly intense and distant from players on a personal level — made no attempt to absolve himself of blame. Here are some of his more remarkable quotes:\n🗣️ “I’m a generator of tension. When I arrive, the environment becomes tense. That’s why I appear infrequently. I am shy, obsessive, I’m a robotic person. I don’t like clutter. Those are my flaws. I find it difficult to act free-spirited and friendly.”\n🗣️ “I’m toxic. To associate yourself with me makes you worse off. Do you understand me? There are toxic types who only see the errors that they are correcting, who are demanding, who are never satisfied with anything. Don’t think I enjoy it. For me, it’s karma.”\n🗣️ On Suarez’s criticism: “I never responded to each of the claims he gave, but I did talk about it internally with the players. All that passed. I don’t hold a grudge or seek revenge.”\nThere were references to false teeth, Brad Pitt, tomatoes, garages and tango singing. Reporters fired back at him. You really have to read Felipe’s analysis to get a feel for the electricity in the room, and the scale of the task in front of Bielsa. Eighteen months ago, you’d have gladly avoided Uruguay in the World Cup draw that is now only two weeks away. As it is, none of the confirmed qualifiers stand on thinner ice.\nNews round-up 🗞️\n- Alejandro Dominguez, the president of South America’s ruling body CONMEBOL, isn’t giving up on his dream of the 2030 World Cup being a 64-team event, up from the 48 in 2026 and double the 32 of 2022. He’s banging the drum for a one-off expansion again.\n- Writing in her autobiography, Australia international and Manchester City forward Mary Fowler claims she was the victim of racism at Montpellier and given bananas instead of flowers when she left the French club in 2022. Montpellier deny the allegations, saying “no evidence has been found”.\n- Napoli’s owner and president Aurelio De Laurentiis and chief executive Andrea Chiavelli will stand trial in Italy over alleged false accounting. Among other things, an investigation into the Serie A club’s finances focused on striker Victor Osimhen’s £62.8m ($82.2m at the current rate) transfer from France’s Lille in 2020. Napoli and De Laurentiis deny any wrongdoing.\n- Paramount+ has picked up the majority of the Champions League rights in the UK and Ireland from 2027 to 2031, with Sky Sports acquiring the same for UEFA’s Europa League and Conference League. The deals elbow out current rights-holder TNT Sports.\n- He’s been a bench player for them recently but Brentford won’t be helped by the loss of Fabio Carvalho to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. Surgery will end the 23-year-old’s season.\n- On the fitness front, no season would be complete without a random, suffered-at-home ailment. Cole Palmer has ticked that box: a fractured toe suffered in his house means the Chelsea playmaker will miss big games against Barcelona and Arsenal.\nJamaica’s crisis\nThey could still reach the World Cup, so why did McClaren resign?\nIt’s last-chance saloon time for those national teams still vying for a World Cup place. Yesterday brought us the draws for the European and inter-confederation play-offs in March, the put-up-or-shut-up stage of qualifying for the 2026 finals.\nJamaica are in the mix, paired with Pacific Islanders New Caledonia in a semi-final, and the presence of the Reggae Boyz might come as a surprise — because on Tuesday evening, head coach Steve McClaren quit.\nAdvertisement\nWhy did he walk away when qualification was still within his grasp? Well, for several reasons, all of them outlined expertly by Laurie Whitwell. Jamaica were beaten (slightly embarrassingly) by tiny Curacao to an automatic spot, and McClaren (above left, with Jamaica player Bobby De Cordova-Reid) thinks his exit will clear the air before those play-offs. He also needs fairly major surgery on a painful, arthritic ankle and is due to undergo treatment soon.\nBut dysfunction within Jamaica’s national setup was another factor — we’re at the point in qualification where inadequacies are always laid bare: see Nigeria. There were quibbles over airline travel for the players and McClaren had to foot the bill for standard expenses, including the cost of a goalkeeping coach’s flights and hotel.\nJamaican fans derided his tactics as low-energy and he decided they’d be best off without him. We’ll watch with interest to see if they avoid spilling their pint in March.\nMark of champions?\nDon’t worry, Liverpool – title defences in the Premier League rarely go to plan\nLiverpool’s Premier League season has been keeping them up at night. Their title defence has the faintest of heartbeats and at face value, it’s pretty mystifying. In reality, it’s bang on trend.\nEnglish champions, it turns out, don’t often turn one sensational year into another. They might retain the trophy, sure, but Oli Kay’s research showed how downturns are standard. To put it simply, in only seven Premier League seasons going back to its debut in 1992-93 did the winners improve their points tally in the following campaign. Chelsea’s 2014-15 champions and Leicester City, 12 months later, both went backwards by a shocking margin of 37 points (above).\nForm at Anfield is one of the key points of interest as domestic football picks up where it left off this weekend. Another is Erling Haaland’s attempt to beat the Premier League’s record for goals in a single season — set by him when he scored 36 in 2022-23. I’m thinking he’ll do it because he’s up to 14 already but as Carl Anka says, it’s funny how casually we muse about a striker producing a goal a game or better in a league so competitive. The man just isn’t human (Erling, not Carl).\nAround TAFC 🔄\n-\nVancouver Whitecaps versus LAFC on Saturday night means Thomas Muller versus Son Heung-min (or joker versus joker). That should have us all tuning in. The MLS Cup play-offs are about to get real.\n- The next European transfer window is just over a month away, and a prospect to follow is Kees Smit, a 19-year-old Dutch midfielder at AZ. He’s interesting some big clubs, and Conor O’Neill has profiled him this morning.\n- A lot of Fantasy Premier League players will have Gabriel in their line-ups. Holly Shand has the best tips on how to deal with the Arsenal defender’s injury layoff.\n- Quiz question: Scotland, Austria and Norway have reached the World Cup for the first time since 1998. That leaves five current UEFA-registered countries who have played in a World Cup before but are yet to qualify for one in the 21st century. Can you name them?

Buckingham Palace it ain’t. But the only thing the six-chimney design — sorry, the “modern-day accessible coliseum” (above) — made me think of was Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory.\nSome would call it pure imagination. Others, not so much.",
