While Man Utd are aiming to finish in the top four of the Premier League table this season, Madrid, under new manager Xabi Alonso, are determined to reclaim LaLiga and the Champions League crowns.\nDiego Leon, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko are the four major signings that Man Utd have made this summer, while Dean Huijsen, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Franco Mastantuono and Alvaro Carreras are the four new players in Alonso’s Madrid squad.\nFor Carreras, it was a return to the club that he left in 2020 for Man Utd, believing that he would have a better chance of succeeding at the Premier League giants than at the Santiago Bernabeu.\nWhile the 22-year-old left-back did well for the Man Utd youth teams, the club, especially then manager Ten Hag, did not think that he was ready for the senior side.\nAfter successful loan spells at Preston North End, Granada and Benfica, Carreras joined the Portuguese giants on a permanent basis in the summer of 2024 for €6million (£5.2m, $7m), with Man Utd inserting a 15 per cent sell-on clause, along with a buy-back option, into the deal.\nMadrid snapped up their former youth player for €50m (£43m, $58.3m) earlier this summer, with the Spanish left-back making his debut in the pre-season friendly match against WSG Tirol.\nCarreras played 62 minutes and impressed, with Defensa Central reporting that Man Utd are already regretting their decision to let the youngster leave.\n‘Manchester United in turmoil over gifting Carreras to Real Madrid’, reads the headline in the report, which has noted that ‘Alvaro Carreras is making waves, and United are starting to regret it’.\nThe report has noted that Man Utd did not exercise the buy-back clause that they had, adding that ‘some important Red Devils figures are already regretting not having backed the star’.\nThis is just one of many ‘poor decisions’ that Man Utd have made, claims the report.\nIN-DEPTH 🔴⚫ Ranking all Premier League clubs by transfer net spend in 2025: Man Utd four places above Liverpool…\nMan Utd made ‘inexplicable’ decision on Alvaro Carreras\nWhile one would expect the Real Madrid-centric media to praise the signing made by the Spanish club, one should note that over in England, too, Man Utd have been criticised for not seeing Carreras’s quality and potential when they had him on their books.\nOn July 16, The Manchester Evening News noted that among the ‘inexplicable decisions’ that Ten Hag made during his time as Man Utd manager was to ‘overlook’ Carreras.\nIn the aftermath of the 22-year-old Spanish left-back making the move to Madrid, the local Manchester media reported that Ten Hag did not deem Carreras ‘worthy of a senior debut’ for the Man Utd first team.\nRalf Rangnick included the youngster in his Premier League squad for four matches when he was in charge of Man Utd, but the left-back did not make it to the pitch.\nMan Utd signed Sergio Reguilon on loan from Tottenham Hotspur on September 1, and on the same day, Carreras joined Granada on loan.\nIt was a clear indication to Carreras that Man Utd did not think that he was ready for the first team, a stance that the left-back crictised in The Athletic in December 2023.\nCarreras said: “What message did United give me? That I should go out on loan, that Ten Hag didn’t count on me, that I should continue to gain experience, rhythm, and we’ll see what happens in the future.\n“But it’s clear that football doesn’t end at any club and that you have to keep working. My main objective is to return to United and make a place for myself there.”\nWhile Carreras may not be part of Man Utd’s future, the Red Devils have high hopes for left-backs Patrick Dorgu and Leon, who are 20 and 18, respectively.\nWhile Dorgu joined Man Utd from Lecce in the middle of last season, Leon has teamed up with manager Ruben Amorim’s squad this summer.\nLatest Man Utd news: Sancho escape route, Garnacho breakthrough\nMan Utd winger Jadon Sancho has been made aware of an escape route, with the Englishman himself ready to switch to the European club before the summer transfer window closes.\nA report has revealed that Man Utd made a late move to hijack a Liverpool deal, but the Premier League champions have managed to thwart the Red Devils’ attempt.\nTEAMtalk’s transfer correspondent, Rudy Galetti, has reported the latest on Chelsea’s quest to sign Alejandro Garnacho from Man Utd this summer, as a huge breakthrough has been reached.",
