It eluded the great Gabriel Batistuta and Rui Costa side of 1999 when Edmundo abandoned a title challenge to go party at the Rio Carnival. Then there was 2016, a mirage all too fleeting and too quickly forgotten when Paulo Sousa surprised everyone, if only for a few months, with an innovative team that succeeded in making Nikola Kalinic look like Marco van Basten.\nNevertheless, Parks and Rec in Florence might still need a few more signs.\nAdvertisement\nIn extra time of extra time, the 129th minute to be precise, Antonin Barak, the socks-down blondie from the Czech Republic, booked himself a ticket home. His last-gasp goal against a resilient Basel at St Jakob-Park meant Fiorentina will play West Ham United in Prague on June 7, a Conference League final that feels like a Tomas Repka testimonial. “I’m speechless,” Barak said. Only he wasn’t. “Last week after the defeat in the first leg, I was very relaxed about it. My team-mates were, too. Maybe a bit too relaxed.” But it was understandable enough.\n129TH MINUTE 🤯\nAntonín Barák scores at the death to send Fiorentina into the Europa Conference League final 🤪 pic.twitter.com/zifPH1aCvA\n— Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) May 18, 2023\nFiorentina had scored four times in each of their last three away games in the Conference League. They are the competition’s top scorers. As such, overturning a 2-1 deficit was not about to faze them. Nico Gonzalez saw to that. The Argentine missed the World Cup through injury, a bittersweet experience in light of his pivotal role in winning the Copa America with his country. Things could have got even worse had he joined Leicester City over the winter. Instead of scoring a double in a European semi-final, the second of which sent the game to extra time, he could have been staring into the abyss of relegation to the Championship.\n“We never gave up,” Gonzalez said. “We put our lives on the line.” He dedicated the win to the Fiorentina fan who fell ill and needed urgent medical attention in the away end, which had caused the game to be temporarily suspended. “I’m sending him a big hug,” Gonzalez said. “We’re thinking of him and his family.”\nIt was hard not to think of Davide Astori either, the Fiorentina captain who passed away in his sleep in 2018. For his former team-mates, Fiorentina’s skipper Cristiano Biraghi and Ricky Saponara, the No 13 is out of sight but never out of mind.\n“We’ve come this far. Now we have to bring home a trophy,” Biraghi said.\nFiorentina will get two cracks at winning something for the first time since 2001.\nAdvertisement\nNext week ( on May 24), they play Champions League finalists Inter Milan in the Coppa Italia final at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. It is their first appearance in it since 2014 and after beating Inter at San Siro six weeks ago, confidence is high. History has already been made in Europe. By reaching the Conference League final, Fiorentina will become the only team ever to feature in the final of UEFA’s four different competitions.\nIt is their first European final since 1990 when Celeste Pin called Juventus “thieves” live on television and Roberto Baggio’s sale to the Turin club sparked a riot. West Ham now await, a club Nikola Milenkovic, the towering Serb and set-piece wrecking ball considered moving to last summer before signing a five-year deal to stay in Tuscany. “The goal is to win the Conference League,” the centre-back declared at the press conference announcing his new contract. The goal is now within touching distance.\nIt is a proud moment for Fiorentina’s owner Rocco Commisso and his chief executive Joe Barone. They have railed against the establishment and bluntly called out Juventus and Inter for winning leagues without sustainable models like their own. The resistance they have faced has, at times, been fierce. But nights like those in Basel and Cremona (they beat Cremonese in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia) make it all worthwhile.\nNews of Juventus’ simultaneous exit in the Europa League semi-final in Seville will have caused some Florentines to uncork the best Sassicaia in the cellar. Commisso begrudgingly sold Dusan Vlahovic and Federico Chiesa to the old enemy for €120million (£104.3m; $129.5m), a huge amount that nevertheless failed to placate the ultras who found him no different from the other Fiorentina owners in the past who gave in and sold the team’s star players to Juventus.\nBut Commisso is entitled to feel he got the better end of those deals. “Lots of people criticised us and the papers were writing that the strikers we replaced Vlahovic with — Arthur Cabral and Luka Jovic — weren’t scoring. But it isn’t true. We paid €15m for one and nothing for the other and they have scored 20 goals in all competitions. Vlahovic, meanwhile, has scored 10 in Turin, two of which were penalties. That’s half what our strikers have scored. And we made €70m out of Vlahovic. The Cabral-Jovic deal has been excellent for us. Vlahovic’s deal has not been good for Juventus.” At least he scored in Seville on Thursday. Jovic, on the other hand, missed a number of sitters to wrap up the game earlier.\nAdvertisement\n“In the first 20 minutes, Basel caused us problems with Dan Ndoye,” Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Italiano said. “Then we took the initiative, missed some incredible chances and frankly I was already thinking about penalties.”\nIn the end, it did not come to that and Italiano once again underlined why he is the best up-and-coming coach in Italy. To think only five years ago he was working in semi-professional football with Vigontina San Paolo. Since then his rise has been irresistible. He led Trapani to promotion to the second division and Spezia to the top flight for the first time in their history.\nHe then kept them up against all odds. Last season, the German-born Sicilian made Fiorentina the league’s most-improved team, with a 22-point swing from the previous year. In a dramatic final day of the campaign, he qualified the Viola for Europe for the first time in five years. Now, 55 games into this season, they are in two finals, a feat that has understandably cost some points in Serie A.\nBut the strides Fiorentina have made are undeniable. Wherever Italiano has gone, he has raised the bar. The Viola play with the highest line in Serie A and concede the fewest shots. They press better than any other team with the exception of Napoli, which is why the pass completion rate of their opponents is the lowest in the league. Attacks are built out wide in a 4-3-3 with midfield runners like Giacomo Bonaventura filling the penalty area.\nBiraghi’s deliveries and Milenkovic’s height at set pieces make Fiorentina a challenge to defend against and if calcio italiano is really back, some of it is down to coaches like Italiano. “I’m happy to have reached a European final at the first attempt,” Italiano said. “If you’d asked me my preference out of Rome and Prague at the start of the season, I would have chosen Prague.”\nAnd all paths lead there now regardless of whether they are signposted in Florence or not.\n(Top photo: Luigi Rizzo/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images)",
