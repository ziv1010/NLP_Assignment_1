Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘We highlighted on Monday Night Football last week that Arsenal won a game when Liverpool lost and they’ve done exactly the same again right now.\n‘They’re in a great position. The only thing for Arsenal and the supporters, because they want the Premier League so much and it’s been so long for them, is that it almost feels like such a long wait until May.\n‘There’s a long way to go and things can go wrong, but right now, again I’ll reiterate it, the way the Premier League is this season in terms of long-throws, set-pieces, direct play, Arsenal are the best-equipped team to deal with that.’\nCarragher was critical of Palace attacker Yeremy Pino for giving away a ‘silly’ free-kick and gifting Arsenal a golden chance to score with yet another trademark set-piece.\n‘Don’t be giving away silly free-kicks if you come up against Arsenal!’ he added.\n‘We know the delivery is fantastic in Gabriel you’ve got someone who is really special at getting his head on it.\n‘It was a really silly foul on Bukayo Saka from Yeremy Pino. You don’t need to make the challenge there, he’s going away from goal, he’s about to pass the ball back.\n‘And then the delivery from Declan Rice is fantastic. They’ve got four giants at the back post but, again, it’s Gabriel and he does enough to make it difficult for [Ismaila] Sarr.\n‘That is what you call a fantastic finish from Eze. Eze didn’t have his best game today and it might have been a bit difficult for him, certainly mentally, coming up against his former team.’\nCarragher feels Arsenal are exceptionally well placed to get their hands on the Premier League trophy this term, thanks largely to their extraordinary dominance in set-piece situations.\n‘Where the Premier League is right now this season, it feels like we’re going to be talking about set-pieces a lot, every weekend and a lot on Monday Night Football,’ he went on.\n‘There is no team better in the league and primed to go on and win the Premier League if that’s where the league is going.\n‘I mentioned my own team in terms of Liverpool and they don’t seem to be able to cope.\n‘This Arsenal team has been built to cope in situations like this, in terms of the back four, the height of the team, the power that they get.\n‘For a long time, I’ve said that Mikel Arteta is trying to win the Premier League like a Jose Mourinho team… or, as we saw him in the stands today, a George Graham Arsenal team.\n‘There’s nothing wrong with that. The most important thing is winning and, right now, they look in a great position, certainly after the weekend’s results, to go on and win the Premier League.’\nPrior to Arsenal’s defeat of Palace, Carragher suggested that City’s talismanic striker, Haaland, was perhaps the biggest threat to the Gunners’ title hopes this year.\n‘Arsenal came into this season worried about Liverpool being the major obstacle to ending a 21-year title wait. Now their biggest fear might be Erling Haaland,’ the 2005 Champions League winner said.\n‘Where Arsenal have the best squad among the contenders and Liverpool must fix well-documented issues, Manchester City have the most influential player and dynamic attacker.\n‘The Norwegian is the biggest reason why Pep Guardiola’s side have a great chance of reclaiming their crown. Without him, City’s most realistic target would be finishing in the top four.’\nAccording to Carragher, Arteta now has the Premier League’s ‘most influential player’ at his disposal in Gabriel Magalhaes.\n‘I think he’s now the real leader in this team,’ Carragher explained.\n‘I think William Saliba is a fantastic player. I always felt that Gabriel was maybe the junior partner if you like.\n‘That’s changed for me now. I think Gabriel is a colossus at the back, he’s the leader for that team, he talks, he keeps Saliba in check at times in games.\nMore Trending\n‘We’ve seen him defensively but going forward at the other end, we’ve seen him on the goal, we’ve seen him hit the crossbar as well and this happens every game.\n‘He’s the best defender in the team that has the best defensive numbers and he’s the best attacker in terms of set-pieces going forward at the other end.\n‘That’s why, for me, right now, I think Gabriel is the most influential player in the Premier League.\n‘I think if Arsenal are to go on and win the Premier League, I know it’s early, but I think he will be on course to go on and win the PFA Player of the Year because there’s nobody more influential for Arsenal Football Club.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Alan Shearer reveals ‘huge advantage’ Arsenal have over Liverpool and Man City\nMORE: Arsenal striker Gabriel Jesus admits he is ‘interested’ in joining former club\nMORE: Man Utd make decision as Ruben Amorim asks to sign Barcelona star",
