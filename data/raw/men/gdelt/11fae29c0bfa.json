  "body_text": "Referee Ricardo de Burgos is set to play a central role in tonight’s Copa del Rey final between Barcelona and Real Madrid.\nThe build-up to tonight’s showpiece occasion has been dominated by Real’s criticism of the match officials which culminated in the reigning European champions issuing a statement in which they denied having any intention of boycotting the match.\nReal did brand comments made by the match officials ‘unacceptable’ after the De Burgos down in tears at a press conference.\nIn a strongly-worded statement, the reigning LaLiga champions suggested referee De Burgos and VAR Pablo Gonzalez Fuertes should be removed and blocked from officiating one of the biggest games of the season.\nWhy did Ricardo de Burgos cry?\nBilbao-born De Burgos Bengoetxea cried in front of the media as he revealed the pressure Real’s television channel has put referees under.\nThe 39-year-old is the latest in a line of officials to be criticised on Real Madrid TV this season.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nA video released this week pointed out the win percentages of Barca and Real when he has taken charge of their games, the fact he has never refereed in the Champions League or FIFA tournaments and his supposed mistakes.\nDe Burgos said ‘it’s not right what we are going through’ during an emotional press conference, while VAR Gonzalez Fuertes warned officials could take action over the broadcasts.\nReal seemingly boycotted their official media appointments on Friday before complaining of ‘clear and manifest animosity and hostility’ towards the club from referees.\nWhy Real Madrid complained about Ricardo de Burgos?\n‘Real Madrid CF considers the public statements made today by the referees designated for the Copa del Rey final to be unacceptable,’ read a statement on the club website.\n‘These protests, which have surprisingly focused attention on videos from a media outlet protected by freedom of expression, such as Real Madrid TV, deliberately carried out 24 hours earlier against one of the final’s participants, demonstrate, once again, the clear and manifest animosity and hostility of these referees toward Real Madrid.\n‘Even more surprising statements, in a threatening tone, alluding to the referees’ unity, were used to announce alleged measures or actions that fall far short of the principles of fairness, objectivity, and impartiality that should prevail just hours before a football event that captures the attention of hundreds of millions of people around the world.\n‘Given the seriousness of what happened, Real Madrid hopes that those responsible for the RFEF (Royal Spanish Football Federation) and the refereeing body will act accordingly, adopting the necessary measures to defend the prestige of the institutions they represent.’\nWhat have Barcelona said about the referee?\nIn February, Real wrote a formal letter of complaint to RFEF and Spain’s High Council for Sports saying Spanish refereeing was ‘rigged’ and ‘completely discredited’.\nMore Trending\nRFEF later highlighted referees’ concerns over abuse, citing the case of Jose Munuera Montero, who faced a backlash after issuing a red card to Madrid’s England international Jude Bellingham.\nBarcelona manager, Hansi Flick, meanwhile, said on Friday that action should be taken to protect referees.\n‘For me, it’s only a sport. It’s only a game. It’s only football… It is our responsibility to protect not only the players but all the people involved in the game,’ Flick said.\nMORE: Wojciech Szczesny fails ‘fight’ to quit smoking 10 years after Arsenal incident\nMORE: Gary Neville reveals who he wants to win Champions League ahead of Arsenal vs PSG clash\nMORE: Arsenal to progress?
