Second placed Liverpool's manager Jurgen Klopp is staring down his worst nightmare - the Merseyside derby with Everton at Goodison Park on the evening of Wednesday, April 24, followed by a match at West Ham on the Saturday lunchtime TV slot at 12.30pm on April 27.\nLeague leaders Arsenal also might not be too pleased as they're facing a pile-up of matches, while Tottenham will enjoy a whopping 15 days' rest before the North London derby on Sunday, April 28. Spurs' match with third-placed Manchester City on April 20 has been put on hold because Pep Guardiola's team have an FA Cup semi-final with Chelsea that weekend.\nREAD MORE: Man Utd face possible European ban under Ratcliffe as UEFA refuse to change club ownership rules\nREAD MORE: Everton set to begin financial charge hearing as they look to avoid points deduction\nBut instead of rescheduling Tottenham vs City for the following midweek, Guardiola's squad will play Brighton on Thursday, April 25. This gives Tottenham a full break from their game at Newcastle on April 13 until they play Arsenal at White Hart Lane.\nDuring those 15 days, Arsenal will face four crucial games with Aston Villa, Bayern Munich, Wolves and their rearranged game with Chelsea, while Spurs take it easy. The league table could be turned upside down as Tottenham's calendar also gives them an advantage over Villa, who are still fighting in the Europa Conference League.\nDo you think the fixture changes are unfair? Let us know in the comments section below.\nSky Sports is bringing you 500 live football games to watch, as well access to Cricket, Golf, F1, Boxing, NFL, NBA and more across eight dedicated channels. Sky Sports is the only way to watch all the action this year.\nOther clubs have questioned the \"integrity\" of the fixture list and its role in deciding the Premier League champs and top four, according to the Mirror. City might face a less challenging match against Brighton earlier than planned, rather than revisiting Tottenham a team they've struggled against until their recent FA Cup victory in January.\nThe scheduling is said to be in a mess due to game cancellations for the FA Cup and other competitions involving English clubs such as the Champions League, Europa League, and Europa Conference League. Interestingly, Tottenham's match with City doesn't have a new date yet, with the Premier League saying they always try to reschedule games as soon as possible.\nLiverpool are also battling a similar fixtures nightmare, and Klopp has been pushing to avoid Saturday lunchtime games after midweek European clashes. However, this doesn't apply to local matches.\nThey now have a Wednesday night game against Everton, followed by a Saturday lunchtime trip to West Ham, which will be broadcast live on TNT Sports. Premier League bosses are hesitant to schedule the Merseyside derby in the final week of the season with so much at stake, and Liverpool might still be in the Europa League.\nCity's journey to Tottenham is one of four games that are yet to be rescheduled, including Manchester United vs Newcastle, Chelsea vs Tottenham, and Brighton vs Chelsea. The Premier League has emphasised the policy is to rearrange games in date order, but there's no specific reason - either policy-wise or clash-wise - why City are playing Brighton first, rather than Tottenham.",
