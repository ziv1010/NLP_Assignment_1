It’s a good test, you get challenged and from such tests you get better.”\nUnited have made impressive strides under manager Ten Hag, who has overseen a dramatic change in culture and results in a short period of time.\nBarcelona head coach Xavi was full of praise of the Dutchman’s work in turning around a difficult situation – respect that was reciprocated by a fellow admirer of the late, great Johan Cruyff.\n“I think Barca is also a very difficult club and I think Barcelona is, in this moment, playing in this moment it’s best football in several years,” he said of Xavi, whose side are runaway LaLiga leaders.\n“But I think it’s in the mind of and inspiration of Johan Cruyff. You still feel it here.\n“You can see if you see the game of Barcelona, you see the way of play and that is the inspiration of Johan Cruyff.”\nAntony, Anthony Martial and Scott McTominay are absent from Ten Hag’s 21-man squad in Spain due to injury, keeping them out with Christian Eriksen and Donny Van De Beek.\nMarcel Sabitzer is suspended but Casemiro is available as his suspension only impacts domestic games, meaning he faces United’s initial summer midfield target on Thursday.\nThe pursuit of Frenkie De Jong was as protracted as it was well documented, but the Netherlands international ended up staying put rather than linking back up with his former Ajax boss.\n“I think we have a class in 2019 that was a team with a lot of fascination,” Ten Hag said.\n“He brings a lot of fascination and I think he develops in the years after here in Spain. He became even better.\n“He’s a fantastic player, playing out from the back, he always has time, so it was a pleasure to work with him.”\nAsked why De Jong could not be convinced to join United last summer, he said with a laugh: “I don’t know if we (did) want him!\n“No, but Frenkie is an incredible player and for every club in the whole world he will strengthen the squad because he has a unique quality.\n“If you can get him in your squad, your team will be stronger.”\nLisandro Martinez did join during United’s summer of change and the suspended defender will be missing on Thursday, meaning left-back Luke Shaw could be moved centrally.\n“We have many options, I think, in the squad to sort it out,” Ten Hag said.\n“We can use Luke as a full-back and as a centre-back. We have seen in the weekend he did both very well.\n“But we have in the centre half also very good other options and they also did well. We can choose by game what we prefer.”",
