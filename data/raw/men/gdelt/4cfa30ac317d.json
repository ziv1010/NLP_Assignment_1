  "body_text": "Back from international duty with Spain, David Raya is full of confidence going into Sunday’s huge clash at the top of the Premier League with Manchester City.\nThe 4.30pm kick-off at Etihad Stadium represents one of the toughest tests of our title-chasing campaign, but we’ve already proven how capable we are of overcoming the biggest challenges so far this season.\nManchester City have twice been beaten by us this season, once in the Community Shield final and then at Emirates Stadium in the Premier League.\n“It’s an odd week coming back from international duty to prepare for the game but we have to treat it as another game, an important one but we prepare for it,” David said at Sobha Realty Training Centre on Friday. “It’s Man City away and we have to focus on giving our best to try to get the three points.\n“We can beat anyone in the league, we’ve shown that. We showed that at home against them when we beat them 1-0 so there’s a strong belief we can do that.”\nRegardless of the outcome of Sunday’s match, there remains a long way to go in the end of season run-in, so the players won’t be getting too carried away.\n“We look at it as one more game,” David added. “The most important game is the next one. We have to think that we still have a long way until May so we have to focus on Sunday and try to be our best.”\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
