  "body_text": "Real Madrid legend Toni Kroos spoke on Romario’s YouTube channel and shared his thoughts on the current situation in the Spanish capital.\nKroos: “I’m positive that Xabi is a really good coach, he needs time”\n”The hardest thing as a coach is coaching Madrid, it’s not easy. Here if you win matches, no one is really happy, there are few teams like that. If you draw or lose, the club is not used to losing. They criticize you very quickly. The coach has little time. You can’t think about how you want to play in a year or two, you need results. I am positive that Xabi is very good and has the quality needed to coach Madrid. He already knows what Madrid means. He already knew this could happen. You have to give him time and stay calm, but this is difficult at Madrid,” he said.\nKroos also explained why he considers Real Madrid the most important stage of his football career.\n”The biggest club where I have played? That answer is very easy, Madrid. I was lucky to play in the best club in the world for 10 years. My time at Madrid was the most successful and where I felt most at home. We have had a lot of success. The club was like a big family. Those have been the best years as a footballer,” he added.\nKroos concluded the interview by picking the Champions League Final against Juventus as the best match he ever played and Cristiano Ronaldo as the best football player he played with.",
