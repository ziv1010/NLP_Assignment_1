The Dutchman has been backed in the transfer market as well, with a host of new signings arriving at Old Trafford.\nHere is how Man Utd could set up following the 2024 summer transfer window.\nGoalkeeper & defenders\nMan Utd spent big on Andre Onana last summer and it's a move that is still yet to pay significant dividends. The Cameroonian goalkeeper has been trusted for another campaign in Manchester but will need to eradicate the semi-regular gaffes that blighted his debut season at Old Trafford.\nThere has been significant change in the Man Utd backline, with injuries and a lack of quality causing Ten Hag issues there last season. Once he's fit, Luke Shaw will be the left-back the Dutch coach relies on in 2024/25, but the England international is currently injured again.\nInjuries were a consistent issue for Lisandro Martinez last term and keeping the diminutive centre-back fit will be key. When available, he's a guaranteed starter for the Red Devils.\nMan Utd completed a double swoop from Bayern Munich during the summer window, recruiting Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui. The former should establish himself as Martinez's partner - especially given Leny Yoro's injury - and the latter will likely compete with Diogo Dalot for a starting spot at right-back. However, the Moroccan's versatility means he can fill in at left-back, as can Dalot.\nMidfielders\nMan Utd's midfield was their downfall last season, with injured and ageing legs repeatedly costing them. They appear to have remedied that issue in the market this summer, with Uruguay international Manuel Ugarte arriving. The 23-year-old should offer the necessary bite and energy in the engine room, displacing his South American colleague Casemiro.\nThere is no doubt about who will feature alongside Ugarte in a double pivot. That will be Kobbie Mainoo, who is the shining light in what Man Utd hope is the beginning of a new era. The teenager is already capable of dominating the midfield battle on the biggest stages and should have no issues playing every week.\nForwards\nMan Utd have plenty of attacking talent to spread across their front four, with Rasmus Hojlund having shown glimpses of his quality throughout an up and down debut campaign. The Danish striker is currently injured but should still find himself ahead of summer signing Joshua Zirkzee in the pecking order.\nBruno Fernandes may not be a traditional captain in many senses but the Man Utd skipper still has bags of quality. There are no doubts he's guaranteed to start when fit, with the Portuguese often a difference-maker in the number 10 role.\nMuch like Mainoo in midfield, young Alejandro Garnacho has also been a ray of hope for the future after a fantastic campaign. He netted the 2023/24 Premier League Goal of the Season with his overhead kick against Everton and was a consistent threat up top despite those around him often failing to hit the same heights. Man Utd also have Amad Diallo in reserve.\nMarcus Rashford failed to find any sort of consistency for Man Utd last term, looking a shadow of his former self. Injuries didn't help, but the 26-year-old can no longer hide behind the defence of youth. This is a make-or-break season for the England international.\nPotential Man Utd lineup for 2024/25 season\n(4-2-3-1): Onana; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Martinez, Shaw; Ugarte, Mainoo; Garnacho, Fernandes, Rashford; Hojlund.",
