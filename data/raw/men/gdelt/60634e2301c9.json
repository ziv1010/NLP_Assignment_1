We played some of our best football of the season and ended up behind,” Bellingham told Amazon Prime.\n“I don’t care what form City are in they are still an unbelievable team. It’s always tricky to play against them and we finally took the chance at the end.”\nIt is the fourth consecutive season City and Madrid have met in the knockout phase of the competition, with the winner in each of the past three encounters going on to lift the Champions League trophy.\nCity overcame a slow start at the Etihad and took the lead in the 19th minute as Haaland steered past Thibaut Courtois after Josko Gvardiol chested down a pass from Jack Grealish.\nVinicius Junior hit the crossbar for Madrid before City defender Manuel Akanji did likewise with a header, while Haaland was denied a second goal right after half-time when his deflected shot came back off the woodwork.\nMadrid equalised on the hour after the City wall blocked a free-kick, with Dani Ceballos clipping the ball back into the area where Mbappe’s mishit volley looped into the net after coming off his shin and leaving Ederson stranded.\nCity regained the lead 10 minutes from time as Haaland stuck away a penalty after Phil Foden was clattered by Ceballos.\nBut former City player Brahim Diaz levelled for Madrid in the 86th minute after a dreadful kick by Ederson, and Bellingham punished the hosts for more suspect defending as the England midfielder struck the winning goal at the death.\n“I don’t know how to put it into words straight away, it’s so raw and frustrating for everyone,” said City defender John Stones.\n“It’s a feeling of anger and frustration,” he added. “We need to see games out better. We need to step up when these bad moments happen.”",
