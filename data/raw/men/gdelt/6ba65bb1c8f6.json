But for me it is not fair,” said Emery. “My explanation is it is one action after a long time. If the assistant referee did not see it, we must continue playing.\n“I think the problem is the VAR should not be asking in this situation. I accept it but it is not fair.\n“I can’t say anything more about it. It is football and of course Brentford played fantastic with one player less than us.”\nDefeat leaves Villa still seven points adrift of leaders Arsenal, but also looking over their shoulder in the battle for a place in next season’s Champions League.\nEmery’s side are seven points ahead of sixth-placed Liverpool with a place in the top five likely to be enough to secure Champions League qualification.",
