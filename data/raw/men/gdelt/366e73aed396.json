  "body_text": "Xabi Alonso and Real Madrid bosses are in agreement that Rodrygo will be free to leave should the club receive a ‘suitable’ offer for the forward this summer, according to reports.\nRodrygo had been viewed as one of Madrid’s key assets at the start of last term, but the 24-year-old increasingly found himself on the periphery of Carlo Ancelotti’s plans as the campaign wore on.\nThe Brazilian finished the season with a tally of just six league goals to his name as Los Blancos failed to win any major silverware for the first time in four years, which ultimately led to Ancelotti’s exit.\nThe heightened uncertainty over Rodrygo’s standing at the Bernabeu has alerted Arsenal to a potential deal, with the Gunners on the hunt for a left-sided attacker to replace Gabriel Martinelli.\nAccording to The Athletic, serious ‘concerns’ arose within Madrid’s hierarchy surrounding Rodrygo’s motivation levels in training midway through last season and there had been hopes that the winger would respond positively.\nRodrygo’s father and agent, Eric Goes, however, has complained internally that his son’s situation is directly and inextricably linked to the high-profile presence of superstar trio Jude Bellingham, Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior.\nThe report suggests this has ‘not gone down well’ at Madrid, prompting the club to ‘open the door’ to a potential transfer, with Alonso said to have greenlit the player’s proposed departure.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nBoth before and during Madrid’s Club World Cup campaign, Alonso has intimated that he would ideally like to keep hold of Rodrygo beyond the summer, despite the Brazil international making just one solitary start in the United States.\n‘Rodrygo is a Real Madrid player, and I will speak with everyone who is part of Real Madrid,’ Alonso told reporters after being appointed as Madrid’s head coach.\n‘Rodrygo is a spectacular player and we will need him. He deserves it and so do we.’\nAsked about Rodrygo’s situation in the build-up to Madrid’s opening clash with Al-Hilal, Alonso said: ‘I know what had happened in the final stretch [of last season], it was not easy for him.\n‘He took some time to reset his head and I see him wanting to enjoy and contribute.’\nBut Rodrygo has been limited to just 23 minutes since starting Madrid’s 1-1 draw with Al-Hilal and it appears Alonso is already preparing for the prospect of life without Rodrygo next season.\nOn Tuesday evening, the two-time Champions League winner was left as an unused substitute as Madrid edged out Juventus to reach the quarter-finals, where they will face Borussia Dortmund.\nIt’s understood Madrid value Rodrygo at around €100million (£85m).\nRodrygo’s current contract in the Spanish capital runs through to June 2028.\nAthletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams, Chelsea’s Noni Madueke, Brighton’s Kaoru Mitoma and Newcastle Anthony Gordon also find themselves on Arsenal’s transfer shortlist this summer, but Rodrygo is believed to be their primary target out wide.\nMore Trending\nLast month, Arsenal defender Gabriel Magalhaes was asked whether he had any inside information on Rodrygo’s current mindset amid speculation he could soon be joined by his fellow countryman in north London.\n‘I don’t. No, I don’t, not really,’ the Brazilian centre-back told the Podpah Podcast.\n‘But I’d like it, obviously. Rodrygo is a phenomenon, for me. He’s not at Arsenal… I’ve told people already, he’s a phenomenon.\n‘His name is mentioned a lot. If it was up to me, of course.’\nMORE: Jordan Henderson breaks down in tears grieving Diogo Jota as Liverpool postpone pre-season\nMORE: Iconic Manchester United Premier League winner joins Arsenal coaching staff\nMORE: Premier League star ‘opening doors’ to £50m Arsenal transfer",
