Because there's the pressure involved, the experience of the remaining teams, and it's far more difficult tactically, and emotionally.\"\nAll eyes will undoubtedly be on Matildas skipper Sam Kerr and whether she is fit enough to start against France, but Gielnik was wary of the Aussie attacker re-injuring her troublesome calf.\nWith or without Kerr playing big minutes, Gielnik has backed the Matildas to \"go all the way\".\n\"I'm not worried that she can't handle it,\" Gielnik said. \"I'm more worried from an injury perspective coming back, so I don't think it's necessary for her to start.\n\"We've always said that this was the squad to do something special. This is the time, it needs to be now and anything is possible.\"\nWomen's World Cup Quarter-final\nAustralia v France at Brisbane Stadium, Saturday at 5pm\nOur journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.
