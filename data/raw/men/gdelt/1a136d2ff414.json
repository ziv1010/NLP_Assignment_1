  "body_text": "Everton and West Ham set to battle for in-form Bundesliga striker, with summer move on the cards\nEverton and West Ham United are both reportedly considering a summer move for Union Berlin centre-forward Sheraldo Becker, who has been in good form this season.\nBoth teams have been very poor this season and have a serious chance of being relegated, so the outcome of the current campaign may ultimately be what decides the striker’s future.\nThe Toffees and the Hammers both have struggled particularly in terms of scoring goals, so Becker could prove to be a valuable addition for either of them.\nThe news is according to journalist Christian Falk, who claims that Everton and West Ham are ‘heavily interested’ in penning a deal for Becker at the end of the season.\nThe Blues recently had a very disappointing transfer window, missing out on as many as 14 key targets on deadline day, despite majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri promising Sean Dyche a new centre-forward.\nTEAMtalk revealed on Sunday that Everton are in financial disarray as they scramble to find funds for their new stadium. This is thought to be a key reason why they were the only Premier League club not to make a January signing.\nAs for West Ham, they brought in experienced striker Danny Ings last month, after Gianluca Scamacca and Michail Antonio have struggled to find consistent goal-scoring form.\nHowever, due to his injury record and the fact that Ings is already 30, David Moyes is keen to add a more long-term striking option to his squad.\nSheraldo Becker could thrive in the Premier League\nBecker certainly has the qualities to be a success in the Premier League, but Union Berlin are unlikely to let their star man go easily.\nThe German side are flying at the moment, currently finding themselves two points clear at the top of the Bundesliga, although second-placed Bayern Munich have a game in hand on them.\nThe 27-year-old has been key to their success, scoring seven goals and making four assists in 19 league appearances – giving him an impressive average of 0.58 goal contributions per game.\nWriting for Caught Offisde, Falk said: “Both West Ham and Everton are interested in Sheraldo Becker. We’ve just had it confirmed that Union received a concrete offer on Monday, though it’s not immediately clear which of the two submitted it.\n“Union, however, now have a chance to potentially secure Champions League football next year and they’re still in the cup, so that’s why they were reluctant to sell Sheraldo.\n“But in the summer they know they could lose him. He’s got a contract that runs until 2025. I could imagine seeing him switch to the Premier League in the summer.”\nIt is also believed that Becker has a release clause in his contract, but it is not yet clear what amount that it is set at.\nIf Everton or West Ham meet that clause, there is a good chance he could make the switch to England, as long as the player agrees on the move.",
