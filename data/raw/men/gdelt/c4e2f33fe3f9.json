  "body_text": "Galatasaray officially unveiled Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen alongside German winger Leroy Sané at RAMS Park on Saturday, presenting their marquee signings to thousands of fans ahead of their pre-season friendly against Serie A side Lazio.\nThe double unveiling became one of the most anticipated events in Turkish football history, with tens of thousands of supporters flooding the Ali Sami Yen Sports Complex to witness the grand ceremony featuring lights, music, and fanfare befitting two world-class players.\nThe event marked the culmination of what represents one of the most ambitious transfer windows in Galatasaray’s history, with the club landing two marquee signings to bolster their European ambitions following their Super Lig triumph.\nOsimhen, 26, joined Galatasaray on a permanent deal from Napoli after a sensational loan spell that saw him net 37 goals and eight assists in 41 games, guiding the club to both the Super Lig title and Turkish Cup. The transfer, worth €75m, becomes the most expensive in Turkish football history.\nThe deal includes an upfront payment of €40m, an additional €5m in bonuses, and the remainder to be paid over two years, with Napoli receiving 10 per cent of any future sale. The Nigerian forward signed a four-year deal worth €15m annually, not including revenue from endorsements and image rights.\nSané, who arrived as a free agent following his departure from Bayern Munich, inked a three-year contract reportedly worth £10-11m per season. His signing adds explosive pace and Champions League experience to an already dangerous Galatasaray attack.\nClub officials projected that the unveiling event could generate €6-7m in merchandise, sponsorships, and ticket sales, highlighting the commercial power behind the signings.\nThe unveiling took place a day after Galatasaray vice president Abdullah Kavukcu revealed the extraordinary financial sacrifice Osimhen made to secure his permanent move to the Turkish giants.\n“The amount Victor gave up to come here is truly enormous. He gave up a sum no other player would ever give up, and we are happy to have him,” Kavukcu told Turkish media during Friday’s press conference.\nThe Galatasaray executive expressed immense pride in securing Osimhen’s services without compromising the club’s financial stability, emphasising that the deal represents a significant coup for Turkish football.\nOsimhen’s decision to commit permanently to Galatasaray came despite significant interest from Juventus and Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal. The striker notably rejected a staggering €40 million-a-year contract offer from Al-Hilal in June, opting for the significantly lower €15 million per season at Galatasaray.\nSpeaking in his first official interview with the club, Osimhen expressed deep emotion about his permanent move, declaring that Galatasaray offers him the perfect environment to express himself fully.\n“This is where I can express myself fully through my football and with everything that I am,” Osimhen said in an interview with Galatasaray’s official YouTube channel. “I’m truly grateful to everyone who worked to bring me here. I came because I love this place, and I feel good here.”\nThe Nigeria international was initially welcomed to a raucous reception in Istanbul earlier in the week, with thousands of Galatasaray supporters flooding the Atatürk Airport and lining the streets to celebrate his arrival.",
