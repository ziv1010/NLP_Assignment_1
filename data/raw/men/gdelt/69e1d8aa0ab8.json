  "body_text": "Liverpool are close to appointing Ruben Amorim as Jurgen Klopp’s replacement at Anfield – and Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has already delivered his verdict on the highly-rated manager.\nKlopp announced in January that he would step down as manager at the end of the season, saying he is ‘running out of energy’.\nThe German arrived at Anfield in October 2015 and has built an all-time great Liverpool team which won the Champions League in 2019 and their first Premier League title in 30 years the season after.\nKlopp could yet mark his final season at the club with another Premier League title triumph – Liverpool are currently second, level on points with leaders Arsenal with seven games remaining.\nLiverpool made former Reds midfielder Xabi Alonso their No. 1 target to succeed Klopp but he confirmed last month that he was staying at Bayer Leverkusen, who are about to become Bundesliga champions.\nThe Anfield club also expressed interest in Sporting Lisbon manager Amorim and reports claim he has now verbally agreed a move to Liverpool.\nAmorim, a former midfielder with 14 caps for Portugal, has steered Sporting to the Primeira Liga title and two Portuguese League Cups since taking over in 2020.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nSporting look set to become Portuguese champions again in Amorim’s last season at the club, currently four points clear of title rivals Benfica with a game in hand.\nAmorim, 39, is considered one of the most promising coaches in Europe and has received a glowing endorsement from Manchester United star Fernandes ahead of his probable move to England.\nSpeaking to a Portuguese outlet during last month’s international break, Fernandes said he ‘hopes’ Amorim stays at his former club Sporting but backed him to ‘succeed’ in any big league in Europe.\n‘If he really takes the next step – I hope he stays at Sporting – but if he takes the next step, I think all the qualities are there to be able to succeed in English, French, or Spanish football,’ Fernandes – who left Sporting for United just two months before Amorim took charge – told SportTV.\nMore Trending\n‘Obviously, we know that the Premier League is probably the most desired. The qualities [to succeed in England] are there and he has everything to take the next step, in my opinion.\n‘But it will depend on the clubs, the directors, whether they want to pay the Sporting’s release clause or not.’\nManchester United have also been linked with Amorim as Erik ten Hag struggles to convince the Old Trafford hierarchy he can turn things around.\nAmorim has also received praise from Fulham and Portugal star Joao Palhinha, who backed his compatriot to thrive as Liverpool manager.\n‘Ruben is a coach with a lot of quality, one of the best in Portugal. He has done an excellent job since Braga,’ the Fulham midfielder told Portuguese outlet O Jogo.\n‘He has in-depth knowledge of the game and has a close relationship with the players.\n‘The way he is growing, he won’t stay in Portugal much longer. It will not be for lack of opportunities that he will not leave Portugal.\n‘He dreams and aims to win another title with Sporting and then the future will be in his hands.’\nAsked whether Amorim has the ‘capacity’ to manage a club of Liverpool’s stature, Palhinha replied: ‘Yes, of course, although the pressure is different.\n‘When you coach a big Portuguese club, you have pressure from the fans and the size of the club itself, which forces you to win.\n‘When you coach Liverpool, you have pressure from the fans, the club and the whole world. The way it is developing, I think it will be a matter of time.’\nAlmorim is yet to respond to speculation he has agreed a move to Anfield but cast further doubt over his future at Sporting in a press conference last week.\nAsked if he could confirm that he will still be Sporting’s manager next season in light on Alonso’s decision, Amorim told reporters: ‘No, I can’t guarantee that.\n‘Sporting are already dealing with the future, I can’t decide.\n‘I gave my word and I can’t go back on it. If we don’t win titles, I’ll leave Sporting. It was clear from the start and it was the message I passed on to the players. We have to win titles.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: John Murtough set to leave Manchester United this week with Dan Ashworth incoming\nMORE: Arsenal issue statement to fans after Isis threatens to target Champions League match",
