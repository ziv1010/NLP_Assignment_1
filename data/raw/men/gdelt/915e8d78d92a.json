Barcelona and Lyon, who have won the last eight editions between them, each have a maximum nine points, with 14 goals scored and one conceded, and know victory on Thursday would book a quarter-final spot with two games to spare.\nHolders Barça face Rosengård exactly a year on from beating them 6-0 at the Camp Nou, and it was by the same scoreline that they won in Malmö last week. Barcelona ended the match with several teenagers, including three debutants, on the pitch, and while the Camp Nou is not available this season, the swashbuckling football that reclaimed them the title in 2022/23 certainly is. On Monday, coach Jonatan Giráldez announced that he would leave at the end of the season, having been Champions League runner-up in his first campaign in charge of 2021/22 before victory last term.\nLyon moved three points clear of Brann last week with a 3-1 home win, the visitors' consolation actually the first group goal OL had conceded since Matchday 2 last season. Another victory would not just confirm Lyon's progress but also first place –something they missed out on a year ago ahead of suffering a quarter-final exit at Chelsea. Brann, though, will have hopes of their own, not least after the impressive display of 17-year-old Signe Gaupset at Lyon, and Andrine Hegerberg, after recovering from a long-term injury, could potentially play some part against sister Ada.\nFrankfurt aim to better Benfica\nWhile Barcelona seem to be running away with Group A, even if top spot cannot be confirmed on Thursday, the race for second place between Benfica and Frankfurt is intense. Benfica took a three-point lead last week with a hard-fought home win courtesy of Marie Alidou's 71st-minute goal, and hold out hope of clinching a maiden quarter-final with victory at Stadion am Brentanobad.\nFour-time winners in their previous guise as FFC Frankfurt, Eintracht have different ideas as they continue their debut campaign in the modern group stage. In the days when Frankfurt were dominating the competition, the idea they might have a European run ended by a Portuguese club was fanciful, but Benfica have been changing all that.\nStill, after losing at Estádio do SL Benfica in the first Women's Champions League game to be played there, Frankfurt coach Nico Arnautis said: \"[At home] the atmosphere will like here, but in our favour. It will be a new game and we have a big challenge. I think we have the quality to win.\"\nWhen are the rest of the Women's Champions League group stage games?\nMatchday 5: 24/25 January\nMatchday 6: 30/31 January\nBriefing notes\n- St. Pölten and Slavia's goalless draw in Austria left both still two points behind Brann in Group A and each know victory in Prague is paramount regardless of the result of the other game in Norway.\nWhere is the 2024 UEFA Women's Champions League final being played?\nSan Mamés Stadium in Bilbao will stage the 2024 UEFA Women's Champions League final on Saturday 25 May, with the kick-off time to be confirmed.\nThe 50,000-plus capacity home of Bilbao's Athletic Club was built on the site of the old San Mamés, replacing the 100-year-old arena of the same name in 2013. Athletic Club women's team have played several games in the new stadium, attracting 48,121 fans for a 2019 cup tie against Atlético de Madrid, at the time a Spanish record.\nSan Mamés previously staged two quarter-finals and a semi-final when the 2019/20 Women's Champions League concluded with an eight-team knockout tournament played behind closed doors. The other matches, including the final, were held in San Sebastián, the second time the competition had concluded in Spain after the Coliseum Alfonso Pérez in Getafe held the first decider of the rebranded Women's Champions League in 2010.",
