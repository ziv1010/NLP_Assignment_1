  "body_text": "Liverpool\nPremier League • England\nLiverpool ‘poised’ to save £130m by signing self-confessed Reds fan over Bellingham this summer\nLiverpool are reportedly ‘ready’ to make a move for Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot, as they look for alternatives to Jude Bellingham.\nThe France international is out of contract at the end of the season and will be available on a free transfer this summer – so the Reds could save around £130m by taking this decision.\nRabiot is arguably one of the best midfielders in Serie A on his day. However, Liverpool are expected to face competition from Manchester United for his signature.\nAfter joining Juventus from Paris Saint-Germain in 2019, Rabiot initially struggled to acclimatise to Italian football. But now, he has well and truly made his mark on the division.\nThis season, the Frenchman has made 37 appearances across all competitions, scoring 10 goals and making four assists in the process.\nA versatile player, Rabiot can play as a deep-lying midfielder, in a more central or attacking role, or even as a left winger on occasion, so could provide cover in multiple areas for Jurgen Klopp next season.\nREAD MORE: Tottenham set to battle Liverpool, Man City for Chelsea talent that could be offloaded this summer\nLiverpool eye major Rabiot bargain\nIt’s no secret that Klopp is looking to bolster his midfield this summer. Indeed, with the likes of James Milner, Jordan Henderson and Fabinho all past their prime, Liverpool could certainly do with some fresh faces.\nTheir aging squad has reflected in their results this season, too.\nThe Reds currently sit in a disappointing eighth place in the Premier League table – a far cry from last term, when they came close to securing a historic quadruple.\nLiverpool’s number one target, was, until recently, Bellingham – but after deciding against a move which could have cost them £130m, they are now pursuing other targets.\nThere are plenty of names on Klopp’s summer shortlist, including Bayern Munich’s Ryan Gravenberch, Celta Vigo youngster Gabri Viega and Manchester City academy graduate Romeo Lavia.\nBut, Rabiot would certainly be a much more experienced option, and according to the Liverpool Echo, the Reds’ are ‘poised’ to make their move.\nHe has experience playing at the highest level, too, making 60 appearances in the Champions League to date.\nThe 27-year-old has also picked up 36 caps for the France national team and played a key role in Les Blues reaching the World Cup final last year, so there is no doubting his quality.\nRabiot is also a self-declared Liverpool supporter, saying in an interview last month that he was “a fan of Steven Gerrard” and therefore he “followed the Reds.”\nWith that in mind, the midfielder would probably love the opportunity to play at Anfield next season. So, if Liverpool do come in for him, they would have a great chance of securing his signature.",
