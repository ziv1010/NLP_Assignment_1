Gabriel Jesus' knee injury and subsequent surgery, coupled with Reiss Nelson suffering a hamstring problem a week before the season resumed following the World Cup break, drew attention to the lack of cover for Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Eddie Nketiah.\nA couple of days before the North London Derby win over Tottenham Hotspur and it appeared the Gunners were going to seal a deal for talented winger Mykhailo Mudryk. However, they were gazumped by London rivals Chelsea in the end, thus forcing Arteta and Edu to pivot and wrap up the signing of Trossard.\nA few days later, the club confirmed another new arrival in Kiwior and he can provide cover for Gabriel Magalhaes as the left-sided central defender. So in many ways, it was already mission complete in terms of Arsenal's main priorities this month, long before deadline day.\nWith that said, there is room for another addition in the midfield department. Arteta has said so himself as it's unclear as to how long Elneny will be out of action, whilst Thomas Partey doesn't have the best injury record and Granit Xhaka will need a rest at some point over the next few months.\nLuckily for Arteta and Edu, there are several potential dream signings that would delight many Arsenal fans. There is strong interest in Moises Caicedo and the fact he can operate as a '6' and an '8' means he would be an ideal midfield addition - but Brighton are said to be demanding £90milion for his services.\nMartin Zubimendi (£52.8m) and Ibrahima Bamba (£26m) are cheaper alternatives, Eduardo Camavinga has been linked with a loan move, and some supporters have taken to social media to wish for an - albeit unrealistic - Kaoru Mitoma announcement on deadline day following his recent impressive form and goal for Brighton against Liverpool in the FA Cup on Sunday.\nOf course, signing Cavaminga or Mitoma is highly unlikely to happen, but if the Gunners can bring in a midfielder - whether that be Caicedo, Zubimendi or Bamba - then deadline day will be considered a successful one.\nWorst-case\nIf the Gunners do not get any business done before the 11pm deadline then it's likely to be seen as an opportunity missed and there will be flashbacks to a year ago where the club decided to not do any business, which ultimately ended up costing them Champions League qualification.\nJust like how Arsenal's priority today should be to sign a midfielder, last in January it was just as clear that they needed reinforcements in this department and they were heavily linked with the likes of Georginio Wijnaldum, Arthur Melo and Bruno Guimaraes throughout the month.\nConsidering Caicedo is also attracting interest from Chelsea and Manchester United, if he was to sign for any club other than the Premier League leaders on deadline day then unless the Gunners have a plan B option waiting in the wings, supporters won't be best pleased if no midfielder arrives before the window closes.\nRate Arsenal's window below\nREAD NEXT:\nArsenal handed major Moises Caicedo transfer boost amid Brighton's Yasin Ayari transfer deal\nArsenal's Premier League squad after January transfer window if three deals are completed\nPatino scores, midfielder set for recall and two deals to be confirmed - Arsenal loan latest\nArsenal cannot risk transfer window failure repeat amid Moises Caicedo talks and Partey dilemma\nFind the footballs on the football.london website to win cash prize, vouchers and TV worth £3,000",
