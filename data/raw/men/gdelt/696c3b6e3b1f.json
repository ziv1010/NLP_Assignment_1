She netted 10 goals and eight assists in the just-ended season.\nNFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi, said the football-governing body was not surprised as Ajibade has always been an epitome of discipline, dedication, diligence and total commitment to the cause for Club and Country.\n“Rasheedat has always been that role model who examplifies what you expect of a star actor in any field. She has been an epitome of discipline and dedication, and has carried the Super Falcons on her lean shoulders with a sense of patriotism and ambition.\n“We congratulate and commend her for the rare honour and we believe that the diadem will spur her even further to lead the Super Falcons to glory at the forthcoming Women’s Olympic Football Tournament in France.”\nAjibade was one of the key actors as the Super Falcons reached the Round of 16 at the last year’s FIFA World Cup finals in Down Under, unbeaten in regulation time before exiting after a penalty shootout defeat by England.\nShe became team captain afterwards, and has led the team to qualify for the Women’s Olympic Football Tournament for the first time in 16 years.",
