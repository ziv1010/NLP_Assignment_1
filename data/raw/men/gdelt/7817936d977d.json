What to watch for this EPL season\nBy Vince Rugari and Emma Kemp\nPremier League with 4K on Stan Sport.\nEvery match, live & on demand.\nThe world’s most-watched football league starts afresh next weekend, with Liverpool defending their title.\nTwenty teams will each play 38 matches to settle the marathon campaign that is the English Premier League. Who will stand supreme next May? What do we make of the big guns, and where are the best storylines lurking?\nHere’s a look at 10 of the big issues heading into EPL season 25/26.\nWhat does life after Ange look like for Spurs?\nWe said they’d regret sacking Ange Postecoglou, the man who delivered their first trophy in 17 years. So, will they? Former Brentford manager Thomas Frank has been installed as Postecoglou’s successor at Tottenham Hotspur, and promises to turn the dial back from the ambitious idealism of Angeball to the comfortable pragmatism many fans craved during last season’s horrible 17th-placed finish in the Premier League. The exit of Son Heung-min to Los Angeles FC further underlines the feeling that a new era has dawned.\nBut the big question is whether their squad is good enough - and deep enough - to satisfy chairman Daniel Levy’s demands that they compete in all competitions, including the Champions League. So far, no good. They’ve made only two major signings at this point: winger Mohammed Kudus from West Ham, who looks an excellent buy, and defensive midfielder João Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich, who fills a clear need in the No.6 role. But it’s nowhere near enough, particularly given their injuries.\nTottenham had five players register 10 or more goals and assists last term: Son, Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison, Brennan Johnson and Dominic Solanke. But only one is guaranteed to be available for their first Premier League fixture. Son is gone, Kulusevski is sidelined until likely 2026, Maddison has just done his ACL and Solanke picked up an ankle injury in pre-season. Without more work on the transfer market, Spurs will go into Frank’s first campaign at the helm with a materially weaker squad, short on both creativity and defensive depth.\nAny chance, Mr. Levy? Or will we be back here again with another new coach in 18-24 months? Their 4-0 friendly defeat to Bayern Munich on Friday (AEST) doesn’t bode well.\nLiverpool after Diogo Jota’s death\nThis week’s tribute said everything there was to say about the impact of Jota’s death last month. In the first match at Anfield since the 28-year-old Portugal international died in a car crash in Spain along with his brother Andre Silva, wreaths were laid on the pitch and billboards read “Rest in Peace Diogo Jota and Andre Silva - You’ll Never Walk Alone”.\nThe double-header against Athletic Bilbao was also paused in the 20th minute for applause for the late fan favourite, who will soon be immortalised in a memorial sculpture outside the ground.\nThe void is real for the Reds, who must navigate the normality of a new season amid the grief felt since their teammate’s death less than a month ago. Then there is the actual football, which starts at home against Bournemouth. Arne Slot is overseeing the knock-on effects of signing Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen (for £116m), with the German attacking midfielder set to push Dominik Szoboszlai out of the role he’s made his own. There is less tension associated with Darwin Nunez’s mooted exit to Saudi Arabia’s Al Hilal.\nWill Manchester City bounce back?\nA fifth consecutive title was the broadly accepted prediction for Pep Guardiola’s all-conquerors in 2024-25. The outcome was third place, 13 points behind winners Liverpool and with more defeats than their previous two campaigns combined (nine). Not only that, silverware eluded City completely for the first time since Guardiola’s maiden season in 2016-17.\nNow Guardiola, who has extended his contract until 2027, is embarking on his 10th season with new personnel and lessons learned. The former is a proper squad refresh, with Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders joining January signings Omar Marmoush, Nico Gonzalez, Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis. Kevin De Bruyne has also departed after a decade, but Erling Haaland’s future is secure until 2034, and Rodri is reportedly on the verge of re-signing until 2029.\nWhich brings us to the latter: Rodri’s fitness is critical to the well-oiled machine operating in the manner to which City has grown accustomed. The Ballon d’Or winner’s ACL tear last September put a spanner in the works, underlined by the success of his late-season return before another injury (groin) hit during the Club World Cup. Lesson two: City are still kings of the late run home, having snuck into the Champions League thanks to 10 games unbeaten to finish the season.\nOverall, this newish era looks pretty good, except if Guardiola is correct in predicting the physical and mental Club World Cup hangover will “destroy” City’s season.\nIs Gyökeres the missing piece for Arsenal?\nMikel Arteta has been on a shopping spree this off-season, and brought the club’s overall spend to more than $AU400m with a sixth and final signing late last month in Viktor Gyökeres. The 27-year-old Sweden international is the key piece of the puzzle, in that it solves the ongoing striker quandary that impeded the second-placed side’s 2024-25 title push. And the pedigree is certainly sound, with 39 goals for Sporting en route to the Liga Portugal title and a Champions League hat-trick against Manchester City last November. The question now is whether he can help his new club become champions for the first time since the Invincibles of 2003-04.\nGyökeres’ first start, in this week’s 3-2 pre-season friendly defeat to Villarreal, was a quiet affair and a sign this project will take time - both for him to get up to speed and for the other players to provide the quick service his runs behind defence need. Gyökeres thrives in open space and on receiving the ball early, in contrast to last season’s back-to-goal style of Kai Havertz and Mikel Merino, and the team need a style shift to cater for it.\nThe situation is reminiscent of Erling Haaland’s arrival at Manchester City, which sounds promising given how that has turned out. But time is of the essence. Arsenal start their season against Manchester United at Old Trafford, and also face Liverpool and Manchester City in their first six games.\nWas last season a fluke by Forest?\nWidely tipped for relegation last season, Nottingham Forest instead proved the Premier League’s biggest surprise, qualifying for Europe for the first time in 30 years - so hey, what do we so-called ‘experts’ really know? If anything, their seventh-placed finish felt like a disappointment given they were in the top three for much of the year.\nSo, can they do it again? Easier said than done, particularly with the added burden of midweek Europa League fixtures and tight Thursday-Monday turnarounds, which have undone many a side in the past. Losing Anthony Elanga to Newcastle is a blow, although one that the signing of Dan Ndoye from Bologna might account for. And they’ve done well to somehow keep Morgan Gibbs-White, who has penned a new club-record deal after the confusion of Tottenham Hotspur triggering his release clause, somehow illegally; we still don’t know the ins and outs of all that, but the outcome is top for Forest, coach Nuno Espirito Santo and their imposing owner Evangelos Marinakis.\nAre Leeds United here to stay this time?\nIt’s been two seasons since their last appearance in the Premier League, but a lot has changed for Leeds United. Mid-last year, Red Bull took a minority ownership stake in the club and slapped their logo on the front of their jerseys, bringing them into the same multi-club family as Germany’s RB Leipzig, Austria’s Red Bull Salzburg and Major League Soccer’s New York Red Bulls. The year before that, 49ers Enterprises - the investment arm of the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers - bought a controlling stake, so the sleeping giants of English football have some heavy-hitters behind them. Not to mention they’ve still got Australian Peter Lowy on the board.\nUnder coach Daniel Farke, they blitzed the Championship last season to win the title with 100 points (tied with Burnley, but ahead by a significant amount of goal difference) and seal automatic promotion, and they’ve since strengthened with seven key signings, including a whole new spine: defensive midfielder Anton Stach from Hoffenheim ($35.87 million), centre-back Jaka Bijol from Udinese ($30.9 million) and Brazilian goalkeeper Lucas Perri from Lyon ($32 million). All three stand at over six feet tall, so the Peacocks appear to be fortifying their defence ahead of what looms as a big challenge to stay up. The last six teams promoted into the Premier League have dropped straight back down.\nUnited need to lift, and fast\nEven as they slid to the worst finish since relegation in 1973-74, United fans sang in support of Ruben Amorim, who’d inherited the poisoned chalice, but proved he was not afraid to make tough decisions. But the Portuguese manager will only retain the faith if he does indeed return glory to this once glorious club. Another 15th-placed finish will not get that done. United have a new, expensively assembled attack headlined by Matheus Cunha, and Bruno Fernandes scored 19 goals across all competitions (not to mention his countless other contributions). If the football can finally do some of the talking, maybe Amorim will do less in his soul-baring press commitments. But his statement that “I have to sell my idea, I don’t have another one” appears to remain true: he is a 3-4-3 until the end, and it had better bloody work.\nSunderland are back, and splashing the cash\nBefore Welcome to Wrexham, there was Sunderland ’Til I Die, a harrowing portrait of a club in decline. That series charted their relegation to League One and the financial problems that plagued the once-proud Premier League outfit. Well, now they’re back, having won last season’s Championship play-off to return to the top division for the first time in almost a decade.\nAnd so the Stadium of Light re-emerges from the shadows. Manager Regis Le Bris, a Frenchman, put out the youngest team on average in the Championship last term - and that promising, exciting base has been augmented by a raft of new signings. So far, they’ve spent more than $280 million, the biggest splash made by any team outside of the ‘big six’, with their transfer haul headed by Granit Xhaka, the former Arsenal favourite who returns to England after two terrific seasons with Bayer Leverkusen. Could they, maybe, ‘do a Forest’?\nIs Chelsea’s insane depth a good thing?\nManager Enzo Maresca has a claim to having two elite options for almost every position, making Chelsea the deepest squad in the league and proving Todd Boehly’s pockets have also been deep since the American businessman’s takeover from Roman Abramovich in 2022. To put it simply, the books are bloated, and this could be a strength, or a weakness - or both. An all-star cast, headlined by 18-year-old Brazilian Estêvão, obviously helped the Blues win the Club World Cup, and morale might be at its highest since the Champions League triumph of 2021. The challenge for Maresca will be balancing egos and maintaining unity throughout a season also featuring Champions League, which will not allow for the rotation he utilised successfully in the Conference League. Maresca, of course, may face another challenge in ingratiating himself to a Stamford Bridge fan base he did not exactly win over with his “Eff-off to all of them” moment.\nWill any Aussies get on the pitch?\nIt’s slim pickings in terms of Aussie involvement in the Premier League this season - although it is worth noting that, despite Ange Postecoglou’s sacking, there will still be one of our own in a London dugout. Former Socceroo James Holland has been appointed as an assistant at Crystal Palace, working under Oliver Glasner, his former boss at Austrian club LASK.\nBut as far as on-pitch action, it’s not looking good. Aston Villa goalkeeper Joe Gauci is the highest-profile Aussie on the books of a top-flight club in England - but he’s behind not only Emiliano Martinez but new signing Marco Bizot, the 34-year-old who joined them from Brest in France last month for an undisclosed fee. Another loan move probably looms for him.\nBeyond Gauci, there’s practically nobody else to follow. Garang Kuol is still at Newcastle United but unlikely to figure in their first team, while his former Central Coast Mariners teammate Nectarios Triantis is in Sunderland’s squad, but may yet leave either on loan or permanently after impressing at Hibernian last season - and there’s still a doubt over whether he’ll end up playing for Australia or Greece. A wildcard for a cameo at some point could be striker Marcus Neill, the son of Lucas, who is part of Sunderland’s academy.\nThe next level down, the Championship, will include 18 Australians.\nFootball has a new Home.
