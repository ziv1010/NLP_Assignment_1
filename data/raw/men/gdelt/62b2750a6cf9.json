  "body_text": "Moise Kean’s arrival at Everton in the summer of 2019 was very much in keeping with the new direction on which the Club had been trying to embark under the auspices of Farhad Moshiri as majority shareholder and his appointment of, first, Marcel Brands as Director of Football and then Marco Silva as Head Coach the year before.\nAfter two years of largesse in the transfer market where Moshiri had sanctioned the purchase of a number of expensive recruits in their late twenties who would, ultimately, have little or no sell-on value when it came time to offload them, Brands had embarked on a drive to reduce the average age of the squad with an eye on building something lasting with players who could still command fees if and when they left.\nThe likes of Richarlison, Lucas Digne, Bernard and Yerry Mina had arrived in the summer of 2018 and, the following year, the rebuilding process continued when 23-year-old Jean-Philippe Gbamin and 19-year-old Moise Kean were added to the squad at a cost of almost £50m.\nThough little was known about Gbamin outside of the Bundesliga, where he had spent three years at Mainz, Kean, a product of Juventus’s youth academy, was regarded as one of the hotter young striking talents on the Continent. As such, his signing by Everton was something of a coup, although, in retrospect, the £25m fee the Blues paid for the budding Italian international perhaps explained why there was little competition for his signature.\nBrands had clearly earmarked Kean as a long-term investment. The striker had pressed his claims for making the step up to Juve’s senior side when he was still 16 by scoring at a rate of a goal a game for their academy side in 2015-16 and became the Serie A giants’ youngest-ever debutant the following season.\nBy the time he had moved to Merseyside, he had continued his development with a loan spell at Verona, become the first player born in the 2000s to score in Europe's five big leagues, and graduated to being a full Italy international, earning three senior caps and scoring two goals. His promise was not lost on Juve who were prepared to take a sizeable transfer fee for their young protegé but negotiated first option to buy him back should Everton want to cash in down the road.\nKean's integration into Silva's side was measured by the Portuguese, who had to balance the imperative to get 2019-20 off to a good start with the need to blood his young new signing. Sparse displays as a late substitute meant that the Italian struggled for the amount of game time he needed in which to really settle into the rigorous demands of the Premier League.\nIn November 2019, with only two starts and no complete games in a Blue shirt, he was disciplined for turning up late to a team meeting while, on the field, scoring goals proved to be especially difficult in an Everton side that was struggling across the board and which had dropped into the bottom three by the first week of December 2019.\nSilva paid for the poor run with his job and was replaced temporarily by Duncan Ferguson, who handed Kean the ignominy of being substituted only 17 minutes after coming on as a sub himself in an away game at Manchester United. Caretaker boss Ferguson blanked Kean as he trudged off the pitch and the teenager walked straight down the tunnel. Some pundits rounded on Ferguson for his treatment of the youngster, who had still not scored for the club.\nDefending his decision, Ferguson said: “I was just doing it for fresh legs. Unfortunately, he was the one I decided to bring off. I see why he’s upset, but it’s about the team. I just needed to make a substitution to kill a bit of time. I’ve got so many strikers on the bench, I just decided to make that change. It was nothing personal to Moise Keane really.”\nThis was all before the striker's compatriot, Carlo Ancelotti, was hired as the new Everton manager at Christmas time, and the expectation was that, if anyone could get anything out of the Italian starlet, that man would be Ancelotti.\nKean gradually worked himself back into the reckoning at Goodison Park, scoring his first goal for Everton in a home fixture against Newcastle and adding a consolation goal in the embarrassing home defeat to Bournemouth after the season resumed following the pause for Covid-19. During the lockdown, Kean attracted unwanted headlines when video footage of a house party appeared on Snapchat showing the footballer celebrating with friends in contravention of Government guidance.\nWith Everton adding quality to the ranks with the likes of James Rodriguez, 2020-21 was seen as the season when Kean might blossom at Goodison Park. He made his first start of the season in a Carabao Cup second round tie against Salford City but disappointed leading the line before scoring a late penalty. He came off the bench in the next round at Fleetwood Town and notched another in a 5-2 win.\nWith Ancelotti making minimal use of him and many fans uneasy at his sulking attitude and poor body language, even when scoring his goals for Everton, speculation over his future continued until he secured a loan move to Paris Saint-Germain just before the transfer deadline in early October 2020.\nKean was given plenty of game-time at the Parc des Princes, first by Thomas Tuchel and then Mauricio Pochettino, and in 41 appearances in all competitions, the Italian scored 17 times, including three in the Champions League. It appeared as though he had done enough to earn a permanent move to PSG but, despite their cash riches, the Ligue 1 giants refused to meet Everton's reported asking price of £35m or offer anything more than another loan deal and eventually lost interest in Kean after signing Lionel Messi in the summer of 2021.\nThe then-21-year-old returned to pre-season training at Finch Farm and played in the 2021 friendlies but missed the opening Premier League games due to Covid-19 isolation protocols. He would start the League Cup 2nd Round tie at Huddersfield Town and score a great goal that was perhaps incorrectly ruled offside before getting shown a straight red card for a needless altercation with an opposition player.\nBy this point, it was becoming clear that Kean’s much-heralded move to Everton wasn’t going to work out how either party had hoped and there was heavy speculation linking him with a return to Juventus which eventually culminated in an unusual two-year loan deal back on transfer deadline day in August 2021. The agreement struck with Juve could eventually be worth around €30m when Juventus made the move permanent in 2023.\nJust like Ademola Lookman before him, Kean had arrived as an exciting young prospect but left Goodison having failed to settle, either at the Club or in the northwest. And like Lookman, he would eventually find his place in Italy where he would eventually start to realise his rich potential.\nIt would take more time, though. He had limited success at the start of his loan spell back at Juve, scoring just two goals in 10 appearances, six of them from the subs bench but he failed to play a full game all season in 2021-22, scoring just six more goals. He was set for another loan move last January but a leg injury put paid to his chances of joining Atletico Madrid and by the summer of 2024, Juventus had decided to move him on.\nIn July, he joined Fiorentina in a cut-price deal worth a little over £10m and his career appears to finally be taking off. So far this season, he has scored 11 goals in 14 appearances as I Viola have ascended to third place in Serie A, one point behind leaders, Napoli. And he is back pressing his claims for his national team for whom he now has 18 caps and five goals to his name.\nThough it would be tempting for Kean, now 24, to look back on his time at Everton with regret, he insists that, “Out of all the experiences I’ve had, you won’t ever hear me say I had a bad one. I find positives in all of them.\n“If I hadn’t spent that year at Everton, I wouldn’t have learned the things I did there,” he explains to James Horncastle in The Athletic. “I was a bit unlucky. I went there expecting to play a bit more. I was 19. I joined from Juve and thought I was going to smash it. Unfortunately, it didn’t go like that. We went through three coaches that year and mentally… it was all new for me. I was in England, it was a new environment.\n“The [other players] were so used to not seeing the sun, they were barbecuing on the beach in winter. They were in short sleeves in winter. I said to myself: ‘These people are out of their minds!’\n“But England made me learn a lot about myself. I matured a lot. When I got there I didn’t play much. I used to think, ‘How am I not getting into this team, at Everton?’ Mentally, it made me evolve. I wasn’t playing and it was in dark times that I knew I had to grit my teeth and train even more.\n“Then the chance to go to PSG (on loan) came along, I moved there and got everything out of myself that I could. I wasn’t playing at Everton and I knew I had to give triple. That’s how it went.”\nKean’s story is, potentially, another “what might have been” for Evertonians but at no point did it ever look and feel as though it was ever going to work out for him with the Toffees. Part of that was down to his youth and immaturity, part of it could be attributed to being a teenager in a foreign country and the culture clash he alludes to above. Much more could be explained by the chaos and instability that has been the story of the Moshiri years and has seen a succession of managers and sporting directors come and go along with many of their signings.\nRather than end up on the scrap heap, it seems this Everton misfit is finally finding his groove in his native land while the club he left behind in England is hoping to do the same in the coming years.\nReader Comments (247)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Playing under three different managers was never going to be easy, and he never got a decent run in the team.\nIt's great that he's settled at Fiorentina, and showing that there's a player in there, with all the goals this season.\n3 Posted 15/11/2024 at 19:19:25\nHe is back where he feels comfortable... let's see how good this kid can be.\n4 Posted 15/11/2024 at 19:23:59\nAnother immature young man in a foreign country, it's no surprise it doesn't always work out as hoped.\n5 Posted 15/11/2024 at 19:33:18\nHe looked like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders; we probably signed him at the wrong stage of his career. Good luck to the lad, I hope he succeeds.\n6 Posted 15/11/2024 at 19:35:57\n7 Posted 15/11/2024 at 19:36:35\nBecause you played like shit, son.\n8 Posted 15/11/2024 at 20:07:37\nThis decision alone might have ended up costing Marco Silva his job!\n9 Posted 15/11/2024 at 20:18:26\nNot the first time you said that and I expect it won't be the last.\nBill obviously felt that Brands merited a place on the Board of Directors for his genius in the transfer market.\n10 Posted 15/11/2024 at 20:31:47\nOffloaded to clubs who saw the raw potential, he failed to deliver until it appears he found a place where he was happy and more mature.\nGood luck to him, glad he found a place where he can enjoy his football.\n11 Posted 15/11/2024 at 20:40:24\nMarcel Brands must have been getting paid an absolute fortune to fail and still he got promotion. Sometimes I despair when I think about the mediocre people who have made a fortune out of Everton.\n12 Posted 15/11/2024 at 22:00:30\nNo vision. No long-term plan. Just hoping for a quick fix to make some money and survive for a few more months.\n13 Posted 15/11/2024 at 23:02:58\nMassive first touch always got away from him and he tried wayyyy too hard. The ball bounced off him.\n14 Posted 16/11/2024 at 00:07:30\n\"He looked like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders; we probably signed him at the wrong stage of his career.

You are aware that is something that may affect performance levels but can also eventually be mastered?\nI'm sure you'll just stick to remembering ‘yesterday' and chucking abuse.\n16 Posted 16/11/2024 at 02:00:14\nAlso, I always thought Antonee Robinson was a good left-back. He is better than Mykolenko by a country mile.\nThe Academy now seems to be able to organise a development path for young players to acheive a transfer fee – Cannon, Simms, Dobbin and Gordon have brought in £70M.\nLet's see what happens to Dixon, Harrison and Benjamin. They can get first-team appearances provided the results stabilise. Unfortunately, while we are kicking around the Bottom 5, they have no chance.\n17 Posted 16/11/2024 at 04:15:11\nI wonder if we did, or even tried? It's not like years ago, when young players from other parts of the country would go into digs – usually a lodger with a family. (I worked with someone who used to do that for Derby in the '90s / early '00s.)\nThese days with the modern \"pressures\" faced, I wonder how clubs do look after the welfare of players?\nIn a couple of generations, we've gone from players having to work after retirement from the game, to players who admit they don't know how to make a cup of tea.\n18 Posted 16/11/2024 at 05:12:46\nHe benefited from playing as a bit-part in a star-studded Juve team and we fell for it. A latter day Mark Robins at best. Completely over-rated.\n19 Posted 16/11/2024 at 05:15:12\nYour top post reminds us if we need reminding just how moronic and thick it is to call Moise Kean an 'arsehole'.\n20 Posted 16/11/2024 at 06:28:49\nPaul #6, he ain't that talented and he wasn't mismanaged, just misplaced.\nTony #8, the only thing that cost Marco Silva his job was Marco Silva.\nColin #12, Robinson was \"ruined\"? Funny, he doesn't look the least bit ruined. He looks great, for club and country. As for Lookman, he failed at his next four stops after us before he finally grew up and learned how to be a professional. Good on him, but the delay wasn't Everton's fault.\nMatt #17, I'd say we did, but the player has to do his part. Like Lookman, he didn't know how. Now he does.\n21 Posted 16/11/2024 at 06:47:42\nHe was successful at Leipzig in his first loan spell, Leicester wanted to sign him on a permanent transfer but couldn't afford him - as confirmed by Brendan Rodgers in an interview a few weeks ago. He has been a huge success with Atalanta.\nLookman was simply young and developing his game.\nThe same applies to Antonee Robinson. It took spells at Bolton and Wigan before he was ready for the Premier League. If we had shaped a proper development path for him, he would be our left-back today.\nEverton simply hasn't offered a stable structure for young talent to develop for the last 8 years.\n22 Posted 16/11/2024 at 06:51:15\nIt might be longer Steve. But, apparently, Kean is an 'arsehole'.\n23 Posted 16/11/2024 at 07:07:29\nI think the night he took this boy off less than 20 minutes after introducing him at Old Trafford was savage. His callous \"he'll get over it\" attitude made a very poor decision seem even worse.\nYou just can't publicly humiliate a kid like that and expect him to bounce right back.\n24 Posted 16/11/2024 at 07:07:38\nKeane arrived in a foreign country aged 19 years old, and he struggled to adapt.\nThen he gets shipped out on loan after he had 3 managers in his first season here - but the blame lies with him?\nWhat is unusual is our impatience and “eat your young” attitude to young players. It has been the same as long as I can remember.\nStones, Barkley, Davies, Kenny, Holgate, Lookman, Gordon and DCL have been targeted - that is easily £150-200 millions worth of talent.\nIn contrast, mediocre, unprofessional and embarrasing senior pros have been given a pass.\n25 Posted 16/11/2024 at 07:26:12\nI'm genuinely pleased for him in Firenze. A beautiful place to live. Erm, I think Moise comes out of all of this well and the best of luck to him and he's only 24 with his best years ahead of him.\nAnd, of course, the clown who called him an 'arsehole' paid no attention at all to Moise's tough upbringing. I can't bear people who. lack empathy and sympathy. And, erm, he is in a much better place now than we are as a club collectively.\nWhat an 'arsehole'.\n26 Posted 16/11/2024 at 07:41:55\nI look back at those decisions and bad luck (despite the complete incompetence by the club prior) as a real turning point under Moshiri. The end of the previous season had us turning the ship and we looked a good outfit, we know Silva is a good coach and I wish we still had him.\nI am pleased for Kean, i hope he continues to smash it. He looked lost for us, very poor and i saw little to know evidence at the time he was worth the cash. That's the way it goes but we don't have a good track record ala Lookman et al.\n27 Posted 16/11/2024 at 07:44:33\nI agree with the comment about Duncan. He never lived up to his potential, and Joe Royle called it right. I appreciate he struggled with injuries, that's part of the game. His discipline let him down. I know he was an iconic figure when a generation needed someone as a beacon of hope.\nI also don't think he got enough credit for how good a footballer he was, often viewed as a target man. When he played, he was more than that.\nAs has been said, Moise Kean arrived in a foreign country as a teenager and struggled to settle. As said by Mike, all players develop at different ages. Some, like Rooney, are ready made. Others, like Branthwaite, need a bit of experience (loan in the Netherlands). And others just take time.\n28 Posted 16/11/2024 at 07:51:29\nBy the time Lookman's time was up at Leipzig, they couldn't wait to see the back of him; he never scored a goal for them under contract. Four in 34 on loan at Fulham. It wasn't his game that needed developing, it was his personal maturity. Maybe Rodgers helped him along those lines.\nBut while Rodgers may have wanted to buy him based on potential, he certainly didn't consider Lookman a vital contributor then, because at the end of the 21-22 season when Leicester was trying to stay in Europe, Lookman played only 67 minutes in their last six critical games. The guy was an inconsistent failure with skills until he got to Atalanta at age 25.\nRobinson, on the other hand, was a starter at Bolton at age 20 and a full-time starter at Wigan at 22, starting every game if he was healthy. It wasn't that we didn't \"shape a proper development path\" -- it was that we never gave him a chance at all. Marco The Moron didn't believe in him and never put him in the squad for a single game.\n29 Posted 16/11/2024 at 08:11:23\n30 Posted 16/11/2024 at 08:28:13\nFootball is cut-throat and you can't really argue with your cut-and-dried opinion but, like they say in America, give us a break!\nSilva got the sack and Brands got promoted – only at the most dysfunctional football club in the world, Mike – a club full of nepotism and absolute mediocrity, and dozens of non-disclosure agreements, with a very handsome payoff when you are asked to leave.\n31 Posted 16/11/2024 at 08:28:46\nIt seems like he's agreeing with you to a degree in that he should have played him, although I did hear unconfirmed rumours that Lookman had a bit of an attitude problem in his younger years.\nHindsight is a great thing but, looking back, we maybe should have given Silva more time, but that wasn't the Moshiri way. Knee-jerk reactions.\n32 Posted 16/11/2024 at 08:39:49\nMoise Kean has only once had more than 12 starts in a season and that was at PSG where he managed 13 goals in 22 games.\nConsistency is so key to a player's form and confidence and it's why I think those who write off players that are hardly playing (such as Beto perhaps) are betraying a lack of understanding.\nIt's also about clever transfer policies. Don't spend big chunks of money on a young player unless you're pretty confident you can give him the time to play and improve (see Jake O'Brien), either at your club or elsewhere.\n33 Posted 16/11/2024 at 08:47:07\nMaybe I read too much into his comment as you did with mine, but it seems to me that he thought he had a God-given right to get into the Everton team because of our meagre level.\nNeedless to say, he didn't — certainly not playing as badly as he did from Day 1.\n34 Posted 16/11/2024 at 08:47:56\nHindsight but the constant factor has been Moshiri and his pigheadedness and having no patience nor understanding of football coaching and development.\nA shame that the career pathways have taken some very good prospects away from Everton and to a better place for some of Everton's youngsters.\nFor the best of the current senior youngsters, Dixon and Mills, I hope they can survive and play for Everton in the TFG era.\n35 Posted 16/11/2024 at 08:58:44\n36 Posted 16/11/2024 at 09:10:35\nOne of the other dimensions to the story is Kean's disgraceful treatment as a teenager by Italian and Juve fans and his own teamates. I am pretty sure it was Bonucci who criticised him for reacting to appalling racist fans towards the end of the season before we bought him.\nArriving in a new country after that at 19, and realising that Everton (despite assurances from Brands) was a mess unravelling must have tough - and then covid hit.\nThe role of Calvert-Lewin is also critical here. It appears that Dom rose to a challenge at the start of that season, found a new level, and became a good target man. He improved beyond the club's expectations of an athletic but not especially gifted player and blocked Kean's route to the First XI.\nHowever, we made money on Kean. The moral of the story is this:\n- Look after younger players better, especially those coming from overseas who are expected to show much more maturity than homegrown kids. They not only need a route to the first team, they also need properly looking after.\n- Buying Champions League potential teenagers is a good idea, because you can generally flog them for good money even if it doesn't work out (but paying more than about £20M for teenagers is risky).\n37 Posted 16/11/2024 at 09:27:30\nI'm not saying he is completely ready, but I think most of us can see the potential for him to feature in the first-team squad.\nPlay Lindstrøm central. Let Ndiaye do his thing. Hopefully McNeil will be fit for Brentford. Then we have the unpredictable Doucoure with anyone from Gana, Garner or Mangala behind them.\nThe questions being who lines up at the back, Keane, Tarkowski? Branthwaite is a no-brainer. And the full-back dilemma.\nOn the topic of other misfits, Harper and Richardson — they couldn't command a regular place, yet were so important to us.\nJoe Parkinson?? Barry Horne?? And what about Paul Power??\n38 Posted 16/11/2024 at 09:34:41\nAnd if Lindstrøm is central – where are McNeil and Ndiaye?\nNone of this is straightforward unfortunately.\n39 Posted 16/11/2024 at 09:51:06\nDixon earned a short runout against Doncaster… and got to play against Southampton in those cup games but, as far as the Premier League goes, he has lost his place on the subs bench (to Begovic!) since he was last seen there a month ago, and has been firmly placed back in the Under-21s.\n40 Posted 16/11/2024 at 09:51:53\nDixon is rapid and can get the opposition on the back foot. Patterson may take a while to develop and has been blighted by injury.\nWith regards to Lindstrøm, McNeil and Ndiaye, that is a conundrum, but it's good to have options, like a lot of other teams do.\n41 Posted 16/11/2024 at 09:56:18\nAgree with Robert we need to be investing still in young players we can develop and move on for big money, ø la Dortmund, Leipzig and Brighton for example.\nHowever, to do that, we need to embrace the model not flirt with it. In recent years we've at times invested in youth then blocked their pathway, that is not good for anyone. Look at Patterson as an example of this.\n42 Posted 16/11/2024 at 09:57:05\nHopefully the future for at least one of Dixon and Patterson is gaining experience on loan – because a high-quality right-back has been bought for the First Team.\n43 Posted 16/11/2024 at 10:08:58\nAs I say, I don't expect him to be playing the full 90 right now, but he should feature in my opinion.\nPatterson is a concern with his injuries, but I like his attitude and, if he can stay fit, he has potential and is another one who likes to push forward.\nIt's all about having options all over the pitch.\n44 Posted 16/11/2024 at 10:15:32\nShould that happen, we have to deal with what we have. I like Mykolenko, even though he gets criticism for not giving us forward options. Recently, Ashley Young has put in a few shifts despite his years.\nWe're heading into next week and building up for the Brentford match. Friends, family and Everton at Goodison.\n45 Posted 16/11/2024 at 10:15:45\nYou can argue both ways – if they are good enough, they are old enough, it's then a case of how much of a risk taker you are.\n46 Posted 16/11/2024 at 10:24:24\nYoung players like Gordon and Branthwaite have been given games and Patterson too when fit (he rarely is). Chermiti probably would have been getting opportunities but for injury.\nSo maybe age isn't the issue?\n47 Posted 16/11/2024 at 10:32:44\nDixon has something about him that I like. Same as Ndiaye, who is exciting to watch, a rarity in recent seasons.\nIt will be interesting to see how Mangala settles in.\nAnd yes, it would be good to see more of Chermiti to see what he has to offer.\nWe have the players, and I'm looking forward to seeing them next week as much as I'm looking forward to my usual haunts in town and County Road, before marching down the Goodison Road.\nThat last one is for Mark Murphy. I know he loves it really!!\n48 Posted 16/11/2024 at 10:35:39\nCertainly Armstrong looks close and Iroegbunam too.\n49 Posted 16/11/2024 at 10:41:12\nI forgot about Iroegbunam, probably because I struggle to spell his name!!\nThis is it though, we have the makings of a decent team, if we sort out the tactics and get organised.\nKeep researching, Robert, your detail fascinates me… and I think I know my football.\n50 Posted 16/11/2024 at 11:01:16\nAs Danny said, young Dixon had a very promising debut against Spurs and hasn't been seen since and, as Michael commented he has lost his place on the bench to Begovic. But Dixon has great pace which would be a big asset, especially if you wanted to play with overlapping full-backs, but our manager doesn't play that way.\nAs Lee Carsley said on his team selection this week, if you don't play the youngsters, then how do you know if they're good enough or not???\n51 Posted 16/11/2024 at 11:05:21\nI agree, Brands's weakness during that year, firstly not backing Silva after Moshiri's AGM outburst, and then through the debacle of the Saha Summer. He only came up with Iowbi to save the situation. This disrupted the preseason preparation and season plans. Silva then became a scapegoat.\nLockman and Kean both needed a more continental passing game to play in which they were never going to get at Everton.\nAntonee Robinson was a stupid transfer.\n52 Posted 16/11/2024 at 11:18:02\nI don't know how much the Friedkins will pump in – or should that be, with PSR, will be allowed to pump in. But for this club to get anywhere near challenging for a European spot, we need to be better at spotting good young talent.\nBut that only works if you have a good manager who can coach and improve players, and a manager willing to give youth a try. I haven't checked the stats but I think Ancelotti gave more game time to youngsters than most who have come after Moyes.\n53 Posted 16/11/2024 at 11:20:22\nAs it happens, we were something like 11th in the table of minutes for teenagers last season.\nAnd do you think if we had a right-back of the quality of Conor Bradley or Rico Lewis that he wouldn't be playing due to age? That seems a bit far-fetched.\n54 Posted 16/11/2024 at 11:28:58\nGood luck to him, I say, and hope he continues his form. Whether he's worth £1 or £100M is not really relevant. Just good to see a kid come through after a few false starts. He also seems to have the maturity to take the positives out of any situation. Can't have been easy for him when he was with us.\nHe currently appears better than what we have on our books in any case … he's second top scorer in Seria A, can't get there without talent.\n(Lookman is joint fourth - could have been a decent attacking pair for us in another world.)\n55 Posted 16/11/2024 at 11:42:59\nDenis, this is a very good point. Often, we have to be patient with young players. They can come good, surrounded by experienced players and the revolving door of managers will not have helped many of our young players, as it creates uncertainty.\nOn Brands, he done a good job on Branthwaite. His problem at Everton, in my opinion, was allowing himself to get sucked into the dysfunctional board, when he should have been focussed on his DoF role..\nAnyway, that's all water under the bridge. We move on.\n56 Posted 16/11/2024 at 12:38:02\nThis is the creme de la creme and, if players aren't ready made quality, they get left behind!\nThe Championship, Ligue 1, La Liga etc can develop talent. The Premier League is on a level of its own and we don't have time to develop players, we need them banging goals now!! (See our current Beto and Chermiti conundrum)….\nIt saddens me that Ndiaye is actually the exact player we all wanted Barkley to be! 😞Turning in his own half and bursting past players looking forward. Every time I see Ndiaye play, he is exactly to a tee the same player I thought Ross was going to turn into…\nSomeone above said “I can't stand people with no empathy or sympathy”, probably the same fella wants Dom to start up top every week. Have we not seen Saving Private Ryan? Remember when they let the German fella go because they had empathy and didn't kill him, then he knifes the allied soldier in the stomach in the building and kills him! That's where empathy and sympathy get you!\nI was taught growing up not to have empathy because it's weak and doesn't get the best outcomes. I couldn't care less about any professional footballer's career, as they don't give a shit about our well-being… fuck Kean, and fuck Dom right now!! We don't need empathy, we need quality!!\nThis is the Premier League… American sports have nailed it: take NFL kickers. They can be on huge contracts but, if they miss big kicks or start to slip, they get cut and fucked right off for someone else. Too much on the line.\n57 Posted 16/11/2024 at 12:51:21\nYou are correct that he didn't score a goal under contract for Leipzig, but he did score 5 goals for them on loan the previous season. You also say that he only played 67 minutes in their final 6 games, but omit to mention that he made 26 appearances that season and scored 6 goals.\nYou mention his personal maturity but, frankly, you have no idea about his personality, motivation or maturity.\nRodgers said this about Lookman: \"He came in and he was absolutely brilliant for me, scored some outstanding goals. I remember the goal he scored against Liverpool when we won 1-0, it was a great individual goal. We wanted to sign him at Leicester but sadly we couldn't sign any players that summer.\"\nI know a few Leicester supporters from my time working in the Midlands, and they were gutted they couldn't afford him. This season? 8 goals and 4 assists.\nThe guy is a fantastic player.\n58 Posted 16/11/2024 at 13:20:53\nWe've tried spending millions, that got us into a tricky situation.\nBranthwaite wasn't ready made but has developed into one of our best players at 22 years old.\n59 Posted 16/11/2024 at 13:25:45\nI would select Roman Dixon ahead of Patterson at this time, and agree that Nathan would benefit from a loan spell. Ndiaye should be first choice behind Calvert-Lewin, with McNeil moved to the left and Lindstrøm staying on the right. It is not his best position but we have no-one to play wide right; at least he is technically okay and has pace. Harrison to be back-up on the bench.\nI also think age is an issue for any club that struggles in the Bottom 5 season after season – the risk profile of selecting young players into a poor performing team becomes a problem for managers who may lose their jobs.\nTrue talent such as Branthwaite and Gordon will push through, but managers generally will only select younger players if they were signed for a sizeable fee – the club hierarchy who financed these moves expect to see the player in contention. Hence Patterson and Chermiti get regular game time while Academy talent like Dixon and Armstrong don't.\n60 Posted 16/11/2024 at 13:36:02\nDeveloping blistering players who are clearly class like Saka, Foden and Co is different because they actually were ready to begin with. Like Wazza, just ready made, but Pep held Foden back as they had Silva and Co.\nI'm talking Lookman, Chermiti etc… even the Shite are impatient with Darwin Nunez coz he can't score enough.\n61 Posted 16/11/2024 at 13:40:44\nThink of the Onana situation (sorry again, I said you were wrong, Dave!). Now that times two, we all typed furiously about not running the lanes, not trapping the ball, and not getting into battles for 50/50s. Let's just say there was a list and that was him just out of Juve's development.\nHad there been a player in the side whom Kean respected enough to overcome his troubles, it could have turned us around. Instead, we saw him get double subbed as Colin stated, a covid party, and a roughed-up transfer image. It was worth the chance.\n62 Posted 16/11/2024 at 13:44:12\nCompare Giggs to Beckham, who was loaned out to Preston to develop him.\n63 Posted 16/11/2024 at 13:47:59\nIf not… mmmm. I'd argue it takes more character and strength to show empathy than not. It's incredibly hard, just on numbers, for any kid to ‘make it' but ultimately we're all human beings and being nice and compassionate tends to bring out the best in people, especially in youngsters. Kean was a kid and likely homesick and all of a sudden had 40k odd at Goodison Park expecting (hoping) he'd start banging in the goals.\nWe (I think) seem to forget most of these players are still really only kids. I didn't feel ‘grown up' until my 40s! They may have money and a relatively pampered lifestyle but I cannot imagine the pressure they must be under to perform, week-in & week-out. See how many have mental issues and addictions later in life.\n64 Posted 16/11/2024 at 13:54:56\nThey also must have struggles and are under even bigger pressure to perform?\nOr do we just kick them out the door after 12th place finishes (without deductions) and say good riddance?\n65 Posted 16/11/2024 at 13:57:00\nEmpathy is more powerful now in bringing out the best in younger people; it is also expected by them.\nWhen I started my career, I got zero feedback, coaching, support or positive reinforcement. I didn't know any better as that was how I was brought up!\nI can't say for sure this generational mindset switch applies to sport, but I think it probably does.\n66 Posted 16/11/2024 at 14:48:18\nThe Premier League is the most physical league in the world, and I'd guess it is a totally different environment to at least 95% of other leagues anywhere else in the world.\nI'm not saying you can't develop talent, but only the quickest, most physical or most skillful get through at an early age in the top English league. This is why it didn't take me long to realize that Marcel Brands didn't really have the necessary experience for the English game.\nSpend your money on coaching, Everton, because after the really top level 5% (the most natural of young footballers), I'd argue that the best coaches would be able to develop more players and a much better style of play for future generations, for any club who invests enough time, money, and effort, going down that road.\n67 Posted 16/11/2024 at 14:49:56\nBranthwaite wasn't quite ready made, but you could see it in him. He scored that goal right in front of me in the lower Shed End\nThe loan did him well.\n68 Posted 16/11/2024 at 15:00:33\nI certainly didn't mind getting criticized off any person who had my best interests at heart and was genuinely trying to help me become a better footballer, rather than just venting because they probably didn't like or possibly even rate me.\n\"You was good today, son\" –- I didn't know how to respond because I always thought it was my job to be good.\n\"You was shite today, son\" – I already know, thanks for reminding me!\nTell me why you thought I was good, and I will try and carry on doing the things that made me play well. And instead of telling me I was shite, tell me the things I was, or wasn't doing that contributed to me playing shite – because, after all, nobody likes playing shite.\nI don't believe there is enough of this in-depth and personal coaching afforded to young players (I might be wrong) and my own personal view is that this would make a hell of a difference, and definitely help to improve a lot of young footballers if it was offered to them.\n69 Posted 16/11/2024 at 15:08:55\nOn a similar note, Mark Cavendish, aka the Manx Missile. During his post-retirement interview, he said he would never make the grade now. He was not big enough or strong enough but could use his brain to make the right time to attack.\nThere is no metric for tactical or critical thinking!\nJust as well… or he would not be the man with the most Tour de France stage wins in history!\nSo I suppose my point is that we need to enable players to grow and accommodate talent. Moise Kean has taken time and it seems Lookman is doing okay now.\nFootballers are not fast food. It is not always \"I want it now\"; sometimes, you need to just wait.\n70 Posted 16/11/2024 at 15:49:02\nSilva is a fine manager now – in part because he learned from his terrible mistakes at Everton.\nYes, he coached pretty football, but he couldn't be bothered to coach basic defense -- we led the league in goals given up to set pieces for two seasons in a row.\nHe didn't need Zouma for that. He just needed to let go of his passive zonal marking system. I believe we would have been relegated if he hadn't been sacked.\nAs for Robinson, Silva and Brands should have known what a talent he was from his performances at Bolton, whom he helped save from relegation.\nI watched him instantly become the USA's left-back from his debut games in 2018. To give up on him and dump him for pocket change was inexcusable even if we did have Baines and Digne. That's on Silva too.\nSteve and Steve...\nThere was no bigger booster of Lookman than me. Nobody. I loved his gifts and I bored the hell out of the Forum by calling for him off the bench in every game.\nI was heartbroken when we gave up on him. But I understood. He had been given the minutes and had done nothing for us, and he wanted to leave. He didn't live up to his Everton contract. He didn't live up to his Leipzig contract.\nGood for him that he finally grew into his talent, but look how long it took. We'd have had to be monumentally patient and clairvoyant to stick with him that long.\n71 Posted 16/11/2024 at 15:51:57\nThe slow one now will later be fast - but the present now is full of self-preservation and doesn't want to be past!\nThere is definitely a lot more self-preservation in football, rather than out-and-out genuine talent. It is after all just a job, and jobs need protecting by any means!!\n72 Posted 16/11/2024 at 16:02:28\nThe kid is a fine physical specimen though, very quick, very strong, but a little bit too stiff, and he has developed over time – because he needed time (So maybe Silva even helped him Mike!) – into a decent or very good (depending on your opinion) fullback.\nI'm still not sure if Marco Silva is a top coach; I just think he got shafted by Marcel Brands. Zonal marking aside, his Everton team kept 8 clean sheets out of their final 11 games during Silva's only full season, after the pressure was on and the players got an extended 18-day break, including some winter sun, to work on things.\nHow can you play a high line with Michael Keane playing in the centre of your defence? This is how good Marcel Brands was, a decision so appallingly bad! It makes it look like him and Silva never actually talked about things together.\n73 Posted 16/11/2024 at 16:03:58\nThat was Kenwright and Parish. At the beginning of that Summer, Brands announced a sell-to-buy and tight budget. Mosiri released money at the start of August; Everton pursued Saha, having to deny the media reports.\nBrands's and Silva's careful planning took a back seat and the right players were missed. I always say that the purchase of Iowbi was to regain control and stop the Saha bid.\nBrands was Moshiri's pawn, brought on to the Board to have someone who knew about buying players, stung by the deadwood duds. He proved weak getting sucked in by Kenwright and Barrett-Baxendale. He gives Unsworth promotion, but seems to have let him keep his old job.\nHe did try to bring in a younger profile and promoted a young TV age profile of the Academy trying to do away the U23 team that were playing a different style to the first team and not developing replacements.\n74 Posted 16/11/2024 at 16:16:18\nThe youth development side will hopefully be developed, as a genuine and reliable youth system for Everton under TFG.\nAny youngster must have the passion and guts, to progress aside to their natural ability and potential to develope and improve.\nAs many have said, its been desperate times, for 40 odd years, and Rooney, was a once in a generation natural footballer.\nWhat chance do the youth have when they barely get a squad place, even when playing very well?\nThe current manager is in permanent damage limitation mode.\nThis season is flying by and by default I hope the die is already cast for the changes that will be needed to restore Everton over the next 3 - 4 years to a stable football club with genuine potential to compete at the top end of the Premier League and to win a trophy!\nI'm hoping there is magic in the air and the TFG era heralds a new positive age for Everton. Let's hope so.\n75 Posted 16/11/2024 at 16:18:14\nAgree, the only reason Dyche played Dixon against Spurs was because he had no other full-back, and he was our best player on the day.\nBut I cannot understand why he hasn't given him a game since; he even played Garner, who was completely lost, even if he did play there for England U21s.\nAlso, Ndiaye is totally lost on the wing, but Dyche said he's not a No 10, even though he plays there for Senegal?\n76 Posted 16/11/2024 at 18:33:02\nBut his pace and power have always been tremendous (despite the odd upright running style), and his attacking instincts are obvious.\nAs to what he has become... he was Fulham's player of the season. Pretty rare for a left-back.\n77 Posted 16/11/2024 at 18:43:50\nJust read Ndiaye got rated 5/10 playing as a 10.\nIt's all about opinions isn't it.\n78 Posted 16/11/2024 at 18:48:38\nA relegation Manager is as you say not interested in developing youth. Big Sam basically ended youth development when he arrived at Everton and killed the idea of a youth pipeline of potential. It has never returned to the days prior to Big Sam.\nDyche is the new Big Sam of the Premier League. Branthwaite was lucky to get a break and more importantly be up to it. But such a talent is likely to be in the shop window in a relegation-treated team.\n79 Posted 16/11/2024 at 18:52:30\nWho has proved us wrong in the past 30 years? Pretty much no one apart from Robinson and he was never going to oust Digne from a first-team spot.\nSeriously, U21s football is full of players at least as good as our lot and very few make it each season. The standard required in the Premier League is just so high.\n80 Posted 16/11/2024 at 18:54:44\nBut I did watch him at Everton and he certainly wasn't some raw talent. He was clumsy, deceptively slow, lazy, and a moaner.\nI remember watching him at home to Sheffield Utd and it was clear to me that he wasn't going to have an Everton career.\nOn the plus side, he proves that a certain profile of player even at decent money, is low(ish) risk. Buy young and highly rated – and at least the money usually comes back.\n82 Posted 16/11/2024 at 19:58:15\nWith respect to time, it's been shown many times that changing managers too often is detrimental but football isn't a normal business. Most clubs are essentially vanity toys for rich owners, who are often trigger happy if their toy isn't living up to expectations.\nI certainly think managers should be given time – albeit in the case of Dyche I think it's time for a change as the club is relatively stable now that Kenwright isn't there. His passing was the best thing to happen to the club in c30 years – not that I wish anyone dead.\n83 Posted 16/11/2024 at 20:00:54\n88 Posted 16/11/2024 at 21:32:49\nI was just highlighting that, no matter what they did, as soon as others were fit, they were benched. Richardson went on to win a title with Arsenal.\n89 Posted 16/11/2024 at 21:36:42\nPatterson appears to have been fit for approaching 2 months – at least he's been getting a seat on the subs' bench for the last month, albeit allowed to watch each match untroubled.\nOh, wait a minute. It was the other bloke who was from Dudley... nevamind!\n90 Posted 16/11/2024 at 21:42:15\nHe was very close to being the only player to win the English league with 3 different clubs, when his Aston Villa side fell away in the last third of the season in 1991-92 under Big racist Ron.\n91 Posted 16/11/2024 at 21:44:27\nHe was here about 6 months, was only interested in lining his pockets, keeping us up, and drawing games from a drawing position; he didn't go near youth development.\n92 Posted 16/11/2024 at 22:36:29\nThere is nothing wrong with dropping down the league to help a young footballer develop at a time that it is imperative that they are just playing, which is by far the best way to learn.\nI understand why you can blame Silva, Mike, but with two very good international fullbacks in front of Robinson, who knows how the conversation went?\nThey say a manager has got enough on his plate just managing his team nowadays, so surely this is why a club has so many scouts who all work under the Director of Football. I personally think that Director of Football epitomized Moshiri's Everton.\n93 Posted 16/11/2024 at 22:40:04\nI was sitting right behind Alan Harper when he lobbed Martin Hodge at the 1986 semi-final at Villa when both Sheeds and Lineker were declared unfit I think on the morning of the match. But I loved watching the two of them laughing and celebrating sitting in their blankets after Gregory Peck put us 1-0 up.\nI was also behind Harper when I watched him puking up in the car park at The Weld Blundell on the Formby bypass (that team or most of them were always there on a no-game Wednesday night).\n94 Posted 16/11/2024 at 23:07:43\n,\nThey just couldn't establish themselves in that team, which speaks volumes.\n95 Posted 17/11/2024 at 07:00:43\nI mean, it's not like we needed the £2M we got for him. But if you think Brands deserves the blame, fair enough.\n96 Posted 17/11/2024 at 07:03:50\nHopefully there will be progress with the development side. You're right, it takes dedication and hard work to succeed in football, or any walk of life for that matter.\nWhat used to frustrate me when I was coaching, was when we used to get the lads trials with Tottenham, Brentford, Watford and Wycombe.\nThey were chasing the dream. The sad thing from my perspective was that, if they didn't make it, they dropped out of playing football altogether.\nI used to try and convince them to drop down a level or two. One went to a club called Staines Town and did well for himself.\nJust enjoy playing and supporting football.\nMichael, I think the manager lost a lot of credit with the supporters when he had a pop at us. As for the other Dudley character, I don't like talking about him as an Everton manager!!!\nI will still never forget that night at the Emirates when I was fortunate, if you can call it that, to be sat behind the dugout and listen to him and Wenger as we got truly schooled.\nI'm off up to Dudley this morning to visit the wife's family. I will pop along to the house where Duncan Edwards was born or lived in. I've been there before. There's a statue of him in the town centre. I like my football history and I've visited the Munich memorial at the end of what was then the runway.\n97 Posted 17/11/2024 at 07:48:35\nIf so, lay out a plan for him, including a loan with a clear pathway forward. The progressive clubs do it all the time, experience for him and a ready-made back up left-back who would have really challenged Digne to the starting birth.\nAs I said in an earlier post, we need to stop flirting with the developing young players model and actually commit.\n98 Posted 17/11/2024 at 08:23:26\nSilva, will have obviously said, he’s not ready for my team, but this doesn’t mean he didn’t say he’s not ready yet, is how I think the conversation, might have went Mike, but I’m obviously just guessing!\nHaving this discussion did bring back memories of a conversation I once had with Paul Cook’s, brother, when Robinson, was playing for him at Wigan. He’s decent, but our kid said that this is what happens with young players, they make their mistakes with me, before they hopefully go on to better things, once they have ironed out their mistakes.\nIn the same conversation he told me Reece James, who was on loan from Chelsea, was already ready to play in the EPL.\n99 Posted 17/11/2024 at 08:50:15\nThere is quite a bit of improvement needed!\n100 Posted 17/11/2024 at 09:15:07\nTony, your first paragraph says it all. Without sounding like the President Elect, make Everton professional again.\n101 Posted 17/11/2024 at 09:34:51\nSilva wants fullbacks to bomb on often exposing the wings. If he was to stay at home, Silva would drop him for not attacking more.\nHe didn't make it with us due to the millions being thrown around by Moshiri, simply bad timing.\nHe is a modern Premier League left-back. Lots of international caps and lots of Premier League experience. A heart scare scuppered his move to AC Milan, who know a thing or two about players.\nWho are the best left-backs in the Premier League and can any of them defend?\n102 Posted 17/11/2024 at 10:06:29\nIf Moshiri hadn't pulled the plug financially 3 years ago, we'd probably have a better left-back. As it happens, Mykolenko is a better defensive left-back but just having a poor season so far.\nOur real challenge is to produce a higher volume of players of this standard – and also to sell many more players of this standard to generate a bigger transfer kitty for the first team.\nLiverpool won't be lamenting the sale of Bobby Clark and absolutely tonnes of others. They've pocketed the money and will reinvest in better. So should we.\n103 Posted 17/11/2024 at 11:17:04\nI was out most of yesterday and just saw your reply to my post, in which I said that youth only works if you have a decent manager who will give youth a chance, which Dyche doesn't.\nYou list Branthwaite, Onana, Patterson and Iroegbunam as, I presume, young players who Dyche has brought into the team. All the above were bought and not brought through our academy system.\nDyche himself has stated he doesn't coach Branthwaite much and Iroegbunam has said he hasn't had a lot of input from Dyche.\nI suspect that, if Brands hadn't taken him to PSV, we might still see Branthwaite in the U21s. Name me one player who has come through our U18s or U21s that Dyche has nurtured and brought into the first team?\nDixon got 1 game and has been replaced on the bench by Begovic. How often has he played Patterson when fit, and Onana cost a fortune and has said he has learnt more since he left Everton.\n104 Posted 17/11/2024 at 11:22:46\nSilva and Kean were both awful during their spells here and no amount of time, patience or sympathetic head-patting would have seen them succeed, irrespective of any more recent career achievements elsewhere.\nAt Everton, Silva had a worse win percentage than Allardyce, Koeman and Martinez, with only 19 league victories from 53 games.\nHis team failed to come from behind to win even once in a Premier League match during his time at the club, and his inability to coach a side to defend set-pieces (a trait carried on from his time at Watford and Hull) was a glaring weakness regularly capitalised upon.\nThat was a far more debilitating factor than losing Kurt Zouma and also a self-inflicted one that should have been worked on tirelessly on the training ground if you were persistently being punished through overlooking it.\nUnder Silva, we went out of the FA Cup at the hands of Millwall, conceded five against Liverpool (for the first time since 1982), six against Spurs, and lost against two newly promoted sides in Sheffield United and Norwich in quick succession.\nWhatever he's gone on to do at Fulham, Silva's Everton side ended up in an awful state and there's no way his sacking can be painted as premature or harsh in retrospect. We were in the Bottom 3 when he was binned and there was no indication whatsoever that he was likely to turn that situation round anytime soon.\nAs for Moise Kean, the lad was meant to be a £25M player yet he repeatedly looked like he hadn't the foggiest what he should be doing when out on the pitch and, after an initial burst of Beattiesque bombing about, showed all the urgency of William Shatner working his way through a wordy as fuck sentence.\nIt's easy to have a pop at Duncan Ferguson for bringing him off after turning to him from the bench, but people should remember the “callous” caretaker also made a point of not publicly criticising the player and stated he was taken off to waste time, even though it was far more likely down to Kean failing miserably to perform the role he was tasked with (and this after he made a show of sulking off down the sidelines and mouthing “What the Fuck?”).\nWhen he came on in that Man Utd game, Richarlison had to repeatedly usher Kean away from the left-hand side and tell him to play centre-forward. Straight down the other end and Iwobi was having to show him where to stand when defending a corner. Calvert-Lewin was shouting at him to get closer after winning the ball in the air and Kean being stood nowhere near.\nOnly 10 minutes after coming on, he was stood bent over with his hands on his knees blowing for chunks next to the guy he was meant to be marking. Then he was noticeably strolling around after giving the ball away when other players who had been on the entire game were busting a gut to get back.\nWhilst it was always evident Lookman (who some have compared him to) had natural talent but perhaps not the application, Kean just looked hopelessly lost, like a less physical, equally ball-repelling Beto minus the puppy dog expression and eager-to-please bound.\n105 Posted 17/11/2024 at 11:43:58\nWhich players from the academy have been good enough while Dyche has been here?\nThe brightest hopes in that time have been:\nWarrington\nCannon\nSimms\nWelch\nOnyango\nMills (injured)\nAll of whom have found their level in the 2nd or 3rd or 4th tier.\nThe point is that the academy hasn't produced anyone of Premier League quality.\nArmstrong has had bench time and a few minutes which is fairly normal for his age. There's talk of a loan too - which many on reflection reckon would have been good for the much maligned Tom Davies.\nDixon is probably the one exception where none of us know. I've seen him a few times at academy level. Some saw him against the likes of Sligo and Tranmere. We all saw him acquit himself well at Spurs. The reports are fairly mixed as to whether he's ready. I reckon he'd benefit from a loan. I might be wrong and he's immediate Premier League quality.\nAs of now, does he get in ahead of Coleman or Young or Patterson?\nAs unpopular as Young is, he's been good after some ropey early-season form.\n106 Posted 17/11/2024 at 12:12:24\nMaybe none of those on your list are good enough, which is a bigger question for our academy set-up. But Dixon was up against two fast wingers against Spurs and acquitted himself well, and I always like to judge players playing away from home as usually more questions are asked of them.\nLook, I don't know if Dixon is good enough but, to quote Lee Carsley, unless you give youngsters game time, you will never know how good they are.\n107 Posted 17/11/2024 at 12:20:57\nIt's pretty tough then to beat up Dyche about his use of homegrown youth if there's only really one example – and it's very marginal.\nAs you say, the bigger issue is that the academy doesn't produce enough quality.\nAlongside that, a huge issue is that any other Premier League clubs would not pin their hopes on Dixon – they'd just buy a new right-back.\n108 Posted 17/11/2024 at 13:28:51\nWith so many foreign players now in teams it further makes it more difficult for a young player to come through the ranks and become a established a first team player.\nOf all young kids who aspire to become a professional player the percentage who make a Premiership player must be very very small indeed.\nWe've touched on the subject of coaching before, while I'm not dismissing it, I think a players innate physical and mental abilities far outweigh any coaching.\n109 Posted 17/11/2024 at 16:40:52\n110 Posted 17/11/2024 at 20:12:00\nAgain it’s a contradiction, (I find most things are) because although I also think that a lot of coaching is overrated, I would also argue that clever, common sense coaching can make all the difference in a lot of circumstances?\nI remember reading Carragher’s book. He actually went to the National school of excellence, that was started in the eighties, with a claim that English football wanted to start concentrating on making the best young English footballers, a lot more technical.\nJohn Ebbrell attended one year, Carragher, went another year, and although they were both good players, the word I would use most to describe them would be methodical?\nThe English FA, spent loads of money, setting up this national school of excellence, and I could only shake my head when reading how a no nonsense coach from Yorkshire, stopped the session to tell Joe Cole, he would have none of that nonsense when the kid did a Cruyff turn in the middle of the pitch!\nGood coaching is invaluable, I just don’t think there are that many good innovative coaches around?\n111 Posted 18/11/2024 at 07:47:38\nThey all struggled initially when given a chance in the first team. Howard Kendall’s response was to continue to play them and they found their feet.\nAnd that was in a struggling team.\n112 Posted 18/11/2024 at 08:16:35\nHarvey was innovative, his method of the time was something that allegedly never even existed until about 30 years later, when king Jurgen invented the gengenpress!\nI also believe that good young players need good experienced professionals to help them out in the place that matters most, and suddenly Andy Gray joined Everton and Peter Reid also started getting his shirt every week.\n113 Posted 18/11/2024 at 08:34:19\nYou could also say that Dyche played one player continually, until near the end of last season, and he was adding nothing to the team, in my opinion, Onana.\nAlthough a good percentage thought he was one for the future, I'd ask why did he persist with this player? Was it because he cost a lot of money?\n114 Posted 18/11/2024 at 08:44:39\nI'm not sure what you're getting at. Are you suggesting Dyche should have played someone from the youth academy instead of Onana? If so, who?\n115 Posted 18/11/2024 at 08:51:31\nQuite simple: have a look at the midfield players Dyche did play when we won those games near the end of the season without Onana, without conceding a goal if my memory is correct!\n116 Posted 18/11/2024 at 09:05:48\nAnd what this has got to do with the point I was talking to Brian about?\n117 Posted 18/11/2024 at 09:08:48\nI was out with the dog yesterday morning and stood watching a training practice on the local park. I felt like stepping in.\nA couple of \"coaches\" stood talking to each other and occasionally shouting at the young lads.\nI used the EDIP approach. Explain, Demonstrate (important), Imitate and then Practice.\nYes, I took them through their paces and taught them tactics, but would always allow them to enjoy game play at the end. I would even join in!!!\n118 Posted 18/11/2024 at 09:32:30\nIt is too simplistic to say that academy players generally are not good enough/have not been good enough for the last 5 years.\nIn an unstable environment with constant turnover of managers, coaching teams, clear planning for young players and good senior pros in the squad, it is very difficult to introduce young players.\nHowever, until players such as Dixon are given a run of games, it is almost impossible for them to establish themselves in the first team. The Rooneys of this world are the exception, not the rule.\nDixon had a very good game on his debut, and was promptly dropped for a 39-year-old left-back. Regardless of the decent effort Ashley Young has put in at right-back, that makes little sense.\n119 Posted 18/11/2024 at 09:54:38\nYou and Brian were discussing whether Dyche played young players enough: Onana is a young player and Dyche played him continually although he was not doing enough to merit that game time but was always played unless he was injured while other young players hardly got a look in.\nCannon and Simms, in a position where goals were needed, particularly stood out. Although it was debatable whether they would have done any better, Onana was on the team sheet every game while doing next to nothing.\n120 Posted 18/11/2024 at 11:09:41\nGiven the level level you reached, I wanted to ask if you felt you were exposed to a significantly higher standard of coaching than most of us who got to school team or Sunday league level but no higher?\nYour comment about Joe Cole brings back memories of Brian Glover as the PE teacher in Kes (I guess most of us came across someone like that) or Harry Enfield's \"Yorkshireman\" parody.\nOn Xavi & Iniesta, I recall reading an interview with a guy from the Croatian FA who explained that part of the reason why they punch above their weight is that a country with a population the size of Wales is forced to put more effort into the development of youth players.\nHe offered the thought that 5'-6\" and 6 stone Luca Modric was fortunate to have been born in Croatia as he might have failed to made it through the youth systems of the larger European clubs.\n121 Posted 18/11/2024 at 12:23:16\nI thought he was going to be one of the greats. He had a very good career, but never quite made the “great” level. I have often wondered whether something was coached out of him, or whether the coaching he received enabled him to have the career he had.\n122 Posted 18/11/2024 at 14:24:12\nDepending on your perspective, Onana was a crap youngster and Young is a crap veteran, both getting first-team minutes when other options were available.\nMore broadly, hopefully our next phase as a club is to spend decent money on first-team players and, unless they are like Mainoo, Lewis, Alexander-Arnold standard, send 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds on loan to get experience and earn a spot in the First Team. Need to recruit more heavily into the academy ages 14 to 17, too as other successful academies do.\nI'd love us to become an academy led club but we have to invest much more in that for it to work. Could take a few years too.\n123 Posted 18/11/2024 at 15:09:51\nMy own guess would be that, whilst he would have got a lot more freedom and more people giving him the confidence to express himself at his boyhood club, once he signed for Chelsea, he would have had to alter his game; otherwise, he wouldn't have succeeded in a Jose Mourinho rigid system.\nThe no-nonsense Yorkshireman told me a lot though. I don't believe he would have had the nouse, wisdom or desire to coach technical kids, and that's why England has mostly produced methodical and workmanlike footballers until the last few years, and now it's slowly being changed by the elite academy system.\nI never really got coached that much, Mike, and when I arrived at Forest as a 16-year-old, I suppose I was light years behind when it came to some of the boring structure that makes up 90% of professional football!\n124 Posted 18/11/2024 at 15:14:03\nWe are tottering around at the bottom of the table again; if we were comfortable in midtable he might chance Dixon.\nTony @ 109, I agree coaching is important and as you say it does depend on the merit of the coaches. Different positions all require different physical attributes, probably the two extremes would be a centre-back compared to a winger.\nI would guess a central defender needs more coaching than an out-and-out winger, with a midfield player requiring the most.\n125 Posted 18/11/2024 at 16:08:00\nNot sure if Onana was a crap youngster but he was certainly over-hyped, again imo. Young has had a very good career and, while time has taken its toll on him, his present form means I would select him before Dixon, Coleman or Patterson until the latter is fully fit.\nWith Mylolenko having a poor season, that leaves us in a very poor position when it comes to full-backs, so you are correct when you say signing a full-back or two would be the first signing when we are in a financial state to do so.\n126 Posted 18/11/2024 at 16:54:43\nLots of us have this syndrome. With Colin it's Iwobi. With me, as you know, it's Holgate (loved seeing him get sent off against the USA last week!!!). With Mick, it's Pickford. For multiple folks here it's Keane.\nAnd I can't remember who it was who would flame Schneiderlin in every thread, whatever it was about. But I always got a kick out of it.\n127 Posted 18/11/2024 at 17:17:11\nA question I love to ask from time to time, is what's the most important position on the pitch? I stand there smiling whilst trying to engage people with regards the difference of opinion, and sometimes I get a few glares when I give people my own opinion after I've heard a few different positions mentioned.\nThe most important position on the pitch is your starting position, I tell them, usually followed by a little glare back, especially if they've got a few coaching badges!\n128 Posted 18/11/2024 at 17:19:55\nLess than 10 became major stars: Mbappe, Rooney, Vini Jr., Rodrygo, Gvardiol, Kounde, Sane, Sterling, Anelka.\nAnd at least a half-dozen have been clear busts: Martial, Joao Felix, Fabio Silva, Saviola, Renato Sanches, Luke Shaw, maybe Fofana.\nThe rest are somewhere in the middle or too soon to tell, like Onana.\nBut how would anyone have been able to tell in advance? And can anyone pinpoint what went wrong with the busts? Were they badly coached, or at the wrong club? Or was something just missing in them, maybe that burning desire to be the best?\nIt's a fascinating subject.\n129 Posted 18/11/2024 at 18:17:38\nTony, as a member of the centre-back union, and a footballing playing one, I agree. You need anticipation, reading of the game and the ability to pass it out to the midfield.\nI played a few times against a player who played alongside Dwight Yorke for Trinidad and Tobago. Proper handful who left me with a few bruises!!\n130 Posted 18/11/2024 at 19:01:41\nGod loves us left-footers!\n131 Posted 18/11/2024 at 19:10:45\nYes, I used to reply to your many posts praising Onana but then eased off, especially since he left to go to Villa. In fact, I might not have mentioned him and how he performs for them but I don't think I could ever be accused of over hyping a player, Although I used to go a bundle on Liam Walsh when he was in Everton's Academy; I thought he had everything in a young midfielder to make the grade,\nHe joined Luton Town in the summer after turning down a new contract at Swansea. I met him at a party in the summer and had a good chat to him about his career at Everton and how I thought he would one day play in the Premier League.\nI think he appreciated the praise I gave him but said to me “You do know I'm a Red Nose, don't you?” I just replied, “Well no one is fuckin' perfect, Liam!”\n132 Posted 18/11/2024 at 19:14:27\nI think Dyche, had those key ingredients you mention Danny, otherwise he wouldn’t have played so many league games as a converted central defender, and when they tried to convert me to a left back, I much preferred playing with a workmanlike wide player, because they always offered me a lot more protection, than a natural winger.\nIf you don’t have pace, you need protecting and because football, has always been about the ability of your players, then maybe Dyche has been over compensating because of the distinct lack of pace in our back four?\nI would guess that the three examples that you used to describe the busts, will have all contributed to a young footballer, not kicking on Mike, with another thing being the rewards of a massive financial contract at such an early age, must surely go to a many a young kids head?\nThey say the old ones are the best Mark, so it depends where you got left back!\n133 Posted 18/11/2024 at 19:32:58\nI'm surprised how mature most of the young players are considering the money they are now paid.\n134 Posted 18/11/2024 at 19:37:33\nI got convinced that I should play centre-back, which I reluctantly agreed to and was good for me.\n135 Posted 18/11/2024 at 20:33:06\nNeedless to say, he didn't — certainly not playing as badly as he did from Day 1.”\nPeter (33), you miss the point that your summation of the player was based solely on what you saw when he did actually get to play, unless you had followed his career in Italy and / or got to scrutinise training at Finch Farm.\nIf you only saw him when he got to play then you can only say he certainly didn't do enough to retain his place.\nJust seems peculiar to me to be so sure of a characterisation of someone based on fractional / circumstantial evidence.\n136 Posted 18/11/2024 at 22:15:35\nWhat exactly is your point, Si?\nHow else am I to judge a player? On how nice he was to his landlady? How many pictures he posed for?\n137 Posted 19/11/2024 at 01:31:53\nI was a member of the same union, but I was never a footballer. Didn't want the ball at my feet at all.\nI can say I was an excellent one-touch passer, but I learned that knack out of necessity.\n138 Posted 19/11/2024 at 01:49:22\nHow else am I to judge other posters?\n139 Posted 19/11/2024 at 07:15:11\nI've been saying for ages we're too narrow.\n140 Posted 19/11/2024 at 07:19:27\nI was a ball-playing centre-back. We played a 3-5-2 for years and won the Army League 6 times in 8 seasons. I could play either side of the 3, as I could use both feet. We had a 6ft-6in player who generally challenged as we covered. It was a good system.\nI sometimes even got pushed up into midfield. At my own level, which was a decent standard, I was pretty versatile.\n141 Posted 19/11/2024 at 08:40:32\nBoth are playing well at a higher level… whereas we seem to turn players into sulking, unhappy misfits. Something rotten in the state of Finch Farm.\n142 Posted 19/11/2024 at 09:00:16\nI think the heavy price tag made his life difficult, as he never looked like a player worth 30 million plus.\nWe will need to be brave enough to sign young talent earlier in their careers, as the Moshiri era of blowing 25 million plus on players is going to be a distant memory for a while.\n143 Posted 19/11/2024 at 09:20:32\nNo, the price we paid for Onana never had any effect on how I judged him. When a player continually goes missing from a game, you certainly notice it. Those little spells when he showed some talent didn't make up for those long spells out of the game.\nHe scored few goals and not many assists so, to me, he was over-hyped by many Everton fans. He could never be remembered, by me, for his time at Everton except for telling the crowd to support us by winning a throw-in or his after-game cheerleading, he is doing the same at Villa with their fans!\nOh, hang on – we did make a profit on his deal or we will when it is all sorted out.\n144 Posted 19/11/2024 at 09:44:11\nYes we've splashed out on players who haven't lived up to expectation. Onana frustrated because you could see the potential, but we only saw it in glimpses. Maybe because he was in a struggling team? Let's see how he goes at Villa.\nIn terms of transfer fees, all clubs spend. But we picked up Calvert-Lewin for £1.5M and Branthwaite for £1M.\nIt is often how you spend, not what you spend.\nJudge them on what they do on the pitch.\n145 Posted 19/11/2024 at 14:02:54\nI agree we have unearthed quality in Stones, Branthwaite and Calvert-Lewin, but they are the exception over the last 8 years, not the rule.\nWe have squandered a lot more in transfer fees and salaries on the likes of Schneiderlin, Williams, Klaasen, Sigurdsson, Walcott, Tosun, Bolasie, Keane, Ramirez, Gomes, Mina, Bernard, Gbamin, Delph, Kean, Godfrey, Allan, Rondon, Maupay and, indeed, Onana. A few were unlucky with injuries, but none of them represented value.\nIf there was a transfer strategy behind the purchase of the above list, then it is beyond the grasp of most Everton fans to understand.\nI think the majority of supporters see it for what it was – dysfunctionality and gross incompetence that nearly destroyed the club.\n146 Posted 19/11/2024 at 14:11:32\nIt's all down to opinion. I judge on what players do on the pitch, not how much they cost.\nNdiaye, possibly our best performer this season, cost around £16M.\n147 Posted 19/11/2024 at 14:27:11\nYou are having to go back to the early Moyes days to find another example. Moyes did find value as he had to with an annual transfer budget of £5M.\nWhether you judge the players signed since 2016 on performances, transfer fees or wages, the vast majority of players brought in have not been a success.\nThe Ndiaye transfer fee or below will be the model going forward. And we will have to find more value in that price range than we have managed with Patterson and Mykolenko for example (£29M spent).\n148 Posted 19/11/2024 at 14:48:33\n149 Posted 19/11/2024 at 15:05:01\nDominic and Branthwaite were not early Moyes years.\nThe point is about judging players on what they do on the pitch, not the price tag.\n150 Posted 19/11/2024 at 15:46:49\nNot sure why quite a few fans think Patterson is a top player, any ideas?\nTo me, he looks very vulnerable in defence which is kind of the normal for modern fullbacks.\nHe hasn't got a load of pace and, from what I have seen, his link-up and quality is no better than what we have.\nHe has been unlucky with injuries, I just can't see him as a regular in the first team. Maybe he can play right wing?\n151 Posted 19/11/2024 at 16:59:30\nI spent the next 20 years captaining teams from the back in the over-35 league in San Francisco. Played with and against retired internationals and pros, mostly from Latin America. I wasn't very good, but I was almost never beaten. Won a lot of games but no silverware.\nI dropped back to lower-level open Sunday league in my late 50s, played through the cancer, and would still be playing if it hadn't been, ironically, for a slide tackle. I put one in on a 19-year-old junior college player, and it was maybe my best ever, but my Achilles blew out.\nNow I just ref indoors.\n152 Posted 19/11/2024 at 17:14:22\nI agree we're likely to focus on £20M and under signings. I think that's generally the right thing to do too – except maybe a few particularly key individuals.\nMike mentioned the most expensive teenagers of all time earlier the thread. Many flopped. That's true of all transfers.\nIt seems to me that we manage this risk by buying a fairly high volume of young players but at lower cost than Kean. Many very high potential players can be bought for sub £15M or even sub £5M (as Branthwaite and Stones have shown).\nI wouldn't get too sentimental about Lookman etc. The tragedy isn't that we sold him too early – it's that we didn't increase our chance of a more immediate success by buying more like him from the lower leagues – like Eze and Olise for example.\n153 Posted 19/11/2024 at 18:15:43\nI can't comment on the level you played at but if it included ex pros then it can't have been that low. I played school and Uni level and tried to keep going with a local side but eventually called it a day in my mid-30s when a 19-year-old ran rings around me. No fun at all. I'd dropped back from winger to full-back by then but wasn't enough, legs had gone.\nBravo for still trying to play. I can barely walk the next day after a 6-aside match. Have to make do with golf and paddle(!) these days in my 40s. Guess the early years beer and cigs didn't aid sporting longevity.\nInteresting to read the level TWers played at. Some at fairly high levels.\n154 Posted 19/11/2024 at 18:29:11\nIt's the same when I attend, but recently, I've been watching the clock as much as Everton, trying to use psychic powers to run it down!!\nI played to a high standard, but my lasting memory will always be my trials at Bellefield, even though I didn't cut it, but it was an experience.\n155 Posted 19/11/2024 at 19:20:59\nWasn't deemed good enough to play for district or county level but ended up playing twice for England FA Colts XI whilst at school.\nFirst game played left back and had an assured game, so much so that unknown to me, some more scouts from South London clubs were brought in to watch the games. They needn't have bothered if they'd just come to see me as I was given the run around by the right winger. I was completely out of my depth and was taken off after approximately 20 mins. The only redeeming feature of my performance was that it was nil nil when I went off and our team then lost 2 nil. Definitely left back in the changing room was the true state of my ability that day !\nI sort of stopped playing senior football at about 25 due to work commitments and being only able to play once every 3 weeks wasn't fit enough.\nI restarted playing when I was 30 and had lost whatever talent I had possessed. I would have easily fit in to the current Everton team as I seemed unable to control the ball or pass the ball successfully more than 2 yards. Had lost the strength in my legs...\nI gave up and about 5 years later started playing 5 a side footie and spent most of the time being run ragged and going around in circles. I gave up for the last time when I started deliberately kicking/fouling the opposition and my last memory of playing was effectively sending myself off before the ref did...\n156 Posted 19/11/2024 at 19:21:47\n157 Posted 19/11/2024 at 19:30:05\nIt's good to talk about the game we played and support, no matter what level.\nSaturday is coming. I feels like an eternity since the last one. I'll see some of you around County Road and then I'm back up for the evening kick-off against Wolves.\nIn between, my Chelsea cousin is taking me to watch Chelsea on the box, with his mates, who seem to have adopted me!!\n158 Posted 19/11/2024 at 20:53:57\nEvery year, the first XI would reach and win the Lancashire Grammar Schools shield. We would go en bloc via Corporation buses to Liverpool University or Penny Lane.\nEach year, the association president would congratulate the school and then thank the school for allowing the other schools to take part in the competition, such was their dominance. The team was coached by metalworker teacher, Jimmy Dewsnip who had connections with the Blues.\nI was included in the Under-15s school trial and played at left back for the 'possibles' versus the 'probables'. Into the second half. a corner comes in, a flash of the right foot, a screaming volley into the top corner, keeper well beaten Bloody own goal wasn't it?\nI turned to playing basketball which was just taking off in schools at the time!\n159 Posted 19/11/2024 at 23:20:12\nHearing applause as I picked myself off the floor, I assumed I had defended the corner succesfully. Seems not. :)\n160 Posted 19/11/2024 at 00:07:13\nBiggest regret for me though is when we had the chance to sign Viktor Gyökeres from Coventry and missed the opportunity due to our finances.\n161 Posted 20/11/2024 at 00:58:40\n162 Posted 20/11/2024 at 01:13:59\nI never even got close enough to say hello. Every time I tried to play him, he was just gone. People were actually laughing out loud in the stands. I was subbed off around 40 minutes because they literally thought I couldn't make it to halftime. Ultimate embarrassment.\nAnd because he left quickly after the game, I never even got to meet Hugo.\n163 Posted 20/11/2024 at 01:18:34\nHe did get a chance in the Premier League, finally, but flopped at West Ham. He's now carving out a pretty good career in Serie A.\n164 Posted 20/11/2024 at 07:32:43\nDoes Per Krøldrup warrant a mention given the title of the thread?\nIan, I never managed an own-goal. I went close on one occasion. The keeper had been done, so instinctively, I took up a position on the line. As the shot came, it hit my shin and came onto the post. Fortunately, it went the right way and I cleared.\n165 Posted 20/11/2024 at 08:25:44\nKoeman and Walsh, got the ball rolling and I don’t think we have ever recovered from winning that transfer window🙈\n166 Posted 20/11/2024 at 08:47:55\nThey all came with different things. Or worse, too much of the same!!\nIf you don't laugh, you cry.\n167 Posted 20/11/2024 at 08:56:28\nI used to play 7 days a week at a very basic level but to a decent standard - I was fast and could hit a shot. Used to play right wing or the modern equivalent and the best team was 'juniorish' team that had a 100% win record one year. That team included nobody who went on to better things except perhaps Vic Marks who became an England cricketer.\nMore recently it's been 5-a-side before I stopped playing about 15 years ago aged 55ish. Last year, aged 70 (but reasonably fit) I joined a local walking football group that had started up and it was staggering. Great camaraderie, Incredibly good work out and actually hard not to commit the obvious foul by breaking into a run. Do that 3 times in a game and the team automatically concedes a penalty!\nIt's far more demanding than one would think and (not necessarily to its credit) there are the usual tally of injuries - myself included with a medial meniscus tear last year which was 20 weeks on the sidelines. I suppose at our ages we will be more susceptible.\nAnyway just thought I'd ask as no-one has mentioned it. We all move on past our physical best (despite what we like to tell ourselves) and as much as anything else, for a number of people, there are immense mental health advantages - I have seen that first hand - and as the fastest growing participation sport in the UK (I've heard) is a great option for those of us who have been missing playing the game.\nPs...is anyone else having problems with the functioning of this website...like constantly asking for cookie acceptance, edit button not working, jump to last post button not working etc etc?\n168 Posted 20/11/2024 at 09:00:37\nMy father and Uncles had played at higher levels which included Soccer and Cricket.One Uncle in particular was exceptional.But they all suffered bans from the GAA.My father for attending a Soccer International in Belfast.He was about to start in a Final when he noticed the bus conductor, of the Belfast Bus, a opposition supporter, in discussion on the sidelines with Officals.He was called of the pitch and banned.\nIn that game on Highbury Fields those Youths put into practise what I had drummed into me by my father and Uncles.There main player acknowledged I did know what to do.They whipped the Company team, though alot younger.\nLike everybody I had some shockers.\n169 Posted 20/11/2024 at 09:09:23\nThere are absolutely dozens of highly technical midfield players moving in particular - many of whom flop unfortunately.\nBut Vlasic stood out in that league at 19 and in youth internationals and was always destined for a big club move.\nDoubt Koeman had heard of him but then that wasn't really his job.\n170 Posted 20/11/2024 at 09:10:31\nThere is a GAA club near to me and when we were in the Sangers at Crossmaglen, we used to watch them on the pitch out of the back.\nMy local Irish Pub often puts the matches on. I have to admit, it confuses the heck out me. As not being educated, the players seem to be able to do everything!!\nYou can probably inform me better, but it seems closely linked to Australian rules football??\n171 Posted 20/11/2024 at 09:17:30\nI believe that, if you haven't got a method, you are always going to fail, and although people will argue differently, I believe if you have got a method, then you have got a very good chance of succeeding, just as long as you have got the inclination and the ability.\nI've said it enough, I'll always say it until I'm blue in the face, and that's why I'm hoping the Friedkins have got a long drawn-out plan along those lines🤞\n172 Posted 20/11/2024 at 09:23:13\nStill, he obviously is a useful player and he won't be the last forward from Italy to struggle in the Premier League.\n173 Posted 20/11/2024 at 09:32:17\nThey all seemed demoralised soon after joining - probably because they could see it was a mess and unlikely to work out\n174 Posted 20/11/2024 at 09:55:22\nI'm looking forward to the match day thread being posted. It feels like an eternity, however there has been some good conversation to keep us all occupied.\nI'm travelling up early, as I'm going to Allerton Cemetery first to lay flowers on my Nan's stone. Then onto Goodison and the usual haunts. Back to London the same day and then off to my Cousin's in Essex on Sunday, before heading home.\nEven by my standards, that is some round trip!!!\n175 Posted 20/11/2024 at 10:19:04\nAt 66 I'm one of the younger and certainly amongst the fittest, if not the fittest, so I'm loving it and even getting tempted back to the \"proper\" game. Its not actually limited to walking - if you can run, you can, but its pretty contactless - no slideys and no tackling from behind...and no over head height in the winter.\nIn proper footy, I once \"marked\" Taribo West whilst playing at Worldnet for Everton Vets. I was left back and he played right wing for Arsenal Nigeria Vets, our nemesis. It was the semi final. I stuck tight to him and was having a relatively easy time of it until he exploded - twice - passed me like I wasn't there and crossed for their two goals. I didn't stand a chance. They beat us but we got revenge twice in later years (I'm talking in the last 10 years btw) including in the final to win it. (he didn't play).\nI've played against other pro's, Nicky Forster, Ian Pearce, to name but two, and with a Scottish centre forward who replaced Big Dunc at Dundee Utd, and scored against Rangers in the Scottish cup final - Craig Brewster. and they could all do things with a ball that even the best amateurs I've seen couldn't dream of but. Forgive me, the best I've played against was an aging, arthritic, bow-legged, Ray Houghton. He could barely move but was untouchable, simply standing in the middle and directing the game, pinging it to team mates with barely a glance. Younger tyros, determined to take his scalp, went flying past him in raking slide tackles as he shimmied his hips and sent them the wrong way. He took the \"Kopites are Gobshites\" banter very well with a smile and was a gent. But he showed me the massive gulf in class between a top pro and the best of the rest.\nI wish I could still play proper footy but I'm enjoying a new lease of life with the \"walking\" footy. I recommend it.\n176 Posted 20/11/2024 at 10:51:05\nI think that in some of your earlier posts you suggest that most Premier League clubs just go out and buy replacements rather than developing their own players. I agree that now has become the norm, but that raises the question: If we are producing so little talent from our academies is it worth the cost of having one?\nI know some will say that the sale of Rooney and Barkley justify having academies… but does it? I know Keegan when managing Newcastle said scrapping their academy system should be considered.\nChelsea used their academy to buy top young players from around mainly Europe then as they developed they were sent on loan to mainly other Premier League clubs, which meant these players weren't good enough to get in Chelsea's team but were getting Premier league experience elsewhere while not costing Chelsea a penny in wages.\nThen, when the loan came to an end, they were usually sold to the club they were on loan to or brought back to Chelsea to join their first-team squad.\n177 Posted 20/11/2024 at 11:29:04\nI know Moshiri has become enemy number one but he was badly let down by the people in charge of signing players.\nYou could argue if the player signings had been better we wouldn't have had the turnover of managers and players that has occurred.\nIn the end, it's all about results, if they are positive, everyone's happy.\nWith regard to Kean, as a young player you have to be a pretty special player as a forward to get a regular place in a Premiership side. He looked decent without being special, but theres a lot of different factors that can happen that prevents him being at his best.\n178 Posted 20/11/2024 at 11:36:07\nBrian & Robert, I've always maintained that if the development system was fit for purpose, clubs wouldn't have to go elsewhere. Look at every Premier League club. Every English club for that matter.\n179 Posted 20/11/2024 at 11:45:57\nWas it Brenford who, a few years ago now, got rid of theirs… only to find out that being in the Premier League included the requirement that they maintain an Academy and put forward teams to complete in PL2 and the U18 development league?\nYou could argue that the money is largely wasted… however, from a PSR perspective, academy costs are exempt and do not count toward the balance sheet for calculating PSR losses.\nNo doubt the numbers are closely scrutinized but surely it should not be beyond the wit and wisdom of our beloved club custodians to figure out ways to absolutely maximize such allowable deductions in our favour?\nNo??? Thought not!\n180 Posted 20/11/2024 at 11:50:55\nWe, like other clubs, all need to develop young players to avoid an unsustainable transfer market.\nThat helps to create a flow of quality players to the first team - or for sale.\nIf you have a player of outstanding talent at 18 / 19 then play him - as most clubs do with players who go on to have England careers etc. Like Mainoo, Lewis and Alexander-Arnold for example. Or Ball, Jeffers, Dunne, Rodwell etc.\nIf they're not quite there then put them out on loan at as high a level as possible. The experience helps them en route to the first team - like Gordon. Or demonstrates enough to get a fee - eg Simms and Cannon.\nWithout experience, Dixon is probably best sent on loan. In the meantime we can see if Patterson is any good.\nBut really neither Patterson nor Dixon looks likely to be a top class right-back any time soon. Surely then if we have some money to spare we buy someone genuinely good. Like Sildillia or Dedic or AN Other.\nI don't want okay players. I want excellent players.\n181 Posted 20/11/2024 at 11:53:05\nI am considering walking football when I move down to Dorset. Some who last saw me playing football would say walking football is ideal for me as that's all I was good for. :)\n182 Posted 20/11/2024 at 12:20:11\nBrian #176. I work with a group of Chelsea fans who still cannot believe that the Mo Salah who plays for Liverpool is the same Mo Salah who looked pretty average when he played a few games for them in his early 20s (they make similar remarks about the young Romelu Lukaku and the young Kevin de Bruyne). In fairness though they managed to make a profit on all 3 when selling them on.\n183 Posted 20/11/2024 at 12:21:33\nMark your game sounds like some sort of hybrid. No 11 a-side games here, and tbh on a big pitch that seems stretching things a bit. Most of our games are on indoor 5-a-side pitches but the occasional tournament outdoors on grass or astro.\nIan - you should give it a go. One plays at ones own level and it is good fun but can be knackering. We tend to play 2 hours, with 3 teams 15 minute games, 30 on 15 off so usually about 75 minutes of playing time. Our group started in March last year and we now have about 30 players including a couple of quite useful ladies ( they qualify at age 40). As Mark says, no physical contact in the rules but it does happen. Definitely no slideys. I managed a cracked rib this year (that was falling on the ball after a trip!) as well as the meniscus last year.\nGreat way to get to know people as well if you're new to an area.\n184 Posted 20/11/2024 at 13:18:23\nWhat he lacked in skill, he made up for 100% in effort, harshly treated and made an example of for simulation ban.\nNever quite made it, but one of those players you were willing on to score a goal. If his feet could work as quick as his brain, he could have been a contender.\nAnother player I would throw in the mix is Jelavic, unbelievable one touch finishing, got injured against Newcastle when he collided with the goal post and never seemed to be the same player, when he returned from injury.\n186 Posted 20/11/2024 at 13:32:37\nThere are similarities between Gaelic Football and Australian Rules.Though the latter is officially Professional. Ireland and Australian play International Tests under Compromised Rules.You will see on You Tube that it is not for the faint hearted.\nGaelic Football now is based Dyche like on high fitness levels, and a rigid defensive possession system, which for me has wrecked it as a spectator sport and it urgently needs rule changes. I far prefer Hurling to watch.\nI am coming round to thinking that Dyche has problems getting players to operate his 1-4-4 structure, because of his negatively to push forward in support.\nYou were quite a Footballer Danny.\nKim#183\nI have a friend(66) who took up Walking Football.I was astonished how much weight he lost and how fit he has become.It is properly regulated by Football Associations.\nRobert#180\nDyche bases alot on committment to training.His stated objective is for Everton to be the fittest team in the Premier League.\nYou do have to wonder at the Professionalism of Young to stay playing at Premier League level for so long I think that Dyche's first port of call on selection is Professional Committment to Training.\n187 Posted 20/11/2024 at 13:49:01\nMichael, yes, Brentford did and kind of went with the B Team model, although I believe they have re-opened the academy recently. Their teams used to train on the same pitches as my Hayes & Yeading youngsters.\nJelavic Brian. Fantastic for those first 6 months, when he was in the box, sweeping them in. And then the manager turned him into a corner flag chaser!!\n188 Posted 20/11/2024 at 14:06:09\n189 Posted 20/11/2024 at 14:09:55\nYes mate I have had problems where once I accept or reject privacy settings I can't \"click\" on anything else. Also a green cog icon has started appearing on the left of the page.\nI've emailed the guys about it.\n190 Posted 20/11/2024 at 14:10:10\nCheers Brian, I just clicked on 'green' coloured icon halfway up, on the left of the screen and that seems to have done the trick.\n191 Posted 20/11/2024 at 14:11:19\n192 Posted 20/11/2024 at 14:11:28\n193 Posted 20/11/2024 at 14:28:22\nMoshiri has never been enemy number one to me. I agree with you: other people were responsible for spending the vast amounts of money provided by Moshiri (and/or Usmanov?). They loved spending that money on transfer fees and ridiculous contracts; the trouble was they spent recklessly and proved that a fool and his money are easily parted.\nMoshiri trusted the wrong people and is made the scapegoat for the absolute mess the club is in now. His legacy is the brand new stadium on the River Mersey, so that majestic stadium is what I will remember him for.\n194 Posted 20/11/2024 at 14:30:59\nDave, your last paragraph says it.\n195 Posted 20/11/2024 at 14:32:34\nWhen he was played in the box, he either scored or the goalie saved it. I don't recall too many Row Z shots from him; he was totally wasted out wide.\n196 Posted 20/11/2024 at 15:55:21\nMoshiri made a massive financial commitment to the club and will walk away having lost hundreds of millions. He made his biggest mistake when he left Bill Kenwright in place as Chairman after acquiring the club; he then let him put his supporters on the board. I think Moshiri said he only wanted to spend 5% of his time actually running the club?\nTotally naive in many of his dealings, he was led a merry dance by football agents around the world. They ran rings around him and the DoFs (Walsh, then Brands). They knew better and should have protected his interests.\nAs you say, when we all sit in the wonderful new stadium, we should reflect that it was Moshiri who made it happen. I won't miss him, but I don't think badly towards him despite the recent trauma.\n197 Posted 20/11/2024 at 17:23:12\nLike you say we do have him to thank for the new stadium, I doubt it would have happened if he had not showed up.\nHe still has to sell the club though, I do hope that does not go pear shaped.\n198 Posted 20/11/2024 at 17:37:19\nBut I agree with you on Moshiri -- I consider him a good guy but not very bright, and doomed to failure once Usmanov and his money were suddenly blown away.\n199 Posted 20/11/2024 at 17:43:04\nK'ning 'ell even Allardyce cared. apart from that he was a lovely man\n200 Posted 20/11/2024 at 17:43:37\nThe only thing I will say about him in a positive light is he fought hard to have a 60,000 stadium at Bramley Moore, but was outvoted to have a lower capacity, yes he could have had kings dock and yes, not his money, but he told each of them that a 60,000 stadium would not have any empty seats, about the only thing he did call right.\n201 Posted 20/11/2024 at 17:51:01\nUkraine has not helped anyone. Losing Finch Farm sponsership and the USM cash has not helped. It still baffles me that we haven't replaced that income.\nWhat does concern me is that we become tenants at the new ground, rather than homeowners. We follow the model of charging rent for something we should own.\n202 Posted 20/11/2024 at 17:52:25\nBrian #200, if Kenwright \"played Moshiri like a fiddle\", how did we wind up with Benitez as our manager? I think you overrate Kenwright's influence.\n203 Posted 20/11/2024 at 18:06:12\nIt still baffles me that we haven't replaced that income.\nIt just shows how important that sponsorship was to us, and how poor our commercial department have been as our income took a big hit and we have struggled to regain that lost money.\nIt still grates massively that The Ukraine War and resulting lost sponsorship should have been such an obvious no-brainer mitigation for our PSR woes but somehow (probably because Moshiri himself and not a bigwig KC was putting forward the argument), the first independent commission was able to reject this on the ground of \"normal business uncertainty\". What absolute bollocks that was.\n205 Posted 20/11/2024 at 19:23:15\nKenwright probably wouldn't have sold Everton if this wasn't part of the sale, which obviously means that Moshiri's biggest mistake was buying Everton in the first place!\nI heard it was Usmanov who told Kenwright to be quiet during one Zoom call when they were interviewing Benitez, telling him that he was the one who had not only spent a lot of money on Everton but intended on spending a lot more. Not that Benitez got any!!\n206 Posted 20/11/2024 at 19:51:10\nI think football bored him intensely, and he thought it was a thousand leagues beneath him. Which does beg the question: Why on earth did he buy us?\nI think there were good reasons, none of them related to a footballing ambition. I think moving and cleaning money was a reason; also getting a foothold at a strategically important place in the West.\nI think Liverpool the port is set for better times, particularly with the decline in air travel. And football as a business is only going to grow.\nHe also picked the club up for a song. It felt like when he was spending, it was with the attitude: \"Okay, here's a load of money, now leave me alone!\"\n207 Posted 20/11/2024 at 19:56:22\nWould be interesting if, after he sells, Moshiri were to come out and outline where he thinks it all went wrong. I really doubt though keeping Blue Bill on as Chair would rank highly with Moshiri.\n208 Posted 20/11/2024 at 19:57:08\nIf you think Benitez was a scumbag, how would describe Kenwright and Barrett-Baxendale?\n209 Posted 20/11/2024 at 20:16:37\n210 Posted 20/11/2024 at 22:04:58\nIt doesn't really matter because the past is in the past and the era of the longest period without a trophy will hopefully never be surpassed but it does leave me shaking my head when I read some of the opinions on this website which try and absolve the most self-centred and poisonous individual ever connected to Everton for the damage that he did.\nPlucky little Everton, punching above their weight, and still people call him Blue Bill. Hurry up and get here, Freidkins!!!\nI drove along Commercial Road before and, with the dusk beginning to settle on our city, I have to say the picture of the new stadium lit up in blue on the horizon looked absolutely fantastic, so thank you very much, Big Al – I just hope your mate doesn't blow it up!\n211 Posted 20/11/2024 at 22:10:19\nRe read your original post. Crossnaglen was some spot. I went to see a customer for the firm I got a job with to sort out accounts when I came back from London. It was like the Wild West, wind whistling in my ears. The customer later known as Cuisine de France gave me a huge order. The firm I worked for would not deliver it, because they were afraid of losing their lorry.\nThe second time I went, I got caught up in a huge traffic jam. A bare-knuckle fighting competition was going on in the square.\nCrossmaglen GAA later became All Ireland Champions. The Manager was supposed to be an amatuer, but was on £70,000 per year. The GAA changed after that.\n212 Posted 20/11/2024 at 22:28:22\nMoshiri is the owner... they are the guys who write the confidentiality agreements... not sign them.\nSo he's more than free to tell his truth although I suspect he won't be arsed. He's made more than enough mistakes.\n213 Posted 21/11/2024 at 12:20:19\nHe'll be lucky to walk away with 10% of that.\n214 Posted 21/11/2024 at 16:46:18\n215 Posted 21/11/2024 at 17:45:10\nBoth Moshiri and his backer have lost hundreds of millions, yet Kenwright remained. The greatest mystery is why Moshiri persisted with him given his propensity for firing managers — unless of course it was a clause in the sale of shares agreement. He was nearly the death of us.\n216 Posted 21/11/2024 at 18:28:53\nI have supported the club since 1960 and that man single-handedly caused more damage to the club than anyone I've known.\n217 Posted 21/11/2024 at 23:49:35\nNo mystery. Moshiri never believed that the Board mattered. It was the manager and funding and he thought he could deliver both.\nBlue Bill & the Board could look after the 95% stuff that didn't matter whilst Moshiri would spend his time on the important 5% picking a name and backing them financially.\nKoeman, Benitez, Ancelotti... even Lampard and Big Sam. There's a pattern there.\n218 Posted 22/11/2024 at 02:30:40\nHe had had enough of Bill's appointments and spending and thought he could do better... he only made matters worse. He lost the backing of his mate when sanctions hit and the money was gone. The backing was gone and he was too far in to bail...\nSince then, it's been subsistence living and hanging on till someone, anyone, came up with an offer. His legacy will be forever a magnificent stadium – at least he has a legacy… his chairman cashed his in.\n219 Posted 22/11/2024 at 09:42:32\nYou seem to be saying that, prior to Fat Sam, Kenwright was responsible for the appointment and spending decisions?\nThat was never the case. Those big decisions were always under Moshiri's control.\n220 Posted 22/11/2024 at 10:39:24\nMisfits, Mysteries and Nearly-Men, the Story of Everton in the 21st Century. There would be a great book in there somewhere. Would it be under Comedy or Horror stories though???\n221 Posted 22/11/2024 at 11:26:50\nBig Sam was brought in by Moshiri to ensure Premier League status but it also, for me, saw the end of any involvement of Kenwright in managerial selection. I believe it was a failure of trust in each other with relationships being cordial at best in the end.\nBoth are culpable but the rot started long before Moshiri came on the scene. We will never read the true story of the past 30 years, too many confidentiality agreements (I bet the Wyness one ended not long ago) but, in the end, what facts we do have are not enough to proportion quantifiable blame to each, but together it makes unpleasant reading without adding the speculation of exactly who is to blame for each and every decision.\nWhat matters is where we are now, how we go forward and how do we prevent it happening again?\n222 Posted 22/11/2024 at 12:21:43\nThere's very little to suggest that Blue Bill had much influence in even the early managerial appointments under Moshiri.\nIt was generally accepted at the time that Kenwright wanted to give Martinez another season. Moshiri sacked him.\nKoeman was very clearly a Moshiri choice. I'm paraphrasing but he said something about bringing a \"Hollywood\" name to Everton.\nAnd I seriously doubt Silva was on Blue Bill's radar.\nOf course, we need to move on and learn from past mistakes but insisting on an equivalence of blame which isn't really there won't aid that process.\n223 Posted 22/11/2024 at 12:34:27\nNext, you will be saying it was all done in spite of Kenwright's protests!\n224 Posted 22/11/2024 at 13:24:06\nThat would be an equally ridiculous argument to try and make.\n225 Posted 22/11/2024 at 14:00:26\nAncelotti's son gave an interview stating how strange his father found it when the chairman used to lead the transfer committee. No transfer recommendation would go to Moshiri until Bill had signed it off.\nHe chaired the board and the appointees were broadly his recommendations.\nHe was also at the table when every managerial interview and appointment decision was made.\nSo equivalence of blame? 100% right.\n226 Posted 22/11/2024 at 14:13:19\nThanks to ToffeeWeb I rarely miss anything Everton related but I missed that interview by Davide. I'm surprised given that it points to Blue Bill having such power that it isn't permanently pinned to this website.\nIt also contradicts Christine's suggestion that by the time Carlo came on board Moshiri had basically sidelined Blue Bill.\n227 Posted 22/11/2024 at 14:21:44\nThe interview Davide Ancelotti did stating Kenwright was responsible for all signings is a bit more difficult to find.\nA link or a direct quote may add a little substance…\n228 Posted 22/11/2024 at 14:29:34\nDavide Ancelotti:\n\"However during this time problems began, there was a number of disagreements with the Director of Football (Marcel Brands) on strategy.\nHe (Brands) wanted players which we felt weren't the right fit for Everton, in the end we came to an agreement on the players we would pursue but this was a long and difficult process.\nThe Chairman (Bill Kenwright who passed away in October 2023) would often sit in at these meetings giving advice which we found strange as this was something I had not seen at other football clubs.\"\nPaints a rather different picture from what you are suggesting.\n229 Posted 22/11/2024 at 15:25:25\nThanks, a valuable insight. I always got the impression, true or false, that Brands was accommodating someone else's agenda.\nBrands for me was essentially weak regarding his own self-determination, but with backing, he would push an agenda which was not his own.\nIf Brands wheeled out did not achieve the objective, then other parties were brought into play.\nThe level of manipulation in the club was brought home to me by the time preparation length led by Barrett-Baxendale put into countering the fan-lead review.\n230 Posted 22/11/2024 at 20:35:02\nPower and influence...\n231 Posted 22/11/2024 at 20:47:16\n232 Posted 22/11/2024 at 21:04:11\n233 Posted 22/11/2024 at 21:20:20\nYou're going to have to give me more than that if you want to play.\n234 Posted 22/11/2024 at 21:24:28\nInvoking the Daily Mail... sure sign you're losing the argument.\n235 Posted 22/11/2024 at 21:36:23\nSnigger at the use of the rag that is the Mail, but it was a piece specifically written to outline the influence, power and ties behind the decision-making in our club. I have yet to see any such piece that contradicts that view. Can you provide one?\n236 Posted 22/11/2024 at 21:43:47\nNo sniggering...my enemy's enemy is my friend.\nNever believed in that.\nDavide Ancelotti has basically said that Blue Bill wasn't the kingpin when it came to transfers but even when it comes out of the horses mouth...\n237 Posted 22/11/2024 at 22:20:14\nGiven the appointments of Koeman and Silva as known Moshiri picks, I can't see how anyone can suggest he wasn't in total control.\nMy view is Kenwright would probably offer opinion but, if Moshiri didn't fancy it, he went his own way. The hanging of Kenwright after his death is for his haters.\n238 Posted 22/11/2024 at 22:36:33\nNot to mention that, if Blue Bill had any real influence Moyes would have been back. You would have been apoplectic... me, not so much.\nBut it illustrates how little say he had.\n239 Posted 22/11/2024 at 22:43:01\nSounds like an argument put in a reasonable and reasoned way, regardless of whether or not one agrees with it.\n240 Posted 22/11/2024 at 22:56:27\nHe did it openly too, whilst constantly blurting to the many gullible amid us and the acquiescent media that he was the No 1 fan, above all others.\nHe fucked up the Kings Dock stadium;\nBacked that bent bastard Samuelson in a non-existent £billionaire buyout;\nSold everything the club used to own when he took over – only to expensively rent it back off its new owners (and just watch as the new stadium goes the same way, folks);\nAbolished AGMs to maintain his accountability;\nTook advice from the all but criminal Philip Green (describing him as \"the Mozart of Money\") whilst the club financially crumbled, to the cost of every genuine fan;\nSold out to a corrupt £billionaire's monkey to ensure the massive wealth of him and his family at our expense, again;\nAnd then took 95% control of the entire club to further massively damage it.\nAnd yet some people still don't see the reality of the damage we've had inflicted on us for years and years still to come as a direct consequence of his self-serving gross negligence and incompetence.\n241 Posted 22/11/2024 at 22:56:51\nVery good point re Moyes – he would have been back in the blink of an eye if left to Bill Kenwright.\n242 Posted 22/11/2024 at 22:58:38\nYou're pretty much the voice of reason (sorry) on this site.\nHope all is well with you and your good wife.\n243 Posted 22/11/2024 at 23:07:22\nNever sure who's in control here, either!\n244 Posted 22/11/2024 at 23:36:17\nI've got a sandwich board but there's no way I'm getting that lot on it.\n245 Posted 23/11/2024 at 00:14:58\nI just meant you didn't give me enough to argue with.\nI could have expressed it better.\n246 Posted 23/11/2024 at 02:44:28\nBrendan #236, and Moshiri has said that Chairman Bill was.\nSo I guess it depends on which horse you want to listen to.\n247 Posted 23/11/2024 at 02:51:23\n248 Posted 23/11/2024 at 03:11:46\nWhen the board resigned but Kenwright stayed, Paul Joyce in The Times wrote: “It is shaping up to be another crucial summer on the pitch and Moshiri also believes that Kenwright's contacts and acumen will help Everton as he works alongside the director of football, Kevin Thelwell, and the manager, Sean Dyche.\"\nHe blocked the signing of Arnautovic when Moshiri had negotiated a deal and he personally negotiated the deal to sign Dele Alli with Levy. He had his hand in everything.\nHe ran that club and Moshiri was daft enough to let him do it.\n249 Posted 23/11/2024 at 07:58:59\nRead what Davide said with an open mind,\nThere was conflict between the manager and the DOF and the Chairman sat in on those meetings at times in an advisory capacity.\nI just don't get the scent of a guy who was running things.\nNow I'm going out for my early morning walk unencumbered by any Rhodesian Ridgebacks and expect to see a fulsome apology when I return.\n250 Posted 23/11/2024 at 08:04:02\nNo quotes just \"going on memory\". It's one thing to forget something. It's another to remember something that didn't happen. It`s there in clear quotes that the Ancelottis' differences were with Marcel Brands and his choice of players.\nI think most Evertonians will have read the direct quotes from Brands which prove he was pulling the transfer strings. For me, direct quotes trump hearsay and guesswork all day long \"Kenwright was there to advise\"... So was young Mr Grace.\nChristine.\nThat article from Ian Ladyman? Really? The cheeky bastard has several nasty swipes at Evertonians before going on to spout unsubstantiated drivel. Look where he gets his information from:\n\"Friends and people in football who are fond of him\"\n\"One senior executive of another big club\"\n\"According to those who know him\"\n\"one long term ally\"\n\"According to those who know him\" - Again\n\"The experience of one football figure\"\n\"said to be disillusioned\" - By who ?\n\"A former Everton insider\"\n\"Three premier league club spokesmen\"\n\"Another source\"\n\"A football source\"\n\"a former Everton scout\"\n\"Former Everton managers\"\n\"The chief executive of one Southern club\"\n\"One friend\"\n\"Boardroom guest on match day\" _ Hehe\n\"One premier league chief executive\"\n\"Sources reveal\"\n\"Sportsmail is told\"\n\"Some supporters\"\n\"Reflects his ally\"\nConvincing…\n251 Posted 23/11/2024 at 11:17:48\nWhich one is worse depends on your perspective. Strange how suddenly those with one perspective are labelled haters by the other now, revisionism is alive and well amongst some ToffeeWeb posters.\nFor the record, some of us \"haters\" were proven correct in our beliefs all along... for goodness sake, look to the future but don't forget the reasons for the mess we are in.\n252 Posted 23/11/2024 at 11:35:12\nI'd say that the weight of evidence via quotes over the years is very much that Kenwright ran everything regarding transfers. In an era where the club was dragged down to the very edge of existence, there was one common presence and that was Kenwright as Chairman, the position where the buck stops on all issues.\nI believe that Brands was proven to be competent in many jobs but Kenwright was his boss at Everton.\n261 Posted 23/11/2024 at 20:30:38\nThanks...I think.\nNo I'm not particularly forgiving towards Blue Bill. I'm not sure what the collective noun for Football Chairman is but I think \"A c**t of chairmen\" wouldn't be very far away. And Blue Bill is no exception.\nMy problem is I think there's so much bile and disinformation peddled by people who are frankly evangelical n their \"Bill is to blame\" message that it doesn't allow for measured debate.\nI don't buy your misremembering of the Davide A. interview. In fact it rather illustrates my point. No real criticism of Blue Bill in the article...yet for some reason you remember it as damming of the man. If you hear a slogan long enough...\nBTW I wasn't always this mature...so there's still hope for you & Colin.\nNot great today though.\n262 Posted 24/11/2024 at 03:34:49\nAlthough that doesn't mean I agree with you on the article, as you are stretching the logic there. Try remembering something you read a year ago!\nNo it wasn't great v Brentford, and we can't afford many more of them. We are 8-10 points lower than we should be because we can't close out games.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
