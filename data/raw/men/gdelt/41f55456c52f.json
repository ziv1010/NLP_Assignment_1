  "body_text": "Mauricio Pochettino bounds into the interview room at Chelsea’s Cobham training ground and envelops me in a bear hug. He pulls out his phone and tells me he wants to record a quick video to send to Harry Kane, his former player at Tottenham Hotspur who recently moved to Bayern Munich, and before I know it he is looking into the camera saying: “Harry, we have signed Alan and he is going to score more goals, sorry,” and then he presses send.\nAdvertisement\nBy the time we sit down, I’m still chuckling and my head is swelling — Mauricio reckons my Premier League goalscoring record is “safe” now that Harry is in Germany, although I’m less sure about that — and by the time our conversation ends an hour or so later, I can envisage what it must be like to play for this man. He is so enthusiastic and engaging, so passionate and candid. A real player’s manager, someone you’d run through a brick wall for.\nAfter another manic summer of splurge and change — Chelsea have spent in the region of £330million ($417million) according to transfermarkt.co.uk and may not be done just yet — I also have a better understanding of Mauricio’s remit at Stamford Bridge, where he must nurture a young squad at the same time as winning. “That is the objective because if Chelsea don’t win titles then for sure we are going to talk about the project failing,” he admits.\nBuilding takes time and the demand to win is immediate; we had a glimpse of those competing pressures last season when Graham Potter arrived on a long-term, wrong-term contract and quickly left. I’d back Mauricio to do it. He lifted Spurs into the elite, his last posting was at Paris Saint-Germain, that house of towering egos, and, as a coach, his influence can be felt across the Premier League. Unlike some of his predecessors, he has the personal touch.\n“It’s exciting to come back,” he says. “After leaving a great experience in France, this was the priority. Here, you feel alive.”\nBefore we dive in deeper, here are some headlines from our chat.\n- With Spurs unwilling to deal with an English rival this summer, there was no chance of Chelsea signing Harry, in spite of Mauricio’s enduring relationship with the England captain. “I don’t know in the future, but in the past? No. In the future in football, you never know what is going to happen,” he says.\n- Chelsea “are talking” about signing another forward after recent injuries to Christopher Nkunku and Carney Chukwuemeka, but Mauricio has not completely ruled out rehabilitating Romelu Lukaku, who has been training with the club’s under-21 players, which he calls “a decision from both sides before we arrived”.\n- Mauricio denies reports that returning to the Spurs dugout, either before or after Antonio Conte’s spell as head coach, was ever viable. “No, no, no, no, no,” he says. “Never. There was too much news (about it) and maybe the fans talked but it never was an option.”\n- Moises Caicedo, Chelsea’s British record £115million signing from Brighton, will need “time” to prove he is the “best in the Premier League”.\n- He has offered to help Dele Alli “in any circumstance” after his former player at Spurs recently revealed he was abused as a child. Mauricio says Sir Alex Ferguson once told him Manchester United would buy Dele for £100million.\n- Mauricio believes his “strength and weakness” as a coach is his close relationship to his players.\n- He thinks too many Premier League teams now play out from the back, a style Mauricio first developed when he arrived at Southampton in 2013. “It’s like it was contagious,” he says.\n- PSG “were only interested in one trophy, that was the Champions League and it’s not easy to win the Champions League”, he says.\nThere is a lot to go on.\n- Transfer news — live updates\n- The Athletic Insiders WhatsApp group\n- Premier League done deals\n- Daily Football Briefing podcast — your 10-minute lowdown\nThe season is only two games old and it still feels like summer, like early days. The big window in the media room looks out on a pristine practice pitch, the grass as green and inviting as the deep blue of a swimming pool. Mauricio is still commuting to the training ground from a rented apartment in central London, an hour or so away, but this afternoon, once our interview is done, will be spent house-hunting in the leafy streets around Cobham.\nAdvertisement\nThat morning was spent in the team meeting room with his players and staff, debriefing after their disappointing 3-1 defeat away to West Ham on Sunday. Theirs has been a mixed opening, a vivid and encouraging 1-1 draw at home to Liverpool and then a game in which they mustered 76 per cent possession and 17 shots and still lost, when they played against 10 men for nearly 30 minutes and Caicedo conceded a penalty. Welcome to Chelsea.\n“It was a good start against Liverpool with many positives and then we didn’t translate all those positives to West Ham,” Mauricio says. “We started well but then we didn’t compete in the way the game demanded and we were not clinical. We were talking today with the whole squad about how to improve. It wasn’t a criticism. We just need to settle everything, to able to play in a different way, to be more compact, to sometimes be more naughty, to be more competitive.”\n“Settle” is a word he uses a lot.\nIn some ways, it is a surprise to see him here at all. When I think back to his time at Spurs, the Battle of the Bridge in May 2016 comes tumbling to the forefront of my mind, an incredible, brutal 2-2 draw when Tottenham were chasing Leicester City at the top of the table and Chelsea’s players had made it plain they did not want their London rivals to win the title. Nine of Mauricio’s team were booked, a record in the Premier League.\nHe laughs and says: “It’s true,” when I say I bet he wouldn’t have envisaged ending up as Chelsea’s manager back then. “Amazing memories,” he says. “After two years in Tottenham, we were fighting for the big things like the Premier League when no one expected it and Chelsea were in a different position to us, in the middle of the league and fighting for nothing and playing for nothing.\n“A few things happened and it felt like everyone was against us and everything went for Leicester and big credit to them, it was a nice history to build for the Premier League and to sell it outside of England. But some Chelsea players were talking about preferring Leicester to win the league and some of ours were a little bit upset about the situation — ‘they are not professional because they are talking in the media like this’.\nAdvertisement\n“It was difficult to stop. The game was really, really tough and very aggressive things were happening on the pitch. But that is English football. That’s why we love it.”\nHe laughs again; all water under the (Stamford) bridge.\nIt clearly didn’t put Chelsea off; Mauricio had obviously been a target for the club for a while. “We all have our pasts, our lives,” he says. “To be honest, (Chelsea’s interest) didn’t come as a surprise because we were in PSG when the interest appeared and we considered maybe moving here. It was a very good connection between the owners and the sporting director and it was very exciting to see a project like this.\n“We were waiting for that and a club like Chelsea and we took the decision to move here, even knowing it’s going to be difficult because of our past with Southampton and Tottenham. But football is like this. You move on and move on and it was an offer and a challenge that we really liked.”\nHe believes he is a better manager for those two pressure-cooker years at PSG, a place he had played earlier in his career, in which he was juggling a galactico roster, winning Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France. “I think so, yes, because the experience of being in a dressing room or in training with this type of player makes you more confident,” he says. “You have to push yourself to be cleverer than you were because managing those players, they are so challenging.”\nWhat exactly is that challenge? Is it all about the egos?\n“It’s not only the egos because sometimes they are not like how social media shows and sometimes they are more humble than the players who are not as top as they are, but they are challenging you in every single situation and sometimes the coaching staff suffer more than the coach himself because they have more contact with them. With every single decision (you take), they will have their own ideas.\nAdvertisement\n“You have to be careful in the way you approach them, in how you talk to them, in how you convince them to move in the way you want, about your strategy on the pitch, in how you apply your principles and your concepts. It’s not easy. It’s only after you’ve experienced something like that, once you’ve lived that situation, that you know yourself better. You see where your limits are, whether you can deal with it or not.\n“In many clubs, you will maybe have one big player, but there it was (Lionel) Messi, (Kylian) Mbappe, Neymar, (Marco) Verratti, (Gianluigi) Donnarumma, Sergio Ramos, all of them maybe thinking differently or needing a different way of playing, or coming from different backgrounds because being the captain of Barcelona is not the same as being captain of Real Madrid, or the Brazil captain like Neymar. To put all that together and work like this was an amazing experience.”\nChelsea have some big players, too, but after committing more than £900million on new signings since their takeover last year, the challenge here is about finding some cohesion. And quickly.\n“Chelsea is about winning,” Mauricio says. “The history is about winning and the expectation is to win and we cannot give excuses to the players, even if many of them are young and some haven’t played in the Premier League before, because the club is spending money to bring in quality. We need to create a solid structure for them to perform in the way they’ve performed before. It’s important to give them time to settle in the team and in the area with their families.\n“They need to get to know their team-mates, the club, the pressure of playing with big money, of always being under judgment. But I have no doubt that with a lot of really hard work, we are going to create a very good team that is going to compete for big things and put Chelsea back in the place it deserves to be.”\nCaicedo’s testing debut as a second-half substitute against West Ham was illustrative of all this. “He’s one of the best, or the best, midfielder in the Premier League,” Mauricio says. “He showed that in Brighton but now he needs to show it here, with another kind of pressure. Psychology is very important in football, so we need to give him the platform and the confidence to feel good and happy.\n“Just because you pay big money doesn’t mean a player can arrive and just play straightaway in the way we expect. I always give the example of when Florentino Perez arrived at Real Madrid (as president) and started to buy big, big players like (David) Beckham, (Zinedine) Zidane, (Luis) Figo. Zidane came from Juventus for a world-record fee of €77.5million and struggled for six months and people questioned it.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s normal. I hope Caicedo can perform as soon as possible, but we need to give him time. We don’t need to put too much pressure on him, even if the fans or the media are going to talk. Our responsibility in the time we spend together here at the training ground is to give him calm and time and to get him in his best condition.”\nChelsea were vying with Liverpool for both Caicedo and Romeo Lavia, who joined from Southampton. I ask how involved Mauricio was, or if he turned off his phone to escape all that transfer madness.\n“I was really relaxed, like I have been about signings since I started my career, because I only want players who want to come with us,” he says. “It’s not just about paying more money or less money, it’s about players wanting to play for the club, for the coach, with their new team-mates. I saw with Romeo and Moi that they had an option and decided to come here. That’s a good thing to have and if something negative happens, it can make you stronger. We all want the same.”\nLavia is 19, Caicedo 21. Chelsea’s matchday squad against West Ham was the youngest in the Premier League this season and it is a deliberate shift of policy. “Yes, I think it’s a clever decision for the club,” Mauricio says. “It’s going to be a tough, tough job to settle everything, but the future will be bright for Chelsea to have all these talented players together.\n“The club is changing the idea that was here in the past. It’s about young players, developing that talent and creating players who will be top of any list in the future. That’s exciting. That is the project; to improve, to perform and of course to win titles.”\nWhen I mention those injuries to Nkunku and Chukwuemeka, about bringing on Chelsea’s academy graduate Mason Burstow against West Ham and whether it might force them into the market, Mauricio also references Armando Broja returning to fitness, “and then we have some young guys that need to step up like (Mykhailo) Mudryk or like Noni (Madueke) who was injured in pre-season or like Mason. We can’t stop the progression of our younger players, but at the same time we need to compete”.\nIt is me who brings up Lukaku, the £97.5million striker who spent last season on loan at Inter Milan and has since been kept away from Chelsea’s senior squad. “It’s difficult to talk about that because it was a decision from both sides before we arrived,” Mauricio says. “But in football, what can happen? You never know. We’ll see what is going on in the next weeks and depending on what is going on in the market, we will make some decisions.”\nAdvertisement\nOn a similar subject, I ask him about Nicolas Jackson, Chelsea’s Senegal forward and how good he can be. “Really good,” he says. “He’s still young but he has the character and capacity to improve quickly. He’s going to score lots of goals. His work ethic on the pitch, how he presses, his quality when he drives the ball and his technique when he’s running at intensity is really unbelievable. He’s going to be fantastic for us.”\nIn any case, Mauricio rejects the narrative that Chelsea’s story is only about spending, even if the figures are eye-watering. “The perception is ‘oh, Chelsea are paying big money’, but we’ve also sold for big money. (Kai) Havertz was moving to Arsenal and Mason Mount to Manchester United to give two examples, so people need to understand this and the media need to translate this idea because, otherwise, it’s not fair.\n“We were working with Kepa (Arrizabalaga) for a few weeks and started pre-season with him, then he moves to Real Madrid, Robert Sanchez arrives and people can see that one week is not enough time for a new ’keeper to settle. I’m not complaining, I’m just explaining the truth. For sure, we are going to work 24 hours a day to become a competitive team and to perform as soon as possible and we are going to push the players, but settling everything will be important.”\nThey will get there by playing the Pochettino way: aggressive, exhilarating, on the front foot, pressing up the pitch. “In our first two games, we dominated Liverpool and West Ham and so we didn’t need to press too much or go so high to play,” he says. “I think we’ll see the real way we want to play when we face teams like Manchester City, but our way of playing is to press high but also to play a possessional game in the opposition’s half.”\nNot many teams were doing it when he joined Southampton a decade ago. “It was different then, it’s more common now,” Mauricio says. “It’s usual! If you watch Wrexham or League One teams or look across Europe, the philosophy of playing is building from the back. It’s a similar way of playing. I don’t say this is wrong, but I think it’s too much sometimes. I preferred it in the past when it was different coaches, different ways of playing.\n“When we arrived here, you would have 20 teams in the Premier League and it was difficult to find two or three teams playing in the same kind of style. It was all different and really attractive and exciting. Before (Jurgen) Klopp or (Pep) Guardiola arrived, our concept and principle was to press high and build from the back and the only other team that tried to play from the back was Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers.\n“So you had Southampton and Liverpool and then at Tottenham, we surprised people a little bit with the style, but when Pep and Klopp arrived, all the coaches, I don’t know if it is to copy, but they seemed to use this way of playing. Now it’s like all teams try to build from the back, all the teams try to press high all the time. It’s like it was contagious.”\nAdvertisement\nSpeak to any player who has worked under Mauricio and they will tell you how assiduous he is when it comes to their welfare and happiness. There are different methods of getting under people’s skin and finding out what makes them tick — do you praise them, do you challenge them? — but in his case, it is not a tactic or artificial.\n“It is my strength and my weakness,” he says with a smile. “When you create this emotional relationship you suffer a lot because the energy you need to spend is massive. It’s like today — we had a very tough meeting with the players and after half an hour of that emotion, you feel empty, you know? And it’s not only with the team, it’s personal relationships. It’s important to be genuine, that players feel that you really care.\n“It’s not because we’re acting and it’s just a way to operate. No. It’s the way we actually feel. I love to manage people in this way and to do it you need to be really, really committed to the group and also to the individuals. You pay for it because if you have that emotional link with a player then his problem becomes your problem. So you can go home thinking about 25 problems and your kids or your wife might say ‘you’re thinking about everyone but not us’.\n“Maybe it’s our weakness because we show too much how we are and sometimes players can be confused by it — are you the coach, are you a friend, a mate, are you a father (figure)? You are the boss, the leader, the person who takes decisions, the person they admire or hate because of it. I suppose I would prefer some players to be confused but 90 per cent to appreciate it and understand they can be better when we help them.”\nIn Dele’s interview with Gary Neville, the midfielder said of Mauricio: “(Ours) wasn’t like a footballer-manager relationship, it was deeper,” and that after working with him: “I felt everything was so fake when managers would speak to me.” He also spoke in stark and moving terms of childhood abuse, his addiction to sleeping tablets, his time in rehab and a long history of mental health issues.\nMauricio winces when I mention it. “I started (to watch the interview), but I didn’t finish,” he says. “It was really, really tough for me. It was impossible to finish. Dele is so open and is showing his feelings and emotion and it is really, really painful when you have the kind of relationship that we had with him. You make us remember that we need to meet him. We are going to be there to help, you know, in any circumstances.\n“When he arrived (at Spurs) from Milton Keynes, he was a kid. We built a relationship and then step by step you could see the evolution of how he got to be his best, to be one of the best players in the Premier League. I always remember Sir Alex Ferguson saying to me ‘I will sign him for £100 million’ and that was when £100million was £100million, like £200million or £300million now. The interview was tough because it’s not too many years ago that he was at the top.”\nAdvertisement\nThis interlude apart, Mauricio looks refreshed and sounds upbeat and the way he tells it, there was more tension in his life during his year out of football after leaving PSG. “I was moving between London and Barcelona a lot and I was always travelling, travelling, travelling,” he says. “We want to visit Tokyo? OK, we’ll go there. It’s not like I was resting or relaxed, going to the gym, watching football, playing golf. No.\n“Speak with Jesus (Perez, his assistant) and he will say I am more relaxed now because I have my habit back. I’m more comfortable now. I’m happy to be here. The Premier League is the best spectacle in the world.”\nIt is also significantly better with Mauricio in it; a very fine coach and a very fine man, an opinion which is only burnished when we stand up and he shows me Harry’s response to his video message: “He’d still score some goals for you.” We embrace again and although my knees have long since gone, I can tell you this: Blimey, I’d play for him.\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)",
