  "body_text": "Olympique de Marseille president Pablo Longoria has given a transfer update on Mason Greenwood, which may spell trouble for Manchester United.\nGreenwood attracting interest\nGreenwood permanently left United in the summer of 2024, joining Marseille in a deal worth £26.6 million. United added a 50% sell-on clause as part of the transfer.\nThe Carrington academy graduate impressed in his first season with Marseille, netting an impressive 21 Ligue 1 goals while providing an additional six assists.\nUndoubtedly one of the best strikers in Europe, Greenwood has continued his impressive performances for Marseille so far this term. He has notched 14 goals and four assists in 21 appearances across Ligue 1 and the Champions League.\nIt comes as no surprise that Greenwood has generated significant attention, with potential suitors lining up from European leagues and further afield. Atletico Madrid have been strongly linked with him, while other reports have suggested he is on the radar of Saudi Pro League outfits.\nCourtesy of including a 50% sell-on clause, United are in line to recoup half of the profit Marseille make from selling Greenwood.\nHowever, according to Longoria, a framework exists to adjust the distribution of Greenwood’s economic rights, diminishing United’s share in favour of Marseille’s.\nMarseille president reveals concerning Greenwood news\nSpeaking at a press conference on Thursday, Longoria explained that the French team can further increase their ownership of Greenwood’s economic rights if they clinch Champions League football at the end of the campaign.\nUnited’s sell-on was reduced to 40% last season.\nLongoria said [via Get Football News France], “Regarding the contractual situation, OM holds 60% of the player’s economic rights and 100% of his sporting rights, with the possibility of increasing this to 65%.”\n“In that case, we can add 5% for qualification to the Champions League.”\nHe continued, “We are very pleased with Mason’s progress. We know his talent, but the work that Roberto De Zerbi is doing with him is extraordinary.”\nLongoria’s statement could have major financial consequences for United, significantly cutting into any future fee for Greenwood.\nFeature image Miguel Medina via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
