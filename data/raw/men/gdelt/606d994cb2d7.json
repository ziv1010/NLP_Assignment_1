We have to do well at Old Trafford and keep our hopes high in the first leg to see if we can go through in the return.\"\nEngineer\nKnown as the \"Engineer\" because of the civil engineering degree he studied in Chile, Pellegrini impressed on Spain's east coast between 2004-2009, driving his Juan Riquelme-inspired Villarreal to the Champions League semi-finals in 2006 and finishing second in La Liga in 2008.\nAfter stints at Real Madrid -- finishing second again in the league -- and Malaga, Pellegrini took over at Man City, winning the Premier League in 2014, beating Liverpool to the title.\nHe was chosen by former Barcelona directors Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano as the man to keep Pep Guardiola's seat warm.\nAfter leaving in 2016, he spent two years at Hebei China Fortune and returned to England with West Ham, before taking over at Real Betis in 2020 -- his 15th club.\nThe coach guided Betis to their first silverware since 2005 against Valencia in last year's Copa del Rey final, playing creative, attacking football but also showing backbone.\nMadrid hit that wall on Sunday, unable to break down the Andalusians in Pellegrini's 100th match in La Liga.\nBetis were without injured creative stars Nabil Fekir and Sergio Canales, but the latter is set to return on Thursday after injury, back in training on Monday with his team-mates.\nCanales said he was keen to feature in the European clash.\n\"The three points against Madrid are like the three against Villarreal or Mallorca that will come later, the Manchester United game is different, because one result affects the whole competition,\" explained the playmaker last week.\n\"In La Liga I am calmer and I know there's a long way to go and I'll get back to 100 percent.\"\nDespite United's humiliation at Anfield, Ten Hag's side are still favourites against Betis, littered with stars including Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro.\nPellegrini believes the Madrid draw shows Betis can compete with any team, even if most of his squad by contrast is unknown outside of Spain.\n\"The team is always working to improve, there are always players missing for different reasons and those who are fit have to push on,\" said the coach.\n\"For a long time this team has been (competitive), no matter who they are playing against. Today Madrid did a lot, it was a fair draw -- but the best chances were ours.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
