Whilst it sounds like a sports presenter in the audio, it’s still a bit of a mystery where the sound actually came from.\nHere’s where the ‘of course we’ll have a look’ TikTok sound is actually from\n@jodie_louise_x Of course we’ll have a look… #marksandspencer #UK #bakery #cookies #girlthings #fyp\nNow I had absolutely no clue, but the football fans among us will no doubt recognise it. It turns out that the “of course we’ll have a look” TikTok sound is actually from a Champions League match.\nThe clip comes from a piece of commentary from presenters during a between a Real Madrid and Bayern Munich game. And it’s actually former Real Madrid player, Steve McManaman, who is the one who says “We’ll have a look, of course, we’ll have a look” as the referees use video assistance to check a late goal.\nAn iconic line he no doubt will regret uttering after this fiasco.\n@margherita.p We’ll definitely have a look @Little Welsh Company @welcome.things #jellycat #cardiffuni #cathays #cardiffarcades #vlog\nThe trend has also seen dogs and animals being filmed, with many shown looking out of windows at people passing by.\nOthers caption posts with “Me whenever I see a Popworld”. One user, Flora, wrote: “Me whenever I’m walking down the street and people have their curtains open.” So me.\n@florakate2 I just can’t help myself and I know I’m not the only one coz I used to live in a House with a bay window living room and. We Got a lot of starers #fyp #nosey #sorry #ilovehouses (also I’ve purposefully filmed closed curtain houses here bcoz don’t wanna be exposing anyone but needed to film something for the bit) #hopethatsok\nClearly the temporary TikTok ban in the US didn’t have any lasting effects, as the app isn’t short of viral and trending topics, including the cute winter boots videos and the saga of the American woman in Pakistan.",
