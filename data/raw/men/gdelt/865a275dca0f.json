Jude's body language told you a lot.\n\"I've been there. I know exactly the position he's in. I found myself in that headspace many times in international football, and at certain points in my club career. I just hope the frustration doesn't boil over to the point where he gets a red card or does something stupid and gets himself injured. Against Slovenia, it looked as if he was getting close.\n\"There was the time he ran through but the pass was overhit and he slid on his knees off the side, almost smashing into the advertising boards. Frustration. But something like that is so silly - you can injure yourself.\n\"And there was that moment in the second half when Kobbie Mainoo played a brilliant cut-back into the penalty area, where you'd expect Jude to be arriving, but instead he was just walking outside the box. That was frustration too. He had made that run on other occasions and not received the ball. When that happens, and you're not having the best game, doubts start to creep in. You stop doing the right things. Throughout this tournament it has looked as if he has been trying too hard, and when you try too hard, you make decisions you don’t normally make.\"\nRooney went on to admit that Bellingham appears to still be finding his place in an England team which features a number of players trying to stand out from the crowd.\n\"We've got to remember Jude is only 20,\" the former Manchester United and Everton striker continued. \"Experience will teach him that when the going is tough you have to just keep your calmness and composure, keep doing those right things, and your quality will come through.\n\"As I say, I've been in those shoes. I know it's hard. He reminds me of myself in tournaments where you want so desperately to do well and know you and the team could be playing better, and it gets to you. But don't do something stupid, Jude.\n\"I find it strange that, up to now, he has hardly done any media interviews and I would hope that situation changes. He is in England's leadership group and, whether he likes it or not, is a talisman for his country now; he has just won La Liga and the Champions League and is in a position where he should be taking responsibility.\n\"You feel a particular type of pressure when you're seen as the star and the matchwinner. But a problem England have is that Phil Foden probably feels he has to justify being the star, Kane probably thinks that too and Jude feels the same.\n\"Sometimes players in that position end up making decisions for themselves rather than the team, and it's not a good place to be in. Before it's too late, Gareth has to find a way to get them working together or it will cost England.\n\"That would be my message to others if I was captain now: that everyone needs to come together. Because I think England have a great chance of winning these Euros, I really do. They won their group, are into a half of the draw where they avoid the biggest teams and we know - and they know - they can play a lot better.\"",
