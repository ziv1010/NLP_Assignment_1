Famed for reacting when stung by a poor result, Bayern lost twice in a row for the first time since January 2021.\nThe German champions were last held scoreless twice in succession in 2015. Against Lazio, Bayern failed to register a shot on goal for the first time since 2019's 0-0 home Champions League draw with Liverpool.\nBayern have thrashed Bochum 7-0 in three of their past five meetings, but their bid to avoid three straight losses for the first time since 2015 is not as simple as it appears.\nDespite sitting in 14th, Bochum have been hard to beat, losing just once at home this season.\nBochum have lost seven times all season, a better record than every team outside the top six, while they have a league-high 10 draws.\nWith Bayern eliminated from the German Cup by third-tier Saarbruecken, the perennial German champions are staring down a trophyless season for the first time since 2012.\nYet to win a team trophy despite a glittering career, Kane called on his side to put the \"really tough week\" behind them and \"focus on the next challenge.\"\n\"(There are) big things to fight for still. We're not out of it. We will never give up.\n\"One game or one spark can change a lot in football and we need to try and find that...\n\"We'll push each other in training and on the weekend and try and find it.\"\nLeverkusen play away at promoted Heidenheim on Saturday -- another task less straightforward than it may seem.\nSitting ninth, Heidenheim have had a strong top-flight debut campaign, thanks largely to an excellent home record.\nHeidenheim have claimed 18 of their 27 points at the 15,000-capacity Voith Arena, losing just twice all year.\nLeverkusen dropping points in Heidenheim could give Bayern a sniff of a chance, which is usually all the 33-time German champions need.\nOne to watch: Sebastien Haller (Borussia Dortmund\nBorussia Dortmund striker Sebastien Haller returned to Germany on Thursday having won the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast.\nFew footballers have endured a more difficult time than Haller over the past 18 months.\nArriving on a big-money deal from Ajax in the summer of 2022, Haller was diagnosed with testicular cancer and spent six months on the sidelines as he battled the illness.\nHe returned and played a key role as Dortmund pushed for the title, but missed a penalty in their final-day draw with Mainz, which meant Bayern were champions again.\nHaller scored the winners in the semi-final and final as hosts Ivory Coast won the tournament for the third time.\n\"We know how long his path back to the top was\" Dortmund coach Edin Terzic said Thursday, calling Haller a \"celebrated hero.\"\n\"Although things didn't go well, he stayed positive and was rewarded.\n\"We're really happy that he's back and we hope he'll bring the momentum from the tournament with him.\"\nKey stats\n55 points - Bayer Leverkusen have 55 of a possible 61 points after 21 games. Bayern Munich won the title last season with 71 points in 34 games.\n31 goals - Stuttgart forwards Serhou Guirassy and Deniz Undav have a combined 31 goals this season. Besides Stuttgart, only six Bundesliga sides have scored more than 31 goals in total.\nOne in 17 - Since beating Dortmund 3-1 in the 2015 German Cup with a Kevin de Bruyne masterclass, Wolfsburg have won just one of 17 matches between the sides.\nFixtures (1430 GMT unless stated)\nFriday\nCologne v Werder Bremen (1930)\nSaturday\nWolfsburg v Borussia Dortmund, Heidenheim v Bayer Leverkusen, Darmstadt v Stuttgart, Mainz v Augsburg, Hoffenheim v Union Berlin, RB Leipzig v Borussia Moenchengladbach (1730)\nSunday\nFreiburg v Eintracht Frankfurt, Bochum v Bayern Munich (1630)\n© 2024 AFP",
