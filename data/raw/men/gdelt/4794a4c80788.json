Hmmm, on a scale of zero to a million, to what extent to you believe that this random sitting in Spain, has some kind of exclusive inside source on what Bruno is thinking and intends to do???\nSo Newcastle United have gone from ‘richest club in the world’ according to the media, to now ‘forced to sell best player’ due to those £73.4m losses in the latest accounts.\nThe Newcastle United owners were always going to spend as much as possible in their first couple of years, to try and get the club heading in the right direction after a decade and a half of Mike Ashley. They were always going to push right up to the very limits of what they could spend BUT without breaking FFP rules.\nNewcastle United do not have to sell any star player to cover losses in the accounts. However, just like when they chose to sell squad player ASM for £23m last summer because it then gave them the FFP flexibility to sign both Barnes (£40m) and Livramento (£38m), like every other club pretty much, Newcastle will no doubt do the same this summer and in other windows, maybe even a small possibility in this January 2024 window – though very unlikely for me.\nMan City sold Cole Palmer for £45m in the summer to Chelsea because of the huge FFP help that gave, whilst Chelsea are doing it with numerous players, other Premier League clubs the same.\nMan City though aren’t willingly selling a Haaland though, nor are any other top clubs doing that.\nEvery chance this summer Newcastle United could sell two or three first team squad players who have played a decent amount of football under Eddie Howe and they may be (to an extent) surprise sales, a bit like ASM. Those sales potentially unlocking massive FFP potential for NUFC, up to five times whatever they are sold for. Easy to see how selling a few players for maybe £50m-£60m combined, could then lead to Eddie Howe able to spend serious money far above that. Eddie Howe though made clear this past week following the release of the accounts, that it is squad players and not star players who are the ones who he intends to trade this summer and beyond. Though obviously the likes of both him and Darren Eales, covering themselves by saying you never know what might happen in the future, a real star player COULD be traded at some point, but I would guess this very likely only to happen if the player looking to leave for whatever reason.\nAs for Bruno Guimaraes desperate to leave Newcastle United, well all I can say is he must be one of the best actors in the world. He has done a lot of interviews recently and despite the negative run of results on the pitch, he time after time makes clear how much he loves it at NUFC and living here.\nThis is a cracking interview Bruno Guimaraes and Joelinton have just done, well worth a watch below. The pair of them doing it as part of a massive Adidas campaign using famous players to promote their Predator football boots (the NUFC duo also looking class in the old Newcastle United Adidas kit).\nThere is one bit of truth hinted at in our Spanish friend’s ‘Bruno Guimaraes desperate to leave Newcastle United’ exclusive…\nUEFA did change their rules a few years ago and maybe surprisingly, players who play in the Champions League group stage, can then join another club and in the same season go on to play for another club in the Champions League knockout stages in the last 16.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
