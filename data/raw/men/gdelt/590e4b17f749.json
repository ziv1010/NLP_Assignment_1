  "body_text": "It was mildly surprising last week that Tiemoue Bakayoko’s long-overdue departure from Chelsea prompted as many as three paragraphs on the club’s official website.\nChelsea’s acknowledgement ended with a standard “thanks for the contribution” for the one season of his initial five-year contract Bakayoko actually played at Stamford Bridge, but any gratitude felt by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital will have more to do with the Frenchman’s willingness to terminate his current deal one year early and seek pastures new.\nAdvertisement\nBakayoko leaving also means that, seven years later, Chelsea have at last fully disentangled themselves from an almost entirely disastrous summer transfer window of 2017 that also saw Alvaro Morata, Danny Drinkwater, Antonio Rudiger and Davide Zappacosta arrive to “bolster” Antonio Conte’s newly crowned Premier League title winners.\nThose five players, all signed to four or five-year contracts for transfer fees totalling almost £190million ($244m), combined to make 126 appearances for Chelsea in the Premier League after the 2017-18 season. Rudiger alone accounted for 106 of those.\nEven within the context of Chelsea’s frequently eye-watering and erratic transfer activity since 2003, the summer of 2017 stands apart as a shuddering cautionary tale of how not to set up a squad of proven winners for a more sustained run of dominance.\nBut what are the best specific lessons for Boehly and Clearlake — as well as any other ambitious Premier League club owners — to take from it? The Athletic details them below…\nNEVER spend big on squad signings\nThis was the real original sin of Chelsea’s worst business in the summer of 2017 — particularly in the final days of the window when attention turned to Drinkwater and Zappacosta.\nNeither were at the top of Conte’s list of desired reinforcements; Drinkwater became a focus only after attempts to prise Arturo Vidal from Bayern Munich failed, while Zappacosta was a late insurance policy after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain decided he would rather play in Liverpool’s midfield than become the next Victor Moses as a right wing-back at Stamford Bridge.\nNor, despite what subsequent events might suggest, were either of them simply bad players. Drinkwater was 27, only a year removed from winning the Premier League title at Leicester City and had good midfield chemistry with N’Golo Kante. Zappacosta was 25 and had become a full Italy international under Conte a year earlier in recognition of his form at Torino.\nAdvertisement\nBoth, however, were bad signings, even without the benefit of hindsight. Well-run elite clubs do not commit significant resources — in terms of transfer fees and salary commitments — to players who have no realistic prospect of ever becoming regular starters.\nIt is not difficult to fill out a squad with cheaper acquisitions, free agent signings (such as Willy Caballero, who also arrived in the summer of 2017) and academy graduates, leaving the bulk of the transfer budget free to chase truly top-tier players who can elevate the starting XI.\nA case in point: a few weeks before spending £35million on Drinkwater, Chelsea loaned a 21-year-old academy midfielder out to Crystal Palace. Ruben Loftus-Cheek — who, it must be noted, Conte bizarrely only appeared to trust as a striker — went on to play so well at Selhurst Park that he earned a place in Gareth Southgate’s squad for the 2018 World Cup.\nDespite what eventually happened to them at Chelsea, the risks were not the main reason to advise against signing Drinkwater and Zappacosta. The bigger issue was the total lack of upside potential. Boehly and Clearlake made a very similar error last summer with Marc Cucurella, agreeing to pay an initial £60million(!) for a good but not great player to provide squad cover across the left-sided defensive positions.\nCucurella is not the liability he frequently appeared to be in a difficult first season at Chelsea. However, it is arguable that Lewis Hall, an academy midfielder who is still learning how to play as a left-back or left wing-back, has already surpassed him in the pecking order below Ben Chilwell.\nContinuity of coaching is important\nThe art of recruitment is far more complicated than simply signing good footballers; when it comes to the first-team transfer targets of elite European clubs, they are all good. Whether those players go on to succeed or fail is the product of a much bigger equation. Talent is one of many variables, a significant number of which are outside the player’s control.\nAdvertisement\nA big one is coaching. Any footballer can look much worse than they are in a system and role that does not suit them and a player’s career trajectory can be radically changed by replacing a coach who believes in and maximises them with a coach who does not.\nThe final nail in the coffin of Chelsea’s transfer business in the summer of 2017 was the sacking of Conte and the hiring of Maurizio Sarri a year later. Within weeks of Sarri’s arrival, Bakayoko — who had only just been surpassed by Jorginho as the club’s record midfield signing — was loaned out to AC Milan, while Drinkwater never made another Premier League appearance for the club.\nBakayoko had endured plenty of difficult moments in his first season at Stamford Bridge, most memorably a 30-minute disaster that ended in a red card against Watford at Vicarage Road. He had also produced a number of genuinely good performances next to Kante, including in a 2-1 away win over Atletico Madrid in the Champions League group stage and in an FA Cup final win over Manchester United.\nThe problem was that Bakayoko and Drinkwater were bought specifically to fit into the middle of Conte’s 3-4-3 system and Sarri quickly decided they had no place in the Jorginho-anchored midfield trio at the heart of his 4-3-3. Zappacosta, too, was a more natural wing-back than full-back and as such his only real minutes in 2018-19 came in the Europa League.\nNo one can blame Conte or Sarri for wanting players suited to their tactical instructions and styles of play, but the collateral damage of that particularly jarring transition underlined how profound the ripple effects of replacing one coach with a radically different one can be. The best example is Moses, who went from serial loanee to key starter in a Premier League title-winning team and back to serial loanee within the space of three dizzying years.\nChelsea encountered this type of situation repeatedly in the Roman Abramovich era and are poised to deal with it again in 2023; Mauricio Pochettino does not traditionally favour wing-back systems as predecessors Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter did, a reality that will have implications for every defender in the current squad.\nContracts can be liabilities rather than assets\nBakayoko and Chelsea might have turned this particular page two years ago were it not for club director Marina Granovskaia’s insistence on protecting the theoretical concept of the player’s value at all costs. The Frenchman, entering the final year of his initial contract at Stamford Bridge, was persuaded to sign a lucrative three-year extension before joining AC Milan on loan.\nAdvertisement\nThe same logic that extended the Chelsea careers of Michy Batshuayi and Kenedy beyond all reason prevailed here: Bakayoko could rebuild his transfer value on loan and feature enough at Milan to compel them or another club to offer real money to sign him permanently.\nIt did not work because it almost never does. Chelsea under Abramovich were slow to react to the shifting economic landscape of European football as the Premier League left the rest of the continent floundering in its financial wake over the course of the 2010s, all but eliminating the overseas market to buy the mistakes of England’s top clubs.\nOnce a player is on “Chelsea money”, it becomes extremely difficult to sell them — except of course the ones who are producing in line with their salary, but those are the ones you want to keep. Loaning is a little easier, but only represents a short-term workaround that can create a longer-term problem of its own: once a player becomes regarded within the market as a serial loanee, the likelihood of any club choosing to give up real money to buy them recedes.\nBakayoko had spent three consecutive seasons on loan by the time Granovskaia offered the extension in the summer of 2021, including one year with Milan. The warning signs should have been heeded when the Italian giants, having qualified for the Champions League, remained unwilling to offer a meaningful transfer fee for a 25-year-old one year away from free agency.\nRomelu Lukaku, a much newer addition to Chelsea’s loan contingent, is currently on a similar path with Champions League finalists Inter not deeming a permanent transfer feasible in this window. History suggests this calculus is unlikely to look any better for Boehly and Clearlake after another year spent on loan in Serie A.\nBoehly and Clearlake are trying to move away from the Abramovich era definition of “Chelsea money” with recent signings on lower, more heavily-incentivised salary packages, but that push is undermined by the lucrative deals sanctioned for Raheem Sterling, Kalidou Koulibaly and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang last summer.\nChelsea would drive Koulibaly and Aubameyang to the nearest airport if sales can be agreed in this window, but inevitably, conditions are not shaping up to be easy.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps the free-spending Saudi Pro League will come to the rescue. If not, Boehly and Clearlake will learn the hard way, just as Abramovich and Granovskaia did after the summer of 2017, that bad money is much easier to spend than it is to recoup.\n(Top photo: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images)",
