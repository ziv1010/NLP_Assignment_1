Which then leads us to, is he the right fit for Guardiola and Man City?\n“And the answer is 100 per cent that he isn’t. I don’t want City fans to go after me. On his line, the saves that he made for PSG in the Champions League, he’s the best in the world. Him and [Thibaut] Courtois, there’s no one better.\n“I give you that, and maybe that’s enough for Guardiola to say, ‘yes, I want him’, and City fans would be happy excited and happy.\n“However, the most important thing a keeper has to do for Guardiola is being really good with the ball at his feet. Remember what happened with Joe Hart, Claudio Bravo, people like that.\n“If you’re not good with the ball at your feet, you’re not a Guardiola keeper. Donnarumma is not good with the ball at his feet, his distribution is not good enough for Guardiola’s City team.\n“Then, his other weakness is he doesn’t come out for the ball in the air. He doesn’t like coming out for crosses, corners.\n“If there is one league in the world where your keeper has to be brave – and we saw that with [Altay] Bayindir in Manchester United vs Arsenal – it’s the Premier League.\n“So I cannot see how Guardiola thinks, ‘he’s the perfect guy for me’. PSG have conceded many goals because he doesn’t come out for crosses and set pieces, both in the league and Champions League.\n“On top of that, he’s going to cost you around £40m in transfer fees. He wants big wages, which was one of the problems at PSG, probably around £300-350,000 a week.\n“I know he’s still only 26, he can be at your club for 10 years. But all of that makes me think, ‘really City’?”\nLatest Man City news: Savinho update, Defender sale\nSources have told TEAMtalk that Tottenham are gaining confidence over signing Savinho from Man City before the summer transfer window closes on September 1.\nRomano has revealed the truth behind rumours that Man City are keen on beating city-rivals Manchester United to the signing of a Belgian star.\nTEAMtalk’s transfer correspondent, Fraser Fletcher, has reported that Man City are open to selling one of their best defenders this summer.",
