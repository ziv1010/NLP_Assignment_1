The win not only cemented FC Goa’s place in history as the first team to win the Super Cup twice, but also booked their ticket to the AFC Champions League Two 2025-26, marking their return to Asian club competition after four years.\nବର୍ଷାର ଆଗମନରେ କଳିଙ୍ଗ ଷ୍ଟାଡିୟମର ସୌନ୍ଦର୍ଯ୍ୟ ଅତ୍ୟନ୍ତ ମନମୁଗ୍ଧକର!#odishaforfootball #fcgjfc #indianfootball #KalingaSuperCup #KalingaStadium pic.twitter.com/wCYPKj8C7s\n— Odisha Sports (@sports_odisha) May 3, 2025\nFrom the opening whistle, it was a battle of Goa’s attacking firepower against Jamshedpur’s reputed defence, which had remained unbreached throughout the tournament. However, the tides turned swiftly as Goa dominated possession and created chances at will. The breakthrough came in the 23rd minute when Herrera capitalised on a rebound from Aakash Sangwan’s powerful strike, calmly placing the ball into the net.\nJamshedpur had a fleeting moment of hope when Lazar Ćirković’s header rattled the crossbar before halftime, but their inability to contain Goa’s waves of attacks proved costly. The second goal arrived when Herrera unleashed a sensational 25-yard strike into the top corner, showcasing his finesse and precision. Goa’s relentless charge culminated in Dražić’s cool finish, assisted by Carl McHugh, in the 71st minute.\nAs rain drenched the iconic Kalinga Stadium, Goa’s players danced in celebration, embracing the moment of their triumphant return to domestic supremacy. Head coach Manolo Márquez, who concluded his tenure with this spectacular victory, described the night as “pure footballing bliss.”\nBorja Herrera was rightfully awarded the Kalinga Player of the Match, capping off his stellar performance. This emphatic victory not only reinforced FC Goa’s attacking pedigree but also signified a new chapter in their legacy.\nHon’ble Deputy CM Sri @KVSinghDeo1 and President, @IndianFootball, Sri @kalyanchaubey presented the coveted trophy of Kalinga Super Cup Trophy to the @FCGoaOfficial.#OdishaForFootball #FCGJFC #IndianFootball⚽ #KalingaSuperCup 🏆 #KalingaStadium pic.twitter.com/1RSsU5TXys\n— Odisha Sports (@sports_odisha) May 3, 2025\nPrincipal Secretary, DSYS, Sri @Bhaskar__Sarma presented the runners up award to the @JamshedpurFC.#OdishaForFootball #FCGJFC #IndianFootball⚽ #KalingaSuperCup 🏆 #KalingaStadium pic.twitter.com/W02q8f1GM4\n— Odisha Sports (@sports_odisha) May 3, 2025\nThe #KalingaSuperCup 2025 CHAMPIONS! 🏆\nFC GOA 🧡\nRead final match report 🔗 https://t.co/fVrovzp9p8#FCGJFC #IndianFootball ⚽️ pic.twitter.com/cDJmhth8eZ\n— Indian Football Team (@IndianFootball) May 3, 2025",
