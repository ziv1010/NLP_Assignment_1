  "body_text": "Euro Paper Talk: Man Utd ‘most determined club’ to sign deadly Serie A star as Chelsea legend helps Ten Hag; Arsenal man ‘reciprocates interest’ with European side\nManchester United are the team who are pushing hardest to sign a top Napoli player amid a three-club hunt for his services, an Arsenal attacker is ‘reciprocating interest’ with a potential suitor, while Thursday’s Euro Paper Talk claims West Ham want a former Gunners man to replace Declan Rice.\nMAN UTD LEADING CHARGE FOR STRIKER\nErik ten Hag’s Man Utd are the ‘most determined club’ in the chase for Napoli centre-forward Victor Osimhen and could therefore beat Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain to a deal, according to a report.\nOsimhen has enjoyed an incredible season. He has managed 26 goals in just 31 appearances across all competitions so far.\nHis electric form has helped put Napoli at the top of the Serie A table, where they have a 14-point lead on second-placed Lazio. Osimhen also bagged five goals in six Champions League matches to fire Napoli into the quarter-finals of the competition.\nHowever, their Champions League dream came to an end on Tuesday night as they drew 1-1 with AC Milan, which saw the Rossoneri advance to the last four thanks to a 2-1 aggregate win.\nOsimhen must now focus on aiding Napoli’s pursuit of a first league title since the days of Diego Maradona. But it could be the last thing he does for Napoli.\nThe Nigeria international is high up in Ten Hag’s thinking as the Man Utd boss searches for a striker to replace Wout Weghorst this summer.\nTen Hag believes Osimhen has all the right attributes and mentality to become a lethal goalscorer in England, just like he has managed in Italy.\nAnd Sport Witness, who cite Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, have provided a very positive update on Man Utd’s transfer hunt. It is claimed that with Napoli now out of the UCL they are at more risk of Osimhen going.\nRed Devils must pay £132m for next centre-forward\nMan Utd, Chelsea and PSG are the three clubs vying to complete a deal. Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis would love for the talisman to stay in Naples, but he will simply have to agree an exit if a ‘super offer’ arrives.\nIt is thought that one of Osimhen’s potential suitors will have to bid €150million (£132m) to reach an agreement. This is clearly a huge sum of money, but the 24-year-old’s incredible form this season has shown that he is worth it.\nIn a major boost for Man Utd, they are described as being the ‘most determined club’ to sign him. It seems Ten Hag will tell Man Utd chiefs that Osimhen must be signed no matter the cost, to help the Red Devils compete with Arsenal and Manchester City next term.\nChelsea need a striker just like Man Utd, but their lack of UCL football next season will hold them back.\nCoincidentally, Chelsea hero Didier Drogba has also given Man Utd a helping hand. He has urged Osimhen to snub PSG’s advances as they are ‘not the club he needs to continue his growth’.\nDrogba is one of Osimhen’s biggest idols, so he is therefore likely to listen to this transfer advice.\nOsimhen will be the subject of one of the fiercest transfer battles during the summer window. But as things stand, Man Utd are poised to win the race for him.\nAnd an attack consisting of Osimhen, Marcus Rashford, Antony and Bruno Fernandes would be quite simply frightening.\nARSENAL STAR INTRIGUED BY ONE CLUB’S INTEREST\nMarseille have begun hunting Arsenal striker Folarin Balogun and the 21-year-old is ‘reciprocating’ their interest as he looks for a permanent move away from the Emirates. (Foot Mercato)\nNewcastle United’s owners have been backed to purchase Belgian outfit KV Oostende. A delegation from the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund has travelled to the club to take a look at their facilities. (Sacha Tavolieri)\nJulian Nagelsmann would be an ‘excellent option’ for the Chelsea managerial role as he is an ‘elite coach’ who could head up their long-term project. (Fabrizio Romano)\nWolfsburg are hoping to snare Robin Gosens from Inter Milan, following rumours of Leicester interest in the left wing-back. (Kicker)\nSassuolo have told Juventus they want €40m (£35m) for Italy international Davide Frattesi. The midfielder has previously been linked with Man Utd and Arsenal. (Rai Sport)\nKarim Benzema has followed Toni Kroos’ lead by penning a new one-year contract with Real Madrid. (Diario AS)\nWEST HAM IDENTIFY NEW RICE SUCCESSOR\nWest Ham have surprisingly decided former Arsenal midfielder Matteo Guendouzi would be a good replacement for Declan Rice. Guendouzi swapped Arsenal for Marseille in summer 2021 after causing problems for Gunners boss Mikel Arteta. (L’Equipe)\nWest Ham will not have a free run at Guendouzi though as Aston Villa and Newcastle are also keeping tabs on him. (L’Equipe)\nBorussia Monchengladbach have decided to sell midfielder Manu Kone amid rumours of Man Utd interest in the player. (Bild)\nBayern Munich have set their sights on Lille striker Jonathan David, who has netted 22 goals in 33 appearances this campaign. (Florian Plettenberg)\nAtletico Madrid are hoping Chelsea will pay €80m (£70.5m) to sign loanee Joao Felix this summer. Such a deal would fund Atleti’s squad rebuild ahead of next season. (Marca)\nBarcelona are preparing to offer Lionel Messi a two-year deal to return to the Nou Camp from PSG. Although, he would have the option to leave on a free transfer after one season if he so wished. (Sport)\nARSENAL FACE REAL COMPETITION FOR MIDFIELDER\nReal Madrid have joined Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle in pursuing highly rated Flamengo midfielder Matheus Franca. Arsenal reportedly scouted the 19-year-old on Wednesday night. (Diario AS)\nChelsea believe Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel would be a great replacement for Kepa Arrizabalaga. Kobel has kept 12 clean sheets in 29 games this term. (Bild)\nBayern are discussing the future of CEO Oliver Kahn and could soon sack the 53-year-old. (Christian Falk)\nTottenham are ‘always attentive’ to the Portuguese market and could follow up on Pedro Porro’s move by landing Manuel Ugarte from Sporting Lisbon. (Fabrizio Romano)\nWolves winger Adama Traore might end up playing against Cristiano Ronaldo next season after receiving a lucrative contract offer from Saudi team Al-Ittihad. (Foot Mercato)\nOlivier Giroud has extended his spell at AC Milan by penning a new one-year deal with the Italian giants. (various)",
