  "body_text": "Liverpool predicted lineup vs Arsenal - Premier League\n- Liverpool face off against Arsenal in the Premier League\n- Arne Slot remains without Alisson Becker and Diogo Jota\n- Pressure on Darwin Nunez to lead the line effectively\nArne Slot faces his toughest test yet since succeeding Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool manager, taking the Reds to north London on Sunday to face Premier League title rivals Arsenal.\nSlot has won all but one of the 12 games across three competitions he has taken charge of, the most recent of which saw Liverpool emerge victorious over RB Leipzig in the Champions League.\nThe Reds sit top of the Premier League table, one point in front of Manchester City and four ahead of Arsenal. With City hosting Southampton 24 hours earlier, there is every chance that Slot's team will be pushed down into second place overnight, then having the chance to respond.\nThis will be a huge game for Arsenal, who could be without up to seven players - including Martin Odegaard and the suspended William Saliba, to ensure they don't get cut adrift of the top two.\nSlot will be keen for his to make a statement with a strong performance.\nLiverpool predicted lineup vs Arsenal (4-2-3-1)\nGK: Caoimhin Kelleher - Slot has confirmed that Alisson is \"progressing well\" in his recovery, but it isn't a quick fix and so Kelleher remains the man of the moment between the sticks.\nRB: Trent Alexander-Arnold - It is eight years since his senior Liverpool debut, a Carabao Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur in 2016, but his future beyond this season remains uncertain.\nCB: Virgil van Dijk - Another whose future is not yet mapped out is the skipper, although he has confirmed that talks with the club over a new deal are underway.\nCB: Ibrahima Konate - The Premier League win over Chelsea was his 100th Liverpool appearance and has been an underrated part of the club's success so far this season.\nLB: Andrew Robertson - The Scot only played the final 15 minutes off the bench against Leipzig in midweek and should be fresh for this one. Game management is important now.\nCM: Alexis Mac Allister - Back in the starting lineup in Germany after being limited to a substitute appearance against Chelsea and should get the nod again here.\nCM: Ryan Gravenberch - Timing is everything in football and the Dutchman is thriving in his second year with the club after a frustrating debut season of stop-start chances.\nRM: Mohamed Salah - Withdrawn after an hour against Leipzig, which may have been with one eye on this fixture. It's five goals and five assists in eight Premier League appearances so far in 2024/25.\nAM: Curtis Jones - Dominik Szoboszlai could end up being the fall guy if Mac Allister keeps his place, because Jones' recent Premier League performances have been too good.\nLM: Luis Diaz - The Colombian has played second fiddle to Cody Gakpo in recent weeks but his explosiveness, having already scored twice against Manchester United, could be important.\nST: Darwin Nunez - Diogo Jota remains sidelined so this starting place belongs to Nunez for at least the next couple of games. Scored the winner against Leipzg but consistency is his personal Everest.",
