  "body_text": "Being a football blogger is, generally, a fun endeavor. You get to opine about your favorite club and your favorite sport, essentially committing to paper the thoughts you’d likely let fly rather loosely when among your fellow sports fans, so it’s not entirely a different experience. And what’s more, you’ve got a baked-in group of folks to share this information with. It’s more satisfying than shouting into the void.\nTo Richard Hughes, With Love: A Fan’s Priorities Before the Winter Window Opens\nThe International Break is almost over but isn’t quite yet and my brain has melted.\nBut it definitely isn’t easier. Making sense of the information on a week-to-week basis (i.e.: crafting narratives) is what we’re paid to do and that job can sometimes be a slog. For example, when the news slows down because there aren’t any matches to help develop those narratives. Which is precisely what happens during the international break.\nUnlucky for me, the international break still has a few more hours left and it’s my turn to write something - anything - about Liverpool FC. In that vein, I decided to take a moment to address what I’d like to have happen this ahead of the Winter Transfer Window. After all, it’s never too late to dream of post-Christmas presents.\n- New contracts for Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil Van Dijk, and Mohamed Salah. In that order. I don’t know what changes - if any - are coming to Liverpool’s wage structure. But extending TAA, VVD, and Mo feels like the kind of obvious and inevitable solution that I’m shocked it wasn’t happened. Wrapping this up would go a long way in helping to ensure that Liverpool’s future transfer windows could focus on real areas of need and/or improvement.\n- Sign at least one more midfielder. With the fixture list as bloated as ever given the nature of expansion in the Champions League, it seems inevitable that we’ll need to have an extra body on hand.\n- Identify a successor to Mo on the right. While I know he’s as irreplaceable as they come, having a player identified who might be able to either carry the playmaking role Mo developed or carry his goal production would be a pretty straightforward means of ensuring we remain competitive.\nI have a few others but these are the ones that rattle around my brain most often at the moment. Here’s hoping we can make headway in these pursuits off-the-field while Liverpool continue to put pressure on the rest of the league.",
