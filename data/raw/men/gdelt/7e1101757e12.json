I’m here to win and I will perform.\n“I will definitely show you something exciting in… are we calling it football or soccer? I will definitely show you some exciting football and we will have success.”\nSon added that the decision to leave Spurs had left him feeling “very empty”.\n“I felt like I gave it all, but I felt like I needed a new chapter and new challenge and I chose LAFC. I’m old but I still have good physicality, good legs and I still have good quality.”\nEarlier Son had issued an heartfelt message to Tottenham fans on making the “hardest decision ever” to leave north London.\n“How to find the right words for this? I don’t know. I have been thinking for days. It’s impossible. But here I go,” Son wrote.\n“It’s time for me to say goodbye to Tottenham Hotspur. My home for the past decade. When I arrived in 2015, I didn’t speak English, I didn’t know London, but you welcomed me with open arms, believed in me, and stood by me through every high and low.\n“I was just a boy from Korea with big dreams who was supposed to have no chance. And now, 10 years later, North London is in my heart forever.\n“I’ve made friends for life here, had the honour of becoming a godfather here, and had the privilege of captaining our special club here. I’ve poured my heart and soul into this club, which makes this the hardest decision ever.\n“I thought if I was ever going to leave, it would have to be on my terms, on the best terms, when our mission had been accomplished together. With pride and honour.”\nSon joined Spurs in 2015 from Bayer Leverkusen. Alongside old partner in crime Harry Kane, Son holds the record for the most goal involvements by a duo in the Premier League, with the pair assisting each other on a record 47 occasions in the competition.\nSon’s performance helped turn Tottenham into title contenders when they finished second in the Premier League under Mauricio Pochettino in 2017, finishing as runners-up in the Champions League two years later.\nAfter Kane left for Bayern Munich, Son became Spurs captain under Ange Postecoglou, lifting the Europa League trophy in May – having come off the bench in the final against Manchester United, a 1-0 Spurs win, after an injury-affected campaign.\nThe popular South Korean will renew acquaintances with Hugo Lloris and move to Los Angeles, which boasts one of the largest Korean populations in the world, ahead of next summer’s World Cup in the United States.",
