I feel like every time I speak after bad games, I'm always honest. I think us as a team, we have to be honest.\n\"I do think Newcastle are a very good side but I don't think they won the game on quality today, I think they won it on passion, desire, hunger and attitude. They clearly had higher motivation then we had and that can't be possible.\n\"I feel like I say the same things every time we lose, like I said, it's not acceptable. We know that. It was a massive game today and they wanted it more and at Manchester United that can't be possible.\"\nTen Hag needs to take responsibility for himself as well\nI’m surprised by Erik ten Hag’s comments today. I think he has to acknowledge his selection and subs if he wants to criticise intangibles like passion and desire in the way he has.\nTen Hag: They wanted to win more than us\nErik ten Hag was not pleased with his side's performance:\nBreakthrough performance\nNewcastle United have beaten Manchester United in the Premier League for the first time since October 2019, having failed to win their previous six matches in this fixture (D2 L4).\nShots fired\nNewcastle's social media team having a bit of a dig at Erik ten Hag's pre-match complaints about their gamesmanship:\nCallum Wilson: 'Draws aren’t going to be enough'\n\"To have a few weeks out of the team, all you can do is put yourself forward. Nobody, especially strikers, wants to be on the bench so it’s great to have an impact.\n\"It was important that we tried to carry our momentum from before the international break. Draws aren’t going to be enough at the moment if we’re to achieve what we want to achieve.\"\nDan Burn: 'As Newcastle fans we’ve always disliked Man United'\n\"That was really special - as Newcastle fans we’ve always disliked Man United so it was good to get the win. Just to have the extra emotion in me when I play at home is great - maybe it comes out a bit too much some times.\n\"That was a big result today and puts us level on points with them, but we’ve got a really big week this week with three away games.\"\nEddie Howe: 'A big moment to go above Man United'\n\"It feels a big moment to go above Man United, we haven’t beaten the teams above us enough. We put it all together today in a great performance and the lads were really motivated for obvious reasons.\n\"It’s an incredible place to manage a football team - it’s a truly passionate football city and the atmosphere at home and away games is second to none. I really love the people and I hope we can bring them success.\"\nUpdated top-six table\nNewcastle leapfrog Manchester United.\nUnpacking a massive result\nChris Waugh and Dan Sheldon have analysed a potentially pivotal result at St James’ Park, taking a look at:\n- St James’ Park relishing a feisty encounter\n- Erik ten Hag’s midfield set-up causing Manchester United problems\n- Mercurial Saint-Maximin and third-time-luck Willock making their presence felt\n- The Wout Weghorst experiment indicative of Manchester United’s woes\n- Where this result leave both sides in terms of finishing in the top four this season\nForget 1997, Newcastle partying like it's 1996!\nNewcastle have beaten Manchester United with both teams starting the day in the Premier League’s top five places for only the second time.\nThe other instance was the famous 5-0 win at St James’ Park in October 1996 under Kevin Keegan.\nNewcastle partying like it's 1997\nNewcastle have now kept clean sheets in two consecutive Premier League matches against Manchester United for the first time since 1997, after their goalless draw at Old Trafford earlier this season.\nLeaky defence away from home\nManchester United have now conceded 29 goals across their 14 league games away from home this season.\nThey have only conceded more away goals in a Premier League campaign once before, allowing 35 last season; a worrying trend.\nManchester United are fading\nReally concerning performance by Manchester United.\nThey have collected 12 points from their past nine Premier League games, failing to score in the last three - the first time they've failed to do so in three straight league games since February 2020.\nSorely missing Casemiro\nManchester United have lost four of their eight Premier League games without Casemiro this season, compared to three of 19 when he has played.\nSaint-Maximin's impact\nAllan Saint-Maximin was everywhere today:\nMassive result for Newcastle\nAbsolutely monumental and deserved victory for Newcastle, who make it three wins on the bounce and move up to third, ahead of Manchester United on goal difference.\nThere was wasted first-half chances, but Joe Willock and second-half substitute Callum Wilson delivered the win.\nMassive.\nVideo of Wilson goal's - US readers\nUS readers can watch the replay of Newcastle's second goal here:\nTeam Stats\nNEW\nMUN\nGame Details",
