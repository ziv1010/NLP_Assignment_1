Sunderland will cause Arsenal problems.\n‘They are an athletic team with pace. They are well drilled and organised, and they counter with pace. They also make the right decisions on the counter, picking the right pass. They didn’t waste the ball when they had it.\n‘I was so impressed with them at Stamford Bridge, and you have to say they are safe. They were superb.’\nReturning to the Premier League for the first time since 2017, Sunderland were one of the favourites for relegation, but the Black Cats have enjoyed a sensational start to the season.\nRegis Le Bris’ side have lost just two of their opening nine games and Saturday’s stunning 2-1 victory at Chelsea has moved them up to fourth in the table, five points behind Arsenal.\nKey to their scintillating form is former Gunners captain Granit Xhaka who joined the North East club from Bayer Leverkusen in a surprise summer transfer.\nWhere will Sunderland finish this season?\n-\nTop four\n-\n5th-10th\n-\n11th-17th\n-\nRelegation zone\n‘Whoever is in charge of Sunderland’s recruitment needs a knighthood,’ Merson added.\nMore Trending\n‘Xhaka has been some buy, but it is not just him. Every player that has come in has been exceptional.\n‘I don’t want to put any unnecessary pressure on them, but they don’t have to worry about relegation now after this start. They need another four or five wins in 29 football matches and I expect them to do that easy.’\nArsenal visit the Stadium of Light on November 8 but first up they have a Carabao Cup clash against Brighton on Wednesday night.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Arsenal are the only consistent club in a bizarre Premier League season\nMORE: Micah Richards admits Arsenal star has proved him wrong: ‘He’s a machine!’\nMORE: Gary Lineker reveals he had ‘question mark’ over Manchester United signing",
