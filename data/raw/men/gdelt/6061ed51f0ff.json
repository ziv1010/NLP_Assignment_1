Ronaldo, who is the all-time goal-scorer leading goalscorer in the UEFA Champions League, is 11 goals clear of Lionel Messi and 46 ahead of third-placed Robert Lewandowski at the top of the scoring charts.\n\"For me, it’s a pleasure to be here. Thank you for this amazing award. As you know, Champions League is the highest in football. The records speak for themselves but the league (is at that level) because of the players that play in the competition. I have nice memories coming to this gala and football is managed by memories. So, thank you for this,” Ronaldo said after receiving the award.\nRonaldo has finished seven separate Champions League seasons as leading scorer – more than any other player – spanning from his eight goals in Manchester United’s triumphant 2007/08 campaign to his 15-goal haul when Real Madrid claimed their third straight title in 2017/18. He also holds the record for most goals in a single Champions League season having found the net 17 times in 2013/14, including in the extra-time win against Atlético de Madrid in the final.\nThe Portugal forward has won the competition once with Manchester United and four times with Real Madrid – making him the first five-time winner in the competition’s history since 1992 – and is the only player to have scored in three separate Champions League finals (2008, 2014, 2017).\n\"The first one is always the special one, when I was in Manchester. Of course, Real Madrid was differently special, winning four times there. At that time, in Lisbon in 2018, I remember I felt like the most expensive player in the world and there was pressure about winning the Champions League. But I think goals and trophies are like ketchup, once it start coming, they keep coming,\" the star striker said.\nHe also holds the record for the longest Champions League scoring streak, having struck in 11 successive matches from June 2017 to April 2018. Ronaldo has also scored an astounding eight Champions League hat-tricks.\nThe multiple Ballon d'Or and UEFA Men's Player of the Year recipient is also the all-time leading scorer in all UEFA club competitions (145 goals, 197 appearances) as well as the most prolific ever player in men's international football (130 goals, 212 appearances).",
