Now we need to give him time, you know, to be 100 percent fit.\n“But he has done fantastic in the past and no doubt that he is going to do very good for this club in the future.”\nBrazilian wonderkid Estevao scored a stunning solo goal in Chelsea’s 3-0 win against Barcelona in the Champions League on Tuesday, burnishing his reputation.\nMaresca admitted pairing Palmer with Estevao, 18, was an exciting prospect.\n“Depends against which team, depends a little bit on the game plan, but for sure the fans are excited to watch both together,” he said.\n“We also are excited, thinking that at the end we need always balance.”\nMaresca, who won the UEFA Conference League and Club World Cup last season in his first campaign at Chelsea, said his team had made progress over the past year but it was too soon to predict a title challenge.\n“For sure it’s different compared to one year ago, and it’s because we spent one more year together,” he said. “We went through moments where we can learn from that moment. Then again, for me it’s very early.\n“We are still at the end of November, December, so it’s very early and it’s important to be where we are now in March, April, and then we see.”\nSATURDAY’S GAMES\nBrentford vs Burnley\nMan City vs Leeds\nSunderland vs Bournemouth\nEverton vs Newcastle\nTottenham vs Fulham\nSUNDAY’S GAMES\nCrystal Palace vs Man United\nAston Villa vs Wolves\nNott Forest vs Brighton\nWest Ham vs Liverpool\nChelsea vs Arsenal",
