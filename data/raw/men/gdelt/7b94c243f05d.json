  "body_text": "A former Chelsea star has urged Ben Chilwell to leave Stamford Bridge as soon as possible ‘for the sake of his career’.\nChilwell joined Chelsea from Leicester City in 2020 in a £45million transfer and has since made 107 appearances, winning the Champions League under Thomas Tuchel.\nThe left-back was made club vice-captain by Mauricio Pochettino in 2023, seemingly cementing his long-term future at the club, but that all changed following the appointment of Enzo Maresca last summer.\nThe new head coach informed the 28-year-old and several other players that they were not in his plans and exiled them from first-team training.\nMost of the ‘bomb squad’ were able to secure transfers away but Chilwell did not, with potential buyers put off by his high wages and poor injury record.\nTrue to his word, Maresca has hardly given the England international a chance, with his only appearance this season being a 45 minute cameo against Barrow in the Carabao Cup.\nWith his Chelsea career over, former Blues left-back Celestine Babayaro has told the defender he must move on this January, telling Ladbrokes: ‘In terms of players who might need to look at moving on, I’m looking at Ben Chilwell.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

But he can’t seem to get himself fit. He’s the sort of person who I’m looking at, who probably needs to think about his career.\n‘You know, he’s not as young as he once was, so he’s got to be thinking, “if I’m not getting games here, I need to move”.\n‘Apart from that, I don’t think anyone else will be thinking of leaving the club at this moment in time, because they’re pretty much all brand new signings.\n‘But, yeah, I just think Chilwell might be looking at his future, and thinking he needs to move on from the club.’\nThat might be easier said than done however, as there has been little interest in Chilwell so far this January transfer window.\nEverton have been tenuously linked with signing him on loan, something they’d only be able to do if they ended Armando Broja’s loan first, but they are also interested in fellow Chelsea outcasts Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Carney Chukwuemeka.\nTuchel, now England manager, will be hoping his former player can get more minutes elsewhere given that left-back is an area of weakness for the Three Lions.\nThough he brutally axed him from his side, Maresca has expressed regret over his treatment of Chilwell, recently saying: ‘Ben has been top. I have to say that, he has been top.\n‘Very professional, works hard. I feel shame because of that situation but in terms of behaviour, he has been very good.\nMore Trending\n‘I think Chilwell is a top full-back doing that job up and down and in the past he has won titles and won international caps. But I struggle to see Ben doing different kind of things.\n‘I can see Malo Gusto or Reece James or Marc Cucurella doing a different kind of job in the game.’\nChelsea, almost certainly without Chilwell, are next in action on Monday night when they host Wolves.\nThis article was first published on January 9\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Man Utd flop on verge of sealing January loan move away from Old Trafford\nMORE: Is Man Utd vs Brighton on TV today?
