The two sides have only faced off four times in official competition, with their last clash taking place in the CL group stage back in 2018, and both sides claiming a single-goal home win on that occasion.\nIt’s been an interesting year for Paris Saint-Germain since Kylian Mbappé left for Real Madrid on a free transfer in the summer, and after a tricky start, Luis Enrique’s men seem to have found their feet, pummeling Brest 10-0 on aggregate in the playoff round of the competition, as they’ve extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to three months.\nYoung, explosive, and less reliant on individual stars than at any point in the past decade, Les Parisiens play an intense pressing style with pace to burn down both flanks, and they will offer a definitive challenge to a Reds side that hasn’t played a must-win game in the competition since before Christmas.\nEnrique will be able to call on all of his players tomorrow night, including the ever-present centre-back pairing of Marquinhos and Willian Pacho, as well as top scorers Bradley Barcola and Ousmane Dembele.\nProjected Liverpool Lineup (4-3-3)\nAlisson; Alexander-Arnold, Konaté, van Dijk, Robertson; Gravenberch, Mac Allister, Szoboszlai; Diaz, Jota, Salah\nFollowing a week off, and with Southampton coming to town on the weekend, expect Arne Slot Liverpool to go as strong and predictable as possible, with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ibrahima Konaté, Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson featuring in the back line ahead of Alisson Becker. Joe Gomez and Conor Bradley miss out through injuries.\nIn midfield, only Tyler Morton is unavailable, and the favoured trio of Ryan Gravenberch, Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai look set to start, with Curtis Jones the only potential wild card.\nUp top, Cody Gakpo has been back in the team, but will be a game day decision following an unfortunate block in training yesterday, and as such, expect Mohamed Salah and Luis Diaz to flank Diogo Jota in the attack.\nWhat the Managers Said\nArne Slot: “Paris are one of the strongest teams in Europe, as you can see by how they’ve been playing in the last few months. It’s a great fixture to look forward to for anyone who loves football. We’ve both scored lots of goals this season and play in a similar way, so it should be interesting.”\nLuis Enrique: “I don’t think the first leg will define who qualifies, but it’s true that it’s a very, very important match for us. It’s difficult for our opponents to play at the Parc des Princes with the pressure and the atmosphere. It’s extraordinary and I hope we can benefit from it. These are two teams with many strengths that are going to face each other. On paper, it’s one of the best matches you can watch.”\nThe Officials (ITA)\nReferee: Davide Massa\nAssistant Referees: Ciro Carbone, Stefano Alassio\nFourth Official: Maurizio Mariani\nVAR: Aleandro Di Paolo, Daniele Chiff\nKickoff is set for 8:00PM GMT/3:00PM ET tomorrow, and television listings for the match can be found on LiveSoccerTV.\nIn the meantime, and as always, we’ll be keeping you updated with all the buildup to the game, including team news as it’s released, our live matchday thread, and post-match recaps from The Liverpool Offside staff.
