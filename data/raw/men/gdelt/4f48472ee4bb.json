Football-wise, I’m absolutely delighted with the way that we’re playing at this minute, we need a little bit of a cutting edge up top but I can’t ask any more than the way they’re playing.”\nRegarding Middlesbrough’s first-half penalty awarded after Jordan Spence tangled with Jordan Hugill as they challenged for an aerial ball, he said: “Do you know what, I think Hugill’s nowhere near to getting it. I think the two of them have gone in and I don’t think he’s anywhere near getting it.\n“But I understand why the referee gave it but I just don’t think he was ever going to get there.”\nLambert agreed that the first goal was always going to be crucial: “I thought the way we played was excellent. We kept the ball from them for long periods. They’ve probably got one player on the bench who would cost more than our whole team, that’s the difference in the size of squads, that’s the reality of it.\n“But the performance level, football-wise, absolutely brilliant they were to play the game I’m asking them to play it. But we’ve got to be more clinical at the top end, and that’s the been the story of the whole season.”\nAsked whether he hoped he’d have a better 2019, he added: “If we can get a few in, I think we need a little bit of help, as I’ve always said. But football-wise they’ve been excellent for me, I can’t ask any more.”\nQuizzed on whether there have been any developments regarding Middlesbrough striker Rudy Gestede, who is understood to be among the Blues’ targets, although with his very significant Boro wage believed to be a potential stumbling block in the way of any possible move, Lambert said: “No, I don’t know what the situation is.”\nIs the Benin international, an unused sub for the Teessiders today, a player he likes? “I like Messi but I cannae get him! I wouldn’t read too much into that.”\nIs any help on its way? “We’re trying, we need a few in. There have been names that we’ve tried to get, identified to get. It’s not just one or two, we need a few in to give them a hand.”\nTown have crucial home games against Millwall and Rotherham over the next fortnight. Asked how big those games are in the context of the season, Lambert responded: “Every game’s big. The first day of the season was our biggest game, so what’s changed from the first day of the season to now? What’s changed? Nothing.\n“Because the way the table is the way results are, the next two games are important. But what happened in August? What happened in September and October? If it was all going great I wouldn’t be sitting here. That’s the difference.\n“But the way the lads have been playing has been absolutely brilliant, absolutely brilliant the way they’re playing football, what they’re doing, the movement and the work-rate they’ve given me.\n“Absolutely brilliant and there’s one thing for sure, I’ve got their backs 100 per cent because they’re my team, absolutely no worries there whatsoever.\n“The crowd are with us, we need a little bit of help, a little bit more experience, lads that maybe know the league as well, I think that’s important.”\nLambert insists the Blues, still seven points plus goal difference from safety, can stay up.\n“Yes, the way we’re playing,” he added. “We need a little bit of help, and as I said before the crowd are right behind us.\n“Middlesbrough are one of the favourites to go up with the squad they’ve got but we came here and had a right good go at it.”\nMiddlesbrough manager Tony Pulis was pleased with his team's display but thought they ought to have won more comfortably given the chances they created.\n“Pleased with the performance, but disappointed again with the chances that we’ve created and not scored enough goals, or as many as we could have,\" he said.\n”But you can’t fault the players, they worked really hard today and I think they deserved to win the game.”\nPhoto: TWTD\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nFive against - nil for - last two matches tells it's own story.\nCouldn't agree more. Hurst didn't and Lambert doesn't really seem inclined to either. Have a go!\nPaul my man, I'm really trying my hardest to not only believe in, like & support you here and now, but also as the right (& bright!) man for us for the future... and I still do... However please please STOP! insulting not merely my eyesight, deductive reasoning but especially also my overall intelligence by excessively sugarcoating and beyond the actual performances of your INHERITED predominantly crap players and crap team as whole!!!\nYou did more or less the exact same as recently after last week 0-3 thrashing by OPR as well ...and this is imho getting \"old\" very very quickly!!! And furthermore also brings back woeful flashbacks to the majority of *objective* ITFC fans here of the toe-curlingly DELUSIONAL-sounding post game stunts by Muck McCarthy, particularly in his last couple of seasons here!\nSure, wishing primarily to instill & keep instilling! morale & hope into your quite possibly highly susceptible to being somewhat dejected relegation-threatened players & team is understandable, aye even commendable I guess ... but not quite the same as acting like one have been granted a \"license\" to in some degree or another *Telling Porkies* to the public & media post game!\nPS: Other than that (and ohhh one day hopefully dropping both \"Lionel\" Spence and Captain \"Calamity\" lol) please keep up THE GOOD WORK Mr. Lambert!\nPaul, lets be honest here, that is only half the story, need to stop giving goals away, defence not good enough, goal keeper not good enough is the rest of the story!\nI personally think we should be looking at quality loan signings, the type of players not getting games with their parent clubs, there could be some Gems out there who want first team competitive football. I dont think we should be looking at knackered journey men or inexperienced youngsters, just saying!\nBut there one player on the bench costing more than our whole team, shows as a club, what we're up against.\nNot only now, but the future also.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
