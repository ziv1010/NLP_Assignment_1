  "body_text": "Carlsberg and Erdinger release special Jürgen Klopp beer\nA collection of brews is being released by Carlsberg, with its partner Erdinger Weissbräu, to celebrate the reign of Jürgen Klopp as manager.\nKlopp, who is due to leave Liverpool this summer, is being celebrated through one beer for every game that he has manager of the football club. In all, it totals 491 75cl beers by Erdinger and Carlsberg, the latter being the official beer sponsor of the club.\nThe Believers Brew bottles will be available through the specialist sports memorabilia auctioneer Graham Budd from 16 May and all of the proceeds will go towards the official charity of the club, the LFC Foundation, to support its local causes.\nDoubters\nThe name of the beer comes from Klopp’s first press conference, where he promised to turn “Doubters to Believers”.\nIn terms of ingredients in the beer, it includes 50% Erdinger’s signature wheat malt, 50% Carlsberg signature pilsner malt and yeasts from both businesses in the two-stage brewing process. In addition, it uses a proportion of Red Barley colouring the beer with the same as the Liverpool kit.\nAs a result of the combination, the red beer is a combination of Danish and German brewing traditions.\nEach bottle in the batch of 491 will be numbered, linking back to individual, official fixtures that Klopp has managed.\nPartner Content\nNotable bottles include:\n- Bottle 206: Liverpool FC 4-0 FC Barcelona – UEFA Champions League, 7th May 2019, Anfield, Liverpool\n- Bottle 208: Liverpool FC 2-0 Tottenham Hotspur FC – UEFA Champions League, 1st June 2019, Metropolitano Stadium, Madrid\n- Bottle 264: Liverpool FC 5-3 Chelsea FC –Premier League, 22nd July 2020, Anfield, Liverpool\nSpeaking about the auction, Louise Bach, global sponsorships director at Carlsberg said: “Curiosity is a key value of ours, and football is arguably one of the most curious sports out there, with progression and improvement a constant aim.\n‘It has been a pleasure to watch Jürgen’s journey over the last nine seasons. What better way to celebrate such an icon than creating something truly unique, collaborating with Erdinger Weissbräu and raising money for a brilliant cause in the process.”\nDr Stefan Kreisz, Chairman of the Management Board at Erdinger Weissbräu added: ”With his passion, his demand for absolute quality and his enjoyment of life, he is a perfect fit for us. He is a role model in Liverpool and around the world for what can be achieved as a team.\n“So, it’s all the better that we can honour this great achievement in a very special way in collaboration with Carlsberg. With our shared passion for brewing, we have created something that will bring enjoyment to the lives of many people.”\nRelated news",
