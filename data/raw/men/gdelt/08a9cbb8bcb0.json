Burn is as slow as an oil tanker and has the same turning circle, and him and Schar have always got a card in them.’\n‘Success breeds success and confidence must be really high amongst the team. Newcastle don’t quite appear to be at the races just yet so this is a good time to play them. 2-0 to the famous team.’\n‘Newcastle are damned quick, but don’t like it up ’em. Forest win.’\n‘I really like Newcastle, and watch as many of their matches as I can.\nLike us they play with real heart, and I truly think our starting 11s are equal in quality and both managers are highly skilled. Where I think we will have them is with our subs – Sosa and Jota Silva will scare the heck out of them I think.\n2-1 Forest.’\n‘I think this is another game where it’s ours to lose. If we don’t make mistakes and continue to work as hard as we have been then we’ll have too much for Newcastle.\nThat said, it’s a dangerous time to be playing them. I didn’t see the Arsenal game but they’ve had a very tough run of fixtures and they’ve rarely looked uncompetitive, it was more just lacking a bit up front. Now they have Isak and Gordon finding some form, and Livramento has come in and looks good. And FFS someone close down Schar!’\n‘We can beat Newcastle, for sure. But they’re a really weird team this season – they’ve somewhat flattered to deceive oftentimes, having scraped out results they probably didn’t merit, but they more than deserved their win against Arsenal and Isak is back on form for them.\nThey’ll be dangerous and I can see it being a close game that will likely be decided by one goal. Wouldn’t be entirely disappointed with a draw to be honest – though given what our next two away fixtures are, it’d be nice to get 3 points from our home games to keep us in a decent position.’\n‘I think we can beat them–them besting Arsenal, in this moment, is not as big a deal as it would seem.’\n‘Bit of a re-post I know, but my hatred is so great I have to scream it twice.\nThe only club I truly HATE is Newcastle United. Geordies! Give me strength. Ant and dec, Robson Green, Paul Gascoigne, Jimmy Nail, Cheryl Cole/Tweedy, Geordie Shores, 1974, Hairy Biker, Denise Welch, ALAN SHEARER!! (On my excempt list is Bobby Robson RIP & 1980’s Viz). I go up Northumberland often coz it has amazing beaches and a sister in law married one of the local tw.ts. Soon as I hear that accent – my teeth start itching and my right eye waters & twitches. Please let this be our biggest win of the season!!’\n‘Pope in goal. That’s the weakness.’\n‘I feeling good so I agree with some other posters, we’re going to smash them 4-0. Not often I make a score prediction, but with our pretty much unchanged XI and subs we can take on anyone.’\n‘I think this could be our toughest test yet.\nSnap your hand off for a point to keep the run going.’\nPOST-MATCH\n‘I just think Newcastle were the better side and their fluid system didn’t allow us to be our compact selfs, let’s not be too hard on ourselves. Best team we have faced so far this season, they won the midfield which won them the game.’\n‘They had a midfield of Guimares, Willock, Longstaff, with Joelinton also getting involved. And people are slagging our midfield 2 for not competing. The reality is Howe outthought Nuno.\nWe were outnumbered in midfield, and some players were incredibly casual on the ball. MGW, CHO, Aina, Anderson and Sosa were all particularly guilty.\nBut Newcastle are the team we should aspire to be. Quality players with a good plan and a fantastic work ethic. I don’t think we’re far off. We just need to work out how to impose our gameplan, or a way to adapt it, when good teams get on top of us.’\n‘Outclassed all over the park.\nOur attackers were playing like pi.. heads in MGW and CHO with Elanga being as ineffective as usual in open play.\nWood was ragdolled all game by Burn who was allowed to foul him until his heart was content by Antony Taylor. MGW had his worst game in a Forest shirt worthy of questioning whether he should play the next one, only for Anderson to be as equally stupid and rubbish with the ball.\nA major factor behind our rise in the league is the physicality of the midfield, but when our strongest and most effective CM in Yates is outmuscled, you know it will be a long day. The kinda game where you wish you had Danilo and Sangare to come on to offer some pace and power rather than powderpuff JWP.\nFor them all to be so off it I’d say we either let the 3rd position get in our heads and panicked or we’re carrying a lot injuries. Newcastle were excellent, but we’ve played excellent Brighton, Chelsea and Liverpool and we were miles off those standards.’\n‘I’d come here tonight to say exactly this.\nNewcastle’s single biggest strength, for all the talk about the likes of Isak and Gordon, is the really physical midfield that takes other teams out of the game. Bruno, Longstaff and Joelinton, plus Willock to a lesser extent, are just like a buzzsaw, arguably one of the strongest midfields in the league at what they do. Whilst Yates and Dominguez have done so well of late this was a game that we needed to load the midfield physically, something we couldn’t really do in the absence of Danilo and Sangare. I would probably have dropped Elanga and played Anderson for that reason if I was Nuno because we had no chance of winning that midfield battle with what we put out there which is precisely how they win games.\nI would wager that that game could have gone very differently if we had been able to call on Danilo and Sangare today but as it is we have to take our medicine, accept we were beaten by the better side on the day, and rebuild to go again after the break.’\n‘Anderson looked like he was trying too hard, which I understand but it just wasn’t working.\nCan’t add much more to the general comments today, outplayed in every department really. We can play a lot better than that and far too many players weren’t at the races, particularly going forward as we created virtually nothing all game.’\n‘I think they just restricted our out balls and MGW struggled to find anybody in space. Kind of why we need other options than CHO/Elanga simply standing out wide waiting for the ball.\nContrast to Isak moving all over the place, Langstaff making runs through gaps, Joelinton coming out wide and linking up with Livramento etc. A lot of movement for them, very little for us. Our Plan A is very good but we need a Plan B.’\n‘Back down to earth we go. We were outclassed today by a very good team, though we didn’t help ourselves at times.\nStill, 5th – on goal difference. Not too shabby at all at the 3rd international break. Well done, lads.’\n‘To give some perspective we have a way to go to compete with teams with a pair of fullback brought for £75m, a £70m striker and two subs combined at over £100. Not to mention their keeper signed in the summer for £25 who couldn’t get in the squad\n£10 Pope\n£35 L. Hall\n£15D. Burn\n£4 F. Schär\n£40T. Livramento\n£30J. Willock. £60 S. Tonali\n£42 Bruno Guimarães\nS. Longstaff\n£44 Joelinton\n£70 Isak £12 W. Osula\n£46 Gordon £44 H. Barnes.’\n‘Refreshing to see the calm and collected response from all on here. Bad day at the office, beaten by the better side, move on…I like it! What happened to burning the house down every time we lost?’\n‘Bad day, better and more expensive line up than us, out muscled, re group and go again.’\n‘On the upside it’ll halt the media overcooking our good start with comments about us “doing a Leicester”.\nThis was going to happen one of these days and there’s a broad post-match consensus in this thread, which isn’t always the case. Yes, Newcastle are several seasons further ahead of us on the journey. Yes, they played well and yes, we were off colour.\nA mid table finish in which we claim a few big scalps along the way would be very, very good for year three.’\n‘Funny how 1 loss completely can ruin you mentally, looking at the fixtures Im now struggling to see us winning more than 1 game between now and the New Year.\nFootball is just mental torture, I wish I could just relax and enjoy it for what it is sometimes.’\n‘Not read through the comments but my thoughts on watching the game was the better side won on the day.\nIt was going to happen sooner than later and they look a good side.\nNo reason to think “the bubble has burst” or anything like that, we can get something from the next four games and I think we will. You Reds!’\n‘Just back – they’re a good team and we had a bit of a shocker! Too many players off it or weren’t allowed to play. No complaints with the result.’\n‘Kind of inevitable we’d not have a game go our way. Two fairly similar teams, Newcastle obviously a year or two ahead of us in terms of a team that’s been built and they are a very good side on their day. They were a bit better than us all over the pitch.’\n‘Chalk that one up as beaten by the better team. Newcastle upped it in the 2nd half and we didn’t have the answer. Very sloppy in possession all game meant we never really got up a head of steam at any point in the game.\nRegroup and go again after the break.’\n‘Newcastle always seem to have our number. Frustrating but take it on the chin. At least we’re not Spurs.’\n‘We can’t always implement a perfect plan against teams more established and better on paper than us, today was one those days, Newcastle just had too much for us in that 2nd half. Fair play to them’\n‘Well the result was fair, I think we can all agree the better side won. I thought CHO was awful today, and should have been taken off during the first half. Also you could see how the game was going when we got to half time, and hoped that he would have changed it then. Wood has done wonders for us, but we were not getting any crosses into the box so would have put Awoniyi on at half time for Wood and also MGW was not in the game so again would have put Anderson on for him at half time. Honestly, don’t think that would have changed the result much, still would have lost but maybe have put up a better fight.’\n‘Yates, in particular, really struggled. He could easily have been sent off early in the game and he looked (not in a good way) in a different league to Newcastle’s midfielders. There are a lot of games in which he should and will start, but if we’re looking to take the game to decent opposition at home, Danilo is much better.’\n‘Yates was outclassed. Like men against boys in midfield. He’s been great recently but he was taught a lesson against Bruno.\nOur defence simply had too much to deal with as our midfield was so poor.’\n‘Can we skip opposition post match comments please? That bloodstained club and it’s odious complicit fanbase just physically repulse me and I can’t deal with it.’\n‘Poor performance against a Newcastle side that are better than their league position suggests. No complaints about the result, the better side won.’\n‘I think they deserve credit for a lot of that too. Against West Ham it took one centre back switching off on Wood to go from him not doing much, to scoring a free header and multiple articles about how great he is. Newcastle never gave him that space once\nLivermento and Hall impressed me too, can see why they’re so highly rated and in or around the England squad. I completely agree we lacked a bit of quality at times, but it was very rare thst we weren’t being rushed, even if we got space they quickly had players on us. Quick, big, strong guys who worked hard and well drilled, imo you could see why when they had those guys fit a lot from that side was able to make the champions league not too long ago. If they avoid injuries they’ll be right up there again imo.’\n‘Theyve come off of beating Arsenal, deserved winners against us too.\nI don’t want to sound too bitter but I’m having to remember that their goalscorers cost £140m and you could kind of tell. In fact their starting line up cost £304m, ours £94m. They bought on £105m worth of subs, we bought on £67m.\nI’m only saying the numbers because of the fact that the progress that they’ve made hasn’t been quick or cheap and they are at present still trying to catch us up in terms of league position, this league ain’t easy (Ask Spurs).\nTactically, their fullbacks were OK (And cost £65m) but were massively helped by their wide players doubling up on our wingers and effectively nullifying our threat and other areas of threat weren’t quite there.’\n‘I don’t want people to think im being a downer cause compared to past couple of years its so much better. I just want to bring a sense of reality into the conversation. Newcastle were being talked about like a team on our level. Considering we were at home today they were above us in terms of levels. It is what it is, I’m not complaining it’s awesome to be where we are I am just saying what I see. I think we’ll have a humongous battle for a european spot watching that today. However just soak that in, we are discussing a potential European spot that’s amazing in itself.’\n‘Credit to Newcastle, they gave us a tough test and their quality in the final third told. They’ve got goals in them from several areas and can punish you with that quality.’\n‘A lot of our players had off games but not sure if that is just the fact they came up against a well drilled team of good players.’\n‘Nuno will be absolutely livid with that. Good thing about these sorts of defeats – especially in the position we’re in – is that they give you lots to analyse and improve on going forward. Up to Nuno and staff to make this a valuable learning curve. They seem like the sort of group that’ll be angry with themselves too and eager to respond.\nGod I just despise them though. Really get under my skin.’\n‘We’re a genuinely good premier league team with a quality manager. We’re fine, and just 3 years on from Championship relegation zone and 2 years from having to scrape together a premier league side. Getting a squad as high in quality as Newcastle is the “next step” I think. But for now at least we made them work for the win!’\n‘Thoroughly outplayed. We need to assert ourselves on the ball better, especially in the middle of the park, in these types of games’\n‘Would have taken a point at half time. Newcastle were excellent and deserved the win. We on the other hand were uncharacteristically sloppy. Was always going to happen sooner or later.’\nNottingham Forest 1 Newcastle 3 – Sunday 10 November 2pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nIsak 54, Joelinton 72, Barnes 83\nForest:\nMurillo 21\n(Half-time stats in brackets)\nPossession was Newcastle 56% (60%) Forest 44% (40%)\nTotal shots were Newcastle 17 (7) Forest 9 (3)\nShots on target were Newcastle 6 (2) Forest 3 (1)\nCorners were Newcastle 5 (4) Forest 4 (2)\nTouches in the box Newcastle 33 (20) Forest 17 (8)\nNewcastle United team v Nottingham Forest:\nPope; Livramento, Schar, Burn, Hall; Longstaff, Bruno, Willock (Tonali 69), Gordon (Barnes 80), Isak (Osula 90+8), Joelinton\nUnused Subs:\nTargett, Jacob Murphy, Dubravka, Miley, Almiron, Kelly\n(Nottingham Forest 1 Newcastle 3 – Match ratings and comments on all Newcastle United players – Read HERE)\n(Nuno Espirito Santo impressive comments after Newcastle United outclass Nottingham Forest – Read HERE)\n(BBC Sport comments from ‘neutrals’ – Interesting on Newcastle United after win at Nottingham Forest – Read HERE)\n(Nottingham Forest 1 Newcastle 3 – Instant Newcastle United fan/writer reaction – Read HERE)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
