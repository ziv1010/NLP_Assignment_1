Where Spurs waddled through the domestic season but capped the campaign with the Europa League, Villarreal were knocked out in the first knock-out round of the same competition but comfortably finished fifth in La Liga.\nThe upshot is that both teams, by their own routes of choice, have made a triumphant return to the Champions League. The league phase draw pits them against one another in the first game.\nMarcelino will be plotting a modest upset but the Yellow Submarine have dropped points in their last two matches.\nAfter winning their first two La Liga matches of the season, Villarreal head for London on the back of a draw with Celta Vigo and Saturday's 2-0 loss at Atletico Madrid.\nCanadian striker Tajon Buchanan already has three league goals to his name and the only other Villarreal players with more than one in the early part of the season is former Arsenal flop Nicolas Pepe.\nThere are plenty of recognisable names in the Villarreal squad but no face more familiar to Spurs than that of Manor Solomon. The winger is on loan at Villarreal from Spurs and is eligible to play against his parent club, whose interest in keeping him long-term appears wafer-thin at best.\nNew manager Frank will lead a team out in the Champions League for the first time and confidence will be high.\nSpurs have conceded one goal and lost one game this season, both courtesy of a 1-0 reverse against Bournemouth. Beating Burnley 3-0, Manchester City 2-0 and West Ham United 3-0 is indicative of a team going about its business with minimal fuss.\nLevy oversaw some positive transfer business in his final days at the club. Spurs signed both Mohammed Kudus and Xavi Simons as well as making Kevin Danso and Mathys Tel permanent signings\nThey've also brought Randal Kolo Muani and Joao Palhinha in on loan from Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich respectively.\nThat gives Frank plenty with which to play and their fine early-season form makes Spurs favourites to win at home on Tuesday. They should be confident of beating the majority of their league phase opponents and what better way to start than on their own turf this week?\nFourFourTwo's prediction\nSpurs 2-0 Villarreal\nDefensively sound Spurs can be happy with their start in the league and the stadium will be bouncing for this one.\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses.
