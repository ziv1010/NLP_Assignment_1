[He] improved every day, gave it his best shot and then the rest was done by his talent.\"\nFrankfurt have invested in the \"team around the team\" in an effort to maximise the development of young stars such as Ekitike.\nOn top of video analysts, performance and athletic coaches, there are psychologists, nutritionists and other experts working individually with players.\n\"The further you reach up to your ceiling, the more you have to look for percentages to improve a little bit here, a little bit there,\" explains Hardung.\nWith Ekitike lacking minutes when he first arrived, it was a case of bringing him up to the speed and physicality of Bundesliga football.\n\"We're a high-intensity league, with a lot of runs, intensive runs, sprints,\" says Hardung. \"So you have to prepare to be able to do that and not to get exhausted too early in the game, because you still want to have them fresh and ready to score 1-0 in the 80th, 90th minute.\n\"You have to put in some work to really be able to manage the load. That's what he has done.\"\nThe staff also worked closely on \"details\" to help Ekitike improve his scoring chances.\n\"What position in the game we feel he would be more dangerous to the opponent in and around the box,\" says Hardung, listing these details. \"What kind of shooting positions fit him very well and what kind of spaces he could attack to be even more of a threat.\"\n'We want to be successful... we're ambitious'\nEkitike's departure came just six months after Marmoush departed to join Manchester City for £59m, having joined Frankfurt for free a season and a half earlier.\nIncluding Ekitike, the top eight most expensive departures from the Bundesliga this summer headed for the Premier League - among them were Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool, Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig to Manchester United and Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart to Newcastle.\nHardung can understand why English clubs are shopping in the German top flight.\n\"We're a very intensive league,\" he says. \"That can show Premier League clubs players who play well in the Bundesliga can have a good impact.\"\nBut recruiting players with a high potential resale value is not the primary objective for Frankfurt.\n\"We're not necessarily looking for a selling market afterwards,\" explains the 35-year-old Hardung. \"We want to be successful, right? We're a big club, we're a traditional club. We're ambitious. That's our primary goal, to get a competitive football team.\n\"We felt like doing that works best for us if we develop players, making them better, because we cannot spend the amount of money other clubs can.\"\nThe evidence suggests those methods are working. Frankfurt won the Europa League in 2022 and have gradually improved their league performance since, finishing third in the Bundesliga last season, a joint club record, with the division's youngest average team.\nSelling their stars may not be the goal, but Frankfurt are always prepared and the recruitment work starts early.\n\"The day after the transfer window closes, it's the preparation of the next transfer window,\" says Hardung. \"What changes may happen in the future and how do we react to that?\"\nFor younger players, they may even plan for several windows' time - establishing a pathway from youth to first-team football.\nThis summer, the departing Ekitike was replaced by Jonathan Burkardt, who scored 17 Bundesliga goals for Mainz last season and has won five Germany caps.\nThe 25-year-old, signed for £18m, has scored four goals in his first six league games and three in two Champions League matches so far this season.\n\"The first question we always ask ourselves is 'what do we really want?',\" says Hardung. \"It's important to really analyse your squad, look for the strengths and abilities you are missing or you want to add.\"\nIt is a process that begins with data, and Hardung says Frankfurt have the resources to monitor the \"whole football world\", identifying key performance indicators and creating algorithms to meet the club's needs, screening that database for targets.\nPlayers who tick the boxes will be flagged, before being assessed on a more \"qualitative\" basis.\n\"Then the scouting department really kicks in,\" adds Hardung. \"Trying to dig deeper into those players on the shortlist, trying to get this list even shorter by watching film, technical filming, technical scouting.\n\"The last part will always be live scouting, but trying to make it as efficient as possible - not have a list of 100 players our scouts have to watch live, only a couple we really feel after looking at the data and films could be interesting for us.\n\"The last step would be us driving out, watching the players live, before making the final decision - which player we feel like we should really commit to.\"\nHardung believes the reputation Frankfurt have forged in developing talent helps prove they \"walk the talk\" when looking to recruit future stars.\n\"If you sit down with players and agents or families to draw them a picture of what you want to do, of the philosophy and strategy you try to work with, if you have a track record of players that have gone that way, that pathway with us together, that helps,\" he says.\nUnderpinning all their work is a humble nature. As Hardung puts it, the club \"know our spot, know our place, know where we come from and also know our strength\". This means making life as tough as possible for so-called bigger teams, such as Liverpool on Wednesday.\n\"The point is for us to always try to be a little better than yesterday,\" says Hardung in conclusion. \"And I think if we really implement this culture within the club, within our team, then it's really tough to compete against us.\"",
