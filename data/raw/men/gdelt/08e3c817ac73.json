Zinchenko, Tierney, at the moment, is still there, Tomiyasu there, as well.\n“And the thing with Tavares is that Arsenal can probably, if not definitely get a profit off him because he’s only 23 years of age and the fee that Arsenal paid in 2021 for Tavares was only £8m.\n“That means that if they do choose to sell him, they’ll be able to cash in and make a tidy profit, which will reflect well on their books, on Financial Fair Play and provide an opportunity to clear some squad space in order to no doubt bolster in other positions.”\nAinsley Maitland-Niles\nMaitland-Niles joined Southampton on a season-long loan deal last summer and has made 21 appearances in all competitions at the time of writing.\nThe Saints, who are currently at the bottom of the Premier League, reportedly have an option to make the move permanent in the summer and the 25-year-old has not ruled out the possibility of extending his time on the south coast.\n“Yeah, if the opportunity presents itself, of course,” he said. “But at the same time I’m not really focused on that at the moment, it’s about the games at hand.”\nWhile Maitland-Niles is renowned for his versatility, Arsenal have plenty of cover at right-back and in midfield and are reportedly looking at new signings in both positions so they will probably look to sell him before his contract expires in 2024.\nMohamed Elneny\nDespite signing a one-year contract extension in February, Elneny still faces an uncertain future at Arsenal.\nThe midfielder, who is currently sidelined with a knee injury, has made just eight appearances in all competitions in 2022/23 as Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey are two of the first names on Arteta’s teamsheet.\nArsenal also bought Jorginho in January and are now looking to sign West Ham United’s Declan Rice, which would push Elneny further down the pecking order.\nThe Egypt international has recently been linked with a move to Aston Villa and may seek an exit in order to play more regularly.\nReiss Nelson\nAfter spending the 2021/22 season on loan at Eredivisie side Feyenoord, Nelson returned to the Emirates for the current campaign.\nBut the winger has struggled with injury problems and currently finds himself behind Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard in the pecking order.\nHe has subsequently found first-team opportunities hard to come by in 2022/23 but has still managed to remind Arsenal of his abilities.\nThe 23-year-old has three goals and two assists in four Premier League appearances this season – including one crucial last-gasp winner against Bournemouth, which could prove to be huge in the title race.\nDespite those heroics, his future at Arsenal remains up in the air as his current contract looks set to expire at the end of the season.\nSpeaking exclusively to TEAMtalk, reporter Graeme Bailey revealed that Arteta wants the winger to extend his stay at the Emirates.\nBut Nelson needs guarantees over playing time and will not commit to the new deal Arsenal are offering him until he gets more minutes.\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Brighton are looking to sign Nelson on a free transfer in the summer and a move to the Amex Stadium appeals to the winger.\nReiss Nelson striker against Bournemouth has been voted Arsenal's Goal of the Month for March, getting 52 % votes.\nUnforgettable moment. pic.twitter.com/ZO6984Mh1D\n— AfcVIP⁴⁹ (@VipArsenal) April 12, 2023\nFolarin Balogun\nBalogun joined Reims on a season-long loan deal last summer and has been enjoying a hugely-productive spell with the French outfit.\nThe 21-year-old has registered 18 goals in 29 league appearances and only trails Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe and Lille’s Jonathan David in the Ligue 1 scoring charts.\nHowever, the England Under-21 international remains down the pecking order at Arsenal with both Gabriel Jesus and Eddie Nketiah ahead of him and The Atheltic revealed that he wants to continue operating as a first-choice striker next term.\n“There’s discussions that need to take place and it’s not a decision that will only with me,” he said recently. “The club will let me know their point of view and I’m sure we’ll come to an agreement.”\nWhile Balogun is highly-rated at the Emirates, he will have two years left on his contract this summer and it could be the perfect time to cash in on him before reinvesting that money in other areas.\nAccording to reports, the likes of AC Milan, Inter Milan, Bayern Munich, RB Leipzig, Monaco and Marseille are all keen to take him off Arsenal’s hands.\nNicolas Pepe\nArsenal’s record signing, Pepe joined the Gunners from Lille in a £72m deal in 2019 but failed to live up to expectations.\nAfter being usurped by Bukayo Saka, the right-winger returned to France and joined Nice on a season-long loan deal last summer.\nHe’s registered eight goals and one assist in 27 appearances in all competitions this season and L’Equipe claims that Pepe is open to the idea of remaining at the Ligue 1 side.\n“I am very happy at Nice,” he said recently. “There are two important months to come for this club. I want to concentrate on that and I’m not sure after that. There will be discussions.”\nThe Ivory Coast international still has another year remaining on his £140,000 per week deal at the Emirates and this summer represents Arsenal’s best chance to recoup some of that £72m.",
