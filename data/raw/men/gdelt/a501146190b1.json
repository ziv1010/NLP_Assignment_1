He’s always opening his mouth”, said Dembele to Hojbjerg.\nThe Frenchman was referring to Marseille captain Leonardo Balerdi, who ended Sunday’s game with an error leading to goal in the 5-0 loss.\nAccording to a report from L’Equipe, leading members from Marseille’s supporter groups met to discuss the club’s precarious situation after a string of damaging losses.\nThe report stated that two principal demands arose from this talk, the first being for Roberto De Zerbi to step down from his role as head coach, which materialised after the Argentinian manager reached a mutual agreement with Marseille to leave the club.\nThe second demand was for Balerdi to be stripped of the captaincy, after receiving heavy criticism for weeks during Marseille’s poor run of form.\nTime will tell whether Marseille decide to also punish the Argentine centre-back before they return to domestic action against Strasbourg on Saturday.\n« VÉRITÉ » : le film Ligue 1+ de Paris SG/OM 🍿Des images 𝗘𝗫𝗖𝗟𝗨𝗦𝗜𝗩𝗘𝗦 à retrouver vendredi, à 18h, sur Ligue 1+ avant Rennes - Paris SG ! pic.twitter.com/MB1RYWs4KBFebruary 11, 2026\nKedar Bayley is a trained journalist specialising in culture reporting.
