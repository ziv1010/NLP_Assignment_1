Al Hilal finished second in the 2024-25 Pro League behind Al-Ittihad.\nAl Hilal, who were due to face King’s Cup runners-up Al Qadsiah in the Super Cup semi-finals on August 20, have been replaced by AFC Champions League winners Al Ahli.\nSince Al-Ittihad won the Pro League and King’s Cup, the extra Super Cup spot was awarded to Al Nassr – the third-placed team in the league – who they face in the semis on August 19.",
