From Formula One to football and now Rugby Union, Red Bull's influence can be clearly seen in some of the biggest sports on the planet.\nThe first sports team sponsored by Red Bull was EC Salzburg in the Austrian Hockey League, and the first athlete to receive an individual sponsorship was Austrian F1 driver Gerhard Berger. Many of the brand's earliest deals involved extreme sports such as cliff diving, BMX and skiing, but it wasn't long before Red Bull made its presence felt in more mainstream sports.\nTo date, Red Bull partners with 900 athletes, artists and teams, including the two Formula One teams and several top-tier football clubs. It comes as it was confirmed Red Bull has taken ownership of Newcastle Falcons, which will be renamed Newcastle Red Bulls. To look at how the company has taken over the sporting world, it is best to focus on individual sports and the impact Red Bull has had.\nFormula One\nIn 1995, Red Bull sponsored Swiss F1 team Sauber, but by 2004, the company wanted more than just its logo on a car, so it bought Jaguar and rebranded the team as Red Bull Racing. A year later, it expanded to a second team, originally named Scuderia Toro Rosso but now known as Racing Bulls.\nBoth teams have scored victories in Grand Prix races, and Red Bull Racing has been one of the most dominant teams in the sport in the last 15 years, winning the Constructors Championship in from 2010 to 2013, as well as in 2022 and 2023. Drivers have had individual success with the team too, with Sebastian Vettel winning the Driver's Championship in 2010 to 2013, while Max Verstappen won the title from 2021 to 2024.\nMany would argue that those involved with Red Bull are the main characters of Netflix's documentary series Drive to Survive, which has taken the fandom around F1 to another level. The recent Formula One film starring Brad Pitt also heavily featured the brand, as it transcends sport and moves into entertainment.\nFootball\nRed Bull made its first foray into the beautiful game in 2005, when the company purchased SV Austria Salzburg, the renaming of which was heavily criticised by supporters. This started a period of dominance for the Austrian side, who have won 14 of a possible 19 Bundesliga titles, and have regularly competed in the UEFA Champions League.\nAlso in 2005, Red Bull purchased the New York based Major League Soccer team MetroStars, renaming the club New York Red Bulls, and creating a state-of-the-art 25,000 capacity stadium in New Jersey. The New York Red Bulls has been a large part of the growing popularity of the MLS, and boasts legendary ex-players like Thierry Henry.\nThe biggest football venture that Red Bull has undertaken is its acquisition of SSV Markranstädt, now known as RB Leipzig, in 2009. At the time, the club was in Germany's fifth division, with the goal of reaching the Bundesliga in ten years, which is ultimately succeeding in doing two years early.\nAs with Red Bull's other sporting ventures, RB Leipzig has been divisive and the subject of protests from fans, but its rapid success cannot be denied. The club has won trophies domestically, and even reached the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League in 2020.\nAs with its involvement in other sports, Red Bull has sponsored several huge football clubs, include Leeds United and Atletico Madrid, who now feature the logo as their primary shirt sponsor. When it comes to football, it feels as if Red Bull's influence is only growing, and the same can now be said for rugby.\nRugby Union\nNow developing local rugby talent, where Red Bull has completed a full takeover of Newcastle Falcons, renaming the club as Newcastle Red Bulls and bringing major investment. The club will remain at its Kingston Park stadium home, something which is sure to reassure diehard fans.\nThis new financial support will bring with it a commitment to developing local rugby talent through a strengthened academy program, with one of the main goals being to deliver a world class fan experience and embrace the innovative approach that Red Bull has brought to its sports initiatives across the world.\nOliver Mintzlaff, Red Bull CEO Corporate Projects and Investments, said: \"Together, we aim to elevate rugby to new heights and deliver unforgettable moments for our fans. We’re delighted to have acquired Newcastle Red Bulls and look forward to empowering the club to reach its full competitive potential.\"",
