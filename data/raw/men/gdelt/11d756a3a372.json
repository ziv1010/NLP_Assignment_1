The Wolves are looking to kick off their revival this Saturday, 22 November (kick-off: 15:30 CET), in the home game against the Werkself. The lowdown on our next opponents.\nThese are difficult times for VfL Wolfsburg. They only have eight points after ten matchdays with two wins, two draws and six defeats to date. The Wolves are currently 14th in the table, just three points ahead of bottom club FC Heidenheim, and they were knocked out of the DFB Pokal in the second round at home to Bundesliga 2 side Holstein Kiel (0-1). The club management reacted to the ongoing sporting downturn following the 2-1 defeat at Werder Bremen and parted company with coach Paul Simonis during the international break. The Dutchman came to Wolfsburg in the summer from Eredivisie club Go Ahead Eagles. After a decent start to the season with a win at Heidenheim (3-1) and two draws against Mainz 05 (1-1) and FC Köln (3-3), the campaign rapidly went downhill. This was followed by seven defeats in the Bundesliga and DFB Pokal, interrupted only by a win at newly promoted Hamburg SV (1-0). Most recently in Bremen, the Wolves led 1-0 through Mattias Svanberg, but then collapsed in the second half and conceded two goals in the closing stages. While Werder had 15 shots on goal, the hosts did not have a single goal attempt in the second half.\n48 hours later, Peter Christiansen, managing director sport at VfL, explained the dismissal of coach Simonis: \"In football, results and points are what count in the end, and the development over recent weeks has not gone as we all hoped. After an intensive dialogue with the supervisory board, we have come to the conclusion that a change is now needed in order to bring stability and success on the pitch. We all bear responsibility for the current situation - the sporting management, the coaching staff, the players and the entire club.\" Just a few days after Simonis, sporting director Sebastian Schindzielorz also had to leave.\nTurbulent days for the Wolves, who now want to press the reset button. Former U19 head coach Daniel Bauer has taking over the first team until further notice. Last season, the 43-year-old stepped in on an interim basis for two matchdays at the end of the season following the departure of Ralph Hasenhüttl and he secured four points for VfL against TSG Hoffenheim (2-2) and Borussia Mönchengladbach (1-0). Bauer is now set to breathe new life into an ambitious team that has rarely been able to fulfil its potential.\nThe interim coach has only had two training sessions with the full squad to prepare for the game against the Werkself. After the 2-1 defeat in Bremen, 13 players were away on international duty with their respective national teams. Two attacking players returned to Wolfsburg early due to injury. While the muscular problems of top scorer and provider Mohamed Amoura (four goals, two assists) are probably not so serious as to keep him out on Saturday, Adam Daghim will miss the game against Bayer 04. \"He has a back problem that we need to treat now. That's why he's definitely not available for next weekend,\" explained Bauer on Tuesday. Despite the short preparation time with the squad, the VfL coach is optimistic ahead of the important home game against the Black and Reds. Some of the international players \"already know our basic approach and our principles - that makes it easier,\" said the 43-year-old.\nAt least there was some positive news in terms of personnel: Midfielders Yannick Gerhardt and Lovro Majer, who had to miss the last match in Bremen, returned to full training. New marquee signing Vinicius Souza (Sheffield United) and captain Maximilian Arnold have almost always featured in the centre of midfield. Souza has been in the starting line-up in all ten Bundesliga matches, as has goalkeeper Kamil Grabara.\nThe VfL defence currently presents the most issues. Bauer not only still has to manage without Joakim Maehle (shoulder), Kilian Fischer (ankle) and Rogerio (knee). Two days after the dismissal of coach Paul Simonis, the club announced that centre-back Moritz Jenz has suffered a serious muscle injury and will be out until further notice. Midfielder Jesper Lindström (groin), one of six Danes in the VfL team, is also still sidelined. His compatriot Christian Eriksen, who has been under contract with the Wolves since September, has recently been a fixture in attacking midfield.\nEriksen, Lindström, Maehle and strikers Jonas Wind and Andreas Skov Olsen are all well known to Bayer 04 head coach Kasper Hjulmand from his time as the Denmark coach. He has a particularly emotional connection with Eriksen. The record-breaking Denmark international (147 caps) suffered a sudden cardiac arrest during the opening match of the 2021 European Championship in Copenhagen. The now 33-year-old later fought his way back to life and onto the pitch with a pacemaker and, after his time at Inter Milan, most recently played in the Premier League for Brentford and Manchester United (from 2022-2025). VfL Wolfsburg are his first club in the Bundesliga.\nVfL have not won any of their last 13 Bundesliga home games at the Volkswagen Arena (7 draws, 6 defeats). That is a negative club record. In fact, the Wolves have only won one match in front of their own fans this calendar year - a 5-1 victory over Mönchengladbach in January 2025. Wolfsburg's home record against Bayer 04 is also sobering. VfL have been without a win at home against the Werkself for nine games in over ten years (3 draws, 6 defeats). Wolfsburg have scored just one goal in the last seven home games against Leverkusen.\nSo far this season, the Lower Saxony side's attack has also proved to be underwhelming: VfL have only scored five times in their last eight games. Nevertheless, Wolfsburg could certainly be in a better position in the table had they not conceded ten points after taking the lead - a league high. Strikingly, VfL have already conceded important points in the closing stages or stoppage time on three occasions, most recently in the 2-1 defeat in Bremen.\nTwo new signings provide VfL's biggest goal threat: Mohamed Amoura, signed in the summer from Belgian Champions League participants Union Saint-Gilloise, is the top scorer and provider with four goals and two assists. The Algeria international can play as a centre-forward or left winger. Adam Daghim, who joined on loan from RB Salzburg, has scored twice so far and brings enormous pace to the team. The currently injured Denmark U21 international is the fifth-fastest player in the league at 35.79 kilometres per hour. Central midfielder Mattias Svanberg, who has recently been deployed more often as a left winger, is also capable of scoring. The Swede has netted twice so far this season. The trio of Amoura, Daghim and Svanberg account for eight of VfL's twelve goals. Top talent Dzenan Pejcinovic has yet to score in his eight appearances this term. However, it is quite possible that interim coach Bauer will rely even more heavily on the Germany U21 international in future. The two players know each other very well from the VfL U19s, with Pejcinovic becoming a Bundesliga striker under Bauer.\nWerkself-TV - 13.02.2026\nWerkself-TV shows the highlights of the Bayer 04 women's 2-1 win against FC Köln on the 18th matchday of the Google Pixel Frauen-Bundesliga 2025/26.\nShow more Werkself-TV - 13.02.2026\nBayer 04 have secured the services of Serbia U19 international Aleksa Damjanovic for next season. The 17-year-old centre-forward will move from Red Star Belgrade to Leverkusen in the summer on a long-term contract. The 1.98 metre tall striker is regarded as one of the most promising attacking talents in Europe and has recently impressed with strong performances at both first team and youth level. Managing director sport Simon Rolfes and director of football Kim Falkenberg particularly praise his finishing, heading ability and physical presence in the penalty area.\nShow more Bundesliga - 13.02.2026\nAfter seven games without a win, the 2-1 home victory against VfB Stuttgart last weekend provided a real boost for the Kiezkicker and their fans.

On Saturday, 14 February (kick-off: 15:30 CET), the Hamburg side face Bayer 04 for the third time this season, with the last game against the Werkself less than a fortnight ago. Despite the defeat in the DFB Pokal quarter-final, coach Alexander Blessin's team can take some positives from that game.
