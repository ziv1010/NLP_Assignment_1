  "body_text": "As Decision Day approaches for the 2023 MLS Regular Season, the End of Year Awards voting is in full swing. Winners are selected by a weighted-average system of votes across three key categories: journalists, club technical staff, and MLS players.\nWith the window for voting closing on Monday, October 23, here is a breakdown for all of Sounders FC’s nominees:\nLandon Donovan MLS MVP: Jordan Morris and Stefan Frei\nSplitting time this season between striker and left wing, Morris has enjoyed a productive campaign for the Rave Green. The Mercer Island native has posted 11 goals and one assist this season, including a historic four-goal outburst against Sporting Kansas City. Morris also became just the third Homegrown Player in league history to score 50 career MLS Regular Season play.\nNow in his 10th season with the club, Frei is having a career year with the Rave Green. The Seattle shot stopper has already notched 13 shutouts with one game remaining, which is the highest tally for any MLS goalkeeper in 2023.\nAllstate MLS Goalkeeper of the Year: Stefan Frei\nIn addition to leading all MLS goalkeepers in clean sheets, Frei has recorded 72 saves and has anchored a Sounder side that has the second best defensive record in the league. Frei is also fourth in MLS for expected goals minus goals conceded – a popular statistic for showing shot stopping value – for goalkeepers with at least 3,000 minutes. A shutout against St. Louis CITY SC on Decision Day would see Frei break the club’s single-season record, which he set back in 2017.\nMLS Defender of the Year: Yeimar, Nouhou\nSpeaking of the team’s elite defense, Yeimar is having one of his best campaigns in Rave Green. The commanding Colombian center back leads all MLS players in interceptions with 72, which is 14 more than the next player on the list. He is also sixth in tackles won among center backs.\nOne of the premier lockdown 1-v-1 defenders in the league, Nouhou is having another impressive campaign at left back. The Cameroonian international is sixth in the league for tackles won (42) among outside backs, and has also recorded 20 interceptions despite making just 23 starts this season.\nMLS Comeback Player of the Year: João Paulo\nAn MVP finalist in 2021, João Paulo picked up right where he left off the following season as the Sounders reached the Concacaf Champions League Final. Unfortunately, a torn ACL suffered during the second leg at Lumen Field on May 4 meant the Brazilian midfield general would miss the remainder of the 2022 season. João Paulo has been back to his pre-injury best this year, with 38 tackles won, 47 interceptions, five assists, and 26 key passes – re-establishing himself as one of the premier two-way midfielders in MLS.\nMLS Young Player of the Year: Obed Vargas, Josh Atencio\nNow in his second full season as a First Team player, Vargas has quietly amassed some impressive achievements in central midfield. The 18-year-old Alaska native has racked up 21 appearances, including 14 starts, to go along with his 22 tackles won, 17 interceptions and two assists.\nAtencio, 21, has become a significant contributor in the Sounders midfield this year. After recording his first MLS goal with a Goal of the Matchday against St. Louis back in April, the Sounders Academy alum has been a consistent presence in the team during its current eight-match unbeaten run. Atencio has also picked up 27 tackles won, 15 interceptions, and an assist.\nAudi Drives Progress Impact Award presented by MLS WORKS: Stefan Frei\nStefan Frei is a player ambassador to RAVE Foundation’s GOALS for Art program and consistently works in support of Sounders FC and RAVE Foundation’s work to Defend the Right to Play and support youth from underserved communities. Frei leverages his platform and art skills to help foster social-emotional wellness and belonging amongst youth while reaffirming their position as stakeholders in their communities. Frei regularly seeks out opportunities to grow RAVE’s impact by donating tickets to local professional and collegiate sporting events, such as Seattle Kraken hockey and University of Washington football games, for underserved youth to attend. As an artist and proud Seattle community member, Frei has donated original works of art to community nonprofits for fundraising and has collaborated with community youth to create an art installation that now adorns the two recently opened mini-pitches in Seattle’s NewHolly community.\nSigi Schmid MLS Coach of the Year: Brian Schmetzer\nDespite a raft of injuries and absences to key players throughout the season, Head Coach Brian Schmetzer’s side enters Decision Day this weekend with a strong opportunity to finish second in the Western Conference. The Sounders have been an elite defensive side all year long and weathered a difficult run of form over the summer to bounce back and build momentum heading into the postseason.",
