Around the end of March to April, there will be conversations between Tonali’s camp and Newcastle about the future.\n“Let’s see how Newcastle react, but there is a possibility Tonali considers a new chapter for his career in summer 2026.\n“There is interest from Italy, Juventus dream of Tonali but this could be very expensive, so complicated.\n“Then there are Premier League clubs. Arsenal interested, for sure. Manchester United, many have asked me about the links and there is an appreciation of Tonali by Man Utd, but he’s not the only midfielder on their list.\n“What I’m hearing is Man Utd have several names and in order to decide who is going to be the player they sign – and it could be two midfielders in the summer, because Casemiro is going, [Manuel Ugarte let’s see what happens – in that case, Man Utd wait to see first if they’ll play Champions League football, and second, who’s going to be the manager.\n“So before Man Utd decide which midfielder they want, we have to wait. With Amorim the name was Carlos Baleba. That was the top target.\n“Now Amorim is gone and so let’s see what happens with Carrick or any other manager Man Utd appoint in the summer.\n“Internally, Tonali is appreciated, but it’s not clear yet who is going to be the top target.”\nDON’T MISS: Three ways Carrick has made Amorim look foolish as painful double Man Utd sale can now be averted\nWorst Man Utd move EVER\nA heavily rumoured Manchester United transfer throughout the season would be quite literally the WORST move the Red Devils could make, according to a report.\nAs the majority of talk around the summer continues to focus on who United could bring in, United have been warned of an exit that would have a devastating effect on the club.\nBruno Fernandes made headlines earlier this season when revealing in a bombshell interview to Portuguese media that Man Utd tried to sell the player to Saudi Arabia last summer.\nAnd, while the 31-year-old refused to leave, Fabrizio Romano has gone on record to state Bruno leaving in the summer and after the World Cup is a distinct possibility.\nShould that happen, The Daily Mail has gone on record to label it as a blunder of epic proportions.\nTheir reporter, Nathan Salt, explained: “To be blunt, selling Fernandes would not just be professional malpractice, it would be the worst decision INEOS have ever made since walking through the doors at United. It simply cannot be allowed to happen under any circumstance.\n“United sources made the noises you would expect after that blockbuster Fernandes interview, which had been filmed in November. We have no interest in selling him, they said. He’s a big part of our future, they added.\n“Par for the course but the repercussions of Fernandes’ words are still lingering as the club hurtle towards another summer where his future will again be front and centre of the agenda.\n‘Who wanted him gone? Jason Wilcox or Omar Berrada? Sir Jim Ratcliffe? And why? Who in their right mind felt comfortable enough to wave goodbye to not just the captain but also the best midfielder in the Premier League?…”\nGet the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.\nMore Man Utd news: Stunning Vinicius swoop; scouts on Norwegian mission\nFormer United striker Louis Saha believes that his old club will be able to attract ‘big names’ like Real Madrid superstar Vinicius Junior, if they continue on their current path under Michael Carrick.\nElsewhere, director of football Jason Wilcox has reportedly tasked club scouts with keeping tabs on a teenage defender absolutely burning opposing strikers apart in the Norwegian Eliteserien.",
