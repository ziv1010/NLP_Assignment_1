I love this club, but I can't guarantee anything. Nobody can.\n\"I could say I'm going to stay here for years and then get fired.\"\nAbout having contact with Chelsea, he said: \"There are discussions because we're part of the same group.\"\nBBC Sport takes a look at his career to date.\nRosenior leading contender for Chelsea job\n- Published1 January\nRosenior's youthful Strasbourg team\nOne of Rosenior's most striking achievements with Strasbourg has been guiding them into the top reaches of Ligue 1 while fielding a team of youngsters, something which would stand him in good stead with Chelsea.\nThe average age of the Blues' line-up in the Premier League last season was 24 years and 36 days, the lowest of any team across a Premier League campaign.\nTheir oldest player is Tosin Adarabioyo, 28, and earlier this season they became the first team to have three teenagers on the scoresheet in a Champions League game.\nMeanwhile, in August Strasbourg became the first club in Europe's top five leagues to play a team of players all born in the 2000s - and had an average age of 20 years and 283 days for a Ligue 1 game against Monaco. The oldest player was 22.\nFormer England left-back Ben Chilwell, who joined Strasbourg from Chelsea in the summer, spoke to BBC Sport's Nizaar Kinsella in November about Rosenior's leadership style.\n\"The manager is very good at managing a young dressing room,\" he said. \"It's not necessarily an immature dressing room but a young dressing room that doesn't have the experience of knowing what it takes yet to win stuff.\n\"The manager wants to win stuff this season, wants us to qualify for the Champions League, wants us to win the French Cup, wants us to win the Conference League.\"\nStrasbourg finished seventh last season, and sit in the same position again after 16 games of this campaign.\nThey finished top of this season's Conference League group with five wins and a draw - including victories over Crystal Palace and Aberdeen.\nBut Rosenior, who has already managed Chelsea's Liam Delap at Hull City and Andrey Santos at Strasbourg last season, could now swap the Conference League for the Champions League.\nFlexible tactically and plenty of passes - Rosenior at Strasbourg\nStrasbourg's Ligue 1 form has dipped in recent months though, with only one win in the past six Ligue 1 games.\nIn the middle of October they were in third place, just one point off leaders Paris St-Germain, but they are now 14 points behind current leaders Lens.\nRosenior has not been wedded to a shape, playing in both a 4-2-3-1 and a 3-4-3 formation.\nThey play a passing style, with the third highest number of passes in Ligue 1 this season - but they are only eighth for passes in the opposition half.\nTheir 55 through balls are more than anyone else in Ligue 1 - by a huge distance - while they rank at the bottom for long passes, again by some way.\nIn fact Strasbourg have played fewer long passes than any other team in Europe's top five leagues - 511. The team next on the list, Barcelona, have hit 598 long balls.\nChelsea, by contrast, have played 925 long passes in the league.\nStrasbourg have been clinical too, ranking 14th for shots in Ligue 1 but seventh for goals.\nIn November club president Marc Keller - who denied Strasbourg are Chelsea's feeder club - told the BBC: \"Liam is very innovative.\n\"He is playing top football and we are playing with a young team, so they have space to play.\n\"BlueCo knew him from England and when I met him he was clear about what he wanted to set up in Strasbourg - and what he said is exactly what is happening now.\"\nRosenior built his reputation in the EFL\nRosenior, a right-back, had a solid but unspectacular career as a player - featuring in the top flight for Fulham, Reading, Hull and Brighton.\nRoughly half his career was spent in the EFL and that's where he started his coaching career.\nAfter a spell as Brighton's under-23s coach, he spent three years at Derby.\nHe was first-team coach under Phillip Cocu and then assistant boss to Wayne Rooney - before taking over as interim boss after Rooney's departure.\nBut he was more hands-on than the average assistant.\n\"There was an argument when Mel Morris sacked Phillip Cocu in November 2020, Rosenior should have been put in charge, not Rooney,\" said BBC football news reporter Simon Stone.\n\"Rooney had the profile of course, but it was Rosenior who put the sessions on at Derby and who guided the team during games.\n\"Rosenior replaced Rooney for a short time in 2022, after administration had led to relegation into League One.\n\"It was Rosenior who put Derby back together, helping to bring in 14 new players after the club had been left with only five under contract.\n\"History suggests the new ownership would have been better leaving Rosenior in charge, given they were seventh when he left and under his replacement, Paul Warne, they didn't even end with a play-off place.\"\nHe then spent almost two years as Hull manager - with observers again thinking he was harshly done by at the end.\nThe Tigers were one point above the relegation zone when he took over in November 2022 and led them to 15th.\nThe following season they finished three points off the play-off places, and Rosenior was sacked.\nIn 2024-25 while Rosenior was leading Strasbourg into Europe, Hull City avoided relegation from the Championship on goal difference.\n'You need a puppet'\nMany of Chelsea's managers under BlueCo have had big personalities and fallen out with the ownership.\nThey include Thomas Tuchel, who had won the Champions League, and Maresca, who lifted the Club World Cup in the summer.\nMauricio Pochettino left the club 18 months ago despite having appeared to stabilise the team in the latter stages of that season.\nWould Chelsea be looking to the manager sitting seventh in the French league if they were not already part of their ownership group?\nBBC pundit Nevin said: \"Chelsea need someone who is going to buy into the methodology. Another way to say that is, you need a puppet. Someone who does exactly what they are told from above.\n\"Chelsea want success. But they want something else. They want someone who will do what they tell them to do. Those two things may not be compatible.\n\"Liam Rosenior sounds like a really good idea, but he's never done it at this level. To bring someone in who doesn't have that level of experience is a massive, massive chance to take.\"\nRosenior does have more managerial experience than his predecessor Maresca, who had a short spell at Parma in 2021 and one season as Leicester boss before taking over at Chelsea in 2024.\nFormer Manchester United striker Dion Dublin said \"Rosenior is doing brilliant at Strasbourg\".\nBut he added: \"Chelsea had a manager who I don't think is going to be matched unless they spend a lot of money at it, to get a top-class manager in, and I don't think that is going to happen.\n\"It sounds like the owners want to control the manager and everything that goes on and what happens beyond the white line.\"",
