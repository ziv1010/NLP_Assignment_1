It’s as simple as that.\n“After that, we’re going to play (Manchester) United and (in the) Champions League and Arsenal. After that everything will be more clear and we’ll take decisions. It depends on the performance and it depends on many reasons.\n“It’s not just the keepers, (it’s) all the players.”\nTrafford, a City academy graduate, rejoined the club in a £27million (€31 million) deal in July after impressing at Burnley.\nGuardiola is confident the player will bounce back from his nervy home debut against Spurs.\nHe said: “We take care of them. Of course he was concerned – I would not like it if he was not concerned, but of course we are here to help them, no doubt about that. We’re here to support in the bad moments.”\nAsked on Friday if he had decided who will play at Brighton, Guardiola said: “Tomorrow – because I don’t have a press conference.”\nBoth of City’s other frontline keepers, Ederson and Stefan Ortega, are in the final years of their contracts and have been linked with moves away before Monday’s deadline.\nGuardiola refused to be drawn on any possible departures, even though he has regularly said his squad is too big for his liking.\nA post shared by Ederson Moraes (@ederson93)\nHe said: “We have a long squad and all the players have maybe signings (elsewhere) – maybe. People leave. It’s what it is. The transfer (window) is in that way. You have to accept it.”\nGuardiola insisted he was happy for midfielder Rodri to link up with the Spain national team next week despite his limited start to the season.\nThe Ballon d’Or winner, who missed most of the last campaign through injury, suffered a setback prior to the opening game and has so far played just 15 minutes this term.\nGuardiola said: “He feels better and needs minutes. I think they talk to each other and they decided to select him. I never say when a player is fit, always I support them to go to the national team.”",
