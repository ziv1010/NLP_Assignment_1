We have had many months to arrive at this part of the league to have the chance in our hands.\n\"Of course, they have it in their hands too, because if they win it depends on them. The destiny will be in their hands.\n\"But if we win, definitely the destiny will be in our hands.\"\nArteta, who worked for three-and-a-half years as Guardiola's assistant at City, denied the top-of-the-table clash will be decisive in the title race.\nGuardiola agreed with his protege, but did not play down the importance of landing a major blow to City's title rivals.\n\"It's a really, really important game because we can get points and our biggest opponent this season cannot,\" said Guardiola.\n\"It's really important, not decisive because there's still many tough games for both sides. We have more games to play but we can't deny how important it is.\"\nThe two Arsenal players with Premier League title-winning experience collected their medals at City.\nOleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus return to the Etihad having played a major role in Arsenal's rise from finishing fifth last season into title contenders.\nBut Guardiola insisted there is no regret at having let the pair go.\n\"Everyone agreed. The players wanted to leave, the club wanted to sell and the club wanted to buy.\n\"It's more than just one person. They were happy and we're happy. We have no regrets.\"\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
