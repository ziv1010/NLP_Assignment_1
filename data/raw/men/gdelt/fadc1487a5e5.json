  "body_text": "Mikel Arteta faced the media after our 2-2 Premier League draw with Crystal Palace.\nThe boss was asked about the performance, Leandro Trossard's form and looking ahead to PSG in the Champions League.\nHere’s a full transcript from the post-match press conference…\non the result:\nI'm disappointed with the result and the performance as well. I think we never got the consistency in many areas to completely dominate the game - we always had the feeling that we had the ball, we had possession, we went in front twice, but the game wasn't grabbed, it wasn't dominated and controlled the way that we normally do because we were below the standards in some areas. When you are not at your best, but you are two times ahead, you have to be able to see the game off and we weren't able to do it, especially with what happened in the second half.\non if the PSG game was on the players’ minds:\nHopefully not, but we discussed that before Ipswich, and it wasn't there. Today we still had six days to prepare that match, and I don't want to use that. Obviously, we have missed a lot of players, a lot of players that haven't trained at all, they weren't able to do it today so we were very short. Credit to Palace, they are very well organised, they are a really good side, they made it difficult for us and everyone else, but today we weren’t at our best.\non the reason behind the amount of draws we’ve had:\nWe haven't been able to see the games off for many reasons, and the margins have been too small. Sometimes that, sometimes credit to the opposition, it's true that we played five times with ten men. There are a lot of factors, but obviously it's something that we've done much better in the past, especially when we've been ahead in games. Today, without really much happening, especially in the second half, we have to be able to see the game off.\non Gabriel Martinelli’s disallowed goal:\nIt took a long time, but I haven't seen the replay yet, so I don't know exactly why the decision was made.\non not drawing as many games next season:\nYeah, or lose - I mean you have to win a certain amount of games and then a certain amount of points. We have only lost three games, two of them with 10 men, so we have to win many more.\non looking behind rather than in front:\nWe're always looking because we know how tough it is to win football matches in the Premier League, and especially with the amount of numbers and the amount of games that we have, we're going to have to be really good in both competitions to earn the right where we want to end up.\non whether finishing second means a lot to the boss:\nWe'll see where we finish, we have to do everything that we can, game by game.\non Mikel Merino and Ben White’s absences:\nWe have to wait and see, but they were unable to be in the squad today.\non Leandro Trossard’s form:\nVery good, I think he's been a very consistent player for us, whether playing as a nine, as a winger, starting or being a sub, and that's what you want from players. He's always ready, he's always fit, and he can make the difference in any moment, that's the best thing about it.\non how we might set up against PSG:\nWithout understanding who is available, at the moment, it's very difficult.\non Thomas Partey’s future:\nI already gave an update the other day, and I think it's not for me to give any more information on that.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
