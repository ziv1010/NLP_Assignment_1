  "body_text": "The inaugural Club World Cup starts in the United States on June 14, with its 32 teams split into eight groups of four in the opening phase.\nAs part of our guides to the sides that will feature in the tournament, James Horncastle gives you the background on River Plate.\nFollow the Club World Cup on The Athletic this summer…\n- Club World Cup team guides, news and analysis\n- How will the tournament work?\n- Could it stretch Lionel Messi and other stars to breaking point?\nWho are they?\nEl Mas Grande (‘the greatest’), this club from Buenos Aires need little introduction. The 38-time Argentine league champions also boast one of the most talked-about young stars in South American football (more on Franco Mastantuono later).\nHow good are they?\nRiver should be very good after spending more than €50million (£42.2m; $57m) in the transfer window. That’s a huge amount for Argentine football. The funds were raised by selling players to Russian teams, as Spartak Moscow and CSKA Moscow signed a trio of River old boys.\nAdvertisement\nIt took a while for head coach Marcelo Gallardo to integrate all the acquisitions — River essentially bought a new team — but German Pezzella, Lucas Martinez Quarta and Sebastian Driussi were all returning, too, after leaving clubs in Europe.\nGallardo’s latest vintage finished strongly in the first half of the season (the Apertura), and rather satisfyingly threw Boca into crisis by beating them in the ‘Superclasico’ — a defeat that cost rival coach Fernando Gago his job. Unexpectedly, River then lost on penalties in the play-offs to Platense, who shocked everyone and won a top league title for the first time in their history.\nHow did they get here?\nUnlike the Brazilian teams who qualified as recent winners of the Copa Libertadores, South America’s Champions League equivalent, River booked their place based on their ranking over the last four years in continental competitions.\nThey were the top-ranked eligible CONMEBOL (South American) team and sealed their place by beating Libertad 2-0 in last season’s Copa Libertadores group stages with a brace from Miguel Borja, their experienced Colombian striker.\nWhat’s their style of play?\nRiver have a tradition of playing slick football going back to La Maquina, the legendary side of the late ’30s and early ’40s, which nudged South American football forward.\nRenato Cesarini and Carlos Peucelle, the most consequential coaches in River’s history until Gallardo, used to say: “What’s the ball made of? Leather. And where does leather come from? Cows. And what do cows eat? Grass.” The ball has to eat grass. In other words, it has to move.\nGallardo knows this better than anyone, but he is also a pragmatist who has always adapted his system to the players available and the opponent River are facing.\nTell us about the coach\nGallardo is only 49 and yet there is a towering bronze statue of him outside River’s Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires. It shows him holding aloft the Copa Libertadores, a trophy he won as a player with River Plate in 1996 and then as a coach in 2015 and 2018.\nAdvertisement\nKnown as the Muneco (‘doll’), the baby-faced Gallardo is the most successful manager in River’s illustrious history. This is his second spell as manager after Al Ittihad briefly lured him away to work in the Saudi Pro League. The statue that River unveiled of him raised eyebrows because it seemed Gallardo had stuffed another Libertadores trophy in his trouser pocket.\nWho is their star player?\n“Alisson? No! Franco Armani.” He is 38 and, let’s be honest, isn’t as good as Alisson in goal. But River’s veteran goalkeeper has been caught up in too many legendary moments to count.\nHe won his first Libertadores with Atletico Nacional in Colombia, married a Colombian and could have played for Colombia. Then Armani returned to Argentina, played another couple of Libertadores finals, winning one with River. He was a member of Argentina’s World Cup-winning squad in Qatar in 2022 and helped advise Emiliano Martinez in the shootouts that decided the quarter-final and final.\nDaniele Adani, the former Inter centre-back turned pundit, who became a River fan because of his former team-mate Matias Almeyda, once said: “Armani isn’t the best goalkeeper in football, he’s the best in humanity.” This is all an exaggeration.\nAnd their rising star?\nRiver continue to have arguably the best academy in Argentina and their latest graduate is the most talked about talent in South America. Franco Mastantuono made his debut for the national team in early June. He does not turn 18 until August yet his appearance for Argentina somehow felt overdue.\nA playmaker who operates from the right, Mastantuono finished the first half of the season in remarkable form, scoring and assisting seven times in his last nine club appearances in all competitions. The crowning moment was his incredible Superclasico-winning free kick against Boca in April, which flicked the hype machine into overdrive.\nAdvertisement\nWhat is their best chant?\nThere are so many to choose from. One is about a tarot card reader who tells a River fan to give up smoking weed and the booze, otherwise they’ll go to the grave. She throws her cards and decrees River will be champions, their rivals in the mud, and frankly, that’s all that matters.\nWho are their biggest rivals back home?\nThat would be Boca Juniors. It is South America’s fiercest rivalry.\nBoth clubs were founded in the same working-class neighbourhood, known as the mouth of Buenos Aires. Boca took its name and stayed. River moved around instead. They were social climbers, pitching up in Caballito, Palermo and Recoleta before settling down in well-to-do Nunez. This led River to be nicknamed the Millionaires.\nTheir stadium, the Monumental, has a capacity of over 85,000, significantly larger than Boca’s Bombonera, which holds 57,200. One of the huge stands of the Monumental was bankrolled by the transformational transfer fee Juventus paid for forward Omar Sivori in 1957.\nThere are a couple of recent animating elements to this rivalry. Boca, for instance, revelled in River’s relegation in 2011. River then got their own back by beating Boca in the 2018 Libertadores final.\nTell us something weird about the club?\nBoca’s stadium is known as the ‘chocolate box’. It is a bowl-shaped stadium except for one stand, which is square. The lore says that the houses behind that stand are owned by generations of River fans who refuse to sell up, stopping Boca from completing the curved look of the Estadio Alberto J Armando, known more colloquially as La Bombonera.\nWhy should a neutral fan root for them?\nBecause River are El Mas Grande. The greatest.\nWho are they playing?\n(All kick-offs ET/BST)\n- June 17 — Urawa Red Diamonds, 3pm/8pm\n- June 21 — CF Monterrey, 9pm/2am June 22\n- June 25 — Inter Milan, 9pm/2am June 26\n(Top photos: Rodrigo Valle/ Eurasia Sport Image/Getty; design: Kelsea Petersen/The Athletic)",
