Fabrizio Romano reported additions could come at right-back and centre-half, though the bulk of business will be conducted in midfield.\nIndeed, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are both leaving as free agents. James Milner may well join the pair with the vice-captain no closer to extending his stay. Milner’s current deal expires at season’s end.\nArthur Melo’s loan will conclude and the option to buy will not be triggered. As such, Romano claimed “at least two” and more probably three new midfielders will arrive.\nIn the aftermath of Liverpool pulling out of the race to sign Jude Bellingham, links to all manner of midfielders have arisen.\nFocussing just on the Premier League, Conor Gallagher, Mason Mount, Matheus Nunes, Joao Palhinha, Youri Tielemans, Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister are all understood to be on Liverpool’s radar.\nBut according to Goal reporter Neil Jones, Aston Villa’s Jacob Ramsey has been added to the shortlist.\nAston Villa to make life difficult for Liverpool\nThe 21-year-old can operate in a variety of midfield roles and has added end product to his game in recent weeks. Indeed, his two goals and three assists have played a big part in helping Villa win five on the spin.\nHowever, it’s also alerted Liverpool, with Jones naming Ramsey as a Reds target when listing the many players they’re chasing.\nLittle else on the future of Ramsey was given away in the report. However, HITC suggest Liverpool won’t find the going easy if they act on their interest.\nThe online outlet report ‘Villa won’t encourage any offers for their homegrown midfielder and it’s hard to see him leaving Villa Park any time soon’.\nNo valuation for Ramsey was cited in either piece. However, given Ramsey looks destined to be an England international, it stands to reason a deal won’t come cheap.\nIndeed, former Villa boss and Reds legend, Steven Gerrard, previously suggested Ramsey is already playing at international level.\nGerrard, Carragher wowed by Jacob Ramsey\n“I know the level of the England players,” said Gerrard a year last February (via the Liverpool Echo).\n“I’ve been around it, and have enough experience to know it’s only a matter of time, but let’s all be sensible and keep calm about it.\n“I want him to make his own headlines with his football. He is a top talent, I’m loving every moment of working with him.\n“He is getting stronger with each game because we’re giving him the platform to express himself. He is in a wonderful place.”\nFellow Liverpool great, Jamie Carragher, has also tipped Ramsey to among the leading players in the world over the coming years.\n“I love him,” said Carragher after Ramsey scored the winner against Southampton in September. “He’s a super player,”\n“He doesn’t look like a young kid playing in a man’s game. I spoke to Gary McAllister [former Villa assistant manager] before the game, I said to him: ‘How good is Ramsey?’ And he said he can go right to the top.\n“We’re talking about international honours and playing in the Champions League. I think he can certainly play at that level in the next couple of years.”\nLIVERPOOL TRANSFERS: Fabrizio Romano claims ‘perfect signing’ is taking shape as Klopp pushes for five game-changing arrivals",
