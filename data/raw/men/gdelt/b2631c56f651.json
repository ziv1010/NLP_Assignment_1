He was also called up to the Barca squad for the Champions League semi-final second leg against Inter last season but is yet to make his first-team debut.\nThe teenager will be hoping that a first senior appearance isn’t too far away, and Barca’s decision to hand out an extension certainly shows they have plenty of faith in the youngster.",
