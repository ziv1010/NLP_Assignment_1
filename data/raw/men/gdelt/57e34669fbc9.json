Nani, who had arrived at the club in 2007, was seen as the heir apparent for his compatriot. Did he feel pressure to fill Ronaldo’s boots?\n“No,” he insists. “Pressure, when you understand it properly, becomes responsibility. I was confident I could be a player capable of helping to compensate for Cristiano’s absence.\n“I think that belief, together with the commitment I showed, was what allowed me to have such strong seasons at United. Unfortunately, some injuries limited my performances, but overall I consider my time at the club to have been very good.\n“The trust of my team-mates and the coaching staff was also key in making the post-Cristiano era a positive one.”\nFor more than a decade, Joe Mewis has worked in football journalism as a reporter and editor.
