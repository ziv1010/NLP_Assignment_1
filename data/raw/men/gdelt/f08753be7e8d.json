limbo as their contracts with their current clubs expire June 30.\nThis has resulted in an air of uncertainty shrouding the futures of these players despite their talent and reputation.\nIt can be unsettling for top players when their contracts run down and make them clubless.\nMany factors can lead to this, including financial terms, playing time and even the overall vision of the club can complicate negotiations and become stumbling blocks to an agreement.\nDAILY POST takes a look at five of such superstars.\nSergio Ramos\nThe former Spanish national team captain has already confirmed that Paris Saint-Germain’s final game of the season against Clermont Foot was his last for the Ligue 1 champions.\nRamos tweeted: “Tomorrow is a special day, tomorrow I will say goodbye to another stage of my life.”\nHowever, he is widely still regarded as one of the best defenders football has ever produced and is now waiting for a new club to call.\nThe 37-year-old could find another top club (playing in the Champions League) or link up with his former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo in Saudi Pro League or Lionel Messi in the MLS.\nFootball transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano has reported that clubs in Saudi Arabia have approached Ramos for a permanent transfer.\nSaudi League is quickly becoming a hotbed for players with the likes of Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, N’Golo Kante, Kalidou Koulibaly and several players already moving there.\nDavid de Gea\nIt is now very clear that David De Gea will be leaving Old Trafford after 12 years.\nDe Gea remains one of the best goalkeepers in the game, no matter what the critics say.\nThe Spaniard won the Premier League Golden Glove for last season ahead of Nick Pope, Alisson Becker and Aaron Ramsdale.\nSome of his saves were crucial as Erik ten Hag’s side finished third in the Premier League table and booked a spot in next season’s Champions League.\nHowever, De Gea does not suit Ten Hag’s style of football and despite the manager insisting the Spaniard has a future with the Red Devils, the club is in the market for a new shot-stopper.\nDe Gea had signed a new Manchester United deal, only for the club to withdraw their offer after failing to sign off their side of the paperwork\nUnited consequently submitted a new proposal to De Gea on reduced terms.\nThe goalkeeper, who is understandably annoyed, is yet to agree to the new proposal.\nHe currently has eye-watering offers on the table from clubs in Saudi Arabia.\nBut it is understood that the United goalie wants to remain in Europe to compete at the highest level.\nManchester United have only a few days to reach a resolution with De Gea over a new contract, before he becomes a free agent.\nAndre Onana, the Inter Milan goalkeeper, has emerged as their first choice to replace De Gea.\nRoberto Firmino\nYou would not be wrong to call Roberto Firmino an Anfield legend.\nThe Brazilian, who moved to Liverpool from TSG 1899 Hoffenheim in 2015, has been one of the Reds’ top performers under Jurgen Klopp.\nFirmino, who can be deployed as a striker or an attacking midfielder, has already been given a fond farewell by the fans at the end of the 2022-23 season.\nHe made 362 appearances across all competitions for Liverpool, scoring 111 goals and providing 79 assists.\nDuring this period, the former Bundesliga star lifted one Champions League title, one Premier League title, one FIFA Club World Cup, one FA Cup and one Carabao Cup\nFirmino could also be heading to the Saudi Pro League.\nHe is currently in talks with Saudi Pro League side Al-Ahli.\nAdama Traore\nTraore’s contract at Wolverhampton Wanderers also expires June 30.\nThe Spain international had a loan spell at Barcelona in 2022 and returned to the UK afterwards.\nTraore played 32 games for Wolves for last season, scoring just two goals and making one assist and the Premier League side is reluctant to retain him for next.\nThe club’s director, Matt Hobbs, told their official website that there is still the opportunity to come to agreement with the winger over a new deal, saying that conversations will be ongoing.\nHe added that “He’s probably earned the right to understand what else is out there.”\nThe forward will become one of the most sought-after free agents this summer if Wolves decide to let him go.\nHe may end up in one of the Premier League sides in Europe next season, while AS Roma and AC Milan are also showing keen interest, according to Gianluca Di Marzio of Sky Sport.\nManchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City are reportedly in the race to sign the Wolves winger and Bayern Munich are also interested\nLucas Moura\nAS Roma, Lazio and Olympique de Marseille have begun talks to sign Moura.\nBut he could end up staying in the Premier League with Aston Villa, Newcastle United or Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nHowever, Moura would like to join a club in a European competition next season, giving Newcastle and Aston Villa an advantage.\nMoura has had his fair share of memorable moments at Tottenham, but has not had the kind of impact he was expected to when he initially joined the club in 2018.\nThe Brazilian bid goodbye to Spurs’ away support on the last day of the season at Elland Road, Leeds United, with a goal in that game and is currently on the lookout for a new club.\nHe made 221 appearances across all competitions for Spurs, scoring 39 goals and providing 27 assists.\nMoura, who joined Spurs in 2018, is currently a free agent and is on the lookout for a new club.",
