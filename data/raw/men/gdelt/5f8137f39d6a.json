The 23-year-old is open to joining Liverpool despite the fact he’ll not dislodge Alisson Becker as the regular starter until 2025, 2026 or perhaps even further into the future.\nLiverpool’s plan is to sign Mamardashvili, though the Georgian won’t officially become a Liverpool player until 2025.\nMamardashvili will be loaned from Valencia to Bournemouth for the 2024/25 campaign to gain Premier League experience.\nHe’ll then join Liverpool next summer at which point the Reds will have a major decision to make between Alisson and Mamardashvili.\nValencia hope to collect €40m from the sale of their world class goalkeeper. Reports in Spain state Liverpool have already seen one bid rejected.\nLiverpool to submit decisive Mamardashvili bid; Wolves deal next\nBut per a fresh update from AS, Liverpool will now thunder in with a ‘final’ and decisive offer much closer to Valencia’s asking price.\nThe expectation is that when the bid is received, it will be accepted.\nElsewhere, links between Liverpool and Wolves left-back, Rayan Ait-Nouri, have re-emerged.\nTEAMtalk sources have subsequently been able to confirm the Algeria international, 23, is a wanted man at Anfield.\nLiverpool’s interest stems from the fact Andy Robertson is now the wrong side of 30 and the club must begin planning for the future sooner rather than later.\nIf signed, Ait-Nouri would battle with Robertson for the starting role before going on to succeed the Scot as the regular starter further down the line.\nTEAMtalk can confirm Liverpool’s interest in Ait-Nouri is concrete and positive talks with the player’s camp have been held.\nReports elsewhere have stated Wolves would look to collect £40m before greenlighting a sale.\nPSG HINT ON UGARTE TO MAN UTD\nMan Utd’s move for Manuel Ugarte is “absolutely on” and PSG have dropped a huge clue a transfer is ready to be made by excluding the midfielder from their Ligue 1 opener with Le Havre tonight.
