So serious that, in my view, it is one of the most serious cases in football since I have been involved in it,” Ceferin told the Slovenian daily Ekipa on Monday.\nPrior to Ceferin’s re-election, UEFA will hold an executive committee meeting in Lisbon on Tuesday in which it will name the hosts for the 2025 Women’s Euro.\nA joint Scandinavian bid from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden goes up against bids from France, Poland and Switzerland.\nBelarus will also be on the agenda, with the country in danger of being excluded from UEFA competitions due to its support of Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.\nRussia was expelled from all club and international competitions by UEFA last year following the invasion, but Belarus is involved in the qualifiers for Euro 2024, which it began with defeats against Switzerland and Romania last month.\nIn mid-March, more than a hundred EU lawmakers called on UEFA to expel Belarus too. – AFP",
