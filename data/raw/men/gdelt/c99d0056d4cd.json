  "body_text": "Myles Lewis-Skelly found the back of the net as England beat the Netherlands 4-1 to record back-to-back wins at the U17 European Championship, and reach the knockout stages.\nOur midfielder took just seven minutes to make his mark on the encounter. Picking the ball up on the halfway line, he changed forward into the box, beating three Dutch defenders before linking up with Leon Chiwome and tucking the ball home. That was Myles’ second goal for his country at under-17 level, and his first since October.\nPutting our #YoungLions ahead against the Netherlands 💫\n— England (@England) May 22, 2023\nThe highlights from yesterday's 4-1 win at #U17EURO:\nIn the second half, he nearly repeated the trick with another great burst from midfield but just missed the target, but after the Oranje pulled level through Jasper Hartog, a brace from substitute Isaiah Dada-Mascoll and a late goal from Justin Oboavwoduo saw the Young Lions cruise to victory.\nThey will now face Switzerland on Wednesday, with both sides already having booked their spots in the last 16 with a game to spare.\nBoth Myles and Ethan Nwaneri played 72 minutes of the contest in Debrecen, Hungary, after the latter bagged the only goal of the game to beat Croatia in their opening group game.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
