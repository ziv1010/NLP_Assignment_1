They take on Real Sociedad in legs home and away over the next two weeks.\nOff-the-field, the club has also endured a tumultuous campaign with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS overseeing a swathe of redundancies.\nThe decision to part ways with sporting Dan Ashworth just months after his arrival in Manchester also served to underline the chaos at Old Trafford.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

The academy wasn’t delivering the players that they were before.’\nMore Trending\nLiverpool are cruising towards Premier League title glory in their first season under Slot, 13 points clear with 10 games of their season remaining.\nUnited finished seventh in their first season after Ferguson’s retirement, costing David Moyes his job.\nSince then, they have failed to truly mount a Premier League title challenge, twice finishing second under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2017/18 and 2020/21 respectively.\nOn both occasions, they finished some way off champions Manchester City who have won seven titles since United’s last triumph.\nMORE: Wayne Rooney names ‘fantastic’ striker who ‘should be playing at Man Utd’\nMORE: ‘Real handful’ – Alan Shearer praises Man Utd star despite FA Cup exit\nMORE: FA Cup quarter-final draw: Man City and Aston Villa learn fate as Man Utd knocked out",
