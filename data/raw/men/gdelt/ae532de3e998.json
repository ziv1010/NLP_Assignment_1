  "body_text": "Former Manchester United midfielder Donny van de Beek has spoken out on his challenging time at the English club.\nThe Dutchman signed for the Red Devils in the summer of 2020 and was one of the most sought-after talents in European football after some fine displays in the Champions League for Ajax.\nHis signing was seen as quite a coup at the time but sadly proved to be one of the club’s most disastrous.\nVan de Beek rarely achieved significant gametime under three different managers and struggled while on loan to Everton and Eintracht Frankfurt.\nThe 27 year old finally escaped his nightmare when he left for Girona this past summer.\nNonetheless, not even a fresh start has seemingly changed his career trajectory as he has been criticised for his performances for La Liga side.\nSpeaking at a pre-match press conference (via Sport Witness) ahead of Girona’s Champions League matchup against Feyenoord today he stated, “I don’t like to talk about the past. I’ve been getting fit and feeling good for a few weeks now. Now I feel in a good moment. I love playing against Feyenoord.”\nHe delved into his darker moments during his career but affirmed how important his family were in getting through these times.\n“There have been moments when I was about to give up everything, but the family helped me to continue believing in myself. They have convinced me that I have to do what I like and that fills me up, which is to play football.”\nThe midfielder was much more optimistic about his future however as he stated, “I have had many hard knocks in my career. Now I feel like I’m starting a new stage at a fantastic club. We play very well and it’s a big challenge for me. I want to keep improving.”\nWith both Oriol Romeu and Daley Blind expected to spend significant time on the treatment table, Van de Beek may finally get the chance to play extended minutes for the first time since his Ajax career.\nWith 58 minutes against Paris Saint-Germain and 76 against Celta Vigo in his last three games, he is certainly seems to be finally heading in the right direction.\nFeatured image Nigel Roddis via Getty Images",
