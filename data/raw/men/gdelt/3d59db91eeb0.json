  "body_text": "Pep Guardiola has given a worrying update on the fitness of Rodri ahead of Manchester City’s Premier League clash against Everton.\nFollowing the international break, City return to action on Saturday when they welcome the Toffees to the Etihad.\nVictory could send the home side to the top of the table but Everton will be fired up for the match and would even move ahead of the Citizens if they got the three points.\nGuardiola is grateful then to have several key players back from injury, namely forward Omar Marmoush and left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri, while midfielder Mateo Kovacic continues to build up his fitness.\n‘They trained yesterday and they are much, much better. They are close to comeback,’ the manager said in his pre-match press conference on Friday.\n‘Maybe 50-60 minutes [for Kovacic]. He needs quality moment, quality time and quality minutes. It’s important he is back step-by-step.’\nThere was less good news surrounding key player Rodri who is struggling with injury niggles after recovering from his ACL issue that ruled him out for eight months last season.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

He is not ready for tomorrow.\n‘I don’t know when he will be back.’\nMore Trending\nCity have a series of important games on the horizon, not least a clash against title rivals Liverpool on November 9.\nAfter a tricky start to the season, the Citizens are seven games unbeaten in all competitions and currently sit fifth in the Premier League, three points behind leaders Arsenal.\n“At the moment, I think I have the energy with my players to simply make a better season than last season. This is my target,’ Guardiola said.\n‘I am never sitting here at the start of November and December and going to say we are going to win this or that. I see things that we are doing much better than last season and in every game, we are a little bit better.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Nottingham Forest vs Chelsea: Latest team news, predicted lineups and injuries\nMORE: Mikel Arteta gives Martin Zubimendi update after Arsenal star misses training\nMORE: Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez injury update for Chelsea’s trip to Nottingham Forest",
