  "body_text": "Peter Schmeichel says he has sympathy for Andre Onana and it is ‘very wrong’ for the goalkeeper to be singled out given Manchester United’s struggles as a whole this season.\nOnana made a string of high-profile mistakes across an unconvincing debut season at Old Trafford and it has been a similar story for the 29-year-old shot-stopper this term.\nA pair of blunders in the first leg of the Red Devils’ Europa League quarter-final with Lyon convinced Ruben Amorim to drop Onana in favour of Altay Bayindir for the club’s trip to Newcastle in the Premier League.\nBayindir produced an embarrassing gaffe of his own to pave the path for Onana to return to Amorim’s starting XI for United’s last two games – and the Cameroon international is expected to continue his run in the side at Bournemouth this weekend.\nHowever, there remains uncertainty over Onana’s long-term future at the Theatre of Dreams and widespread reports suggest United are on the hunt for an upgrade this summer, with the likes of Aaron Ramsdale, Diogo Costa and Bart Verbruggen linked.\nSchmeichel has been reluctant to pour scorn on Onana throughout the ‘keeper’s inauspicious spell in the north west and even praised the former Inter Milan man for supposedly cutting errors out of his game at the start of the season.\nSpeaking to talkSPORT ahead of United’s clash with Bournemouth, Schmeichel encouraged fans and critics to instead look at the club’s wider issues before picking on Onana.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

The players are not having the greatest time.\n‘I try to explain this to people, why is it different playing for Manchester United as opposed to any other club?\n‘I showed this to my wife the other day. We have a broadsheet newspaper in Denmark that doesn’t have a sports section, but they still carry Manchester United’s results and not just a little line but in an article.\n‘If you’re any other club, or most other clubs, you don’t have that. You don’t have all the fringe, non-sporting papers reporting on your games and that is where the pressure is.\n‘Every single thing you do in a game of football will be reported everywhere in the world. For instance, as a goalkeeper, if you make a mistake, everybody in the world will be talking about that mistake.\n‘If you make a mistake for so many other clubs in the Premier League, they might just be in the newspaper the next day. But you’re not going to talk about it tomorrow or the day after.\n‘That is where the mental toughness of being a Manchester United player comes in.\n‘It’s been a difficult year, it’s been a difficult year for everyone, so singling out anyone, I think that would be very, very wrong.’\nSchmeichel believes it is absolutely imperative that United go all the way in the Europa League if they are to achieve their ambitions in the summer transfer market.\n‘There is still this chance that Manchester United could win the Europa League,’ the five-time Premier League winner added.\n‘If they win the Europa League, it’s a completely different situation the summer transfer window coming up.\n‘It will give an opportunity to sign better players because the club will be more attractive because of the Champions League.\n‘And, of course, they would be in a better financial situation so they can sign more players.\n‘This is where we’re pinning our hopes so let’s hope that happens and let’s hope the club moves in a more positive direction.’\nMarcus Rashford has enjoyed a return to form and is once again playing with a smile on his face having left United to join Aston Villa on loan in January.\nMore Trending\nThe England international hopes to be playing for a club playing Champions League football next season, but will not make a final decision on his future until June.\n‘I don’t want to comment on Marcus Rashford’s situation,’ Schmeichel said when asked if there was a way back for the forward at Old Trafford.\n‘I don’t think that’s for me to do that so let’s see what happens with that.\n‘I don’t have to an opinion about everything, Jim [White]! I’m not Simon [Jordan]!’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Premier League boss vows to help Athletic Bilbao beat Man Utd in Europa League\nMORE: Jurgen Klopp ‘super happy’ after Liverpool win Premier League under Arne Slot\nMORE: Arsenal star sends transfer message to Mikel Arteta after Liverpool win Premier League",
