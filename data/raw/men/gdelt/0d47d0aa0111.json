Merely after three rounds, some of the most decorated teams in the tournament are far from being in the comfort zone. Fifteen-time winner and reigning champion Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, AC Milan - all are tough to make their way into the elite group that occupies spots in the G-8 and clinches direct entry into the round of 16.\nFollow Playing for 90 on X (Twitter).\nThe new format has leveled the playing field in a way that caught many fans and experts by surprise. But how did we get here? Let's dive into the changes and figure out why some historically dominant teams have had challenges very unexpectedly in the early stages of this competition.\nThe New Format: More Challenges, Less Security\nWhat was the change, exactly? The answer is relatively simple, but with a significant amount of weight. Instead of the traditional structure of the group stage, 36 participants face eight different opponents during the qualification phase. That means every match matters. There are no longer six easy matches in each group like it used to be under the old system; instead, the teams are competing against a range of teams, as one good or bad draw can affect the level of difficulty.\nThe biggest stimuli to this new format is the struggle to penetrate the G-8, which would grant a direct qualification into the round of 16; further from that, it also provides a sorely needed rest in the fixture list. Teams placed between ninth and 24th place will have to play an additional playoff round for their qualification. That means wasting the G-8 can put teams' time and energy at waste, even at the risk of elimination.\nSo far, the result shows that tradition does not always guarantee immediate success, with teams like Aston Villa heading the table with three wins in as many games, alongside the surprise team Brest, while some of Europe's biggest clubs are struggling to stay in the hunt.\nReal Madrid: A Recovery Just in Time?\nOne would imagine that Real Madrid, with their 15 titles, would at least get a stable start. Being the Champions, they somehow managed to stumble, unpredictably, against Lille and then had almost repeated defeat in their clash with Borussia Dortmund. And it was only through a brilliant performance from Vinícius Júnior that the team from Madrid, which had conceded two goals in the first half, could turn the match around for a 5-2 victory.\nEven with this win, Madrid-the very definition of European consistency-cannot afford any more slip-ups. With just six points from three matches, they're hovering near the G-8 but still need to solidify their spot to avoid that extra playoff round-something this team, with their ambitions both in the Champions League and domestically, would most certainly like to avoid.\nBarcelona and a Brazilian Redemption\nThe other Spanish giant that has gotten off to a really bad start in the season is Barcelona. Like Madrid, they've gathered six points so far, but the team profited from a phenomenal night for Raphinha as he scored three goals in a 4-1 dominant win over Bayern Munich.\nThis victory got Barcelona back on track and put Bayern in a precarious situation, a team that, despite having won the Champions League in 2020, remains in a precarious position. The German team, five-time European champion, reached just three points from three games and came closer to perilously being excluded from the playoffs, ranking 23rd.\nBayern Munich: A Painful Defeat\nWorse is the situation of Bayern Munich. This sad defeat against Barcelona brought the team to a very uncomfortable place. Having only three points and standing at 23rd place, Bayern will face a real struggle in the remaining rounds for qualifying in the knockout stage.\nWe all do know that Bayern does have a tendency to get back from tricky situations, but the signs are simply there. The pressure is racked up on both players and coach from here on, especially given the expectations-high bar that always accompanies the Bayern name. Falling short of the knockout stage simply isn't an option for a club like this.\nAC Milan and Atlético de Madrid: Tradition Isn't Enough\nAC Milan, another powerhouse in European football, finds itself in dire straits. For a team that has won seven Champions League titles, making them one of the most successful in the competition, past glory seems not to be translating to the on-field results. Milan sits 25th with just three points from three games, placing it outside of a playoff position. The Italian side will need a dramatic change in fortunes in the coming rounds if they are to keep their hopes of advancing alive.\nMeanwhile, Atlético de Madrid, twice European runners-up this century, faces an equally challenging situation. This team slumped to 27th place with a total of just three points after a 3-1 home defeat by Lille, keeping head coach Diego Simeone busy with serious work. The usual solidity in defense and fighting spirit in big matches have not so far characterized this season's Atlético.",
