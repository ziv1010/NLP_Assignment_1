  "body_text": "Leupolz completes transfer to Real Madrid\nMelanie Leupolz has departed Chelsea after four trophy-laden seasons and completed a move to Spanish club Real Madrid.\nThe German international joined the Blues in March 2020 and established herself as a skillful and reliable presence in the Chelsea midfield against both domestic and European opposition.\nHer first campaign in west London ended with a Champions League final outing and four trophies. The first was the 2020 FA Community Shield and the Womens League Cup, the Womens Super League, and the Womens FA Cup followed.\nLeupolz made 34 appearances for the Blues across all competitions that season and was part of a midfield unit that contained the likes of Ji So-yun and Sophie Ingle.\nWe again claimed the WSL title and Womens FA Cup the following season. Leupolz played her part in that success and was supported by the club throughout her pregnancy, which was announced in March 2022.\nLeupolz gave birth in October 2022 and rejoined the Chelsea squad at the beginning of 2023. Soon after, she signed a new contract and made her return in an FA Cup match against Liverpool. Once again, it was a campaign that ended with a WSL title and FA Cup.\nThe 30-year-old was part of the Germany squad for the 2023 World Cup and retired from international football after the tournament. Back with the Blues, she became an increasingly influential figure as our 2023/24 campaign progressed.\nShe featured in both legs of our Champions League semi-final against Barcelona and started and scored on the final day of the season as we defeated Manchester United at Old Trafford to retain our WSL crown.\nEveryone at Chelsea would like to thank Melly for the contribution she has made to our success over the last four years. We wish the best for her and her family as they begin a new chapter.\n( Press Release Image: https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/323940/323940-1.jpg )\nWebWireID323940\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.
