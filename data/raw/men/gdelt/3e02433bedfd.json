  "body_text": "Euro Paper Talk: Edu eyes mouth-watering double attacking deal to catapult Arsenal into UCL contention; fallen Liverpool hero offered to Inter in swap for €90m star\nArsenal are plotting two sensational signings to bolster their attack ahead of a push for Champions League glory next season, Liverpool hope to tempt Inter Milan to part with a midfielder by offering them one of their big-name stars, while Tuesday’s Euro Paper Talk claims Bruno Guimaraes has made a decision on his future amid Real Madrid links.\nEDU SETS SIGHTS ON NICO WILLIAMS TRANSFER FOR ARSENAL\nArsenal are ready to go all out this summer with not one, but two blockbuster deals to strengthen their attack.\nMikel Arteta’s side are sat atop the Premier League and hope to end their 19-year title wait this season. They do have Manchester City breathing down their necks, though, with Manchester United a little further off the pace. As such, they can afford to make few errors during the run-in if they are to taste glory.\nWhatever their fate, Arsenal are at least closing in on a guaranteed top-four finish this season. And with it, Champions League football can return to Emirates Stadium for the first time since 2015/16.\nAs a result, sporting director Edu is already making plans to strengthen Arsenal’s squad ahead of the summer.\nAnd reports claim he wants two more attackers brought in that can catapult the Gunners into serious Champions League contenders.\nAccording to Calciomercato, the name at the top of Edu’s wishlist is Nico Williams.\nAlongside his brother, Inaki, the brothers have become mainstays of the Athletic Bilbao side in recent seasons.\nBut while Inaki has remained with the Basque club, it seems a summer move away for Nico is on the cards.\nThe 20-year-old winger currently has a £44m (€50m) exit clause in his contract. However, that arrangement is due to expire in summer 2024 – giving Arsenal a sniff at landing Williams on a cut-price deal.\nArsenal want to add Lautaro Martinez to Williams\nAston Villa and Liverpool are also reportedly keen. But Williams is reportedly insistent on only leaving Athletic Club for a Champions League side.\nKnowing Arsenal have the edge, Edu has reportedly been in touch with the player’s representatives.\nThe Gunners, it seems, will not stop there, either. And next on their radar they are also reportedly eyeing a swoop for Lautaro Martinez.\nThe Argentina star is seen as one of Serie A’s best attackers and currently sits second behind Victor Osimhen in this season’s top scorers list.\nHowever, Inter are still struggling financially and may need to cash in on a major asset this summer.\nAs such, journalist Phil Brown has told Football London that Arsenal are sniffing out a summer raid for Martinez.\n“Arsenal have been interested in Lautaro for a long time,” said Brown. “Whether they’ve actually ever made a firm bid, I’m not sure.\n“But certainly, there’s been talk of one, and I think he’s a player they would be willing to pay quite a lot of money for.”\nMartinez is rated at around the £70m (€80m) mark and has 90 goals and 31 assists in 215 appearances for the Nerazzurri.\nLIVERPOOL TO OFFER FABINHO IN SWAP FOR NICOLO BARELLA\nLiverpool are ready to include Fabinho as part of their attempts to persuade Inter Milan to part with £78m-rated (€90m) Nicolo Barella.
