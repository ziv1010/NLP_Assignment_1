Benzema completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot in the 42nd minute after Lucas Vazquez was fouled inside the box.\nAlmeria tried to rally before the break, and Lázaro managed to pull one back for the visitors. However, Rodrygo extended Real's lead in the second half with a sensational strike from outside the box, which found the top left corner of the net.\nDespite Real Madrid's dominance, they were unable to convert all their chances, with Vinicius and Rodrygo missing sitters, while both Benzema and Asensio hit the post twice each. Real were initially awarded a penalty for a foul on Benzema inside the box, but the referee reversed his decision after checking the VAR replay.\nThe final score was 4-2 in favor of Real Madrid, who now move within eight points of leaders Barcelona. The victory was crucial for Carlo Ancelotti's side, who were looking to get back to winning ways ahead of their Champions League semi-final against Manchester City on May 9th.\nBenzema's performance was particularly impressive, and he is now only one goal behind Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski in the race to be LaLiga's top scorer this season. Real Madrid will need him to continue his excellent form in the remaining six games if they want to maintain their slim title hopes.\nDespite Almeria's valiant efforts, the defending champions were ultimately too strong for them. Substitute Lucas Robertone did manage to pull one back for the visitors with a header, but it was not enough to change the result of the game.\nReal Madrid will now turn their attention to their upcoming fixtures, as they seek to continue their strong form and put pressure on Barcelona at the top of the table.\n-\nBreezy Johnson engaged at Olympics after emotional finish line proposal\n-\nOlympics men hockey game: McDavid, Crosby power Canada past Czechia\n-\nEx-Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey charged with additional rape counts\n-\nChloe Kim set for historic halfpipe gold showdown at Milano Cortina\n-\nVladyslav Heraskevych disqualified from Winter Olympics 2026 over helmet controversy\n-\nThomas Tuchel set for England contract extension through Euro 2028\n-\nMilano-Cortina 2026: Assessing Italy’s Winter Olympics economic growth\n-\nVictor Wembanyama’s historic first half tops Tim Duncan, sparks massive NBA reactions",
