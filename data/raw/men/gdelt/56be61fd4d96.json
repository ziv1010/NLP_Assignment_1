  "body_text": "Mikel Arteta would appear to be in the market for a new striker, and is set to make a move for €70m-rated Dusan Vlahovic in the January transfer window.\nThe Gunners continue to be linked with the 24-year-old from Juventus, and CaughtOffside sources indicate that Arteta wants to make a splash in the new year to help Arsenal during the second half of the 2024/25 campaign.\nArsenal want Dusan Vlahovic in January\nIt’s understood that the Spaniard believes that the Serbian hit-man would be the perfect striker for the way in which his team are playing currently.\nIndeed, the expansive and sometimes direct football seen by the Gunners is a joy to watch until the final third – when there’s often no one to put the ball in the net.\nHaving a striker that knows where the goal is will arguably elevate Arsenal’s chances of being in the mix for silverware at the end of the season.\nAt present they find themselves six points behind Premier League leaders, Liverpool, but the Reds have a game in hand and aren’t dropping too many points.\nIt will take a monumental effort to catch Arne Slot’s side whilst they’re in such form, but if any team can put a bit of pressure on, you never know what could happen.\nREAD MORE: Man United battling Arsenal for lethal striker\nArteta only needs to remind his players of the way that Newcastle choked back in the 1990s, when they were, at one stage, 11 points ahead of Manchester United.\nSources have further advanced that the Gunners won’t get things their own way in January, however.\nThat’s because all of Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City are monitoring Vlahovic’s situation.\nPep Guardiola will have seen up close the damage that Vlahovic can do, after he helped Juve topple City in the Champions League this week.\nThe Bianconeri want to keep the player, whose contract runs until 2026, however, if a new contract agreement can’t be reached quickly, the club will consider selling him.\nThe transfer fee in January would therefore be around the €70m mark.",
