  "body_text": "Omar Marmoush scored his first goal for Manchester City, and his second and third, as Pep Guardiola’s side played some excellent football to sweep Newcastle United aside and win 4-0 at the Etihad.\nThe Egypt forward, who joined from Eintracht Frankfurt for a fee in the region of €70million (£58.4m; $73.5m) in January, had started three matches before today without scoring, but he was the star on Saturday against a Newcastle team that have now failed to win away to City in the league since 2000.\nAdvertisement\nMarmoush scored three times in the opening 33 minutes to put City in control of the game and that was the perfect response for Guardiola after their disappointing collapse in the Champions League play-off first leg against Real Madrid on Tuesday. James McAtee, a substitute, made it 4-0 late on.\nFor Newcastle, meanwhile, it was a hugely disappointing display and result. Eddie Howe’s side had won six away games on the bounce in all competitions before this match, including big wins in the Premier League.\nSam Lee and Chris Waugh analyse the key talking points from City’s comfortable 4-0 win…\nMarmoush offered Haaland levels of threat\nBalls in behind Newcastle’s high line were clearly on the City agenda and Marmoush is the perfect man for that — after his debut against Chelsea, Guardiola lamented how his midfield team-mates did not spot his runs, but that it would come with time.\nThere was one moment in the first half when fellow new boy Nico Gonzalez did not play the Egyptian in, which frustrated Guardiola, though he still made time to offer two thumbs up for the run. It was from one of those darts that the first goal came: Kieran Trippier completely misjudged Ederson’s pass, but Marmoush’s delicate lob was exactly what was needed.\nThere was a slight deflection on the second goal and the third was all about a different type of run — a late arrival into the area allowed him to finish coolly and seal a hat-trick within 33 minutes. That’s Erling Haaland levels of threat and if City can rely on anything similar in the coming weeks, as well as all the good stuff Nico did in midfield, then they could well benefit from the new dynamic they have dearly needed.\nNeither of those played in midweek against Real Madrid, but they do offer some hope that the 3-2 deficit could be turned around in the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday.\nSam Lee\nAdvertisement\nNewcastle’s wretched form at the Etihad\nNewcastle had been making an enviable habit of confounding their own historical records at bogey grounds. Victories at Old Trafford and the Emirates were huge achievements, but winning at the Etihad proved a step too far.\nFor the 16th Premier League visit to Manchester City in a row, Newcastle left with absolutely nothing. They have never triumphed at the Etihad in the league across 21 visits, with this their 19th defeat, and they last won at Manchester City in September 2000. That was at Maine Road, a stadium that has not existed for more than two decades.\nIf this latest defeat felt borderline inevitable when only those statistics are considered, that ignores the wider context surrounding this match.\nNewcastle had won six successive away games in all competitions, including claiming victories at Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, and four of those had been in the Premier League. Manchester City, meanwhile, have been a shadow of the imperious side who have dominated English football in recent years and had lost 12 matches in all competitions, including throwing away a lead against Real Madrid at home in midweek.\nThat is why this customary defeat at the Etihad felt different to previous ones. It was so deflating precisely because Newcastle actually visited east Manchester with something bordering upon expectation.\nAnd they just wilted, as they always do at that ground.\nChris Waugh\nCity’s perfect response after Madrid defeat\nFor City, this was not a performance that could easily be seen coming. Only yesterday, Guardiola admitted that his team cannot sustain their approach for 90 minutes, that other teams are more physical than them, that Newcastle would pose certain challenges, and of course, City had just shown more evidence of their vulnerability against Real Madrid.\nAdvertisement\nSo this was a huge surprise, maybe even for the relentlessly positive Guardiola. Newcastle’s own meekness has to be taken into account, but City were themselves brave and early on they won second balls and regained possession high up the pitch in a way they have struggled to do this season.\nNico added exactly what they needed in midfield, staying calm on the ball and helping to win it back (one second-half stopping of a counter-attack is exactly what they have been lacking), while Marmoush obviously added an X factor.\nThose are two big differences, but this was a day when Ilkay Gundogan and Rico Lewis, two of City’s biggest strugglers, seemed to understand the brief and played their parts, too.\nAnd then there was the long ball over the top of Newcastle, which completely shredded the visitors in the first half. City were calm on the ball until the time came to go long and they made those decisions very well.\nEven after half-time, when the game petered out and City could not, in fact, keep up their first-half performance levels, they were solid enough to not only add another, but to not concede, which, given their record of throwing away leads, is a very good sign.\nSam Lee\nNewcastle, what happened?\nSimple question, not-so-simple answer, beyond the obvious that Newcastle were awful during the first half and were punished, of course.\nWhat is harder to explain is exactly why Newcastle were so poor, or indeed why Howe approached the match in the way he did. Having produced a tactical masterclass against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg, his game plan against Manchester City was more difficult to understand.\nPuzzlingly, Newcastle had not delivered a performance like this since the 4-2 defeat at Brentford on December 7. Bournemouth and Fulham may have left Tyneside with all three points last month, but the former were magnificent and the latter saw Newcastle deliver a flat display rather than the pitiful first-half showing at the Etihad.\nAdvertisement\nBy the eighth minute, Manchester City had managed 95 per cent possession and Newcastle had not completed a single pass. A cautious early approach at the Etihad, given Newcastle’s appalling record there, is not itself an unwise move, but what followed was puzzling.\nRather than show the aggressive pressing and intense off-the-ball work they did against Arsenal, or offer the same transitional threat, Newcastle were strangely passive. A similar man-to-man marking system was also on show but, while it looked brave and bold against Arsenal, it looked self-destructive against Manchester City.\nLong balls from Ederson regularly got Manchester City in behind Newcastle’s defence, while Kieran Trippier and Lewis Hall, the full-backs, were often exposed. For the opening goal, one flighted pass through the middle was misjudged horribly by Trippier, while the next two goals contained errors that were just as fundamental.\nThere was no real offensive output on show either, with Alexander Isak isolated and seemingly uninterested.\nAlthough there was moderate improvement after the break, that was partly because Manchester City stepped off a little and aside from Lewis Miley forcing a comfortable save, Newcastle never really looked like scoring.\nAs a first test as part of a “season-defining” run, as Howe termed it, this represented an alarming collective failure. Hopefully, this was just an awful aberration rather than a sign of things to come.\nChris Waugh\nEderson, the record-breaker\nWhen Guardiola says City could not have achieved everything they have done without Ederson, it is not hyperbole.\nThe Brazilian’s consistency and quality of distribution, both short and long, have been fundamental ever since he moved to Manchester in 2017, and while this has not been his best season by any means — the consistency has not quite been there, as his mistakes against Madrid on Tuesday suggested at the end of an otherwise very good performance — but he will always have quality in most of those passes.\nAdvertisement\nThat was evident again here and it was something Guardiola could rely on: the game plan was obviously to play long over the Newcastle defence and while it was not always Ederson playing the passes, he is the one you would most want to deliver them.\nHe now has the most assists of any goalkeeper in Premier League history and, although this is probably no surprise given he is hardly whipping in crosses from out wide, they have essentially all been the same: a clipped ping over a defence that has dared to squeeze up the pitch.\nThe only surprise about the one on Saturday was that it was not Haaland on the end of it. If Marmoush can offer that threat as well, there could well be more Ederson assists before the end of the season, which could be the end of the goalkeeper’s time at City.\nSam Lee\nWhere was Bruno Guimaraes?\nManchester City fans who have not seen Bruno Guimaraes play live very often may have been left wondering why their club has so regularly been linked with the Brazilian.\nSo often Newcastle’s talisman, Guimaraes has provided six assists and scored two goals this season, the majority of which have arrived since his switch to a No 8 role in December.\nBut at the Etihad, Guimaraes, alongside his midfield team-mates, was completely overrun in midfield. The pre-match expectation was that Newcastle’s engine room would have too much energy, physicality and athleticism for a fatigued and out-of-form Manchester City, yet the opposite was true.\nJoe Willock, the scorer of two goals in the FA Cup last week at Birmingham City from a left-wing berth, deputised for the injured Joelinton, but was anonymous as the left-sided No 8 and was hooked at half-time for Lewis Miley, the 18-year-old. Sandro Tonali, who has been imperious since being deployed in the No 6 position since mid-December, was poor in possession and did not cover the ground as swiftly as usual.\nAnd then there was Guimaraes who, aside from a lovely flick to lay on a second-half chance for Miley, barely affected the game. His pass-completion rate was only 69 per cent, with eight of his 26 passes misplaced.\nAdvertisement\nAs brilliant as Guimaraes has been since joining Newcastle in January 2022, his ability to dominate against the elite sides remains questionable. He, like his team-mates, must be infinitely better at Wembley for the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool on March 16.\nChris Waugh\nWhat did Pep Guardiola say?\nWe will bring you this after he has spoken at the post-match press conference.\nWhat did Eddie Howe say?\nWe will bring you this after he has spoken at the post-match press conference.\nWhat next for City?\nWednesday, February 19: Real Madrid (A), Champions League, 8pm GMT, 3pm ET\nWhat next for Newcastle?\nSunday, February 23: Nottingham Forest (H), Premier League, 2pm GMT, 9am ET\nRecommended reading\n- How did Newcastle’s Lloyd Kelly end up in the Champions League with Juventus?\n- Nico Gonzalez, the Barcelona years: Why they were happy to let ‘next Busquets’ go\n- Want to thrive in the Premier League?
