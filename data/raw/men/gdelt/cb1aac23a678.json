  "body_text": "Arsenal’s summer transfer window has yet to kick into gear, but several of their direct and European rivals have already made decisive moves, increasing the pressure on the Gunners to act.\nWith Andrea Berta newly appointed as sporting director, there is belief that Arsenal’s strategy is taking shape — but the market is moving quickly, and hesitation risks narrowing their pool of viable top-level options.\nManchester City, who endured a below-par campaign by their standards, are leading the way in early transfer activity.\nPep Guardiola’s side have completed deals for Tijjani Reijnders from AC Milan (£59 million), creative midfielder Rayan Cherki from Lyon and Wolves left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri.\nThey have also beaten Arsenal to the signing of highly-rated Norwegian teenager Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg — a player the Gunners had tracked closely since January.\nCity’s proactive approach comes despite the looming distraction of the Club World Cup, highlighting the urgency with which they are trying to refresh the squad.\nArsenal, who are not involved in the tournament, may be better placed to integrate summer arrivals during pre-season — but that advantage is only meaningful if deals are done early.\nElsewhere, Liverpool — the reigning Premier League champions — have made a major statement by securing Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen in a blockbuster move.\nThe Gunners admired the German international, but Liverpool’s early conviction and lack of CWC obligations allowed them to move decisively.\nChelsea are another side moving aggressively. Although they have not yet finalised a deal, they are making a strong push to sign Jamie Bynoe-Gittens from Borussia Dortmund.\nThe young winger is attracting serious interest from across the Premier League, and Arsenal will need to decide quickly whether to re-enter that conversation or look elsewhere.\nMeanwhile, Leroy Sane is expected to join Galatasaray after Bayern Munich’s Club World Cup campaign concludes. Though not a primary Arsenal target, his decision closes another attacking avenue in the market.\nSimilarly, Real Madrid’s Rodrygo now looks likely to remain in Spain, with Arsenal distancing themselves from a potential deal as Madrid appear unwilling to sell.\nThere is growing uncertainty around Benjamin Sesko. Arsenal have been heavily involved in that chase, but interest from Saudi Arabia is beginning to shift the landscape. The Slovenian forward may be tempted by the financial pull, even as Arsenal weigh up the sporting fit.\nViktor Gyokeres remains a live option, though negotiations with Sporting CP have proven difficult, with club president Frederico Varandas determined to stick to the release clause and avoid drawn-out bargaining.\nManchester United, despite their 15th-place finish and lack of European football, have also moved early with the £62.5 million capture of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.\nUnited’s pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo has intensified, with the Brentford forward — once mentioned in Arsenal’s recruitment circles — now signalling a willingness to join them. It is another reminder of how quickly targets can disappear in a fast-moving market.\nEven in Europe, the competition is showing little mercy. Arsenal had serious interest in Espanyol goalkeeper Joan Garcia, seen internally as a long-term contender to replace Aaron Ramsdale. But Barcelona moved quickly to secure him, leaving the Gunners once again watching a potential solution go elsewhere.\nAll of this adds to the importance of Berta’s arrival at the Emirates. Known for his sharp negotiation skills and ability to work across multiple leagues, the former Atletico Madrid chief will be tasked with converting Arsenal’s long-standing scouting and internal interest in players into meaningful signings.\nEdu’s technical team had laid much of the groundwork for various options, but with deals beginning to accelerate elsewhere, Arsenal need to move from interest to action.\nWith Mikel Arteta’s side set to return to the Champions League and build on a campaign that faltered late, the importance of squad depth and flexibility will be key. But at present, their biggest rivals are not waiting — and some of the smartest names on Arsenal’s long list are vanishing one by one.\nIf Arsenal are to make the step from challengers to champions, this summer must reflect that ambition — not just in intention, but in execution.",
