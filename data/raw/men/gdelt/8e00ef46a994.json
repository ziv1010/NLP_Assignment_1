He's a player with different qualities and an unbelievable courage to play football in any circumstances. As we always demand, stay with our players, give them support because for sure they're going to perform better.\"\nWhen asked directly if he had made a decision on Zinchenko's future, the boss said: \"The decision is to be focused on the Champions League quarter-finals and to be through.\"\nZinchenko moved to the Emirates in 2022 after leaving rivals Manchester City. He impressed during his first season in an inverted full-back role and made 33 appearances across all competitions.\nThis season, a handful of injuries have limited Zinchenko's time on the pitch, with Arteta occasionally turning to centre-back Jakub Kiwior on the left side of his defence.\nRecent reports have linked Arsenal with new left-backs this summer, yet it is unknown whether a new signing will be made to outright replace Zinchenko or increase competition. Arteta has long stressed the importance of having two elite options for every position on the pitch.",
