Mattia Zaccagni is ruled out until early March with a stomach strain, while defenders Patric and Samuel Gigot are also unavailable. These absences could force Maurizio Sarri into a defensive reshuffle, with Cristian Romagnoli’s fitness still being carefully managed and concerns lingering over centre-back depth.\n↔️\n🟨\n🟥\n↔️\n🟥\n🟥\nTopically, they’ve failed to get on the scoresheet in a league-high seven Serie A away matches this season. Leaving the home comforts of their Stadio Olimpico could be a blessing in disguise for the Biancocelesti, as they’ve avoided defeat on their last four Serie A road trips (W2, D3).\n🟨\nLazio’s upcoming visit is unlikely to threaten Juventus’ dominance on home turf, given that they’ve won their last five meetings in Turin. However, Thursday’s mauling in Bergamo may have derailed a feel-good factor at the Allianz Stadium, though it marked only Spalletti’s third defeat in 21 matches in charge of the club.\n🟨\n↔️\n↔️\nXI LAZIO: Provedel; Marusic, Mario Gila, Provstgaard, Nuno Tavares; Taylor, Cataldi, Basic; Isaksen, Maldini, Pedro.\nStay tuned to watch Juventus vs Lazio live.\nHow to watch the match live?\nIf you want to watch it directly via streaming: https://www.disneyplus.com in North America\nIf you want to watch it online, VAVEL is your best\nWhat time is the Juventus vs Lazio match for matchday 23 in Serie A 2025-26?\n- Argentina: 4:45 PM on ESPN and Disney Plus Premium\n- Bolivia: 3:45 PM on ESPN and Disney Plus Premium\n- Brazil: 4:45 PM on ESPN and Disney Plus Premium\n- Chile: 4:45 PM on ESPN and Disney Plus Premium\n- Colombia: 2:45 PM on ESPN\n- Ecuador: 2:45 PM on ESPN and Disney Plus Premium\n- USA (ET): 2:45 PM on ESPN and Disney Plus Premium\n- Spain: 8:45 PM on ESPN and Disney Plus Premium\n- Mexico: 1:45 PM on ESPN and Disney Plus Premium\n- Paraguay: 4:45 PM on ESPN and Disney Plus Premium\n- Peru: 2:45 PM on ESPN and Disney Plus Premium\n- Uruguay: 4:45 PM on ESPN and Disney Plus Premium\n- Venezuela: 3:45 PM on ESPN and Disney Plus Premium\n🟨\nLazio have shown similar defensive resilience early, having trailed at the break in only four of their league matches so far. However, they have started matches poorly in attack, failing to score in the first half in each of their last nine Serie A games.\n🟥\nAdditionally, historical trends firmly point to a low-scoring affair. Each of their last four H2Hs and all of Lazio’s previous eight away games have seen fewer than 2.5 goals.\nHowever, a goalless draw at full-time is unlikely, as none of their last 38 competitive clashes have ended 0-0. This suggests a tactical battle in Northern Italy where a single goal could be decisive. There is value in backing Juventus to secure victory in a low-scoring fixture.\n🟥\nJuventus expected lineup: Di Gregorio, Kalulu, Bremer, Kelly, Cambiaso, Locatelli, Thuram, Conceicao, Mckennie, Yildiz, David\nLazio expected lineup: Provedel, Pellegrini, Provstgaard, Gila, Marusic, Basic, Cataldi, Taylor, Isaksen, Maldini, Rodriguez\n🟥\n- Positioned 4th in the standings with 45 points, Juventus will face 8th-placed Lazio, who have accumulated 32 points.\n- Juventus boasts an impressive 64 percent win rate at home in Serie A.\n- In their extensive head-to-head history, Juventus has emerged victorious 28 times in 49 matches against Lazio in the league.\n↔️\n- Lazio have remained unbeaten in four of their last five matches in all competitions, with their only defeat during this period coming by a 3-0 margin at the hands of Como in a Serie A encounter last month.\n- Juventus have failed to find the back of the net in two of their last three matches in all competitions, with their only goals scored during this period coming in a 4-1 victory against Parma.\n- The last three matches between Lazio and Juventus have witnessed only four goals.\n🟨\n- Juventus have a good recent record against Lazio and have won 35 out of the last 67 matches played between the two teams, as opposed to Lazio's 17 victories.\n- Juventus are on an unbeaten run of four matches on the trot and had won three of these games before they suffered a 3-0 defeat against Atalanta in the Coppa Italia in their previous game.\nStart of transmission\nMy name is Juan Sebastian Rodriguez and I will be your host for this match.
