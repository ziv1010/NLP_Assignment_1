  "body_text": "It’s coming down to the wire for Barcelona.\nWhat should Barcelona prioritize before the close of the transfer window?\nThe club has signaled there’s still business to be done\nThe question is whether the team is better off today than it was at the close of last season. A season without trophies. Hard to say the answer is yes.\nThere’s a new manager in town, and lots of new faces. Most of them, however, are young players from the academy who are being given their first shot at first division Spanish football.\nAdd Dani Olmo to the mix, and that’s it, with just about a week to go before the summer transfer window closes.\nFor Barcelona, given the current financial struggles they are navigating, departures are just as important as arrivals.\nSo far, Ilkay Gündoğan was the big name to make way, seemingly to get his wages off the books. For many, the German international was Barca’s best, if not most reliable, player last season.\nFor a team very short on midfielders to start the season, especially those who can play in a single attacking midfield role, this is a very risky move.\nWhat are the alternatives?\nPedri, who struggles to stay fit. Dani Olmo, who deputized there successfully for Spain. And Fermin Lopez, who is still relatively unproven.\nGündoğan also had the ability to play in a double pivot. In the first game of the season, Barca Atlètic products took the reins there. Yet another risk going forward.\nSo there it is. The August surprise. Last year, it was initiated by Ousmane Dembele. This year it was Barcelona themselves, led by Deco, who made the move.\nCount me as cautiously optimistic about this team’s chances.\nI can’t wait to get behind the young players, and the new coach who is courageously giving them a shot. Hansi Flick will deserve all the credit if a few new stars are born.\nAnd it would save the club a lot of money too. Which makes it all the more curious why management felt it was necessary to splash out so much for Olmo.\nIf it doesn’t work out, you’re really in trouble.\nLook how hard it has been to offload Ferran Torres. Barca is stuck there, and the consequences are significant.\nYou can’t help but feel that Barcelona was trying to capitalize on the excitement of the Spanish run to the Euro title.\nWhen things started looking dicey with the signing of Nico Williams, the player Barca really wanted, they turned to what they thought was the next best option. Dani Olmo is a good player, but it feels like the Blaugrana certainly overpaid for him.\nIt’s embarrassing that Vitor Roque, their big signing from last season, is already forgotten and going out on loan. But the past is in the past. There’s time to do better this time around.\nSo what can Barcelona do to strengthen the squad, and give Flick what he needs to be competitive in La Liga and the Champions League?\nDoes this team have the depth it needs at all positions?\nIf the roster were healthy, I’d say they have enough.\nHowever, there are big questions surrounding the fitness of Pedri, Frenkie de Jong, Gavi, Ronald Araujo, and even Alejandro Balde.\nMore needs to be done this summer to take the pressure off the young players, and to support Hansi Flick.\nIn general, I love the idea of focusing on the big picture, returning to your roots, and giving La Masia a chance to really shine on the world’s stage.\nThat will take patience, however.\nAnd we can’t forget there’s a lot at stake.\nLet’s hope that the departure of Gündoğan isn’t the canary in the coal mine.\nHe was a critical leader on the field, and a valuable locker room presence as well.\nThose qualities will be missed, and they’re not easily replaced.\nTime for Deco and Joan Laporta to get to work while there’s still time.\nAnd for Flick to speak up for what he needs.",
