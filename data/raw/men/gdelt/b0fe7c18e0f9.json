They could diagram how Liverpool overloaded the right wing with practised triangle rotations while Real Madrid returned the favour by pulling Karim Benzema wide left to create space for Vinicius Junior’s flamethrower dribbling at the other end. They could run film on how both teams scored goals by recognizing pressing triggers and jumping a line to cut off goalkeepers’ passing lanes with their cover shadows or whatever.\nThis would all be fine and correct. It would also completely miss the point.\nThe story of the game — the real story, the one that mattered — was that people just kept slipping all over the place.\nIt started 90 seconds in, when Cody Gakpo pressured Eduardo Camavinga into coughing up the ball at the corner of Madrid’s box. Gakpo had a chance to put Mohamed Salah in on goal, but before he could play the pass his feet mysteriously flew out from under him like he’d been slide tackled by Tyler Durden…\nThe 14th minute was a whole Yakety Sax solo’s worth of hijinks as first Jordan Henderson, then Camavinga and finally Thibaut Courtois all slipped and fell in one 10-second sequence to gift Liverpool a 2-0 goal that even Jurgen Klopp called “slapstick”.\nWhat was he supposed to say, that he drew it up like that?\nANFIELD ERUPTS AGAIN! 📢\nMo Salah pounces on a huge error from Thibaut Courtois 🇪🇬#UCL pic.twitter.com/zhMGQhSK9K\n— Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) February 21, 2023\nIn the 20th minute, Liverpool’s 4-1-4-1 defensive shape came undone when Stefan Bajcetic slipped and fell. Fabinho had to shift over to cover for his fallen teammate, leaving Camavinga wide open in midfield to hit a comfortable switch to Vinicius Jr, who dribbled into the box and scored the kind of mind-melting golazo that makes you forget all about some guy falling down 15 seconds earlier.\nAdvertisement\nDid Bajcetic’s slip cause the goal? Not really. But would the play have happened without it? Probably not. It’s a weird sport.\nWHAT A GOAL THAT IS! 🙌\nVinícius Júnior with a whip around the Alisson ✨\nWhat a game we have here 💥#UCL pic.twitter.com/7wXE9j2ppk\n— Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) February 21, 2023\nA few minutes later, Real Madrid narrowly avoided catastrophe as Eder Militao almost faceplanted on a goal kick with Darwin Nunez lurking…\n… and then narrowly missed out on glory when Vini went skates-up trying to recreate the curled shot from his first goal…\nThe ground looked a little firmer after halftime — maybe the players changed boots? Perhaps the grass dried out? But by that time, the match’s chaotic energy had long since slipped the surly bonds of Earth and touched the face of God.\nSo even though it almost didn’t matter by that point, it felt fitting that Madrid’s last goal of an incredible five-nil run came when Alisson charged out to stop Benzema, couldn’t quite decide which way to go, and slid helplessly to the ground. It was just that kind of day.\nGravity always seems to tug a little harder at Anfield, where the spectre of Steven Gerrard still stalks the pitch. Pep Guardiola drew heat last week for mentioning Gerrard’s title-deciding 2014 slip in an interview, but in the same breath he brought up a Mario Balotelli fall that had worked out luckily for City. The point was: slip happens. What can you do?\nOne option in the face of football’s basic randomness is to try to outsmart it, to master every little detail and search out every last edge. That’s the approach this modern version of Liverpool are famous for. Even the Anfield playing surface that was giving players fits is the most sophisticated grass-turf hybrid that money can buy.\n“That pitch is as finely tuned as the athletes who play on it,” one groundskeeping expert told The Athletic. “Tests are done regularly and everything is data-driven.”\nHe was talking about grass. The grass is data-driven.\nAdvertisement\nAnother option is to be like Carlo Ancelotti, who never sweats the small stuff. “Fortunately,” the Real Madrid manager said, “as always happens with our team — or quite often happens, anyway — we kept our heads and gradually got ourselves back into the game.” Maybe it’s easier to embrace chaos when it always seems to work in your brilliant players’ favour.\nOver at Klopp’s post-game presser, he was trying to avoid making excuses. “Most of the time, players didn’t slip,” he said. “I don’t know exactly why a few players slipped. We will speak about that.”\nBut to point out that players spent their Tuesday night falling down more often than a Chumbawamba song isn’t to say that Liverpool were good (after a dominant first half hour, they weren’t) or Real Madrid bad (they were often brilliant). The slips worked for and against both teams.\nApart from the scoreline, it was a pretty even match.\nThe point is just that the concepts of “good” and “bad” don’t always matter in football, a sport where players do a lot of smart, skilful, athletic stuff, and sometimes the ball goes in the net, and those two things are only occasionally related.\nLiverpool weren’t exactly graceful, but this game wasn’t the catastrophe it will be made out to be. Look past the scoreline and there were positives to take away: a rejuvenated right-side triangle with Jordan Henderson back in his favourite spot; some bright moments from the young newcomers Nunez, Gakpo and Bajcetic.\nFiveThirtyEight’s team strength model ran the underlying numbers on this disaster and decided Liverpool are actually a little better than it thought. Bookies still give the club implied odds of about 40 per cent to squeak into the Premier League’s top four. Their season isn’t over yet.\nBut in the Champions League? Yeah, Liverpool are probably down for the count. Year after year, knockout round after knockout round, everyone else slips away and Real Madrid are still standing.\n(Top photo: Getty Images)",
