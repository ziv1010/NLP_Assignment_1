  "body_text": "FOOTBALL – Real Madrid slumped to a 2-1 defeat at Real Betis after their former player Isco converted a second-half penalty yesterday, denying the visitors the chance to top LaLiga.\nThe loss leaves Real Madrid level on 54 points with leaders Barcelona, who host mid-table Real Sociedad today.\n“I’m dead, exhausted. In the end it’s very hard to win games against Madrid, who have millions of resources, it’s very difficult,” Isco, named man of the match, told Movistar.\n“I’m happy for the win against the best team out there today. Hopefully we can finish the year in the best possible way.”\nMadrid dominated the early proceedings and took the lead after 10 minutes when Brahim Diaz tapped in Ferland Mendy’s pass from the left after a great through ball from Kylian Mbappe.\nBetis overcame the sluggish start, though, and equalised in the 34th through Johnny Cardoso’s close-range header off a corner from Isco.\nMadrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois pulled off a crucial save to deny Cardoso a second goal shortly before halftime.\nThe Belgian, however, could not prevent Isco from scoring a clinical spot kick to hand Betis the lead nine minutes after the break following Antonio Rudiger’s foul on Jesus Rodriguez.\nMadrid boss Carlo Ancelotti sought to spark some life into his attack with the introduction of Arda Guler and Endrick, but Betis’ backline held firm while goalkeeper Adrian blocked a late attempt from Vinicius Jr.\n“We started off a bit off the pace, letting them play too much and they hurt us. But the team improved halfway through the first half,” the 32-year-old Isco said.\n“I am always grateful to Madrid for having helped me fulfil all the dreams a child has and I will always have Madrid in my heart,” he added, having won five Champions League trophies, three LaLiga titles and the Copa del Rey with the club.\nBetis now have 38 points and are in sixth spot, the final European qualifying berth.\nReal Madrid must raise their game ahead of the Champions League Round of 16, coach Carlo Ancelotti warned after the defeat, calling the loss a “heavy blow” to his side’s LaLiga title hopes.\nAncelotti criticised his team’s poor performance at the Benito Villamarin stadium and said a similar display at home to Atletico in Tuesday’s Champions League first leg could prove costly.\n“This is a heavy blow, we have to bounce back. Losing at this point in the season is tough because everyone is on form and we didn’t do well in this game,” the Italian told reporters.\n“We lost 27 balls in the first half and Betis got back into the game. If we play like this, we certainly won’t win on Tuesday.”",
