Indeed, Chelsea would need to agree a fee with Dortmund in addition to agreeing personal terms, though the once quoted price of €100m (£86m) no longer stands.\nShould Gittens, who followed the same path as Sancho by departing Manchester City for Dortmund, make his way to west London, he could end up taking the place of a player still struggling to recapture his best form.\nSancho's big-money move to Manchester United has gone horrifically wrong, with his current loan spell at Chelsea not pulling up any trees either. The five-time Premier League winners are, however, obligated to buy the 25-year-old in a deal worth up to £25m – £20m as a standard fee plus £5m in performance related add-ons.\nSuch has been Sancho's lack of success, there's been talk of Chelsea paying a penalty £5m fee to United to break their agreement – whether or not that comes to fruition remains to be seen.\nAnother option for Chelsea is to sign Sancho permanently and then get rid of him immediately – that's a scenario that GIVEMESPORT have put forward. Their reports states that Sancho could return to Dortmund for a third spell, in a separate deal to the one that they're negotiating for Gittens, who has 12 goals and three assists to his name in all competitions.",
