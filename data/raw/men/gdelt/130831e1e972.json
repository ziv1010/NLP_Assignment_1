  "body_text": "When the quarter-finals of the Champions League arrive, you know it’s the business end of the season.\nEight teams remain in Europe’s top competition, and the route to the final is now mapped out.\nOn one side of the draw, the winners of Real Madrid’s gargantuan clash with Manchester City will face the victors of Arsenal’s match-up with Bayern Munich — with both ties already overflowing with narrative from seasons gone by.\nOn the other side, Paris Saint-Germain’s battle with Barcelona may not appear as mouth-watering as previous years, but the attacking talent on show will mean that the pair are likely to trade blows relentlessly across the two legs. Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid are likely to go all-in on the European stage after relatively disappointing form in their respective domestic campaigns.\nAdvertisement\nStatistically speaking, Dortmund and Atleti share the match-up with the lowest average team strength of the remaining ties. Using Opta’s Power Rankings — a global ranking system containing more than 13,000 clubs rated between zero (lowest) and 100 (highest) — the pair sit as the bottom two among the eight sides prevailing in the competition, but with their tactical differences you underestimate this clash at your own risk.\nBy contrast, treble-holders Manchester City’s clash with La Liga champions elect — and 14-time European Cup winners — Real Madrid is undoubtedly the tie of the round. The pair have become accustomed to meeting each other in the knockouts in recent seasons, most frequently in the semi-finals where they have one victory apiece across the past two campaigns — both going on to subsequently lift the trophy.\nThis, then, is The Athletic’s definitive guide to the Champions League quarter-finals.\nArsenal vs Bayern Munich\nIn a strange way, Mikel Arteta might actually be more pleased to face Bayern Munich than last-16 opponents Porto.\nAnyone who watched either of Arsenal’s two legs with Sergio Conceicao’s side will have seen how much Porto frustrated their opponents with their near-impenetrable, narrow, mid-to-low defensive block — comfortable in ceding possession and forcing Arsenal to go around, over, but rarely through their compact structure.\nThis has been a recurring theme for Arsenal this season — finding it difficult to break down low-block opponents who limit central progression and double-mark their wingers.\nHowever, Arteta’s side have shown how much they can punish opponents who go toe to toe with them under the lights. A 4-0 thumping of PSV and a 6-0 demolishing of Lens in the group stage saw Arsenal exploit transitional moments when the game opened up and, with Thomas Tuchel’s Bayern highly unlikely to play underdog football, you can be confident that there will be space that Arsenal’s front line can capitalise on.\nAdvertisement\nDefending has been Arsenal’s super-strength in 2023-24. They have only conceded five goals in eight Champions League games this season — Borussia Dortmund are the only other quarter-final team with as watertight a defence and no team has allowed fewer than Arsenal’s eight big chances.\nTheir pressing from a 4-4-2 shape is among the best in Europe, able to suffocate opponents out wide and force turnovers.\nArsenal’s rest defence has been essential in sustaining attacks and preventing counter-attacks, which will be essential to minimise opportunities for Kingsley Coman, Leroy Sane and Jamal Musiala to exploit space and overloads after regains. Bayern, with 113 successful dribbles and a 60 per cent completion rate, are the top Champions League dribblers this season.\nWith an average age of 25.9, Arsenal are the second-youngest team left in the Champions League (after PSG, 25.3 yrs average age). Regardless, in beating Porto they overcame their round of 16 Achilles’ Heel, the stage they exited the competition in seven successive years between 2011 and 2017.\nGO DEEPER\nArsenal and the Champions League round of 16: A story in need of a different ending\nFor Bayern, the overwhelming narrative centres around Harry Kane’s return to this particular part of England. Arsenal fans will be all too familiar with Kane’s performances in the 16 Premier League matches that he appeared in against them for Tottenham Hotspur, with a return of 14 goals making him the all-time leading scorer in the north London derby.\nKane’s first season in Bavaria has been phenomenal from a personal perspective. No player in Europe’s top five leagues can top his 32-goal haul, while no one has bagged more than his six goals in the Champions League.\nThe minor detail is that Kane’s goalscoring form does not look like it’s been enough to lead Bayern Munich to a 12th Bundesliga title in a row. Individually, he could do little more, but domestic titles continue to evade him in a career where he has topped the 20-goal mark more often than not since breaking into Spurs’ first XI.\nThe good news for Kane is that he still has the opportunity to get his hands on silverware this season. Bayern are likely to put all of their eggs in the Champions League basket and the departing Tuchel has shown that he can coach a side to victory despite an otherwise disrupted season — leading Chelsea to their second European Cup in 2021 after replacing Frank Lampard in the January of that year.\nAdvertisement\nThe last time Arteta’s side faced Bayern in the Champions League, a 10-2 aggregate scoreline consigned Arsenal to six years in the wilderness from Europe’s top competition. Fast forward to the present day, and this clash is almost too tight to call, though you suspect Arteta will want his team to take a decent lead to Bavaria for the second leg.\nManchester City vs Real Madrid\nIf either side wants to set up a game plan for their upcoming opponents, they only need to look as far back as last May to uncover some clues.\nCity’s tie against Real Madrid is a repeat of last year’s semi-final, where a tight first leg was followed by a comprehensive 4-0 battering from City at the Etihad — arguably the best performance of their treble-winning campaign.\nBy the time Bernardo Silva scored the opener on 22 minutes, City had 81 per cent possession of the ball, suffocating Madrid with waves of attack that made their opponents seem more like relegation candidates than the competition’s reigning champions.\nMadrid’s 13 shots conceded in the first half was the joint-highest in the Champions League since Opta began collecting such data in 2003-04. Carlo Ancelotti’s men were under siege, and did little to prevent City’s comprehensive invasion of space.\nMakeshift left-back Eduardo Camavinga was regularly exposed on that May evening last year, but targeting Madrid’s left flank has been a tactic that many sides have attempted in La Liga this season.\nLooking at the opposition’s share of attacking touches spanned across each third, Madrid’s opponents have targeted their left side 41 per cent of the time. Not only is this the highest share across the pitch for Ancelotti’s men, but is also the highest share that any side has conceded on their left flank across Spain’s top division.\nAs Madrid’s predominant left-back this season, Ferland Mendy is defensively strong but lacks the requisite pace to recover if he is dragged out of position. With City’s creative cast including Bernardo Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden or the recently-switched Jeremy Doku from their own right flank, it’s worth keeping an eye on that side of the pitch across both legs.\nAdvertisement\nOf course, Madrid do have a player who happens to be particularly strong on the left side of attack, in case people needed reminding.\nAnyone who has the pace and directness of Vinicius Jr in their team would be foolish not to channel their attack down his side. Throw in a roaming Jude Bellingham — who will often drift over to link up with Vinicius — and City’s perceived confidence could be quickly undone by Madrid’s individual quality across their forward line.\nDespite being in the race for an unprecedented “double-treble”, City have not been as convincing as they were last season. With Pep Guardiola in constant search for control, the counterattacking threat that Vinicius, Bellingham, Rodrygo et al. offer will be enough to give him sleepless nights — no side has registered more direct attacks in the Champions League this season than Madrid’s 31.\nGuardiola versus Ancelotti. Control versus freedom. This match-up rarely disappoints.\nParis Saint-Germain vs Barcelona\nIt’s 2017 and one of the most enthralling ties in the history of the Champions League: La Remontada. PSG defeated Barcelona 4-0 in the first leg and, even with Barcelona 3-1 up going into the dying stages of the second leg it was still (a significant) advantage to the Parisians. But three goals from the 88th minute put Messi and Co. through in one of the competition’s greatest ever nights.\n15 – Paris will face Barcelona for the 14th and 15th time in European competition, making the Blaugrana the most frequent opponent PSG have faced on the continental stage. Habit. #UclDraw pic.twitter.com/t2QIIr3bbD\n— OptaJean (@OptaJean) March 15, 2024\nThe Barcelona head coach at that time? Luis Enrique, now head coach at PSG. It is his first game against Barcelona since leaving in summer 2017. If Luis Enrique’s PSG project has been a kind of a Barcelona-fication, making their build-up more fluid and incisive, and improving their pressing/counter-pressing, it was their tactical flexibility away to Real Sociedad that ensured they got through the round of 16 last month.\nLuis Enrique shifted from a 4-3-3 to a 4-3-1-2, playing Kylian Mbappe and Bradley Barcola as split strikers and dropping Ousmane Dembele — another former Barcelona player — deeper to combat La Real’s aggressive press. PSG struggled immensely in the first leg, being pressed into corners and requiring Dembele’s press resistance to get out.\nPSG are cantering to the Ligue 1 title and can take confidence from how tall they stood in their recent win in Le Classique away to Marseille. With centre-back Lucas Beraldo sent off in the first half, they defended resolutely. Goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made 10 saves, including a couple of spectacular reflex stops, the most by a PSG goalkeeper since Opta started collecting Ligue 1 data in 2006-07.\nAdvertisement\nTheir two goals on the counter-attack, flowing moves from their own half after regains, are a reminder of the direct speed and individual dribbling quality they possess, even without Mbappe on the field (Luis Enrique had substituted him after an hour). With Barcelona having struggled against Inter Milan’s counter-attacking in the Champions League last season, it will need their possession game to be accurate and counter-press perfect to prevent PSG hitting them on the break.\nGO DEEPER\nLigue 1: Why 'the league of talents' needs to become the league of European success\nBarcelona’s season has been rather confusing. After falling away in the title race and seeing manager Xavi announce his decision to leave following a 5-3 home defeat by Villarreal that left them fourth in La Liga, they have been unbeaten ever since.\nIt might not be enough to salvage an overall disappointing season but, like Bayern, Barcelona are another example of a team now willing to put all of their eggs in the European basket.\nBarca’s 3-1 victory over Napoli in the round of 16 was a neat exemplar of their attacking approach this season. In Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Joao Felix, they have the creativity and pace to stretch opposition defensive lines in wide areas — both vertically and horizontally.\nAt the same time, they can create via neat interchanges in central areas outside the opposition’s box, with 33-year-old Ilkay Gundogan leading Barcelona’s creative output this season.\nGO DEEPER\nIlkay Gundogan, Europe's most prolific creator\nGundogan’s 50 open-play chances created in La Liga is comfortably more than any other Barcelona player, with Joao Cancelo the next closest on 29. While these numbers are inflated by his greater minutes played this season, it highlights how much Gundogan has taken the mantle of chief creator for Xavi’s side.\nWhile Barcelona may not be the force they once were on the European stage, their late-season renaissance might spark a late charge in the Champions League, giving Xavi the ultimate opportunity to end his tenure on a positive note.\nAdvertisement\nAtletico Madrid vs Borussia Dortmund\nIf Atletico Madrid and Borussia Dortmund were looking for their best route to this year’s semi-final, they would have likely elected to be drawn against one another.\nNeither have been wholly convincing in their respective domestic leagues this season but if you had to hand the momentum to one side, then you would be more inclined to look towards Germany than Spain.\nAfter navigating an extremely difficult group containing PSG, AC Milan and Newcastle United, Dortmund’s 2-0 victory over PSV Eindhoven in the round of 16 made it nine home games unbeaten in the Champions League — their longest streak in the competition since 1999.\nBefore their 1-0 loss to Stuttgart at the weekend, Dortmund were on a five-game winning streak in all competitions with last month’s victory against Bayern Munich showing that they do still have the mettle to overcome tough opposition in the latter part of the season.\n“If we play like this, it will be difficult to beat us,” head coach Edin Terzic said after the game. “We showed our Champions League colours.”\nDortmund’s direct play was on show in their first goal against Tuchel’s side, with the pace of Karim Adeyemi able to exploit an unstructured Bayern defence.\nErst so: 💨\nDann so: 🚀\nUnd dann so: 😎 pic.twitter.com/2AvZFQ9w0E— Borussia Dortmund (@BVB) April 3, 2024\nAdeyemi has struggled for minutes this season but his goal was indicative of Dortmund’s strength, with the directness of Julian Brandt, Marco Reus, Donyell Malen and Jadon Sancho behind Niclas Fullkrug — their seven counter-attacking goals being the second-highest in the Bundesliga.\nAs you can see by both sides’ team playstyle below (full explainer here), Dortmund’s low “Patient attack” rating (41 out of 99) reflects their transitional approach where they are quick to shoot when progressing the ball into the final third.\nWhether or not Atleti will afford them the space to progress quickly through the heart of the pitch is another story. While Diego Simeone’s side have become more tactically fluid this season with their predominant 3-5-2 set-up, they are still built upon strong defensive foundations (Chance prevention, 76 out of 99) — rarely leaving space in behind for their opponents to exploit (High line, 9 out of 99).\nAdvertisement\nAtleti have been particularly strong at home this season and will be buoyed by their memorable penalty shootout victory over Inter Milan last month. However, they have struggled for consistency in recent weeks — with just four wins from 12 games in all competitions since the start of February.\nThe man they will look to most for a creative spark will be Antoine Griezmann, whose 26 goal contributions (19 goals and seven assists) leads the way for Atleti in all competitions.\nGriezmann’s delivery from set pieces is also a key threat — no-one has created more chances for Simeone’s side than his 55 in La Liga and the Champions League this season. In open play, only Rodrigo De Paul (39) edges ahead of the French playmaker (37).\nWhether it is long threaded through balls or neat, intricate passes, Griezmann has the ability to create something from anywhere and will undoubtedly have a say on proceedings across both legs.\nOf all the ties remaining in the last eight, this one might be the stodgiest for the neutral but the clash of styles will be tactically interesting.\nImportantly for Atletico, the first leg is at home. They have won 19 of 22 games at the Metropolitano this season, including all four Champions League ties by an aggregate score of 13-3. Real Madrid have lost there twice, once in the league and once in the Copa del Rey. When they get on top of opponents, with an intense press and a mixed attacking style — able to build-up, able to play direct — Atleti are hard to stop.\nAway from home, their form pales, with more league losses (seven) than wins (five). Their 2-1 win away to Villarreal at the start of April was their first such victory since late January, while they drew in Rome against Lazio and against Celtic in the Champions League group stages. Inter blew them away in the first leg, and if not for wasteful finishing could have had the tie out of sight. You sense that Atletico will need to make home advantage count in the first leg.\n(Header photos: Getty Images)",
