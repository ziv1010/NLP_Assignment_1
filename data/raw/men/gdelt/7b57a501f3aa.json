  "body_text": "Renee Slegers was sure to credit our entire squad for an impressive Champions League win against Juventus.\nSpeaking after the full-time whistle, our interim coach shared her delight at our variety of goalscorers as well as yet another clean sheet.\n\"We have four different goalscorers and the players up top are performing really well, but I don't want to take out the goalkeeper, our back four and our two sixes as well.\n\"We sometimes forget to highlight because the players up top are scoring the goals, but I think the goalkeepers and the back four - they have been doing really well now over time. I think the spaces Wally and Kim covered today in midfield - they've been brilliant.\n\"So I think the whole team today deserves credit, including the game-changers coming on tonight.\"\nJuventus posed a different challenge for our Gunners tonight, opting for man-for-man marking and a physical game.\n\"They play a different kind of football, which we haven't really faced yet this season. Coming here for an away game, the travelling and then this type of football, which is very intense from a psychological and physical perspective, I'm very proud of the girls and their performance. And obviously, very happy with the result!\"\n\"The players are always proud to represent the club, so they're happy to be in the group stage and play these European games. But then adding the fans, I could see them from here. We had a beautiful view.\n\"I could see them, I could hear them and I'm sure the players also heard them during the games. I think it's massive. I think it's so impressive how much they support us and I think it gives us a couple of extra percentages in the games, I really do.\"\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
