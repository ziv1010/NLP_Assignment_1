  "body_text": "One week ago, Luis Rubiales made his incendiary speech at the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) headquarters near Madrid.\nIn a 30-minute rant, he tried to justify his crotch grab in celebration of Spain’s Women’s World Cup final win, while in the VIP section of the stand just feet from his country’s queen and her young daughter, called his unsolicited kiss of the team’s forward Jenni Hermoso during the post-match presentation ceremony on the pitch a “consensual peck” and insisted “I will NOT resign” five times.\nAdvertisement\nOver the seven days since, world football’s governing body FIFA provisionally suspended him, Spain’s prosecutor’s office opened an investigation into whether he committed sexual assault and his mother went on hunger strike in her local church in protest at his treatment. And there are sure to be further developments as Rubiales and his supporters try to fight what he described in that speech as a “social assassination”.\nMany were shocked by the reception Rubiales was given before, during and after his speech.\nRead more: Spain manager defends applauding Rubiales’ speech: ‘I couldn’t control my emotions’\nMisa Rodriguez, Spain’s backup goalkeeper for the 1-0 victory over England in Sydney, highlighted that when replying to a post supporting Hermoso with: “Not to mention all those people who applauded.”\nY por no comentar lo de todas esas personas que aplaudieron🤮🤮\n— M1SA (@marisabelrr1) August 25, 2023\nSo who exactly were the major figures among those clapping his words, and what have they done, or said, since?\nNational team managers\nThe pictures of Spain women’s team boss Jorge Vilda and his men’s game counterpart Luis de la Fuente applauding Rubiales’ speech caused the most consternation. They were sitting in the front row next to Fede Vidal, manager of the country’s men’s futsal team, who also clapped enthusiastically throughout.\nRubiales directly addressed Vilda several times — including when promising to almost triple his salary on the spot — and praised De La Fuente for his role in June’s Nations League final win over Croatia.\nThe pair applauded when Rubiales claimed the narrative around the Hermoso kiss had been manufactured by media outlets “paying tribute to (La Liga president Javier) Tebas” and had been fanned by “false feminism, which is a great blot on this country”.\nAdvertisement\nLater on, Vilda and De la Fuente joined in the widespread clapping and continued to do so as Rubiales repeated he would not resign. They also showed their support when he directly addressed his daughters (who were sitting behind them) to tell them they were the “real feminists, and not of the ‘false feminism’ that’s out there”. Vilda and De la Fuente were among the first to rise in a standing ovation at the end of the speech.\nAfter FIFA suspended Rubiales the following day, however, both men rowed back on their support.\nDe la Fuente released a statement that day in which he expressed his “absolute repulsion in the face of any act of misogynistic violence”, adding that he “unreservedly censured the mistaken and out of place behaviour of the RFEF president”. The manager is expected to comment further on the issue today (Friday) at a press conference to announce his latest squad for European Championship qualifiers next week against Georgia and Cyprus.\nVilda put out his own statement later, saying Rubiales’ behaviour “absolutely does not reflect the principles and values that I defend”.\nYesterday, interim RFEF president Pedro Rocha said that De la Fuente’s job was “totally” safe but was more vague regarding Vilda’s future after reports that the Women’s World Cup winner would be sacked.\n“We can’t say that because we won’t meet with him until next week,” Rocha said. “Once we’ve met, obviously we’ll give the relevant news.”\nVidal, men’s futsal manager since 2018, has not publicly spoken since Rubiales’ speech. The Athletic has approached him for comment.\nSpain women’s coaching staff\nAlso in the front row at RFEF headquarters a week ago were various members of the victorious women’s side’s coaching staff, newly returned from Australia. The camera regularly panned to under-19s and under-20s coach Sonia Bermudez, senior-team assistant coach Montserrat Tome, technical analyst Ruben Jimenez Gomez, goalkeeping coach Carlos Sanchez, youth goalkeepers coach Elena Fernandez Castano and physical trainer Blanca Romero (shown from left to right in the screengrab below).\nThey did not always respond to Rubiales’ speech, with Fernandez Castano and Romero looking visibly awkward throughout. Only Sanchez applauded when he made his first reference to “false feminism” — Bermudez and Tome stared at the RFEF president. Jimenez Gomez and Fernandez Castano looked away.\nRubiales made another unexpected announcement when he said he wanted Tome to take over from Vilda as sporting director (he holds that role as well as being manager of the senior women’s side).\nAdvertisement\nAddressing the rest of the coaching staff, he said: “All the team, you already know that you’re going to renew and that we’re going to talk and that there’s going to be an economic improvement.” Sanchez was the first to rise in the front row as the standing ovation began before other members of staff slowly followed.\nNext day, 11 members of the women’s coaching staff released a joint statement in which they said they had been made to attend the assembly and that “various female members of the technical staff were obliged to put themselves in the first row, exposing their image and trying to suggest to society and players that they shared the RFEF president’s thesis”.\nThey expressed their “most firm and categorical condemnation” of Rubiales’ behaviour and said they “put their jobs at the disposal” of the RFEF.\nThe statement was signed by Tome, Romero, Sanchez, Jimenez Gomez, Bermudez and Fernandez Castano — along with assistants Javier Lerga and Eugenio Gonzalo Martin, physical trainer Javier Velazquez Diaz, youth technical analyst Javier Egido Saz and another of the youth setup’s goalkeeper coaches, Ander Ruiz Mitxelana.\nCOMUNICADO OFICIAL#SEACABÓ pic.twitter.com/MH6vg2Tl3Q\n— Sonia Bermúdez (@sbtribano) August 26, 2023\nRFEF directors and regional leaders\nRubiales praised the RFEF directors and regional leaders with him on stage, including a few by name.\n“The best of football is here,” he said, pointing to those sitting to his left, “these people who have trusted in me to be the president of the federation for these past five years, which is the biggest gift of my life.”\nThe assembly was chaired by RFEF general secretary and Rubiales ally Andreu Camps, who the president called on to negotiate with Vilda over his new deal. He also pointed out Rafa del Amo (first row, second right in the grab below), an RFEF vice-president and member of its women’s football committee, when underlining the increased investment in women’s football during his presidency.\nNot everybody on stage applauded when Rubiales made his surprise announcement about plans to extend Vilda’s contract and only six joined in with the standing ovation when the president returned to his seat — with Camps giving him a hug.\nDel Amo would resign from his position after the assembly on Friday, along with four other regional federation presidents.\nAdvertisement\n“I felt like he was stepping on me in a lot of things — for example, the message to Vilda or to Montse Tome,” Del Amo has subsequently said. “I was president of the national committee and he hadn’t consulted me about it, like he did on many occasions at the World Cup.”\nThere was a further twist when it emerged Camps sent a letter asking UEFA, European football’s governing body, to suspend the RFEF over government interference later that day — which would have meant Spanish clubs such as title holders Barcelona and Real Madrid being kicked out of the Champions League and the other two European competitions. He did this after the president of Spain’s High Sports Council said the country’s government had initiated procedures for Rubiales to give explanations before its Administrative Court of Sport.\nBut UEFA decided to take no action and on Monday the presidents of Spanish football’s regional and territorial federations urged Rochas to withdraw that letter, while calling on Rubiales to “immediately resign” over his “unacceptable behaviours” that “seriously damaged the image of Spanish football”.\nCould Rubiales, Camps and Vilda face further action from RFEF?\nSpeaking to reporters at the Champions League group-stage draw in Monaco yesterday, acting RFEF president Rocha was non-committal on the subject of what further action the federation might take against Rubiales.\n“We are very clear that the institution is above individuals. Unity and consensus is required,” he said. “We’re here to support our five Spanish teams (in the Champions League) because our image is very important. There is a lot in play. We have the World Cup (bid for co-hosting rights of the men’s tournament in 2030) in future.\n“I’m an institution man, the presidents have all backed me, and I have a duty to the RFEF. If there is no resignation (from Rubiales), then it’s just about working, working and working. We’ve navigated against the wind before, and now must do it again. We’ve made a great federation and must keep on.”\nHaving already called on Rubiales to resign, the RFEF’s regional presidents could next ask for a motion of censure against him, though sources close to the situation describe that as unlikely to happen any time soon.\nAdvertisement\nAnother option would be to elect a new permanent president quickly, by moving up elections currently scheduled for the second half of 2024. If the RFEF makes a request to the Spanish government, these could be held in the first half of next year.\nThe position of Vilda, who went into the World Cup unpopular among many of Spain’s best female players, does appear precarious. Further to Rocha’s quotes on the subject above, several regional RFEF presidents told The Athletic they expect him to be removed from his position in the coming days.\nAs for general secretary Camps, his fate seems unclear at the moment. It will depend on the will of RFEF members.\n(Top photo: Alex Grimm – FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images)",
