  "body_text": "Inter beat Empoli to keep pressure on Serie A leaders Napoli\nMILAN: Inter Milan kept in touch with Napoli after seeing off struggling Empoli 3-1 on Sunday and going three points behind the Serie A leaders.\nGoals in the second half from Lautaro Martinez, Denzel Dumfries and Marcus Thuram ensured a hard-fought win for champions Inter at the San Siro without their suspended coach Simone Inzaghi.\nNapoli have become the team to beat thanks to their thrilling 3-2 win at Atalanta, who are seven points off the pace in third, on Saturday but Inter also have a game in hand. However, Inter have a packed schedule due to their Champions League commitments while Napoli have no European football after their disastrous title defence last season.\nAs well as their final two league phase fixtures in the Champions League -- against Sparta Prague and Monaco in consecutive weeks -- Simone Inzaghi’s team have the Milan derby and trips to Juventus, Napoli and Atalanta between now and mid-March.\n“We barely have time to think because we’re always playing,” said Inzaghi’s assistant Massimiliano Farris to DAZN. “We’ve won 12 times and drawn three in our last 15 league matches and we’re in with a great chance of getting to the last 16 of the Champions League without having to go through the play-offs.”\nCaptain Martinez’s distance effort in the 55th minute took his league total to eight goals from 18 appearances, some way off the 24 he racked up on the way to guiding Inter to their 20th league title last term.\nThe Argentina striker hadn’t scored at home since early November before Wednesday’s 2-2 draw with Bologna but his goal against Empoli was his second in as many matches at the San Siro.\nDumfries’ thumping header, from Kristjan Asllani’s 79th-minute corner, was key as Inter were far from their best and once Inter loanee Sebastiano Esposito halved the deficit for 14th-placed Empoli in the 83rd minute a wave of worry swept the stadium.\nFans breathed a collective sign of relief six minutes later when Thuram swept in his 13th league goal of the campaign to seal the points and keep Inter’s title defence rolling on. Earlier, Lazio stayed in Serie A’s Champions League places after thumping struggling Verona 3-0.\nMarco Baroni’s Lazio went ahead with just a minute on the clock through Samuel Gigot, and further strikes from Boulaye Dia and captain Mattia Zaccagni put them fourth, two points above Juventus who beat AC Milan on Saturday.\nSunday’s success ended a three-match winless streak for Lazio, which included derby defeat to rivals Roma, and left Verona in the relegation zone. Verona slumped to their 14th defeat in 21 league fixtures in front of new chairman Italo Zanzi following the club’s acquisition by American private equity firm Presidio Investors on Wednesday.\n-\nPaul Anka Reveals How He Raised Son Ethan Differently From His Daughters\n-\n'A Very Special Visitor' Meets Queen Camilla At Clarence House\n-\nJodie Turner Smith Shares One Strict Rule She Follows As A Mom\n-\nHailey Bieber Reveals KEY To Balancing Motherhood With Career\n-\nPhoto Of Jay-Z, Other Prominent Figures With Jeffrey Epstein Proven To Be Fake\n-\nHillary Clinton's Munich Train Video Sparks Conspiracy Theories\n-\nFans Slam Talk Show Host For 'cringe' Behavior In Chris Hemsworth Interview\n-\nWoman Jailed Over False 'crime In Space' Claim Against NASA Astronaut\n-\nJames Van Der Beek’s Close Pal Reveals Family's Dire Need Of Donations\n-\nPrince William And Harry's Cousins Attend 'Wuthering Heights' Event\n-\nHailey Bieber Turns Heads Just Hours After Major Business Win\n-\nKing Charles' Andrew Decision Labelled 'long Overdue'\n-\nTimothee Chalamet 'forever Indebted' To Fan Over Kind Gesture\n-\nColumbia University Sacks Staff Over Epstein Partner's ‘backdoor’ Admission\n-\nOzzy Osbourne's Family Struggles Behind Closed Doors\n-\nDua Lipa Claims Long-distance Relationship 'never Stops Being Hard'",
