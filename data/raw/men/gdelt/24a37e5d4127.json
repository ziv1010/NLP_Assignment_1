The game is being shown on beIN Sports in Australia, which offers a free trial to new users. If you live in Australia but you're away from home, use a VPN to unblock the stream from anywhere. For full details on how to watch Liverpool vs Chelsea where you are, read on.\nLiverpool team: Kelleher, Robertson, Konate, Van Dijk, Bradley, Mac Allister, Endo, Gravenberch, Elliott, Gakpo, Diaz.\nSubs: Adrian, Gomez, Tsimikas, Clark, McConnell, Koumas, Danns, Quansah, Nyoni.\nChelsea team: Petrovic, Chilwell, Colwill, Disasi, Gusto, Caicedo, Fernandez, Palmer, Gallagher, Sterling, Jackson.\nSubs: Sanchez, Bettinelli, Chalobah, Gee, Gilchrist, Tauriainen, Madueke, Mudryk, Nkunku.\nLiverpool vs Chelsea: preview\nSomething barmy always happens when Liverpool and Chelsea meet in the EFL Cup final. Two years ago, Reds keeper Caoimhin Kelleher scored the winning penalty. Rewind another 17 years and the Blues nicked a thriller in extra-time (after John Arne Riise scored the fastest ever goal in a League Cup final, which Steven Gerrard cancelled out with a late clanger). You might want to buckle up for this one.\nIt's also a potentially career-defining game for Mauricio Pochettino, who's never won a trophy in England before. The Argentine, whose lack of silverware has long been used as a stick to beat him with, reached the Carabao Cup final once before, but fell short against Chelsea.\nJurgen Klopp's men dished out a 4-1 hiding when the teams met two weeks ago, but a lot has changed since then. Diogo Jota and Dominik Szoboszlai, two of the scorers on that day, have joined a lengthy Liverpool injury list, while Chelsea have found a bit of form, going three games unbeaten.\nIronically, it's an injury that seems to have turned the west London team's fortunes around. Thiago Silva's absence forced a reshuffle at the heart of defence, and the tweak appears to have been transformational. Could this be the launchpad for the entire Todd Boehly era, let alone their season?\nThe winning team will qualify for the playoff round of the Conference League, a prize that Chelsea fans would have sniffed at in seasons past, but would mean the world in current circumstances.
