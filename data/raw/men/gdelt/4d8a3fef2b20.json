And I’m really hoping they’ll get the reward for that come the final.”\nEchoing Postecoglou’s verdict, Tottenham midfielder Yves Bissouma said: “He’s like a dad or uncle for us. He’s always protecting us. Every game when we lose or win.\n“He’s got a top mentality. He understands football. He knows it’s up and down. He never blames players.”\nWhether that faith in Postecoglou will be enough to spare him from the axe is another matter entirely.\nIn an age of information overload, Sunrise is The Namibian’s morning briefing, delivered at 6h00 from Monday to Friday.
