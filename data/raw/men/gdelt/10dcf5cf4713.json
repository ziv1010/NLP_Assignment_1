It is a clash for pride, dominance and city supremacy.\nEvery time these two sides meet, emotions run high and the city divides into red and blue.\nFor the fans, this is more than a football match it is a festival of rivalry, passion and history.\nSupporters have already begun painting the streets of Blantyre with their team colors in preparation for what many expect to be an explosive encounter.\nWanderers head into the derby with their confidence sky-high after going 19 league matches unbeaten, a record that has reignited belief within the blue camp. Coach Bob Mpinganjira has transformed his side into serious title contenders this season.\nMeanwhile, Bullets, under coach Peter Mponda, will be out to prove their championship credentials.\nHaving lost three of their 20 league games, the People’s Team knows only a win can silence their critics and restore dominance over their age old rivals.\nThe two sides last met in the first round of the TNM Super League, where Wanderers triumphed 1-0 courtesy of a Blessings Mwalilino strike in the 11th minute. That loss still hurts Bullets and Sunday’s fixture offers the perfect opportunity for revenge.\nFootball pundits predict that both teams will go all out from the first whistle.\nFor Bullets, the spotlight will be on key players such as Chikumbutso Salima, Babatunde Adepoju, Paul Master, Peter Banda and captain Frank Willard, who are all expected to influence the game.\nOn the other hand, Wanderers will look to their reliable stars including Wisdom Mpinganjira, Blessings Mwalilino, Blessings Singini, Stanley Sanudi, Muhammad Sulumba and Thierry Sama to continue their fine run of form.\nFrom 2022 to 2025, the two sides have faced each other seven times. Bullets have won twice, Wanderers once, while four matches have ended in draws, showing how balanced and unpredictable this rivalry has become in recent years.\nOff the pitch, security has been tightened around Kamuzu Stadium to ensure fans enjoy the match in a safe environment.\nTicket sales for the match have been overwhelming with reports indicating that most stands were sold out by Friday afternoon.\nFootball lovers from across the country are expected to fill the stadium to capacity.\nIn another major football story, Malawi’s Silver Strikers are set for a crucial CAF Champions League return leg against Tanzanian giants Young Africans in Dar es Salaam.\nSilver carry a 1-0 advantage from the first leg and will be hoping to maintain their lead.\nThe Tanzanian club has confirmed that entry to the stadium will be free, as they aim to pack the venue with supporters to give their team an extra boost. It will be a high-pressure game for both sides.\nCoach Patrick Mabedi for Young Africas remains optimistic.\nHe has emphasized the importance of discipline and focus, saying his charges have prepared well to face the challenge despite Silver impressive home record.\nMeanwhile, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has announced the full list of referees and officials selected to prepare for the upcoming AFCON tournament.\nThe officials will undergo training in Cairo from November 8th to 13th.\nSurprisingly, no referee from Malawi has been included in the list, sparking disappointment among local football stakeholders who believe the country has capable officials deserving of recognition.\nOn the international scene, Lionel Messi has extended his stay with Inter Miami until 2028, signing what is expected to be the final contract of his glittering career. The deal also grants him equity in the club after retirement.\nMessi, who joined Inter Miami in 2023, has been the highest-paid player in Major League Soccer and continues to be the league’s main attraction. His leadership has inspired Miami to new heights both on and off the pitch.\nAt 41 years old by the time the contract ends, Messi’s decision means fans will continue to witness his brilliance for at least three more years.\nIt’s a fitting final chapter for a player who has defined football for two decades.\nIn Europe, OPTA’s AI-powered supercomputer has made bold predictions for the 2025/26 season, tipping Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal to win both the Premier League and the UEFA Champions League.\nIf the prediction comes true, it would be a historic double for the Gunners, ending years of near misses and marking one of the greatest seasons in the club’s modern history.",
