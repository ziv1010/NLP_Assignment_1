However, the reality is that £52m figure, just a couple of million more than Jorghino cost five years ago.\nGiving the background to the eventual agreed deal, The Telegraph say that their information is that when looking ahead to this transfer window, Eddie Howe and his recruitment team wanted a high quality midfield all rounder. Declan Rice was mentioned as a possible ideal signing BUT never considered a target due to what he would go for, that being proved with seemingly Arsenal now set to sign Rice for £100m+ and wages two to three times higher than Newcastle’s highest current earner.\nNo wonder the report says that their sources have told them that the recruitment team at Newcastle United are ‘giddy with excitement’ at landing a top class midfielder such as Sandro Tonali, for half the price of Declan Rice and far less than half the wages.\nThe Telegraph say that Inter Milan’s Nicolo Barella WAS also in the frame but that Inter were under no pressure to sell and that Barella’s wages could potentially be not far off Declan Rice’s at Arsenal, Barella three years older than Tonali at the age of 26.\nOn the other hand, AC Milan with financial pressures and thus a willingness to sell, once Newcastle United were willing to go to £50m+ for their star midfielder.\nThe newspaper paying tribute to how the Newcastle United recruitment team worked, in terms of keeping the move for Sandro Tonali quiet, until it was all but done.\nWith Eddie Howe wanting a number of new signings to help cope with the additional demands of the Champions League and retaining a top four spot in the Premier League, even better news that Sandro Tonali has been landed for considerably less than the Italian media… and AC Milan would want you to believe, as their fans are very unhappy with the sale.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
