I had that opportunity, too.\n‘Nevertheless, I’m happy. I’m at peace with my decisions.’\nIn the latter years of Wenger’s Arsenal reign, it became a running joke and something of a tradition amongst fans that Draxler should be linked with the club in seemingly every transfer window.\nPrefer us to the others?
