Paris FC was relegated from the top flight in 1974 and has only had one season there since, in 1978-79.\nRai and Bahrain\nIt is only in the last decade that it has become regular again in Ligue 2, and now it tops the table.\nIf PSG is associated with Qatar, Bahrain is the shirt sponsors of Paris FC.\nLevels of investment are nowhere near the scale of what has been seen at PSG, but Paris FC still spent upwards of one million euros ($1.087 million) before this season on striker Jean-Philippe Krasso from Red Star Belgrade.\nIt also signed former Marseille midfielder Maxime Lopez, who played in Serie A last season for Fiorentina, but appears unlikely to invest huge sums in the transfer market immediately.\n\"Contrary to some of the nonsense I have heard, we have absolutely no intention to spend big in the January window,\" sporting director Francois Ferracci told Le Parisien.\nWhile PSG attracts over 45,000 fans to the Parc des Princes and is considering building a bigger stadium, Paris FC's recent home games have drawn fewer than 6,000 spectators on average.\nThat is despite offering free admission to matches at the Stade Charlety, an unloved 20,000-capacity venue in southern Paris.\n\"If we could start to get 10-15,000 fans at every home game that would be huge,\" the team's coach, Stephane Gilli, said in an interview published by the club.\nThe longer-term ambitions are clearly far greater for a club who has a notable ambassador in the shape of former PSG and Brazil star Rai.\n\"I want Parisians to believe that Paris deserves at least two topflight clubs of a good level,\" Rai, who holds a small stake in Paris FC, told France Info radio earlier this year.\nAFP\nMost Popular\n- Guangdong beats Macao 2-0 in first leg of soccer cup\n- Para teams set to leave mark on ice\n- US skier Johnson wins women's downhill as Vonn crashes at Milan-Cortina Games\n- Su Yiming clinches first medal at Milano-Cortina\n- Over 300 athletes from 35 countries and regions kick off Asian championships in Tianjin\n- Legacy of Beijing 2022 lives on as Milan welcomes Games",
