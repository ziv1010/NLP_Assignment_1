(Barcola) has been diagnosed with a chronic injury to his right hamstring since Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League match against Atalanta (on September 17),\" the FFF said.\nPSG then publicly rejected the diagnosis of the 23-year-old by France's medical team.\n\"The information published in this statement does not correspond in any way to the medical information provided by Paris Saint-Germain's medical teams,\" the club posted on social media.\n\"Prior to the gathering (at Clairefontaine) and following the Ligue 1 matchday 7 fixture against Lille, Paris Saint-Germain provided the French national team with a medical report on Bradley Barcola that made no mention of any chronic injury following the match against Atalanta.\"\nThe attacker played 60 minutes of PSG's Ligue 1 draw at Lille on Sunday before being replaced, showing no apparent signs of injury during the encounter.\nShould Barcola end up facing time on the sidelines, he would be a further addition to PSG's lengthy injury list which already includes fellow France forwards Ousmane Dembele and Desire Doue, as well as Marquinhos, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Fabian Ruiz and Joao Neves.\nLast month there was friction between the two parties after PSG criticised the French national team staff following injuries suffered by Dembele and Doue during France's opening Group D win over Ukraine.\nLes Bleus are top of their group with two wins from two so far in qualifying. They host Azerbaijan on Friday at PSG's Parc des Princes stadium before travelling to Iceland three days later.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
