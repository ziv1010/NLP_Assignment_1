If it’s for the good of the game itself then everyone will agree with it.\n“There are so many avenues to explore and while it’s clear that money has to be filtered down the leagues, I don’t see why it needs a reconstruction to make that happen.\n“Clubs in the lower leagues needed help before the pandemic but Covid is causing havoc in sport and in lots of areas, not just in this country but around the world so something does have to be done or clubs will go out of business.”\nPhoto: TWTD\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nTheir offer might appear substantial and good, but it's anything but that, ( given the money awash 8n the PL), This is down to utter greed and big clubs looking out ONLY FOR THEMSELVES!\nF ck the lot of them!\nDon't let them compete in the domestic cups.\nPerhaps then we could go back to 4 leagues where promotion doesn't necessarily mean relegation at the 1st attempt and the dream of an unfancied club actually competing in the now disrespected F.A cup might become a reality.\nIf football becomes non competitive, with smaller clubs not having any hopes of reaching the big time, the game as we know it, ceases to exist.\nResponses along the lines of,\n\" Move with the times you bitter and twisted Ipswich supporting dinosaur \"\nWill be accepted.\nGood management, organisation, recruitment & smart tactics (yes even Graham Taylor's) being the reason for success in a relatively level playing field; where only the attendances, club shop & fan club subscriptions really determined any financial distinctions between rival clubs.\nI know it's a bygone era, but giving in to the power of this big 6 now will only further erode the competitiveness & romance of a sport which dares us to dream of what could be, from when we are small kids right up to when we are old gits.\nMany will remember Third Division North and South ; at the very least that conserved expenditure ,and almost certainly promoted localised patriotism and earnest competition .BUT in those days Greed , the Money go round , International exposure etc were not perhaps even thought about .\nSadly our game has deteriorated in many ways over the intervening period ; the business of entertainment has taken over , integrity and honesty and reliable sportsmanship have become largely bygones !\nALL these are good reasons not to allow panic decisions , in this pandemic, to shape the future– for its unlikely to be for the better !\nMake haste slowly !!\nCOYB\nIpswich were in the Prem on the very first day and made it for a second time, However I can't see us every getting there again.\nWonder if we would have the same views if had stayed in the Prem from the start.\nI hope so as I hope we have more integrity.\n1) Man U are ****\n2) Arsenal are ****\n3) Chelsea came third but were ****\n4) Leicester.\n5) It's just Man City v Liverpool.\n6) This season.\n7) Sheffield United almost managed to get a European spot.\n8) Leeds this season.\n9) Aston Villa this season.\nThe NFL may have its faults but st least every year the worst team gets to pick tge best young talent and thus gives each team a chance to shine.\nIronic that cultural appropriation is condemned everywhere, except when it involves the world taking and ruining English football culture...\n1) Change the Champions league to a knockout format played over two legs.\n2) Make the UEFA cup a knockout tournament again, and have no Champions League losers entering.\n3) Get rid of all mid-season friendlies and ban all friendlies outside of Europe apart from a short period of a week or so in late July/early August.\n4) Remove the clubs that qualified for European football from the League Cup\n5) Get rid of premier league clubs from the EFL trophy.\n6) Make all clubs 50% fan-owned\n7) Get rid of parachute payments and redistribute 25% of Premier League money\n8) Get rid of VAR.\n9) Bring back standing sections\nWhat these money men do not understand is what brought their cash cow into existence. It's the depth of the league system in England along with the passion of the fans and the place in the local communities for decades. Having no games on free to air TV has already shrunk the potential fan base. The Premier League needs MotD to stay relevant. Just look at F1. That was a big deal, obviously not so woven into the fabric of our culture as football, but it has become so irrelevant on Sky.\nFor the first time in my life I am thinking it might be time just to give up on football. If it stops being the game we love, and we can't fix the current system we should restart the league with a proper constitution that puts fans and community at the centre.\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
