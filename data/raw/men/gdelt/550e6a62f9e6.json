The club’s story is inseparable from the giants who have worn the armband.\nThink of Bryan Robson, Roy Keane, Nemanja Vidic, Eric Cantona, Gary Neville and Wayne Rooney – captains that didn’t just lead with unmistakable authority, but also set the tone for sustained eras of success.\nFernandes on his way out\nIn recent years, United have struggled to recapture the glory that almost seemed to be routine under the great Sir Alex Ferguson. Yet, amid the tough spells, one figure has repeatedly risen above the gloom and served as a reminder of what United should represent – Bruno Fernandes.\nA four-time Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year winner, Fernandes has offered undeniable echoes of the great United captains that preceded him.\nHowever, for all he has given, it now feels as though Fernandes is approaching the final chapter of his incredible United story. The summer was rife with rumours of a switch to the Saudi Pro League, although he himself put an end to the speculation by very publicly outlining his desire to continue at Old Trafford.\nBut, those rumours have refused to completely die down and there are even suggestions that European giants such as Bayern Munich could offer him a final opportunity to compete for football’s most prestigious honours in Bavaria.\nFor now, no deal is yet in place, although United cannot afford to wait. The club must now look ahead to a future without their tireless skipper. His loss would leave a considerable gap at the heart of the dressing room, but a logical successor is beginning to step forward – Matthijs de Ligt.\nDe Ligt is captain material\nDe Ligt experienced a somewhat uneven first season at United, yet he still managed to make an impressive 42 appearances in all competitions. Like many of his teammates, he found consistency difficult to maintain, and his progress was further affected by a handful of injury setbacks.\nThe idea was that with a season of English football under his belt, De Ligt would really hit his stride, and he’s more than living up to it, making his presence felt week in and week out.\nDe Ligt has started all nine of United’s Premier League matches, highlighting just how highly Ruben Amorim rates him. Nearly impeccable in performance, he has shown he can excel both on the right and at the heart of the three-man defence, rising to every challenge.\nThe Netherlands international has caught the eye with his aggressive and no-nonsense defending. Certain bits of play have earned him wild applause and cheers from supporters, who have taken notice of his stellar contributions.\nDe Ligt’s impact at United goes beyond his defensive solidity. His excellent composure and skill on the ball have greatly improved the team’s ability to play out from the back.\nAn imposing and vocal presence, De Ligt is unafraid to give instructions and demand standards from both his defensive partners and teammates across the pitch. Remarkably, he almost always commands a response.\nThough De Ligt’s leadership skills aren’t new, it’s satisfying to see them fully take shape in his performances at United. In March 2018, at just 18, De Ligt was handed the captain’s armband at his boyhood club Ajax – a big ask for someone so young, yet he rose to the challenge and carried out his responsibilities with exceptional precision.\nHe captained Ajax during their famous 2018/19 campaign, when they achieved the domestic double and reached the semi-final of the Champions League for the first time since 1997.\nWhen he arrived at Juventus, De Ligt openly expressed his desire to captain the Old Lady. Though he never formally assumed the role, his willingness to embrace leadership was evident. He was also a key player at Bayern Munich and was a regular in the team, forming a robust partnership with Dayot Upamecano.\nFor some time, leadership was a missing ingredient at United, and one of Fernandes’ most prominent qualities is how willingly he embraced that burden. It is a significant part of why supporters have connected with him so strongly. De Ligt possesses that same instinct to lead, which makes him a natural heir to Fernandes.\nDe Ligt’s perspective has always been centred on the team rather than individual glory – A quality that has always distinguished the great captains of United.\nIn a recent interview, he was asked about his drastic uptick in form, but in true De Ligt fashion, he quickly turned the question to be about the team and collective achievements.\nHe told club media, “I am happy with the way I started, personally. I feel good physically and mentally. I try to help the team as much as possible in every game.”\n“Obviously, we are not in the place where we want to be in the long term, but I feel like we are also improving as a team and, hopefully in the next weeks, we can get some good results.”\nDe Ligt carries all the hallmarks of a true United captain. He looks ready to take the mantle from Fernandes and drive United into a new era of ambition and success.\nUnited are back in action on Saturday when they go away to the City Ground to take on Sean Dyche’s Nottingham Forest.\nFeatured image Michael Regan via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
