  "body_text": "When Jota Silva arrived at Nottingham Forest last summer, there was an expectation it would take time for him to adapt and settle into his new environment.\nThe club were willing to be patient; to allow him the time to adjust to his new surroundings.\nAnd he has needed that. His work rate and energy have been ever-present, but there have also been times when he looked a little rough around the edges.\nAdvertisement\nBut now, eight months after his £5.9million ($7.8m at the current exchange rate) move from Vitoria Guimaraes in his native Portugal, Jota has evolved into a versatile, useful performer — and exactly the kind of player Forest will need more of, if they do find themselves competing on the European stage next season.\nIn recent weeks, the value of the forward has become more evident. Two goals in two away substitute appearances, against Ipswich Town and Aston Villa, led to Jota being given a starting chance at home last weekend when Everton came to the City Ground.\nWhile what followed was a flat, out-of-character performance from the entire team, it was the 25-year-old who came closest to scoring in the 1-0 defeat, with a near-post shot and a flicked header, even if both presented relatively straightforward saves for Jordan Pickford.\nWhen Anthony Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi are both fully fit, they will remain the first-choice players for the two wide positions in the 4-2-3-1 formation most regularly favoured by Nuno Espirito Santo. And when Chris Wood is fit, he is far and away the only realistic choice for the central striker’s role. If he is able to take the field, he will play.\nAll three men have been impressive; key players in a team who’ve climbed as high as third in the Premier League table this season, prompting dreams of Champions League qualification. But Jota can also be an influential figure in how they progress from here — particularly if they do secure the top-five finish they crave, and with it a place in European football’s elite competition.\nForest fans are well aware that European football has not yet been secured, with their team’s back-to-back defeats and better form elsewhere having prompted a sense of nervousness for the first time. Recent results have seen Newcastle United, Manchester City and Chelsea climb above them, pushing Nuno’s side, who are not in action again until a Monday night visit to Tottenham Hotspur, down to sixth, only ahead of Aston Villa on goal difference. With two points covering the five sides though, Forest will be back up to third with a win at Spurs.\nAdvertisement\nAs over half of the 20 Premier League clubs can potentially qualify for one of the three continental competitions next season, they have had to start planning for a first return to the European stage in three decades — since Frank Clark led Forest to the UEFA Cup (now Europa League) quarter-finals, where they lost 7-2 on aggregate to a Jurgen Klinsmann-inspired Bayern Munich.\nThe intention is to build a squad capable of competing on several fronts at once. And Jota, with his ability to operate in several different positions, is the kind of player who would prove useful in that scenario. Not somebody who might start every game, but a character Nuno knows he can trust when he does.\n“He’s a player who, because of his characteristics, can play all three positions up front with great quality,” says his former coach, Alvaro Pacheco, under whom Jota played at Vitoria Guimaraes. “At Vitoria, Jota was the team’s top scorer in the 2023-24 season. His great mobility, constant movement and creation of space in the final third make Jota a player who easily appears in finishing situations and can score with quality.”\nJota has scored three goals so far in five Premier League starts and 22 substitute appearances. His strike rate of 0.33 goals per 90 is bettered only by Wood (0.67) among those Forest players who have started more than one game this season.\n“Of course he is an option. He has always been an option. He has been involved in many games. It is up to us to achieve the best with each one of our players, so that they can contribute, when the opportunity is there for them,” said Nuno in a recent pre-match press conference, when asked about his countryman and Ramon Sosa, the Paraguay international who, like Jota, has needed time to settle into a new country, a new league and a new style of football after arriving in England last summer.\n“It is hard to come to the Premier League and quickly get used to it. It is a totally different game, particularly for those players you mention and where they came from (Sosa spent the previous two years playing in Argentina). There are so many things that are different. You do not get time on the ball, you do not get an opportunity for a break — there are no breaks. Players have to get used to that. Time always helps. They are doing well, they are progressing well.”\nAdvertisement\nIn the past, players such as Orel Mangala and Moussa Niakhate have thrived having had a season to acclimatise at Forest and the opportunity to find their feet.\nJota, who cuts a distinctive figure with his long hair and rolled-down socks, is not yet the finished article. But he came to the club with the kind of attitude that was always going to help him thrive.\nPacheco describes him as being one of the most resilient players he has ever met. Jota’s 11 goals last season helped Vitoria qualify for European football, in the Conference League. But the Premier League was always going to be a big step up for a player who made his debut in the Portuguese top flight only in 2022.\n“One of Jota’s main characteristics is his mentality,” says Pacheco. “He came from the lower divisions and fought hard to get to where he is. He’s taken every opportunity he’s been given to fight for his goal. There are no limits for him. He’s a fighter.”\nThat fight has taken him a long way in a short time.\nJota was still playing amateur football in his homeland five years ago, for Espinho, in the third division. By that stage, he had already overcome a broken leg while playing for his previous club, Sousense, another third-tier side. The injury was so serious, it prompted him to ponder giving up football completely.\nEven after earning a professional contract – with second-tier Leixoes, in 2020 – things still did not go to plan as he was released within a year. He joined another second-division side, Casa Pia, scoring 11 goals in 2021-22 to help them win promotion to the top-flight Primeira Liga for the first time in 83 years.\nThat success earned him an opportunity with Vitoria. It was there that he became such a useful asset for Pacheco, who believes Jota’s drive will help Forest secure their dreams of Champions League football over their remaining six Premier League games.\n“I have no doubt that it will be another goal for him to achieve and, if called upon to help the team, he will give 200 per cent,” says Pacheco. “He doesn’t know how to do it differently. I wish him success.”\n(Top photo: Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images)",
