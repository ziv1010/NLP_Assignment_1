Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nOnana missed the entirety of pre-season with a hamstring injury but is believed to be fit for Sunday’s mouth-watering clash with Arsenal.\nAlready under pressure at the club, Onana has suffered another blow after being named the ‘worst signing in Manchester United’s history’ by sports broadcaster Richard Keys.\nDiscussing PSG’s reported £25m asking price for Donnarumma, Andy Gray said on beIN SPORTS: ‘It depends on what a manager wants and needs. But is he worth £25m? Absolutely.\n‘He’s worth that to anyone who needs a proper goalie. Hold on, what did Andre Onana cost Man United? What did he cost?’\nKeys then said: ‘Well, too much. Quite simply the worst buy in Manchester United’s history, bearing in mind they gave away a world-class keeper [David de Gea] to sign him.’\nTurning the conversation back to Donnarumma, who is set to leave Paris after being replaced by the French champions, Gray added: ‘He’s 26, probably not even in his prime yet.\n‘But he’s already got a vast amount of experience, won the Champions League with PSG and the Euros with Italy.\n‘Somebody will surely take him. £25m is nothing these days, it’s nothing. A goalkeeper with his pedigree will not be sitting on the bench for long.’\nFormer Sky Sports presenter Keys, meanwhile, also revealed his doubts over Manchester United’s three summer signings.\nRichard Keys has doubts over Man Utd summer signings\n‘From bust at Christmas according to Jim Ratcliffe to a massive spend this summer,’ he said.\n‘Not sure about him (pointing to Benjamin Sesko). We said Mbeumo would get a decent club and he has but 75m euros? He’s had one season, he’s had one good season.’\nRaising Cunha as another unconvincing signing, Keys said: ’75m euros for a party boy.’\nMore Trending\nBut former Scotland striker Gray defended Manchester United’s summer transfer business, saying: ‘Those three players are miles better than what they had last year, miles better.\n‘I don’t see any reason why they shouldn’t get a bucket load of goals between them, but it depends what happens at the other end of the pitch.’\nManchester United finished just 15th in the Premier League last season, 24 points outside the Champions League places.\nTheir first opponents Arsenal, meanwhile, finished second for the third season in a row while reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Wayne Rooney sends message to Liverpool over Alexander Isak transfer\nMORE: Chelsea hit stumbling block in bid to sign Alejandro Garnacho from Manchester United\nMORE: Manchester United match abandoned after horror injury as club give update",
