That was certainly the case for me.\nAdvertisement\n“I will never forget standing on the touchline of Old Trafford waiting to come on for my debut. That feeling of pride will live with me forever.\n“The time is right to go and take on a new challenge. It is one that I cannot wait for and I cannot wait to get started.\n“I will always be a United fan and I will always love this football club.”\nManchester-born Iqbal came through the United academy and signed his first professional contract in April 2021.\nHe made his first-team debut later that year as a late substitute in a Champions League match against Young Boys.\nDespite being named in the matchday squad on 17 occasions in the 2022-23 season, Iqbal did not make a first-teamappearance under Erik ten Hag.\nUtrecht finished seventh in last season’s Eredivisie.\nGO DEEPER\nU21 Euros scouting report, part 2: A Dutch stroller, Croatia's No 10 and a Liverpool keeper\n(Photo: Manchester United/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
