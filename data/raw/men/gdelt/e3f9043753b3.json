Both teams have had decent starts to the season if you go by the table, but dig a little deeper and there are a few murmurings of discontent around Arsenal and United.\nFor the former, there is bemusement at the absence of Gabriel Magalhaes up to now after his consistent performances last term. There are question marks over Thomas Partey at right-back, and Kai Havertz is already attracting criticism from supporters.\nAs for United, they are yet to play well over 90 minutes this season. Erik ten Hag's team were extremely fortunate to beat Wolves in gameweek one. They then lost 2-0 to Tottenham and went 2-0 down to Nottingham Forest last weekend, only to fight back to win 3-2.\nQuestions will be asked of the loser of this game, then, so the stakes are pretty high for an early-season encounter.\nLooking for an Arsenal vs Manchester United live stream?

See below for international broadcast options.\nVPN guide\nUse a VPN to watch Premier League football from outside your country\nIf you’re out of the country for a Premier League fixture, then you won't be able to watch on your domestic streaming service as usual. The broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!) and blocks you from watching it. You can use a VPN to get around that, though, without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and will let you watch. And all the info going between is entirely encrypted, anonymous and safe – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there. For the Premier League, FourFourTwo currently recommends:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS5 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price. Go get it!\nInternational Premier League TV rights\n• UK: Sky Sports and TNT Sports are the two main players, but Amazon also have a slice of the pie in 2023/24.\n• USA: NBC Sports Group are the Premier League rights holders, with the Peacock Premium streaming platform showing all 380 games in the season. A fuboTV subscription also lets you watch every game.\n• Canada: The way to watch Premier League football in 2023/24 is fuboTV, which has exclusive rights to all the action.\n• Australia: Optus Sport will screen every game of the Premier League season.\n• New Zealand: Sky Sport are serving up all 380 games – plus various highlights and magazine shows throughout the week, as well as the Champions League.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nGreg Lea is a freelance football journalist who's filled in wherever FourFourTwo needs him since 2014.
