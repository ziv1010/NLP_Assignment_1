  "body_text": "By now you’ve probably read Ange Postecoglou’s comments in his post-match press conference after Tottenham Hotspur’s 0-2 home loss to Manchester City. You probably already have an opinion about them one way or another, or about the “Spurphie’s Choice” put in front of Tottenham fans over the past two days.\nEverything’s fine.\nSeriously. It’s all fine. Time to move on.\nThe background to everything that happened yesterday was, ironically, mostly external to Tottenham and the way the club has conducted its business over the past season. Spurs, through a quirk of fate and Premier League scheduling crunches, was put into a practically once-in-a-lifetime situation where winning a football match would essentially hand the Premier League title to Arsenal, Spurs’ arch-rivals. As such, Tottenham fans were embroiled in a nightmare of the soul over the past two days, forced to confront the harsh reality that, for one match, success would mean giving prolonged joy to its most hated of neighbors. What’s more important — Tottenham’s success, or intensely directed schadenfreude towards Arsenal? What’s a Spurs fan to do?\nFaced with such an agonizing choice, the fanbase has been forcibly ripped in two. Well, actually I’d argue three: one (small) part that was actively calling for Tottenham to lose this match, some going as far as to demand Ange throw the match or put out the U21s against the three-time defending champions. Another (small) part that can’t fathom ever hoping Tottenham loses a football match in any circumstances. And a third (a likely majority) that is deeply conflicted and hurting.\nThe first two groups are the ones most likely to chide everyone else for not believing the way they do, but I’d argue that third group comprises the majority of the fanbase, especially match-going fans at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tuesday. For those fans, and I count myself among them, they loathe the idea of purposefully throwing games. They want the team to fight against a superior opponent, to try and win, to do their best, but in the end if the team happened to lose... well, there’s a pretty significant silver lining in that cloud, right? It’s the exceedingly rare time when Fuck Arsenal ever-so-slightly outweighs Come On You Spurs. That conflict directly contributed to an especially weird atmosphere in the stadium that you could even pick up on the TV coverage — each kick of the ball, Guglielmo Vicario save, or missed Son Heung-Min sitter contributed to the English football stadium crowd equivalent of the Larry David meme.\nThose divisions I just outlined are pretty simplistic. It’s not as though Spurs didn’t have something to play for — Champions League qualification was at least mathematically on the line, and Spurs needed one point from the City and Sheffield United matches to clinch Europa League next season. There’s also quite clearly a big divide, as evidenced by the... let’s call it “robust” discussion on this blog yesterday, between British fans and American/foreign fans on this issue, with British fans more likely to be affected by 20 years of Arsenal dominance and the psyche-damaging banter that went along with that period. That’s a cultural issue as much as anything, something I’d love to see delved into more, but I’ll leave it to the social psychologists and academics writing dissertations on sports tribalism.\nBut here’s the thing — none, and I mean zero of any of the shit I just got done writing above means anything to Ange Postecoglou. Ange, upset after losing a hard-fought and frankly well-played match against the three-time defending champions, gave comments that appeared to call into question the motivation and commitment of some of Tottenham’s players and even the fanbase.\n“No, I think the last 48 hours has revealed to me that the foundations are fairly fragile mate. That’s just what I think. I just think the last 48 hours have revealed a fair bit to me. That’s alright. It just means I’ve got to go back to the drawing board with some things.\n“Outside, inside, everywhere. It’s been an interesting exercise. It’s just my observations mate. I’m not going to tell you, because it’s for me. I’m the one who’s got to do it. You can make your own assessments of what’s happened. I understand. I probably misread the situation as to what I think is important in your endeavour to become a winning team, but that’s ok. That’s why I’m here.\n“I’m just not interested mate. Maybe I’m out of step, but I just don’t care, I just want to win. I want to be successful at this football club, it’s why I was brought in. So what other people, how they want to feel, and what their priorities are, are of zero interest to me. I know what’s important to build a winning team, that’s what I need to concentrate on.\n“It is what it is. I can’t dictate what people do. [The fans] are allowed to express themselves any way they want. But yeah, when we’ve got late winners in games it’s because the crowd’s helped us.”\nHarsh words, to be fair. Ange wasn’t yelling while delivering these comments. He didn’t raise his voice. But it was perfectly clear that Big Ange is a guy who was seriously cheesed off by what he perceived as a failure to back the team, and by extension, his leadership of it.\nAnd why wouldn’t he be? Postecoglou, like most football managers, is motivated by the pursuit of success. It’s what drives him. It’s what has gotten him from obscurity in the A-League to one of the biggest clubs in world football. All season we’ve known that Postecoglou is uncompromising in his methods — he knows the style of football he wants to play, and he will work tirelessly to implement that style because he believes completely that it is a path towards success. For Postecoglou, success means winning. It means titles and trophy-lifts, and he doesn’t understand anyone who isn’t in step with that line of thinking. So what else was he going to say?\nI’m sure it didn’t help that Postecoglou spent a significant portion of yesterday’s match being heckled by a fan in the stands behind him (part of Group A, the Lose-The-Matchians) who was yelling at him to throw in the towel. Ange finally snapped and confronted the fan, which was caught on video.\nTo be clear, that fan was an asshole. Yelling at a hyper-competitive football manager to throw a match is never going to go over well and that incident probably contributed to the overall tenor of his press conference comments. Ange is on record in saying that Spurs fans can fan in whatever way they feel like, but I’m sure it feels very different to him when fans fan their fandom directly in his face by asking him to lose a football match so that Arsenal fans are sad.\nThe counterargument to this is, of course, that Ange bears some culpability for putting the team in this circumstance. Spurs have, after all, lost five of their last six matches, the significance of which is surely not lost on Postecoglou. I get the sense that his comments on the culture of the club is partially directed at his own team, and we may see the fruits of those comments borne out in the upcoming summer transfer window.\nSpeaking of the players, they too are driven to want to win, for similar (if slightly different) reasons. This is a team of professional athletes whose job is to play and win football matches. They’ve had the pursuit of success in this sport drilled into their brains from an extremely early age. Sure, perhaps there’s the rare footballer who can sympathize with the complicated emotions and rationalizations that come with being a fan of the sport, but in the end they’re not going out there to try and lose. I’d wager the majority of the players on Tottenham’s team, while cognizant of the Arsenal rivalry, don’t feel it in the same agonizingly visceral way that supporters do. This was a complicated situation, and players are not going to pull their punches because of the feelings of another fanbase. It’s not how they’re wired.\nSo we have three distinct groups of people involved here — the fans, the manager, and the players, and none of them are currently on the same page. What do we do about all this? How do we square this circle?\nIn short, we don’t. We can’t, and probably shouldn’t even try. Think of it this way — the circumstances swirling around yesterday’s match are exceedingly rare, a perfect storm of existential suck. And strangely, perhaps the best possible scenario came out of it — Spurs went out and played, honestly, a pretty fantastic match against an excellent Manchester City team. Ange put out a surprising team that displayed some pretty interesting tactical tweaks that may (or may not) inform how Spurs might play next season. Tottenham lost the match, not because they wanted to or because the fans demanded it of them, but because City are just flat-out a better team. Spurs missed out on Champions League qualification which they were extremely likely to do anyway after losing four out of their past five ahead of yesterday, and now only need a draw against the worst team in the league to finish fifth and play in the Europa League. Arsenal fans are sad.\nEverybody wins! By losing. I guess? Maybe?\nIn the end, I think Max Rushden has the best take on this whole situation, the one that most closely matches how I feel about the last 48 hours and the resulting Dark Night of the Hotspur.\nThat’s it. Football, and football fandom, is messy and ugly and complicated. There’s no right or wrong answer. Sometimes you encounter situations that you just have to endure, move past, and forget. That’s where Tottenham Hotspur and its fans are right now. The match is over. Let’s go out on Sunday, beat Sheffield United, buy and sell a bunch of players this summer, take a break, and forget this whole week ever happened.\nEverything’s fine.",
