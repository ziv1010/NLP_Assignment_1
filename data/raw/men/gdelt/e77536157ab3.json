But of greater interest in the report is the bombshell news regarding Sterling’s salary expectations.\nSterling pocketed around £325,000-a-week at Chelsea, and in an indication he’s now putting total emphasis on securing a move that’s right for him and not his bank account, it’s claimed he’ll accept the mother of all pay-cuts.\nThe Mail stated Sterling ‘is ready to play for less than a third of the salary he was earning at Stamford Bridge and wants to get straight back into the game.’\nThe report later doubled down on that claim, adding Sterling is ‘no longer expecting a six-figure weekly salary.’\nThat revelation makes taking a punt on Sterling much less of a gamble for interested sides like Spurs.\nHowever, Spurs are by no means the only club sniffing around, with The Mail naming Napoli and Juventus as being among his admirers.\nTEAMtalk understands West Ham, Fulham and Crystal Palace have all weighed up a move too, and could all satisfy Sterling’s desire to remain in the capital.\nOf course, Tottenham too can meet that requirement and of those four London sides, they’re by far the highest profile club and the only one who can offer Champions League football.\nIn the event Tottenham were to snap Sterling up, the way could be paved for one of Randal Kolo Muani or Mathys Tel to have their loan spells cut short…\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?
