Two teams advance from each group, leading to a knockout stage from the round of 16 through to the final.\nPUSHBACK\nA new expanded competition has sparked concerns over the demands on players in an increasingly congested match calendar, which will include an expanded 48-team World Cup from 2026.\nPlans to stage it in 2025 means three straight years of major competitions during the usual offseason, given the European Championship and Copa America are being held this summer and the next World Cup is in 2026.\nFIFA has previously said the dates would be \"harmoniously aligned with the international match calendar\" to ensure sufficient rest for players ahead of the start of domestic leagues.\nFIFPRO has become increasingly concerned about the physical and mental health of players in the face of growing demands.\nLast season, Manchester United and Portugal midfielder Bruno Fernandes made 70 appearances for club and country, including a run of 20 consecutive games as a result of the World Cup in Qatar being staged midway through the campaign.\nManchester City and Spain midfielder Rodri played in 10 different competitions.\nThere have been claims that such demands could lead to burnout, injuries and the premature curtailing of careers.\nDEMANDS\nFIFPRO and the WLA are demanding the international calendar, which FIFA controls, gets \"immediately amended.\"\nAs well as rescheduling the Club World Cup, they want to reopen discussions on the release periods for players from 2024-30 and review the \"Intercontinental Cup,\" which is effectively a replacement for the old short-format Club World Cup staged at the end of the year.\nThe letter warns legal action against FIFA could be considered if the governing body doesn't comply.\n\"Leagues and players cannot simply be expected to 'adapt' to FIFA's decisions, which are driven by FIFA's business strategy. We have reached the point where this situation must immediately be addressed both from a procedural and substantive perspective,\" the letter said.\nConcerns will hardly be alleviated by European football's governing body UEFA changing the Champions League format from next season, with two additional games. The European Championship has also been expanded in recent years.\nOTHER REACTION\nLeading clubs in Europe have voiced their approval of the expanded Club World Cup.\nThe European Clubs Association said it was \"fantastic news for club football in general.\"",
