  "body_text": "Chelsea plan to conduct an investigation into Aston Villa’s claims that a bottle was tossed at their bench following the sides’ bad-tempered Premier League meeting on Saturday evening.\nVilla lay down another marker in this year’s compelling title race as they came from behind to secure a spirited 2-1 victory at Stamford Bridge – the club’s 11th straight win in all competitions.\nOllie Watkins proved to be the hero for the visitors, scoring twice off the bench after Joao Pedro had deservedly given Chelsea the lead towards the end of the first half.\nThe result ensured third-place Villa remain within three points of top-of-the-table Arsenal, who had edged out Brighton earlier in the day.\nIt leaves Chelsea languishing down in fifth, three points adrift of reigning champions Liverpool, who sit fourth after a gritty 2-1 win over rock-bottom Wolves.\nThe high-stakes nature of Saturday’s contest saw tempers simmer on several occasions across the 90 minutes in west London, with both sets of players aware of the game’s importance in the context of the title and Champions League qualification.\nHowever, tensions threatened to spill over as referee Stuart Attwell blew his whistle to signal full-time, with a plastic bottle thrown towards Villa’s bench, showering Unai Emery’s substitutes and staff in water.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nAccording to The Telegraph, a member of Villa’s staff appeared to signal that the missile had been hurled from the side of the Chelsea dugout – though this is yet to be confirmed at the time of writing.\nAn accumulation of five yellow cards meant Enzo Maresca was in the stands when the incident played out. The Italian was serving a one-match touchline ban and will return for Chelsea’s clash with Bournemouth on Tuesday.\nIt’s claimed Chelsea have vowed to cooperate fully with both Villa and the authorities, if necessary, to get to the bottom of where exactly the bottle was thrown from inside the stadium.\nThe report adds that it is likely CCTV footage will be checked for any potential clues.\nEmery did not directly address the bottle-throwing incident as he faced the media following the match, instead focussing on footballing matters after another statement win for his side.\nNot for the first time, the Spaniard insisted it was far too early to say whether Villa were among the genuine contenders for this year’s Premier League title.\nAsked if he believes Villa can lift the trophy, Emery replied: ‘Not really.\n‘I am feeling that we are competing for Europe, not competing in the league with Manchester City and Arsenal.\n‘We have played 18 matches and have 20 to play. Teams like Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United – we must compete with them. We must be consistent over 38 matches.’\nOn Tuesday, Emery will return to his former stomping ground for what promises to be an intriguing clash with league leaders Arsenal.\nMore Trending\n‘That match against Arsenal is very, very difficult. They are so strong in the Emirates,’ Emery said of Villa’s upcoming trip to north London.\n‘The next challenge is the biggest challenge we will face because they are the best team now in the Premier League and Champions League.\n‘But we have very good players and I try to set our demands high for everything.\n‘Each match is a challenge and to play away is more [of a challenge]. On Tuesday it is Arsenal, it is very difficult of course, but we are going to play with our personality and mentality. Of course, they are favourites to beat us.’\nCan Aston Villa win the title this season?\n-\nYes\n-\nNo\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Arsenal star could have won club the title against Brighton, says Paul Merson\nMORE: Ian Wright concerned with Arsenal ‘problem’ after Brighton win\nMORE: Wayne Rooney issues transfer warning to Manchester United after Newcastle win",
