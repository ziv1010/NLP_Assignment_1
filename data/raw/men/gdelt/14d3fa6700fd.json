The defender was sent off to add insult to injury, as Athletic fans howled in anger.\nFernandes rolled the penalty into the bottom right corner, sending Julen Agirrezabala the wrong way.\nAthletic coach Ernesto Valverde made a double substitution, trying to stem the bleeding, but his team shipped a third before half-time.\nUgarte’s clever backheel played Fernandes through on goal and he stroked home with ease.\nNoussair Mazraoui crashed a shot off the crossbar from the edge of the box as United almost grabbed a fourth before the break.\nNorwegian referee Espen Eskas and his colleagues were barracked by the home fans, seeing their aspirations to glory evaporate before their eyes.\nThey were further enraged, waving the white cards from the pre-match tifo to show their disgust, when Maroan Sannadi tumbled under pressure from Maguire as he ran towards goal but no foul was awarded.\nUnited largely controlled the game in the second half, with Casemiro and Fernandes making life hard for the 10-man hosts, but they could not add a fourth despite probing.\nThe second leg takes place next Thursday at Old Trafford, ahead of the final on May 21 against Tottenham or Bodo/Glimt.",
