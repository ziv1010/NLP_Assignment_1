While Spurs have been hugely disappointing this season, one of the few players who has impressed is the 19-year-old Sweden international midfielder.\nThe teenager officially moved to Spurs from Djurgarden last summer and has made 45 appearances in all competitions for the north London club so far this season, scoring one goal and providing four assists in the process.\nNot only has Bergvall impressed Tottenham fans with his combative nature in the middle of the park, but Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, too, has been singing his praises, describing him as an “unstoppable” player when “he has the ball and runs” in Goal in March 2025.\nTottenham are aware of how good a player Bergvall is and what he could become, and handed him a mammoth new contract this week that runs until 2031.\nSpurs head coach Ange Postecoglou subsequently noted that the youngster has made the most of the chances he has got this season, adding that he is among “a core group of young players here that hopefully we can build something from”.\nHowever, it has emerged that Spanish and European giants Madrid are still keen on the teenager and want to sign him.\nGiveMeSport has reported that Madrid have been tracking Bergvall and will continue to monitor him in the coming years despite his new deal with Tottenham.\nLast season’s LaLiga and Champions League winners ‘are adamant that Bergvall has a very high ceiling’, according to the report.\nLos Blancos are said to be ‘keen to enter negotiations with Tottenham further down the line even though the big development of him signing a new contract has resulted in them accepting that a move in the coming months is not on the cards’.\nBergvall could potentially be a heir to Luka Modric at Madrid. The Croatian midfielder is 39 now and is out of contract at Los Blancos at the end of the season.\nInterestingly, Madrid signed Modric from Tottenham in 2012 for £30million.\nREAD MORE 🔴 Final Alexander-Arnold decision ‘done and dusted’ as Liverpool, Real Madrid learn their fate\nBergvall stance on Tottenham amid Real Madrid interest\nThat Bergvall has only just signed a new contract with Tottenham shows that he is happy at the Premier League club.\nAfter putting pen to paper on the new contract, the midfielder told Tottenham’s official website: “I’m really excited and really grateful to everyone who has helped me and I’m excited for this journey to continue.\n“It’s a club with great ambitions, I’m really enjoying being here and playing for this amazing football club.”\nGiveMeSport has added that ‘Bergvall is fully committed to Tottenham after being rewarded with a new contract’.\nIt has been claimed that the Swedish star ‘has a desire to become an even more important member of the squad after being pleased with his personal growth over the course of the campaign’.\nBergvall is not the only Tottenham player that Madrid have their eyes on.\nTEAMtalk’s transfer correspondent, Fraser Fletcher, reported on March 28 that Madrid want to sign Argentina international central defender Cristian Romero from Spurs.\nLatest Real Madrid news: Liverpool bid, midfielder desire\nA top Manchester United target has made it clear that he wants to join Madrid, according to a well-connected source.\nOne of Madrid’s superstar forwards is ready to leave Los Blancos, claims a new report in the Spanish media.\nMeanwhile, Madrid are willing to offer £77million for a Liverpool superstar.",
