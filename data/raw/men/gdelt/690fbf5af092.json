I’m excited to work alongside her as we continue to build a world-class coaching culture that supports our athletes’ growth and prepares them to win at the highest level.”\nThe Americans dominated beach volleyball after the sport that was conceived on the coasts of Hawaii and California was added to the Olympic program in 1996, winning seven of the first 14 Olympic gold medals. But the haul has sputtered as the generation that included Ross and three-time gold medalists Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings aged out.\nThe U.S. women failed to medal in Paris for the first time since 2000; the American men have not medaled at all since 2008.\nUSA Volleyball said Ross will be based at the beach volleyball training center in Torrance, California, and work to improve the quality of coaching and training at all levels of the national team program.\n“April’s leadership and dedication to the sport are unmatched, and we are thrilled to have her in this new role,” USA Volleyball President and CEO John Speraw said. “She is a true champion and a mentor who understands the value of collaboration and developing the next generation of elite athletes. We are confident that her expertise will continue to elevate U.S. Beach Volleyball on the global stage, especially as we look ahead to LA 2028.”\nThe Associated Press contributed to this post\nMore sports, gear and tickets\n- Where to watch NBA Celebrity All-Star Game today free\n- How to buy tickets to NBA All-Star Weekend: Celebrity Game, Rising Stars Challenge, All-Star Saturday Night, NBA ASG\n- Where to watch USA women’s hockey game today free\n- 2026 Olympics: How to stream Canada men’s hockey game today live\n- Where to stream Olympic figure skating today live",
