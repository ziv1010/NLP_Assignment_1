It’s an incredible family. The president Nasser [Al-Khelaifi] is like a father to me. I also want to thank all the staff and the coach, who have been exceptional with me – he too is like a father – and all my team-mates.\n“We have practically won everything together. You supported me in the good and the difficult times. This individual trophy is one the team has won collectively.”\nIt caps off a sensational career revival for a player who had not scored double figures in a league campaign season since he was a teenager at Rennes.\nPSG manager Luis Enrique – who was named coach of the year – deserves huge credit for Dembele’s award because of a tactical switch in mid-December.\nHe moved Dembele from a wide right to centre-forward role against Lyon on 15 December, by which stage he had only scored five goals.\nHe hit 30 goals for PSG from that date onwards.\nDembele has finally shown the quality that persuaded Barcelona to pay an initial £96.8m, potentially rising to £135.5m, to sign him from Borussia Dortmund in 2017.\nHowever PSG – who were named team of the year at the 2025 Ballon d’Or awards – were the team who got the bargain by recruiting him for just £43.5m in 2023.\nDembele also scored twice in seven caps for France in 2024-25.\nHe is the sixth Frenchman to win the award and only the second of the 21st century after Karim Benzema in 2022.\nLamine Yamal, 18, finished second – and also won the Kopa Trophy for the best young player.\nFive of the top 10 players were part of the PSG team last season including Vitinha (third), Achraf Hakimi (sixth), Gianluigi Donnarumma (ninth) and Nuno Mendes (10th).\nLiverpool’s Mohamed Salah was fourth and Chelsea and England’s Cole Palmer finished eighth.\nLast year’s winner, Manchester City and Spain midfielder Rodri, did not make the shortlist this time after an injury-hit campaign.\nGyokeres wins top scorer trophy\nArsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres won the Gerd Muller Trophy, which is awarded to the top scoring player in 2024-25 in European football for club and country.\nThe 27-year-old scored 54 goals in 52 games for Portuguese club Sporting last season – and nine goals in six Nations League games for Sweden.\nHe joined Arsenal in a deal worth up to £64m in the summer.\nThe exact criteria for the award is not known, meaning the winner was uncertain before the ceremony even though it is factually based.\nLast season’s was shared between Bayern Munich’s Harry Kane and Real Madrid’s Kylian Mbappe (although for his time at PSG) – with 52 goals each.\nThe previous winners for the award which was launched in 2021 were Robert Lewandowski, twice, and Erling Haaland.\nLamine Yamal wins second Kopa Trophy\nLamine Yamal may have been disappointed not to win the Ballon d’Or, with rumours emerging hours before the event that he had won it.\nBut the Barcelona star did receive the Kopa Trophy, for the best player under the age of 21, for the second consecutive year.\nThe teenager is the first player to win it twice, although it was only created in 2018.\nHe helped Spain to win the domestic double last season of La Liga and the Copa del Rey.\nThe winger scored 18 goals – including netting in three different Clasicos – and made 21 assists in 55 games.\nAnd he also helped Spain to the Nations League final, where they lost on penalties to Portugal, after scoring twice in a memorable 5-4 semi-final win over Dembele’s France.\nLuis Enrique wins top manager award\nThe trophy for the best men’s coach in 2024-25, at club or international level, was Paris St-Germain’s Luis Enrique.\nThe 55-year-old Spaniard led PSG to their first Champions League trophy, to cap off a treble, despite losing star man Mbappe on a free transfer at the start of the season.\nThe ex-Barcelona man is only the second person, after Pep Guardiola, to win the treble with two different clubs.\nThe Socrates Award, which is a humanitarian one, went to the Xana Fundacion, which was set up by Luis Enrique’s family in memory of his daughter who died from bone cancer aged nine in 2019.\nIt is dedicated to providing comprehensive support to children and young people with life-threatening illnesses.\nLuis Enrique was not present because he was managing his team against Marseille.\nDonnarumma wins second Yashin trophy\nItaly goalkeeper Donnarumma, now at Manchester City, won the award for the best goalkeeper in 2024-25 for his performances at Paris St-Germain.\nThe 26-year-old kept 17 clean sheets in 47 games for the treble winners – before joining City for £26m on deadline day.\nLiverpool’s Alisson Becker finished second for the keeper award.\nDonnarumma also won the award in 2021 after being named player of the tournament at Euro 2020.\nAston Villa and Argentina’s Emiliano Martinez had won the award for the past two years – but finished eighth this time.",
