However, he has been dealing with lingering inflammation in his ankle, leading France manager Didier Deschamps and the Real Madrid medical staff to call him back to the team.\nMbappe now has 400 career goals, including 55 for France -- just two shy of Olivier Giroud's all-time national schoring record. He was scheduled to undergo scans on Friday, according to ESPN, and will miss France's game in Azerbaijan on Sunday.\nMeanwhile, Real Madrid's next match is against Elche on Nov. 23 before traveling to Athens to play against Olympiacos on Nov. 26 in a Champions League match.\nAlong with Mbappe, France released Eduardo Camavinga (hamstring) and Manu Kone (suspension) ahead of the team's final World Cup qualifier.\n--Field Level Media\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nFlip\nEmail\nGet a daily dose of Afghanistan Sun news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Afghanistan Sun.\nMore InformationLONDON, U.K.: The U.K. has stopped sharing some intelligence with the U.S. on suspected drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean following...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: Budget experts dismissed President Donald Trump's proposal to give Americans a US$2,000 tariff dividend, calling...\nLONDON/NEW YORK CITY: U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to sue the BBC over its editing of a 2021 speech he gave on the day...\nNEW DELHI, India: An explosion in a car near Delhi's historic Red Fort on November 10 killed nine people and injured at least 20 others,...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: President Donald Trump has granted pardons to Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and several other allies accused of trying...\nNEW DELHI, India: A dense grey haze blanketed New Delhi on November 10, choking the city's skyline and sending pollution levels soaring...\n(Photo credit: REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes) Kylian Mbappe has left his France squad and returned to Madrid to receive treatment for an...\nKyiv [Ukraine], November 14 (ANI): Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated he spoke with Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev,...\n(251114) -- ANKARA, Nov. 14, 2025 (Xinhua) -- People mourn during a funeral service for soldiers killed in a Turkish military cargo...\n(251114) -- TIANJIN, Nov. 14, 2025 (Xinhua) -- Contestants of Shaanxi Art Vocational College (Secondary Vocational Education Division)...\nKabul [Afghanistan], November 14 (ANI): The United Nations has reiterated the urgent need to remove all restrictions on women in Afghanistan,...\nBy Karunesh Kumar Dubai [UAE], November 14 (ANI): Afghanistan spin sensation Allah Ghazanfar praised Rohit Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah,...",
