When Stoke resumed league duties with a defeat at Everton four days later, he was omitted from the squad again. Within a week, he had left the club.\n“It’s almost like a Roy of the Rovers story,” Shay Given, a former Stoke team-mate, tells The Athletic. “One day you’re on the bench at Stevenage. Close your eyes and when you wake up you’re playing for Spain and signing for Real Madrid.”\nJoselu’s official unveiling as a Real Madrid player took place on Tuesday and he might just have to understand why some of his former Premier League colleagues have been surprised, to say the least, to see his career taking this unexpected route.\nNot just at Stoke, either. Joselu later had two seasons at Newcastle United, where he was often a peripheral figure and the fans seemed to prefer seeing fellow front man Aleksandar Mitrovic in the starting line-up. On one particularly dismal night for Joselu, there were cheers when the board went up to show he was being substituted.\nAll of which makes it even more perplexing, and uplifting in another sense, to see the sharp, upward trajectory in Joselu’s career at an age when most footballers would usually assume their best moments had been and gone.\nIn March this year, Spain were winning 1-0 against visitors Norway in a European Championship qualifier when Joselu, two days before his 33rd birthday, came on for his first senior cap, as an 81st-minute substitute. He was the oldest debutant for Spain since 2006 and, within three minutes, he had made it 2-0. His second goal of the night arrived a minute later.\nAdvertisement\n“Age doesn’t matter to me because I feel like a kid,” Joselu said afterwards. “I feel like an 18-year-old.”\nLast Sunday, he came off the bench again and scored again (in a penalty shootout) to help beat Croatia in the Nations League final and, within two days of that triumph, was at the Bernabeu to announce himself, emotionally, as a Madrid player, describing it as one of the happier days of his life.\nHe has been recruited to fill the void left by the departure of Karim Benzema – five-time Champions League winner, Ballon d’Or-winner, superstar – to Saudi Arabia, and these are the moments when it can feel like a trick of the imagination that Madrid’s new signing was once was the sixth or seventh-choice forward at Stoke City.\n“He wasn’t a regular starter,” says Given. “You’d probably look at similarities with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, who was at Stoke and, the next thing you know, he’s playing for Bayern Munich, challenging at the top of the Bundesliga as one of their star players.\n“It’s a remarkable turnaround (for Joselu) and you have to give him credit for sticking with it and believing in himself. It’s a long career, a journey, and a message to kids that if it doesn’t work out at one club there are always opportunities somewhere else.”\nElsewhere on The Athletic…\n- Is Saudi Arabia funding Chelsea?\n- Mbappe’s mother and the rise of one of football’s toughest dealmakers\nWhen Joselu arrived at Newcastle amid little fanfare in the summer of 2017, it felt like a reflection of the spending restrictions that had been imposed on Rafa Benitez, their manager at the time.\nMike Ashley, then Newcastle’s owner, had promised Benitez “every last penny” to improve his squad in the warm afterglow of promotion from the Championship as title winners.\nInstead, it became a tense summer at St James’ Park. Money was tight and Joselu’s availability at Stoke might not have been considered at all had it not been for Ashley blocking a loan deal for Chelsea’s 19-year-old Tammy Abraham.\nAdvertisement\n“At Newcastle, we were signing players for not very much money,” says Benitez. “It’s like when you buy a car. If you have big money, you can buy a very good brand. If you don’t have too much money, you buy a car that maybe can do the job but it’s not so spectacular and not so fast.”\nJoselu was neither spectacular nor fast, scoring seven times in 52 appearances (almost half of them as a substitute) during his two seasons at St James’ Park.\n“He was a very good price,” Benitez says. “It was £4million plus £1million (in add-ons) for a player who will work hard for the team. Then, little by little, what happened at Newcastle is that the fans were expecting more pace.\n“He was a good player for us and he had the potential to do well. He was good in the air and he can finish. But if you spend the kind of money we were spending, a lot of the time you have to play on the counter-attack. Then it was difficult for him, because of that lack of pace.”\nAlex Hurst, the editor of Newcastle fanzine True Faith, can recall “the rarest of magic days under Ashley”, early in that 2017-18 season, when Joselu scored on his full debut as Newcastle beat West Ham 3-0 at St James’ Park. It was, in fact, the opening goal of their first home game back in the Premier League.\nYet there were also times when the fans wanted someone more dynamic leading the team’s attack.\n“At West Brom away (that November), he was up against two giant centre-halves and got abuse from the away end all night, which was furiously chanting for ‘Mitro’ (Mitrovic, now a Premier League star at Fulham) as Joselu toiled and battled and ran and harried,” says Hurst.\n“He was jeered off (after 73 minutes, with Newcastle 2-1 down), which wasn’t our finest moment as a support. Then Mitro came on, barely moved, conceded possession and almost gave away a penalty. I think all those jeering him stopped after that because he was a fraction as talented as Mitro but gave everything. And now look who’s playing for Real Madrid.”\nAdvertisement\nBenitez’s analysis is that Mitrovic was “a very nice lad, but very emotional and perhaps too immature at this time”.\nAfter his post-Stevenage departure mentioned earlier, Joselu spent the rest of the previous season on loan from Stoke to Deportivo La Corona back home. His scoring record in that spell was unspectacular, with five in 20 league appearances (11 of them off the bench) for a team who finished 16th out of 20 in La Liga, five points clear of relegation. Yet Benitez knew he was getting a dependable, hard-working pro.\n“If you analyse him technically, he’s quite good,” Benitez says now. “I remember a training session (for Newcastle) in the stadium and he was scoring great goals with volleys. Technically, he’s good – both feet, passing and shooting. He’s good in the air. But I will say it again: our fans were expecting pace.\n“When you have technical ability and tactical understanding and put that with pace, then you cost £60million. We didn’t have anything like that. (Look at) The three strikers Newcastle have signed in the last few years since I left – Callum Wilson for £20million, Chris Wood for £25million and Alexander Isak for £60million. That’s the difference.\n“When we signed Joselu we were getting a good striker with the technical ability to do well. He can hold the ball, head the ball, pass the ball.\n“The reality is that you have to manage with the tools that you have. I think we did that well. How many other teams have gone from the Championship to the Premier League and finished 10th (in their first season up) without spending money? Not too many.\n“That was a great achievement — and Joselu played a big part in that.”\nAs Joselu posed for photographs with Florentino Perez, Real Madrid’s president, earlier this week it was inevitable the club’s new signing would be asked whether he thought his career had gone full circle.\nAdvertisement\nHe had, after all, played for Real Madrid’s B team, making two substitute appearances for their senior side in 2011, before leaving for German club Hoffenheim 11 years ago.\nHence a rather amusing scene at Stoke’s training ground one day when he was asked by a reporter from local newspaper the Stoke Sentinel to choose between Cristiano Ronaldo and then team-mate Jonathan Walters. “Both are incredible,” Joselu replied diplomatically. “Ronaldo is a hero while Walters is Superman.”\nAs for his own status, Joselu was often a substitute in his season and a bit under Hughes at Stoke, watching from the edges and finding it hard, at times, not to feel aggrieved by his lack of action.\nHe did play a key role (off the bench) in a memorable 4-3 win at Everton in December 2015, scoring an 80th-minute equaliser before Marko Arnautovic’s decisive stoppage-time penalty. Joselu was so excited he hugged the referee, Mark Clattenburg, for pointing to the spot.\nThat apart, however, regular Stoke watchers saw only sporadic glimpses of the talent that will see Joselu playing for the 14-time European Cup winners next season.\n“It’s remarkable that he has had this career-flowering so late in his career,” says Simon Lowe, a Stoke fan, writer and author. “In fact, I must admit that when I saw he had played for Spain – or rather, that a player with his name had played for Spain – I had to look him up to check it was the same player.\n“I thought he might have retired. But, yes, it was him and, oh my word, what a story, at the age of 33, to see him going back to Madrid.”\nLowe is the author of 12 books on Stoke, with the autobiography of John Rudge, the club’s former director of football, to follow later this year.\n“In a way, Joselu was slightly unfortunate,” he says. “He pitched up at Stoke as a back-up striker in the era that fans call, very fondly, our ‘Stokelona’ side. We had a front three of Bojan (Krkic), (Xherdan) Shaqiri and Arnautovic and that was a halcyon, golden period for the club.\nAdvertisement\n“We also had Jon Walters. We had Mame Biram Diouf, a former Manchester United and Blackburn striker. Peter Crouch was a Stoke player at the time. Peter Odemwingie, too. So Joselu was probably seventh choice in a richly talented squad. When he left, it was largely unnoticed. There was no animosity or blame towards him, but no one can quite believe what’s happening now.”\nThe transformation of Joselu’s career started to take shape after he left Newcastle to join Spain’s Alaves for £2million in 2019.\nJoselu reached double figures in each of his three years there, including 14 goals as they finished bottom of La Liga this time last year. “We have one of the best centre-forwards in Europe, and he’s getting even better.” Javi Calleja, then the Alaves manager, told Radio Marca.\nA move back to the top flight with Espanyol followed and, again, Joselu showed his ability to score goals in a struggling team. There were 16 of them in 34 league appearances, making 2022-23 the most prolific season of his career. Only two players – Frenchman Benzema and Barcelona’s Polish striker Robert Lewandowski – managed more, so he received the Zarra Trophy as the highest-scoring Spaniard in La Liga.\nAt 6ft 4in (1.92m), he won 174 aerial duels last season, the second-most in Spain’s top division. Nobody can say that Joselu was not the right size, or strong enough, for the Premier League.\n“He was good in the air,” Given says. “He wasn’t huge but he had a good spring and he was a good target man. I have good memories of him. He always wanted to join in with the banter.\n“Some foreign players come in and keep themselves to themselves. He was all-in, to be fair. He was a good player – it just didn’t work out for him at Stoke, for whatever reason. Maybe we, as a team, weren’t playing to his strengths.”\nSteve Sidwell, another former Stoke player, was another admirer. “I have to say he was one of the best finishers at Stoke. If you called up any of the lads from Stoke, they’d say he was unreal – left foot, right foot, any kind of finish in the air; honestly, frightening.”\nAdvertisement\nAnd yet, Joselu passed through the Premier League, supposedly in what should have been among the best years of his career, without making any real impact.\n“Again, I will say the Premier League is more difficult in terms of pace,” Benitez adds. “In Spain, if he’s an important player it’s because, technically, he’s capable of making the people around him play better. That’s the reason why he has been so important.”\nJoselu will wear the No 14 shirt for Madrid (previously filled by players including Casemiro, Raul, Guti, Luis Enrique, Gheorghe Hagi and Emilio Butragueno).\nIt’s a different kind of job satisfaction, you imagine, from that last involvement with Stoke, sitting on the bench for a League Cup tie against a fourth-division side in front of 3,363 people. And ex-Madrid boss Benitez, who is close to becoming the new manager of Celta Vigo, expects his former player to enjoy being part of Carlo Ancelotti’s side.\n“With a team like Real Madrid, who have so much possession and will be attacking all the time, he will be a threat in the air,” says Benitez. “He’s not a player who, if he is 40 metres behind, can run in behind the defenders and be faster than them. But if he’s close to the box he can score goals, for sure.”\n(Top photo: Antonio Villalba/Real Madrid via Getty Images)",
