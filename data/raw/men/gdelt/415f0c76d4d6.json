Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola, Fulham's Marco Silva, Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner and former Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino - now managing the United States - are among the other candidates to have been considered.\nSpurs said in a statement Postecoglou would be remembered for delivering \"one of the club's greatest moments\" in becoming only the third manager to win them a European trophy.\nBut they added they could not base their decision on \"emotions aligned to this triumph\" and felt a change was necessary after a \"review of performances\".\nTottenham finished fifth in Postecoglou's first season in charge before he kept his promise to provide silverware in his second year.\n\"The opportunity to lead one of England's historic football clubs and bring back the glory it deserves will live with me for a lifetime,\" he said in a statement.\n\"That night in Bilbao was the culmination of two years of hard work, dedication and unwavering belief in a dream.\"\nOf managers with 100 or more games in charge of the club, Postecoglou ranks seventh with a 46.5% win percentage from 101 matches in all competitions (47 wins, 15 draws and 39 losses).\nThe cracks the Europa League lustre could not hide\n- Published6 June 2025\n''The game is about glory' carries hollow sound at Tottenham'\n- Published6 June 2025\nFrank emerges as leading candidate - but who else in frame?\n- Published6 June 2025\nHow did we get here?\nTottenham's decision to sack the man who guided them to a first trophy since 2008 will divide opinion across their fanbase.\nHe becomes the fourth Spurs manager - after Jose Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo and Antonio Conte - to lose his job since Pochettino was sacked in November 2019, less than four months after taking them to the Champions League final.\nPostecoglou's reign began in spectacular fashion, despite the exit of the club's all-time leading scorer Harry Kane to Bayern Munich.\nSpurs set the pace in the early stages of the 2023-24 Premier League season by taking 26 points from their first 10 games, with former Australia boss Postecoglou winning three consecutive manager of the month awards.\nBut five defeats in their final seven matches cost them a spot in the Champions League 12 months ago, and things continued to unravel - Europe aside - in 2024-25.\nPostecoglou, who was initially praised for the attacking style he implemented, was forced to defend himself from criticism for sticking to his principles and had to contend with a catalogue of injuries to key players.\nAside from their run to the Carabao Cup semi-finals, where they were thrashed 4-0 by Liverpool after taking a slender one-goal lead to Anfield, they have struggled in domestic competition.\nSince 6 November 2023, Spurs have collected 78 points from 66 top-flight games - the 16th best record in the Premier League.\nThey scored 64 goals last season - as many as fourth-placed Chelsea, and more than Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest in sixth and seventh - but conceded 65, with only Wolves and the relegated trio of Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton shipping more.\nWhat did Postecoglou say?\nPostecoglou's unwavering belief in himself and his forthright - sometimes blunt - approach has been a feature of his spell at Tottenham.\nHe accused a reporter of discounting the impact of injuries on his side's results after a 6-3 home defeat by Liverpool, and repeatedly insisted he would not alter his style.\nPostecoglou also publicly described Timo Werner's performance as \"not acceptable\" after replacing him at half-time during a 1-1 Europa League draw at Rangers.\nThere were elements of that abrasiveness in a statement his representatives released after his sacking.\nPostecoglou said in the statement his overriding emotion as he looked back on his time at Tottenham was pride\n\"We have also laid foundations that mean this club should not have to wait 17 more years for their next success,\" he said.\n\"I have enormous faith in this group of players and know there is much more potential and growth in them.\"\nPostecoglou referred to his players as \"legends of this football club\", and also thanked his \"brilliant\" coaches and the Spurs fans, referring to them as the \"lifeblood of the club\".\n\"I know there were some difficult times but I always felt that they wanted me to succeed and that gave me all the motivation I needed to push on,\" he said.\nWhat did Tottenham say?\nIn their statement, Tottenham said they were \"extremely grateful\" to Postecoglou for his \"commitment and contribution\".\n\"Ange joined us from Celtic in the summer of 2023 and oversaw a period of change on the pitch, returning us to the attacking brand of football that has traditionally been associated with the club,\" they said.\nThe club acknowledged there were \"extenuating circumstances\" at times, but said it was \"crucial\" they were competitive in multiple competitions and a change in approach would \"give us the strongest chance for the coming season and beyond\".\n\"This has been one of the toughest decisions we have had to make and is not a decision that we have taken lightly, nor one we have rushed to conclude,\" the statement said.\n\"We have made what we believe is the right decision to give us the best chance of success going forward, not the easy decision.\"\nThe statement concluded by wishing Postecoglou well and saying he was \"always welcome\" at the club before adding news on the appointment of his successor would be announced \"in due course\".\n'You'll always be celebrated' - reaction\nEarlier this week defender Pedro Porro had backed Postecoglou saying he needed time and \"continuing would be good for the dressing room\".\nWriting on social media on Friday the 25-year-old Spain defender said: \"Thank you for everything, boss. I'll always be grateful for the way you led us, defended us, and kept us going through all the highs and lows.\n\"Above everything, you gave us one of the greatest moments in the club's history and for that, you'll always be celebrated.\"\nSpurs forward Richarlison added: \"Everyone who loves the Spurs will remember that Big Ange always bags trophies in his second season. We've made history! Cheers and good luck on your journey! I'll always be rooting for you.\"\nFormer England forward Chris Sutton told BBC Sport the sacking \"summed up modern football\".\n\"I am not saying it has been brilliant this season because I understand the league has been a disappointment - but he has won a major European trophy and that is a huge achievement,\" he said.\n\"To get someone in who wins them silverware, then straightaway get rid of him, that sums up modern football, doesn't it? It's absolutely bonkers.\"\nMatch of the Day pundit Alan Shearer reacted to the sacking by posting on X: \"What a stupid game football is!\"\nRelated topics\n- Published26 July 2022",
