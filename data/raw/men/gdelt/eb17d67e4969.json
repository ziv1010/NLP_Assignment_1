Things started brightly under the former midfielder when he took over following the sacking of now Club Brugge manager Scott Parker.\nBut things are starting to go sour, as they have just one win in their last six matches, the latest being a heavy 3-0 defeat to Manchester United in mid-week - meaning his odds have fallen to 16/1 from 20/1 - albeit he remains outside the top five likely to get the chop.\nBournemouth's Gary O'Neil (left) and Chelsea's Graham Potter (right) are also under pressure\nGraham Potter much like Nathan Jones is fairly new to his job, having only been appointed as Chelsea manager in September to replace Thomas Tuchel.\nBut it hasn't been a hugely promising start to life at Stamford Bridge, winning just four matches out of 11 in the Premier League and suffering some shock defeats to Aston Villa, Newcastle and Brighton.\nIt is unlikely that new owner Todd Boehly will axe his man yet after making such a statement by sacking Tuchel to bring the former Brighton & Hove Albion manager in and therefore he has remained at 16/1 for now.\nForest boss Cooper has moved out to odds of 20/1 after bagging up a 1-0 victory over Southampton in mid-week, a huge leap given he has been one of the favourites throughout most of the season.\nLeeds manager Jesse Marsch is another outside at 25/1 as they continue to flirt with the relegation zone.\nMost watched Sport videos\n- Disgusting drink act caught on camera at ICC T20 World Cup\n- Tiffany Salmond dazzles in red bikini at Bondi Icebergs\n- Team GB Winter Olympics hero: Matt Weston wins skeleton gold\n- IOC President in tears after Ukrainian athlete is kicked out\n- Viral Man United fan reacts to draw extending 493-day streak\n- NBA player makes long-awaited debut after battle with cancer\n- Team USA skier Breezy Johnson gets engaged after crash\n- Aussie snowboarder Scotty James shows off his dance moves\n- Super Bowl Champ wears Sam Darnold t-shirt with middle finger up\n- Has VAR broken football?
