  "body_text": "Islington-born Ellen Maggs had a short career with Arsenal but an incredibly storied one. The diminutive forward packed a lot into a career that started young but fizzled out by the time she was 23. Ellen has come full circle in a sense, having rekindled her association with Arsenal as a coach in the community in recent years.\n“I grew up in Highbury, Arsenal is my local team – there was no other team I could have supported.” Ellen beams. “I went to Canonbury Primary School in the 1990s and Arsenal used to come in and coach our PE sessions. That was where I was picked up and told I should be training with Vic Akers.\n“There was a ball court at Highbury behind the Clock End where I spent most of my childhood – the best place ever! At the age of nine I started training there every Friday. There weren’t really any girls teams in the younger age groups at that time, so I just trained with the boys teams in the ball courts. I also played for a boys' team locally.”\nMaggs enjoys a strong relationship with Arsenal in the Community today as a coach and that is reflected in her upbringing as an Arsenal player in the early 2000s. “When I was 15 or 16, Rachel Yankey was coaching me as a part of Arsenal in the Community because she was on a coaching course with them,” Maggs says.\n“I was training every single day and then when I left school, I went and did the exact same coaching course as Rachel. During that period, I got into the Arsenal team and then the England team and I think a lot of it was because I was coaching and I was training with boys every day.\n“Arsenal in the Community was really key for my career,” she adds. “Once I left that course, my career was never really the same. A lot of the people from that time are still there at Arsenal in the Community. They’ve stayed for years because it’s such a welcoming place to work. It’s a community in its own right.”\nMaggs was a precocious talent and broke into an all-conquering Arsenal squad replete with star names when she was still at school. “I started travelling for games when I was 14 or 15; I think I made my first team debut when I was 15.\n“I ended up in a lot of cup final squads where I hadn’t really played any other games, or I played the last game of the season when we won the league and I got a lot of medals that I don’t think I really earned. I remember giving them to the mascots because I thought, ‘One day I will earn this.’”\nEllen bided her time until London rivals Fulham launched a fully professional women’s team, enabling them to draw some big talent from north London in the process. “Marieanne Spacey left for Fulham and I was 18. This was while I was doing my Arsenal in the Community course and I was playing my best football, so that was when I got my chance and broke into the team.\n“I was training with Sian Williams, Faye White, Rachel Yankey, Jayne Ludlow and Ciara Grant. I had trained with them for many years and I felt comfortable after a few seasons of travelling around with Arsenal and England sitting on the bench.” Maggs, while still a teenager, became a key cog in the Arsenal attack and she won every domestic honour in English football wearing the red and white.\n“Beating Fulham in the FA Cup final in 2001 was a big memory, even though I only played a few minutes,” Maggs recalls. “I started the 2004 FA Cup final against Charlton, which we won 3-0. That was one of the first medals I really thought I earned.\n“But then I scored the winning goal against Fulham at Highbury to win the league title in 2004/ that has to be the biggest moment of my life, let alone my career.”\nMaggs soon became a fixture in the England squad. During this semi-pro era, being able to travel with England was not to be taken for granted. “We were very lucky that Vic Akers was able to get us jobs in the laundry at the training ground – it meant we had the time to go away with England.\n“A lot of people couldn’t travel to all the meet-ups because they couldn’t get the time off work. You would go away for a week every month in the build-up to Euro 2005 in England.\n“I was part of the first UEFA Champions League campaign with Arsenal in 2001. Back then, the group stage took place in one location in about five days, and that year we travelled to Switzerland. I just remember the trips were really, really good fun.\n“We had a really good group with unbelievable characters like Emma Byrne, Kirsty Pealling and Leanne Champ, and being together for a whole week was brilliant. We didn’t really want to come home! Then players like Kirsty, Champs, Alex Scott were all in the England squad too, so it was quite familiar.”\nHowever, Maggs’ priorities changed when she took on a mortgage. “We only trained twice a week and the rest of the time you had to squeeze your own training in. England would arrange gym access for you.\n“Trying to get all of that in and work was tough, especially when I left for Birmingham in 2004. I’d taken on a mortgage, so I needed to work full-time. I was working until 6.30pm and then trying to get to training.”\nDespite a stellar season in 2003/04, Maggs took the painful decision to leave the club. While the departure of Arsenal legend Spacey created room for her to become a first-team regular, the imminent return of another Arsenal legend felt ominous.\n“I had just had my best season, played the most games I had ever played, scored the most goals. But Kelly Smith was coming back from America and there was only one club she was going to come back to. I was worried about game time and Birmingham felt like a good option because they had big plans for the women’s team – but unfortunately they didn’t work out.”\nMaggs found it difficult to adjust when Birmingham’s plans did not materialise. “Rachel Yankey and Alex Scott came for one season but then left. I had the opportunity to come back to Arsenal at that point but was convinced by [manager] Marcus Bignot, Karen Carney and Laura Bassett to stay. My biggest mistake was not leaving Birmingham because Kelly did come back to Arsenal and she was amazing. I shouldn’t have stayed.”\nEllen says it wasn’t just the reality of working life that meant her career was winding down in her early twenties – there was an emotional reason too. “There’s no club like Arsenal. I went to New York for a bit, I went to Watford, but no one could come close to replicating what Arsenal do for you as a player and as a person. Everywhere I went, it just wasn’t Arsenal and I could never make it work.”\nMaggs effectively retired before another Gunners legend, Sian Williams, took over as manager of nearby Watford. “I had retired at the age of 22 – I was done. I couldn’t put enough time and effort into training to be the best I could be.\n“I couldn’t get back to those levels. But Sian took over at Watford and spoke to me. They were in the second tier and Sian felt I’d be able to play without training as much. She recommended for me and Laura Bassett to go and play for New York Magic too, so we went there for a year.”\nOnce retired, Maggs left the sport behind altogether, until family roped her back in. “I took ten years out, to be honest. I didn’t touch anything to do with football, be it coaching or playing. I couldn’t watch anyone else doing it either. But then my sister had a baby and she made it my responsibility to get my nephew playing football!\n“I took him along to some local sessions run by Ben Corbyn [son of former Labour leader Jeremy], who I knew from Arsenal in the Community. He was running the London Football School and asked me if I wanted to get back involved. I said I would love to run some girls-only coaching sessions.\n“We have a really strong relationship with Arsenal in the Community and a lot of their coaches come to us. We get them into paid work, so they get their education with Arsenal and then get jobs with us coaching in the community. This has landed in my lap really and I wouldn’t change it for anything.”\nMaggs is philosophical about her playing career and isn’t even convinced things would have turned out much differently in today’s more professional era. “Part of the reason I retired was not being able to train well enough, but the main reason I retired was because I wasn’t at Arsenal anymore.\n“I still don’t know if I would get past 22 in this day and age. The opportunities would be better and I wouldn’t have had to go to work and I would be able to train more, but I would only want to be at Arsenal.”\nEllen also reflects on a career that might have been short but was well decorated. “I played for Arsenal, I played for England, I won everything domestically and played in the original Champions League – I did a lot in a short space of time. I have a lot to be thankful for.” Lifelong Arsenal fan Maggs also formed a friendship with a familiar face at London Colney.\n“I was sponsored by Thierry Henry, but because I worked at the training ground, I saw him a lot. He would come in and talk to me about games and results he looked up. When we won the league in 2004 and I scored the winner in the final game, Thierry came into the laundry room and said, ‘I see my boots won us the league’ – and I had to tell him my goal was actually a header.”\nA five foot two forward whose crowning career moment was a header, breaking into our star-studded squad at 15 and retiring by the time she was 23, there was much about Maggs’ career that was remarkable.\nA Champions League “original”, she got her chance when a club legend departed and left when another returned. After a decade of estrangement with the game and the club she loves, Maggs has come full circle as a community coach in north London and proved that all roads lead home in the end.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
