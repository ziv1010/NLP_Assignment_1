  "body_text": "Real Madrid defender Eder Militao has withdrawn from the Brazil squad for their upcoming World Cup qualifiers due to a thigh injury.\nThe 26-year-old sustained the injury during training on Wednesday at the Athletico Paranaense Training Center.\nHe missed Brazil’s 1-0 win against Ecuador on Saturday and will be unavailable for the clash against Paraguay on September 11.\nAdvertisement\nThe Brazilian Football Federation (CBF) said: “Militao complained of muscle pain in his right thigh after training on Wednesday at the Athletico Paranaense Training Center.\n“The CBF medical department carried out a clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging on the athlete, which confirmed a small muscle injury in the right thigh.\n“The athlete was disqualified from the two Brazilian national team matches in the qualifiers. The CBF stands in solidarity with the athlete at this time and wishes him a speedy recovery.”\nThe defender is expected to be unavailable for 10 to 15 days, but Madrid are hopeful he will be ready to face either Real Sociedad on September 14 or Stuttgart in the Champions League on September 17. Madrid posted in a statement on Saturday that Militao “he has been diagnosed with a muscle injury due to overload in the rectus femoris of his right leg”.\nMilitao missed the majority of the 2023-24 campaign after suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in his left knee during Madrid’s opening game of last season.\nHe has started all five of Madrid’s games this season, keeping three clean sheets and picking up an assist in the 3-0 victory over Real Valladolid on August 25.\nMilitao’s Real Madrid team-mates Aurelien Tchouameni and Ferland Mendy both withdrew from the France squad due to injury issues and will miss their country’s Nations League matches against Italy on September 6 and Belgium on September 9.\nMidfielder Tchouameni left camp on Monday with a left foot issue and defender Mendy withdrew from the squad with a shin issue.\nGO DEEPER\n'Spain is not racist', says manager De la Fuente\n(Maciek Gudrymowicz/ISI Photos/Getty Images)",
