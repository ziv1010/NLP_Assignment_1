Miguel Almirón’s early opener, after Alexander Isak had been denied, was followed up when Dan Burn’s fierce header crossed the line. Sean Longstaff made it three after the restart from a tight angle and, while Lucas Hernández pulled one back, Fabian Schär’s screamer rounded off a fine victory.\nKey stat: Newcastle are unbeaten in eight UEFA group stage home matches (W6 D2) but Paris have won only three of 15 away games against English clubs.’\nAfter all the horrific nonsense of a decade and a half of Mike Ashley, I absolutely love it when now so often so many outsiders are talking about Eddie Howe and this Newcastle United team / squad in such a positive way.\nNewcastle fans finally allowed once again to have the pride back in their football club and as we all know, it is inextricably linked to the pride we have in our great City.\nUnited are back and everybody is talking about us, though not as the total joke we had become under the FCB.\nStats from BBC Sport:\nNewcastle 4 PSG 1 – Wednesday 4 October 8pm\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nAlmiron 17, Burn 39, Longstaff 50, Schar 90+1\nPSG:\nHernandez 56\n(Half-time stats in brackets)\nPossession was PSG 73% (69%) Newcastle 27% (31%)\nTotal shots were PSG 11 (4) Newcastle 12 (8)\nShots on target were PSG 2 (0) Newcastle 8 (4)\nCorners were PSG 8 (4) Newcastle 1 (1)\nNewcastle United:\nPope, Trippier, Lascelles, Schar, Burn, Longstaff, Bruno, Tonali (Anderson 65), Almiron (Murphy 71), Isak, Gordon (Targett 90+3)\nUNUSED SUBS:\nDubravka, Karius, Dummett, Hall, Livramento, L.Miley\n(A thing of beauty is a joy forever – Now, bring on the Germans!
