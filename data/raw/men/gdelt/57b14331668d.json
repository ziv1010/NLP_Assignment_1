The prior American record of just over 90,000 was set at the 1999 World Cup soccer final between the U.S. and China at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif.\nNebraska at Lincoln’s five-time NCAA champion team swept the match, beating the University of Nebraska at Omaha 3 to 0. The historic night showed that the women’s team can draw a bigger crowd than even the school’s football team, which holds a record attendance of 91,585 fans set in 2014, according to NBC Today. The women normally play in an 8,000-seat arena, where they have sold out 306 straight matches.\n“We took a chance by playing in Memorial Stadium, and to go for the record and break it … I don’t think anybody could have envisioned that when this whole thing started,” Nebraska coach John Cook told the Associated Press. “It feels like a great accomplishment for this sport called volleyball played by women. It’s a state treasure. We proved it.”",
