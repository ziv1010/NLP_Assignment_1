  "body_text": "Liam Rosenior accuses Arsenal of lacking ‘respect’ for Chelsea in warm-up\nBy Robert O'Connor, Press Association\nChelsea head coach Liam Rosenior admitted he lost his cool at Arsenal’s players over a lack of “respect” shown to his team ahead of Tuesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final second leg.\nSky Sports cameras captured the Blues boss in an angry exchange with the home team on the Emirates Stadium pitch before kick-off, accusing them of encroaching into Chelsea’s half.\nTeams typically take half of the pitch each to warm up in, and Rosenior unleashed a side of his character hitherto unseen during his time in charge to remonstrate with the Gunners over their lack of “etiquette.”\n“When you warm up you have your half and the other team have their half,” he said. “In that moment I didn’t think it was right where they were operating. They were affecting my lads’ warm-up.\n“So I asked them, maybe not politely, to make sure they stay in their half. I’m not here to have mind games, it’s just what I think is right and respectful.\n“There’s certain etiquette in football. I don’t have an issue with anyone at Arsenal. It was just in that moment I didn’t think that respect was shown to my team.”\nChelsea went on to lose 1-0 to a goal scored in the seventh minute of stoppage time by their former player Kai Havertz, sending Arsenal to Wembley with a 4-2 aggregate win.\nIt is not the first time that controversy has been stirred over the issue of pre-match warm-ups.\nFormer Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp would frequently stand on or near the halfway line close to where opposition teams were going through their paces and watch intently.\nCritics at the time accused him of attempting to intimidate the other team, but speaking at an event in January last year he clarified the reason behind the habit.\n“Actually I did it to understand the other team a little bit better,” said Klopp. “They thought I did it to intimidate them.”\nChelsea’s Carabao Cup exit has been the only setback of Rosenior’s first month in charge which has brought three wins out of three in the Premier League as well as direct progression to the last 16 of the Champions League.\nHis biggest challenge so far has been dealing with intense media interest in Cole Palmer. The team’s most creative player has been out of form this season and reports emerged in January that he was unsettled and favoured a return to his native Manchester.\nThere has also been the issue of fitness. His minutes have been carefully managed following a groin injury that caused him to miss a number of weeks before Christmas and he has been unable to string together a run of games.\nRosenior said both Palmer and Estevao are ready to play 90 minutes away at Wolves on Saturday, and added: “We have the very best medical team, the very best sports science team. We do many tests. We want to make sure these players can play at the level they need to play at to help us win.\n“In terms of Cole, there isn’t a timeframe where he’s going to be perfect in a month or two months, it’s just game to game.\n“He’s bought in, he’s been magnificent. He is maturing as a human being and he understands the bigger picture which is his career.”",
