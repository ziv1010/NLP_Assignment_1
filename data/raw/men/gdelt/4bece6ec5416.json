Karipidis’ proposed article offered no evidence of match-fixing. She alleged Marinakis had previously “sent a postal bomb to the bakery owned by the family of a Greek referee who refused to change a call during a game”.\nIt was, according to the lawsuit, part of an internationally orchestrated campaign against Marinakis alleging “serious criminal activity as well as other wrongdoing which strikes at the heart of his reputation for honesty and integrity, both professionally and personally”.\nIn a statement to The Athletic, Harow’s solicitor, Gerard Cukier, said: “The allegations made against Mr Harow and his company, Sheyaan Consulting, are absolutely denied. Mr Harow has unfortunately been caught up in a dispute between Mr Marinakis and Ms Karipidis. An application to set aside the proceedings against him and Sheyaan will be heard in the High Court on 31 October.”\nThe U.S. legal papers detail how, when Marinakis’ investigators set out to find who was responsible, the trail led them to a Texas-based digital marketing agency, Harris Media, that worked briefly with Donald Trump during the U.S. 2016 presidential election, as reported by the New York Times.\nAccording to Marinakis’ claim, further investigation revealed that Brian Ruddle, the agency’s director of political operations, was responsible for creating the @nottinghamff X account that put out more than 200 posts and stated, as one example, that Marinakis had been “banned for being part of a match-fixing ring in Greece”.\nMarinakis subsequently obtained a Texas state court disclosure order against Harris Media to identify who was behind a “coordinated, anonymous, media smear campaign”.\nAdvertisement\nIt was then that Marinakis allegedly found out Harris Media had received two wired payments linked to the campaign. Court records indicate one was for €29,950 (£25,000; $32,500) from Amani Swiss, a Cyprus-based company for whom Karipidis is the president and managing director, and her partner, Dimitris Messinezis, the sole shareholder. Another payment of $25,000 came from Sheyaan Consulting, an Israeli company for whom Harow is chief executive.\nMarinakis, who took ownership of Forest in 2017, is suing both companies in London’s High Court for libel and aggravated damages for conspiracy. The Greek shipping tycoon is also taking action against Karipidis as the “apparent ringleader” and Harow for his alleged involvement.\nMarinakis has always denied being involved in any criminality and, though he has been investigated in the past in connection to match-fixing and Noor One, he has never been sanctioned for any offence of that nature. In his claim, his lawyers say he has suffered “enormous anxiety and distress” over what he regards as outdated and discredited allegations and that he has also incurred financial losses that were put at £2.1million when his claim was lodged in April.\nCourt documents reveal that Marinakis’ lawyers “geo-blocked” the relevant YouTube channel, as well as taking action to bring down the website and X account that used language such as “our club” and “paid for by fans”, allegedly to disguise who was behind it.\nWhen Forest played Bournemouth on December 23 last year, a billboard van spent eight hours driving around Nottingham city centre, as well as the streets near the stadium, displaying the message “Why is Evangelos Marinakis on the Naughty List?” and directing people to go to the website to find out.\nTwo weeks later, Forest had an FA Cup tie at home to Blackpool. Another van did the same until Marinakis’ security staff stopped it on Pavilion Road, directly by the ground. The van showed a QR code linked to the website and a caricature of Marinakis that depicted him, in the words of his legal team, as an “evil and menacing figure”.\nAnyone going to the website would, according to Marinakis’ claim, have seen a timeline for the years 2011, 2014, 2015, 2021 and 2023 and tabs entitled “Organized crime”, “Drug Trafficker”, “Match Fixer”, “Sanctions Evader”, “Murderer?” and “Money Laundering”. Readers were encouraged to “Stand for Justice and a Corruption-Free Future in Football!” by signing up for updates.\nAdvertisement\nMarinakis, in turn, went to extraordinary lengths, via specialist lawyers and investigators, to find out who was responsible — and then bring the suspects before the courts.\nOne breakthrough came when Marinakis’ legal team made Twitter, as X was then known, the subject of a Norwich Pharmacal Order (NPO) — a disclosure order in England and Wales to allow information to be obtained from third parties who have knowingly or unknowingly been involved in wrongdoing.\nAnother NPO was made in January to Promogroup Ltd, the UK-based advertising agency that had supplied the van for the first billboard.\nThat led Marinakis’ investigators to Harris Media and, according to the U.S. court documents, helped to uncover a series of emails that, according to his litigation, placed Karipidis at the heart of the operation.\nIn the email chain filed with the U.S. court, entitled “Airplane banner” on December 18 last year, Ruddle appeared to explain to Karipidis and Harow that the weather in Nottingham was too bad for the plane to go up.\nThe Harris Media executive went on to say campaign adverts were being placed at 22 bus-stop locations in Nottingham and a van was ready “to drive around the stadium during the (Bournemouth) pre-game, the game and the post-game. We have an eight-hour slot… so we might as well use it all”. This, Ruddle added, was “well within our budget”.\nVincent Harris, the company’s founder and chief executive, appears to have been copied into the same email chain and also seemed disappointed about the bad weather disrupting plans for a plane banner. “I suggest we move forward,” Harris wrote, “and ‘worst case’ is we just really clobber him for the next home game!”\nHarris, a political strategist, was described by Bloomberg in 2014 as “the man who invented the Republican internet”. He was hired by Trump in 2016 but was reportedly let go after just a week. He was previously on Senator Rand Paul’s team and, according to Marinakis’ legal arguments, had a working arrangement with Harow via a number of initiatives, including Harris Media’s involvement in Netanyahu’s electoral campaign in 2015. The company has offices in Austin as well as Miami, Ohio and Tel Aviv.\n“Hi Vincent!” Karipidis replied, in broken English. “I can understand, the weather in Nottingham is very sh**ty all the time. From now on (it) will be every week like that so I suggest do not try again with these weather conditions if we are not sure. Better to the van and I believe we will have similar reactions! Please try what you think is better.”\nAdvertisement\nThe emails indicate that, on January 8, Karipidis emailed Harris Media for an update on “the plane and the bus stations”.\nWhat the lawsuit does not speculate upon is what may have motivated Karipidis to target Marinakis — if his allegations are correct — and why their working relationship had, it seems, become so acrimonious.\nHer brother, Theodore, is the owner of Aris, who are at the top of this season’s Greek Super League. Olympiacos are fourth in the table. The two men were once close allies, but that is understood to have changed dramatically over the past 18 months and Theodore is now seen as an ally of AEK Athens, one of Olympiacos’ main rivals.\nIrini, who doubles up as the chairperson of the Hellenic Trade Council, is said in the lawsuit to have sent Harris Media a list of 80 journalists and their organisations, as well as 16 X accounts, to “tag” with their anti-Marinakis posts.\nMarinakis, currently serving a five-match stadium ban for allegedly spitting towards a referee’s feet, is also seeking an injunction to ensure the relevant people do not make any more accusations about him.\n“The smear campaign was deliberately designed to conceal the identity and involvement of the co-conspirators, who anonymised the publications on various platforms and created the false impression that a grassroots, fan-led campaign group was funding the campaign,” says Scott in the court documents. “The known co-conspirators also hid any ties to the campaign by using various entities as conduits for payments and transactions.”\nApproached by The Athletic, Karipidis issued a no comment through her lawyers. She is, however, understood to be prepared to take on Marinakis in court and it is expected she and Harow will ask for the UK libel case to be struck out.\n(Top photo: Naomi Baker/Getty Images)",
