This season they have already let in 29 in 21 games.\nThe collapse of that defensive strength and worsening performances have led Xavi to walk away, he says to change a \"negative dynamic\" around the team he loves.\nDefensive woes\nSeveral factors have played into Barcelona's struggles at the back this season.\nPerhaps stung by criticism of his team's dutiful but drab performances, Xavi brought in full-back Joao Cancelo on loan to play a more attacking brand of football.\nLast season the defence featured three centre-backs -- Jules Kounde, playing on the right, Ronald Araujo and Andreas Christensen, with Alejandro Balde at left-back.\nThis season Xavi started with Balde and Cancelo and two centre-backs, foregoing stability for attacking thrust on the flanks.\nKounde had also tired of playing at right-back, often telling media he would prefer to play in the middle.\nVeteran holding midfielder Sergio Busquets departed at the end of last season, leaving a yawning chasm in the pivot role he made his own for 18 years.\n\"We have to find that player if we want to compete well next season -- it's the key,\" said Xavi in May.\nHowever Barcelona could not afford their prime targets and settled for former La Masia player Oriol Romeu, signed cheaply from neighbours Girona.\nRomeu struggled and Xavi dropped him, playing with an even more attacking line-up without a natural defensive midfielder.\nTenacious box-to-box player Gavi suffered a cruciate ligament injury in November, further damaging the team's capacity in that regard.\n\"We are playing with Pedri, (Ilkay) Gundogan and Frenkie (de Jong),\" said Xavi last week.\n\"Before we had Busquets and Gavi ... Busquets steals 20 to 30 balls for you, Gavi steals 20 to 30 balls.\"\nAnother injury to first-choice goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, vital last season, has contributed to the sharp increase in goals conceded.\nInaki Pena, standing in for the German, shipped 31 goals in 15 games.\nBarcelona have let in three goals this season within the first minute of matches, with concentration lacking.\nIn attack the team have struggled too -- Joao Felix has not convinced, while Robert Lewandowski, 35, looks his age.\nDespite Xavi's intentions, the team's performances have only sparkled on a handful of occasions across his two-year stint.\n\"We're lacking in both boxes,\" Xavi has said on various occasions, as excuses piled up along with points dropped.\nXavi left as a hero after winning the treble in his final season as a player in 2015.\nBarring a miracle in La Liga or an unlikely Champions League charge, his departure as coach will be far less triumphant.\n© 2024 AFP",
