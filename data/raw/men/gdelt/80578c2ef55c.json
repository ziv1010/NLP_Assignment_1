  "body_text": "Few men have influenced Welsh football as much as Brian Flynn.\nNot only did he nurture — or in the case of some England-born players, recruit — most of the team that went all the way to the Euro 2016 semi-finals in France, but the former midfielder also won 66 caps for his country, had a stint playing for Cardiff City and then helped rebuild two ailing clubs in Wrexham and Swansea City as manager.\nAdvertisement\nBut one major frustration remains when it comes to his beloved Wales. “Disappointment is my overriding emotion,” says this proud Port Talbot native to The Athletic about the summer of 2016 when Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey et al went further in a major tournament than any Welsh team in history.\nGO DEEPER\nWales' Euro 2016 magic: The stories you've not heard before, told by those who were there\n“We should have got to the final. Everything was in place to beat Portugal. They could have won it. Look, it was fantastic to do what they did and it did so much for Welsh football, but we should have got to the big one.”\nFlynn’s belief in the team that reached the last four comes from his stints as caretaker manager of the national team and eight years as intermediate team manager, starting in 2004, overseeing the under-21s, under-19s and under-17s, including one player in particular.\n“Gareth Bale is British football’s greatest football export,” he says. “I played with John Charles (former Leeds United and Juventus striker) once in a charity game. He was in his fifties by then but he was outstanding. What a player.\n“I never saw John in his heyday but I still say Gareth is Britain’s best export. Just look at his record. Five Champions Leagues with Real Madrid. How many Spanish league titles? (Three.) Plenty of others had their moments abroad, such as Gazza (Paul Gascoigne) and Gary Lineker, but nothing like Gareth.”\nFlynn’s pride at the career heights Bale reached is understandable. He played a key role in his early development and the later switch to a more attacking role that brought the world-record £85.1million ($107m) move to the Bernabeu in 2013.\n“My first training camp was the under-17s in Swansea,” says Flynn. “I’d watched the Victory Shield for the previous three years, so knew basically who was coming through. The thing is, Bale hadn’t been involved with the schoolboys. I did once ask why and he admitted, ‘I wasn’t good enough’.\nAdvertisement\n“Anyway, I did all my research, which included speaking to Malcolm Elias, Swansea-born but a Southampton scout. He said Gareth, 15 at the time, was worth a look. So, I invited him to the camp.\n“At this stage, (coaches) Dave (Williams) and Alan (Curtis) hadn’t seen him, either. But before long they both came over and said, ‘Who’s that kid over there?’. I told them, ‘He’s a left-back from Southampton — only, no way is he a left-back, first chance we get he’s going up front’.”\nBale’s under-21s debut came in May 2006 amid the unglamorous surrounds of Port Talbot’s Victoria Road, chosen by the manager due to his own roots in the town. “Gareth gives me stick about that to this day,” he laughs. “How he had to make his debut at an old League of Wales ground. I just say, ‘It’s the game that made you, Gareth — you’re made in Port Talbot’.”\nGO DEEPER\nBale's retirement is the end of a Wales era - his story will be told for generations\nDeployed up front, Bale caught the eye in a win over Cyprus. “Gareth’s heading ability was brilliant,” says Flynn. “And his pace was unbelievable. Perfect for playing up top.\n“When Gareth first joined the under-21s, I told him he’d never be a left-back under me because Joe Jacobson, a really good player who went on to have a good career with Wycombe, had nailed that position down. Seems crazy now but I remember telling Gareth, ‘You’re not better than Joe’.\n“Then I asked Gareth if he fancied playing up front. Suddenly, this big smile breaks out on his face.”\nWithin three weeks, Bale had made his senior international debut at the age of 16 years and 315 days. A £5million move to Tottenham Hotspur followed a year later, but it took some time to truly settle in north London, much to the puzzlement of Flynn.\n“There was this one time before an under-21s tournament when we trained at Tottenham,” he says. “I get there and see Joe Jordan, who was Harry Redknapp’s assistant.\nAdvertisement\n“Joe was an old team-mate of mine from Leeds. I knew him and Gareth weren’t getting on, so I says, ‘What’s this about you and Gareth?’. Joe replies, ‘Ah, it’s nothing, Brian’.\n“The thing is, Gareth was prone to staying down if he got tackled in training. We knew that. He just wasn’t the sort to bounce straight back up, instead, he needed an arm around him. A bit of cotton-wool treatment. But that’s not Joe’s style.\n“I said, ‘Have a look with Harry at this DVD’. He wanted to know what it was, but I said, ‘Watch it and let me know what you think’. A couple of days later, Joe comes up to me and just says, ‘Wow!’.\n“I’d given him the Cyprus game. Not long after that, Spurs started playing him left wing. Then Milan happened, with Gareth getting those three goals (in the Champions League against Inter) and his career took off. So, I’m claiming that one.”\nEarlier this year, Swansea celebrated the 10th anniversary since they won the League Cup. That Wembley triumph, still the club’s only major honour, came amid a seven-year run in the Premier League during which Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal were all beaten at the newly built Liberty Stadium.\nWithout one man’s influence a decade earlier, however, that golden era more than likely would never have happened. Flynn took charge in September 2002, with Swansea sitting rock bottom of the Football League. As the club had only recently been taken over by supporters, relegation would have been a crippling blow.\n“We had to change so much,” he recalls. “Me and Kevin (Reeves, assistant manager) went to Boston to watch them play. They got battered, were something like five points adrift and we took over the following day. I knew it was going to be a big job.”\nFlynn got to work quickly. Within a week, he’d drawn up a list of 10 players who could leave, along with 10 possible signings. Among those who came in over the next few months were figures who would play a huge role in Swansea’s subsequent rise through the leagues, including future manager Roberto Martinez, Leon Britton and Alan Tate.\nAdvertisement\n“Tatey, who was 18, took some persuading,” says Flynn. “He’s in my office and saying, ‘If I do well here, it could help me get in the Manchester United team’. I said, ‘You’ve got no effing chance of playing for Man United, let’s get that straight — this is where your career is, not a stepping stone back to United’.\n“In the end, Tatey fell in love with the place. Same with Leon. They all do, as Swansea is a great place to live.”\nFlynn handed out 21 debuts during that 2002-03 fight for survival. “The final cog was Roberto Martinez,” he says about the Spaniard, 29 at the time and languishing in Walsall’s reserves.\n“He became the lynchpin, on and off the field. I remember spending about six hours when he first came down, explaining what was happening, such as how we didn’t have a training ground.\n“Some days, we’d just go to the beach. Alan Curtis was our expert on when the tide was likely to be in or out, saying things like, ‘It should be dry enough by 11am and ready to train’. Not ideal, but Roberto just nodded his head.\n“The lads loved him. He’d been here a month when I noticed everyone was rushing to get showered and changed after training. I asked what the rush was about. Turns out Roberto had arranged for lunch to be put on at a Spanish restaurant he’d found on Windsor Road.\n“He’d chatted to the owner and, for three quid each, they were getting all the healthy food they could eat, plus soft drinks. Every day the lads went down there, all together. In there until 3pm and then Roberto set up another place to go for coffee.\n“There was only five seats that could be booked each afternoon. Roberto and four others. All the lads were desperate to go as they’d sit there all afternoon, talking football and all sorts. I’m told they ended up with a rota.”\nMartinez’s arrival in January meant Flynn finally felt Swansea were ready to make a fist of the survival scrap, despite languishing in 24th place. It was a fight that went to the final day, a home clash with Hull City. With Shrewsbury Town already down, Swansea had to win or risk being overtaken by Exeter City, a point behind but with a superior goal difference.\nAdvertisement\nJames Thomas duly delivered, netting a hat-trick as Swansea came from 2-1 down to triumph 4-2 on a never-to-be-forgotten afternoon at the Vetch Field. “Look how long Wrexham and Newport stayed in non-League (15 and 25 years respectively),” says Flynn when asked what would have happened had Exeter’s 1-0 win over Southend United been enough to keep the Devon club up instead.\n“Swansea would have been the same. There’d have been no new stadium, I’m sure of that. Whereas within a few months of that Hull win, I’m there with Lyn Jones, head coach of the Ospreys (the rugby club who share the stadium with City), as we cut the first sod in the ground where the Liberty was built.”\nNow for the Lifetime Achievement Award sponsored by @swanstrust 🏆\nCongratulations to a true great, Brian Flynn ❤️ pic.twitter.com/5sXfnGGzv7\n— Swansea City AFC (@SwansOfficial) May 3, 2023\nFlynn is proud of his rescue job at Swansea. So, too, the dozen years he spent in charge of Wrexham.\nGO DEEPER\nBrian Flynn – the man who built Wrexham\nBut he really comes alive when discussing his part in the Wales coaching setup, working initially under John Toshack. “Tosh had this plan to get the average age of the senior squad down from 31 to 25 inside five years,” says Flynn. “That’s where I came in. He wanted me to run three teams — the under-17s, under-19s and under-21s.\n“At the time, there was a coach in charge of each — which, Tosh felt, meant the kids were getting three different voices and three different sets of ideas across four years. He wanted one voice, one person.\n“The only problem was he hadn’t actually told the Welsh FA his plan yet, so I had to keep my mouth shut until the next council meeting in a month.”\nOnce in situ, Flynn was constantly on the road, either at tournaments or scouting for talent.\n“People often ask me how I’d find players,” he says. “Simple, I asked questions. I’d go into a club and ask, ‘How many Welsh players are there here?’. The reply would often come back, ‘None’. But how did they know? One of the parents might be Welsh. Or one of the four grandparents. That’s six opportunities outside where a player is born.\nAdvertisement\n“Ashley Williams was one I found at Stockport when scouting Wayne Hennessey. The surname got my attention at first as I’d look for any mention of Williams, Evans, Davies or Jones.\n“I phoned (Stockport manager) Jim Gannon to ask the question. He laughs and says, ‘Not a chance — Ash is a Midlands boy’. I said fair enough, but could he do me a favour and just ask the question? An hour later, Jim calls back to say, ‘You were right, Brian, one of his grandparents was born in Wales’.”\nWilliams was one of nine in Chris Coleman’s 23-man Euro 2016 squad to have been born outside Wales, underlining the value of Flynn’s approach. Another was Hal Robson-Kanu, who, like Williams, scored in Wales’ famous 3-1 quarter-final win over Belgium.\n“I was at Reading’s training ground one day and Glen Little shouted across to me, ‘Here, Brian, did you know this fella can play for Wales?’” he says. “Glen points at Hal and then adds, ‘Yes, he goes on holiday to Wales!’\n“I knew Glen was having me on, but I still went over later for a chat. I explained how Glen was taking the piss out of me, not him. Hal was fine with that. Then he says, ‘The thing is, I do go on holiday to Wales, we go to Tenby as my mum and dad have a caravan’.\n“He then starts telling me how they’d drive down the M4, ‘calling in at Caerphilly for my grandmother, who has always lived there’.”\nFlynn spent eight years looking after Wales’ under-age sides before leaving in 2012. “Tosh’s desire to get the average age of the seniors down was great for me,” he says. “He’d say to me, ‘Just tell me when they’re ready’. That’s how Gareth played for the seniors at 16.\n“Seeing those lads become the players they did was great, especially at the Euros. I watched the tournament from home and felt so proud. I just wish they could have made it all the way to the (2016) final, as it really did feel like our chance.”\n(Top photo: Stu Forster via Getty Images)",
