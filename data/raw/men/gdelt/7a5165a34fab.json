Leon’s a great guy. I like him a lot, even though he’s obviously upset at the moment. I understand that too. But that’s part of life in football.”\nWhile United’s minority shareholders, INEOS, are more keen on signing younger talent and those with plenty left in the tank, TEAMtalk understands they are opportunistic and would explore a deal if the price were right.\nWe have also been told he is raging at his lack of minutes and subsequent axing from the matchday squad leaving the door open for a potential move.\nHowever, the midfielder’s current package would be an issue and he would likely need to take a considerable drop on the current £273,000 a week package he earns in Bavaria for a move to come off.\nMan Utd to hand Amad new deal as Martial finally finds new club\nElsewhere at United, the Red Devils are ready to hand the ever-improving Amad Diallo a new deal at Old Trafford after the young winger’s fine start to the new season.\nThe former Sunderland and Rangers loanee has had to wait patiently for his opportunity to shine at United but has now taken that opportunity with both hands, having become a regular in the starting line up this season.\nAmad’s existing deal expires at the end of the 2024/25 season, though Man Utd do hold a club option for an extra year.\nHowever, TEAMtalk can confirm the player remains happy at Old Trafford and is very much open to extending his existing arrangement, and with talks slotted to commence in the coming months.\nAlso on Tuesday, it has emerged that former United forward Anthony Martial is closing in on his next club, with a surprise move across Europe closing in and in a deal that will make him his new side’s highest-paid player of all time.\nHow Goretzka has fallen out of favour at Bayern\nGoretzka arrived at Bayern in the summer of 2018 and immediately established himself as one of the first names on Niko Kovac’s team sheet.\nHe made 42 appearances in all competitions in his debut season and registered nine goals and seven assists for the club. The midfielder remained a key player under Hansi Flick and made 38 appearances in the 2019/20 season as Bayern won the Bundesliga, the Champions League and the DFB-Pokal.\nHe also enjoyed his most productive campaign on an individual level, registering eight goals and 11 assists in all competitions.\nThe Germany international struggled with illness and injury problems in the following two seasons, which limited him to 26 starts in all competitions in both 2020/21 and 2021/22.\nHe still managed to provide eight goals and eight assists for the club in 2020/21 but that dropped to three goals and three assists in 2021/22.\nGoretzka put his injury issues behind him in 2022/23 and registered six goals and six assists in 40 appearances in all competitions as Bayern won their 11th consecutive Bundesliga title.\nHe was a regular under Thomas Tuchel in 2023/24 and Harry Kane, Joshua Kimmich and Konrad Laimer were the only Bayern players to make more appearances than him.\nThe 29-year-old also registered six goals and 11 assists in his 42 appearances, but he was criticised for some poor performances and was left out of the Germany squad at Euro 2024.\nHe has now fallen out of favour under Kompany and has made just one substitute appearance at the start of this season.\n“Leon has been at Bayern for a very, very long time. He was very successful and is a great player,” Bayern sporting director Christoph Freund said after a DFB Pokal first-round win against Ulm.\n“We spoke to him and made it clear to him that there’s a lot of competition in his position. We are very well equipped there. Leon knows that. And that’s why the situation is like this at the moment, and why he’s not in the squad today.”",
