So many good teams, who all can compete.\n\"We're one of them, but we're not, at this moment, in a position to compete No.1 or No.2. That's a fact.\n\"This year, we stand still, but when everyone is available, definitely we're competing for the top four. I'm confident of that.\"\nIn a message to Ratcliffe, Ten Hag added: \"We can come closer if we make a good window. We have to strengthen in key positions and also in the depth of the squad, which is one of the lessons from this season.\"\n90min understands Ratcliffe is keen to seal a move for Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise, who is understood to be interested in making the switch to Old Trafford this summer.\nA new striker is also on the agenda, and while there is interest in RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, officials are also looking at Brentford's Ivan Toney.\nToney is seen as both a reliable source of goals and a potential leadership figure in the United dressing room if he were to make the move this summer.",
