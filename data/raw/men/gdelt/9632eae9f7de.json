So I think it takes a bit of time.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nIn that sense, Arteta’s search for experience will be boosted by the deadline-day acquisition of Raheem Sterling, but questions still linger over their depth in key positions, particularly at striker.\nKai Havertz has impressed under the burden of responsibility so far, but Hargreaves isn’t certain the German’s exploits will be enough on his own in the Champions League.\n‘Raheem Sterling on loan is quite interesting because he gives them experiences and extra depth to give them somebody who’s kind of been there in those games and understands what it takes,’ he added.\n‘Kai Havertz has done an amazing job as a striker but I’m maybe slightly surprised that they didn’t add one other player to help out.\n‘We’ve seen it’s hard [to win the Champions League] – look at Paris Saint-Germain who have invested billions and haven’t been able to win.\n‘I do think that Arsenal are going up – they’ll win trophies. But the competition gets fiercer every year and that lack of depth could cost them.’\nFans are ‘going to love’ new league format\nBoth Arsenal and fans will have to make a slight adjustment this season as the Champions League evolves away from its traditional four-team group format to a league stage\nThe change has not received universal praise but while Hargreaves saw no need for the switch, the former Manchester United midfielder thinks it could ultimately work to the tournament’s benefit.\n‘The old format was so successful, wasn’t it? It felt like the teams used to get better every year. We were used to it and, as the saying goes, if it’s not broke, don’t fix it,’ he began.\n‘But we have seen European competitions evolve all the time. You get more games and bigger games in the group stages and there are more teams in it that probably wouldn’t have the opportunity before.\n‘I look at likes of Girona and Stuttgart and Brest. They’re going to be cool stories. One of the first games you have got Real Madrid versus Stuttgart which is such a cool game. Defending champions against a team that hasn’t been anywhere near that for probably a decade. That’s probably an example of what’s to come.\n‘I think in the end, people are going to love it, but people find change very difficult, especially when it’s been so successful. So let’s see.’\nSecret to winning the Champions League? It’s simple…\nA two-time winner of the competition, with Bayern in 2001 and United in 2008, the 43-year-old is well-versed on what is required to be successful in the competition.\nBut the secret, at least for Hargreaves, was relatively simple.\n‘Play for good teams?’ the former England midfielder joked when asked about what it takes to win the competition.\n‘To be honest, I didn’t even think I was gonna be a pro as a young kid. So to be able to go and actually even compete in the championships and then win it a couple of times was crazy.\n‘Sometimes I actually forget I played football in a way because it feels longer, but I was very blessed to play for some great teams and have some amazing teammates.\n‘But we weren’t the best team in either year,’ he continued. There were teams as good as us – Barcelona, Chelsea, Real Madrid – but we were just really good when we needed to be in the right moment.\nMore Trending\n‘That’s what the Champions League is about. You obviously have to get through the group or the new league format now.\n‘And then when you get to knockouts, the best players, the best team to have it when they need it. That’s a fact.\n‘That’s what we had. We had guys that were just really good when you needed to be and I think that’s what top-level sport is about, not just football.’\nTNT Sports is the home of the UEFA Champions League, Europa League, and Europa Conference League.
