  "body_text": "Premier League giants Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal are all expected to target late deals before the summer transfer window closes.\nSpending by Premier League clubs in the transfer market was £800m down on last summer ahead of the final week of the window.\nAlmost £1.5bn has been splashed out on transfers but that is still way down on last summer with less than 48 hours remaining for clubs to bolster their squads.\nThe looming threat of transfer bans and even points deductions for clubs who fail to meet profit and sustainability rules has made those in charge wary of significant outlays.\nBut that does not mean transfer deadline day will be a washout. In fact, some of the Premier League’s biggest hitters are still targeting late deals.\nWho will Chelsea sign?\nPredictably, given their approach in the transfer market since Todd Boehly took over the club, Chelsea have been the biggest spenders in the Premier League so far this summer.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nMore than £200m has been spent by the Stamford Bridge club on the likes of Pedro Neto, Joao Felix and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, while Chelsea have also secured several emerging players on long-term contract.\nDespite their remarkable approach in the transfer market, Chelsea could splash yet more cash before the European window closes at 11pm on Friday night as they look to sign a new striker for Enzo Maresca.\nChelsea put six past Premier League rivals Wolves at the weekend but those within Stamford Bridge still see the benefit of bringing in a new frontman.\nLong-term target Victor Osimhen continues to be linked with a move to Chelsea but has also attracted substantial interest from Saudi Arabia.\nThe Napoli striker is believed to favour a move to England but his salary demands may be beyond Chelsea, putting Al-Ahli in a commanding position to secure his signature.\nChelsea have also been heavily linked with a move for Brentford ace Ivan Toney, who is yet to feature for the Bees this season amid interest from other Premier League clubs and Saudi.\nIn one of the more surprising rumours of the summer, Chelsea are said to be interested in Manchester United flop Jadon Sancho despite his underwhelming spell at Old Trafford.\nWho will Chelsea sell?\nChelsea need to offload several players, not only to help balance the books but also to trim Maresca’s bloated squad.\nThe Blues boss has banished England internationals Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell from first-team training and confirmed they will not feature this season if they fail to secure last-minute summer moves.\nMan United, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace have all shown interest in Sterling, who will likely have to take a pay-cut to ensure he leaves and has the chance to revive his Premier League career.\nRomelu Lukaku, a player who cost Chelsea almost £100m, is closing in on a return to Italy with Napoli set to take a chance on the 31-year-old.\nChelsea are in talks with Ipswich Town over a deal for striker Armando Broja but are struggling to find interest in Chilwell, with Manchester United going cold on the left-back.\nKepa Arrizabalaga, who spent last season on loan at Real Madrid, could make a surprise loan move to Bournemouth, while Trevor Chalobah, Cesare Casadei and Tino Anjorin have been tipped for late moves.\nWho will Man Utd sign?\nManchester United have not matched Chelsea’s prolific number of signings but have still spent almost £150m on four new additions.\nThey signed Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee from Lille and Bologna respectively before completing a double deal for Bayern Munich duo Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui.\nThe Red Devils are preparing to unveil Manuel Ugarte as their fifth summer signing – the Uruguay enforcer ready to strengthen Erik ten Hag’s midfield options following a £42m move from PSG.\nThe Ugarte deal has been United’s priority for some time but they have also explored moves for Chelsea outcasts Sterling and Chilwell.\nSterling is even said to be ‘open’ to joining Manchester United despite his ties to local rivals Manchester City, but it remains to be seen whether the Old Trafford club will push forward with the deal after initial talks.\nChilwell emerged as a possible target for United earlier in the summer – the club considered signing a new left-back due to Luke Shaw’s ongoing injury problems – but the deal is currently off the table.\nA swoop for Toney also appears unlikely at this stage although Manchester United are known admirers of the 28-year-old and have been made aware that the player would relish the move.\nWho will Man Utd sell?\nManchester United agreed a deal to sell Scott McTominay ahead of Ugarte’s arrival at the Theatre of Dreams.\nThe Scotland international, who has been at United since the age of six, travelled to Napoli to complete his £25m move on Tuesday.\nHannibal Mejbri, the 21-year-old midfielder, has also made a permanent move away from Manchester United, joining Championship side Burnley on a four-year contract.\nTen Hag wants his bosses to get Sancho off the books before the transfer deadline, having left the winger out of United’s first two Premier League games of the season.\nWhile Chelsea are admirers, Juventus are believed to be leading the race to sign Sancho, who played in a Champions League final for Borussia Dortmund less than three months ago.\nWho will Arsenal sign?\nLargely content with a squad that has secured back-to-back second-place finishes in the Premier League and emerged as Manchester City’s biggest rivals for the title, Arsenal made a subdued start to the summer window.\nThey brought in Italy defender Riccardo Calafiori after his brief but impressive spell at Euro 2024 and turned David Raya’s loan stint from Brentford into a permanent deal.\nMidfielder Mikel Merino became Arsenal’s third summer signing earlier this week, joining from Real Sociedad in a deal that could reach £32m.\nThe only gaps in Arsenal’s squad appear to in the final third, with doubts persisting over Kai Havertz’s ability to lead the line for a title-winning side and Bukayo Saka in need of support on the right flank.\nThat is the position Arsenal could yet look to strengthen before the deadline, though signing a new winger would be dependent on sales.\nIf Arsenal do decide to sign a new striker – as has been suggested by several pundits – Toney is a player who has been touted as a possible target.\nSpeaking after Arsenal’s opening Premier League win over Wolves, Mikel Arteta suggested the club would not be signing a new frontman this summer, though the Spaniard’s stance appeared to change after Gabriel Jesus’ recent injury setback.\nThe Gunners also appear to be in the market for a new back-up goalkeeper and have identified Joan Garcia, the Espanyol star, as a top contender for the role.\nRecent reports claimed Arsenal had already agreed personal terms with the 23-year-old. Earlier this week Garcia’s Espanyol manager admitted he is worried about losing him.\nWho will Arsenal sell?\nArsenal are targeting the not so sexy signing of a back-up goalkeeper as Aaron Ramsdale closes in on a move away from the Emirates Stadium.\nMore Trending\nRamsdale, once Arteta’s first-choice goalkeeper, has lost his place in the team to Raya and the pursuit of first-team football will take Ramsdale to Southampton in a deal worth £25m.\nArsenal will raise a similar amount by selling Eddie Nketiah to Crystal Palace, while Fabio Vieira has returned to his former club Porto on a season-long loan deal.\nReiss Nelson, who made 23 appearances last season, is open to leaving his boyhood club amid interest from West Ham and Fulham.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Ben White’s England exile set to continue with Arsenal star not picked in Lee Carsley’s first squad\nMORE: Michael Dawson ‘cannot believe’ Chelsea haven’t signed Ivan Toney\nMORE: Carabao Cup third-round draw: Holders Liverpool to face West Ham as Wimbledon get Newcastle",
