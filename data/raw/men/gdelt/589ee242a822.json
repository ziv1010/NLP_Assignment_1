They'll be excited to play in the final and so will we,\" said Ancelotti on Wednesday.\n\"Football's changing because there are a lot of teams all over the world that can compete, fight and win too.\"\nAt two goals up against Al Ahly Madrid appeared to have sealed progress to the final but their opponents hit back with a penalty and missed a golden chance to equalise.\nAfter Luka Modric missed a spot kick of his own, Rodrygo scored a brilliant goal to secure the win and Arribas's fourth put a cherry on the cake.\nIt was Valverde's first goal for the club since November and Ancelotti was happy the Uruguayan was back on the scoresheet.\nAmid reports of a family issue away from the game and after the World Cup, Valverde has not been at his best.\nIn the first half of the season the midfielder was Madrid's key player, driving them through in the Champions League and helping them keep pace with Barcelona at the top of La Liga.\n\"I'm happy because he played a good game,\" said Ancelotti.\n\"He produced the goods, showed his quality and scored. Little by little he's coming back.\"\nVinicius was able to brush off the issues he has been suffering from in Spain recently too, including several instances of racist abuse, opening the scoring for Madrid with a delicate chip.\nMadrid are undeniably more dangerous with Benzema leading the line but the forward has been set back by a string of niggling injuries this season.\nSeveral other Madrid players have also been sidelined, including Thibaut Courtois, Ferland Mendy, Lucas Vazquez and Eden Hazard, who will not make the final, while Eder Militao is another doubt.\nHowever after their goal glut against Al Ahly, Ancelotti will be confident his strikers can get the job done and make history on Saturday.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
