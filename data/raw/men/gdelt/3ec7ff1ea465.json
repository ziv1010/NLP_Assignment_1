The goomahs in attendance were having to listen about the good old days, a time when many of them weren’t even born; a beach house booked on the Jersey shore, the summer of ’78, the hippie kid who mysteriously drowned during a party.\nAdvertisement\n“Hey Tone… Are you OK? You’re kinda quiet,” he gets asked. Tony pushes out his chair and makes to leave. Before he does, he offers an explanation. “’Remember when’ is the lowest form of conversation,” he says. And yet Italian football never ceases to indulge in it.\nOn the morning of the World Cup draw on Friday, a photo from the restaurant of the FIFA hotel went viral. It showed the coach of Uzbekistan and Italy’s last World Cup-winning captain, Fabio Cannavaro, sat round a table with Christian Vieri. Behind them were Francesco Totti, the original Ronaldo, Marco Materazzi, Roberto Baggio and Vincent Candela. “Once upon a time in Serie A” should have been the caption.\nLA CALIDAD QUE HAY EN ESTA FOTO, PFFFF 🚬\n🔝🎩 Los muchachos: Totti, Ronaldo, Materazzi, Candela, Baggio, Vieri y Cannavaro pic.twitter.com/XWX6Lvcwun\n— Diario Olé (@DiarioOle) December 5, 2025\nOperation Nostalgia\nA delegation from the Italian Football Federation was not visible at the Kennedy Center. They were, judging by the papers back home, presumptively disguised as ‘UEFA Path A winner’. If Italy come through the play-offs, a feat that proved beyond them in 2017 and 2022, they will play Canada, Qatar and Switzerland. “Someone up there still loves us,” journalist Fabio Licari observed in Gazzetta dello Sport.\nIf that really were the case, Italy would have qualified automatically with a new generation of Cannavaros, Vieris, Baggios. Instead they still have to overcome Northern Ireland and the winner of Wales-Bosnia in March.\nAn examination of their own flaws since the 4-1 defeat to Norway in November has coincided with an uptick in criticism of the man Corriere dello Sport calls ‘FIFAtino’, the ‘Sultan of Zurich’ and giver of the ‘InfantiNobel peace prize’.\nComment has been passed on the World Cup’s expansion, Africa being awarded more places than ever at a time when Europe is still better represented than any other continent and the flagrant injustice of Italy, a four-time winner of the World Cup and homeland of Infantino’s parents, landing in Pot 4 (if they qualify), as if Italy should have been entitled to a bye or special dispensation. The truth is, in a meritocracy, ‘remember when’ is the lowest form of qualification and Italy still have to earn their place before they can lean on the 1.5m Canadians with Italian ancestry if Canada’s opponents in Toronto on June 12 really are to be them.\nAdvertisement\nSpeaking to the same paper, the president of the Italian Football Federation, Gabriele Gravina, offered a reminder as to why Italy struggle. “(In Serie A) 97 players are eligible for selection (to the national team). That’s 25 per cent of the total,” he said. “Ninety-seven from 20 clubs. Do you realise that?”\nWhy Italy is in this state\nInstead of dwelling on Croatia, a nation with a population smaller than the cities of Milan and Rome combined, reaching the semi-finals of the last World Cup or Portugal, the Nations League champions, being successful regardless of only a handful of national team players playing in their own domestic competition, let’s analyse Gravina’s comment through the prism of this weekend’s games in Serie A. There were a couple of biggies from the upper echelons of the table.\nThe first pitted an American-owned club against an Indonesian-backed one managed by a Romanian and a Spaniard, which is not to rail against the internationalism of Internazionale-Como (this league has been crying out for investment and ideas from the outside, good governance too), it is merely a fact. No Italians featured for Como either from the start or off the bench. This is not deliberate.\n“I’ve personally tried,” Cesc Fabregas said earlier this year. “The sporting director, who is Italian, has tried to bring as many Italians to the club as possible. I swear to you, I analyse and look out for Italians who can help us raise our game. I have found it incredibly hard — incredibly hard.”\nThe nominatively-determinist Internazionale, meanwhile, retained their Italian core of Francesco Acerbi, who is 37 and refused a call-up for the Italy squad that lost 3-0 to Norway in June when so many centre-backs were out injured. Diego Coppola, now at Brighton, started next to Alessandro Bastoni instead.\nAdvertisement\nBastoni, who is a shadow of the player he is for Inter with the national team, helped lead his club side, along with Nicolo Barella, to a statement-making 4-0 win against Como. Inter’s goals were scored by an Argentine, a Frenchman, a Turk and a Brazilian. Pio Esposito, the much-hyped 20-year-old striker, made a cameo but was unable to find the net as he had done in the 5-1 demolition of Venezia in the cup on Wednesday.\n“(Inter are) very good,” Fabregas acknowledged. “It’s as if you’re pressing the Barcelona of Messi and Xavi. You have to do lots of things well because they’re so good they always find a solution. Bastoni and Federico Dimarco play with their eyes closed.” Italians. The pair of them. A silver lining.\n“Inter play Liverpool (in the Champions League) on Tuesday and I’ll come to watch it so I can keep learning,” Fabregas told DAZN.\nIt was Como’s first defeat since August and left the impression that, Milan permitting, the title race will settle into a repeat of last season when it was between Inter and eventual champions Napoli who are playing, at the moment, as if they can retain the Scudetto for the first time in their history.\nLast season does not look like a one-off, no matter how much Antonio Conte called the title “a miracle”, having taken them from midtable to top again after loaning Victor Osimhen to Galatasaray in the summer and selling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG in the winter. In 2023, they were the stars of the first Napoli team to win the league since Diego Maradona.\nOn Sunday, the coach of that team, Luciano Spalletti, returned to Naples for the first time as an opposition coach now in charge of Juventus, the old enemy. The game fell on the anniversary of the city of Naples making Spalletti an honorary citizen. Disappointingly, he was not welcomed back as one. Memories are shorter and shorter in football. Perhaps it lives by the Soprano line.\nSpalletti’s return to Naples\nJuventus travelled down on the day of the game rather than stay overnight in a hotel on the bay for fear that the players’ sleep would be disrupted by honking horns and fireworks in the early hours. Spalletti’s name was whistled at the Stadio Maradona when the identity of the visiting coach was announced on the tannoy.\nAdvertisement\n“My Napoli was a wonderful story,” he said afterwards. “No one can take that away from me. I’ve been back before and you didn’t know about it. There is one other thing I’d like to say in my defence. It wasn’t just storia (a story). I also made the soldi (money) to build the Napoli of today, to put things right, to buy and sell players.”\nSpalletti got Napoli back in the Champions League, blazed a trail to the quarters, unprecedented for the club, and showed Napoli could win the league without Maradona. Aurelio De Laurentiis, the movie producer and owner of the club, was able to make a film about it. Still, there is no love lost between them.\nUndefeated in Fuorigrotta this calendar year, Napoli did not lose on Sunday. They needed penalties to knock Cagliari out of the cup in midweek but didn’t look tired. A new Napoli has emerged over the last month. Ravaged by injury, the spine of last year’s team (Alex Meret, Stanislav Lobotka and Romelu Lukaku) is still missing. The system, a 4-1-4-1, has been screwed up and thrown in the bin. Scott McTominay is having to grit his teeth, play through pain and operate deeper to cover for absences in the middle of the park.\nThis is why Spalletti decided to play without a striker. He felt Juventus might be able to outnumber and dominate Napoli’s midfield. He was wrong.\nDavid Neres has recently come alive. Noa Lang is beginning to show his potential. Rasmus Hojlund scored a brace. It is a livelier attack than last year’s, an improvisation, a virtue of necessity.\nIf starting without a centre-forward raised eyebrows, particularly those of Canada coach Jesse Marsch, who could be forgiven for thinking Dusan Vlahovic’s recent injury would open up opportunities for Jonathan David, the decision to substitute Kenan Yildiz drew criticism for Spalletti. The Turk, once again, got Juventus back into the game at 1-0 down. When Hojlund put Napoli back in front, it was unclear who else out there could bring Juventus level again. Edon Zhegrova, for instance, came on too late.\n“We put in another fine display tonight; there was intensity and a high tempo like the manager wants,” Napoli skipper Giovanni Di Lorenzo said. “I’m happy for Hojlund.” Di Lorenzo was, along with Alessandro Buongiorno and the Juventus contingent of Michele Di Gregorio, Manuel Locatelli and Andrea Cambiaso, one of five Italians who started the game. It was more than in Inter-Como.\nAdvertisement\nOf the players Gennaro Gattuso can pick from Napoli and Juventus, Di Lorenzo is the only regular starter for the national team and an (unfairly) maligned one at that too. In DAZN’s post-game show, a segment was designated not to the game, but a partnership between the league and EA Sports, which has introduced a Classic XI to the FC 26 game.\nUn pieno di talento e magia di diverse generazioni. Gioca con il Serie A Classic XI, disponibile ora su #FC26! @easportsfcit @EASPORTSFC\n➡️ https://t.co/tsA0ZHNh6p pic.twitter.com/Sd9HoFUlI2\n— Lega Serie A (@SerieA) December 3, 2025\nOne of the pundits, Ciro Ferrara, took issue with fellow panellist Claudio Marchisio’s picks, such as Roberto Carlos’ inclusion in an all-time XI. He thought Paolo Maldini could be moved to left-back and Cannavaro brought in beside Alessandro Nesta. An over-the-hill Ronaldinho (who did little at Milan) was another bone of contention next to Zinedine Zidane and Andrea Pirlo in midfield.\nFor 15 minutes or so, this was a case of virtual ‘remember when’. The gap between today and yesteryear was wistfully lamented all over again. New revenue-generating infrastructure like the stadiums planned for Euro 2032 will do a better job at bridging it than Super Cups in Saudi Arabia and regular-season games in Australia. That’s still six years away and while it is impossible to predict what might happen in the future, Cremonese fans will no doubt gather to remember when Jamie Vardy played at the Zini.\nVardymania\nThe promoted teams are doing well this season. Sassuolo and Cremonese are breathing down Juventus’ neck. Europe is four points away. A week ago, Vardy left the Renato Dall’Ara with the player-of-the-match award. The brace he scored shattered Bologna’s dreams of going within a point of the league leaders. His goals were delightfully direct. The first: a long ball from the goalkeeper, a knock-down, second ball, through ball and one-v-one. The second: a long ball, a first-time volleyed cross and near-post finish.\n“What all these great champions have in common is an incredible simplicity,” Cremonese coach Davide Nicola said after their first win in Bologna for 34 years. “They know what to do and how to do it.”\nGiven how few goals have been scored in Serie A this season, Vardy’s tally of four puts him in the mix for the Capocannoniere. Leicester fans have been flying out to check on how he’s been doing. Make no mistake, Vardy is not yet the past. He is still very much part of Serie A’s present, a topic of conversation even someone of Tony Soprano’s mindset might consider hanging around to talk about a bit longer, albeit with a glass of red rather than a Red Bull.",
