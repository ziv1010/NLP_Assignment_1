Whoever plays we will be very competitive.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nCould Kai Havertz play again this season?\nThere was positive news too on the recoveries being made by Riccardo Calafiori and Kai Havertz.\nThe Italy international suffered another injury setback playing for his country last month but he looks set to make an imminent return.\n‘Riccardo is progressing really well,’ said Arteta. ‘To give you a timeline it’s difficult because he needs to step up, especially having more people around and how he reacts after that. But he’s in a good place I think.’\nHavertz, meanwhile, had been ruled out for the rest of the season after, like Saka, undergoing hamstring surgery but there is now an outside chance he could play again, especially if Arsenal have something tangible to play for.\nIs Declan Rice Arsenal’s free-kick taker?\nAfter his astonishing brace against Real, Rice now looks set to take over as Arsenal’s main dead ball specialist, regardless of whether or not he features against the Bees.\nMore Trending\n‘That is something we discuss a lot,’ said Arteta when asked if Rice had now usurped Martine Odegaard, who hasn’t scored a direct free-kick since September 2001.\n‘The different ways he can create moments in and around the box whether it is through crosses or scoring goals because he has all the qualities.\n‘He can run into the box, he can eliminate people by dribbling, he has a long-range shot. That’s where we are heading with him, to become someone that can decide a game with different tools.’\nMORE: Edu sends message to Mikel Arteta and finally breaks silence on shock Arsenal exit\nMORE: Joe Cole makes Champions League prediction after Arsenal, Barcelona and PSG wins\nMORE: ‘He’s a soldier!’ – Erik ten Hag hails Arsenal defender after Real Madrid win",
