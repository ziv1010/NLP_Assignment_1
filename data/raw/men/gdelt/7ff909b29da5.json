I don't think so,\" Matricciani said.\n\"But if she wants to play 60 or off the bench and then get exposed to that level again, then I think definitely they should consider taking her.\"\nBesides teammate McNamara, Apostolakis, who can play as both a central defender and a fullback, has plenty of role models to look to for inspiration.\n\"Ellie Carpenter has been one of my idols forever,\" Apostolakis said.\n\"I remember watching them in Sydney play against Brazil, and she's just always someone that I've idolised.\n\"Even when I was playing alongside Clare Hunt at Wanderers, she was a big idol for me.\n\"Her leadership, her dedication to improving herself is something that I love to watch.\"\nApostolakis is also eligible to play for the Philippines through her mother's side of the family - and has been scoped out for her interest.\n\"It has come up previously, when 'Staj' (Alen Stajcic) was actually the coach there, but no, it's always been my goal to play for Australia,\" she said.\n\"Because I was born here and I grew up here, so it's something I'm very connected with.\n\"I would love to connect to my roots somehow, but definitely think football-wise, it's definitely Australia for me.\"\nStill just 18, Apostolakis completed her HSC exams while with her City teammates in Thailand for the Women's Asian Champions League group stage.\nNow she's able to focus full-time on football.\nApostolakis and McNamara will play a crucial role in attempting to shut down Melbourne Victory's attack in Saturday's table-topping derby clash at Casey Fields.\nAustralian Associated Press",
