There are worrying signs for Liverpool and not all of their major new signings are firing but the bad run of form needs its full context.\nLiverpool's two Premier League away defeats were at Crystal Palace and Chelsea, first against a very good side who like to stick one on the Reds and then against opposition who very nearly didn't win the match.\nThey were beaten at Anfield by Manchester United – an aberration, certainly, but by no means unusual in a derby match with the favourites out of sorts – and away at Galatasaray, which can be a tough night for anyone.\nThat 1-0 loss in Istanbul was in Liverpool's second league phase match but it was in the first that some issues came to the fore.\nLiverpool made a habit early in the season of winning matches very late. Against Atletico Madrid at Anfield, they scored in the second minute of time added on to get off to a winning start in the Champions League.\nBut they had to throw a two-goal lead away to put themselves in that position in the first place, and that's the sort of thing that really will give Slot pause for thought.\nIt won't be lost on the Reds boss that Wednesday's opponents have played the same two opponents in the Champions League and posted a pair of results that really caught the eye.\nIn their first game, Eintracht hammered Galatasaray 5-1 at home. In their second, they were beaten by the same score at Atleti.\nThey too have had their problems domestically, winning just one of their five most recent Bundesliga fixtures.\nSlot will also be well aware that Eintracht's defensive issues have extended into league football too.\nThat most recent win was against last-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach by the ridiculous scoreline of 6-4. Dino Toppmoller's side have conceded at least two goals more than anyone else in Germany's top flight.\nFourFourTwo's prediction\nEintracht Frankfurt 0-4 Liverpool\nLiverpool have had a wobble but it won't last forever and they have enough about them to pick up a win here against opponents who can't keep the ball out of their net.\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses.
