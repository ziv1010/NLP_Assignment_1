  "body_text": "With PSG and Inter squaring off in Munich on Saturday in the Champions League final, Barcelona will be kicking themselves for what could have been.\nBarcelona need more squad depth to take next step in the Champions League\nIt will take more than just talent and desire to make amends for a disappointing late tournament exit\nIt seemed written in the stars that this season’s Barcelona should be there. Based on talent and overall form, they deserved it based on merit. It would have been a storybook final for fans and neutrals alike to see them go up against Luis Enrique, the last manager to take the club the distance in the tournament.\nBut across two legs, Inter got the better of the Blaugrana, even if Barcelona had qualification in their hands with just minutes to go.\nInter are worthy finalists, it’s true. But Barcelona also beat themselves. That’s where the disappointment lies.\nNext year, nothing is promised in the Champions League.\nTo make it to the end certainly requires talent, that’s a given, and Barcelona already has it.\nGood coaching is another necessity. You can check that box as well. Hansi Flick, perhaps, could have helped his team be more pragmatic, and hopefully in season two, they will add to their repertoire the ability to see out close games for a result by adjusting the shape and placement of their defense.\nAt the club level, however, the most important job lies with Joan Laporta and Deco. Flick, we know, will not ask for much. But in order to set up Barcelona for success in the tournament, they need to provide him with more depth in core positions.\nBarcelona is now a team that aims to win everything. They are back among the best clubs in Europe.\nInjuries and fatigue are inevitable aspects of the sport. A bit of bad luck is all it could take to derail their chances in the Champions League.\nThat’s why you hear so much about bringing in a new winger. Barcelona can not be so dependent on Raphinha and Lamine Yamal alone. They need more opportunities for rest before they burn out, and Flick needs to have confidence in a reliable piece for the wing that fits his system, who can fit into the regular rotation.\nOne thing we learned in the Champions League is that the fullback position really needs added depth as well, especially on the left.\nAlejandro Balde had a breakout season. He is the main man going forward. Gerard Martín deserves credit for overperforming expectations given his lack of experience, but he’s not on the level that’s required of a Barcelona player in the biggest games. In order to prove the doubters wrong, he’ll need to vastly improve his abilities going forward, which in my opinion is just something you either have or you don’t.\nThe other area is in the midfield, where the gossip has been quiet. Flick seems to be content with what he has on the roster, especially with Marc Bernal coming back from injury. But to be content in this area is to take a gamble.\nPedri needs to be protected. He has an injury history, and will need more rest than he got this season, because without him on the field, Barcelona is not the same.\nIn order for Barcelona to win the Champions League again, they need above all else, Pedri and Lamine Yamal to be at their best.\nIn order to get that, they need a deeper roster.\nBarcelona had tired legs down the stretch of the season. Grit kept them going, and as a rest they won the domestic treble. But you can’t deny that several players weren’t at their best (Raphinha comes to mind), and others suffered costly late season injuries.\nLuck matters in football, but clubs also make their own luck.\nLaporta, Deco, and Flick will certainly be thinking through what Barcelona needs beyond a stellar gala eleven.\nIt doesn’t mean they have to break the bank. We’ve already seen what’s possible when looking to La Masia for solutions.\nBut if they can only make a few signings, they’ll have to make them wisely.\nWinning the Champions League is one of the toughest jobs in sports, and in the end, as we saw this season, it can come down to the finest of margins.",
