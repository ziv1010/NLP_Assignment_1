  "body_text": "Aston Villa, Bologna kick-off their Europa League campaign\nMeeting in Birmingham for the second consecutive season, Aston Villa and Bologna will clash again today evening, kicking off their Europa League campaign at Villa Park.\nThe Premier League side won 2-0 in last year’s Champions League contest, but they come into this rematch after a sluggish start to the new campaign.\nYet to win a domestic game this season, Aston Villa seem to be suffering from a hangover after their near miss with Champions League qualification – plus a frustrating summer in the transfer market.\nA return to continental competition could prove Villa’s route to salvation – particularly following last season’s spectacular exploits. In their first appearance at Europe’s top level for more than four decades, Villa reached the Champions League quarter-finals before going out to eventual winners Paris Saint-Germain.\nHaving subsequently finished sixth in England, they are set for a first Europa League campaign since 2008; the club’s best UEFA Cup runs took them to the quarter-finals in both 1978 and 1998, before it was rebranded.\nAided by the vast experience of Unai Emery – the most successful coach in Europa League history, having won it four times to date – the Villans seem to have a straight path through the first phase, albeit only if they can rediscover some form.\nThe Serie A side were eliminated early in last term’s Champions League, finishing 28th of 36 teams in the league phase, but they have built on that experience by securing consecutive European qualifications for the first time this century.\nAs hosts Aston Villa are at a low ebb – struggling to score and looking bereft of ideas – they may have to settle for an opening draw.\nBologna will return to Villa Park still seeking their first victory over English opponents in any major competition.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nLille host SK Brann on matchday one\nIn their first meeting against them on the European stage, Lille will host SK Brann on matchday one of their Europa League campaign on Thursday at Stade Pierre-Mauroy.\nA fifth-place finish in Ligue 1 last season booked Les Dogues’ place into this tournament, while Brann wound up cruising past AEK Larnaca in their playoff tie, advancing 6-1 on aggregate.\nOne of the giant killers in the opening phase of the previous Champions League will be the favourites in nearly every first-round Europa League game they play this time around.\nBruno Genesio’s side defeated Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in Europe last season, while going unbeaten in the opening phase on their home field.\nLille have not lost a Europa League group fixture at home since December 2014, when Wolfsburg beat them 3-0, while their last European group defeat at Stade Pierre-Mauroy came at home to Ajax in a 2019 Champions League affair (2-0).\nThey are a perfect 2-0 at home to begin the new Ligue 1 campaign, but on Thursday could suffer consecutive competitive defeats for the first time since March after losing 3-0 domestically at Lens on Saturday.\nLille have a variety of weapons and creative players at their disposal, and should eventually find a way through the Norwegians who could be in for a rude awakening against an experienced European side.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nRed Bull Salzburg, Porto meet for the first time in Europe\nRed Bull Salzburg and Porto will meet for the first time on the European stage as both sides begin their Europa League campaign with a clash at Red Bull Arena.\nThe hosts are featuring in the competition proper for the 12th time, while they welcome the 2010-11 champions, who are entering their eighth campaign.\nA second place finish in the Austrian top flight in 2024-25 saw Salzburg fall into the Champions League second qualifying round, where they advanced comfortably past Norwegian side Brann.\nHowever, Die Roten Bullen’s hopes of a seventh straight appearance in the elite, were dashed by Belgian outfit Club Brugge, forcing them to drop into the Europa League.\nBack in the tournament for the first time since 2018-19, the Red Bulls, who failed to progress beyond the group phase in last season’s UCL, will be eager to avoid another early exit and will draw belief from their positive starts in Europe’s second-tier competition.\nIn contrast, Porto have enjoyed a dominant record against Austrian opposition in Europe, winning five and drawing one of their six such matches.\nThe Dragons have every reason to back themselves to continue that fine run, given their blistering form this season with six straight victories, the latest a 3-0 success at Rio Ave, leaving them at the summit of the Portuguese top flight.\nPorto’s poor away record in the Europa League lingers, but the Dragons’s history against Austrian opposition and their explosive start to the season make them favourites to take maximum points on Thursday.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nVfB Stuttgart welcome Celta Vigo\nVfB Stuttgart welcome Celta Vigo to the MHPArena both clubs kick off their UEFA Europa League campaigns.\nStuttgart are preparing to compete in back-to-back UEFA tournaments for the first time in nearly 15 years, while their Spanish opponents return to European football for the first time since 2016-17.\nStuttgart rubbed shoulders with some of the biggest clubs on the continent last season, participating in the Champions League against the likes of Real Madrid, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain.\nThe Bundesliga side struggled to match themselves against elite opposition, winning just three of their eight league phase matches. With that in mind, Stuttgart will welcome a step-down to the Europa League – a competition in which they will be expected to reach the knockout stages.\nStuttgart lost their first two competitive games, but the team have since bounced back with three wins from four across all competitions.\nCelta Vigo, on the other hand, return to Europe for the first time in nine years. The Spaniards sealed their continental return after finishing seventh in La Liga last season – their best league finish in nearly a decade.\nCelta Vigo have endured five straight 1-1 draws – a sixth such result would be rather unprecedented.\nWe are not expecting a repeat of that scoreline, with Stuttgart playing well in recent games – especially at home. Bearing everything in mind, we are backing the hosts to prevail by a single goal.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nFIXTURES\nFerencváros 20:00 Viktoria Plzeň",
