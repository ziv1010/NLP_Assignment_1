  "body_text": "Jorginho has shed some light on his future at Arsenal after rumours about his potential departure emerged.\nThe Italian joined the Gunners in January, taking the short, well-travelled road from Chelsea.\nThe midfielder is one of many players to make the switch and as things stand, has been one of the rare successes.\nAlthough not the preferred starter, Jorginho has been an adequate replacement for Thomas Partey when the Ghanaian has been injured and adds a lot of experience to a young dressing room.\nUnlikely to cement a first-eleven spot in Mikel Arteta’s side, the 31-year-old has been subject to links away from the club.\nJorginho’s contract expires at the end of the season and he touched on his future in London during Arsenal’s Champions League press conference on Tuesday.\n“No I haven’t had any conversations to be honest.” he said via Football.London.\n“All I can say is that I feel really good here. I’m really happy at Arsenal. I haven’t thought about it to be honest with you.”\nThe midfielder returned to his old stomping grounds on Saturday but failed to make his mark during the homecoming as Arsenal struggled to a 2-2 draw.\nHe will be in contention to start against Sevilla tomorrow night.",
