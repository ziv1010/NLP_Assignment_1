The winger was just 17 at the time and teamed up with Enzo Maresca’s side in the summer of 2025.\nEstevao has already made nine appearances for Brazil, scoring three goals in the process, and he is going from strength to strength for Chelsea as well.\nOn Wednesday evening, Estevao started for Chelsea against Ajax at Stamford Bridge in the Champions League.\nChelsea manager Enzo Maresca deployed the Brazilian teenager on the right of a front-three in a 4-3-3 formation.\nEstevao dazzled for Chelsea, with The Sun even suggesting that the Blues have found their new Eden Hazard.\nThe teenager scored from the spot in first-half injury time after winning the penalty himself.\nEstevao’s strike saw him become Chelsea’s youngest ever goalscorer in the Champions League at the age of at the age of 18 years and 181 days.\nIt was also the third record that the Brazil international winger has broken this season.\n18-year-old Estêvão this season:\n🔵 Youngest player in Premier League history to assist a goal for Chelsea\n🇧🇷 Youngest Brazilian to score the winning goal in a Premier League game\n⭐ Youngest goalscorer in Chelsea’s Champions League history pic.twitter.com/Y2B5302mfK\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) October 22, 2025\nFormer Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Paul Robinson was hugely impressed with Estevao.\nRobinson said about Estevao on BBC Radio 5 Live: “This is a young 18-year-old Brazilian who is full of confidence.\n“The whole of Stamford Bridge fell silent watching him – he didn’t rush, he had a long run-up, had a stutter and absolutely pinged it into the top right corner.\n“It is easy to take a penalty when you are 3-1 up, but he is 18 years old at a new club. That is a fantastic penalty.”\nFormer Chelsea star Joe Cole added on TNT Sports: “Wrapped it in, wrapped it into the top bins! He’s really going to enjoy… I’m really excited about watching him.”\nREAD NEXT 🔵 Chelsea eye ‘outstanding’ double swoop to build on agreed striker deal, reveals journalist\nTwo obstacles for Chelsea to sign Marc-Andre ter Stegen – sources\nWhile Estevao is fast-establishing himself as an important player for Chelsea, there are still question marks over the goalkeeping position.\nFilip Jorgensen started for Chelsea against Ajax on Wednesday, with Robert Sanchez on the bench.\nSources have told TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, that Chelsea are interested in signing a new goalkeeper.\nWe reported on October 14 that Chelsea want to sign Mike Maignan next summer when he becomes a free agent after his current contract with AC Milan runs out.\nMarc-Andre ter Stegen has also been linked, with Jones telling TEAMtalk that although the Barcelona goalkeeper could be a loan option, there are two major obstacles to a January deal.\nJones said: “It would not surprise me if Chelsea looked into getting Ter Stegen on loan for the second half of the season.\n“They want to make sure they are well prepared for any big moments and will definitely not want to be caught short in such a key position, which has been a concern already.\n“Obviously, he will be swamped with offers, so competing for a spot may not turn out to be something that appeals to him. The wages situation could come into the equation, too.\n“But I still think Chelsea will attempt to sign Maignan on a permanent deal, and that would happen in the summer, so getting Ter Stegen in short-term for now could be an option.\n“It has become clear that a move from Barca is on the horizon, so let’s see how this opens up.\n“Chelsea have definitely had interest in him in recent times and will be fully briefed on his situation ahead of any decision.”\nHAVE YOU SIGNED UP? 💫 Get the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.\nLatest Chelsea transfer news: Tottenham competition, shock Barcelona raid\nIn other Chelsea news, a former Stamford Bridge winger has made a shock decision over his new club.\nTEAMtalk’s transfer correspondent, Rudy Galetti, has reported that Chelsea have joined Tottenham Hotspur in the race for a top African gem.\nAnd finally, Chelsea have been tipped to sign a Barcelona striker, but it would be a bad decision.",
