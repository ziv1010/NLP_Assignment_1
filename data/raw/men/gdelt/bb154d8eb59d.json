  "body_text": "Liverpool FC have opted to end Calvin Ramsay’s loan spell at Wigan. Per The Athletic‘s James Pearce, Ramsay has been left out of the matchday squad for the last nine games in League One. Ramsay’s deal has now been terminated, and he will report back to the AXA Training Centre on Friday.\nCalvin Ramsay Wigan Loan Cut Short\nThe right-back will be returning to Merseyside on Friday.\nRamsay’s stint at Liverpool has been plagued by bad luck and missed opportunities. Since his move from Aberdeen in the summer of 2022, Ramsay has made two senior appearances in November of that year, coming off the bench against Napoli in the Champions League before starting in an eventual win over Derby in the Carabao Cup. He then suffered a serious knee injury that ended his season.\nThe following season saw Ramsay going to Preston and Bolton for two half-season loan stints, where he barely played, and then for 2024/25, he’s been at Wigan, where he made five starts in 12 appearances before the end of 2024.\nAlthough the player is only 21 years old, it seems likely that his future will lie away from Liverpool. There are suggestions that Ramsay will be heading to Carlisle for the second half of 2024/25, which would see him join a relegation battle in League Two, the fourth tier of English football.\nWe wish Calvin all the best wherever his football journey next takes him.",
