Yet whatever its source, the various promises add up to a substantial amount of money — financed without debt — that could be beyond his rivals.\nHere, The Athletic estimates the cost of each of Sheikh Jassim’s promises.\nBuying the club – £4.5bn\nOf course, the first and biggest expense for Sheikh Jassim, Ratcliffe or any potential suitor would be offering an acceptable amount of money to become the new owner of Manchester United.\nThe consensus around Sheikh Jassim’s bid is that the offer amounted to £4.5billion ($5.4bn), but he could go higher.\nThe Raine Group, the New York-based investment bank leading the sale process on the Glazer family’s behalf, was aiming for a significantly higher price of £6billion to £7billion.\nAdvertisement\nYet £4.5bn, if accepted, would still represent a substantial profit on the £790m they bought United for in 2005, using just £270m of their own money while loading the rest as debt on the club.\nClearing the debt – £580m\nArguably the most attractive element of Sheikh Jassim’s proposal is that the bid itself would be a full cash purchase — or as the statement says, “debt free”.\nFigures close to Sheikh Jassim have also confirmed they would clear all of the existing debt loaded onto the club by the Glazer family.\nThis is in contrast to the Ratcliffe bid, whose statement made no reference to debt.\nIneos would have to borrow money to finance any takeover and have not committed to wiping the existing debt, but those close to the Ratcliffe bid have offered assurances that no new debt will be loaded onto the club.\nUnited’s net debt stands at £656million, although the club would consider themselves to be ‘debt free’ if around £580m in liabilities was cleared off their books.\nAlthough it is a misconception that debt is necessarily detrimental to the day-to-day running of a club, it has become such a toxic issue during the Glazer family’s ownership that the vast majority of United fans would like to see the debts cleared entirely.\nIn fact, in a recent survey by The Athletic, a third of respondents said wiping the debt was the most important factor of all in any potential takeover.\nRedeveloping Old Trafford – up to £1.6bn\nOne of the major driving forces behind the Glazer family’s “process to explore strategic alternatives” is the need to update and modernise Old Trafford.\nAt the most recent fans’ forum held in December, a United spokesperson described redevelopment of the historic old ground as “a key focus” during this potential sale process, adding: “The club has been open that any future redevelopment of Old Trafford would require new capital.”\nAdvertisement\nThe last significant expansion of an additional 8,000 seats was signed off in early 2005, a few months before the Glazer takeover. In the time since, four of the other five so-called Big Six Premier League clubs have either expanded their stadium or moved into a new home with a larger capacity.\nIn April last year, the club appointed consultants Legends International and Populous to lead the first phase of planning for the future of Old Trafford. The club also conducted a fan survey and received 30,000 responses on what they would want to see from the process.\nThere are two options: either redeveloping Old Trafford’s existing structure or building a new stadium entirely on club-owned land adjacent to the current site.\nThe eventual cost to a Sheikh Jassim ownership would depend on the scale of whichever of those options is chosen. Building a new stadium would be the most expensive, with costs estimated between £1.2billion and £1.6bn ($1.2bn and $1.9bn).\nYet while redeveloping Old Trafford’s existing structure would be cheaper, United would also have to factor in the inevitable loss of revenue from either having to relocate to a smaller ground or reduce Old Trafford’s capacity over several seasons while renovations took place.\nTalk of a potential takeover has inevitably delayed the process, but whatever plan United ultimately choose, this will not be over quickly.\nOnce the club have their preferred option, work will begin on design, which would take approximately nine months. United would then move on to finalisation and planning, which could take up to another year.\nOnly then would the club be able to start thinking of putting spades in the ground.\n“These timings are in line with industry best practice,” said Collette Roche, United’s chief operating officer, in September last year. “As you will appreciate, we need to take time to get it right and it is not a quick fix.”\nAdvertisement\nRedeveloping the training ground – up to £50m\nAs well as persistent calls for the modernisation of Old Trafford, the standard of facilities at United’s Carrington training ground has also been a regular point of criticism, most memorably from one of their own players.\n“At United, the progress was zero, in my opinion,” Cristiano Ronaldo said in his tell-all interview with Piers Morgan last year, claiming United had fallen behind his former clubs Real Madrid and Juventus in training, technology and infrastructure.\n“I don’t know what’s going on but since Sir Alex Ferguson left I saw no evolution in the club, the progress was zero,” he said.\nIn September 2021, coincidentally not long after Ronaldo’s return, United announced they would be upgrading a range of facilities at Carrington, including two new pavilions hosting changing and catering facilities, as well as gyms and offices.\n“Longer term, we are looking at fuller redevelopment plans for Carrington to ensure it will be a state-of-the-art, fully integrated facility for our men’s, women’s and academy groups,” said Roche.\nUnited have since appointed Mags Mernagh as programme director for Carrington’s redevelopment.\nMernagh was previously director of infrastructure at Leicester City and oversaw the design and construction of their new, state-of-the-art training facility that was officially opened last year and is considered to be among the best in the country.\nArchitects KSS, who also worked on the Leicester project as well as Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool’s new training bases, have been appointed as masterplanners for Carrington’s future.\nWhereas Tottenham and Liverpool’s builds cost in the region of £50m, Leicester’s top-of-the-range facility was twice that price.\nAs with the redevelopment of Old Trafford, potential costs of Carrington’s renovations depend on the scale of upgrades, although remaining on the same site rather than building a new training ground elsewhere — and having to acquire land in the process — will keep costs down.\nStill, the upgrade will not come cheap.\nThe installation of a new tactical briefing room last summer, which was brought forward at Erik ten Hag’s request, cost £200,000 alone, while the overheads involved in building a gym for the women’s team went up by £2million due to external factors outside of the club’s control.\nAdvertisement\nInvesting in men’s team – £110m per year\nFor all that United’s facilities are in need of renovation and despite concerns over Qatar’s human rights record, the potential for investment in the men’s first-team playing squad is inevitably what has excited many supporters worldwide.\nA lot of fans may have looked on at the spending of Gulf state-linked ownerships at Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain over recent years in envy, but the reality is that United have been competitive in that regard even under the Glazer family.\nUnited’s net spend on the men’s first team over the past five years in transfer fees alone is roughly £545million — averaging £109m a year over that period, not least because of a poor track record in selling players.\nThe club also spent £384million on wages last season — a Premier League record — despite finishing sixth and failing to qualify for the Champions League.\nUnited’s problem has not been a lack of money to spend on transfer fees and wages but the misuse of it, building a lop-sided squad that is only just starting to be rebalanced. In the nine months since Ten Hag’s appointment, United have spent £228million in transfer fees and are at least beginning to see a return.\nYet whether another splurge will be possible this summer is unclear. The impact of UEFA’s overhaul of financial fair play (FFP) regulations complicates matters for a club that has not always spent money wisely in the market.\nGO DEEPER\nManchester United, £2m-a-week losses and financial fair play - a game of opinions\nUnder the new regulations, clubs will be restricted to spending 90 per cent of their total revenues on the wages of players and coaches plus transfer and agent fees from next season. A further restriction to 80 per cent will follow in 2024-25, with a final reduction to 70 per cent applied in the 2025-26 campaign.\nWhile detailing United’s stagnating income streams last month, The Athletic estimated the club’s current squad costs stood at 88 per cent of their revenue — only just below the 90 per cent limit in place from next season.\nAdvertisement\nTerminating the contract of their highest-paid player will have gone some way to help, while the departures of several players on the fringes of Ten Hag’s squad such as Harry Maguire, Donny van de Beek and Aaron Wan-Bissaka would also help.\nBut if United are still hovering just beneath UEFA’s threshold come the summer market, it will be difficult to spend without falling foul of the regulations, no matter who owns the club.\nInvesting in women’s team – £8m per year\nOne of the simplest ways for a Qatari-led ownership — or any ownership, for that matter — to make an immediate impact would be to invest in United’s women’s team.\nMarc Skinner’s side currently sit at the summit of the Women’s Super League and a first top-flight title since their reintroduction in 2018 would be a mark of substantial progress.\nIt is little over 18 months since The Athletic reported on a chaotic summer for United’s women’s side, with formal complaints and even a players’ strike considered by some amid concerns over the standard of facilities, all of which influenced former manager Casey Stoney’s decision to resign.\nGO DEEPER\nInside the chaos at Man United women: Talk of pre-season strike, crisis talks with Ed Woodward and substandard training facilities\nImprovements have followed, not only in the facilities but also with the appointment of Polly Bancroft as United’s head of women’s football, but there is always the capacity to do more, particularly as the women’s game is an area where relatively modest investment can have big benefits.\nThe most recent set of published accounts take in the 2020-21 season — Stoney’s final season in charge — when the operational expenses of running United’s women’s team stood at £2.8m.\nCompare and contrast that figure to Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea — the Big Three in English women’s football — who spent £4.2m, £4.9m and £6.9m respectively that same year.\nInvesting in the academy – around £8m per year\nUnited and other Premier League clubs are typically tight-lipped on youth development budgets, which are rarely if ever itemised in clubs’ annual accounts.\nAdvertisement\nA UEFA study, conducted in 2020, surveyed clubs across Europe on their youth development spending but no English clubs provided the relevant information.\nDespite this, UEFA estimated the average top-flight club budget for youth development in the Premier League was €6.1million — the highest in Europe.\nA club of United’s stature and resources, to say nothing of their proud traditions of promoting young talent, is certain to spend even more than that. Sheikh Jassim’s bid has played to those traditions and say they intend the academy to be a particular focus of any ownership.\nAnd as with investment in the women’s team, money spent on youth development is not considered under UEFA’s sustainability rules.\nCommunity work – £5m per year\nThe Sheikh Jassim bid’s statement also announced their intention to invest in “the communities the club supports”.\nThe Manchester United Foundation is the club’s associated charity which delivers educational and community outreach programmes to young people in Greater Manchester, partnering with more than 60 schools and colleges in the local area.\nAccording to the charity commission, the Manchester United Foundation’s total expenditure during the 2020-21 season was £4.2million, of which £3.6m was defined as charitable activities.\nEven with all the pledges to stadium redevelopment and investment in the playing squad, it would not be beyond the Qatari-linked bid’s ability to put funds into the Foundation and carry out further work in the community. Again, community-based projects such as this would not be considered under UEFA’s sustainability rules.\nAdded together, that all comes to an initial outlay of £6.73billion, with a further annual spend of £126m.\n(Top photo design: Eamonn Dalton)",
