The one ticket covers both matches.\nI think it is definitely the right move for Newcastle United to have ditched the usual double header format on the weekend before the Premier League kicks off, where Eddie Howe would usually have his squad split over the Saturday and Sunday playing two different opposition teams.\nHaving the one home match a week before the season kicks off, where he can put his full first team out against more prestigious opposition than usual, in front of what looks now a guaranteed full house. Definitely the right way to go for me.\nGo HERE to buy the last few remaining Newcastle v Atletico Madrid tickets.\nNewcastle United official announcement – 3 June 2025:\n‘St. James’ Park is set to host a spectacular weekend of football as we welcome both Atlético Madrid’s men’s and women’s teams for the third edition of the Sela Cup – and tickets are available from just £25.\nTaking place on Saturday 9th August, fans can enjoy a double-header featuring two of the most respected clubs in European football, with one ticket granting access to both matches.\nThe action kicks off at 1pm BST with Becky Langley’s side facing Atlético Madrid Femenino, a team that finished third in Liga F last season behind giants Barcelona and Real Madrid, and reached the Copa de la Reina final.\nAt 4pm BST, the men’s team take centre stage in their final pre-season fixture against Diego Simeone’s powerhouse Atlético side – a club fresh from securing third place in La Liga. It’s a clash worthy of the grandest stages – and a potential Champions League preview.\nWith the support of Newcastle United’s main partner, Sela, the Sela Cup returns for its third consecutive year – and once again, it brings world-class competition to St. James’ Park. Having already welcomed the likes of Fiorentina, Villarreal, Girona, and AC Milan Women, the tournament’s reputation continues to soar. This summer, the arrival of Atlético Madrid’s elite men’s and women’s teams sets the stage for what promises to be the most electrifying edition yet.\nTHE SELA CUP. SIMPLY UNMISSABLE.\nPrices from £25 for adults, £10 for concessions\nPriority access for season ticket holders and Mags Members opens 10am on Wednesday 4th June\nGeneral sale begins Friday 6th June\n(ED: It appears that when available to buy, tickets will be available HERE)\nHospitality packages will be announced soon, offering fans the chance to upgrade their matchday experience.\n‘AN IDEAL TEST’\n“Playing in the Sela Cup in front of our own supporters is something we really look forward to,” Eddie Howe told newcastleunited.com.\n“St. James’ Park is always special, but those games in the summer – seeing all the black and white shirts in the stands – are so unique. It will give the players an extra boost at a crucial time in our preparations.\n“Pre-season is all about being ready, both domestically in the Premier League and for the Champions League, so playing a team of Atlético’s calibre is an ideal test.\n“They are an extremely talented side, managed by one of the best coaches in the world.\n“We will have faced top quality opposition from both English and European football over the summer and it will stand us in good stead.”\n‘INCREDIBLE SUPPORT EVERY TIME’\nAhead of the visit of Atlético Madrid Femenino, Becky Langley said: “We’re really excited to be taking part in the Sela Cup again this year. It has become a big date to look out for in the pre-season schedule.\n“Like AC Milan last season, Atlético are a huge name with exceptional players so it’s a big test but one we’re motivated for.\n“We have another big season ahead of us in WSL 2. Matches like this will give us the physical test and type of experience we’ll need to be ready for it.\n“Every time we have played at St. James’ Park, we have received incredible support and we know it will be the same again in front of our outstanding fans.”\nA SPECTACULAR EXPERIENCE\nWe would like to thank our primary front-of-shirt partner, Sela, for making the Sela Cup possible.\nIbrahim Mohtaseb, Head of International Business at Sela, added: “We’re excited to welcome one of the biggest teams in Europe to St. James’ Park this summer.\n“Ahead of Newcastle United’s arrival back in the Champions League this will be a challenging test for both sides and an entertaining watch for fans.\n“Now into our third year of partnership with Newcastle United, we’re proud that the Sela Cup continues to provide a spectacular matchday experience for all.”\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
