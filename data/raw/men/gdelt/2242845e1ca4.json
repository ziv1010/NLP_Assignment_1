  "body_text": "Power Rankings: The best teams in Europe - Week 26\n- Real Madrid beat Barcelona in El Clasico\n- Inter won the Serie A title\n- Leverkusen remained unbeaten\nWe're now in the business end of the European football season, with the destinations of plenty of league titles being decided.\nAnd while that's fun, the fact that most are being decided by local derbies has made it even funner.\n- Arsenal thumped Chelsea 5-0 in a London derby in the Premier League.\n- Inter secured the Scudetto by beating Derby della Madonnina rivals AC Milan.\n- Real Madrid beat El Clasico rivals Barcelona 3-2 thanks to Jude Bellingham.\nAfter all that, here's the ten best football teams in Europe right now - ranked by 90min:\n10. AS Monaco (new entry)\nAS Monaco haven't lost a game of football since February 18, despite playing Paris Saint-Germain, Rennes, LOSC Lille and Ligue 1 suprise package Brest since then.\nThat impressive run of form has seen them all-but secure second place in France.\nNice one.\n9. Atalanta (re-entry)\nKnocked Liverpool out of the Europa League? Check.\nThrough to the Coppa Italia final? Check.\nAll things considered, it's been a pretty damn good few weeks for Atalanta. The Bergamo club could very well end the season with a cup double - something that would've been completely obscene to even dream of before Gian Piero Gasperini took over.\n8. Sporting CP (-)\nSporting CP's accumulation of 80 points in 30 Liga Portugal games is pretty extraordinary, and it is thanks in large part to the equally extraordinary form of Viktor Gyokeres in the final third.\nThe former Coventry City man has been deadly in front of goal during his maiden season in Lisbon, racking up 24 goals and 10 assists so far this season.\nSporting being seemingly unbeatable right now makes a lot of sense now, doesn't it?\n7. Arsenal (re-entry)\nArsenal have just followed up the worst week of the 2023/24 campaign with their best.\nThe Gunners bounced back from their UEFA Champions League exit remarkably well, beating tricky customers Wolves before thumping Chelsea 5-0 at the Emirates Stadium. In fact they were so good in the win over Chelsea that fans literally started salsa dancing in the stands.\n6. Manchester City (-)\nWas it good that Man City made Chelsea look like a competent football team on Saturday?\nProbably not, no.\nHowever, despite that, Pep Guardiola's side did manage to book their place in a second consecutive FA Cup final, and that's all that really counts.\n5. Bayern Munich (-)\nFor all their flaws this season, Bayern Munich have quietly began to hit their stride in recent weeks.\nKnocking out Arsenal in the Champions League was pretty game impressive, as was their 5-1 win over Union Berlin at the weekend.\nExpect their upcoming two-legged clash with Real Madrid to be an all-timer.\n4. Paris Saint-Germain (down 1)\nMuch like Bayern, Paris Saint-Germain are also finding form at the business end of the 2023/24 season.\nPowered by the best footballer in the world (Kylian Mbappe), PSG have actually won each of their last three games 4-1. That's pretty damn good if you ask us.\n3. Bayer Leverkusen (down 2)\nGoals in the 89th minute and 97th minute of games against West Ham United and Borussia Dortmund just about kept Bayer Leverkusen's unbeaten record in all competitions intact this past week.\nThey refuse to be beaten even when they're a bit hungover - you have to respect it.\n2. Real Madrid (-)\nDespite looking absolutely knackered after a gruelling 120 minutes up against Manchester City, Real Madrid's superstars - Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham - were able inspire their side to a famous El Clasico win over Barcelona.\nIt was a win that has all-but secured the La Liga title for Los Blancos, with Carlo Ancelotti's side now sitting 11 points clear atop of the table.\n1. Inter (up 8)\nSo what's better than all-but winning a league title with a win over your arch rivals?\nWell actually winning a league title with a win over your arch rivals of course!\nInter did exactly that on Monday night, winning a fiery Derby della Madonnina to secure a well-deserved 20th Scudetto, and nice new star above their club crest.",
