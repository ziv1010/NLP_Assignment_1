Manchester City, Liverpool, and Newcastle United have all registered their interest, holding preliminary discussions with Wharton’s representatives.\nLiverpool, in particular, are understood to be aggressive suitors, with sources suggesting they have held fresh talks and that Wharton himself is open to a move to Merseyside. Some outlets even claim the Reds are frontrunners, potentially offering a long-term contract to secure his services.\nNewcastle’s involvement adds further intrigue, as Eddie Howe’s side seek to bolster their engine room amid ambitions to break into the top four consistently.\nMan City, meanwhile, see Wharton as a potential long-term successor in their possession-based system and they are the side that other clubs fear in the race. With this in mind, everything points towards a furious\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?

However, with multiple elite clubs circling, negotiations promise to be protracted and costly. Landing a Champions League spot would help them massively as we’re told that, ideally, Wharton wants UCL football.\nAs the January window nears its end, attention turns to the summer, where Wharton’s next destination could reshape several Premier League midfields.\nLatest Man Utd news: New transfer ‘priority’ / Enquiry launched\nMeanwhile, my colleague, Dean Jones, has reported that United are considering signing a new left-back after Patrick Dorgu has thrived in his new role in attack.\nDorgu scored an incredible goal in United’s 3-2 victory away to Arsenal on Sunday – his second goal in as many games.\nThis could change the plans at Old Trafford, with the addition of a new left-back now described as a ‘priority.’\nIn other news, United have made an enquiry for Besiktas midfielder Wilfred Ndidi, our transfer insider, Graeme Bailey, has confirmed.\nIt is understood that the Red Devils have acted on advice given by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who believes the ex-Leicester man would be a good signing.",
