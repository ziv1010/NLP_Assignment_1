This is their first Champions League campaign.\nThey had not won a match in the main stage of the competition before City came into town – they ended up claiming one of the most famous results in their history.\nThough they had drawn against Tottenham earlier this season, and faced Spurs in the Europa League semi-final last term, they had never beaten an English side in six previous meetings.\nThey ended that run in astonishing fashion.\nThe home faithful at Aspymra Stadium, dressed in yellow and black, twirled their scarves as the three points ensured they remain in the competition before their final group game at Atletico Madrid next Wednesday.\nGlimt's league season ended in November, agonisingly losing the title by a point to Viking, so they have been well rested and not played in six weeks since a draw against Borussia Dortmund.\nBut two goals in the space of as many first-half minutes laid the platform for the triumph, and they could well have had more.\nHøjh was flagged for offside in the second half as he looked to complete a hat-trick – the Dane had scored only once in 16 games before coming up against City.\nGlimt's pace on the break was causing City all sorts of issues, and Hakon Evjen's low shot was pushed out by Donnarumma, while the Norwegian midfielder also had an effort ruled out for offside.\nBut in the end, it did not matter as the Glimt players warranted their victory to continue their fairytale story.\nMan City analysis: Miserable start to the year continues\nGuardiola's side had ended the old year with eight straight victories but have won only two of their seven games in 2026 - and have now suffered back-to-back defeats.\nCity were facing Norwegian opposition for the first time, but it turned into a nightmare trip to Bodo for City's inexperienced players.\nThe starting 11, with an average age of 24 years and 84 days, was the youngest City fielded in a Champions League match, and it showed as individual errors from Alleyne contributed to a humbling loss.\nJust like against United at Old Trafford at the weekend, City were being carved open at will and were fortunate not to concede more than the three they had done.\nHaaland's visit to his homeland was one to forget as he failed to score again, now without a goal from open play for a month, and just one penalty in his past eight games.\nCity have fallen off the pace in the Premier League, seven points adrift of Arsenal, and they have work to do next week to avoid dropping into the Champions League play-off places.\nLatest Stories\n-\nThis is not the time to settle political scores – Bawumia to government\n49 minutes -\n37% of SHS students exposed to drugs – Opare-Addo\n1 hour -\nNLC secures court injunction against striking tertiary unions\n2 hours -\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n2 hours -\nRed Notice cancellation: OSP official fires back at Ofori-Atta’s lawyers\n2 hours -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n3 hours -\nAAG raises alarm over billboard demolitions, calls for presidential intervention\n3 hours -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n4 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n4 hours -\nCocoa crisis, galamsey complicity and election credibility to dominate this Saturday’s Newsfile\n5 hours -\nINTERPOL deletes Red Notice for Ofori-Atta as extradition process continues — OSP confirms\n5 hours -\nMasterMinds resources positions itself as key player in skills development and workforce training\n6 hours -\nINTERPOL has deleted Ofori-Atta’s Red Notice – Lawyers\n7 hours -\nSteven Spielberg donates $25,000 to James Van Der Beek’s $2m GoFundMe\n7 hours -\nSix possible effects of Trump’s climate policy change\n8 hours",
