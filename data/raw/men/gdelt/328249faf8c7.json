Unfortunately, it didn’t happen. But yeah, my dream is to see him play for Chelsea because with his quality, I think he can adapt to Chelsea perfectly.’\nOn Delap’s struggles in west London, former Chelsea defender Gallas added: ‘I think he has to start taking more risks.\n‘He has to try to be the same player he was at Ipswich, where he scored goals. He looked like he was enjoying his football.\n‘I know when you move to another club, especially a big club, you get more pressure, you try to do everything right, but no, just be who you are and take some risks and nobody will tell you not to.’\nMore Trending\nChelsea lost to Leeds United in their penultimate Premier League game before a goalless draw with Bournemouth at the weekend.\nMaresca’s side were then beaten in the Champions League by Atalanta in a result that leaves their automatic qualification hopes hanging by a thread.\nChelsea will be desperate to return to winning ways on Saturday when they play host to Everton, who have enjoyed an impressive run to climb to seventh, one point behind the Blues.\nNicolas Jackson, now at Bayern Munich, scored the only goal in this fixture last season, while the away game at Goodison Park finished goalless.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Man Utd make decision on signing Real Madrid legend Sergio Ramos on free transfer\nMORE: Man Utd star branded ‘inconsistent’ with Spurs told to snub shock transfer move\nMORE: Paul Merson says Mikel Arteta decision could cost Arsenal the Premier League",
