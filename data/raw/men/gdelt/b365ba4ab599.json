We've got you covered. Fulham v West Ham isn't been shown on TV in the UK. In the UK from abroad? Use a VPN to watch the Premier League with your subscription from anywhere.\nWest Ham’s battle to retain their Premier League status continues with a trip to a Fulham side at risk of surrendering any hope of qualifying for Europe.\nThe Cottagers have enjoyed a strong season, but a four-match winless league run, including defeats in the last three, has left them in 10th place and seven points outside the top six.\nWest Ham showed encouraging signs by picking up four points against Aston Villa and Southampton, but a 5-1 home defeat to Newcastle in midweek was a confidence-smasher and leaves them teetering above the relegation zone only on goal difference.\nDavid Moyes’ side won the first meeting of the season between the sides, though, a 3-1 victory in London in October.\nKick-off is at 3.000pm BST. Make sure you know how to watch the Premier League wherever you are.\nTeam news\nMarco Silva has named the following Fulham starting 11: (4-2-3-1) Bernd Leno; Cedric Soares, Tim Ream, Antonee Robinson; Harrison Reed, Joao Palhinha; Bobby Decordova-Reid, Andreas Pereira, Willian; Carlos Vinicius\nDavid Moyes has selected the following West Ham starting 11: (4-4-2) Lukasz Fabianski; Vladimir Coufal, Kurt Zouma, Angelo Ogbonna, Aaron Cresswell; Pablo Fornals, Declan Rice, Tomas Soucek, Jarrod Bowen; Michail Antonio, Danny Ings\nForm\nFulham: LLLLW\nWest Ham: LWWDW\nReferee\nJarred Gillett is the referee for Fulham v West Ham.\nStadium\nFulham v West Ham will be played at Craven Cottage in London.\nKick-off and channel\nFulham v West Ham isn't being televised in the UK. It kicks off at 3.00pm BST.\nVPN guide\nUse a VPN to watch Premier League football from outside your country\nIf you’re out of the country for a Premier League fixture, then you won't be able to watch on your domestic streaming service as usual. The broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!) and blocks you from watching it. You can use a VPN to get around that, though, without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and will let you watch. And all the info going between is entirely encrypted, anonymous and safe – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there. For the Premier League, FourFourTwo currently recommends:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS5 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price. Go get it!\nInternational Premier League TV rights\n• UK: Sky Sports and BT Sport are the two main players once again, but Amazon also have a slice of the pie in 2022/23.\n• USA: NBC Sports Group are the Premier League rights holders, with the Peacock Premium streaming platform showing even more than the 175 games it aired last season. If you pick up a fuboTV subscription for the games not on Peacock Premium, you'll be able to watch every game.\n• Canada: The way to watch Premier League football in 2022/23 is fuboTV, which has exclusive rights to all the action.\n• Australia: Optus Sport will screen every game of the Premier League season. Non-subscribers can access the action via a Fetch TV box and other friendly streaming devices.\n• New Zealand: Sky Sport are serving up all 380 games – plus various highlights and magazine shows throughout the week, as well as the Champions League.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nAlasdair Mackenzie is a freelance journalist based in Rome, and a FourFourTwo contributor since 2015.
