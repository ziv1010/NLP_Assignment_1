For Mbappe, the bonus was worth 500,000 euros (£438,000) a month.\nReports picked up on clauses that required Neymar to show \"courtesy, friendliness and availability to supporters\". He was also expected to \"greet fans before and after each game\".\nThe truth behind the ethics bonus is very different.\nWhat is an 'ethics bonus'?\nIn English football, clubs are able to fine a player up to two weeks' wages for a misdemeanour.\nFrench law forbids any deductions from a worker's salary. Sports teams, therefore, make a small portion of it an ethics bonus. The base wage and the ethics bonus are in effect a player's total salary.\nIn 2021, it was claimed in some reports that Neymar received extra money for clapping the fans, but the details paint a different picture.\nNeymar was expected to behave responsibly to sponsors and referees. He had to turn up to training on time and was barred from placing bets. In effect, it was a moral code.\n\"Clubs are very keen to protect their image,\" football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport.\n\"They don't want anybody going nuclear and criticising the club, which means that they call them good behaviour clauses.\n\"We saw similar with Tiger Woods and Lance Armstrong [who had morals clauses with sponsors]. So behavioural clauses are quite common within sport.\"\nIn 2018, Marco Verratti had part of his ethics bonus withheld after being caught drink-driving.\nHatem Ben Arfa also lost the bonus when he failed to attend PSG's mid-season training camp in Qatar.\nIn 2023, Lionel Messi was punished by PSG after making an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia.\nRugby union club Racing 92 took action against winger Teddy Thomas by \"retaining his ethics bonus for February\" after an incident following a Six Nations match between France and Scotland.\nStar players can earn 'another 40%' in bonus payments\nBonuses are now a large part of a player's contract. They cover loyalty payments, received each year on the anniversary of a player joining a club, through to image rights and goal bonuses.\n\"The contract, which used to be written on the back of a napkin, is now an investment by a series of stakeholders,\" Maguire said.\n\"You've got the club, you've got the agent, you've got the management company, you've got the player. And quite often, the player's intellectual property rights company as well.\n\"I've seen some of the big six contracts, and there are 25% uplifts for Champions League participation.\"\nThe world's best players are in such high demand they could earn huge top-ups through their image rights, as high as \"60% basic and another 40% on top of that\", Maguire added.\nLatest Stories\n-\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n28 minutes -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n54 minutes -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n56 minutes -\nNSA introduces dual authentication system for 2025/26 enrolment exercise\n2 hours -\nFuel prices to increase from Feb. 16, influenced by cedi’s depreciation\n2 hours -\nGNFS to launch automated fire safety compliance system to modernise regulation\n3 hours -\nNALAG president commends Local Gov’t Minister for payment of assembly members’ allowances\n3 hours -\nIs having a physical security operations center in your business worth it?\n3 hours -\nAsiedu Nketia recounts fierce political wars in Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam constituency\n3 hours -\nNRSA sets up committee to probe road crashes involving Toyota Voxy\n3 hours -\nCocoa farmers decry the adverse impact of producer price cut on livelihoods\n3 hours -\nFamilies who lose relatives to ‘no bed syndrome’ must sue health facilities – Dr. Nawaane\n3 hours -\nGhana Sports Fund: Dr. David Kofi Wuaku outlines vision for Youth Empowerment growth through sports\n3 hours -\nNUGS President urges sustainable digital governance\n4 hours -\nNational Investment Bank kicks off Ghana Sports Fund with landmark seed donation\n4 hours",
