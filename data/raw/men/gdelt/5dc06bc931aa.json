  "body_text": "Chelsea are interested in signing the Lazio defender Mario Gila at the end of the season.\nThe 24-year-old has done quite well for the Italian club, and a report from Fichajes claims that Chelsea have identified him as a target this summer. They were keen on signing the Bournemouth defender Dean Huijsen, but the player has agreed to join Real Madrid for £50 million.\nIt seems that Chelsea have switched their attention towards the Spanish defender. It remains to be seen whether they can get a deal for the 24-year-old across the line. He is valued at €30 million, and Chelsea certainly have the finances to get the deal done. The reported asking price seems reasonable for a player of his quality, and he could easily justify the investment in the near future.\nThe player has been linked with Tottenham and Manchester City as well.\nChelsea need Mario Gila\nChelsea have looked vulnerable at the back this season, and they need to bring in quality defenders this summer. They must plug the gaps in their squad in order to do well next year. They are pushing for Champions League qualification, and they will be hoping to push for major trophies. A quality defender could make a big difference for them. The likes of Benoit Badiashile could be shown the door in the summer, and Wesley Fofana has struggled with persistent injury problems.\nInvesting in a quality central defender will be a priority for Chelsea this summer.\nLazio star could fancy Premier League move\nMeanwhile, the 24-year-old could be attracted to the idea of joining Chelsea as well. They are one of the biggest clubs in the world, and they could provide him with the platform to fight for trophies regularly. Regular football in England could help him improve further and fulfil his potential as well.\nIt remains to be seen whether Chelsea comes forward with an official offer to sign the player.",
