  "body_text": "Who Arsenal could face in the 2024/25 Champions League round of 16\n- Arsenal finished third in Champions League's inaugural league phase\n- The Gunners will be paired with one of four clubs in the round of 16\n- Mikel Arteta's side aren't now back in European action until March\nArsenal's place in the top eight of Champions League was all but guaranteed before they travelled to Spain for their European closer, but victory over Girona on Wednesday night could prove to be decisive in the weeks to come.\nHad a rotated Gunners team not secured a 2-1 win in Catalonia, Mikel Arteta's side could feasibly have slipped all the way down to eighth place - rather than the lofty third which they actually recorded. That would not only have dramatically altered their potential opponents in the round of 16, but for the rest of the knockout stages.\nIn reality, Ethan Nwaneri picked out the bottom corner and Raheem Sterling was only allowed to take one penalty, securing a relatively favourable lineup of foes.\nArsenal's potential Champions League round of 16 opponents\nArsenal will find themselves pitted against one of AC Milan, PSV Eindhoven, Feyenoord or Juventus.\nBoth traditional Italian giants are some way short of their historic best. While Milan have been forced to sack Paulo Fonseca - who found out about his dismissal from journalists in the club car park - after slipping out of the Serie A title race, Juve's Thiago Motta hasn't universally impressed in Turin.\nFeyenoord have struggled for consistency since Arne Slot's departure in the summer, while PSV proved their threat by beating the Dutchman's (heavily rotated) Liverpool side in the final round of European fixtures.\nJuventus will take on PSV, with Feyenoord taking on Milan.\nWhen will Arsenal know their Champions League opponents?\nFriday's draw was only for the knockout phase play-offs - which will be played on 11/12 February and 18/19 February. Once the winners of those eight ties have been decided, a draw for the round of 16 will take place on 21 February 2025.\nThat ball-juggling ceremony in Switzerland will also set the bracket for the quarter- and semi-finals, revealing every potential opponent Arsenal will have to face in a hypothetical route to the final at Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena in May.\nWhen is the Champions League round of 16?\nArsenal's February is devoid of European football. The first legs of the last 16 will be held on 4/5 March before the return fixture one week later on 11/12 March.\nThe Gunners are currently scheduled to face Manchester United at Old Trafford in the Premier League on the weekend between those two European legs. Arteta's side travelled to the home of Manchester City between their round of 16 ties last season and were held to a goalless draw at the Etihad which ultimately cost them the Premier League title.",
