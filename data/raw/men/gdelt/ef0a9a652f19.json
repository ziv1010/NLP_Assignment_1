  "body_text": "As Erik Ten Hag struggles to improve every area of his squad he is most worried about two of his quality world class players. Casimero is one of the best defenders I have had the privilege to watch. Marcus Rashford was always exciting, moving forward and could beat defences and score goals. Together they formed the focal points of United’s revival period. What has happened to both of them, playing without confidence, easily dispossessed and losing tackles and focus? Ten Hag is under pressure to drop both and 12 months ago that would have been unthinkable. He has an alternative for Rashford in Alejandro Garnacho and the youngster was impressive against Brentford. Casimero is different and United have no one who can completely replace the defensive midfielder. Sofyan Amrabat was signed as cover for Casimero but Ten Hag is seriously considering drafting him into the starting line-up as a replacement for the away game at Bramall Lane against Sheffield United after the international break. Casemiro’s form has been worrying for some time and his performances well below what we know he is capable of. Against Brentford he was careless with the ball and lost it several times making poor judgement passes. The coach took him off at half time which for a player of his reputation, experience and ability is embarrassing. Although only 31 years of age but slowing down, he was still able to control midfield by reading the game more than being athletic and speedy. Opposition players are targeting him as a weakness…perhaps Real Madrid anticipated this would happen when they shocked the football world by selling him. Amrabat looked a very competent player in the second half against Brentford making 64 attempted passes and finding his target 94% of the time. He also had 75 touches of the ball. Ten Hag admits Amrabat’s true test will come when he completes a full 90 minutes.\nKlopp despairs at set-piece nightmare\nAgainst Brighton Jurgen Klopp was furious inside his technical area after the Red’s gave away yet another free kick. Brighton’s Solly March took the kick and his captain Lewis Dunk put the ball into the net with only 12 minutes to go and earned the Seagull’s a draw. Klopp could not hide his disappointment. Only four clubs have given committed more fouls in the Premier League. Klopp said, “Defensively we should not have allowed them so many set-pieces and we definitely would have had more chances. That is one area we have to improve. It is difficult to defend all of them and we did defend nearly of them but one is enough.” Now the coach has to wait until next week after the international break to once again work with his defence in training to practice over and again defending from set pieces. Most of his squad are on international duties.\nBig Mac serves up a double whopper\nRivers United pip Remo Stars 2-0 in rescheduled fixture\nOur ambassadors are role models to young Nigerians – Glo\nErik Ten Hag had Scott McTominay earmarked for the exit door in January. He would have gone in the summer had a big enough offer arrived in the postbox. Everything has now changed and Ten Hag was first to praise his midfielder for his performance against Brentford, even scoring in extra time. McTominay arrived on the pitch in the 87th minute for Sofyan Amrabat and he scored twice to give United victory. After the game Ten Hag said, “Every player has his price (£45m) but Scott has a big value, sporting and also economic. No one matched that value and I am happy to have a player like him in the squad. He is Man Utd in every way. Every minute he will fight for the team.”\nWhy the Gunners are stronger this season\nFrom my point of view the only good thing about an international break is that it gives me more time to talk to people inside the clubs because many of the players are away with their national teams and assistants, trainers and staff have more time to talk. It seemed a good opportunity to explore why and how Arsenal are stronger this season. Beating Manchester City for the first time in 15 matches is an indication of their progress under Mikel Arteta. At the end of last season Arteta addressed his team in their hotel before the last game away at Nottingham Forest. He sensed the disappointment in his players. Five days earlier he had witnessed his team’s collapse against Brighton which more or less ended Arsenal’s dream title win. The Gunners consequently lost 1-0 at Forest’s City Ground.\nWill Arsenal last the distance this time?\nArteta’s team are definitely better this season. In the match against Manchester City, William Saliber shackled Erling Haaland and he never got a shot away at goal. A back injury had put Saliber out of the team last time around. Many inside the club believe his absence had doomed their final efforts. Arteta studied City’s structure and as a result moved Jorginho in next to Declan Rice and they effectively shut the door on through passes to Haaland who was taken out of the game for much of the match.\nArteta and sporting director Edu have also gone for bigger players this year. Kai Havertz is 6ft 4ins and Declan Rice 6ft 1ins. They believed the Gunners lacked physical presence last year and needed more power and height to improve the team. Gabriel Jesus, Eddie Nketiah and Havertz have done well so far this season but the possible addition of adding Brentford’s Ivan Toney in January would make them a foot taller and the Gunner’s believe the transfer is likely to happen. Having spent £200m many at the club are worried there might not be enough cash in the bank to pay around £80m for Toney. Also, that amount will limit what the club are allowed to spend next summer.\nNowhere to go for Phillips at City\nCovering for Rodri, arguably Manchester City’s most important player, has meant Kalvin Phillips has been confined to the bench for much of his light blue’s career. Rodri’s suspension for a foolish push on Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White’s throat meant that Kalvin had a chance to shine for three games. Those games are now finished but Pep Guardiola is still not convinced he is good enough to start each game. In truth Kalvin has been okay but not outstanding. Against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup he didn’t do very much, just enough. He was not selected against Wolves because Rico Lewis was excellent against Leipzig in the Champions League where he played with Rodri. Against Wolves Mateo Kovacic played alongside Matheus Nunes and neither played well but instead of turning to Phillips, coach Guardiola brought on teenager Oscar Bobb. Lewis was again selected against Arsenal and Kovacic was used again with Bernardo moving into a more defensive midfield. Guardiola said he crowded the midfield to make up for the loss of Rodri which he considered a better option than trusting Phillips. It is almost impossible to think Phillips will be given many more opportunities and a transfer in January looks like his best option.\nBad news on Chelsea’s Chilwell\nChelsea’s Coach Mauricio Pochettino has commented on Ben Chilwell’s injury and said, “I think it is bad news. The doctor told me it is a bad injury but we need to assess it in the next few days and we’ll see the period he is going to be out of the squad.” Ben’s injury has now been scanned and the results are, as expected, not encouraging. It is likely he will be missing from the team for the next couple of months. Pochettino does have options at left back however and he pointed out that Marc Cucurella has been used as cover for right-back Malo Gusto’s suspension and Reece James’ injury whilst Ian Maatsen has been limited to playing further up field.\nUPDATE NEWS:\nNigerians can now invest ₦2.5 million on premium domains and profit about ₦17-₦25 million.
