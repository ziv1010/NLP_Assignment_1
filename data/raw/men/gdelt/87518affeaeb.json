The French team demolished Inter and won the Champions League final with a resounding 5-0 that overwhelmed Simone Inzaghi's team. The author of this masterpiece is Luis Enrique, the coach of the Parisians, who now wins his second Treble as a coach. Luis Enrique dedicated the historic victory to his daughter Xana. 'She is with me,' said the PSG coach, who faced a painful loss, losing his little daughter of only nine years in 2019. After the victory, Luis Enrique wore a black shirt with a drawing of him and his daughter (cartoonized like the foundation's symbol) planting a PSG flag on the field. An image that replicates what Luis Enrique and little Xana did in Berlin after Barcelona's victory. Born in Gijon (Spain) on May 8, 1970, Luis Enrique is a former footballer now coaching PSG. As a midfielder, he wore the national team jersey, distinguishing himself in Spanish clubs: from 1991 to 1996, he played for Real Madrid, winning a La Liga title, a Copa del Rey, and a Spanish Super Cup. Subsequently, from 1996 to 2004, he played for Barcelona, winning two national championships, two Copa del Reys, a Spanish Super Cup, as well as the Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup. Arriving in Rome thanks to American ownership in the summer of 2011, his adventure in the capital was troubled with a seventh place that led to his dismissal just ten months after the announcement. A mixed squad arrived on the market, with promising young players and experienced ones. The most anticipated signing was Bojan Krkic, a protégé of Luis Enrique, who arrived from Barcelona with the label of 'new Messi.' In addition to Bojan, Lamela and Pjanic also arrived, among others. The start was not the best with the early elimination in the Europa League preliminaries at the hands of Slovan Bratislava. In the league, the situation did not improve with the tiki-taka imposed by the coach not taking off and leading Roma to some painful defeats (Cagliari at home or derby with Lazio). At the end of the season, Roma totaled fourteen defeats in the league with Luis Enrique becoming the target of fan criticism and, also for this reason, Luis Enrique decided to resign, giving up a year of salary after failing to qualify Roma for European cups. After experiences at the helm of clubs like Roma, from 2014 to 2017 he led Barcelona, achieving a rich trophy cabinet that includes the Spanish championship in 2015 and 2016, the Copa del Rey on three consecutive occasions from 2015 to 2017, the Champions League and the UEFA Super Cup in 2015, as well as the Club World Cup in the same year. Between 2018 and 2022, with a break due to his resignation, he was the coach of the Spanish national team. Since 2023 he has been on the bench of Paris Saint-Germain, with which he has already won the French Super Cup in 2023 and, in 2024, both the French Cup and the national championship. 'I remember an incredible photo at the Champions League final in Berlin, where Xana plants a Barcelona flag. I have the desire to do the same with Paris Saint-Germain. My daughter will not be there physically, but she will be spiritually.' These are the words spoken a few months ago by Luis Enrique, coach of PSG, who, in a press conference, looked forward to the Champions League final on May 31 with the aim of dedicating the victory to his daughter who passed away prematurely years ago. Today his PSG is the champion of Europe and Luis Enrique, who has achieved his second Treble of his career, can dedicate the cup to his little daughter. To understand the emotion and words of Luis Enrique, it is necessary to go back in time to the 2015 Champions League final, Barcelona-Juventus, a match won by the Blaugrana team. After the European success, Luis Enrique, coach of Barcelona with Messi-Suarez-Neymar, was joined on the field by his family and celebrated the European victory together with his daughter Xana, a child who in 2015 was 5 years old. Many will remember the images of the coach playing with his daughter and watching her wave the Barcelona flag with Catalan inserts. A few years after the success with Barcelona, Luis Enrique, who in the meantime had become the coach of Spain, experienced the greatest pain a parent can ever experience by losing his daughter Xana prematurely, who died at 9 years old in 2019 after a tough battle against osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor). Luis Enrique, who personally communicated the grave loss, was overwhelmed by messages of condolence from the entire football world and, after a physiological break, returned to the field leading Spain first and now PSG. Now that the Asturian coach has won the Champions League, his words, prophetic but not too much, bring to mind those images from Berlin. 'We are a team used to playing finals, these are situations we have already experienced. Motivation is important, but we are used to it,' warned Luis Enrique to the Nerazzurri. The French eliminated Brest, Liverpool, Aston Villa, and Arsenal: 'Football culture is universal, it is not about nationality. We have overcome a French team, the English ones, now we face Inter, which is a team with great qualities, knows how to attack well, but also defend when it does not have the ball. It is a complete team,' continued the Asturian. PSG will not change its way of playing: 'The idea is to prepare for any type of match. It is a final, we prepare to have possession and manage the game. Playing against two forwards changes something? Yes, especially in pressing. Inter moves the ball well, I don't want to change our offensive phase, but we will have to be careful about several things, as always.'\n© ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\nThis article is automatically translated",
