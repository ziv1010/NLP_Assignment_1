  "body_text": "It is that time of the year where we predict the upcoming season, including Premier League predictions this week. Just to clarify, I will review these predictions after the transfer window closes as I think a lot of the division will do serious business in the last couple of weeks of the market. I actually see a lot of clubs stagnating.\nArsenal – 3rd\nIn terms of finding someone likely to score over 20 league goals, Viktor Gyökeres was the best Arsenal could have got in the market (that was before it became clear that Isak was willing to force a move out of Newcastle). Unless another signing is made, Mikel Arteta might need to change his tactics to convert possession into chances.\nThe Gunners became too conservative last season and are no longer the most entertaining team to watch. Too many fixtures we did not work the opposition keeper enough. There is a question mark if our manager will let his ego admit his mistakes and learn from them, or do we get another campaign of blaming officials and making up conspiracy theories?\nThat is ultimately why in the league I do not think we will get over the line. A divide is returning in our fanbase, it once again does not take long for anxiety to creep around the Emirates and, with a slow start (we do begin with tough away games), there will be an overreaction among Gooners. Not enough to bother the Kroenke family, who will be content with another year of Champions League revenue, but we start without that feel-good atmosphere of recent years.\nAston Villa – 8th\nLosing on the final day of last season at Old Trafford, days after Man United had lost the Europa League final, was such a missed opportunity for Aston Villa and it has hurt them on and off the pitch. Missing out on Champions League revenue means Unai Emery needs to sell a star name to buy, meaning you could argue the club start the new season with a weaker squad than last campaign, with Rashford and Asensio’s loans not made permanent.\nLogically that means a smaller squad will struggle even more juggling Europe with domestic football. However, it is more likely they lift the Europa League than finish in the top four, so yet again dropped points in the league might be accepted if it means another European adventure. If Spurs can finish 17th but call their season a success because they won UEFA’s secondary cup, then why can’\nt Villa?\nBournemouth – 13th\nIt is a compliment to how well they did last season that, as I write this, the Cherries are on the brink of losing the fourth member of their starting back five. While it means they will start this campaign with gaps in their back four, I expect them to spend the money they have recouped in the next few weeks.\nThat is because they have kept their biggest asset in Andoni Iraola, who you can trust to yet again scout gems from around the world who suit his style. Even if there is a period of transition, they have kept their attackers. Semenyo, Kluivert and Evanilson will score enough goals to keep them away from a proper relegation fight.\nBrentford – 20th\nJust because of the size of their club, there was always going to be a year where eventually everything caught up with Brentford. They have lost their top scorer from last season, their second highest is about to leave, their captain has left (Christian Norgaard signed for The Gunners this summer), but most damaging of all, they have lost their manager of seven years.\nThomas Frank has been the glue that has held everything together at the Bees since they were in the Championship. Few bosses influence a whole club like the Dane does. So, however Matthew Benham responded this summer, it would be almost impossible for his club not to look vulnerable. Yet so far his response seems to have been to collect the money, which in the worst case will compensate lost revenue due to relegation, at which point he gets the parachute payments.\nHe could be waiting for the last weeks of the window of course, but replacing Thomas Frank with set-piece coach Keith Andrews does not fill you with confidence. It could be another masterstroke from the club, but I am not so sure.\nBrighton – 7th\nThere was a point in the race for Europe in the run-in where Brighton looked the most likely to be able to put a winning run together. They never recovered from losing the FA Cup quarter-finals on penalties, but finishing just a point behind their record total was a decent debut from the youngest manager in the division’s history.\nFabian Hürzeler had to deal with injuries and new signings settling in, with a suggestion that they will be even better now they have had time to adjust. The Seagulls’ quality recruitment team has been on display again, making a huge profit on João Pedro and replacing him with Charalampos Kostoulas. The 18-year-old has a huge reputation in Greece and can learn from Danny Welbeck.\nBurnley – 18th\nThe Clarets’ latest attempt at top-flight football will almost be in complete contrast to the last time they were promoted. Three years ago, Vincent Kompany lifted the Championship thanks to a brand of attacking football. It is an ethos the Belgian refused to change even when his young squad were struggling to get results.\nThis time around it is almost the complete opposite principles at Turf Moor. Scott Parker got 101 points last season based on his pragmatic approach. Even though that has been hurt by the loss of James Trafford and Egan Riley, being hard to break down will be the approach to avoiding relegation. Ironically, that probably means they will not be as entertaining to watch as the last time they were in the Premier League, but they will be harder to beat.\nChelsea – 4th\nChelsea remind me of Arsenal when Mikel Arteta became a manager. Enzo Maresca has a young squad who will only get better, yet there will be moments of inconsistency as they learn. While some will downplay lifting the UEFA Conference and even the Club World Cup, it can only help a youthful dressing room gain confidence.\nI think their fanbase are more confident than in previous seasons. They can possibly flirt with a title challenge but lack the keeper and manager to get over the line.\nCrystal Palace – 12th\nThey should find out on Monday if they are playing in the Europa League or UEFA Conference this season. Either way, they have known since lifting the FA Cup that they will be in Europe, so it is bizarre a small squad has not been improved.\nOliver Glasner himself has questioned the lack of activity, which will worry Eagles fans as their manager has less than a year left on his contract. The assumption is they are waiting late in the window to do their business to see what deals are left and if Eze and Guehi are still at Selhurst Park.\nSteve Parish has shown in the past though he will not be bullied. One of the good guys in the sport, the owner will not do anything that leaves their place in the top flight vulnerable. Remember, they did not win any of their first nine Premier League fixtures last year and ended up with their best ever campaign, so there is no need to panic if things start a bit slow. They currently do not have the squad to handle the Thursday-Sunday schedule, but surely a few dropped positions in the league is worth a European adventure? Will Arsenal relieve them of Eberechi Eze?\nEverton – 11th\nLeaving Goodison Park and the number of contracts expired meant this was always going to be a period of transition for Everton. Based on numbers, they need to do more business in the next few weeks.\nGooners will know from experience it will also take time to adjust to playing at a new home. That is why David Moyes was just a brilliant appointment, because on and off the pitch he brings calmness. While he will never offer the most exciting brand of football, his man management skills will keep them comfortable in mid-table. If the new owners could find some money for him, he might even surprise a few people.\nFulham – 10th\nCurrently the team that has done the least business in terms of outgoings or incomings (they have done well so far to keep hold of Robinson). It should be stressed they often wait late in the window to do deals, but so far have mostly been linked with loans.\nIn the short term that leaves them as a good footballing team who play an attractive style and who, on their day, can beat anyone. Long term though, fans are worried that it is a reflection of the club no longer being a priority to their owners. Next season will stand still, but longer term it could be an issue.\nLeeds – 19th\nFor two seasons running, not only did all promoted teams go directly back down, but it happened with a whimper. This time round the three clubs coming up from the Championship have contrasting strategies to avoid relegation. Leeds seem to be taking the Moneyball approach, putting a lot of emphasis on players with height so they can match opponents physically.\nIt means while there will be a lack of top-flight experience, it is a squad, if nothing else, that will not get bullied. Do they have that player though who can get into double digits? It is easy for owners to get carried away once they see the money on offer in the top division.\nThere is nothing wrong with the 49ers having ambition, but it has to be realistic. There were whispers they were going to sack Daniel Farke despite winning the Championship with 100 points. They cannot panic and change managers at the first sign of trouble just to adopt a new approach. They probably will though.\nLiverpool – 2nd\nWhisper it quietly, but I never thought Liverpool were great champions last season. They simply had a gap at Christmas and no one put them under any pressure, which is a shame as for two years running they physically tired during the run-in.\nThere will be a campaign where age catches up with Salah and Van Dijk, although Arne Slot mastered the tactic of keeping the Egyptian up the pitch and only involved in the attacking third.\nIt is funny how many Gooners are suddenly downplaying how good Isak is. In reality, we would be buzzing in May if someone offered you the Newcastle striker on top of Wirtz, Frimpong and Kerkez, making the Reds stronger than this time last year. A talent worth over £110 million once guaranteed you the title. An Mbappé would do that, I am not sure an Isak does.\nIf he fires you to another Premier League title, he justifies the fee I guess. If he does not, it is a huge waste of money. I think Liverpool call the Toon’s bluff in the last days of the window, certainly not before they play each other.\nMan United – 5th\nMan United remind me of the state Arsenal were in when Mikel Arteta became manager. The first part in finding any solution is admitting there is a problem, which means accepting you have to go through some ugly times to get to happier days.\nWith Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Amorim, I think they are willing to go through the process, but are all fans? For a team with zero European football, they could not have recruited a better front three, which at least means the team will believe they can score goals again. With their keepers and defenders, there will still be inconsistencies, but the first target has to be enjoying their football again and making Old Trafford a tough place to visit.\nMan City – 1st\nLet us make it clear, after four titles in a row and five out of the last six, the likes of De Bruyne and Kyle Walker had earned the right to prove it was not one season too many. Their owners responded in January and the summer with smart signings like Reijnders and Cherki, but it is out of possession they need to drastically improve.\nAs good as Rodri is, the injury to one player cannot explain the mistakes City were suddenly making in defence and how easy it was to run at them. Football goes in cycles even for the very best teams, and it is almost like the rest of the division has learnt how to combat Pep Guardiola.\nOf course, the Spaniard has the ability to adapt his tactics, but the biggest question mark is does he have the energy to rebuild another side? His attention to detail is almost obsessive and he has been so successful for so long that we almost take for granted, physically and mentally, how much it takes to be as successful as he has.\nThis is a man who had to walk away from Barcelona because he could not emotionally give any more. There were signs last season that the 54-year-old was reaching that point. When you are lifting trophies you can find that lift, it is harder when things start to go against you. Do not forget, Mr Guardiola is not used to chasing.\nNewcastle – 9th\nAs I write this, Newcastle have rejected an offer of £110 million for Isak, but Eddie Howe is talking like a man who does not expect the striker to be playing for the Magpies next weekend.\nThe club have to be careful. While they do not need the money and it would be a blow to their new image to sell their best player, you need to be careful rejecting over £100 million for someone who does not want to be there. It is not like if they force the Swede to stay, that guarantees a place in the top four.\nIn 12 months’ time, they could be without UEFA revenue and the striker’s value reduced. So surely they have to sell? Unless the 25-year-old is tactically trying to get some sort of promise that he can move next summer? Why else would he wait for Arsenal and Liverpool to buy forwards before making a noise?\nEven before this saga, it has not been the window Geordies assumed. Big names have rejected a move to Tyneside, meaning a small squad will struggle to juggle the European and domestic schedule. That cost them the last time they were in the Champions League.\nIt is almost like lifting the Carabao Cup did not make the Toon Army the massive club they assumed. Once the best fanbase in the land, I have zero sympathy. If their manager is smart, he has one eye on after the World Cup in 12 months when the FA will have a vacancy. He has hit the glass ceiling at St James’ Park and cannot take them any further.\n£120-150 million lets them bring in new faces, but they start the campaign with the mood low and it might take a few months to regroup. Who thought we would be saying that in May?\nN Forest – 15th\nNear the end of last season, opposition worked out how to play against Nuno Santos’s tactics. They became the classic example of not needing a lot of possession to win games, often soaking up pressure and hitting opponents on the break. It often means if they concede first, they do not know how to respond.\nWhatever UEFA competition they play in, it is unlikely they will match last year’s finish. Yet will their owner understand that a small squad might struggle to juggle a European campaign with the domestic schedule?\nWhere most would, you could envisage Evangelos Marinakis getting impatient and acting with impulse.\nSpurs – 6th\nI will never forget Spurs losing 4-1 at home on the final day of last season to finish 17th and Ange Postecoglou having the audacity to call that a great season just because he had lifted UEFA’s secondary competition.\nDaniel Levy saved football by making it clear a club that size cannot be saying 38 points is acceptable based on what you do in another cup. That would mean as soon as Aston Villa get 40 points, Unai Emery should play the kids in the league and only focus on Europe.\nOne of the good guys of the sport, there are so many things Thomas Frank will do differently to Big Ange. He will not have his defenders’ starting position so high up the pitch, he will tactically work on set pieces in both boxes, and he will not refuse to try something else if his system is constantly not working.\nCrucially though, the Dane has man management skills where he will not panic and will bring calmness to a dressing room, blocking outside noise. Noise that might come from within when some point out if he fails to win a trophy like the man he has replaced. What he will do is finish dramatically higher up the table.\nSunderland – 17th\nIt is rare that out of the three promoted sides, the play-off winners would start as the best bet out of the three to avoid relegation. That sounds backwards considering they finished 24 points behind Leeds and Burnley, but the Black Cats might look unrecognisable from last season, especially in midfield.\nA new team who mostly have not played together before, with the majority never having played at this level, is of course a gamble. Yet so many come up from the Championship content to take the money, with the worst-case scenario being they get parachute payments.\nSpending approximately £140 million, Sunderland very early on decided to give this campaign a proper swing. That means the Mackems start off upbeat and positive. Trust me, create a feel-good factor at the Stadium of Light and it becomes a tough ground to visit.\nWest Ham – 14th\nBased on the job he did at Brighton, I thought Graham Potter would be the perfect fit for West Ham, but it became crystal clear that the 50-year-old’s confidence has been burnt at Chelsea.\nAccused of being too nice at the Bridge, it is almost like at the London Stadium he is intentionally being grumpy for the sake of grumpiness. Hammers fans are frustrated that David Sullivan is again acting like director of football, finding value such as offering Callum Wilson a pay-as-you-play deal.\nThey seem like a club standing still though, which will eventually catch up with them, although you have to be quite bad to be in the bottom three. I am not sure the Irons can play a brand of football that will make up for the obvious stagnation off the pitch. Although given how they treated David Moyes, I have little sympathy.\nWolves – 16th\nVítor Pereira has done such a great job as Wolves manager that it has often gone unnoticed that the club were 19th in the table when he arrived in December, yet finished 17 points away from the relegation zone.\nIt became clear the longer the Portuguese worked with his squad on the training pitch, the better they became, and he will benefit from having a whole pre-season. It is only because of the 57-year-old that I think they will avoid the bottom three.\nHe has lost 31 direct goal contributions thanks to the departures of Cunha and Aït-Nouri, while replacing them with talent who need time to settle. Yet he was already working on making his team more of a unit and not relying on one talent.\nLet me know your predictions, peeps.\nAs ever, be respectful to each other’s opinions.\nJust a bit of fun.\n(Will most likely change at the end of the window.)\nDan Smith\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nADMIN COMMENT\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.
