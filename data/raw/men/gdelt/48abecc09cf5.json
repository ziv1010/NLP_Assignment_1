  "body_text": "If there is one thing Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital have proven since taking over Chelsea last summer, it is that they know how to buy footballers.\nNow, after committing more than £500million ($609.4m) to initial transfer fees across their jaw-dropping first two windows, the emphasis shifts as attention turns to the next one at the end of this season. How well can they sell?\nAdvertisement\nOffloading those on the fringes of Graham Potter’s bloated first-team squad and the more high-profile names currently out on loans will be a monetary as well as a sporting imperative in the summer.\nIt might even become essential to their hopes of remaining compliant with financial fair play (FFP) if, as expected, Champions League qualification proves out of reach for a side currently 10 points off the top four — UEFA is already watching the club’s movements closely.\nBoehly and Clearlake believe the depictions of the financial risk they have taken during these first seven months of ownership are overstated. Most of Chelsea’s new signings are young, (presumably) improving assets now tied to long-term contracts on low salaries relative to their Roman Abramovich-era standards, with compensation also tied to playing time and Champions League participation.\nInternally, there has been a lot of emphasis on the “Chelsea premium” that the club became notorious for paying under the previous regime, both in terms of transfer fees and wages.\nBoehly and Clearlake might have smashed the British transfer record to bring Enzo Fernandez to Stamford Bridge for £106m and sanctioned huge fees for Wesley Fofana (£70m) and Mykhailo Mudryk (an initial £62m), but the new owners are adamant these deals fit into a broader push to bring the wage bill down to a more sensible, sustainable level.\nFor that push to be successful, however, they will also need to find new homes for a significant number of Abramovich signings who are on “Chelsea premium” contracts that still have several years left to run.\nThis process began last summer, with Timo Werner allowed to return to RB Leipzig in a £25million deal that represents a significant loss on the £47.5m initially paid to secure the Germany forward from that Bundesliga club two years earlier.\nIn terms of how clubs actually account for transfers, Chelsea’s margins were much finer than that.\nWerner’s original fee was amortised over the length of his five-year contract — in this case, at a rate of £9.5million per year — meaning that, by the time he was sold, his remaining value on the books was just £28.5m. Since the £25m sale fee was registered in one immediate lump sum, the accounting loss for Boehly and Clearlake was only £3.5m.\nAdvertisement\nWhen you add to that the benefit of offloading Werner’s huge wages and freeing up room for new signings, it was clearly a deal worth Chelsea stomaching a little financial pain to do.\nThat cannot be so easily said for some of the other sunk-cost decisions that lie ahead.\nRomelu Lukaku (remember him?) remains the biggest headache.\nHis previous club Inter Milan have no obligation to extend an expensive season-long loan that has so far seen him make only 11 appearances across all competitions, due to persistent injury and fitness issues, and score twice. At the end of this season, he will still have three years left to run on the five-year Chelsea contract — with a salary in the region of £320,000-a-week — he signed on joining from Inter in the summer of 2021.\nThe £97.5million transfer fee that Chelsea agreed to sign Lukaku for the second time in his career is also amortised over the length of that deal at a rate of £19.5m per year, giving him a remaining value on the books this summer of £58.5m. No sane suitor would go anywhere near paying that number for the services of a player who’ll be 30 by the time the season ends.\nIn the context of their vast transfer spending, is it at all feasible for Boehly and Clearlake to absorb the inevitable gargantuan accounting loss it would take to be rid of the Belgium international permanently?\nFrom an FFP compliance perspective, a second season on loan back at San Siro, with Inter again taking responsibility for his salary, appears to be the most palatable realistic option — unless Potter decides he can use Lukaku at Chelsea and rebuild his value. Good luck finding any enthusiasm for that scenario, either from the man himself or the many fans he alienated under previous head coach Thomas Tuchel.\nTo varying degrees, Boehly and Clearlake will need to make similar calculations about Christian Pulisic, Hakim Ziyech and Kepa Arrizabalaga, despite the latter’s success in re-establishing himself as Chelsea’s No 1 goalkeeper under Potter. All three are very good footballers whose market desirability has been eroded by below-par production and above-market contracts which do not fit the new owners’ vision for the pay scale at Stamford Bridge.\nAdvertisement\nKalidou Koulibaly, who turns 32 in June, and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, 34 that same month, can be added to Chelsea’s list of highly-paid expendables for whom it will likely be difficult to recover any real value.\nMateo Kovacic should be in a more desirable tier for suitors if a contract expiring after next season is not extended, and recent history suggests the market for academy graduates Mason Mount — although Boehly and Clearlake very much want to keep him — Conor Gallagher and Callum Hudson-Odoi will be strong.\nProfits from outgoing transfers has been a crucial part of Chelsea’s business model for more than a decade, and former director Marina Granovskaia built her reputation on extracting maximum value when selling high-profile players who were either surplus to requirements or keen to leave. Her list of successes is impressive: Eden Hazard to Real Madrid; Diego Costa and Alvaro Morata to Atletico Madrid; Oscar and Ramires to the Chinese Super League; Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic to Manchester United; David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain.\nBoehly and Clearlake will find it difficult to emulate such a track record, primarily due to the profound changes in the landscape of the transfer market since those deals were done.\nAccording to a report by CIES Football Observatory, the Premier League accounted for a record 48.5 per cent of all transfer fee investment in football’s big five European leagues in 2022, passing the €3billion mark for the first time. Back in 2013, that share was 34.3 per cent, and the inexorable rise in the financial power of England’s top flight has come at the expense of Spain’s La Liga, Serie A in Italy, the German Bundesliga and France’s Ligue 1.\nThis widening inequality has been turbocharged by the financial fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic; in 2022, CIES reports Premier League clubs had a total net transfer spend of €1.7bn. The next highest was La Liga at just €144m, then Serie A with a €78m net spend. Bundesliga and Ligue 1 clubs actually registered total net transfer profits of €18m and €76m respectively.\nWhat does this mean for Chelsea’s selling efforts?\nAdvertisement\nWell, the good news is that Europe’s biggest clubs can still pay Premier League salaries; Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich (in that order) currently have the four highest squad payrolls in the world game, according to football finance website Capology; Juventus and Atletico Madrid also rank in the top 10 along with Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool.\nThe bad news is that even these European giants are rarely in the market for expensive — let alone underperforming — Premier League assets. In fact, since the pandemic shutdowns of 2020, the only deals involving transfer fees taking players from England to the continental sides listed above are Raphinha and Ferran Torres from Leeds United and Manchester City to Barcelona, and Moise Kean from Everton back to his previous club, Juventus.\nPSG and Juventus are the only non-Premier League clubs in the top 10 biggest net transfer spenders of 2022, and the latter’s operations in the market over recent years are being extensively investigated by Italy’s football and financial authorities. Barcelona’s relentless activity since Joan Laporta’s return as president in 2021 has only been made possible by the pulling of economic ‘levers’ that have effectively mortgaged chunks of the Catalan club’s future income.\nAll this means that — unless Chinese clubs are suddenly granted renewed licence to pour the kind of money into the European transfer market that they did in the mid-2010s — Chelsea’s best hope of realising any significant value for players they no longer want or need, both this summer and increasingly in the coming years, will be selling to other Premier League clubs.\nOne obvious problem this reality poses is that the market for any unwanted Chelsea player is necessarily limited to a small number of potential clubs. Another is that some of the smartest over-achievers in the Premier League — namely Brighton & Hove Albion and Brentford — focus their recruitment on identifying superior value overseas, rather than buying cast-offs on big salaries from the likes of Chelsea. The more such clubs win, the more their methods will be adopted throughout the division, squeezing the selling market at the top end even further.\nBoehly and Clearlake are aware of football’s broader financial trends and how they are distorting the transfer market. Last summer’s Werner deal, coupled with the Lukaku loan, indicated a willingness to think differently about what really constitutes success and failure when offloading highly-paid, underperforming footballers.\nMore of that thinking will be needed, in the next window and beyond.\nGO DEEPER\nAzpilicueta exclusive: On Chelsea loyalty, setting standards and joining the 500 club\n(Top photo: Craig Mercer/MB Media/Getty Images)",
