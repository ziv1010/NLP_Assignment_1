We try to get the boys ready again and we will go again.”\nKlopp attempted to play down a touchline spat with Mohamed Salah, who was left out of the starting line-up, but the Egypt forward fanned the flames.\n“There’s going to be a fire today if I speak,” he told reporters.\nPep Guardiola’s City, who play relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest on Sunday, are hot favourites to secure an unprecedented fourth straight English top-flight title.\nArsenal, who led the way for much of last season, are firmly in the hunt but face a tough away day at Tottenham, also on Sunday.\nSheffield Utd down\nNewcastle’s 5-1 win against basement club Sheffield United strengthened their push for European football next season but sent Chris Wilder’s team down to the Championship after just one season in the top flight.\nAnel Ahmedhodzic gave the visitors an early lead at St James’ Park but Alexander Isak scored twice as the home side roared back.\n“We have not been good enough,” Wilder told the BBC. “The league has been too powerful for us right the way through the season.”\nNewcastle remain in seventh place but are just one point behind Manchester United, who conceded a late penalty in a draw against Burnley.\nBrazilian winger Antony scored his first Premier League goal of the season but Zeki Amdouni levelled from the spot in the 87th minute to leave the home side ruing missed chances.\nUnited have now won just one of their past six league matches as they limp towards the end of the season.\nBurnley are two points behind Forest, who are just outside the relegation zone, and one point behind Luton.\nTen Hag said his team “gave it away”.\n“We are one of the most dynamic and entertaining teams in the league at this moment,” said the Dutchman.\n“We are creating loads of chances by playing good football. it was unnecessary to lose control.”\nHwang Hee-chan and Toti Gomes scored as Wolves deepened Luton’s woes with a 2-1 win and Fulham drew 1-1 with Crystal Palace.\nEverton host Brentford later on Saturday seeking their fourth win in five games while Aston Villa, chasing a Champions League spot, take on inconsistent Chelsea in the late kick-off.\nIn an age of information overload, Sunrise is The Namibian’s morning briefing, delivered at 6h00 from Monday to Friday.
