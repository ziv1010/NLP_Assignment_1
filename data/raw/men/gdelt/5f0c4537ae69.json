  "body_text": "Former Manchester United players Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have shared their thoughts on who they believe should become the club’s next head coach.\nAmorim’s Reign Ends\nRuben Amorim was sacked on Monday morning following a decision taken by Director of Football Jason Wilcox and Chief Executive Officer Omar Berrada, after a heated meeting late last week.\nThe Portuguese coach had grown increasingly frustrated by what he felt was a lack of control at the club, with tensions between Amorim and the board building in recent months.\nIn the 40-year-old’s final press conference as United boss, following Sunday’s 1–1 draw with Leeds United, Amorim made several explosive comments.\n“If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticism of everything, we need to change the club,” Amorim said. “No, no, guys—I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not just the coach. Every department — the scouting department and the sporting director — needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months, and then we move on. Thank you, guys.”\nFollowing these remarks, the club decided to relieve Amorim of his duties on Monday morning at 10am, releasing the following statement:\n“With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that now is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of achieving the highest possible Premier League finish.\n“The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.”\nPotential Replacements\nSpeaking on their podcast The Good, The Bad & The Football, Scholes and Butt suggested that former Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane could be a potential candidate for the United job.\nThe treble winners ruled out several names, including Xavi Hernandez, Gareth Southgate, Oliver Glasner, Enzo Maresca and Marco Silva. They did, however, approve five alternative candidates.\nThe first was England manager Thomas Tuchel, whose contract is set to expire after the World Cup.\nBournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola also received praise, with the former midfielders highlighting the progress he has made with the Cherries over the past three seasons, while Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe was given the green light, due to his success in guiding the Magpies into European competition and his progressive style of football.\nAston Villa boss Unai Emery was also backed, with Scholes and Butt impressed by how he has transformed the Villans from a mid-table side into Champions League contenders in a short space of time.\nThe duo also named their former teammate and captain Roy Keane as another option they would not oppose seeing in the Old Trafford dugout, despite the fact this would undoubtedly end in disaster – although it would make for box office viewing.\nManchester United are now expected to appoint a caretaker head coach ahead of next weekend’s Manchester derby — but who will it be?\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
