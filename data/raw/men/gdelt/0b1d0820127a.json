That's what we are trying to do.\"\nHe added: \"We are happy with where we are. Now we have to finish the job and demand an extra bit from everybody.\"\nArteta admitted goal difference could be a key factor in the title race -- the Gunners have a goal difference of plus 43, compared with City's plus 48.\n\"We think about every possibility,\" he said. \"Obviously, we want to win matches first and earn the right to win them, and then we want to score as many goals as possible, but we have to be open to everything and any possibility.\"\nArsenal will again be without William Saliba against West Ham as the France defender continues to recover from a back problem, but forward Eddie Nketiah is available for selection.\n© 2023 AFP",
