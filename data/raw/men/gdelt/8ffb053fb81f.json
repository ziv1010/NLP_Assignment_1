Aleksandar Mitrovic added Al-Hilal’s third from close range seven minutes into injury time. Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal will now meet next month in a western quarter-final line-up dominated by the big-spending clubs from Saudi Arabia.\nThe pair are joined by Al-Nassr in the last eight, with Cristiano Ronaldo’s side due to take on Al-Ain of the United Arab Emirates in the next round after their win over fellow Saudi Pro League club Al-Fayha on Wednesday.\nSouth Korean champions Ulsan Hyundai will take on compatriots Jeonbuk Motors in the eastern half of the draw while Yokohama F Marinos from Japan will play Chinese Super League side Shandong Taishan.\nThe first legs of the quarter-finals will be played from March 4 to 6, with the return fixtures held from March 11 to 13.\n-\nJames Van Der Beek's Final Conversation With Director Roger Avary Laid Bare: 'We Cried'\n-\nJaden Smith Walks Out Of Interview After Kanye West Question At Film Premiere\n-\nMichelle Obama Gets Candid About Spontaneous Decision At Piercings Tattoo\n-\nWhy Halle Berry Wasn't Ready For Marriage After Van Hunt Popped Question?
