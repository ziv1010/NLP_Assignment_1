  "body_text": "Al Ain boss Hernan Crespo admitted that Al Ahly outplayed his team during their quarter-final defeat in the FIFA Intercontinental Cup.\nAl Ahly thrashed Asian champions Al Ain 3-0 to claim the African–Asian–Pacific Cup and qualify for the Challenger Cup, where they will face the winner of the match between Mexico’s CF Pachuca and the yet-to-be-determined CONMEBOL champion.\nIn the post-match press conference, Crespo said: “This is football. Sometimes you go into a game with a plan that you believe is a good option, but today, we didn’t play well and committed too many individual errors, which cost us dearly.\n“When you play at this level, it’s important not to make such mistakes. In these kinds of atmospheres, you have to play a perfect game, and we didn’t do that.”\n“It’s not easy to play in such an intense environment. Al Ahly took the initiative from the first minute because they were playing on their home ground. The key moment in the first half was the mistake that led to the goal. This is a good learning opportunity; we must accept these mistakes and learn from them.”\nThe Argentine coach explained his tactical decisions: “We tried playing Soufiane Rahimi as a forward, and after falling behind, we added Kodjo Laba alongside him. However, all the solutions we attempted didn’t produce the desired results. It wasn’t our night; everything we tried, they did better. We tried to give our best, but we were not playing comfortably at any point in the game.\n“Al Ahly is a very good team, and playing at their stadium with their crowd behind them gave them extra motivation. Playing away is always more challenging, but this is football, and that’s how the draw came out, so we have to respect it.”\n“Playing against this kind of crowd is tough, but the most important thing is to respect the competition. In terms of football, Al Ahly played better than us. We conceded goals due to individual mistakes that simply can’t happen in these types of games.\nThe Al Ain coach concluded: “All the effort and energy sometimes aren’t enough. I don’t want to say we achieved a miracle by winning the AFC Champions League, but I can say we aim to return to this stage once again.”\nAl Ahly’s next match in the competition will be held on December 11 in Doha, They will face the winner of the match between Mexico’s Pachuca and the yet-to-be-decided COONMEBOL champion",
