If I look at Liverpool and their team – Szoboszlai and Mac Allister. Mac Allister hasn’t performed yet, for me.\n“I think they’re missing one more top midfielder in there.\n“Musiala is the kind of player that could win the Ballon d’Or, but I don’t think it’s possible at Bayern Munich.\n“Germany aren’t great at the moment either, so for him to win it – does he have to be in the Premier League or in La Liga with Real Madrid?\n“I think it’s something the player would love to do. He knows England well.\n“But every club in the world will be looking at him. When he’s on the pitch, he makes things happen – we saw that against Man United.\n“He had Casemiro chasing shadows.\n“Musiala is going to cost a lot, but it’s so exciting. What a top player.”\nLiverpool are back in action on Thursday evening when they take on French side Toulouse in the Europa League.",
