Soon after, Erik ten Hag arrived and moved him on.\nWhether he will make it back to that famous competition remains to be seen, with Utrecht going head to head with AZ Alkmaar, Feyenoord – who have just appointed Robin van Persie as their new manager – and FC Twente.\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
