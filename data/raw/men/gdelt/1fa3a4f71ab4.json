Essentially, a side that on the rare occasions they don’t win a title feels like a monumental feat of ineptitude.\nCity have at least been tested at times while winning five of the past six league titles.\nLast year, Arsenal finished just five points behind them and were top of the table for a significant portion of the season.\nBefore the Gunners’ rise, Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool — the only other side to lift the title in the last six seasons — were their main rivals.\nThere were two seasons where City pipped Liverpool to the title by just a single point (2021-22 and 2018-19).\nHowever, the other campaigns in question have felt more like a procession — City won the title by 12 and 19 points in 2020-21 and 2017-18 respectively, with Man United the distant runners-up on both occasions.\nThe only year Liverpool triumphed was by a similarly comprehensive margin — 18 points in the 2018-19 pandemic-interrupted season.\nJust before City became England’s dominant club, in Pep Guardiola’s first season in charge, Antonio Conte’s Chelsea claimed the 2016-17 title ahead of Spurs by a comfortable enough margin of seven points.\nEven the campaign of Leicester City’s stunning victory, 2015-16, was more one-sided than you might remember — the Foxes finished a full 10 points ahead of second-place Arsenal.\nChelsea also triumphed in 2014-15, eight points ahead of Manuel Pellegrini’s Man City.\nSo you have to go back a decade, to the 2013-14 season, for the last instance of a genuinely close title race involving more than two teams.\nThat season saw Pellegrini’s City beat Liverpool by two points, who finished two points ahead of Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea in third, who themselves finished three points ahead of fourth-place Arsenal.\nCould a similar scenario take place 10 years on?\nMan City are naturally once more the favourites to prevail this year.\nShould they succeed, not only would it consolidate their dominance, but it would be the first time in English football history that one side has won four titles on the bounce.\nNot even the great Liverpool, Man United or Arsenal sides of the past ever managed this unprecedented feat.\nHowever, City have shown signs of wobbling of late.\nAhead of the new season and on the back of last year’s treble, important squad players like Riyad Mahrez, Ilkay Gundogan and Aymeric Laporte have departed.\nThe reigning champions have also not been helped by the absence through injury and suspension at times of key players, including Rodri, Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva.\nThe recent defeat to rivals Arsenal meant they lost back-to-back Premier League fixtures for just the third time since Guardiola took charge. In addition, the Carabao Cup loss to Newcastle last month means they cannot top last season by winning the quadruple.\nHowever, there remains justifiable scepticism amid talk of City’s potential downfall.\nIn their first 24 games last season, there were signs of inconsistency, as they drew four and lost four.\nHowever, a subsequent 12-match winning run during the business end of the campaign was enough to get them over the line.\nSimilarly, the season before, City ended up dropping points in four of their opening 10 games before proceedings to win 15 of their next 17, while going unbeaten in their last 10 league fixtures, winning all but three of them.\nAlthough their recent results will be of some concern to Pep Guardiola, it is not a drastically dissimilar scenario to the minor setbacks they have experienced before.\nPerhaps a more salient question is whether their rivals have the capability to keep pace with the Etihad outfit in the long run.\nTottenham have done remarkably well so far, as reflected by Ange Postecoglou enjoying the rare feat of winning back-to-back manager-of-the-month awards.\nHowever, the table toppers have benefitted from a fair degree of luck. Their last three wins are a case in point — they went down to 10 men and Luton missed some gilt-edged chances in the 1-0 victory just before the international break, while they benefitted from the now-infamous VAR error against Liverpool and needed goals in the 98th and 100th minute to beat Sheffield United — surely they cannot retain this degree of good fortune until the end of the season.\nAlso, their bench against Liverpool comprised Fraser Forster, Emerson Royal, Ben Davies, Ashley Phillips, Oliver Skipp, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg, Manor Solomon, Alejo Veliz and Jamie Donley. There is a lack of experience evident, particularly in the attacking areas, which means they could seriously struggle if the injuries start to pile up.\nThat said, similar accusations were levelled at Leicester City in 2016, and like the Foxes then, Spurs do not have European football to contend with this year and are already out of the League Cup.\nConversely, Arsenal have to worry about Champions League football this season — last year, they could afford to invariably play an understrength team in the Europa League.\nOn the other hand, they definitely have a superior squad this time out, with the hugely talented quartet of Declan Rice, David Raya, Kai Havertz and Jurriën Timber all joining in the summer.\nThe other side occupying the top four currently, Liverpool, have also started the season encouragingly for the most part.\nTheir revamped midfield appears to have adapted seamlessly, with Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai, Wataru Endō and Ryan Gravenberch impressing, after they were signed in the summer for a combined cost of approximately £145 million (€167 million).\nThe Reds also have arguably the best attacking options of any Premier League side — so far, the quintet of Mo Salah, Darwin Núñez, Diogo Jota, Luis Díaz and Cody Gakpo have contributed 20 goals in all competitions.\nTheir defence though has been less impressive — some critics argue recent injury problems mean that Virgil van Dijk is no longer at the level that originally convinced Liverpool to make him the world’s most expensive defender while they could be vulnerable in other areas too — whether Trent Alexander-Arnold’s defensive susceptibility will be costly in the long-term is a regular source of debate and consternation among fans.\nSo all of the contenders are flawed and City rightly remain favourites, though they need their form to pick up soon and face a tough test this weekend — a Brighton win at the Etihad on Saturday is far from inconceivable and would see the Seagulls leapfrog Guardiola’s men in the table.\nIt looks set to be a fascinating few months ahead.\nUpcoming Premier League fixtures (all games kick off at 3pm unless stated otherwise)\nSaturday\nLiverpool v Everton (12.30)\nBournemouth v Wolves\nBrentford v Burnley\nMan City v Brighton\nNewcastle v Crystal Palace\nNottingham Forest v Luton Town\nChelsea v Arsenal (17.30)\nSheffield United v Man United (20.00)\nSunday\nWest Ham v Aston Villa (16.30)\nMonday\nTottenham v Fulham (20.00)",
