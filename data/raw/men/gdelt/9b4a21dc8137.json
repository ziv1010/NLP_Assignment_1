Make sure you know how to watch the Premier League wherever you are.\nTeam news\nRoberto De Zerbi has named the following Brighton starting 11: (4-2-3-1) Jason Steele; Joel Veltman, Lewis Dunk (captain), Adam Webster, Pervis Estupinan; Pascal Gross, Billy Gilmour; Solly March, Julio Enciso, Danny Welbeck; Deniz Undav\nJulen Lopetegui has selected the following Wolves starting 11: (4-3-3) Jose Sa; Nelson Semedo, Craig Dawson, Max Kilman, Hugo Bueno; Joao Gomes, Mario Lemina, Ruben Neves; Pedro Neto, Diego Costa, Matheus Nunes\nForm\nBrighton: LDWLW\nWolves: WLWWD\nReferee\nDavid Coote will be the referee for Brighton v Wolves.\nStadium\nBrighton v Wolves will be played at the American Express Community Stadium in Brighton.\nKick-off and channel\nBrighton v Wolves kick-off is at 3.00pm BST on Saturday 29 April in the UK. The game isn't being shown in the UK. See below for international broadcast options.\nVPN guide\nUse a VPN to watch Premier League football from outside your country\nIf you’re out of the country for a Premier League fixture, then you won't be able to watch on your domestic streaming service as usual. The broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!) and blocks you from watching it. You can use a VPN to get around that, though, without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and will let you watch. And all the info going between is entirely encrypted, anonymous and safe – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there. For the Premier League, FourFourTwo currently recommends:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS5 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price. Go get it!\nInternational Premier League TV rights\n• UK: Sky Sports and BT Sport are the two main players once again, but Amazon also have a slice of the pie in 2022/23.\n• USA: NBC Sports Group are the Premier League rights holders, with the Peacock Premium streaming platform showing even more than the 175 games it aired last season. If you pick up a fuboTV subscription for the games not on Peacock Premium, you'll be able to watch every game.\n• Canada: The way to watch Premier League football in 2022/23 is fuboTV, which has exclusive rights to all the action.\n• Australia: Optus Sport will screen every game of the Premier League season. Non-subscribers can access the action via a Fetch TV box and other friendly streaming devices.\n• New Zealand: Sky Sport are serving up all 380 games – plus various highlights and magazine shows throughout the week, as well as the Champions League.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nAlasdair Mackenzie is a freelance journalist based in Rome, and a FourFourTwo contributor since 2015.
