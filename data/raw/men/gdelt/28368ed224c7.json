  "body_text": "LONDON: Newcastle boss Eddie Howe says he does not feel as if his team are being “hunted” as he seeks to fend off charging Liverpool and finish in the Premier League’s top four.\nThe Magpies, seeking to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in two decades, host high-flying Brighton at St James’ Park on Thursday.\nRoberto De Zerbi’s side, fresh from a 3-0 win at Arsenal, are chasing European football for the first time in their history.\nNewcastle are currently third in the table — behind Manchester City and Arsenal — level on points with Manchester United. Both Newcastle and United have three games remaining.\nJurgen Klopp’s Liverpool are just one point behind, having played a game more, after their seventh straight league win at Leicester on Monday.\nHowe said Newcastle still had matters in their own hands and insisted he was not focusing on red-hot Liverpool.\n“I don’t feel like we’re being hunted,” he said at his pre-match press conference on Wednesday. “I don’t feel that emotion. It’s us against ourselves, really. That’s how I see it. It’s us trying to be the best we can be.\n“I’ve not focused on any other team all season. In my experience, I knew Liverpool were never far away because they are a top team and they are capable of going on runs of wins.\n“They are very similar to Manchester City where they can win a group of games without blinking. They have got that experience.”\nVictory for Newcastle in their last two home games, against Brighton and then Leicester on Monday, would guarantee a place in the Champions League.\nBrighton manager De Zerbi said he was “losing sleep” over his best first XI due to a lengthy list of injuries.\nThe Italian urged his players to set aside the elation of the win at Arsenal and focus on the chance to make history by claiming a European spot.\n“We are fighting for a historic target and if we want to reach the historic target we have to make historic results,” he said.\n“This year we won two times against Chelsea, we won 3-0 against Liverpool, we won 3-0 in Emirates Stadium.\n“We are winning incredible games but to reach the incredible target you have to win incredible games.\n“We can decide our destiny and our future but we know the way is still difficult.”",
