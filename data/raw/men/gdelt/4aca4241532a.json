So for some of them, they have to leave.\"\nWhat now for Sterling?\nThis is the first time since 2012 at Liverpool that Sterling has not played on the opening day of a Premier League season.\nMaresca called it \"a technical decision\", adding: \"In the next days we will see if it needs to be clarified.\"\nSterling's time at Chelsea has not gone to plan since his £50m move from Manchester City two years ago.\nHe has scored nine goals and 10 goals respectively in those two campaigns. Not bad figures for a winger, but the last season he netted fewer than 10 was 2012-13.\nOn top of that, he has lost his place in the England team, having failed to add to his 82 caps since the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\nHis statement after Sunday's line-up was announced has ruffled feathers.\nFormer England defender Richards said: \"Raheem and his team know what they are doing. They are trying to make noise.\n\"Putting that statement out before the game is not good enough. That will not help your team-mates or your case of getting back in the team.\n\"The manager has not picked him and he needs to deal with it.\"\nNevin, who played for the club from 1983 to 1988, wonders if this situation could knock Sterling's transfer fee down.\n\"What this situation with Raheem Sterling has done is make him possibly cheaper to buy. He won't be £100m or £50m. He will be a lot less than that as a club can say they are buying 'damaged goods'.\n\"Does it mean he will earn less money? Well, the top words of the statement were 'Raheem Sterling is contracted to Chelsea Football club for the next three years'.\n\"That is code for 'I am owed that money and I'm not giving it up'. I think this has been clever by the player and his people.\"\nSterling just one of many with uncertain future\nChelsea have spent about £185m on 11 signings this summer, adding to a squad that was already considered large.\nAcademy products Gallagher and Chalobah and striker Lukaku, who cost them £97.5m three years ago, are all training away from the first team.\nChelsea accepted a £33m bid from Atletico Madrid for Gallagher, who captained the club in 24 Premier League games last season.\nHowever, he has been unable to complete his move for now after a deal for striker Samu Omorodion to go in the opposite direction collapsed.\nChalobah is being linked to several Premier League clubs, while Maresca has told England left-back Chilwell that he is allowed to leave this summer too.\nMidfielder Carney Chukwuemeka and defender Axel Disasi were among the other players left out against City.\n\"I think every case is different,\" said Maresca afterwards.\n\"Carney is a very good player. The problem is, because of some injuries in the past, I think the best for him is to play 30 or 35 games in a row, to show himself that he is fit and how good he is. With us, is he going to play 35 games? I'm not sure.\"\nCo-controlling owners Behdad Eghbali and Todd Boehly have spent about £1.5bn on players since taking over just over two years ago, following Roman Abramovich's successful reign.\nRedknapp, speaking on Sky, said: \"Maresca's biggest problem is trying to keep everyone happy. It is virtually impossible.\n\"Maresca will see so many unhappy faces. The best teams in the world work on 24 or 25 players in the squad. How or why did they think they can reinvent football? They are giving the manager an impossible job.\"\nIf some of these issues sound familiar, former boss Graham Potter had similar challenges during his spell in charge.\nThe squad he inherited in 2022 was so big that the dressing room reportedly had to be reconfigured to fit more people in, and players had to change in the halls.\nChelsea had to leave Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang out of their squad for the Champions League knockout stages that campaign even after he had started all the group games becuase of the size of their squad.\nAnd that will be another issue for Maresca, who will have to name a squad for the Premier League of 25 players (excluding under-21 players), with at least eight of those considered homegrown.\nChelsea-XI\nChoose your Chelsea XI to start the season with.Related topics\n- Published26 July 2022",
