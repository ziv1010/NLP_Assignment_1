  "body_text": "The two Newcastle restaurants where you're bound to see a United player in 2026\nThere are two restaurants in Newcastle that are proving particular popular with United football players\nAs they aim to bounce back from a frustrating away defeat to Manchester United on Boxing Day, you might find Newcastle players having some comfort food in two particular restaurants in town. And that's because over the last 12 months, pretty much all of the first team have been to them as well as a few Magpies legends.\nHaving squandered a two goal lead to end up drawing 2-2 with Chelsea last Saturday, Eddie Howe's men were hoping to at least come away with something from Old Trafford, against a team who whilst better than last season and actually ahead of NUFC in the Premier League table, are still very unpredictable. Sadly for Newcastle, there was to be no late Christmas present, as the only goal of the game, scored by Patrick Dorgu in the 24th minute, secured all three points for their opponents.\nNext up for United is another away trip, this time to Turf Moor on Tuesday to face Burnley. And, between now and then and as they look to get over Friday night's loss, you might well find some players down at either Khai Khai or DOOD. Khai Khai filly opened in 2021, having initially launched as a takeaway during the Covid pandemic and it took no time at all for it to be a firm favourite of famous faces, with the likes of Harrison Ford, Amanda Holden and Gordon Ramsay heading for food there and chef Gordon even declaring he'd had 'the curry of his life' at Khai Khai.\nIt also quickly became a hit with Newcastle footballers past and present, with Alan Shearer a bit of a regular and David Ginola dining at Khai Khai on the eve of United's emphatic Champions League win against PSG in 2023. Over the last few months alone, first teamers like Anthony Gordon, Tino Livramento and Fabian Schar have made return visits to the Quayside haunt, Nick Woltemade had his first night out in Newcastle there, Elliot Anderson went with brother Will after his new side Forest lost to NUFC at St James' Park and Jacob Ramsey was at the restaurant just the other day.\nJust along the road from Khai Khai on the banks of the River Tyne is DOOD and, just like its neighbour it has cemented itself as a must visit place for United stars. After several of them, including Schar and fellow defender Dan Burn, headed to its VIP opening, countless players have been through its doors, with the likes of Kieran Trippier, Bruno Guimaraes and Malick Thiaw enjoying dishes from its eclectic menu and BDB going back for another try.\nWe have a dedicated newsletter for What’s On news and reviews.
