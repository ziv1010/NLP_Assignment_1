  "body_text": "good morning everyone!\nThe Hoddle of Coffee: Tottenham Hotspur news and links for Wednesday, March 1\nA look at the month ahead\nIt’s the first of the month and you know what that means: It’s time to look at the coming schedules.\nTottenham Hotspur men’s schedule: at Sheffield United (March 1, FA Cup); at Wolves (March 4); AC Milan (March 8, Champions League); Nottingham Forest (March 11); at Southampton (March 18)\nI think it’s safe to say that all of the fixtures this month are must-wins. There are two cup matches (Fa Cup on March 1 and Champions League on March 8) and three Premier League fixtures against relegation-threatened clubs.\nPart of what has made the men’s squad so infuriating this season is their tendency to pick up a marquee result only to scupper it the following week. And I really don’t want to have to go through that this month.\nThere are three Premier League fixtures against bottom-table clubs - Wolves, Forest and Soton. That should be nine points, right? But we all know better than to be hopeful.\nAnd there are two huge steps to take towards a trophy run this year also. The FA Cup is pretty open and Sheffield United have been spotty in recent weeks. A perfect time to capitalise. Then of course, on March 8, is the second leg of our knockout tie against Milan.\nTottenham Hotspur women’s schedule: At Manchester City (March 5); at Liverpool (March 12); Leicester (March 15); Arsenal (March 25)\nFebruary wasn’t the best month for the women’s squad. They suffered losses against Chelsea and United, and were eliminated in the FA Cup this past weekend by Reading.\nOverall, Spurs have lost their last 5 WSL matches and it won’t get easier with fixtures against City and a home derby versus Arsenal.\nIt looks like points might only be attainable against Liverpool and Leicester, but it’s going to be a challenging month indeed.\nFitzie’s track of the day: Nightflyer, by Allison Russell\nAnd now for your links:\nWhat’s Sergio Reguilon been up to? All this and more in Football.London’s loan roundup\nThe Athletic ($$): Maybe Spurs’ back line isn’t as bad as we thought\nTottenham and Formula 1 sign 15-year partnership\nJose Mourinho sent off during Roma’s loss to Cremonese\nLuton Town come back from two goals down for crucial draw vs Millwall",
