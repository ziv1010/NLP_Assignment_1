  "body_text": "How teams have qualified for the Club World Cup\nPARIS: The new-look FIFA Club World Cup kicks off in the United States this weekend with 32 teams from around the globe taking part.\nWith 12 representatives, Europe is sending more teams than any other continent, followed by South America with six. Asia and Africa both have four competing teams, as does the CONCACAF region of North and Central America and the Caribbean.\nIn addition, there is one club from Oceania while the line-up is completed by a representative from the host nation. There are two ways of qualifying for the tournament, which football’s world governing body now intends to stage every four years -- either as continental champions or via a club ranking based on performances in continental competitions over a four-year period.\nFIFA’s expanded Club World Cup which gets underway in the United States this weekend is a controversial addition to the global football calendar and one that could have a far-reaching impact on the sport in the years to come.\nThe 32-team tournament, with one billion dollars in prize money on offer, has been crammed into an already overloaded schedule leading to concerns it will push elite players to breaking point.\nIt also threatens to upset the balance of domestic and continental club competitions, giving competing teams huge financial advantages over rivals. Consider the leading clubs in Europe, which is sending 12 teams including Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Chelsea.\nThe chances are high that some will go deep into the Club World Cup, with a maximum of seven games to be played up to the July 13 final.\n— Continental champions- The following 16 teams qualified as continental champions over the period from 2021 to 2024:\nUEFA Champions League winners: Chelsea (ENG/2021), Real Madrid (ESP/2022 and 2024), Manchester City (ENG/2023)\nCopa Libertadores winners: Palmeiras (BRA/2021), Flamengo (BRA/2022), Fluminense (BRA/2023), Botafogo (BRA/2024)\nAFC Champions League winners: Al Hilal (KSA/2021), Urawa Red Diamonds (JPN/2022), Al Ain (UAE/2023 and 2024)\nCONCACAF Champions League winners: Monterrey (MEX/2021), Seattle Sounders (USA/2022), Pachuca (MEX/2024)\nCAF Champions League winners: Al Ahly (EGY/2021, 2023 and 2024), Wydad Casablanca (MAR/2022)\nOFC Champions League winners: Auckland City (NZL/2022, 2023 and 2024)\n— Best four-year rankings -\nThe following 14 teams qualified via their performances in continental club competitions over the last four years:\nEurope: Bayern Munich (GER), Paris Saint-Germain (FRA), Borussia Dortmund (GER), Inter Milan (ITA), Porto (POR), Atletico Madrid (ESP), Benfica (POR), Juventus (ITA), Red Bull Salzburg (AUT)\nSouth America: River Plate (ARG), Boca Juniors (ARG)\nAsia: Ulsan HD (KOR)\nAfrica: Esperance (TUN), Mamelodi Sundowns (RSA)\n— Host representatives -\nThat leaves two berths, both of which have gone to teams who will be playing on home turf.\nPerhaps conveniently for FIFA as they look to get eyeballs on their new competition, Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami are the designated representatives of the host nation.\nThat is after they won the Supporters Shield for being the best performing side during the 2024 MLS regular season -- even though LA Galaxy went on to win the MLS Cup to determine the overall champions.\nLos Angeles FC claimed the last spot with a 2-1 extra-time victory against Club America of Mexico in a play-in match at the end of last month. The spot became available following FIFA’s decision to ban Mexican club Leon from the tournament. Leon were barred because the club is owned by Grupo Pachuca, which also controls Liga MX side Pachuca, who are also taking part.\n-\nJames Van Der Beek's Final Conversation With Director Roger Avary Laid Bare: 'We Cried'\n-\nJaden Smith Walks Out Of Interview After Kanye West Question At Film Premiere\n-\nMichelle Obama Gets Candid About Spontaneous Decision At Piercings Tattoo\n-\nWhy Halle Berry Wasn't Ready For Marriage After Van Hunt Popped Question?
