Women’s Champions League result, match stream and latest updates today\nChelsea have a mountain to climb in their Women’s Champions League semi-final tie against Barcelona after slipping to a flat first-leg defeat on home soil on Saturday lunchtime. A strong crowd of 27,697 - a British record for a European game - were at Stamford Bridge for a heavyweight clash, but were silenced by a sensational fourth-minute strike from Norwegian forward Caroline Hansen Graham.\nEmma Hayes’ hosts initially rallied well after falling behind early, with Guro Reiten seeing an effort ruled out for offside and also having a shot cleared off the line by Lucy Bronze, who later limped off with a knee injury in the latest pre-World Cup injury concern for England and Sarina Wiegman. Substitute Marta Torrejon hit the post with a header late on, but Barca could not find a second goal despite all their dominance after the interval.\nBut they will still be enormous favourites to progress next week and reach their third consecutive European final in Eindhoven on June 3. Follow Chelsea vs Barcelona reaction live below, with analysis from Standard Sport’s Dom Smith at the Bridge.\nChelsea vs Barcelona highlights\nSubstitute Marta hits the post with late header\nBronze limps off in latest England injury worry\nNO GOAL!

Marta causes more issues from the corner but her latest header is wide.\n14:19 , George Flood\n84 mins: Three changes from both managers for the final exchanges.\nPernille Harder makes her first Chelsea appearance since November after injury. Jessie Fleming and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd are also on.\nOff go Reiten, Leupolz and Perisset.\nBarca replace Walsh, Hansen and Paralluelo with Ingrid Engen, Asisat Oshoala and Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic.\n14:14 , George Flood\n82 mins: Marta hits the post for Barca with a header!\nChelsea break with menace but a woeful ball from Kerr stops a dangerous counter-attack in its tracks.\nDom Smith at Stamford Bridge\n14:14 , George Flood\nIt’s not been anywhere near as good from Chelsea, this second-half display. They have fallen off it somewhat, while Barca have reinstated the way they were dictating play in the opening moments of the match.\nChelsea really must push for an equaliser from any means now.\n14:13 , George Flood\n81 mins: Carter with another important header inside the Chelsea box to repel Barcelona’s latest searching cross.\nChelsea’s No7 then has to react to block an effort from Mariona.\nBoth sides are about to make more changes.\n14:11 , George Flood\n79 mins: Chelsea’s second-half display here has been very tepid indeed, but they have defended well to their credit.\nNot many sides in Europe are capable of limiting this star-studded Barcelona attack to just one goal.\nBerger has commanded confidently as usual.\n14:10 , George Flood\n77 mins: Not too much action to speak of at the moment as we enter the final 15 minutes in west London.\nBarca on top, probing and extremely comfortable.\nThey will be enormous favourites with a 1-0 advantage for the second leg, though will want to make things more comfortable.\n14:07 , George Flood\n73 mins: The cameras pan to Lucy Bronze on the Barca bench, where she’s sitting with ice strapped on her right knee.\nSarina Wiegman will be praying that’s nothing serious.\n14:06 , George Flood\n71 mins: James goes in late on Mariona, catching the top of her foot and earning a yellow card.\nLess than 20 minutes to play at Stamford Bridge in this semi-final first-leg tie, with Barca still probing in search of a second goal that would leave Chelsea with a mountain to climb at the Camp Nou on Thursday.\nThe Blues look tired but need to find a big finish from somewhere.\n14:02 , George Flood\n70 mins: Barcelona attack again with real pace as Hansen charges forward into the box.\nShe tries to cut inside for Paralluelo, but Carter is there to make a crucial last-ditch intervention.\n14:00 , George Flood\n68 mins: A second change from Chelsea sees Cuthbert replaced by Wales captain Sophie Ingle in midfield.\n14:00 , George Flood\n67 mins: This does not look good for Bronze and she’s replaced by Marta Torrejon.\nYet another major concern for England and Sarina Wiegman with the World Cup looming large Down Under this summer.\n13:58 , George Flood\n65 mins: Barca’s passing football is really something to behold in full flow - all nifty one- and two-touch stuff, pretty patterns and effective triangles.\nThey look dangerous down both flanks and Rolfo almost gets in to double the advantage.\nNow Bronze is down and needs treatment. England boss Sarina Wiegman does not need any more injury concerns after seeing captain Leah Williamson join the likes of Beth Mead on the sidelines this week, ruled out of the World Cup with a ruptured ACL.\n13:56 , George Flood\n64 mins: Signs of life from Chelsea at last in this second half, but Cuthbert’s header is not too much trouble for Panos.\n13:55 , George Flood\n63 mins: Barcelona are denied again at close range before Chelsea look to release James on the counter.\nShe gets goal-side of Walsh, who tugs back her England colleague and receives a yellow card from Czech referee Jana Adamkova.\n13:54 , George Flood\n62 mins: Barcelona have absolutely dominated this second half so far and will be kicking themselves if they don’t get the second goal.\nChelsea look very tired and their press has dropped off completely.\nHayes may need to make some more changes quickly.\n13:52 , George Flood\n60 mins: That was to prove Geyse’s last action of this game.\nThe Brazilian makes way for Mariona Caldentey in Barcelona’s first change on the hour mark.\n13:51 , George Flood\n58 mins: Chelsea fought back well in the first half after going behind but their efforts since the interval have left a lot to be desired.\nBarca up the ante with some wonderful passing football on the edge of the box, with Paralluelo’s smart back-heel teeing up Geyse for a tame low strike that is easily gathered by Berger.\nDom Smith at Stamford Bridge\n13:49 , George Flood\nEmma Hayes looks remarkably calm on the touchline, for a manager whose side are 1-0 down in their home leg of an aggregated tie against the best team in world football.\n13:49 , George Flood\n55 mins: A bit of a lull in the contest now as Barca struggle to fashion further chances and again Chelsea fail to release Kerr on the counter.\nThat’s terrific defending from Mjelde to get across and squeeze out Geyse after Eriksson is beaten all ends up for pace.\n13:45 , George Flood\n53 mins: Finally Chelsea get up the pitch and Walsh can’t control the ball at close quarters - a rare error from the England schemer.\nIt leads to a snap shot from distance from substitute James that fails to ask too much of Panos in the Barcelona goal.\nBarca break at speed and Hansen tries to curl an effort into the top corner, but this one is off target as it hurtles into the stands.\n13:44 , George Flood\n52 mins: Chelsea cannot escape their own half at the moment as the pressure continues to mount.\nWalsh has acres of space in which to try and pick out fellow Lioness Bronze at the back post, but it’s diverted behind by Berger.\nThe Blues ‘keeper then confidently gathers the latest teasing cross.\n13:43 , George Flood\n50 mins: Barcelona are going through the gears again as Chelsea’s back five are placed firmly under the cosh.\nA vital block from Mjelde denies Paralluelo inside the box.\n13:42 , George Flood\n48 mins: Chelsea are under pressure early in the second half despite a covering challenge from Eriksson, with Geyse and Bonmati leading the charge.\nThe ball eventually falls for Fridolina Rolfo, but the Swede can’t fashion a strike from just inside the box.\n13:38 , George Flood\n46 mins: A tumbling Carter has just accidentally taken out the assistant referee after a clear nudge from Geyse, who is very apologetic.\n13:36 , George Flood\nIt’s Jelana Cankovic who makes way for James.\nAn attacking half-time switch from Emma Hayes as Chelsea push for an equaliser.\nBack underway at the Bridge.\n13:34 , George Flood\nChelsea are going to make a change at half-time.\nIt sounds like Lauren James is coming on.\n13:29 , George Flood\nChelsea co-owner Todd Boehly is at Stamford Bridge this afternoon to take in this semi-final tie...\nDom Smith at Stamford Bridge\n13:26 , George Flood\nWell that was a half which Chelsea started so poorly. Barcelona had them tied up in knots. But to their credit, Hayes’s side regrouped, and go into the break behind, yes, but now playing just as well as Barca.\nNo longer does this tie feel as one-sided as it did early on.\nHalf-time\n13:23 , George Flood\nChelsea 0-1 Barcelona\nCaroline Graham Hansen’s superb fourth-minute strike is all that separates the sides at half-time in the first leg of this Champions League semi-final tie at Stamford Bridge.\nBut Chelsea won’t be too disheartened after a pleasing fightback, with Guro Reiten seeing one goal ruled out and another effort cleared off the line by Lucy Bronze.\nBarca sat off after going in front but upped the tempo again before the interval.\n13:21 , George Flood\n48 mins: That’s a painful ball to the face for Hansen, who initially goes down but is quickly back on her feet.\nBarca still pressing before the interval, but a long cross from the left is well overhit.\nThe half-time whistle sounds.\n13:20 , George Flood\n46 mins: Barca are probing dangerously in search of a second goal before the interval.\nA whipped left-wing cross into the six-yard box is well claimed by Berger.\nBut the Spanish giants quickly come again and a dangerous ball across the face of goal from Hansen can’t be turned in by Geyse, who was offside anyway.\nIt wouldn’t have counted.\n13:18 , George Flood\n44 mins: After a quiet start, Aitana Bonmati is driving Barcelona forward now and finding plenty of little pockets of space in which to operate.\nOn this occasion she’s robbed by Cuthbert, who tries another one of those immediate smashed balls forward, looking for the run of Kerr.\nChelsea’s top scorer had no chance at all with that one.\nFour minutes of added time will be played at the end of this first half.\n13:15 , George Flood\n42 mins: Barcelona are upping the tempo before the break after a quiet 20 minutes or so, with Carter turning away Hansen’s cross from the right.\nThe visitors sustain the pressure, but cannot test Berger as it’s eventually cleared.\n13:13 , George Flood\n40 mins: That’s a very harsh caution for Mapi Leon, who joins Kerr in the book after the ball skips up off the turf and hits her right hand.\nChelsea have a chance to swing in a deep free-kick from the left, but it’s easily cleared by Barca as they look to set away Paralluelo on the break.\nDom Smith at Stamford Bridge\n13:12 , George Flood\nChelsea should definitely be pleased with how they’ve tussled their way back into this match when they debrief at half-time.\nThey were miles off it in the opening stages, but it’s a much more level affair now.\n13:12 , George Flood\n38 mins: The flag is up as Kerr tries to race onto another lofted ball forward from midfield, with Panos coming to claim.\nOne of those long flashed passes forward is going to catch out Barca before too long.\nThe Blues have rather taken control of the battle in the middle, with Cuthbert particularly impressive.\n13:09 , George Flood\n36 mins: That’s one overeager striker’s challenge too many from Kerr as she tries to just nick the ball but catches the England right-back late.\nFirst yellow card of the game.\n13:06 , George Flood\n33 mins: Barcelona are being made to work defensively as Walsh cuts out one ball from Cankovic and the visitors then scramble to deal with another inviting cross for Kerr.\nPanos eventually scoops up the loose ball to relieve the pressure. Chelsea on top at the moment, seeing far more of the ball.\n13:04 , George Flood\n30 mins: End-to-end action at Stamford Bridge now, with Hansen played in down the left channel but denied by some incredibly brave goalkeeping from Berger.\nThe German dives courageously at the feet of Barca’s goalscorer but takes a hefty whack for her troubles and will need more treatment.\nOnce again she bounces back up.\n13:02 , George Flood\n29 mins: Chelsea are really knocking on the door now!\nThe suddenly alive Reiten rounds Panos but her left-footed finish is blocked at the crucial moment by Bronze.\n13:01 , George Flood\n26 mins: That’s an inch-perfect tackle from Eriksson inside her own box to thwart Barca’s latest attack.\nThe Chelsea skipper had to get that right and she did. Terrific challenge.\nDom Smith at Stamford Bridge\n12:59 , George Flood\nLooked ever-so-tight that offside, but Kerr did ultimately look like she’d gone just a little too early.\nBut with Reiten then sticking the ball in the net, even though it was disallowed, it was a sign of Chelsea’s potency when they get it right.\nIt’s lifted the noise around Stamford Bridge.\nGOOAA....NO!\n12:58 , George Flood\n25 mins: Chelsea think they have an equaliser as Barcelona are cut apart for the first time today.\nIt’s a fine threaded pass to release Kerr, who quickly squares inside for Reiten.\nThe Norwegian takes a touch before coolly slotting under Panos, but the offside flag was up against Kerr.\n12:57 , George Flood\n24 mins: Solid defending from Chelsea’s Maren Mjelde as Paralluelo tried to turn home a decent cross from the right flank.\nThe Norwegian makes a potentially crucial block.\n12:55 , George Flood\n22 mins: Much better from Chelsea.\nKerr’s hopeful strike from the edge of the box deflects off Irene Paredes and is held comfortably by Panos.\nBut that was a decent passage of play, with Cuthbert’s lofted pass from the middle flicked on well by the otherwise quiet Reiten.\n12:52 , George Flood\n20 mins: Geyse is proving a thorn in Chelsea’s side and she’s hauled to the deck by Eriksson, who is lucky to avoid a booking.\nStill all one-way traffic at the Bridge, with waves of Barcelona pressure.\n12:51 , George Flood\n18 mins: Chelsea have Zecira Musovic on the bench if needed, but Berger is now back on her feet and looks fine to continue.\nChelsea’s Erin Cuthbert also goes over to the sideline for a plaster to be applied on a painful cut to her hand.\n12:50 , George Flood\n16 mins: Some concern for Chelsea now as Berger sits down in discomfort inside her penalty area and the physios are summoned on.\nThe break in play allows Emma Hayes to gather her players for a pep talk.\nBarca counterpart Jonatan Giraldez does the same.\nDom Smith at Stamford Bridge\n12:48 , George Flood\nBarca just so fluid, so comfortable, so composed on the ball. When they move it forward, they do it rapidly and Chelsea can’t get close.\nWhen they take it slow and pass it between themselves, they do it deftly and Chelsea still can’t get close.\n12:48 , George Flood\n14 mins: It’s looking ominous for Chelsea at the moment as effortlessly fluid Barcelona pour forward once more.\nBrazilian forward Geyse creates space for another warning shot that is well dealt with by Berger.\n12:45 , George Flood\n12 mins: It’s all a bit aimless from Chelsea as they search for a route back into this first-leg tie.\nKerr needs far better service than some of these panicked drilled balls forward.\nThe Blues are caught in possession in a dangerous area and Hansen’s low drive is held by Berger.\n12:44 , George Flood\n10 mins: Barcelona are back on the ball and playing some nifty football in the opposition half as usual - Chelsea look especially vulnerable down their left side, from where Hansen was allowed to ghost across all too easily.\nBut there is promise from Chelsea on the counter, if they can find the right pass to release the dangerous Kerr.\n12:41 , George Flood\n7 mins: Chelsea, to their credit, have responded well to that early setback.\nThey have settled into the game a bit and are seeing far more of the ball around the Barca box.\nNo chances to speak of just yet though.\nDom Smith at Stamford Bridge\n12:39 , George Flood\nTruly, what a phenomenal goal that was from Barcelona — and what a start from the firm favourites.\nCaroline Graham Hansen cuts in from the right, no one in blue gets remotely close to her, and she curls into the net from range. Nightmare start from the hosts.\nGOAL! Chelsea 0-1 Barcelona | Caroline Graham Hansen 4'\n12:36 , George Flood\n4 mins: What a goal and what a start from Barcelona!\nHansen cuts in off the right flank and goes past a couple of Chelsea defenders before rifling an unstoppable effort beyond the despairing Berger and into the back of the net.\nSublime strike. Memories of Gothenburg coming flooding back...\n12:35 , George Flood\n3 mins: A couple of good early defensive contributions from Carter for Chelsea as Barca monopolise possession from the off.\nChelsea try a long ball to release Sam Kerr on the counter, but Mapi Leon gets there first and is then taken out by the Australian forward, who gets a warning.\n12:34 , George Flood\n2 min: Barcelona settle into some early possession in that striking gold away strip, with Chelsea all in blue.\nA long cross is drilled into the box towards the head of Caroline Graham Hansen, but it’s well cleared by Jess Carter.\nLooks like Chelsea are going with a back five this afternoon.\nKICK-OFF\n12:31 , George Flood\nWe are underway in the Women’s Champions League semi-finals!\nCan Chelsea secure a positive result to take back to the Camp Nou on Thursday?\nJana Adamkova from the Czech Republic is today’s referee.\nGreat noise around Stamford Bridge as this game gets off and running.\n12:27 , George Flood\nHere come the two teams, led out by respective captains Magda Eriksson and Sandra Panos.\nDom Smith at Stamford Bridge\n12:26 , George Flood\nThe sun has decided to peer through the clouds just ahead of kick-off. How thoughtful. Lovely day for it.\n12:21 , George Flood\nFinal preparations at Stamford Bridge, where the atmosphere has been building very nicely indeed.\nKick-off is now less than 10 minutes away!\nDom Smith at Stamford Bridge\n12:15 , George Flood\nChelsea have their first-choice centre-back pairing out injured today, with Millie Bright and Canada’s Kadeisha Buchanan both injured.\nWith Pernille Harder and Fran Kirby also out, the Blues really are the walking wounded. Barcelona perhaps not the ideal opponents then... But it would, at least, make a shock Chelsea win feel all the sweeter!\nHayes hails inspirational Chelsea captain Eriksson\n12:12 , George Flood\nChelsea captain Magda Eriksson starts as usual today and Emma Hayes has been effusive in her praise of the Swede this week.\nHowever, the skipper’s future remains uncertain with her current contract at Stamford Bridge due to expire in the summer.\n“I would be here all day to describe everything Magda has done for this football club, and for me as our captain,” said Hayes.\n“Together we have built a team that has competed on all fronts. I know every step of the journey we have been on, side by side, to push this team to where it is.”\nStandard Sport’s Dom Smith at Stamford Bridge\n11:56 , George Flood\nStandard Sport’s Dom Smith is in position and offers his pre-match thoughts from Stamford Bridge:\n🗣️ \"This is as tough a test as it gets for Chelsea.\"@MrDomSmith is in position at Stamford Bridge to preview #ChelseaBarça.\nLIVE: https://t.co/QdOeYq2mT1#UWCL pic.twitter.com/0cA3Q0Td5o— Standard Sport (@standardsport) April 22, 2023\n11:53 , George Flood\nChelsea defenders Millie Bright and Kadeisha Buchanan both miss out through injury today, but they are at the Bridge cheering on their team-mates and have sent a good luck message.\nA good luck message from two of our Blues! 🫶#UWCL pic.twitter.com/xEWhyaKeWo\n— Chelsea FC Women (@ChelseaFCW) April 22, 2023\nBronze and Paralluelo come in for Barcelona\n11:33 , George Flood\nI also make that two changes from Barcelona coach Jonatan Giraldez to the team that thrashed Atletico Madrid 4-0 in Liga F last weekend.\nEngland’s Lucy Bronze returns at right-back in place of Marta Torrejon, rejoining fellow Lioness hero Keira Walsh in the starting XI.\nBarca’s other alteration is on the left of their attack, where Vicky Lopez makes way for Salma Paralluelo.\nNo Alexia Putellas just yet, as expected.\nTwo Chelsea changes as Berger returns\n11:25 , George Flood\nEmma Hayes makes two changes to the Chelsea team that beat Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-finals last weekend.\nQuarter-final shootout hero Ann-Katrin Berger is back in goal in place of Zecira Musovic.\nNiamh Charles also comes in for Lauren James, who is on the bench.\nIs that a back three or a back four?\nPernille Harder is among the substitutes once more.\nBarcelona lineup\n11:18 , George Flood\nStarting XI: Panos, Bronze, Paredes, Mapi Leon, Rolfo, Patri, Walsh, Bonmati, Graham, Geyse, Paralluelo\nSubs: Coll, Codina, Jana, Pina, Crnogorcevic, Marta, Mariona, Bruna, Oshoala, Nuria, Engen, Vicky Lopez\nChelsea lineup\n11:14 , George Flood\nStarting XI: Berger, Perisset, Mjelde, Eriksson, Carter, Cuthbert, Leupolz, Cankovic, Charles, Kerr, Reiten\nSubs: Musovic, Orman, Ingle, James, Fleming, Kaneryd, Harder, Abdullina\nConfident Guro Reiten vows Chelsea revenge\n11:10 , George Flood\nChelsea winger Guro Reiten was singing from the same hymn sheet as her manager during an exclusive interview with Standard Sport this week.\n“I don’t think it was damaging,” the Norwegian said of that 2021 final. “Against the best, you can’t concede early, because they’ll eat you alive.\n“We’ve just got to show that we have learned from that experience and are a better team now than we were.\n“It’s been a few really good days. We’ve had some good sessions preparing. We love to play in front of our fans. They follow us everywhere. Chelsea belongs in Stamford Bridge, so why shouldn’t we play there?\n“Last few years, they’ve barely lost a game. Normally, the pressure is on us. In this game it’s a bit different. We don’t always play the most beautiful football, but when it matters most, we have been ruthless and been best.\n“Everyone keeps talking about Barcelona, ‘They are the favourites, blah, blah, blah’. I don’t care. We are a great team, and we are going to show it.”\nRead the interview in full here\nHayes: Chelsea have learned from 2021 final thrashing\n11:04 , George Flood\nThat fateful final in Gothenburg two years ago was the only previous competitive meeting between these sides.\nChelsea were absolutely blitzed and shipped all four goals in the opening 36 minutes, with an early OG from Melanie Leupolz followed by an Alexia Putellas penalty and further efforts from Aitana Bonmati and Caroline Hansen.\nSuch a painful defeat stopped Emma Hayes’ side from winning an unprecedented quadruple as they scooped the WSL title, FA Cup and League Cup trophies back home.\nBut so many involved with Chelsea this week have been keen to stress how they quickly learned the lessons from that sobering night in Sweden.\n“Every team evolves,” Hayes said on Friday. “Barca have improved in lots of ways. They’ve developed more experience, changed players, and added different dimensions. Equally so have we. We are more experienced than we were two years ago.\n“I always take any loss as a learning. The learnings from that night were significant for us as a club. You have to have that. You have to go through those moments. I’m pretty certain Magda and I have had 1000 conversations since then about how to keep raising the bar for our team. We have done that.\n“We expect to be in semi-finals. We have had a lot of winning in the last two years, and we’re as prepared as we can be going into the game. I like the feeling of going in with those experiences. We know what to expect. We are better off as a result of that night.”\n10:51 , George Flood\nThe calm before the storm at Stamford Bridge, where ticket sales for today’s game have exceeded the 25,000 mark.\nIt should be some occasion!\nChelsea vs Barcelona prediction\n10:41 , George Flood\nA potentially costly 2-0 loss away at WSL title rivals Manchester City is the only recent blot on Chelsea’s otherwise impressive copybook.\nEmma Hayes’ side have otherwise been in stellar form, with Sam Kerr's second-half header seeing off Aston Villa last Sunday in Walsall and teeing up an FA Cup showdown against Manchester United.\nTheir penalty shootout win over Champions League holders Lyon in the quarter-finals was as dramatic as it gets after Maren Mjelde’s controversial last-gasp spot-kick that levelled a thrilling tie in extra time.\nThey will be full of confidence, though this Barcelona juggernaut are such a tough assignment. They smashed Roma 6-1 on aggregate in the quarters and have lost just ONE league game since the start of the 2019/20 season in Spain.\nDefeat by Lyon in last year’s final and in the group stage against Bayern Munich shows they are not infallible, but few would bet against them taking a healthy lead back to the Camp Nou in their bid to reach a third successive European showpiece.\nBarcelona to win, 3-1.\nBarcelona team news\n10:31 , George Flood\nThe major fitness news from a Barcelona perspective is that superstar Alexia Putellas could make her much-anticipated comeback from injury in this semi-final tie.\nThe Ballon d’Or holder suffered a heartbreaking ruptured ACL during Spain training before the European Championship last summer and has been on the comeback trail ever since.\nPutellas has made the trip to west London today, though is not named in Barca’s official travelling squad.\nHowever, it seems she could play some part in the return fixture at the Camp Nou on Thursday evening, all being well.\nChelsea team news\n10:27 , George Flood\nChelsea boss Emma Hayes revealed at Friday’s pre-match press conference that England defender Millie Bright would miss several more weeks yet after a cleanout of a bony cartilage lesion in her knee.\nFellow centre-back Kadeisha Buchanan also remains out, along with Lioness Fran Kirby and Czech midfielder Katerina Svitkova.\nHowever, Danish forward Pernille Harder is ready to play after being an unused substitute in the FA Cup semi-final win over Aston Villa last weekend.\nShe has not featured competitively since November due to a hamstring injury suffered on international duty.\nHow to watch Chelsea vs Barcelona\n10:20 , George Flood\nTV channel: In the UK, today’s game will be available to watch live via DAZN.\nLive stream: The DAZN website will broadcast the game online and a free stream is also available via DAZN’s YouTube channel.\nWelcome to Chelsea vs Barcelona LIVE coverage!\n10:18 , George Flood\nGood morning and welcome to Standard Sport’s LIVE coverage of Chelsea vs Barcelona in the Women’s Champions League semi-finals.\nMore than 25,000 spectators are anticipated at Stamford Bridge this lunchtime as Emma Hayes’ side battle Europe’s most formidable outfit in a massive first-leg showdown.\nKick-off this afternoon is at 12:30pm BST, so stay tuned for live updates plus all the latest team news and build-up.
