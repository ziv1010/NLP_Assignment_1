Use a VPN to watch the Premier League with your subscription from anywhere.\nArsenal kick off their Premier League 2023/24 campaign against Nottingham Forest on Saturday, in what is a pivotal season for the Gunners under Mikel Arteta.\nAfter leading the table for so long last term, a capitulation at the end certainly stung - though now it's providing the motivation for Arsenal to come back fit and firing. Declan Rice, Kai Havertz and Jurrien Timber have all strengthened the squad, in what they hope will be Premier League champions come May.\nStanding in their way on opening day is Nottingham Forest, who are looking to build on their survival in 2022/23. Steve Cooper hasn't had to integrate as many signings this time around either, giving the Welshman more time to develop his playing style with Forest.\nKick-off is at 12.30pm BST. Make sure you know how to watch the Premier League wherever you are.\nTeam news\nMikel Arteta has named the following Arsenal starting 11: (4-3-3) Aaron Ramsdale; Thomas Partey, Ben White, William Saliba, Jurrien Timber; Martin Odegaard (captain), Declan Rice, Kai Havertz; Bukayo Saka, Eddie Nketiah, Gabriel Martinelli\nSteve Cooper has selected the following Nottingham Forest starting 11: (3-4-3) Matt Turner; Willy Boly, Joe Worrall (captain), Scott McKenna; Serge Aurier, Ryan Yates, Orel Mangala, Ola Aina; Danilo, Brennan Johnson, Morgan Gibbs-White\nForm\nArsenal come into the opening game of the domestic season off of beating Manchester City in the Community Shield on penalties, following their second-place finish last term.\nForest managed to avoid the drop by coming 16th themselves, and will be hoping for a more comfortable season under manager Steve Cooper.\nReferee\nMichael Oliver will be the referee for Arsenal vs Nottingham Forest. His assistants will be Stuart Burt and Dan Cook, with Darren Bond the fourth official. Jarred Gillett is the VAR, with Darren Cann the assistant VAR.\nStadium\nArsenal vs Nottingham Forest will be played at the 60,704-capacity Emirates Stadium in Holloway, London.\nKick-off and channel\nArsenal vs Nottingham Forest kick-off is at 12.30pm BST on Saturday 12 August in the UK. The game is on TNT Sports in the UK.\nIn the US, kick-off time is 7.30am ET / 4.30am PT. The match will be shown on NBC in the US. See below for international broadcast options.\nVPN guide\nUse a VPN to watch Premier League football from outside your country\nIf you’re out of the country for a Premier League fixture, then you won't be able to watch on your domestic streaming service as usual. The broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!) and blocks you from watching it. You can use a VPN to get around that, though, without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and will let you watch. And all the info going between is entirely encrypted, anonymous and safe – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there. For the Premier League, FourFourTwo currently recommends:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS5 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price.
