He may well return to going solo in due course, but for the time being, Liverpool can rest assured that they have attracted a coach who has devoted his life to studying the sport.\nEver since his mother brought him to their local youth side, Linker Maas Oever Rotterdam (LMO, meaning Left Bank of the River Maas, which runs through Rotterdam), just a few hundred metres from their house, it was clear that football was the game for him.\nThe club was based in the more humble part of the city, but the joy on his face as an eight-year-old was replicated in many moments throughout his career.\nThose drainpipe legs grew and grew, and some years later pinged a 40-yard shot into the top corner in a World Cup semi-final, while the blue and white kit was swapped for the famous Oranje of the Netherlands 106 times, the fifth most of any player.\nLMO’s pride in their former youngster’s success is clear. Van Bronckhorst has remained a permanent presence at the club’s ground since his playing career rocketed into the big time, spanning spells at Feyenoord, Rangers, Arsenal and Barcelona, where he won the Champions League.\nWhen The Athletic visited in 2023, two huge pictures hung on the wall above the sink in the canteen: one of him as an LMO player and another celebrating his goal to beat Uruguay to help send the national team into the 2010 World Cup final.\nThe contrast serves as an inspiration to the kids whose lockers are just to the left. Van Bronckhorst is used as an example to the next generation coming through, even though he was only there for a season before Feyenoord signed him up.\nAdvertisement\nVan Bronckhorst’s life after retiring as a player has created an interesting chapter that still needs completing. The 50-year-old won the league at Feyenoord as manager in 2017, then plotted a fanciful adventure to the Europa League final in 2022 with Rangers. A five-month spell at Besiktas in 2024 was less happy, Van Bronckhorst becoming collateral damage in a chaotic period when 10 different people were in charge over a three-year period.\nHe has since turned down other head coach opportunities after thinking carefully about the next step. Yet when Liverpool came calling in the wake of John Heitinga’s departure for Ajax, it felt like the perfect fit.\nSporting director Richard Hughes wanted a strong addition to the backroom team and felt Van Bronckhorst, with his experience as a No 1, would be a good choice.\nDiscussions with Slot followed and the pair immediately hit it off through a shared vision on playing style and ambition. Although their Feyenoord links and previous encounters within football have occasionally brought the pair together, there’s no previous relationship to turn to, and Van Bronckhorst is joining for his coaching acumen above anything else.\nReturning to the Premier League was always on his wish list and already there’s a determination to add to his trophy haul by continuing to make Liverpool a success in the years ahead.\nVan Bronckhorst’s third-generation Moluccan heritage forms a major part of his identity and offers a window into what has given him his understated steeliness.\nThe Moluccans are an archipelago in the east of Indonesia, home to more than two million people. Just under 70,000 Moluccans live in the Netherlands. The initial relationship between the nations stretches back to the Netherlands’ attempt to monopolise the spice market, which led to the nickname “Spice Islands”, but after the industry collapsed, Moluccans came to represent a different type of value, and that was in their fighting ability.\nAdvertisement\nVan Bronckhorst rose through the ranks to make his debut for Feyenoord in 1994 after a season on loan at RKC Waalwijk. He credits his youth coach, Maup Martens, as one of his most influential mentors, for introducing him to the basic style of play that would shape his career.\nIt was not a golden era to be playing for Feyenoord, though, and after four seasons, he made his move to Rangers in 1998. He was working under Dutch coach Dick Advocaat, but his assistant, Bert van Lingen, had known him since he was 14, as he took care of the Dutch national youth squads.\n“He is one of my examples to players,” Van Lingen told The Athletic in 2022. “He is talented, co-operative, a nice guy and wants to learn. We always said, ‘With Gio, you don’t get trouble’, and he quickly became one of the main figures. He was experienced and had a strong family to make it a healthy situation. Clarence Seedorf was the same. No bad agents; they let their fathers help.”\nAdvocaat was a renowned disciplinarian, but Van Bronckhorst would have learned important principles that now serve him as a coach.\n“Even then, Gio influenced other players as he could read ahead what was going to happen,” says Van Lingen. “The team became more intelligent as some games were very rough and it was about fouling and fighting. The younger players like Gio understood that to score, you need to keep the ball. He was always thinking about what the coach was doing. He’s not impulsive, he’s balanced — and being stable is a talent. His upbringing plays a part in that.”\nVan Bronckhorst’s playing career exposed him to top coaches, including Arsene Wenger at Arsenal and Frank Rijkaard at Barcelona. He’s said previously that the latter was the most similar to him in terms of his mood when approaching big games. He returned to Feyenoord for the final three years of his playing career before he became Ronald Koeman’s assistant at De Kuip. When Koeman’s successor, Fred Rutten, could not help Feyenoord make that step up to champions, Van Bronckhorst was promoted. That meant calling upon a close ally of a familiar face.\nJan Wouters joined Rangers as assistant in 2001, just after Van Bronckhorst had left for Arsenal, although the pair did work together at the 2004 European Championship when Wouters was Advocaat’s assistant with Holland.\nAdvertisement\nVan Bronckhorst asked Wouters to join him in Rotterdam, while Advocaat would come once a week to discuss things with him, but even so, Van Bronckhorst found himself under early pressure, a run of seven games without a win leading to fans whistling.\n“We had bad results, but we missed chances, so we never lost sight of the reality. The next time we played that opponent, we tended to beat them,” says Wouters. “He didn’t have the best players in the league. His two centre-backs could build up, but defensively they were not the best. He played to each player’s best qualities.\n“He has a broader style. It’s not just the Dutch 4-3-3, he knows 3-5-2 and 5-3-2, too. In Holland, everyone says pressure and forward running, but Gio knows you don’t play like crazy men. If you’re not good enough to build up, why should you? You can be more direct.”\nThat strong will was enough for Van Bronckhorst to win the KVNB Cup in 2016, but the signings of Brad Jones, Steven Berghuis and Nicolai Jorgensen that summer were the spark for a charge the following season, which yielded the club’s first title in 17 years.\nHe managed it while using several academy players, but the climax of the season tested his bravery in another way. With four games to go and the race neck and neck with Ajax, he dropped veteran Dirk Kuyt for three games before bringing him back in for the final-day decider. He scored a hat-trick to seal the league.\n“It wasn’t about Gio or Dirk, it was about what was best for Feyenoord,” says Wouters. “If you try to be something or someone, it doesn’t work. Gio comes across the way he is naturally. He’s a little laidback, but if things aren’t going their way, he will be the boss. Raising your voice is not the same as losing your temper.”\nWouters says one of the most impressive things about Van Bronckhorst is how hands-on he is with training and analysis. He would watch every game back and every training session, including Friday’s 11-vs-11 sessions, to show the good and bad points of how they had executed the plan before a matchday.\nAdvertisement\nVan Bronckhorst’s next managerial role came at Guangzhou R&F, but that was only after he took six months out to explore best practices and look for ways to grow his knowledge at City Football Group, the collection of clubs that also includes Manchester City.\nHe had an existing relationship with City director of football Txiki Begiristain, the man who signed him for Barcelona in 2004, but he is also close friends with Claudio Reyna, then sporting director at New York City and who introduced him to the idea of taking a sabbatical to get to know CFG’s inner workings.\nHe was paired with CFG’s head of coaching support, Ceri Bowley, whose role was to recruit all first-team coaches and develop them in line with the group’s principles.\n“He was there to learn. It was about, ‘What do I know and what can I add?’,” Bowley, now the chief soccer officer and sporting director of U.S. National Women’s Soccer League team North Carolina Courage, told The Athletic. “For us, it was with a view that if something came up in CFG, he could be a potential coach.”\nUsually, Bowley would work with coaches for a week or two, but Van Bronckhorst stayed for six months to learn the methodology, including watching Guardiola’s coaching sessions and chatting to him after Champions League nights at the Etihad.\n“In the game, people talk about methodology, but most are talking about philosophy. There is a misconception,” says Bowley. “Like in academia, your methodology is the process for getting that end result, no matter what that is. If the aim is to play a certain way, it is about how you get there and how you teach it.\n“One of the other biggest conversations we had was around having cognitive diversity in your staff. Some managers take the same staff everywhere, but Fergie (Sir Alex Ferguson) was the master of changing it up. You need people who think differently from you but also see it through your lens. He (Van Bronckhorst) is incredibly intelligent.\nAdvertisement\n“When you sit and watch it with him, he sees it straight away. People say, ‘He’s an ex-player, he should’, but I’ve had plenty of ex-players who don’t. The level of humility and selflessness is why he’s as good as he is. He wants to learn every day from everyone.”\nBowley would join Van Bronckhorst at Rangers, where he managed for two years and fell agonisingly short of a first European trophy since 1972 when his team lost a penalty shootout to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League final.\nHe focused heavily on video sessions and analysis work, consistent with his time at Feyenoord, and was a stickler for details and discipline. The longer he stayed at the club, the more the analysis increased, including going over the previous match and combing through his own team’s style rather than focusing mainly on the opposition.\nFailing to keep up with Glasgow rivals Celtic in the league and then overseeing the worst group stage campaign in Champions League history — Rangers lost six games against Liverpool, Napoli and Ajax, ending with a goal difference of minus-20 — ultimately played a part in his exit.\nRangers, however, have failed to kick on since and given the short-lived period at Besiktas, Van Bronckhorst still has a set of unanswered questions next to his name, too.\nMaking an impact at Liverpool may provide a degree of clarity and potentially set up a new challenge for the future. Heitinga is proof that being part of the backroom staff at a Premier League giant can lead to a major European No 1 job.\nRight now though, he is focused on supporting Slot and his assistant Sipke Hulshoff in a role that was only made available to a coach with the vast experience and know-how that Van Bronckhorst has steadily built up over the years.\nHe doesn’t see it as a drop-down, and Liverpool are excited as their push to go again continues.\n(Top photo: Marcel van Dorst / EYE4images/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
