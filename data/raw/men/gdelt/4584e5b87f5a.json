United appreciate the player.”\nRomano has provided a very positive update on the situation by claiming that “what we can add today is that PSG are prepared to sell the player. PSG are open to selling the player. This is the point. They are absolutely not closing the door to the possibility of Ugarte leaving the club after just one season.”\nIt is also reported that United are still in contact with the Parisians to try and iron out a deal for the defensive midfielder.\n“There are discussions ongoing once again between United and PSG. The two clubs after initial contact at the start of the week are still in discussion in the last days and hours.”\nRomano also backed up other sources’ claim that Ugarte would love the chance to play at Old Trafford by stating, “we can add that Ugarte would be keen on a move to Man United even without Champions League football. Ugarte is a strong candidate for Man United in the midfield.”\nThe midfielder has been praised for his work on and off the ball, having been described as having “unique characteristics for a player in that position”. Analysts note that “it is very difficult to find a defensive midfielder [like him] that is well-developed technically with good decision-making in the build-up and is also very aggressive without the ball.”\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
