  "body_text": "It has been a wondrously wonky Bundesliga season that could feasibly end with Bo Svensson’s brave Mainz in the Europa League, Union Berlin and Freiburg both making the Champions League for the first time and the sun setting on Bayern Munich’s empire of eternal dominance. Yet Bayer Leverkusen’s 13-game unbeaten transformation from relegation contenders to top-four material and last flag-bearers of German football in European competition might be the most miraculous development of all.\nAdvertisement\nOr maybe it’s not such a miracle. It’s long been obvious that Xabi Alonso, brought in to rescue the season just before the winter break, is a smart operator. The 41-year-old had carefully studied last year’s fourth-placed side before signing up and realised soon enough that the team’s footballing qualities were beyond reproach. All that was missing — aside from the return of golden boy Florian Wirtz — in a slightly tricky dressing room was a bit of “self-confidence and positive atmosphere”, Alonso told Sueddeutsche Zeitung in January.\nBayer’s unique position in the Bundesliga food chain made the mission even more appealing — the small size of the city and fanbase allows coaches to work in relative peace. The risk-reward calculation, Alonso figured, made them a perfect place to learn the ropes at a pretty high but not overly pressurised level.\nWhen he wasn’t personally instructing his men on the training pitch, still spraying passes with the elegant authority that marked him out as a midfielder, the Spaniard talked to each and every player extensively in an effort to raise morale. “I’m not a drill sergeant, ruling the dressing room with an iron fist,” he said about his leadership style. Staff members are jokingly referring to his “reign of terror”, but he has shown an uncompromising focus on discipline and high standards in all aspects of the players’ professional lives.\nTactically, the early emphasis was on defensive solidity and counter-attacks, but Leverkusen have recently added more control and guile in possession to the mix. Less than half a year into his first job at top-flight level, Alonso’s side are now equally comfortable in a back three or back four, with the ball and without.\nThis week, their best of the campaign yet, they went to Union Saint-Gilloise and destroyed them 4-1 to earn a trip to Jose Mourinho’s Roma in the Europa League semi-finals, then held a dangerous RB Leipzig at bay in convincing fashion. A precision counter-attack (1-0, Adam Hlozek) and penalty (2-0, Nadiem Amiri) were all it took to secure three points.\nAdvertisement\nFittingly for their new-found resilience, centre-back Jonathan Tah was the best man on the pitch. After half a career of never quite living up to his considerable potential — a bit like Leverkusen — the 27-year-old is performing with unprecedented consistency. A 16-cap Germany international, Tah has emerged as one of the more unlikely faces of Bayer’s return to the elite. “We’re on an outstanding run, picking up more energy for the next games as we go,” he said after the final whistle at a very happy BayArena on Sunday night.\nMost pleasing for Alonso was the fact his side have learned to perform without key personnel. Wirtz, one of the less convincing forwards in the midweek win in Belgium, missed the engagement with Leipzig with a stomach complaint. Centre-back Edmond Tapsoba, forward Patrik Schick and midfielder Exequiel Palacios were also late casualties, but Leverkusen’s collective resilience was such that the quartet’s absence hardly registered.\nThe club’s first appearance in a European semi-final since the so-nearly golden year of 2002 — when Leverkusen finished runners-up in the Champions League, Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal — has the club cautiously dreaming of silverware. Realistically, they’ll only have the chance to make the history books this year or next, as some of the stars such as Moussa Diaby, Amine Adli, Wirtz and Alonso are bound to leave for greater things before too long. But it’s been ever thus at Bayer. The time to enjoy this team is now.\nThe Alonso/Leverkusen partnership will continue to catch the eye in the coming weeks, but in their own way, Mainz are just as impressive. Svensson has created the league’s best pressing side, an all-fighting, all-running, all-action machine that produces pretty nice football, too.\nOn Saturday, the Dane, who had played five years under Thomas Tuchel at Mainz, beat his former teacher 3-1 to extend their unbeaten run to 10 matches. Funnily enough, Mainz weren’t particularly brilliant by their own standards, but when they started taking risks, Bayern Munich’s back line was torn apart like an overdone Weisswurst. Having swept the lethargic visitors away, Mainz are seventh and have a realistic prospect of securing European football for the first time since 2016-17.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s not just Svensson’s doing. CEO Christian Heidel and sporting director Martin Schmidt solved key problems by signing French forward Ludovic Ajorque (Strasbourg, €6million) and Norwegian centre-back Andreas Hanche-Olsen (Gent, €2.5million) in January. The pair have been a revelation at their respective ends of the pitch, adding oomph in both boxes. If only some of the bigger clubs were run as well as Mainz are, the league would be in a much better place.\nBut let’s talk Bayern. Ten days from declaring himself madly in love with his team, Tuchel looked more like a man reassessing his life choices the morning after a drunken spur-of-the-moment wedding with a stranger in Las Vegas. His re-jigged team (a back three, Thomas Muller and goalscorer Sadio Mane in attack) started well enough in the first half, but after the break, an embarrassing stream of misplaced passes and lack of energy led to a complete breakdown. “We are totally devoid of any spark,” Tuchel said after the worst showing of his seven-game tenure so far.\nThe contrast with the decent performance at home to Manchester City three days before couldn’t have been more unsettling. With each passing day in the job, Tuchel seems to know less about this weirdly capricious, fragile team, an ensemble of individuals who have become unpredictable to the point of being uncoachable. No wonder Tuchel spoke of having been in Munich for “three and a half years” (instead of weeks) by mistake. His powerlessness in bringing stability to the side must feel like long, drawn-out agony right now.\nBayern’s defeat and their loss of the number one spot after Borussia Dortmund’s no-nonsense 4-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt did little to quell nasty rumours about honorary president Uli Hoeness losing patience with CEO Oliver Kahn. The advisory board are reluctant to add fuel to the fire and won’t formally consider a change at the top until a meeting at the end of May, but the official silence in the face of well-sourced reports about Kahn losing favour has been deafening. It feels as if the club have declared open season on themselves. Yes, Bayern might not win an 11th successive championship — Gott im Himmel! — but current sporting crises, as well as concerns over the timing of Julian Nagelsmann’s sacking and the squad composition, are, in truth, only used to settle old accounts.\nHoeness has long eyed Kahn’s leadership style suspiciously. Others are having a go at sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic, the man most supporters seem to blame for the malaise. Bild, meanwhile, is proposing the return of Karl-Heinz Rummenigge to the chief executive job in Kahn’s place. The 67-year-old, who was effectively forced out by Hoeness, has been a frequent guest on the tabloid’s television channel after his retirement.\nIt’s not clear if many players are overly affected by the boardroom power struggle. “An interesting question,” Muller called it in reply to a TV reporter’s query on Saturday, but it surely can’t help when it comes to creating at least the tiniest amount of positivity and togetherness for the past five games of the season. Bayern, so long a byword for unshaken self-belief and monolithic power, are lost in a nightmare of their own making.\n(Top photo: Xabi Alonso; by Sascha Schuermann/AFP via Getty Images)",
