UEFA has not taken any action against Rubiales, who gets paid 250,000 euros ($419,000) for his role as a vice president.\n\"Spanish soccer is going through bad moments right now,\" Bonmatí said. \"We won the World Cup, but we're not talking a lot about that because of some things I rather not ignore.\"\nThe issue was also raised on stage by the winner of the coaching award in women's soccer, Sarina Wiegman.\nWiegman praised the Spanish players who beat her England team 1-0 in the final for playing \"such great football that everyone enjoyed.\"\n\"This team deserves to be celebrated and deserves to be listened to,\" Wiegman said toward the end of her acceptance speech, minutes before Bonmatí went on stage.\n\"We all know the issues around the Spanish team,\" the Dutch coach said. \"It really hurts me as a coach, a mother of two daughters, as a wife and human being.\"\nPraising the progress made in the game, Wiegman also cautioned: \"There is also still a long way to go in women's football and in society.\"\nWiegman won the vote for best coach in women's soccer ahead of two Spanish men — the controversial Spain national team coach Jorge Vilda and Jonatan Giráldez of Barcelona, who led a team including Bonmatí to win the Women's Champions League.\nBonmatí was among 15 players who rebelled against Vilda's coaching style and refused to play for him. She was among only three players who returned and were selected for the World Cup.\nDozens of Spanish players, including Olga Carmona who also was nominated for the UEFA award, are now refusing to play for the national team while Rubiales continues to lead the federation.\nUEFA's top officials were silent on Rubiales for 10 days until its president Aleksander Ceferin called his conduct \"inappropriate\" in an interview on Wednesday with French daily L'Equipe.\nAfter the ceremony on Thursday, UEFA's head of women's football Nadine Kessler said the award winners had been \"gracious and very respectful\" in their speeches.\n\"They stand for more than just their perfect performances,\" Kessler said.\nAP",
