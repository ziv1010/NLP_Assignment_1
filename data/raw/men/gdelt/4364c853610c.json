Man Utd sit sixth in the Premier League, having picked up 54 points from 34 games with 12 defeats so far.\nThey were also disappointing in their brief return to the Champions League, finishing dead last in Group A behind Bayern Munich, Copenhagen and Galatasaray. They conceded 15 goals in their six games - only Royal Antwerp (17) let in more.\nDortmund currently sit fifth in the Bundesliga but that position will be enough to qualify for Europe's top-tier competition thanks to Germany's high UEFA coefficient score.",
