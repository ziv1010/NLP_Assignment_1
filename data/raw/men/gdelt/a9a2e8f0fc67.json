The youngster would also be keen to push through a proposed switch to join up with Enzo Maresca’s side.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

I am not aware of interest from AC Milan or Chelsea,’ he told Colombian outlet Win Sports TV.\nMore Trending\n‘They are giant clubs, and it would be a pleasure but I have no knowledge of anything.’\nDuran’s agent, Jonathan Herrera, meanwhile, talked up a move to west London before Mauricio Pochettino left the club last month.\nThe interest has always been there. The fact that Pochettino continues or leaves the club [shouldn’t affect that]. The one who wants him in the end is the club,’ Herrara said.\n‘He is a player that if they change coach or not, we will see what happens, but there has always been interest. Let’s see how we can handle it and make sure Aston Villa are ready.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Manchester United finally make decision over Erik ten Hag’s future after end-of-season review\nMORE: Michael Olise should be ‘at the top of Manchester United’s wishlist’, says Teddy Sheringham\nMORE: Arsenal weighing up summer transfer move for Sporting star Marcus Edwards",
