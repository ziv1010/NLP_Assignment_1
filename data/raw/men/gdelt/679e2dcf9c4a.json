But obviously, the more we can produce, I think the closer we are going to be to achieving what we want to do.\nMore Trending\n‘[The] defensive record is very good, but we need to be consistent; it’s only just the start of the season.\n‘The aim is to continue improving things, which we can still do a lot of, to do even better.’\nArsenal are aiming to win their first Premier League title since 2004 this term.\nThe Gunners have finished as top-flight runners-up for the last three seasons in a row.\nMORE: Man Utd ‘concern’ revealed after private talks with Premier League chief\nMORE: Bruno Fernandes names club he would love to play for amid Man Utd exit rumours\nMORE: Pep Guardiola makes Liverpool and Arsenal title prediction",
