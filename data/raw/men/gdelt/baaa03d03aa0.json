Rory Smith wrote for The Observer.\nSmith is very supportive on a regular basis of the status quo, giving his support to the financial gulf that exists between the usual suspects and those trying to close that yawning divide. The Observer journalist in this case declaring; ‘PSR is not perfect, but the alternative would be ruinous’\nThis is the excellent response from Aston Villa fan Warren Michael Holmes to Smith’s lame piece.)\nThe Rory Smith defence of PSR in the Observer perfectly encapsulates everything wrong with the current regulatory mindset\nHis argument – that ambitious clubs should simply “sell better” – reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how these rules operate in practice and whom they truly benefit.\nRory dismisses the concerns of Aston Villa and Newcastle United by pointing to our spending since promotion.\nThis misses the point entirely. The issue isn’t historical spending – it’s the regulatory ceiling that prevents sustained competition with the established elite.\nRory suggests Newcastle and Villa’s problems stem from poor selling. This ignores the brutal reality: when regulations force you to sell your best players to comply, you’re not “trading well” – you’re dismantling what you’ve built.\nAston Villa qualified for the Champions League then had to sell Luiz, Diaby, and Duran.\nNewcastle qualified for Europe, then faced identical pressures. This isn’t poor trading – it’s systematic dismantling disguised as financial responsibility.\nMeanwhile, Chelsea spend £300+ million by “selling” assets to themselves. The regulations don’t prevent spending – they favour those sophisticated enough to exploit loopholes while punishing straightforward investment.\nRory’s dismissal of the “Red Cartel” theory ignores reality. When Villa qualified for Europe, UEFA’s SCR rules immediately kicked in, limiting us to 70% of revenue on squad costs while non-European clubs face no such restrictions.\nThe system literally punishes success.\nUEFA’s own settlement with Villa proves the point: £20 million or more in potential fines, transfer restrictions that require selling before buying, and 3 years of financial monitoring. For what? Investing to compete.\nThe regulations aren’t revenue-neutral. They’re rigged toward clubs with established commercial advantages.\nChelsea’s London location generates £546m annually versus Villa’s £310m. That £236m difference creates massive PSR headroom before considering player sales.\nWhen regulations tie spending to revenue, they entrench existing hierarchies. Villa can’t outspend Manchester City because we can’t out-earn them – and the rules ensure we never will.\nRory argues regulations protect competition, but they’ve achieved the opposite. Look at the Premier League’s top six the last decade. The same clubs, in marginally different orders, year after year.\nThe Leicester City 2016 title proved competition was possible. Current regulations ensure it never happens again. That’s not protecting sport – it’s preserving sporting cartels!\nRory’s F1 comparison – F1 introduced cost caps to improve competition, but crucially, they applied equally to all teams. Premier League PSR creates different rules for different clubs based on revenue and European qualification.\nImagine F1 saying Mercedes could spend £200m because of their commercial success, while Williams were limited to £50m. That’s exactly how football operates now.\nNobody advocates unlimited spending. But current rules need fundamental reform:\nRevenue-based limits that account for owner investment\nEqual treatment regardless of historical commercial advantages\nRegulations that encourage competition, not entrench monopolies\nTransparent enforcement that doesn’t favor accounting creativity over sporting investment\nAston Villa and Newcastle United aren’t demanding to “replace the elite” – we’re demanding the right to compete with them. The current system ensures that remains impossible.\nHis article concludes that “sport decided by chequebook is not sport at all.” He’s absolutely right. But sport decided by spreadsheets and accounting loopholes isn’t sport either – it’s a rigged game masquerading as competition.\nThe Premier League failure to explain these regulations isn’t accidental btw. When your rules prevent the very competition they claim to protect, silence becomes the only defensible strategy.\n(To follow the author on X/Twitter go to @WarrenHolmes)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
