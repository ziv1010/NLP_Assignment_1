One of the best teams. The midfield – Odegaard, Declan Rice, Partey. Amazing players.”\nThe trio of Odegaard, Rice, and Partey has formed a remarkable pact in midfield that has destabilized several attacking teams in this season’s UCL.\nDuring the quarterfinal, Declan Rice’s freekick strikes did enough to help the Gunners see off Real Madrid in the quarterfinals.\nIn 11 Champions League appearances, Rice has made six goal contributions this season, Odegaard has registered four goal contributions in nine UCL fixtures, while Partey’s absence was felt by Arsenal supporters during the first leg in North London.",
