Borussia Dortmund (new entry)\nBorussia Dortmund earn a spot in the rankings this week thanks to their thumping 7-1 win over an in-form Celtic side in the Champions League in midweek.\nYes, 7-1, you did read that right.\nThe win was the club's biggest win ever in the Champions League. Nice one.\n9. Real Madrid (down 5)\nIf you've watched Real Madrid this season, you'll know that something's not quite clicking at the Champions League holders right now.\nBe that because of the signing of Kylian Mbappe, or the inability to replace the guile of Toni Kroos in midfield, Carlo Ancelotti's side have struggled to really put a marker down in 2024/25.\nThey were once again quite disappointing during their 1-0 defeat to LOSC Lille in midweek.\nA tactical rethink is needed at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n8. Barcelona (down 5)\nIt's fair to say it was a pretty mixed week for Barcelona.\nOn one hand, they comfortably beat a rather terrible Young Boys team 5-0 in the Champions League.\nOn the other, they suffered their first defeat of the La Liga season at the hands of a Bryan Zaragoza-inspired Osasuna.\nThe reason they're down five this week is because the latter much outweighs the former.\n7. Bayern Munich (down 6)\nIt was all going so, so well for Bayern Munich.\nAnd then they went to Villa Park.\nOverwhelmed by the raucous atmosphere in the midlands, and an energetic Aston Villa side, the Bavarian giants fell to a shock 1-0 defeat in midweek.\nThey'll have to improve massively on this performance if they're going to have any hope of winning the Champions League in 2024/25.\n6. Sporting CP (down 2)\nSomething rather unheard of happened this past week:\nViktor Gyokeres didn't score a single goal for Sporting CP in their 3-0 win over Estoril Praia or their 1-1 draw with PSV Eindhoven.\nThat may be the biggest shock of the 2024/25 season thus far.\n5. Bayer Leverkusen (up 1)\nBayer Leverkusen's credentials were really put to the test this past week with games against Bayern Munich and AC Milan.\nA draw with Bayern in the Bundesliga was followed up by an impressive 1-0 over Milan at San Siro.\nSuffice to say, those results show that Xabi Alonso's side mean business this season.\n4. Liverpool (re-entry)\nThe recent shock defeat to Nottingham Forest at Anfield could've really stopped Liverpool in their tracks under Arne Slot.\nInstead, the Reds took the defeat in their stride and have been utterly brilliant ever since.\nFive wins from five in all competitions in recent weeks tells you all you need to know.\n3. Manchester City (down 1)\nAs we seen in the weekend draw with Newcastle United, life without the injured Rodri may prove tricky for Manchester City against the top teams in Europe in 2024/25.\nAgainst lesser teams though, City have enough squad depth to cope - as evidenced by their 4-0 win over Slovan Bratislava in the Champions League in midweek.\n2. Juventus (up 9)\n- Goalkeeper sent off? Check.\n- Star defender tears ligaments in the first-half? Check.\n- Go behind on two occasions? Check.\n- Up against an immensely talented RB Leipzig team? Check.\nAnd yet, Juventus managed to secure an astonishing 3-2.\nWe're still scratching our heads and trying to work out they did it. A large part of it is thanks to Dusan Vlahovic, who put in a stunning centre forward performance at the Red Bull Arena.\n1. Arsenal (up 7)\nIf you need a sign that Arsenal are capable of winning the Premier League and Champions League in 2024/25, this past week was it.\nThe Gunners secured a dramatic 4-2 win over Leicester City with two late goals, before comfortably seeing off European giants PSG 2-0 a few days later.\nThey're very, very good, aren't they?",
