  "body_text": "Linkin Park fulfilled an unusual fan request while on tour in 2025.\nThe “In the End” rockers have shared a video to Facebook showing vocalists Mike Shinoda and Emily Armstrong reading signs brought in by concertgoers during a recent show. One particular sign caught their eye, and they brought it up onstage to discover that it read, “Would you make my dream come true and reveal our baby’s gender?”\n“This is a crazy sign, this is the first time we’ve seen this,” Shinoda remarked.\nThe sign was conveniently accompanied by an envelope that contained the gender reveal, and after a literal drumroll from Colin Brittain, Armstrong delivered the news.\n“Girl!” Armstrong declared.\nLinkin Park spent 2025 touring in support of their 2024 comeback album, From Zero, their first with Armstrong. They’ll return to the road in January starting with dates in the Middle East.\nCopyright © 2025, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",
