Three wins, three clean sheets, three goals against rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford. Easy.\nIt’s a start that will have supporters wondering how high they can dream this season. Is a title challenge now on? Would a top-four spot be a success?\nBut, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Dutch managers (officially a head coach here) and the Premier League don’t exactly have a great track record, so scepticism will not yet be completed smashed, although Slot’s preparation for the job has been meticulous, even watching training sessions from last season to learn more about the players he’s inheriting. It seems to have paid off.\nThere are plenty of areas Slot can learn from Klopp and where the German perhaps got it wrong in recent seasons. Primarily that would be a less chaotic, more controlled approach, and with it, hopefully, fewer injuries. Liverpool players missed an incredible 362 games combined due to injuries last term.\nSlot, who is perhaps more Guardiola than Klopp in his overall style of play, has been credited with some creative methods for keeping players fit and improving availability at Feyenoord, which would be very welcome at Anfield.\nEverything on the pitch is ticking along nicely, but Salah’s post-match musings about his contract could be a sign of bumps in the road coming into view. The Egyptian, along with Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold, have all entered the last year of their contracts. Is Slot up to deal with this level of off-field drama, under a spotlight more intense than he will ever have experienced? Only time will tell.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nLiverpool squad for 2024/25\nLiverpool squad for 2024/25: Arne Slot's full team\n- GK: Alisson Becker\n- GK: Vitezslav Jaros\n- GK: Caoimhin Kelleher\n- DF: Joe Gomez\n- DF: Virgil van Dijk\n- DF: Ibrahima Konate\n- DF: Kostas Tsimikas\n- DF: Andy Robertson\n- DF: Trent Alexander-Arnold\n- DF: Jarell Quansah\n- DF: Conor Bradley\n- MF: Wataru Endo\n- MF: Dominik Szoboszlai\n- MF: Alexis Mac Allister\n- MF: Curtis Jones\n- MF: Harvey Elliott\n- MF: Ryan Gravenberch\n- FW: Luis Diaz\n- FW: Darwin Nunez\n- FW: Mohamed Salah\n- FW: Federico Chiesa\n- FW: Cody Gakpo\n- FW: Diogo Jota\nLiverpool squad numbers for 2024/25\nLiverpool manager\nArne Slot\nAn unknown quantity. Inspired by Guardiola. A Klopp-like personality. Another Ten Hag? Arne Slot arrives with high-stock from the Dutch Eredivisie, and without the pandemic may have won titles with two different clubs in his homeland. Can he do it in the Premier League? We’re in the middle of finding out - and the early signs are promising.\nLiverpool's key player\nVirgil van Dijk\nPerhaps it will change under Slot, but Liverpool’s style of play under Klopp left them open at the back with such regularity that Virgil van Dijk became the key player by process. The captain will need to hold the fort for his compatriot and new boss.\nOne to watch\nDarwin Nunez\nErratic finishing cost Liverpool last season, and while Darwin Nunez scored 18 goals in total, only 11 were in the league and none were against a team in the top six. If Slot can channel Nunez’s inner zen and bring composure to his game, a ruthless, clinical forward would be a game-changer.\nThe mood\nAnfield did not mourn Klopp’s departure in May, it celebrated the German’s reign. But now it must find new energy to give Slot the backing that Klopp so enjoyed. The mood is uncertain, especially with so many changes in the backroom, too. Players will have a lot of new faces to encounter when they return for pre-season.\n“The change hopefully isn’t that big,” says Slot.\nMost likely to...\nPlay every game at 12.30pm. Of course, that’s the slot the new manager has been given for his first Premier League game in charge. Against a newly-promoted side, too – the fifth time in six seasons Liverpool have been given such opposition for the opening game. Welcome to England, Arne.\nView from the stands\nJack Lusby (@LusbyJack)\nLast season was completely unpredictable, with massive highs, fighting – convincingly – for four trophies and a body blow of a resignation. It wasn’t boring, at least!\nThe big talking point is what to expect from Arne Slot. An inconspicuous start has led to uncertainty over how things will play out; it’s still impossible to know what to expect post-Klopp.\nThis season will be different because, obviously, there’s a new man in the dugout – not only that, but it’s no longer a manager, but a head coach.\nI won’t be happy unless Slot is given time. Of course he’s not Klopp, but he deserves the opportunity to make his imprint on the squad he’s inherited.\nOur key player will be Alexis Mac Allister, who quickly became one of our most influential players in his first season at Anfield. He sets the tone in that side.\nOur most underrated player is Cody Gakpo. If he’s given the chances in his natural role on the left, he could have a huge season.\nLook out for Kieran Morrison. Liverpool have an enviable bank of talent, and the 17-year-old attacking midfielder is the next on that conveyor belt.\nFans think our owner is less shrewd than perhaps they are.\nThe opposition player I'd love here is Mohammed Kudus.\nThe opposition player who grinds my gears is Antony. All mouth, no trousers. One of the single worst signings in Premier League history.\nThe active player I'd love to have back is Roberto Firmino. He could have a job for life.\nThe player I'd happily drive to another club is Darwin Nunez.\nThe pantomime villain will be Darwin Nunez, again.\nThe thing my club really gets right is acknowledging the fans’ creativity. The tributes to Klopp alone showed how integral that support is off the pitch.\nThe one change I'd make would be publishing the matchday XI on socials in order of position, not numerical order. Who exactly is that for?!\nOur season ticket prices are steep, but not as steep as they could be. That seems like the minimum fans should be hoping for, but it’s nice that – at least for now – the normal fan is still being considered.\nI'm least looking forward to playing eight different teams in the Champions League 'group stage’. More football does not always mean better.\nThe fans' opinion of the gaffer is completely unknown. The jury is out on Arne Slot.\nIf he left, he should be replaced by… can I say Jurgen Klopp?!\nWe'll finish 3rd, again. Any title challenge may be a bridge too far in Slot’s first season.\nMatt Ladson is the co-founder and editor of This Is Anfield, the independent Liverpool news and comment website, and covers all areas of the Reds for FourFourTwo – including transfer analysis, interviews, title wins and European trophies.
