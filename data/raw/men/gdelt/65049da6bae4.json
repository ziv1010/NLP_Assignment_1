A little brother. He was a big part of the success I had in Paris.\n\"He has been a role model for me since that day, not only as a player but as a manager as well. He had a big say on that and I will always be grateful for what he has done for me.\"\nPochettino returned to the Premier League in the summer after a near four-year absence. The 51-year-old previously managed Arsenal's bitter north London rivals, Tottenham, and propelled them into Premier League title contention on a regular basis in addition to reaching the 2019 Champions League final.\nHis time at the club came to an unsavoury end, owing to a disappointing start to the 2019/20 season, and he was out of football for 14 months before taking over at Paris Saint-Germain in January 2021.\nHe delivered PSG's customary Ligue 1 title success but wasn't able to lead the club to Champions League glory - the measuring stick of success at the club after huge financial investments in the likes of Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar.\nPochettino was out of work again for almost a year before agreeing to take over at Chelsea in May. He is committed to the Blues for at least two seasons, with the option of a third, and has started to turn things around results wise after a disappointing start to 2023/24.",
