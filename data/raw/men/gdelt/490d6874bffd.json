It’s exciting because Liverpool are going to win the league and they still need to improve in some areas.’\nMore Trending\nDiscussing Newcastle’s fantastic achievement, Carragher added: ‘No matter what happens next with Newcastle, they will always be remembered for this.\n‘Eddie Howe has massively improved as a coach since coming to Newcastle.\n‘I’m gutted Liverpool didn’t win today but if there is any team you would accept losing to, it’s Newcastle.
