From the battle-hardened internationals to players eager to write their fresh stories at the international level, the team assembled by coach Eric Sekou Chelle for the continental showpiece carries both the weight of history and the hunger to end a 12-year wait for AFCON glory, MORAKINYO ABODUNRIN and DANIEL OYEKAN profile the country’s hope bearers in Morocco…\nSTANLEY NWABALI: From late bloomer to numero uno\nStanley Nwabali’s rise to prominence remains one of the most compelling stories in recent Super Eagles history. Born on June 10, 1996, the Chippa United goalkeeper arrived on the international scene relatively late, having plied his trade extensively within Nigeria’s domestic league with Lobi Stars, Go Round FC and Katsina United before moving to South Africa.\nNwabali made his Super Eagles debut on July 3, 2021, in a 4–0 friendly defeat to Mexico in the United States a game few would have predicted would be the foundation of a remarkable international career. His defining moment, however, came at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Côte d’Ivoire.\nTrusted as Nigeria’s first-choice goalkeeper, Nwabali delivered a string of assured performances throughout the tournament, most memorably producing decisive saves during the semi-final penalty shootout victory over South Africa. His composure, shot-stopping ability and command of the penalty area played a crucial role as Nigeria marched to the final, eventually settling for silver.\nFRANCIS UZOHO: Experienced with a point to prove\nFrancis Uzoho remains one of the most experienced goalkeepers in the Super Eagles squad, despite a career that has fluctuated between promise and criticism. Born on October 28, 1998, the Omonia FC of Cyprus goalkeeper shot into global attention in November 2017 when he produced a man-of-the-match performance against Lionel Messi-led Argentina in a friendly.\nRead Also: Bafana Bafana beat Angola 2-1 as Foster claims match-winning goal\nUzoho was Nigeria’s first-choice goalkeeper at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia and the 2019 AFCON in Egypt, where the Super Eagles secured a bronze medal under Gernot Rohr. However, his form dipped in subsequent years, culminating in the loss of his starting role to Maduka Okoye at the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon, where Nigeria exited in the round of 16.\nAt the 2023 AFCON in Côte d’Ivoire, Uzoho played second fiddle to Nwabali but remained an important figure within the squad. A winner of the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup with the Golden Eaglets, Uzoho has amassed 36 caps for Nigeria and will be heading to his fourth AFCON tournament in Morocco.\nAMAS OBASOGIE: The newcomer with everything to gain\nAmas Obasogie represents the future and depth of Nigeria’s goalkeeping department. Born on December 14, 1999, in Benin City, the 25-year-old currently plies his trade with Singida Black Stars in Tanzania.\nObasogie began his professional career with Bendel Insurance, where he featured prominently between 2022 and 2024 before a brief stint with Ethiopian side Fasil Kenema. His move to Singida Black Stars in February 2025 marked another step forward in his steadily developing career.\nAlthough yet to make his Super Eagles debut or appear at an AFCON tournament, Obasogie’s inclusion signals a deliberate effort to build continuity and competition within the squad. For the young goalkeeper, Morocco 2025 presents a valuable learning platform and an opportunity to stake a future claim for the national team’s number one jersey.\nCHIDOZIE AWAZIEM: Versatility and tournament pedigree\nBorn on January 1, 1997, Chidozie Awaziem remains one of Nigeria’s most dependable defensive options. Comfortable as a centre-back or right-back, Awaziem’s career has taken him across Europe and North America, featuring for FC Porto B, Nantes, CD Leganés, Alanyaspor, Boavista, FC Cincinnati, Colorado Rapids and Hajduk Split before returning to Nantes on a three-year deal in the summer of 2025.\nAwaziem made his Super Eagles debut in 2017 and was part of Nigeria’s squad at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. He has featured at three AFCON tournaments — Egypt 2019, Cameroon 2021 and Côte d’Ivoire 2023 winning bronze and silver medals respectively.\nBRIGHT OSAYI-SAMUEL: Energy width and modern full-back play\nBright Osayi-Samuel brings dynamism and attacking thrust from the right flank. Born on December 31, 1997, in Okija, Anambra State, but raised in England, Osayi-Samuel developed through Blackpool and Queens Park Rangers before enjoying a successful spell at Fenerbahce, where he became a fan favourite. Now with Birmingham City following a move in 2024, Osayi-Samuel combines defensive discipline with explosive pace and direct attacking play. Despite representing England at youth level, he committed to Nigeria and made his Super Eagles debut under José Peseiro.

Born on November 9, 1993, in London, the Hull City centre-back offers leadership, strength and aerial dominance.\nAjayi made his Super Eagles debut in 2018.Notably, he played every minute of Nigeria’s seven matches at AFCON 2023, forming the backbone of a defence that conceded few goals en route to the final.

Born on December 31, 1999, in Italy to Nigerian parents, Bassey rose through the ranks at Rangers before a high-profile move to Ajax and later Fulham.\nEqually effective at left-back or centre-back, Bassey combines athleticism with ball-playing confidence. Since making his debut in 2022, he has become a defensive mainstay, playing a pivotal role in Nigeria’s silver-medal finish at AFCON 2023. His first international goal a crucial strike against South Africa in a 2026 World Cup qualifier further underlined his growing influence.\nZAIDU SANUSI: attacking tour de force from the left\nZaidu Sanusi’s attacking instincts from left-back add a valuable dimension to Nigeria’s play.

Born on December 17, 2001, in London to Nigerian parents, the Blackburn Rovers right-back developed at Arsenal and gained valuable experience through loan spells across England and Scotland.\nNow thriving at Blackburn, where he has won multiple Player of the Month awards, Alebiosu offers pace, versatility and tactical intelligence. His ability to operate in both defence and midfield positions gives Chelle valuable flexibility heading into AFCON 2025.\nWILFRED NDIDI: Captain and ‘generalissimo’\nWilfred Ndidi remains the heartbeat of Nigeria’s midfield when fit. Born on December 16, 1996, in Lagos, Ndidi has built a reputation as one of Europe’s elite ball-winning midfielders. After rising to prominence at Genk, he spent seven influential seasons at Leicester City before joining Turkish giants Beşiktaş in 2024, where he was swiftly appointed vice-captain. With over 70 international caps, Ndidi brings vast experience, having featured at the 2018 FIFA World Cup and two AFCON tournaments in Egypt 2019 and Cameroon 2021. Although injury ruled him out of Nigeria’s silver-medal run at AFCON 2023, his return restores authority, positional discipline and leadership to the Super Eagles’ midfield. The newly crowned Super Eagles’ captain presence allows Nigeria to defend compactly while transitioning quickly into attack.\nRAPHAEL ONYEDIKA: Youthful with dynamic energy\nRaphael Onyedika has steadily evolved into a reliable midfield enforcer for Nigeria.

His tireless running and ball-carrying ability provide Nigeria with verticality, particularly against high-pressing opponents.\nFISAYO DELE-BASHIRU: Creative attacking option\nOne of Nigeria’s most exciting midfield additions is Fisayo Dele-Bashiru. Born on February 4, 2001, and currently with Lazio in the Italian Serie A, Dele-Bashiru offers creativity, dribbling and deep runs into the box.\nDespite limited international experience, he has already announced himself with goals, including a strike on debut against South Africa in a 2026 World Cup qualifier.
