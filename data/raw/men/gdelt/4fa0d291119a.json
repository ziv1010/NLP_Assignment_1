  "body_text": "Lia Walti reflected on our incredible comeback in the UEFA Women’s Champions League to draw 2-2 away at Wolfsburg.\nAfter going two goals behind within the opening half an hour, our squad rallied to turn the fixture around and set us up well for the deciding leg on May 1 at Emirates Stadium.\n“We came here to get as good a result as possible,” said Walti. “After being 2-0 down, it was such an incredible shift from the team to come back from that. We did it today for all the girls who have to sit at home and watch us, who got injured in the last months.\n“At the minute, we just have a great team spirit and that's why we got the result today.”\nRafaelle headed home in the 45th minute to shift the momentum in our direction just before the half-time whistle.\n“It was the perfect time for that one goal. Mentally, that can have a big impact at half time. We just got the last few details we needed from the coaching team but you could feel the fire in us, you could feel that we want to get more.\n\"We could get more, we believed in it and that's what we showed in the second half.”\nIt was yet another impressive comeback for our Gunners, as our mentality prevailed in the second half to secure the draw away from home.\n“I just think everybody who's on the pitch is working so hard. From Stina as a striker to the last player on the pitch, it's just an incredible shift week in and week out. We do it for the girls who can't play but also for the fans who travelled here again to support us so well.\n\"I think we’re just mentally very strong at the moment and it makes us really hard to beat.\"\nAfter a devastating ACL injury to Leah Williamson in midweek, Walti discussed the loss of players like Kim Little, Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema across the season and the impact they still have from the sidelines.\n\"They're huge players for us - everybody knows that. Unfortunately, that's part of football. We've been very unlucky this season with big injuries but the girls are supporting us from home and we support them every step of the way throughout the injuries.\n\"I think moments like this can bring the team even closer together. I think that's how we got the draw today.\"\nWe're now only one match away from a Champions League final but first, our focus turns to recovery.\n\"First of all, I think we all need to recover a little bit from that one. It was a huge fight. We need to be prepared tactically for the next match.\n\"At home, in front of our fans, it's going to be a completely different game but we also know we have to step up our game because Wolfsburg definitely also want to reach the final. It's gonna be a very exciting game next week.\"\nHear more from Lia Walti by clicking play on the video above.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
