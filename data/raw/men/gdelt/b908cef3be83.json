Perhaps most impressively, none of Langstaff's goals were penalty kicks.\nToday's National League results\nOther than the Aldershot-Altrincham game that was delayed, the National League season is over.\nHere are today's results:\n- Torquay 1-1 Wrexham\n- Gateshead 4-0 Maidenhead\n- Barnet 0-2 Dagenham & Redbridge\n- Boreham Wood 1-0 Yeovil\n- Chesterfield 4-0 Maidstone\n- Dorking 2-1 Scunthorpe\n- Halifax 1-1 Eastleigh\n- Notts County 1-1 York City\n- Oldham 1-1 Bromley\n- Solihull Moors 0-1 Woking\n- Southend 2-1 Wealdstone\n- Aldershot 0-0 Altrincham (61')\nA record-extending draw for Wrexham\nThey weren't able to add three points to their National League tally today, but a draw means Wrexham have still made their British points record slightly harder to beat for teams in the future.\nSpare a thought for Notts County, whose 107 points does not even guarantee them a promotion place - they will now go into the play-offs.\nHeartbreak for Torquay\nGoing into the final day needing a miracle against the champions gave Torquay the highest possible mountain to climb.\nOn the balance of play, they can probably count themselves unlucky to only have earned a draw.\nBut, with Gateshead beating Maidenhead 4-0, they would have needed to win by three goals, which was beyond them.\nFT: Torquay 1-1 Wrexham\nIt's all over! Wrexham's time in the National League has come to a close after 15 years.\nTorquay United are relegated, allowing Maidenhead United to remain in the division.\nWrexham goal disallowed\n90+3' Torquay 1-1 Wrexham\nWrexham look to have scored a goal that would truly confirm Torquay's relegation, but the flag goes up for offside, sparing them for at least another minute.\nINJURY TIME\n90+2' Torquay 1-1 Wrexham\nWe're nearly halfway through four minutes of injury time here. Torquay need a goal and a miracle.\nTorquay knocking on the door again\n90+1' Torquay 1-1 Wrexham\nThis has been a spirited performance from Torquay and, on today's evidence, it's hard to see how they're anywhere near the relegation zone — they have caused the champions some real problems.\nAnother goal for Gateshead provides a new glimmer of hope but it just looks like a bridge too far for Torquay.\nThey left themselves with far too much to do on the final day.\nAs things stand, Torquay need a miracle\n90' Torquay 1-1 Wrexham\nTorquay need some injury time magic to avoid relegation.\nGateshead have increased their lead over Maidenhead to 4-0, meaning Torquay need three goals to survive: at least one Torquay goal and two more by either Torquay or Gateshead.\nChance for Torquay\n89' Torquay 1-1 Wrexham\nJarvis nearly has a golden chance right in front of goal, but he can't reach the ball in time before Foster collects it.\nSub for Torquay\n87' Torquay 1-1 Wrexham\nMcGavin comes on for Lapslie.\nThat could be the goal that sends Torquay down\n83' Torquay 1-1 Wrexham\nThat goal has got the Wrexham supporters bouncing again, and it has knocked the stuffing out of the Torquay fans.\nThe slip from Lawrence gave the champions a 2v1 in the penalty area and Lee was never going to miss with an open goal at his mercy.\nTorquay's task has just gone from very difficult to nearly impossible.\nGOAL! Wrexham equalise!\n80' Torquay 1-1 Wrexham\nLee scores to level the match and Torquay's dream of surviving relegation may have just ended!\nA slip from Lawrence allowed Palmer to break free down the right wing before he found Lee all alone in the box.",
