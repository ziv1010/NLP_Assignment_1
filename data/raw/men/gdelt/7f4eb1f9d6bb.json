He makes goal scoring look easy, when it really isn’t.\nHe had one shot that was so good it hit the crossbar twice!\nWilson is a key player and Eddie Howe knows how to use him / rotate him to keep from burning out.\nA worthy wearer of the number nine jersey.\nGo easy on Gordon\nI felt Gordon was harshly criticised after this game.\nHe had a good opening 45 minutes and was really unlucky not to score.\nOur January buy had his best moment when he was put clean through by Isak and has placed his shot on to the post when it was easier to find the back of the net.\nSuch a shame.\nI am determined his display ought to go down as a positive. He had chances and we know there is more to come from a player who is just 22.\nHe needs support, not criticism, and he needs to get a chance down the right hand side of the front three.\nTaking charge\nThe domination we were able to show in that second half was a huge plus (after the break – 17 shots in total, five on target from 67% possession).\nThe players really went for it, despite that being their third game in seven days.\nThere must have been some tired minds and bodies but they weren’t to be denied.\nWe laid siege to the Gallowgate goal and Southampton were forced deeper and deeper until eventually, and thankfully, they cracked.\nThe win leaves us third in the Premier League at the start of May.\nTwo more wins from the final five games could be enough to ensure Champions League football in the 23/24 season.\nSpecial mention for Sven Botman, who did really well with that header from the corner which led to Walcott putting the ball into his own net.\nNEGATIVES (Very few, so bullet points again here!)\nLeft wing tendencies:\nIs it clear that Gordon isn’t best down the left side of midfield?\nSurely a square peg in a round hole?\nNeeds a chance in his correct position.\nSean a big miss:\nThe importance of Sean Longstaff to this team is huge and he was missed. Let’s hope he is back soon.\nThe signs are that he might be ok, after that heavy tackle at Goodison led to fears he had broken his foot.\nOfficialdom:\nOnce again the VAR was a talking point.\nWilson was level surely?\nMeanwhile, the game at Anfield saw a lack of decisions, Jota not getting a red card and then he scored the winner.\nStats from BBC Sport:\nNewcastle 3 Southampton 1 – Sunday 30 April 2pm\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nWilson 54, 81, Walcott OG 79,\nSouthampton:\nArmstrong 41\n(In brackets the half-time stats)\nPossession was Southampton 35% (37%) Newcastle 65% (63%)\nTotal shots were Southampton 4 (4) Newcastle 22 (5)\nShots on target were Southampton 3 (3) Newcastle 5 (0)\nCorners were Southampton 2 (1) Newcastle 11 (3)\nReferee: Anthony Taylor\nNewcastle United:\nPope, Trippier, Schar, Botman, Burn, Bruno, Joelinton, Gordon (Wilson 45), Murphy (Almiron 69), Willock (Anderson 90+2), Isak (Ritchie 90+2)\nUnused Subs:\nDubravka, Dummett, Lewis, Targett, Manquillo\n(Match Report – Our man at St James’ Park – I don’t think I want this season to end… Read HERE)\n(Alan Shearer : What he said about Newcastle United 54 days ago and what he’s saying now – Astonishing turn around – Read HERE)\n(Newcastle 3 Southampton 1 – The instant NUFC fan / writer reaction – Read HERE)\n(Bruno Guimaraes gets emotional after final whistle – Newcastle United make it 8 wins from 9 – Go HERE)\n(Newcastle 3 Southampton 1 – Superb comeback win takes United to brink of Champions League football – Read HERE)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
