  "body_text": "Mikel Arteta says his style of play as Arsenal manager has evolved as he changes his tactics based on the players he has at his disposal, in stark contrast to Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim.\nThe Spaniard has been in charge of the Gunners since December 2019, with big changes under his leadership.\nIt was a rocky first year as manager for Arteta, with his job under threat by December 2020 after a really poor run of form, but he has restored Arsenal as Premier League title challengers and a Champions League threat.\nThe style of play and tactics have changed since Arteta took charge, with the former Gunners midfielder saying he sees it as the ‘main thing’ for a coach to set up in a way which suits the players available.\n‘Tell me the players that you have and I tell you how we have to play,’ Arteta told Sky Sports. ‘Then what the opposition allows you to do because there’s what you want to do and what the opposition allows you to do as well.\n‘I always believe that you have to put the players in their strengths, in their abilities as often as possible. That’s the main thing, in my opinion, as a coach to maximise the resources that we have.\n‘The first year and the second one. There are certain things, especially without the ball, against man-to-man, the last line we could not do.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nThis approach is at the opposite end of the scale to the manager he will face at Old Trafford on Sunday, Ruben Amorim.\nSince arriving at Manchester Untied from Sporting earlier this season, the Portuguese has been steadfast in the way he sets up his team, despite results and performances being underwhelming, to say the least.\nAmorim is sticking to his 3-4-3 system and seemingly will not be changing it, regardless of what happens on the pitch.\n‘I cannot change my idea in one day because we will lose much more now,’ he said of his tactics. ‘So I will try to do it the way I am trying to do it.\n‘I adapt for every game – the positioning, the way the players are trying to cope without training. So it’s really hard for them. But I maintain my idea, I want to play a certain way until the end.’\nHe added: ‘If I change everything now, we are going to lose everything.\n‘Like I said, you cannot go back. I was here because of my idea and I will continue to do my idea until the end.’\nHe has reiterated that stance, saying he has ‘one idea’ and the system is not why the Red Devils are struggling.\n‘I know what to do,’ he said. ‘But sometimes it is the life of results, and you have to win games. I know the consequences when we don’t win games, but I’m really confident. Since day one, a little bit more frustrated but I am still confident.\n‘It’s quite simple. We talk about the system, the system is not the problem, is the way of playing. You build up with three, two defenders and one midfielder going down. It is quite simple, I don’t see football like that.\nMore Trending\n‘The problem of our team is not the system. We have a lot of problems, we are trying to work on these problems, of course every system needs different characteristics. But I was always really clear. I have one idea.\n‘I am still really confident because I have an idea how to play football. I will not change that, no matter what. And I’m not talking about the system, it’s the way I see football, I will not change that.\n‘We are going to do it. Or not! We’ll see.’\nMORE: Manchester United told they can sign Premier League striker for £40 million\nMORE: Jack Grealish sent warning by Pep Guardiola after Man City star’s night out\nMORE: Sky Sports presenter Emma Saunders reveals she has a brain infection following cancer battle",
