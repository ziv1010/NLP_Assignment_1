But a well-placed Spanish police source said today when asked about the arrest: 'The specialist UDYCO Costa del Sol police group which is leading the investigation has identified this man.\n'As they couldn’t find him in the places where they thought he could have been in Malaga, they asked a court in Fuengirola which has opened a judicial probe into the shootings to issue an international arrest warrant for this man.\n'Police in the UK have arrested the man in Liverpool under this international warrant.'\nNo details have yet emerged about the suspect’s age or nationality. He is now facing extradition to Spain so he can be questioned about the May 31 murders.\nAny extradition would have to be approved by a UK court. The suspect’s return to Spain would be delayed if he decides to oppose extradition.\nSpanish officials said days after the murders they had 'no doubt' they would catch the gunman who shot dead Monaghan and Lyons Jnr.\nScots mobsters Ross Monaghan (right) and Eddie Lyons Jnr (left) were gunned down in Spain\nThe horror shooting took place last month at Monaghan’s Irish pub, in Fuengirola, Spain\nThe murders sent shockwaves through the holiday hotspot of Fuengirola\nJavier Salas was the first Spanish government representative to confirm the victims were Scottish after the horror shooting at Monaghan’s Irish pub, in Fuengirola.\nAnd he spoke again three days later to say he was convinced police would find and arrest the culprit.\nGraphic CCTV footage first published by Spanish TV showed one of the two men murdered being cornered inside the premises and shot in the chest and stomach from close range.\nThe killer, dressed in black, was filmed shooting Glaswegian Ross Monaghan, 43, dead after targeting his pal Lyons Jnr outside the pub seconds earlier as terrified tourists and locals ran for cover.\nSpanish police sources confirmed they believed the killer was blond following claims detectives haven’t commented on that he could also be Scottish.\nHe fled on foot but was driven from the scene by an accomplice in a car waiting nearby which headed along the old N340 dual carriageway east towards the resort of Benalmadena.\nOfficers from the elite Spanish National Police Costa del Sol-based Anti-Drug and Organised Crime Unit UDYCO have headed the ongoing probe, although they are reporting to a Fuengirola-based investigating judge coordinating the operation.\nCareer criminal Monaghan, who fled Scotland for Spain after a failed attempt on his life outside a Glasgow primary school in 2017, was tried but acquitted over the murder of notorious Glasgow hood Kevin ‘Gerbil’ Carroll at an Asda car park in 2010.\nEddie Lyons Jnr was gunned down as he watched the Champions League football final\nCCTV footage from inside the pub captured the moment the killer gunned the men down\nRoss Monaghan was known for his involvement in the criminal underworld\nIn August 2017 he and Eddie Lyons Jr, both members of the Lyons Glasgow crime family, were cleared of being involved in a brutal street attack on three men outside the Campsie bar in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire.\nThe shooting in Spain came amid a violent gang war that has ripped through Scotland since March said to have started over a fallout over drugs.\nThe gun murders followed the fatal shooting nearly seven weeks ago of a 32-year-old British man in nearby Calahonda a 15-minute drive from the Irish bar towards Marbella.\nHe was shot dead around 8pm on April 21 in a professional hit as he headed back to his car after finishing a football match with friends.\nThe killers fled in a getaway car that was later torched. Police are investigating the brutal assassination as a drug-related gang shooting but have yet to make any arrests.\nThe victim has not been named but was known to come from Liverpool.\nReports at the time described the incident as the fourth shooting so far that month on the Costa del Sol, where rival gangs have increasingly used extreme violence to settle scores and a number of international mafias are known to have a base.\nFour days before the Calahonda shooting a 34-year-old man was rushed to the Costa del Sol Hospital in Marbella after being shot outside a nightclub in the famous Costa del Sol resort.\nHe fled on foot but was driven from the scene by an accomplice in a car waiting nearby which headed along the old N340 dual carriageway east towards the resort of Benalmadena.\nOfficers from the elite Spanish National Police Costa del Sol-based Anti-Drug and Organised Crime Unit UDYCO have headed the ongoing probe, although they are reporting to a Fuengirola-based investigating judge coordinating the operation.\nCareer criminal Monaghan, who fled Scotland for Spain after a failed attempt on his life outside a Glasgow primary school in 2017, was tried but acquitted over the murder of notorious Glasgow hood Kevin ‘Gerbil’ Carroll at an Asda car park in 2010.\nIn August 2017 he and Eddie Lyons Jr, both members of the Lyons Glasgow crime family, were cleared of being involved in a brutal street attack on three men outside the Campsie bar in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire.\nThe shooting in Spain came amid a violent gang war that has ripped through Scotland since March said to have started over a fallout over drugs.\nThe gun murders followed the fatal shooting nearly seven weeks ago of a 32-year-old British man in nearby Calahonda a 15-minute drive from the Irish bar towards Marbella.\nHe was shot dead around 8pm on April 21 in a professional hit as he headed back to his car after finishing a football match with friends.\nThe killers fled in a getaway car that was later torched.
