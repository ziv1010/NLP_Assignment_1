  "body_text": "Manchester United are rumoured to be interested in signing Canadian defender Jayde Riviere.\nAccording to soccerdonna information, Jayde Riviere 🇨🇦 is on Manchester United's list. Other clubs from England, Spain and France are also interested in signing the 21-year-old defender.#jayderiviere #manchesterunited #fawsl pic.twitter.com/6KlnV862cj\n— Soccerdonna (@soccerdonna) January 1, 2023\nThe Reds are, by manager Marc Skinner’s own admission, looking to strengthen their squad but may be held back by the limbo the club finds itself in with a possible takeover deal.\nRiviere is a free agent and has been linked with a move to the WSL with BBC’s Emma Sanders confirming those reports.\nThe 21 year old was a part of the Canadian team who won the Gold medal at the postponed 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\nManchester United are in need of support at the back. In recent years they have struggled with injury in the second half of the season.\nLast season Millie Turner and Aoife Mannion found themselves sidelined for a lengthy period, leaving the Reds short in defence.\nUnited signed veteran Diane Caldwell to reinforce the team but they were still short at times and had to call upon the likes of Hayley Ladd and Katie Zelem for defensive duties pulling them out of their usual midfield positions.\nAs such it weakened the whole squad at a crucial point in their season.\nIn summer United made a key signing in Maya Le Tissier but with talk of Batlle heading back to Spain, United’s priority will be in suring up the backline.\nRiviere just a few months ago was playing college football in the States but this has proven successful for United before after the Reds signed Russo straight after graduating.\nHowever, Riviere is coming back from injury and may need some time adjusting.\nThe Reds have also been linked with 19 year old Hanna Wijk from BK Hacken who already has Champions League experience, according to journalist Jamie Spencer of 90 Min.\nUnited Matchday Magazine – be in the know about everything in red!\nStill itching for more United content?
