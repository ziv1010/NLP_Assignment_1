There is also a four-part podcast series, brought to you by George Caulkin, The Athletic and Sir Bobby Robson’s family. To listen, just search for ‘Pod on the Tyne’ on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, The Athletic app or wherever you get your podcasts, or follow this link.\nAdvertisement\nIt is 20 years since Newcastle United played in the Champions League and Alan Shearer simply isn’t having it. “No way!” the club’s former striker, captain and record goalscorer says. “That’s unbelievable. Mad. Bonkers.” To bastardise the old saying, where does the time go when you aren’t particularly having fun, but as St James’ Park stirs, looking back is less painful. The club it once was, it will be again.\nEddie Howe’s team are fourth in the Premier League, way ahead of schedule following last season’s takeover and Europe’s elite competition is no longer the stuff of pipe-dream and bittersweet memory. There are parallels between now and then, with Sir Bobby Robson inheriting a side at the foot of the division and urging a riven club together. The difference? This time, Newcastle’s improvement should stick.\n“We were in the bottom three when Sir Bobby took over and to get from there to the Champions League was an extraordinary recovery and an extraordinary rise,” Shearer says. “And then, of course, it’s so good and so special you don’t ever want to leave. You take it for granted a bit. It kind of becomes normal. You tell yourself you’ll be back next year and the year after.”\nAs Newcastle discovered, the years run out.\n“There were some really special nights and Newcastle can start looking forward to more of them,” Shearer says. “It’s been way too long. I hope for everybody’s sake we can do it. It’ll be tough this season, but what an achievement it is to go from fighting relegation 12 months ago to being in the hunt for Champions League football. Getting there would be monumental.”\nMonumental is a fitting description of Newcastle’s European campaign in 2002-03 and not just because there were weighty fixtures against huge clubs; Juventus, Barcelona, Inter Milan. Until Atalanta matched them in 2019, they were the only side to lose their opening three group matches and progress (there were two group stages back then). There were titanic matches, goals, bans, butts, elbows, a sea of Geordies and rich emotion.\nThe Athletic spoke to the people who were part of it.\nAdvertisement\nThree years into his Newcastle reign, this was very much Sir Bobby’s squad. They had finished fourth in the Premier League the previous season.\nA European adventure now awaited. After overcoming Bosnian side Zeljeznicar in a play-off, winning 5-0 on aggregate, Newcastle’s reward was a place in Group E, featuring Juventus, Dutch side Feyenoord and Ukrainian champions Dynamo Kyiv.\nShearer (striker): “I’d played in the Champions League for Blackburn Rovers after we won the title and it wasn’t a pleasant experience. We didn’t exactly get the most glamorous of draws and pretty much everything went wrong.\n“The low point was the fight between Graeme Le Saux and David Batty away to Spartak Moscow. It was minus-10C and the whole frustration of everyone and everything exploded in that instant. We got battered 3-0. Getting back there with Newcastle felt like a big moment. We worked our nuts off for it.”\nKieron Dyer (midfielder): “We had an owner in Freddy Shepherd who the fans had a real love-hate relationship with, but he and Sir John Hall tried to win things. He showed ambition.”\nAndy Griffin (defender): “The team was basically an extension of who Bobby was; that zest for life, that energy, that enthusiasm, that desire to win, having a sense of no fear. That’s kind of who we were.\n“‘You’ve got nothing to fear’, he’d tell us. ‘Go out, give it your best go, leave nothing in the changing room and let’s see what it brings us’.”\nLaurent Robert (winger): “That whole team was set up to attack and I loved that style. I always knew if I crossed the ball in, Shearer would score.\n“When I came to Newcastle, Sir Bobby protected me and gave me confidence every day. After games, he would drop me off at home, then he would pick me up and we would speak a lot.”\nShola Amoebi (striker): “We’d get to Champions League away games the day before and Sir Bobby always made us go on little walks together as a squad. He wanted us to take in the culture. He forced us to be a part of it. It was almost like it elevated him. It gave him a new lease of life when he went on those trips. He was like an ambassador.”\nDespite the squad’s excitement, Newcastle’s campaign began badly. Dynamo Kyiv beat them 2-0 in Ukraine, with Craig Bellamy later suspended for a headbutt on defender Tiberio Ghioane. There was then a surprise 1-0 defeat to Feyenoord at St James’ Park.\nAdvertisement\nCraig Bellamy (striker, writing in his autobiography GoodFella): “I was given a three-game ban for violent conduct, which was heartbreaking. I had worked so hard to play in the Champions League and now I was going to miss out on the two games against Juventus and the return against Kyiv.”\nNolberto Solano (winger): “We were probably going into the games without specific plans. We were just told to go and prove what we can do. I know we had a very good team but sometimes in these competitions, we needed to be a little more clever, a little different tactically. It is different to play Dynamo Kyiv than it is to play Juventus or Feyenoord.”\nRobson (manager, writing in his autobiography Farewell but not Goodbye): “A manager leading his men to Juventus, Barcelona or Bayern Munich will not waste midnight oil searching for weaknesses in his opponent. He might as well chase a ghost. The path to success at this most exalted level is to build up the squad to the point where you will win six or seven of the 10 outfield duels that make up a football match.”\nNewcastle then travelled to Turin to face Juventus — and despite a promising performance, lost 2-0 after two goals from Alessandro Del Piero.\nDyer: “One thing I’ve always said about the Geordies is, when they travel away, they travel away. You could see all of them with their tops off in freezing conditions and, although it does make you laugh in some ways, it’s also a testament to them because they are fantastic.”\nGriffin: “There were a lot of positives. We hadn’t got played off the pitch and we created chances. It was just a case of trying to put the ball in the back of the net against one of the best goalkeepers ever. We nullified certain threats, certainly Pavel Nedved. I had to man-mark him and I don’t think I’ve ever run so much on a football pitch in my life!”\nDyer: “We played well. I was flagged offside when Alan scored a perfectly good goal. I was nowhere near involved in the play. I also broke away and set up Laurent Robert for a chance six yards out and he ended up missing that. Then Del Piero scores twice and we’re going, ‘Bloody hell’.”\nShearer: “I got Del Piero’s shirt afterwards, but that was all we got.”\nBellamy: “Our Champions League campaign was turning into an embarrassment.”\nTheir record after three games? Played three, lost three, scored zero, conceded five.\nAdvertisement\nDyer: “After three games, our mindset was a case of, ‘Can we get into the UEFA Cup (what is now the Europa League)? Could we stay in Europe longer?’.”\nShearer: “We were desperately disappointed. It had taken a huge amount of effort from everybody to get into the competition and to lose our opening three matches was incredibly frustrating. It felt like it was over before we’d even started. There was a lot of anger around.”\nNewcastle’s position looked hopeless — no team had ever qualified after three opening defeats. Next up was a rematch against Juventus, three weeks on from their defeat in Italy.\nSteve Harper (goalkeeper): “We’d lost badly at Blackburn the weekend before, and Bobby said, ‘You’re playing, son’.\n“‘Ah, brilliant, Juventus!’, I thought. And we’re sitting in the press conference and I’m next to him, and he’s saying, ‘We’ve got a chance, but if he makes a mistake, we’ll probably be out’, pointing to me.\n“I was thinking, ‘I was playing in the reserves last week!’. But he was just heightening the seriousness of it to make me focus.”\nHarper played well as Newcastle kept a clean sheet, but the home side could not beat Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. At least, not until an unlikely hero popped up…\nGriffin: “Laurent has a free kick just outside the box on the right-hand side and, with his left foot, it’s got, ‘Robert, 1-0’, written all over it. And he decides to pass me the ball on the edge of the box.\n“I’ve managed to round one player and then, with my second touch, I’ve kind of taken it a little too far. I remember thinking, ‘If I just smash it at the goal, who knows what’s going to happen, just put it in the danger area’. Dare I say it, Buffon has made a bit of a mistake and the ball’s gone in the back of the net.”\nDan Burn (fan and now Newcastle player): “I was watching in the East Stand with my dad. The ball gets rolled to Griffin, he’s smashed it and it’s bobbled in through Buffon and we were all celebrating. We’ve sat down and this guy in front of us is still celebrating, just won’t stop, going properly mental, completely on his own. And then he shouts, ‘I HAD A FIVER ON HIM!’, and everyone was laughing and buzzing, absolutely buzzing.”\nNewcastle held on to win 1-0, and now it was Dynamo Kyiv at St James’ in their penultimate group match.\nAdvertisement\nShearer: “We went a goal behind, Gary Speed equalised and then I was pulled back and we got a penalty. We knew we had to win. I knew I had to score. Those moments before running up for a penalty always stay with me. It’s just you and the keeper, but it’s also you inside your own head.”\nAfter a 2-1 victory, Newcastle now had a lifeline. If they beat Feyenoord and Kyiv failed to win against Juventus, Sir Bobby’s side would be through. Crucially, Shearer’s strike partner Bellamy was back from his three-game ban.\nDyer: “Shearer really needed Craig at that stage of his career because he did the running in behind. They were a deadly duo.\n“Craig had unbelievable pace, as the whole team did with myself, Jermaine Jenas, Lomana LuaLua, Robert. Our team was blessed with it.”\nNewcastle were without Robert, while Solano, the other regular winger, was left out by Robson. Jenas and new signing Hugo Viana started in their place.\nSolano: “It felt like a side with defensive structure in midfield, with Sir Bobby trying to hang in the game. Every player wants to play and especially in this competition, in such a huge game. So I was gutted.”\nNewcastle took a 2-0 lead. Bellamy scored the opener just before half-time, while Sir Bobby’s selection was vindicated as Viana scored the second.\nDyer: “I assisted the second right in front of the fans, so instead of going across to Hugo, I just stop where I am, lift my hands up to the crowd and take the adulation of us being 2-0 up. It was a brilliant feeling.\n“So we’re 2-0 up and you’re basically thinking, ‘The job is done’. But, typical Newcastle, we found a way of shooting ourselves in the foot.”\nFeyenoord roared back, scoring two goals in six minutes. As things stood, Newcastle were out — and were not even assured of UEFA Cup qualification.\nDyer: “I blame myself for the second goal. One of our defenders tries to clear it, one of their team goes to head the ball, it comes to me and I try a little volley pass in midfield. It gets cut out and two passes later, they score. It’s 2-2.\n“We are really up against it now and all I’m thinking is: ‘You fucking dickhead’.”\nThe 90th minute ticks by with Newcastle desperately seeking a winner. Controlling a lob on his chest, Dyer chop-turned the last defender, leaving him with just the keeper to beat…\nDyer: “Obviously I go and bloody miss the one-on-one when I could have been the real bloody hero!\nAdvertisement\n“Bobby went mad. The first thing he says to me after the game is, ‘LACES!’. He’d been on to me for about a month before telling me, ‘Any time you get a chance, keep your head down and just lash the ball as hard you can’.”\nThe ball looked destined to trickle out for a corner, but Bellamy stretched everything to reach it. He reached it centimetres before the byline — and cannoned in a shot off the goalkeeper’s chest.\nBellamy: “It was almost on the byline by the time I got to it. I just thought ‘Hit the target’.”\nDyer: “Craig’s my best friend in football so I had to give him the limelight. He suffered from a lot of injuries so I had to give him a boost!”\nRobson: “That gave us a 3-2 lead with seconds to go and from the touchline I pointed to my temple to encourage the players to be calm, to concentrate.\n“So often teams get lost in the euphoria of an important goal, only to concede one immediately at the other end. This was too good to waste.”\nDyer: “It’s a testament to the team spirit and the gaffer, the way he got the best out of everyone, that we scored three goals without Nobby and Laurent.”\nGriffin: “At the end, I remember Gary Speed in particular, dancing and singing, ‘We are Champions League, we are Champions League!’.”\nShearer: “It was just an incredible game and an incredible night.”\nOlivier Bernard (defender): “When we came home, everybody was out. There was champagne all over, it was just unbelievable because for most of us, it was our first Champions League runout and it was just a dream.\n“We came back to Newcastle and had a ‘small’ party in the centre of Newcastle.\n“The youngsters, half of the squad, went out together, and we did the same run along the Quayside. Pitcher & Piano, Sea, Uno’s to go and eat, Chase…”\nIncredibly – drunkenly – Newcastle were through, second in the group behind Juventus. In that year’s Champions League, it earned them entry to a second group stage, which would then determine the quarter-finalists.\nAdvertisement\nBellamy: “We were drawn with Inter Milan, Barcelona and Bayer Leverkusen, and that sent the excitement soaring even higher on Tyneside… I was going to be up against Fabio Cannavaro, Javier Zanetti and Hernan Crespo. And I was about to make history. Just not the kind I hoped for.”\nIn the fifth minute against Inter at St James’, Bellamy was sent off for violent conduct for the second time in that campaign, prompting another three-game ban. That and a 4-1 loss were bad enough, but Shearer was also retrospectively suspended for two games, meaning Newcastle were now without their leading strikers.\nDyer: “Marco Materazzi trapped Craig with a classic piece of gamesmanship. Materazzi pinched him, Craig reacted by swinging his arm and Materazzi went down like he had been shot.”\nRobson: “We had talked to Craig quite specifically about the dangers of playing in Europe, where you can’t get away with retaliation or unruliness. We told him, ‘These guys will attempt to upset your apple cart, and if you respond that’s exactly what they want you to do, and you’ll be sent off’. We were wasting our breath.”\nShearer: “They were very streetwise. It was a combination of that and us being a bit wet behind the ears. A lot of our players were new to European football and they took advantage. I was done for an elbow on Cannavaro, although he’d been holding me, which was taken into account when they dished out the punishment. He mentioned it to me a few years later when we were both doing media work. We had a laugh about it. He was laughing more than me.”\nThe next game was at the Camp Nou — Sir Bobby’s return to Barcelona, where he had taken charge in the 1996-97 season.\nHarper: “The night we went over to Barcelona he was obviously in his element. The peacock feathers were out. He loved it. He’d earned the adulation with his time over there. There was a monsoon and the game was put back 24 hours. I’m sure he was over the moon about it, because it meant another day there.”\nAdvertisement\nAmoebi: “That game was when I really realised that Bobby was actually a big deal — like a really big deal. Seeing the adulation the people had for him. He did well there, obviously, but it was more the human side to him.”\nThe game was eventually played 24 hours later, but Newcastle struggled against Barcelona’s midfield maestros and fell to a 3-1 defeat.\nDyer (writing in his 2018 autobiography): “Gary Speed and I were up against Thiago Motta, Xavi and Juan Roman Riquelme. We were chasing shadows most of the game.\n“A corner came over from the right and Motta rose highest and glanced it towards goal as Shay Given came out to try to punch it away. I was guarding the back post, but I was so tired by that point that I hadn’t noticed I was standing just behind the goal line.\n“I was so mentally tired, I couldn’t even move my feet. It was embarrassing. The boss had 25 emails the next day to say I should be suspended from the club.”\nOptimism came from the performance of Ameobi, who led the line in Shearer and Bellamy’s absence and scored.\nAmoebi: “That game really helped me and my own development. I remember feeling great and off the back of the game you do media and I did lots of it.\n“And then I got onto the coach and was just knocked straight back down to earth by Sir Bobby. ‘What are we doing waiting around for a 21-year-old?’ he said. He knew what he was doing. He didn’t want me to think I’d made it.”\nGoing into the next games — two matches against Leverkusen — Newcastle again needed wins to progress. Ameobi delivered in the away fixture, scoring twice in a 3-1 victory.\nAmeobi: “It was going to be me playing with Lomana. I said to him before we left, ‘This is our opportunity to show that we belong’. He’s actually older than me, but I felt a real responsibility, that I had to step up here.\nAdvertisement\n“There were probably three or four matches in my career where I felt like I could do anything — whatever I want to do, it’s going to happen. Where you feel unstoppable. That was one of those games.”\nIn the reverse tie, three goals from Shearer saw Newcastle take another 3-1 win.\nSir Bobby Robson would have turned 90 this Saturday.\nTo mark that special occasion we've released Bobby '90, an exclusive podcast series featuring previously unheard interviews with one of football's most iconic figures.\nListen for free wherever you get your podcasts… pic.twitter.com/RPYSpZgtmJ\n— The Athletic | Football (@TheAthleticFC) February 13, 2023\nShearer: “It’s not every day you score a hat-trick in the Champions League. It’s one of my standout memories and I can still see everything about it — the cross Speedo put in for me, Shola putting one on a plate.”\nAnother victory, against Inter, would put Newcastle in an excellent position to qualify before their final game against Barcelona. Could they really pull off the improbable twice?\nShay Given (goalkeeper, writing in his autobiography Any Given Saturday): “If the Camp Nou is unreal, the San Siro is something else. You feel like the second and third tiers of the place are sat on your shoulders, it’s that tight and close. The noise, the smoke, everything about it was spine-tingling, not least the fact it seemed to be like a home match for us — black and white everywhere.”\nShearer: “It’s such an iconic stadium. I remember looking to my right when we came out of the tunnel and just seeing that wall of black and white. There were thousands and thousands of Geordies there. I scored my first goal at the opposite end and then the second was in front of them and the noise was absolutely deafening. It was just that feeling of ‘wow’. What a feeling that was. What a club.”\nGiven: “Al was again almost superhuman in the way he popped up with critical goals. He twice put us in the lead but we got pegged back, and drew 2-2.”\nAdvertisement\nShearer: “It’s vivid for two reasons. Me and a few friends were part of a syndicate that had a horse running at Cheltenham. Our trainer had told us he was the best horse he’d ever had in his yard. I came back into the dressing-room, on a high after scoring twice at the San Siro but also knowing it wasn’t enough and then had a message on my phone saying the poor horse had slipped getting into its box, ruptured its spleen and had to be put down. Ah man, it was so devastating.”\nNewcastle’s only remaining chance was to beat Barcelona at St James’ and hope that Inter failed to beat Leverkusen. Neither result occurred.\nDyer: “Craig came back from suspension and he must have had six one-on-ones and missed them all. It was one of those nights. We lost 2-0 and the Champions League adventure was over.”\nRobson: “Maybe we hadn’t quite matured enough, as a team. Around the club, I often ran into people who thought, ‘We’re Newcastle United, we should be beating everyone’. Out in the middle of the pitch, the scenario is quite different.\n“If inexperience runs up against the kind of class and experience Barcelona bring to the party, the job can hardly be described as a straightforward case of Geordie spirit and tenacity overcoming world-class talent.\n“At this early stage of our development, the elite were simply too good for us.”\nShearer: “The passion and feeling around those nights was absolutely incredible. The whole thing was brilliant. It was a really good season for us, finishing third in the Premier League and earning another Champions League qualifier. Going on to lost against Partizan Belgrade was a massive blow and very destabilising, even if we ended up getting to the semi-final of the UEFA Cup. But you always think you’ll get another chance.”\nThe Champions League had been a wild adventure and felt like the beginning of something special for Newcastle. Instead, it proved to be an ending.
