No, I don't like to talk about players in another club, but you are talking about one of the greatest, one of the best strikers in the world,\" he said.\n\"It's not fair to talk. Fans are not stupid, they are so clever and they know my relationship with him was always amazing.\n\"I saw him when he was young, grow up and achieve all he was achieving and of course we have a great relationship.\n\"At the moment we are thinking in different ways. We are not thinking about that (Kane).\"\nIf a blockbuster move for Kane is off the agenda, Pochettino has to look elsewhere to solve Chelsea's striker crisis.\nThe Blues, who have sold German forward Kai Havertz to Arsenal, mustered just 38 goals in 38 Premier League games as they finished in 12th place.\n\"We have to time to work. I think for sure we are going to add players that can score,\" Pochettino said.\n'I love the risk'\nPochettino was linked with a return to Tottenham before accepting Chelsea's offer.\nThe 51-year-old spent five years at Tottenham, leading the club to their first Champions League final appearance just months before his surprise dismissal.\nAsked if Tottenham had made an approach before appointing Celtic's Ange Postecoglou as their manager, the Argentine said: \"We have a very good relationship with Daniel and with all the Tottenham people.\n\"I don't want to say anything. We need to look forwards. What am I going to say – yes, no or maybe. And what is it going to change? Nothing.\n\"I feel very proud about the past. You never know in football what can happen in the future.\"\nPochettino remains widely admired among his peers, regardless of the rocky end to his spell at Tottenham and subsequent sacking by Paris Saint-Germain last year.\nHe was axed by PSG despite winning the French title, with a disappointing Champions League campaign proving his downfall.\nHe could have picked an easier landing spot than a Chelsea side reeling from their worst season since 1996.\nFaced with a bloated squad, demanding owners who sacked Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter last term, and the potential for fan unrest given his association with Tottenham, Pochettino insists he made the right move.\n\"I love the risk, the expectations. For me it's a challenge,\" he said.\n\"I want to feel the adrenaline again, to be there and fighting for big things. This football club, because of the history, is about winning big trophies. I want to prove myself, that I can deal with that.\"\nWith his reputation on the line, Pochettino means business and his players should take note.\n\"I don't want to make excuses to the players to say first of all we need time to rebuild,\" he said.\n\"No excuses. The competition doesn't wait for anyone.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
