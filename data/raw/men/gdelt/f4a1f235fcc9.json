  "body_text": "Rasmus Hojlund: Manchester United complete £72m signing from Atalanta\n- Published\n- comments\nManchester United have completed the £72m signing of Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta.\nThe 20-year-old, who joined the Serie A side in 2022 and scored 10 goals in 34 appearances last season, moves to Old Trafford on a five-year deal.\n\"It is no secret I have been a fan of this great club since I was a small boy,\" Hojlund said.\n\"I dreamed of walking out at Old Trafford as a Manchester United player.\"\nHe is United manager Erik ten Hag's third summer signing after Mason Mount joined from Chelsea for £55m and Inter Milan goalkeeper Andre Onana arrived for £47.2m.\nTen Hag said of the new addition: \"He is a real frontman. Very direct to the goal, very good presser, a physical presence. I think in the balance of this squad, we needed that, alongside Rashford, another player who is direct and can score a goal. That is all in his mind: he wants to score goals.\n\"I think he has huge potential. And now it's up to him first, to explore that and we will support him, all the coaches, the team. The team was waiting for a type like him. They will integrate him in the dressing room and in the pitch; they will help him.\n\"Finally, the player has to prove it. That is the character we need; we need hungry players and he is a player who is so determined to score goals, winning games and winning trophies.\"\nLigue 1 champions Paris St-Germain were also reportedly interested in Hojlund as a potential replacement for France captain Kylian Mbappe, whose immediate future is unclear.\nHojlund will miss the opening weeks of the 2023-24 season, which United begin against Wolves on Monday, 14 August, after suffering a small injury during pre-season training with Atalanta.\n\"I am incredibly excited by this opportunity to turn a dream into a reality, and I am determined to repay the faith the club has shown in me,\" Hojlund added.\n\"It is still early in my career, but I know I am ready to make this step up and play with this group of world-class players.\n\"Once I had spoken to the manager, I knew this environment would be perfect for my development; I am relishing the opportunity to work with one of the best coaches in the world.\n\"Under his guidance and support I know that I am capable of achieving great things together with my new team-mates at this special club.\"\nHojlund began his senior career at Copenhagen, making his Danish Superliga debut aged 17 in 2020 before switching to Austrian side Sturm Graz less than two years later.\nHe spent only six months in the Austrian Bundesliga after joining Sturm in January 2022 but scored 12 goals in 21 games for the club.\nFind all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.\nThat impressive form led to his move to Atalanta for a reported £15m, some 10 times what Sturm Graz had paid for him.\nHe made his international debut in 2022 and has scored six goals in six games in qualifying for Euro 2024.\n\"Rasmus is a truly exceptional talent; he possesses technical and physical attributes which rank him among the best players in the world for his age group,\" said Manchester United football director John Murtough.\n\"Throughout the summer we have acted quickly and decisively to secure our primary targets. This will ensure Erik and his coaches have the best opportunity to prepare the squad to push for further success.\"\nAnalysis\nBBC Football reporter Simon Stone, Old Trafford\nHojlund received a rapturous reception as he made his way out of the players' tunnel to the centre circle, where he held up a shirt bearing his name - but no number - before Manchester United's friendly with Lens, which ended in a 3-1 victory for the Red Devils.\nHis presence has generated a huge amount of attention, with a Danish TV crew flying in solely to cover the moment.\nThe transfer represents something of a gamble for United, who were heavily linked with a move for Harry Kane.\nIn the recent past, they have gone for experienced forwards in the form of Radamel Falcao, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and, most recently, Cristiano Ronaldo.\nHojlund is at the other end of the age and development stage. It will be fascinating to see whether manager Ten Hag can develop him the same way he brought through so many excellent Ajax players who he guided to the semi-final of the Champions League in 2019.\nOne game a week for the first four weeks of the Premier League season allows time for Hojlund, once fit, to settle in. It promises to be a fascinating period for this self-confessed United fan, whose reputation has grown considerably since he cost Sturm Graz £1.3m 18 months ago.\nOur coverage of Manchester United is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment",
