  "body_text": "Andreas Christensen offers fresh Barcelona return date after Achilles surgery\n- Christensen sidelined by Achilles injury since first week of La Liga season\n- Dane recently underwent surgery after three months on the sidelines\n- Defender reveals when fans can expect his return\nBy Tom Gott\nAndreas Christensen has assured Barcelona fans his recent Achilles surgery should not impact his proposed return date.\nThe Dane suffered an injury during the first week of the current campaign and, after three months on the sidelines, underwent a fresh procedure which sparked fears of a setback and a delay in his plans to return in January.\nFortunately for Christensen, the 28-year-old has confirmed he is still working to the same schedule and even suggested he could return from injury slightly earlier than expected.\n\"It's been a while and that's why I decided to speak out,\" he told Barca One. \"I feel fine, we've passed a turning point.\n\"[The surgery] was so minor that it can be considered more of a clean-up. It shouldn't affect my time on my return and, if it does, it will be to speed it up.\n\"I don't want to put pressure on myself, but I feel that we are going in the right direction and that we have passed a turning point. What I have to do now is work and improve every day to feel comfortable and confident in the different movements. This will be the next step. I hope you can see me soon. I am not enjoying it, but I work hard every day.\n\"Returning at 80% or 90% is not good for me or the team. The idea is that everyone who has been injured can return and help the team. The objective is to play games, but the team is playing well and it will be difficult.\"\nChristensen went on to admit that he feels \"jealous\" of the players who get to enjoy Hansi Flick's impressive brand of football, confessing his excitement towards his eventual return to the Barcelona squad.\n\"[The coaches] came with very clear guidelines on how they wanted to play and how the season would go and I think that today we can say that it is working very well,\" he continued.\n\"The team is playing incredibly well, we are leaders of La Liga and we are playing well in the Champions League. The new instructions are working perfectly. I am jealous every week, the team is giving good sensations and they are winning, but it is frustrating to watch it from the outside, without being able to be on the pitch and be part of the team. I want to watch all the games but, at the same time, it is very difficult.\"",
