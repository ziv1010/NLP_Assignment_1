We have to do that together.\n\"The players gave everything, we saw the spirit. I have to pay a big compliment for the way they worked together as a team against a good Bayern side. You need energy when the game is going, and especially in forward positions the options [on the bench] were limited.\n\"I don't look with regret [at the campaign]. We want to be in the Champions League, the target was always to qualify for the knock-outs, but we have to learn from it, and accept we played some good football.\n\"Rasmus Hojlund scored five times, we had some very good performances, and we have to take that into the Premier League. We want to be back in the Champions League again and so we have to qualify again.\"\nTen Hag was adamant United played well against Bayern in their closing fixture but acknowledged the damage was done long before kick-off.\n\"We didn't lose it today, that's clear,\" he said. \"We had some good performances, but made some individual mistakes.\n\"It's not good enough. Today the performance was very good. We didn't deserve to lose, but we lost the game.\n\"The team did very good, we were very good defensively and in the pressing. We had many ball regains, especially second half. But then we didn't take enough benefit from it - we were playing against a strong side.\n\"Bayern always, even when they are not in the game, have enough individual class to produce one moment - and that's what happened.\"",
