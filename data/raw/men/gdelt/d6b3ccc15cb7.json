  "body_text": "This victory not only marked PSG's first European crown but also set a record for the largest winning margin in a Champions League final.\nDésiré Doué: The teenage sensation leading PSG's charge\nDésiré Doué's performance was nothing short of extraordinary. At just 19 years and 362 days old, he became the youngest player to both score and assist in a Champions League final. His two goals and an assist not only propelled PSG to victory but also etched his name into the annals of football history.\nDoué's journey to this pinnacle has been marked by dedication and rapid development. Emerging from PSG's youth academy, his ascent to the first team and subsequent impact on the European stage exemplify the club's renewed focus on nurturing homegrown talent.\nHis composure, vision, and technical prowess have drawn comparisons to seasoned professionals, signaling a bright future ahead.\nThe final\nThe match commenced with PSG asserting dominance early on. Achraf Hakimi, facing his former club, opened the scoring in the 12th minute, capitalizing on a precise assist from 19-year-old Désiré Doué.\nDoué, showcasing maturity beyond his years, doubled the lead in the 20th minute with a deflected shot that left Inter's defense scrambling. He further solidified his standout performance by netting PSG's third goal in the 63rd minute, becoming only the third teenager to score in a Champions League final, joining the ranks of Patrick Kluivert and Carlos Alberto.\nThe onslaught continued as Khvicha Kvaratskhelia added a fourth goal in the 73rd minute, followed by substitute Senny Mayulu, another 19-year-old, who sealed the historic win with a goal in the 86th minute.\nUnder the stewardship of manager Luis Enrique, PSG's triumph signifies a strategic shift from previous star-centric approaches to a cohesive, team-oriented philosophy. Enrique, securing his second Champions League title as a manager, has instilled a culture of unity and resilience within the squad. This victory also completes a treble for PSG, having already clinched Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France titles this season.\nFor Inter Milan, the defeat was a stark contrast to their storied European pedigree. Fielding one of the oldest lineups in recent finals, they struggled to match PSG's pace and dynamism, highlighting the challenges of relying on experience without the infusion of youthful vigor.\nAs fireworks illuminated the Munich sky and captain Marquinhos hoisted the coveted trophy, PSG's victory resonated beyond the confines of the stadium.\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily International News Updates.\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily International News Updates.",
