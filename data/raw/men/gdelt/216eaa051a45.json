  "body_text": "FOOTBALL – Galeno curled in a sublime stoppage-time strike as FC Porto defeated Arsenal 1-0 in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie in Portugal last night.\nAppearing in a first knockout match in Europe’s premier club competition for seven years, Arsenal struggled to break down an organised Porto defence before Galeno’s last-gasp stroke of brilliance.\nThe defeat ended Arsenal’s eight-game unbeaten run against Portuguese opposition and leaves Mikel Arteta’s side with plenty of work to do in the return leg in London next month.\nArteta stuck with the same starting line-up for the third game in succession following his team’s 5-0 demolition of Burnley at the weekend.\nPorto defender Pepe, who turns 41 next week and is the oldest outfield player in Champions League history, made his 119th appearance in the competition.\nBy comparison, Arsenal’s starters had combined for a total of 104 before kick-off at the Estadio do Dragao.\nWhile short on Champions League experience, Arteta has said his squad have the belief they can mix it with Europe’s best.\nThe Gunners have started the new year with five successive wins in the Premier League, scoring 21 goals in those games, and are firmly in the race for a first title since 2004.\nAs well as reigning supreme in England for the first time in 20 years, the north Londoners are convinced they can also conquer Europe, spurred on further by the prospect of a Wembley final.\nArsenal have never won the Champions League – losing their only final appearance against Barcelona in 2006.\nPorto, European champions in 1987 and 2004, are a disappointing third in Portugal this term, but frustrated Arsenal throughout.\nThey were happy to cede possession and allow Arsenal to dictate the tempo in the first half, but it was the hosts who created the best chance.\nFrancisco Conceicao darted in from the right and slid over a cross that looped off a sliding Gabriel, with Galeno rifling against the far post and then steering the rebound wide after the ball came right back to him.\nWilliam Saliba and Kai Havertz headed wide at corners either side of a Nico Gonzalez drive that sailed over in a physical opening 45 minutes.\nLeandro Trossard, deployed again as the leader of the attack alongside Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli, lashed over on the volley from Declan Rice’s driven corner early in the second half.\nArteta made his first change with a quarter of an hour left, replacing Trossard with Jorginho, as Arsenal sought additional control in the closing minutes only to be undone by a moment of magic from Galeno.\nMeanwhile, Victor Osimhen made a special return to action for Napoli as his goal gave the Italian champions a 1-1 draw with Barcelona.\nNigeria forward Osimhen rolled home the leveller with 15 minutes left of the first leg at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona in his first match since returning from the African Cup of Nations.\nThe 25-year-old equalised Robert Lewandowski’s 60th-minute opener, which seemed likely to be the decisive goal as Barca were for long periods the better team, with Napoli’s first and only shot on target.\nOsimhen had last played for Napoli in a 2-0 defeat at Roma just before Christmas, when he was one of two players from his team to be sent off.\nHis ninth club goal of the season came at a crucial time, not just in the match but in Napoli’s campaign as they play under their third manager of the season in Francesco Calzona.",
