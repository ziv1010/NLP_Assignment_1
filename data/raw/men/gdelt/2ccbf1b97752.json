  "body_text": "Brands laments interference from Moshiri and Benitez during time at Everton\nFormer Everton Director of Football, Marcel Brands, has spoken of how the impatience and interference by owner Farhad Moshiri made it difficult for him to perform the job he was hired to do.\nBrands, brought on board from PSV Eindhoven to replace Steve Walsh at Finch Farm, amid much anticipation in 2018 resigned his post in December 2021 citing significant differences over recruitment policy following the appointment of Rafael Benitez as manager the previous June, a move the Dutchman opposed.\nThe Spaniard’s renowned propensity to take charge of player recruitment proved to be the final straw for Brands who stepped down after the humiliating Goodison derby during which there were calls for change at Boardroom level from many Everton supporters.\nIt appeared as though Brands had been an easy target given that Benitez was just six months into his tenure and there was no appetite among his fellow Board members to fall on their own swords. The former Liverpool manager would follow Brands out the door the following month, sacked following a horrendous run of results, but not before he had saddled the club with Salomon Rondon and forced Lucas Digne out in a £27m move to Aston Villa.\nSpeaking to NRC in his native Netherlands, Brands reiterates that he fought to keep Marco Silva in his job as head coach in December 2019 but was overruled and then recommended that Everton hire Mikel Arteta when Moshiri opted for Carlo Ancelotti. He also alludes to meetings held, in the words of NRC, \"on expensive yachts and phone calls where the coach was told who to line up\" on which he doesn't elaborate \"out of respect\" for his previous employer.\n“English culture makes fans and media think that the manager is about transfers and the owner determines a lot,” explains Brands who is now back at PSV. “He wanted Rafael Benítez as coach in 2021, which was not my choice. And Benítez wanted Salomon Rondon, I couldn't approve that.\n“He was already in his thirties, was not on the scouting list, he was not going to bring Everton anything. Too high salary too. I said I thought it was a bad idea. Think of it as a present for the trainer, said the owner. Then you are powerless.\n“The problem is: there is no patience. Twelve coaches have already been fired in the Premier League this season. In my second year, Marco Silva was fired, I tried to prevent that, but it was beyond my control. While I knew: he is a good trainer, he is now proving that at Fulham. The owner also determined that there should be an experienced successor, while the chairman and I wanted Mikel Arteta. In the end it was Carlo Ancelotti.\n“In the first years I still had the idea that I could change something at Everton but that did not work out.\n“I think [the owners] want the best for the club but I firmly believe that with good policy you can achieve something. They think, 'I'm pumping money into it, so it should quickly yield success, right?' But in the Premier League everyone has a lot of money.”\nReader Comments (86)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Moshiri alone sacked Silva.\nRondon brought nothing to the team and his wages were outrageous. But then he says he can't say more out of respect to the club. So that's the light versionâ€¦\n2 Posted 28/04/2023 at 18:01:06\n3 Posted 28/04/2023 at 18:31:03\nBrands (61) has a nose for talent, is financially well versed, negotiates sharply and is known to be extremely competitive. Yet things did not go as planned at Everton â€“ officially owned by British-Iranian businessman Farhad Moshiri, although oligarch Alisher Usmanov is closely involved in the background, according to The Guardian.\nDespite a good relationship with club chairman Bill Kenwright â€“ 'Indy' he called Brands, the chairman thought he resembled Indiana Jones actor Harrison Ford â€“ he stepped down as technical director in December 2021, disillusioned. \"Different views\" on the policy to be pursued, was the official explanation. Things were going badly for the club and the English media judged harshly. After a 4-1 defeat against city rival Liverpool, Brands even got into a fight with an angry fan.\nBrands was 59 when he left. He was devastated. Perhaps the most difficult moment of his career coincided with a worrying situation at home. His son turned out to be seriously ill (he has since recovered). \"I had to do nothing for a while,\" he says, in his office in the Philips Stadium. \"I have never had more than 10 days' holiday since I quit football at 35 and joined management. So I took my son to Dubai and we went to Disney with the children and grandchildren.\"\nBut quitting? \"I never seriously thought about that.\"\nAfter that break, Brands said yes when he could succeed Toon Gerbrands as PSV's general manager last year. Just like in 2010 â€“ when he started as technical manager in Eindhoven â€“ he has to make the club financially and sportingly successful again. The former has more or less succeeded, the sporting resurgence is yet to take shape. A first success beckons this Sunday, when PSV play the cup final against Ajax.\nHow does working in the Netherlands differ from England?\n\"It is totally different. The English culture makes fans and media think the manager [the coach] is about transfers. And the owner decides a lot. He wanted Rafael BenÃtez as coach in 2021, which was not my choice. And BenÃtez wanted Salomon Rondon, which I could not approve. He was already in his 30s, was not on the scouting list, he was not going to bring Everton anything more. Far too high a salary too. I said I thought it was a bad idea. Think of it as a present for the coach, the owner said. Then you are powerless.\"\nBut you will be judged on transfers.\n\"The problem is: there is no patience. Twelve coaches have already been sacked in the Premier League this season. In my second year, Marco Silva was sacked, I tried to prevent that, but it was beyond my control. While I knew: he is a good coach, he is proving that now at Fulham. The owner also stipulated that there should be an experienced successor, while the chairman and I wanted Mikel Arteta. In the end it became Carlo Ancelotti.\"\nWhat does it do to employees when you are at the mercy of an owner's whims?\n\"People try to survive. The nasty thing is: in those rounds of layoffs, a lot of good club people often go with them. Physiotherapists, analysts, you name it. I then had to send away people who were good, worked hard. That is difficult. And it doesn't work either. The first few years I still had the idea that I could change something at Everton. But that didn't work out.\"\nBrands cannot go into too much detail \"out of respect\" for his former employer. But he tells, without being able to name names, about meetings on expensive yachts and phone calls telling the coach who to draft. \"You can't imagine that world if you haven't seen it yourself,\" he says.\nAn extraordinary adventure, but so you couldn't actually do your job. Why do you still look back with pleasure?\n\"You also get a lot of appreciation. Because I paid attention to the youth, to the structure, that you look beyond transfers and really try to build something. When I first went to watch Young Everton, I got an app from that coach: how fantastic that you are there, I have never experienced that before. I never saw a technical director from other clubs at duels like that either. And we lived beautifully, the football is great.\"\nDoesn't it strike you as cynical that owners treat it like it's their toy?\n\"They do have the best interests of the club at heart, I think. But I firmly believe that you can achieve something with good policy. They think: I'm pumping money into it, then it must produce success quickly, right? But in the Premier League, everyone has a lot of money. The crazy thing is: we get more from commercial activities with PSV than Everton, but they get between 130 and 140 million in TV money [against almost 9 million with PSV]. That makes it all a bit easier.\"\n4 Posted 28/04/2023 at 18:54:49\nI've had a gift like that!? It was from Woolworths in the '70s. So Moshiri gets in a professional, Marcel Brands, and then ties his hands together behind his back so he can't do his job. Now Kenwright dares to say \"It was me that found you the Billionaire\" â€“ Found us a power-mad buffoon more like.\nBeggars belief, the whole sodding circus. Run by lunatics with not an ounce of footballing acumen. We all knew it but to read it in black and white is quite numbing. We clearly don't know the half of it. Not sure I could stomach it.\n5 Posted 28/04/2023 at 19:07:12\nI think he was our highest paid director, nobody else has offered him a comparable salary, simply staggering. Just joins the long line of mercenaries and leeches who've run our club into the ground and not accepted their responsibility.\n6 Posted 28/04/2023 at 20:25:48\n7 Posted 28/04/2023 at 20:43:51\nAs regards Arteta, my guess is that, even if he had accepted an offer, he would have been lost amid the dysfunction around him.\n8 Posted 28/04/2023 at 20:48:27\nIf we'd hired Artea, he'd have been sacked within 12 months and he'd now be managing Fulham or Brighton or the like and doing well.\n9 Posted 28/04/2023 at 20:55:23\n10 Posted 28/04/2023 at 21:01:57\nHe kept his mouth shut for long enough though, just like Sharp, has kept his mouth shut recently, with my own conclusion being that Everton has become nothing but a gravy train.\n11 Posted 28/04/2023 at 21:03:08\nThe whole saga since Moshiri arrived stinks to high heaven, and we as fans are paying the price for the ineptitude of anybody that was employed by the club during this period. I don't care for former employees telling their own version of the truth when they could have stood up and been counted whilst they were in a position to alter things.\nI don't know whether there is any truth in the rumour that Investigators from the Federal Criminal Police Office searched the Allianz Arena and the headquarters of FC Bayern on Tuesday. Reason: A money laundering procedure against Russian oligarch and billionaire Alisher Usmanov â€“ @BILD\nApparently it has to do with Champions League tickets for Bayern matches given to Usmanov, and Bayern are only seen as witnesses in the investigation.\n12 Posted 28/04/2023 at 21:04:34\n14 Posted 28/04/2023 at 21:12:19\nIf he was Director of Football, why didn't he come out, say his piece and resign! I can only guess!!!\nRespect for his previous employers??? My left foot!\n15 Posted 28/04/2023 at 21:15:23\nI thought Brands, going by his record, was a good appointment, and he was doing okay but then he was appointed on to the board and things changed, did the board, Kenwright, get to him?\n16 Posted 28/04/2023 at 21:17:54\nIt's a jigsaw price that's finally showing what's actually been happening at the top of the club. You can add Moshiri to the list of incompetence of Kenwright who found him. The only due diligence done was probably \"How much do I get?\"\nBrands lacked the integrity to walk in the face of the owner's interference but that should not dismiss what events leading up to it as being true. Nails in a coffinâ€¦\n17 Posted 28/04/2023 at 21:25:42\n18 Posted 28/04/2023 at 21:26:05\nHe did not secure transfer funds for Ancelotti and he left. He then became the main opposition to Benitez, pushed forward by Kenwright & Co. Not being his own man finally resulted in him becoming a scapegoat himself.\n19 Posted 28/04/2023 at 22:06:38\nHappened with the venkys at blackburn, admittedly they thought they were buying a premier league franchise but after it is well renowned money was been laundered and a complete disregard for the clubs welfare.\nWorst thing is things are going to get a lot worse before they get any better.\n20 Posted 28/04/2023 at 22:07:42\nI think we have all seen how Kenwright has played Moshiri and his ego, when that horrible smarmy smiling voice, told everyone that Farhad is the man who just keeps on giving?\nBrands took the blunt of the blame, because he let his guard down and was exposed in front of the fans, but he never did tell us who's fault it was besides the players?\nMoshiri and Kenwright, made sure they protected themselves, and the fabulous Denise Barrett Braxendale, when they informed everyone that she had been looking for alternative employment (it genuinely reminded of the Chris Samuelson sketch) and then we got the strategic review!\nI said it this morning on another thread, but I left Goodison last night, thinking about how Wayne Rooney, was made to be the bad guy, when it was obvious which party had instigated proceedings to try and force the seventeen year old kid, out of our club, and I left our stadium with this uppermost in my thoughts, after seeing history repeating itself with the booing of Anthony Gordon.\nKenwright was the master player, but luckily for him, he didn't need a master plan, and the gullible Evertonians have been very complicit, and this is what breaks my heart.\n21 Posted 28/04/2023 at 22:15:54\nSemi pro standard experience.\n22 Posted 28/04/2023 at 22:34:32\n23 Posted 28/04/2023 at 22:37:37\nKenwright found someone with money who thought and acted like himself..my money, my trainset.. fans are like mushrooms, say nothing, feed them bullshit..\nThe purchase of the club was a vehicle for a real estate bonanza, except the vehicle had a motor that needed replacing because the previous owner lied about its condition...they deserve each other.. but the fans deserve neither..never have.. but the Arthur Daley of the football world never had the money or the acumen to sit at their table. The wide boy who really fucked us up.\n24 Posted 28/04/2023 at 22:50:18\nI think Brands is being very selective in what he's saying, and the reason I have these thoughts is because of how much Rafa Benitez was incredibly given to spend?\nI remember one episode of Minder, when the great Arther Daley, decided he was going to go straight Christine, but by the end of the show he couldn't wait to get back into his own environment, stating that he had never met so many bad people as he had in the supposedly straight world. It's why villains send their children to university!!!\n25 Posted 28/04/2023 at 22:54:39\nEverton FC will recover and it will be in BMD, an expensive masterpiece for a failed project. But Kenwright, Moshiri will be gone... no gain without pain.\n26 Posted 28/04/2023 at 23:08:52\n27 Posted 28/04/2023 at 23:22:54\n28 Posted 28/04/2023 at 23:38:05\nSomewhere along the way our club has been stolen from us, peddled to a completely inappropriate owner by a complete charlatan and staffed by poorly qualified managers staff and associated hangers on. All of this done in plain sight with none of this called out by the journalists who all had their tummies tickled by the regime at Everton. What is the truth in all of this? We'll never know.\nI used to loose sleep worrying about relegation going back to the Wimbledon game, the Coventry game, the Crystal Palace game but now in the words of Pink Floyd I'm comfortably numb. I'm resigned to our fate now. The latest manager has returned to Martinez levels of delusion. I have a vote of no confidence in the entire infrastructure of the club. The only thing I have any confidence in at this time is the supporters but I fear the race is sadly run.\nI hope against hope for some combination of events which could save us but as the saying goes hope dies last. We need a root and branch restructure at this club.\n29 Posted 28/04/2023 at 23:45:21\nThe link you provided is a Guardian story from last September, it's been revived because of the 'raid' on Bayern Munich which was referred to earlier in this thread.\nIn yellow at the top of the Guardian article it states 'this article is more than 7 months old'\n30 Posted 29/04/2023 at 01:58:42\n31 Posted 29/04/2023 at 05:45:47\nThere was a rumor going round that Moshiri bought Iwobi without the manager's knowledge and it's fairly certain he pushed for him to be selected.\nBut remember 22 players were brought in on Brands watch including Moise kean, Gbamin, Nkuoncou, Brandthwaite, Gomes, Bernard, Digne and Lossl- a real mixed bag of success and failure.\nLooking for the truth I don't think there is an honest man at the club so we'll have to form our own conclusions\n32 Posted 29/04/2023 at 06:27:18\nPaul swan's second paragraph@23, tells me everything about modern day Everton, which is unidentifiable with the football club I fell in love with, the first time I ever set inside Goodison Pk.\nEverton will recover, it will take time because nepotistic poison is embedded very deeply inside our club, but we will recover and we will come again because WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED! It's in our DNA.\n33 Posted 29/04/2023 at 06:42:34\nPerhaps we can have an appraisal of every Director of Football, Manager, and all players signed since the Moyes era?\nThe long suffering, exasperated fans deserve explanations from the board, as to why our great club has sunken to this level, and when they have explained, they should apologise and resign.\n35 Posted 29/04/2023 at 06:43:30\nI drove past “Destination Kirkbyâ€ last night, and to think a genuine Evertonian, would think that this would have been a good move for Everton football club, is simply incredible, and very, very difficult to comprehend?\nI first met a man who ended up on the FAB committee, whilst going to look at the plans for this greedy disastrous plan, and he told me that although he lived over the road from where the stadium was going to be built, him and his gang were going to fight it, because it simply wasn't good enough for our great club.\nImagine facing relegation whilst playing our football in Kirkby? no disrespect but fucking Kirkby?\nBill Kenwright is not and has never been, one of us, so thankfully the devious bastard has finally been found out, although this hasn't stopped the jinx from putting his horrible face back above the ticket office on Goodison Rd. (Have you ever put a picture of Farhad on the timeline that stopped the minute you got your claws into Everton, William?)\nWe were in a decent position so the bastard has gone and jinxed us again.\n36 Posted 29/04/2023 at 08:14:25\n37 Posted 29/04/2023 at 08:39:10\nExactly what went on behind closed doors will never be clear. It would seem very likely that Brands was inhibited from doing his job properly but nonetheless he was part of the machine that drove very far off the tracks.\nAnyone who has been on the board in the last 6 years has to bear responsibility.\n38 Posted 29/04/2023 at 08:51:34\nBrands signed inexperience at a time Silva needed an experienced central defender in the Kurt Zhumer mold, and although this type of thing might have worked in the Dutch league, I think he learned that England was a different kettle of fish?\nThis was especially true at Everton, with everyone being in a rush of wanting us to get back to what we consider our rightful place near the top of English football.\nIt looks like Brands and Moshiri obviously wanted the same thing, but had completely different ideas about how to achieve the success that we all crave, with the end result being that Everton are now completely lost\n39 Posted 29/04/2023 at 09:06:03\nAnd we all wanted Silva out, to be fair. Plus arteta wanted the arsenal job, which he took when we borrowed Ancelotti from the top table for a short holiday in Crosby.\n40 Posted 29/04/2023 at 09:11:49\nHow dairy?\n41 Posted 29/04/2023 at 09:30:03\nI'm more sympathetic to Kenwright but I believe his time is up and that he should have moved on when Moshiri arrived. The best actors know when to leave the stage.\n42 Posted 29/04/2023 at 09:33:23\nThe fact Moshiri hired him only to overrule him with mad ideas like appointing Benitez tells you EVERYTHING about who is to blame for our imminent relegation.\nHint: the fella railing against the Benitez appointment very likely isn't the culprit\n43 Posted 29/04/2023 at 09:38:53\nHe probably did signs a Non disclosure agreement, but ask long as he doesn't attack Kenwright nothing will happen.\nChristine#26\nMy view is different on that .MoshisI having spent millions on players that were recruited by the so called professionals and he assumed had the expertise to do so,as a accountant, he would quite naturally ask why they were not playing.\nI think Brands is deliberately being vague with the use of the word ' Trainer', to cover his weakness in the whole situation.as the Director of Football..\nActually Thewell is in hiding at the moment for similar reasons ,doing everything to avoid being part of the story.\n44 Posted 29/04/2023 at 09:52:44\n45 Posted 29/04/2023 at 10:02:49\nKenwright is happy for Brands to release this message to the press because he wants Moshiri to take the blame without directly saying it himself. Brands is deflecting the blame from Kenwright fully onto Moshiri\nI probably typed my original message @ 6 wrongly\nBrands is clearly on Kenwrights team. He's helping to knife Moshiri\nKenwright is cornered and happy for any blame to land at Farhads doorstep\n46 Posted 29/04/2023 at 10:16:44\nJournalists are now aware that our club has been a hornet's nest, full of dirty Russian money, dodgy deals and terrible, amature interference amid a power struggle.\nNo wonder some of the playing staff have experienced mental problems.\nThe managers roll-in, tow the line, are let down, then are sacked. They stay schtum with pockets lined with dosh but all of them have taken the dollars and accepted interference from the owner/Chairman throughout.\nOnce the lifeline of PL millions is reduced and then cut-off, then this bloated monstrosity of a club will self-destruct.\nIt might already be too late to save us from plummetting down the leagues.\nParachute payments will help in the first season but ridiculous contracts for average players will soon absorb that money. The ground will be sold and we will be left renting like West Ham.\nThe oligarchs have ruined us with our dear Leader the architect of our demise.\nLampard and even Dyche could tell us a few tales about what really happened in those transfer deadline hours.\nThis is just the start...more shit is going to hit the fan.\nAnd even if we stay up, the PL might hit us with a points deduction which would make relegation a certainty next year.\nWe are hated by the clubs that we used to rub along with, we are hated by the \"smaller\" clubs who saw us as one of the big Five who set-up the current gravt train, we are despised by pundits, Redshite journos and lefty Guardian readers, all lapping-up our links to dirty Russians.\nWe are now ripe for reprisals. The clubs like Watford, whose manager we unsettled and bought, fans of clubs like Burnley, whose best players we cherry-picked when they went down, and all of the clubs and fans who have envied our proud status for so many years.\nWe will all have to eat humble pie, like West Ham, like Villa, leeds and Forest.\nEverything is about to change.\n47 Posted 29/04/2023 at 10:24:25\nI've never witnessed this hatred of Everton. We're generally seen as a proper old school football club with a proper old school local fan base. With the exception of out of town RS and bitter Barcodes, we're generally well liked as a club.\n48 Posted 29/04/2023 at 10:41:30\nThey're close to untouchable, and being appointed to a board gives you certain privileges that you're not going to relinquish by saying anything against the board/boys club that you've been invited to join.\nExpecting a board member to squeal, is like expecting Everton to win football matches. ie, never gonna happen.\n49 Posted 29/04/2023 at 10:41:44\nMoshiri says he's not the decision maker.\nWho is then? Usmanov?\n50 Posted 29/04/2023 at 10:45:02\nRegarding Brands mentioning the Yacht, he is talking about Usmanovs yacht that was berthed in Sardinia which is were they conducted interviews with Benitez. I actually posted this 2 days before Benitez signed as an impeccable source told me about Benitez being on Usmanovs boat.\nDespite the sanctions against Usmanov, I still don't believe that he and Moshiri are still not having conversations about the money they have poured into Everton and how best to get out without losing anymore money.\nI think this absolutely means that this club cannot move forward until Usmanov, Moshiri, Kenwright and the rest of the board are removed from this club. I know whoever takes over will face a very difficult situation, and provided they have knowledge of how to run a sporting club, but unless the present owners and associates are removed this club will continue to under perform.\n51 Posted 29/04/2023 at 10:47:53\nBeing a so called 'old school' club in the modern day, and the fairy-tale fascination with history is one of the many things that's strangled the club for years. Our failure to modernise is now haunting us big time. Tin-pot Everton run by small minded thinkers and dreamers with blue tinted specs on.\nYou ask around at other clubs, speak to other fans and we don't have the reputation we think we do. Well not in my experience anyway.\n52 Posted 29/04/2023 at 10:54:20\nTouchÃ©. I've never seen any hatred towards Everton at any Premier League grounds other than the normal banter between fans.. and I've had no problems drinking in their pubs either.\nWe are still in with a massive shout as to whether we get relegated or not and I can't believe any Blue is going to go to Leciester or Brighton thinking otherwise...\nI've seen Forest and Leeds play and, believe me, they are both shit â€“ far shitter than Everton â€“ so for me, let's just keep going.\n53 Posted 29/04/2023 at 10:56:25\nIn our efforts to get Moshiri to sell, we could start going for the financial starvation route and it becomes a dilemma for us fans stuck between \"If you love Everton, stay away\" versus \"Turn up and support your team when they need you\" â€“ dividing the fans for the first time in 145 years and potentially a new low in our glorious history created by the current owner and leadership.\nOnly Moshiri can prevent this happening and it's his responsibility to act before we reach this point.\n54 Posted 29/04/2023 at 11:03:13\nKenwright is the clear issue throughout all of our problems which has been done to death on ToffeeWeb so no need to go into it any more except to say that even if we survive the drop the damage that has been done can only be repaired by experienced business minded owners who will clear the deck and start afresh.\nSean Dyche himself is already taking blame for our latest poor form and it goes without saying that if he does not make changes to both the line up and strategy for Monday nights game then very few of us will want him as our manager from here on. Godfrey is shot to pieces, Maupay is useless and Michael Keane is back to his worst. We just can't approach this next game as we have the last few given the consequences.\n55 Posted 29/04/2023 at 11:04:48\nWhilst it was undeniably a contributing factor to our current plight, I keep thinking back to that season with Carlo, when we took our shot. Skyscrapers in South America lighting up blue. Second at Christmas. A world class manager. That level of investment was a risk for a club of our stature, it didn't work out, and we're paying for it now.\nWe'll be back. I'm confident it will be just a few years away from the top table. And we'll undoubtedly see more than 10 wins a season, which will be nice!\n56 Posted 29/04/2023 at 11:04:51\nBut, as I said yesterday, I've made my peace with relegation to, not only the Championship, but League 1. Because then we get to rebuild and watch our beloved club rise up the divisions again!\nLook at Sunderland, promotion last season and they went into the play off positions a few days ago. Do you really think any of their fans are sulking right now? No, they're having a great time.\nWe'll be back!\n57 Posted 29/04/2023 at 11:18:00\nIf and its a big if we are investigated I wouldn't mind betting that Kenwright himself is not squeaky clean with regards his accounting and financial affairs.\nThe man is a snake oil salesman, he has been allowed free reign, unchecked and nobody to hold him accountable for his actions.\nIt will be an interesting scenario.\n58 Posted 29/04/2023 at 11:22:07\nIn the coming weeks we will have all\nand sundry wheeled out blaming the opposing camp within the organisation hoping something will stick to get them of the hung of incompetence.\nWe are about to see the rats abandon ship.\nIf Everton survive being relegated, which is still possible giving the twist and turns that are still.possible, all will be egged.\n59 Posted 29/04/2023 at 11:24:08\nA professional, well funded consortium, even a loser in the Man U bidding, is welcome to get us a bargain price. Fantastic iconic stadium, incredibly loyal fans, a club ready to unite and build something new after the lost Kenwright years.\nIt's unlikely but sometimes incredibly wealthy people like a challenge, especially a hugely exciting bet at the right price.\nIt's now time for Everton and Moshiri to offer both.\n60 Posted 29/04/2023 at 11:34:23\nWe are now entering the lesser spotted stage.\n61 Posted 29/04/2023 at 11:55:37\nThe problem is with the club management.\nTalk of investment / takeover by sports businesses encourages me. We need professionals in charge.\n62 Posted 29/04/2023 at 12:00:18\nIt makes me think those in control (owner/board/others, someone recently sanctioned by Government?) have been running the club as nothing more than a trading floor. Buying and selling players like stocks and shares. No interest in success on the field, as long as the right 'option' is placed on display at the right time for a sale.\nEverton's games since 2016 have been little more than shop windows. With the one ahead of an increasingly likely fire sale the biggest of all.\nNot that those in power seem to have been that successful given our reported financial position And most alarming of all, it makes sense, an unpalatable explanation for the incredible record of the Moshiri reign.\n63 Posted 29/04/2023 at 12:12:03\nIwobi would be top earner in Newcastle!! He is better paid than Odegaard and Maddison. He is on more than double salary than the best paid Brentford player.\nWho on earth is making such decisions?\nAccording to the above he was bought by Moshiri.\nI am not a conspiracy theorist but is that why every manager has been playing him? A combination of being bought by the owner and he highest paid asset that needs to be protected?\nI guess he has played under Silva, Ancelotti, Benitez, Lampard and now Dyche. Only Lampard managed to get a tone out of Iwobi for a short while. A part from that he has been a regular for a long time no matter how poor he has been playing.\nIf he was homegrown and on 15k a week would he have a regular in a PL side?\nWe are such in a mess with internal politics that it is no surprise that we are where we are.\n64 Posted 29/04/2023 at 12:17:19\nI'm not even convinced Kenwright does any more, other than to pander to his enormous ego and allow him to look like the big 'I am'. And that is not going too well either.\nWhether in the PL or Championship, the question here is how to precipitate the exit of the failed ownership and board. I believe they would gratefully exit for the right price but it is hard to discern what that would be, who would offer it, and how it would be structured. And of course the answer will be very different if we are relegated.\n65 Posted 29/04/2023 at 12:28:02\nI've been convincing myself that we will crawl out of it but now even Dyche seems sanguine at our chances.\nMike @52, when you go to pubs do you think that polite people are going to tell you straight that they hope you go down?\nThink back to the countless times when we have sung \"going-down\" home and away. Fans remember.\n66 Posted 29/04/2023 at 12:39:29\nThat was always the case. All Moshiri & Co were interested in was getting in on a docklands and related development opportunities. They got in at a discount by allowing Kenwright to stay on.\nThey are actually happy for him to stay on convinced that all was needed was cash injected. They only got involved to curtail the excess. But were still more interested in the development side. Actually, the development side has been well run.\nIt will be interesting to see what happens when it all boils down. Even with the money he has spent, Moshiri & Co are still quids in.\nA developer is a totally different animal than a builder. Moshiri is a developer and investor. Probably adept at putting together investment packages for his associates. That is how he became a billionaire.\nIt seems the new investors are to do with the stadium rather than the club. That is why I still think that Kenwright is still in the wings to try to get Everton back again as a bargain.\n67 Posted 29/04/2023 at 13:22:41\nI lost faith around the Benitez appointment. Why get one of the most respected directors of football in Europe and not use his experience and expertise?\nThis is why it's not just the board who need to go, Moshiri is as culpable as anyone. He can say it's his money, but it's not his club to ruin! His money has got us nowhere. Meddling in player signings and DoF duties is a joke.\nWhat does this joker know about football? Why does he think he knows better than Brands?\nWe all know Kenwright's time is up. But I believe that the root cause is Moshiri; you could have a whole new board but, if this clown keeps sticking his nose into playing aspects, it's all a waste of time!\n68 Posted 29/04/2023 at 14:23:23\nAs an Evertonian, I've never understood how the Chairman could watch what fans watch, see what fans see, and be totally sanguine about it. The Chairman is a gambler, as pointed out by a poster who relayed the story about a £50k bet that the Chairman put on the 1995 FA Cup final. Apparently, so too is Mr Moshiri, who enjoys trips to the Casino.\nFrom a purely football point of view, the last few years have been an unmitigated disaster for the club, for a few lucky punters, who may have known what and when to back. there may well have been some really huge paydays\n69 Posted 29/04/2023 at 14:28:30\nThat last thought of yours has occurred to me also and fills me with despair. Can I still support a club owned and run by that fraud? It's not a given. The stupid thing is, he could have had pretty much all the glory and none of the grief had he allowed himself to be shifted to some quasi ceremonial role when Moshiri took over. At that point his stock was high enough to pull that off.\nReading Paul the Esk's articles, I've also mused on the possibility of some kind of seperation between club and stadium, more because I see that as the only viable exit strategy for Moshiri, bar a total meltdown. It is already structured in such a way as to allow it to be easily peeled off.\nBalanced against that, what use is a stadium without a club attached, and given its scale, a PL club to boot? And what value is there in a club without a stadium? I think we've seen enough examples to know that doesn't work. That implies there has to be connection beyond a mere rental agreement. Maybe a very long term lease with some cross share ownership?\n70 Posted 29/04/2023 at 14:34:04\nI switched off at aged 10 when we sold Alan Ball.. Only to switch back on when we won the FA cup in the 80s..\nBut now my switch is truly off because of Billy lair\nIt's embarrassing\n71 Posted 29/04/2023 at 14:42:47\nMark (Anderson) where is that switch? I wish I could find one. I've been trying for years but this bastard club keeps its claws deep in my skin. My Brighton tickets just arrived and I'm counting the hoursâ€¦ Up the fucking infuriating Toffees!!\n72 Posted 29/04/2023 at 15:07:19\nHis first 3 seasons, he was paid 50k per week. This one and the next, it's around 120k per.\nI'm not arguing the total amount is still too much. But in average, Iwobi was on about 78k per week, which is a little less than what Keane gets and a little more than what Godfrey gets.\nSo, yeah, Moshiri throws it around quite a bit.\nTo me, the big and immediate problem if relegated is the Dele/Gomes/Gbamin 300k per week. They're not in the Club's plans but get another year in wages.\nThen the Tark/Keane/Godfrey/Holgate 325k per week for at least the next 2 seasons. With Branthwaite in the wings, we could (need to?) get rid of 2 of those.\n73 Posted 29/04/2023 at 15:30:55\n74 Posted 29/04/2023 at 16:48:18\nThat's the exact opposite of what I think. Arteta would have been a great manager and also fits the mold of only ex-Everton players being successful Everton managers since WW2.\nWe are now seeing what Silva can do at Fulham. They're 10th. We're 19th and drowning...\n75 Posted 29/04/2023 at 17:30:47\nI said to someone this week, half in jest, that we might not need to win another game to stay up. Maybe I was right? That would be our best chance, I think!\n76 Posted 29/04/2023 at 17:56:33\n77 Posted 29/04/2023 at 18:18:23\n78 Posted 29/04/2023 at 19:57:46\nAncelotti is one of the great managers of all time; if we would have replaced Martinez with him, I believe we would now be playing Champions League football regularly. Unfortunately, we got him when the money had gone, it was too late.\nSilva was out of his depth at Everton, he was not capable of taking Everton forward. He's 10th with Fulham, great, he can take a small club to mid-table. It doesn't mean he can take a club with money to compete at the top, something he proved as our manager.\n79 Posted 29/04/2023 at 20:51:21\nHindsight is a wonderful thing but wearing rose-tinted specs with a different set of circumstances is not a true barometer.\nArteta only started being successful when they brought in Albert Stuivenberg, a highly rated Dutch coach, and Steve Round to assist him with Edu coming in as DOF and recruiting some top players for fees we can only dream about.\nSilva was complemented by Boa Morte so it's more about creating the conditions in which Silva or Arteta could be effective â€“ which wouldn't have happened at Everton.\n80 Posted 29/04/2023 at 21:18:27\n81 Posted 29/04/2023 at 21:52:24\nWe're quite likely to be relegated, without a trophy in 28 years.\nSadly we're all suffering from the delusion that we're still a relevant big club.\n82 Posted 29/04/2023 at 22:45:10\nThere is a big difference between the Everton that was consistently in the Top 7 with the injection of half a billion pounds on its way, and the Everton of today.\nIf Moshiri had got in a manager and board who knew what they were doing and stayed out of footballing decisions, we could have gone from big club to giant club.\nInstead, he meddled in things he knew nothing about and left Chairman Nero and his cronies to run things. They appointed managers ill-equipped to transform us, Silva was one of those.\nLet's not compare this pathetic shell of a club with the great club it has been and may one day be again.\n83 Posted 30/04/2023 at 09:35:46\n84 Posted 30/04/2023 at 19:55:23\nWe now have a manager here that nearly got relegated with Burnley but was sacked before it happened.\n85 Posted 30/04/2023 at 19:59:09\n86 Posted 01/05/2023 at 19:20:48\n87 Posted 03/05/2023 at 15:04:28\nSilva got Fulham promoted and has them mid table, that's a fact. Whether he could do better with a bigger club is a matter of opinion. Whether Everton would have been relegated or not in the year that he was sacked again is a matter or opinion.\nDyche was sacked last season before Burnley's fate was determined, that a fact. Whether he could have kept them up or not is a matter of opinion.\n88 Posted 04/05/2023 at 19:05:35\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
