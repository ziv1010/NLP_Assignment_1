But one day I would like to go back.”\nLeeds are reportedly considering an ambitious move for Mourinho, although they may struggle to convince him to join a newly-promoted team.\nClassic Jose Mourinho

the summer after a disastrous Premier League season.\nHis reputation has taken a substantial hit over the last few months, but he did a brilliant job at Celtic and the likes of Mourinho, Antonio Conte and Nuno Espirito Santo also struggled at Spurs.\nElland Road has been touted as a potential destination for the 59-year-old and his high-octane style of football has prompted comparisons with former Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa.\nLee Carsley\nCarsley won a lot of admirers in the summer of 2023 after guiding England Under-21s to European Championship glory with a modern possession-based approach.\nHe was named interim head coach of the England senior men’s team in August 2024 and oversaw six games, leading the team to five wins and one defeat before returning to his role with the Under-21s.\nLeeds have reportedly placed the 51-year-old on their shortlist but he hasn’t been involved in club management since 2017, when he took caretaker charge of Birmingham City for three games.\nDavide Ancelotti\nSon of Carlo Ancelotti, Davide has also worked as his assistant at Bayern Munich, Napoli, Everton and Real Madrid.\n“Davide completes Carlo and helps him understand the evolution of football,” former Bayern midfielder Javi Martinez said. “Davide is incredible: prepared, serious, a great person, like his father.”\nHe has taken charge of two games in the absence of his father, losing 2-1 against Roma in 2019 and recently leading Madrid to a 1-0 win against Deportivo Alaves.\nAccording to reports in Spain, Davide will leave Madrid at the end of the season and is now looking for his first managerial role in first-team football.\nLeeds have reportedly made initial soundings towards the 35-year-old, although replacing Farke with a coach with just two first-team games under his belt would be a very bold move.\n🚨 Davide Ancelotti has been praised internally at Real Madrid for a long time.\nHe usually leads the training sessions with Francesco Mauri, something that’s apparent during the US tour, but is also seen during matches. @GuillermoRai_ pic.twitter.com/g1QHd8ksxL\n— Madrid Xtra (@MadridXtra) April 14, 2025\nKjetil Knutsen\nSince taking over at Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in 2018, Knutsen has forged a reputation as one of Europe’s most exciting coaches.\nHis expansive and open brand of football has been described as “kamikaze” by club captain Ulrik Saltness and it has also brought a lot of success.\nThe 56-year-old has won four of the last five Eliteserien titles and they have now become the first Norwegian side to reach the semi-finals of a major European competition.\nLeeds hold a long-standing interest in Knutsen, having first enquired over his services upon axing Jesse Marsch in February 2023.\n“He’s probably had some really good offers along the way and should he for some reason decide to do something else I think we should applaud him to the airport and say thank you,” Bodo/Glimt technical director Havard Sakariassen admitted.\nCesc Fabregas\nAfter enjoying a trophy-laden playing career, Fabregas is now regarded as one of the best young head coaches in Europe.\nThe former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder helped Como win promotion to Serie A last season before guiding them to a stable mid-table position in 2024/25.\nHis work has attracted interest from Roma, AC Milan, Juventus and RB Leipzig and online reports in England claim that Leeds have also joined the race for his signature.\nSteven Gerrard\nGerrard made a strong start to his managerial career and won a Scottish Premiership title at Rangers in 2020/21 but has since had difficult stints at Aston Villa and Al-Ettifaq.\nOnline reports in England claim that the 44-year-old is still on Leeds’ radar, although he has also been linked with a return to Rangers.\nGiovanni van Bronckhorst\nVan Bronckhorst replaced Gerrard at Rangers in November 2021 and had a year at Ibrox, winning a Scottish Cup and reaching a Europa League final.\nLeeds have reportedly made contact with the former Arsenal midfielder, who is currently out of work and wants to manage in England.\n“As a player I had ambition and as a coach I have ambition,” he said in 2020. “The Premier League for me is the number one league in the world to be working at and, for me, it is definitely an ambition to work in.”\nRoger Schmidt\nSchmidt has had stints in charge of Red Bull Salzburg, Bayer Leverkusen, PSV Eindhoven and Benfica among others, winning the Austrian Bundesliga, the Austrian Cup, the KNVB Cup and the Primeira Liga.\nHis teams are known for adopting a high-intensity approach and playing attack-minded football, and he has previously expressed his admiration for English football.\n“I like English football very much, because of the culture of football in the country,” Schmidt said. “You have a very good example in England with Jurgen Klopp.”\nHe has been out of work since losing his job at Benfica last August and Leeds have reportedly registered their interest in the 58-year-old.\nREAD MORE: The dream Leeds Utd XI to ensure Prem survival, boosted by double Liverpool signing",
