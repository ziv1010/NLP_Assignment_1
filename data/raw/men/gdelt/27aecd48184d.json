UEFA and other leagues in England’s football pyramid will be consulted.\nThe Premier League also confirmed the date and kick-off time for Manchester City’s away match against Brighton & Hove Albion with the fixture now scheduled for Wednesday, May 24.\nManchester United will host Chelsea a day later on Thursday, May 25.\nErik ten Hag’s side were due to host Chelsea this weekend but the fixture had to be postponed due to United’s FA Cup commitments.\nUnited face Brighton & Hove Albion at the semi-final stage of the FA Cup at Wembley on Sunday which meant their fixture against Chelsea had to be pushed back.\nAdvertisement\nIt means the two sides will now go head to head just three days before the Premier League campaign comes to an end on May 28.\nUnited host Fulham on the final day of the season while Chelsea entertain Newcastle United.\nWest Ham’s away trip to Brentford has been pushed back a day to May 14 due to the fact the east London side remain in the Europa Conference League.\nNew dates and KO times\nManchester City vs Leeds United – Saturday May 6 (3pm KO – Sky Sports)\nBrentford vs West Ham United – Sunday May 14 (2pm KO)\nBrighton vs Manchester City – Wednesday May 24 (8pm KO – Sky Sports)\nManchester United vs Chelsea – Thursday May 25 (8pm KO – Sky Sports)\nGO DEEPER\nExplained: Why crucial Premier League games won't be shown in England\n(Photo: Getty Images)",
