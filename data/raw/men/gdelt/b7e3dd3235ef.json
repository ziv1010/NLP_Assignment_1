In Serbian, though, their proper club name is Crvena zvezda.\nDrawn into Group G of the Champions League, Crvena zvezda will face Manchester City, RB Leipzig and Young Boys across six games as they look to progress to the knockout stages of the competition.\nQualifying for the competition after winning their sixth consecutive title in the Serbian SuperLiga, Crvena zvezda went unbeaten in the league in 2022/23. However, they failed to reach the group stages of the Champions League after losing in the third qualifying round against Armenian side Pyunik.\nStill, treble holders Manchester City aren't taking their opponents lightly. Pep Guardiola demands his players show them the same level of respect they'd expect, while also setting a high bar for them to achieve.\n\"Every season we start the competition in the first game with the target to win the first game, then the group stage, then try to win the Champions League,\" Pep Guardiola said.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\n\"Nothing changes from before. The same for Red Star tomorrow [Tuesday]. It depends on our performance and our level. We're incredibly happy to defend this crown but this competition doesn't allow you mistakes.\n\"But always we were so strong at home, nine points from nine. When that happens you can win just one game away and you qualify. Tomorrow is the first step.\"\nMore Manchester City and Champions League stories\nErling Haaland's agent has addressed 'strange' speculation linking the Norwegian with a move to Real Madrid.\nMeanwhile, it has been reported that the striker has a release clause, which could see him leave City next summer.\nRyan is a staff writer for FourFourTwo, joining the team full-time in October 2022.
