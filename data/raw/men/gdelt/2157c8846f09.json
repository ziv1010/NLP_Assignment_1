Adblock might get confused so please disable it if you have any issues.\nIs Sports Betting Legal in Europe?\nThe legality of sports betting in Europe is complex. There is no single body regulating gambling throughout the continent, so it’s up to each individual country to regulate and legalize it within its own jurisdiction.\nCurrently, around half of the countries in Europe have legalised sports betting in some form, either through land-based or online betting. Some European countries — like the UK, Italy, and Spain — have fully regulated markets with licensed private operators.\nOthers have state-run monopolies, while many are still in the process of updating or refining their gambling laws.\nRegardless of where you’re located in Europe, access to sports betting is rarely out of reach. There are plenty of offshore sportsbooks and international betting sites, so you’ve still got plenty of ways to jump in on the action.\nWhere Can I Bet on Sports in Europe?\nThere are tons of online gambling sites that accept players from all over the continent, such as those we’ve highlighted above.\nThese European betting sites all excel in terms of betting odds, bonuses, and market variety. Stick around for our reviews below as we outline their highlights.\n1. MyStake – Best European Betting Site Overall\nPros:\n- Intuitive bet builder tool\n- 120% sports betting welcome bonus\n- Incredibly detailed EPL betting coverage\n- 50% horse racing cashback\n- 6000+ casino games\nCons:\n- Not the most intuitive desktop layout\n- 10x welcome bonus rollover\nAt the top of our list of European sportsbooks, we find MyStake. It greets all players with a stunning welcome bonus and features some awesome live betting tools on a fantastic web-based mobile app.\nMarket Selection: 5/5\nUK customers (and players from all over Europe, in fact) will love the particularly strong coverage of the English Premier League and other top European football betting leagues.\nEvery match offers the option to bet on hundreds of prop bets, from correct score bets to whether a team will hit the crossbar or post, making this the best sports betting site in Europe for gambling variety.\nThe same can be said for many leagues within many sports, actually. The detailed market coverage extends into the virtual domain, too. Esports are covered very well, with odds on tournaments from less common games available, like Rocket League and Arena of Valor.\nLive Betting: 4.8/5\nMyStake has some of the best live betting tools in the business, with live graphics for most of the events (and even the occasional live stream!), rapid cashouts, and quickly updated odds for in-play bets.\nWe’re also big fans of the bet builder tool offered by the best betting site in Europe, which allows you to create your own betting combinations in exciting and unique ways – a great feature that makes it stand out even more among other top EU sports betting sites.\nBonuses & Promotions: 5/5\nRight now, you can get a strong 120% matched deposit of up to €600 when you make your first deposit at MyStake. That’s a great amount of cash to boost your bankroll as a new customer!\nPerhaps the rollover is a little high at 10x, but we still think that’s more than reasonable considering the size of the bonus.\nThere are plenty of extras to check out at this EU sports betting site, including a 35% sports reload bonus and a 3 + 1 free bet.\nEuropean Country Availability: 4.8/5\n- Germany\n- Poland\n- UK\n- Romania\n- France\n- Sweden\n- Finland\n2.

Freshbet – Best Bonuses of All EU Sports Betting Sites\nPros:\n- 3 + 1 free bet offer\n- €500 welcome bonus\n- Engaging user interface\n- Super responsive live chat support\n- Instant payouts with crypto\nCons:\n- Limited mobile compatibility\n- Not many non-sports markets\nSports betting bonuses help you maximise your bankroll at the minimum cost, and Freshbet has got that side of things down to a tee.\nMarket Selection: 4.8/5\nAs expected from one of the best European betting sites, we found a wide range of sports to bet on at Freshbet, with everything from football to hurling and even online cricket betting available, as well as tons of markets for big games like the Super Bowl and Champions League Final.\nThat said, the amount of markets doesn’t quite extend to regular-season games, but most players will still be more than satisfied with the range of choice here.\nAlso, if you can’t wait for the next big football fixture – you can check out some of the virtual sports at Freshbet, a great feature not a lot of European bookmakers offer.\nLive Betting: 4.7/5\nThe Freshbet live graphics aren’t the most detailed, but they do look decent, as does the rest of the site.\nWe should also note that there are an impressive 14 payment methods available at Freshbet. Many of these are cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Litecoin. Plus, if you want to withdraw with Bitcoin, you can get paid out almost instantly – it’s one of the best crypto betting sites out there.\nWe have to note that the mobile experience on Freshbet isn’t as strong as on some other EU betting sites listed here.\nBonuses & Promotions: 5/5\nYou’ll be able to start your European online betting site bonus journey with a neat 100% match deposit up to €500, just like MyStake. A great start.\nThe welcome bonus is just the tip of the iceberg, though, as the bonus cash keeps on flowing from this point.\nFor example, there’s an ongoing 3 + 1 free bet offer for all players, a 10% loyalty cashback offer and chances to get boosted odds on certain fixtures.\nEuropean Country Availability: 4.7/5\n- Spain\n- UK\n- Slovenia\n- Norway\n- Czechia\n- Italy\n- France\n4. DonBet – Best European Online Bookmaker for Market Variety\nPros:\n- 45+ sports to bet on\n- Thousands of daily markets\n- Covers classic & niche sports\n- Dedicated promos for different sports\n- €600 welcome bonus\nCons:\n- Design is not the best\n- Could use more banking methods\nThe top European sports betting sites feature a wide range of international betting markets, allowing players to explore new sports and see exciting new sides of the online sports betting world. And there’s no better place for that than Donbet.\nMarket Selection: 4.8/5\nLet’s get this out of the way – you won’t find more in-depth European online betting market coverage anywhere else. Boasting an impressive lineup of over 45 sports, coupled with thousands of daily markets, DonBet is a true giant when it comes to variety.\nWhether you want to bet on soccer, American football, baseball, or tennis, DonBet caters to all mainstream sports enthusiasts. For those after lesser-known sports, DonBet offers online sports betting in Europe on niche options like squash and darts.\nMoreover, for eSports fans, this EU bookmaker has a dedicated library featuring popular games like Dota 2 and League of Legends, among many others.

Then you should have a look at Jackbit.\nMarket Selection: 4.8/5\nJackbit offers odds on a wide variety of European betting markets.\nThey cover all sorts of markets within individual matches, like the number of yellow cards in a football match or the number of unforced errors for a particular player in a tennis game.\nJackbit truly excels in its esports betting offerings. Not only can you bet extensively on the big esports games such as League of Legends and Dota 2, but you’ll also be able to get odds on some less popular options like Valorant.\nLive Betting: 4.9/5\nThe Jackbit desktop website may initially seem a bit cluttered, but once you get the hang of it, navigation becomes straightforward. However, for an even smoother experience, we prefer the sleek and intuitive interface of the mobile version.\nWe’re especially impressed with the live betting tools. They maintain the same minimal yet user-friendly design, making it easy to place bets in real time.\nBonuses & Promotions: 4.4/5\nNew members can take advantage of the 3+1 FreeBet offer, where after placing three bets, the fourth bet is granted for free.\nBeyond the welcome offer, this European bookmaker online also offers a 10% rakeback and several other ongoing promotions, making it stand out from many other EU sports betting sites.\nIn addition, we found that this online sportsbook also very often posts different types of exclusive promotions. For example, as one of the best sports betting sites in Europe, it had a dedicated promotion for the UEFA EURO 2024!\nEuropean Country Availability: 4.9/5\n- Germany\n- Italy\n- Spain\n- Finland\n- France\n- Norway\n- Sweden\nTop Bookmakers Online in Europe – Our Ranking Criteria\nBetting Markets\nIt’s crucial that we see betting coverage for a lot of sports and a lot of tournaments and leagues within those sports at the top EU betting sites. But equally as important is that there are plenty of things to bet on for each game or match, not just 1×2 betting on their final outcome.\nOh, and if you’re looking to play some casino games in between placing bets on your favourite sports, make sure to check out our reviews of the best online casinos in Europe.\nProfitable Odds\nOne key factor that we considered when choosing the best European sports betting sites was the quality of the odds offered.\nEuropean bookies we’ve picked excel in this benchmark, given that they boast competitive odds in major European sports leagues — this ensures that you’re able to win more each time you place a bet on Euro games and matches.\nBonuses & Promotions\nOne of the most exciting things about EU sports betting sites is that they offer all sorts of free bets, matched deposits and more. The more of these, the better! But it’s also key that the terms and conditions don’t make any winnings too difficult to withdraw.\nSome of the best EU betting sites we’ve featured have special bonuses for different sports, like dedicated horse racing betting promos, football bonuses, eSports offers, and much more.\nLicensing and Reputation\nThe best European bookmakers didn’t just randomly rise to the top — these safe betting sites are licensed and have gained a reputation for the quality of the services they provide.\nSo, you don’t need to worry about dealing with shady EU betting sites when gambling at our top picks, as their licensing and reputation make them exceptional European betting companies.\nLive Betting\nMany of the best European betting sites are offering live betting tools these days, but some of them are better than others. Plus, we want to see great bet slip functions, mobile apps and more. We also considered bet limits to ensure comfortable betting – many of our top picks are high-limit European betting sites, ensuring the best experience.\nEuropean Country Eligibility\nSome European online bookmakers are available in more countries than others. Of course, we’ve tried to pick sites that have maximum availability in order to give them the most points for this category.\nBy following this criteria, we managed to find the top sports betting sites in the European betting market. We also used similar benchmarks when ranking the best TX sportsbooks, and even applied them in niche markets like Maryland.\nHow To Sign Up at the Best European Sports Betting Sites\nReady to get started at the best European betting sites online?\nAll you need to do to sign up for a European sportsbook is carry out four simple steps. We’re going to show you how to do this using MyStake for reference, but the process should be pretty similar for most online bookies.\n1. Complete the Registration Form\n- Take a look at our list of EU betting sites\n- Pick your favourite – we recommend MyStake\n- Navigate to the MyStake homepage or choose another betting site\n- Press the red “Register” button\n- Complete the details in the pop-up window\n- Tick to agree to the terms and that you’re 18+\n2. Confirm Your Email\n- Go to your email inbox\n- Click the link from the online sportsbook to confirm your email\n- You will be redirected back to the betting site\n3. Make Your First Deposit\n- Open the cashier section\n- Pick your preferred payment method\n- Choose a deposit amount\n- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the transaction\n4. Place Some Sports Bets\n- Find your favourite sport in the sportsbook\n- Pick a market and a betting amount\n- Bet on your favourite sports using European bookmakers\nEurope Betting Sites vs. Betting Shops: Which Are Better?\nThere are cases to be made for both European sports betting sites and retail betting, but we believe the former has a lot more going for it these days.\n- Live betting on international sports: Betting on sports live is one of the most immersive ways to get involved, but what if you want to do this for a match on the other side of the world when the retail stores at home are closed? Well, at the leading European betting sites, you can still do so online!\n- Mobile sports betting: There’s no need to take too much time out of your day if you bet on your smartphone at European online betting sites. Place futures or live bets on the go and check in to see the results regardless of your location through mobile sports betting apps.\n- More generous bonuses: The EU betting sites market is very competitive, so the online bookies themselves are constantly trying to bring in new customers by offering lucrative sportsbook bonuses. That’s just not going to happen so much on the high street, if at all.\n- Competitive odds: Something a lot of people don’t know is that you’re typically going to get better odds if you choose online European bookies. That’s for the same reason the bonuses are better: there’s just more competition in the online domain.\nBest European Betting Sites By Sport\nSure, each European sports betting site that we’ve listed covers the most popular sports, but some stand out, especially when it comes to odds and betting markets.\nHere’s a brief breakdown of the top betting sites for each sport:\nFootball\nWhen it comes to European football betting, you won’t find a better site for the sport than Mystake. It doesn’t just cover the top 5 leagues but also features deep market coverage in other niche tournaments and lesser-known leagues across Europe and beyond.\nTennis\nWhether you’re betting on a Grand Slam or a challenger event, the sports betting Europe site that covers tennis the best is Goldenbet. It covers all ATP and WTA events, and its superb live betting setup adds even more ways to get in on the action. We’ve also highlighted other top tennis betting sites in this guide.\nBasketball\nBettors interested in European basketball betting can head over to Freshbet, which doesn’t just focus on the EuroLeague and major national competitions.\nThis platform also delivers extensive market coverage for smaller leagues and international tournaments, so there will always be something for hoops fans to bet on, regardless of the time or season.\nHorse Racing\nBeyond delivering the most popular sports on the continent, Mystake solidifies its spot as one of the best online betting sites Europe has to offer by featuring one of the most feature-rich racebooks.\nIt covers hundreds of tracks — including favourites like Epsom, Chelmsford, Market Rasen, and Cheltenham — offers regularly updated odds, and even gives bettors the option to catch a few live streams.\nFormula 1\nMoving on to a different type of racing, and when it comes to the site that delivers comprehensive sports coverage in Formula 1, we have a photo finish between Mystake and Freshbet.\nBoth have similarly competitive odds and offer many of the same markets, covering everything from outright winners to fastest lap bets. So it may come down to which interface or bonus offer you prefer.\nBonuses Offered by Top Online Bookmakers in Europe\nWelcome Bonuses\nThe first deposit match is the most important offer at every EU sportsbook. You fund your new account, and the site multiplies that amount with bonus funds. Be sure to check the key terms, like which payment methods and deposit amounts qualify, the wagering requirements, minimum odds, and time limits, so you know exactly what’s needed to make the most of the offer.\nNo-Deposit Bonuses\nHere, the site credits a very small balance, often just a few euros, after you verify your email or phone number. You won’t risk your own money, but don’t expect a big payout either. It’s mostly useful for testing the interface, payout speed, or odds quality before deciding whether the site’s worth a real deposit.\nFree Bets\nFree bets let you wager with the bookmaker’s money, keeping only the winnings if your bet is successful. You won’t get the stake amount back, just the profit. These are often given after placing qualifying bets or as part of ongoing promos.\nReload Bonuses\nReload bonuses are like mini welcome offers for returning players at online European bookies. You deposit on specified days or during certain promos, and the site boosts your deposit by a smaller percentage. It’s a great way to stay engaged without needing to start fresh.\nCashback and Bet Insurance\nCashback gives you a percentage of your losses back, typically every week, while bet insurance refunds a single losing wager. The refund might come as real cash or a bonus you’ll need to wager again. These offers are designed to soften the impact of bad runs and give you a second shot.\nLoyalty and VIP Programs\nThese programs reward regular play with points that unlock different tiers or perks. As you move up, you might access faster payouts, better bonuses, dedicated support, and invites to exclusive events. Some sportsbooks also offer monthly cashback or personalized promos, making them worthwhile if you bet frequently.\nTop European Betting Apps In 2025\nThese days, more and more sports bettors are choosing to swap their desktop computers for their smartphone to place their bets. As a result, many European betting sites are putting more focus on the design of their mobile betting apps.\nAll of our top 10 European betting sites have fantastic mobile sites or even downloadable mobile apps to elevate the mobile sports betting experience even further. However, three of them are better than the rest for mobile bettors. Here’s a look at those three.\nMyStake – 120% Matched Deposit Up to €600\n- Amazing mobile bet builder tool\n- Over 1500 daily football betting markets\n- 50% horse betting cashback\nDespite not actually having a downloadable mobile app, MyStake is our joint-favourite mobile sports betting site and the best sportsbook in Europe overall. It’s so well-designed that you’ll barely even notice that you’re not actually using a standalone piece of software.\nBut the best thing about it is probably the live betting. MyStake’s mobile live betting is just about the best among top European bookies, as the tools are super fast and fun to use. You can use them to explore an immense range of sports betting markets (particularly for football!) too.\nGoldenBet – €500 Welcome Bonus\n- 2000+ daily betting markets\n- Special bonuses for different sports\n- On-site live streams available\nOur second top mobile sports betting app in Europe is GoldenBet. The key reason why it ranked so high is the excellent live betting interface featuring on-site live streams.\nThis EU bookmaker also comes with some of the best bonuses we could find out there – make sure to activate your €500 welcome bonus once you sign up for a new account, and don’t forget to check out other promos as well.\nAs one of the best EU betting sites, it offers an excellent mobile betting experience, which is a huge advantage.\nFreshbet – 100% Matched Deposit Up to €500\n- Only €20 welcome bonus minimum deposit\n- Fantastic live betting tools on mobile site\n- Competitive odds for cashing out sports bets\nComing up next, we have Freshbet – one of the leading online bookmakers in Europe when it comes to bonuses.\nOnce again, Freshbet doesn’t have a mobile app to download, but that’s not an issue as the mobile site is pretty much impeccable. This European betting app has opted for a super modern and minimal theme that makes it really easy to use, no matter the size of your screen.\nYou can use the mobile site to trigger any of the brilliant Freshbet bonus offers or to check out several of the live streams or graphics for the wide range of sporting events they offer odds on. You can also cash out your bets at the touch of a button and for competitive odds. We love it!\nEuropean Betting Sites – FAQ\nCan You Bet Online in Europe?\nYou can legally bet online in most countries throughout Europe. So whether you’re in the UK, Germany, Italy, or somewhere else, you can check out the best betting sites listed in this guide.\nThere are laws and sports betting rules to consider, though, and they vary from country to country. These include a minimum legal age, minimum and maximum payment amounts, and not being able to sign up for more than one account.\nIf you’re instead wondering about the legalization status in states like Florida or how things stand in the New York sports betting market, check out our detailed guides on both.\nWhat is the Best Betting Site in Europe?\n- MyStake: Best overall\n- GoldenBet: Best for live betting\n- Freshbet: Generous welcome bonus\n- DonBet: 45+ sports to bet on\n- Jackbit: Fastest payouts\nThe best betting site in Europe is MyStake. It has everything you need in terms of bonus offers, various markets, and competitive betting odds.\nWhat is the Safest Online Betting Site?\nWe found the safest betting site to be MyStake, as this EU bookmaker has the best site security, fantastic customer support, and great user reviews on public review platforms like Trustpilot.\nBut then again, you could say the same about the rest of our top European betting sites, including DonBet and Jackbit.\nWhich Payment Methods Can I Use at European Betting Sites?\nYou can use credit cards, e-wallets, bank transfers, and cryptocurrencies at most European betting sites.\nPayment options vary by site and country, but Visa, Mastercard, Skrill, Neteller, and bank transfers are widely accepted. Many sportsbooks also support Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Tether for faster, anonymous transactions. Just be sure to check which methods are eligible for bonuses, as some may be excluded.\nCan I Use a VPN with European Bookmakers?\nYes, you will be able to use most European bookmakers with a VPN. If you’re able to open the page and start the sign-up process while using it, that’s already a good sign.\nHowever, whether you’ll be able to use a VPN to place bets at European bookmakers largely depends on the T&Cs set by the site.\nThe best route is to pick a European bookmaker that operates in your country of residence. We’ve featured quite a few that operate throughout Europe, so regardless of where you’re based, there should still be a sports betting site that accepts European bettors within your jurisdiction.\nEU Betting Sites vs. International Bookmakers\nWe’re pretty confident that Europe is the best continent on Earth in regard to sports betting, and there are a few key reasons for that. Here’s a look at what the European betting sites have over the rest of the world.\nWide Country Availability: It’s legal to bet on sports across most of Europe, and the laws are fairly relaxed in most countries too. For example, you only need to be 18 years old to bet on sports online in most European countries, compared to 21 in the US.\nAwesome Bonuses: More often than not, European sportsbooks absolutely throw the kitchen sink at their welcome offers, and this means we players are going to be able to get tons of free bets, matched deposits, and more no matter which sportsbook we sign up for.\nReasonable Terms & Conditions: You might think that lucrative bonuses like these would have pretty strict terms and conditions attached to them, but this doesn’t tend to be the case. Many European betting site offers have low rollovers and fair minimum deposit requirements.\nFantastic Customer Support: The level of support amongst European sportsbooks is generally very good. We’ve not come across many online bookies in the continent that don’t offer a live chat function at least.\nThousands of Markets: Last but definitely not least, we’ve also noticed that the market depth amongst European betting sites is second to none. Because there’s so much competition between the online bookies, they need to have a lot of content to bring in customers.\nTips & Tricks for Using Top International Sports Betting Sites\nCheck for Country Restrictions\nYou won’t be able to use all our top 10 sports betting sites in every country in Europe. Each of them has its own restrictions, so be sure to check if a site is available in your country before you start creating an account.\nSign Up for Multiple Online Betting Sites\nThe more European betting sites you sign up for, the more welcome bonuses you’re going to be able to claim. So, why not sign up for a few of our top 10 online gambling picks and enjoy some awesome matched deposits and free bets?\nRead the Bonus Terms\nMake sure to look at the terms and conditions for any bonus you’re interested in, no matter which Europe betting site you use. You’ll need to be familiar with these so that you don’t miss anything and end up voiding your winnings at European sportsbooks.\nAll the best European sports betting sites often include terms like rollovers, time limits, and payment method restrictions.\nLearn the Odds Conversions\nMost European bettors, and therefore most EU betting sites, use the decimal odds format. But you might also find sports betting operators that operate solely in British (fractional) odds or American (moneyline) odds, so it could be worth learning how to convert between them.\nWhether you’re placing a European bet or exploring international online bookmakers, knowing how to read different odds formats can really come in handy.\nShop Around for Odds\nOne of the best things about European gambling sites is that a lot of them have very competitive odds. But some online bookies specialise in particular sports, so be sure to find out which are best for your favourites by using odds comparison sites.\nLook for Responsible Online Gambling Tools\nYou may think that your online sports betting is under control, but it’s always better to be prepared.\nSo, at least make note of the responsible gambling tools at your disposal when using European bookmakers, like deposit limits and time check-ins, just in case you ever have to use them.\nSo, What Are the Best Bookies Online in Europe?\nEuropean betting sites are better than ever right now. They’re packed with amazing markets, and the odds are ultra-competitive. Plus, many of them are offering awesome bonuses to new players!\nThe best site that gets all of that right and more is MyStake. But you could pretty much say the same thing about the rest of our top picks. Therefore, nothing’s stopping you from exploring a few of these options and grabbing some fantastic welcome offers.\nNo matter which EU online gambling site you pick, just make sure that you always gamble responsibly.\nDISCLAIMER: The information on this site is for entertainment purposes only.
