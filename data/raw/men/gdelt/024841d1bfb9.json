A strong Madrid line-up ultimately had to rely on a penalty, an own goal and a lucky Kylian Mbappe strike to reach the next round, and the game’s closing stages were tense.\nAdvertisement\nTalavera resisted their illustrious opponents and pushed back hard in search of a dramatic late leveller. When the final whistle came, Alonso looked mightily relieved. He stayed sitting in the dugout for a few seconds and appeared to say to himself: “Ay, la hostia”. Bloody hell.\nHis position as manager is not secure. As The Athletic reported this week, Madrid would prefer to keep him as long as results allow, but the margin for error is almost non-existent.\nHere, our Real Madrid correspondents Mario Cortegana and Guillermo Rai discuss Alonso’s situation at the Bernabeu.\nThe information contained in this article reflects multiple conversations with various sources at Madrid, all of whom wanted to speak anonymously to protect relationships.\nWhy is Xabi Alonso under so much pressure?\nMario Cortegana: At Real Madrid, the style and demand has always been to win above all, and Alonso is not achieving results.\nIn just over a month, Madrid went from enjoying a five-point lead over Barcelona to trailing them by four points. They could slip to third place in La Liga if Villarreal win their two games in hand. In the Champions League, they are still seventh but have lost ground with defeats at Liverpool and at home to Manchester City.\nBehind all this, there have been problems in connecting with the players, who have not understood or assimilated Alonso’s footballing ideas. The club is very concerned about the lack of quality and control shown in almost every match since the 2-1 Clasico win of October 26. They do not think that only Alonso is at fault, but at Madrid, the manager is the one who takes the blame, with very few exceptions.\nGuillermo Rai: After six months in the job, Madrid have not improved their style of play. If anything, the team’s performance has deteriorated as the season has progressed. With the exception of a few cases, such as Mbappe, the system isn’t getting the best out of key players like Federico Valverde, Jude Bellingham or Vinicius Junior.\nAdvertisement\nBut the main reason is always the results. Alonso started with a positive run, winning 12 of the first 13 games this term. However, after the City defeat, he had won only two from eight, and that is what put him in a really difficult position.\nDo you think Real Madrid will sack him?\nGuillermo: There is an old mantra at Madrid: “Results come first.” That’s why I think that, if Madrid were to lose again on Saturday, Alonso and his team would be sacked, even if the 2-1 win over Alaves last weekend bought them time.\nIf they survive through the next couple of games, the Supercopa de Espana in Saudi Arabia will provide a tougher test. They play Atletico Madrid in the semi-final on January 8 and would likely meet Barcelona in the final.\nMario: I think Madrid will sack Alonso, and it’s a real pity because I’m still convinced that he was the best option to take the job after Carlo Ancelotti. But results are what matter the most at Madrid, and I don’t feel that the team is in a dynamic to turn the situation around.\nWe have been reporting that Madrid’s board, and especially chief executive Jose Angel Sanchez, who was the main supporter of Alonso’s appointment, want to keep the coach as long as results allow. Some media outlets in Spain have presented a line of information and opinion that I do not share, which boils down to Madrid just waiting for an excuse to sack him.\nIf that were the case, the defeat against City, another bad result in a big game — and, what’s more, at the Santiago Bernabeu — would have served that purpose. So would have the hard-fought victories against Alaves or Talavera, who are in the relegation zone of their division in Spain’s regionalised third tier.\nBut still, even if Alonso and the players continue to buy time by winning against Sevilla on Saturday, and against Real Betis when La Liga returns from its winter break on January 4, I do not see the team stepping up in the Supercopa against Atletico or then potentially Barcelona.\nAdvertisement\nThese are two rivals that are very demanding, and losing does a lot of damage in the eyes of the board. The club has already felt disappointed with the team’s weaknesses under Alonso in big games, El Clasico aside.\nCan he still turn things around and how?\nMario: I don’t think so. It seems clear that Alonso is not finding the right formula, no matter how much he has tried and tested things. In recent games, Madrid’s success has often come down to Thibaut Courtois’ goalkeeping and Mbappe’s goalscoring.\nThe most convincing Madrid, or at least the most promising, was the one at the Club World Cup. But since then, the team seems to have gradually abandoned what it was attempting: high pressure, good care of the ball, focus on building from the back.\nIt’s curious, because Alonso has been distancing himself from this period in press conferences, arguing that he considers it to be more the end of the previous project than the beginning of his own.\nSince the visit to Olympiacos in Greece at the end of November, Alonso has been making concessions to the team, including lightening the amount of tactical analysis they were asked to engage in. That had been one of the points of tension among the group. It was also interesting to see the so-called Fantastic Four (Mbappe, Vinicius Jr, Jude Bellingham and Rodrygo) all start against Alaves, for the first time under Alonso.\nGuillermo: Some voices at the club still call for continuity, but what Madrid really need is a string of victories. In theory, they could emerge stronger by overcoming the challenges now facing them, but they really don’t have time on their side.\nWhat’s the fan view from the Bernabeu?\nGuillermo: In the Champions League defeat by Manchester City, home supporters made it clear they feel Xabi Alonso is not the only one to blame. Some were even more critical of some players, such as Vinicius Jr, who was repeatedly booed and jeered.\nAdvertisement\nOn the whole, a change of manager is not seen as the only solution, but what really exists is an urgent desire for Madrid to convey something more. The disappointment of Ancelotti’s last season has extended into the Alonso era.\nMario: The Athletic’s report at the end of October, revealing internal tensions among the dressing room and some senior players’ opposition to Alonso’s methods, opened a debate that is still running. Fans are disappointed with Alonso, but also with the players — increasingly so.\nI have to say that I sense a somewhat numb Bernabeu. A few years ago, a run of results like the current one would have provoked much greater anger. And I don’t perceive the same degree of discontent among Madrid fans on social media or in groups of friends and WhatsApp chats as I do in the stadium.\nWhat do you think about potential replacements?\nGuillermo: Zinedine Zidane is the only safe bet for me. However, people close to him say he is hoping to lead the France national team after the World Cup. I’m also not sure if he would accept a Madrid team that is missing pieces such as an organising midfielder. The last time he left Madrid, in 2021, he complained precisely about the squad planning.\nI don’t believe Zidane would guarantee the team playing better, but I would expect a better atmosphere around the dressing room and for Madrid’s best individuals to improve.\nAs for options, Alvaro Arbeloa is the most talked about at Valdebebas. He might have a better understanding of the club’s idiosyncrasies, but I don’t see him as better than Alonso or a significant change for this team.\nMario: There is a certain consensus within the club that it would be difficult for a new manager to fix the current situation, as there are deep-rooted problems. At the same time, there is unanimity that results are what matter and that if a decision has to be made, the weakest link is the manager.\nAdvertisement\nMadrid have been considering a potential replacement for Alonso for weeks. As we have reported, the name that is being mentioned most often and with the most force is Arbeloa, who is having a great season at Real Madrid Castilla, the club’s reserve team. They are fourth in their division in Spain’s third tier.\nThere are people within the club, and with good connections to the hierarchy, who suggest we should not completely forget the name of Zidane, but almost as a dream scenario rather than with any certainty that there will be a move for him. They point to the special relationship between president Florentino Perez and the Frenchman.\nAlso, there are voices within the club who view Santiago Solari as a favourable option, and have even tried to promote his candidacy.\nThe 49-year-old former Argentina international was promoted from Castilla to replace Julen Lopetegui as manager for a few months between 2018 and 2019. He was dismissed due to a lack of results but remained at the club because Perez, in particular, valued his commitment and courage.\nHe then left to coach abroad and since his return to the Bernabeu in 2022, he has been on a rollercoaster ride. He struggled to find his place, but ended up becoming important with Ancelotti. However, according to multiple sources at Valdebebas, since Alonso’s arrival he has lost influence in day-to-day matters and is more focused on representing the club in different contexts.\nThere have been plenty of rumours pointing to Jurgen Klopp, too. He was already linked before Alonso’s arrival in May. However, sources close to the German told The Athletic that he is very happy and focused on his work as head of global football for the Red Bull group.",
