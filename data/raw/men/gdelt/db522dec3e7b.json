Their list of setbacks had almost reached embarrassing lengths but their defeat to Real Madrid in midweek - no disgrace in itself but another capitulation from a winning position inside the final five minutes - has further sapped morale from a side who look listless right now.\nNewcastle, by contrast, are flying high. Their remarkable run of Premier League form may have stuttered a little of late, as they lost their last time out against Fulham, but the Magpies are in the final of the Carabao Cup with the chance to win a first trophy since 1955.\nTo get there, Newcastle had to get past Arsenal, but they made it look easy, winning 2-0 away from home in the first leg of the semi-final before repeating the feat at St James’ Park in the second leg. The club are on a high and, with Alexander Isak looking like one of the best players in the world right now, can threaten anyone.\nCity may well have a few nerves as Newcastle’s fast-paced attack comes flying at them. Pep Guardiola’s men have struggled badly in defence of late, and despite their pedigree it’s hard to see them keeping a clean sheet, even at home. Going forward, they remain a huge threat, with an abundance of creative quality and a top striker in Erling Harland, who just keeps the goals flowing.\nThis is a clash with a lot at stake in terms of the Premier League table and Champions League qualification. City may have given up on their title defence but they sit down in fifth, one place below the qualification spots. Newcastle are right behind them, effectively right beside them, on the same number of points (41) and with the same goal difference (+13), but separated only by goals scored.\nManchester City vs Newcastle: Team News\nMan City’s defensive woes have deepened given the expected absence of Manuel Akanji, who suffered a muscle injury against Real Madrid in mid-week. Nathan Ake is back fit again and could come into the defence, with Rico Lewis or Matheus Nunes other options at Guardiola’s disposal.\nJack Grealish is also a doubt after the Real Madrid game, but there are a fair few candidates for the wide positions, including Jeremy Dock, who is recently back from an injury of his own.\nNewcastle have a few minor doubts, and will be hoping Anthony Gordon’s thigh strain and Joelinton’s knee problem won’t get in the way of them starting today. Dan Burn and Sven Bowman have also been identified as doubts. Harvey Barnes and Jamaal Lascelles remain sidelined with long-term injuries.\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example: 1.
