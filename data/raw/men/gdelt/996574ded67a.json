  "body_text": "The Champions League and Europa League games you need to watch in Gameweek 2\n- European football is back this midweek\n- Champions League and Europa League games will be played\n- Man Utd and Arsenal are in action\nGameweek 2 of the UEFA Champions League and Europa League is upon us this week, and the new format has thrown up plenty of fun games for us to enjoy.\nFrom games that promise to be high-scoring affairs (Stuttgart vs Sparta Prague), to heavyweight clashes (Arsenal vs PSG), to European Cup final rematches (Aston Villa vs Bayern Munich), we have a bit of everything in store this week.\nHere's our viewing guide for the next few days to help you pick which games to watch.\nYou're welcome.\nStuttgart vs Sparta Prague\nWhen? Tuesday 1 October, 17:45 BST / 12:45 ET / 09:45 PT\nStuttgart vs Sparta Prague isn't exactly a heavyweight clash, we'll give you that, but that doesn't mean it won't be a fun time.\nAs a general rule of thumb in 2024/25 so far, when Stuttgart play, it's a fun time.\nIn their nine games so far this season, a whopping 42 goals have been scored by either Stuttgart or their opposition. That's 4.6 goals per game.\nSo if you want to see some goals, this is the game to watch.\nArsenal vs Paris Saint-Germain\nWhen? Tuesday 1 October, 20:00 BST / 15:00 ET / 12:00 PT\nWith Bayer Leverkusen vs AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund vs Celtic and Arsenal vs Paris Saint-Germain all set to kick off at the same time, picking a game to watch on Tuesday evening may prove to be tricky.\nSo long as you pick one of those three, you'll be on to a winner.\nWe'll be watching Arsenal's meeting with PSG at the Emirates Stadium because it could be a preview of a game in the latter stages of the competition. With both teams hellbent on finally winning their first-ever Champions League this season, don't be too surprised to see this fixture crop up again in the semi-finals.\nShakhtar Donetsk vs Atalanta\nWhen? Wednesday 2 October, 17:45 BST / 12:45 ET / 09:45 PT\nLook, to be perfectly honest, it's pretty slim pickings when it comes to the early kick-offs. The choices are Shakhtar Donetsk vs Atalanta or Girona vs Feyenoord.\nIt's not exactly awe inspiring.\nAtalanta's trip to Gelsenkirchen - Shakhtar are playing their European games in Germany this season for obvious reasons - is the more appealing of the two, largely because the Bergamo side are a joy to watch on their day.\nAston Villa vs Bayern Munich\nWhen? Wednesday 2 October, 20:00 BST / 15:00 ET / 12:00 PT\nThe last time these two clubs faced off against one another in the Champions League/European Cup was way back in 1982, in the final of competition.\nOn that occasion, Aston Villa ran out surprising 1-0 winners thanks to a now legendary goal from Peter Wilthe.\nIt'll be very interesting to see if they can repeat the trick 42 years later against an in-form, Harry Kane-led Bayern Munich team in what promises to be a raucous Villa Park.\nFerencvaros vs Tottenham Hotspur\nWhen? Thursday 3 October, 17:45 BST / 12:45 ET / 09:45 PT\nTottenham were absolutely outstanding at Old Trafford on Sunday, putting Man Utd to the sword in a statement 3-0 win.\nIf they play in a similar fashion against Ferencvaros, this game could be well worth a watch.\nThere's few better things in football than Ange-ball in full flow.\nFC Porto vs Man Utd\nWhen? Thursday 3 October, 20:00 BST / 15:00 ET / 12:00 PT\nAfter a 23rd game in which his Man Utd side conceded three or more goals at the weekend, and the club's third defeat in six Premier League games in 2024/25 already, there's a world in which the trip to Porto will be Erik ten Hag's last European game in charge at the club.\nThe manager is in dire need of a win on Thursday evening.",
