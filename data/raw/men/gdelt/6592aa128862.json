However, a 7-2 aggregate defeat by PSV Eindhoven (1-4 a, 1-3 h) sent them into the Europa League group stage.\nThe victory at Raków last time out was only Sturm's third in their last 18 matches in European competition (D4 L11).\nAtalanta\nThis will be Atalanta's first meeting against a team from Austria in UEFA competition.\nLast season was Atalanta's first without European football in five years after they had finished eighth in Serie A in 2021/22. However, they are now returning for just their second appearance in the Europa League group stage after ending the 2022/23 campaign fifth in the Italian top flight.\nAtalanta's previous Europa League appearance, two seasons ago, took them as far as the quarter-finals after they had transferred from the UEFA Champions League group stage. Victories in the knockout play-off round against Olympiacos (2-1 h, 3-0 a) and the round of 16 against Bayer Leverkusen (3-2 h, 1-0 a) set up a last-eight game against Leipzig but, after a 1-1 first-leg draw in Germany, two Christopher Nkunku goals in Bergamo ended the Italian side's hopes.\nLa Dea's only previous Europa League group stage appearance was in 2017/18 when they topped their section in convincing fashion, winning four and drawing two of their six games, including a 5-1 win against Everton at Goodison Park. However, their run was cut short in the round of 32 by Borussia Dortmund (2-3 a, 1-1 h).\nAtalanta ended the following season's Europa League in the second qualifying round, beating Sarajevo 10-2 on aggregate and defeating Hapoel Haifa 6-1 in the third qualifying round before losing 4-2 on penalties to Copenhagen after two goalless draws in the qualifying play-offs.\nHaving not won any of their first seven games away from home in Europe (D2 L5), Atalanta have lost just two of their last 14 on the road (W7 D5).\nLinks and trivia\nHas played in Italy:\nDavid Schnegg (Venezia 2021/22, Crotone 2022 loan)\nAtalanta's Emil Holm scored his first international goal for Sweden on 12 September in a 3-1 defeat against Austria.\nInternational team-mates:\nAmadou Dante and El Bilal Touré (Mali)\nJusuf Gazibegović & Sead Kolašinac (Bosnia and Herzegovina)\nGregory Wüthrich & Berat Djimsiti (Switzerland youth)\nKjell Scherpen & Mitchel Bakker (Netherlands youth)",
