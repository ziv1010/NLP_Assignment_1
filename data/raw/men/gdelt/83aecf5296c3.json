It’s never been as hard to end up top four or top five in the Premier League.\n“In my opinion, it’s a really difficult league because that’s what I’ve experienced over here. There has never been an easy game. It has always been really hard to win a game of football, but maybe that tells you something about us.”\nLiverpool has won 24 of its 33 games so far, exerting more control in matches under Slot that it used to under his predecessor, Jurgen Klopp. The margin of victory has only been more than two goals on five occasions.\n“Although we aren’t the only team in this league who finds it hard to win a game of football by a margin of three or four goals,” Slot said. “That was maybe easier two, three, four, five years ago.\n“So either the teams aren’t so good anymore — the Liverpools, the Citys, the Arsenals — or we are still very good and the other teams have the funds to spend just as much, or in some situations even more, than Arsenal, City and Liverpool.”\nSlot described getting the chance to seal the league in front of Liverpool’s fans as a “big responsibility.” In 2020, when Liverpool claimed league title No. 19 to end a 30-year drought, it was clinched as a result of a loss by second-place City and no fans could attend the final matches at Anfield during the pandemic.\n“We are aware of the fact the last time this club won the league, it was Covid time,” Slot said. “So everyone is looking forward to Sunday. But we know there is still a job to be done. And that’s one point.”\nMore sports, gear and tickets\n- Where to watch Michigan State vs. Wisconsin today: College basketball free stream\n- Where to watch the NBA Celebrity All-Star Game for free today\n- Where to watch NASCAR Truck Series at Daytona tonight: Free live stream\n- How to watch Syracuse lacrosse vs No. 1 Maryland today for free\n- Where to watch USA women’s hockey vs. Italy today: Winter Olympics free stream\nFuboTV is a live TV streaming service focused on live sports, including U.S. and international soccer, the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL and more.
