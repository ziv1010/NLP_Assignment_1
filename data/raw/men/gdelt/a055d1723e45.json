  "body_text": "Lionel Messi’s start with Inter Miami in recent weeks has been spectacular and far from pre-ordained. Yes, his is a unique talent, but he would’ve been forgiven for taking the measure of his new surroundings for a little while longer. And in any case, it’s never easy moving clubs, never mind leagues.\nSo, that puts in some context the achievement of a 22-year-old who was brought in to play for the defending champions in the most watched league on the planet. Erling Haaland proved up to the task and the hype: the Norwegian helped Manchester City win their third consecutive Premier League title by scoring a competition record of 36 goals (playing in 35 games). The club also won the FA Cup and then the Champions League to become European champs for the first time in their history and the winners of a famous treble.\nThe young upstarts of Arsenal made the running in the 2022-2023 league campaign both before and after the World Cup break, but the rather more experienced City overtook them towards the end. However, the Gunners, beefed up with the acquisition of Declan Rice, seem the club best positioned to stop an unprecedented four in a row for City.\nThe bookies have Liverpool, winners in 2020 and close runners-up two years later, the second must likely to spoil Pep Guardiola’s bid for immortality (or at least a higher grade of immortality). The Reds now have Messi’s fellow World Cup winner with Argentina Alexis Mac Allister ready to start this weekend.\nClubs called Manchester have won 20 titles in the 31 seasons of the Premier League era, but United have failed to add to their 13 since iconic manager Alex Ferguson’s departure a decade ago. Can they do it in 2024? It’s possible, say the bookies, who’ve put them fourth favorites overall.\nAfter those, it’s take your pick between Chelsea, Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and Tottenham Hotspur. Many Irish fans would love to see Meath teenage sensation Evan Ferguson spearhead a Seagulls’ bid for glory. The Republic of Ireland have had few natural strikers at this level. Robbie Keane certainly looked the part over many years; some feel, though, that the young Brighton forward has what it takes to go a stage further and become the next Irish sports superstar.\nDespite the league being ever more global in its player base, the Irish presence remains fairly strong. Defender Nathan Collins, for instance, will begin the new season with Brentford in London following his summer transfer from Wolves; meanwhile, Matt Doherty has rejoined that Midlands club. Donegal’s Seamus Coleman is again Everton captain and the Toffees must be hoping they can avoid a third consecutive relegation battle.\nEverton captain Seamus Coleman with a Kerry fan before the recent All Ireland final at Croke Park. [Morgan Treacy]\nLast year’s was a particularly open and competitive struggle in the last half and third of the table, with, interestingly, the three promoted clubs – Fulham (in 10th), Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth – all surviving.\nThis year’s batch brings the possibility of more Irish interest: defender John Egan is Sheffield United club captain, midfielder Josh Cullen is among the strong Irish contingent at Burnley, while Cork winger Chiedozie Ogbene will be hoping to get his debut with new club Luton Town before too long.\nLet’s hear what our pundits/fans are thinking.\nScott Silver, freelance designer, Arsenal\nThese are good times for the Arsenal. After near a decade of hoping to finish in the top 6, the Gunners have their sights on the league title. And rightfully so, after last year’s 2nd place finish.\nMikel Arteta has some new faces in the squad, to a tune of over £200,000,000, consisting of new midfielder Havertz, center back Timber and golden boy Declan Rice.\nIf the injury bug can stay away – Gabriel, Jesus – and continued excellent play by Odegaard and a happy Saka, these boys can more than hold their own against City. They just can’t continue to drop points from the lower-level teams, which has been their downfall in recent years.\nMichael O'Sullivan, Jesuit priest, Liverpool\nThe team was unfortunate last season with all the injuries which prevented them having a settled team that were accustomed to each other on the field, and there was also the matter of new signings having the usual first season that happens for some players, although Gapko did better in that respect than Nuñez. Mane, too, was missed. But it was disappointing to see the fall off in form of Van Dyck, and as we all predicted before the season started, midfield was not up to scratch. The team seemed burnt out until they began to get going very late in the season and the lack of energy and injuries were probably linked to the effort put in to win all competitions the previous season and the disappointment of coming up short in the two big prizes, the Champions League, and the Premier League.\nI am not so familiar with the new signings yet and did not see any of the team's pre-season matches. The way the team finished last season showed that they are still serious challengers for honors and the hope has to be that the new signings will blend in quickly and improve the team, that Van Dyck, who has not been the same player since his injury against Everton, will regain some of his old ability, and that the squad will stay injury free. While we could predict that the midfield needed strengthening before the season began, the performances at the back were shocking at times, and showed how crucial midfield is to stop opposition players breaking through the lines. The team will also have to reset with the departure of players who have served the club well and we will have to see if they do so quickly and have the team get off to a bright start to the season.\nOther teams, too, of course, are seeking to improve their squads and the competition in the Premier League is fierce. Unfortunately, that drive for success is contributing to it becoming a place where multi-millions are spent to buy success, and where it can also become a vehicle for sports washing. It is interesting that Liam Brady, who has given so much to the game, has now become disillusioned with the way it has gone. As I cheer on Liverpool this season, I will also be hoping to see the game not turn into a business at the expense of sport that can entertain and excite us.\nKieran Quilligan, Yonkers resident, West Ham United\nI can foresee a lot of problems this season for West Ham. They currently have signed no players. There seems to be a stand-off between David Moyes and Tim Steidten, the Sporting Technical Director. They have lost their captain [Rice], the squad is a lot weaker than last season and I expect them to be fighting relegation again as the squad have not improved. I think that Moyes is at the end of his tenure at West Ham. I will give it a mid-table finish at best at the end of the season.\nPaul Finnegan, Irish Business Organization, Chelsea\nAt the beginning of last season, I was hoping Todd Boehly, Chelsea's new owner, the man who replaced Abramovich, would leave Thomas Tuchel in place as the manager. Sadly, he did not, and what followed was the worst season Chelsea have had for years. But I think Boehly, an American, who also co-owns the LA Dodgers will start getting it right from now on, and I am cautiously optimistic we'll see silverware return to Stamford Bridge in the year ahead, most likely from a cup competition, especially now that Mauricio Pochettino is in place - who, incidentally, was born in a town called Murphy, in Argentina, named for an Irishman. However, it must be said, Boehly had some very expensive on-the-job training.\nJoe Behan, Florida resident, Manchester United\nEvery year most if not every team needs to buy players to help strengthen the squad and Manchester United as much as anyone else need some serious additions when it comes to scoring goals. Could be argued that Erik ten Hag needs a defender or two, a central midfielder, and most certainly a striker. Ten Hag has recently added to his squad and last season’s additions Casemiro and Martinez were very good buys. But it was not what the Dutch manager brought to the table, it’s how he dismantled it.\n“When I came to United the standards were not right,” is what Erik ten Hag said. He was 100 percent right and most importantly he has begun to fix those poor standards.\nSlowly but surely, he has removed what he obviously thinks is not working at Old Trafford and slowly but surely, he is building his brand. United are still not quite the consistent performers and winners they once were but achieving the top four and a cup under some trying circumstances shows this manager may have what it takes to bring back the glory days to Manchester United.\nSome big wins last year but some terrible performances. However, the one thing that didn’t happen was they did not implode. They didn’t panic when Liverpool came charging up the table in the final stages of the season in search of a top four spot. United lost a couple of games but then managed to put a few wins together, finishing third place. The overall standard of the league last time out was by no means stellar but the top four this year is going to be tougher to achieve.\nJadon Sancho playing for Manchester United in Sunday’s preseason friendly against Athletic Bilbao at the Aviva Stadium. [Inpho/Evan Treacy]\nFinally, Manchester United has found the right man in ETH to run the show and to put players in their place or indeed oust them. A top-four finish will do but need to see more consistency and less individual mistakes. Of course, the icing on the cake will be reaching the knockout stages of the Champions League.\nPaul Galligan, labor attorney, Leeds United\nOkay, so Leeds were relegated to something called the Sky Bet Championship. Not something new for Leeds. My biggest issue is why don’t they just call it the Second Division? Marketing has taken over everything. At least I can stop hearing Leeds are too good to go down. Anyway, will Leeds bounce back up? I wouldn’t bet on it. Farke is a great choice for manager but even he did not take Norwich up in his first year. I fear it will take Leeds too long to get their best team out there. Hopefully the new owners have more patience with the manager than the last shower.\nChristine Kinealy, historian, Liverpool\nI am the child of a mixed marriage. My father supported Liverpool, my mother supported Everton. I chose to support the Reds, my brother, the Blues. I have never regretted that decision, although the creation of the Premier League appeared to mark an end to Merseyside’s glory days. Moreover, the Hillsborough disaster and subsequent police cover-up, revealed a dark side to the beautiful game.\nThe last few seasons have brought the usual mixture of joy and disappointments—which are integral to being a Liverpool fan. Winning the Premier League in 2019-2020 was brilliant – but tempered by the fact it was achieved before empty stadiums and in total silence. Last season created many heart-searching moments; our mid-field looked tired; the defense had lost its sharpness and the strikers were missing goals that looked unmissable. Mane’s departure proved even more painful as Nunez failed to live up to his promise.\nChristine Kinealy’s dog Cu is a big fan of Jurgen Klopp.\nThe summer has seen many departures, not all of which were expected. The team will miss the wisdom and experience of Henderson and Milner, and the unselfish play-building magic of Firmino. There have been some strong purchases. The pre-season has suggested a reconfiguration in the mid-field with a “box” consisting of Mac Allister, Szoboszlai, Lavia (hopefully) and Alexander-Arnold. However, there is a fear that Liverpool have not spent enough in attracting new players, with some gaps remaining in the squad. Although the transfer window has not yet closed, the aggressive presence of the Saudi Pro League, and their extended transfer deadline, has been a source of concern for Klopp and other European managers.\nWhat will the 2023-2024 season bring? This season, it is not Everton but another team in blue that will cause problems for Liverpool. Also, Arsenal and Newcastle will be looking to build on last season’s momentum. Nonetheless, I predict Liverpool will finish in the top two, while consolation for last year’s disappointing finish would be to win the Europa Conference League. Being a Liverpool supporter means not only that you will never walk alone, but that you never give up hope.\nJay Mwamba, Irish Echo, Manchester City\nRegarded as the best club side in the world after a trifecta of victories last season – including that long coveted Champions League trophy — Manchester City begin another campaign the team to beat. And they will take some beating.\nA couple of outstanding faces might have departed the Etihad this summer, but Pep Guardiola’s City are unlikely to miss a beat in the new season.\nManchester City’s Phil Foden playing for England against Ireland at Wembley in November 2020. [Inpho/Tommy Dickson]\nWhile talismanic German playmaker İlkay Gündoğan left for Barcelona on a free and the often-mesmerizing Algerian winger Riyad Mahrez joined the petro-dollar rush to Saudi Arabia, both, at age 32, were unlikely to get better. At any rate, their departure could mean more minutes for two of the newly crowned European champions’ best young talents -- Phil Foden and Julián Álvarez – whose minutes were limited last season for tactical reasons.\nStill, in order to fortify a team built around goal-scoring juggernaut Erling Haaland, Guardiola has brought in Chelsea linkman Mateo Kovačić, and his fellow Croat, the RB Leipzig central defender Josko Gvardiol.\nOne of the best coaches in football history, Guardiola should have City ready for another exciting run at glory.\nJohn Spinks, artist, Newcastle United\nAs a kid I can recall a coach telling us: “Let the ball do the work.” It gave me insight into the game. Eddie Howe has used that maxim to distract focus away from the Saudi/Sportswashing question. By assembling a fiercely competitive and entertaining squad he has let the ball do the diplomatic work.\nThe season begins with the three testing fixtures. First, much improved Aston Villa is at St. James’ Park. Next is Man. City at the Etihad. I’d take a draw. Then back home to St. James’ Park for Liverpool. I’m hoping both City and Liverpool are undergoing a transition period.\nIt’s good to be able to write this having recently seen the ‘Toon play Brighton at Red Bull Stadium. Howe has used the U.S. tour to test the rotation potential of the squad. Several Academy players, lads in their teens and 20s have been introduced. Elliott Anderson is the obvious standout. His two goals in the 2-1 win at Red Bull Stadium were scored with either foot. One was all strength and tenacity, the second was speed and anticipation. He’s only 20.\nBill Farrell, left, and John Spinks enjoyed Newcastle's preseason win over Brighton at the Red Bull Arena.\nHarvey Barnes brings Premier League experience from Leicester. I’m excited about Tonali from Milan, he looks the business. Tino Livramento – England U-21. Right Back, a late signing. An understudy for Trippier, another shrewd purchase.\nThe squad has an exotic mix of characters and cultures with a fair percentage of local talent. Let’s hope that the remarkable team spirit fostered by “Wor Eddie” continues to prevail.\nAnthony C. Murphy, writer, Manchester United\nWhen United were humiliated by Liverpool, I was at a water park with family and friends. They were on the slides and I was at a poolside bar watching the game. It was an awful excursion. I don't even like public baths.\nI nearly gave up then, after more than 40 years of following United, and going to some matches, but the team picked up and I admire Rashford and the young wingers, Garnacho and Pellistri, for their verve.\nIf they had won the F.A. Cup I may have more faith but I just think City are in their unstoppable pomp and United are too unpredictable. Casemiro is great but always booked or sent off. So I can't predict anything.\nAnd then all the talk about the Sheikh buying United, it just made me despair.\nAfter the Champions League final, I stopped reading the English newspapers and cancelled my subscriptions to ESPN, Paramount, etc.\nI don't know who's been sold or who's come in.\nUnited used to be an enjoyment. Now it feels like a chore. [anthonycmurphy.com]\nDom Stingas Paczko, Burton-on-Trent resident, Tottenham\nSince 2019 it's felt like we've existed in a perpetual cycle of optimism and despair, and fans were almost fighting amongst themselves over the cause of last season's shambles. Was it Conte's unwillingness to adapt a system that wasn't working? Was it Daniel Levy? Son having his worst season for years? Our lack of due diligence on our Director of Football after he received a world wide ban for fiddling the books at Juventus? Injuries? Eric Dier for playing football like Eric Dier? Probably it's all of the above and more.\nI don't think it's unfair to say Spurs fans were initially underwhelmed with the appointment of Postecoglou, but history also shows that our last three most popular managers; Jol, Pochettino and Redknapp, were all unfancied. Surprisingly a football club seems to be a happier place when the manager doesn't behave like he's doing everyone a favor by gracing us with their god-like presence.\nSo far summer business has been decent. Maddison certainly looks like the type of player we've been missing since Eriksen left and we've got our replacement for Lloris among others. We need at least two center backs, but we need to ship players out of our bloated squad first. We've got more dead wood than the Petrified Forest, being paid more money than their performances warrant. If I were any of their agents I'd be on the first flight to Riyadh with a highlights reel and a dubious position on human rights.\nThe Kane saga continues to rumble on and is a continued distraction. Chances are he'll be enjoying a morning Kartoffelpuffer before the ink has even dried on this sentence.\nMy overriding concern is Postecoglou's history of poor starts at new clubs as players adapt to his pressing system. Combine that with our fanbase's kink for knee-jerk reactions, and Big Ange could find himself spending Boxing Day BBQing on Bondi Beach instead of battling Brighton away.\nAs United saw with ten Hag and the official league bottlers up the road with Arteta, patience is key, and given the uninspiring, insipid displays we've had to ensure for 4 years, entertaining, attack minded football and a 7th place finish should be seen as progress.\nStephen Boland, UPS worker, Liverpool\nLiverpool had very few injuries when they went for quadruple in the 2021-22 season, unlike last season. So I’m optimistic, if everybody stays fit. A couple of players are gone, but we won’t really miss them except for Fabinho. He still had it. I like the signings they’ve had so far. Mac Allister had a great World Cup with Argentina. And this Hungarian guy Szoboszlai, I’m seen some of his stuff on YouTube. He can hit from long distance – he’s got that Gerrard kind of power. When they moved Trent Alexander-Arnold into midfield, Liverpool almost immediately started to improve. So, I’m optimistic on that. Nunez didn’t impress last season, except for a few flashes, but he has been pretty good pre-season. I think we have enough up front with Diaz and Gakpo. Jota is another player who came back from injury last year and wasn’t the same, but we should have him back to form.\nThere’s no disputing that City are probably one of the best teams ever in the Premier League, ever in English football, the way they won the treble. They thoroughly deserved it. But they lost a few players this year and haven’t replaced them that much. So, it could be interesting. I think that Liverpool can challenge for the title this year.\nNiall O’Leary, Irish-dance teacher, Manchester United\nSo, this could be the season to end the wait. Manchester United are ready to soar again with a new team of intelligent, cohesive and hungry footballers.\nI am very optimistic that with the new arrivals -- Mount, Onana and Hojlund -- Man. U. will be back on top, as long as everyone stays in form and plays to their true potential, and Casemiro tones down his aggressive tendencies. This will have to be achieved without some recent stars and wannabes who are now either in the departure lounge, circling the airport looking for a new club, missed their flight, or in some cases never even showed up at the airport: Van De Beek didn't contribute enough, De Gea made too many errors recently, Maguire needs to play for a hoofer team, and Martial could use his gloves to do some gardening. Then there is Johnny Evans, who instead of being brought back as a match-day stadium tour guide like Bryan Robson, may potentially be offered a one-year contract to run slower than Maguire?! He should be refused boarding because he has too much baggage!\nNiall O’Leary likes to bring some Bruno Fernandes-style flair and precision to the teaching of Irish dancing. [Ken Visser/Two Hats Productions]\nRashford was amazing for spells last season, but we cannot be depending on him so much. The others need to step up. The only downside is the new away strip, which is just about good enough to clean an oil spill on the tarmac. It is horrid!\nWatch for Man. United climbing steps in May. Hopefully not just boarding the last flight out of town! [www.nialloleary.com]",
