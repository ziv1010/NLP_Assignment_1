  "body_text": "After seeing our final trip to Goodison Park end in a 1-1 draw, Mikel Arteta discussed the game with journalists in the post-match press conference.\nHe was asked about the title race, team selection and our Champions League game against Real Madrid on Tuesday.\nHere is everything he had to say:\non the result:\nI think we deserved more, but that's what we got at the end at a really tough place to come. What they do, they do it really well, constantly putting the balls into the last line, dealing with direct play and second actions. I think we haven't conceded anything in the game, which was really positive. We were 1-0 up, had some big opportunities, going into spaces - we didn't finalise the action in the second half.\nWe didn’t start well, didn’t dominate the game, we had to be more aggressive, have more spaces. We started the opposite, we gave the ball straight to the keeper, direct play, trouble. Again, direct play, and the referee decides to give a penalty. That changes the course of the game, which I'm here to give my opinion and after seeing it 15 times, there is no way that, in my opinion, that's a penalty, because if there is, then O'Brien has to be out, and Everton has to play with 10 men, that's clear.\nAfter that, again, we dominated the game. We didn't get too much momentum, because it’s constantly breaking the play and a big part of that was down to us, because after direct play, we gave very cheap free-kicks away. We had two big chances to win the game, we didn't convert them, so, we have to accept the point.\non the gap between Liverpool being so large:\nMerit to Liverpool, the way they are winning their football matches. I'm talking about a reflection of what happened today, what was really relevant for the score and there is no question that, apart from that, they had nothing. But obviously that changes completely the momentum and the results.\non if Myles Lewis-Skelly has been targeted by referees:\nNo, I don't think that any referee targets a player.\non the changes we made to the starting line-up:\nThere were four players that couldn't start the game after what happened with Fulham, and obviously the injury of Gabi, so that forces you as well to make some changes. Players deserve to play minutes, so I'm very happy with that. Everybody has to be important, has to feel important. They have so many games coming up right now, and we have to rely on all of them.\non if the changes were made with Real Madrid in mind:\nWe thought this might be, but not for what was happening on Tuesday, but because some of them haven't trained, they haven't had the opportunity to start the game.\non if Bukayo Saka can start on Tuesday:\nHe's in a much better place. Obviously, we have built that up, he played 30 minutes [against Fulham]. Today he's played 49, a little bit less, because we saw the end of the game, and after that he will be in a much better place.\non who will play at left centre-back against Real Madrid:\nWe have alternatives there. Today, we have players that haven't played together, so that cohesion hasn't been there. Ben especially hasn't played at all almost this season, so it's good that they have the minutes and that understanding. We will assess what are the best options for that back line.\non how Mikel Merino is:\nHe's fine, I just checked with the doctor. He had a cut, so he was bleeding quite a lot in the first half. Then he started again, so overall he wasn't feeling anything.\non any other injury concerns:\nNo.\non this being our last game at Goodison Park:\nThe Premier League has got a reputation all over the world for places like Goodison Park. I think that makes it unique, so it's going to be very strange. I understand it's the evolution of football, of a football club, but this is very much part of the history of this league. When you want to describe to somebody from abroad what the Premier League looks like, they say go to Goodison Park and experience it. Unfortunately, in a few months we're not going to have that again.\non looking ahead to Tuesday night:\nIt's one of the most beautiful games that you can play in football, in the highest European competition, against the team that has dominated that competition in the last 20, 25 years. So, yeah, really looking forward to it.\non if we will rest ahead of the game:\nWe have to train and prepare a few things, but tomorrow we'll have some time to rest and start preparing really well for the game because we're looking forward to that game.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
