  "body_text": "How to watch today's Georgia Bulldogs vs. Vanderbilt Commodores game: Livestream options, starting time, more\nThe No. 1 Georgia Bulldogs face the Vanderbilt Commodores today in an SEC showdown. Bulldogs rookie quarterback Carson Beck comes into Week 7 of the 2023 NCAA college football season riding high, having passed the 300 passing yards mark in each of the team's last three games. Teammate Brock Bowers, with 37 catches for 545 yards and four touchdowns this season, is the rare tight end with Heisman Trophy chatter surrounding him.\nThe Bulldogs set out this season to become the first team in modern NCAA college football history to win the national championship three times in a row. Coming into Week 7 undefeated, Georgia's hopes for a three-peat seems entirely possible.\nNote: CBS Essentials and Paramount+ are both subsidiaries of Paramount.\nWhen does the Georgia Bulldogs vs. Vanderbilt Commodores game start?\nThe Week 7 game between the Bulldogs and the Commodores will be played Saturday, Oct. 14 at 1:00 p.m. ET (10:00 a.m. ET). It will air on CBS.\nHow to watch the Georgia Bulldogs vs. Vanderbilt Commodores game\nWhile most cable packages include CBS, it's easy to watch the game if CBS isn't included in your cable TV subscription, or if you don't have cable at all.

You can still watch the NFL on TV with an affordable indoor antenna, which pulls in local over-the-air HDYC channels such as CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, PBS and more. Here's the kicker: There's no monthly charge.\nAnyone living in partially blocked-off area (those near mountains or first-floor apartments), a digital TV antenna may not pick up a good signal -- or any signal at all. But for many homes, a digital TV antenna provides a seriously inexpensive way to watch college football without paying a cable company. Indoor TV antennas can also provide some much-needed TV backup if a storm knocks out your cable (or your cable company gets in a squabble with a network).\nThis amplified HDTV antenna, claims to have a 50-mile range and offers 36 channels. It's rated 4.0 stars by Amazon reviewers.\nSaid one Amazon customer, \"When the price of this antenna dropped to $50, it was competitively priced with what you would find on the shelves at your local Radio Shack. If you're considering this product, you're probably already questioning your cable television bill and are looking around for a cheap way to get the Big 3 plus Fox and PBS. This antenna delivered that for us right out of the box.\"\nMore teams to follow during the 2023 college football season\nImportant dates for the 2023 college football season:\n- The 13-week 2023 college football season runs from Aug. 27 through Dec. 9.\n- Two semifinal games, the Rose Bowl Game and the Allstate Sugar Bowl, are scheduled for New Year's Day (Monday, January 1, 2024).\n- The College Football Playoff National Championship is scheduled for Monday, January 8, 2024 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.\nThe Georgia Bulldogs want to run it back. The Georgia Bulldogs became just the fifth program to win back-to-back national championships when they beat the Alabama Crimson Tide 33-18 in 2022. Since 1936, no college team has won three-in-a-row. The Bulldogs are hoping to change all that. Head coach Kirby Smart has focused on leadership skills for his players, stating the team's biggest opponent is \"complacency.\" Coming into Week 7, the Bulldogs are undefeated. Three-peat? Anything's possible with this squad.\nWere Deion Sanders and the Colorafo Buffaloes a fluke ? Coach Prime made headlines during the offseason. Only ten scholarship players from the Buffaloes' 2022-season roster remain on the team after Sanders took advantage of transfer portal rules to revamp the team's roster. Prime's in his first season as the Buffaloes coach and he'll hope to work the same magic on the Buffaloes program as he did in his successful three years at Jackson State. 4-2 coming into Week 7 after barely beating ASU, the Buffaloes have been criticized for having too much swagger. If anyone remembers Sanders' NFL and MLB careers, one knows you can never have too much swagger. This is the team to watch this season, winning or losing.\nHow will all the college football shake ups shake out? In July 2022, UCLA and USC finally agreed on something. The frenemy rivals would both leave the Pac-12 in favor of the Big Ten in 2024. This summer, Colorado announced it would return to the Big 12. Since then, Arizona, Arizona State and Utah have announced an exodus from the Pac-12 to the Big-12 at the end of the 2023 season. Washington and Oregon State are also ditching the Pac-12 for the Big 10 at the same time.\nThe school shuffling won't affect the 2023 season much, but expect journalists to talk about it to no end. With the Pac-12 currently down to just four teams for the 2024 season, the demise of the Pac-12 is sure to be one of the biggest stories of the season.\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide came into the 2023 season ranked No. 4. Saban and company aren't comfortable with the demotion. Still not the dominant Bama team fans have come to rely on, the Tide are hoping to be a major threat to the Bulldogs scoring that three-peat. Ohio State has arguably one of the best receiver rooms in college football led by the dazzling Marvin Harrison Jr. The Buckeyes are coming into Week 7 undefeated, just one win over the 5-1 Crimson Tide.\nRelated content on CBS Essentials\n- Best TV and Internet bundles: Save money and get the services you want\n- Best digital TV antennas: How to watch NFL games without cable or streaming services\n- Sling TV deal: Watch the NFL and more live TV for half price\n- Nike Zoom NFL Pegasus 40 sneakers: How to buy shoes for the Cowboys, Chiefs, Steelers, Jets and more [CBS Sports]\n- How to throw an NFL watch party [CBS Sports]\n- How to watch Lionel Messi play for the Inter Miami CF\n- Best TVs for watching sports in 2023",
