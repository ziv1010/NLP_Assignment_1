  "body_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Jayden Daniels left Washington’s game against Seattle with an injury to his left, non-throwing arm. Daniels' arm bent gruesomely while he was being tackled near the goal line in the fourth quarter. The Commanders were down 38-7 at the time, raising questions about why Daniels was still in the game. It was yet another injury for the second-year quarterback in a season that has quickly spiraled for Washington. Daniels had just come back from a hamstring injury that caused him to miss the previous game at Kansas City. He also missed two games earlier this season with a knee injury.\nNEW YORK (AP) — The $500 million Los Angeles Dodgers’ thrilling World Series win over the Toronto Blue Jays attracted record international attention for Major League Baseball, affirmed LA’s status as the sport’s best team and drew more attention to baseball’s payroll disparity heading into what is likely to be contentious labor negotiations. Los Angeles’ 5-4, 11-inning win over Toronto in Game 7 on Saturday night capped a postseason with seven winner-take-all games, two more than any previous year.\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Josh Allen had a touchdown pass and two TD runs to outduel Patrick Mahomes and the Buffalo Bills defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 28-21 in a rematch of last season’s AFC championship game. James Cook had 114 yards rushing and Buffalo’s defense did the rest in harassing Mahomes, who was sacked three times, hit 15 more and finished with the worst completion percentage of his career. The game was decided in the final 17 seconds when Mahomes threw three straight incompletions from Buffalo’s 40. Buffalo improved to 6-2, while Kansas City dropped to 5-4.\nThe Big 12 has two teams in the top 10 of the Associated Press Top 25 college football poll for the first time in two years. Notre Dame is back in the top 10 after a two-month absence. Oklahoma and Texas have made significant upward moves. The top seven teams remain unchanged, with Ohio State at No. 1 for the 10th straight week. Losses by Georgia Tech, Vanderbilt, and Miami have shuffled the Nos. 8, 9, and 10 spots. BYU, Texas Tech, and Notre Dame now hold them. Oklahoma and Texas received seven-spot promotions for their wins on Saturday.\nLAS VEGAS (AP) — Cam Little of the Jacksonville Jaguars has broken an NFL record by kicking a 68-yard field goal. Little converted the kick at the end of the first half against the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday. Justin Tucker had the previous record, a 66-yarder in 2021 that gave the Baltimore Ravens a 19-17 win over the Detroit Lions. While Tucker’s kick hit the crossbar, Little’s boot had plenty of room as it sailed through the uprights. Little came into the game having missed three of his last four kicks, including an extra-point attempt. But the Jaguars’ coaches insisted they had faith in the second-year pro, who hit a 70-yarder in the preseason.\nAVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Kyle Larson has denied Denny Hamlin his first career championship at Phoenix Raceway. A late caution sent the title-deciding finale into overtime. Hamlin was three laps from shedding the label as the greatest NASCAR driver to never win a championship when William Byron got a flat tire and hit the wall. Hamlin led the field down pit road and got four new tires on his Toyota. Larson only took two tires in his Chevrolet. It meant Larson was fifth for the two-lap sprint to the finish, with Hamlin back in 10th. Ryan Blaney, who was eliminated from title contention last week, won the race.\nAuburn fired coach Hugh Freeze after the Tigers lost for the 12th time in their last 15 Southeastern Conference games. Freeze failed to fix Auburn’s offensive issues in three years on the Plains, scoring 24 or fewer points in 17 of his 22 league games. He also ended up on the wrong end of too many close matchups. His finale was a 10-3 home loss to unranked Kentucky in which Jackson Arnold and Ashton Daniels were sacked a combined seven times. It was Auburn’s third consecutive loss at Jordan-Hare Stadium and dropped the team to 1-5 in SEC play.\nHOUSTON (AP) — Denver’s Marcedes Lewis made history Sunday against the Houston Texans when at age 41 he became the oldest tight end to ever play in an NFL game. When he entered the game on the fourth snap of Denver’s first drive he also became the oldest player to appear in a game in franchise history. Lewis is the second-oldest active player in the NFL behind Aaron Rodgers, who will turn 42 in December. Lewis was signed to the practice squad on Wednesday and promoted to the active roster Saturday.\nEurope’s top teams appear to have finally come to grips with the new-look Champions League. The standings look very different heading into the fourth round of games compared to one year ago, when the new 36-team format debuted and the results were less predictable. The top end of the table before Tuesday’s games is a list of unbeaten, high-earning teams led by Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich. They meet Tuesday at Parc des Princes. A second blockbuster is fifth-place Real Madrid at 10th-place Liverpool. It opens the door slightly for teams outside the big five leagues to catch up. Sporting Lisbon is tied for 11th.\nLANDOVER, Md. (AP) — Sam Darnold threw four touchdown passes before his first incompletion, and the Seattle Seahawks played a near-perfect first half offensively on their way to a 38-14 rout of the Washington Commanders. Washington lost Jayden Daniels to an injury. The second-year quarterback left in the fourth quarter after his nonthrowing arm bent gruesomely while he was being tackled near the Seattle goal line. Darnold completed his first 17 passes. At halftime, he was 16 for 16 for 282 yards and four TDs against Washington’s beleaguered defense.\nFinals\nNATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE\nFinal Tampa Bay 4 Utah 2\nFinal N-Y Islanders 3 Columbus 2\nFinal Calgary 2 Philadelphia 1\nFinal Anaheim 4 New Jersey 1\nFinal SO Detroit 3 San Jose 2\nNATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE\nFinal Carolina 16 Green Bay 13\nFinal Chicago 47 Cincinnati 42\nFinal Denver 18 Houston 15\nFinal L.A.
