I know that in this kind of club, also in Tottenham but especially Manchester United, it’s strange because you have some coaches here that lose some games and are sacked. It’s hard to explain.\n“But we will reach a moment that we have to win no matter what.”\nLeicester have been charged by the Premier League for alleged financial breaches in the 2023-24 campaign.\nThe case, which will be heard by an independent commission, relates to the club allegedly breaking profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) when they were in the Championship last season.\nIf found guilty, the Foxes, who will play in the second tier again next term following relegation, could be handed a points deduction.\nEarlier this season, the midlands club won an appeal which prevented the Premier League from charging them for breaching PSR rules in 2022-23.\nManchester United meet fellow Premier League strugglers Tottenham in the Europa League final at San Mames Stadium.\nBoth sides are seeking to salvage miserable seasons, with United sitting 16th in the top flight – a point and a place above Spurs.\nIn addition to silverware, the victors will also claim Champions League qualification.",
