  "body_text": "According to GIVEMESPORT, Manchester United star Antony will leave the club if manager Erik ten Hag gets sacked.\nThe Dutch manager is under increasing pressure as recent reports in the media have suggested that new Man United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to relieve ten Hag of his duties at the end of the season.\nMan United have endured a tough season with failure in the Champions League and the Premier League.\nOnly a top-four finish and success in the FA Cup can save Man United’s season but even that is looking highly unlikely considering the inconsistency of the team.\nten Hag has struggled at Man United\nMoreover, ten Hag has failed to develop a distinct playing style of the team even after getting time and investment to do that.\nFootball pundits Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville have criticised the Dutch manager for failing to build a proper playing style at the club.\nIt’s difficult to imagine Antony staying at the club, particularly if Ten Hag departs this summer.\nMan United are expected to let ten Hag leave\nThe money invested in him has been one of the darkest moments of ten Hag’s reign at Old Trafford. The former Ajax star has failed to deliver after his expensive move.\nIf Ten Hag had been able to adopt a more respectable style of play, like Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham, supporters could have overlooked his poor assessment of Antony.\nFans expected ten Hag’s Man United team to play like his Ajax team, who played attacking and fast paced football. But instead, they play without a set football pattern and their tactics have been heavily criticised by football pundits and former players.",
