  "body_text": "How Ryan Giggs went from being Britain's most decorated footballer to standing in a Crown court dock, forced to confront his infidelities\nThe ex-United star has been found not guilty of domestic abuse allegations after the CPS dropped the case\nWalking into the imposing, Victorian courthouse, the 12 men and women had no idea what the next few weeks held in store for them. Away from their jobs and the normal day-to-day grind, they arrived on Monday morning to await further instructions.\nBut after arriving at Minshull Street Crown Court - a courthouse that has dispensed justice in the city since the 1870s - it would have been clear to them that this would be no ordinary day. The first tell tale sign was the huge queue snaking outside the courthouse as they tried to gain access.\nIt took some court visitors about an hour to get inside and through security. A large scrum of paparazzi and reporters was the other give away that something extraordinary was about to take place.\nTry MEN Premium for FREE by clicking here for no ads, fun puzzles and brilliant new features\nFor the seven women and five men who were eventually called on to the jury, walking into the wood panelled, 19th Century courtroom was the moment that confirmed this. Sat in the dock was a trim, athletic looking man in his 40s, with black, greying hair.\nHe chatted with a court dock officer before they were brought into the court. Wearing a dark navy suit and white shirt, many, if not all, knew exactly who the man was, without even having to be told his name by court staff.\nThey were sat feet away from one of the most decorated footballers in the history of the game - and one of Manchester United's greatest ever players. Little did they know when they woke up that morning, that they would be given a ringside seat in one of the most extraordinary criminal trials in recent times.\nA story of sex, power and elite sport, where they'd also hear from Britain's most successful ever football manager.\nWinning 13 Premier League titles; two Champions Leagues; and four FA Cups, Ryan Giggs represented the beating heart of the club's dominance of English football, throughout his storied 24 year playing career.\nHe became the club's manager for a time, and was even honoured by the Queen for his services to the beautiful game, receiving an OBE. He was a global icon, and was given the freedom of Salford.\nFor some, he was Manchester United. After hanging up his boots, Giggs went into management, landing his 'dream job' as manager of his birth nation, Wales.\nAt the time of that sensational trial in August last year, Giggs could have been preparing to lead his country to their first World Cup in 64 years. Instead, he spent three weeks in court, and, if convicted, faced up to five years in jail.\nThat jury could not agree on their verdicts on the charges Giggs faced. Now, the case has been thrown out after his ex-girlfriend was unwilling to give evidence again. In the words of his lawyer, he will now 'look to rebuild his life and career as an innocent man'.\nDespite being found not guilty, Giggs, now 49, admitted in court to being a 'liar' and a 'cheat'. During his trial he was forced to confront his much-rumoured infidelities in public for the first time. Even after being acquitted of criminal wrongdoing, the trial did little for his reputation, in the continuing glare of the world's media.\nFrom an early age, Ryan Giggs has lived in the public eye. As a child, his talents were obvious to all that saw him. Originally born in Cardiff to his father Danny, a rugby player, and his mother Lynne, a nurse, the family were uprooted to the North West after his dad signed for the Swinton rugby league team.\nA sport-mad youngster, he was soon scouted by Manchester City. But after an Old Trafford steward saw Giggs play, he tipped off Alex Ferguson and insisted that the manager sign him up. The rest, as they say, is history.\nJust three years after Giggs signed for United as a schoolboy, he made his first team debut aged just 17. In his first start for United, he scored the winning goal in the Manchester derby. Giggs won his first league title in 1993, United's first in 26 years.\nREAD MORE: Prosecutors say it was 'no longer in the public interest' to pursue Ryan Giggs over domestic abuse allegationsREAD MORE: Ryan Giggs 'deeply relieved' after being found not guilty of domestic abuse allegations as case droppedIt was the first act in an unprecedented era of success for Ferguson and United. After blooding Giggs in the first team, the Scot continued to use youth and several players broke through the club's fabled academy to United's first team. The Class of 92, including David Beckham, Gary and Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, followed soon after.\nAided by stars such as Eric Cantona and Peter Schmeichel, United quickly became the dominant force in English football. Hand-in-hand with success, Giggs became a pin-up boy in the new monied Premier League era, a tabloid dream whose skills on the pitch drew comparisons with George Best.\nThe comparisons with the Northern Irishman didn't end on the pitch. Giggs enjoyed a night out on the town, and his fame and good looks meant he was never short of attention.\nRumoured love interests included TV presenters and actresses. In those early years, Ferguson, a father figure for Giggs, tried to protect him from the media spotlight. His star continued to rise, and perhaps the most iconic moment of Giggs' United career came in 1999.\nOn April 14, 1999, the Reds were locked in a 1-1 stalemate with Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final. An unprecedented treble looked to be at risk. In an inspired work of genius in extra time, Giggs dribbled half the length of the pitch before smashing the ball into the roof of the net. The celebration, in which Giggs ripped his shirt off and swung it around his head to reveal a hairy chest, is perhaps now more famous than the goal itself.\nA month later, United secured that incredible Treble in Barcelona, in one of the greatest comebacks of all time. While United did not reach that historic high again, the club continued to win more Premier League titles under Ferguson's leadership.\nRumours of potential transfers to top European clubs sometimes did the rounds, but on the pitch, Giggs was a one club man. But he was not as faithful in his love life.\nLittle was known about Giggs' private life. He wedded long term partner Stacey Cooke, in a low key ceremony at the Lowry Hotel in 2007. Shunning the huge occasion typical of footballers, the wedding was attended by close friends and family only and even Ferguson and his United team mates did not attend, it was reported at the time.\nBut the marriage did not prove a successful one in the long term. Rumours of Giggs' infidelity became a feature of tabloid speculation.\nIt was one such tabloid story which was the catalyst for Giggs fighting an extraordinary legal battle to try and keep an alleged affair secret. In 2011 Giggs took out an injunction at the High Court in a bid to stop a national newspaper revealing details of an alleged fling with the ex-Big Brother contestant Imogen Thomas.\nAfter the paper ran a story without naming the Premier League footballer alleged to have conducted the affair, rumours spread like wildfire on Twitter. Eventually Giggs was named in Parliament by an MP as the footballer, using parliamentary privilege which protects MPs from libel claims.\nAn even more shocking revelation came following claims that Giggs had embarked on an eight-year affair with his own brother's wife. Rhodri Giggs, a footballer who played for FC United and Salford City, has said he has not spoken to his brother since the affair with Natasha was revealed.\nRyan Giggs and his wife stayed together. Despite the salacious rumours in the background, Giggs' United career continued to go from strength to strength.\nHe won the Champions League for a second time in 2008, and further Premier League titles followed until he decided to retire in 2014. Giggs holds the all-time record for most appearances for United, his 963 surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton's 758, in an incredible feat that is unlikely to ever be bettered.\nGiggs even became United manager for four games after the sacking of David Moyes. He was made assistant manager to Moyes' replacement Louis van Gaal, following rumours that Giggs could eventually become United's permanent manager.\nBut when Jose Mourinho took the hot seat at Old Trafford, Giggs left the club for the first time after nearly three decades. Away from the game which had given him fame and fortune, Giggs developed a range of business interests.\nAlong with fellow members of the Class of 92, he set up a university, UA92, now based in the old Kellogg's building in Trafford, and opened Hotel Football, a hotel and restaurant built in the backdrop of the football cathedral that made his name.\nIt was the hotel project that would inadvertently lead to his most public legal battle. Giggs recounted being 'instantly' attracted to Kate Greville. She became 'massively in love' with him.\nAn executive for the Manchester based Tangerine PR firm, she met Giggs through her work promoting the Hotel Football, around the time his playing career came to an end. Both were married. Greville claimed in court she had been in a 'controlling' relationship with her ex-husband, and described Giggs as her knight in shining armour.\nAfter all previous alleged infidelities, this would be the affair that would end Giggs' marriage. The relationship started out well. Gushing, toe curling text messages told of their infatuation with each other.\nIn August 2017, the couple shared raunchy poems. \"You make my heart flutter because you are a nutter,\" Greville wrote, the court heard.\n\"Every day you do me proud, not just because you are well endowed.\"\nGiggs replied: \"Darling Kate. Unequivocally our love was fate. I fell in love with you at first sight. I remember coz I was as high as a kite.\n\"Those beautiful eyes, made me shiver. I’m not gonna lie, I think of you, I dream of you. Can’t help thinking, pulling you was my greatest ever coo.\n\"That stomach, those abs, those pictures you sent. So I can keep tabs on you, makes me feel funny down there. Especially when you are there and you look up and stare.\n\"I'm beginning to think you are always right. That’s okay it will keep us tight.\n\"I'm gonna end by saying you are my love, my friend, my soul. And most of all you believe in me. Which makes me feel as hard as a totem pole.\"\nDespite the messages, both would later have very different versions of their time together. Greville would claim in court she saw 'red flags' early on in their relationship. She portrayed Giggs to jurors as a Jekyll and Hyde character, who could be loving but then turn.\nShe told the court Giggs would block her messages if she questioned him about seeing other women - and even alleged he threatened to disclose sexual pictures of her, and bombarding her friends when they broke up.\nWhile Giggs would say both were guilty of blocking each other, and that when he did contact her friends following break ups Greville would eventually be 'happy' as it showed he was willing to 'fight' for their relationship.\nGreville said he would check up on her online, and complain if she didn't respond quickly enough. The couple were prolific texters and exchanged 19,671 messages during their time together. Giggs told jurors Greville would do the same to him, and claimed she asked for his itinerary for the day when he was away as Wales manager.\nGreville described in court blocking Giggs on her phone and moving to Abu Dhabi for a job to 'get away' from him, believing he was not going to split with his wife.\nGiggs travelled to the Middle East and told her he wanted to start a family with her, she said. Greville left her husband but Giggs had remained with his spouse for 'around a year', the jury was told. He wanted to have his 'cake and eat it', Giggs would later admit. He and Stacey divorced in 2017.\nGreville claimed in court there were flashpoints during their time together. During a stay at the Westin Hotel in Dubai in 2017, she claimed Giggs 'dragged' her naked out of the room and threw her and her belongings into the corridor.\nHe denied there was any physical aspect to the row, and that he'd been packing her bag and asked her to leave. She also detailed to jurors an argument at La Petite Maison restaurant in Dubai in February 2018, over Giggs' using his mobile phone. Greville claimed he had been messaging another woman, while he said he was arranging a physio for his injured daughter.\nGreville later moved back to Manchester and their on-off relationship continued, the court heard. Following their frequent break ups, Greville, who by this time had secured a £100,000 job working in PR for Giggs' company, GG Hospitality, claimed Giggs would 'block' her messages if she accused him of being unfaithful.\nShe claimed to have received anonymous messages from two people accusing Giggs of infidelity. Describing the alleged 'abuse' as a 'cycle', she claimed in court Giggs would 'gaslight' her into questioning her understanding of the situation. Their on-off relationship continued.\nBy December 2019, they were back together and planned a stay at the Stafford Hotel in London in December 2019 for his agent's Christmas party. They mingled with TV sports presenters and cricketers, before a day of mini golf, a trip to Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland and then onto a nightclub, the court heard.\nBoth Greville and Giggs accused each other of flirting with other people, and Giggs eventually left for the hotel without her, jurors were told.\nThey had an argument in the room and Giggs was accused of kicking her in the back, so hard that she fell out of the bed, jurors heard. She accused him of throwing a laptop bag at her head, 'dragging' her out of the hotel room naked and locking her out for 10 minutes.\nThey later made up and had sex, the court was told. Giggs denied there was any physical element to the argument. In February 2020, another row followed on holiday in Dubai, after Giggs called Greville 'Stacey', his ex-wife's name, the jury heard.\nShe said it was an insult, while Giggs maintained it was a 'slip of the tongue'. Greville claimed to have suffered bruising after Giggs allegedly grabbed her bag and pulled it on her arm, jurors heard. A 'devastated' Giggs flew home alone.\nFollowing the fall-out, Giggs shared details of a 'plan' for their relationship. They would get a dog and live together. Greville was planning to go travelling but when the coronavirus lockdown was imposed in March 2020, she agreed to live with Giggs at his home in Worsley.\nGreville claimed Giggs' behaviour was 'on another level' during that time. She suffered 'adult acne', 'horrendous back pain' and panic attacks and began seeing a therapist, she said. Giggs questioned her loading of the dishwasher and treated her as a 'housemaid' or 'slave', she claimed.\nHe vehemently denied such a characterisation. Videos showed the couple exercising and miming to In da Club by 50 Cent. Like many people, they took part in online quizzes during lockdown, and unlike many other people, had food from Michelin starred chefs brought in.\nGiggs saw lockdown, the first time in which the couple lived together, as a happy period where they spent time with his two children.\nAfter Giggs returned home drunk one night, she claimed to have made a bombshell discovery which led her to hatch a plan. Greville would leave Giggs while he was away with his job as manager of the Wales football team.\nHe'd been unfaithful with her with eight different women during their relationship, she claimed messages from his phone and iPad proved.\nShe wrote a letter - which she titled 'The Final Goodbye' - and shared it with a friend. She wrote that Giggs had been in 'full on' relationships with other women while they were together.\n\"I know pretty much everything you have been doing with other women behind my back since the day I met you,\" she wrote. \"My gut always told me you couldn't be trusted and you were a compulsive liar and a serial cheat.\"\nThe letter would never be sent before the final act in their fractured relationship, on November 1, 2020. The couple were to meet friends for a meal at the Stock Exchange hotel in Manchester, then stay over. A petty row would end hours later with Giggs spending the night in a police cell, the court heard.\nIn conversation, Greville told Giggs how a man had asked her out on a date. She questioned him as to why he was asking her out, as she knew he had a girlfriend, the court heard.\nGiggs recalled: \"I just said 'that's a strange thing to say, why didn't you say you had a boyfriend?'.\" The pair retreated to their hotel room. In the heat of the moment, Greville 'blurted' out that she's found evidence of Giggs' infidelity.\nGreville left and headed for Giggs' home in Worsley, to collect her belongings and leave. Giggs arrived about 10 minutes later.\nOne of the key sources of their conflict was Mac, the cocker spaniel puppy. Giggs maintained Greville would not be taking the dog, as it was his and he and his children had become inseparable.\nOnly Giggs and Greville will ever know exactly what happened in that 60 minute period, between the pair arriving within his home in a leafy, gated community and the police arriving. But it ended with Giggs being arrested, and Greville accusing him of headbutting her.\n\"Please come quickly,\" Emma Greville, Kate's sister, who'd been looking after Mac while the couple had been away, told the 999 call handler. \"He has just headbutted her in the face.\" She would also accuse Giggs of elbowing her in the face as claimed she'd tried to protect her sister.\nThere was 'blood everywhere', Emma Greville claimed. Even the call handler was taken aback when he learned who was being accused of the headbutt. \"Okay, as in the, like the Ryan Giggs?\"\nGiggs was led away to a police van, to spend the night in a cell. More than 18 months later, he walked into court flanked by his legal team, followed by dozens of TV cameras and photographers.\nHe had faced challenges during his storied playing career - including battles with injury - but this would be his most important to date. In the meantime, he'd stood down from his job as Wales manager, to prevent it becoming a distraction for the team who will compete in their first World Cup in 64 years this winter.\nHe sat in the dock for six days as prosecutors outlined their case against him. His image may have been affected by tabloid stories about his private life, but if the jury believed the prosecution case then it would not just be his reputation at stake. The maximum sentence for controlling or coercive behaviour, and for actual bodily harm, was five years in jail.\nOn the seventh day, Giggs, who was supported in court by his mother Lynne, took the short walk into the witness box. He stood for three days, as he defended himself against Greville's accusations.\nHe confronted his reputation as a love cheat head-on. In stunning courtroom testimony, he was asked by his lawyer: \"You've had relationships with many women, up to and including Kate Greville, have you managed to be faithful to any of them?\"\n\"No,\" Giggs said.\n\"If you are attracted to a woman who has shown you interest regardless of your marital status, are you able to resist?\"\n\"No,\" Giggs repeated.\nAny bruising which Greville suffered at his hand was through 'rough sex' rather than any assault, he said. Giggs never assaulted her at any point, he said.\nHe didn't interfere with her relationships with friends or family and he had no complaint at her travelling the world on holiday, Giggs said. She remained financially independent and retained an apartment in Manchester, he said.\nHis legal team, led by Chris Daw QC, claimed Greville tried to get pregnant with him to secure long term financial stability, after she had her contraceptive coil removed without telling him. She'd told Giggs she had 'cancerous cells'.\nGreville had messaged a friend prior to their split saying 'I'm not walking away with nothing', and that she'd 'been awake planning my attack'. She denied wanting to get pregnant with Giggs.\nOne of the most extraordinary moments of an extraordinary trial came late on a Friday afternoon, in the second week.\n\"Your Honour with your leave I call Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson,\" Mr Daw said. In walked Sir Alex Ferguson, the most successful British football manager of all time. Sat in the witness box in court two of Manchester Crown Court for 15 minutes, Sir Alex said he'd never seen Giggs lose his temper ever since he first set eyes on him aged 13, playing for his local football team.\nThe pair had been side-by-side throughout their glory years at United, and Sir Alex, now 80, described him as being a model professional. After being granted a ringside seat for this extraordinary trial, it fell to those seven men and five women, catapulted into the case from their everyday lives, to deliver judgement.\nThe jury was deadlocked and the trial collapsed on August 31 last year. A re-trial was scheduled for July 31, but the case has now been thrown out. Signs the case may not proceed to a second trial began to emerge during a pre-trial hearing held earlier this month.\nProsecutor Peter Wright KC said that Kate Greville had told police she didn't want any part in the re-trial.\n\"At no stage has she indicated that the account she has given either in her witness statement, her ABE [video interview] or at trial was untrue,\" Mr Wright said.\n\"What she had indicated is a wish not to give evidence by reason of her own mental and physical wellbeing being so seriously affected by the process.\"\nMeanwhile, Giggs' legal team hit back.\n\"We are not for a moment buying the 'not well enough to give evidence' story.\" Chris Daw KC said.\nHe added: \"The prosecution have no case.\"\nThe prosecution ultimately agreed.\nDespite being acquitted, last summer's trial did nothing for Giggs' reputation. A self confessed 'liar' and 'cheat', Giggs previously said he intends to resume his managerial career. Giggs's position as one of Manchester United's greatest ever players remains, but his future in the game is perhaps more uncertain.",
