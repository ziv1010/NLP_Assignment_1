I don't think anybody else could play that role better than him, to be honest.\n\"I always watch Liverpool anyway, so I get to see him playing that role quite often. When I first started trying out the role, I got shown clips of when to roll in and become that inverted full-back, positions and stuff like that. He was the best player to use for clips.\"\nDavidson was also up close to one of Alexander-Arnold's most iconic moments in his bar-raising Liverpool career so far.\n\"I was a ball boy for the Barcelona game as well,\" he reveals.\nIndeed, Davidson was stationed next to U21s teammate Oakley Cannonier, who was a key figure in 'Corner taken quickly, Origi…' during the Anfield leg of that historic 2019 Champions League semi-final.\n\"I probably didn't have quite the impact that he [Cannonier] had!\" Davidson laughs. \"It was just unbelievable to be there. Where Oakley gave the ball to Trent, I was on the other side of the corner flag near the Main Stand.\"\nYou have to accept cookies in order to view this content on our site.\nWatch on YouTubeIt'll forever be an inspiring moment for the teenager as he looks to make his own journey from Liverpool trialist to Liverpool icon.\nRemarkably, it all begins with his auntie Lorraine simply being in the right place at the right time.\n\"My auntie used to be washing the kit and stuff like that for the players [at the Academy],\" Davidson explains. \"She ended up telling one of the scouts at Liverpool about me playing football.\n\"So then I ended up getting asked to go in for a trial and I just stayed there.\n\"When I signed my first professional contract [in 2022], I couldn't tell you how proud a moment it was for me and my family because I've supported Liverpool all my life. And all my family are Reds as well, so I think they were proud of me as well for making it this far.\n\"She [his auntie] was made up and then obviously would make a little joke now and again, saying she's the reason that I'm there!\"\nAfter the assist from Lorraine, Davidson's talent has seen him ascend through the ranks in the Kirkby set-up, developing as a player and leader along the way.\n\"When I was younger, I was the captain of my age quite often, so then I've always felt that role was suited to me in a way,\" he states. \"Obviously I've still got a lot of learning to do towards being a leader and stuff because I'm not the perfect leader.\n\"I'm made up that I was captain, so I'll just have to keep trying to learn to be a better captain if I can keep the armband.\"\nDavidson's latest chapter at Liverpool is with Barry Lewtas' U21s – his first campaign at Premier League 2 level.\nIt's proving to be a valuable experience in gaining the necessary skills and knowledge of what's required to reach the top of the game.\nHe finishes: \"It's been good getting exposure with the U21s because it's getting closer to the men's game. Obviously there's a few experienced players in there as well who are a few years older than me, so it's just good to learn off them and get advice off them.\n\"The intensity and just how physical it is from being [with the] U18s and jumping up, you don't realise how much of a big step it is until you actually feel it for yourself.\"\nFeatureMeet the Academy: The level-headed and driven Calum Scanlon\nInterviewMeet the Academy: James McConnell on PL debut, Klopp hugs and playing No.6\nFeatureMeet the Academy: The story of Luke Chambers' Liverpool debut and development\nFeatureMeet the Academy: Get to know the 'fearless' Trent Kone-Doherty",
