  "body_text": "Can England’s new manager end decades of Anglo-German tension (and win us a World Cup)?\nThe new England manager has won three league titles, three domestic cups, the Champions League, the Super Cup and the Club World Cup. He already has a close relationship with many England players, including Harry Kane. He’s widely regarded as one of the best coaches in Europe. But the one fact about Thomas Tuchel that everyone seems to be talking about? He’s German.\n“I am very proud to have been given the honour of leading the England team,” said Tuchel. “I have long felt a personal connection to the game in this country, and it has given me some incredible moments already. To have the chance to represent England is a huge privilege, and the opportunity to work with this special and talented group of players is very exciting.”\nEven Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the former Chelsea manager into his new job. “I know the whole House will join me in wishing the best of luck to the new England manager Thomas Tuchel,” he said during Prime Minister’s Questions. And Prince William posted on X: “Thomas, wishing you the best of luck, we’re all behind you! W.”\nBut despite the largely warm welcome, it still takes a moment to fully appreciate quite how courageous the appointment is.\nHaving a German national manage the England football team would have been unthinkable even 20 years ago, so strong was the Teutophobia in the sport (that’s a fear or hatred of Germans). In 1996, ahead of the England/Germany semi-final at Wembley, one Daily Mirror headline screamed “Achtung Surrender! For you, Fritz, ze Euro 96 Championship is over”.\nEven today, the old chant, “Two world wars and one World Cup…” hasn’t gone away and you’ll still hear “10 German Bombers” being sung on the stands. So could the appointment of Tuchel finally be the peace offering that ends decades of Anglo-German tension – not to mention all those stereotypical jokes about Fritz nabbing our sun loungers?\nEngland and Germany haven’t always been rivals. About 1,500 years ago, the Angles (a Germanic tribe) crossed the English Channel into what is today Great Britain. Old English is mainly influenced by Germanic languages and many of our everyday words remain similar to their German counterparts. And there remains a measure of schadenfreude when we merrily steal their words for when English simply doesn’t cut the mustard.\nIn the Middle Ages, the German cities of the Hanseatic League were closely aligned with England and Scotland through trade.\nThe German royal dynasty, the House of Hanover, became our royal family and gave us six British monarchs. When Queen Anne died in 1714, the German Elector George Louis of Hanover, being the senior Protestant descendant, was the heir to the throne, and he was proclaimed George I, King of Great Britain. It was claimed that he hardly spoke any English and had no manners, but he helped establish peace in Europe and his son George II gave us our national anthem – it remains to be seen whether Tuchel will be singing along with that one when the time comes.\nAs a nation, we loved German music long before “99 Luftballons” was a hit in 1983. Both England and Germany share a claim to the composer Handel, who was born in Germany but became a British citizen in 1727 – something which needed an entire Act of Parliament (Handel’s Naturalisation Act) for it to take place. Even today, Beethoven’s Ode To Joy remains one of the top pieces of music selected on Desert Island Discs.\nIn the 1800s the two nations found themselves bound together not just through organ concertos and their shared royal lineage, but their mutual interests in Europe. Indeed, British and German troops fought together to defeat Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815.\nWhen Queen Victoria (who had a partly German bloodline) married the provincial German Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840, Anglo-German ties between the countries were strengthened even further. And he gave us the Christmas tree and played a key role in the 1851 Great Exhibition, which helped spawn the great centres of learning in “Albertopolis”, or South Kensington as it’s more commonly known.\nBut everything changed in 1871 when German unification dramatically altered the balance of power in Europe. And when Germany formed an alliance with Austria-Hungary in 1879 things got even frostier. Their ambitions to build a battle fleet initiated a naval arms race with Britain. And then there was the small matter of two world wars.\nSo strong was anti-German sentiment during WWI that George V decided to change the Royal Family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in 1917. Prince Philip had predominantly German ancestors and spoke fluent German. But in 1947, shortly before his marriage to then Princess Elizabeth, he became a British citizen and relinquished his German title of nobility, calling himself only “Mountbatten”.\nBut never mind the wars, what about football? The Allied victory was fresh in people’s memories when England played West Germany at Wembley Stadium on that historic day in 1966. And since then it feels like every England-Germany game has come to be seen, at least by the English, as a sporting re-run of those two era-defining conflicts.\nThe amount of Hitler memes which greeted the news of Tuchel’s appointment this week shows that associations of the Nazis with Germany still loom large in our cultural imagination. It may have been way back in 1975 when Basil Fawlty was desperately reminding everyone not to mention the war, but it can feel like we haven’t really moved on from a retro sitcom version of German-Anglo relations. It’s no coincidence Fawlty Towers was named by The Telegraph as the best TV comedy of all time earlier this year, closely followed by Dad’s Army.\nSo perhaps Thomas Tuchel could be the man to finally overcome these perhaps outdated notions to rest and reunite our nations. If he does well leading the Three Lions, it won’t be the first time that a German has achieved national treasure status through the medium of football. Jürgen Klinsmann was a hero at Tottenham, Jürgen Klopp was a fan favourite to succeed Southgate. And Bert Trautmann, who fought for the Nazis, was awarded the Iron Cross for his exploits and arrived in England as a prisoner of war, broke his neck whilst playing for Manchester City during the FA Cup final in 1956 – and carried on playing making crucial saves. He was named Footballer of the Year that year.\nBut Tuchel certainly has his work cut out for him. England remains the only modern World Cup-winning country to appoint a foreign coach, and Tuchel will be the team’s third. Those who have gone before him haven’t had an easy ride from the press or the fans.\nWhen Sven Göran-Eriksson got the top job in 2001, the Swede was lampooned for being boring, and then a ladies’ man. His affair with Ulrika Jonsson – who said that having sex with Sven was “as exciting as building an IKEA bookcase” – was even blamed for England doing badly in the 2002 World Cup in South Korea / Japan.\nItalian Fabio Capello didn’t fare much better when he was appointed in 2007. He was criticised for never mastering the language and his uninspired tactics. He eventually quit in 2012, his only major tournament in charge ending in dismal failure, with a 4-1 defeat by Germany (who else?) at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\nBrexit was of course another blow to our fragile relationship with Germany. Leave.EU’s Arron Banks had to apologise after tweeting: “We didn’t win two world wars to be pushed around by a Kraut”, accompanied by a picture of Angela Merkel with one arm raised.\nBut whether the more Right-wing factions of England football supporters know it or not, the UK remains closely linked to Germany. Our love of hot wine and gingerbread means that most of our cities host a German Christmas Market. The largest outside of Germany or Austria can be found in Birmingham. Our nations’ mutual love of beer means that we have been only too quick to jump on the Oktoberfest bandwagon.\nMany of our trains are run by the Arriva, until recently a subsidiary of German transport giant Deutsche Bahn (although sadly it seems that the famous German efficiency hasn’t quite rubbed off on our transport network). We admire Germany’s capitalist values, its traditional social structures, its impressively strong economy.\nIf Thomas Tuchel achieves World Cup glory for England, the whole country will become a nation of Teutonophiles. Huge swathes of us will no doubt be proclaiming how much we always loved Germany, keen to point out our German ancestry, and raising a glass of Kölsch. Perhaps Tuchel could do for lederhosen what Southgate did for the waistcoat? But if it all goes wrong, well, we dread to think. So “Viel Glück, Tommy!” That’s German for good luck.",
