  "body_text": "Welcome to Week 18 of our staff column collecting news, insights, and highlights from around Major League Soccer.\nLast Wednesday, former Wales international Gareth Bale was asked to explain the most significant differences between soccer in the United States and Europe. In discussion with his former Tottenham Hotspur teammates Jermaine Jenas and Peter Crouch about Lionel Messi’s decision to join Inter Miami Bale’s answer concerned the concepts of victory and defeat.\nAdvertisement\n“They accept losing a lot better over there,” he said. “They know how to lose. But when they win, they celebrate like they won the championship – (Messi will) definitely enjoy it.”\nBale is far from the most qualified person to make this assertion. After signing as a free agent from Real Madrid in 2022, Bale made 14 appearances across MLS’ regular season, Leagues Cup and MLS Cup Playoffs for LAFC. His stint there was a chance for him to maintain fitness ahead of the 2022 World Cup, but also to contribute to a title favorite. He joined a side cruising toward the playoffs as a top seed. So as a result, one or two defeats during the 34-game regular season weren’t as consequential to the team’s aspirations to win the MLS Cup trophy.\nWhile Bale’s time in LA offered an opportunity for the club to elevate its status internationally by signing one of Europe’s best-known players of the past decade, his role was not to immediately become the team’s best and most influential player. Two starts in four months suggest his on-field role was always going to be more peripheral (though it paid off with his late, game-tying goal in MLS Cup).\nHis comments hit a nerve for many MLS fans and former players, with at least one former MLS player interpreting it as a slight against their desire to win.\n“C’mon man,” former LA Galaxy defender A.J. DeLaGarza wrote on Twitter. “Ask our wives, our children, our parents, our friends how fun it was being around us after we lose games in MLS. We also don’t have one of the highest payrolls in the entire football world.”\nThe sentiment was echoed by many but challenged by global football fans, who see the league’s playoff format and lack of promotion and relegation, and point out that it naturally diminishes the significance of regular-season results. DeLaGarza later noted that Bale had never played in a relegation-threatened side, suggesting that he was not in the best position to speak on the perils of relegation.\nAdvertisement\nIndeed, Bale did spend almost his entire career fighting at the upper end of the table. Regular season defeats can make or break a title, top-four, or promotion charge, and, as one of the world’s best in his prime, the hopes of a city and country’s fanbase often fell on his shoulders.\nThe discussion Bale accidentally started isn’t a new one. It’s a topic raised by many in the past, and they usually (though not always) have significant experience in football abroad. Perhaps most famously, former U.S. men’s national team manager Jurgen Klinsmann spoke often about the societal impact of losing football matches in the U.S. compared to Europe.\n“If you miss an easy shot in a game, you want the player to go to the supermarket or the butcher shop the next day and have a fan ask them why they missed that shot,” Klinsmann said in 2014. “We’re not there yet. But in the big leagues in Europe and South America, if you miss a shot, you’re held accountable for it. Then you don’t miss it anymore. This is something that will grow over time. The more it grows, the more often fans see [players] in the street and tell them, ‘You were crap yesterday.’ And this is important.”\nThere’s arguably nobody better to speak about the pressure of succeeding at the top level of European football than Bale. Despite being a crucial part of the Madrid dynasty of the 2010s, winning five Champions League titles and scoring a winning brace in the 2018 final, Bale was whistled and booed on every touch during his last appearance at the Bernabeu. He was the face of the most successful era at the world’s biggest club since the mid-1950s, but he left to a chorus of anger over frustrations as the second half of his career in Madrid played out. Alfredo Di Stefano, Iker Casillas, Karim Benzema, Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo, arguably the club’s greatest-ever player, were also subjected to the same treatment by the fans. This brand of accountability is hostile and ugly – something that football in the United States could and should continue to do without, but it adds crucial context to Bale’s comments.\nAs for the subject that spurred the question, there’s a certain amount of Bale’s answer that simply rings true. Living in a more relaxed football atmosphere is undoubtedly one of the reasons that attracted Messi to Inter Miami and MLS. His period at Paris Saint-Germain ended with fans gathered outside the club’s stadium, directing chants against him and his teammate Neymar, who also had fans gather outside his house. With Miami seemingly out of the playoff picture already, with a run of seven consecutive league defeats leaving them rooted to the bottom of the table (more on that later), Messi will have the opportunity face pressure without the same level of fan intensity after losses. In almost every other league in the world, he’d be playing with the stress of relegation. Without the consequence of underperforming, losing, by design, is not treated with the same jeopardy.\nAdvertisement\nSo, of course, it’s easier to lose in MLS. Eighteen of the league’s 29 teams will qualify for the playoffs, leaving an outside chance for Messi to inspire his side to an unlikely first MLS Cup in his first season despite its very poor start. Had Bale lost in the playoffs, he might have different memories of the pain of failing as an LAFC player.\nBut after his experience in Madrid, Americans knowing “how to lose” might not be a bad thing. And in any case, it’s not like it’s something that’s welcomed.\n– Elias Burke\nMiami is spiraling\nInter Miami’s season is at risk of being lost long before Messi even debuts.\nSaturday’s 4-1 loss to the Philadelphia Union — in which the Union scored four goals with only three shots on target — is a new nadir to an already frustrating on-field experience, with Miami languishing last place in the Eastern Conference with 15 points after 19 matches. The club is 11 points below the playoff line. The latest loss is their seventh in a row in league play.\nPhilly dominated Miami and capitalized on lackluster defending for their goals. Missing more starters than usual, Miami trotted out a back three featuring homegrown left back Noah Allen, homegrown center back Ian Fray and Christopher McVey as the only player with significant experience as a starter. Allen was making his second start of the season, Fray his third.\nIt’s more likely to get even worse before Messi comes. The roster is in bad need of reinforcements that won’t be able to come soon enough.\nMiami’s first-choice starting XI was already decimated with injury and holding assets open for summer moves, but Saturday’s lineup was without six starters of the already-struggling pre-Messi group. Key midfielders Gregore, Jean Mota and Corentin Jean are already out with long-term injuries. In addition to that, Miami is currently without starting center back Kamal Miller (Canada) and right back DeAndre Yedlin (United States) while on international duty at the CONCACAF Gold Cup. Ukrainian center back Sergii Kryvtsov was unavailable due to a visa issue. And it got worse on Saturday, as left back Franco Negri exited the game with a knee injury.\nAdvertisement\nMiami has four more MLS games before its July 21 debut in the Leagues Cup, which The Athletic has reported is the date the club is targeting for Messi to make his debut. Those remaining games are: home to Austin FC, home to Columbus Crew, away to D.C. United and away to St. Louis City SC. All four teams are above the playoff line.\nThe United States and Canada are two favorites in the Gold Cup, meaning Yedlin and Miller will likely be in that tournament for the long haul, and thus could miss all four of those games.\nThe LA Galaxy couldn’t overcome a poor start to the season to make the playoffs in 2007 when David Beckham arrived midseason. The outlook for Miami isn’t rosy as they try to stay within touching distance of the playoff line when Messi arrives.\nBy the time Messi debuts, Miami will have just 12 league games left and likely will need to play at a pace of more than two points per game to even make the play-in round of the playoffs. The only team in MLS currently playing at a pace of two points per game or better is FC Cincinnati, the Supporters’ Shield leaders (and even FCC is far from perfect, as you’ll soon read).\n-Tom Bogert\nSluggish from Cincinnati\nSpeaking of Cincy, MLS’ highest-flying side went out against D.C. United on Saturday night and laid an egg, losing its first match in 10 games. FCC was overwhelmed by United in the opening 45 minutes and never really found its way back into the match, falling 3-0.\nThe result isn’t great in isolation, but there’s probably little reason to worry overall for fans of Cincinnati. Pat Noonan’s side was playing on short rest and against one of the only teams in the league that wasn’t forced to play a midweek match in the run-up to this weekend’s action. The reasons behind Saturday’s loss were pretty straightforward: Cincy got punished for a handful of defensive lapses and didn’t do well enough with the few chances it had.\nAdvertisement\nD.C., on the other hand, remains a pleasant surprise of the 2023 MLS season. It’s a low bar, given the club’s struggles in recent years, but it’s worth some props. They rarely put together an exceptional performance but the club remains one of the league’s most consistent sides and stylistically, they continue to evolve.\nJust a week after his walkabouts cost United a pair of goals, Tyler Miller, MLS’ resident sweeper-keeper, was right out there again, flirting with the halfway line. In the runup to the match, Rooney had told the group that Miller would potentially be D.C.’s most important player against Cincinnati. He wasn’t entirely wrong.\nCincy head coach Pat Noonan had plenty of praise for Wayne Rooney’s group after the loss.\n“Their size along the backline is a strength,” said Noonan. “Those guys typically eat up everything in the air and they’re dangerous on set pieces. They defended the box really well. Anything that was in the air they typically eat up, and even the balls where we were looking to arrive late with some of our midfielders, or even our forwards coming off of the center backs, they ate up those spaces as well with (Chris) Durkin and (Lewis) O’Brien. They just defended the box in a really strong way. It’s a strength of their group.”\nOn Saturday, D.C. benefitted from some clever play by a handful of players on the field — Andy Najar, O’Brien and Durkin among them. As has been the case in so many other games this year, though, D.C.’s attack centered mostly around getting the ball to former Crystal Palace forward Christian Benteke, who has continued to shine in front of goal and in hold-up play.\n“You can be strong for 85% of the game against Benteke, but he has the ability to find the moments to bring the ball down,” said Noonan. “He’s just a real presence in direct play that allows runs in behind or, if they’re moving forward as a group, it becomes second balls. If you’re not successful in those moments, because you’re pressing high up the field, then they’re able to face goal and it just becomes a real challenge.”\nYou actually do need those badges\nMichael Bradley is the son of an influential U.S. coach, has long had a cerebral approach to the game, and has been a leader in the locker room for the USMNT and now for years with Toronto FC. He’s also on the tail end of his playing career at 35 years old.\nAdvertisement\nAll that considered, it’s probably not surprising at all to see that he took some time recently to do a coaching course en route to getting his badges:\nTantos partidos en contra que la rivalidad se queda siempre en la cancha\nUn placer poder haber compartido contigo el curso de entrenador @FAWales\nAbrazo grande amigo pic.twitter.com/E8tYXP0NPN— Efraín Juárez (@efrajuarez) June 23, 2023\nIn The Athletic’s report on internal dysfunction at Toronto FC earlier this year, one former Toronto FC player said of Bradley: “He’s not a teammate, he’s an assistant coach.”\nSoon enough, he could literally be both.\nOne good read\nThe summer transfer window opens a week from Wednesday. While no name will top Lionel Messi, every team is working behind the scenes to improve their side’s form for the second half of the season, especially with Leagues Cup interrupting the summer slog of matches.\nTeams like the Chicago Fire will be looking to add pieces to boost it into the expanded playoffs. While they are set to sign Ivorian midfielder Ousmane Doumbia to a half-season designated player contract, sporting director Georg Heitz says the team will “possibly” add a second attacking player this summer.\nMeanwhile, teams like Cincinnati don’t need to bring anyone in. At the top of the Supporters’ Shield standings, with designated player and Gabon international Aaron Boupendza on the way, Cincy needs to keep key assets Brandon Vazquez and Luciano Acosta.\nTom Bogert ran through the needs of all 29 teams (even the LA Galaxy, who can’t sign anyone from abroad due to transfer sanctions this summer) ahead of the approaching window.\nOne weird thing\nThere was a real buzz in the crowd at Gillette Stadium on Saturday night. Fans were on high alert after a freakin’ swarm of bees invaded the north end of the stadium:\nI'm hearing that there has just been an incident with a large number of bees in the North End of Gillette. The stadium staff is now considering the possibility of having the players entrance through the tunnel on the South End if the bee problem persists. #NERevs\n— Gustavo Lopes 🇧🇷🇺🇸 (@TheGusLopes) June 24, 2023\nWe already know Gillette Stadium to be a safe space for people in strange costumes — the Revs remain the only team in MLS with what appears to be a militia — so the pair of beekeepers that the team somehow summoned in mere minutes blended right in.\nThere are legit beekeepers here @ Gillette Stadium. #NERevs | #MLS pic.twitter.com/875NDXblwn\n— Caleb Pongratz (@CalebPongratz10) June 24, 2023\nNever change, MLS.\n(Photo: Ira L.
