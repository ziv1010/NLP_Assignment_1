  "body_text": "Xavi Simons signs contract with Tottenham Hotspur; €60 million fee reported\nOranje international Xavi Simons has signed his contract for the English side Tottenham Hotspur. Simons’ current club, RB Leipzig, is receiving a 60 million euro fee for his services. The contract length is four years. The transfer will be announced after Simons has finalized his exit terms with Leipzig, according to The Athletic.\nIt was clear throughout the summer that Simons would likely be leaving RB Leipzig. The 22-year-old has played for the German team for three seasons, having been loaned to them initially by PSV in 2023. Leipzig experienced a disappointing 2024-25 season, finishing seventh. This meant that Simons would not be playing in European competition this season if he were to stay.\nThe 22-year-old will be playing in the UEFA Champions League with Tottenham. The club from London won the UEFA Europa League last season to earn a place in the main competition of European football, despite finishing in 17th place in the Premier League.\nIt seemed for most of the summer that Simons was going to move to Chelsea, with rumors linking him with the club for weeks, but last season’s UEFA Conference League winners did not make an offer for Simons in the end.\nIt is one of the highest fees ever spent on a Dutch player. Only Frenkie de Jong, Matthijs de Ligt, Virgil van Dijk, and Tijjani Reijnders cost more for their clubs.\nSimons will likely be making his debut for Tottenham after the international break. He was named in Ronald Koeman's squad to face Poland and Lithuania in September.",
