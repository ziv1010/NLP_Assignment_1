While Los Blancos could not win LaLiga, the Champions League or the Copa del Rey, the Gunners could not last the distance in the Premier League title race and also failed to trouble eventual champions Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-finals of the Champions League.\nBoth Madrid and Arsenal are aiming to reinforce their respective squad for next season and have their eyes on Zubimendi.\nThe Sociedad and Spain international is one of the best midfielders in the world and was close to a move to Liverpool last summer before he had a late change of heart.\nThe 26-year-old defensive midfielder seems extremely likely to leave this summer, though, with both Madrid and Arsenal determined to sign the Spanish star, who has a €60million (£50.5m, $68.5m) release clause in his contract.\nArsenal have long been working on a deal for Zubimendi and have a broad agreement in place with the midfielder.\nHowever, respected Spanish publication Marca reported on Monday morning that, while Zubimendi looked destined to join Arsenal, a call from Madrid has ‘changed everything’.\nThe Independent journalist Delaney has now brought an update on the situation, claiming that Sociedad would prefer to sell Zubimendi to Arsenal and believe that he will eventually end up at the Emirates Stadium despite Madrid showing a late interest in him.\nDelaney wrote on X: “The Real Madrid noise about Martin Zubimendi has surprised those at Real Sociedad – who would obviously prefer to sell to Arsenal, and still anticipate that’s what will happen. Arsenal were relaxed on it before the weekend. But this is exactly what Madrid do!”\nDelaney added: “All of the main details of the Arsenal deal were sorted Chelsea did think they had Huijsen but it was never as advanced as Zubimendi.”\nDON’T MISS 🌐 Top 10 most expensive Real Madrid signings of all time, with Ancelotti at the helm for four\nWhat Xabi Alonso has said about Zubimendi to Real Madrid\nMadrid are not one for waiting to bounce back after a disappointing season, and Los Blancos are already pressing ahead with a mini-rebuild of the squad.\nCarlo Ancelotti has already left to take charge of Brazil, with Xabi Alonso replacing the legendary Italian manager after parting ways with Bayer Leverkusen.\nMadrid have already signed England international right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool, while Spain international centre-back Dean Huijsen has joined from Bournemouth.\nAccording to Defensa Central, Alonso is now determined to sign Zubimendi and has told his Madrid bosses to get a deal done.\nThe report has claimed that this was the message from Alonso to Madrid about Zubimendi after the Nations League final between Portugal and Spain on Sunday: ‘If he comes, he’ll do very well, he’ll immediately perform at a high level.’\nPortugal won the final at the Allianz Arena on penalties, but Zubimendi scored for Spain in normal time.\nLatest Real Madrid news: Star to join, Sesko offer response\nOne of world football’s rising stars has agreed to join Madrid, according to a report.\nMadrid have responded to RB Leipzig after they were offered the chance to sign Benjamin Sesko in the summer transfer window.\nMeanwhile, Rodrygo has told Arsenal how much he wants in wages if he is to join from Madrid.",
