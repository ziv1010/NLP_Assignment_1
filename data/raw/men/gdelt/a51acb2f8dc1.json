Manchester United rushed Marcel Sabitzer over from Germany, which was exciting, and moving in (almost) the opposite direction, Joao Cancelo left Manchester for Munich, joining Bayern on loan and leaving Pep Guardiola behind. Bournemouth signed a Football Manager-stamped wunderkind. Southampton might have found some goals. Jorginho managed to move clubs without changing cities.\nBut what else happened? Or didn’t?\nAdvertisement\nHere’s a round-up of some of the other events of the day, most of them lost in the depths of that Todd Boehly-shaped shadow.\nNicolo Zaniolo makes no new friends\nZaniolo has been running down his contract, much to the chagrin of Roma’s high brass. With only 18 months left, it was widely assumed he’d leave in this window and, with a decent enough reputation and a watchable YouTube compilation, the chances were that an English club would find some money they didn’t know what to do with and pay Roma’s £30million ($37m) asking price.\nTottenham apparently had a bit of a glance but were put off by the fee, and by the time the sun was setting on another transfer window, Zaniolo’s only viable option was Bournemouth — and he didn’t really fancy that.\nAnd it would have been fine had he not burnt all of his Roma bridges before that happened. The fans have been booing him for some time but have taken against him rather more determinedly (see below) since it became known he wanted to leave. Unusually, Jose Mourinho also had his say, confirming to the Italian media over the weekend that the player was eager to leave. All of which leaves Zaniolo stuck on the shelf looking like an Easter Egg in July.\nRoma's Curva Sud to Nicolo Zaniolo:\n\"Zaniolo, traitor and sh** without honour.\"\n(via Calciomercato) pic.twitter.com/yvy6yzbjaP\n— Get Italian Football News (@_GIFN) January 29, 2023\nSalomon Rondon to River Plate\nLast seen being guilty by association with Rafa Benitez at Everton, Rondon rather unexpectedly turned up at El Monumental on Monday to sign for River Plate.\nWhat a career that is by the way. Forgetting the football for a second, Rondon’s journey has allowed him to make his home in, among other places, Maracay, Malaga, Saint Petersburg, Newcastle, Moscow, Liverpool and now Buenos Aires. Imagine his Instagram account.\nAdvertisement\nHakim Ziyech goes to Paris. Might not come back\nBig clubs being snarky with each other usually makes for fun and it’s fair to say Paris Saint-Germain were none too pleased with Chelsea after the collapse of Ziyech’s loan move.\nOn Tuesday morning, Ziyech’s move seemed like a formality. Chelsea had signed All The Footballers and needed to de-clutter their squad in a hurry; PSG were hardly about to run out of funds. This was very much a tap-in.\nHowever… take a deep breath, make a cup of tea and read the inside story of Chelsea’s transfer window.\nWycombe to Aberdeen to… Milton Keynes?\nA big thanks to The Athletic’s new arrival Duncan Alexander for this one, who points us toward centre-back Anthony Stewart. Stewart has had quite the few weeks. First, he was sent off for the tackle below when he captained Aberdeen to defeat in the Scottish League Cup semi-final against Rangers. Then, he was part of the team that lost 1-0 to sixth-tier Darvel in the Scottish Cup fourth round and on the receiving end of a 6-0 going-over by Hibernian five days later — a loss that saw his manager sacked in the immediate aftermath. Finally, on deadline day itself, he was packed off to MK Dons on loan.\nAn eventful spell in Scotland, then. Especially when you consider Stewart only joined Aberdeen from Wycombe Wanderers in the summer.\nAberdeen captain Anthony Stewart is shown a straight red card for this tackle on Rangers star Fashion Sakala 🟥 pic.twitter.com/oJIlqoXooQ\n— Football Scotland (@Football_Scot) January 15, 2023\nEverton fans at Finch Farm\nThere are only two reasons supporters turn up to a training ground on the day the transfer window shuts. One good, one bad — and no prizes for guessing the mood when Everton fans gathered at Finch Farm on Tuesday evening.\nIn a spectacular crescendo to what had already been a disastrous month — on the pitch, off the pitch, in footballing terms and in almost every other capacity — Everton chairman Farhad Moshiri promised the club would ‘get the striker they need’ before the passing of the deadline.\nThey didn’t, of course. Olivier Giroud presumably raised one of his perfect eyebrows in response to Everton’s interest, while suggested deals for Lucas Moura and Arnaut Danjuma never materialised. This ultimately leaves new manager Sean Dyche with a haunted-looking Dominic Calvert-Lewin, an out-of-place Neal Maupay and that statue of Dixie Dean as his main attacking weapons against the drop.\nAdvertisement\nAnd they’ve also sold Anthony Gordon to Newcastle — without managing to reinvest a penny of what they received.\nRB Leipzig not sensing the mood\nFor much of the winter, the chatter in Germany has been that Isco, currently the game’s premier wandering free agent, might sign for Union Berlin. For a few tantalising hours on deadline day, it looked like it actually might happen, too. Isco was pictured in Kopenick and the expectation was that he would sign on to help Urs Fischer’s side with an unlikely charge towards the Champions League.\nAlas, it fell apart — much to the apparent mirth of RB Leipzig, who thought this was a good idea:\nTradition?\n— 1. FC Union Berlin (@fcunion) January 31, 2023\nAt least Mainz had a nice time…\n🍿🍿🍿\n— 1. FSV Mainz 05 (@1FSVMainz05) January 31, 2023\nFrom Luton to Lecce\nCongratulations to Ed McJannet, who completed the unlikely journey from Luton’s academy to Lecce on Tuesday, despite having yet to make his senior debut. The young midfielder has represented Ireland at youth level and will join the small community of Irish players who are making names for themselves in Italian football. John Ryan is currently at Sassuolo, Festy Ebosele and James Abankwah are in the Pozzo network at Udinese and Cathal Heffernan left Cork City last year to join AC Milan’s academy.\nMarco van Ginkel finally goes home\nA happy ending for the injury-plagued Van Ginkel, who has spent much of the past decade under the banner of Chelsea’s loan army.\nVan Ginkel only officially left Chelsea in 2021, trading his out-on-loan membership card for a less transient life at PSV Eindhoven (where he’d previously been on loan, of course). Eighteen months on and having not really established himself, he’s returned to Vitesse, where he first graduated as a player and from where Chelsea signed him for £8million in 2013.\nAdvertisement\n… and so does Shinji Kagawa\nAnd another welcome home, this time for Kagawa. Even after all these years, the memory of those glorious two Jurgen Klopp-powered seasons at Borussia Dortmund remains bright and vivid, serving as a cautionary tale about not being too quick to trade things away. Manchester United wasn’t right for him, his return to Dortmund was never quite the same and his career was left a little unfulfilled. A lovely player, no doubt, but not for as long as most of us would have liked.\nAnyway, having meandered across Greek, Turkish and Spanish football in the years since, he was most recently one of the elder statesmen among Belgian club Sint-Truidense’s clutch of Japanese players. They’ve been targeting players from that country for some time: Daichi Kamada had a loan there before making it at Eintracht Frankfurt, Takehiro Tomiyasu was there prior to joining Bologna and Premier League winner Shinji Okazaki is still playing for them now.\nKagawa is now heading back to Japan, though. Thirteen years after leaving for Germany, he’s returned to Cerezo Osaka.\n(Top photo: Antonietta Baldassarre/Insidefoto/LightRocket via Getty Images)",
