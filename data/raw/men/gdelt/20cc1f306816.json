An Absolute goal fest - with both side's finding the back of the net of multiple occasions.\nGOAL FOR THE SAUDI SIDE! Anderson Talisca finds the back of the net with just 60 seconds left on the clock. His impressive strike beat Donnaruma on the right-hand-side.\n92mins: Chance for the Saudi side! Andre Carillo picks up the ball just outside the box and unleashes an absolute rocket! However, it went just over the bar.\n90mins: Four minutes have been added. However, it won't be enough to get them a win against Paris Saint-Germain this evening.\n90mins: Chance for the Saudi side! The home team worked the ball around the edge of the box before finding Pereira. He took a touch and fired it towards goal. However, he couldn't quite keep it down.\n89mins: The attention appears to have turned to the bench and the big screen. Mbappe, Messi and others are being shown on the big screen and the fans are going mad. The PSG players can't help but smile and give a little wave.\n87mins: More subs have been made. Aldawsari and Luiz Gustavo come off for Abdullah Otayf and Sami Al-Najei. While, Vitinha – who came on as a substitute – has come back off for Ayman Kari.\n84mins: A good effort from the Saudi side. Anderson Talisca attempted to curl it into the top left-hand-corner. However, it just skimmed over the cross bar.\n83mins: Free-kick for the Saudi side on the edge of the box as Vitinha takes out Anderson Talisca. This could be their chance to get back on the scoresheet.\n81mins: Things are getting a little scrappy in the midfield at the moment. PSG are turning possession over far too easily. While the Saudi side are doing well to ping it around. However, I doubt it's enough to get them back into this game.\n78mins: GOAL FOR PSG! Surely that is game over now? What a well taken strike too. PSG played a cross-field pass to Ekitike. The 20-year-old won the foot race with his defender and fired the ball into the roof of the net.\n74mins: HUGE CHANCE FOR THE SAUDI SIDE! Andre Carillo has got to do better there. The Saudi side pick the ball up in the middle of the pitch and is played out wide to the winger. He takes one too many touches and fires it past the far post. That should have been a goal.\n72mins: The Saudi side have taken advantage of PSG's stars subbing off. They look dangerous on the counter and have had more possession in the final third. However, they are lacking the end product.\n69mins: Ambitious effort from Vitinha but you love to see it. The PSG star saw the goalkeeper off his line and decided to go for goal from distance. However, Mohamed Al Owais did well to track back and get a hand to it.\n66mins: Huge chance! Anderson Talisca, the former Benfica and Besiktas player, comes close to scoring. He used his left-foot to unleash a shot at goal - however, the keeper made the save.\n65mins: A little insight into some of the subs... Mohamed Kanno, Andre Carrillo and Matheus Pereira have all come on. While Abdullah Al-Khaibari and Martinez have all come off.\n63mins: Here come the subs. The first one to come off is Ronaldo. He looks disappointed as I am sure he was gunning for a hat-trick. However, he's not the only one to be taken off. PSG have just taken Messi off too.\n60mins: GOAL FOR PSG! This time it was Mbappe who took the spot-kick for PSG. He took a cool, calm and collected run up before firing it into the bottom right-corner.\n58mins: PENALTY TO PSG! The ball way played across the top of the box to Messi. He took a touch and curled the ball towards the far post. However, it took a deflection off Al Bulauhi's arm.\n56mins: GOAL FOR THE SAUDI SIDE! The ball is played into the near post from a corner and Jang gets in front of Ramos to poke it home. You just couldn't write this could you!\n55mins: SAVE OFF THE LINE FROM RAMOS! Ronaldo unleashed an absolute rocket towards the back post, it looked as though it was going in but Ramos did well to get himself in the way and volley it out.\n54mins: GOAL FOR PSG! This time it Ramos who finds the back of the net. However, credit for the goal has to go to Mbappe. He picked up the ball down the left-hand-side, beat one player before taking on another. Some quick footwork saw him break into the box and tee-up Ramos - who tapped it home from three yards out.\n52mins: PSG's first main chance of the second half comes from Mbappe, who unleashes a shot from just outside the area. The keeper does well to palm it away but concedes a corner.\n50mins: The Saudi side got lucky there! Messi looked as though he was through on goal there for a second. However, the flag went up for offside.\nThe Saudi side will be thankful for the flag as Alowais came flying out to meet the Argentine and appeared to handle the ball outside his own area!\nThat could have been a free-kick and a potential red card!\n48mins: PSG made some changes. Sanches and Marquinhos have come off for Vitinha and Danilo Pereira.\nHUGE CHANCE FOR THE SAUDI SIDE! The ball is floated into the middle of the box,Gonzalo Martinez gets his head on it but Navas pulls off a sensational save to keep it out.\n47mins: The Saudi win the first corner of the second half inside two minutes after a mistake from Navas.\nAnd... we are back underway. If the first half is anything to go by, this is bound to be an exciting second half of action.\nWow, what a half of football that has been. Let just recap what took place in the first half this evening:\nMessi scored the opening goal of the game inside three minutes\nMbappe scored but had his goal ruled out as he was offside\nRonaldo equalises from the penalty spot after being clipped in the head\nBernat was sent off for PSG after taking his player out\nMarrquinhos scores for PSG to restore their lead\nNeymar was awarded a penalty but missed after a terrible spot kick\nRonaldo equalises in the dying seconds of the first half\n45+6mins: RONALDO SCORES AN EQUALISER! Wow, what a first half of football this has been. The ball was floated into the box from the left-hand-side. Ronaldo rose above everyone and headed it onto the post. However, it rebounded back into the middle of the box. PSG were caught watching, while Ronaldo pounced to tap it home.\n45+5mins: Ronaldo wins a free-kick in a VERY dangerous area. However, he drills his strike straight into the wall. It did rebound back out but his second strike was also blocked.\n45+4mins: PSG MISS FROM THE PENALTY SPOT! That was an awful penalty from Neymar. He took a slow run up - hoping the goalkeeper was going to move. However, he didn't. Neymar then tried to tuck it into the bottom right corner... but his strike had next to no power. It was an easy save!\nPSG ARE AWARDED A PENALTY!\n45mins: Neymar is calling for a penalty! And, he could get it as the referee is heading over to the pitch-side monitor to have a look after the Brazilian star was clipped inside the box.\nPSG RESTORE THEIR LEAD! PSG played the ball around the edge of the box and made the Saudi side work hard defensively. Mbappe saw an opening and floated the ball into the middle of the box for Marrquinhos, who tapped it home.\n39mins: Juan Bernat is awarded a RED CARD! Things are going from bad to worse for Paris Saint-Germain as Bernat has been sent off for chopping down Salem Al Dawsari - who was through on goal.\n37mins: Mbappe is electric down that left-hand-side. He just picked up the ball and bypassed three players before pulling it back inside the box. However, his team-mates were nowhere to be seen.\n35mins: Now we have a game on our hands! Ronaldo was never going to let Messi get away with an easy victory was he...\nRONALDO SCORES FROM THE PENALTY SPOT! Ronaldo equalises just 30 minutes after Messi gave PSG the lead. The former Manchester United forward hammered the ball home from the penalty spot, firing it into the top right-hand corner.\nNavas has been awarded a yellow card for clipping Ronaldo in the head. The Saudi side have also been awarded a penalty for the incident! Could Ronaldo equalise just 30 minutes after Messi found the back of the net?\n33mins: The Saudi were awarded a free-kick on the right-hand-side. They floated the ball into the middle of the box to Ronaldo - who was running in at pace to head the ball. Navas came flying out and appeared to clip the former Manchester United star. Ronaldo has gone down and it looks like a penalty is being given...\n28mins: Fantastic footwork from Neymar. He picked up the ball just outside of the box on the left-hand-side. He beat two players before being tackled by about three players...\n27mins: PSG do very little with their corner and the Saudi side clear it with ease. However, the Ligue 1 side managed to regain possession just outside the box.\n26mins: Messi goes for goal from range. It was an impressive strike, he connected with it beautifully but the goalkeeper tipped it wide. As a result, PSG are awarded a corner.\nThe flag has gone up! No goal. That was very close but it was the right call. Mbappe will be disappointed about that one... but I have a feeling he may get another chance...\nGOAL FOR PSG! The ball was floated into Mbappe behind the Saudi defence from the right-hand-side. The 24-year-old did well to latch onto the pass and round the goalkeeper to find the back of the net.\nCHANCE FOR THE SAUDI SIDE AND RONALDO IS CALLING FOR A PENALTY! The former Manchester United star picked up the ball on the right-hand-side of the box and carried it towards the penalty spot. However, he lost control of it and the goal keeper came out to collect it. Ronaldo is appealing for a penalty as he says his heel was clipped... but the ref waves for play to continue.\n20mins: Another chance for PSG! It's only a matter of time before they put one of these opportunities in.\n19mins: A little bit of showboating from Ronaldo there. He picks up the ball in the middle of the pitch, holds it up to attract his defender before executing a no-look back heel into Luis Gustavo’s path.\n18mins: CHANCE FOR PSG! Fabian dinks the ball to Mbappe - who collects it on the left-hand-side, breaks into the box and plays a wonderful ball across the goal mouth to Neymar running in. However, the Brazilian couldn't quite get a touch on it despite sliding.\n16mins: Alowais pulls off an impressive save to deny Neymar after a string of good passes saw PSG work their way into the box.\n14mins: The Saudi side earn themselves another free-kick just outside the box. It is Ronaldo who stands over it. However, the former Manchester United star couldn't quite keep it down and send it flying past the post.\n13mins: The Saudi side test Navas once again after a shot if fired off from distance. However, he did well to get down in time and palm it away from danger.\n10mins: Ronaldo is absolutely loving it out there. He just picked the ball up from the left-hand-side, beat Carlos Soler with a nutmeg before cutting in field. He went to pass it on before his effort was blocked by a hand ball from Ramos. As a result, PSG are awarded a free-kick.\n9mins: Another chance for the Saudi side! The ball shipped out to the right and then played into the centre of the box for Ronaldo. However, the cross didn't have enough on it and PSG headed it clear.\n7mins: PSG earn themselves a corner but do very little with it. However, they have maintained possession around the edge of the Saudi's box.\n5mins: First big chance for Ronaldo! The ball is floated through to him on the left-hand-side.

Messi ran in behind and connected well with the ball to slot it past the goalkeeper, who came rushing out to close him down.\n2mins: Messi and Ronaldo go head-to-head for the first time! Messi picked up the ball in the middle of the pitch and darted forwards. However, Ronaldo did well to track back and make an important tackle.\n1min: The fans are in good voice. Messi and Ronaldo both received large cheers when taking their first touch of the game.\n1min: PSG look comfortable in possession. They are playing short sharp passes in and out of the pockets. The Saudi side are having to do a lot of leg-work to contain them.\nWe are underway at the King Fahd International Stadium. It is Paris Saint-Germain who kick things off. I have a feeling we could be in for a good one this evening!\nPSG and Saudi All-Star XI are standing together for a quick picture before getting underway. Ronaldo is seen standing in between several PSG players.\nOkay, this is all getting a bit much now. Let's get on with the football and watch Ronaldo vs Messi in action...\nWhat a setting. The fans are roaring, there are flames shooting out of the ground and the music is blaring. Not a bad debut for Ronaldo in Saudi eh?\nWe are just moments away from kick-off. Ronaldo is chatting away to the PSG players - shaking hands and hugging some of his former team-mates. He even hugged Messi...\nSaudi: Ospina; Al Boleahi, Al Burayk, Al Juwayr, Cuellar, Konan; Gonzalez; Ighalo, Marega, Cristiano Ronaldo, Talisca\nPSG: Keylor Navas, Achraf Hakimi, Marquinhos, Sergio Ramos, Juan Bernat, Fabian Ruiz, Carlos Soler, Renato Sanches, Neymar Jr, Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe\nSaudi XI: Ospina; Al Boleahi, Al Burayk, Al Juwayr, Cuellar, Konan; Gonzalez; Ighalo, Marega, Cristiano Ronaldo, Talisca\nPSG have just announced they will be wearing their new 'fourth kit' for the first time tonight, which you can see below.\nThe kit has been launched in collaboration with the Jordan Brand and is claimed to 'highlight the club's commitment to the city of Paris'.\n'Innovative and daring, the jersey pays tribute to the city of light,' PSG have said. 'The black colour recalls the nights of the big games at the Parc des Princes.\n'The jersey is crossed by yellow beams, whose arrangement pays a subtle tribute to the illuminated beams of the most beautiful monument of the capital, the Eiffel Tower, which sits proudly on the club's logo. The shirt has a distinctly electric look that conveys a sense of speed.'\nOkay...\nI mentioned earlier that this could be the final meeting between Messi and Ronaldo, but not in Saudi Arabian clubs have their say.\nNumerous reports have suggested Saudi sides are keen on bringing Argentina's World Cup winning captain to the nation.\nThere were rumours last week that Al-Hilal were willing to fork out £245million for the Argentine star, with Al-Ittihad now having reportedly entered the fray.\nMessi is believed to have assured PSG he will sign an extension to his contract, but certainly one to watch....\nIncredibly a Saudi businessman has paid more than £2million to watch today's friendly, which is just two hours away.\nReal estate mogul Mushref al-Ghamdi shelled out £2.2m at auction for a VIP ticket for the game which will allow him to meet to the likes of Ronaldo and Messi.\nHe will also be permitted to attend the winner’s ceremony and enter the dressing rooms.\nUseful update from the French champions as they inform us the squad are on route to the stadium ahead of the match.\nAccording to ESPN, the match had two million online ticket requests, with the game selling out within minutes of going on sale.\nAn extraordinary demand to watch this friendly at the 68,752-capacity venue.\nThe latest installment of the Ronaldo and Messi story is probably the hardest to have predicted in truth as not many - maybe even Ronaldo himself - would have expected the Portuguese great to be plying his trade in Saudi Arabia.\nThe question is whether this could be the final time the pair share the same pitch together, with their careers heading towards a conclusion.\nRemarkably their last meeting came in December 2020, when Barcelona faced Juventus in the Champions League group stages.\nIt was Ronaldo who triumphed that night, scoring a brace in a 3-0 win at the Nou Camp.\nA lot has happened since then... including one World Cup win, some stunning transfers and a one very explosive television interview.\nPSG are on what has been labelled a mid-season tour in the Middle East, with the French champions having trained in Qatar yesterday before completing the trip to Riyadh today.\nAccording to reports, PSG are in line to receive a huge fee of £8.8million for playing a one-off friendly.\nThe significant fee comes as a warm welcome for Christophe Galtier's side, who posted a year-long deficit of £325million.\nIt may also serve as a good distraction after their shock 1-0 loss to Rennes.\nREAD MORE\nPSG and Saudi All-Star XI are scheduled to kick off at 5pm GMT.\nThe match will be taking place at the King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh, which has hosted several high-profile matches in the past week.\nThe stadium hosted Barcelona's 3-1 win over Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup final, before Inter overcame AC Milan in the Italian Super Cup final yesterday.\nLionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe and the rest of the PSG squad touched down earlier today ahead of the friendly.\nIt is fair to say the French champions enjoyed a warm welcome as they received flowers after touching down on the tarmac.\nWorld Cup winner Lionel Messi, of course, was made an ambassador for the Saudi Arabia Tourist Board last May.\nWith fans having been forced to wait for Ronaldo to make his bow in Saudi Arabia, they will have been relieved to have had his involvement today all but confirmed by the sight of the star being given the captain's armband for the match.\nRonaldo was given the armband earlier this week.\nThe 37-year-old will lead out the All-Star side which includes players from Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal.\nThe build-up to the friendly has been dominated by Ronaldo, with the Portuguese legend set to feature for the first time since putting pen to paper on his jaw-dropping £175m-a-year contract at Al-Nassr.\nIn case you somehow missed it, the switch followed Ronaldo's acrimonous departure from Manchester United following his explosive interview with Piers Morgan.\nRonaldo has been forced to wait to make his debut in Saudi Arabia after being forced to sit out two matches for knocking a phone out of an Everton fan's hand at Goodison Park while playing for United.\nHello and welcome to Sportsmail's live blog as PSG prepare to face a Saudi All-star XI in Riyadh.\nAll eyes will be on Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in Saudi Arabia with the pair meeting for what is likely to be one of the final times in their career.\nToday's friendly will be the first time Ronaldo has played since completing his stunning move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr, which has led to him being included in the all-star team.\nMost watched Sport videos\n- Disgusting drink act caught on camera at ICC T20 World Cup\n- Tiffany Salmond dazzles in red bikini at Bondi Icebergs\n- Team GB Winter Olympics hero: Matt Weston wins skeleton gold\n- IOC President in tears after Ukrainian athlete is kicked out\n- NBA player makes long-awaited debut after battle with cancer\n- Team USA skier Breezy Johnson gets engaged after crash\n- Aussie snowboarder Scotty James shows off his dance moves\n- Has VAR broken football?
