This partnership is a landmark deal in the new era for Chelsea Women with recently appointed Head Coach, Sonia Bompastor joining in the summer.\nThis collaboration is the perfect next step in Threes continued support and commitment to the womens game. From players to coaches and all those across the wider sports industry, Three recognises and rewards women at the heart of the game through the WeSeeYou Network a national platform founded in partnership with Chelsea in 2022. The initiative encourages those with a passion for football to recognise, celebrate and connect through a series of amazing experiences and mentorships that will further their personal development.\nThe partnership news follows Chelseas recent announcement of their long-term strategic plan to accelerate the growth of Chelsea Women where a repositioning will see dedicated resources, management and commercial leadership, which will focus solely on the growth and success of the womens team. This new approach will enable Chelsea Women to harness the full potential of the opportunity for womens football, mirroring Threes work-to-date in highlighting and amplifying our women-led stories.\nAs a Principal Partner of Chelsea Women Threes logo will appear on all womens players training kit, matchday warm-up shirts and travel apparel in the coming season.

Following an incredible number of years building the WeSeeYou network, were excited to continue supporting, celebrating, and connecting women in sport, to help them reach their full potential.\nCasper Stylsvig, Chief Revenue Officer for Chelsea Football Club, said: We are thrilled to announce the renewal of our partnership with Three. Since we began working together in 2020, they have been a steadfast supporter of the club and created really impactful campaigns, like the Talk More Than Football mental health initiative.\nAfter an incredible end to the 2024 season and a seventh WSL title, along with the redefined resources and team in place to help the squad grow on and off the pitch, its the perfect time to reimagine the positioning of the partnership with a greater focus on our hugely successful Womens team.\nThree have consistently delivered best-in-class initiatives in the womens football community, and their new role as a Principal Partner of the team is a perfect illustration of our joint passion for the game and ambition to be innovative.\n*Based on analysis by Ookla® of Speedtest Intelligence® data for Q1-Q2 2024.
