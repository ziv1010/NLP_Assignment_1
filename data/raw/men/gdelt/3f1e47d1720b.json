Julian Alvarez – also a teammate of Messi at international level – was seventh, and Bernardo Silva was ninth as City players dominated the top 10.\nMessi was presented with the award by David Beckham, owner of Inter Miami and runner-up in the 1999 Ballon d’Or, and was in a reflective mood.\n“I couldn’t imagine having the career that I’ve had,” he said.\n“Everything that I’ve achieved. The fortune I’ve had playing for the best team in the world, the best team in history.\n\"It’s nice to win these individual trophies. To win the Copa America and then the World Cup, to get it done is amazing.”\nManchester City were also crowned the men’s team of the season after winning the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup last term.\nHaaland’s fine season saw him win the Gerd Muller Trophy for the world’s top-scoring striker after a record 56 goals last season.\nWomen’s Ballon d’Or winner Bonmati won a league and Champions League double before playing a pivotal role in Spain’s World Cup success, where she was also awarded the Golden Ball.\n“This is a dream for me,” she said.\n“I have really good players by my side. To reach three straight Champions League finals as a club is special. Let’s hope there’s much more to come.”\nBonmati beat Chelsea and Australia striker Sam Kerr into second place, with her Spain and Barcelona team-mate Salma Paralluelo coming third.\nTwo of England’s Lionesses who reached the World Cup final made the top 10, with Manchester United goalkeeper Mary Earps fifth and Rachel Daly of Aston Villa 10th.\nAston Villa and Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez won the Lev Yashin Trophy for goalkeeper of the year after his starring role in his nation’s World Cup win.\nEngland international Jude Bellingham’s meteoric rise continued as he was voted the Kopa Award winner for the best under-21 player in the world.\nThe Real Madrid and England midfielder picked up the trophy after he finished 18th for the main award.\nBellingham, 20, has hit 13 goals in 13 appearances since moving to Madrid in the summer, including a double to lead Real to victory in his first el clasico against Barcelona on Saturday.\nBut his success was for last season, when he shone for Borussia Dortmund and England.\nEngland captain Harry Kane was 19th, with Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka coming 24th – while Mohamed Salah of Liverpool just missed out on the top 10 in 11th place.",
