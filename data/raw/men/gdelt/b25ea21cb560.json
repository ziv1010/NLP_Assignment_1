Of course, mathematically it’s not, but I think the title is done. Our job between now and the end of the season is to keep pushing until the end, but I think it will be very difficult,\" Hayes said in a post-match interview.\nThe title-chasing Blues took an early lead through Aggie Beever-Jones and looked to be cruising, but Sophie Roman Haug equalised six minutes after the break and a Gemma Bonner header in the 66th minute put the home side in front.\nBeever-Jones struck again to level for Chelsea, but Liverpool substitute Leanne Kiernan put the Reds ahead again a minute later to set up a grandstand finish. Liverpool keeper Teagan Micah turned the ball into her own net to throw Chelsea a lifeline, but the Merseysiders battled back and took the lead once again as Bonner netted her second of the night to stun the visitors and send them home needing favours from other teams if they are to win the league.\n\"What a fantastic game of football, not good for my heart that’s for sure,\" Liverpool manager Matt Beard beamed after the final whistle.\n\"When you go in front and get pegged back against a team like Chelsea, to keep going and keep scoring is great testament to the group,\" he added.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
