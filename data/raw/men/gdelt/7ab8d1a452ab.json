  "body_text": "Borussia Dortmund's valuation of Chelsea target revealed\n- Chelsea linked with move for Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Gittens in January\n- Bundesliga giants understood to be expecting summer interest\n- Bayern Munich also speculated as potential destination for 20-year-old\nChelsea and Bayern Munich target Jamie Gittens could be sold this summer by Borussia Dortmund, a report has claimed – but only if an interested party stumps up at least €80m.\nThe 20-year-old became a staple of gossip columns during the January transfer window, but at no point did it appear likely that Dortmund would entertain a mid-season sale.\nGittens has followed a similar career path to Jadon Sancho, leaving Manchester City at an early stage to improve the prospect of playing regular first-team football, and has reaped the rewards this season by becoming an integral part of Dortmund's team.\nA return of 11 goals in 34 appearances across all competitions represents a good, though not overly spectacular, season in a Dortmund side who have struggled for much of the 2024/25 season. Unexpectedly stuck in the Bundesliga's mid-table, Dortmund recently sacked head coach Nuri Sahin in favour of appointing Niko Kovac, but are at least making good progress in the Champions League, winning the first leg of their knockout play-off tie with Sporting CP 3-0.\nGittens has done well in both competitions, drawing links to Chelsea, Bayern and Manchester United at one stage, and German publication BILD state that Dortmund may be forced into selling a prized asset in order to offset likely financial losses caused by not qualifying for next season's Champions League.\nDortmund are prepared to take a firm stance over Gittens' price, however, with a potential sale likely to cost upwards of €80m (£66.7m) and potentially as much as €100m (£83.4m). That could make a departure for teammate Karim Adeyemi, who was on the radar of Napoli in January, more likely as he's valued at around half that figure.\nGoalkeeper Gregor Kobel is the third valuable asset named in the report – he has also drawn links to the Premier League after putting together a number of impressive performances in goal.\nWhat Gittens' preferred move would be is anybody's guess, but he does have links to Chelsea after playing for their academy as a youngster. The Blues have certainly shown an appetite to spend big in the past and remain in the market for forward reinforcements despite signing Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho in the summer.\nBayern have also splashed the cash, signing Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur in 2023 for €100m, and they do have a penchant for signing the best players of their domestic rivals.",
