We are blessed to have him. Harry Kane is playing in the Bundesliga, but he is one of the best English strikers in the Premier League.”\nThe 28-year-old now has a shot conversion rate of 21.2%, a shot accuracy of 48% and is averaging a Premier League goal every 147.7 minutes in 2025/26.\nIn comparison, he scored 57 goals in 239 Premier League appearances for Everton and was averaging a goal every 276.5 minutes for the Toffees.\nDespite only playing 15 games for Leeds, he is already having his joint-third-best season in the Premier League. His best campaign for Everton came in 2020/21 under Carlo Ancelotti, when he notched 16 goals in 33 Premier League appearances.\nIf he remains fully fit for the rest of the 2025/26 season, Calvert-Lewin is on track to better that tally.\nFollowing his brace against Palace, the striker has now netted for a fifth consecutive league game – the joint-longest run of any Leeds player in Premier League history.\nHe is the fourth Leeds United player to achieve that feat, following in the footsteps of Rod Wallace, Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink and Mark Viduka.\nThat run makes him one of the most in-form strikers in Europe as the likes of Haaland, Kylian Mbappe, Harry Kane and Robert Lewandowski can’t match his league goal return in the last three weeks.\nHis recent upturn in form has also coincided with Daniel Farke’s decision to stop using the 4-3-3 formation and switch to a 3-5-2 system.\n“I enjoy having bodies around me,” he said. “I think it can be a lonely role sometimes when you’re up there on your own, and sometimes you have to flick it on and chase it and do the dirty bits, really, which I’m more than capable of doing.\n“But when you get bodies around you, you can link play and get more of a feeling in the game. And I think that’s why I’ve had the success lately.”\nWhile Calvert-Lewin is thriving at Elland Road, Muniz has just one Premier League goal for Fulham this season and the two senior strikers at Everton have one goal each.\nHe is also outperforming a number of big-money summer signings. Benjamin Sesko, Viktor Gyokeres and Alexander Isak were bought for a combined total of £262.1million but have just nine Premier League goals between them.\nGet the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.\nA potential England recall\nDuring the 4-1 win over Crystal Palace, Leeds fans serenaded Calvert-Lewin with a chant of England’s number nine.\nThe striker has 11 caps and has netted four goals for England, but his most recent international appearance came in the 4-0 win over Ukraine in the Euro 2020 quarter-final.\nHarry Kane will undoubtedly be leading the line for Thomas Tuchel’s side at the World Cup next summer, but there’s a place in the squad for at least one more striker.\nOllie Watkins, Ivan Toney and Dominic Solanke have all played under Tuchel and Calvert-Lewin will be hoping to move above them in the pecking order\n“Of course, it’s the ultimate goal for any player to represent your country at a World Cup and it’s a World Cup year,” he said recently.\n“It’s always my dream to represent England and it’s the best feeling in the world to represent your country. Of course I’m like any young lad, growing up playing football, watching England and that’s still my dream.\n“I’d be surprised if playing for England wasn’t at the top of every English player’s list: playing for your country. That’s just a goal I’ve held from the last time I played for England.\n“That’s always been a belief I’ve maintained even when it’s seemed further away that I can compete at that level. I will give you the obvious cliched answer of my focus is on Leeds, my main objective is to keep the football club in the Premier League and that will always be my ultimate goal. That’s where my focus is.\n“In order to obtain the England objective is to keep performing the way I’ve been performing and I like that international football is a byproduct of that. Getting into squads is a byproduct of performing at club level.”\nTuchel has said he will video call players who are on the fringes of his squad before the friendlies at the end of March against Uruguay and Japan.\nIf Calvert-Lewin continues to find the back of the net at Leeds over the next three months, he will surely get a chance to add to his 11 England caps.",
