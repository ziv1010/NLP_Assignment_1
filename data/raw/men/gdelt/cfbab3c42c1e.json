Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nMadrid have made no secret of their interest in Yoro and have urged the player and his representative – super-agent Jorge Mendes – to wait for their call while they finalise their plans for the summer transfer window.\nThe report claims that Yoro has ‘always conveyed’ his desire to play at the Bernabeu, but the France Under-23 international may have to accept that Madrid will not match United from a purely financial perspective.\nThe newly crowned Champions League and La Liga winners view Yoro as a ‘strategic signing’ and recognise that it is impossible to avoid a bidding war for some players.\nParis Saint-Germain and Liverpool have also been linked with the 6 ft 3 teenager, who will soon enter into the last 12 months of his contract with Lille.\nAfter clinching Champions League qualification for next season, Lille head coach Fonseca argued that Yoro had everything in his locker to join a top club and become a world-class central defender.\n‘I believe Leny in the next year will be at one of the best clubs in Europe,’ he told reporters.\n‘He started here at 16 with us. He is very ambitious but very disciplined.\nMore Trending\n‘He grew a lot but he is a kid with a big maturity, with big quality.\n‘He’s very focused, very concentrated, he wants to learn every day.\n‘I have no doubt in modern football he will be one of the best central defenders in the world.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Chelsea perform U-turn and block two more players from featuring at the Olympics\nMORE: Enzo Maresca pushing Chelsea to sign one of his former Leicester City players",
