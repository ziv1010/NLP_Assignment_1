  "body_text": "Many players who like football sooner or later come to the fact that it is worth trying the series of FIFA football simulators. It all starts with a career mode with a gradual transition to online divisions, for battles against real opponents.\nWhen you first find yourself in FIFA Ultimate Team, or FUT, you will have to delve into its mechanics, which are fundamentally different from career mode and 1v1 competitions against an opponent on one PC.\nWhat you need to know about FUT mode\nThis is a complete and original mode that brings together a large number of football fans in a competitive mode and divides them into divisions according to skill level, so that it is always interesting to play.\nAn important role is played by fut coins – special coins for which players and random sets with players are purchased. Coins can be earned by playing matches, tournaments, and completing special quests from EA Sports.\nAll the extraction of game coins comes down to buying sets with random players of various values – this is how your team is strengthened. You simply open a large number of packs in the hope of pulling the right player and strengthening your main squad.\nSets can be of four types of value:\n- Bronze\n- Silver\n- Gold\n- Idols\nThe main difference between each of the packs is that they get the same players, but with different sets of characteristics – the larger and more valuable the pack, the more likely it is to get a player of the highest category.\nThe exception is the idol set, it contains world football stars who have achieved results in its entire history and can only be obtained from this set.\nDivisions\nThe most frequent matches you will play are games against other players in a classic match format with the possibility of a draw.\nWins, losses and games with a tie will bring you points, which will determine your level of play, increase or decrease in rank and admission to events and tournaments that start with the selection of top contenders depending on their contribution to matches during the week.\nTo get into a regular tournament, which will help replenish the playing squad with golden cards of football players, you need to score at least 1250 points and pass the qualification, for which you can already get prizes, even with an absolutely unsatisfactory result.\nFIFA Champions\nThis is the first qualifying stage for the weekend tournament and a great opportunity to practice against opponents of various skill levels and is guaranteed to earn new golden cards for football players, even in the event of a complete defeat and elimination from the competition this time.\nYou have to play 10 games against absolutely random opponents. If within the division you are matched with opponents suitable for the rank, then in Champions mode you will have to play against a variety of opponents.\nIf you manage to win at least four matches, then you will get the right to try your hand at the final stage – the Weekend League.\nThe more victories you can win in this stage, the more you will be able to get additional gold sets, but even if you lose all matches, you will still receive incentive cards, but you will leave the tournament.\nWeekend League\nHaving beaten the required minimum of winning matches against random opponents, you will receive a pass to the Weekend League – the main event of the weekend, where the best make their way and where each match will be comparable to the Champions League final.\nYou will be waiting for 20 duels against random opponents who have gone through a severe meat grinder of selective stages and are ready to choose the next victories to receive the best rewards.\nEach match will move you forward on the scale of rewards if you achieve victory. There can be no draw, and defeat gives minimal advancement.\nIf the match ends tied, then overtime will start first, and then everything will go to a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner, if this was not done earlier.\nMoments\nA mode that will help you earn extra coins in the course of completing game situations that EA Sports have come up with for you.\nThese can be retrospectives of legendary matches, where you need to perform an action that brought victory in it with strict observance of all prescribed conditions, or simply interesting situations that need to be solved.\nFor example, to score a goal after a corner kick from a cross.\nIt is important to fulfill all the conditions of the task, otherwise the event will be restarted.\nRelatively speaking, if the ball is intercepted, scored in any other way, or sold after a rally between the players, then all this will be regarded as a failure.\nFor the victory and the exact fulfillment of the conditions, you will receive FIFA coins.\nSquad Challenges\nThis is an interesting mode in which you can feel like a new coach in a football team, who must interact with the board of directors and strictly follow their instructions, otherwise – dismissal.\nThis may be a condition – to find and release on the field three attackers from Italy with a running speed of at least 75 and other meticulous requests and requirements, by fulfilling which you will replenish your capital to strengthen the club.\nComplete tasks\nEvery week, all players in FIFA 23 online mode will receive accumulative tasks that will bring rewards in the form of game coins.\nTasks usually relate to intra-match, or near-game activities.\nFor example, you may be asked to score 10 goals. This task does not have to be completed in one duel, especially considering that this is practically impossible. It is important to have time to complete the assignment before the task reload time, otherwise you simply will not receive rewards, even if you stop at 9 out of 10 goals.\nTactics to strengthen your team\nSince you start your season with random performers who play under the emblem of the selected club, you need to immediately start strengthening your playing squad.\nIt’s best to start with the Bronze Packs, as they are the cheapest and most stable, and gradually build up your playset with the Silver and Gold Packs.\nBy playing many matches and making your way into tournaments, you can well replenish your wallet with game coins and strive for idol class cards, or at least gold ones.\nWhen you have enough savings in FIFA coins, you can visit the transfer window and view all the players offered for sale, just like in real football, but it is worth considering that other gamers independently set prices for performers depending on their rarity and you need to be prepared to pay a fair price.",
