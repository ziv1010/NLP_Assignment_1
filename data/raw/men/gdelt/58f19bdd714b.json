I'm happy to have the team win. Let's take the positive and go again,\" said Rugani to Sky Sport.\n\"I realised where the ball was going, I stretched for it and I managed to reach it.\"\nSunday's win made Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri the first in Serie A history to get more than a thousand points, his total now at 1,002 according to statistics provider Opta.\nInter can re-establish their nine-point lead later on Sunday when they face Lecce.\nLeaders Inter could go into next weekend's fixtures a full 12 points ahead of Juve as they also have a game in hand against in-form Atalanta on Wednesday.\nRugani's goal also gave Juve a five-point cushion between them and AC Milan who host Atalanta at the San Siro in Sunday's late match.\nFrosinone are 16th and three points above the relegation zone after a fourth straight defeat for Eusebio Di Francesco's leaky side, with 14 goals conceded in that run.\nThe away team played well and were briefly leading when Brescianini rifled in a brilliant finish in the 27th minute, only for Vlahovic to level with his second of the day five minutes later.\n\"The late goal is a huge shame, things are not going our way and it's a real source of regret,\" said Di Francesco to Sky.\n\"Every match there is regret about the result. It's a huge disappointment.\"\nLater Napoli try to reignite their hopes of European football at Cagliari in Francesco Calzona's first league match with the ailing Italian champions.\nCalzona made a positive start to his new job on Wednesday night when Napoli drew 1-1 with Barcelona in the last 16 of the Champions League.\nNapoli are ninth, five points from the European spots and a huge 12 behind fourth-placed Bologna who sit in the final Champion League spot after beating Verona on Friday night.\n© 2024 AFP",
