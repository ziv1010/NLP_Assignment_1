That gave PSG a draw and the French team rubbed it in when progressing instead of Newcastle, by making it to the semi-finals of the Champions League, whilst the other team (Borussia Dortmund) ended up losing finalists.\nTalking of disgraceful decisions…UEFA have named the same referee and VAR for this Newcastle v Benfica match, who falsely denied United their win in that game in Paris.\nNick Pope on media duties at the pre-match press conference on Monday ahead of this Benfica match tonight, hoping to get past the initial Swiss League/Group stage for the first time since Sir Bobby Robson did so with his NUFC team:\n“It is something this football club’s not done in a long, long time, so it’s a big ambition for the group.\n“We have got a top team, top manager, and getting to the later stages of the Champions League is something everyone wants to be a part of.\n“We qualified for the Champions League and when we stood on the pitch on the last day against Everton and we’d been beat, we’d have snapped your hand off for that.\n“Now we are in it, we have got a top squad, a bit more experience than we had first time around, so we are looking to take it to the next level.\n“The atmospheres at the home Champions League games are brilliant, with those experiences we’ve had over the last couple of years.\n“A real special night ahead and a game we look forward to.”\nNick Pope asked if he still has England aspirations and hoping for a recall ahead of the 2026 World Cup finals:\n“I spoke to him (Thomas Tuchel) when he took over, or soon after he took over the job, and then I’ve been in regular contact with (England goalkeeping coach) Hilario,\n“I feel like the communication’s been really good, I’ve really enjoyed having the opportunity to speak to him and to speak to Hilario on a regular basis.\n“I feel like I am in the frame, if you like, and it’s something that’s not dead, so that’s always nice to have at the back of your mind.\n“I think it’s always best to let your football do the talking and try to keep the ball out the net.\n“I think that’s going to stand you in the best stead.\n“Hopefully Dan Burn’s putting in a good word as well!”\nNick Pope also confirmed media reports that his contract which was originally due to end on 30 June 2026, had seen a year’s extension triggered, so is now due to end on 30 June 2027.\nSo this is how the Newcastle United contracts situation currently looks (via official club releases and media reports), when current deals are up:\nEnd of June 2026:\nSchar, Targett, Ashby, Trippier, Krafth, Lascelles, Ramsdale\nEnd of June 2027:\nPope, Botman, Burn, Jacob Murphy, Willock\nEnd of June 2028:\nTonali, Barnes, Livramento, Bruno, Miley, Joelinton, Alex Murphy\nEnd of June 2029:\nHall, Gordon, Wissa, Thiaw\nEnd of June 2030:\nElanga\nEnd of June 2031:\nWoltemade\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
