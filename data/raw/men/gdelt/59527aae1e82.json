I believe they have been highly inspired by that victory and have the capacity to go all the way and win the title,” Gusau stated.\nThe NFF boss who went ahead to commend the team’s extraordinary fighting spirit in overpowering the defending champions to reach the semi-finals of the ongoing CAF Women’s Champions League competition in Morocco, believed that they can as well emerge winners of the ongoing tournament.\n“We congratulate the Edo State Government and all those involved in this remarkable progress of the team,” he added.\nEdo Queens, who won the Nigerian title for only the first time last season, went ahead to beat all comers to win the WAFU B Women’s Champions League competition (a qualifying tournament for the continental championship) in Cote d’Ivoire, and have now made it to the last four of the CAF women Champions League.\nWith the development, Edo Queens will now take on TP Mazembe of DR Congo in the first semi-final on Tuesday, at 4:00 pm Morocco time, before AS FAR of Morocco confront Masar of Egypt in the second semi-final three hours later.",
