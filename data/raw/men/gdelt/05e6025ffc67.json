  "body_text": "Viktor Gyokeres’ return for Arsenal is a welcome sight for the league leaders – but could the Swede have to wait a bit longer for his opportunity back in the starting XI?\nBy his own lofty standards, Gyokeres has had a middle-of-the-road start to life in north London since his £64million move from Sporting Lisbon.\nThe 27-year-old has scored six goals in 15 games in all competitions this season, with four of those coming in the Premier League.\nHowever, a four-game absence due to injury forced Mikel Arteta to turn back to makeshift striker Mikel Merino, with Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus still not fully match fit.\nAnd the Spaniard, nominally a combative central midfielder, has once again shown his Swiss-Army-like qualities when leading the line in Gyokeres’ absence.\nA brace against Slavia Prague was followed by assists against Sunderland and Tottenham, before a well-taken header ensured the Gunners secured a point against Chelsea last weekend.\nGyokeres made his return at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, and with a hectic festive schedule kicking off with the visit of Brentford on Wednesday, he is sure to get plenty of opportunities in the coming games.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nBut the recent performances of Merino may have Arteta questioning whether his marquee summer signing should now be an automatic starter.\n‘He is willing to learn constantly’\nMerino’s recent run back as Arsenal’s striker has shown his impressive tactical versatility when leading the line.\nAgainst Spurs in the north London derby, Merino dropped deeper to drag Tottenham’s back five out of position, using his eye for a pass to set up Leandro Trossard’s opener, and allowing Eberechi Eze to exploit the space he vacated.\nBut in last weekend’s top-of-the-table clash, Merino was a far more traditional No9, providing a physical challenge for Wesley Fofana and Trevor Chalobah, but equally making his mark and getting on the scoresheet with another header.\nThe Spaniard now has five headed goals in 2025, the joint-most in the Premier League this calendar year alongside Brentford’s Kevin Schade.\nIt’s perhaps no surprise, then, that several people think Merino should be given an extended stay in the starting lineup.\n‘I’d be very surprised if Mikel Arteta takes Mikel Merino out of the Arsenal XI after his performances up front recently,’ former Liverpool striker Emile Heskey told BetWright Casino this week.\nMikel Arteta full of praise for Merino's adaptability\n‘I knew that he could offer much more than what he had, and especially after I met him for the first time,’ Arteta noted on Tuesday when asked about Merino’s adaptation to playing as a striker.\n‘A player that has that amount of curiosity and the amount of questions that he’s asked, how willing he is to learn constantly, the way he loves his profession and football, it’s difficult to put limits to that because when someone wants to grow every single day, is that determined, is that hungry to win and evolve and to be part of something, that’s very powerful and Mikel certainly has that.’\n‘Why would he? When things are going well for managers, they’re very relucent to change anything. As a striker as well – if you’re playing well and scoring but get dropped, you’d be fuming!\n‘I think Merino’s success up front goes to show the evolution of strikers. All sorts of players from different positions get put there now – wingers, number 10s, midfielders – it’s just about finding what fits your system the best. Merino is certainly enjoying a good period for Arsenal at the moment, so I’d be surprised if Arteta wanted to change that.’\nHow does Merino compare with ‘flat-track bully’ Gyokeres?\nArteta has been keen to show faith in Gyokeres since his arrival, starting him in every Premier League and Champions League match prior to his injury.\nGyokeres is far different to Merino, using his power and strength up against centre-backs and always looking to make runs into the channels and in behind.\nBut there is also a feeling that the 27-year-old is yet to produce his best against superior opposition, with his four league goals so far coming against relegation battlers Leeds United, Nottingham Forest and Burnley.\n‘I don’t want to call Gyökeres a flat-track bully, that’s a bit unfair,’ former England striker Gary Lineker said last month. ‘But he needs to do it in some of the big games.’\nMerino, by contrast, has only scored two league goals this season, but those have come in key away games against Newcastle United and Chelsea.\nAnd in all competitions, the Spaniard has five goal contributions when starting for Arsenal as a striker, compared to Gyokeres’ eight, despite only playing roughly half as many minutes as a striker (528 vs 1078).\nOff the ball, Merino is also far more of a presence, completing five tackles against Tottenham alone, while Gyokeres has made just two throughout the entire season.\nPerhaps watching on from the sidelines will have lit a fire under Gyokeres, who has already shown a useful knack of sniffing out a goal in and around the six-yard box.\nWho should start up front for Arsenal?\n-\nViktor Gyokeres\n-\nMikel Merino\nThe Swede remains still Arsenal’s top goalscorer in all competitions, and retains plenty of backing from his manager and the wider footballing world.\n‘Merino brings stability, almost an extra defensive body as a false nine. But you need to have [Gyökeres] on the pitch when he’s fit and firing,’ former Liverpool and Chelsea striker Daniel Sturridge told Sky Sports.\n‘You need big hitters out there, and Gyökeres was bought to provide goals in big moments.’\nStarting Gyokeres would also allow Merino to return to his day-to-day role in midfield and, crucially, allow Arteta the opportunity to better manage Martin Zubimendi and Declan Rice’s minutes in the coming weeks.\nDon’t forget Havertz and Jesus\nExcept for a half-hour cameo on opening day, Kai Havertz has not been seen this season after sustaining a serious hamstring injury.\nThe German international is still working his way back to full fitness, but Arteta was keen to once again stress his importance to the side.\n‘We’re all desperate to have him,’ the Arsenal boss said. ‘It’s a player that personally, I love so much for what he brings to the team.\nMore Trending\n‘His character, his personality, I see him suffer, being outside. His playing record is phenomenal. He’s always been available, and I can’t wait to have him back around the team playing now because I think it’s going to be a massive boost for the team.’\nAlong with Havertz, Gabriel Jesus could also be pushing for a start after the Brazilian made his return to the matchday squad following a lengthy knee injury.\nJesus had been in a rich vein of form prior to his injury, scoring six times in seven games over the festive period, and adds another, more nimble profile to Arteta’s attacking options.\nWhat is abundantly clear is that Arsenal are blessed with a myriad of options in attacking areas that few, if any, can rival. The challenge for Arteta is to ensure he uses them correctly.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Man Utd put ‘struggling’ £50m player up for sale ahead of January transfer window\nMORE: Mikel Arteta names the signing that took Arsenal to ‘another level’\nMORE: ‘What’s going on!’ – Enzo Maresca warned that £60m Chelsea star has ‘dropped off’",
