  "body_text": "I know the correct answer is Champions League but when you are in your sixties, with a dodgy heart…\nNow we are in between seasons, we wanted to get a Newcastle United fans snapshot of opinion.\nThe idea is to get a range of views of what various Mag writers (Newcastle United fans) think about what has happened and the current position.\nThen most importantly, what is going to happen at Newcastle United moving forward.\nSo we have sent various regular and irregular contributors sets of questions, including some the same as others, some different.\nNext up we have Jinky Jim:\nPress a magic button and have a 62,000 capacity enlarged St James’ Park in place, or a brand new 80,000 capacity stadium just up the road at Castle Leazes ?\nThe logic, business plans and the Newcastle United brand says we move.\nEmotion says we stay\nEmotion is still winning for me.\nNext three seasons, would you rather finish top four all three seasons BUT win nothing, or finish mid-table all three seasons AND win the League Cup in one of the three?\nSee my previous answer, virtually word for word.\nI know the correct answer is Champions League but when you are in your sixties, with a dodgy heart…\nThree words to describe Newcastle United now?\nHeading for glory.\nI appreciate that may be seen as being a bit overly confident, but if I don’t believe we will do it under these owners, then I guess we never will.\nWhat do you see as the minimum this season?\nTop four and I think that can be achieved providing we get fewer injuries.\nWe have a very good squad and with a couple more signings we are more than capable of making Champions League again.\nThe best five NUFC performances last season (in order).\nThe best thing about this question is that we actually have a choice to make and a pretty big one at that!\nAnyway:\n1 It has to be PSG at home. As good as anything seen at St James’ Park since Tino’s hat-trick.\n2. Man Utd away in the League Cup. I got so much joy from this game. It’s the first time I have seen us batter them on their patch in 64 years of life.\n3 Man City home league cup. I chose this because if you look at the match thread comments when the team was announced, the feelings were that we were going to get gubbed. It didn’t turn out like that. Lots of fringe players stepped up and did a great job.\n4. Sheffield Utd. I know who we were playing but because eight players scored (you won’t see that happen again), this equalled our record win in Premier League history, how can’t I choose it?\n5. This might surprise you. PSG away. The guts shown by our team, who ran themselves into the ground for the cause, made my heart swell with pride. For what felt like hours we were waiting for the French to score but our lads were magnificent. We was robbed.\nThe five most important Newcastle players for this 2024/25 season (in order)?\nBig Joe\nIsak.\nBruno\nGordon\nAnd a settled back four (I know that’s cheating)\nThe current NUFC player that you have been proved most wrong about?\nI wrote an article about how badly I got big Joe wrong.\nFrom a castrated Billy Goat to my favourite player. He is a hugely important part of our team as his absence proved.\nWith the summer business you are anticipating, what could NUFC be capable of next season?\nWhen I was young, a jock and a cockney were on the telly and they always said football was a funny old game.\nAre we capable of winning something? Yes we are.\nWill we? Probably not.\nThat answer being based on years of disappointment.\nHowever, it will change one of these years. so why not this time?\nWould you like to draw Sunderland again in one of the cups this coming season?\nYes, based purely on the fact that if we get them, it means that we haven’t got Man City or Chelsea or Arsenal away.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
