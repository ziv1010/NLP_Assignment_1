But enthusiasm and desire takes you a long way.\n“Soak it up. Soak it up for as long as you possibly can, because you don’t get many nights like this.\n“What you need at the heart of the performance like this is desire, togetherness and all those players they have.”\nNewcastle legend Chris Waddle was in agreement, adding: “Thoroughly deserved. They worked hard, they played some great football.\n“PSG for me, too many egos. But tonight is all about Newcastle United.”\nTHAT IS HOW YOU ROUND IT OFF! 💥\nFabian Schär. Simply INCREDIBLE 🤯#UCL pic.twitter.com/y3EDGBqCUy\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) October 4, 2023\nSpeaking after the game, midfielder Longstaff reflected on an incredible night, adding: “It’s some night. I think we knew it was going to be special with the atmosphere but for me and Burny [Dan Burn] to score on a night like tonight is pretty surreal and I am lost for words really.\n“It is [a dream come true]. I think to be honest there are some of us that thought three years ago we were probably out of the door and it wasn’t a great place to be. I am so proud to be from Newcastle and I am over the moon.”\nLongstaff was also asked whether the Newcastle players have ever been more up for a game than this, adding: “I think the [Carabao Cup] semi-final last year was similar but this is a different level. They have some of the best players in the world and we want to go against them and show how good we are.”\nDON’T MISS: Newcastle warned over ‘getting rid’ of key duo as chief Real Madrid scout in attendance for PSG clash",
