  "body_text": "Most of the songs from the 1,500 visiting Norwich City supporters in the opening 20 minutes were for David Wagner.\nThey sang his name, sang about him being “at the wheel” and generally made clear their appreciation. Come the final whistle at the DW Stadium, Wagner returned the favour by applauding their support. He later labelled it one of the few positives from a turgid afternoon as his team managed one shot on target in a goalless draw at now-bottom Wigan Athletic.\nAdvertisement\nNorwich are ninth and Wagner knows the job ahead. He knows the football he wants to play and how difficult it can be to implement that during a campaign, rather than pre-season. There is also a growing sense of the rebuild Norwich will require this summer, whatever the outcome of this season.\nWagner’s predecessor, Dean Smith, had been seen as the sole issue by many. Now Wagner is on something of a free pass given the factors he is perceived to be dealing with. The truth, as always, sits between the two.\n“It’s an exciting situation and I’m really looking forward to the next game,” Wagner told The Athletic following Saturday’s stalemate when asked if the work his team needs and a promotion challenge are both possible over the remainder of the season.\n“Looking at the table, for me, it only wastes energy because it changes every day. I look at the performance, which was not good enough from what we expect — and I look at what we collected in points, which was one with a clean sheet.”\nBarely 48 hours earlier, the light was diminishing at Norwich’s training ground as Wagner prepared to talk up the weekend’s prospects.\nThe evening pre-match press conference is a new experience at Norwich, coming off the back of the day’s final training session. But its ability to offer something deeper than the conversations in closer proximity to a game remain.\nOn taking over at Norwich a few days into 2023, Wagner readily admitted he had no real idea where he was or what his new surroundings looked like.\nSix weeks of managerial whirlwind later and Wagner can smile at the progress he has made off the pitch since The Athletic asked him during his first media conference as head coach.\nHis stay at Barnham Broom Hotel in the countryside beyond Norwich is over after he moved into a flat last week. He has found snippets of time for walks through the city centre and along the River Wensum and visited one of Norwich’s two cathedrals.\nAdvertisement\nHe and his family were on holiday — coincidentally on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura — when the Canaries came calling for a new head coach. His family were happy he got the call, even if they knew what was coming.\n“It was more difficult when my daughters were younger and I had to leave my home. Now, they have left the home!” Wagner told The Athletic. “At the beginning when you come into a club, especially during a season, it’s better to be alone. You have no time for anyone anyway. If my wife was here, it would be nice for me for an hour in the day but the other 23 hours it wouldn’t be nice for her to be totally alone.\n“Obviously we have to make a decision in the summer over how we’d like to progress. Will she come over? When? For how long? We haven’t got our heads around what this will look like yet. But it’s much easier now because it’s only my wife and me… and my dog, which sometimes hurts to not see him for a long time.”\nWagner’s long-time assistant and friend Christoph Buhler was another waiting for the call. When it came, there was never a scenario considered by either party other than the pair reuniting at Norwich.\nBuhler had been a guest of Smith and his assistant, Craig Shakespeare, for a few days last spring to take in Norwich’s training facilities and sessions, alongside visiting other English clubs. His report back to Wagner on the club, city and people was positive.\nSuch reports back on Wagner’s previous two jobs might be less so — a subject Wagner had yet to be asked about fully since joining Norwich.\nA flying start to life as Schalke manager unravelled in the midst of the pandemic and an unsettled boardroom. They have now returned to the Bundesliga after relegation but are cut adrift at the bottom.\nWagner then joined Swiss champions Young Boys in the summer of 2021, leading them from the Champions League second qualifying round into the group stages and a famous victory over Manchester United. However, their domestic form put them out of contention to defend their title by the end of winter and Wagner was sacked in March 2022.\nAdvertisement\n“From every experience, you learn and you become a better manager. The successful ones where you get a lot of praise and also the less successful ones,” Wagner told The Athletic.\n“For me, it is always important to have your own explanation for what happened. With Schalke, that season with COVID and all the changes in the boardroom — the owner, the directors, the injuries — it all came together. You can see after another three years how difficult it is for this club to get back to where they were. I totally know which part I played in this story.\n“Young Boys was different. It was financially the best year the club ever had, with qualifying for the Champions League group stages. We got five points. There was a big focus on the Champions League. Then we sold for £20million in the winter four of our best players. The plan was to invest in the summer to go again.\n“Not always do I have to agree with every decision a board makes. When we had already collected so much money from the Champions League, why did we need to collect further money and maybe make the squad, which had problems competing in the league, even weaker?\n“Everybody hopes to go to Europe and win titles. But this is not always possible. I learned a lot managing in Germany where I come from, and another country abroad from Germany in Switzerland. These were big experiences, not only as a manager but as a person. It really challenged me and gave me experiences that will make me better.”\nOne thing in the back of Wagner’s mind is that Norwich have generally shown plenty of faith in their head coaches; sometimes when hindsight proved a change was required sooner.\nOne of those to benefit from Norwich’s patience was Smith’s predecessor, Daniel Farke, who spent more than four seasons at the helm and had to ride out a tricky first full season before putting a lot of smiles on people’s faces.\nAdvertisement\nWhile all at Norwich were enduring events at Wigan, Farke was managing Borussia Monchengladbach to a 3-2 win at home to Bayern Munich.\nNorwich supporters will hope their own better days still lay ahead — it is already clear many of them hope Wagner will be the one to instigate them, even if it proves beyond the current campaign.\n(Top photo: Harriet Lander/Getty Images)",
