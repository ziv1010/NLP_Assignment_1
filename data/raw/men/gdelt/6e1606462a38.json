  "body_text": "Less than 48 hours after making his Super Lig and Galatasaray debut, Super Eagles ace Victor Osimhen has been ruled out of Tuesday’s game against Gaziantep FK.\nOsimhen, who’s on a season-long loan from Napoli, was an instant hit for the Yellow and Red, helping Galatasaray to a resounding 5-0 home win over Rizespor.\nThe Super Lig fixture against Gaziantep FK, billed for the Rams Park Stadyumu, is a rescheduled Matchday 3 game.\nIt was postponed by the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) owing to Galatasaray’s involvement in the Champions League playoffs against Young Boys.\nThe TFF has given a reason why the Nigerian won’t play against Gaziantep FK; this was due to his transfer status.\nSo he’s ineligible to play, as he didn’t make his move before Matchday 3.\nRecall Osimhen completed his move to Galatasaray a few days before the close of the Turkish transfer window.",
