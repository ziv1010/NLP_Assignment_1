Serie A is using the orange ball.\nThis decision made little sense in Sardinia on Saturday afternoon. The sun was out for Cagliari’s first game since a U.S. consortium bought a minority stake in the club over the international break.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps the use of the Puma Orbita Serie A High-Vis FIFA Pro ball was justifiable for other reasons. Goals have been in short supply in Italy this season. There were only 244 going into the November break. Seven leagues in Europe counted more. The 17 0-0s in Serie A represented an extreme outlier. By comparison, the runner-up for most stalemates this season, the set-piece Premier League, has had 10 fewer. Might changing the ball’s colour have an effect? Cavolo! It did\nViva l’arancione!\nThere were six goals at the Unipol Domus on Saturday and there could have been more. Genoa twice got in front. Cagliari came back and took the lead. Arguably Italy’s blusteriest ground, the whipping wind fooled Cagliari goalkeeper Elia Caprile, whose recent form had been rewarded with an Italy call-up for the qualifiers against Moldova and Norway.\nAaron Martin’s freak free kick, an equalising cross, got lifted by a gale, then fell so hard it bounced over Caprile and clinched a 3-3 draw. “We played football,” Genoa coach Daniele De Rossi said. For the love of God, thank you.\nIt was a welcome change in conversation from Italy’s shortcomings in World Cup qualification.\nThey ranged from a 4-1 defeat by Norway at San Siro, the Azzurri’s heaviest at home since 1955, the indignity of Gianluca Mancini pinching Erling Haaland’s bum in an attempt to put him off his game only for him score twice, the desperate and unedifying complaints from national team coach Gennaro Gattuso about the number of spots Africa and South America get at the tournament, and the calls for more time with the players before the play-off semi-final against almighty Northern Ireland in March.\nNapoli’s trials and tribulations\nThe melodrama and all too familiar head-banging caused by the national team’s travails distracted from another big story down in Naples. After losing to Bologna a fortnight ago, Antonio Conte needed a break. Rather than stay in Naples and train the players not on international duty, he spent a week in Turin, the place his family call home. This led to speculation about his future.\nAdvertisement\n“I read fantasies about Conte’s resignation on the web,” Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis tweeted. He reassured the fans it was “nonsense” and marvelled at Conte’s willingness “to sacrifice every second of his life for his profession”. Conte returned on Monday, recharged. But the seismograph around Mount Vesuvius began violently scribbling on Thursday.\nNapoli expressed their “astonishment and dismay” at the decision to commit an investigation into false accounting and player trading between 2019 and 2021 to trial. Napoli have denied wrongdoing and stated they “did not derive any advantage from the disputed transactions”, involving Kostas Manolas and Victor Osimhen, whose move from Lille coincided with four Napoli players going the other way. The only one of note was Orestis Karnezis, a veteran backup goalkeeper, then 35. The rest were unknowns, Claudio Manzi, Luigi Liguori and Ciro Palmieri, who never played for Lille. The quartet were valued at €20million.\nNapoli have always maintained the transfers were legitimate and, pointedly and rather amusingly, raised “a perfectly comparable case” from the past in which an investigation into Inter’s player-trading in 2018 and 2019 was dismissed.\nNevertheless, in the fiercely tribal world of Italian football, the decision by a preliminary hearing judge in Rome to commit the case to trial has raised questions. For instance, is the evidence used in support of that decision, some of it published by La Repubblica, not enough for Giuseppe Chine, the lead prosecutor of the Italian Football Federation’s disciplinary committee, to reopen a sporting investigation into player trading and transfer values, as was the case with Juventus, who were docked 10 points in 2023. Apparently not.\nNapoli have won the league twice in the meantime. They moved back to the top of the table on Saturday night with an emphatic win over Atalanta. Already three goals to the good at half-time, Romelu Lukaku was in the stands and then on the sidelines acting like Conte’s assistant coach. “I love Romelu too much to advise him to become a coach,” Conte laughed. It’s a gruelling job, even if the wins he keeps racking up gloss over how hard. Napoli remain unbeaten at the Maradona this calendar year in Serie A and won’t give up their title without a fight.\nDavid Neres hit a brace in Napoli’s win over Atalanta ✌️#NapoliAtalanta pic.twitter.com/L86YafZNC1\n— Lega Serie A (@SerieA_EN) November 23, 2025\nThe 3-1 victory, a baptism of fire for Atalanta’s new coach Raffaele Palladino, meant Napoli overtook Bologna, who, creditably, led the standings themselves for a few euphoric hours on Saturday evening.\nAdvertisement\nAre Bologna title contenders?\nThe Felsinei could have been roughed up by Udinese. Kosta Runjaic’s team are one of the most physical in the league and had only lost once at the Bluenergy Stadium all season. Bologna were also missing their first-choice goalkeeper, Lukasz Skorupski, their best centre-back, Jhon Lucumi, who was late back from international duty, while Remo Freuler and Lewis Ferguson, their midfield dynamos, were either unfit, or in the Scot’s case, worn out from qualifying for the World Cup.\nIt didn’t matter. Bologna suffered in the first half. They got knocked about a bit and Riccardo Orsolini missed a penalty. Nae bother, as Scotland midfielder Ferguson might say. They stayed in the game, grew into it, and won 3-0. In retrospect, Napoli’s crisis-provoking defeat by Bologna a fortnight ago doesn’t look so bad.\nUnbeaten in 11 games in all competitions, Bologna’s rise continues. It can be traced back to the team spirit and sense of belonging forged by Sinisa Mihajlovic, the modernity brought by Thiago Motta, and the experience of playing Champions League football and winning the Coppa Italia under Vincenzo Italiano.\nA virtuous circle has turned anew regardless of the managerial churn. Bologna are the prospective successors to Atalanta. General manager Giovanni Sartori joined one from the other and his magic touch in recruitment, particularly the unappreciated depth at the Renato Dall’Ara, is now being felt. Sartori was one of Atalanta’s secrets. He was more in the shadows than Gian Piero Gasperini, and if the spell, for now, seems broken in Bergamo, it is not in Bologna, nor is it in Rome.\nRoma are for real\nIn the neighbourhood of Garbatella, one of the hotbeds of Roma support in the capital, a mural has been painted. It depicts Gasperini as a wizard. In it, he stirs a cauldron, mixing a heady brew of grit, heart and sweat. “I look like a cross between Merlin and the Befana,” Gasperini said. “It’s wonderful. The ingredients are fantastic. I couldn’t agree more. They’re the main ones, then we try to add spice and salt.”\n#Gasperini come Harry Potter: l’iconico murale a Roma. A Garbatella, uno dei quartieri storici , lo street artist Drugi ha realizzato un murale per omaggiare il tecnico che è ritratto come un mago intento a preparare una pozione magica fatta di cuore, grinta e sudore. pic.twitter.com/QSHbe3dmXJ\n— I fatti nostri (@Infofatti) November 23, 2025\nWhat sorcery is this? Roma’s 3-1 win in Cremona on Sunday meant the lead in Serie A changed three times over the weekend. Roma flew past Bologna and Napoli to resume their place at the top and it is “not by chance” in Gasperini’s estimation. After carrying on the good work of Claudio Ranieri, the team is more and more in Gasperini’s image. Mancini, a centre-back, setting up Zeki Celik, a wing-back, for Roma’s second goal against Udinese before the international break, was a sign of the confidence this team is gaining in attack.\nAt the Zini, Roma were near perfect. Matias Soule keeps scoring the same goal. A striker-less starting XI then got one, as was the case in Reggio Emilia, from a striker coming off the bench. On that occasion, it was Artem Dovbyk.\nAdvertisement\nThis time, it was Evan Ferguson who finally opened his account for Roma. Ferguson had watched the Republic of Ireland’s incredible 3-2 win against Hungary from Scholars Lounge, one of Rome’s Irish bars where your correspondent has won a pub quiz back in the day.\nRoma and Irish International Evan Ferguson in Scholars on a great day for Irish Football. 🇮🇪 🇮🇹 ⚽️ #scholarslounge #scholarsloungerome #scholarsloungemunich #scholarsirishpubs #asroma pic.twitter.com/2EykpH9uKo\n— Scholars Lounge Irish Pubs Rome & Munich (@Scholarslounge) November 16, 2025\nThe experience must have provoked mixed emotions. On the one hand, pride in seeing Ireland come back and set up a play-off in March. On the other, FOMO and perhaps a competitive ruefulness, too, as Troy Parrott, his replacement, became a folk and hat-trick hero.\nAs the January transfer window approaches, Roma have started to be linked with Manchester United’s Joshua Zirkzee. It is indicative of a lack of confidence in the team’s forwards. Little was expected of Ferguson, then, as he entered the game in Cremona. But the Brighton & Hove Albion loanee and Gasperini’s other subs, Neil El Aynaoui and Stephan El Shaarawy, helped kill off Cremonese.\n🇮🇪 THE IRISHMAN\nEvan Ferguson’s first Roma goal sees his side 2-0 up away at Cremonese!\nGAME ON | Watch Lega Serie A live on https://t.co/i0K4eUtwwb in select territories#SerieA pic.twitter.com/R8pr51b4fu\n— DAZN Football (@DAZNFootball) November 23, 2025\nTop at this stage for the first time in 11 years, Roma could have been caught by Inter later in the day, depending on the outcome of the season’s first Derby della Madonnina.\nAlas, Inter ran into Mike Maignan.\nMagic Mike\nMilan’s goalkeeper and captain has been at his best this season. After saving a penalty against Roma to preserve a 1-0 win at the Stadio Olimpico this month, Maignan got in the way of former team-mate Hakan Calhanoglu equalising from the spot to secure another quintessentially Max Allegri win.\nIt was Corto Muso; by a nose, 1-0 all over again. Christian Pulisic didn’t want the Player of the Match award, insisting it was only right that Maignan collected it. The American admitted not feeling “100 per cent sharp” on his first start since the injury he suffered while on international duty in October, yet he still managed to keep up his ratio of a goal or an assist every 57 minutes when fit for Milan this season.\nAdvertisement\n“I scored an easy goal,” Pulisic smiled on DAZN. “(Mike) probably made 10 saves.” Penalties aside, the dive to deny compatriot Marcus Thuram an early headed goal was reminiscent of the form Maignan showed in his first season at San Siro when he replaced Gianluigi Donnarumma and won the Scudetto.\nA super performance between the sticks from Mike Maignan 🧤 pic.twitter.com/MMSFf6dlu2\n— Lega Serie A (@SerieA_EN) November 24, 2025\nThe Madonnina was, on one level, a tale of two goalkeepers. If Maignan has often been the difference in Milan’s tight wins, Inter’s Yann Sommer has made mistakes in tight losses to Udinese, Juventus and the cousins. As we head into a Champions League week, Inter coach Cristian Chivu can expect to keep getting questions about Sommer’s place in the side, while Milan’s executive team know Maignan’s future will, once again, be a topic of discussion.\nMaignan’s contract is up in the summer. Milan didn’t blink in 2021 when they refused to give into Donnarumma’s salary demands. They showed themselves more than capable of replacing him, too. Will there be a repeat with Maignan? The considerable signing-on fee he commands might still be less than the transfer fee for a successor.\nMaignan is, along with Roma’s Mile Svilar, the best goalkeeper in Serie A this season. Serie A can change the ball from white to high-vis, but Maigan continues to keep it out. In the long run the two No 1s, Maignan and Svilar, might be the difference between who, out of Milan and Roma, finishes No 1 come the end of the season.",
