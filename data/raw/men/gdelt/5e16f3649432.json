Bilbao were a lot better than us,\" noted Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak, who was similarly critical of his team after the recent Alaves defeat.\n\"We've entered a terrible dynamic,\" noted the stopper.\n\"If we don't improve it will be a very tough end to the season.\"\nThe teams met again in the Copa del Rey semi-finals, with Atletico on top but falling to a 1-0 defeat, their first at home in over a year.\nAtletico fans argued that their opponents had enjoyed more rest ahead of the game and that an unusually rash challenge from Reinildo Mandava gave away the penalty which Alex Berenguer converted to secure Athletic's win.\nHowever in the second leg Athletic dominated and romped to a 3-0 victory against Simeone's flailing Athletic.\nAthletic stumbled to a 1-1 draw against Granada last week but Atletico's defeat turned that into a point gained rather than two dropped.\nAfter winning the Spanish cup for the first time in 40 years to spark days of wild celebrations, a comedown was almost inevitable but Valverde needs his team to knuckle down again in the final weeks to make it a better season still.\n\"Someone will have to get them down from the clouds and focus on La Liga, and that someone is usually the coach,\" said Valverde after the cup win.\nVeteran Raul Garcia is retiring at the end of the campaign while captain Iker Muniain has also said he will depart, and taking the Basque side back to the big time would be the perfect note to walk out on.\nPlayer to watch: Artem Dovbyk\nThe Girona striker is the division's top goalscorer with 18 and will look to boost that tally at Las Palmas on Saturday as his side kick on in their hunt for Champions League football next season.\nKey stats\n24.7 - Valencia's squad have the youngest average age in La Liga\n81 - Inaki Williams leads the league for shots taken\n24,054 - touches of the ball this season by possession-hungry Barcelona, more than any other side\nFixtures (all times GMT)\nFriday\nReal Sociedad v Real Madrid (1900)\nSaturday\nLas Palmas v Girona (1200), Almeria v Getafe (1415), Alaves v Celta Vigo (1630), Atletico Madrid v Athletic Bilbao (1900)\nSunday\nCadiz v Mallorca (1200), Granada v Osasuna (1415), Villarreal v Rayo Vallecano (1630), Real Betis v Sevilla (1900)\nMonday\nBarcelona v Valencia (1900)\n© 2024 AFP",
