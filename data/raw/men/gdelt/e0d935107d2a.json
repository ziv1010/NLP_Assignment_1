  "body_text": "As the last manager to win the Premier League for us, Antonio Conte retains a special place in my heart (where I can easily overlook his time at Spurs, even), so I was absolutely delighted to see him triumph once again — and to do so in classic Conte fashion yet again.\nEx-Chelsea trio Antonio Conte, Billy Gilmour, and Romelu Lukaku win Serie A with Napoli!\nFORZA!\nNapoli won the Scudetto two years ago, but finished just midtable last season. And so, just like Chelsea in 2016, they turned to the man who specializes in turning small flames into blazing infernos.\nHe, in turn, turned to the man who might have changed the course of history (and Conte’s history) had he returned to Chelsea in 2017 rather than 2021, adding several other Premier League castoffs like Scott McTominay and Philip Billing and another ex-Blue in Billy Gilmour to the squad. Not even the exits of Victor Osimhen at start of the season and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in January could deter Conte’s latest football revolution, as he continually tailored his tactics to the team and players he had available. They would finish the 38-game league season with just four defeats and only 27 goals conceded.\nFavorites and Champions League finalists Inter Milan finished one point behind, beating Cesc Fàbregas’s Como, 2-0 on the final day, but all they could do was watch Napoli triumph over Cagliari by the same scoreline to start the celebrations across Naples. (Both games were played Friday night, to maximize the attention given to them.) McTominay, who turned into prime Frank Lampard at times this season with his goals from midfield, and Lukaku scored to seal the deal for the Partenopei. It’s their fourth Serie A title, and second in the last three years.\nCongrats, all, but especially to Billy G and Antoniooooooooooooooo...",
