It is a big accomplishment to be able to have only one style, but Mikel’s team are capable of being different, as we saw in the two games against PSG.\n‘They can play off set-pieces. They can defend in a low block and be the dominant team. They can play a high-press. They can build up from the back or play the long ball.\n‘Every part of the game they are good, and that means it is difficult to analyse them because you don’t know what you’re going to face.\n‘The only way you can have that is if you work at a club for so many years but not all managers who have been at clubs a long time can play so many styles. This is special. You don’t see it a lot.’\nArteta, meanwhile, said Liverpool’s ability to keep their key players fit and available for much their Premier League campaign likely played a key role in their success this term.\n‘That’s a big thing to win trophies, you know, and they did that extremely well,’ Arteta said.\nMore Trending\n‘They managed to maintain that consistency, that level of players, a system, a coach, a stadium that has created again, and consistently, an incredible atmosphere for them.\n‘So you need a lot of ingredients or you don’t win the Premier League.\n‘That’s the difficulty of it, and it’s true that this season we never found that consistently because of the issues that we had. I don’t want to use it as an excuse.\n‘We have the best league in the world, yes? We all agree. But we were the only team from this league on the park in the semi-finals of the Champions League. That’s the level.’\nMORE: ‘Massive issue’ – Jamie Carragher fires Mikel Arteta warning to Arsenal board\nMORE: Jamie Carragher makes Trent Alexander-Arnold prediction after Anfield boos\nMORE: Arne Slot sends message to Liverpool fans after Trent Alexander-Arnold is booed in Arsenal draw",
