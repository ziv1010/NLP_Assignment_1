The way they keep the ball is sublime. They make it look easy.\nThat’s the context.\nWe were up against a world class side and there was no disgrace in losing narrowly to them.\nOn another night we might have edged it and it was Rashford’s wonder strike that gave them the two goal cushion.\nSpecial occasion\nIt’s not every day Barca are in town.\nThis was a real occasion and the pre-kick off displays from Wor Flags and noise from the home support was spine tingling.\nWe’ve come a long way in a short period. Back in 2021 we looked like we might be off down and I had given up on ever seeing Champions League nights back on Tyneside.\nFast forward four years and we have our second appearance in the competition in just three years.\nPace and power\nWe did well in that opening period. The pace of our attack, Elanga in particular, did stretch Barca. Barnes ever so close to making 1-0.\nAt the back we had been doing okay, but Schar getting that knock just seemed to allow them to steal the opening goal, a shade unfortunate.\nFine margins.\nMalick Thiaw did really well when he came on. He was a big plus point and we look forward to seeing more from him as the manager has to use the squad this season. In fact, I wonder if he should get a start down at Bournemouth. Maybe Botman too.\nNEGATIVES\nStriker dilemma\nA big talking point was the decision to play Anthony Gordon up front, as a number nine, and leave club record signing Nick Woltemade on the bench.\nI can only imagine Woltemade was disappointed not to get a start after bagging the winner against Wolves last weekend.\nThe question is, did Eddie Howe get this one right?\nI’ve seen his post-match comments about the reasoning for resting Woltemade.\nIn my humble opinion, with Barca in town, and it being so tough, you have to play the big German up front and give him at least an hour.\nYes, he cramped up a bit on Saturday, but surely he had 60 mins in his legs in midweek.\nWith him in from the start, crosses could have been pinged on to his giant 6ft 6 frame.\nIt was a big call from the manager, but who knows, maybe we’ll see a wider benefit when we play at the weekend.\nThe Anthony Gordon puzzle\nWhy does it feel like so long since Gordon had a really good game for the club?\nIn this game he has found himself out of position, but even so, I think he can do a lot better.\nThe goal was nicely taken but it glossed over what had gone before.\nWiss is a big miss\nThe destiny of this game was hampered the moment Yoane Wissa got injured on international duty with DR Congo.\nWe badly needed an experienced finisher against Barca, and while injuries are part and parcel of football, we were cruelly denied a player who up until now had had an amazing fitness record.\nWissa would surely have posed a few more problems for Barcelona.\nDare I also mention the game highlighted what a big loss Isak has been and the shoddy way he left the club left us with little time to bed his replacements in.\nNewcastle 1 Barcelona 2 – Thursday 18 September 2025 8pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nGordon 90\nBarcelona:\nRashford 58, 67\nPossession was Newcastle 36% Barcelona 64%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 10 Barcelona 19\nShots on target were Newcastle 6 Barcelona 5\nCorners were Newcastle 6 Barcelona 4\nTouches in the box Newcastle 28 Barcelona 38\nNewcastle team v Barcelona:\nPope, Trippier (Botman 76), Schar (Thiaw 63), Burn, Livramento, Tonali, Bruno, Joelinton (Willock 62), Barnes (Woltemade 62), Gordon, Elanga (Murphy 63)\nUnused subs:\nThompson, Ramsdale, Hall, Krafth, Osula, Miley, A Murphy\n(Match Report – Hang on, what do I say if he wants one at the next game?
