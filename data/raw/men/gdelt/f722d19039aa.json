Manchester City will face Real Madrid, while Inter Milan will clash with AC Milan.\nProviding his prediction, Sabatini backed Inter or Milan to win the Champions League and redeem the Italian Serie A.\n“It will be a tragedy because whoever stays out will pay an unbearable price. But tragedy is also the beauty of football,” Sabatini told Rai Sport.\n“Inter [Milan] or [AC] Milan will win the [UEFA] Champions League, I have no doubts. It will be the definitive redemption of our football.\n“I admire Serie A, I think it’s the most competitive league and with the best coaches.”",
