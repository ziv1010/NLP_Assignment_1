The golden period when months of incomparable hard work, consistent brilliance and irrepressible talent will be rewarded with the biggest individual prize in world football. The 2024 Ballon d’Or trophy sits on its beautiful bed of gemstones, ready to fulfil the life-long dream of a footballer.\nIn September, the France Football Magazine, organisers of the award ceremony, released a 30-player list for both the men’s and women’s prizes. Only one African player made the illustrious shortlist for the men’s award: Ademola Lookman. The 27-year-old is the only player from the continent whose year has been impressive enough to be placed beside the best footballers in the world.\nLookman is the second Nigerian to make the Ballon d’Or list for two consecutive years following Victor Osimhen’s jinx-breaking eighth-finish last year.\nCan Lookman also gatecrash the top 10 like his compatriot or go even further to claim the grand prize?\nAdvertisement\nThe London-raised winger scored 17 goals and provided 11 assists in all competitions last season for Atalanta, which retained its status as one of the best in Serie A.\nLookman’s most significant contribution was his hattrick in the Europa League final against a hitherto undefeated Bayer Leverkusen. His heroics earned the Bergamo club its first-ever European title.\nThe player also grew into his own with the Super Eagles of Nigeria. He was one of Nigeria’s best players at the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cote d’Ivoire. Lookman scored three goals as the Eagles won silver at the tournament. He was also named in the competition’s best XI alongside captain Willian Troost-Ekong.\nAdvertisement\nHe has also continued his brilliance into the new season. In a few games, the winger has netted five goals and equal assists for Atalanta. He is Nigeria’s top performer at the ongoing 2025 AFCON qualifiers with two goals.\nIt, however, remains to be seen if his feats can propel him into the top echelon of the Ballon d’Or or even beyond the bar set by Osimhen.\nLast year, Osimhen was inspirational for Napoli as he led the club to their first Serie A title in 32 years. The striker scored 26 goals and won several individual gongs in the league.\nIn addition to Osimhen’s legacy, Lookman is also competing against a field of players with towering achievements at club and international levels.\nAdvertisement\nReal Madrid’s Vinicius Jr. and Jude Bellingham and Manchester City’s Rodri and Erling Haaland are considered top contenders at the 68th edition of the awards ceremony. Names such as Kylian Mbappe, Lautaro Martinez and Bukayo Saka are also in the mix; the top 10 will boast a star-studded cast.\nThe chances of Lookman winning the Ballon d’Or are slim. Vinicius scored 28 times for club and country last season and assisted more than 10 times. His dazzling display was critical to Real Madrid’s Champions League and La Liga double.\nBellingham enjoyed an uber-productive debut season at Madrid. He scored 23 goals and provided 11 assists while claiming the best player in La Liga and winning the Golden Boy prize.\nRodri was a vital cog in Manchester City’s steamrolling of teams en route to the fourth consecutive league title and FA Cup triumph. He also holds the astonishing record of featuring 74 straight games without a loss.\nAdvertisement\nIt is among these titans that Lookman stands, and at about 8:45 pm on Monday, he will know where he ranks in the mix.\nAdvertisement",
