Villa are the team hoping both continue.\nRead on as FourFourTwo brings you all the information on how to watch Liverpool taking on Villa online, on TV, and from anywhere.\nHow to watch Liverpool vs Aston Villa in the UK\nLiverpool vs Aston Villa will be broadcast live on TNT Sports 1 and can be streamed via the Discovery+ platform.\nA carefully balanced punditry panel of Steve McManaman, Steven Gerrard and Joe Cole is expected to be on hand to offer insight on the night.\nWatch the Premier League on TNT Sports and Discovery+\nYou can either get TNT Sports on your TV, in a traditional TV package deal – prices vary by provider – or you can stream all the channels through Discovery+, which costs £30.99 a month, and includes Champions League football.\nWatch Liverpool vs Aston Villa in the US\nLiverpool vs Aston Villa will be broadcast exclusively live in the United States on USA Network.\nTo watch online, you'll need a cord-cutting streaming service such as Sling, Fubo, or YouTube TV.\nHow to watch Liverpool vs Aston Villa in Australia\nPremier League fans in Australia can watch Liverpool vs Aston Villa through Stan Sport.\nWatch the Premier League on Stan Sport\nStan Sport is the new Optus Sport – home to every single Premier League and Champions League live stream.

They haven't won by more than one goal since their opening Friday night against Bournemouth.\nMore alarming still, they haven't kept a clean sheet in any competition since the middle of September. They conceded 41 goals last season and they've allowed 14 already this term.\nSlot might be able to welcome back Ryan Gravenberch and Alexander Isak on Saturday but Alisson, Curtis Jones, Jeremie Frimpong and Giovanni Lioni have all been ruled out.\nTickets\nGet Liverpool tickets at Seat Unique\nSeat Unique tickets at Anfield offer a fantastic matchday.

He is ineligible to play against his parent club at Anfield.\nAfter a poor start, Villa will arrive on Merseyside on the back of four consecutive Premier League wins.\nConfidence is high after victories over Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City but Anfield is not a happy hunting ground.
