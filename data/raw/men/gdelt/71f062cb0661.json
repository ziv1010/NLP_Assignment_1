There have even been rumours of Madrid exploring the possibility of quitting La Liga altogether.\nTebas has taken a dim view so far, unequivocally putting down the idea they could leave Spanish football. Now, in a fresh response, he has hit out at Madrid again, even calling himself \"ashamed\" to have grown up a fan of the club.\n\"Crying,\" he told Europa Press. \"They have built a story that is not true, that there is a global conspiracy, that everyone is against Madrid.\n\"They are trying to enter into a conspiracy theory that is not there. If they win, it is because they have fought against the forces of evil, and if they lose, it is because of a referee conspiracy. It is an insult to the rest of the clubs.\"\nMadrid haven't exactly shied away from controversy in recent years. The club was a founding member of the failed Super League in 2021 and remains one of only two sides, alongside Barcelona, who have steadfastly refused to give up on the project, which had promised to be hugely lucrative to its members but also make elite level club football a closed shop.\nIn October, Madrid shocked the football world by petulantly boycotting the Ballon d'Or ceremony when it became apparent a few hours before the ceremony that Vincius Junior would be beaten to the main prize to rival contender Rodri. Madrid actually won other awards – including team of the year and a coaching gong for Ancelotti – but no delegates were there to receive them.",
