  "body_text": "Manchester United’s hunt for a new striker in the summer is heating up with a lot of reports from Turkey suggesting Victor Osimhen could be Old Trafford-bound.\nThe Nigerian has been on fire for his loan club Galatasaray, netting 29 times while registering six assists in only 34 games. That means a goal involvement on average every 74 minutes.\nThe 26-year-old is open to moving to Manchester even without the prospect of Champions League football on offer, which a huge boost for the Red Devils with Chelsea even leaving the race recently.\nThere were question marks over whether INEOS could afford the Napoli ace’s wage demands but The Peoples Person has relayed that personal terms have been agreed between the striker and the 20-time English league champions.\nFee details\nFurther details have arrived courtesy journalist Aygün Özipek who has now claimed that United have agreed a five-year deal with Napoli for Osimhen for €60 million.\nWhile the former Lille ace has a release clause worth €75 million in his contract, there were reports that the Naples-based outfit were open to offering a discount to United in a bid to thwart Juventus from landing him.\nTrol hesaplar Taraftarı kandırmayın…\nOsimhen, Manchester United ile 5 yıllık anlaşmaya imza attı…\n60 milyon euro bonservis ödenecek..Futbolcu yıllık 15 milyon euro net ücret alacak..\nTürkiye defteri 7 maç sonra sona eriyor…— Aygün Özipek (@aygunozipek) April 19, 2025\nSo this amount is far from ludicrous. The journalist also claims that the Nigeria international will be paid €15 million per season in wages, which amounts to €288,461 per week, something INEOS should not have a problem in paying.\n“Osimhen signs 5-year deal with Manchester United. A transfer fee of 60 million euros will be paid. The football player will receive a net annual salary of 15 million euros,” Özipek wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\nThe wages mentioned are also far less than what initial reports were suggesting and if the Europa League can be secured, paying such a weekly wage should not be an issue.\nThe co-owners are looking to trim the wage bill but are open to paying big salaries to the right profiles, as seen from their contract extension with Bruno Fernandes.\nWages also within INEOS’ limit\nOnly time will tell whether these reports have any truth to them but the fact that multiple outlets are mentioning the same thing suggests some sort of development has taken place behind the scenes.\nThis could also mean the end of Rasmus Hojlund’s time at the club, with Ruben Amorim far from happy with what he has seen from the Dane.\nUnited are not putting all their eggs in one basket however and are keeping backup options ready in case things do not go according to plan.\nIpswich Town’s Liam Delap, Jean-Philippe Mateta of Crystal Palace and Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins are just some of the other targets on the club’s radar.\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
