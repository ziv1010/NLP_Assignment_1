Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nCarrick's to-do list - Four things he must fix quickly to halt slide\nManchester United were incredibly generous leading up to Christmas and over the festive period, handing out points at home to Everton, West Ham, Bournemouth and Wolves before draws away to Leeds and Burnley.\nBut as is stands, they are firmly within touching distance of the Champions League spots, just a point off fifth place.\nEven after being knocked out of the FA Cup, there is still plenty to salvage from the season - if Carrick and his staff can make some quick fixes.\nSolve Sesko's struggles up front\nBenjamin Sesko has had some fleeting moments of promise this season but the jury is still out. At times, the Slovenia international has looked effective foil for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, holding the ball up and linking play intelligently in the final third.\nBut questions over his physicality and unconvincing finishing remain. His performance against Burnley largely summed things up - scoring twice with two excellent finishes in the second-half but only after a thoroughly wretched display in the opening 45 where he could barely keep the ball under control.\nAnother goal against Brighton on Sunday means the 22-year-old has scored more under Darren Fletcher than he did under Amorim. A change of system and playing style has offered early promise.\nAbandon the dreaded 3-4-3\nIt would serve as a huge shock were Carrick to persist with the system that became nothing but a cross to bear for Amorim.\nCarrick very rarely deviated from a 4-2-3-1 formation at Middlesbrough, sometimes to his detriment, with a lack of a 'plan B' often cited as one of the reasons his failed to achieve promotion.\nBut this system appears to be perfectly suited to the Red Devils squad. Too often it has been a case of square pegs in round holes for United over the last year. Simplifying matters may be the interim boss' best course of action in the six months he has.\nReintegrate Mainoo and revive his United fortunes\nAs he may have been privately hoping for all season, Kobbie Mainoo has managed to outlast Ruben Amorim. With no Premier League starts to his name, it has been a miserable campaign but the change in system will surely open up a role in midfield for the 20-year-old.\nUnited are desperately short of the controlling, calm presence Carrick once provided in the engine room. Who better to teach Mainoo the ropes.\nIt's a two-way street - United need inspiration in midfield and Mainoo needs to deliver if he is to stand any chance of forcing his way into Thomas Tuchel's England squad heading to the World Cup next summer. There can be no more excuses.\nUnleash Fernandes in his old role\nRestoring Mainoo to midfield and a shift in system could see Bruno Fernandes restored to the more advanced role where he has historically been at his prolific best in Manchester.\nThe Portugal international scored 44 goals and laid on 35 assists in his 97 games while Carrick served as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's assistant, averaging 0.81 goal contributions per game.\nIt might require some tinkering with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo also in the picture but the rewards could be enormous.\nFernandes has performed admirably in his deeper role this season but it is further up the pitch where he is most dangerous. Amid reports the captain has had enough of Old Trafford, keeping him happy is a top priority.\nTony Mogan, live sports editor,\nSpeaking on BBC Sport’s The Wayne Rooney Show, the 40-year-old former England captain said: ‘I was with him in Barbados last week! So obviously none of us saw this coming. Michael is a very clever person and he’ll command respect from the dressing room.’\nAsked if he would join Carrick’s staff if asked, Rooney laughed. ‘Of course I would! I think it’s a no-brainer if that’s the situation.\n‘I think what the club needs is people around the place, whether Michael goes in, whether Fletch (Darren Fletcher), John O’Shea, myself, you need people around who know the football club, (people like) Roy Keane…\n‘Having people who know the club, who care for the club, people who understand what it takes to be a Manchester United player. I think that’s where the club needs to be.\n‘We spoke earlier in this season about how it’s lost that identity, that family feel. I think it’s a great opportunity to bring the spirit of Manchester United back into the club.’\nRuben Amorim was sacked as United boss on January 5, a day after making pointed comments in a post-match press conference at Leeds, to bring to an end a 14-month reign in which United slumped to a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.\nMore Trending\nFormer United and Scotland midfielder Darren Fletcher took charge of the team on a temporary basis, but saw his side held to a 2-2 draw at Burnley last Wednesday night before they were knocked out of the FA Cup in a 2-1 home defeat to Brighton on Sunday.\nUnited’s next match is at home to rivals Manchester City on Saturday. Players had two pre-planned days off on Monday and Tuesday before reporting back to Carrington on Wednesday.\nUnited have also held talks with Solskjaer, who was previously in charge from December 2018 to November 2021, having initially been named as caretaker following Mourinho’s exit before taking the job on a permanent basis.\nThe Norwegian earned a second-placed finish in the Premier League and guided the club to the Europa League final in the 2020-21 campaign, but was dismissed after a poor start the following season.\nMORE: Wayne Rooney disagrees with Gary Neville over the ‘outstanding candidate’ for Manchester United job\nMORE: Man Utd’s stance on hiring Xabi Alonso after shock Real Madrid exit\nMORE: Ruben Amorim tipped for shock Premier League job after Manchester United sacking",
