  "body_text": "Xabi Alonso was Kop’s ‘chosen one’ – now Liverpool must find man to win hearts and minds\nThere are Liverpool fans who remember what they were doing on the day Jürgen Klopp announced he would be leaving Anfield.\nIt is testament to the regard in which Xabi Alonso is held, that just as many will recall the sense of deflation the moment they learned the legendary midfielder is unlikely to replace him.\nThe script was written for Fenway Sports Group’s new football supremo Michael Edwards. In a grand romantic gesture he was to unveil Alonso at an Anfield press conference and try to convince a cynical world that the succession plan was not designed and executed in the immediate aftermath of Klopp informing the owners of his intentions last November.\nAlonso – who has previously spoken of a long-term desire to return to the club he graced for four years – would walk briskly into the Anfield press conference and talk about offers that could not be refused, his re-acquaintance with the Kop one of those resplendent moments when an elite sportsperson was listening to heart and head.\nWith good reason, these alluring, imagined scenes were embraced by a Liverpool audience seeking the reassurance of familiarity as they prepared for life without Klopp.\nAlonso’s cultured brand of football, combined with his intelligence and intuitive understanding of the club where he won the Champions League in 2005, made him the perfect fit for a squad which is already built to compete for the highest honours.\nKlopp’s praise of the Bayer Leverkusen coach – describing him as the ‘stand-out’ among the next generation –served only to fuel those who believed Alonso ‘the chosen one’, as if the agreements were already in place behind the scenes.\nAlas, there was no such choreography. Those early whispers that Alonso was not sure the time was right to follow Klopp became more audible, culminating in Liverpool realising they must move on to ensure they do not miss out on those they regard as equally strong candidates.\nIt should be emphasised that Alonso’s immediate emergence as a potential successor to Klopp was independent of his Liverpool connections. Had he never played for the club, those tasked with presenting data files on Europe’s hottest talents would hardly have ignored a 42-year-old on the threshold of breaking Bayern Munich’s stranglehold on the Bundesliga.\nLiverpool’s next appointment will not be, and was never going to be, based on emotional ties. Liverpool can argue with some justification that the stirring of the soul whenever Alonso’s name was referenced was a strictly external exercise.\nNevertheless, at a club like Liverpool – especially in the immediate aftermath of Klopp’s era where high emotion has been a potent weapon – sentimentality should never be demeaned when players and coaches have the skills to match.\nThe advantage Alonso had over the rest was that he would not have had to work to create the same bond with the Kop that Klopp has enjoyed. It was cemented on that miraculous evening in Istanbul 19 years ago when he scored the equaliser in the 3-3 draw with AC Milan. Alonso would have been required only to say ‘hola’ to guarantee the patience and time required to tweak the team to serve his vision.\nMore in Sports\nNow, the challenge for Edwards and incoming sporting director Richard Hughes is to find someone equally equipped to win hearts and minds.\nOf the leading candidates still under consideration, Ruben Amorim or Roberto De Zerbi will have to rely on that old-fashioned virtue of first winning lots of football matches and delivering high level performances.\nBoth possess admirable qualities, which is why they are short-listed. But whereas Alonso’s approval rating stood at 100 per cent, the coming weeks will see the pros and cons of Klopp’s potential successors subjected to heated debate. Some will find the idea of an explosive Italian on the touchline enticing, especially if he adds a Kop legend steeped in Klopp’s methodology to his coaching staff (a James Milner Anfield return, anyone?). Others will be intrigued by a young Portuguese coach who has demonstrated the Midas touch in a short coaching career.\nWith Alonso seemingly out of the running, Liverpool have undoubtedly lost their unity candidate.\nForensic interest in Bayer Leverkusen’s results and performances may now subside for the remaining months of the season. For the moment, all roads in the hunt for Klopp’s successor lead towards Lisbon and Brighton.",
