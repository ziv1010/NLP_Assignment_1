But on Friday, the sporting director Dan Ashworth sat down with reporters to offer an executive-level perspective on Tonali, the January window, potential Saudi Pro League loan deals and more.\nHere, The Athletic presents what Ashworth said and analyses what it means for Newcastle…\nWhat happened with the Tonali transfer?\nThe past three weeks have not only harmed Newcastle’s on-field prospects this season but they have also been embarrassing for the club and deeply distressing for Tonali.\nThe 23-year-old arrived from AC Milan for £55million ($67.7m) in July, a record for an Italian player, and his signing was viewed as a huge coup given his international status and his pedigree as a Serie A winner.\nYet the betting scandal that has engulfed Italian football spread to Tonali last month and, in rapid time, he has gone from Newcastle’s statement summer signing to serving a 10-month suspension from football.\n“It was a massive shock, a massive surprise,” says Ashworth, who first became aware of the allegations on social media during the October international break. “Dealing with it was new to all of us. It came from nowhere.\n“Our first thought was to protect our player and to give him the help and support he needed. We wanted to understand exactly what had happened and work transparently with the authorities. Sandro wanted to do that from the off as well. It was a bit of a whirlwind. We got to where we were on Friday (before the 2-2 draw at Wolverhampton Wanderers last month), where the ban had been signed off and agreed with the Italian federation, FIFA and our own Football Association.”\nAs soon as news emerged of Tonali’s gambling addiction — his agent, Beppe Riso, referred to the midfielder’s “illness” last month — Newcastle supporters questioned whether Milan knew at the time of sale that a potential investigation was imminent. Newcastle are assuming Milan acted in good faith during negotiations unless they conclusively find out otherwise.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s really difficult for me to get into what other clubs do or don’t know,” Ashworth says. “All we can do is look at our own internal investigation and internal process. It’s a really difficult question for me to answer — I just don’t know (what Milan knew).”\nAshworth declined to comment on whether Newcastle are looking into prospective litigation against Milan but, given the value of the transfer, such legal routes are at least being considered behind the scenes.\nYet Ashworth insists he does not foresee a frosty atmosphere during the pre-match lunch with Milan executives on Tyneside ahead of Newcastle’s Champions League fixture on December 13. “There have been no conversations since,” he says, “but we’ll welcome them to St James’ Park, as we have with (Borussia) Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain. We’re looking forward to the game.”\nNewcastle and Tonali have sought to expedite the process from the moment the midfielder was interviewed by police at Italy’s Coverciano training ground last month to ensure his ban was issued as quickly as possible. Tonali has admitted to gambling and struck a plea bargain with the FIGC to reduce an automatic three-year ban to 10 months, plus a further eight months’ rehabilitation.\nAlthough the current ban has been ratified by FIFA, the English FA have now confirmed they have launched an investigation of their own to ascertain whether Tonali continued betting on football following his move to England. There remains the potential for them to issue a further suspension.\nGO DEEPER\nFA investigating if Tonali broke betting rules after Newcastle transfer\n“What I can say to you, as a football club and (with) Sandro, we have fully cooperated with all of the associations, organisations and related parties,” Ashworth says. “The FA are, of course, fully aware of what’s going on. They are the ones who had to sanction the ban, so we’re fully cooperating with everybody.”\nAdvertisement\nPushed as to whether the FA could sanction another ban, Ashworth says: “All I can deal with is the present and the facts. I can’t look into the future and, as I’ve said, we’ve cooperated fully with all of the organisations.”\nRegardless, with Tonali unable to represent Newcastle in competitive fixtures until August 27, 2024, the club has explored whether his lucrative salary could be reduced during that time.\n“Any player’s contract situation is private and confidential,” says Ashworth. “All I can say is that Sandro has been outstanding since this has happened and has been fully collaborative. He’s been an outstanding professional in that context. Beyond that, I cannot comment because it’s private and confidential.”\nWhat can Newcastle do now?\nThe sporting director did not confirm or deny that Tonali’s wages have been or will be reduced during his suspension, stating that you “could look at it” and suggest the midfielder is in breach of his contract, but “there is always an amount of flexibility with that”.\n“As a club, we go back to how well Sandro has reacted and acted since it came to the fore,” he says. “Like any person, you take into consideration how you’ve acted after an event.”\nAs of yet, Tonali has not issued a public apology to Newcastle or supporters but, while Ashworth did not confirm he has done so privately, the sporting director is adamant the midfielder has shown contrition.\n“Sandro is a top human being and this is a difficult situation for him to deal with,” says Ashworth. “He feels he’s let himself down and any player who is missing for a prolonged period feels bad about it. Sometimes there is nothing you can do in case of an injury, but I have to reiterate he has been a top-class individual and professional about this.”\nRegardless, there has been scrutiny of Newcastle’s recruitment processes and background-check procedures and the ultimate responsibility lies with the sporting director. He self-analyses repeatedly and has done so regarding the Tonali deal.\nAdvertisement\nAn internal investigation has been launched to determine whether Newcastle can improve their protocols. The scope of the inquiry is wide, with recruitment, the legal outlook on drawing up contracts, due diligence methodology, reference collection, and the overall checks-and-balances process for transfers being evaluated.\nDr Ian Mitchell has also been appointed as head of psychology and his department will become involved in background checks. However, Newcastle will not use private investigators in an attempt to find out greater information about prospective signings.\n“From the minute it happened, you look at yourself. What could we have done better? What could I have done better? What lessons can be learned from this? Could we have known? Should we have known? You look at your processes,” Ashworth says. “I’ve been doing this for 16 years and nothing like this has happened before.\n“We pride ourselves on due diligence and getting the right characters. You have all seen the culture and cohesion in the group are extremely strong — and that’s not by chance. We spend an immense amount of time looking at the character as well as the athlete.\n“We have and will continue to review what we have done in the past and will do going forward. It’s tricky about what you can and can’t know about people in this world of GDPR (general data protection regulation) and what you can and can’t check. First of all, I look at myself. Speaking to other sporting and technical directors it’s almost like, ‘How could you have known?’. That would not stop us trying to get as much due diligence on people going forward to try to mitigate the risk.”\nGO DEEPER\nDevastation, tension and love: Howe and Newcastle react to the Tonali betting investigation\nWhat next for Tonali?\nThe next 10 months will be “difficult” for Tonali, as Howe explained on Friday, with the player facing the psychological challenge of dealing with being unable to play. Newcastle, too, must learn to cope without an international midfielder while also navigating an injury crisis, with left-back-turned-emergency-defensive-midfielder Matt Targett the latest player ruled out.\n“Sandro is a top player and a big signing — we will miss him,” Ashworth says. “To contextualise it, it could have been an ACL (anterior cruciate ligament injury). These things happen in football, although not in this context.”\nAdvertisement\nAs with injury rehabilitation, Newcastle will look to build up the Italian’s load during his absence from the first team so that he is physically ready to play as soon as he returns.\nBut unlike Ivan Toney, who was unable to train with Brentford for part of his suspension for betting offences, Tonali is permitted to take part in full sessions with his team-mates and has done so this week, even if he will also have an individualised programme to follow. He will therefore remain on Tyneside rather than return to Italy for prolonged periods.\nThe midfielder will also be at St James’ Park for home matches and may travel with the squad to away games, even though he is unable to play competitively until August. Confusion still surrounds whether Tonali can feature during mid-season and pre-season friendlies, with Newcastle seeking “absolute clarity” from FIFA, but he can play in intra-squad matches.\nWhile injured players receive mental coaching during periods out, Tonali must also deal with his addiction and will receive pastoral care.\n“From a mental side of things, we have to support him both in Italy and here,” Ashworth says. “The first three months are quite tough because you are going into a new situation where you don’t have that fix of a game, and that is what players want. The second (middle) part is the tough bit because you’ve got over the first hurdle of not playing and you’re not quite at pre-season where you can start ramping up, getting your mind and body ready to start playing high-level football again in the middle of August.”\nUncomfortable contradictions remain considering Newcastle have three betting sponsors and Tonali will eventually return to play in front of hoardings which advertise gambling, something Ashworth refused to be drawn on. But the club is looking to re-educate players at all levels, including the academy, about gambling.\nNewcastle are determined to help Tonali return “an even better player”, as Howe puts it, and feel no resentment towards the midfielder.\nAdvertisement\nThat is, Ashworth insists, a view shared at board level of a club which is 80 per cent owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF). “In my experience with the board and the owners, they are incredibly supportive and empathetic people who want to support their family.”\nGO DEEPER\n'Some players bet on football - they know it's breaking the rules but still do it'\nOn January — and potential Saudi loans\nNewcastle’s January transfer plans have been revised following Tonali’s suspension. Whereas a midfielder was not necessarily foremost on Howe’s wanted list a month ago, it certainly is now.\nBut do Newcastle have the means to strengthen in January given the resources they committed to Tonali?\nLewis Hall arrived from Chelsea in August on loan with an obligation to buy, primarily because Newcastle were so close to their financial fair play (FFP) limit. The club attempt to do the majority of their business during summer windows but are willing to bring future spending forward for the right player, as they did last January with the £40million purchase of Anthony Gordon.\n“We do have a little bit of flexibility and we can look at the market,” Ashworth says. “But there are lots of ways to do it. We are going to have to be quite creative and there will not be a large number of players coming in, but we do want to be active. We want to strengthen the squad and give us the best possible chance of success.\n“But if the right player does not come up, we won’t do anything.”\nInterestingly, Ashworth stresses that a potential recruit does not necessarily need to be a “like-for-like replacement” for Tonali, despite midfield being “the key area we wanted to strengthen in the summer”. With Elliot Anderson’s encouraging early season displays and Lewis Miley’s emergence, another position may be fortified instead — in the same way that Gordon, a versatile forward, replaced Chris Wood, an out-and-out striker, last January.\nAdvertisement\nNewcastle are considering a wide variety of options to maximise their limited budget, including loans with options and obligations.\nWhat’s more, they are also open to loaning a player from the Saudi Pro League. Such a transfer would be controversial given PIF now owns four Saudi clubs and bankrolled the league’s big-money summer recruitment drive.\nHowever, Al Hilal’s Ruben Neves regularly featured on Newcastle’s recruitment lists while he was at Wolverhampton Wanderers before his £47million move in June. Al Ahli’s Gabriel Veiga is also among the other Saudi-based players Newcastle’s scouts admire and, should an opportunity present itself, Ashworth did not refute that the club would look into it.\n“The current rules and regulations say there is nothing to stop it… currently,” says Ashworth when asked if other Premier League clubs would attempt to prevent such a transfer. “But there is the potential that the various organisations will look at things across related parties and what you can do to acquire players at a fair market value, which have already been in place for quite a while.\n“We have got to do what is best for this football club and get the best players we possibly can for the budget we have — and that is what my job is.”\nThat sentiment echoes Howe’s previous remarks about Newcastle being around to “compete” and not to “be liked”. The ownership’s ambition is endless and, even with the Tonali setback, Newcastle will look to grasp every opportunity possible to continue their progress on and off the field — no matter how their Premier League rivals feel about it.\nGO DEEPER\nHow Newcastle could replace Sandro Tonali: Signings, loans and Saudi Arabia\n(Top photo: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United via Getty Images)",
