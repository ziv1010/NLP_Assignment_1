Pictures on his wife's Facebook page show them enjoying holidays with their children including a ski trip last February\nEngland is married to Filippa, the director of teaching and learning at a school academy trust\nBarnsley-born Darren England made his English Football League debut as a referee in 2015\nDarren England's assistant VAR Dan Cook is from Waterlooville in Hampshire and had a wife called Jenna (pictured together at Wembley Stadium), but they have since separated\nEngland, 37, was the leading VAR when his mix-up led to him wrongly advising that Díaz had been correctly ruled offside in the clash in North London.\nEngland's ruling meant that Liverpool were not awarded a goal, to the astonishment of fans and officials from the Merseyside club which went on to lose the match 2-1.\nThe PGMOL blamed England's shocking decision on a 'significant human error'.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has since called for the match to be replayed.\nLand Registry records reveal that England and his wife Filippa, 41, who have two daughters, paid £725,000 in July last year for their luxury home on an exclusive private cul-de-sac.\nFilippa is the director of teaching and learning at a school academy trust.\nPictures on his wife's Facebook page show them enjoying sunshine holidays with their children including a break in France this summer and a ski trip last February.\nNeighbours of the couple are fiercely protective of the match official and today refused to discuss anything about him.\nOne neighbour at first denied knowing England, but when a reporter told him that he was from MailOnline, he replied: 'I thought you might be'.\nReferee Darren England during another Premier League match between Burnley and Tottenham Hotspur at Turf Moor on September 2\nPGMOL admitted that a 'significant human error' had led to Luis Diaz's goal being disallowed and have since released the audio of VAR's discussion with the on-field referee to the public\nBarnsley-born England made his English Football League debut as a referee in 2015 after officiating at Football Conference games for several years.\nHe started refereeing Championship matches in the 2016/17 season with his first game being QPR's 2-1 victory over Cardiff in March 2017.\nHis colleague Cook, 35, is from Waterlooville in Hampshire, and has separated from his glamourous wife Jenna, MailOnline can reveal.\nA friend told MailOnline: 'Dan and Jenna are no longer together. They have not been together for a while now.'\nA neighbour added: 'I used to see them together all the time but they have separated and I haven't seen Dan for ages.'\nIt has emerged that England's mistake arose after he incorrectly thought that the on-field referee - Simon Hooper - had awarded Diaz's goal, and that VAR had only been asked to confirm whether it was the right call.\nEngland's wrong assumption meant that he told the on-field team 'check complete' after quickly checking that Diaz was onside.\nHooper took his statement as agreeing with the linesman's decision to put his flag up and rule Diaz as offside.\nThe Liverpool manager argues with fourth official Michael Oliver (left) after the VAR blunder\nEngland's embarrassing error led to Liverpool winger Luis Díaz being robbed of a goal\nThe disallowed strike came just three minutes before Son Heung-min's opener for Tottenham\nPGMOL released the VAR audio of the disallowed goal on Tuesday night as part of its drive for transparency.\nThe audio showed that the replay operator appeared to realise that a mistake had been made, saying 'Wait, wait, wait, wait' immediately after play was restarted with a Spurs free-kick.\nThe operator questioned England and his deputy Cook about his ruling, saying: 'The on-field decision was offside. Are you happy with this?'\nEngland could be heard in the audio, yelling, 'Oh f***' when he realised his error 22 seconds later, before insisting 'I can't do anything'.\nThe International Football Association Board, which is the game's global rule-making body, states that referees cannot undertake a review of a decision once play has restarted, except in cases of mistaken identity or for a potential red-card offence.\nEngland's ruling left Liverpool seething with anger and releasing a statement saying that it has resulted 'in sporting integrity being undermined'.\nThe club's statement added: 'We fully accept the pressures that match officials work under but these pressures are supposed to be alleviated, not exacerbated, by the existence and implementation of VAR.\n'It is therefore unsatisfactory that sufficient time was not afforded to allow the correct decision to be made and that there was no subsequent intervention.\n'That such failings have already been categorised as 'significant human error' is also unacceptable.'\nThe club said it would 'explore the range of options available, given the clear need for escalation and resolution.'\nThe mistake in the first half proved to be crucial as Liverpool fell behind to a Heung-min Son goal, with the Merseyside club's Curtis Jones also being sent off in the first half.\nLiverpool equalised just before the break with a Cody Gakpo goal, but the Reds were reduced to nine men after Diogo Jota was shown two yellow cards in quick succession.\nThe club's Joel Matip then scored an own goal in the sixth minute of injury time to give victory to Tottenham.\nIt was revealed this week that England and Cook had respectively officiated at a match in the United Arab Emirates just 48 hours before the Liverpool game.\nBut the PGMOL played down suggestions that they may have been suffering from mental fatigue or tiredness.\nOfficials said that the pair's trip had been comparable with refereeing a midweek Champions League or Europa League tie.\nBut the body said on Monday that it and the Football Association would review the policy that allows officials to officiate matches outside Fifa and Uefa appointments.\nPGMOL's statement added that it recognised 'standards fell short of expectations'.\nThe Premier League also confirmed it was undertaking a full review of VAR procedures after describing the Díaz incident as revealing 'systemic failures'.\nAs a result of the controversy, England and Cook have been omitted from the referee appointments this week.\nKlopp said today that the release of the audio conversation between officials and the VAR had made little difference to their thinking.\n'The audio didn't change it at all. It is an obvious mistake,' he said. 'I think there should be solutions for that. I think the outcome should be a replay.\n'The argument against that would be it opens the gates. It is unprecedented, it has not happened before.\n'I'm used to wrong and difficult decisions, but something like this never happened and so that is why I think a replay is the right thing to do.'\nOn whether the club had asked - or would ask - the Premier League for a replay formally, Klopp added: 'At this stage we are still going through the information we have.'\nKlopp said it would have been much better to have corrected the mistake the moment it happened and he wants a protocol put in place to avoid similar problems recurring.\n'If you have this situation first time, you try to understand, and try to find a solution, but that doesn't solve the problem. How can we sort not just for the future, but this situation?' he added.\n'If that would happen again, I would say replay. Or much, much better than a replay - sort it in that moment. Common sense.\n'If a replay happens or not, it's just my opinion.'\nIt is understood that the Premier League's stance remains the same as earlier in the week - that a replay would not be considered.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- Glamorous Olympic skating star masterfully avoids disaster\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Leo Ross's killer unmasked: Thug who stabbed schoolboy to death named\n- Moment hi-viz thugs attack bin men in terrifying mass brawl\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack",
