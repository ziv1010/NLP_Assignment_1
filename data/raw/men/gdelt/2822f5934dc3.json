The record was set by Bojan Krkic when he scored for Barcelona in 2008 aged 17 years and 217 days, while Jude Bellingham, who scored for Borussia Dortmund in 2021 aged 17 years and 289 days, is second.\nIf Arsenal’s eye-catching academy graduate can continue the blistering form that he has already shown this season and ripple the net just twice more, he will topple a record held by some of England’s most iconic teenagers.\nThe attacking midfielder has now chalked up eight goals in 28 games in all competitions. That goal return puts him within touching distance of Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney, who scored nine goals each in all competitions when they were aged 17 or younger. Nwaneri now has three goes at matching – or even beating that record – before he turns 18 on March 21.\nArteta is adamant that Nwaneri won’t need any more motivation when he’s out on the pitch.\n“I don’t think that he needs any pushing,” said the Arsenal boss. “You see him every time he has the ball what the intention is, so if it comes, it comes, and it’s great.\n“I’m really impressed with the way he behaved and the way he played. It’s about consistency and now doing it again three days later in another big stadium.”\nArteta also took a moment to revel in his players netting the club’s biggest ever away win in the Champions League.\nHe said: “It’s something that hasn’t been done so it’s great to be a part of that, but as a team we want to achieve many other things that are far more important than that.\n“I am happy because we are in a very strong position to go to the next round which is where we want to be, but there’s still a job to do for sure in London in a week’s time.”\nQuickly setting his sights on the game at United this Sunday, Arteta added: “Well, it [the win over PSV] obviously gives us a lot of joy, confidence and belief, and then in football, it’s not what we did three days ago, or today – it’s about what we’re going to do tomorrow, or at Old Trafford, how we behave and [are we] able to win again.\n“Enjoy tonight because it was a very impressive performance, an unbelievable score, so we deserve that, and now take that, and keep improving as a team.”",
