  "body_text": "The pitch from sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic and technical director Marco Neppe included a mood film about Bayern (the club) and Munich (the city) that has reportedly worked wonders with new recruits in the past. But it also came with a rather unusual job offer.\n“We don’t want you as a defender,” the German champions told Matthijs de Ligt. “We want you to be the boss of the defence.”\nAdvertisement\nBayern recognised that David Alaba’s departure to Real Madrid in 2021 had left a leadership vacuum at the heart of the back line. The Austrian had coached his team-mates incessantly, ensuring that the wide open spaces behind the side’s high line were covered as well as possible by the two or three players not involved in attacks.\nAlaba’s positional sense and a voice loud enough to travel vast distances wasn’t enough to stop the Bavarians’ defensive organisation crumble in Hansi Flick’s second season (1.29 goals conceded per 90 minutes), however. It only partially recovered under Julian Nagelsmann in 2021-22 (1.09 per 90). De Ligt, club bosses hoped, would re-instil a sense of order in the new campaign.\nQuite an endorsement, really. Or perhaps a burden?\n“No,” the 23-year-old says. “(Bayern) said exactly the things that I like to hear. I’m a good defender. But I can help the team most by leading the defence, helping others and making sure we stay focused. They said they had missed that bit, that they saw a good role for me in that respect. I was really happy they perceived me that way.\n“That was a big reason to come here.”\nDefenders are said to peak a little later in their careers, but De Ligt has been used to being a key player at a relatively tender age. Peter Bosz gave the Ajax academy product his first-team debut in 2016, a month after his 17th birthday. The following year, he became the youngest player to start a European final, but Ajax lost 2-0 in their Europa League final against Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United.\nThen came Erik ten Hag. “The most important coach for my development,” he says. “Even at 18, he saw me as someone who could lead a team, who could lead by example, who could be a good captain.”\nDe Ligt was named Ajax’s youngest captain when Ten Hag handed him the armband in March 2018 — 12 months later, he led them to the semi-finals of the Champions League. “I was growing into that role. I became more confident and realised I could make a difference. That really helped me develop, also mentally,” he says. A €75million (£66.3m; $80.1m) move to Juventus followed.\nAdvertisement\nDe Ligt played three solid seasons in Serie A, winning one scudetto. But critics zoomed in on his mistakes. “De Ligt went to Italy to learn how to defend but I don’t think he learned much there,” former Netherlands striker and ex-national team manager Marco van Basten sniffed in 2021.\n“I was 19, I had captained Ajax, and there was a lot of pressure on me that I found difficult,” De Ligt says with surprising honesty. “I was still really young. I went from a kid who did everything well at Ajax to a defender at Juventus, where every little thing I did wrong was seen by everybody.”\nThat focus on the negative, he says, was “really hard for me”. “I was feeling the pressure.”\nPeace of mind came by way of adopting a different outlook and a narrower focus. “I slowly changed my mentality to understand what kind of player I am and what I can do for the team with my qualities. You couldn’t ask me to dribble past opponents and score or to play the perfect pass every single time. I know that I can do it sometimes, but it’s not my natural skill.\n“My natural quality is to be always focused, to be ready to fight, to lead, to try to be as consistent as possible, instead of trying to show everybody what I can do (on the ball) or show everybody how good I am (on the ball). You need someone who always plays like a six and a half or a seven (out of 10) instead of sometimes an eight and then a four. That’s the different mindset I have now. And I feel that game by game, I’m getting better, I’m getting more experienced.”\nContrary to Van Basten’s dismissive take, Italy did prove an education. “I learned a lot from my three coaches at Juventus.” De Ligt says. “Man-marking from Maurizio Sarri, playing out from the back from Andrea Pirlo, and ‘pure defending’ from Massimiliano Allegri.”\nUnsurprisingly, playing next to Giorgio Chiellini didn’t do much harm either. “He’s so smart and so strong, tactically so good,” De Ligt says. “He always said to me, ‘If you use your body together with your tactical intuition, it’s a good combination’. He’s a really, really good defender, one of the best in the world.\nAdvertisement\n“I’m grateful to all the people I’ve learned from. But in the end, you learn most from yourself, by making different experiences in different situations. That makes you a better player.”\nBayern had been sold on him well before. There was contact before his transfer to Juventus and Ten Hag, the former coach of Bayern’s second team, recommended he should move to southern Germany. “It didn’t happen at the time. Bayern still has a special place in Ten Hag’s heart. He was really happy for me that I could move (in the summer), he congratulated me. I have also spoken to Arjen Robben about the club years ago. But this time, I didn’t need to ask anyone’s advice. I already knew that I wanted to go to Munich.”\nThe league leaders have only lost one game all season, 1-0 away to Augsburg in September, but Bayern’s high-risk approach in possession has forced De Ligt to adapt his game. “In Italy, defenders run the least amount of kilometres in the team, here it’s different: I almost run the most.”\nQuick opponents and a very direct approach often turn matches into “ping pong games,” he says, which necessitates more running still.\n“With my power and pace, I can dominate opponents, but I’m not one of those defenders who can simply outrun everyone. I’m relying a lot on the mental side of the game. My biggest strength is reading the game and anticipating what’s happening. Physically, playing at this level is hard enough. But it’s even harder on a mental level for a defender. You can play the best game and then lose your marker in the last minute and it’s game over. It’s hard to keep up that level of concentration — not just every three days, but in training as well.”\nDe Ligt says that, once the final whistle sounds, he hardly remembers what happened during a game. “I’m so focused on myself and on the team that I can’t really tell you afterwards if any particular player had a good game or not. Once, somebody said to me, ‘Wow, the crowd were really loud today’, and I went, ‘Oh boy, I didn’t even hear them’. It’s a quality to be able to focus this much, but it can be mentally tough, too, because it’s hard to switch off.”\nHe often meditates before matches and enjoys walks with his girlfriend that clear his mind. “These things help me switch off but I have to become better at that. I need to think less about football.”\nThat is easier said than done.\nAn avid reader, De Ligt finds himself drawn to football books and defenders’ memoirs in particular. “I’ve read autobiographies from Per Mertesacker, Jaap Stam, Sol Campbell, John Terry… you name them, I’ve read them. It helps me improve my game, drawing on their experiences. They sometimes say things that make you think you’re not alone.\nAdvertisement\n“For example, if you make a mistake, you feel as if it’s the end of the world when you’re young. But they would say, ‘No, it isn’t. It really isn’t’. I’ve learned a lot from that.”\nDe Ligt’s “purist” streak is especially useful at Bayern, who rarely field too many players with an overly defensive mindset. “We have so many amazing players on the ball — they are so technical, so fast, so good with their feet,” he says. “My role right now is to provide the balance. If you have 11 players attacking, it’s going to be a disaster. If you have 11 players who are only defending, it’s also going to be a disaster. You have to have that mix. It was a little bit like that at Ajax as well, with me and Nicolas Tagliafico the furthest back. I enjoyed that. I feel the same here.”\nBayern’s constantly changing back line craves stability, especially as the season-defining Champions League tie against Paris Saint-Germain and their array of attacking talent approaches.\nLucas Hernandez (ruptured anterior cruciate ligament) is out. Left-back Alphonso Davies and centre-back Benjamin Pavard have been out of form. The loan signing from Manchester City, Joao Cancelo, is still acclimatising, while the other right-back, Noussair Mazraoui, recovers from a heart complaint. And there’s also a new keeper, of course, with Yann Sommer in for the injured Manuel Neuer.\nOnly De Ligt and Frenchman Dayot Upamecano have played with any semblance of consistency since August. Statistically, the team have defended better than last season, conceding 0.13 fewer goals per game. But there is a feeling in Munich that they are not quite yet the finished article. Neither, by his own very frank admission, is the man they call “Matta” in the dressing room.\n“It’s a constant battle of becoming a better player,” De Ligt adds. “Every season, I want to be better than the previous one. It’s good to look at certain numbers — how many sprints, how many duels won — but a lot of stuff that defenders do doesn’t show up in the stats.\n“I want to feel confident, I want to feel dominant, I want to feel that my team-mates trust me and that the opposition striker says to himself, ‘Oh no! Today, I have to play against Matthijs de Ligt, that will be a tough game’. With every game and every week, it becomes a bit more like that.\nAdvertisement\n“I’m progressing. I’ve developed quite well since coming here, but I can still help the team more. I can improve everything. That’s what I aim for, every day in training: to become the best player I can be.”\nBayern’s new boss wasn’t born to run. But if his quest for self-optimisation bears fruit, glory days shouldn’t be far off.\n(Top photo: Roland Krivec/DeFodi Images via Getty Images)",
