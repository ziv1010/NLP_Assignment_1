  "body_text": "It has become pretty clear at the start of this season that Chelsea have a long way to go if they want to compete for the biggest prizes in football. They have fallen significantly behind in the Premier League title race. And when it comes to European football, considering the relative ease with which Bayern Munich defeated, it is hard to imagine that they'll have a deep run in the Champions League.\nOf course, things can change quickly in football. Some players might find their form, others might return from injury and we'd be looking at a very different Chelsea team a few months later. But as things stand now, they are nowhere near good enough when compared to the very best in England and Europe.\nSo, the club need to go out and make some quality signings in the upcoming transfer windows. They need to bring in some proven players, not just more youngsters with potential.\nThere have been some suggestions that Morgan Rogers is Chelsea's top transfer target moving forward. But the Blues' chances of signing him from Aston Villa have been handed a blow.\nChelsea handed £80m transfer blow by Fabrizio Romano\nAs reported by Fabrizio Romano, Aston Villa are working on a new contract for Rogers. Talks are at an early phase with the player after the club rejected several approaches in the summer.\nOf course, that is bad news for Chelsea. If Aston Villa are able to agree a new contract with Rogers, it would make it a lot more difficult for the Blues to sign him.\nMany would even question whether it is worth making a big money move for Rogers. He is the reigning PFA Young Player of the Year. But his start to this campaign has been nowhere near the mark. So, questions need to be asked about how good he really is.",
