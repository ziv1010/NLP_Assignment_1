The Scotland international has not played since scoring in the 2-0 triumph over Everton on 8 April.”\nTom Heaton was present during the team session.\nAcademy duo Omari Forson and Daniel Gore also took part in the work-out.\nThe most notable absentee was Marcel Sabitzer. It was confirmed earlier this week that the Austrian is ruled out for the rest of the season with an injury.\nWhether Sabitzer plays again for the Red Devils depends on whether United try to permanently sign him from Bayern Munich when the summer transfer window opens.\nFollow The Peoples Person on Twitter or Instagram for all the latest news as it happens and to join in the conversation.",
