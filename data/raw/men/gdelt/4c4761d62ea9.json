We don’t win five Premier Leagues in six years if we are not a good team.\n“We kind of know we are a good team but to be recognised globally as one of the best teams you need to win the Champions League.\n“We are not beating around the bush with that, we know this is now a great opportunity, we have a second chance definitely with Pep and the group of players who have stayed around and we need to put right the wrongs we did against Chelsea.”\nHowever, City are not only chasing their first elusive Champions League in Istanbul but a place in the history books.\nVictory would complete a Champions League-Premier League-FA Cup treble only previously achieved by neighbours Manchester United in 1999.\nTo secure that would add that extra veneer of validation to Guardiola’s side and Walker admits it is a motivating factor.\n“Of course, I think that United team, along with the Invincibles (Arsenal’s 2003-2004 side), is probably up there with the best Premier League teams of all time,” said the England defender.\n“What us and Liverpool, to a certain extent, have done where we have been battling for the last number of years I think (means) we should be in consideration.\n“Both teams have fantastic players but they have got the big Champions League trophy that we can never say we have got.\n“For us to be in contention of being talking around that we need to go and pick up this but by no stretch of the imagination do we just turn up on Saturday and we win it.”\nGuardiola has admitted he got the game plan wrong in 2021, after surprisingly dropping his first-choice holding midfielder Rodri.\nBut Walker said the players who experienced that defeat could now use it as a positive.\n“I don’t think any team goes straight to the final and wins it,” he said.\n“I think you always have to go through setbacks, those nearly games, those losses.\n“Even with the national team, each step of the way, we have got to a semi-final, got to a final, and hopefully big things are around the corner.\n“I think all big teams have to go through setbacks to actually maybe give you the little bit of desire.\n“We’ve been there. When you walk out (for the first time), hear the anthem playing and see the cup you think ‘Oh my gosh, it’s actually happening now’.\n“Now, when you walk out, you know you’ve been here before and it is just about playing your football and trusting the people around you.\n“Erling (Haaland) is popping up with the goals, Kevin (De Bruyne) is popping up with the assists so I think we will be all right.”",
