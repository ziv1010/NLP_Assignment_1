It’s outstanding\n“The under-21s won titles, the young teams compete to win titles, the women’s team won titles, so we are there and the federation is there.\n“One of the big reasons (for taking the job) was the knowledge and the quality of the federation – to have that at my side – and combine it with my ideas and build on everything Gareth Southgate and the FA built, and hopefully we can add a little bit extra to get us over the line.\n“The offer came at absolutely the right time. We found a vision to share and an adventure that I’m very happy to be a big part of.\n“Now I have to live up to it, of course, and I know there are some trophies missing in the federation. Of course I want to help to make it happen.”\nTuchel knows what it is like to lose a big final – the 2020 Champions League with Paris St Germain – but also what it takes to win one – in the same competition with Chelsea a year later.\nThat tournament pedigree will have been a big factor in attracting the FA to Tuchel, but the German said it was not his place to say why England had just fallen short at the last two Euros.\nHe added: “It’s just nuances, it’s just details. If you lose on penalties in a final, who would I be to say I know what you did wrong when you were there?\n“Each of them could have gone either way. The genuine belief is that we are there, that we are ready.”\nBullingham said he and technical director John McDermott had interviewed “approximately 10” candidates for the job, including some from England, but ultimately opted to appoint just the third overseas coach of the men’s team.\nBullingham insisted the English coaching development system was a “success” but admitted the country was “not quite in that place” where it had a handful of realistic homegrown contenders for the national team job.",
