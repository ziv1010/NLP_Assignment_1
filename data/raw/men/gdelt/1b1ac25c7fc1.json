Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nDiscussing his team-mate’s strengths, Tielemans told TNT Sports: ‘Duran has everything.\n‘He has technique, he can hold the ball and can flick on. He is an all round striker.’\nDuran let his emotions get the better of him when he was replaced by Ollie Watkins immediately after scoring, kicking a seat in the dugout after being taken off by Emery.\n‘He is really funny,’ Tielemans said when asked about Duran’s reaction. ‘The manager does not care. He knows everyone wants to play. It is part of the game.’\nAston Villa boss Emery also played down Duran’s reaction and praised his team for playing ‘serious’ and effective football.\n‘We are playing seriously, we are playing focused, responsible and the team is progressing and mature in everything,’ he said.\n‘We tried to break the press man to man. We conceded some things in the first 15 minutes but then reacted very well.\n‘It is always difficult at home in Europe. We have had to try and be consistent in our gameplan for 90 minutes and I think we did that today.’\nVilla finished fourth in the Premier League last season to qualify for the Champions League and are in the same position after eight games of the 2024-25 campaign.\n‘It is amazing,’ McGinn said of Villa’s start to the Champions League. ‘Three games in, three wins and most important for us is no goals conceded.\n‘We don’t want to stop here. It puts us in a great position. Some players came back and now we look really strong.\n‘What we are building here is amazing. This is home for me. It is my seventh season here, we’ve had ups and downs. It has been a rollercoaster. Hopefully we can keep climbing.’\nEx-Arsenal and England defender Martin Keown was among those to pay tribute to Emery after Aston Villa celebrated another Champions League victory.\nEmery had a spell in the Premier League with Arsenal before Villa but struggled at the Emirates Stadium before being sacked in November 2019.\n‘Quietly Unai Emery is taking this club Aston Villa back to the big time,’ Keown said.\n‘It has been 40 or so years since they won the Champions League, but it feels like something is happening again. It is all coming back again.\n‘There is something special about this club and this stadium and now they have a special manager who is putting something special together.\n‘They were fourth from bottom [in the Premier League] when he arrived. It is incredible what he is doing right now.’\nRio Ferdinand, the former Manchester United defender, added: ‘What Unai Emery has done at Aston Villa is nothing short of a miracle.\nMore Trending\n‘Before he came in they looked lost, but he has instilled a confidence and belief in the club.\n‘You can feel it when you come here to the stadium, there is a genuine confidence that they can welcome any team here and beat them.\n‘On their day they can beat anybody, because they have players that can hurt people. They have a great style of play, a great structure and the players all know what they are doing.’\nAston Villa will look to continue their impressive run of form on Saturday when they face Bournemouth, who ended Arsenal’s unbeaten start to the season last time out.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Thierry Henry reveals pick for Ballon d’Or: ‘People forget about midfielders!’\nMORE: Mikel Arteta ‘worried’ over Riccardo Calafiori injury vs Shakhtar Donetsk",
