Both competitions are run by European soccer's governing body, UEFA.\nFIFA approved the prize money for the World Cup at a meeting of its council in Doha.\nIn March, it projected revenue for its current four-year cycle through 2026 at $US13 billion, up from $US7.5 billion for 2019-22.\nEach of the 48 national federations at the expanded 2026 World Cup will receive $US1.5 million for preparation costs and $US9 million for participating in the group stage, the same as for the 2022 tournament.\nTeams advancing to the new round of 32 get $US11 million, and those reaching the round of 16 receive $US15 million.\nNations reaching the quarterfinals are paid $US19 million, the fourth-place team $US27 million, the third-place team $US29 million and the final loser $US33 million.\nIncluding participation fees, FIFA will distribute $US727 million to the 48 federations.\nEach federation decides what to pay its players. The French sports daily L'Equipe reported France players were in line for a bonus of $US586,000 by their federation if they won the trophy in 2022. France was ultimately beaten by Argentina in the final.\nThe US Soccer Federation's 2022 collective bargaining agreements with the unions for its men's and women's national teams call for prize money for men in 2026 and women in 2027 to be pooled together, and 80 per cent of the money to be distributed among the players.\nAP",
