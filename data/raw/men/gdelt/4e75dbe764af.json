  "body_text": "It was another weekend for Chelsea to forget after they lost at Wolverhampton Wanderers to stay 11th in the table, with Frank Lampard’s tenure as interim manager getting off to a disappointing start.\nThe west London side are without a victory in four Premier League games and focus now turns to their Champions League quarter-final first leg versus Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\nAdvertisement\nThat competition presents Chelsea’s last shot at silverware in an otherwise dismal campaign and, whatever happens in Europe, it is guaranteed to be a summer of further change at Stamford Bridge.\nLampard is expected to be replaced in the dugout by a permanent head coach, more signings will arrive, players are sure to go the other way and a number of contract situations must be resolved.\nOne such situation was set to involve Ben Chilwell, who is approaching the final 24 months of his terms. Not only does the new Chelsea hierarchy want to avoid any squad member entering that territory but reports have suggested Manchester City are keen to recruit the England international.\nChilwell has established himself among Chelsea’s most important players — arguably their leading performer this season — and the possibility of his departure would be unpalatable for many fans.\nThose supporters will be delighted to learn, therefore, that Chilwell is set to commit his future to the club by signing a new four-year deal. It will prolong the wing-back’s stay from 2025 until 2027.\nAmid a turbulent period at Chelsea, the extension of Chilwell’s deal at least offers some positive news — while also confirming the 26-year-old’s standing in the eyes of the American-led ownership group.\nChilwell arrived from Leicester City for £50million in 2020 and lifted the Champions League a year later. His form continued to improve until a serious knee injury required surgery at the end of 2021.\nA hamstring problem then put an end to Chilwell’s hopes of participating at the 2022 World Cup, but the left-footer returned in early February and has featured in each subsequent Chelsea match.\nHe won a first cap for his country since November 2021 against Ukraine in March and at present it looks as though he will rival Luke Shaw for a starting spot at Euro 2024, provided England qualify.\nArsenal’s Balogun puzzle\nArsenal continued their quest for the Premier League title in a pulsating 2-2 draw at Liverpool on Sunday, as Gabriel Jesus maintained his strong form post-injury with a third goal in two matches.\nThe striker’s return to prominence comes at a good time for Mikel Arteta’s men, with back-up forward Eddie Nketiah out due to an ankle problem and prospect Folarin Balogun out on loan.\nShortly before Arsenal kicked off at Anfield, Balogun scored a stoppage-time penalty to earn Reims a point at home to Brest — it was the 21-year-old’s 18th goal in 29 Ligue 1 appearances.\nWhen his spell in France finishes this summer, Arsenal face a significant call.\nAdvertisement\nBalogun wants to continue operating as a first-choice striker and would like nothing more than to do so with Arsenal, whom he joined at the age of eight. But given the seniority and contractual lengths of Jesus and Nketiah (both until 2027), he is unlikely to earn regular first-team footballer in north London next season.\nHe is also opposed to the idea of a third temporary switch, having moved to Middlesbrough for the second half of 2021-22 before embarking on a successful full campaign with Reims.\nBalogun is nearing the last two years of the deal he signed in 2021 and does not plan to extend those terms, which is no reflection of his feelings towards Arsenal but rather the situation.\nIt is a stance influenced by the fact that major European sides — including AC Milan, Inter Milan, Marseille, Monaco and RB Leipzig — are in pursuit and they can offer a starting berth.\nBalogun is known to be attracted by such opportunities as he ponders the next step in his career, with the chance to test himself in a new environment on a permanent basis said to carry appeal.\nIt means Arsenal must decide whether to sanction a sale or allow Balogun, who has represented England and the United States’ youth sides, to enter his final 24 months at the Emirates Stadium.\nClubs lobbying Premier League to block nation-state linked takeovers\nA group of Premier League clubs are lobbying to block takeovers closely linked to nation-states, reports Dan Sheldon.\nAlthough the subject is not yet being discussed at shareholder meetings, a sentiment is building among senior figures from a number of top-flight sides — with Arsenal executive vice-chair Tim Lewis a strong voice in the conversations.\nThere are growing concerns over the impact of perceived state ownership on the competitive balance of the league and European football.\nAdvertisement\nBut some owners and executives acknowledge that, given recent developments, it will be tough to prevent. Furthermore, if clubs wish to sell in future then buyers with ties to sovereign wealth would often represent the most lucrative option.\nA working group — comprising 10 clubs and representatives from the Premier League — is looking at rules around ownership and a desire also exists in certain quarters for even stronger controls over related-party sponsorship deals.\nSheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani, the chairman of Qatari bank QIB and son of the former prime minister, is attempting to buy Manchester United.\nThose close to the Qatari royal’s bid point out that he is funding the proposed acquisition as a private individual via his Nine Two Foundation.\nManchester City have enjoyed huge success — winning six Premier League titles — since being taken over by Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008.\nNewcastle United were purchased by a Saudi-backed group led by British businesswoman Amanda Staveley in 2021, with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) owning 80 per cent.\nThe Premier League said it had received “legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United”.\nHowever, a court case regarding LIV Golf on behalf of PIF in the United States has cast doubt on those assurances. The documents filed in a California court described PIF as a “sovereign instrumentality of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia” and Newcastle chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan “a sitting minister of the Saudi government”.\nThe Athletic revealed last week that the British government considered the failure of any Saudi-backed takeover to be an “immediate risk” to the UK’s relationship with the Gulf kingdom.\nNothing has yet been formally proposed within Premier League circles, but the dialogue continues and the topic is not going away.\nAdvertisement\nPL set to announce six-team pre-season US tournament\nThe Premier League is expected to announce a pre-season tournament — which will involve six clubs and take place in the United States — later this week, reports Jay Harris.\nThis column revealed in September 2021 that executives at top-flight clubs were exploring options to host “meaningful” matches overseas to help fuel the growth of the competition, although they would not be regular-season fixtures. Their inspiration comes from the success of the NFL and NBA hosting games abroad in London and Paris respectively.\nIt was initially proposed that an “enhanced pre-season tournament” could take place in the US during the summer of 2022 but issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic prevented it from happening.\nLast October we reported the competition was still on the agenda and it is now going ahead this summer with Aston Villa, Brentford, Brighton and Hove Albion, Chelsea and Newcastle United all taking part. Leeds United are also expected to be included but it will depend on their standing in the Premier League when the decision is finalised.\nThe “Summer Series” will see clubs compete against each other in a number of matches which are due to be held in cities and stadiums in the US’s eastern time zone towards the end of July.\nIt will be a huge opportunity for all six teams involved to expand their fanbase and boost their commercial appeal.\nBrighton recruitment chief departs\nBrighton & Hove Albion head coach Roberto De Zerbi created headlines for the wrong reasons on Saturday following his red card during a controversial and ill-tempered loss at Tottenham Hotspur.\nBut it takes nothing away from the progress Brighton have enjoyed since the Italian was hired in September, with the club seventh in the top flight and vying for European qualification.\nAdvertisement\nTheir rise has been underpinned by fine work in the transfer market and when De Zerbi joined he attempted to further strengthen Brighton’s operation by bringing his own specialist for this area.\nSalvatore Monaco moved to the Amex Stadium shortly after his countryman. He was named assistant to then head of recruitment Paul Winstanley and technical director David Weir said the 50-year-old would be an “excellent addition to the team, as we look forward to January and beyond”.\nHowever, no sooner had Monaco arrived than it became clear he was not particularly suited to the role. Despite occupying an important position alongside De Zerbi at both Sassuolo and Shakhtar Donetsk prior, Monaco’s skill set and style proved to be less effective in Brighton’s unique set-up.\nAs a result, it can be revealed that Monaco actually left Brighton once the winter market closed.\nThe decision was made between all parties and approved by De Zerbi. There is no indication at present of a replacement being sought, given the individuals already in situ are deemed sufficient.\nDe Zerbi understandably took time to familiarise himself with Brighton’s model but is now said to have integrated well as the summer window nears. Winstanley switched to Chelsea in November and was succeeded by deputy Sam Jewell, at first temporarily but later on a permanent basis.\nJewell was appointed seven years ago so is versed in their ways and — via his father Paul — has experience of the managerial world. That has helped him forge a strong relationship with De Zerbi.\nUnited’s revolving sets at Carrington\nWhen the bidders for Manchester United were shown round Carrington last month, they were taken into the Jimmy Murphy Building which had been fitted with a temporary facade to highlight various aspects about the club.\nThe set contained financial and sporting information about United, and was designed to give those on the tour a better understanding of the asset. Meetings were also held in the main room of the building, which is named after the man who had huge influence on United and its academy under Sir Matt Busby.\nAdvertisement\nRaine, the bank handling the prospective sale on behalf of the Glazers, opened up United to Sheikh Jassim’s team and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, as well as minority investors, including Elliott Group, to persuade them of the growth possible on the pitch and in the balance sheets, with a view to gaining raised offers.\nPresentations were made by staff including football director John Murtough, chief operating officer Collette Roche, and chief financial officer Cliff Baty.\nIntriguingly, the set has now stayed up for more than three weeks, and some have theorised that is so further talks can be held there in case more bidders come forward. In the meantime, Erik ten Hag has been conducting his press conferences in the main building. Usually, he does so in the Jimmy Murphy Building.\nIt is expected Ten Hag will be back speaking to media in his customary seat across at the training ground shortly, with sufficient time elapsed for additional parties to announce any interest.\nThere is more fundamental work being done at Carrington, however, with diggers breaking ground outside the academy building as United start to construct a new annex for youth players and the women’s team.\nLaurie Whitwell\nSalisu left out of Saints squad due to commitment\nMohammed Salisu has been left out of recent Southampton squads due to doubts over his commitment.\nThe defender has been unavailable for the recent two defeats against West Ham United and Manchester City due to an unspecified injury that occurred during the international break. Salisu, though, returned to training the following week.\nThe 23-year-old will be entering the final 12 months of his contract in the summer after Southampton first opened talks about a new deal over a year ago. Salisu, however, preferred to only entertain discussions at the end of the season before deciding to commit to a new contract — which looks increasingly unlikely — or push to leave.\nAdvertisement\nComplications with those who represent the central defender initially delayed Southampton’s negotiation process, with his previous agency, JM 10, being acquired by CAA Base which has continued to cause difficulties this season.\nAs The Athletic has previously reported, with Southampton rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table, the threat of relegation is being factored into contract negotiations for other key players, who would prefer to assess the lay of the land at the end of the season.\nJacob Tanswell\nForest’s Adidas deal\nThe threat of relegation has not stopped Nottingham Forest from negotiating a lucrative sponsorship deal for Adidas to supply their kits next season – and return to the look from their glory years under Brian Clough.\nForest, who slipped into the Premier League’s bottom three with a 2-0 defeat at Aston Villa on Saturday, have spent the last five years with Macron and had an agreement to remain with the Italian manufacturer until 2025.\nHowever, the club are preparing to switch kit suppliers, with an early release from the Macron deal, after negotiating what is understood to be the biggest sponsorship agreement in their history.\nClough’s teams wore the three stripes of Adidas when they won back-to-back European Cups in 1979 and 1980 and the new arrangement is likely to start with a home kit that is reminiscent of their most celebrated era.\nDaniel Taylor",
