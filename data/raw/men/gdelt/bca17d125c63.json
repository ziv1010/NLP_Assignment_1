Marinos 1-0 in the semifinals of the top Asian club football tournament Wednesday.\nMidfielder Lee Dong-gyeong's 19th-minute goal stood as the winner in the opening leg of the semifinals at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Champions League at Munsu Football Stadium in Ulsan, some 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul.\nThe return leg is 7 p.m. next Wednesday in Yokohama.\nBy earning the narrow win, Ulsan also secured a spot in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. In the revamped tournament, the AFC will have four representatives. Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia and Urawa Red Diamonds of Japan have earned their tickets as the two most recent winners of the AFC Champions League. Ulsan grabbed theirs based on the AFC club rankings, based on teams' performances at the AFC Champions League during the 2021-24 period.\nIn this year's final, the winner of the Ulsan-Yokohama semifinals will face the winner of the West Asian semifinals between Al Ain FC of the United Arab Emirates and Al Hilal.\nLee, named the K League 1's Player of the Month for March earlier Wednesday, proved his worth against Yokohama.\nForward Joo Min-kyu received a cross inside the box with his back to the net and then teed up the ball for Lee for a left-footed shot that beat goalkeeper William Popp.\nJoo tried to join the party five minutes after the restart, but Popp made a desperate save on Joo's midrange strike.\nJoo struck the left post with a right-footed shot in the 67th minute, and Lee's left-footed attempt suffered the same fate two minutes later.\nYokohama could not solve Jo Hyeon-woo in Ulsan's goal. They had 18 shot attempts, 11 more than Ulsan, and put five on target, compared with three by Ulsan.\njeeho@yna.co.kr\n(END)\n-\nPark Jeong-min explores new territory as romantic lead in action-thriller 'Humint'\n-\nG-Dragon confirms BIGBANG's official comeback this year\n-\n'Singles' Inferno' producer explains record-breaking Netflix renewal\n-\nCheong Wa Dae hopes for N.
