  "body_text": "Greater Manchester Police 'has been fixed by our very own Carlo Ancelotti'\nChief Constable Stephen Watson has been compared to the legendary Italian football manager as a new watchdog report marks the continued improvement of a force branded 'failing' three years ago\nEven to its many critics, the turnaround of Greater Manchester Police has been remarkable since the dark days of December 2020 when years of shocking failure ended in the sacking of the then chief constable Ian Hopkins.\nBack then, a new £27m computer system was in meltdown; the force wasn't arresting nearly enough people; and victims of burglary were routinely told not expect a visit from an actual cop and to make do with a crime reference number. Criminals were having a field day, not that the crime figures showed that because neither the failing computer system nor police officers were recording them properly.\nThe last straw came when a report by the police watchdog published in December 2020 revealed 80,000 crimes hadn't been recorded properly, and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham showed Hopkins the door. The performance revealed in the police inspectorate report reflected well on neither man, but particular the ousted Hopkins.\nREAD MORE: Police investigating after 'crack and heroin zone' signs appear in Manchester\nREAD MORE: Amber health alert update as temperatures plummet and warning expanded across England\nFast forward three years and GMP is no longer in special measures and the latest report of His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) published on Friday showed a dramatic improvement under the stewardship of Hopkins' successor, Stephen Watson.\nHe has replaced virtually all the senior cops in the force and scrapped as 'complete tosh' his predecessor's 'Citizens' Charter', which emphasised the cuts facing police and urged people to think carefully before contacting GMP, as part of his 'back to basics' plan.\nAmid a blizzard of official figures, the headline was that GMP had made 'significant improvements', according to the latest report, with three areas of concern deemed 'inadequate' in the 2020 report now deemed 'adequate'. Two areas were deemed 'good', one of them disrupting organised crime and the other 'leadership and management'.\nThe one blot on the landscape was the way the force manages suspects which 'requires improvement' because of a backlog in visits to registered sex offenders amounting 1,490 individuals. But even here the inspectorate said the force had 'responded very quickly' and GMP says that number is now in the dozens.\nAt a press conference on Friday, the chief constable and Mr Burnham trumpeted the many improvements since the former was installed as the new boss of GMP in 2021: vehicle crime is down 6 per cent; 'neighbourhood crime' is down 4pc; burglary is down 19pc; and the number of suspected burglars arrested was up to 204 this year compared to 118 in 2020.\nIt helps that the force now has 8,128 police officers, which is up from 6,396 in 2017 and back to the numbers seen before the austerity cuts of 2010.\n\"Obviously this represents huge progress, but there's further to go,\" Mr Burnham told reporters, adding that the 'most pleasing aspect for me' was the 'good' grading for the new leadership of the force. \"This is a different police force than the police force we had in 2020 and the Greater Manchester public need to know that,\" said the mayor, going on that rank-and-file cops can now have 'pride in [their] uniform and badge'.\nIn an interview with the Manchester Evening News, Mr Burnham, when it was suggested the report was as much a comment on the old regime as the new one, said: \"We had to make a change. We had concerns. I had concerns when I came in as mayor. We also had to work through these issues. We knew in 2020, we were clear the leadership of the force had to change and critically important was finding the right leadership. I knew I had to find the right leader for GMP. We keep using a football analogy in this. It's clear I had to find the right manager.\"\nPressed on whether Mr Watson was the policing equivalent of Sam Allardyce - the former Bolton and England manager with a reputation for helping struggling teams avoid relegation - the mayor laughed and said 'god, no', although he was quick to add that he liked and respected Allardyce.\nHe volunteered another even more famous football manager, Carlo Ancelotti, who has managed the mayor's beloved Everton and is now in charge of Real Madrid. He's won the Champions League four times as manager, twice with Madrid and twice with AC Milan. He was 'the best of the best', said Mr Burnham.\n\"The most important thing for M.E.N. readers is they can have complete confidence their police force is well-led and maintaining improvements right across the board,\" he said.\nAsked if the force was now 'fixed', he said: \"It is fixed. I'm going to give a very clear answer on that. The turnaround is clear. It's only heading in one direction.... I will predict things will only get better from here.\"\nMr Watson was less emphatic when quizzed by the M.E.N, saying he was 'not a person to say everything is fully fixed'. He added: \"There's always somebody out there who has an experience which is not what they or we would wish for as a victim of crime. We can never be complacent and I wouldn't want to stand here and say 'this is job done'.\n\"It's a work in progress but that progress is swift, sure and impressive.\"\nHe pointed particularly to Operation Vulcan, which has been tackling the notorious counterfeit trade around Cheetham Hill and Strangeways. \"It's probably been 30 years in the making and we've sorted it out in 12 months. It just shows what you can do if you turn your mind to it,\" he said.\nMore of a rugby than a football fan, he admitted he had no idea who Carlo Ancellotti was. \"If you are telling me he's a good manager, I suppose I want to be a good manager too.\"\nHe said GMP was 'mid tab table' but with ambitions 'to be at the top' with hopes for ratings in all areas either 'good' or 'outstanding' in subsequent inspection reports\nThe latest inspection assessed eight predefined areas of policing - namely preventing crime; leadership and force management, investigating crime; police powers and public treatment; responding to the public; protecting vulnerable people; developing a positive workplace and managing offenders, resulting in graded judgements in those areas.\nThe force was judged as 'good' in the areas of preventing crime and in leadership and force management, but as 'requires improvement' in terms of managing offenders. A judgement of 'adequate' was given in the remaining five areas.\nIn 2021, HMICFRS rated GMP as 'inadequate' in three areas - those of responding to the public; investigating crime and building, supporting and protecting the workforce. Five other areas were classed as 'requires improvement' - including managing offenders and suspects, indicating there has been no improvement in the force in that category since the last inspection.\nMichelle Skeer, His Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary, said GMP's leadership and overall management was 'good' - with 'visible and effective' leaders.\nShe said: \"I am pleased with some aspects of Greater Manchester Police's performance in keeping people safe, reducing crime and providing victims with an effective service. The force has made significant improvements since we last inspected in 2021, but it recognises that there is still work to do.\n\"Our last inspection identified the chief constable's positive changes and long-term plans. I am pleased that those plans have continued to help the force improve the service it provides to the public. Its leadership, governance and performance processes have increased both the productivity and proactivity of its officers. While there are still areas in which Greater Manchester Police needs to do better, I am optimistic that the force's leadership and management will continue to provide further improvements.\"\nMs Skeer said GMP has a higher level of recorded incidents per 100,000 of the population compared with the England and Wales average - and receives a higher number of emergency 999 calls. But she said: \"The force answers most of those calls quickly, and it also assesses the level of risk appropriately.\n\"Since our last inspection in 2021, the force has continued to improve the policing service it provides to the communities of Greater Manchester. Because of this, it has made progress in most areas of improvement from our last inspection and achieved improved judgment grades. But the force recognises that there is still work to do, and I have identified areas in which it needs to improve.\"",
