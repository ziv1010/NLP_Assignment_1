  "body_text": "Manchester United are reportedly set to pull out of respective January deals for OGC Nice’s Jean-Clair Todibo and Sporting Lisbon’s Goncalo Inacio.\nUnited are on the hunt for defensive reinforcements and it’s easy to see why this is the case.\nThis season, Erik ten Hag has been forced to contend with multiple injuries to key players in the backline. Raphael Varane has been in and out of the team with different physical setbacks.\nLisandro Martinez who is currently recovering, may have played his last game of 2023 and is expected to return to action at the turn of the year.\nTen Hag’s problems have been compounded by the absences of Luke Shaw, Tyrell Malacia and Aaron Wan-Bissaka.\nTottenham Hotspur loanee Sergio Reguilon has also been sidelined but is expected to be available for selection when United host FC Copenhagen later this evening in the Champions League.\nA recent report covered by The Peoples Person indicated that Liverpool were trying to step up efforts to sign Inacio amidst interest from United.\nWith regards to Todibo, the Frenchman was a top target for the Red Devils all summer, but a move never materialized.\nHis arrival at Old Trafford was entirely contingent on Harry Maguire’s departure and when the Englishman’s proposed move to West Ham fell through, it became increasingly clear Todibo would not be added to Ten Hag’s ranks.\nIt was thought that United still retained an interest in the OGC Nice star but according to Football Insider, both he and Inacio are poised to become a non-issue for the 20-time English champions, at least during the winter transfer window.\n“Man United have abandoned huge-money deals for centre-backs Goncalo Inacio and Jean-Clair Todibo ahead of the January transfer window, sources have told Football Insider.”\n“It is believed the Red Devils have limited resources and are therefore unable to splash out in the mid-season window, meaning those deals now face a collapse.”\n“A well-placed source has told Football Insider that Man United could now turn their attention to signing low-cost alternatives to their top targets – the likes of Todibo, Inacio and Guehi.”",
