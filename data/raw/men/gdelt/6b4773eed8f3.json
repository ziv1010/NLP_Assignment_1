  "body_text": "“Proper rival wanted for a worthy derby,” said a banner held up by Real Madrid fans before Atletico Madrid played at Real’s Bernabeu stadium in November 2011.\nThat came as Atletico were going over 13 years and 25 matches without any ‘derbi’ win over their richer and historically more powerful rivals from across Spain’s capital city.\nAdvertisement\nThe visitors went 1-0 up that day, but their goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was soon sent off, and Madrid’s 4-1 victory made it more than 5,000 minutes of derbi action filled with resounding disappointments for one side and predictably amusing victories for the other.\nThat narrative changed with the 2013 Copa del Rey final, held at the Bernabeu, when Diego Simeone’s side shocked their hosts 2-1 in extra time. Victory was made even sweeter for Atletico fans when their captain Gabi received the Copa trophy from Spain’s King Juan Carlos — a Los Blancos supporter.\nSince then, the record has been much more even. Including ties in the Supercopa de Espana and UEFA Super Cup, there have been 41 derbis — 15 Madrid wins, 15 draws and 11 victories for Atletico.\nIt has been particularly tight recently — the last three meetings have all been hard-fought 1-1 draws, including the most recent: a La Liga match at the Bernabeu in early February 2025.\nAs the on-field power relationship has balanced out, the rivalry off the pitch has become more tense and controversial.\nThe previous attitude of condescending superiority from Los Blancos fans — and sometimes players, coaches and directors — has hardened into an obligation to keep their neighbours down in their perceived place.\nMeanwhile, a new sense of self-confidence from the Atletico side has been soured by some disgraceful and even criminal acts by some of its more radical ultras supporters (acts which are generally condemned by most on the Atletico side).\nAll of which has generated a mood of building tension and tremendous expectation in the Spanish capital before Tuesday’s Champions League last-16 first leg at the Bernabeu, and the return game across town at Atletico’s Metropolitano ground on Wednesday March 12.\nThis is the story of the Madrid derby and what it means to both sides.\nAdvertisement\nThe first La Liga clash between the teams in 1929 was won by Real Madrid, with both goals scored by former Atletico forward Monchin Triana. But the idea of the derbi as a meeting of the city’s aristocratic elite against its more hard-scrabble outsiders took decades to solidify.\nReal became the dominant force in the Spanish capital mid-century, when president Santiago Bernabeu built a team packed with galacticos including Alfredo Di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas, winning five successive European Cups from 1956 until 1960.\nAs the area around the Bernabeu to the north of the city grew increasingly affluent, and the team became a dominant force domestically, the stadium’s VIP ‘balcony’ became a meeting place for Spain’s business, social and political leaders.\nMeanwhile, Atletico fans were often drawn from working-class areas, including near their old Estadio Vicente Calderon to the south of Madrid’s city centre. An outsider ethos was cultivated especially in the 1980s and 1990s during the controversial presidency of Jesus Gil y Gil — a self-made businessman who entered politics and later spent time in prison.\nAlthough the two clubs were now often operating on different levels, financially and talent-wise, the city was still split pretty evenly between fans of both sides. So the derbi was often more important locally than El Clasico between Madrid and Barcelona.\n“In my time, the rival was Atletico,” Di Stefano later recalled. “Barcelona was further away, games against them lasted 90 minutes. Derbis against Atletico lasted a whole week. You wanted to beat them at all costs. If not, the following day in the office, the bar, on the street, their fans would be laughing at us.”\nUnder current president Florentino Perez, Madrid have made further leaps forward since 2000 — signing global stars like Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo Nazario and David Beckham in his first term, and more recently Cristiano Ronaldo, Jude Bellingham and Kylian Mbappe. It now claims around 500 million supporters worldwide and has an annual turnover of more than €1billion (£830m, $1.04bn).\n“We’re like a big blockbuster movie,” Madrid director Jose Angel Sanchez has said. “Like Men in Black — or, in our case, Men in White. We’ve a great story to tell, a great production and the biggest box-office stars.”\nAdvertisement\nDuring the 2000s, Atletico spent some time in Spain’s second division and built up debts of €500m. Yet, the derbi offered a chance — at least twice a year when in the same division — to get one over the richer neighbours.\n“The first thing all Atleticos did was look at the calendar to see when we played them,” club legend Adelardo Rodriguez said. “There were people who preferred to beat Madrid, even over winning a trophy.”\nEven after Simeone’s team ended their long run without a derbi win, many Atleticos continued to see their underdog status as a strength.\n“These are difficult times, and people identify with us, as we are fighting against many adversities,” midfielder Tiago Mendes said in 2014. “We’re like Robin Hood.”\nProgress during Simeone’s 15 years as coach has seen the club move quite far from their hard-up history, helped by a 2017 move to the shiny new Metropolitano stadium. Spain’s current King Felipe VI and city mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida are both Atletico fans. Yet, the financial division remains stark — the club’s income last season was €459m, less than half that of their rivals.\nMeanwhile, the Madrid derbi has become a regular fixture on the continental stage — with both teams regularly making it to the closing stages of the Champions League.\nSimeone’s Atletico were seconds from winning the 2014 final in Lisbon until Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos headed a 93rd-minute equaliser, and Madrid then overran their demoralised opponents to win 4-1 in extra time.\nTwo years later in Milan, Atletico came even closer to winning what would have been a first ever Champions League. When the game against Madrid finished 1-1 after extra time, the decisive penalty in the shoot-out was missed by Atleti right-back Juanfran, who had been on Madrid’s books as a teenager.\nAdvertisement\nMadrid also edged derbi clashes in the Champions League knockout rounds in 2014-15 and 2016-17. That confirmed for many around the Bernabeu a feeling that their innate natural superiority would always prevail on the biggest stages. But coming so close also left burning, unrealised dreams which still drive Simeone and his men onwards.\nAll this has not stopped players from representing both clubs over the years. Former president Bernabeu himself played for Atletico in 1920-21 during a row with the Madrid hierarchy of the time.\nOthers to have worn the two shirts include Mexico’s Hugo Sanchez, Argentina’s Santiago Solari and Spain’s Alvaro Morata.\nCurrent Atletico player Marcos Llorente came through the Bernabeu youth system, won the 2017-18 Champions League with Madrid, then moved across the city and won the 2020-21 La Liga title with Atletico. Llorente’s father Paco played for Atletico and Real, in the 1980s, and his father Ramon Grosso represented both in the 1960s. Llorente’s great-uncle was Paco Gento — who won six European Cups for Madrid in the 1950s and 1960s.\nTensions between the two clubs have increased in recent years. Atletico’s boost in status to become a real rival in domestic and European competition is one reason. Another is Madrid regularly tempting youngsters from Atletico’s academy into their set-up. The intense focus on both teams in a city where football is by far the No 1 sport makes the rivalry hard to escape for all involved.\nNot every crossing of the divide is without rancour. Now-Madrid goalkeeper Courtois was bought by Chelsea in 2011 but loaned to Atletico until 2014, then spent four years at Stamford Bridge before joining Los Blancos. Atletico fans have interpreted various comments from Courtois since then as showing a lack of respect to his former team. Anger boiled over when objects thrown at the keeper from the Metropolitano stands during last October’s derbi saw the game suspended for 20 minutes.\nEven more serious has been the abuse suffered by star Madrid forward Vinicius Junior. Racist chants were directed towards the Brazil international before, during and after a September 2022 game at the Metropolitano. The following January, a mannequin dressed to resemble Vinicius Jr was hung from a bridge near Real’s Valdebebas training ground. Atletico club figures have condemned the racist abuse, but not always in the strongest possible terms.\nAdvertisement\nRecent weeks had seen the issue of fairness in refereeing become a public debate between Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti and his Atletico counterpart Simeone, amid claims from the Bernabeu that Spanish officials are biased against their side.\nSimeone has scoffed at this idea (as many Atletico supporters do) — saying there were “100 years of decisions” going Madrid’s way at the Bernabeu. Ancelotti responded by saying “maybe there are some thorns which still hurt” — an apparent reference to Atletico’s Champions League final defeats in 2014 and 2016.\nBoth sides then had very different views of the incident when Atletico were awarded a controversial penalty in last month’s La Liga derbi — and the debate has simmered since.\nFans will be preparing ‘tifo’ banners to show this Tuesday at the Bernabeu, and the following Wednesday at the Metropolitano, with a shared history and mutual animosity providing plenty of ammunition on both sides.\nWhatever happens in this latest chapter of Spanish football’s oldest rivalry, the debates and tensions are sure to keep simmering on into the future.\n(Illustration: Dan Goldfarb/The Athletic; Photos: Ian MacNicol, Giuseppe CACACE/AFP, Jose Breton/Pics Action/NurPhoto, Jasper Juinen, Angel Martinez, Denis Doyle, Harry Langer/DeFodi Images/Getty Images)",
