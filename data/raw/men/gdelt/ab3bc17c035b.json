She also featured at the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup, including in the 3-1 victory over Costa Rica.\n2020\nHILDAH MAGAIA (SOUTH AFRICA)\nMagaia scored four goals at the 2020 COSAFA Women’s Championship as South Africa claimed a fourth title in succession, while also being central to much of the hosts’ attacking play.\nShe led the forward line superbly and proved a handful for all defences, creating opportunities for others with her intelligence and skill.\nThat performance earned her a move to Mallbackens IF in Sweden, where she excelled with 12 goals in 19 starts in her first season.\nShe later played for Sejong Sportstoto in South Korea before moving to the National Women’s Soccer League in the United States, where she turns out for Kansas City Current.\nShe has since had spells in Mexico and recently moved to Spain to play for Deportivo de La Coruña.\nHer two goals in the final of the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations secured the title for South Africa as they defeated Morocco, underlining her qualities as a clinical finisher.\nShe also scored against Sweden and Italy at the FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand and remains a key part of the national team.\n2021\nAMINA BILALI (TANZANIA)\nBilali was a talismanic figure for Tanzania as they claimed the COSAFA Women’s Championship crown in 2021, playing a key role in their run to the title.\nShe has continued to be a leading figure for the team and has captained the side.\nShe was a standout performer for Yanga Princesses, where she was named Women’s Premier League Player of the Year in 2021, before later joining JKT Queens.\nShe featured for JKT Queens at the CAF Women’s Champions League in Côte d’Ivoire in 2023.\n2022\nBARBRA BANDA (ZAMBIA)\nIt was difficult to look past forward Banda for Player of the Tournament in 2022 after her 10 goals guided Zambia to their maiden title.\nShe is one of the best strikers in the world and, after netting two hat-tricks at the Olympic Games in Tokyo, scored a brace as the Copper Queens claimed their first FIFA Women’s World Cup victory with a 3-1 win over Costa Rica in Australia.\nShe continued that form at the Olympic Games in Paris, where she scored a hat-trick against Australia and netted again against Germany.\nBanda was also on target twice in one of Zambia’s most famous victories, a 3-2 win over Germany in a World Cup warm-up match in 2023.\nShe scored the winner against South Africa in the 2022 COSAFA Women’s Championship final and, at just 25 years of age, has many years ahead of her to further build her legend.\nShe played club football in Spain and China before moving to Orlando Pride in the United States in 2024.\n2023\nTEMWA CHAWINGA (MALAWI)\nMalawi stormed to their maiden COSAFA Women’s Championship title in 2023, driven by Chawinga’s nine goals, which earned her both the Golden Boot and Player of the Tournament awards.\nThe 26-year-old has enjoyed a meteoric rise in recent years after scoring 51 goals across all competitions for Chinese side Wuhan Jianghan, which earned her a move to Kansas City in the United States.\nShe set a new record for most goals in a single NWSL season with 20 and has emerged as one of the top forwards in that elite competition, and possibly the world.\nTemwa, whose older sister Tabitha has been a prolific scorer for Inter Milan, Paris Saint-Germain and now Lyon, began her career overseas with Kvarnsvedens IK in Sweden before moving to China in 2020.\nShe has been one of the standout performers from the Southern African region in recent years and, at the age of 27, may not yet have reached her peak.\n2024\nISABELLA LUDWIG (SOUTH AFRICA)\nLudwig helped South Africa reach the final of the 2024 edition, though they would lose on penalties to Zambia following a 0-0 draw in the decider.\nThe classy midfielder is both a creator and a scorer of goals, and while she has yet to fully cement her place in the Banyana Banyana side, it feels as though that moment is not far away.\nShe began her career at the University of Pretoria before moving to Mamelodi Sundowns, where she has flourished and become a key figure in the club’s recent success.\nAt just 23 years of age, she has a long career ahead of her, and it will be fascinating to see how she is utilised by the national team in the years to come.",
