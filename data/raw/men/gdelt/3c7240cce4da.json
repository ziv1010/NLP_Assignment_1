For PSG, it’s yet another European campaign that ends in failure, something that has become increasingly familiar.\nAs the dust settles on tonight’s game, The Athletic takes a look at five of PSG’s most notable Champions League exits before this one.\n2016-17, Last 16\nPSG 4-0 Barcelona | Barcelona 6-1 PSG\nThe most remarkable of Paris Saint-Germain’s Champions League disappointments came six years ago.\nA comprehensive first-leg win at home to Barcelona had them apparently cruising into the quarter-finals, despite having only progressed from their group as runners-up to Arsenal.\nVictory in this tie would have been revenge for an away-goals defeat to the same opponents in the last eight three years earlier and a hefty 5-1 aggregate defeat at that same stage in 2014-15 (see below). Angel Di Maria scored in each half at the Parc de Princes to help create a surely unassailable cushion to take to Camp Nou.\nBut then — somehow — came utter collapse, the infamous ‘La Remontada’ (the comeback).\nAt 3-0 down just past the hour mark, Edinson Cavani got what might have been a vital away goal, but Neymar scored a free kick in the 88th minute before converting a controversial penalty a minute into added time to pull the sides level on aggregate at 5-5.\nEven then PSG had the advantage, as the now-scrapped away goals rule was still in effect. But in the fifth minute of stoppage time, Neymar’s cross was turned home by Sergi Roberto to seal a 6-5 win in the most dramatic circumstances.\nGO DEEPER\nImage that captured most dramatic Champions League comeback\nThe French side later sent a letter of complaint to UEFA, European football’s governing body, documenting perceived errors by German referee Deniz Aytekin during that extraordinary second leg, then embarked on some major retail therapy that summer, signing Neymar from Barcelona for more than €220million — a transfer fee which remains a world record.\n2018-19, Last 16\nManchester United 0-2 PSG | PSG 1-3 Manchester United\nAfter the pain of throwing away such a clear lead two years earlier, the 2018-19 Champions League poured salt on those wounds as PSG served up another example of throwing away a strong first-leg advantage in the last 16.\nAdvertisement\nTwo goals in seven second-half minutes at Old Trafford, from centre-back Presnel Kimpembe and Kylian Mbappe, put PSG in relative control of the tie. A late Paul Pogba red card compounded United’s misery.\nBut a poor start to the home leg for the French side saw Romelu Lukaku first put United ahead with just two minutes played, and after Juan Bernat soon equalised, make it 2-1 after half an hour.\nThat was how it looked like remaining in a tight game, with PSG containing United but becoming frustrated at failing to add another goal of their own to extend a 3-2 aggregate lead. Then came the defining moment — in added time once again.\nA speculative effort from distance by Diego Dalot in the 94th minute struck Kimpembe on the arm in the PSG box. After a lengthy VAR intervention and Slovenian referee Damir Skomina consulting the pitch-side monitor, a penalty was awarded.\nMarcus Rashford stepped up confidently, and sent United through on away goals.\n2013-14, Quarter-final\nPSG 3-1 Chelsea | Chelsea 2-0 PSG\nAway goals had also been PSG’s undoing in the 2013-14 quarter-finals.\nThe story is a familiar one. Take a decent advantage from the first leg into the reverse fixture in enemy territory, only to go out in frustrating style.\nJavier Pastore’s goal in stoppage time had given PSG a 3-1 lead to take to Stamford Bridge, but Eden Hazard’s first-half penalty in the Parc des Princes would prove a vital lifeline for Chelsea.\nAs Laurent Blanc’s side made the short trip to London with that two-goal advantage, there was confidence given the strong performance at home. But a late goal was once again the cause of wild celebrations for a team facing PSG in the Champions League’s knockout phase…\nAndre Schurrle, who had replaced an injured Hazard just 18 minutes into the second leg, scored to reduce the deficit to one at half-time. Then Chelsea, buoyed by that early goal and the absence of PSG’s star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic through injury, took advantage in a dramatic finish, second-half substitute Demba Ba home from close range with three minutes of the 90 left to put Chelsea through on away goals.\n2021-22, Last 16\nPSG 1-0 Real Madrid | Real Madrid 3-1 PSG\nYet again, PSG collapsed in the Champions League’s first knockout round last season.\nA 1-0 victory in the first leg at home was a promising start, especially after Lionel Messi’s 62nd-minute penalty had been saved by Thibaut Courtois. The Belgian correctly guessed where the Argentinian was aiming, and turned his shot around the post for a corner. But in the last of four added minutes, Mbappe was released down the left by Neymar’s clever backheel and beat Courtois from a tight angle to give PSG a slender lead to take to Madrid.\nAdvertisement\nIf that was a boost then Mbappe’s 39th-minute opener at the Bernabeu put the French champions in control of the tie. But from having one foot in the quarter-finals with half an hour to play, Mauricio Pochettino’s side capitulated to crash out yet again.\nKarim Benzema, who was in the spell of form that would win him the 2022 Ballon d’Or, scored a hat-trick in the space of 17 minutes just after the hour to knock the Parisians out and keep Madrid on course for what would become their 14th European Cup final triumph.\n2014-15, Quarter-final\nPSG 1-3 Barcelona | Barcelona 2-0 PSG\nThis Champions League defeat wasn’t the result of PSG throwing away a lead or conceding a stoppage-time winner, they simply got outplayed in both legs. There was perhaps some consolation that they were beaten by the competition’s eventual winners, but a 5-1 aggregate defeat was short of what might have been expected.\nIn the French capital, Barcelona opened up a three-goal lead to put themselves in prime position to reach a seventh semi-final in eight seasons.\nNeymar and Luis Suarez blew PSG away, the former opening the scoring after 18 minutes, before Suarez added two more goals in 12 second-half minutes. With Ibrahimovic suspended, PSG struggled but Jeremy Mathieu’s own goal with eight minutes remaining gave them a bit of hope to take to Catalonia.\nHowever, Neymar was not in a mood to be generous to his future employers, scoring two first-half goals at Camp Nou to decisively take the tie away from PSG.\n(Top photo: Pedro Salado/Quality Sport Images/Getty Images)",
