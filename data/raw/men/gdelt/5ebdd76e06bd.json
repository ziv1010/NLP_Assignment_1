It takes a lot of persistence and consistency. It also takes a level of emotional endurance,” Sundowns head coach Rhulani Mokwena said in a tribute video by the club to mark Shalulile’s latest milestone.\n“His character, demeanour and persona has made it a lot easier for us to celebrate Peter. This is congratulations to him on reaching a 100 goals, and here’s to wishing him another 100 before his retirement.”\nSundowns chairman Thopie Motsepe said the club owes much of its recent success to Shalulile’s exploits and professionalism.\n“Peter’s more than just a goalscorer. Those goals have helped our club move forward and helped our team achieve many of the milestones we have had over the past three seasons that he’s been with us.\n“Players and coaches can really say this is a truly special person,” said Motsepe.\nShalulile’s immense work ethic and insatiable appetite for goals are key to his continued brilliance, says teammate Mothubi Mvala, who also shared a dressing room with ‘Sha-Sha’ at Highlands Park.\n“He wants to achieve more. He’s someone who is always hungry,” Mvala said.\nLegendary Sundowns striker Daniel ‘Mambush’ Mudau challeged Shalulile to usurp him as the club’s all-time leading marksman.\n“I call him a monster, because he wants to get the ball and put it in the back of the net. You can see the power he has and the technique. He doesn’t score beautiful goals, he’s just scoring goals.\n“And that’s why the supporters like him,” said Mudau, who has scored 155 goals for Sundowns.\n“He’s a nightmare to goalkeepers, including us, because what he does on the pitch on match day is what he does in training. He’s one guy who really likes to hit the back of the net,” said Sundowns’ hulking Ugandan keeper, Dennis Onyango.\nFellow Sundowns veteran goalminder Kennedy Mweene from Zambia said: “It’s the hard work. He puts goalkeepers under pressure. He’s got that thing that one out of 10 times, the goalkeeper will make a mistake and he capitalises.”\nFIRMLY GROUNDED\nShalulile was at his lethal best inside the Nelson Mandela Stadium on Saturday, and should have had a hat-trick late in the game, but watched in agony as his shot ricocheted off the root of the upright after he had rounded off the goalkeeper.\nThe Namibian international put the South African champions ahead five minutes into the match when he headed in unchallenged after Aubrey Modiba delivered a sweet cross following a deep corner kick from Teboho Mokoena.\nShalulile then helped make it 2-0, when he delivered across for Neo Maema to tap home a brilliant team goal.\nThe rampant Brave Warriors captain then scored his second goal five minutes after the break, smashing in a half volley from just inside the box, following a defensive mix-up.\nBelouizdad had pulled one back on the stroke of half-time, Melouid Rabaia heading in a corner to beat Ronwen Williams in goals for Sundowns.\nSubstitute Cassius Mailula made it 4-1 deep into injury time for a victory that is sure to see Sundowns progress to the semi-finals for only the second time since they won the Champions League in 2016.\nMokwena refused to be drawn in by the hype and kept his guard up, adopting a sense of calm given the unpredictable nature of the competition.\n“Feet firmly on the ground, this is only half-time,” he told the media.\n“No [we have not qualified], stranger things have happened in football. We have a lot of humility.\n“We beat a very good side, and we still have to face a very good side in Pretoria. They have a top coach, top players, and this is only halfway.”\nIn an age of information overload, Sunrise is The Namibian’s morning briefing, delivered at 6h00 from Monday to Friday.
