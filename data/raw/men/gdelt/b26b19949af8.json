Then following that up with a lively cameo when introduced in the 80th minute against Belgium.\nIt was no more than Anthony Gordon deserved.\nLast summer he was named player of the tournament after leading England to under 21s Euros glory.\nThen following that up with a stellar season with Newcastle United on a personal basis, having scored ten goals in all competitions and in the Premier League has been averaging far better than once every two games when it comes to direct goal involvements, having already scored ten and got eight assists in 29 PL starts (and one PL sub appearance).\nThe reality was though, at least in my opinion, that Anthony Gordon needed to make this March squad with England, to have any chance of getting on that plane to Germany in June. It would have been so cruel if he had missed this first England senior opportunity but it nearly did, when forced off with injury against Chelsea, less than 72 hours before Gareth Southgate named his squad.\nAnyway, now there is more positive news for Anthony Gordon (and other Newcastle United hopefuls), with now an update (see below) from Sky Sports, that a UEFA committee has now voted and given the green light to keep the allowed squad size for these Euros in Germany this summer at 26 players, as has been the case with the last two tournaments (Euros and World Cup) for England (and their rivals). The UEFA plan had been to reduce it to 23 players for these 2024 Euros but the likes of Gareth Southgate and (Holland’s) Ronald Koeman have been very vocal in saying it makes no sense to make this reduction.\nObviously having 26 spaces instead of 23 would significantly increase the chances of players on the outer edges of their national squads. Personally, I think Anthony Gordon must surely have done enough for club and country this season, to go to Germany, regardless of whether it was a 23 or 26 man squad.\nHowever, a 26 man squad would surely guarantee that for sure with Gordon. Kieran Trippier will also be on the plane regardless, whilst if Nick Pope proves his fitness, then it would be daft if Gareth Southgate doesn’t take him. Could others such as Callum Wilson make late challenges? Who knows. However, a few extra spaces in the squad won’t do any harm.\nI think in this day and age where for say Premier League games, we see squads of 20 every match, same for Champions League etc, I don’t see why UEFA could argue against 26 man squads for the Euros if that is what the managers want.\nEngland play Serbia in their first group match on Sunday 16 June and if going all the way, they would be in the final exactly four weeks later on Sunday 14 July, which would mean seven games in four weeks. With all the extra matches and demands that are being put on players these days, with both club and international football wanting them to play more and more games, I think common sense has prevailed at UEFA (for once!), in giving the green light for these 26 man squads to happen this summer.\nSky Sports report – 23 April 2024:\n‘Euro 2024: UEFA set to increase squad size to 26 players for tournament in Germany\nEngland and Scotland look set to be given the chance to select 26 players for this summer’s European Championships after a UEFA vote on Monday gave the green light for expanded squads.\nThe suggestion was first made during a meeting of all the nations’ coaches in Dusseldorf a fortnight ago, but at a meeting of the UEFA national competitions committee on Monday, Sky Sports News has learned that delegates voted in favour of changing the rules for Euro 2024 from a 23-player limit to 26.\nEnlarged squads were used in the last Euros in 2021 as a measure to help nations cope with the aftermath of the COVID pandemic.\nThis latest decision looks set to mean that 26-player squads will become the norm for all UEFA national competitions going forward.\nThe decision is not yet set in stone – the UEFA executive committee (EXCO) needs to sanction the rule change – but it is expected that will simply be a rubber-stamping exercise.\nThe EXCO will not meet in person until May 22, but it is usual practice for a decision like this to be ratified remotely. That could happen later this week\nThe news will be a welcome boost for Gareth Southgate and Steve Clarke, with both England and Scotland badly affected by injuries, with the start of the Euros now less than eight weeks away.’\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
