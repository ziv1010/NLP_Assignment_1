The Ecuadorian tweeted: “If I could turn back time I wouldn’t have made that bad tackle.”\nBuying clubs will no doubt be hoping to sign Southampton’s best performers for minimal fees after they were relegated – with Arsenal among those thought to be keeping an eye on versatile defender Tino Livramento and midfielder Romeo Lavia.\nThe Gunners will also be keen to add more creativity to their midfield, and could finally make a move for Youri Tielemans. The 26-year-old will be a free agent this summer when his current deal with Leicester City expires.\nA bid to balance the books means there will also be a number of players heading for the Emirates exit, including Folarin Balogun. The striker, whose decision to switch international allegiance from England to the US was approved by FIFA this week, has been in sensational form during his season-long loan spell with French side Reims, netting 19 goals in 34 league appearances. It’s been suggested that the Gunners would be willing to let Balogun leave for in the region of £35m.\nGranit Xhaka is also poised to leave Arsenal at the end of the season with speculation that Bayer Leverkusen are already in advanced talks to sign the midfielder for £13m.\nAsk Arteta where he would like to strengthen and he will, of course, tell you that his only concern is Arsenal’s final two games of the campaign – away to Nottingham Forest this Saturday, and then a home match against Wolves on the final day of the season.",
