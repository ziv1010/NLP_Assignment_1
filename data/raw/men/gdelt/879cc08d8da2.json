  "body_text": "Arsenal’s status as one of the biggest clubs in English football makes them a popular pick with people who enjoy playing computer games.\nThe Gunners’ massive worldwide fanbase regularly indulges their passion for the club through game franchises such as EA Sports FC and Football Manager.\nEven platforms such as BDMBet Casino use the club’s popularity in their sports gaming offerings, demonstrating the connection between football, video games and online entertainment.\nWith that in mind, read on as we briefly look at the club’s history in video games, before assessing how they are represented in the modern gaming landscape.\nArsenal’s history in video games\nThe first licensed editions of major franchises such as FIFA (now EA Sports FC) and Pro Evolution Soccer (PES) were launched in the mid-1990s.\nSports Interactive’s Championship Manager was also part of the landscape during that era, before transitioning into the Football Manager brand in 2004.\nArsenal have been licensed in each incarnation of the game, which has allowed fans to engage with the club through the medium of video gaming.\nElements such as the Emirates Stadium, managers, coaches, players, kits and tactics have been lovingly recreated to ensure Arsenal fans enjoy an immersive experience.\nArsenal have also been represented in professional gaming, with Fortnite Flick famously making their mark on the Rocket League eSports circuit.\nHowever, when it comes to Arsenal’s presence in video games, two titles stand head and shoulders above the rest – EA Sports FC and Football Manager.\nArsenal in EA FC 26\nFirst launched as FIFA International Soccer in 1993, this iconic franchise has become a global phenomenon for developers EA Sports.\nIts enduring popularity was evidenced again when EA FC 26 was released, with the game selling over 5.5 million copies on PlayStation in its first week.\nTo put this into context, FC 26 sold more copies in its first week on PlayStation than the latest NBA, NFL, MLB and college football games combined.\nArsenal are inevitably a primary focus for many EA FC players, with their squad packed with stars who are towards the top of the Premier League player ratings.\nGabriel Magalhaes (88) and Bukayo Saka (88) top the Gunners’ ratings, just behind a plethora of Liverpool and Manchester City players. Arsenal’s EA FC 26 ratings are as follows:\n- Gabriel Magalhaes – 88\n- Bukayo Saka – 88\n- Declan Rice – 87\n- William Saliba – 87\n- Martin Odegaard – 87\n- David Raya – 87\n- Viktor Gyokeres – 87\n- Mikel Merino – 83\n- Martin Zubimendi – 83\n- Eberechi Eze – 83\n- Piero Hincapie – 83\n- Leondro Trossard – 83\n- Ben White – 83\n- Jurrien Timber – 82\n- Kai Havertz – 82\n- Gabriel Martinelli – 81\n- Noni Madueke – 80\n- Gabriel Jesus – 80\n- Christian Norgaard – 80\n- Kepa Arrizabalaga – 79\n- Myles Lewis-Skelly – 78\n- Riccardo Calafiori – 78\n- Cristhian Mosquera – 77\n- Ethan Nwaneri – 76\nOne of EA FC’s primary attractions is its familiarity. The developers regularly push the boundaries of technology without losing the elements which made the game popular in the first place.\nThe main attraction is Ultimate Team. In simple terms, this requires you to assemble a squad capable of competing with the best in the world.\nFor Arsenal fans, this feature opens the door to cherry-pick the standout members of the squad and build a team of world-beaters around them.\nArsenal in FM26\nWhile the EA FC series delivers the pure football gaming experience many people crave, it falls short of matching Football Manager in terms of simulation accuracy.\nFans of the game were devastated when FM25 was cancelled due to development issues, but FM26 promises to make up for it in no uncertain terms.\nThe game will deliver significant upgrades, a new engine and even greater levels of matchday realism. For people who think they would be a better manager than Mikel Arteta, this is the game for them.\nHaving finished runners-up behind Manchester City for the past three seasons, Arsenal’s primary short-term aim in FM26 is to overhaul the reigning champions.\nMaking progress in the Champions League and winning at least one of the domestic cups would also help to keep the board and fans happy.\nHaving splashed the cash during the summer transfer window, Arsenal can provide FM 26 players with a squad capable of challenging for major silverware.\nThe FM series is undoubtedly the king of sports simulations, giving gamers the chance to prove they have what it takes to succeed in the cut-and-thrust of professional football.\nMany Arsenal fans will dive straight in by taking charge of their favourite club, although this move is fraught with danger given their lack of experience.\nA more rewarding save can be generated by taking charge of a club lower down the scale and guiding them up the pyramid.\nSuccess may eventually lead to the Gunners asking you to replace Arteta!",
