  "body_text": "PSG have been told to raid Arsenal and Liverpool to strengthen a squad that just lifted the Champions League trophy.\nParis Saint-German enjoyed a spectacular season under Luis Enrique, finally succeeding in their quest to become European champions while continuing to dominate in Ligue 1.\nGiven PSG’s young and incredibly dynamic squad, areas of improvement are not obvious but Marcel Desailly has named two players he would ‘like’ to see arrive at the Parc des Princes this summer.\nFootball icon Desailly somewhat surprisingly believes Arsenal forward Kai Havertz should be PSG’s No. 1 transfer target, citing his versatility as the main reason he would be of use to Enrique.\nSigned from Chelsea for £65m in 2023, Havertz has endured a mixed spell at the Emirates Stadium but was badly missed last season as Mikel Arteta had to deal with an injury crisis.\nHavertz’s status as Arsenal’s first-choice striker looks set to end this summer as Arteta targets a new No. 9 with Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres heavily linked with moves to north London.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?
