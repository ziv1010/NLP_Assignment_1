  "body_text": "Beyond their attacking concerns, Manchester United’s goalkeeping department also requires an upgrade.\nAndre Onana has struggled to justify his £47 million price tag, with inconsistent performances over the past two seasons testing the patience of United supporters.\nLauded for his “complete performance” in the 2023 Champions League final against Manchester City, he arrived at Old Trafford amid high expectations.\nSince joining, however, inconsistency has plagued his game. While he has shown glimpses of his quality, he has largely failed to maintain that level in a United shirt.\nA new goalkeeper on the horizon?\nWhile much of the current focus is on United’s pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo, some fans are keeping an eye on transfer rumours for updates on the club’s search for a goalkeeper.\nSo far, links have emerged with AS Roma’s Mile Svilar and Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez.\nIn their efforts to strengthen the goalkeeping department, former United goalkeeper Ben Foster has backed a move for Martinez, arguing that Onana has not done enough to keep the number one spot.\nFoster’s assessment of Onana\nAlthough Foster acknowledges Onana’s talent and believes he could thrive elsewhere, he argues that the Cameroonian has struggled to establish himself in the Premier League.\nDiscussing the challenges of playing in England’s top flight, particularly in relation to the 29-year-old, Foster told talkSPORT:\n“It’s a brutal league, the Premier League, and over the last two seasons, he hasn’t done enough to prove that he is a Manchester United number one.\n“I think he’s got ability, and like so many other United players, he’d go elsewhere and probably flourish. I think that’s probably going to be the case with him as well.”\nThe former England international then named Martinez as the ideal signing if United decide to pursue an upgrade.\nMartinez remains one of the best\nDespite enduring a relatively underwhelming Premier League campaign, Foster insists the Argentine international is still among the best goalkeepers in the world.\n“If the opportunity does come to sign somebody like Emi Martinez, they’ve got to go for it. He’s still one of the best goalkeepers in the world.\n“A lot of people have said this season wasn’t up to the standard of the previous two years, but he’s still one of the best goalkeepers in the world.”\nHe also emphasised the importance of a strong foundation in building a successful team.\n“You’ve got to have a strong spine in any football team. If you get the goalie right, you get a couple of strikers in, and Bruno’s staying now. It’s a great start to the transfer window for them.”\nUnited’s persistent interest in Martinez\nAs relayed by The Peoples Person, INEOS made contact with Aston Villa regarding the goalkeeper in the winter transfer window, but no agreement was reached.\nTheir interest in the 32-year-old remains, and with the West Midlands side needing a major sale to comply with profit and sustainability regulations, he is reportedly a player they are considering selling.\nIf United are waiting for the right opportunity to sign the former Arsenal goalkeeper, they may have one right in front of them.\nFeature image Richard Heathcote via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
