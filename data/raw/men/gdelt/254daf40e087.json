The transformation has been remarkable.\nWhen Villa were searching for Gerrard’s replacement, Emery was on a four-man list with Ruben Amorim, now much-coveted at Sporting Lisbon, Mauricio Pochettino and Julen Lopetegui.\nEmery, who had rejected Newcastle United at the 11th hour, was particularly favoured by owner Nassef Sawiris, unmoved by his sacking at Arsenal. He was more impressed by Emery winning the Europa League three times with Sevilla and a fourth at Villarreal, allied to his ability to fashion formidable teams. The Spaniard even reached the final in his supposed one full season of struggle at Arsenal.\nThe feeling was that Emery had walked into a difficult situation at Emirates Stadium as successor to Arsene Wenger, who had been there almost 22 years, and that his record was not as bad in hindsight as others thought. Arsenal finished fifth, one point behind Tottenham in the Champions League places, and also reached that Europa League final, which they lost 4-1 to Chelsea in Baku.\nPochettino was unlikely to come back into football with Villa at that stage but there were no doubts about Emery's pedigree and his suitability for Villa Park. And he was impressed enough with the club's vision and ambition that they succeeded where Newcastle United had failed in tempting him away from Villarreal.\nHe is the driving force behind Villa's renewal, his imprint all over this win against Bayern, from the fierce defensive organisation to the midfield pressing and a winner on the counter-attack, Duran lifting Pau Torres' long pass over the stranded Manuel Neuer.\nEmery's shrewd strategy also unsettled Bayern, with a more direct approach targeting defender Dayot Upamecano with Ollie Watkins running in behind. He was also aware of Bayern keeper Neuer's habit of playing as a sweeper keeper, which led directly to Duran's goal. The ploy worked to perfection.\nMention what Emery brings and one Villa insider told BBC Sport: \"Attention to detail. An incredible work ethic. Downtime does not exist as far as Unai is concerned. He is incredible and he is getting the rewards that work ethic deserves. He also respectful to everyone at the club and very popular.\"\nEmery arrives about 8am at Villa's Bodymoor Heath training HQ and staff using the gym at the centre are used to the sight of the manager arriving at 8.30pm after finishing at his desk, gathering details on his iPad while on the exercise bike before even making notes while using the rowing machine. The search for improvement and the all-important marginal gains is relentless.\nHe turns to his laptop once the formalities of a game are completed, sitting at the front of Villa's coach focusing immediately on the next match, the next opponent.\nHe has brought 23 Spanish coaches into Bodymoor Heath, a sign of Villa's trust and investment in Emery, but he has ensured they have totally integrated with those already there in a calm and welcoming atmosphere. The staff all work within strict lines of demarcation in an atmosphere of co-operation and without internal tensions, all aimed at Emery's common goal of bring Villa back to the top of the game.\nThere is mutual respect from all at Bodymoor Heath, an environment fostered by Emery, whose English is said to be much better than some might expect.\nEmery was joined by long-time associate Monchi, who was with him at Sevilla as president of football operations, while the appointment of the experienced Pako Ayestaran as his right-hand man was an ideal choice.\nAyestaran was Rafael Benitez's assistant when he enjoyed early success winning the Champions League and FA Cup at Liverpool. It was never quite the same at Anfield after he left, perhaps no coincidence as the 61-year-old is a personable and highly respected figure with great knowledge of the Premier League and the game in general.\nEmery, who also has the trusted Damian Vidagany at his side, was not afraid to keep members of Gerrard’s staff, such as the outstanding set-piece coach Austin MacPhee, a workaholic in the mode of his manager.\nTestimony to McPhee's expertise comes in the statistics for last season, when Villa were equal second in the so-called top five leagues for goals scored from set-pieces, excluding penalties, with a tally of 25, level with Manchester City.\nBundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen led the way with 26.\nThe manager identifies quality and nurtures it, especially in players, who are helped by relentless and specific video analysis, with Watkins a particular beneficiary.\nEmery is also getting the best out of the unpredictable maverick Duran, albeit as a substitute. He needs careful handling and the manager has proved adept in this area.\nSince his first weekend in charge on 5 November 2022, Villa have the fifth-most wins and fifth-most home wins in the Premier League, with only Manchester City, Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal ahead of them.\nBayern certainly know all about Emery's European expertise. They had not lost a game in the group stage since September 2017 when they were beaten 3-0 by Paris St-Germain. Their coach? Unai Emery.\nEmery and Villa now have six points from their two opening Champions League games against Young Boys of Switzerland and now Bayern - and under his expert guidance few will relish this environment under this coach.\nAston Villa have the fifth most wins and fifth most home wins of any Premier League side since the weekend of his first game in charge.\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\n- Published16 August 2025\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\nThere will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",
