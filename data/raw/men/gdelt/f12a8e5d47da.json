  "body_text": "Glenn Hoddle on Harry Kane, Graham Potter & Chelsea transfers\nTwo of London's top clubs are back in UEFA Champions League action this week, with both looking to turn their seasons around.\nTottenham will face off against AC Milan at San Siro looking to bounce back from a harrowing 4-1 defeat Leicester City, while over in Germany, Chelsea will be hoping to kickstart their stuttering campaign with a win over Borussia Dortmund.\nAhead of these fixtures, 90min sat down with ex-England manager Glenn Hoddle to discuss the fortunes of his two former clubs.\nTottenham vs Milan\n\"I was quite happy with the draw. AC Milan are a wonderful football club with a great history, but they're not playing anywhere near the level they were years ago.\n\"I think it's quite a well match two-legged game. Both clubs will fancy their chances, but I do see Spurs, if they play like they did against Man City I can see them getting through that tie. I'm quite optimistic about that. It won't be a walk in the park because San Siro is always a tough place to go and play, but I don't think it's bad time for Tottenham to go and play them.\"\nOn this edition of Oh What a Night, part of the 90min podcast network, Sean Walsh & Jude Summerfield discuss record breaker Harry Kane at length after he became Tottenham's record goalscorer.\nIf you can't see this embed, click here to listen to the podcast!\nHarry Kane\n\"He's been amazing. He's turned into an amazing footballer and not just for his goalscoring and beating Jimmy Greaves' wonderful record, but it's the assists that he's made on his way and his all-round game has come on so much.\n\"Harry didn't come in at 18 as a wonderkid, he had to go out on loan to some clubs - some of them it worked, and some it didn't work - but what that does, is that it shows kids a great example of someone who kept fighting and kept believing in himself.\n\"I think number one priority for Kane is to win a trophy with Tottenham. He has a real decision to make if nothing happens this season, or they don't get back into the top four, that's the key. If they don't then we might see him go to Man Utd.\n\"A lot depends on this season.\"\nOn this episode of Son of Chelsea, part of the 90min podcast network, Daniel Childs reacts to Graham Potter receives backing from the club's board after a run of poor Premier League results & Andrey Santos starring for Brazil. If you can't see this embed, click here to listen to the podcast!\nGraham Potter's future\n\"I think they've paid over the odds [for player] but that's up to them if they want to do that. What they have brought in is quality, and the quality they've brought in will make them a better team from now until the end of the season.\n\"Whether Graham Potter can mould that as a team yet I don't know, I think he's been frustrated with the injuries he's had. He started well then lost a lot of key players, and has not been given a lot of new quality players on top and he's thinking 'well I still don't know my best team'.\n\"He was probably thinking that, by the next window [January 2022] his team would have an identity, like they did at Brighton, but I don't see that yet. He hasn't really got a number nine that's going to score a lot of goals so everyone has to chip in for Chelsea now to score goals. They also have to work out a system that's going to win matches right now.\n\"The Champions League is a key moment for Potter and for Chelsea.\n\"Chelsea could become one of the best teams in the country and one of the best teams in Europe very quickly with the quality they have. If they [the signings] all hit the ground running, they mould together, and goals start coming, Chelsea could turn around [their fortunes] very quickly.\n\"If Chelsea fans and the owner see this happening then I think Potter will be safe and will be there next season. They'll only sack him if results go the other way and they end up 13th or 14th in the league, they get knocked out by Dortmund in the Champions League. The results in the next month are going to be key.\n\"The Champions League is a key moment for Potter and for Chelsea. \"\n- Glenn Hoddle\n\"They have a team in Dortmund that they can beat over two legs. If they win that, get a reasonably good draw [in the quarter-finals], suddenly the momentum begins to turn\nChelsea transfers\n\"We probably won't see the very best of Enzo Fernandez until next season when N'Golo Kante is fit, or if they bring in someone else to play the holding role.\n\"I think Joao Felix looked, for the period of time before he got sent off, incredibly like a Chelsea player. He looked like he been at Chelsea for years.\n\"Mudryk looks very exciting too.\n\"If those three hit the ground running then this Chelsea team will be elevated very, very quickly.\"\nYou can watch all of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League action exclusively on BT Sport.",
