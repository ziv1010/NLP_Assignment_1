  "body_text": "Erik ten Hag says Manchester United are comfortably ahead of expectations at this stage of the season and is unfazed by the ongoing uncertainty over a potential takeover.\nThe race to buy the club from the Glazer family is still on, with the bids from a Qatari group, Jim Ratcliffe and Thomas Zilliacus still thought to be in the running.\nIf the Glazers do sell then it could mean a seismic change at the club, but Ten Hag is focussed only on the football, of which he is very proud so far this season.\nThe Dutchman feels that the Red Devils are doing much better than what seemed likely at the start of the season, noting that there could still be three pieces of silverware collected this season, and a return to the Champions League.\nAsked by club legend Paul Scholes on BT Sport about the ongoing takeover process, Ten Hag said: ‘It’s not up to me, I see it as a project, but I also know you need results.\n‘We are in a perfect situation, we couldn’t expect we are in this situation when we started last year in June, let’s be honest.\n‘We are in the top four, quarter-finals of Europa League, semi-final of FA Cup and we already have a cup in our pocket.
