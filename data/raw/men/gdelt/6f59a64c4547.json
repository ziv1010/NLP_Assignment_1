  "body_text": "Ethiopian Insurance will face the reigning CAF Champions League champions, Pyramids FC, in Cairo after an attempt by the Ethiopian side to play their first-leg game in Kigali failed to materialise.\nThe Ethiopian champions have now opted to stage the game in Cairo, leaving their chances of progressing to the group stage of the Champions League in serious doubt.\nFollowing the decision taken by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to bar Ethiopian stadiums from hosting the Champions League second qualifying round match between Insurance and Pyramids, the Ethiopian outfit initially chose to play in Kigali, Rwanda. However, the game has now been moved to Cairo. Ethiopian Insurance will leave for Cairo on Friday, October 24, while the first-leg game is slated for Sunday, October 26.\nTwo seasons ago, Ethiopian giants Saint George faced Egyptian club Al Ahly in Cairo after going through a difficult financial situation. Similar financial difficulties are not recorded at the state-owned insurance provider, and the reason why the Ethiopian club opted to stage the match in Cairo is not known.\nIt is common for some African clubs to stage their home games at a neutral venue due to the lack of a CAF-accredited stadium in their country. Nonetheless, the lack of home advantage often diminishes their chances of qualifying for the next round.\n(Pan-African Football)",
