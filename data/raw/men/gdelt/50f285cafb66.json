  "body_text": "Chelsea’s league season has come down to this, the final day, with ultimate success and ultimate failure both still possible. We could finish as high as third, and as low as seventh. We have already bettered last season’s points total by three, but the final position will determine whether we could upgrade to Champions League football as well.\nNottingham Forest vs. Chelsea, Premier League: Preview, team news, how to watch\nLast day, all to play for\nTop five will qualify for the one European competition that truly matters. Sixth place then goes to the Europa League and seventh to the Conference League (unless we finish seventh and we also win this year’s Conference League, in which case we’d go into the Europa League qualifiers next season).\nThe task is simple: win and we’re in. If we don’t, we would need help from either Everton (away to Newcastle United) or from Manchester United (at home against Aston Villa). Everton are already on vacation and if you watched the Europa League final, you’ll know that Manchester United are even less likely to do anything. Manchester City (away to Fulham) are two points ahead at the start of the day, so their result doesn’t affect our fate.\nWe control our own destiny, so let’s take control.\nDate / Time: Sunday, May 25, 2025, 16.00 BST; 11am EDT; 8:30pm IST\nVenue: The City Ground, Nottingham\nReferee: Anthony Taylor (on pitch); Peter Bankes (VAR)\nForecast: Breezy and cooler\nOn TV: Sky Sports Main Event (UK); USA, Universo (USA); none? (India); SuperSport MáXimo 3 (NGA); elsewhere\nStreaming: Sky Go (UK); NBC Sports Live, Telemundo Deportes En Vivo (US); Disney+ Hotstar (India); DStv Now (NGA)\nNottingham Forest team news: Enzo Maresca used to bring up the 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture as one of the more undeserved results of our early season, but Forest have made good on their promising start to the campaign, and are about to achieve their best season in thirty years, since finishing third in 1994-95.\nLed by Spurs washout Nuno Espirito Santo, Forest have beens solid at the back all year thanks to the Murillo-Milenković partnership, and have gotten crucial goals from Chris Wood at the other end. Only Mo Salah, Alexander Isak, and Erling Haaland scored more than the big target man’s 20. The team’s next highest scorer, Morgan Gibbs-White has barely a third of that total at 7. Anthony Elanga and our very own Callum Hudson-Odoi have chipped in with a handful as well. Another former Chelsea Blue, Ola Aina, has been playing a crucial role at right back.\nForest have an almost clean bill of health, with only Taiwo Awoniyi missing out after a scary collision with the goalpost a couple weeks ago (and most unfortunately on a sequence that was only happening because the flag isn’t supposed to go up on offsides until the play is over). The backup striker, who scored twice in this fixture two years ago, had to be put into an induced coma and have emergency surgery on his abdomen. Thankfully, he is currently in recovery and could be back next season.\nChelsea team news: Chelsea are also finishing the season with a fairly short injury list, with Wesley Fofana the only notable name on it. He’s not our only notable absentee of course, as Nicolas Jackson is suspended and Mykhailo Mudryk is (provisionally) banned. Wonder how long I will have to keep (occasionally) mentioning Mudryk in these previews before we cut ties with him.\nMarc Guiu and Christopher Nkunku have both been passed fit and could help deputize for Jackson instead of Tyrique George. Jadon Sancho is also available again after being ineligible against Manchester United last week.\nChelsea have just one win and six points in our last ten (10!) away games in the league. That’s clearly not good enough ... though two wins in eleven would be good enough for now.\nPreviously: Chelsea were not able to find a winner against 10-man Forest at the Bridge, with both goalkeepers making stupendous saves in added-on time to preserve a point for either side. Overall, we have just one win in five tries against Forest since their return to the top flight in 2023. That one win was in this fixture last season: Jackson scoring the winner in the final ten minutes from Reece James’s cross.",
