  "body_text": "It’s back to midweek European football for Chelsea, this time with the Blues making the shirt trip across to the Netherlands to face FC Twente on the second matchday of the UEFA Women’s Champions League group stage.\nFC Twente Vrouwen vs. Chelsea FCW, UEFA Women’s Champions League: Preview, team news, how to watch\nThursday night of Champions League football\nIn preseason, Chelsea held a friendly against another Dutch side, Feyenoord, and absolutely demolished them to the tune of 9-0. Against the Vrouwen Eredivisie champions, things won’t be as easy.\nDate / Time: Thursday, October 16, 2024, 20.00 BST; 3pm EDT; 12:30am (next day) IST\nVenue: De Grolsch Veste, Enschede, Netherlands\nReferee: Maria Caputi (ITA)\nForecast: Light rain showers and light winds\nOn TV: none (US); DAZN (UK); elsewhere\nStreaming: DAZN (US); DAZN (UK)\nFC Twente news: Twente not only won the Eredivisie for the ninth time in their history last season, but also beat Welsh champions Cardiff City, Icelandic champions Valur, and Croatian champions Osijek to come through the qualifiers and reach the Champions League’s group stage. And in their first group game, they served notice of their intentions and kept that winning streak going by beating Scottish champions Celtic, 2-0, in Glasgow.\nTo face the English champions, the match will be played at the 30,205-capacity De Grolsch Veste instead of Twente’s usual home grounds, the 2,000-seat Sportpark Schreurserve,\nManager Joran Pot doesn’t have too many injuries to deal with: the only major absence is forward Liz Rijsbergen, who’s been out since April due to a knee injury.\nChelsea team news: Complaining about finally beating Arsenal at the Emirates after four years of trying, and failing, to do so, might sound a bit silly. But the positives of that 2-1 win over the weekend were not quite enough to outshine the glaring weaknesses of a team who seem unable to figure out how to control matches despite having the right personnel on the pitch.\nWe come in to The Wieke Kaptein Derby still with some noticeable absences, including Niamh Charles, Aniek Nouwen, Sophie Ingle, Mia Fishel, and Sam Kerr. In her press conference, Sonia Bompastor talked a bit about keeping up Kerr’s spirits during this long recovery, but did not provide an exact timeline for the striker’s potential return to action.\nAdditionally, Catarina Macario didn’t travel with the team, staying behind to work individually on her fitness.\nPreviously: It’s our first ever match against Twente, though we did play, and beat, their rivals Ajax in the quarterfinals last season, with Sjoeke Nüsken scoring twice!",
