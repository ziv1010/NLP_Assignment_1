  "body_text": "The final game on Sunday, Oct. 26 is one that might be a bit emotional as Aaron Rodgers takes on the Green Bay Packers for the first time in his career when they visit the Pittsburgh Steelers at Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh.\nThis NFL game is scheduled to start at 8:20 p.m. EDT and will be broadcast on NBC. Fans looking to watch can do so for free by using DirecTV, which offers a free trial. FuboTV offers up to $30 off your first month. SlingTV doesn’t offer a free trial but has promotional offers available for streaming the game, and NFL+ airs all local market games, and NFL+ Premium allows fans to watch condensed game replays and all-22 coaches film. Peacock has plans starting at $7.99 a month and allows fans to watch Sunday Night Football games along with any other game broadcast on NBC.\nBoth teams enter this contest at the top of their respective divisions, but the story is unquestionably Rodgers playing his second game against a former team this season. His first game with the Steelers was against Rodgers’ most recent former team, the New York Jets. He tossed four touchdowns and led a game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter to seal a 34-32 win. Rodgers also played in the game the last time the Packers faced a former Super Bowl winning quarterback who spent well more than a decade in Green Bay in Brett Favre. Favre also went to the Jets after leaving the Packers, but then ended up with the Minnesota Vikings for 2009 and 2010. The Vikings won both of the games they played in 2009, but Green Bay swept the series in 2010, the same season they won their most recent Super Bowl.\nBut now Pittsburgh is coming off a 33-31 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in which Rodgers once again threw four scores, but he also had two interceptions. Pat Freiermuth went for 111 yards and two scores and Jaylen Warren had 127 yards on the ground.\nGreen Bay has a slight edge on the Detroit Lions for the NFC North lead by virtue of their 4-1-1 record featuring one less loss, although the Packers also have one less win than the Lions. Green Bay earned a 27-23 win over the Arizona Cardinals last week in which Micah Parsons had three sacks to lead the defense.\nWho: Green Bay Packers vs. Pittsburgh Steelers\nWhen: Sunday, Oct. 26 at 8:20 p.m. EDT\nWhere: Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh\nStream: DirecTV (free trial); FuboTV (free trial); Paramount+ (free trial); SlingTV; ESPN; Peacock; NFL+\nBetting: Check out our MA sports betting guide, where you can learn basic terminology, definitions and how to read odds for those interested in learning how to bet in Massachusetts.\nWhat is DirecTV?\nDirecTV is an internet TV service that offers your favorite entertainment, news and sports channels, as well as local TV stations and regional sports networks.
