  "body_text": "Despite all the Discovery List machinations, Kevin De Bruyne won’t be coming to MLS after all.\nWhile Miami and then Chicago had MLS priority on Manchester City’s departing Belgian star (and NYCFC and D.C. United claimed interest, too, according to The Athletic), he is ticketed for Serie A champion Napoli instead. His decision robs MLS of some additional firepower, but that doesn’t mean the door is shut on stars making their way to North America this season.\nAdvertisement\nWith the European club season over, the FIFA Club World Cup here and the MLS secondary transfer window due to open on July 24, there’s ample opportunity for significant additions to be made. And while the likes of Miami, Chicago, NYCFC and D.C. missed out this time, they and others will be perusing the global market for stars who are either out of contract like De Bruyne or are eyeing the North American market at this stage of their career regardless.\nSo if it’s not KDB – or Antoine Griezmann, Ángel Di María or Luka Modrić, who have all pledged or appear to be pledging their immediate futures elsewhere – then who will be the next accomplished superstar to come to MLS?\nOur Athletic staff writers have their say:\nFELIPE CARDENAS\nHow do we define “superstar” in a league that already has Lionel Messi? There are only a few players who can be mentioned in the same breath as the eight-time Ballon d’Or winner. Neymar is in that group, without a doubt. The Brazilian signed a short-term contract with his boyhood club Santos in the winter and he’s expected to extend his stay in Brazil through 2026. Neymar is 33 and if he avoids any major injury setbacks, he should be part of Carlo Ancelotti’s national team project.\nIn that sense, it’s not outlandish to suggest that an MLS club will try to sign him again after the 2026 World Cup. Neymar, who will certainly be talked about during the tournament on North American soil, will still have enough to give both from a football perspective and commercially in the U.S. I standby, however, that signing Neymar to an MLS contract could absolutely backfire. Messi has delivered in MLS. I’m not sure that Neymar would play in enough games to be a factor. The same goes for Colombia star James Rodríguez, even if his left foot is still top tier.\nSo my pick is Paulo Dybala. The Argentine attacker’s contract with Roma ends in the summer of 2026, at which point he’ll be a highly sought after free agent. Dybala has not been a consistent call up to Argentina’s national team, but the 31-year-old remains highly respected by head coach Lionel Scaloni. The left-footer has been overtaken by younger Argentine attackers and may not be part of Argentina’s 2026 World Cup squad. Still, Dybala will have sufficient equity in MLS, certainly in Miami, where he could briefly join Messi and potentially succeed Inter Miami’s captain as one of the club’s next big signings. Dybala said no to a massive pay day in Saudi Arabia last year. Will he do it again, or will life in the U.S. appeal to him?\nJEFF RUETER\nMost often in these discussions, MLS is viewed as a final venture for a player, a reputation earned after greats like Robbie Keane, Frank Lampard and Thierry Henry spent their final playing days in the States. A less-taken route has been one of relative career rehabilitation at a stage when few top European clubs are interested: most famously, the path Zlatan Ibrahimović took after a hard knee ligament injury with Manchester United before ultimately retiring with AC Milan.\nAdvertisement\nPaul Pogba’s career has been at a crossroads for quite some time, dating back to his doping ban from the sport in September 2023. Now reinstated – and spending a ton of time training in Miami – the 32-year-old World Cup winner is eager to get back in his boots and provide a worthy coda to his career. While the perception of wavering motivation has followed him throughout his career, one has to think he recognizes how vital this first foray back onto the pitch will be.\nMuch of MLS’s style of play would suit the French midfielder. One of the few leagues that still sees many teams play with a true number 10, Pogba could be the creative focal point of a team without doing as much of the hard yards in the engine room. He remains a marketable figure for a generation of fans who found him to be a game-breaker in the FIFA and EA FC series. Coming to MLS wouldn’t be a sentence for impending retirement in this case — instead, it could be a circuit for his career relaunch in world-class facilities away from Europe’s spotlight as he shakes off the rust.\nPABLO MAURER\nFor years, Thomas Müller has been among the most unappreciated players in global football.\nIt’s a strange thing to say about a player who has won the Bundesliga a dozen times and has multiple Champions League titles to his name as well. But Müller, who has sometimes lacked the physical presence and off-the-field notoriety of the other greats of his generation, is a perfect fit for MLS.\nThe 35-year-old German national team legend would fit nicely at any number of MLS clubs in need of attacking help at any number of positions. Throughout his career, he’s been a hard player to pin down in any other area – when asked about this, Müller once referred to himself as a Raumdeuter, a delightfully German word that Müller coined to describe his understanding of space in the attacking third.\nAdvertisement\nMüller would hardly be the first attacking player in MLS history whose fundamental understanding of time and space would prove lethal in a league that, by most accounts, is still growing tactically. Lionel Messi, David Villa and even a player like Diego Valeri all come to mind. Müller’s versatility – he has played as a second striker, attacking midfielder and has even sat deeper at times – is another trait that would lend itself well to a league where older players thrive, at times, by withdrawing a bit or remaining flexible.\nThe Bayern great has already been connected to MLS multiple times, most recently to LAFC, FC Cincinnati and the Chicago Fire, all of whom feel like viable destinations for a player of his ilk. It’s hard to find potential negatives to an MLS move, but here’s one: fans of the league sometimes prefer attacking players who pass the “eye test.”\nMüller’s greatness has never been flashy – but true fans of the league and the sport of football as a whole would be in heaven watching him, even off the ball.\nPAUL TENORIO\nI have to acknowledge first that Felipe’s pick is spot-on with the move I think Inter Miami will be plotting as it considers how to transition out of its Messi Era. Dybala makes a lot of sense. It’s not a perfect fit, necessarily, for Dybala and Messi to be on the field together. Bringing him in to help Inter Miami into the post-Messi phase of its on-field existence makes a ton of sense.\nI am surprised that no team in MLS has yet popped up as a legitimate suitor for Roberto Firmino. He seems set to leave Saudi Arabia on a free this summer and, at 33, would be an interesting two-year contract for an MLS team in need of star power and firepower. The name I think is worth keeping an eye on this window, however? Alexandre Lacazette. I’m not sure if Lacazette counts as a big enough name for this list, but the 34-year-old French forward is coming out of contract with Lyon and has scored 27, 19 and 15 goals in Ligue 1 over the past three seasons, respectively.\nThere have been previous links with both LA teams, but with the Galaxy’s DP spots filled could he make sense for LAFC, even with Olivier Giroud on the books? I could see it happening — and I think it could actually make some sense for a 1.5-year deal through the end of 2026.\n(Top photo: Alex Livesey/Getty Images)",
