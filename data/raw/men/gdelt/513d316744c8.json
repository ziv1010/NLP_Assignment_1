The Reds are paying a heavy price for not investing in their position of greatest weakness – the midfield.\nLiverpool did attempt to sign Aurelien Tchouameni from Monaco last summer. However, Jurgen Klopp and co. opted against signing a viable alternative when the Frenchman only had eyes for Real Madrid.\nThe end result has seen Liverpool relinquish their grasp on both domestic cups. Their European campaign is all but over after falling to a humbling 5-2 home defeat to Real Madrid in the first leg of their Round of 16 clash last week.\nSimply qualifying for next season’s UCL has quickly become the club’s primary focus. A 0-0 stalemate with Crystal Palace on Saturday, followed by Tottenham’s 2-0 victory over Chelsea 24 hours later has seen the gap to fourth stretch to nine points.\nJude Bellingham will be the centre of attention regarding Liverpool’s transfer efforts over the summer. BILD’s Christian Falk recently stressed a Liverpool failure to qualify for the UCL won’t be a deal-breaker for Bellingham.\nHowever, according to a remarkable report out of Spain, missing out on Europe’s top competition could spark a shock Mohamed Salah sale.\nSalah willing to ditch Liverpool rebuild – report\nThe report in question (as cited by the BBC and Goal), claims the 30-year-old forward ‘would be willing to leave the club’. His main reasoning, per the report, is ‘he wants to continue playing in the UEFA Champions League’.\nLiverpool look destined to embark on something of a rebuild under Jurgen Klopp next season. If the report is accurate, Salah wants no part of it if UCL football isn’t on the table.\nSalah has been everything Liverpool fans could’ve hoped for and more since arriving from Roma in 2017. Indeed, the Egyptian has top-scored for the club across all competitions in every single season he’s been at Anfield.\nHowever, while clearly not alone in this regard, Salah’s form has fallen off this season.\nHe’s returned 19 goals and nine assists in all competitions, though has only found the net eight times in 23 Premier League outings. Salah is also fourth in the category of big chances missed in the EPL this season.\nSalah will turn 31 over the summer and his current contract is due to expire in the summer of 2025. Perhaps with all those factors combined, the Spanish report categorically states ‘Liverpool wants to sell Mohamed Salah in [the] summer’.\nLikeliest suitor named; price tag cited\nThe article name French giant PSG as Salah’s likeliest next stop in the event he is moved on. PSG may be looking for a superstar new forward if either Lionel Messi or Neymar depart at season’s end.\nOn that front, Italian journalist Rudi Galetti recently reported ‘first contact’ had been made between PSG and Salah.\nPricing a player of Salah’s undoubted talents yet advancing age will be difficult. However, the Spanish report reckons PSG would be willing to pay €80m (approx. £70.5m) to sign the Egyptian.\nWhether that would be enough to convince Liverpool to sell unquestionably their most dangerous attacker remains to be seen.\nThe Reds may yet surge towards fourth spot with their fixture list poised to become a whole lot less congested. Even if they don’t, the Spanish outlet in question aren’t known for being one of the more reliable sources when it comes to transfer news.\nFurthermore, TEAMtalk recently learned PSG are quietly confident of tying Messi down to fresh terms.\nFor the time being at least, Liverpool fans should not worry too much over the prospect of Salah taking flight.",
