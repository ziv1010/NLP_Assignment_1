  "body_text": "Kieran Tierney has confirmed that he will not be returning to Arsenal from Real Sociedad this month.\nThe 26-year-old left-back joined Real Sociedad on a season-long loan last summer and has made 12 appearances in all competitions so far this season.\nArsenal’s defensive options have been stretched due to a long-term injury to Jurrien Timber sustained on the opening day of the season, as well as injuries to Takehiro Tomiyasu, who has joined up with the Japan national team to compete at this month’s Asia Cup.\nAdvertisement\nDespite Arsenal’s mounting injury issues, Tierney has ruled out an early return to north London, saying in an interview with Spanish newspaper Noticias de Gipuzkoa: “Several people have asked me about this but the answer is no. I am definitely staying here (in January). Arsenal fans are great, they always gave me a lot of support. During the four years I was there, I will always be grateful to the fans.”\n“I don’t want to speak badly about the Premier League because there are some great atmospheres, but in Spain it really is amazing. If you hear fans from Osasuna and Cadiz, they don’t stop singing. It is great here.”\nThe Scotland international also spoke on his relationship with Mikel Arteta, saying: “It is fine! This is football, I have no problem with my situation (of being on the bench when he was there). I had almost no injuries, but it is football.”\nTierney, who joined Arsenal from Celtic in the summer of 2019, played a bit-part role last season after the arrival of Oleksandr Zinchenko from Manchester City. He made 36 appearances in total during the 2022-23 season, with the majority of those being off the bench.\nSince moving to Spain, he has helped his side rise to sixth position in La Liga, while also qualifying for the knockout round of the Champions League, where they will face Paris Saint-Germain in February.\nAsked about potentially extending his time with the Spanish club beyond this season, Tierney said: “I signed to be here for one year, I am happy. I cannot say what will happen next but I am enjoying every day. The decision (to join Real Sociedad permanently) is not mine to take. But it is true that I love it here, and I’m enjoying it very much.\n“As soon as the opportunity to come (to Real Sociedad) emerged, I was totally convinced about it. 100 per cent. I knew that it would be tough without my family and I cannot be with my friends, but I can assure you I am really enjoying everything. I am happy. I do not miss my home.”\nGO DEEPER\nWhat's behind Arsenal's mini slump?\n(Getty Images)",
