Sadio Mané won the ball from El Aynaoui, caressed it twice, then backheeled with audacious calm to release to skipper Iddrissa Gueye who hits the ball first to the path of the onrushing Pape Gueye.\nGueye muscled his way through the heart of Morocco, and not even their star man, Achraf Hakimi, could halt the surge.\nAt 93:13s, he unleashed a fierce left-footed strike into the top corner of Yassine Bounou’s goal, leaving the goalkeeper rooted, a mere spectator to brilliance.\nAs Gueye wheeled away towards the corner flag, sliding on his knees in pure release, his teammates followed in unison. Joy, unconfined. Had the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium possessed a roof, it would have been torn clean off.\n“Supreme Senegal has found a way,” the matchday commentator declared, weaving words into scenes so perfectly timed they felt choreographed. Even neutrals were swept off their feet.\nAnd guess where the continent watched it all unfold?\nSuperSport.\nSuperSport, available on DStv and GOtv, cemented its status as the \"Home of African Football\" by delivering world-class, record-breaking coverage of the TotalEnergies 2025 AFCON in Morocco.\nFrom the electric tension of the opening group stage fixtures to the breathtaking extra-time drama that unfolded in Rabat on Sunday night, SuperSport stood as the definitive heartbeat of the AFCON.\nBy positioning itself at the very epicentre of the action, SuperSport translated the raw emotion, cultural prestige, and technical brilliance of the tournament into an immersive experience for millions of viewers across the continent.\nAs Senegal stood tall as the newly crowned Kings of Africa Sunday night at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium, the broadcast delivery proved once again that SuperSport is more than just a broadcaster; it is the bridge between the beautiful game and the fans who live for it, ensuring that Africa’s greatest sporting narrative was told with the world-class authority it deserves.\nBringing the African Football Family Together\nThe coverage was anchored by a formidable assembly of footballing minds, ensuring that the technical quality on the screen matched the historic brilliance on the pitch.\nIcons such as UEFA Champions League and AFCON winner Salomon Kalou and 2019 AFCON Golden Boot winner Odion Ighalo provided deep analytical insights, supported by the veteran voices of Daniel Akpeyi and Olisa Ndah.\nThe tactical narratives were woven together by South African legends Shaun Bartlett, Bongani Khumalo, Stanton Fredericks, Teko Modise, Phumudzo Manenzhe, and Simphiwe Dludlu.\nInternational flair was further bolstered by Gabadinho Mhango and Inacio Miguel, while the SS Máximo team—including Rui Almeida, Óscar Paul, and José (Zéca) Marques—ensured a sophisticated Lusophone perspective for fans across every region of the continent.\nCAF Broadcast Productions also appointed a specialised elite talent squad featuring legendary football historian Mark Gleeson, trailblazing commentator and former Banyana Banyana captain Amanda Dlamini, and veteran broadcaster Thabiso Tema, who provided expert coverage of all 52 matches live from Morocco.\nThrough it all, SuperSport ensured that every decision and every celebration was beamed to millions with crystal-clear precision.\nRendani Ramovha, CANAL+ Director: Content, Sport (English & Portuguese-speaking Africa), commented: “This AFCON has been a landmark moment for African sport, and SuperSport is honoured to have been the bridge between the action in Morocco and millions of fans across the continent.”\n“From the record-breaking goals to the unbelievable drama of the final in Rabat, our goal was to provide world-class coverage that reflected the scale of this tournament and to bring the family together through a celebration of African cultures and flavours.\n“Through our dedicated channels, our magazine shows, digital content, fan engagement and legendary panel of experts, we have set a new standard for sports broadcasting in Africa.”\nThe tournament itself was a triumph of attacking intent, reaching a historic milestone with 121 goals scored in total.\nThis prolific haul officially beat the previous record of 119 goals set during the last edition in Côte d’Ivoire, cementing the 2025 tournament as the most clinical in AFCON history.\nSuperSport’s dedicated channels captured every iconic moment, from Nigeria’s symphonic 4-0 thrashing of Mozambique—where Victor Osimhen’s brilliance was briefly overshadowed by a dramatic second-half substitution—to Mohamed Salah’s emotional 124th-minute winner that secured Egypt’s quarterfinal berth.\nFans also witnessed the rise of new stars, such as Algeria’s 22-year-old Adil Boulbina, who settled a gruelling quarterfinal against Congo with a composed, curling finish in the dying seconds.\nThe tournament also delivered a high-stakes third-place playoff where Stanley Nwabali denied Mohamed Salah from the spot to secure the bronze medal for Nigeria, while Bafana Bafana provided their own sparks of brilliance throughout their campaign, including a spirited victory against Angola.\nThe spectacle reached its boiling point in a finale defined by unprecedented chaos and ultimate glory.\nAfter a month of tactical excellence, the final between Senegal and hosts Morocco erupted into bedlam during injury time when a controversial VAR decision led to a brief walk-off by the Senegal squad.\nIn a moment of pure agony for the home crowd, Morocco’s Brahim Díaz saw his winning penalty attempt drift over the bar following a duffed Panenka.\nReinvigorated by the reprieve, Senegal seized the moment in extra time as Pape Gueye silenced the stadium with a brilliant winner, capping off the most exhilarating finale in AFCON history.\nLatest Stories\n-\nThe Accra Mandate:
