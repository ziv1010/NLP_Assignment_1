However, Tonali emerged as another key target to bolster the engine room yesterday in a surprise twist.\nThe Italy international joined Newcastle from AC Milan for £55 million in 2023, but was almost immediately banned for 10 months for breaching betting rules. However, he has shone since his return, demonstrating a complete skillset at the heart of Eddie Howe’s side.\nTonali’s contract at St James’s Park runs until 2029, with the option of an additional year. This puts the Magpies in a strong negotiating position for their prized asset.\nNonetheless, there were shockwaves across Tyneside at the end of January after speculation the player’s agent was actively talking to Arsenal about a switch to the Emirates.\nThe Premier League leaders are joined by Manchester City in their admiration of the Italian, while Serie A giant Juventus are also interested. Sources close to the midfielder indicate he is open to a return to his homeland.\nHowever, United are prepared to jump the growing queue for Tonali with a much greater need for his services than either of their domestic rivals, and a much larger budget than their competition in Turin.\nNewcastle set their price\nNewcastle are understood to “value Tonali between £80m and £100m,” as per talkSPORT – a significant profit on their initial investment.\nThe report states the Red Devils are “monitoring” the situation as they begin to solidify their plans this summer, with the prospect of Champions League football looking better by the week under interim head coach Michael Carrick. A return to Europe’s elite competition will prove decisive in United’s ability to compete with Arsenal and City for the 25-year-old midfielder, with his agent, Giuseppe Riso, revealing his desire to “lead” Newcastle into the Champions League next season.\n“Newcastle are having a hard time letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League. These transfer discussions will take place later. We’ll see how the season ends and then we’ll decide what to do,” Riso stated to Italian media.\n“There’s no preference at the moment. It’s still early. What we’re saying today won’t apply tomorrow. Newcastle couldn’t let him go now, and there’s no point in moving, especially since Sandro is very attached to the club. We’ll evaluate and decide what to do in the summer.”\nFinal Thoughts\nTonali fits the profile United are looking to upgrade their midfield this summer, with an excellent pairing of physical and technical attributes, and zero concerns over how he will perform in the Premier League.\nThe club’s other targets will cost a similar amount – and the Italian has a more well-rounded skillset than Baleba or Wharton, though Anderson remains the gold standard for midfielders in England not called Declan Rice.\nAs such, an £80m raid on Newcastle would prove a bargain in the long run at Old Trafford, and would still be a good deal even if it creeped closer to the six-figures mark.\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
