The last chance to bolster ranks before the end of the term, it proved an opportunity too good to be wasted for many.\nJust £96.2m was spent during 2024's January window but that tally was obliterated this term. While clubs had to strike a balance between money management and improving on-field performances, a plethora of sides took the chance to splash the cash.\nHere are all the done deals from the 2025 January window in the Premier League.\nArsenal\nArsenal did not make any additions to their squad despite the long-term injury to talisman Bukayo Saka. They reportedly struck a deal for long-term midfield target Martin Zubimendi, although that move won't happen until the summer.\nIn\nOut\nAston Villa\nAston Villa were busy bees during the summer window and have already proven they boast a squad capable of juggling domestic and Champions League football. They bolstered their ranks further, however, signing Donyell Malen from Borussia Dortmund and Andres Garcia from Levante before Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio joined in blockbuster loan deals towards the end of the window.\nJhon Duran was the major departure from Villa Park, as he joined the cash-rich Al Nassr in a transfer worth over £70m.\nIn\nOut\nBournemouth\nBournemouth added to their squad during the January window, recruiting young defenders Matai Akinmboni and Julio Soler from DC United and Lanus, respectively. Philip Billing and Max Aarons both departed on loan, with the former teaming up with Antonio Conte at Napoli. Deadline Day arrival Eli Junior Kroupi is one to watch.\nIn\nOut\nBrentford\nBrentford were not as busy as expected in January but held on to star players Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa. Michael Kayode became their first and only signing of note after joining on loan from Fiorentina.\nIn\nOut\nBrighton & Hove Albion\nBrighton & Hove Albion agreed a deal to sign promising Paraguayan midfielder Diego Gomez from Inter Miami in December, with the 21-year-old making his debut during the Seagulls' victory at Manchester United. Eiran Cashin also arrived from Championship outfit Derby County, while Stefanos Tzimas joined on Deadline Day before returning to FC Nurnberg on loan. Evan Ferguson should get regular game time at West Ham.\nIn\nOut\nChelsea\nChelsea can never be ruled out of the transfer market, with the Blues seldom able to control themselves when it comes to shiny new signings. However, January was more about exits, with fringe players leaving permanently and on loan.\nCarney Chukwuemeka and Axel Disasi were the highest-profile exits to Borussia Dortmund (on loan) and Aston Villa (on loan), respectively. Ben Chilwell also earned a move away having been cast aside by Enzo Maresca.\nIn\nOut\nCrystal Palace\nCrystal Palace received interest in a number of their players over January, including star defender Marc Guehi. However, they also added to their squad, signing Millwall star Romain Esse for £14.5m and Ben Chilwell in a Deadline Day loan..\nIn\nOut\nEverton\nEverton were never going to spend big this winter, but they did get an attacking reinforcement in before the deadline. Former Southampton playmaker Charly Alcaraz signed from Flamengo.\nOut\nFulham\nFulham managed to keep star left-back Antonee Robinson this winter, with the United States international linked with the Premier League's giants. Willian has re-joined the club as a free agent.\nIn\nOut\nIpswich Town\nIpswich Town have recruited in a bid to retain their Premier League status. They signed former Everton defender Ben Godfrey and Brighton forward Julio Enciso on loan, as well as Aston Villa winger Jaden Philogene on a permanent deal.\nIn\nOut\nLeicester City\nLeicester City face a serious fight against relegation and their threadbare squad needed desperate improvements. Parma right-back Woyo Coulibaly was their only signing of the window, however.\nIn\nOut\nLiverpool\nLiverpool were quiet over the summer and didn't make any signings in January. They will now prioritise contract discussions with Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold, all of whom are able to agree pre-contracts with foreign clubs.\nIn\nOut\nManchester City\nManchester City's disappointing first half of the season and a significant long-term injury to linchpin Rodri mean that Pep Guardiola has been gifted new players in January. The Cityzens have signed two defenders in Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis, while Omar Marmoush is an exciting forward addition for £59m. Nico Gonzalez joined up on deadline day.\nIn\nOut\nManchester United\nRuben Amorim oversaw his first transfer window as Manchester United manager but hasn't been able to massively rejuvenate the Red Devils squad. The exit of Marcus Rashford freed room for the Portuguese coach in attack, but no additions to the frontline were made.\nPatrick Dorgu is in, after signing from Lecce on a five-and-a-half-year contract, while the acquisition of Ayden Heaven is one for the long-term.\nIn\nOut\nNewcastle United\nNewcastle United were one of three Premier League clubs not to make a single January signing. However, they'll have Alexander Isak for another six months at least, with Miguel Almiron the most notable departure.\nIn\nOut\nNottingham Forest\nFollowing a truly remarkable first half of the 2024/25 season, Nottingham Forest had no obvious need to dip into the market.\nIn\nOut\nSouthampton\nNew Southampton manager Ivan Juric needed additions in January for Southampton to have any hope of producing a miracle and avoiding the drop. Full-back Welington finally teamed up with the Saints after signing a contract in the summer, youngster Joachim Kayi Sanda has arrived on the south coast and midfielder Albert Gronbaek joined on loan.\nIn\nOut\nTottenham Hotspur\nInjuries meant that Ange Postecoglou's underperforming side had to be reinforced in January. Tottenham signed young goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky from Slavia Prague following a long-term injury to Guglielmo Vicario, and have picked up Kevin Danso from Lens on a loan deal with an obilgation to buy,\nMathys Tel was an exciting Deadline Day addition from Bayern Munich.\nIn\nOut\nWest Ham United\nWest Ham United spent big over the summer but their new recruits have struggled in the capital. With long-term injuries to Michail Antonio and Niclas Fullkrug, the Irons signed Evan Ferguson on loan.\nIn\nOut\nWolverhampton Wanderers\nNew Wolverhampton Wanderers boss Vitor Pereira was granted new signings in January, and the West Midlanders crucially bolstered their defence with three new signings.",
