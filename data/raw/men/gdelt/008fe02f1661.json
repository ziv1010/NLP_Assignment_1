  "body_text": "New-Look Champions League Produces Jeopardy, But Giants Survive\n\"It's nice to have a bit more jeopardy,\" Real Madrid's English superstar Jude Bellingham told UEFA after the reigning champions rounded out the league phase with a 3-0 win against Brest in France.\nHe was not referring to that particular game, one of 18 played simultaneously on the eighth and last matchday, a frenzied night which saw a total of 64 goals fly in around Europe, including one for Bellingham himself.\nIt was rather a reference to the fact that the new format -- with all 36 clubs playing eight games against eight different opponents -- took some getting used to for every club, even the biggest fishes.\nMadrid were themselves caught out as they lost three of their first five matches. Manchester City certainly faced jeopardy as the competition's winners in 2023 needed to win their last game at home to Club Brugge in order to avoid elimination, and found themselves 1-0 down at half-time.\nThey came back to win 3-1 to avoid humiliation and reach the knockout round play-offs, and Club Brugge also went through.\nUefa introduced this new format to replace the group system which had been in place for two decades, doing so in response to the threat of a breakaway Super League involving a select band of giant clubs.\nEuropean football's governing body is now beating its chest about the success of the new format in \"delivering on its promise to reinvigorate\" a competition which had gone slightly stale in the group stage.\nOnly two clubs came into the final matchday having secured direct qualification for the last 16, without having to go through the play-offs.\nOnly nine had been eliminated, leaving 25 with something to play for in their last game.\nIt has naturally been hailed by clubs who may have struggled under the previous system, most notably Brest, who finished 18th and have reached the play-offs in their debut European campaign.\n\"I really like it, and I think tonight the people watching on television and in the stadiums must have really enjoyed it. There was a lot of suspense. It gives a chance to the smaller teams like us,\" said Brest coach Eric Roy.\nAnother French side, Lille, pulled off a remarkable performance to finish seventh and go directly into the last 16, beating Real and Atletico Madrid along the way.\n\"I have really liked this format. There is room for surprises,\" said Lille's Thomas Meunier.\nIn contrast, Real coach Carlo Ancelotti has not hidden his displeasure at the increase in the number of games in the league phase, to eight from six in the old format.\n\"My idea of football is that we must reduce the number of matches to diminish the impact on the players,\" Ancelotti said.\nOne leading player at a leading European club who asked not be identified shared that view, saying the new system might be exciting for fans but that it takes its physical toll.\n\"I'd prefer less games to be honest,\" was that player's frank assessment.\nThere will be even less opportunity to rest for those clubs who must now come through a two-legged play-off tie in February to reach the last 16.\nBut there will be plenty of excitement in the play-offs, the draw for which takes place on Friday.\nThe way the draw is organised means Real and Bayern Munich each know they will either face Manchester City or Celtic next. AC Milan could play Juventus.\nNevertheless, the new format ultimately produced the same end result.\nAll of the top eight who progress straight to the last 16 hail from Europe's five biggest leagues, with three from England, two from Spain, and one each from Italy, Germany and France.\nOnly six clubs from other countries have reached the play-offs, all of a certain pedigree: former European Cup winners in PSV Eindhoven, Benfica, Feyenoord and Celtic, former runners-up in Club Brugge, and Portuguese giants Sporting.\nNo club from east of Munich has progressed, and the only club who were probably expected to qualify but failed to do so were RB Leipzig, although they were hampered by injuries and had a difficult draw -- their opponents amassed more points combined than those of any other team.\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
