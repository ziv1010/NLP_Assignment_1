That they have done it despite a backdrop of controversy off the field is even more remarkable.\n'My family has suffered'\nA feud between Spain's players and Vilda last year almost derailed their World Cup campaign before it began, when the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) claimed 15 members of its national team said they would resign if he did not step down.\nThat was denied by the players, but a stand-off ensued amid reports of concern over training methods and inadequate game preparation.\nSpain's federation backed Vilda, who froze out the 15 from his squad before welcoming three of them back for the World Cup.\nThat trio - forward Mariona Caldentey, midfielder Bonmati and defender Ona Batlle - started Tuesday's semi-final before Spain moved one win from World Cup glory.\nAmong those who have not returned are several star players for Champions League winners Barcelona, including midfielder Patri Guijarro, defender Mapi Leon, forward Claudia Pina and goalkeeper Sandra Panos.\nVilda, who has been in charge since 2015, said: \"Once again, I value my players a lot. The end result is a learning process which has made us all stronger.\"\nLast September, Vilda said: \"I wouldn't wish what I'm going through on anyone. I'm with those players who want to be part of this national team.\"\nAfter seeing his side defeat Sweden, Vilda said his family had \"suffered this year\".\n\"The first thing that goes through your head after winning is you think about loved ones and everything that has happened this year,\" he added.\n\"The support of [RFEF president] Luis Rubiales and everyone at the federation means so much and will always stay with me, as well as that of my family because they have suffered this year.\n\"Now we can file it away and put it behind us and think about the future, and think that we deserve to be where we are.\"\n'These scenes are phenomenal'\nSpain, who are sixth in Fifa's world rankings, now await the winner of the second semi-final between Australia and European champions England which takes place on Wednesday (11:00 BST).\nTuesday's match was drifting towards extra time before substitute Salma Paralluelo put Spain ahead with nine minutes remaining.\nIn a dramatic finish, Sweden equalised through Rebecka Blomqvist's 88th-minute goal, only for captain Olga Carmona to produce a stunning winner 93 seconds later.\n\"It's surprising because with all of what's gone on Spain have shown a togetherness here that they have never shown in tournament football,\" added Williams.\n\"These scenes are phenomenal. To think that Spain left so many of their first-team players at home. It's crazy.\"\n'One step from glory'\nAt the age of 19, Paralluelo had made a real impact coming off the bench to follow up her extra-time winner in the quarter-final against the Netherlands with Spain's first against Sweden.\n\"It was a very tough game. It could have been difficult to recover from their goal, but we've shown that this team can deal with anything,\" said Paralluelo, who became the second teenager to score in a Women's World Cup semi-final, after Kara Lang at the age of 16 for Canada in 2003.\n\"All of us are extremely proud of everything we have done. We're just one step away from glory. We took this little step, and now we need that final push.\"\nGoalkeeper Cata Coll made two important saves against Sweden, including one to deny her Barcelona team-mate Fridolina Rolfo.\nColl, 22, only made her senior Spain debut in the last-16 win over Switzerland on 5 August, replacing first choice Misa Rodriguez. Coll is now set to appear in the World Cup final.\n\"We now have three excellent keepers of a very high level,\" said Vilda. \"It is something the Spanish team were hoping to have.\"\nA family home turns into a house of horrors: Watch the chilling crime thriller, Wolf, from the makers of Inside Man and Sherlock\nWill the faithfuls unmask the traitors? 24 Aussies take on the ultimate game of trust and treachery",
