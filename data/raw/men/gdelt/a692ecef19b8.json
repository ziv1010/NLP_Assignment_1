  "body_text": "No wonder Callum Wilson was once again “frustrated” not to claim the match ball.\nThere may have been another match-winning double for the striker, his second brace inside four days and ninth for Newcastle United, but a first hat-trick at the club remains elusive. The lack of a third goal may even cost Wilson a starting place against Arsenal given he was dropped after (only) scoring twice at Goodison Park on Thursday.\nAdvertisement\nThe 31-year-old may have been “exceptional” in Eddie Howe’s view, “completely changing the game” as a half-time substitute in the 3-1 win against Southampton, just as he did against Brentford, but it is the threat of Alexander Isak assuming Wilson’s undisputed position as first-choice centre-forward that is really driving him on.\n“Things are going well, competition helps, drives and motivates you to not get complacent,” Wilson told BBC Sport. “I’ve got 15 goals but feel like I should be on more. Everybody wants to be starting.”\nAs Dan Burn stresses, Wilson “will be angry” at losing his starting position. The striker is refusing to accept the “super sub” tag bestowed upon him and is determined to usurp Isak and reclaim his starting position.\nYet, as many supporters are increasingly calling for, Howe has the tantalising prospect of starting Wilson and Isak together for the first time.\n— Terence Driscoll (@terencedriscoll) April 30, 2023\nThe duo showed away to Brentford that they could play as a striker-and-No-10 combination. Then at Everton, there were glimpses of a striker-and-left-sided-forward pairing in the making — and the latter was on display during this 3-1 comeback victory over Southampton.\nUntil Anthony Gordon, hooked at half-time, proves he warrants a starting place and Allan Saint-Maximin returns to fitness, fielding Newcastle’s combined-25-goal strikers together in some capacity must be tempting for Howe.\nThe head coach’s ruthless decision-making has ensured Newcastle are storming towards the Champions League, gaining in strength as the season progresses rather than fading as many expected. It is now eight wins in nine games, nine points in eight days. With five games to go, third-placed Newcastle are nine points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool.\nAdvertisement\nThe hard-nosed edge that Howe possesses, beneath that “nice guy Eddie” exterior, may yet extract far more from Gordon, just as it has from Wilson.\nBefore the March international break, Wilson had only scored seven goals all season and just one in his past 14 games. He looked jaded, lacking physicality and mobility following the Qatar World Cup and there were questions about his longevity.\n“A World Cup in the middle of the season is unusual and a lot of players’ form dipped, mine included,” Kieran Trippier said. “The international break was a good time for him to reflect and rest.”\nIn seven games since, Wilson has scored eight goals at a rate of one every 38.6 minutes, including four as a replacement (the most in the top flight all season) and has provided an assist. He has surpassed Alan Shearer’s Newcastle record of seven Premier League goals in a calendar month and has joined Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling as only the third Englishman to manage eight in a month.\n8 – Callum Wilson has scored eight Premier League goals this April, now the most by a player in a single calendar month for Newcastle in the competition, surpassing Alan Shearer’s best of seven in September 1999.

While Ba (and Papiss Cisse) secured Europa League football, Wilson — and Isak — appear set to deliver Champions League qualification.\nThat Dubai break was “exactly what Wilson needed”, according to Howe, following a series of illnesses and niggling fitness problems. It gave the striker significant time to rest and crucial time on the training pitch, building up his durability. “It was a mental break for him,” says Burn. “Alex coming back to fitness has pushed him as well. It’s good to have them pushing each other every week.”\nAdvertisement\nSince then, Wilson has appeared revitalised, bullying defenders at every opportunity and being the general nuisance in the box that had been his trademark.\nHis introduction transformed the match on Sunday. Newcastle were lethargic and wasteful during the first half. Gordon, in particular, missed two golden opportunities on his full home debut, including a one-on-one that he lashed onto the left-hand post and his confidence visibly drained away. Although Howe was keen to stress the winger was merely “sacrificed” to accommodate Wilson, it was unsurprising Gordon was once again withdrawn early.\nNewcastle did not manage a shot on target until the 53rd minute despite repeatedly exploiting Lyanco’s positioning. They had just five efforts on goal during the first half, with an expected goals (xG) return of 0.61 suggesting they were not creating high-quality chances. As a centre-half playing at right-back, Newcastle created so many openings by playing passes into the space behind Lyanco.\nMoving Isak to Lyanco’s flank following the Sweden forward’s sublime midweek “assist” made complete sense. It meant Wilson could bring physicality through the middle and Isak could be direct. “Alex made a big difference out wide,” Burn says. “They’ve complemented each other really well when they’ve played together.”\nIsak did not manage a shot throughout and only had two touches inside the opposition box, with nine Newcastle players, including Sven Botman and Fabian Schar (both three touches), managing more.\nWilson, meanwhile, produced six efforts at goal, including three on target and hitting the woodwork, had 10 touches inside the penalty area, scored twice and had another goal disallowed for offside. Despite being on for only 45 minutes, Wilson had an xG of 2.37, his highest of the campaign, and Newcastle’s second-half xG as a team was 3.86.\nSeemingly, Howe is developing a knack for match-defining alterations. A substitute has scored during all five of Newcastle’s top-flight victories at home in 2023, with Wilson doing so during three separate outings. “You need players to come off the bench and impact the game,” Trippier said. “The subs have been unbelievable.”\nAs Wilson stressed: “All you can do is put the ball in the net when you get the opportunity.”\nBut will that be as a starter or a substitute next Sunday?\nThe fact that is even a question is precisely why Wilson is in such blistering form and why the Champions League beckons.\n(Top photo: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United via Getty Images)",
