  "body_text": "Barcelona manager Hansi Flick did not hold back on his criticism of the decision to leave Raphinha out of the recently announced FIFA The Best World XI.\n‘Decision is a joke’ - Hansi Flick hits out at Raphinha’s FIFA The Best snub after brilliant season for Barcelona\nThe coach did not hold back\nTwo Barça players did make the final cut as Lamine Yamal and Pedri were included in the XI, but the absence of Raphinha was notable despite the Brazilian’s incredible contributions, especially in the Champions League, and Flick called the decision “unbelievable” and “a joke”.\n“For me, it’s unbelievable. It’s not a big deal because I don’t think much about the best eleven, but FIFA’s decision is a joke. When I saw that Raphinha wasn’t on it, it was incredible. He was very important for us last season. He made 22 goal contributions in the Champions League, in the top competition. If you look at the goals and assists and his influence, it was incredible. It’s not fair to him. It’s a joke. I can’t believe he’s not in the best eleven in the world. After the season, he deserves it. It’s unbelievable.”\nYou can easily argue that no player in Hansi Flick’s career as a manager has made as big of a jump from good player to superstar as Raphinha did, and the Brazilian has a very special relationship with Flick that is clearly reciprocated.\nAnd regardless of what FIFA or France Football think, the streets will truly never forget that Raphinha was the best player in the world in the 2024-25 season.",
