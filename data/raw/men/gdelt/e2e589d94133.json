Will cost similar to Anzou.\n3 Posted 28/07/2025 at 13:15:19\nCalvert-Lewin linked to Man Utd, Aston Villa and AC Milan.\n4 Posted 28/07/2025 at 14:27:10\n5 Posted 28/07/2025 at 14:40:48\n6 Posted 28/07/2025 at 14:43:33\n7 Posted 28/07/2025 at 14:48:52\n8 Posted 28/07/2025 at 14:51:53\nCould all be rubbish but that's what I've read.\n9 Posted 28/07/2025 at 14:53:54\nIt's no wonder we can't sign players with this much procrastination. If we really want a player, pay the piper and stop wasting time and valuable preparation for the new season.\n10 Posted 28/07/2025 at 15:01:42\nI think the reason we want a loan deal is only the wages will be included in PSR rating, whereas if we were to buy, the buying price goes straight on the PSR for this year.\nAlso, with Moyes saying he wants another 6 players, we have to be careful we don't go over our PSR this year. As Newcastle are finding out, you can have all the money in the world but, because of PSR, they can't spend what they would like to.\n11 Posted 28/07/2025 at 17:24:26\n[@markmcadamtv, @SkySportsNews]\n12 Posted 28/07/2025 at 17:46:36\n13 Posted 28/07/2025 at 18:02:31\n14 Posted 28/07/2025 at 20:25:34\nPersonally, I'd be more excited by Fofana who I reckon could do as well as Grealish now and will be comfortably the more valuable player in 2 or 3 years time.\n15 Posted 28/07/2025 at 20:36:06\nFair assessment. The other complications are that apparently (Bobble rumour), we are interested in a loan, whereas Man City might want a permanent transfer.\nAlso, other clubs interested.\n16 Posted 28/07/2025 at 20:48:55\nIf they can pull that off, then credit to them. Personally, I suspect they're trying hard to get Gallagher in that way too.\n17 Posted 28/07/2025 at 21:18:29\n18 Posted 28/07/2025 at 21:36:55\n19 Posted 28/07/2025 at 21:44:43\n20 Posted 28/07/2025 at 22:11:06\nIt's his Andy van der Meyde antics off the pitch that have blotted his career.\n21 Posted 28/07/2025 at 22:13:03\n22 Posted 28/07/2025 at 22:32:46\n23 Posted 28/07/2025 at 22:34:28\nGrealish!! Heart says Yes, Head says No. We've been down this road before with the likes of Alli.\nBut, the older-than-me generation will say Reid and Gray turned out alright.\n24 Posted 28/07/2025 at 22:40:59\nIf a footballer is going to excel, then he has got to be played in his proper position.\nJesper Lindstrøm was never played in his proper position!\n25 Posted 28/07/2025 at 22:41:48\nHe will never be “prime Grealish” again but he could still be fun and reasonably productive on loan.\n26 Posted 28/07/2025 at 22:53:12\nHe'll also be great for merch sales too.\n27 Posted 28/07/2025 at 22:57:35\nNew owners… but on the transfer front, it certainly is looking very much like same old Everton!\n28 Posted 28/07/2025 at 23:12:25\n29 Posted 29/07/2025 at 02:54:25\nOnly gut feel that tells me he won't fit in.\n30 Posted 29/07/2025 at 04:35:06\n31 Posted 29/07/2025 at 06:41:31\nPlus his availability has always been an issue and I'm not sure he's ever managed more than 25 games in a Premier League season. Perhaps a loan deal could work but I'd be nervous of committing heavy financial resources to a player whose trajectory is unclear. I'd be far more excited about Fofana or another young talent with potential to become the next Grealish.\nI'd be more excited about him if he played off the right. Strange that the two strongest links of last few days are left-wingers! Who will we get to play on the right flank that has been our Achilles Heel for years?!\n32 Posted 29/07/2025 at 07:06:55\nThat's his motivation to play his socks off, even if it's only on a season loan.\n33 Posted 29/07/2025 at 07:14:51\nA lot of competition for those forward slots. I'm not set against it but, depending on what the deal is, it could be quite risky.\n34 Posted 29/07/2025 at 07:36:16\nThose things can be overcome if the player has something to prove, gets his head down and play football. If his motive is to get back into Tuchel's plans and he wants to use Everton as a means to achieve that, then I'm personally okay with that.\nIt felt like he went from being the superstar at Aston Villa to becoming small fry within Man City's vast squad and missing out on a lot of playing time. Maybe in hindsight, and what Villa achieved, he would have been better off staying?\nAnother right-footed player who likes to play left and cut in. This is becoming increasingly common on both flanks. It has been for years.\nAnyway, it's still all rumour and talk, so let's see what happens. We have no control.\nI agree on the Lindstrøm comments, both in terms of keeping him if the option was available and using him in his correct position. A flying winger he isn't. There are few in the game now. The Bundesliga might suit his game better.\n35 Posted 29/07/2025 at 07:40:27\nI'm not against a loan, by the way – but there's a reason why Grealish's likely destinations include Everton and West Ham.\n36 Posted 29/07/2025 at 08:02:51\n37 Posted 29/07/2025 at 08:04:59\nAt Aston Villa, he played mainly down the left but had freedom to roam. Under Pep's robotic system, he was mainly used as a winger whose main function seemed to be to pick up fouls as soon as he came close to the opponent's box.\nI'm not a huge fan but he's a name which would make us more attractive to some prospective players. Like Richarlison, he goes down far too easy for my liking.\n38 Posted 29/07/2025 at 08:31:13\nSo, my theory is that, if it's Grealish, then we will drop interest in Fofana and buy Fellows, letting him battle it out with McNeil for the right-midfield berth. Then Ndiaye and Alcaraz to compete for the No 10 slot. This solution should free up the money to spend on an a right-back and a central midfielder.\nI'd be happy with either of those outcomes, though only a loan for Grealish; I think he would do well here but personally i'd rather buy Fofana, we need pace.\n39 Posted 29/07/2025 at 08:43:03\nGuardiola's tactics seemed okay for the likes of Messi, Iniesta, Neymar, De Bruyne, Mahrez etc etc. if Grealish couldn't flourish at Man City, that's on him.\nI'm not sure Moyes is all about flamboyance and freedom either.\nLike I say, I think it could be a fun and productive loan signing… but prime Grealish – the one who commanded a £100M fee – is realistically a thing of the past.\n40 Posted 29/07/2025 at 08:52:03\nBut I will make a case for the defence. Grealish and Richarlison are both quick players. When moving at pace, it only takes the slightest clip to knock them off balance.\nOf course players will go down if they feel the touch. A foul is a foul.\nAshley Young got victimised for it against Manchester United last season. Maybe he did try to make it obvious, but he was still fouled and it was a penalty.\nGoing back, Andy Johnson got labelled once Mourinho called it in front of his Sky disciples and the officials followed suit. He wasn't a diver, he was just too quick for clumsy defenders. But once he got branded, he rarely got a decision.\n41 Posted 29/07/2025 at 09:03:37\nAlthough allegedly more financially sound with TFG backing, we still need to be careful with what we spend and where we spend it, being conscious of PSR conditions.\nClass player though he is, could we spend the money more wisely? Just asking.\n42 Posted 29/07/2025 at 09:06:06\n43 Posted 29/07/2025 at 09:09:22\nOf course it's possible he wasn't offered a new deal at Everton.\n44 Posted 29/07/2025 at 09:10:42\nSorry, it's Grealish all day long for me. Shirt sales would go through the roof, an ambitious signing that might encourage other players to sign for us. I'd love Grealish here.\n45 Posted 29/07/2025 at 09:18:31\nBut going down under even minimal contact when moving at pace is sometimes unavoidable. It's momentum.\n46 Posted 29/07/2025 at 09:20:13\nThe lad was a Blue, but the young woman had no interest in the game and only came to life when Jack Grealish warmed up and she just kept taking zoomed in pictures of him.\n47 Posted 29/07/2025 at 09:28:50\n48 Posted 29/07/2025 at 09:28:55\nNow, when a player does the same thing, he his no longer considered soft, because they all do it now, since cheating became acceptable.\nIt's very off-putting and is the main reason I have just enjoyed watching quite a few games in the women's tournament much more than I enjoy watching a lot of men's football now.\nThe men are obviously so much better but, because they are also light years ahead when it comes to cheating, it often spoils the game.\n49 Posted 29/07/2025 at 09:48:44\nMichelle Agyemang can testify to that.\n50 Posted 29/07/2025 at 09:49:44\n\"He drew the foul\", \"He was entitled to go down there\" ...I mean what the feck does that even mean???\n\"He really could have gone down there instead of staying on his feet.\" It really is a shit sport!\n55 Posted 29/07/2025 at 12:50:24\n89 Posted 29/07/2025 at 13:14:02\nHe played 20 league games most seasons for Man City because Guardiola didn't pick him. He averaged 34 games a season for them.\nHe will likely choose West Ham, as he loves a night out. Probably for the best as he would make the rest of the squad look bad.\n90 Posted 29/07/2025 at 13:32:54\nThe Aussie going down last week holding his head, shows the win-at-all-costs mentality entering that sport as well.\n91 Posted 29/07/2025 at 14:15:19\nAs you said, our Dwight, trundling along and pumping balls to no one in particular just deflates everyone. To see some real skill and some assists would be a novelty.\n92 Posted 29/07/2025 at 14:22:30\nI haven't watched MotD for years, Allan, but I did put it on one Sunday morning not so long ago. Never again, I thought, whilst I was watching, because this is a programme that definitely seems to concentrate on the controversy rather than the finer elements of the game.\nI was gutted I forgot about the rugby, Ian, because I love the way they are all just so committed and the way everyone respects the referee. If cheating enters that sport, it might end up being catastrophic on so many levels.\nCheating = a total lack of respect for your sport and for your opponent. Even though it has become universally accepted by many, it's not something I can personally respect myself.\nI know I yearn for Everton to possess hard-nosed, complete and ultra professionalism more than anything else, so I suppose I'm contradicting myself when I say I'd take no satisfaction in winning by cheating… but I think I've got the sense and the grace, to know the difference between the two.\nUnless it's against the 'outraged at everything but ashamed of nothing' crew!\n93 Posted 29/07/2025 at 14:41:52\nSad times.\n94 Posted 29/07/2025 at 15:01:22\n95 Posted 29/07/2025 at 15:12:48\nAs him being stuck there looms nearer, they'll be happy to take anything to get shut. Personally, I'd steer clear.\n96 Posted 29/07/2025 at 16:12:36\nWell, as far as Jack the lad goes, just say no! Not even on a free and Man City pay half his wages. He's lazy, unproductive, a one-trick pony, and his one trick isn't very good.\nHe is a busted flush, not fit for purpose, over rated, in fact I can't think of one positive he would bring to us. West Ham and Napoli are after him, so I don't think we need to worry too much about another, past his sell-by date, been there, done it player, coming to us on a high wage with little return and no sell on.\nJust say no, Moyes, please.\n97 Posted 29/07/2025 at 16:39:34\nWho has taken over your account?\n98 Posted 29/07/2025 at 17:00:29\nMy excuse is I support Everton, I've been in a mood for years. But I am a habitual moaner, my moans lighten TW up, methinks.\nBut I stand by my Grealish comments, no touch.\n99 Posted 29/07/2025 at 17:12:20\nI think he would be a revelation, and at his age, he wants to prove everyone wrong and make the World Cup squad, but it's probably down to wages now.\n100 Posted 29/07/2025 at 17:23:50\n101 Posted 29/07/2025 at 17:26:25\nAt the top of his game, he would be the best player by a country mile. He would solve some of the creativity issues in the side, but we would still need to upgrade the pace in the side. Jack could release a Fofana or Kubo type.\nWould add a bit of a fight for the XI to Alcaraz. But no bad thing.\n102 Posted 29/07/2025 at 17:30:34\nI have had stripes down my back that resembled a zebra. It was always about seeing how much you could get away with. Get your retaliation in first. I enjoyed it.\n103 Posted 29/07/2025 at 21:33:03\n104 Posted 30/07/2025 at 13:45:02\nIt's obvious to me that the current squad will not survive in the Premier League without key areas being filled.\nIt looks as though he doesn't fancy Tom Fellows on the right, and any Championship player in the middle either \"if\" you believe the media and who we have supposedly been in for.\nTime is indeed running out and will we be feeding off scraps come deadline day?\nThe thought of being relegated in our first season at the HDS is a nightmare scenario.\nAn interesting few weeks ahead and the purse strings have to be loosened if that's the reason we're not putting enough on the table?\n105 Posted 01/08/2025 at 00:52:59\n106 Posted 01/08/2025 at 00:54:58\n107 Posted 01/08/2025 at 01:15:56\n108 Posted 01/08/2025 at 02:28:45\n109 Posted 01/08/2025 at 06:44:52\nHe will not go for £40M, but they have time on their side to wait until it is closer than £27M.\n110 Posted 01/08/2025 at 06:56:41\n111 Posted 01/08/2025 at 07:02:38\nIf you want these players, get serious. Is the plan to take this to the wire only to fail at the last minute and say, “ oh we tried, but couldn’t get it over the line”?\nTime is running out. The three above mentioned are coveted by other clubs. No one is going to wait for the mighty Everton to make a move. None of these players are desperate to play for Everton. David Moyes is no Carlo Ancellotti. We are not a major player on the world stage.\nGetting fucking real and either go for unknown talents or make a fucking move. With any of these.\n112 Posted 01/08/2025 at 07:26:02\n113 Posted 01/08/2025 at 07:29:44\n114 Posted 01/08/2025 at 07:33:42\nAt this rate we’ll end up getting bang average players like Coufal, Soucek, Maitland-Niles, Ndidi etc….on the final day, with seconds to spare.\nI’m not saying we should go mad and pay exorbitant fees/wages but this is the world we live in. There are many clubs out there who in order to survive will outbid us while we try and save a few quid dithering.\nRobert, managers like Ancellotti attract the best players.\n115 Posted 01/08/2025 at 07:51:13\n116 Posted 01/08/2025 at 08:01:37\nIf Soton value Dibling at 40 million, it makes little sense to present a bid of 27 million (22% below their valuation). We must have been aware of their valuation before we submitted the bid.\nLow bids only aggravate the seller and make the negotiations harder. We had a similar experience with Man Utd's bids for Jarrad last summer and we all know how that ended.\nIf 25-30 million is the upper ceiling for a right winger this summer, we need to look elsewhere quickly. It is these tactics that are probably annoying Moyes and wasting precious weeks of the summer window.\n117 Posted 01/08/2025 at 08:22:11\n118 Posted 01/08/2025 at 08:24:45\nEvertons decades old transfer shitstem policy is unbreakable.\nThe dead one lives on\n119 Posted 01/08/2025 at 08:33:00\n120 Posted 01/08/2025 at 08:41:13\nThere is a happy coincidence that the world's best managers tend to preside over the world's richest clubs.\nRemove the rich club budget and the manager suddenly loses his sex appeal. I don't remember Louis Van Gaal attracting any major players when he chose a spell at AZ Alkmaar.\nI do remember Robinho going to play for Mark Hughes however. And an increasing number of quality players living the dream under nobody managers out in Saudi.\nI know many fans hate the implication that money is the biggest difference maker… but it is. Almost all of the foreign players in the Premier League wouldn't be here if we didn't pay such high wages.\nBarry has just given up Champions League football under a very well respected manager to play for us – all for a pay rise. It's how it works.\n121 Posted 01/08/2025 at 09:06:14\n122 Posted 01/08/2025 at 09:16:29\n123 Posted 01/08/2025 at 09:19:59\n124 Posted 01/08/2025 at 09:41:29\nBasis that, the starting bid would be £30-£32M.\n125 Posted 01/08/2025 at 09:45:32\nSo we need to cough up if we want him.\n126 Posted 01/08/2025 at 10:14:52\nLoan with obligation to buy next season.\n127 Posted 01/08/2025 at 11:10:06\n128 Posted 01/08/2025 at 11:19:45\n129 Posted 01/08/2025 at 11:27:34\nWrexham are getting a very good player with a footballing brain but will have to watch for the many injuries Nathan has had in his football career with each of his clubs while scoring quite a few goals for them.\n130 Posted 01/08/2025 at 15:48:57\n132 Posted 01/08/2025 at 16:00:41\nDibling and his agency are keen on him joining Everton;\nKubo too expensive;\nBakayoko wasn't interested;\nStill trying for Fofana but he isn't convinced to join;\nWe want Grealish, total cost of £8-10M... Man City happy to wait to see if anything else happens;\nLuiz wants European football and closest to joining Forest. agent is close to their owner.\nMcAtee, Man City had him priced ~£25M but it has gone up based on the proposed Tottenham deal for Gibbs-White. No club has a deal in place for him yet.\n133 Posted 01/08/2025 at 16:28:10\n134 Posted 01/08/2025 at 17:16:15\nRelease clause expires tomorrow, I think… move, Arsenal, move.\n135 Posted 01/08/2025 at 22:12:19\nRight-winger\n- Dibling\n- Hutchinson\n- Kubo\nAttacking midfielder:\n- Grealish (loan)\n- El Khanouss\n- McAtee\nCentre-midfielder:\n- Gallagher\n- Soucek\n- AN Other not yet linked\nRight back:\n- Rensch (loan)\n- Coufal\n- AN Other not yet linked\nCome on, Everton, start landing these deals!\n136 Posted 01/08/2025 at 22:19:56\n137 Posted 01/08/2025 at 22:23:33\nAnd we already got the young lad Dodds from Hearts.\n138 Posted 01/08/2025 at 22:28:12\nDouglas Luiz, loan to buy\nFofana\nGrealish, loan\nChelsea squad player Andrey Santos, Essuggo,\n139 Posted 01/08/2025 at 22:31:16\n140 Posted 01/08/2025 at 22:33:58\n141 Posted 01/08/2025 at 22:47:24\nMeant to say it a few times...\nCame on to ToffeeWeb a million years ago...hoping for a poster like you.\nYou are perceptive, knowledgeable, diplomatic, persuasive, balanced and fair.\nIt's like looking in a mirror!\nObviously the last bit was an attempt at humour but I do hold Robert in the highest regard.\n142 Posted 01/08/2025 at 22:59:45\nA Liverpool fan walks into a library and says, \"Hi! I'd like a hamburger, large fries, and a Coke.\"\nThe librarian replies, 'Sir, this is a library.'\nThe red says, \"Oh for fuck's sake!\" He then leans toward the librarian grabs him by the collar, nuts him and whispers, 'I'd like to order a hamburger, a large fries and a Coke.\" 😁\n143 Posted 01/08/2025 at 23:03:32\nI'm not everyone's cup of tea. But we all want the same thing really don't we?\n144 Posted 01/08/2025 at 23:07:03\nI wasn't sure of the injury status with only 1 centre-back available for the Bournemouth game.\n145 Posted 01/08/2025 at 23:08:48\nCurrently in Orlando airport when I laughed out loud. Probably all think I am a crazy pissed up Brit! As if ….\n146 Posted 01/08/2025 at 23:19:10\nTwo days late, but better late than never! 😂😂😂\n147 Posted 01/08/2025 at 23:30:33\nHere's another one.\nWhy is it terrible to be a penis? Because your nearest neighbor is an asshole, your two best friends are nuts, and you throw up when you get excited.😁\n148 Posted 01/08/2025 at 23:57:24\nAll motivation is very much welcome, particularly the alcohol variety.\n149 Posted 01/08/2025 at 23:59:05\nIn the early '70s, wrestling was dominated by a Chinese superstar named Ho Chi whose match-winning move was the \"Ho-Chi Min\" grip. Once he got an opponent in that hold... the fight was over.\nSo dominant was he that no-one would fight him, so his management team put a call out, a la Rocky for any contender to step up. Dandy Crooks from Belfast got the gig.\nRound 1... pretty even.\nRound 2... Dandy was caught in the \"Ho Chi Min\" grip! And then, within a few seconds from a submission... there was a tremendous roar and Ho Chi was flung out of the ring and Dandy declared the winner!\nThat night on \"Scene Around Six\"... Dandy was being interviewed by Lesley Dawes: \"So Dandy… the Ho Chi Min grip — how did you get out of it?\"\n\"Well, Lesley,\" says Dandy, \"I was wrapped up so much, I couldn't move… and then I saw this big pair of hairy balls dangling... so I sunk my teeth into them!\"\n\"So Dandy\" asked Lesley... \"that's how you got out of the Ho Chi Min grip?\"\nDandy says, \"You bite your own balls... you'll get out of anything!\"\n150 Posted 02/08/2025 at 00:02:15\n151 Posted 02/08/2025 at 00:30:32\nGreat wrestler though he was Dandy Crooks had a terrible speech impediment.\nBack in the '70s, there was a very famous oil-rig firefighter named Red Adair. He came to Belfast once and was spotted drinking in the Crown Bar by Dandy and his mates.\n\"Look,\" said Dandy's mates in awe... \"there's Red Adair sitting at the bar!\"\nIt was Dandy's round next and he found himself standing at the bar next to Red Adair.\nDandy: \"Are you Red Adair?\"\nRed \"Hell... yes, I am!\"\nDandy: \"Are you still dancing with Ginger Rogers?\"\n152 Posted 02/08/2025 at 00:41:37\n153 Posted 02/08/2025 at 00:48:30\nHope the flights work out.\n154 Posted 02/08/2025 at 00:49:11\n155 Posted 02/08/2025 at 01:05:50\nBuying from Southampton – who scored less than us last season – is ridiculous.\n156 Posted 02/08/2025 at 01:12:08\nToffeeWebber in distress at the airport and I fecking stepped up\nNot sure what my super power will be but I'll discuss it with the grandchildren in the morning.\n158 Posted 02/08/2025 at 07:07:58\nThe curse continues…\n159 Posted 02/08/2025 at 07:25:23\nMobile phones, tablets, laptops, Microsoft Teams, Zoom.\nOf course negotiations are ongoing. We've signed Aznou while they've been out there. There is still a team back at Finch Farm as well.\nIn this age of technology, it wouldn't matter if they were in the UK. They would still be on pre-season of some form, with business going on in the background.\n160 Posted 02/08/2025 at 07:33:27\nIs it worth getting a youngster who needs ironing out on loan with a buy option? Probably so if the player is good enough though frustrating to do a rival's development work for them.\n161 Posted 02/08/2025 at 07:45:27\nWho sanctioned his move to Everton? That lad has been bad news for years now.\nAnd don't give me any of that “mental health issues” crap.\n162 Posted 02/08/2025 at 07:58:05\nI wouldn't dismiss mental health as crap to be honest, mate. I've had plenty of colleagues who have suffered from it. It's not the days of sticking people in strait-jackets in an asylum or WW1 when they were suffering from what was then called shellshock.\nAnyway, more sad football news this morning. Morecambe suspended from the National League and on the brink of collapse, unless a buyer is found by the end of next week.\nSheffield Wednesday causing concern with the EFL and uncertainty as to whether they can fulfil their first fixture next week over serious financial issues.\n164 Posted 02/08/2025 at 08:56:31\nMorecambe and Sheff Wed must have complied with EFL P&S rules surely! After all they are there to 'protect' all clubs from perilous financial situations, aren't they?\nI know we have done this to death but PSR in the Premier Leaguem and EFL aren't fit for purpose if the likes of Sheffield Wednesday are close to going into administration.\nWith football being tribal, I doubt fans of Blackpool or Sheffield United will be shedding any tears but, looking at the bigger picture, the league have failed both set of fans.\nColin @161, have you got any first hand experience of mental health issues?\nI get you made a flippant comment about Dele Alli but, at the time when Frank signed him, it was a massive gamble with the odds stacked against him making it back to a level he once played at… but that was the market we were or still are in.\nBrandon Williams, the right-back ex-Man Utd player, is available… would you be surprised if we moved for him?\n167 Posted 02/08/2025 at 09:28:46\nThe odds against Dele Alli coming good were massive, so you wouldn't gamble over £12M on that deal!\n168 Posted 02/08/2025 at 09:45:36\nI wasn't against it at the time, in hindsight, it was a terrible mistake. Frank obviously thought he could get a tune out of Dele.\nThe way we are currently shaping up, it won't be the last gamble we take in the transfer market.\nWe just spent £30M on baby Beto.\n170 Posted 02/08/2025 at 10:02:05\nI was against Dele signing at the time, he'd hardly played for Spurs for 12 months. It's ultimately why my gut says no to Grealish. There are parallels – club manager wants him out, out of England picture, off-the-field issues.\nWe should never have signed him, but not sure why anyone wants to bring his mental health and, by association, his awful and abuse-filled upbringing, into it.\n171 Posted 02/08/2025 at 10:32:50\nWith numerous players leaving those clubs, just wondering if there any players there worth taking a punt on, even as squad members...\n173 Posted 02/08/2025 at 10:40:14\n£6M from Leicester; I think he's a right-back.\n174 Posted 02/08/2025 at 10:49:42\nA lot of transfers are gambles and, like you say, we will be taking some this window. Let's hope we win most of them to get our club back on track.\n194 Posted 02/08/2025 at 15:13:11\nIt is an inflation adjusted account of the 2005-06 season transfer window which illustrates what the players we bought then would cost in today's money. It's not my inflation adjustment – it's based on the link Ryan shared and the Transfermarkt transfer prices for each of the players.\nI have converted the Euro Transfermarkt figures to £ based on today's currency exchange rate. I haven't gone back in time to find out what the currency exchange was 20 years ago. I'm not sad...\nAnyway, these are the main players we bought (alongside Neville) in season 2005-06 – and their prices in today's money:\nNeville: £24.86M\nDavies: £25M\nKroldrup: £32.33M\nVan der Meyde: £42.77M\nArteta: £13.2M\nTotal: £138.24M\nI'm not saying this to do Moyes down by the way. He definitely did assemble a very good side (and rebuild it too) during his first stint with us. He also plainly didn't have the resources of the then Rich 6. Many summers came and went with very little investment at all - or practically none.\nps: Happy to admit I was wrong in saying Moyes bought Haller too (I'm not trying to stitch him up). Moyes did also personally unearth and scout many of these players too, showing a greater attention to long-term stability and improvement than many of his peers at the time Ü albeit in a simpler era that preceded the hugely data-driven, professionalised business of player (including youth player) trading and development.\nI think this gives some perspective on how routine a transfer fee of between £20M to £40M now is – and that anything below the £20M mark is really, really cheap in Premier League terms.\nThe Alcaraz deal, for example is very similar to the Arteta deal. Let's hope it's as successful.\nAnd if we get Dibling for about £40M or so, let's hope he's better than Shandy Andy. An extremely talented lad with no baggage so far as I am aware, I think he would make a big difference next season and could become really very exceptional over time.\n197 Posted 02/08/2025 at 15:19:13\nThere's a wonderful profile of Beto on The Athletic that I think everyone should read, and since it's behind a paywall I'm inexcusably posting it here in its entirety.\nFrom playing in car parks and working at KFC to idolising Eto’o and Lukaku\nAmid the swirl of delirium and chaos following Everton’s 2-2 draw against Liverpool in February, one player embarked on an individual lap of honour. Beto scored the opening goal of the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park and an upturn in form under the returning David Moyes imbued the striker with fresh confidence. “To tell you the truth,” says Beto, “I had thought the derby was just (another) game. But within the club, people like Seamus (Coleman) and Tony, the kit man, were saying, ‘You guys need to beat them’. “Playing in that game, I fully understood this. I was like, ‘Wow, this is really good’; the tackles, they go strong, we go strong, they give it to me and I give it to them. I love this — the battle. Now the derby is in my blood. I don’t want to lose any game, but that game — I really don’t want to lose it.” Undefeated in 16 of their final 19 top-flight matches under Moyes last season, Everton owed much to Beto, the 6ft 4in (193cm) forward who had toiled during his first 16 months at the club. Signed under Sean Dyche for an initial fee of £21.5million ($28.5m) in August 2023, Beto scored three Premier League goals in his first season, and he had only one to his name in his second when Moyes took over in January. The 27-year-old says he was on the brink of a move to Italy — only for an injury to Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the win at Brighton on January 25 to force Everton to keep him. From there, Beto scored crucial goals against Leicester City, Liverpool, Crystal Palace and Manchester United as Everton soared to safety. The striker, who Moyes describes as “rough and raucous”, transformed himself into a cult hero. Speaking to The Athletic in a hotel lobby during Everton’s pre-season tour in New York City, Beto reflects, in absorbing detail, on a life and career that has taken him from playing in car parks on the outskirts of Lisbon, via a job at fast-food chain KFC, to a striker in the most competitive league in world football. Beto grew up in the coastal municipality of Cascais, around half an hour’s drive from the Portuguese capital of Lisbon. He describes growing up in a “project” neighbourhood — essentially a form of social housing. “I liked it a lot,” he says. “We didn’t have much; we didn’t have parks or football pitches, but we played two-vs-two, or three-vs-three games in car parks.” He wanted to play locally for a club team as a child, but the costs to register stretched the family’s budget. “For Mum (Filomena), we didn’t have so much money to spend on extra activities. For Mum, football was just a side activity. She preferred school, school, school.” Beto, a Guinea-Bissau international, played football at break time and realised, despite his lack of practice, that his level was higher than many of his peers. His mum relented at the age of nine and he started to play at the weekends. At home, access to the internet and satellite television was rare, meaning he watched very little football. “One day, we were choosing the number of the jersey on my shirt and I didn’t have any role model in football to refer to. “They said, ‘Oh, you’re a striker, you need to wear the No 9 like Samuel Eto’o’. I said, ‘I don’t know (who) Eto’o (is), but, OK, I can be No 9’.” That summer, in 2009, Barcelona played the Champions League final against Man United, and Eto’o scored. “My friend’s family lived on the ground floor of my building and had television access. I was by the window outside watching the game. I saw the goal and Eto’o’s celebration and thought, ‘This is the guy they all told me about’. So I said, ‘OK, let me follow this guy’. He became my idol.” Later, when he bought a mobile phone, he watched video compilations of Eto’o’s goals. He later became inspired by players such as Didier Drogba, Romelu Lukaku and Christian Benteke. He saw in their stories, as Black players who overcame challenging upbringings, a little of himself. “It makes you think, ‘Maybe, just maybe, I can do it, too’. You never know.” Beto’s beginnings in football were not conventional. He spent only one year in an elite academy before being released by Benfica at the age of 14. He then spent two years barely playing before making his start in senior football in the Portuguese amateur leagues. “When I was at Benfica, I didn’t think about being a professional. I was afraid. I could feel and always knew I was not at their level. So when they released me, I said, ‘It’s OK with me. I’m not as good as I thought I was’. It was a reality check. “I spent two years in no man’s land. I was doing stupid stuff — I wasn’t playing, I wasn’t studying… I was thinking I don’t care about the world. My mum took me out from football because I wasn’t behaving well in school. “I have one thing in my mind from Benfica. I asked one guy, ‘Do you think you’re going to be professional?’. He said, ‘Yes, of course’. I was like, ‘F*****g hell, this guy is not afraid’. He said: ‘If I’m not professional here, I will be professional in another place’. I wasn’t thinking like that. I was afraid to say it.” As Beto’s potential career teetered, he threw himself into earning money. He worked at KFC. “It was good. I always wanted to earn my own money. Until I was 15 or 16, I acted spoiled. I tried to have what my friends in school had and I didn’t have the awareness that my mum couldn’t afford things. “My friend would say his dad paid for his driving licence, and I would go home and ask my mum for a driving licence. Now, with time, I see the things that my mum personally went through for me and my sisters. “The first job I did was working in the woodland cutting the weeds. I did one month of work, they paid me €300. Every day, I was happy to go to work because I knew I would have my reward. I gave my mum some of it to help her pay the bills. She wanted me to go through college, but I told her I can’t go. It was too boring. I just didn’t have interest at all. I would go there and want to sleep. I said, ‘No, this is not for me’. One thing was sure; if I was not going to college, I would not be allowed to sit at home. I needed to put money in the house.” Playing amateur football, he would work in the day and train at night, before playing games on a Sunday — his one day off. “Every form of work is good to humble yourself,” he says, recalling the shifts at KFC. Beto played at amateur and lower-league levels for Uniao Tires and Olimpico Montijo before breaking into the top flight with Portimonense. He earned a move to Udinese in Serie A and then Everton. “Mum gave me discipline. She and my sister educated me, so I never went to the wrong side. I remember when I told her I want to make it as a professional. For me to have even been thinking about the Premier League is just like… You are kidding! I knew the minimum salary for a professional footballer in Portugal was €1,250. No one in our family earned a thousand. I just thought if I became professional, I can help pay the bills. “Even in Italy, I never thought that I would go to England. But then Everton came! Everton of Lukaku! My mind was saying Lukaku played there, Eto’o played there. So if I could play in Everton, it would be a dream. I think I’m blessed.” Beto is thoughtful about his unusual football education. “It helps me in some ways, but in some aspects of my game, I miss those basics that you learn when you are in an academy. “It is the simplest things; passing one touch, receiving the ball, holding the ball. You learn these in professional academies because you do repetition, whereas at the smallest clubs like mine, we just go there, train, and it’s less specific.” Moyes tells The Athletic that “the modern-day centre-half wants to be no-contact, but Beto wants to do things differently — he is running in behind, he’s a powerful, big boy, he’s got bits about him which you wouldn’t enjoy playing against”. He adds, “A lot of managers would say they’re always worried about Beto. His unpredictability for us… is certainly the same for the defenders as well.” In Italy, Beto learned from other leading strikers. “The first time I saw aura was Zlatan Ibrahimovic. We drew 1-1, I scored and he scored. When I played against Lukaku, he recognised me. He said, ‘You are playing better, keep going’. I was very happy. I said, ‘Wow, I made it. These small things are really good for me’.” Beto admits to finding his start to life at Everton challenging. “Everything was too physical,” he says. “The intensity killed me. I wasn’t playing well. I started losing confidence. Without confidence, I can’t do nothing. It was a tough season, but it was good to train my mind because it was stressful. “I was going home and looking at my videos from Italy and saying, ‘But I can play football, why is it not working?’. You question yourself a lot and this is the worst part. It was a blessing, too, because I learned from that.” Moyes says Beto’s determination stands out: “Every day we are saying, ‘Come on, will you come off the training ground?’. He really is trying to improve in everything he does.” Beto says, “I care about training. It brings me fire. If training goes not so well, I want to do extra — just to feed myself a little.” In his first season, Beto struggled with the criticism he received on social media. “It was not easy. I used to (pay attention). If I or Everton posted a picture, I would go to the comments and they might say Beto was not good today. This is not good to read because you can be strong, but you’re going to create something in your subconscious by taking all the comments in. If you care about the criticism, whether it is good or bad, it can make you shake. The ego is a difficult thing to balance.” Last summer, ahead of the new season, he worked overtime to prepare his body for the rigours of a full Premier League season. “If I get my fitness right for the Premier League, I think I can smash everyone. This was my mindset. I trained so hard in the off-season. The beginning of the season wasn’t the way I wanted. By the end, all the work that I put in paid off.” The challenge now, as Everton seek to strengthen their forward line, is to do it all over again. “I have a goal target, but that is personal. Nobody knows it — even the manager. I want to be a better player and goalscorer than I was last season.”\n199 Posted 02/08/2025 at 15:26:46\nI keep getting blocked and asked to pay a couple of quid?\nEvery time I go back, same shit.\n200 Posted 02/08/2025 at 15:30:08\nI've often been vexed by some of the mindless criticisms that have been piled on players by our supporters (same at all clubs, I'm sure) especially when some of those players are trying their very best, often struggling to settle in new homes.\nSure, they earn ridiculous amounts of money, but I think many of us would do well to remember that they are nonetheless human beings who would benefit from their own supporters lifting them up rather than tearing them down.\n201 Posted 02/08/2025 at 15:48:02\nInteresting though about Eto'o. I don't know enough about him at all to comment on whether he had a hard start in life (as the article seems to suggest). But I do know his dad was an accountant in Cameroon so I'd assumed he had a quite a middle-class upbringing (whatever that means in West Africa).\nOn a very, very vaguely related note - I know I often pour cold water over the chances of our academy players, but it wouldn't surprise me if Polish-Cameroonian Jonathan Nsangou makes his debut at some level for us next season (after his Dad's very unusual journey to the NorthWest of England) along with Malick Olayiwola.\n205 Posted 02/08/2025 at 16:12:02\nMy heart wants to see that fairy tale but my head sees something very different. I honestly hope I'm wrong, but I just don't think the lad has what it takes to be a Premier League success story. Prove me wrong, Beto!\n206 Posted 02/08/2025 at 16:16:14\nHope we don't regret not bringing him in.\n207 Posted 02/08/2025 at 16:18:11\nAnd I was interested to note that he recognizes the deficiency in his touch, and that it's a result of his spending his key formative years 14-16 serving chicken and chopping weeds instead of doing thousands of repetitions in a football academy.\n208 Posted 02/08/2025 at 16:26:31\n213 Posted 02/08/2025 at 16:54:40\nLast paragraph, yes, two very young but very good potential players if we can keep hold of them.\n217 Posted 02/08/2025 at 17:06:26\nAs expected, detailed research and insight.\nIt also raises the fact that by those calculations, we spent over £100M on 3 underachievers in Davies, Krøldrup and Van der Meyde.\nAlthough I agree, inflation is the main driver, other factors will have contributed. Increased TV revenue and what you always mention, how English players' prices have become over-inflated.\nThanks again, Robert.\n218 Posted 02/08/2025 at 17:12:32\n222 Posted 02/08/2025 at 17:22:32\nI've been subscribing to The Athletic for a few years and it's a really good read. Some excellent articles and not just about Everton or football.\nWell worth the £1 a month it costs!\n232 Posted 02/08/2025 at 18:12:24\n249 Posted 02/08/2025 at 21:28:57\nSanchez, who turns 22 this month, has appeared 58 times for Sevilla in La Liga and 6 times in the Champions League. Can also play the wing and center mid. 4 goals, 4 assists last season in the league.\n256 Posted 02/08/2025 at 21:56:22\nHope he doesn't read that tongue-in-cheek AI-generated trilogy about Beto and Calvert-Lewin that I posted a month or so back!\n259 Posted 02/08/2025 at 22:08:50\nThe players must sometimes think with supporters like these, who needs enemies?!\n269 Posted 02/08/2025 at 01:44:30\nThey did it purchasing Roma and us if you remember? And it worked out for them.\n271 Posted 03/08/2025 at 12:53:03\nIt avoids fan and manager anxiety, and probably reduces pressure from selling clubs on us later. There's ways of paying what the selling club wants via easier add-ons, rather than straight up-front cash.\nI read Man City are looking for £12M to cover his wages. That's a fair chunk of change, but member City are covering £16M in basic wages and £20M amortisation. If Everton want a mega cheap deal, this will go to the last knocking of the window. On this one, I'd probably wait it out and pursue others first.\n272 Posted 03/08/2025 at 13:00:52\nCheap and available, I suspect we will be in for him, but I think we need better. Brownhill will cost £5M basic minimum, will not improve and will leave for nothing.\n273 Posted 03/08/2025 at 13:14:45\nI said throughout the post-January run in last season when he got a run, you can't help like Beto. He is popular with the supporters in the stadium and with the players.\nHe may be clumsy, might miss chances he should score, but he doesn't hide and will score goals, or provide opportunities for others by being a handful and a distraction to defenders.\nThere will always be different opinions on players and some always have a scapegoat based on those opinions. I spent long enough sticking up for Leon Osman and Tony Hibbert.\nOnce the change happened last season, it was refreshing to be going to the match feeling upbeat again, with the supporters behind the team.\n274 Posted 03/08/2025 at 13:33:56\nThere will always be players who divide opinions (Schneiderlin was one of my least favourites) but some people take it too far in my opinion and it doesn't help us at all.\n275 Posted 03/08/2025 at 16:21:41\n276 Posted 03/08/2025 at 16:34:31\n4 goals & 6 assists last season and can play right-wing or right-back.\n277 Posted 03/08/2025 at 16:48:20\nAt £14M, I think he'd be a good buy but have a feeling Moyes sees O'Brien at right-back.\nNot seen us linked to him yet by a more reliable source.\n278 Posted 03/08/2025 at 16:50:18\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Everton/comments/1ivmwn4/everton_in_recent_weeks_have_sounded_out_sevillas/\n279 Posted 03/08/2025 at 17:03:47\n280 Posted 03/08/2025 at 17:04:20\nI would tend to treat a Moretto report as more solid. He mostly writes on Arsenal for ESPN. But he had one of the earliest tips on us being in for Barry.\nLiam #279, my first thought exactly. Wish Yerry's availability had popped up before we re-signed Keane. The big guy seems to have found the secret to health at Cagliari. Missed only four of 51 games due to injury.\n281 Posted 03/08/2025 at 17:06:14\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
