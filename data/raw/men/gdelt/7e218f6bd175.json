  "body_text": "Super Eagles coach Eric Chelle’s final 28-man squad for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco blends experience with fresh talent as Nigeria chase a fourth continental title. The squad features established stars like Victor Osimhen and Ademola Lookman alongside exciting newcomers, including Ebenezer Akinsanmiro, PETER AKINBO and OLAMIDE ABE write\nGOALKEEPERS\nFrancis Uzoho (Omonia, Cyprus)\n21 caps\nFrancis Uzoho made his senior international debut in November 2017, replacing Daniel Akpeyi during a 4–2 friendly win over Argentina, and quickly rose to prominence within the Super Eagles set-up.\nHe was Nigeria’s first-choice goalkeeper at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, starting all three matches, and later featured at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, playing in the third-place victory over Tunisia. A series of injuries disrupted his progress between 2019 and 2021, limiting his role at 2021 AFCON in Cameroon, where he kept a clean sheet in his only appearance. Despite criticism following Nigeria’s World Cup play-off exit to Ghana in 2022, Uzoho rebounded during the 2023 AFCON qualifiers before relinquishing the starting role at the finals to Stanley Nwabali.\nStanley Nwabali (Chippa United, South Africa)\n27 caps\nNwabali earned his first senior cap in 2021 during an international friendly against Mexico and steadily worked his way into contention. His defining moment came at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Ivory Coast, where he was named man of the match in the semi-final after saving two penalties against South Africa to send Nigeria into the final.\nNwabali’s composure and authority established him as Nigeria’s first-choice goalkeeper during the tournament.\nDespite recent fitness concerns, the 29-year-old is expected to retain his place and anchor the side from the back under Eric Chelle.\nAmas Obasogie (Singida Black Stars, Tanzania)\nUncapped\nObasogie emerged as one of Nigeria’s standout goalkeepers after a record-breaking 2023/24 NPFL season with Bendel Insurance, where he kept 18 clean sheets and won the league’s best goalkeeper award. His form earned moves to Fasil Kenema in Ethiopia and later Singida Black Stars in Tanzania, where he built a reputation as a reliable penalty stopper.\nWithin the Super Eagles, Obasogie has become a trusted deputy to Nwabali, regularly included in squads during World Cup qualifiers. Although uncapped competitively, his appearance against Egypt underlines his readiness to step in when required.\nDEFENDERS\nSemi Ajayi (Hull City, England)\n46 caps, 1 goal\nAjayi began his international journey with Nigeria’s under-20 side in 2013 before earning his senior debut in 2018 during Africa Cup of Nations qualifying. He established himself as a dependable option in central defence and was included in multiple tournament squads.\nAt the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, Ajayi was ever-present, playing every minute of Nigeria’s seven matches as they finished runners-up.\nHis consistency and aerial strength remain key assets at the heart of the defence.\nCalvin Bassey (Fulham, England)\n37 caps, 1 goal\nBassey committed to Nigeria in 2021 after being eligible for three countries and made his debut during the 2022 World Cup qualifiers against Ghana.\nHe has since developed into one of the side’s most reliable defenders, combining physicality with versatility across the back line.\nBassey is the only Nigerian player to have completed every minute of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers so far.\nHe arrives at the tournament in form after scoring for Fulham in their recent Premier League win at Burnley.\nChidozie Awaziem (Nantes, France)\n36 caps, 1 goal\nAwaziem made his senior debut in 2017 and has since featured at the World Cup and multiple Africa Cup of Nations tournaments.\nThough Nantes have struggled domestically, Awaziem has impressed individually, scoring twice in his last four club appearances.\nHis pace and aggression make him a valuable option in both central defence and at right-back.\nAwaziem’s experience adds depth and competition within the defensive unit.\nZaidu Sanusi (Porto, Portugal)\n26 caps\nSanusi made his Nigeria debut in October 2020 and quickly became a regular presence at left-back.\nHe featured prominently at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations and was part of the squad criticised for tactical limitations during the round-of-16 exit.\nSanusi played six matches as Nigeria reached the final of the 2023 tournament in Ivory Coast.\nHis pace and overlapping runs continue to offer width and balance on the left flank.\nBright Osayi-Samuel (Birmingham City, England)\n25 caps\nOsayi-Samuel earned his first Nigeria cap in 2022, starting and completing a friendly against Portugal.\nHe was an important squad member at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, featuring five times as Nigeria finished runners-up.\nComfortable on either flank, Osayi-Samuel brings energy and athleticism to the defensive line.\nHis adaptability enhances tactical flexibility for the coaching staff.\nBruno Onyemaechi (Olympiacos, Greece)\n20 caps\nOnyemaechi made his senior debut in September 2023, playing the full match in Nigeria’s emphatic win over São Tomé and Príncipe. He went on to feature at the 2023 AFCON finals, where Nigeria finished second after defeat to Ivory Coast.\nPrimarily a left-back, Onyemaechi offers defensive solidity and positional discipline.\nHis steady integration has strengthened competition on the left side of defence.\nIgoh Ogbu (Slavia Prague, Czech Republic)\n1 cap\nIgoh Ogbu represented Nigeria at U-20 level in 2019, featuring at both the AFCON and the World Cup.\nHe earned senior opportunities during the 2025 Unity Cup and later made his official debut in a friendly against Russia.\nOgbu is regarded as a long-term option to replace the retired William Troost-Ekong and injured youngster Benjamin Fredrick in central defence. His physical presence and European experience mark him as one to watch.\nRyan Alebiosu (Blackburn Rovers, England)\nUncapped\nAlebiosu, born in England to Nigerian parents, opted to represent Nigeria at senior level.\nHe obtained a Nigerian passport ahead of the tournament and earned his first Super Eagles call-up.\nThe right-back arrives after a consistent run with Blackburn Rovers in the Championship.\nHe is the only uncapped defender in the squad, representing a potential new addition to the back line.\nMIDFIELDERS\nAlex Iwobi (Fulham FC, England)\n91 caps, 10 goals\nThe 29-year-old Fulham midfielder has evolved into one of Nigeria’s most reliable performers since making his debut in October 2015.\nHe represented England up to under-18 level before switching allegiance to Nigeria, and has been a constant presence at major tournaments. Iwobi was part of Nigeria’s squads at the 2018 World Cup and the 2019, 2021 and 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, finishing third in 2019 and runner-up at the last edition in Ivory Coast.\nDespite not scoring for Nigeria since 2022, Iwobi’s big-match temperament and versatility make him indispensable to Chelle’s plans. His ability to control tempo in midfield and drive forward when needed will be crucial as Nigeria aim to go one better than their final heartbreak last year.\nFrank Onyeka (Brentford FC, England)\n37 caps, three goals\nOnyeka made his Nigeria debut in a 1-0 friendly loss to Algeria in October 2020 and has grown into an important squad member. The Brentford midfielder caught the eye at the 2023 AFCON with his tireless, non-stop running, starting all seven of Nigeria’s matches as they reached the final.\nThe 26-year-old scored his first international goal in October 2023 during a 3-2 win over Mozambique and has added two more since. Known for his energy and box-to-box capabilities, Onyeka provides defensive solidity and forward thrust in equal measure.\nWilfred Ndidi (Besiktas FC, Turkey)\n71 caps\nThe 29-year-old defensive midfielder remains one of Nigeria’s most important players despite never finding the net in 71 international appearances. Ndidi made his Super Eagles debut in October 2015 against DR Congo and has been a mainstay ever since, known for his defensive ability and tactical intelligence.\nHe was part of Nigeria’s squads at the 2018 World Cup and the 2019 and 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Ndidi was named in the 2023 AFCON squad but withdrew due to injury in early January 2024, replaced by Alhassan Yusuf.\nNow with Turkish giants Besiktas, Ndidi’s experience and composure make him Chelle’s preferred option at the base of midfield when fit.\nRaphael Onyedika (Club Brugge, Belgium)\n17 caps, one goal\nThe 24-year-old Club Brugge midfielder has been confirmed in Nigeria’s final squad despite limited opportunities under Eric Chelle. Onyedika made his international debut in September 2022 and scored his first goal in October 2023 during a 3-2 win over Mozambique.\nHe was part of Nigeria’s squad that reached the 2023 AFCON final in Ivory Coast but featured only once, playing the final 27 minutes of the 1-0 victory over Guinea-Bissau. His growing importance at club level has kept him in the conversation, with 22 appearances for Brugge this season, including three in the UEFA Champions League, contributing two goals and one assist.\nRegarded as the future of Nigeria’s midfield, he faces a battle to win Chelle’s trust ahead of Ndidi and Onyeka.\nTochukwu Nnadi (Zulte Waregem, Belgium)\nThe 22-year-old defensive midfielder from Imo State earns his first senior call-up after an impressive rise through Belgian football. Nnadi trained at local Campos FC and Dubai’s Madenat Alamal academy before joining Bulgarian side Botev Plovdiv in August 2021, making his professional debut in April 2022.\nAfter logging 42 league appearances over two seasons in Bulgaria, he transferred to Belgian second-tier club Zulte Waregem in January 2024, where he has been a regular starter with 34 games and one goal. Known as a box-to-box, high-energy midfielder, Nnadi is quick, strong in the tackle and capable of driving forward.\nFisayo Dele-Bashiru (SS Lazio, Italy)\n10 caps, two goals\nThe 24-year-old Lazio midfielder received his first Nigeria call-up in October 2023 and made an immediate impact, scoring in his second appearance during a 2026 World Cup qualifier against South Africa. Born in Nigeria before moving to England at a young age, Dele-Bashiru’s technical ability and creativity offer a different dimension to Nigeria’s midfield.\nEbenezer Akinsanmiro (Pisa SC, Italy)\n1 cap\nThe 21-year-old attacking midfielder is one of Nigeria’s brightest young talents and earns his first senior call-up after impressive performances in Serie A. Born in Lagos in November 2004, Akinsanmiro began his career at Remo Stars Academy, helping them win promotion to the NPFL in 2021 at just 17.\nHis performances attracted European interest, and he signed a four-year contract with Italian giants Inter Milan in January 2023.\nCurrently on loan at newly promoted Pisa in Serie A, Akinsanmiro has made 11 league appearances this season, delivering one assist and earning man-of-the-match recognition twice. He made his Super Eagles debut in the 2-1 friendly defeat to Egypt on Tuesday.\nUsman Muhammed (Ironi Tiberias, Israel)\nThe 31-year-old midfielder gets his first senior call-up after a globe-trotting career spanning Nigeria, Norway, Armenia, Russia, Kazakhstan and Israel.\nHe moved to Europe in 2018, playing for Norway’s Sarpsborg 08 and Armenia’s FC Pyunik before settling in Israel, where he has logged over 100 appearances across Hapoel Hadera, Sektzia Ness Ziona and Maccabi Bnei Reineh. In mid-2025, he signed with Ironi Tiberias in the Israeli second tier.\nMuhammed gained global attention in 2018 when he scored a brilliant solo goal against reigning Europa League champions Atletico Madrid in an international friendly in Uyo.\nFORWARDS\nAdemola Lookman (Atalanta BC, Italy)\n34 caps, eight goals\nThe 28-year-old Atalanta winger is one of Nigeria’s most important attacking threats. Born in England to Nigerian parents, Lookman made his Nigeria debut in March 2022 in a scoreless World Cup qualifier against Ghana. He was named in Nigeria’s squad for the 2023 AFCON in Ivory Coast, where he emerged as a star, scoring both goals in their 2-0 win over Cameroon in the round of 16 and their only goal in a 1-0 quarter-final win over Angola.\nNigeria lost the final 2-1 to hosts Ivory Coast, but Lookman and the rest of the team were named Members of the Order of the Niger in recognition of their performance. He also won the 2024 Africa Player of The Year award.\nHis pace, dribbling ability and eye for goal make him indispensable to Chelle’s attacking plans as Nigeria chase their fourth continental title.\nSamuel Chukwueze (Fulham FC, England)\n51 caps, seven goals\nThe 26-year-old winger has been in red-hot form for Fulham, recording five goal contributions in his last five Premier League games before joining the AFCON squad. After representing Nigeria at U-17s, Chukwueze made his senior debut in November 2018 in a 0-0 friendly draw against Uganda.\nHe was selected for the 2019 AFCON in Egypt and scored his first senior goal in Nigeria’s 2-1 quarter-final win over South Africa. Chukwueze also participated in the 2021 AFCON, where Nigeria defeated Tunisia 1-0 in the round of 16, and was part of the squad that reached the 2023 AFCON final.\nVictor Osimhen (Galatasaray FC, Turkey)\n45 caps, 31 goals\nThe 26-year-old striker is Nigeria’s most potent weapon and sits just six goals behind Rashidi Yekini’s all-time scoring record of 37.\nAfter much success at the youth level, he made his senior debut in June 2017 in a 2-0 defeat to South Africa. Osimhen was part of Nigeria’s squad for the 2019 AFCON, where they finished third. He missed the 2021 AFCON, supposedly due to COVID-19.\nOsimhen starred in the 2023 AFCON finals with one goal and three assists, while also winning two penalties to help the Eagles reach the final.\nIn March 2025, he became Nigeria’s second-highest goal scorer after netting twice against Rwanda. He then scored hat-tricks against Benin in October 2025 and a brace against Gabon in November 2025 during World Cup qualifiers. With 31 international goals, Osimhen will be hungry to break Yekini’s record in Morocco.\nMoses Simon (Paris FC, France)\n88 caps, 10 goals\nSimon made his debut in March 2015 in an international friendly against Uganda and scored his first goal in September 2015 in a 2-0 win over Niger.\nHe was named in the preliminary 30-man squad for the 2018 World Cup, though injury prevented him from making the final 23. Simon was included in Nigeria’s squad for the 2019 AFCON and has been a regular ever since.\nA key figure in Nigeria’s run to the 2023 AFCON final, Simon was named a Member of the Order of the Niger along with his teammates. His experience, pace on the flanks and ability to deliver dangerous crosses make him an important option for Chelle, particularly when Nigeria need to change tactics or chase a game.\nChidera Ejuke (Sevilla FC, Spain)\n11 caps, one goal\nThe 26-year-old winger made his Nigeria debut in October 2020 in a 1-1 friendly draw with Tunisia, coming on as a substitute for Samuel Chukwueze. He was selected by coach Gernot Rohr for the 2021 AFCON and scored his only international goal in the 4-1 World Cup qualifying win over Gabon in the confederation play-offs.\nEjuke rounded off his pre-AFCON duties in emphatic fashion, scoring for Sevilla in their 4-0 victory over Real Oviedo on Monday, December 15.\nHis pace, successful dribbles and ability to stretch defences impressed as he capped Sevilla’s dominant performance with a clinical touch. Ejuke’s return to form at the perfect time will give Chelle confidence that he has attacking depth to rotate and keep opponents guessing.\nAkor Adams (Sevilla FC, Spain)\nFour caps, two goals\nThe 25-year-old forward has made an immediate impact at international level since receiving his first call-up in October 2025. Adams featured for Nigeria’s U-20 team at the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup, where they bowed out in the last 16 to Senegal.\nHe made his senior debut as a substitute against Lesotho in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers and scored on his first appearance. Adams has now scored two goals in just four caps, establishing himself as an exciting option in Nigeria’s attacking armoury.\nThe Sevilla striker also signed off his pre-AFCON duties in style, scoring and providing two assists in the 4-0 victory over Real Oviedo.\nPaul Onuachu (Trabzonspor AS, Turkey)\n25 caps, three goals\nThe 31-year-old striker stands at 2.01 metres (6 feet 7 inches), making him one of the tallest players in international football. Onuachu received his first call-up to Nigeria’s under-23 team in February 2015 and made his senior debut in March 2019.\nOn March 26, 2019, Onuachu scored his first goal for Nigeria in a friendly against Egypt within the first 10 seconds, the fastest goal ever scored by Nigeria.\nHe is arguably the most in-form Eagles player in Europe this season, with 11 goals in 15 league games.\nCyriel Dessers (Panathinaikos FC, Greece)\n11 caps, three goals\nThe 31-year-old striker was born in Belgium to a Belgian father and Nigerian mother, but chose to represent Nigeria at international level in December 2019. Dessers made his debut in a 1-1 friendly draw with Tunisia in October 2020.\nAfter scoring against Ghana in March 2024, he repeated the feat in May 2025 during the Unity Cup, netting the opening goal against Ghana for the second consecutive time.\nThis will be Dessers’ first official competition with the Super Eagles.\nSalim Fago (NK Istra 1961, Croatia)\nThe 22-year-old forward earns his first senior call-up on the strength of his scoring form in Croatia. Born in Lagos, Fago joined NK Istra 1961 in the Croatian top division in 2023 and has quickly made his mark, scoring four goals and providing two assists in 16 league games this season.\nA participant in Nigeria’s squad for the 2023 U-20 World Cup, where he played five games, Fago’s knack for carrying the ball and clinical finishing have caught the eye. He signed off his club duties before AFCON in impressive style, scoring for Istra in their match against Rijeka on Monday, though the game was suspended after just 18 minutes due to heavy fog.\nThough his senior minutes in Morocco may be limited by stars like Victor Osimhen and Ademola Lookman, Fago’s inclusion adds attacking depth and a high-energy threat. Given his youth-team pedigree, Chelle will hope the Croatian league goalscorer can learn and potentially deliver late in the tournament.",
