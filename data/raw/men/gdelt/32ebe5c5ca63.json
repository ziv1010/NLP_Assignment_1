They were however pegged back by the Ratels in the 42nd minute as Tumininu Adeshina’s goal evened the encounter going into the break.\nAdvertisement\nIt took only two minutes after the break for the Queens to reclaim the lead, with Mega Cynthia putting them ahead, before Samuel scored twice in six minutes to complete her hat-trick and seal the dominant win.\nThe striker made it 3-1 on 61 minutes before adding another goal on 67 minutes.\nThe final whistle and confirmation of goalless draw between their rivals sent the team into celebration mode.\nAdvertisement\nBayelsa Queens secured its sixth NPFL title. It also ended a three-year wait to reclaim the title.\nBamidele Abiodun, wife of the Ogun state governor, presented the trophy to the winners, alongside NWFL board members and other dignitaries.\nBayelsa Queens’ title win earned the team the N10 million grand prize. They will represent Nigeria at the CAF Women’s Champions League zonal qualifiers in Côte d’Ivoire, where they have the chance to advance into the group stage of next season’s competition.\nAdvertisement",
