Chelsea's progress keeps the Argentine in contention for his first trophy in England after he lost the 2015 League Cup final during his time at Tottenham.\n\"We are so happy. The fans and the club deserve this sort of feeling. It's a big motivation,\" Pochettino said. \"We are so young. We are creating a very good bond. This type of result will help us.\"\nThe defeat was a painful blow for Newcastle, who failed in its attempt to avenge last season's League Cup final loss to Manchester United at Wembley.\nAfter crashing out of the Champions League group stage, Newcastle's exit was another setback for the Saudi-backed club in its bid to land a first major trophy since 1969.\n\"It hurts a lot. We defended really well but didn't get over the line,\" Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said. \"It's a very painful moment for us. We'll just have to accept it and digest it.\"\nNewcastle had been gifted the lead by Chelsea's shambolic defending in the 16th minute.\nCallum Wilson seized possession inside his own half and accelerated away from Thiago Silva as his surging run carried him into the Chelsea area.\nBenoit Badiashile should have snuffed out the danger, but the defender's woefully miscued attempt to clear allowed Wilson to fire home with ease.\nWith 20 minutes left, France forward Christopher Nkunku came on for his Chelsea debut after a prolonged injury absence since his offseason move from RB Leipzig.\nTwo minutes into stoppage time, Chelsea forced a shootout as Newcastle defender Kieran Trippier made a mess of dealing with a cross, misdirecting his header to Mudryk, who drilled into the bottom corner.\nTrippier's terrible night\nTrippier's misery was compounded when he smashed Newcastle's second penalty wide in the shootout.\nNkunku converted Chelsea's third penalty in his first significant contribution for the club.\nDjordje Petrovic sealed Chelsea's victory as he dived to his left to make a brilliant save from Matt Ritchie's kick.\nFulham moved into the semifinals for the first time after a 7-6 shootout win against Everton following a 1-1 draw at Goodison Park.\nCottagers boss Marco Silva enjoyed a measure of revenge on the club that sacked him in 2019 by leading Fulham to its first domestic semifinal since the 2002 FA Cup.\nTosin Adarabioyo scored the decisive spot-kick after Everton's Idrissa Gueye hit the post.\nAmadou Onana had missed a chance to win the tie for Everton earlier in the shootout when his kick was saved by Bernd Leno.\nFulham went ahead in the 41st minute through Michael Keane's own goal before Everton substitute Beto equalized with eight minutes left.\n\"It's incredible what the players have been doing,\" Silva said. \"We wanted to make history in the football club.\"\nMiddlesbrough cruised past third-tier Port Vale to reach the semifinals for the first time since it lifted the trophy in 2004.\nMichael Carrick's Championship side ruined Vale's first quarterfinal appearance with goals from Jonathan Howson, Morgan Rogers and Matt Crooks.\nAFP\nMost Popular\n- Guangdong beats Macao 2-0 in first leg of soccer cup\n- Para teams set to leave mark on ice\n- US skier Johnson wins women's downhill as Vonn crashes at Milan-Cortina Games\n- Su Yiming clinches first medal at Milano-Cortina\n- Over 300 athletes from 35 countries and regions kick off Asian championships in Tianjin\n- Legacy of Beijing 2022 lives on as Milan welcomes Games",
