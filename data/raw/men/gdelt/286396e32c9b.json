  "body_text": "Enzo Maresca and seven other candidates to be next Man United manager\nRuben Amorim has been sacked as Manchester United head coach after 14 months in charge.\nThe Portuguese manager led the Red Devils to last season’s Europa League final but lost the showpiece match to Tottenham Hotspur, meaning they missed out on a Champions League place.\nUnited finished a shocking 15th in the Premier League last season and Amorim leaves on Monday with the team sixth in the table, following disappointing draws at home to Wolves and away to Leeds.\nDarren Fletcher will take caretaker charge of the team for the trip to Burnley on Wednesday as the search for a new boss begins. Enzo Maresca, Oliver Glasner and Xavi Hernandez are among the frontrunners.\nBut who are the candidates to replace Amorim in the Old Trafford dugout?\nEnzo Maresca (4/6)\nThe Italian coach left Chelsea last week after 18 months, following a rapid fallout with the hierarchy at Stamford Bridge. Maresca has been linked with becoming the next manager at Manchester City, should Pep Guardiola leave, but could Maresca actually take charge on the red side of Manchester?\nOliver Glasner (4/1)\nPrior to Maresca’s departure, Crystal Palace manager Glasner was the bookies' favourite to replace Amorim and remains in contention. The Austrian coach led Palace to FA Cup glory, Palace’s first-ever major piece of silverware, and a 12th-place finish in the Premier League last season.\nDarren Fletcher (2/1)\nFormer United midfielder Fletcher, now the coach of the Under-18s, takes charge on an interim basis for the match against Burnley on Wednesday night. Much like Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2019, could a run of positive results mean Fletcher takes charge on a permanent basis?\nMichael Carrick (8/1)\nAnother ex-United midfielder in the running, Carrick impressed in his first full-time position in management at Middlesbrough, leading them to the EFL Cup semi-finals and the play-offs, but was sacked last summer after a 10th-place finish. Carrick previously took caretaker charge when Solskjaer was sacked in 2021.\nLaurent Blanc (20/1)\nThe World Cup winner and former United defender most recently managed Al-Ittihad in the Saudi Pro League, winning the domestic double, but was sacked in September.\nXavi Hernandez (10/1)\nThe former Barcelona manager is out of work after losing his job at the Nou Camp in May 2024, having guided his boyhood club to the La Liga title in 2023. He has not coached in Europe outside of Spain.\nRuud van Nistelrooy (20/1)\nVan Nistelrooy, an ex-United striker, previously worked as assistant coach to Erik ten Hag before taking caretaker charge when his fellow Dutchman was sacked last season. He finished his interim tenure with three wins and one draw, but was unimpressive as Leicester City boss last season as the Foxes were relegated from the Premier League.\nGareth Southgate (8/1)\nThe former England manager has been out of work since Euro 2024, when he led the Three Lions to their second major final in three years. Long linked with the top job at Old Trafford, Southgate has noted that a career away from football management may be his calling.\nOther candidates: Kieran McKenna, Julian Nagelsmann, Mauricio Pochettino, Andoni Iraola, Unai Emery, Zinedine Zidane\nOdds provided by BetVictor, Parimatch & TalkSport Bet\nPlease Gamble Responsibly\nIf you decide to engage with any of the online betting sites for Man Utd odds remember to gamble responsibly, even when using free bets and betting sign up offers.\nWhen betting, always assume you’ll lose and therefore, only bet what you can afford to lose.\nMake sure you use the responsible gambling tools offered by betting companies such as deposit limits, reality checks, loss limits and time outs.
