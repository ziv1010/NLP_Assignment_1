Everyone would say that is clear.\"\nHe added: \"You have to realise what you can do and then work with it. That is your job. We are not children.\n\"When you ask a five-year-old what they want for Christmas and they tell you, 'I don't know, a Ferrari', you wouldn't say 'that's a good idea' -- you would say 'that is too expensive and anyway you cannot drive it'.\n\"If this kid then was really unhappy because he didn't get a Ferrari, it would be a really sad life.\"\n'Step aside'\nKlopp publicly praised Bellingham in December, describing him as \"exceptional\" after he impressed at the World Cup in Qatar.\nThe teenage midfielder, who previously played in England for second-tier side Birmingham, is close to international team-mates Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jordan Henderson, raising hopes among Liverpool supporters that one of Europe's hottest prospects could be coming to Anfield.\nHenderson, speaking after England's win against Ukraine in March, said it would be \"amazing\" if a player with Bellingham's \"frightening\" talent were signed by Liverpool.\nYet Liverpool have taken the pragmatic decision to focus on a group of signings, with Chelsea midfielders Mason Mount and Conor Gallagher reportedly now among their top targets.\n\"You look what you can do, and you work with that. That is always how I worked,\" Klopp said.\n\"What we need and what we want, we try everything to try to get but there are moments where we have to accept and step aside and do different things.\"\nEighth-placed Liverpool, who face Leeds on Monday, are 12 points adrift of the top four and could miss out on European football altogether next season unless they improve quickly.\nThe inconsistent Reds have routed Manchester United 7-0 and thumped Bournemouth 9-0, but also suffered embarrassing defeats at Brighton, Brentford and Wolves, while enduring a Champions League last-16 hammering by Real Madrid.\n\"It's a super strange season. I think we all agree it hasn't been our best season but we've also had two of our biggest wins in our history. We haven't been consistent and that's been the problem,\" Klopp said.\nThe Liverpool boss will welcome back Luis Diaz for the trip to Elland Road, with the Colombia forward available for the first time since suffering a knee injury in October.\n© 2023 AFP",
