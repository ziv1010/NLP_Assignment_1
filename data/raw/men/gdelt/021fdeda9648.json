It's nice when you deliver you can give them a little bit back,\" said the Real Madrid star of his goal celebration.\n\"For me playing football, being on the pitch, scoring goals is my release and it's maybe a message to a few people.\"\nSouthgate was more understanding of the wave of criticism that is still set to come his side's way before they face the Swiss in Duesseldorf.\n\"We're putting a plaster over things and giving young players opportunities,\" said Southgate.\n\"We're somehow finding a way. I can imagine how everyone is going to react even though we've won but we are still in there. The one thing that cannot be questioned is the desire, the commitment, the character.\"\nThe spotlight is on Southgate to find a solution over the next six days to avoid failing again to deliver major tournament glory at his fourth attempt.\nSwitzerland made light work of beating holders Italy 2-0 on Saturday and are a significant step-up in quality from Slovakia.\nThe England boss hailed the impact of his substitutes.\nEberechi Eze and Ivan Toney played a part in Kane's winning goal, while Cole Palmer added some thrust from midfield.\nHowever, the fact it took 66 minutes for Southgate to make any changes and his stubbornness in starting 10 of the same 11 in all four games so far has left his judgement open to question.\nBellingham's intervention ensures Southgate will take charge of his country for the 100th time in the quarter-finals.\nBut England will need to be much improved if he is to stay in his job beyond the century mark.\n© 2024 AFP",
