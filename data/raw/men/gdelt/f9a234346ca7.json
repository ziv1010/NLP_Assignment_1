  "body_text": "After a disappointing streak, EA Sports hit it out of the park with FC25, where for the first time in ages the gameplay feels like football.\nA lot of this authenticity comes from the overhauled tactics system, which if you close your eyes feels a little like Football Manager lite.\nMastering the tactical settings is essential to succeed in FC25, be it on Career Mode or Ultimate Team, and this tactics handbook is here to give you efficient setups for every type of player.\n6 The Safe 3-4-1-2\nAtalanta's Secret Sauce\nGian Piero Gasperini's story is every FC25 player's dream. In 2016, he took over a struggling Atalanta (or Bergamo, in EA-speak) and molded it to his liking, making it Italy's 'best of the rest'.\nThe signature move of this system is that the central midfielders and wingbacks overlap in possession, freeing the latter to move further up the pitch. Meanwhile, the #10 drops closer to the central defenders to receive the ball.\nThis makes the buildup phase safe and creates space in the middle sector by baiting the opposing midfield and forwards wide.\nAs the ball moves forward, the drifting central mids and wingbacks can combine with the #10 or one of the forwards to make effective passing triangles.\nIn the final third, the attacking mid roams to the flank to pick up the ball and feed it to one of the forwards.\nWithout the ball, this tactic requires pressing the opposing defense to make the build-up more uncomfortable.\nEA FC 2025: 11 Players With Insane Potential\nThese players may not seem like much today, but they are the stars of tomorrow.\nThe main weakness with this 3-4-1-2 is that it is very vulnerable to an opponent with defenders who are good with the ball, as they can easily bypass the early press and send trouble straight to the midfield pair.\nThis setup works best with a traditional #9 and a nominal attacking midfield or winger next to them. The player behind the front two must have good lungs, as they will be working as a box-to-box midfielder and roaming forward depending on the situation.\n5 4-4-Bloody-2\nIf It Ain't Broke, Cross It In\nIf in doubt, play some four-four-bloody-two. The 4-4-2 gets a bad rep for being basic, but it is one of those formations that just works if you have the right players for it.\nThe criticism is not entirely unwarranted, as this formation does lend itself to less exciting football than your fancy 4-3-3 or 4-5-1 variations, but it lingers on so long because it offers lesser teams a way to fight the big guys on their terms.\nThe main advantage of a 4-4-2 is that having two dedicated forwards in front of four midfielders makes it easy to move the ball up to them.\nAfter that, they are largely on their own, which is why you need forwards that can either outrun or outmuscle the opposition.\nThe fullbacks are crucial here to provide with and move the ball from the flanks into the box, while also bypassing a tight midfield via combinations with the wingers.\nThe default 4-4-2 struggles against sides playing a five or three-man backline, which is why this model uses an inside forward on one end. This means that, situationally, your team will move to a 4-3-3 when the right flank drifts infield.\nThe midfield pairing needs one enforcer with good distribution and a Duracell bunny type that can run all day long.\nSince this tactical setup is compact and sits deeper, do not shy away from Route One football if push comes to shove.\n4 High-Pressing 4-3-3\nTactics So Good Even Liverpool Can Win The League\nJürgen Klopp is gone from Liverpool, but he left a tactical legacy that revolutionized world football.\nKlopp imported his aggressive pressing style from Dortmund and refined it to bring Liverpool's first-ever Premier League.\nThis tactics setup is perfect if you have wide players with good positioning and finishing skills, supported by a light center-forward who can create space for them instead of hogging up the ball.\nThe flat midfield trio has no focal point, but that is by design. The goal here is to suffocate your adversary, regain possession, and move the ball to the front three before the defense can reorganize.\nThe falseback behind the inside forward beefs up the midfield line in possession, but it needs a defender with good passing stats to work.\nKeeping that level of pressure up takes a lot of stamina and leaves space behind, so you need versatile midfielders and defenders who can track back fast to avoid getting smoked by long balls on the counter.\n3 Possession Obsession 4-1-4-1\nFlexible Attacking Football\nThis tactic takes a carousel approach to positioning, and you will regularly find a central midfielder playing pair up top by your striker, or a winger running into space down the middle.\nThis asymmetrical formation hinges on a creative midfield that can pull its weight when defending and fullbacks that are not scared to control the flow of the game.\nThe wide midfielders drift inside during most of the attacks to link up with the central mids, eventually overwhelming the defense in the process.\nFor that to work, you need a good ball-playing defensive midfielder who can survive the opposing press and move the ball between the lines, and quick central defenders, as losing possession here almost can lead to a blistering counterattack.\nThis tactic can struggle to break into the box against very deep-seated teams. You can get around this via the generous use of long shots, or by replacing the poacher with a mobile forward that can make incisive runs.\n2 The Italian 5-3-2\nAntonio Conte's Signature Back Five\nSince leaving Juventus, Antonio Conte has earned a reputation for being a passionate genius whose tactical innovations are eventually undone by his temper after a season or two.\nFortunately, your FC25 players are easier to deal with, allowing this tactic to earn you a few titles undisturbed.\nEA Sports FC 25: 7 Best Career Mode Teams\nFC25 is the first game in years that can satisfy the gameplay cravings of Career Mode players, with fresh challenges and exciting stories to play out.\nDefensively, this is a compact setup both horizontally and vertically, which focuses on squeezing the opponent into the flanks and then overwhelming them there.\nThis formation has a playmaker central defender protected by two pitbull types on the flanks and a defensive midfield enforcer ahead.\nNo-nonsense wingbacks make or break this system. Keep it simple: a guy that can hug the touchline and put a good cross in, then track back and regain possession if it goes wrong.\nThe Conte 5-3-2 needs two central midfielders with good stamina and aggression, sitting behind one traditional poacher and a mobile forward that can drop back to create.\nIf you want to go for a more offensive approach, you can change this for a 3-4-3, but it leaves you more exposed to counterattacks.\n1 The Pep 4-3-3\nThe Secret to Manchester City's Success\nPep Guardiola managed to bring the Champions League trophy to the Etihad after 7 long years, and this tactic was crucial in that campaign.\nThis 4-3-3 hinges on the defenders, with at least one ball-playing center back to move up the field and join the holding midfielder. The fullbacks need to be defensively solid, beefing up the midfield instead of bombing forwards.\nThis defensive foundation frees up the other two midfielders to roam and find space to create, allowing an offensive-minded central midfielder or an attacking midfielder to slot into either CM role.\nThe magic happens with a creative wide forward playing off a traditional #9 and an incisive winger on the opposite end.\nThis tactic overwhelms the final third with creative players and beats the defense into submission.\nThe main weakness of this 4-3-3 is that it is overly reliant on possession, so an aggressive team that does not sit back can make for a miserable time if your defenders are not up to the task.\nEAFC 2025: 10 Cheap FUT Bargains You Need To Buy\nYou don't need to break the bank to get a baller in FUT!\n- OpenCritic Reviews\n- Top Critic Avg: 76/100 Critics Rec: 63%\n- Released\n- September 27, 2024\n- ESRB\n- Everyone // Alcohol And Tobacco Reference, Users Interact, In-Game Purchases (Includes Random Items)\n- Developer(s)\n- EA Canada, EA Romania\n- Publisher(s)\n- EA Sports\n- Engine\n- Frostbite\n- Multiplayer\n- Online Multiplayer, Local Multiplayer, Online Co-Op, Local Co-Op\n- Franchise\n- EA Sports FC\n- Platform(s)\n- PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC\n- Genre(s)\n- Sports\n- OpenCritic Rating\n- Strong",
