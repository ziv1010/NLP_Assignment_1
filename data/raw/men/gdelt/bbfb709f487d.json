  "body_text": "Paris Saint-Germain moved a step closer to a first Champions League title by withstanding Arsenal’s early barrage to book a final date with Inter in Munich on May 31.\nGoals in each half from Fabian Ruiz and Achraf Hakimi made it 3-0 on aggregate before Bukayo Saka reduced the arrears.\nArsenal’s direct and aggressive start put PSG on the back foot in the opening stages and forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into smart saves but it was the hosts who went closest when Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s shot slammed back off the post.\nAdvertisement\nAnd the failure to make the most of the impressive opening cost Arsenal dear when Ruiz’s shot from the edge of the box deflected off William Saliba and flew beyond David Raya in the 27th minute.\nDonnarumma made another stunning save after the break to deny Saka before Raya kept Arsenal in the game by saving Vitinha’s woeful 69th-minute penalty — awarded after VAR intervened over a Myles Lewis-Skelly handball.\nWithin three minutes, Hakimi swept home from the edge of the box to make it 3-0 on aggregate, with Saka getting Arsenal on the scoresheet soon after. The forward then spurned a glorious chance to well and truly add to home nerves when he fired over.\nBut PSG held firm and that’s now four defeats in four two-legged semi-finals for Arteta as Arsenal manager.\nThe Athletic’s Jack Lang, Jordan Campbell and Mark Carey analyse the action from the Parc des Princes.\nAre Arsenal becoming a nearly team?\nDeclan Rice said on Tuesday he believes Arsenal are close to winning major trophies and that, once they get over the line the first time, more will follow. He may be right but after their exit in Paris, this group has still to shake that monkey off their back.\nThe concern is that, in coming so close so often over the last three years, it could eventually take its toll psychologically.\nArsenal are on track to finish second in the Premier League three years running. Given Manchester City’s dominance until this season, cup competitions offered an alternative route to silverware but the exit in Paris is the second semi-final they have lost this season after the 4-0 aggregate loss to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup.\nThey are one of the best sides in Europe and have been for three years but the same group of players will now have to regroup and re-motivate themselves after a fifth trophyless season.\nIt is harsh and oversimplistic to boil a team this good and consistent down to one column. Their progress has been great under Arteta but until they become winners, they will be regarded as nearly men.\nAdvertisement\nArteta said this week that it is about timing and, while he may be right that there has been an element of misfortune in some cases, they are surely too strong a side not to banish this tag soon.\nSaka’s late goal did end a run of six consecutive semi-final legs in all competitions in which Arsenal had failed to score, but one was never going to be enough at Parc des Princes and so it proved.\nJordan Campbell\nDonnarumma stands tall… yet again\nPSG goalkeeper Donnarumma was arguably the key figure in the first leg, making a string of jaw-dropping saves to preserve his clean sheet. Here, too, he kept goal as if his life depended on it, particularly during that early Arsenal aerial blitzkrieg.\nDonnarumma showed good reflexes to deny Gabriel Martinelli after just four minutes, but that was nothing compared to his next stop, from Martin Odegaard. The midfielder could not have hit his half-volley from the edge of the box any better; the shot also went through a forest of legs, obscuring Donnarumma’s view until the very last. It looked a certain goal.\nWHAT A SAVE!\nGianluigi Donnarumma makes a phenomenal stop to deny Martin Ødegaard, what a tie he’s having 👏\n📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/IG8Kv3hkXn\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) May 7, 2025\nThat Donnarumma was able to plunge down to his left and tip the ball wide was not just impressive. It was borderline miraculous, and yet another demonstration of his unique brilliance.\nThe second half was more of a mixed bag. There was a stretching, no-right-to-get-there save from Saka, but also an error that could easily have been costly: Donnarumma rushed from goal to claim a cross with the score at 2-1, got nowhere near it and was relieved to see Saka skew his shot wide.\nThat, too, is part of Donnarumma’s charm. He’s superb but he can also be a liability. The issue for Arsenal was that the balance of that equation was weighted firmly in PSG’s favour over the two legs.\nJack Lang\nAdvertisement\nWas Saka’s miss glaring?\nMany will look at Saka’s miss in slow motion. Others might freeze the image just as he is about to shoot. “How did he not score that? It is harder to miss!”\nIf you scrutinise the shot to within an inch of its life, you can easily find issues with Saka’s shot selection. Yes, he is leaning back. Sure, he takes it with his weaker foot. But watch the sequence at full speed and there are plenty of reasons why that was a trickier shot than people think.\nThe ball is fired across goal by Riccardo Calafiori at pace, with it bouncing under Saka’s foot just as it reaches him. Add in the fact that you have a 6ft 5in goalkeeper flying out and almost occluding the view of the ball, and those millimetres — and milliseconds — count for a lot at the elite level.\nBukayo Saka misses from close range 😬\nJust minutes after pulling a goal back for Arsenal, he fires the ball over the crossbar ❌\n📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/NAsmHnzQ3h\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) May 7, 2025\nThere have been trickier strikes to convert in his career, and it was jarring to see the ball fly over the bar. However, to suggest that Saka’s chance was easy would be a unfair simplification of the sequence in such a high-stake game of football.\nMark Carey\nArsenal failed to make most of positive start\nArsenal started so ferociously that, after saving the English side’s third big chance of the opening eight minutes, Donnarumma decided to sit on the floor and call for treatment.\nYou sensed that the Italian goalkeeper knew his team-mates needed a moment of respite, given the intense pressing they were suffocating under. When he got to his feet, the home support produced a huge cheer. It felt like they knew they had survived the worst, and that was the issue for Arsenal.\nAdvertisement\nJust as PSG scored within four minutes at the Emirates, you sensed that Arsenal simply had to capitalise when they were dominating in such an extreme manner.\nPSG were being harassed into panicked clearances, Arsenal were finding Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka in isolated areas regularly and they had complete territorial control.\nDeclan Rice was inches away from converting a header at the back post, while Martinelli and Odegaard were both denied by Donnarumma.\nArteta said last week that no team at this level can dominate a side like PSG for a full 90 minutes. It was inevitable that they would swing the momentum at some point, and that is what happened as Kvaratskhelia produced a curling shot from nowhere that struck the post.\nArsenal continued to dominate possession but they did not slice PSG open as easily and a couple of sloppy turnovers saw the hosts counter on Arsenal, missing two big chances of their own.\nMyles Lewis-Skelly has been sublime since he broke into the team in December but this was the first game in which he has suffered. He was robbed on three occasions in the first half as his indecision on whether to drive with the ball or not played him into trouble.\nBut PSG produced the killer blow when Ruiz scored a volley from the edge of the box. A wicked deflection off Saliba made it an even more bitter blow.\nWHAT. A. STRIKE. 🚀\nFabian Ruiz extends PSG’s aggregate lead over Arsenal to 2-0 with unbelievable power and technique 💥\n📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/HwAy0GspYS\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) May 7, 2025\nAnd for U.S. readers\nFabián Ruiz with the SWEETEST strike for his first-ever UCL goal 😤 pic.twitter.com/GpEjA6la7B\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) May 7, 2025\nArsenal’s failure to convert their early dominance felt indicative of Arsenal’s season. So often they dominate but turning that into goals and trophies is what will define this team. Right now, that finishing touch continues to elude them.\nJordan Campbell\nAdvertisement\nLuis Enrique’s team found a way\nPSG have produced some of the most incisive attacking football in Europe this season. They are, at their best, a thrill to watch — and, you imagine, an absolute waking nightmare to defend against. This, though, was a night on which the rhythms were ever so slightly out of whack.\nThat can partly be explained by the absence of Ousmane Dembele from the starting XI. With their talisman only fit enough for a late cameo, PSG went for the classic three-winger formation — a fun idea but not that effective in practice, with none of Bradley Barcola, Desire Doue or Kvaratskhelia especially comfortable through the middle.\nKvaratskhelia played well and hit the post. Doue and Barcola, though, were oddly listless, both in their approach play and in their finishing. It left PSG looking decaffeinated in the final third, even when the midfield had wrested some control back from Arsenal.\nWhat will be pleasing for Luis Enrique is that his side found a way to get the job done anyway. This was a night for sturdy defending, for hard work, for cool heads. On all of those counts, PSG passed the test with flying colours. It wasn’t a buccaneering performance but it oozed maturity — and that should stand them in good stead in the final against Inter.\nJack Lang\nA set-piece… problem\nOn the one hand, Arsenal have continued to be one of the strongest teams in Europe from attacking set pieces — creating innovative, choreographed routines that can often resemble a street dance troop.\nBut, look closely at their defensive set-piece numbers and it will make you wince. When controlling for the opportunity of set pieces faced in the Premier League, Arsenal’s 6.9 goals conceded per 100 opponent set pieces is good enough for… the worst in the league.\nSure, this was only the second set-piece goal they have conceded across their Champions League campaign, but when the margins are paper thin, you cannot afford to blink without getting punished.\nAdvertisement\nPSG’s wide free kick was initially dealt with well by Thomas Partey who got first contact, but his header landed straight to Ruiz on the edge of the box. Martinelli was the nearest defender on the edge of the box, but his recovery run was not enough to stop Ruiz firing a volley past David Raya on the second phase. The fact Martinelli was sprinting to stop Ruiz was evidence enough that panic had already set in.\nWe can laud Arsenal’s attacking threat from dead-ball situations all we want, but it is important to look at both sides of the coin.\nMark Carey\nPartey’s inspiration from Pulis?\nGiven the technical quality and blistering pace that PSG showed in the first leg, there was little point in Arsenal looking to go toe-to-toe with them at the Parc des Princes with delicate, possession-based attacking football.\nInstead, they channelled Tony Pulis’s Stoke City from the late 2000s, with Thomas Partey launching the ball into the box whenever Arsenal had a throw-in from the attacking quarter of the pitch. Another form of a set piece, you might say, but it was notable just how often this tactic was used in Paris.\nFor context, there were 11 occasions when Arsenal hauled the ball into the box from such situations — that is more than any game in all competitions since Mikel Arteta arrived as manager. Having conceded via such means against Bournemouth last weekend, perhaps Arsenal’s manager liked what he saw.\nThe chaos that Partey’s throws caused should have resulted in at least one goal, with Martinelli and Odegaard denied by Donnarumma in the first half. Sadly for Arteta, Arsenal’s efforts did not quite pay off on the night but there was little doubt that their long-throw tactic had been cooked up since their first-leg meeting.\nMark Carey\nWhat did Luis Enrique say?\n“It means a lot to us all,” he told TNT. “Everybody has been dreaming of getting to the final — this was our aim when we came to PSG: to make history for the club.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s going to be tough against Inter but I think they have the same feeling. It’s going to be an interesting final and very difficult for both teams – it’s special for all of us. It’s their second final in three years and shows they are a great team.\n“We will analyse and have time to do that but now it’s time to celebrate and have some rest.\n“We are the league of farmers (a derogatory term for Ligue 1 used by other countries about a league where one team dominates) but it’s nice but we’re enjoying the results and the compliments of everybody. We are a young team but the mentality and character is great. I have to congratulate my players.”\nWhat did Mikel Arteta say?\n“Congratulations to PSG,” he told TNT. “The assessment I will make when I’m a little bit cooler, but the assessment I got from their bench was we were much better than them.\n“When you look at the two games, their best player on the pitch has been their goalkeeper. We were very close, much closer than our results showed. I’m very proud of the players, what we did today. The way we started, how we handled the pressure. After 20 minutes it should be 3-0. There is something extra you need in this competition to go your way, and it didn’t.\n“We were very close, yes for long periods of both games we were much better than them. But we are not there, and that has to hurt. There are certain things that are on us, and we shouldn’t just be understanding of the fact we are out, that’s not the way I look at it.\n“100 per cent (happy with the progress of the team). I don’t think there has been a better team in the competition from what I have seen. We are out tonight, we deserved much more in both games.\n“This competition is about the boxes and in them it is normally about the strikers and the goalkeepers. And he was their best player in both games.”\nWhat next for PSG?\nSaturday, May 10: Montpellier (away), Ligue 1, 8pm UK, 3pm ET\nWhat next for Arsenal?\nSunday, May 11: Liverpool (away), Premier League, 4.30pm UK, 11.30am ET\n(Top photo: THOMAS SAMSON/AFP via Getty Images)",
