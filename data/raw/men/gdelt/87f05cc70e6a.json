With a Bundesliga title defence looking \"unrealistic\", in Tuchel's words, a lot of hope is being pinned on their Champions League prospects, with the German record title holders out to overturn the narrow defeat in Rome and provide some positive relief.\nFrancesco Corda, Lazio reporter\nFriday's painful defeat against AC Milan was Lazio's fourth in six league games, and cup competitions may well be their priority now. Bayern may seem a less daunting prospect after their narrow victory in the first leg, and the early stages of this decider may be crucial. If the Biancocelesti can withstand the German champions' advances, they may have a chance to play on their hosts' nerves and pick them off on the break.\nWhat the coaches say\nThomas Tuchel, Bayern coach: \"The situation is very clear, and to put in a top performance we need to feel the pressure. Pressure is necessary to achieve extraordinary performances. We know we have to win, and against a well-organised Maurizio Sarri team. We hope the fans and the home atmosphere can push us so that we can achieve our goal of a win with a two-goal difference.\"\nMaurizio Sarri, Lazio coach: \"We have to be courageous and determined. We will have to suffer and sacrifice. In football, nothing is impossible and that must give us courage. We need to be at it from the off, which we haven't of late. Bayern have immeasurable quality. They score goals with great ease so we have to fight and die in defence, but also have the courage to go and hurt them. We can't defend for 100 minutes.\"\nWhere is the 2024 Champions League final?\nThe best of the best will be crowned on the ultimate stage when the 2023/24 Champions League season concludes at London's prestigious Wembley Stadium on Saturday 1 June.",
