  "body_text": "Hello and welcome to today's dedicated Chelsea live blog on football.london.\nThe Blues got their 2023 off to a far from idea start, as they only managed to draw 1-1 with relegation threatened Nottingham Forest yesterday. Raheem Sterling gave his side the lead in the clash, but former Tottenham man Serge Aurier equalised as both teams shared the points.\nElsewhere, the January transfer window is now open as the Blues look set to make a number of signings to bolster their squad for the rest of the season. A number of players continue to be linked, including the likes of Enzo Fernandez and Rafael Leao, while Benoit Badiashile is reported to be \"close\" to joining.\nWith that said, keep the blog on lock as we bring you all the latest Chelsea news.\nEnzo Fernandez skips Benfica training\nAs the transfer rumours continue linking him with a move to Chelsea, Enzo Fernandez has dropped a major hint regarding his future.\nReports earlier today had claimed the midfielder had spent New Years in Argentina, Portuguese outlet Record this evening have claimed the 21-year-old missed two training sessions today.\nBenfica are next in action on Friday evening against Portimonense.\nFee and personal terms agreed for Badiashile\nChelsea have agreed a €38million (£33.6million) deal with AS Monaco for centre-back Benoit Badiashile, football.london understands.\nThe defender will sign a six-and-a-half deal at Stamford Bridge after agreeing personal terms with Graham Potter's side. football.london understands that Badiashile is currently in London to undergo his medical after personal terms were signed.\nEnzo Fernandez 'done'\nEnzo Fernandez's January transfer move to Chelsea is reportedly 'done'.\nIt's rumoured that a structure of the deal has now been agreed with the Blues set to pay €120m (£105m) over three instalments and a further €10m (£8.8m) in performance related fees.\nThe midfielder missed two training sessions today after returning to Argentina for New Years.\nReece James understudy receives promotion\nChelsea star Reece James looks set to be absent for the month of January after suffering a knee injury against Bournemouth.\nCesar Azpilicueta replaced the Englishman in the second half of that game and was chosen to start at right back in the draw with Nottingham Forest.\nA transfer arrival in that position seems possible with Denzel Dumfries, Josip Juranovic, Nahuel Molina and Benjamin Pavard all heavily linked.\nHowever, Graham Potter could really focus on the youth at Stamford Bridge and promote someone from the academy into the first-team picture and he appears to have done exactly that.\nThe Chelsea Spot have revealed that Derrick Abu trained with the first-team squad today. His inclusion may have just been to allow an even balance of players in training with James absent, but if he impresses, a first-team matchday call up could be on the horizon.\nLukaku exit claim\nSpeaking to talkSPORT, Tony Cascarino revealed he thinks that Chelsea star Romelu Lukaku, who joined Inter on-loan, has played his last game for the club.\nHe said: “Graham Potter, I don’t think would want to take back Romelu Lukaku. I don’t think he fits in to how he wants to player football. Unfortunately, he had a really bad time at Chelsea, in my opinion,” said the former Blues front man.\n“I don’t know if we’ve seen the best at Romelu Lukaku. He played his best football at Inter Milan. You have to go quite a long way back in the Premier League. His numbers were good at Manchester United, but he didn’t play how Manchester United or the fans thought he should be playing to a certain style.\n“I don’t see a future back for Romelu Lukaku (at Chelsea). Don’t have a player who doesn’t want to come back.”\nIan Maatsen showing promising signs of following James and Mount\nLeft-back Ian Maatsen has continued his impressive loan spell with Championship leaders Burnley with two goals in their game at Swansea City today.\nThe first was a delicious chipped free-kick past Steven Benda in the 12th minute before the Dutch wing-back added a second 10 minutes later.\nMaatsen has only made one senior appearance for Chelsea, under Frank Lampard in 2019, and has spent the last two seasons on loan at Charlton Athletic and Coventry City. He's now on course to help steer Vincent Kompany's side to the Premier League and could follow Reece James in becoming a first team regular at Stamford Bridge on the back of a successful loan spell.\nNahuel Molina eyed as Reece James replacement\nThe absence of Reece James is a cruel blow for Chelsea with the Englishman confirmed as being out for a month following an injury suffered against Bournemouth on Boxing Day.\nThe Blues greatly missed James in the draw against Nottingham Forest on New Year's Day, but they may have discovered the ideal January replacement.\nSimon Phillips has revealed that Atletico's right back Nahuel Molina is being looked at along with Benjamin Pavard although there is nothing serious as of now.\nDumfries transfer battle\nManchester United and Chelsea could be embroiled in a bidding war to sign Inter star Denzel Dumfries, but Tottenham appear to hold the advantage in the transfer battle.\nItalian football reporter Marco Barzaghi claims there may be a bidding war between the two English giants for Dumfries. Inter would be willing to do business between £44.3million (€50m) and £53.1million (€60m).\nSpurs could hold the advantage over both clubs though with Barzaghi claiming the Antonio Conte's side could be willing to offer Emerson Royal as part of the deal.\nChelsea waiting on possible Arsenal transfer collapse\nChelsea will be keeping a keen eye on any developments involving Arsenal's pursuit of Mykhaylo Mudryk with the Blues also interested in the 21-year-old.\nGiven their summer interest, the Gunners are understandably favourites to sign the attacker but Shakhtar are tough negotiators and Edu could pull out of the deal if he doesn't feel the player is worth the fee the Ukrainian club are demanding.\nArsenal look to have put forward an improved offer for Mudryk but Todd Boehly could strike in a transfer hijack on Arsenal, as suggested by Fabrizio Romano.\nChelsea's surprising midfielder solution\nChelsea could have the answer to their midfield issue coming from an unlikely source. It's the centre of the pitch that has caused them most problems this season and has lead to the pursuit of Benfica's Enzo Fernandez.\nThe Argentina star is seen as one part of the solution to a lack of mobility in midfield available to Graham Potter but could cost as much as £106million due to his release clause, but despite his price, a different imminent arrival at Stamford Bridge has been tipped to succeed in west London.\nFind out who and why this player could be Chelsea's next midfield star by clicking here\nBellingham plan revealed\nThe 19-year-old had a brilliant World Cup with England but won't be making any decisions until after his season with Borussia Dortmund is finished. As for the Bundesliga outfit, Jan Aage Fjortoft has revealed what is coming up next for Bellingham.\nRead the full story here\nChelsea given transfer update on Caicedo and Mac Allister\nChelsea have been told by Brighton CEO Paul Barber the club are aware interest will arrive for both Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo.\nBoth have been linked with big-money moves to Stamford Bridge in a potential reunion with Graham Potter and Marc Cucurella and Barber has now given an update on the two players with the January transfer window now open.\nJamie Carragher makes Chelsea January transfer window prediction\nTransfer audition for Reece James replacement\nChelsea transfer target Josip Juranovic has been subbed on by Celtic in place of the injured Greg Taylor to make his first appearance since the World Cup.\nJuranovic helped Croatia on their way to a third-placed finish and his performances saw Chelsea spark an interest. The 27-year-old has come on at left back, perhaps showing Todd Boehly and Graham Potter he could cover both sides of the defence\nJuranovic absence explained\nCeltic manager Ange Postecoglou has revealed why Chelsea transfer target Josip Juranovic has been named on the bench for their Old Firm derby against Rangers.\nJuranovic had a tremendous World Cup and Postecoglou has explained why Juranovic has been named as a substitute.\nWhen asked why Johnson is starting ahead of Juranovic, he said: \"A combination of things. [Johnson] trained really well and Juri [Juranovic] is still not 100% and he's available if we need him.\"\nChelsea hope to complete Fernandez transfer this week\nChelsea have moved very quickly in their attempts to sign Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernandez who impressed at the World Cup with Argentina.\nFernandez has a £105million release clause but the Blues are willing to to pay close to £120million, however the structure of the deal remains unclear. Cesar Luis Merlo has now revealed talks have resumed between the two clubs with Chelsea hoping to complete the transfer this week.\nChelsea handed double injury boost\nRuben Loftus-Cheek has made his return to Chelsea training after overcoming the thigh issue sustained against Newcastle United in November – and there is hope Ben Chilwell can be reintegrated into the first team set-up after next week's Premier League clash against Fulham.\nLoftus-Cheek was forced off inside the opening five minutes of the 1-0 defeat at St James' Park on November 12 and undertook the majority of his recovery work during the World Cup break. He was included in the squad that travelled out to Abu Dhabi for warm-weather training but was not involved in the sessions put on by Potter and his coaching staff in the Middle East.\nRead the full story here\nChelsea's potential Reece James replacement on bench for Celtic\nGraham Potter and Todd Boehly are likely looking at potential Reece James alternatives in the January transfer window after the Englishman suffered another injury in his return match against Bournemouth.\nInter star Denzel Dumfries has been linked as a potential acquisition, while Celtic's Josip Juranovic, who enjoyed a superb World Cup with Croatia, has emerged as a possible target.\nCeltic face Rangers in an Old Firm derby today and Juranovic has been named on the bench by Ange Postecoglou despite the Celtic boss rubbishing claims of Juranovic leaving for Chelsea in January.\nMajor Kante contract update\nN'golo Kante may be a Chelsea player beyond June 2023 with significant developments taking place over terms for a new contract.\nThe Frenchman, who is currently recovering from a serious hamstring injury, looked destined to leave Stamford Bridge in the summer at the end of his contract.\nHowever, a proposal has since been submitted by the Blues to Kante which would see the two-time Premier League winner stay in west London for a few more seasons.\nFabrizio Romano now claims the situation is '50/50' but that Kante loves the club and is open to discussing a different salary.\nNewcastle eye Jorginho transfer as Boehly lines up Fernandez deal\nChelsea may have been expecting to face competition from Newcastle with transfers after their major takeover but perhaps nobody was ready for the on-field competition that has come under Eddie Howe. Sitting third in the league and nine points ahead of the Blues Newcastle have cemented themselves as serious top four challengers.\nWith innovative tactical moves supported by a set of vital incomings in January and the summer Newcastle have positioned themselves amongst the league's big boys once more. It hasn't quite been the Kylian Mbappe signings that some had envisioned upon the Saudi Investment Fund's takeover but it's been smart.\nDeals for Nick Pope, Kieran Trippier, Sven Botman, Bruno Guimaraes and Aleksander Isak have been completed whilst their current form makes them a genuine player when it comes to signing some of Chelsea's own targets. One that Howe has been asked about previously is the man at the centre of the attention now for Todd Boehly, Enzo Fernandez.\nRead the full story here\nEvery word from Graham Potter post-Forest\nRaheem Sterling saw his first half strike cancelled out by former Tottenham star Serge Aurier as Chelsea drew their opening game of 2023 against Nottingham Forest.\nGraham Potter spoke to the press after the result and in case you missed it, football.london has every word said by the Chelsea boss.\nRead more here\nJoao Felix latest\nJoao Felix looks increasingly likely to leave Atletico Madrid in the January transfer window. Felix's agent, Jorgen Mendes, is set to hold further talks with Premier League clubs now the transfer window has officially opened.\nThe 23-year-old forward has been told he can stay at Atletico Madrid should he wish, despite reports linking him with a move to Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United. Following Portugal's World Cup campaign, Felix has become a potential acquisition for a number of clubs with his Atletico Madrid future up in the air.\nChelsea are said to be weighing up a decision on whether to pursue a deal for the Portugal international, with Todd Boehly prepared to act swiftly to conclude a deal. The Gunners could certainly be tempted by a move for Felix as Edu and Mikel Arteta look set to enquire for a number of attackers in January for a possible Gabriel Jesus replacement following his knee injury.\nRead the full story, here.\nA World Cup winner targeted by Chelsea has returned\nFollowing his role in Argentina's World Cup victory, Alexis Mac Allister was given time off to rest and recover ahead of returning to Brighton in the new year.\nA number of Premier League clubs including Chelsea have registered an interest in the Brighton star and he has now returned to the South coast where he was greeted by seemingly all of of the Brighton squad and staff.\nSecret agent in Felix deal\nArsenal have a 'secret agent' they can use in negotiations to sign Atletico Madrid star Joao Felix on loan in January. The Gunners are in need of a new forward given Gabriel Jesus' injury leaving Mikel Arteta's attacking options weakened.\nAn injury to one of Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Eddie Nketiah would leave Arsenal severely short in attack making a new forward a priority area to strengthen. Mykhaylo Mudyrk is the number one target for the Gunners who saw a £55million bid, including add-ons, rejected last week with talks set to continue, football.london understands.\nRead the full story, here.\nFernandez debut vs Man City?\nChelsea fans didn't get the new year's gift they were hoping for after a drab 1-1 draw against relegation threatened Nottingham Forest. It means that Graham Potter has not recorded back-to-back league wins since October and his first three games in charge, as the gap to the top four opens up to seven points.\nErling Haaland has still scored more goals than the entire squad combined and pressure is mounting ahead of a tough January fixture list that will be navigated without Reece James available. The saving grace throughout this period is that the transfer window is open once more and new signings can be made.\nRead the full story, here.\nJoao Felix obstacle\nArsenal and Chelsea are among the clubs to be approached over signing Atletico Madrid forward Joao Felix on loan until the end of the season. Manchester United have also been courted, but the finances involved in any deal for the Portuguese star may prove to be an issue.\nFelix was signed by Atleti back in 2019 after the 23-year-old completed a £110million transfer, but his return of just 34 goals and 18 assists in 130 appearances falls way below expectation. Many have questioned Felix's move to Atletico considering how Diego Simeone sets his team up to play, with some pundits suggesting the Portugal international would suit a more attacking style.\nRead the full story, here.\nCaicedo bid\nChelsea will have to remain calm in a busy and frantic January transfer window as a crucial time in the club's immediate future comes into prominence. Although some good proactive work has been done to add youth to the squad in an attempt to shore up future squads there is a more pressing need for players.\nFive players that featured against Nottingham Forest were 30 or older despite the plan being to transform Chelsea into a younger and hungrier set of players. That takes time, but January offers an opportunity to make amends for previous failures.\nWith Enzo Fernandez now the main priority for the window Chelsea are moving quickly to get a deal done for the 21-year-old World Cup star. He has become their top target for the winter but isn't an easy move to get over the line. With a massive release clause and wider competition for his signature, Chelsea are under pressure to complete the signing.\nRead the full story, here.\nMoments missed\nIt was a frustrating evening for Chelsea as they took on Nottingham Forest at the City Ground and returned to some familiar ways. Graham Potter's side were unable to challenge the opposition goal often enough or find much fluency on the first day of the year as they stumbled to a 1-1 draw.\nRaheem Sterling opened the scoring when a Christian Pulisic cross caused an obscure deflection from Willy Boly leading to the ball hitting the crossbar for the England international to blast into the net. The Blues were in a good position just after the 15-minute mark but the home side fought their way back into the game, and when the sides returned for the second half, Steve Cooper's team went well into the ascendancy.\nSerge Aurier finished well when Chelsea were unable to clear a corner and while Potter made plenty of changes, it could be argued that Forest had the better chances despite the Blues superior possession. Potter gave credit to the opposition for their second half performance.\nRead the full story, here.\nGoncalo Ramos interest\nA wide forward is all well and good, but what Chelsea really need is to add a prolific striker to the squad. Their best striker right now is essentially Kai Havertz, who isn't a striker. The move that the fans would really love to see happen would be Victor Osimhen from Napoli.\nNapoli are unlikely to sell in January but they do tend to listen to high offers and not stand in the way of departures. Other options to explore for Chelsea could be Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic or Benfica's Goncalo Ramos.\nRead the full story from 90min, here.\nInjury latest\nChelsea got their 2023 underway with a difficult away game against Nottingham Forest, who had earned 11 of their 13 points at home before the clash. The Blues got off to an ideal start though, with a bit of fortune as Willy Boly's clearance was turned onto the bar, only for Raheem Sterling to score the rebound.\nThe second half wasn't quite as simple though as former Tottenham defender Serge Aurier bundled the ball into the back of the net to draw Forest level. The home side seemed much more likely to earn all three points come the end, but were unable to find the breakthrough as both teams settled for a point.\nThe Blues end the gameweek sitting in eighth, with a number of tough fixtures ahead of them in the next few weeks that could provide a huge challenge in the pursuit of a top four finish. Some key players remain absent for Graham Potter, who will need them to return swiftly for a return to form.\nRead the full story, here.",
