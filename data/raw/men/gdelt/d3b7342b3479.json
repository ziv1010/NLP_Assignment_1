Nonetheless, the club’s technical director was delighted the 25-year-old gets to stay.\n“We needed to act on the transfer market, as we changed some players, changed some of the characteristics and the structure of the side to give the coach more options. There are high expectations, so by starting to win tonight in the Coppa Italia, then there’s the Champions League and Serie A, we need to step up a level,” Moncada said about Milan’s transfer activity in the just-concluded winter transfer window as revealed by Football Italia.\nMilan signed Kyle Walker, Santiago Gimenez, and Joao Felix during the winter transfer window, while they let go of Noah Okafor and Alvaro Morata.\nThe pair joined Napoli and Galatasaray respectively.\nMoncada also revealed there’s a chance the Portuguese could stay permanently beyond his loan spell, whilst maintaining delight at Chukwueze’s position.\n“It depends on us and him (Felix), there is always a possibility. We have a very good rapport with Chelsea, so we’ll see in the summer. No, he (Chukwueze) is staying with us and represents another option on the right. We’re happy he gets to stay,” Milan’s technical director concluded.\nSamuel Chukwueze remained on the bench in Milan’s 3-1 win over AS Roma on Wednesday night in the Coppa Italia. Rossoneri are now in the semi-final of the Italian Cup",
