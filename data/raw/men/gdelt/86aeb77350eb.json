  "body_text": "Enzo Maresca leaves position as Chelsea head coach\nBy Edward Elliot, Press Association\nEnzo Maresca has left his role as Chelsea head coach after 18 months in charge.\nThe Italian departs with the club fifth in the Premier League table – 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal – following one win from their last seven top-flight games.\nSpeculation about Maresca’s future had intensified during the poor run of form amid reports he endured a strained relationship with key figures at Stamford Bridge.\n“Chelsea Football Club and head coach Enzo Maresca have parted company,” read a club statement.\n“With key objectives still to play for across four competitions including qualification for Champions League football, Enzo and the club believe a change gives the team the best chance of getting the season back on track.”\nFormer Leicester boss Maresca was appointed as successor to Mauricio Pochettino in June 2024.\nThe 45-year-old guided Chelsea to Champions League qualification via a fourth-placed finish last season, in addition to winning the Conference League and Club World Cup.\nHis contract was due to run until 2029, with the club holding an option for a further 12 months.\nMaresca’s final match was Tuesday evening’s 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth.\nAmid reports of tension behind the scenes, he missed his post-match press conference following that game, albeit his absence was attributed to illness.\nChelsea return to action on Sunday away to Manchester City, the first of nine fixtures across four competitions during a packed January schedule.\nLiam Rosenior, the head coach of French club Strasbourg, who are owned by Chelsea’s parent company BlueCo, has emerged as the early favourite to replace Maresca among bookmakers.\nFormer Barcelona head coach Xavi, Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner, Fulham’s Marco Silva and Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola are other potential candidates.",
