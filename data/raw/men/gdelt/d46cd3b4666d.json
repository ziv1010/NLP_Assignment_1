The Chelsea shotstopper does superbly to deny McNeil’s effort which looked destined for the bottom corner.\nSuperb agility to keep the hosts ahead.\nChelsea 1-0 Everton\n85 mins: OFFSIDE! Jackson bundles home the rebound from Cucurella’s effort but the offside flag goes up straight away on the Chelsea forward.\nChelsea 1-0 Everton\n82 mins: Into the final ten minutes we head and there’s a slightly uneasy feeling around Stamford Bridge. It’s been rather comfortable up to this point but, boy, would they love a second goal to make things less nervy.\nChelsea 1-0 Everton\n78 mins: Another change for the hosts as Sancho comes on for the impressive Madueke.\nChelsea 1-0 Everton\n74 mins: SAVE! A wonderful run from Madueke off the left flank, but it’s an equally wonderful save from Pickford who tips the effort around the post to keep his side in the match.\nChelsea 1-0 Everton\n67 mins: Superb technique from Gueye to volley and effort on goal, but it’s straight down the throat of Sanchez who makes the save.\nChelsea 1-0 Everton\n66 mins: And Chelsea turn to their bench now, as Lavia makes way for James.

Out of nothing, Everton fashion a good opportunity on the turnover, but it’s a strong hand from Sanchez down to his right to deny Beto’s well-hit strike.\nChelsea 1-0 Everton\n59 mins: Chelsea still pressing forward looking for that two-goal cushion. Palmer has still been unusually quiet in this game, with all the threat coming from Madueke and Neto down the respective flanks.\nChelsea 1-0 Everton\n55 mins: Madueke stands a nice ball up to the back post but Mykolenko heads it clear with Neto waiting to pounce beyond him.\nChelsea 1-0 Everton\n50 mins: A brighter start from Everton in this half, who appear happy to throw a bit more caution to the wind as they search for an equaliser. A poor ball into the box sails out for a goal-kick, however, and their attack breaks down.\nChelsea 1-0 Everton\n47 mins: A great driving run from Neto brings him inside the area, but Branthwaite is in the right place again to block it out for a corner.\nChelsea 1-0 Everton\n46 mins: And we’re back underway after the break. Everton make a change as Alcaraz replaces Ndiaye.\nMORE: Jose Mourinho prediction made by Joe Cole amid Leeds United speculation\nMORE: Why Enzo Maresca is not in the dugout for Chelsea vs Everton\nMORE: Alan Shearer’s Premier League predictions including Bournemouth vs Man Utd",
