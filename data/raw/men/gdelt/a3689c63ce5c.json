This means that Liverpool will have more funds to use on another midfielder.\nLiverpool’s midfielders didn’t chip in with many goal contributions last season and Klopp is keen to rectify that next season.\nThe club also want to sign a more defensive-minded midfielder, but adding another attacking midfielder does also interest Klopp.\nBorussia Monchengladbach’s Manu Kone and Nice’s Khephren Thuram are top targets for Liverpool in the more defensive role.\nHowever, Celta Vigo’s Gabri Veiga is also a player they are interested in. Fabrizio Romano has clarified the latest details of their midfield hunt.\n“I think that they are completely different players,” Romano told CaughtOffside when discussing Veiga as an alternative to Thuram.\n“Liverpool have a list of different players: Manu Kone, Thuram and Gabri Veiga. I think based on the fee and the opportunities that they will find in the market, they will decide what kind of opportunity they will attack.\n“So at the moment, it is not something decided. Thuram remains in conversations with Liverpool, same for Manu Kone and his agents who are having conversations and exchanges with Liverpool. Gabri Veiga is appreciated, they are tracking him; so this is the situation at the moment, nothing else.”\nLiverpool need a good window\nThere’s no doubt that Liverpool fell below expectations this season as they missed out on the top four.\nVeiga would be an exciting addition for Liverpool without doubt. In La Liga this season, the 21-year-old scored 11 goals and provided four assists.\nHis defensive output is also admirable, winning an average of 1.2 tackles per game. Veiga is contracted with Celta Vigo until the summer of 2026.\nTime will tell if the lack of Champions League football will cost them in the transfer market, but Klopp’s side should still be able to attract some top targets.\nThey have made an excellent start to their business with Mac Allister. However, there is still plenty of work to be done in this window.\nAlong with signing some midfield reinforcements, Liverpool also have their sights set on some other positions.\nKlopp is keen to strengthen Liverpool’s backline and the club could still sign another forward to replace Roberto Firmino.\nIt is worth considering that Liverpool will have the added burden of Europa League football to contend with next season.\nAs the Reds will be working with a more congested fixture list, it will be important that they have adequate depth in every department.\nREAD MORE: Liverpool ‘move on’ from £38m midfield target as Klopp switches focus to two solid alternatives",
