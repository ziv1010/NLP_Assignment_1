The elite even have streets renamed in their honour.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nNewcastle Jets faithful are no different.\nThe Jets celebrate their 20th year in the A-League this season and the Newcastle Herald tasked you the fans to select the club's greatest XI of all time.\nIn total, 239 players have taken the field for the Jets in the A-League during the past 20 years.\nThe club has recorded one championship, one grand final defeat, one Asian Champions League campaign, six ownership changes and burned through 13 coaches.\nIn selecting the greatest team in club history, the fans were hooked on one common line - winning.\nOf the 11 players, split into five positional categories, only one did not feature in either the 2008 grand final triumph or the 2018 heart-breaker.\nHigh-velocity winger Andrew Nabbout helped propel the Jets to second on the ladder in 2017-18 only to sign a lucrative team with Japanese powerhouse Uruwar Red Diamonds a month before the final series.\nGoalkeeper Ante Covic was the easiest selection for the fans, securing 59 per cent of the vote.\nFellow 2008 championship-winning alumni Joel Griffiths was also a clear winner, topping the strikers at 43 percent.\nIndeed, there were six players from that glorious day on February 24, 2008, when they beat the Mariners in the decider to feature in the 11.\nLikewise, seven doubled up from the Newcastle Herald's Jets team of the decade selected by a panel of judges in 2015.\nJason Hoffman, at left back, is the only home-grown player on the 20-year list.\nHowever, Taree-born Jade North was from Northern NSW, while Joel Griffiths, Nikolai Topor-Stanley, Matt Thompson and Roy O'Donovan have long called Newcastle home.\nIrish striker Roy O'Donovan is the only import to feature.\nNot surprisingly, the championship winning outfit of 2008 secured 79 per cent of the vote for best team.\nHowever, Ernie Merrick, who took the squad from a wooden spoon to within a VAR malfunction of a premiership, was the pick for coach ahead of Gary van Egmond.\nFans were given a list of nominations to complete the best XI.\nThe Herald compiled a list of contenders in five categories - one goalkeeper, two fullbacks, two central defenders, four midfield and two strikers.\nThe players with the highest percentage of votes in each position earned selection.\nIn determining the contenders, factors including number of games for the club, success of the teams played in, loyalty, versatility and statistical evidence were all considered but not the be-all and end-all.\nBelow Herald football writer James Gardiner casts an eye over the selections.\nGoalkeeper - Ante Covic (59 per cent): The fans were spot on here. Covic had been at a World Cup with the Socceroos before joining the Jets. He was everything you want in a keeper - great shot stopper, organiser and a big presence. He played a massive role in the championship win. Mark Birighitti was next best at 23 per cent. He was a two-time player of the year for the club, but they were in losing teams. Others: Ben Kennedy (11 per cent), Glenn Moss (5), Ryan Scott (1)\nCentral defenders - Nikolai Topor-Stanley (40), Jade North (19): There were quality candidates at the back, but these two deserved selection. Topor-Stanley won the first of his two player-of-the-year awards in 2010-11. But he was twice the player in his second stint after four years at Wanderers. A left-sided player, he brings balance as well as composure, mobility, aerial strength and leadership. Jade North captained the Jets to the club's only championship. He became a Socceroos regular with 41 caps. Nigel Boogaard (16) was unlucky to miss out. He wore the captain's armband for five years and lead a cultural change. Andrew Durante (14) was man of the match in the 2008 grand final triumph. Others: Ljubo Milicevic (8), Kew Jaliens (2).\nFullbacks - Tarek Elrich (41), Jason Hoffman (28): The only thing missing with these two is a left foot. Elrich burst onto the scene as a teenager. He was the proto-type of a modern-day fullback. A former attacker, he got up and down the touchline and famously scored an injury-time match-winner to book the Jets a place in the 2008 GF. He was the first to notch 100 appearances and remains fourth on the all-time games list with 127. Hoffman is the only player to feature in both grand finals and retired last year as the club's most capped player with 209 games. Others Daniel Georgevski (21), Lucas Mauragis (5), Mateo Corbo (3) Dane Ingham (3).\nMidfielders - Nicky Carle (21), Dimi Petratos (19), Matt Thompson (11), Andrew Nabbout (11): By far the most competitive position. The fans clearly had attack in mind. Carle was a once-in-a-generation talent. A wizard with the ball at his feet, he collected the Johnny Warren Medal in 2007 and scored arguably the greatest goal in A-league history. Petratros was very similar in design. A bums-on-seat No.10, deadly from dead-ball situation and a true game-breaker. Thompson is another centurion (110 games), championship winner and former captain. He was used in a variety of roles but played his best football in the middle of the park. He had a high work rate and was equally adept at breaking up play or threading a pass. Nabbout resurrected his career at the Jets. A power-packed winger, he scored 18 goals in 46 games and added a new element to the attack. The could make strong cases for a number of others. Musialik (10) was in the team of the decade, Brazilian Penha (10) set the league alight with four goals and 11 assists in one season. Others: Steve Ugarkovic (9), Angus Thurgate (8), Ruben Zadkovich (6).\nStrikers - Joel Griffiths (43), Roy O'Donovan (16) - Griffiths propelled the Jets to a championship, were the A-League player of the year and Golden Boot winner, had a street renamed, albeit with spray paint, in his honour, and, at his peak rivalled Joey Johns for popularity in Newcastle. O'Dovovan won a photo finish to be Griffiths' strike partner. The Irishman polled 16.04 per cent to nudge Adam Taggart (15.9). A classic goal-poacher, O'Donovan netted 31 goals in 71 games to sit second, three behind Griffiths, on the club's all-time goal-scorers list. He was particularly lethal against arch-rivals Central Coast, scoring eight goals in 11 derbies. Taggart scored a then record 16 goals - more than half of the team's tally of 30 - in 2013-14. Apostolos Stamatelopoulos bettered that mark with 17 last campaign. The Jets failed to make the finals in either year. Others: Mark Bridge (11), Beka Mikeltadze (2).",
