  "body_text": "The morning after a European match-winning goal: Shamrock Rovers hero Michael Noonan (16) heads back to school\nTeenage hero, Michael Noonan, has been pictured heading back to school this morning after scoring Shamrock Rovers’ winning goal in Europe last night.\nThe 16-year-old scored the game’s only goal in the 57th minute on his debut against Molde in Norway in the first-leg of their Conference League clash.\nThe striker has now become the youngest goal scorer ever in a European club competition at just 16 years and 197 days.\nHowever, there was no time to waste, as the youngster was pictured on his way back to school, brandishing his schoolbag this morning.\nHis mother, Sandie Noonan, posted a picture of her son to X this morning, captioned “And back to school he goes”, adding that “he has a half day”.\nAnd back to school he goes ... @ShamrockRovers @LeagueofIreland @PremSportsIRL pic.twitter.com/T8fL6SN46b\n— Sandie Noonan (@sandie_noonan) February 14, 2025\nLast night, following her son’s goal, she said: “I think it's safe to say I'm the proudest Mam in the whole world tonight.”\nNoonan has now become the youngest scorer in a major UEFA club competition since the formats changed in 1992.\nHis accolade sees off high-profile players like Ansu Fati (Champions League) and Romelu Lukaku (Europa League) in the record books.\nRovers fans were eagerly awaiting the arrival of Noonan on the field, given his age and profile and the fact that Manchester City are one of many potential suitors.\nRead more\nAfter a nervy start, he became a bigger threat as the game went on, with Danny Mandroiu showing some clever touches and Watts becoming more prominent.\nAll of this was relevant to a game-changing moment with the trio combining for Noonan to dart into space and anticipate that a touch would test Valdemar Lund who dived in and received a red card.\nBut it was in the 57th minute, when Watts stole the ball in the Molde box and crossed for Noonan who reacted quickest to grab the game’s winner.\nManager Stephen Bradley said afterwards that the decision to pick Noonan was only made a fortnight ago, although he only told the player this week.\n“He’s a throwback, he just wants to play. He doesn’t care if it’s in front of 200 people at Bray away, Molde away in front of 4,000 or in front of 30,000 at the Aviva,” Bradley said.\n“He doesn’t care, he just sees football. If he keeps that attitude, he’s got a right chance.”\nRovers will now bring a one-goal lead back to next Thursday’s decider in Tallaght for the chance of a last-16 place in the Conference League.",
