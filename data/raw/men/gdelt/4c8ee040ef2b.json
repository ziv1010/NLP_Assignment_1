  "body_text": "JOHANNESBURG-(MaraviPost)-Gaborone United Ladies have been crowned champions of the CAF Women’s Champions League (COSAFA qualifiers) after edging Zesco Ndola Girls of Zambia 4-3 on penalties in a final played on Sunday afternoon in Johannesburg, South Africa.\nThe match lived up to its billing as a clash between two of Southern Africa’s strongest women’s football sides. Both teams displayed tactical discipline and resilience, but the 90 minutes of regulation time, plus extra time, register 1-1 and couldn’t produce a winner as the game ended.\nIn the decisive penalty shootout, the Botswana giants held their nerve. Goalkeeper emerged as the heroine, making a crucial save that gave her side the advantage.\nGaborone United Ladies then converted their final spot-kick to seal the 4-3 victory and send their players, technical staff, and fans into wild celebrations.\nThis victory means Gaborone United Ladies will represent the COSAFA region at the CAF Women’s Champions League finals later this year, where they will join other regional winners to compete for continental glory.\nIt is a historic achievement for Botswana women’s football, as the country continues to make its mark on the African stage.\nThe COSAFA Women’s Champions League qualifiers continue to provide a platform for the growth of women’s football in the region, giving teams and players the exposure and experience needed to compete at the highest levels on the continent.",
