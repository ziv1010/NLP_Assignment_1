  "body_text": "The Premier League was a world drifting out of view for Calvin Bassey in 2015. Over three years, the teenager had been turned down by Crystal Palace, West Ham United, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Leyton Orient, Charlton Athletic (twice) and Barnet.\nBassey believed he could still make it in professional football, but with his final year at school about to start, he could see the cliff edge.\nAdvertisement\nThe only tangible evidence of his dream being possible was Jermain Defoe, whose nephew he was playing cage football with around that time in Newham, east London.\n“I gave myself one final summer. I said to myself, ‘I’m going all out, and if I don’t get a club I am quitting’. I meant it,” the Fulham defender tells The Athletic.\nEventually, the 15-year-old Bassey got a do-or-die trial at Leicester City.\n“Leicester had 12 or 13 left-backs trial before me, who all got rejected,” he says. “I didn’t think I had a chance but that was the best thing that happened. I played freely.\n“I couldn’t believe it when I got signed. I was late for school but I couldn’t give a toss. The teachers were like, ‘Where have you been?’, and I said, ‘Sir, I was a bit busy signing with Leicester’. They thought I was lying until I showed them the picture.”\nBassey is now the poster boy of what can be achieved through persistence and resilience, a new generation’s Defoe for the kids now playing where they both grew up.\nNot only did Bassey go on to call Defoe ‘uncle’ while they were team-mates at Scottish side Rangers for three seasons, this summer he realised his dream of becoming a Premier League player. Fulham paid more than £20million ($25.3m) to sign him from Ajax, matching the fee that took him to the Dutch club from Rangers a year earlier.\nThe Amsterdam-based four-time European Cup winners had never spent so much on a defender, but during Rangers’ six-month run to the 2021-22 Europa League final, Bassey transformed from a utility player to a cornerstone of Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s team at centre-back.\nHis then-team-mate Scott Arfield credits Bassey’s athleticism as the sole reason Rangers excelled as underdogs in knockout wins over Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig en route to that final defeat on penalties by Eintracht Frankfurt. It is fitting that the launchpad of his career followed the theme of his life.\nAdvertisement\nThe biggest obstacle in his formative years was not football rejection — it was the gang culture that has become an epidemic in certain areas of London — particularly in Newham, where it was estimated in 2021 that 20 gangs were in operation with 5,000 affiliated members.\n“Going to Leicester for training on Mondays and Tuesdays (a two-hour-plus drive north from London) instead of chilling with the wrong crowd was big for me,” says Bassey.\n“There was a period in Newham when it was like a war zone. Kids were being stabbed left, right and centre. I lost two mates. Both went to my school and were shot dead. One of them got shot right next to my cousin’s house when I was 17. He was 19.\n“Where I was from, there were only two ways: you end up in a gang or you played football. The guys who were my friends at the time were just boys I grew up with, I didn’t know if they were good or bad.\n“There have been situations where if I made the wrong decision I could have been in big trouble with the police but the discipline of football helped, knowing I had to be home early to recover and sleep, before games. (Signing for) Leicester was perfect timing.\n“You think, ‘Ah s**t, people know who I am’ (with his status), but I’m not as accessible as I was,” Bassey says. “People don’t really know where I live or where my mum lives, so I’m calmer. I think more about what the kids can take from me. Realising that they don’t need to get distracted, put the work in and have faith, they can get to where they want, like I did.”\nBassey credits the influence of his mother, Mercy, as the key to his work ethic and he sought to pay her back using his first contract at Rangers in 2020, having joined them that summer at age 20 before making a senior Leicester appearance.\n“It’s every kid’s dream to be able to get their family a home, so I moved them out of the area,” Bassey says. “I said I was going to but don’t think she thought I would — at least not five months after signing.\nAdvertisement\n“She was praying and jumping up and down. It was disbelief, but I was happy to put a smile on her face as she sacrificed a lot for us boys.”\nHe now goes by the surname Bassey but before he became a senior player, team sheets would often refer to him by his father’s surname — Ughelumba.\nHis parents are Nigerian and moved to Italy — where Bassey was born, on the final day of the previous century — but his mum came to London with her four sons alone after his dad left home.\n“He’s just not in my life — we lived with him but that was when I was really young,” Bassey says. “Since I was six, it has been Mum and us boys. I knew that if I got the chance to put my name on the back of a shirt I wanted it to be my mum’s name — my way of saying thank you.\n“It feels like a dream sometimes when we are driving back from games. It’s crazy that we used to speak about playing in the Premier League five, six years ago and I’m there now. It’s a blessing. We all go to church on Sundays now, and my faith growing since I was 16 has brought us closer together.”\nIn Bassey’s first two seasons at Rangers, he was mostly a backup under manager Steven Gerrard.\nA difficult day playing left-back in a shock League Cup defeat to St Mirren in December 2020 and a breach of Covid-19 restrictions a few months later, which saw him banned for four games, damaged his progress, then a poor display in a Europa League game away to Sparta Prague early in the 2021-22 season convinced many that his future was not as a centre-back either.\nHe had started just 18 first-team games when Van Bronckhorst took over as manager two months later, after Gerrard left to manage Aston Villa in the Premier League. Within two years, he has been transferred for a combined total of more than £40m.\n“What a guy — from the first game, Gio said, ‘Calvin, you’re playing’,” Bassey says. “He said he trusted me, he knew I had some things to work on but he wanted me to go out and enjoy it. He didn’t make me stronger or faster, he just gave me confidence.\nAdvertisement\n“We were losing 1-0 to Leipzig after the first leg of the semi-final and we (the Rangers players) were arguing, but then he came in so chilled. He said, ‘Calm. We’re going to see them at home’. Ibrox was our fortress. We could win any game. I’ve played at a lot of grounds now but none are as loud or intense. Not a lot of players have experienced it so they can be rattled, no matter who it is.”\nThe one-on-one defending ability he displayed against teams such as Dortmund, Braga, Leipzig and the competition’s eventual winners Frankfurt convinced Ajax he was the man to lead them into Champions League action the next season.\nHe got sent off on his debut, a 5-3 defeat to PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch version of the pre-season Community Shield, so was suspended for the first two Eredivisie games but his arrival into the starting XI saw Ajax win seven of the next nine.\nHeavy defeats against Napoli and Liverpool in the Champions League group stage coincided with stuttering form in the league before the break in November and December for the World Cup. Former Ajax players including Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart questioned Bassey’s suitability for the club’s style of playing — the latter even offering to drive him to new club Fulham.\n“I had become a £20million-plus player so I felt like I was trying to prove a point, but to who? At the start, we were flying, but we almost started too well,” Bassey says.\n“I didn’t have the chance to fail a bit, then get better. I had come for a lot of money and wasn’t the finished product so it was easy to pick on me. I wasn’t Dutch and came from a league not as good technically. I was the one to get picked on and they didn’t give me the time to adapt, which even Edwin van der Sar (then sporting director) said.\n“It was so different. Rarely do you get a centre-back running into the No 6 position in the Premier League, it’s just not done. Because Ajax always had the ball, you don’t get punished as much. It is not easy to adjust to.\nAdvertisement\n“I moved to Fulham at the right time. I can build under a manager (Marco Silva) who wants to play football.”\nThe next box Bassey is likely to tick in his career is playing at a major tournament, assuming he goes to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) next month with Nigeria.\nBassey, along with Fulham team-mates Tosin Adarabioyo and Alex Iwobi, is one of many players in their squad to also have grown up being eligible for England, with Joe Aribo, Ola Aina, Ademola Lookman and Bright Osayi-Samuel all growing up in London.\n“We spend a lot of time together, so the others in the squad call us the ‘Innit’ Boys (because they use the word so much in conversation). Even though most of us didn’t live there or grow up there, a lot of our parents are first-generation immigrants so most of us have grown up in African households eating traditional food.\n“Every time I land in Nigeria, I realise that football is like life for them — like it is in Brazil. We are like superstars.”\nBassey, now up to 10 caps since his debut in March last year, found out how volatile Nigerians’ emotions can be when it comes to the game after they narrowly missed out on the most recent World Cup, losing to local rivals Ghana on the now-scrapped away goals rule in a qualification play-off for one of Africa’s five allotted places in the finals.\n“It was crazy,” Bassey says of the second leg, a 1-1 draw in front of 60,000 people in the Nigerian capital Abuja. “I remember the final whistle going and then this noise. You could hear the anger, you could feel it. There were bottles being thrown onto the pitch, so we just ran down the tunnel into the dressing room. The police took us in and shut it off.\n“It’s hard, as you want to ask if that reaction was necessary, but we were fuming and they deserved to be angry.”\nNigeria face Equatorial Guinea, host nation Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissua in the group stage at AFCON and are aiming to win the competition for the fourth time, and first since 2013, but they are struggling for form, having drawn 1-1 in their first two 2026 World Cup qualifiers last month against Lesotho and Zimbabwe. “We know that we’ve been underperforming,” Bassey says. “We’ve got easily the best team on paper.”\nAdvertisement\nAfter Egypt’s Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane of Senegal, Napoli striker Victor Osimhen is arguably the tournament’s next biggest star. He has 20 goals in 27 caps for Nigeria and will be key to how far they go in their bid to make the February 11 final.\n“He is a joke — the only striker I know who can run a back line by himself,” says Bassey.\n“He can run in behind, he can head, finish, he can do everything. The Prem would suit him. Hopefully, he comes at some point but I’d rather have him in my team than against him!”\n(Top photo: Jordan Campbell/The Athletic)",
