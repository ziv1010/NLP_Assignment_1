The pair previously worked together at Ajax.\nHowever, Onana's time at Old Trafford has been largely dominated by costly gaffes which have contributed to Man Utd's poor start to the 2023/24 season.\nSpeaking ahead of Sunday's trip to Liverpool, Onana told Sky Sports: \"If I have to speak about my season so far for Manchester United, I am not happy because I know I can do much much better, I've done it and I know I will do it better than what is happening now.\n\"We are not facing a good moment. I hope things will change as soon as possible.\n\"But listen, you want to tell me in six months the best goalkeeper in the Champions League last season can become the worst in the world? Nah.\n\"Everything is temporary. I know it'll be alright. If not today, it will be tomorrow, if not tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.\"\nManager Ten Hag is under increased pressure following recent disappointing defeats to Bournemouth and Bayern Munich but Onana has backed his boss to deliver, referring back to their successful spell together in the Netherlands.\nHe added: \"We had a successful period with Ajax. We reached the semi-finals of the Champions League and played brilliant football from the back.\n\"He's a good manager. I like the way he works, the way he communicates with the players.\"\nMan Utd are seventh in the Premier League heading into Sunday's match at Anfield and will be missing captain Bruno Fernandes due to suspension.",
