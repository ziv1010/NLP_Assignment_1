  "body_text": "Chelsea are lining up a stunning summer move for Aston Villa and England star Morgan Rogers, according to reports.\nRogers has been one of the standout players in the Premier League this season, scoring eight goals and making a further eight assists.\nThe 22-year-old also impressed during Villa’s run to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, scoring four goals – including a hat-trick against Celtic – and providing two assists.\nRogers may have been fearing the worst when he was released by Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City in 2023 but he revived his career in the Championship at Middlesbrough.\nAston Villa spent £15m to sign Rogers at the start of 2024 and his resurgence has continued at the Midlands club, resulting in an England call-up.\nRogers made his debut for the Three Lions in November and is expected to be a key member of Thomas Tuchel’s squad at next year’s World Cup.\nThe midfielder’s form has also caught the attention of Chelsea, who have identified Rogers as a target ahead of the summer transfer window.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nThe Blues are keen to add more goals and creativity to their squad and are lining up a move for Rogers, according to The Independent.\nWhile Chelsea hope to bring Rogers to Stamford Bridge, the report adds that Aston Villa have no intention of selling the player and view him as a star for the future.\nVilla may, however, be forced to offload some players given their substantial wage bill and desire to turn Marcus Rashford’s loan move into a permanent transfer.\nQualifying for the Champions League will improve the club’s financial situation but Aston Villa are seventh – three points outside the Champions League places – with four games remaining.\nVilla were eyeing an extraordinary and historic season just a few weeks ago but have since been knocked out of the Champions League by PSG and lost their FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace.\nUnai Emery’s side were also beaten 2-1 by Manchester City last week in a potentially decisive blow in the race for Champions League football.\nSpeaking ahead of that game, City boss Guardiola was asked about Rogers’ impressive form and development since leaving the Etihad Stadium.\nMore Trending\n‘He was in the second team, and trained sometimes with us, and we could see something there,’ Guardiola said.\n‘But the impact he’s had in Villa, what a player, we had an exceptional player here, absolutely.’\nAs well as targeting Rogers, Chelsea have also been heavily linked with summer moves for Liam Delap and Dean Huijsen.\nChelsea enjoyed a superb first-half to the season – briefly threatening to rival Liverpool for the title – but have since slipped to fifth.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Arsenal slammed over ’embarrassing’ tifo after defeat to Paris Saint-Germain in Champions League\nMORE: Djurgardens IF make complaint ahead of Chelsea clash in UEFA Conference League\nMORE: Chelsea star submits transfer request after Arsenal approach in January",
