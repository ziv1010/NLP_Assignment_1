So last Saturday was a slip up and we still survived and we're still in the eighth.\n\"We win our next three and we keep winning we will be okay, so you just got to be careful. We're at eight and it's totally in our control. As I say the destiny is in our hands, we just got to keep winning.\"\nThe last time the Drua played at the National Stadium in Suva a sell-out crowd packed every inch of the space available for sitting.\nByrne said they expect the same turnout on Saturday and the players owe a lot to the fans who have been faithful to the team.\n\"We know how much you love the team and we know you turn up every week loud and supportive,\" he said.\n\"Rest assured that you've been spoken about at the beginning of the week about what we owe you and we'll turn up Saturday and reward you with a performance that matches your performance.\"\nThe Drua have named a strong lineup to face what Byrne said will be a \"tough, physical side\".\nFacing qualification for the top eight in 2023 the Drua defeated the Reds at the same venue and won their first quarterfinal spot in the competition.\nByrne said the same is still possible this weekend and the team's destiny is now in their hands.\nYoung Waqa Nalaga will get his first start at number 12 and will pair with his Fiji Under-20 partner Isaiah Washington Ravula.\nRetained this week are Tevita Ikanivere, Mesake Doge, Mesake Vocevoce, Isoa Nasilasila, Kitione Salawa, Armstrong-Ravula, Selestino Ravutaumada, Masi and Ilaisa Droasese.\nProp Jone Koroiduadua returns after sitting out his suspension.\nDrua play the Reds at 2.05pm on Saturday.\nFijian Drua match-day 23: 1. Jone Koroiduadua, 2. Tevita Ikanivere (c), 3. Mesake Doge, 4. Mesake Vocevoce, 5.Isoa Nasilasila, 6.Etonia Waqa, 7. Kitione Salawa, 8. Elia Canakaivata, 9. Simione Kuruvoli, 10. Isaiah Armstrong-Ravula, 11. Epeli Momo, 12. Waqa Nalaga, 13. Iosefo Masi, 14. Selestino Ravutaumada, 15. Ilaisa Droasese; Reserves: 16. Mesulame Dolokoto, 17. Emosi Tuqiri, 18. Samu Tawake, 19. Te Ahiwaru Cirikidaveta, 20. Vilive Miramira, 21. Peni Matawalu, 22. Kemu Valetini, 23. Taniela Rakuro.\nReds chase top four finish\nThe Reds have named winger Floyd Aubrey to start for the first time as part of sweeping changes by Les Kiss in a must-win game for the Queensland Reds' top-four Super Rugby Pacific hopes.\nKiss has moved winger Tim Ryan to the bench and is resting Mac Grealy.\n\"I'm a big believer in giving young players a go when they are good,\" Kiss explained to AAP.\n\"Tim Ryan has been proving that but it's also about managing their exposure the right way at this level. He'll have the chance to attack this game from the bench.\"\nSuliasi Vunivalu will start on the other wing, and Seru Uru returns from a broken thumb on the bench.\nTest hooker Matt Faessler and banged-up No.13 Josh Flook have also been rested.\nJosh Nasser and Taj Annan will replace that pair, while Tate McDermott will start at halfback and James O'Connor shapes as a key late-game figure off the bench.\nTwo wins behind the fourth-placed Chiefs with three rounds remaining, the Reds must win in Fiji to remain in the hunt for a top-four finish and a home final.\n\"We're not watching the ladder intently and getting hijacked by it, but we know every win we put on the board puts pressure on other people,\" Kiss said.\n\"Get this win, it makes things possible.\n\"We've tried to go there fresh. A lot of lads are getting their first, second, third chance.\n\"It's a chance to change tack a bit.\"\nRyan has scored six tries in his past three games, but Aubrey poses his own threat in what is expected to be another wet Fijian affair.\n\"He's an instinctive type of player, those conditions often can suit him,\" Kiss said.\n\"He could do anything out of the blue, for sure.\"\nReds match-day 23: 1. Peni Ravai, 2. Josh Nasser, 3. Zane Nonggorr, 4. Ryan Smith, 5. Cormac Daly, 6. Liam Wright (co-c), 7. Fraser McReight, 8. John Bryant, 9. Tate McDermott (co-c), 10. Lawson Creighton, 11.

He will come off the bench.\nProp Mason Tupeae is set to make his Blues debut from the bench.\nThe Highlanders have named an unchanged squad, while Ayden Johnstone will play his 50th game for the club.\n\"We were happy with how the team executed the plan last week and they have all retained their spots, but this is a new week and a new challenge, we've reset and are working hard in getting our preparation right for this weekend,\" head coach Clarke Dermody said.\nThe match will kick-off at 7.05pm at Eden Park.\nHighlanders match-day 23: 1. Ethan de Groot (c), 2. Henry Bell, 3. Jermaine Ainsley, 4. Mitch Dunshea, 5. Fabian Holland, 6. Oliver Haig, 7. Sean Withy, 8. Nikora Broughton, 9. Folau Fakatava, 10. Cameron Millar, 11.

Kade Banks.\nBrumbies eye ending 15-year Crusaders drought\nThe ACT Brumbies understand the challenge as they face the possibility of ending a 15-year drought against the Crusaders at home this weekend.\nThe Brumbies have not defeated the side since 2009 - a long 15 years of waiting.\nCoach Stephen Larkham has tasted success against the Crusaders back in 2004 and he hopes that will be enough inspiration for this brigade.\n\"We've got a pretty bad track record against them but the guys that are playing on the weekend haven't been a part of that,\" he told reporters this week.\n\"It's certainly an opportunity and we got close last year with a team that we made a far few changes in, which was one of two earmarked games by Rugby Australia last year as opportunities to rest players that were competing in the World Cup.\n\"We made several changes leading into the Crusaders and we were still close but we were very disappointed coming out of that game. These guys have more recent disappointment but we've had a long period when the Crusaders have had it over us.\"\nLarkham drew plenty of similarities to last week's build-up against the Waratahs, wary of a Crusaders side that need victory to keep their finals dreams alive.\n\"They're not far off eighth at the moment, only around four points providing results go their way but they've been close in a number of the games when you look at their season,\" the AAP reported.\n\"They're playing really good Rugby, it's just not resulting in the wins each week.\n\"It's a similar challenge to the Waratahs who we thought were playing well through the season but hadn't got the wins and it's also a traditional rivalry that the boys get up for every year.\"\nFlyhalf Noah Lolesio returns to the starting side, missing the win over the Waratahs due to a head knock.\nNick Frost moves to blindside flanker with Rob Valetini shifting to his favoured number eight, with Charlie Cale ruled out with an ankle sprain.\nThe Crusaders are struggling with their own demons.\nThe defending champions have an outside chance of qualifying for the top eight and will need to win against the Brumbies to do that.\nBut they have a number of key players who are out again because of injuries including lock Scott Barrettm, centre Levi Aumua and Blindside flanker Ethan Blackadder.\nCrusaders match-day 23: 1. Joe Moody, 2. Codie Taylor (c), 3. Fletcher Newell, 4. Antonio Shalfoon, 5. Quinten Strange, 6. Cullen Frace, 7. Tom Christie, 8. Christian Lo-Willie, 9. Noah Hotham, 10. Fergus Burke, 11.

Our thanks and gratitude to the event hosts, our title partner HSBC and all other stakeholders for what promises to be an enthralling weekend of rugby sevens.\".\nInexperienced PNG Pukpuks for sevens challenger event\nPapua New Guinea will not have their best Pukpuks sevens team at the Sevens Challenger tournament in Germany this weekend.\nThe National newspaper reported on Thursday the country's rugby union have named a new-look men's sevens team with 11 debutants in the third leg of the World Rugby HSBC Sevens Challenger Series on Saturday in Munich.\nThe report said the union have disbanded the team that took part in the second leg of the series in Montevideo, Uruguay, citing disciplinary issues.\nPNGRU president Paul Siwi told The National yesterday that John Larry was appointed interim coach, while retaining the services of senior player Paul Peter Tono to lead the 12-man team.\n\"Ill-discipline is the reason why we had to drop them,\" Siwi said.\n\"They are relegated to the development squad.
