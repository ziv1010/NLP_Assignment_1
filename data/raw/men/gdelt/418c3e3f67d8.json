It could happen if there’s a good run and we could all be getting swayed with it.\nMichael Carrick is back 🤝\nOur former captain is our Head Coach for the remainder of 2025/26 🔴\n— Manchester United (@ManUtd) January 13, 2026\n“I honestly feel like (you have to look at others) at the end of the season when you’ve got (Mauricio) Pochettino, (Thomas) Tuchel and (Carlo) Ancelotti.\n“I’ve said (Brazil boss) Ancelotti. I just feel purely because he’s 66 years of age, he’s got probably the best job in the world right now. He’s probably got one job left at club level.\n“If there’s one person who’s got the patience, the composure, the experience of the Premier League.”\nUnited decided to give Carrick the short-term role in order to allow director of football Jason Wilcox to undergo a thorough recruitment process over the coming months.\nFormer captain Roy Keane mentioned Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone and Paris St Germain head coach Luis Enrique as potential options, and snapped back when Neville suggested the latter was unrealistic on the Stick to Football podcast.\n“But isn’t that bizarre, we’re talking about options and you’re ruling people out,” Keane said. “But United should be thinking ‘let’s try and get the best of the best’.”\nKeane does not feel those high standards have been reached when forming Carrick’s coaching staff.\nSteve Holland, who was Gareth Southgate’s with England, has joined a backroom team that also includes Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans.\nThe former worked with Carrick at Middlesbrough – where both had spells as manager – and Evans was part of Fletcher’s staff, having recently left his role as United’s loans manager.\nKeane said: “(Carrick) is on the beach two weeks ago with Jonny Evans.\n“Jonny Evans leaves Man United four or five weeks ago as a loans manager and then Fletch gives him a job, strangely enough, has two games.\n“Fletch goes and Carrick gives him a job. Great, isn’t it? We should all go to Barbados for a week.\n“You’re on about getting your coaching staff in, we’re praising one of them saying he’s experienced (in Holland) and then we just let the other two go, Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans.\n“What has Jonny Evans done to be a coach of Man United’s first team? He left the job four weeks ago, loans manager and ironically comes back working with the first team. That’s a big step up, isn’t it?”",
