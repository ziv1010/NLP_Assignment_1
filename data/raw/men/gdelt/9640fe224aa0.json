Before you watch, here's what to know about all seven of the international teams that will be coming to compete in the Queen City this week.\nBorussia Dortmund\nBased in: Dortmund, Germany\nHome stadium: Signal Iduna Park\nLeague: Bundesliga\nYear founded: 1909\nWho they play at TQL: Mamelodi Sundowns FC and Ulsan HD FC\nWhen they play at TQL: June 21 at noon (against Mamelodi Sundowns FC) and June 25 at 3 p.m. (against Ulsan HD FC)\nClub World Cup Group: Group F\nClub background (from FIFA): \"Formed in 1909, Borussia Dortmund are one of Germany’s most successful and popular clubs. They claimed the first of their eight German league titles in 1956, and were most recently crowned champions in 2012 under Jurgen Klopp. They have also lifted the German Cup four times, with their most recent triumph coming in 2021.\n\"BVB have also tasted glory on the international stage, most notably in 1997, when they defeated Juventus 3-1 to win the UEFA Champions League, following that up by claiming the FIFA Intercontinental Cup later the same year. They were a whisker away from winning European club football’s highest honour again in 2013 and 2024, only to lose the final on both occasions.\"\nBayern Munich\nBased in: Munich, Germany\nHome stadium: Allianz Arena\nLeague: Bundesliga\nYear founded: 1900\nWho they play at TQL: Auckland City FC\nWhen they play at TQL: June 15 at noon\nClub World Cup Group: Group C\nClub background (from FIFA): \"With roots in the football division of MTV Munchen, Bayern Munich were founded in 1900. The most successful club in German football history celebrated the first of their 33 league titles to date in 1932, well before the Bundesliga was set up in 1963. Bayern won 11 consecutive league titles between 2013 and 2023, before Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen brought this run to an end in the 2023-24 season. Die Roten are also record winners of the DFB-Pokal (German Cup) with 20 titles to their name, the most recent of which came in 2020.\n\"Bayern's long track record of success extends beyond the borders of Germany. The club's vast trophy cabinet also includes six UEFA Champions League titles (previously the European Cup), two Intercontinental Cups and two FIFA Club World Cup™ trophies. Bayern became FIFA Club World Cup champions for the first time after beating Raja Casablanca (Morocco) 2-0 in 2013, repeating the feat with a 1-0 victory over UANL Tigres (Mexico) in 2020.\"\nAuckland City FC\nBased in: Auckland, New Zealand\nHome stadium: Kiwitea Street\nLeague: New Zealand National League\nYear founded: 2004\nWho they play at TQL: Bayern Munich\nWhen they play at TQL: June 15 at noon\nClub World Cup Group: Group C\nClub background (from FIFA): \"Formed in 2004, the amateur side wasted little time in announcing themselves on the national stage, winning the league in their very first season. A lengthy battle then ensued with the now-defunct Waitakere United which saw that pair win the following eight editions of the New Zealand Football Championship. Auckland then made the tournament their own playground, reeling off eight straight league titles from 2013 to 2020. Even the introduction of a new-look tournament, the New Zealand National League, couldn’t slow the Navy Blues' juggernaut, with Auckland having also claimed the first three editions of the new format.\n\"Not just content with bossing things locally, they translated their swashbuckling form onto the continental stage, winning the OFC Champions League in 2006 and 2009 before a remarkable string of seven straight titles from 2010-2017. With the three most recent titles also in their keeping, it’s hard to know what will slow this winning-machine from New Zealand’s north island.\"\nCF Pachuca\nBased in: Pachuca, Mexico\nHome stadium: Estadio Hidalgo\nLeague: Liga MX\nYear founded: 1892\nWho they play at TQL: FC Red Bull Salzburg\nWhen they play at TQL: June 18 at 6 p.m.\nClub World Cup Group: Group H\nClub background (from FIFA): \"The club, which was founded by English miners, was initially known as Pachuca Football Club. It went on to become Pachuca Athletic Club a few years later after merging with Pachuca Cricket Club and Valasco Cricket Club. It was one of the founding teams of the Mexican League in 1902, and it did not take them long to win their first league title, winning the championship in the 1904/05 season.\n\"A few years later, the mining industry collapsed and many of their players were forced to move to Mexico City in search of better opportunities. The team remained inactive until 1950, when the Mexican Second Division was created and Pachuca A.C. was founded.\n\"However, the team soon disbanded again, only to be re-established as Club de Futbol Pachuca in 1960. The Tuzos were promoted to the First Division shortly afterwards, only to be relegated in 1973.\n\"Following three play-off final defeats (to Irapuato in 1985, Cobras de Querétaro in 1986, Atlante in 1991), they returned to the top flight in 1991/1992, after beating Zacatepec on penalties. However, their stay in the First Division was largely fruitless until the 1999 Invierno (winter tournament), when they won the title with Javier Aguirre at the helm, defeating Cruz Azul in the final.\n\"In 2001, they won their second league title under Alfredo Tena and with the likes of Argentinian Walter Silvani, Colombian Miguel Calero and Mexican Sergio Santana in their ranks.\n\"Their first continental success came in 2002, when they won the Concacaf Champions Cup, beating Morelia in the final. Since then, they have remained dominant both domestically and internationally, winning the Copa Sudamericana in 2006 after beating Colo Colo in the final. This remains the only time a Mexican club has ever won a CONMEBOL tournament.\n\"In the most recent Concacaf Champions Cup, Pachuca won their sixth continental title, joining Cruz Azul as the second most successful club in the tournament’s history.\"\nFC Red Bull Salzburg\nBased in: Salzburg, Austria\nHome stadium: Red Bull Arena\nLeague: Austrian Bundesliga\nYear founded: 1933\nWho they play at TQL: CF Pachuca\nWhen they play at TQL: June 18 at 6 p.m.\nClub World Cup Group: Group H\nClub background (from FIFA): \"FC Salzburg was founded in 1933 as SV Austria Salzburg and was promoted to the top league in Austria in 1953. They had to wait until the 1990s for their first silverware, winning their first league title in 1994 and qualifying for their only European final to date – the UEFA Cup Final, in which they fell to Inter Milan.\n\"Among FC Salzburg’s current haul of trophies are 17 league titles (including ten in a row between 2014 and 2023), nine Austrian Cups and three Austrian Supercups. The club has often acted as a springboard for world-class international players, especially in recent years. Erling Haaland, Sadio Mane and Dayot Upamecano are just some of the iconic players who have pulled on the FC Salzburg shirt.\"\nMamelodi Sundowns FC\nBased in: Pretoria, South Africa\nHome stadium: Loftus Versfeld Stadium\nLeague: South African (Betway) Premiership\nYear founded: 1970\nWho they play at TQL: Borussia Dortmund\nWhen they play at TQL: June 21 at noon\nClub World Cup Group: Group F\nClub background (from FIFA): \"Initially established in the 1960s by a group of youngsters in Pretoria as the Marabastad Sundowns, they then joined the Federation of Professional Soccer League in 1967, before beginning as an official club three years later. Their yellow, green and blue kit led to the side being called 'the Brazilians', while the flair their sides typically play with has also earned them the name 'Bafana ba Style' (Boys with style).\n\"Following a decade at the top table of South African football, Sundowns were relegated in 1980 and spent the next five years in the second tier. That was until Zola Mahobe, nicknamed 'Mr Cool', took over and led the side back to the top flight. By 1986 they were back on the South African football map, defeating Jomo Cosmos 1-0 to lift the Mainstay Cup.\n\"Dr Patrice Motsepe acquired the club in 2003, before renaming the side as Mamelodi Sundowns a year later as a nod to 'the club’s home in Mamelodi.' The Brazilians have won 12 league titles this century, with their crowning glory coming in 2016, when Pitso Mosimane led his charges to a league and CAF Champions League double.\"\nUlsan HD FC\nBased in: Ulsan, South Korea\nHome stadium: Ulsan Munsu Football Stadium\nLeague: K League 1\nYear founded: 1983\nWho they play at TQL: Borussia Dortmund\nWhen they play at TQL: June 25 at 3 p.m.\nClub World Cup Group: Group F\nClub background (from FIFA): \"Ulsan was officially founded as Hyundai Horang-i FC in 1983, the same year the K League was launched. The club was based in Incheon and Gyeonggi Province at the time but moved to Gangwon Province in 1987. It was not until 1990, though, that Ulsan became the home of the Hyundai Horang-i. In 1991, the club appointed Cha Bumkun, the first Korean to play in the German Bundesliga, as its head coach and began its journey to become a K League powerhouse.\n\"Although the club did not win any titles during Cha's tenure, he laid the foundation for its first championship in 1995, when they won the adidas (K League) Cup, marking the beginning of their glory days. They then went on to win their maiden K League title in 1996, defeating Suwon Bluewings in the final.\n\"Ulsan returned to winning ways in 2005, when stars Yoo Sangchul and Lee Chunsu returned to help form a top-notch squad that would win that year’s two-legged K League final against Incheon 6-3 on aggregate. Ulsan would go on to win the Korean League Cup in 2007 and 2011, cementing the club's reputation as a formidably strong cup side.\n\"During the 2010s, Ulsan firmly established itself as a force in Asia, becoming continental champions for the first time in 2012 by securing the AFC Champions League. After lifting the Korea Cup (then the KFA Cup) in 2017, Ulsan went on to win the AFC Champions League again in 2020, again going unbeaten. However, following the appointment of Hong Myungbo as head coach in 2021, Ulsan won back-to-back K League titles in 2022 and 2023.\n\"With Hong having departed to become the Korea Republic head coach in July, 2024 former Korea Football Association technical director Kim Pangon was appointed to lead the team to the Club World Cup.\"",
