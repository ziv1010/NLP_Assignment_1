  "body_text": "With Alphonso Davies at the final stages of a renewal with Bayern Munich, Real Madrid face a difficult decision this summer: trigger Miguel Gutiérrez’s buy-back clause or secure 50% of the profits from Girona’s potential sale. Big clubs are knocking—namely Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal—with the Spaniard’s €35 million release clause not proving a stumbling block for Premier League clubs. Given the buy-back clause, Madrid could pull the trigger and bring back their canterano for just €8 million.\nFran vs. Miguel vs. Mendy: Real Madrid’s Left-Back Conundrum - What Does the Data Suggest?\nReal Madrid faces a big decision at left-back: bring back Miguel Gutiérrez, trust Fran García’s balanced game, or stick with Ferland Mendy despite his dip in form. A deep dive into the data reveals where each ranks.\nFerland Mendy and Fran García both have contracts running until 2027, with the former’s renewal pending official confirmation. Opinions on the three fullbacks vary widely, but what does the data suggest?\nEach player was analyzed using per-90-minute metrics from the last 12 months of gameplay (January 2024 - January 2025). The data is segmented into three key areas: defensive output, offensive contribution, and passing efficiency.\nDefensive Metrics\nThe key takeaway from the chart? Fran García. It’s no surprise to see him surpass Miguel in defensive output, but outpacing Mendy in every defensive metric—especially in possession-adjusted interceptions, duels per 90, and successful defensive actions per 90—is impressive.\nSome of these terms may be opaque, so let’s break them down:\n- Successful Defensive Actions per 90: Any defensive intervention that effectively disrupts the opponent’s play and helps regain or retain possession.\n**This metric goes beyond tackles and interceptions, providing a holistic view of a player’s defensive efficiency.\n- PAdj (Possession-Adjusted) Interceptions per 90: Normalizes interception numbers based on team possession. Players on low-possession teams naturally have more defensive actions, so this metric levels the playing field.\n**This helps evaluate defensive awareness independent of team tactics.\nContext is crucial. Just as I’ve argued on past podcasts that xG (expected goals) only tells part of the story—since it doesn’t account for chances created without a shot, disallowed goals for marginal offsides, or the player taking those shots (e.g., a long shot from Valverde vs. Camavinga)—Mendy’s physical strength, positional awareness, and defensive impact in key areas (back-post defending, box defense, and 1v1 isolation in the defensive third) aren’t fully captured by these numbers.\nOffensive Contribution\nMiguel Gutiérrez outshines his counterparts in nearly every offensive metric except progressive runs (a ball carry that moves the ball at least 30% closer to the opponent’s goal or covers significant ground forward). The data supports the eye test—Miguel is most effective in the middle and final thirds rather than defensively.\nHowever, his numbers may be slightly skewed, as Girona manager Míchel has pushed him further up the pitch this season, frequently deploying him as a left wing-back, left winger, or even an attacking midfielder. That tactical flexibility speaks to his versatility and technical quality.\nFran García, as an out-and-out fullback, still puts up respectable numbers. He ranks in the 89th percentile for touches in the final third and around the 85th percentile for progressive runs and passes received in advanced areas. However, his offensive output is a significant drop-off compared to Miguel’s, while Mendy barely registers in many of these categories—unsurprising given the long-standing criticisms of his attacking limitations.\nPassing Effciency\nMiguel’s football IQ is where he truly sets himself apart—a key reason big clubs are circling. Even during his time in the UEFA Youth League and with Castilla, his vision and passing ability stood out. Much like Marcelo, he’s more of a No. 10 disguised as a wingback. Given the right system and freedom to focus on the attack, he can be a real difference-maker.\nThat context is crucial: Can a club like Real Madrid accommodate an attacking fullback like Miguel? Marcelo thrived because the team’s structure allowed him to maximize his strengths. Would Miguel receive the same conditions to flourish?\nVerdict\nThe data confirms the eye test: Miguel is an attacking fullback who, if put in the right conditions, can move the needle in the final third. Fran García is a well-rounded presence with better defensive numbers than many give him credit for. Mendy, meanwhile, appears to be the weak link, with his form dipping over the last 12 months.\nBefore reviewing this data, I assumed next season’s left-back conversation would be Mendy plus either Miguel or Fran. Mendy’s status in the squad and key role in previous league and Champions League triumphs led to that assumption. But if the Frenchman doesn’t rediscover his best form—returning as the best lockdown 1v1 defender in Europe—serious discussions about his future may be needed. Carlo Ancelotti remains a strong advocate for Mendy, but Fran has worked his way into a more meaningful role this season.\nDespite Miguel’s standout offensive metrics, there are still questions about his return. Does his skill set fit a team that arguably needs more defensive “workhorses” with speed in transition? If Trent Alexander-Arnold joins, can both coexist in the same system? It may make more sense for Madrid to take the €18 million profit from a Girona sale instead of complicating squad balance. Building a competitive team is about finding complementary profiles—can Madrid shape the right system around a talent like Miguel? These are the questions that must be answered before deciding the future of Madrid’s left-back position.",
