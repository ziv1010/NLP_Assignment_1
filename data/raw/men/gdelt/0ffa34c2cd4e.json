Here are some to look out for this year.by Kaushik Kalidindi for OkayAfrica\nThe stars are out to compete at AFCON 2025 in Morocco. That includes heavyweights like CAF Player of the Year and Moroccan team captain Achraf Hakimi, Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah, Nigerian star striker Victor Osimhen, and many more. These are names expected to make their mark on the quest to win the most prestigious trophy in African men’s football.\nAt the same time, the future is bright, and stars often emerge on this big stage. Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto’o scored 4 goals in AFCON 2000, opening a record of 18 goals at the tournament that has yet to be equalled. Osaze Odemwingie established his name with heroics in 2004, while then-22-year-old Ismaël Bennacer was crowned the Best Player in 2019 when Algeria won the tournament. Ahead of the tournament in Morocco, OkayAfrica has identified seven young players that should be on your radar if you’re looking forward to seeing some breakout talent.\nIn Adil Boulbina, Algeria has a young wildcard coming into his own. At the ongoing FIFA Arab Cup, Boulbina scored three goals in four matches and was his team’s major threat until its exit in the quarterfinal via a penalty shootout loss against the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The 22-year-old was the top scorer in Algeria’s Ligue 1 last season and has already hit the ground running this season with his new club, Qatar’s Al Duhail, having scored five goals in five AFC Champions League Elite matches — including a hat trick against Al Ittihad in a 4-2 win in November. Boulbina is yet to break into the Fennec’s first eleven fully, but he’ll be looking to be a big factor at AFCON 2025.\nNoah Sadiki\nSince his debut in September 2024, Noah Sadiki has been a fixture in DR Congo’s men’s national team – and he’s just turning 21. Part of what has made Sadiki invaluable is his ability to function across multiple positions, from full back to defensive midfield, while playing with a mix of force and stability that belies his age. Sadiki joined English club Sunderland last summer, and he’s been a constant in the line-up as his club firmly sits in the top half of the Premier League table. Sadiki affects games by ensuring things never go off the rails, giving his teams a formidable base to build attacks from and a strong presence in midfield to keep defensive balance. In a competition where every little bit of edge matters, Sadiki is poised to be at the heart of everything the Leopards hope to achieve in Morocco.\nKamory Doumbia\nEverything seems set for Kamory Doumbia to become a superstar, not just for Mali, but also in African football. Doumbia has managed a return of 15 goals in 28 national team appearances, including five goals scored in seven matches so far this year. If his impeccable form translates into AFCON 2025, it significantly raises the ceiling for the Eagles, who have been runners-up twice and have never won the tournament. The 22-year-old will provide a much-needed dose of pace and creativity to a team that plays with a high level of physicality. At the end of the 2023/24 season, his sublime half-volley goal was voted Goal of the Season, a glimpse of the technical magic he’s capable of at any given time.\nCarlos Baleba\nWhen he’s in full flow, there’s no chink in Carlos Baleba’s game. He’s ultra-athletic, a dependable ball carrier and passer, and on a few occasions has shown that there’s a decent strike in his left boot. The Cameroonian made the move from Lille in France to English side Brighton in the summer of 2024, a year later, and he was the target of transfer enquiries by Manchester United. Heading into AFCON, Baleba will clearly be tasked with being the engine that drives everything the Indomitable Lions do, as the primary driver of transition from defense to attack and, perhaps, even some goal-scoring.\nLamine Camara\nJust a few weeks shy of his 22nd birthday, Lamine Camara can already be counted as a veteran in Senegal’s national team. The Dakar-born midfielder has played 34 matches in the three-plus years since he’s been called up, which means he’ll be integral to the Teranga Lions’ hopes of reclaiming the AFCON title they won in 2021 and fell short of defending last time out. On a team with a solid forward line led by the iconic Sadio Mané and productive forwards Ismaila Sarr and Nicholas Jackson, Camara will be looking to provide a forceful midfield presence that gives his attackers the freedom to shine in front of goal. He scored two goals at the last AFCON, so he won’t be averse to getting in on the goals if needed.\nIbrahim Mbaye\nFrench-born Ibrahim Mbaye won’t be 18 years old till the middle of AFCON 2025, but a small sample size suggests that he’s ready to take over as Senegal’s talisman in a few years. Or it may as well be in Morocco, possibly as a surprise difference maker or key player, even. For those unfamiliar, Mbaye has worked his way into the first team squad at elite French side Paris Saint-Germain, starting a handful of games this season so far. In an 8-0 friendly match rout of Kenya, he became the Teranga Lions’ youngest goalscorer ever. A forward with a silky touch and a solid frame, Mbaye will very likely be behind better-established players, but he’s just a moment away from being a household name in African football.\nRyan Alebiosu\nWith long-time full back Ola Aina rehabbing a hamstring injury, Nigeria faced a depth issue at right back heading into AFCON 2025. UK-born Ryan Alebiosu has never been capped by Nigeria, and he’s currently being touted by some sports analysts as the answer to that position. Alebiosu has been one of the brighter spots fromthe English side Blackburn Rovers, who have struggled to string wins together in the EFL Championship. Standing at a respectable 6 ft 2 in, he should add much-needed physicality to the Super Eagles, as well as great motor and solid technique as an overlapping full back. Very few Nigerians and Africans know of Alebiosu; he could leave Morocco as a popular name.",
