  "body_text": "Mohamed Salah has deleted references to Liverpool on his X account after the team’s 5-1 win against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League on Wednesday night.\nSalah was dropped to the bench for the game in Germany as goals from Hugo Ekitike, Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, Cody Gakpo and Dominik Szoboszlai sealed the win for Arne Slot’s side to end a run of four straight defeats.\nThe 33-year-old has come under fire for his poor performances this season and has now failed to score or assist in his last five appearances for Liverpool.\nSalah also angered Liverpool fans after coming on as a second-half substitute against Frankfurt as he opted to shoot from close range instead of squaring the ball for Florian Wirtz to score a simple tap-in.\nLiverpool supporters have now been left puzzled by Salah’s actions after the match as the forward has removed a picture of Liverpool’s Premier League title celebrations from the header on his X profile.\nSalah has also changed the profile picture from him in a Liverpool shirt holding the Premier League trophy to one where he is with his two children on a beach.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

That’s also the reason why I use these players.\n‘I liked the way we ended the game against United. Mainly the second half. Created a lot of chances.\n‘And Ryan [Gravenberch] is out, so that means we have to restructure our midfield a little bit as well – defensively and offensively. So all together with the way Frankfurt usually plays, we decided to start like this.\n‘But as always, I have players who start the game and I have players who can impact the game off the bench and that is [the case] today as well.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: ‘He’s been villainised’ – Peter Crouch condemns ‘unacceptable’ abuse of Man Utd star\nMORE: David Seaman makes Viktor Gyokeres prediction after double for Arsenal against Atletico Madrid\nMORE: Jude Bellingham sends message to Tuchel after getting dropped by England manager",
