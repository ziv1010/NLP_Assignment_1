They need to change the man [Ten Hag] who is not getting the best out of the individuals on the pitch.”\nSpeaking about Man United’s transfer business, Sherwood added: “Why on Earth did they not push the boat out to sign Harry Kane?\n“I know I sound like a broken record but players like Harry Kane and Declan Rice would have improved a lot of players at that football club and they would have made the manager look better as well.”",
