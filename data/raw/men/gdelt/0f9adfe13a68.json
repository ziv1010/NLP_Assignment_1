  "body_text": "As Nicolo Zaniolo caught a private jet from Milan’s Linate airport to Istanbul, his camp posted a supercut of his time as a Roma player.\nThe soundtrack to it was James Blunt’s You’re Beautiful, one of the most misunderstood songs in recent music history.\nAs Blunt has explained, it is about “a guy who is as high as a fucking kite on drugs, in the subway, stalking someone else’s girlfriend”.\nAdvertisement\nAn innocent-enough misinterpretation on Team Zaniolo’s part, given all they wished to do was pay homage to the Eternal City’s “Great Beauty”. But another example, nonetheless, of him getting something wrong.\nEarlier this week, the 23-year-old joined Galatasaray about 10 years before anyone would have expected him to make such a move. Even Mario Balotelli didn’t go to the Turkish Super Lig until he was in his thirties.\nIt was not supposed to be this way.\nZaniolo was meant to be at the Bernabeu — the stadium where he made his first-team debut in September 2018. Real Madrid were impressed enough at the time to lead Roma’s then-owner Jim Pallotta to believe they would break the Italian transfer record to sign him. It would have echoed the transfer of Antonio Cassano between the clubs in 2006.\nInstead Zaniolo, an attacking midfielder, has left Rome for Istanbul not Madrid and for a fraction of the price he promised to fetch four years ago — an underwhelming €16.5million (£14.6m, $17.6m) with add-ons, which make €23m easily achievable, and a 20 per cent sell-on clause. Given the press he once generated, that fee beggars belief.\nBut if you forget his name for one minute and consider he had only scored three goals in 41 Serie A appearances since the start of last season and had just 18 months left on his contract, it does start to make sense.\nAs Roma’s general manager Tiago Pinto argued, it’s better than nothing (a thinly-veiled allusion to AC Milan and neighbours Inter and their issues with the expiring contracts of Gianluigi Donnarumma, Franck Kessie and Ivan Perisic in recent seasons and Milan Skriniar during this one).\nBut however you dress it up, this has not gone well for Roma.\nWe have signed Nicolò Zaniolo from AS Roma on a permanent deal.\nHere's his first message to the world with Galatasaray 🖤#WeAreUnited pic.twitter.com/S0zhspIQcr\n— Galatasaray EN (@Galatasaray) February 9, 2023\nThey should have sold Zaniolo last summer, especially as they had given the impression they were prepared to listen to offers.\nAdvertisement\nHis value, oscillating between €35million and €50million depending on who you spoke to, was arguably at its highest since returning at the start of the 2021-22 season from almost back-to-back ACL injuries to both knees which had limited him to eight Serie A outings in 18 months.\nZaniolo had scored the only goal of the game in the Europa Conference League final last May to win Roma their first trophy in 14 years, but any sentimentality needed placing to one side.\nRoma’s American owners, the Friedkin family, have resisted selling off the team’s stars to fund recruitment, perhaps to avoid the parallels with the unfairly maligned Pallotta, who felt he had no choice but to do so if the club were to abide by financial fair play rules and generate funds to invest in the team.\nBut the imposition of a strict new settlement agreement has brought home an inconvenient truth — sacrifices had to be made.\nZaniolo was one of Roma’s most saleable assets and divided opinion to the point where swathes of the fanbase would not miss him. The chance to cash in on him had to be taken. It wasn’t.\nCome this January, then, Zaniolo must have realised he was expendable. While this does not excuse his recent behaviour, it offers some context.\nThe situation escalated after he decided he didn’t want to play away to Spezia, his hometown club, on January 22.\nAs the winter window entered its final week, things heated up even further. The spotlight on Juventus’ transfer business, the prudence of champions Milan and the poverty of the rest of the league meant nobody was prepared to pay the Serie A premium on a big local talent.\nMilan did give it some thought but concluded it wasn’t worth the risk, so Zaniolo’s entourage offered him around the Premier League, hoping to drum up interest.\nFirst, he was packaged up as a loan signing with an option to buy, then a loan with an obligation to make it permanent, and finally as an outright sale. Brighton & Hove Albion and Aston Villa were among the clubs who decided Zaniolo wasn’t for them.\nAdvertisement\nOnly second-bottom Bournemouth came forward with an offer (of €25million, with another €5m in add-ons).\nFrustrated at a lack of progress in their attempt to sign Hamed Traore of Sassuolo as Zaniolo’s replacement, Roma increased their efforts to move their player on.\nHowever, Zaniolo wanted to take time to think about his future — even though by then time was arguably as precious as the price Roma sought. Nevertheless, the club granted him it in good faith.\nOn January 26, he turned Bournemouth down, which angered Roma. “Zaniolo put us in a difficult situation,” Pinto revealed.\nRoma then cut their valuation, but Bournemouth went cold on the idea. By the time Zaniolo reconsidered and expressed his willingness to move to their part of England’s south coast, it was too late.\nIncapable of remaining indifferent, the Roma fans turned.\n“For us, wearing that shirt means honouring it. For us, kissing that shirt means not betraying it. AS Roma is sacred,” a banner unfurled in their Stadio Olimpico’s Curva Sud read.\nSpotted near his home by a group of fans, Zaniolo was confronted, insulted and followed. The police were called and he left Rome for La Spezia, 420km (260 miles) to the north. In a report submitted by Italy’s players’ union, the aggression he experienced was dubbed the “tip of the iceberg” when it comes to the harassment footballers endure in the country.\nThere was no going back for Zaniolo, regardless of the statement he put out via ANSA, the Italian news wire, offering “his hand” in a gesture to let bygones be bygones. “I put myself at the complete disposal of the Roma family.”\nThat family cast him out.\nExpelled from the first-team squad, Zaniolo joined Rick Karsdorp out in the cold.\nKarsdorp hasn’t played for Roma since a 1-1 draw away to Sassuolo in early November when Mourinho said, without naming anyone, that his team had been “betrayed by the attitude” of one of its players. On Instagram, Karsdorp posted a crying emoji and two hearts in Roma’s red and yellow colours. One of the hearts was broken.\nAdvertisement\nFIFPRO, the worldwide players’ union, issued a statement to “strongly” condemn “AS Roma’s treatment of” the wing-back “who in recent weeks has been the victim of a mobbing campaign”. It meant two members of Roma’s Europa Conference League-winning team from less than a year ago were on the fringes, no longer considered for selection.\nKarsdorp could still be reintegrated, as Roma included him and Zaniolo in their squad for the knockout phase of the Europa League (they have a two-leg play-off against Red Bull Salzburg this month to decide who will make the round of 16). But Zaniolo obviously now won’t be.\nRoma held out on deadline day in Italy and England (January 31), resisting an approach from Leeds United to take Zaniolo on loan.\nBut the window remained open in Turkey until February 8 and Zaniolo eventually moved to their Super Lig — a division many consider football’s twilight zone.\nIt begs the question, who are the winners and losers in this saga? Galatasaray, nine points clear at the top of the table, have improbably got their hands on a player who still has what should be the prime years of his career ahead of him.\nRoma have, at least, brought in some money but the remorse must be high, considering the past owners extracted €38million plus Zaniolo from the sale of Radja Nainggolan to Inter in the summer of 2018 — a deal heralded as one of the best of the last decade in light of the Italian youngster’s sudden emergence as the next big thing in Serie A and the Belgian veteran’s decline.\nHaving procured Zaniolo so advantageously, losing him like this must hurt.\n“In all the (previous) transfer windows, I’ve been able to say with confidence that the team improved,” Pinto said. “I can’t say that now. We’ve lost three players (this winter: Zaniolo, Matias Vina to Bournemouth and Eldor Shomurodov, loaned to Spezia) and signed two (Diego Llorente from Leeds and Bodo/Glimt’s Ola Solbakken).”\nAdvertisement\nTo compound matters, FFP parameters mean Solbakken cannot be registered for Roma’s squad for the Europa League knockouts.\nDespite all this, Pinto deserves some credit for the work he has done since joining from Benfica two years ago. He has slashed the wage bill and gradually cleared up the mess left from the 2017-19 Monchi era. Tammy Abraham has broadly been a success and Mourinho can’t believe Paulo Dybala is now playing in red and yellow.\nBut summer 2021 signings Vina and Shomurodov have flopped and they have not done well in selling players. As well as this, Roma risk losing Chris Smalling and Stephan El Shaarawy for nothing on Bosmans at the end of this season.\nHowever, the bigger picture must be remembered.\nJuventus’ points deduction and their own recent good form (they have lost just once in six league games since the season resumed after the World Cup and sit third) give Roma a genuine chance of returning to the Champions League for the first time in four years — another sign of progress on the back of last year’s European trophy.\nAnd what of Zaniolo? The fact that the only clubs with concrete interest in him were Galatasaray and Bournemouth says a lot about the trajectory of his career, the guidance he has received and the haste with which Italy hypes its young players.\nZaniolo represented hope in 2018, with Italy having missed that summer’s World Cup in Russia. It remains to be seen if he fulfils his promise.\nOutside the Olimpico last week, a banner read: “Respect for Zaniolo”.\nIts authors were not Roma fans. They were Lazio supporters, who gave him credit for seeing the light and leaving their hated rivals.\nBut in many ways Roma, Zaniolo and Italian football as a whole are all losers in this sad affair.\n(Top photo: Silvia Lore/Getty Images)",
