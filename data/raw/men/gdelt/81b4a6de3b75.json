  "body_text": "Saturday’s La Liga game against his former team Real Madrid at the Estadio Benito Villamarin is sure to bring back many memories for the Real Betis captain Isco — some good, some not so good.\nOne of the most naturally talented players of his generation, Isco has experienced many highs over his career, including winning four Champions League finals at Madrid.\nAdvertisement\nThere’s also been plenty of lows — including watching Los Blancos win another Champions League from the bench, knowing he had made zero contribution to the victory, and soon after spending six months training on his own without a club.\nTwo years after his top-level career appeared over, Isco welcomed The Athletic to Betis’ Luis del Sol training ground as the on-pitch leader of a team in excellent form in La Liga and aiming for European glory this season.\nThrough the half-hour conversation, the 32-year-old is keen to stress how much he has learned over his career, and especially how he has bounced back from those low points.\n“Often in life, there are tough moments but you have to keep going, not give up,” Isco tells The Athletic. “I always believed I could return to a good level, and now I’m happy to be enjoying football again. I’ve had lots of good fortune over my career, the teams I’ve played for, the trophies I’ve won. And I’m very lucky now to be at a team like Betis, with its fans, staff, my team-mates, the coaches. The way of living life at this club has helped me a lot.”\nSuccess and acclaim came very quickly in Isco’s career. As a teenager, he burst onto the scene at Malaga, winning the 2012 Golden Boy award for the best under-21 player in Europe, and reaching the 2012-13 Champions League quarter-finals. In summer 2013, Manchester City were interested, but he joined Madrid for €30million, when still just 21.\nThere was no obvious place for the young playmaker in a squad full of galactico attackers, including the “BBC” frontline of Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo. But he found ways to make his natural creative talents useful to the team — first under Carlo Ancelotti and then Zinedine Zidane, Isco played in and won four Champions League finals in five years, starting the 2017 and 2018 deciders against Juventus and Liverpool.\nAdvertisement\n“To get into the team at Madrid is very difficult,” Isco says. “They always have the best players in the world. So you must work hard, be at your very best. With the ‘BBC’, we played a shape that normally had no mediapunta (No 10). Although, during a spell with Zidane, I played with a lot of freedom to cover the pitch. They were two or three really good years.”\nIt was in 2018 when things started to go wrong for Isco at Madrid. After Zidane left, his former Spain coach Julen Lopetegui took over but was sacked after just 14 games. Interim boss Santiago Solari dropped Isco from the team and his work-rate and attitude were criticised. Even after Zidane returned, Isco never recovered the same prominence or form as before, being edged out by younger stars such as Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Federico Valverde.\nDuring the 2021-22 campaign, with Ancelotti back as coach, Isco watched Madrid’s entire Champions League campaign from the bench, playing no part through the famous comebacks against Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City, and the win over Liverpool in Paris. He says his relationship with the Italian was always good but accepts now he did not react well when things started going against him.\n“Of the nine years (at Madrid), six or seven were very good,” he says. “So I’m happy with it, although it was a pity that the last two years didn’t go as I wished. Whenever you’re not playing, and don’t feel really part of the success, it’s tough. It is difficult, I was not feeling right mentally. I went through a difficult moment, and I didn’t know how to manage it well. Maybe if it happened to me now, with another level of maturity, I’d react differently. But it served as a lesson, made me understand that just having talent is not enough, and I appreciate every lesson that life has given me.”\nOn leaving Madrid in 2022, Isco reunited with Lopetegui at Sevilla but the Basque coach was fired just two months into the season. Isco soon left too after a serious falling out with then Sevilla sporting director Monchi (now at Aston Villa). After a potential move to Bundesliga side Union Berlin broke down late in the January transfer window, he spent the remainder of the 2022-23 season in limbo.\nAdvertisement\n“When you’re used to being with a team, the routine of training and games, to be six months at home, working alone in the gym, was tough,” Isco says. “I did a lot of work — in the gym but also mentally. It helped me a lot to clarify my ideas, to make me a bit stronger mentally. When you get knocked down, you always have to try and get back up again, not to let things keep you down. Looking back now I am grateful it happened to me, I really value all I am enjoying now.”\nDuring summer 2023, Isco had contact from clubs in England, Saudi Arabia and Italy. He chose a reunion with Manuel Pellegrini, who had been his manager at Malaga a decade earlier.\nIn nine of the first 13 La Liga games for Betis, he was named official player of the match — with his innate playmaking ability accompanied by a determination and workrate not always evident during his later years at Madrid.\n“Pellegrini was very important,” Isco says. “He always wants an attractive, attacking style of football. Close to the opposition penalty area, we have absolute freedom to do what we believe is the best thing to do to win games. I’m feeling very good physically too, able to cover a lot of metres, and happy to be helping the team.”\nDespite getting his first senior Spain call-up as far back as May 2012, Isco has won just 38 senior caps, the most recent back in 2019. Nine goals and seven assists in 36 club games last season led to a clamour for Spain coach Luis de la Fuente to recall him for Euro 2024. De la Fuente at first resisted, and a broken bone in his leg in May ended any chance of Isco going to the tournament.\n“I’d not spoken personally with (De la Fuente), but I believe there was a good chance I could have gone to the Euros,” Isco says. “But it’s like the other things in this interview, things don’t always go as you wish. You have to pick yourself up as soon as possible.”\nA setback last September meant Isco needed another knee operation, so he only returned to action in December. Since being back in the team, he has five goals and provided two assists in 14 games from his roving midfield role.\nAdvertisement\nAs club captain, he also has a leadership role off the pitch. This includes helping Antony, a January loan signing from Manchester United, settle at the Benito Villamarin. The Brazilian joined United for a €100m (£84m; $102m) fee but scored just once in his last 37 Premier League appearances, falling completely out of favour at Old Trafford.\nThere were issues in Antony’s private life, too. In September 2023 he was left out of the United squad for a month after police launched an investigation due to his former partner, Gabriela Cavallin, making allegations of assault against him. Antony denied those allegations and similar ones by two other women made in Brazilian media. The case in Brazil is now closed, but as of January, Greater Manchester Police were still investigating the alleged incidents that are said to have occurred in the United Kingdom.\nSpeaking about Antony’s football career, Isco says he can identify with the situation of a talented player who went through a tricky spell at a huge club and now wants to show what they are capable of.\n“Of course,” he says. “He is getting back to enjoying his football. He needed a change of air, and Betis has the best air there is.”\nAntony’s first six games for Betis, across La Liga and the UEFA Conference League, have seen him score three times and provide two assists. Last weekend at Getafe, the Brazilian set up a goal for his captain with a driving run from his own half.\n\"Antony the architect!\" 🇧🇷\n— Premier Sports (@PremSportsTV) February 23, 2025\nIsco with a fantastic touch and finish after a great assist from the in-form Brazilian 🔥 pic.twitter.com/pkGQnZ0Zhr\nLess positive was a straight red card for a despairing lunge at Getafe defender Juan Iglesias. After the final whistle, when Antony re-emerged from the tunnel, Isco gave him a hug and urged him to join his team-mates celebrating with Betis’ visiting fans.\n“The kid was feeling down, as it’s never nice to leave your team down a player,” Isco says. “But these things happen in football. He has surprised me, on a personal level and as a footballer. I’m happy that a player of his level is here at Betis.”\nAdvertisement\nRecent years have seen many talented and creative players — including Sergio Canales, Hector Bellerin and Giovani Lo Celso — show the best form of their careers at Betis after suffering dips elsewhere.\n“Many players have come here with people saying their careers were over, or they were not so good, but in the end we’ve been resurrected here,” Isco says. “When it happens so many times, it cannot be a coincidence. This club has something special.”\nWith Isco back fit and firing, and Antony making a useful contribution, three wins in their last five La Liga games have seen Betis climb to seventh in the table.\nThis makes it potentially a good time to face joint leaders Madrid, who also have a huge Champions League last-16 first leg against Atletico Madrid to think about on Tuesday.\n“Madrid is the best team in the world, so it’s always difficult against them,” Isco says. “Maybe they will be thinking about the Champions League, and rotate a few players, and we can beat them.”\nJude Bellingham is suspended due to a two-game ban imposed for insulting the referee in a recent draw at Osasuna. Madrid were angered by that sending-off, and have also bitterly complained about alleged bias against them among Spanish officials. Some around the Bernabeu were also upset when Antony’s red card from last weekend was rescinded so he can play on Saturday.\n“Every team complains about refereeing decisions,” Isco says. “It’s the only thing about football that bores me — all the noise about referees, the constant protests, after every game. Hopefully, we can stop these ways of trying to influence the officials. We also need to improve as players and help the officials, by not diving, not exaggerating contact, claiming we’ve been hit. We can all help each other more, referees and players, together.”\nAdvertisement\nIsco turns 33 in April and his Betis contract runs until June 2027. Ending his career in MLS is a possibility, while playing again for Spain is another important ambition. More short-term, Portuguese side Vitoria Guimaraes visit in a UEFA Conference League last-16 first leg tie on Thursday.\n“Winning trophies and playing in the Champions League has to be our ambition,” Isco says. “We cannot limit ourselves. To win the Conference League would be a dream. You have to keep renewing and updating your dreams, to maintain that motivation and excitement.\n“Coming to Betis was one of the best decisions I’ve made in my career. I come to training every day with a smile, and enjoy every game as if it was my first one. I still have many dreams to fulfil.”\n(DAX Images/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
