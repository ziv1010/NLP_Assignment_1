  "body_text": "Paris Saint-Germain have reignited their interest in Atalanta forward Ademola Lookman as the French giants look to bolster their attack in the January transfer window.\nThe Parisians’ attack has struggled to score goals in recent matches, prompting the club to revisit their pursuit of the Nigeria international.\nLookman, 26, has been in scintillating form since joining Atalanta from RB Leipzig in 2022 for €9.35m plus bonuses, amassing 33 goals and providing 20 assists in 81 competitive appearances for the Italian side.\nLast season, Lookman featured in 45 matches, weighing in with 17 goals and 10 assists. His standout moment came in the UEFA Europa League final against Bayer Leverkusen, where he netted a stunning hat-trick to secure the trophy for Atalanta.\nThe Nigerian’s performances have not gone unnoticed, with several top European clubs, including Manchester City, Liverpool, and Juventus, reportedly showing interest during the 2025 summer transfer window.\nAccording to Fichajes, Atalanta have set an asking price of between €65m and €75m for Lookman, a figure likely intended to deter potential suitors in January.\nThe Serie A club are currently competing in the UEFA Champions League and battling for European positions for next season.\nDuring the summer chase, PSG’s previous offer of between €25 and €30m, including bonuses, fell far short of Atalanta’s €50m valuation, as reported by TuttoAtalanta last month.\nLookman’s stock has risen further following his recent Player of the Match performance in Atalanta’s impressive 3-0 victory against Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Champions League.\nThe forward scored one goal and provided an assist in the match, becoming only the second Atalanta player to achieve this feat in a single Champions League game.\nAffectionately known as “The King of Bergamo” by Atalanta fans, Lookman’s consistent performances have also put him in contention for the 2024 African Player of the Year award.\nAs PSG continue to monitor Lookman’s situation, it remains to be seen whether the French champions will meet Atalanta’s valuation or if the Italian club will stay firm in their desire to retain their prized asset.\nWith the January transfer window approaching, football fans will be keenly watching to see if Lookman makes a high-profile move to the French capital or continues to live his Atalanta dreams.",
