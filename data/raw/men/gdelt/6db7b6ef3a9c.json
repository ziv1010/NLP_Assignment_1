These markets are not the fastest growing in terms of GDP growth, Mr Rochat said. “So, we've always been very interested in the Middle East, putting our foot on fast-growth region.”\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE, their peers in the six-member GCC economic bloc, and countries in the broader Mena region have maintained a strong growth momentum since bouncing back from the Covid-driven slowdown, outpacing most European and emerging markets.\nThe robust economic growth, coupled with millionaires flocking to the region and the migration of family and institutional wealth from Europe and Asia, is drawing global asset and wealth managers to the Middle East.\nThe UAE’s measures to attract foreign investment, combined with its position as a gateway to the broader Middle East, Africa and South Asia regions, has helped it attract a whole host of family offices, private banks and asset managers over the past few years.\nLast year, JP Morgan Chase, the biggest US lender, said it is building a team of private bankers in the UAE, a move aimed at boosting the bank’s wealth management business in the region.\nThis month, Rothschild & Co, one of the world's biggest financial advisory groups, said its wealth management business, which manages €38 billion ($44.3 billion) in client assets, will take over the UAE operations of Liechtensteinische Landesbank.\nIn June, Switzerland's Partners Group, with $150 billion in client assets, and Harrison Street, a $56 billion US-based property and infrastructure investment manager, began operations at Abu Dhabi's ADGM.\nTrillion-dollar asset managers including New York-based BlackRock, PGIM, the global asset management business of Prudential Financial, and Chicago investment firm Nuveen have established bases in Abu Dhabi.\nThe UAE alone is expected to attract a record 9,800 relocating millionaires this year, drawn by regulatory reforms and a tax-free lifestyle, according to the Wealth Migration Report 2025 by advisory Henley & Partners and wealth intelligence firm New World Wealth. In 2024, Dubai had an estimated 81,200 millionaires and 20 billionaires.\nMr Janoudi said Lombard Odier’s investments in the Middle Eastern markets are paying dividends and “we actually have seen business growth, which is quite substantial … across the region [including] the GCC”.\nSwiss-established families account for one third of Lombard Odier’s private client business activity. Other European accounts make up another third and the rest comes from new markets, of which the Middle East makes up about two-thirds.\nGlobally, private wealth has reached a record $471 trillion, growing by more than $340 trillion since 1995, about eight times faster than the expansion of public wealth over the same period, the Dubai International Financial Centre said in its Future of Finance report this month.\nThe defining feature of the new era is the $124 trillion of intergenerational wealth transfer set to take place in the next two decades, which offers significant opportunities to global wealth and asset managers.\nMiddle East ambitions\nLombard Odier aims to build on the region’s growth momentum and its rapid wealth creation, doubling its Middle East assets under management by the end of this decade. It also aims to substantially expand its revenue base in the region over the same period.\n“We definitely have an ambition, which has been presented to the executive committee,” Mr Janoudi said. “This part of the world is going very fast and we want to make sure that we reach our targets, and I have no doubt that we will, as we're on track so far.”\nThe bank’s long relationships with clients and affluent families, which in some cases span two or three generations, has helped it to grow its business faster than the market. It has been hitting a “mid-to-high, single-digit growth rate” for both assets as well as the number of clients in the region, he said.\nSaudi Arabia – Opec’s largest oil producer, the UAE – the commercial and tourism hub of the region, as well energy-rich Qatar and Kuwait remain key markets for Lombard Odier, Mr Janoudi added.\nHowever, the bank is not keen to expand its physical presence to other jurisdictions in the Middle East and plans to continue serving clients from its base in the UAE.\n“We are quite wary of just opening and planting flags everywhere, because we are a bank of entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs,” Mr Rochat said. “We’re quite keen to leverage as much as possible our existing regional hubs.”\nWithdrawal from ADGM\nIn August, Bloomberg reported that Lombard Odier was closing its office in Abu Dhabi’s financial hub ADGM, marking a rare exit by an international wealth and asset manager, with staff offered positions in either Dubai or Switzerland.\nThe private bank established its presence in ADGM in 2019 and went on to acquire a licence from DIFC in Dubai.\nHowever, Mr Rochat said the bank is “actually not pulling out of anything in terms of the UAE and it continues to be a very strategic market for us”.\nOn the contrary, Lombard Odier is investing in the UAE, but it is doing so from DIFC and will consolidate operations, he said, with the bank investing more in terms of expertise and talent.\n“The DIFC upgrade is important for us … [as] it's not just about the UAE, it's basically about having the regional platform that we can operate from.”\nDiscerning client base\nA single base in the region allows Lombard Odier to bring the talent under one roof to better advise its customers, who, Mr Rochat said, are discerning and sophisticated in their investment approach, balancing risks with returns.\n“What I've seen in the Middle East is that clients invest, more or less, the same way as European clients … and they all are looking for quality investments, quality assets, where they can put their money to work,” he said.\n“There is one difference, which is the dollar, because a lot of our clients in the Middle East are based in dollars, so obviously the question is an important one for them, [considering] the volatility that we've seen [in the US currency].”\nThere is also growing appetite for investments in hedge funds across the board, as well as in private equity and emerging market assets from larger and smaller customers in the Middle East as people hedge bets against the volatility in traditional asset classes, Mr Janoudi said.\n“It means some of our clients in the Middle East are looking at other areas besides the known Europe or the US. Are there any other areas where we could invest? They are asking us more and more about tactical investments,” he added.",
