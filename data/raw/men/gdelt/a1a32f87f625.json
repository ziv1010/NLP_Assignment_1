The report added that the UCL defeats left the club €5.6m short of their maximum pot.\nOnly four first-team players began the match since the senior players were tired, according to manager Xavi.\n“There are footballers who are not their age and are in the first team. 16, 17, 18, 19 years old, it’s very early for them, it’s a lot of responsibility. But it is what it affects due to the economic situation of the club. This situation makes us adapt and it is something that adds to us as an entity,” he told Sport.\nHe also lauded former teammate Rafael Marquez, who as Barca Atletic manager is coaching quite a few of those players.\n“Rafa Marquez is training the youngsters very well. We have taken advantage of this match to give them opportunities because they deserve them. It was an open match with many chances so people will have enjoyed it. For us it is a pleasure to be in the United States,” Xavi added.\nLamine Yamal and Marc Guiu scored for Barcelona during the match. Meanwhile, Diego Kochen, Ander Astralaga, Unai Hernandez, Gerard Martin, Pau Prim and Mamadou Mbacke made an appearance for the senior side for the first time.",
