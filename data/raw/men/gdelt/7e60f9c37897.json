  "body_text": "He has provided the soundtrack to so many iconic moments in football, but Clive Tyldesley started as a boy in Bury, \"chasing a ball around the back garden, commentating to himself\", just like the rest of us.\nClive was raised in Bury, being born in Radcliffe, before going on to live all over the borough, including on Radcliffe Road and in Holcombe Brook and Ramsbottom.\nBut his career as a football commentator has taken him from the town to the highest echelons of the sport, including multiple World Cup tournaments, Champions League finals and FA Cup finals.\nOn Monday, December 29, he was confirmed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to broadcasting and charity.\nSpeaking to the Bury Times, Clive joked that he didn't have \"a great deal of choice\" in his career, being \"not good enough to play for Bury\" but being surrounded by professional football growing up and wanting to be involved in the sport.\nHe said: \"Your first break is your biggest break, and my first break was to be born in Radcliffe and to return home to a semi-detached house in Radcliffe Road in Bury, where on the other side of the attaching wall lived the Bury manager of the day.\n\"Dave Russell was the manager of Bury when I was born and his wife Gladys travelled to the nursing home, it was called Bealeys. So Gladys travelled with my mum, Frieda, back from the nursing home when I was born.\n\"Bury were a second-tier team, the equivalent of a Championship team, in 1954 when I was born. Dave's youngest son, Robin, is only a little older than I am, so he was my 'playmate' through the early years of my life.\n\"Dave left Bury to go on and be a truly iconic manager in the history of Tranmere Rovers, and I knew David and Gladys and Robin, and their older son is Dave, throughout those early years of my life, and in a sense I was inside track from day one.\"\nHe described his experiences as being like a \"key to the dressing room door, which most fans never, ever get\".\nClive's experiences of growing up in Bury go beyond football, with a strong television link as well.\nHe said: \"When we lived in Holcombe Brook and I was at Bury Grammar Prep, we used to pick up Peter Adamson's son Michael on the way into school every day - Peter Adamson was Len Fairclough in Coronation Street, just a massive soap star.\n\"You could almost argue that not only was I surrounded by football from an early age, but then I had television introduced into my life.\"\nClive spoke about having received the OBE, saying: \"It feels surreal. It feels like the kind of thing that happens to other people; it is very flattering, and it's very touching.\n\"I do feel genuinely honoured, and I think it leads you to be reflective as to firstly how lucky I've been to make a career out of the one thing I really, really wanted to do, and how working in football and television has broadened my horizons and opened doors and opened my eyes to what a lot of other people are doing in far more important areas.\n\"The charity part of the award is really, in a way, a reflection of the kind of extraordinary people that working in communication and working in sport introduces you to. It's been a privilege to help in a small way with various causes and charities that have become very dear to my heart now.\"\nHe added a word for his hometown club, Bury FC, saying: \"I played no part in the resurrection of Bury Football Club, but I have followed it dearly. I was in touch with both parties when the two phoenix clubs arose from the flames.\n\"It really, really is such a heartening story for me in particular. Some of your readers will remember a day when reading in the classified football results at 5pm on a Saturday night was a big deal.\n\"And the very fact that the name of Bury appeared on those lists, even on the old football coupon that many people used to fill in, actually placed the town on the world map, and it is amazing... people know of your town essentially because of the football club.\n\"And if that football club disappears from that list of fixtures, then in many ways the town disappears, and that is the importance of the way that the football tradition in the town is being revived.\"\nClive chose the 1999 UEFA Champions League final between Manchester United and Bayern Munich as one of the most important matches of his career.\nHe said: \"It was the final game of my first season as ITV's senior commentator, in succession to a true legend of our business called Brian Moore.\n\"Not to put too fine a point on it, if I had messed up that year, at any stage in that year, ITV would probably have found somebody far more experienced than me and very kindly replaced me.\n\"There was a 20 million audience for that Manchester United final, and obviously, they were chasing a treble. If I had got the goalscorers wrong at the end of that game, if I had shouted Dwight Yorke when Ole Solskjaer scored, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation.\n\"ITV took a bit of a chance on me, even though I had spent two years understudying Brian Moore and learning the trade from and with him. They promoted me into the senior seat that season, and that was the climax of that season, and I managed to get the goalscorers right.\n\"That was a very important game in my career.\"\nClive will receive his OBE from King Charles during an official ceremony in the New Year.",
