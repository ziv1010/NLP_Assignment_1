  "body_text": "To top off a terrible period over the last few weeks that saw Newcastle bomb out of both the Champions League vs AC Milan and the Carabao Cup Quarterfinal against Chelsea FC due to parallel meltdowns in the closing minutes of each respective match, Football’s apex Grinch and current Real Madrid president Florentino Perez decided to ruin everyone’s Holiday Season by announcing fresh plans for the defunct Super League on Thursday, Dec. 21.\nThe European Super League is back!\nWhat is the new proposed format, and how will Newcastle be involved?\nWhile all the details are still developing, a fresh blueprint for a revamped “Super League” is sure to dominate sports media worldwide for the next few weeks. What catalyzed Perez’s gleeful statement on Thursday was a court ruling by the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Justice that essentially agreed that both UEFA and FIFA overstepped their authority back in 2021 when they actively threw roadblocks into the Super League pathway.\nBefore we get into which clubs are already involved, let’s review the original Super League Plan: 12 founding member clubs who could not be relegated which included Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester United, and Manchester City from the EPL. Inter Milan, AC Milan, and Juventus from Serie A. Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid, and Barcelona from La Liga.\nIt’s important to note that all twelve of these clubs had already agreed to participate and therefore would be due a cut of the initial investment said to be around $400m at a minimum. The Board was littered with members of these club’s leadership led by Perez at the top, Andrea Agnelli of Juventus, and the Glazers of Manchester United. Stan Kroenke of Arsenal, already a villain for trying to block the World Cup from playing matches at Sofi Stadium (Los Angeles) in an effort to make himself richer, was also heavily involved.\nThe founding members assumed they would round out the league by extending invitations to top clubs from League One in France, the Bundesliga, and the Eredivisie who would then be promoted and relegated annually in the coming years. But as we all know, there was an immediate backlash by fans, local politicians, and finally FIFA and UEFA who galvanized the negative press to halt the proceedings. It’s worth noting that Bundesliga Clubs were really the heroes in the Super League’s initial collapse by immediately rejecting the proposal, and Manchester City was quick to pull out of the plan thereafter.\nThe newly proposed Super League would now include 64 teams. 16 would make up the Star League, 16 in a Gold League, and 32 clubs to complete a Blue League, each of which would include relegation and promotion. While on paper this would appear similar to the Champion’s League, Europa, and Europa Conference League format, the glaring difference is that following a season like last year, Newcastle would have at best gained entry into the Blue League and therefore be managing all of the current growing pains and injuries while being two full seasons away from the Star League. Likewise, if you are following Girona FC’s magical season in La Liga thus far, the best they could hope for is the 32-team Blue League in 2024-2025.\nThis story is still developing, but as of now here are where some of the top clubs around the world stand:\nClubs IN: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Napoli FC, PSV, Benfica, Porto, Red Star, Anderlecht\nClubs OUT: AS Roma, FC Copenhagen, PSG, Real Sociedad, Seville FC, Atletico Madrid, AC Milan, Bundesliga\nClubs Waiting: Feyenoord, the Big Three Istanbul Clubs from Turkey (Galatasaray, Besiktas, Fenerbahce).\nAs the English Premier League is the most lucrative league in current world football and its participation is pivotal for the plan to move forward, there should be no surprise that owners like the Glazers and Kroenke will be calculating the international response over the coming days before they reveal their true intentions.\nExpect “outsider” clubs like Manchester City and our own Newcastle to make their decisions in response to where those who were initially involved in the Super League (Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham) decide to throw their support.\nWhat do you think will be the PIF-backed Magpies’ next move?",
