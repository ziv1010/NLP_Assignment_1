We have got this far by playing our football and now it is all about revealing the full force of that.\"\nVictory against Reims at the Stade de France would allow PSG to repeat their French league and cup double triumph from last season, during Luis Enrique's first campaign in charge.\nWhile they have never won the Champions League, they have won the French Cup a record 15 times, including seven times in the last 10 seasons.\nREAD: PSG are deserving Champions League finalists, says Luis Enrique\n\"We need to take one thing at a time. Before thinking about the Champions League our thoughts are on the French Cup final because it is important to win every trophy,\" said Ousmane Dembele, PSG's top scorer this season with 33 goals in all competitions.\nPSG finished the Ligue 1 season 19 points clear of runners-up Marseille, a gulf that confirms how far ahead of the rest they are in France.\nTheir French Cup run, however, has been kind, throwing up four successive ties against lower-league opposition since a win on penalties at Lens in December.\n- Reims' relegation fears -\nNow they take on a side who are hanging on to their top-flight status by a thread and whose own focus is also elsewhere just now.\nReaching the final was huge for Reims, who twice won the French Cup during their glory days in the 1950s but had not got this far since 1977, when Saint-Etienne beat them to take the trophy.\nYet the occasion has been soured, even completely ruined, after they dropped into the relegation play-off place on the final day of the Ligue 1 season last weekend.\nThe trip to the national stadium therefore comes in between the two legs of the play-off tie against second-tier Metz, in which they must prevail if they are to remain in the elite next season.\nThe first leg on Wednesday ended in a 1-1 draw, with Reims coming from behind to put themselves in a good position before the return at home next Thursday.\nCoach Samba Diawara is now hopeful his team can simply go out and enjoy the final with the pressure off.\n\"We need to make sure we recover well and despite everything try to enjoy the final. We can't sacrifice such an occasion,\" he said after Wednesday's game.\n\"I want my players to savour it, really make the most of the final, without compromising our chances for what follows. I don't want anyone getting injured.\"\nReims, whose last major honour was the league title won in 1962, can take confidence from the fact they held PSG to draws in both league meetings earlier this season.",
