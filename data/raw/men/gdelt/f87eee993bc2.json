They are in the market for a new striker this month and while Rashford generally plays on the left-wing, he can play there when required.\nWest Ham among FIVE clubs chasing Rashford\nAs reported, AC Milan and Como are interested in Rashford, with Milan holding talks with his representatives, but Rashford’s wages represent an obstacle for the trio.\nTEAMtalk correspondent Rudy Galetti revealed earlier this month that Borussia Dortmund have also shown interest in Rashford and the German giants have also held talks with his agents, along with another big Italian side – Juventus.\nA switch to West Ham would come as a major shock considering the size of some of the European sides chasing Rashford and that they can offer him Champions League football.\nBut according to Crook and West Ham source on X, ExWHUEmployee, West Ham are keeping tabs on his situation and are interested in a loan deal.\n— ExWHUEmployee (@ExWHUEmployee) January 9, 2025\nThe Hammers have just appointed Graham Potter as their new manager and the club are keen to back him with some new additions in January.\nAs mentioned, a new striker is a priority for Potter due to the injury to Michail Antonio. Brighton’s Evan Ferguson is on their shortlist among others, as we have previously reported.\nA move for Rashford would be a big statement from the Hammers but also a risk given his huge wages and poor form this season. The player is open to leaving Old Trafford but wants to stay in Europe and ensure he’s a starter for England in the 2026 World Cup.\nDON’T MISS: 10 high-profile players who could move in the January transfer window: Rashford, Alexander-Arnold…\nMan Utd round-up: Mainoo demands revealed / Kolo Muani linked\nMeanwhile, sources have revealed to TEAMtalk that Kobbie Mainoo is prioritising contract talks with Man Utd, despite concrete interest from Chelsea.\nThe Red Devils have been trying to tie the midfielder down to a new deal for some time but so far, no real progress has been made in negotiations.\nSome outlets have claimed that Mainoo is demanding over £200,000 per week for a new deal, but TEAMtalk understands that this is not the case. He wants to be in line with some of Man Utd’s first team players but his demands aren’t that high.\nChelsea do hold concrete interest in Mainoo though and are ready to move for him if the player indicates he’s open to a Stamford Bridge switch.\nIn other news, Man Utd are one of several clubs keeping tabs on Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani, although Tottenham are leading the race at this stage.",
