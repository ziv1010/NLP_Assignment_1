Frida Maanum and Beth Mead were the goalscorers at the Emirates.\nThe Foxes, on the other hand, began their 2024/25 campaign away at Liverpool. After falling behind to a Sophie Roman Haug header in the first half, Jutta Rantala levelled the scoreline in the second half.\nArsenal finished third in the standings last season, so the Gunners will hope to push up the table this term and challenge for major honours. Leicester have begun a new era under manager Amandine Miquel, so this will be somewhat of a transition year for the club.\nHere’s 90min’s preview of Sunday’s clash at the King Power.\nWhat time does Leicester City vs Arsenal kick-off?\n- Location: Leicester, England\n- Stadium: King Power Stadium\n- Date: Sunday 29 September\n- Kick-off Time: 15:00 (BST) / 16:00 (CET) / 10:00 (ET)\n- Referee: Jane Simms\nLeicester City vs Arsenal H2H record\n- Leicester City: 0 wins\n- Arsenal: 6 wins\n- Draws: 0\n- Last meeting: Arsenal 3-0 Leicester City (21 April 2024) - WSL\nCurrent form (all competitions)\nHow to watch Leicester City vs Arsenal\nLeicester City team news\nSpeaking ahead of Sunday’s game, Miquel confirmed there are no new injuries in the squad, and those that travelled to Merseyside to face Liverpool will be available again this weekend. However, they do have a longer term absentee in Lena Petermann.\nThe forward suffered a knee injury during their pre-season tour in Australia, so they’re allowing time for her to recover. As it is inflammation pain, her workload is being closely managed, but she will be unavailable for Sunday’s meeting with Arsenal.\nHannah Cain is the longer term absentee after she suffered another ACL injury at the end of last year. Miquel couldn’t provide an exact timeframe on her return, but did confirm the Wales international is progressing well, and they hope to have her available for selection again soon.\nLeicester City predicted lineup vs Arsenal\nLeicester City predicted lineup vs Arsenal (4-3-3): Kop; Bott, Howard, Thibaud, Cayman; Tierney, Mace, Momiki; Rantala, Mouchon, Goodwin\nArsenal team news\nLeah Williamson has been unavailable for the last couple of games due to concussion. She missed Thursday night’s Champions League clash against BK Hacken, and Jonas Eidevall is yet to provide a timeframe on her return.\nLina Hurtig took part in team training this week, while Steph Catley trained individually. Both missed the midweek game against Hacken, but it remains to be seen whether they will be fit to face Leicester City.\nArsenal predicted lineup vs Leicester City\nArsenal predicted lineup vs Leicester City (4-2-3-1): Zinsberger; Fox, Wubben-Moy, Codina, McCabe; Little, Cooney-Cross; Foord, Maanum, Caldentey; Russo\nLeicester City vs Arsenal score prediction\nArsenal have had a tough week against Manchester City in the WSL and BK Hacken in the Champions League. However, they looked at their clinical best on Thursday night as they secured their place in the group stage of the European competition.\nEidevall will hope his team’s Champions League form can translate into a strong league performance this weekend. They have a strong record against the Foxes, so it’s likely this match will be no different.\nIt’s too early to know just how competitive Leicester City will be this season as they’re working under a new manager. However, if their performance against Liverpool is anything to go by, they won’t be beaten easily.",
