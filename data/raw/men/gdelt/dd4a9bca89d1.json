They are currently on course to do just that.\nBut the potential unavailability of Isak doesn’t mean Liverpool can just neglect their need for a new striker. Darwin Nunez has not lived up to expectations since his 2022 move from Benfica, with every impactful performance he produces seemingly separated by several more ineffective ones.\nThus, Liverpool are having to search for other targets they could bring in to replace Nunez. One option TEAMtalk learned was on their shortlist last month is Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa.\nWatkins was the subject of an approach by Arsenal late in the January transfer window, but it might not have been his last chance at joining a title contender.\nAccording to Football Insider, Liverpool have now pivoted away from Isak and to Watkins, whose situation they are said to be ‘closely monitoring’.\nWatkins has been usurped in Unai Emery’s pecking order recently by Marcus Rashford, who Villa have the option to buy from Manchester United after his loan spell.\nThe implication is that if Villa activate that option, Watkins may pursue a move away from the club – which could play into Liverpool’s hands.\nWatkins has had long-term admirers at Anfield, including former Reds manager Jurgen Klopp, who called him a ‘really, really talented striker’ after he scored a hat trick against Liverpool in 2021.\nVilla have Watkins under contract still until 2028.\nREAD MORE 👉 Liverpool wages: Top 10 highest-paid players at Anfield after new Salah, Van Dijk deals\nEmery shares Watkins latest as Liverpool shortlist revealed\nThe bid Villa turned down from Arsenal for Watkins in January was worth around £60m.\nAt the age of 29, he is one of the older names on Liverpool’s shortlist, which we have revealed also includes Eintracht Frankfurt’s 22-year-old, Hugo Ekitike.\nLiverpool had plans to watch Ekitike for a second time this month during Eintracht’s Europa League clash with Tottenham Hotspur earlier this week.\nInter Milan’s Marcus Thuram, 27, has also been placed on Liverpool’s shortlist. Nunez, meanwhile, could leave for another Premier League club or move to the Saudi Pro League.\nAs for Rashford’s part in this sequence of events, Villa are yet to decide whether or not to sign him on a permanent basis.\nEmery may have preferred Rashford in recent weeks, but said on Friday about Watkins: “It was my selection, tactically. We are adding more competition, more matches and we are hitting another level.\n“Of course, Watkins is very, very important for us. He’s scoring goals for us, and last Saturday, his impact was fantastic. On Tuesday, it was difficult for him to read the match and show his power. But he worked, he is ready.\n“I am so, so happy with him, and I want to win tomorrow. As players, they can be sad at not playing or angry at not playing – I prefer angry.”\nLiverpool transfer news: Showdown talks\nIn other Liverpool news, another forward is facing an uncertain future in the shape of Luis Diaz.\nThe winger isn’t among Liverpool’s best-paid players and is now reportedly set for showdown talks about his future.\nThere could already be plans to replace him at Anfield after other reports claimed Liverpool have asked about a Bundesliga attacker also on Man Utd’s radar.\nElsewhere, two clubs that tried to sign Virgil van Dijk before he signed his contract extension have been identified.",
