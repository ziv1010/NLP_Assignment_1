That still seems a long way off with Chelsea in 10th place in the Premier League, 25 points behind Liverpool, who his side face in Sunday’s League Cup final at Wembley.\nLiverpool thrashed Chelsea 4-1 last month -- a result that illustrated the gap between the sides. But since then there are signs Pochettino is beginning to solve the Chelsea puzzle. An FA Cup win over Aston Villa, a league win at Crystal Palace and a gritty draw with Manchester City mean Chelsea will start Sunday’s showpiece in a positive frame of mind.\nLiverpool’s lengthy injury list also levels the playing field with the likes of Diogo Jota, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Alisson and Curtis Jones ruled out and forwards Mohamed Salah and Darwin Nunez and midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai facing fitness tests.\nChelsea have lost their last five domestic Cup finals at Wembley, including the League Cup and FA Cup to Liverpool in 2021-22, both matches decided by penalty shootouts. Liverpool boss Juergen Klopp, however, labelled Chelsea favourites for Sunday’s showdown in view of his injury list. “If they are not favourites, we are not favourites,” Pochettino joked on Friday. “They have experience to compete like a team, be involved in different finals. For many of our players, it’s maybe their first final. He is clever enough.”\nPochettino’s first taste of an English domestic cup final was in 2015 when his Tottenham side lost to Chelsea in the League Cup. His Tottenham team also lost to Chelsea in the 2017 FA Cup semi-final -- another near-miss for a squad that Pochettino moulded into one of the best in Europe, but ultimately could not deliver silverware.\nChelsea are a vastly-different project for Pochettino who is still grappling to knit together a squad that cost hundreds of millions of pounds to assemble. But winning a sixth League Cup for Chelsea could be the spark that ignites his Stamford Bridge reign -- as it did for Jose Mourinho in his first spell in charge of Chelsea. “It means a lot for us, the coaching staff to arrive in the final and to challenge a team like Liverpool and win our first title here,” Pochettino told reporters on Friday.\n-\nKate Middleton Proves She's True 'children's Princess' With THIS Move\n-\nPaul Anka Reveals How He Raised Son Ethan Differently From His Daughters\n-\n'A Very Special Visitor' Meets Queen Camilla At Clarence House\n-\nJodie Turner Smith Shares One Strict Rule She Follows As A Mom\n-\nHailey Bieber Reveals KEY To Balancing Motherhood With Career\n-\nPhoto Of Jay-Z, Other Prominent Figures With Jeffrey Epstein Proven To Be Fake\n-\nHillary Clinton's Munich Train Video Sparks Conspiracy Theories\n-\nFans Slam Talk Show Host For 'cringe' Behavior In Chris Hemsworth Interview\n-\nWoman Jailed Over False 'crime In Space' Claim Against NASA Astronaut\n-\nJames Van Der Beek’s Close Pal Reveals Family's Dire Need Of Donations\n-\nPrince William And Harry's Cousins Attend 'Wuthering Heights' Event\n-\nHailey Bieber Turns Heads Just Hours After Major Business Win\n-\nKing Charles' Andrew Decision Labelled 'long Overdue'\n-\nTimothee Chalamet 'forever Indebted' To Fan Over Kind Gesture\n-\nColumbia University Sacks Staff Over Epstein Partner's ‘backdoor’ Admission\n-\nOzzy Osbourne's Family Struggles Behind Closed Doors",
