In less than 10 days, at least 10 persons were confirmed brutally killed in cult-related violence.\nA teenage boy resident in the Mushin area was among the innocent residents whose lives had been cut short by the latest spate of attacks.\nIn the past, cultism, as it was commonly understood, occurred mostly inside higher education institutions.\nHowever, recent events and police arrests indicate that the threat is rapidly spreading into the streets, where vendors, barbers, and vulcanisers are joining the deadly cult in large numbers.\nDeadly fights that were only seen on varsity and polytechnic campuses have now become regular occurrences in communities that had been relatively peaceful, with killings being openly spiralling into places of worship, football fields, and even family homes.\nSevered human limbs have now become prized trophies for these deadly groups, flaunted like the Champions League cup, while human lives are tallied as casually as goals in a football match.\nSpeedboats, once relied upon by residents to shorten long journeys and manoeuvre Lagos traffic, have now been repurposed as tools for criminal gangs to launch violent attacks on many Lagos communities.\nDespite repeated police crackdowns, the menace persists, and while the state police command insists it will not kowtow to pressure, the wave of violence shows no sign of ending or abatement.\nRiverbank killings\nThree persons were brutally murdered during a masquerader festival that began on Sunday, August 31, in Lagos Island.\nSome members of the family involved in the festival, who are also believed to belong to various cult groups in Lagos, hijacked the event and turned it into a supremacy battle.\n“We had just finished the festival when a fight broke out among some boys suspected to be cultists. And before we knew it, they had started throwing bottles at one another while also wielding some dangerous weapons.\n“Nobody could even wait to calm the situation other than to run for cover,” a resident who did not want to be mentioned because of the sensitivity of the incident, narrated.\nVideos of the chaos captured scenes of heavy gunfire as suspected cultists chased one another through Lagos Street.\nIn one clip, at least five shots rang out, while a mob of no fewer than 10 men was seen brutally assaulting a victim.\nThe bloodshed did not end there. On Wednesday, September 3, 2025, another tragedy unfolded when five bodies washed up along the Oreta riverbank in Igbogbo, Ikorodu.\nWhile some residents claimed the victims drowned, others told our correspondent that cultists ferried them in speedboats before executing them. What no one disputed was that the killings were deliberate cult-related.\nLess than 24 hours earlier, Baiyeku, another Ikorodu community, was rocked by the killing of a young man whose identity residents were reluctant to disclose to The PUNCH during a phone call last Saturday. Suspected cultists cut off his wrists and feet, displaying the severed parts at a shrine in what residents saw as a ritualistic warning.\n“This is beyond fighting. This has turned into a war. Only an animal can carry out such killings,” one resident in Ikorodu who pleaded anonymity for fear of attack said last Saturday.\n“The boy wasn’t a cultist. We think it’s about land. But whoever did this wanted the whole community to see and tremble,” the resident added.\nThe Chairman of Igbogbo/Baiyeku LCDA, Hammed Aroyewun, in a statement on Wednesday, September 3, after the killing in Bayeku, disclosed that he rushed to the scene with security operatives.\nHe said, “Our people deserve to live in peace and without fear. This administration will continue to deploy every necessary resource, in close partnership with security agencies, to guarantee safety and restore lasting peace.”\nResidents described the incident as “painful, unacceptable, and a direct affront to peace.” Patrols were immediately ordered, but residents told PUNCH Metro that fear lingers despite police assurance and calls for calm.\nOn Sunday, there was a report of fresh violence in the Ibeju-Lekki area, where suspected rival cult groups clashed, leaving two people dead.\nBy Tuesday, two additional bodies were discovered along the LASU-Igando Road in the Iba area of the state.\nIn Meiran, as reported by PUNCH Metro on July 25, another chapter unfolded. Rahman, a known member of the Aye cult, tried to outrun his rivals but found no sanctuary.\nThe killer squad of some suspected Eiye cult group in the area, we gathered, pursued him into his family home, dragged him out, and killed him in front of his relatives.\n“They didn’t stop there. They injured people inside the house. It was like a war invasion,” the neighbour who did not want to be mentioned because of fear of attack told our correspondent.\nThe carnage has not spared the innocent. In Mushin, a 12-year-old boy named Wasiu was sent by his mother to buy food late June. He never returned. A stray bullet from a cult shootout pierced his body, ending his life on the street.\nThe incident sent shockwaves across Mushin. “We are tired. Today, it is Wasiu; tomorrow, it could be any of our children,” a source in the community told our correspondent.\nThe long-held belief that cult groups spare civilians is fast fading, as recent killings in Lagos State reveal that innocent residents are increasingly becoming targets of these senseless attacks.\nIn Eti-Osa, an initiation rite in July turned bloody when rival cultists stormed the gathering. 26-year-old Timilehin, an artisan, was shot dead before he could even complete the process of joining.\nThe police later confirmed that initiation grounds had increasingly become targets of violent rivalries, with attacks staged specifically to send messages of dominance.\nNo area epitomised the spiral of violence more than Ebute Meta in recent times. One of the incidents includes the killing of a 30-year-old man better known as Keeper. His death set off reprisals that claimed more lives in quick succession.\nThe immediate past spokesperson for the state police command, Benjamin Hundeyin, had detailed the arrests that followed the killings.\nIn a statement, he wrote, “Detectives arrested Raphael Ashim, 30; Wasiu Kareem, 33; Sadiq Olabisi, 40; Olamilekan Oluwatosin, 27; Olalekan Olugbodi, 54; and Ibrahim Oladimeji, 22. All of them were involved in cult clashes in Ebute Meta and its environs, which led to the gruesome murder of one Kamoru, alias Keeper.”\nDespite the mass arrests, the killings continued. In quick succession, three more men named Agbara, Butcher, and an unnamed plumber were gruesomely murdered in scenes reminiscent of horror films.\nPolice crackdown\nFaced with mounting criticism, the state police command refused to be overwhelmed by the recent killings as it launched an aggressive clampdown.\nThe police chief, Olohundare Jimoh, in an exclusive telephone interview with PUNCH PANORAMA, confirmed that more than 26 suspects had been arrested in recent operations.\n“Recently, I’ve created an Anti-Cultism Squad in every area command. Now, we have created a central one at the command headquarters to deal with cult clashes.\n“What you are witnessing now is attack and counterattack. It is important for parents to weigh in on this and compel their children to desist from cultism.”\nThe command also redeployed Divisional Police Officers in volatile districts such as Lekki, Ajah, Ogombo, and Elemoro and activated the Eko Strike Force, a special intervention unit.\nIn an earlier official statement on September 2, the command added, “The command calls on residents to cooperate fully with the intervention team to ensure success and maintain safety.”\nThe entanglement of cult groups with land disputes, street gangs, and even local festivals, observers believe, is fuelling reprisals and trapping communities in an endless cycle of violence.\nShared responsibility\nThe command told PUNCH PANORAMA that victory over these emerging insurgents can only be secured if community leaders, parents, and religious institutions join forces and work closely with the police.\n“Nowadays, it is not idleness or joblessness that forces people into cultism. These days, you will even see artisans and others engage in cultism.\n“Parents must know where their children are and encourage them to denounce cultism,” Jimoh said.\nTo curb the relentless killings and rising street attacks across Lagos, community leaders, residents, and traditional rulers must close ranks with the police to unmask these murderous groups hiding under the cloak of cultism—before they turn every doorstep in the state into a graveyard.",
