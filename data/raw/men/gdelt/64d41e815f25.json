We’re very happy that we got three points and won.\n“The chances are always coming so you just have to be ready for it. Playing with Mariona is so fun, I always know what to expect from her. It’s a great present today.”\nAsked about our second-biggest away following in the Champions League after last season’s final, Smith added: “It was amazing. It was so motivating and the atmosphere for us was great. I think that gave us more motivation to keep going for more goals.”\nIt was a big occasion in general, with over 9,000 fans setting a new record for women’s football in Belgium.\n“It’s exciting to see where women’s football is going in other countries as well, it’s very positive,” Smith said.\nNow, Smith is looking forward to ending the year on a high by trying to get through to the semi-finals of the Subway Women’s League Cup.\n“Yeah, 100%. I’m quite sure we will, I think we’re performing really well. Everyone is excited to keep moving forward.”\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
