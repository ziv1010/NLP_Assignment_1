  "body_text": "John Obi Mikel hopes ‘there is a door open’ for Victor Osimhen at Arsenal this summer, suggesting Manchester United could still land the Nigeria striker despite having no European football on offer next season.\nOsimhen is set to return to Napoli after a loan spell in Turkey with Galatasaray where he scored 37 goals in 41 appearances.\nThe 26-year-old is not part of Antonio Conte’s plans however with the relationship between the Italian champions and their player breaking down during a tumultuous summer transfer window last year. Galatasaray are eager to keep in him Istanbul for another season while Al-Hilal are interested in bringing him to Saudi Arabia.\nBut Osimhen’s goal has been and still is to secure a move to the Premier League, according to his countryman Mikel.\nThe former Chelsea midfielder was desperate to see Osimhen move to Stamford Bridge this summer after a move fell apart at the eleventh hour last year.\nBut Liam Delap’s imminent arrival in west London from Ipswich Town appears to have ended their interest with the England Under-21 international set to compete with Nicolas Jackson for a starting berth next season.\nRuing Chelsea’s missed opportunity to bring in an option who can ‘hit the ground running’, Mikel believes there are two realistic options in Arsenal and United, adamant Ruben Amorim’s side need an upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘I hope there is still a Premier League move for him this summer’, Mikel told Metro.\n‘I think the likes of Arsenal and Manchester United, they still need a striker. I don’t think [Rasmus] Hojlund is the guy for Manchester United. He runs around and works hard but he is not the guy who will score goals, put them in the top four and win them trophies. So for me Manchester United might be the destination.\n‘I don’t want to see him in Saudi right now because he still has so much to offer in Europe. It would be a shame to see him go there. So maybe Arsenal, United, Juventus and PSG too [are his options]. Let’s see what happens.’\nOsimhen could sacrifice Europe for a season with Man Utd\nUnited’s failure to qualify for Europe next season will have financial ramifications but it doesn’t appear to have damaged their pull power so far with Matheus Cunha arriving and Bryan Mbeumo prepared to join them over Newcastle United and Arsenal.\nOsimhen may be a different story having shone on the European stage for Napoli in previous years. While their absence from the Champions League and Europa League may ultimately cost them, Mikel believes there is a chance his countryman could ‘sacrifice’ a season to help lift United from their malaise.\n‘I think so,’ Mikel said when asked if a lack of European football could derail United’s chances of signing Osimhen. ‘As the top striker and player I know he is, yes I think that would be a factor.\n‘Maybe he would say, “I will give it a season.” Knowing he is in the squad with a few other signings that Ruben Amorim gets in, the players he wants, it is something Victor might consider. Maybe he would think about sacrificing a season.\n‘We have to wait and see. But I think we want to see him in the Champions League so maybe Arsenal might be the destination. Maybe there is a door open there for Victor.\n‘I’ve had a few conversations with him. I won’t say much about what those conversations were but he is working to make sure he ends up at a top, top European league where he can showcase his and talent and compete to win the Champions League.’\nMikel reacts to Chelsea signing Delap over Osimhen\nMikel doesn’t hide the fact he was desperate to see his old side bring in Osimhen, a player he believes would provide an instant lift.\nMore Trending\n‘Everyone knows who I wanted to see come to the football club and who the fans wanted to see come to the football club, Mikel said.\n‘It is a shame he didn’t come to Chelsea, the club he supported as a kid growing up, but they have decided to go in a different direction [signing Delap] which is fine, I hope it works out for him at the club.\n‘But I would have loved to see someone come in to hit the ground running straight away, who knows how to play in big games, in big competitions who has been there and done it. But we have to support Delap and make sure it works out for him.’\nJohn Obi Mikel was speaking ahead of the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup 2025.
