It's down to Dyche and Thelwell now to recruit well\n12 Posted 27/06/2023 at 15:44:11\n13 Posted 27/06/2023 at 15:45:07\n14 Posted 27/06/2023 at 15:48:00\n15 Posted 27/06/2023 at 15:49:19\n16 Posted 27/06/2023 at 16:10:07\nI was going through the transfers listed under the Players section at the top looking for the name of the young keeper we signed from Morecambe, Crilihy(?) I think, and I was surprised at how many young players we have signed and the few who have made it, going back to Sambou from Coventry. Those few who did didn't hang around long at Everton and I wonder if it started with that great \"Once a blue always a blue\" and \"I'd have given them another season maybe two before moving on\" Rooney.\nI think all we have in the 1st team squad now are Simms (ex Man City junior?), Calvert-Lewin and Holgate, leaving aside Branthwiate.\nNB; the Rooney reference is more from a timing point of view rather than he was signed from another club.\n17 Posted 27/06/2023 at 16:14:08\n18 Posted 27/06/2023 at 16:14:50\nSurely he's going to get a chance preseason, he'd suit Dyche's approach I imagine and given his injury record (good) once in I can't imagine him not playing.\nSo I'd file under 'utter rubbish', and move on!\n19 Posted 27/06/2023 at 16:24:47\nI could never understand why he was out on loan for so long - a star in the making, and should have been with us all season.\nIt must be so toxic at the club right now, when the lad is asking to leave. Other teams know how good he is, and will come swooping in for him.\nNo decent player wants to stay at Everton, and no decent player wants to come to Everton.\nMay EFC Rest In Peace\n20 Posted 27/06/2023 at 16:25:03\nThis was one quote from 3 weeks ago:\n\"That is always difficult to say as a professional football player.\n\"I am under contract with Everton, so it is their right not to want to sell me, of course. I am absolutely open to staying at PSV, but the clubs have to decide together.\"\nThen 12 days ago he said:\n\"I think every kid's goal is to play in the Premier League. That would be my main ambition. Just to solidify myself in a team in the Premier League at Everton and play as many games as I can.\"\nSounds like he isn't throwing a fit saying \"I want to leave,\" and he points out it's up to Everton as he is under contract. But on the other hand he doesn't want to close doors if the Premier League dream isn't on the cards now.\nI wonder if the Guardian will do an expose linking his \"mood change\" to Usmanov?\n21 Posted 27/06/2023 at 16:28:14\nAt the moment it's looking like its heading for 15mins before chucking out time at the local nightclub and there's only desperate measures left to pull. (Edited a couple of times before posting in the interests of political correctness!)\n22 Posted 27/06/2023 at 16:34:42\nIn my opinion, he will be better than Stones, given a decent chance. I was hoping it would be with us.\nNot less than 㿀M, plus 20% of any future sale and 㾶M based on 50 appearances.\n23 Posted 27/06/2023 at 16:50:36\nThe only figure I've seen is 㾻M. Where did you see such a low figure?\n24 Posted 27/06/2023 at 17:06:13\n25 Posted 27/06/2023 at 17:13:16\nIf he stays with us I bet he will be offered an improved contract.\nI see Coady is heading to Leicester.\n26 Posted 27/06/2023 at 17:21:57\nI expect him to play this season. He will generate a bigger fee for us next summer if he plays and does well.\n27 Posted 27/06/2023 at 17:23:15\nWhen he makes the occasional mistake, we have to support him. His ability and headroom to improve is huge.\nIf indeed he does want to leave, then shame on the club, the infrastructure and everything connected to the club: it's one thing to have to sell your best players to further their careers (Rooney, Lukaku, Fellaini, Stones, Arteta) but to be unattractive to hot potential that we already ownâ€¦ gimme a break.\nIs there anything positive about being an Evertonian right now??\n28 Posted 27/06/2023 at 17:32:27\nNew ground on the horizon which we can only hope will bring us good times other than this â€“ Sweet FA Ben!\n29 Posted 27/06/2023 at 17:34:22\nHe's on a long contract and I'd be furious if we let him go for anything less than 㿅M.\n30 Posted 27/06/2023 at 17:50:44\nThis seems so obvious but...\n31 Posted 27/06/2023 at 18:00:37\nA star that we need to keep.\nThe thought of him leaving and Holgate staying depresses me.\n32 Posted 27/06/2023 at 18:28:47\nThat's the way it is nowadays. We can't make him play, contract or not. There is no club or fan affiliation. Cash is king.\n33 Posted 27/06/2023 at 18:38:12\n34 Posted 27/06/2023 at 18:41:48\nBetween Alan Hansen like (Coady is our future) fans, dinosaur managers, and mismanagement instigated crisis, we just don't offer kids a pathway.\nWe could be the UK's Dortmundâ€¦ well, okay, maybe not, but we did once attract Stones, Deulofeu and Lukaku.\nA gamble on youth is our only way back. Without it, that's the point? Do everything to convince him to stay.\n35 Posted 27/06/2023 at 18:46:27\nBranthwaite is the one lad I have high hopes for above all others. He has the size and the ability to be a top class Premier League player.\nWe have already lost Mina, Coady and look like sending Holgate out on loan so there is a real opportunity for the lad.\nOffer Keane to Moyes for 㿀M instead and that can go in the kitty.\n36 Posted 27/06/2023 at 18:59:45\n37 Posted 27/06/2023 at 19:09:29\nI'd be surprised and disappointed if this was true.\n38 Posted 27/06/2023 at 19:15:48\n39 Posted 27/06/2023 at 19:27:36\nWasn't he left out after that game? Far too slow for the Premier League. Having watched him at Blackburn he's a ball-watcher and that's Keane's problem.\nBranthwaite's first game for Everton at Wolves was a total disaster, certainly at fault for two of the three goals conceded.\nEverton need experience to keep us from the drop;\nBranthwaite is not the answer.\n40 Posted 27/06/2023 at 19:35:06\nIf something reliable is brought up, then it's worth talking about. Currently, nothing to see here.\n41 Posted 27/06/2023 at 19:35:16\n42 Posted 27/06/2023 at 19:41:41\nHe's certainly not slow mate. What are you watching?\nNext you'll say he's short!\n43 Posted 27/06/2023 at 19:45:30\nThe biggest load of garbage I have read in a long time.\nFrom what planet do you hail?\n44 Posted 27/06/2023 at 19:46:55\nHe will want to be playing football regularly like last season. I think, if he was a guaranteed first-choice starter for us, he would embrace it. I'm not convinced Dyche will bet the ranch on him this season as a regular first choice.\nDyche was a centre-back so will have a clear idea what he wants; it wouldn't surprise me in the least if he has a central defender he's scouted for months he wants to sign to partner Tarkowski.\nBranthwaite is quality and will grow into a top-class defender; it will be a crying shame if it's not with Everton.\n45 Posted 27/06/2023 at 19:50:56\n46 Posted 27/06/2023 at 19:52:50\nYour stop-gap OAP Army plan might stave off relegation for one season. Then what?\nSad that you write off kids like this.\n47 Posted 27/06/2023 at 19:57:01\n48 Posted 27/06/2023 at 20:26:49\nI happen to agree with most of what you say; I doubt that Dyche will want to start the season with a relatively inexperienced defender.\nOur priority this season is to stay up, forget Top 8 and cup wins, staying up from where we are now will be a feat.\n49 Posted 27/06/2023 at 20:33:42\n50 Posted 27/06/2023 at 20:41:51\nIt is well known that Jarrad is absolutely rapid for his size. He is young and still has a lot to learn but don't worry if he stays you can get your kicks by knocking him and bitching about him every time he touches the ball.\nIf you don't, fear not â€“ we have many other 'fans' who will absolutely relish his demise in a blue shirt if he doesn't immediately emulate Ratcliffe.\n51 Posted 27/06/2023 at 20:51:00\nFor those who think he is the next big hope, I would point out that he's only played 9 times for Carlisle, 10 times for Everton and 10 times for Blackburn (loan).\n27 games for PSV.\nObviously he has great potential, but at 21, still very young for a centre-back. Be patient.\nI think the PSV experience will have been great for him and his development. But then I always hear those who say the Dutch league is no comparison.\nI suppose we see where this goes. With Mina gone, Holgate seemingly gone, Coady released from his loan and rumours about Keane, unless the manager has options lined up, I can't see Branthwaite going anywhere.\nEither that or I'm polishing my boots.\n52 Posted 27/06/2023 at 21:29:40\nHe turned 21 today, a left-sided centre-back, 6ft-5in, plenty of pace, good in the air, and will be a huge addition, let's get real.\nWe've got rid of Mina, Coady and trying to move on Holgate, he's under contract until 2025. Tell the redshite, Man Utd and Moyes where to go. If he's allowed go, we really are rock bottom.\n53 Posted 27/06/2023 at 22:10:48\nIf he's not deemed good enough by Dyche and his team for regular 1st team starts and is not willing to stay to earn and fight for his place because he's guaranteed 1st team football elsewhere then fine but the buying club will have to pay handsomely for his services, north of £30m if they want him or jog on\n54 Posted 27/06/2023 at 22:18:37\nEverton that. Long term planning etc etc.\n55 Posted 27/06/2023 at 22:38:56\n56 Posted 27/06/2023 at 22:47:05\n57 Posted 27/06/2023 at 23:29:51\nWe can now expect a repeat of the Rooney saga where Bill cries over the phone to various people in order to gain some sympathy and then duly accepts an offer of 25 million from man Utd. However, due to Bill's amazing business acumen we also get Phil Jones thrown in as part of the deal for $50 grand per week.\n58 Posted 28/06/2023 at 02:32:17\nUnfortunately, Thelwell and Dyche are not the most glamorous pairing to attract players but they are hindered by all the boardroom shit that is polluting the club in the national media.\nIt goes two ways, Thelwell pulls a rabbit out of the hat to signal we are on the up, let's say Kudus, but it's unlikely, so that means picking players from the Championship and from abroad who just want a Premier League wage.\nHowever, if Branthwaite wants to leave, the bidding should start at 㿀 mil.\n59 Posted 28/06/2023 at 06:14:33\nIt would cost us 㿀 million to bring in a washed-up centre-half from one of our Premier League buddies like Spurs â€“ never mind losing one who has a bright future.\n60 Posted 28/06/2023 at 07:16:27\nI can understand it if he wants to go, he has only ever known turmoil at our club and has just had a fantastic season on the continent. However, if we have any sense (which we all know we don't!) we will keep, develop and sell for major profit in 1-2 years, he has a contract.\nWe probably won't do the above though and flog for buttons in a few weeks. I feel even more despondent than ever right now.\n61 Posted 28/06/2023 at 07:50:25\n62 Posted 28/06/2023 at 07:54:56\n63 Posted 28/06/2023 at 08:27:41\nNick, from what I saw, Tarkowski's game wasn't about pace. Playing what we now call a low block, it is about positional awareness and organisation. 30 isn't old for a centre-back.\nAnd the emphasis on block. I read an article somewhere (can't remember where). He had the highest number of blocks (body on the line). In the top 6 for clearances and top 5 for aerial challenges won.\nAnd he's not bad at connecting with that deep cross to the back post, either to score or get it in the danger area.\nBranthwaite would do well to play alongside him.\n64 Posted 28/06/2023 at 11:32:04\nWe are just starting to look light in the centre-back area if we mange to offload Holgate, and Branthwaite isn't ready for 30 plus Premier League matches.\n66 Posted 28/06/2023 at 17:04:44\nWith what looks like becoming a small squad next season, I also think loaning out Holgate is madness. His wages aren't costly, we get no useful money for the loan, and his versatility provides experienced cover in 3-4 positions.\n67 Posted 28/06/2023 at 17:27:06\nNote the protagonistâ€¦\nNote the reasonsâ€¦\nGame, Set and Match, Billy Liar?\nFeels eerily reminiscent yet some clowns still think he's a saviour.\nBack to square zero with Billy Bullshit.\n68 Posted 28/06/2023 at 18:07:44\nEach to their own and I suppose there's no actual football or signings to chat about so it passes the time but the eagerness for some blues to pile in on the club based on absolute mince is mad.\n69 Posted 28/06/2023 at 18:36:48\n70 Posted 28/06/2023 at 18:57:26\nJarred had a pretty disappointing game for me.\nPut in a couple of decent blocks but he was lost a couple of times and looked short on pace. He also did a good imitation of Michael Keane with his lack of concentration.\nI'm very disappointed because I really like the lad and want him to stay but, on today's evidence, he is not ready for the Premier League.\nBy contrast, Garner came on midway through the second half and looked really solid. Good link-up play and passing.\n71 Posted 28/06/2023 at 21:04:17\nThe official website said he had a great game? I still believe he should be given a chance beside Tarkowski.\nMina and Coady are gone, and with Holgate looking like he's on his way out. Why would we sell an England U21 international, and have to try and buy an inferior replacement?\n72 Posted 28/06/2023 at 21:23:33\nHe was good against Chelsea and popped up with the equaliser, but I would reserve judgement on him being a starter from the off, even if he has had a decent season in the Dutch league.\nI think Dyche will give him a chance in the friendlies and take it from there.\n73 Posted 28/06/2023 at 21:44:17\nAnd he has not asked for a transfer.\n74 Posted 28/06/2023 at 21:58:44\nI would not advocate selling him. I still believe he has tons of potential but I was concerned about his game today as he was constantly second to almost every ball and wandered off into space and left his man free on a number of occasions.\nI particularly watched his game today because I was really hoping he would do well and show what he's learned at PSV but it wasn't to be.\n75 Posted 28/06/2023 at 22:12:08\nTarkowski, not only most blocks of all players, but twice the number of the next best!\nWhere would we be without him last season? I think he'd be like an on-pitch coach for Jarrad.\n76 Posted 28/06/2023 at 22:15:33\nThe \"glass half-empty\" brigade are now winding themselves up over half-arsed speculation from an unreliable source about what a youth player who didn't play a minute for the club last season and is unproven in the Premier League may have said (or not).\nThis is then spun out into entirely fictitious transfer talk with made-up prices, all of which show just what a disaster the club is, why we've already gone down before a ball is kicked and yada yada yada. \"You couldn't make it up\" but you have anyway.\nSeriously folks, this is embarrassing.\n77 Posted 29/06/2023 at 00:31:38\n“Nobody wants to sign for us, Nobody wants to stay with us! We are doomed!â€\nAll based on some unreliable internet site, probably controlled by a Kopite.\nAnd some fans sometimes wonder why “nobody listens to us!â€\n78 Posted 29/06/2023 at 08:41:02\nI'm all for having a go at this club for the right reasons. But absolutely destroying the club and crying into my Danka bedspread because of some daft article on Football Insider with no direct quotes?\nI'll pass thanks.\n79 Posted 29/06/2023 at 09:12:28\nI really like Tarkowski - but although he's a good brave, fist-pumping leader, I'm not convinced he's an organiser for Branthwaite to learn from.\nI very much hope that we keep Branthwaite (I'd much rather we sell Onana) but I'd also like to see us sign a Mina-type centre-back in addition â€“ someone with organisational qualities to complement Branthwaite's obvious (but raw) qualities.\nPersonally, I think a Mina replacement is our absolute top priority after the centre-forward position. Everything else we can just about make do (or recruit very cheaply to patch things up).\n80 Posted 29/06/2023 at 09:38:25\nThe spine of the team is so important. If only Mina and Calvert-Lewin hadn't been so injury-prone, the season would have been so different.\nAn influential central defender and a prolific striker are vital signings for us. Otherwise, we are in for much the same as last season.\n81 Posted 29/06/2023 at 10:11:05\nIf the rumours of Branthwaite wanting to leave are true, then there is no point in keeping a player who wants away, just make sure we get a decent price and a 20% sell-on clause in case he turns into the player some believe he will be.\nWith both Mina and Coady leaving and with rumours of Holgate possibly going to Sheffield Utd, we will have to move quickly to cover those losses. Lots for Sean Dyche to decide when he returns to Finch Farm, with Dele Alli returning as well as possibly Gomes and Gbamin, it will be interesting to see what he does with these players.\nI am sure both Gomes and Gbamin can return to their loan clubs, but I think Dele Alli is a completely different problem. After what happened at Besiktas, I doubt that too many clubs would be interested in taking him on loan.\nAlso, a few youngsters are leaving the club. I do question our youth development, as not many in the last few years have been good enough.\n82 Posted 29/06/2023 at 10:20:12\n83 Posted 29/06/2023 at 10:22:14\nAs always with Bill at the helm, we will be up late on deadline day watching us scrape together cast-offs.\n84 Posted 29/06/2023 at 10:22:42\nSo we do need another centre-back and I hope it's in the Mina vein. As you say, Andrew, with a fit Mina and Calvert-Lewin in the side over the past 2 seasons we probably wouldn't have had relegation fights.\nOne player I thought might be a Dyche-type signing at centre-back has just left Liverpool on loan to Aberdeen. Rhys Williams, age 22. He could develop into a good player.\n85 Posted 29/06/2023 at 10:27:35\nBut we can't judge one game. The likes of Keane and Holgate, we know what we will get and it's not going to change from its current modest level. With Branthwaite, I sense there is potential for development.\nThat said, I'd swap him for Bisseck, the German centre-back and captain who was the stand-out player in a surprisingly poor German side.\nI agree, Garner looked neat and tidy when he came on, but there is a hell of a lot of competition for places in midfield and attack. There is a lot of top Premier League experience in this side and they are in with a real shout of winning it.\n86 Posted 29/06/2023 at 10:31:30\nI watched the match last night also. Specifically Jarrad. And can only disagree with most of your analysis of his performance.\nFirst half, he was completely in control of his job. Imperious even. Only on 3 occasions in the match was he second best, and on two of those occasions he got a toe on the ball. However, each of those occasions involved him turning back into the space behind him.\nHard to know from watching last night how fast he is in a straight line (though the coaches will know obviously), but he is slow to turn. A high block, or getting sucked into a turn-and-go doesn't suit him.\nYet. He is young, and raw. But as calm on the ball (maybe calmer) than John stones at his age. Good ball control. Good passer if the ball Very good defending in the air, and at 6'-5\" left-footed, and ours, we would be nuts to let him go now.\nHe will be, like our other tall, talented, young, sometimes not always concentrating,and very raw, but full of potential player in our squad, and will play at the highest level.\nIt's now, for me, all about managing hopes and expectations - ours more so than his. We have way too many on here who don't know, or don't have the patience to understand the difference between the two.\nAnd patience will be required if we play him next season. He will get beaten. Several times. And some of those occasions will cost us goals. Like every other player on the pitch.\n87 Posted 29/06/2023 at 11:46:21\nIf anyone on ToffeeWeb hasn't read the link on Nick's post or don't remember the article when it was first written, I ask you to have a read.\nIt's long but portrays the way Kenwright has run this club since he became chairman, and shows that the club was in dire financial straights when Wayne Rooney was sold, in fact, that transfer saved Everton from going bankrupt.\n88 Posted 29/06/2023 at 12:16:07\nWhile I agree he has potential and we would be mad to let him go, especially for a low fee, can I suggest the main reason he looked good on the ball is that Germany, astonishingly, didn't bother pressing, pretty much at all except a bit in the last 15 or so minutes?\nIt was all very bizarre, almost as though they had given up, especially after the first goal. It might be a different story in a Premier League game when he can expect a lot less time on the ball.\nTo be fair, defenders can always look exposed with a well-timed through ball. I thought Bisseck had a good game but Archer left him and his other centre-back for dead on the first goal. Never seen Archer play before but he sure looks like he has a turn of foot.\nThe German I felt especially sorry for was their left-back. Madueke had him on toast.\n89 Posted 29/06/2023 at 18:13:52\n90 Posted 29/06/2023 at 18:32:59\nAw, don't leave, Rob. Please!\n91 Posted 29/06/2023 at 18:34:54\n92 Posted 29/06/2023 at 18:37:22\n93 Posted 29/06/2023 at 18:39:17\n94 Posted 29/06/2023 at 18:54:37\n95 Posted 29/06/2023 at 19:19:34\nIf anyone is questioning this lads abilities you don't have to go too far back to remember his excellent and stoic performances for the first team as a 19 year old, thrown completely in at the deep end. The lad is going all the way to the top I tells ya.\n96 Posted 30/06/2023 at 12:41:22\nSo many poor decisions made by so many people especially the hierarchy that have plunged the club into the bottom rung of the Premier League far too often.\nWe cannot afford to let people like Branthwaite go if at all possible. The defenders available are susceptible, to say the least, and this lad looks like someone who could step up and solidify that back line.\nHowever, what do we know? What goes on behind the scenes is open to speculation and in the end, it's the manager who makes the choice on matchday and if he says Branthwaite isn't worthy of selection ahead of what we have, then on his head be it.\nKeane and Tarkowski were his at Burnley and I suppose he will give them the nod for another season.\n97 Posted 02/07/2023 at 20:21:01\nI still remember the last time I saw him in a blue shirt - his wonderful performance against Brentford.\n98 Posted 02/07/2023 at 22:28:25\nHe has the potential to be top class but he can't afford to make mistakes.\nHe reminds me of John Terry, only a far nicer person which makes a lesser defender.\nWin at all costs, that's the mentality of world class players.\n99 Posted 02/07/2023 at 22:55:57\nJustin (98) - 㿼 millionâ€¦ and he reminds you of John Terry? I don't know which of those two statements I disagree with more, but it's close.\nGarner struggled at times in the game v Portugal today, and his heading seemed to find a Portuguese shirt every time, but he was very good in the second half, especially in the last fifteen minutes. He'll be starting again in the Semi-Final though, as Aarons is now suspended so Ben Johnson or Luke Thomas will probably be filling in at left-back.\n100 Posted 02/07/2023 at 23:58:17\nI don't know what game you watched but Branthwaite's heat map must have been doused with urine, never moved more than a couple of feet and when he did he lost possession, I timed his average on the ball as two seconds he never put any effort in.\nSince the first half of the first game in the Under-21s, Garner has played right-back and I think Branthwaite has played one game against Germany; both have looked very ordinary. Branthwaite looks like a basketball player who doesn't like football but had to fill in. Garner at stages in the Portugal game looked clueless.\nIf we have to rely on either of those two for most of the season, then God help us. I've seen some poor displays from players over the years but Garner and Branthwaite would be in the top ten.\nAndrew 99, Garner looked good in the last 15 mins because Portugal were shooting in and he couldn't hide; he's no full-back, Carsley must be playing him because of injuries.\n102 Posted 03/07/2023 at 00:43:58\nI think Carsley is playing Garner at right full-back because he doesn't want an attacking full-back; he seems to want to leave Madueke in space one v one against the opposition full-backs.\nAnd Garner is pretty good in terms of positional discipline and organisation, and when you have attacking options like Madueke, Gordon, Gibbs-White â€“ with progressive midfielders like Ramsey and Angel Gomes â€“ then you don't have to rely on your full-backs to demand the ball or take risks with it.\n103 Posted 03/07/2023 at 01:24:41\nâ€¦. or regret it later!\n104 Posted 03/07/2023 at 02:15:29\nI know there's gotta be something.\n105 Posted 03/07/2023 at 05:39:00\nThey are not ready made and haven't played a lot of first-team football. Yet we have judged them already?\nI'll wait and see on Branthwaite. He looks solid enough from the little I have seen of him.\nI keep saying, Garner is very comfortable on the football, he's not scared of it like some that we've been used to. He also likes to play forward if it's on.\nFinished article right now? Probably not. As a centre-back, you won't see Branthwaite mature until he is around 28. Garner as a midfielder around 25 or 26.\n106 Posted 03/07/2023 at 14:44:46\nWe haven't got the time to wait on either player for that long. We need established pros and right now. The worry is as the squad is so threadbare that we don't have the cash to buy anyone of sufficient skill to improve the team.\nOne thing I've noticed is more and more the amount of one-footed players in all positions is alarming, even the most simple of tasks they won't use the weaker foot and have the turning power of a bus.\nStrikers are missing easy chances because they are totally one-footed. Never bothered me when I played, I was two-footed, good on either side, never gave it a second thought.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
