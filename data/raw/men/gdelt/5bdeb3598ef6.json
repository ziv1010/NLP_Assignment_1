  "body_text": "Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya says the Gunners are well aware of Victor Gyokeres’ strengths ahead of the Champions League clash with Sporting on Tuesday night.\nGyokeres has been in stunning form for the Portuguese side ever since joining from Coventry City last year.\nThe Sweden international scored 43 goals in all competitions in his first season and has already netted 24 times in just 19 appearances so far this campaign for Sporting.\nHe scored a hat-trick in Sporting’s last Champions League outing as they beat Manchester City 4-1 and took his club form up to international level as he scored for Sweden in the 2-1 win over Slovakia and then four in the 6-0 thrashing of Azerbaijan.\nRaya knows Arsenal are facing one of the most dangerous forwards in world football at the moment, but says the Gunners have a plan for him and intend to end his run of goal-scoring form.\n‘We know his strengths, how he runs a lot in behind and scores a lot in one-v-one and he is a top player in form,’ Raya told a press conference on Monday.\n‘We are going to try and keep him very, very quiet. Don’t give him any chances. We have to step up defensively. Hopefully we can do a great job and keep a clean sheet.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta was asked about Gyokeres as well, but the Spaniard was keen to swerve the topic.\n‘I would like to talk about the team, about the coaches and how phenomenal they have been,’ he said. ‘The run they are in is incredible.\n‘That tells you that it is not only the quality, the setup, the ambition, it is something about the team energy that they have. That is a great challenge that we have tomorrow, to come here and make a statement and show we are capable against this kind of opponent. Be ourselves and win the game.’\nArteta was asked again about the Swede and said: ‘I understand the question, but they have a lot of individual qualities. That’s why they can win games in various ways. And yes, in the specific position they have great players.’\nSporting are now in the post-Ruben Amorim era after he left for Manchester United, with Joao Pereira replacing him.\nMore Trending\nThe new boss began his reign with a 6-0 thrashing of Amarante in the Taca de Portugal and feels there is little pressure on his side against Arsenal after beating Manchester City.\n‘It takes the pressure off us a bit, because we won, we got three more points, we go into this game with 10 points and, therefore, we have a margin,’ Pereira told a press conference.\n‘We will play our games and in the end we will do the maths.’\nMORE: Mikel Arteta confirms surprise Champions League return for forgotten Arsenal man\nMORE: Arsenal cult hero Nicklas Bendtner witnesses friend being stabbed in New York\nMORE: Arsenal and Man City sent clear transfer message as they target Ballon d’Or nominee",
