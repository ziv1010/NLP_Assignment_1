The rest doesn’t add any value to us and it can take our focus to the wrong place.”\nDespite Gabriel Jesus’ impressive two-goal haul in Arsenal’s 3-1 Champions League win against Inter Milan, Arteta could hand another chance to Viktor Gyokeres for the visit of United.\nGyokeres came off the bench in Italy to add Arsenal’s third goal but he has largely struggled in his debut campaign in north London.\nGyokeres scored 97 times in 102 matches for Sporting Lisbon prior to his switch to Arsenal but has netted just five times in the league.\nHowever, Arteta insisted: ‘Let’s assess him at the end of the season and even sometimes that is too short a sample.\n“We also need to understand the league that we are competing in and what is happening to the (number) nines across the league and the manner that the game is changing.\n“So, there are a lot of factors to bear in mind when we assess the player, and then we’re going to assess him, not only in one aspect of the game but in many aspects of the game.”\nOne player who will not be involved for Arsenal this weekend is Ethan Nwaneri after the 18-year-old completed his loan move to Marseille until the end of the season.\n“The talented young players that we have need minutes and Ethan wasn’t getting enough minutes,” said Arteta of the teenager, who has not started a league match this season.\n“The last thing we want to do is cut his development because he’s such a talent. He lives and breathes football. That’s his life. Marseille is going to be a great experience for him.”",
