The goalkeeper will be dressed in all-green.\n‘Inter, the official away side, will play in this season’s Third Kit. Simone Inzaghi’s boys will therefore wear the yellow kit with a design based on symbols referring to the city of Milan, all in black. This will be the kit for the ten outfield players: the Inter goalkeeper, however, will wear an all-orange kit.\n‘The tones that have represented the colour of the Clubs’ third kit for many years are very much back for the 2024/25 season. During this year’s Champions League, the Nerazzurri have worn this kit in their away game against Sparta Prague on Matchday 7 of the Legaue Phase (0-1, Lautaro) and in our win against Feyenoord in Rotterdam in the first leg of the Round of 16 (0-2, Thuram, Lautaro).\n‘Inter will wear yellow shorts and socks to match the shirt. The small new detail that will be added will be the special writing above the club’s logo, referring to the extraordinary occasion that the kit is being used for: FINAL MUNICH 2025 – Munich Football Arena 31 May – Paris Saint-Germain VS FC Internazionale Milano.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: PSG humiliate Inter Milan and win Champions League for first time ever\nMORE: PSG vs Inter Milan: Predicted lineups and teams for Champions League final\nMORE: Inter Milan in mourning hours before Champions League final as former president dies",
