At the other end of the table, at least seven clubs are at risk of being dragged into a relegation battle.\nWSL action for 2024 will conclude next weekend ahead of the winter break. It will then resume towards the end of January and clubs will hope to have a few new faces among their ranks.\nWith that being said, 90min have looked at six WSL stars who could look for playing time elsewhere next month, whether that be permanently or on loan…\n1. Chloe Kelly (Manchester City)\nIt’s no secret that Chloe Kelly’s future at Manchester City is up in the air as her contract ticks down into its final few months. She last signed an extension in 2022 and that deal will expire in the summer.\nWith no breakthrough seemingly imminent, the 26-year-old may consider her options in the transfer window. She will no doubt have an eye on next summer’s Euros and, having played such a significant role in England’s 2022 triumph, Kelly will be determined to keep herself in Sarina Wiegman’s thoughts ahead of the tournament.\nThe England boss has previously suggested the forward’s lack of playing time with her club is a concern, but her selection wasn't in doubt due to the credit she has in the bank. Injuries in forward positions will certainly have helped her case in the last two international camps, but that could change by the summer as players return to full fitness.\nIt remains to be seen whether Kelly’s intention is to remain at the Joie Stadium beyond this season, but if a free transfer is the plan in six months’ time, it will be no surprise to see movement in January.\n2. Kathrine Kuhl (Arsenal)\nAnother player struggling for game time at their club is Denmark international Kathrine Kuhl. The 21-year-old signed for the Gunners in January 2023 from Danish club Nordsjaelland, but things haven’t quite worked out for the midfielder.\nShe spent the second half of last season on loan with WSL rivals Everton and the opportunity to reunite with her former manager, Brian Sorensen, was a huge benefit of the move. Despite staying at Arsenal in the summer, minutes have been extremely hard to come by for Kuhl this season as she made her first league appearance in a seven minute cameo against Aston Villa over the weekend.\nArsenal’s depth in midfield and the minimal minutes this term may prompt the youngster to seek another loan move away, especially with the Euros a matter of months away.\n3. Freya Godfrey (Arsenal)\nAnother Arsenal player that could be on the move is 19-year-old Freya Godfrey. The attacker had a previous spell in the Championship with Charlton Athletic, but remained with the Gunners for the first half of the 2024/25 season.\nA report from BBC journalist Emma Sanders back in August suggests Arsenal were open to a loan move for Godfrey to further her development, but nothing materialised before the window slammed shut in September. Given she hasn’t accumulated many minutes so far this term, loan options could be revisited in January.\n4. Codie Thomas (Manchester City)\nElsewhere, Manchester City’s Codie Thomas is another promising young star making her way through the ranks. She penned her first official contract with the club earlier this month having made her senior debut in the Champions League against St. Polten back in October.\nThe next step in the 18-year-old’s development could be a loan move to a WSL or Championship club in order to accumulate more regular playing time, as opposed to the odd cameo here and there.\n5. Alejandra Bernabe (Chelsea)\n23-year-old left back Alejandra Bernabe joined Chelsea in the summer of 2023 and spent last season on loan in Liga F with Real Sociedad. Her game time this season has largely been with the academy and she is often an unused substitute with the first team.\nDespite injuries in the backline, Sonia Bompastor still has the likes of Ashley Lawrence, Niamh Charles and Oriane Jean-Francois as options at left back. Charles’ recent return from injury will likely only restrict Bernabe’s chances even further.\nA loan, whether in England or abroad, could be on the cards in January as Bernabe is a player with plenty of promise, but she currently isn’t getting the minutes needed to further her development.\n6. Jess Simpson (Manchester United)\nSticking with left backs, Manchester United’s Jess Simpson has returned this season following a long ACL injury lay-off. She has accumulated some minutes under Marc Skinner this term, predominantly in the League Cup, but United are well stocked in her position.\nGabby George is first choice, while they also signed 21-year-old Anna Sandberg from BK Hacken in the summer. Leah Galton has featured at left back too, which only solidifies Simpson’s low place in the pecking order.\nNot heading out on loan in the summer made sense as the 19-year-old completed her ACL recovery and regained fitness under the guidance of United staff. However, a January loan move could be perfect for both parties, especially if it can produce similar results to Grace Clinton’s spells at Bristol City and Tottenham.",
