  "body_text": "Tottenham captain Cristian Romero suffered an injury scare ahead of the Premier League clash against Leeds United, but Thomas Frank has given a positive update on the matter.\nSpurs travel to Elland Road on Saturday in the early kick-off looking to get back to winning ways before the October international break.\nWhile they have enjoyed a great start to life under Frank, losing just one of their opening 10 games of the season inside 90 minutes, they have drawn three of their last four matches.\nMoreover, they needed late equalisers in both the 1-1 draw with bottom of the table Wolves and the 2-2 meeting at Bodo/Glimt, matches they were expected to win.\nRomero missed the Champions League trip last Tuesday, with the centre-back not even travelling to Norway or taking part in first-team training as a precaution after hurting his foot.\nFans were unsurprisingly worried about the skipper’s fitness, with his defensive partnership with Micky van de Ven crucial to Tottenham’s success.\nBut Frank has confirmed that the Argentina international is ready for Leeds, saying in his pre-match press conference: ‘Romero is fit and available and he will start tomorrow.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘That’s positive. It was contact to the foot. The medical staff did well with the turnaround.’\nFrank has a number of injury concerns but revealed more good news in regard to strikers Dominic Solanke and Randal Kolo Muani, though both will not be at Elland Road.\n‘Dom the minor procedure went well and Kolo Muani has been on the pitch the past two days so that’s a positive,’ the Danish manager added.\n‘He will not be available. He is not in the squad.\n‘Kota [Takai] is better and better. He has trained fully with the team for a week to 10 days.’\nRomero was named Tottenham captain following the departure of Son Heung-min over the summer, with the club announcing on Friday that Ben Davies, James Maddison, Guglielmo Vicario and Van de Ven were joining him in the leadership group.\nMany were surprised to see Maddison included given his long-term injury and the omission of both Pedro Porro and Rodrigo Bentancur, the latter recently signing a new long-term contract.\nExplaining the decision, Frank said: ‘I think it’s down to a few bits. First and foremost, there is quite a few with a leadership potential in them.\nMore Trending\n‘The more we can have that want to speak up and take responsibility for the bigger picture, the better. That’s what creates the best teams.\n‘And I agree with Rodri Bentancur and Pedro especially, the two of them. They’re two I want them to take a lot of responsibility and I think they do very well.\n‘But I also think this group also covers the squad to make sure we get around to everyone. Make sure all the groups, even though we’re one big group, are touched and in sync. So lots of factors into that.’\nSpurs are currently fourth in the table and victory at Leeds will see them jump up to second, where they’ll stay providing Arsenal and Crystal Palace don’t beat West Ham and Everton later in the weekend.\nMORE: Chelsea handed Joao Pedro injury boost ahead of Liverpool clash\nMORE: Mikel Arteta provides Gabriel Magalhaes injury update ahead of Arsenal vs West Ham\nMORE: Chelsea star ‘not physically prepared’ to replace Cole Palmer, suggests Enzo Maresca",
