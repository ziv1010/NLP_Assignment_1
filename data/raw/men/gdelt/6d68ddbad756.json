  "body_text": "Manchester United\nPremier League • England\nRanking all 33 midfielders Man Utd have been linked with as Prem star climbs shortlist but Real Madrid raids dismissed\nManchester United will be in the market for new central midfielders in 2026 and they have been linked with a lot of potential transfer targets in recent months.\nCasemiro is out of contract at the end of the season, Kobbie Mainoo is looking to leave in search of regular first-team football and Bruno Fernandes also faces an uncertain future.\nHere, TEAMtalk guides you through every midfielder to have been linked with United since the last transfer window closed. We tell you their ages, current clubs and contract situations.\nWe’ve then ranked them by how likely a potential move to Old Trafford is. Note: We’ve only included central midfielders and players who are at least 18 years old.\n33. Jude Bellingham\n- Current club: Real Madrid\n- Age: 22\n- Contract expires: 2029\nUnited hold a long-standing interest in Bellingham, having initially tried to sign the midfielder from Birmingham City in the summer of 2020.\nReports in Spain claim that United are preparing a €150million (£131.7m, $176m) offer for the 22-year-old but it’s from an unreliable outlet, so such a big claim has to be taken with a pinch of salt.\n32. Aurelien Tchouameni\n- Current club: Real Madrid\n- Age: 25\n- Contract expires: 2028\nAnother Spanish outlet claims that United have offered €90million (£78.8m, $105.8m) for Tchouameni, but a move is unlikely as Madrid view the France international as an ‘irreplaceable pillar’ of their squad.\n31. Aleksandar Pavlovic\n- Current club: Bayern Munich\n- Age: 21\n- Contract expires: 2029\nOnline reports in England claim that United have added Pavlovic to their list of targets, although Fabrizio Romano insists that Bayern Munich will not let the 21-year-old leave.\n30. Andrey Santos\n- Current club: Chelsea\n- Age: 21\n- Contract expires:2030\nUnited have been credited with an interest in Santos but Chelsea have no plans to sell the Brazil international, especially to a direct Premier League rival.\n29. Eduardo Camavinga\n- Current club: Real Madrid\n- Age: 23\n- Contract expires: 2029\nUnited are reportedly willing to spend €80million (£70m / $93m) to bring Camavinga to Old Trafford but Madrid view the 22-year-old as a key figure in their long-term plans.\n28. Breno Bidon\n- Current club: Corinthians\n- Age: 20\n- Contract expires: 2029\nReports in Brazil claim that United have been keeping tabs on Bidon but are yet to follow up their interest with a concrete offer, and he now looks set to join Atletico Madrid.\n27. Federico Valverde\n- Current club: Real Madrid\n- Age: 27\n- Contract expires: 2029\nThe fourth Real Madrid midfielder on this list, Valverde is reportedly unhappy with Xabi Alonso’s management style and United are keeping close tabs on the situation.\nBut Alonso is currently under a lot of pressure, and a managerial change at the Bernabeu would dent United’s hopes of signing the Uruguay international.\n26. Scott McTominay\n- Current club: Napoli\n- Age: 29\n- Contract expires: 2028\nSources revealed that United have sounded out McTominay’s camp about a potential return, but the Scotland international has become an idolised figure at Napoli and isn’t looking for a move.\n25. James Garner\n- Current club: Everton\n- Age: 24\n- Contract expires: 2026\nAnother United academy graduate, Garner had also been linked with a return to Old Trafford but Everton are reportedly confident that the 24-year-old will sign a new contract.\n24. Joao Gomes\n- Current club: Wolves\n- Age: 24\n- Contract expires: 2030\nUnited were reportedly considering a January move for Gomes, but David Ornstein has since revealed there is no truth in reports that they are pursuing the 24-year-old.\n23. Victor Froholdt\n- Current club: Porto\n- Age: 19\n- Contract expires: 2030\nFroholdt is enjoying an impressive debut season at Porto and has attracted interest from United and a number of other sides, but they will not sell the 19-year-old unless his €85million (£75m, $100m) release clause is met.\n22. Yehor Yarmolyuk\n- Current club: Brentford\n- Age: 21\n- Contract expires: 2031\nUnited have reportedly been scouting Yarmolyuk but the midfielder is under contract at Brentford until the end of the 2030/31 season, which puts them in a strong negotiating position.\n21. Jobe Bellingham\n- Current club: Borussia Dortmund\n- Age: 20\n- Contract expires: 2030\nAlongside Jude Bellingham, United have also been credited with an interest in his younger brother.\nThe 20-year-old has struggled to find his best form since joining Dortmund in the summer, but reportedly wants to stay and fight for his place in the team.\n20. Manu Kone\n- Current club: Roma\n- Age: 24\n- Contract expires:2029\nOnline reports in England claim that United are keeping close tabs on Kone, although Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain are considered to be the frontrunners to sign the France international.\n19. Assan Ouedraogo\n- Current club: RB Leipzig\n- Age: 19\n- Contract expires: 2029\nReports in Germany claim that United have been scouting Ouedraogo and their recruitment chiefs have been deeply impressed by the 19-year-old, but they face strong competition from Chelsea.\n18. Ederson\n- Current club: Atalanta\n- Age: 26\n- Contract expires: 2027\nUnited enquired about signing Ederson in the summer of 2024 as an alternative to Manuel Ugarte, before that deal was eventually struck with PSG.\nThey are reportedly planning to rekindle their interest in the Brazil international after his agent revealed that his price tag could drop to €30-40million (£26-35m) in January.\n17. Kees Smit\n- Current club: AZ Alkmaar\n- Age: 19\n- Contract expires: 2028\nUnited scouts have been following Smit at AZ Alkmaar and director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, has reportedly mentioned his name in internal talks.\nThe 19-year-old is valued at around £25million, a fee which would be a club-record sale for the Eredivisie side.\n16. Javi Guerra\n- Current club: Valencia\n- Age: 22\n- Contract expires: 2029\nGuerra was heavily linked with a move to United during the summer transfer window but ultimately put pen to paper on a new contract at Valencia.\nReports in Spain claim that United have reignited their interest in the 22-year-old, who could now be sold for a cut-price fee of €25million (£21.9m, $29.4m).\n15. Ayyoub Bouaddi\n- Current club: Lille\n- Age: 18\n- Contract expires: 2029\nBouaddi has emerged as one of Europe’s most sought-after talents, with United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus all chasing his signature.\nDespite signing a new contract with Lille in recent weeks, the 18-year-old midfielder still looks set for a move at the end of the season.\n“I have extended until 2029 and next year is still far away,” he said. “I am focused on this season and we have things to fight for. As I also said to the president, at the end of the season, there will be a choice to be made, and anything can happen. We don’t know what will happen.”\n14. Christ Inao Oulai\n- Current club: Trabzonspor\n- Age: 19\n- Contract expires: 2030\nOulai is enjoying an impressive debut season at Trabzonspor and sources indicate United have renewed contacts with his representatives but Manchester City are currently the frontrunners in the race for his signature.\n13. Alex Scott\n- Current club: Bournemouth\n- Age: 22\n- Contract expires:2028\nFollowing his impressive performances at Bournemouth, Scott recently earned his first call-up to the England senior team and tabloid reports claim that United are now monitoring the 22-year-old.\n12. Hayden Hackney\n- Current club: Middlesbrough\n- Age: 23\n- Contract expires: 2027\nHackney is one of the best midfielders in the Championship and sources understand United have kept a close eye on his progress and could be tempted to firm up their interest in 2026.\n11. Carlos Baleba\n- Current club: Brighton\n- Age: 21\n- Contract expires: 2028\nUnited explored a potential deal for Baleba last summer and agreed personal terms but were ultimately priced out of a move, with Brighton demanding over £100million.\nHe has since struggled to produce his best form for Brighton this season and United have cooled their interest in the Cameroon international.\n10. Mamadou Sangare\n- Current club: Lens\n- Age: 23\n- Contract expires: 2030\nSangare has helped Lens take top spot in Ligue 1 and sources have told us that United have been tracking the 23-year-old, who is viewed as a potentially good-value option in the market.\n9. Ruben Neves\n- Current club: Al Hilal\n- Age: 28\n- Contract expires: 2026\nNeves is about to enter the final six months of his contract at Al Hilal and online reports in England claim that Amorim wants to bring his compatriot to United.\nThe 28-year-old, who starred for Wolves in the Premier League before his move to the Saudi Pro League in 2023, could be available in January for around €20million (£17.6m, $23m).\n8. Noah Sadiki\n- Current club: Sunderland\n- Age: 20\n- Contract expires: 2030\nUnited held talks with Sadiki’s representatives before his summer move to Sunderland and retain an interest in the midfielder following his impressive start to life in the Premier League.\nWe understand Sunderland have no intention of allowing the DR Congo international to leave, although a £50million bid might be hard for them to turn down.\n7. Tyler Adams\n- Current club: Bournemouth\n- Age: 26\n- Contract expires: 2028\nAlongside Alex Scott, United have also been linked with his midfield partner at Bournemouth.\nA tabloid report claims that United have internally discussed the possibility of signing Adams next year, and the USMNT international is valued at around £40million.\n6. Morten Hjulmand\n- Current club: Sporting CP\n- Age: 26\n- Contract expires: 2028\nHaving played under Amorim at Sporting, Hjulmand is emerging as a prime target for United and we understand that a deal could be done for around £50million, despite his £70million release clause.\n5. Adam Wharton\n- Current club: Crystal Palace\n- Age: 21\n- Contract expires: 2029\nWharton has gone from strength to strength at Crystal Palace, and sources revealed that the England international is “loved” by Amorim’s staff, who see him as a perfect fit for their 3-4-2-1 system.\nBut a move for the 21-year-old may depend on whether United perform well this season and qualify for the Champions League.\n“We spoke about shooting for the stars,” his agent said recently. “Let’s play for England. How do you get there? Personally I think to play for England you have to play Champions League, and to play Champions League you have to play in one of the top teams in one of the top leagues.”\n4. Christos Mouzakitis\n- Current club: Olympiacos\n- Age: 18\n- Contract expires: 2029\nMouzakitis is widely regarded as one of the best young midfielders in the world and sources have told us that United have stepped up their interest in the 18-year-old.\nA departure in the summer of 2026 is now considered the most likely outcome, although United will face competition from clubs across the Premier League, Bundesliga, and Serie A.\n3. Angelo Stiller\n- Current club: Stuttgart\n- Age: 24\n- Contract expires: 2028\nA number of reliable sources have confirmed United’s interest in Stiller, with both Christopher Vivell and Jason Wilcox said to be big admirers of the Germany international.\nHe is reportedly open to a move next summer and Stuttgart value the 24-year-old in the region of €50million (£43.9m, $58.9m).\n2. Conor Gallagher\n- Current club: Atletico Madrid\n- Age: 25\n- Contract expires: 2029\nUnited made a deadline day loan approach for Gallagher in the summer window, although a move failed to materialise as Atletico were only prepared to sanction a permanent sale.\nHe’s since played a bit-part role under Diego Simeone this season and we understand that United remain firmly in the hunt for the England international.\n1. Elliot Anderson\n- Current club: Nottingham Forest\n- Age: 23\n- Contract expires: 2029\nAnderson has been one of the standout midfielders in the Premier League this season and United have now made the England international their No. 1 midfield target.\nREAD MORE: Who will leave Man Utd first: Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo or Manuel Ugarte?",
