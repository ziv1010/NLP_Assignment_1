  "body_text": "Q&A: What would Pep Guardiola’s contract extension mean for Manchester City?\nPep Guardiola is reportedly set to extend his contract at Manchester City by at least a further year until 2026.\nHere, the PA news agency looks at what the news means for the club.\nHow much of a lift does this give City?\nIf confirmed, this is a major boost for the club in both the short and medium term. Guardiola’s existing deal is due to expire next summer and speculation over his position has been rife for months.\nThis puts an end to that – at least for the time being – and allows to club to plan for the 2025-26 season and potentially beyond with greater certainty.\nWhat are the short-term benefits?\nDespite sitting second in the Premier League and being expected to progress in the Champions League, City have been below par this term and their recent results have been poor.\nTheir run of four successive defeats prior to this month’s international break was the worst of Guardiola’s managerial career.\nWhile injuries have been a factor, the lack of clarity over the manager’s future may have impacted on the players. This removes that ambiguity and allows for greater focus on the job at hand this season.\nWhat about beyond that?\nChanging manager in the summer of 2025 would have been complicated for City. There is already one transition occurring as director of football Txiki Begiristain is replaced by Hugo Viana.\nThis would have added to the disruption at a time when City have little respite from football as they are also due to compete in the Club World Cup.\nWhile there will never be an ideal time to replace one of the greatest managers in Premier League history, this at least kicks the can down the road to a quieter summer.\nWhat is the impact on squad rebuilding?\nEven though Guardiola’s new deal could give the squad an immediate shot in the arm, there have been signs that some player turnover will be required to enable the team to continue competing.\nNews Guardiola is staying would undoubtedly strengthen the club’s hand in negotiations and ease Viana’s arrival. City rarely dip into the January market but Rodri’s long-term injury and recent form could force a move.\nBeyond the winter, the likes of Kyle Walker, Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan – all 33 or over – will need replacing sooner rather than later.\nDoes this help the club in their legal battles?\nNot directly but it brings rock-solid stability to one area of the club while another focuses considerable attention elsewhere.\nCity are currently fighting 115 charges of alleged breaches of Premier League regulations following an investigation into their financial affairs. Punishment could be severe if City, who deny all wrongdoing, are found guilty – with relegation a possibility.\nLittle is known about how the process will unfold and what the impact of it will be, but Guardiola has strongly defended the club in the past and his loyalty is now beyond question. Some reports have suggested there will be no relegation break clause in the Spaniard’s contract.",
