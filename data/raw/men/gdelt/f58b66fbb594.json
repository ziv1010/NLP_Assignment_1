Three of his six starts after Christmas came against lower-league opposition in the FA Cup, while 16 starts in total is his fewest in a campaign since he was 20 years old.\nUnsurprisingly, it has also been his least productive season in terms of chances created and dribbling success since returning to the Premier League in 2019.\nCity's team structure has seldom afforded Grealish the license to take on and glide past opponents as he did with such insouciance as the talismanic captain at boyhood club Aston Villa.\nThe question now is whether the affable 29-year-old can reverse the downward trajectory of his career.\nCan Grealish become main man again?\nGrealish has grown more accustomed to sitting on the bench than playing football in recent times so his first task will be to get himself physically and mentally ready to play many more minutes of football than he has for the past two seasons.\nEverton were rejuvenated following the appointment of Moyes in January, climbing up the table to finish 13th, but have struggled to build on that momentum with significant recruitment this summer.\nGrealish will be a marquee signing as the club count down to their first season at their magnificent new Hill Dickinson Stadium.\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel has shown with his selections of players such as Marcus Rashford and Kyle Walker that he is not afraid to pick those that are out of favour at their clubs.\nThat will provide Grealish with hope that the England door has not been fully closed in a World Cup year.\nRecapturing his form could well take him across the Atlantic next summer - but if that proves elusive it will likely bring about more disappointment for him when an England tournament squad is announced.\nThe ball, therefore, will firmly be in Grealish's court at Everton.\nThe highs...\nGrealish said it was a \"dream come true\" when he became Britain's first £100m player by joining City from Aston Villa in August 2021.\nHe had been the undoubted star at Villa, coming through the academy to become a free-spirited maverick that helped the team to promotion from the Championship and re-established them in the Premier League.\nIn his first season at City, Grealish played 26 top-flight games, scoring three goals and providing three assists as they edged out Liverpool by a solitary point to claim the title again.\nBut the following season is when he really hit his stride, playing an integral role as City finally lifted the holy grail of the Champions League, as well as their third league title on the bounce and the FA Cup.\nGrealish played 50 matches in all competitions, netting five times and providing 11 assists - his importance to the side highlighted by the fact he started all seven of their knockout ties in Europe.\n\"The main thing now is I feel loved,\" Grealish said during that season. \"I feel the manager really trusts me.\"\nHe was the face of City's celebrations following their return home from Istanbul with the European trophy and it was anticipated he would kick on again, but his career has since taken an unexpected downward trajectory.\nThe lows...\nGrealish knuckled down after he and team-mate Phil Foden were warned about their conduct by Guardiola having been pictured on a night out in December 2021.\nHe had a hamstring injury in the 2023-24 campaign and made just 10 starts in all, often overlooked for the quicker and more direct Jeremy Doku when he did regain full fitness.\nHe ended that season with more yellow cards (seven) than combined goals and assists (six) and featured in just 40% of the total minutes played by City.\nGrealish has won 39 England caps but was left out of the Three Lions' squad for the 2024 European Championship, where they were edged out in the final by Spain.\nSeveral people close to the player had told BBC Sport its impact on him should not be underestimated and it had made a \"real difference to his confidence\".\nThat appeared to be the case, because it did not get any better last term.\nThere was a further warning from Guardiola, who said in January: \"Do I want the Jack that won the Treble? Yeah I want it, but I try to be honest with myself for that. They have to fight.\"\nIn fact, his involvement with the side for last season dropped to 30%, while 16 starts in total is his fewest in a campaign since he was 20 years old - and as a result, unsurprisingly it was his least productive season since 2019.\nFormer England winger Theo Walcott has suggested Grealish's \"incredible talent\" had been \"coached out of him\", but others close to the player disagreed that the manager had in some way drilled the creativity out of him.\nGrealish's days were clearly numbered when he was excluded from City's final game of the season at Fulham, despite Guardiola giving an impassioned defence afterwards by saying his large squad means he has to leave out \"five or six players\" and that it was \"nothing personal with Jack\".\nBut he was also dropped from City's squad for the Club World Cup in the United States in the summer, instead working individually at the training ground in Manchester.\nDuring an open training session on 5 August, Grealish was fully engaged in the tactical sequences and did not give off any vibes of a player that wanted to leave.\nThere has been no public falling out between Grealish and Guardiola, but after the disappointments of the last two seasons, the chance to drag his career back on track with the Toffees is surely one he will relish.",
