A regular under Hansi Flick, Rashford has registered an impressive five goals and six assists in 12 appearances across all competitions.\nThe England international scored a sensational brace earlier this week to help the Blaugrana to a dominant 6-1 Champions League victory over Olympiacos.\nThere have been suggestions that Barcelona have already decided they want to retain Rashford permanently, but a recent report covered by The Peoples Person claimed that the club are intent on biding their time and assessing the situation at the end of the campaign.\nIt’s believed that they are happy with Rashford’s impact and his progress at Camp Nou.\nIn a candid chat with ESPN, Rashford admitted he had sought a move to Barcelona before this year, though the transfer collapsed. He also opened up on the reasons behind his eventual departure from United after several years with the club.\nRashford’s revelation\nThe Carrington academy graduate told ESPN, “I just believe that things happen when they’re supposed to happen.”\n“It’s not the first time I spoke with Barcelona about potentially coming here, but for whatever reasons it didn’t happen in the past and now is my opportunity to make it happen.”\n“I feel like there’s no time like the present now. So I just take things day to day.”\nHe added, “The key thing for me is just to continue to improve because when you retire, you’re going to miss everything. The good stuff, the bad stuff…you’re going to miss it about the sport. Every day I just take it day by day and just try to improve from the day before.\nAsked if he wants to stay at Barcelona, Rashford answered, “Oh yeah, for sure.”\n“I’m enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game. For a player, it’s an honour.”\nHe explained about his eventual Old Trafford exit, “It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United.”\n“So sometimes you just need a change. I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I’m enjoying everything.”\nRashford will be looking to extend his fine form when Barcelona face Real Madrid on Sunday at the Santiago Bernabeu.\nFeatured image Alex Caparros via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
