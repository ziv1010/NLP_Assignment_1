It's been quite easy to implement my ideas, and they've worked very hard in perfecting them throughout the games.\"\nIn the other semi-final, featuring western sides from the AFC, Al-Hilal's record-breaking run of 34 consecutive wins was ended later on Wednesday as the Saudi Pro League leaders were beaten 4-2 by UAE hosts Al-Ain, for whom Soufiane Rahimi scored a first-half hat-trick.\nAustralian Associated Press",
