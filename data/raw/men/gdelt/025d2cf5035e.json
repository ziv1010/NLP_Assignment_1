  "body_text": "Newcastle United are more than happy with the work Eddie Howe is doing.\nThat’s according to leading football journalist and CaughtOffside columnist Fabrizio Romano, who has cooled speculation Howe, 46, could leave his position following the side’s group-stage exit from the Champions League.\nFinishing bottom of Group F’s ‘group of death’ also featuring AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund and PSG, the Magpies, despite thumping the latter 4-1 at home, collected just five points from six games.\nAnd following the team’s disappointing European campaign, recent reports, including one from Football Insider, suggested the club’s wealthy Saudi owners are considering parting ways with Howe.\nHowever, weighing in on these rumours, Romano has explained how there are currently no plans behind the scenes to remove the former Bournemouth boss from the St. James’ Park hot seat.\n“I am not aware of any plans to part ways with Howe,” he wrote in his exclusive SubStack column.\n“I can say for sure the club are very happy with their manager. Everybody is pulling in the same direction and working toward the same goal.\n“I have not heard any suggestions that Howe will be told to leave Newcastle United.”\nSince taking charge of the Magpies, Howe has registered a 1.71 points-per-game Premier League average (TM).\nNext up for the Magpies following Saturday’s impressive 3-0 victory over Fulham is a Carabao Cup quarter-final tie against Chelsea on Wednesday.",
