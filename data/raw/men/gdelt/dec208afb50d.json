  "body_text": "December 24, 2023\nWith Liverpool maintaining an impressive record at their Anfield fortress, history shows that Real Madrid have rather been \"unfazed\" by the Reds' dominance in their home ground.\nAnfield, considered by many as one of the greatest stadiums in the world, has been Liverpool's fortress over the years with the home side taking advantage of the venue's intimidating atmosphere to triumph over some of the top teams, including FC Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and others.\nIn 2023, Jurgen Klopp's men have maintained an impressive tally at Anfield by remaining unbeaten in 25 out of the 26 matches they have played there — including 19 victories and six draws.\nTeams like Manchester United, Manchester City, and Arsenal played at Anfield twice in the year and failed to beat the Merseyside club. Among all, there is one surprising name that played at the Reds’ home only once and managed to beat the mighty Liverpool.\nLiverpool met Real Madrid in the Round of 16 stage of the UEFA Champions League 2022-23 and they were hammered by Los Blancos in all aspects of the game.\nMadrid, coached by Carlo Ancelotti, handed Liverpool their biggest defeat in the Champions League era, as they battered the Reds 5-2 courtesy of an all-round display by the Whites.\nEven though Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah gave a bright start to the home side by finding Thibaut Courtois’ net in the 4th and 14th minute respectively, they couldn’t carry the momentum and soon found themselves trailing as soon as Vinicius Junior started the comeback in the 21st minute and eventually levelled the game in 36th minute.\nA goal from Eder Militao and a brace from Karim Benzema cemented Los Blancos’ name in history as they netted five past Alisson Becker, becoming the only visiting side to score five at Anfield.\nMadrid have played at Anfield for a total of four times, and their only loss came in 2008 when they were beaten 4-0.\nIn 2014, the two sides faced one another in a group stage match in UCL and Ancelotti, who was Madrid's coach at that time as well, led them to a 3-0 win.\nAjax defeated Liverpool 5-1 in 1966 in Amsterdam but that counts in the European Cup era as the format was changed in 1992-93, so was the name.\nIt is worth noting that one of Liverpool’s most memorable comebacks in the Champions League history came against FC Barcelona in the semi-final of the 2018/19 season.\nBarca headed to Anfield with a three-goal lead but crumbled unbelievably as they conceded four and were out of the tournament. Liverpool went on to beat Tottenham Hotspur in the final and became the champions.",
