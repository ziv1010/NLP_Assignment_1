A season that had once been dragged into a dark place of relegation fears and turmoil has begun to look up. The Championship play-offs are not the fanciful aim they were at the arrival of winter.\n“If you can’t dream about getting somewhere, you’ll never get there,” says Liam Rosenior, the head coach who has driven the turnaround. “The players thought I was crazy when I told them in Turkey (during a mid-season break in November) that the top six was possible but it’s there for us.”\nAdvertisement\nRosenior makes no apologies for his ambition nor the enjoyment at being back at the club where he spent five years as a player. Derby County might have offered him a fraught introduction to front-line management in League One at the start of the season but this is where a career planned for a lifetime has really begun.\n“I’m loving it, this is my passion,” says the 38-year-old. “It’s something I’ve always dreamt of doing from when I was a kid. And it’s living up to it.”\nBack-to-back home wins against Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff City ensure there is a buoyant mood mirroring the head coach’s enthusiasm. Hull have popped their head into the Championship’s top half after a run of one defeat in nine games and travel to Stoke City on Saturday knowing they are in the bun fight for those four play-off places.\nOthers, like the upwardly mobile West Bromwich Albion and Middlesbrough, will be more fancied but a club that Rosenior helped reach an FA Cup final and the Europa League are being encouraged to think big again under Turkish owner Acun Ilicali.\n“The biggest thing we’ve had to change in a short space of time is the culture,” he says. “When there’s no investment, you can get to a point where the club doesn’t feel important.\n“Attendances were low, mediocrity was being accepted. We’ve all got to change that. I was fortunate to see what the club meant to the city and the people when it was a success. There’s no reason why it can’t happen again. I’m sure it will happen again.”\nRosenior has gathered his players in a darkened upstairs room before training can begin and granted The Athletic access. A short debrief of the weekend’s 1-0 win over Cardiff follows, with clips played out on a projector in front of the squad and support staff.\nThe theme is “having your mate’s back, mistakes happen in games,” he says. “It’s about reactions. It has to mean more to us.”\nAdvertisement\nThe replays of Saturday roll, Rosenior pointing out the extra yards run and the covering tackles made. “Look at this, last minute,” he says. “Cross comes in, we’ve made a mistake but Matty Ingram (Hull City’s goalkeeper) is there, ready to get his head kicked off for his mate. I fucking love it. These are the moments that get us to where we want to be.”\nThe meeting ends how it began. The opening slide had been the Championship table dating from the World Cup break. Hull are sixth in the customised rankings, losing only one of nine games. Rosenior reminds them of what he had predicted during a warm-weather training camp.\n“We are four points from the play-offs,” he says. “I told you, didn’t I? I’m not Nostradamus but I know how good you can be. We need a mentality as a group that we can do something special.”\nRosenior had planned the presentation and the sessions that followed during the morning commute with his closest coaching staff. The one-hour-and-twenty-minute drive from the family home near Derby is made with assistant Justin Walker and coaching analyst Ben Warner. The driving duties are shared, allowing the passengers to work away on laptops.\nRosenior, Walker and Warner first worked together at Derby County, witnessing first-hand the slide into administration and the inevitable relegation to League One last season.\nThe summer exit of Wayne Rooney, the manager they worked below, presented Rosenior with the chance to begin Derby’s rebuild under new owner and local businessman David Clowes. An interim role saw Rosenior wrestle with a chaotic pre-season before being relieved of his duties after nine games. The experience of Paul Warne, a promotion specialist in League One, was preferred.\n“My kids saw me in a different light then,” he explains. “They saw how devastated I was to lose my job and were devastated too. I told them something good would happen so it’s been a great lesson for them. They see how happy I am now.”\nAdvertisement\nThere is still pride taken in what was achieved in a short space of time at Derby and the bonds that remain. Rosenior counts Rooney, now in charge of MLS side DC United, as a friend for life.\n“He was a fantastic leader,” says Rosenior. “We still speak at least once a week. We had great trust between us. We’re ambitious people, very different, but as soon as Wayne got the job he knew I had his back.\n“I took a lot of lessons from Wayne. You learn how important trust is during times of adversity. You need transparent relationships.\n“I know where I’m going in my career and I showed I’m a good manager at Derby. I put together a squad that is flying with no recruitment team. I knew this time would come (with Derby fourth in League One). I thought it would be with me but it wasn’t. I’m proud of what I’m seeing at Derby and really hope they get promoted.”\nIt is another possible promotion that is on his mind.\nTuesday has been ringfenced as a physical day for Hull’s players before the tactical preparation begins for the Stoke match. The squad is split into three for a carousel programme, with each alternating from small-sided games to fitness work. A 10 v 10 game, deliberately played in a shortened and congested pitch, concludes the day’s work. Rosenior talks relentlessly of structure, pressing and discipline.\nThere are eyes in the sky, too. A recent addition, demanded by Rosenior and his assistant Walker, is a drone that flies 30 metres above. Analyst Josh Marris is responsible for keeping it in the air and capturing footage, tracking the positional play of everyone below.\nBroken lines have been painted the length of the pitch, splitting the area into thirds. Rosenior asks for at least five of his players to be in the same channel as the ball when in possession.\nThe improvements have been clear since the reign of Shota Arveladze ended in calamitous style. A squad transformed in the summer floundered through autumn. Arveladze, who won only nine of 30 games during a first taste of English football, remains Ilicali’s greatest mistake as owner.\nAdvertisement\nRosenior needed convincing that this was a job for him after initial advances to the experienced Portuguese coach Pedro Martins came to nothing. Other Championship clubs were spoken to and after the disappointment of Derby it was not a decision taken lightly. A new challenge, though, could not be resisted. Rosenior, who watched his father Leroy manage Gloucester City, Brentford and Torquay United, has always seen management as his calling.\n“When you grow up your biggest role models are your parents,” explains Rosenior, who qualified for his UEFA Pro Licence aged 32, when still a player with Brighton & Hove Albion. “I was no different. My dad was a manager when I was eight and I would talk to him about tactics. I’d sit in the dugout with him and be in every team talk. I’d hear all the swear words. It’s in my blood and something that’s natural.”\nRosenior is adamant his father deserved more as a manager. “My dad was treated badly, didn’t get the opportunities he should’ve done,” he says.\n“We can speak about BAME managers and coaches. Is it in my mind? It is. I’d be a liar if I said it wasn’t. It’s something that I want to change, the perception of BAME managers.”\nThe subject matters to Rosenior. “Racism is a very difficult thing to speak about,” he says. “Sometimes it’s not racism, it’s a pre-judgment of someone. It’s in our nature to judge people when they walk in a room, whether they’re a woman, they’re gay, their religion, whatever it might be. It’s the same with the colour of someone’s skin.\n“Breaking down that preconceived idea of what someone is capable of is important to me. I don’t think that’s always racism. It’s human nature, the subconscious. You hear people might have made a racist remark and then say they’re not racist because they’ve got black friends.\n“That’s not the point. Your thought was racist. It doesn’t make you a terrible person. If you’re subconsciously judging someone, where you don’t know it yourself, that’s ignorance or your education. That’s where the lines get crossed in terms of racism.\nAdvertisement\n“I can remember speaking to a black player who’s played for England, played in the Champions League, I’ll not name him because it’s not fair, and he asked me what I wanted to do when I’d finished. I told him I wanted to be a manager and he told me I had no chance. That’s the mentality because of how things have been. The only way you can change that is to knock those doors down.”\nThere is a lovely symmetry that has brought Rosenior back to Hull. Childhood summers would be spent in the city visiting his grandmother, Cath, who had moved north from London to work as a social worker in the 1980s. Hull had become her adopted club. A season ticket was held before Rosenior had even joined the club as an out-of-contract full-back in 2010.\n“I signed for the club on a free transfer but didn’t tell her,” he says. “I got to tell her afterwards and she burst into tears. She’d come to every game so there’s such a strong connection. I would come and visit in the summers and beg to be taken along to Boothferry Park.”\nYet there is also a sadness that she did not get to see her grandson manage the club. “She passed away a year ago, pretty much to the day, when I took the job,” he adds.\n“She was cremated and her casket had a Hull City scarf on. Cottingham cemetery, literally three minutes from here. She must be looking down on me. She’d be so proud. The fans have always sung ‘His Nanna’s from Hull’ to me and when they did that after my first game there was a tear in my eye.”\nRosenior played 161 games for Hull City, including the 2014 FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal. There was a promotion out of the Championship, too. Rosenior even captained the club during a short run through Europa League qualifying stages. It all ended with mistrust and apathy but the reign of the Allam family, who sold the club to Ilicali last January, helped place the club on the map.\n“The pride in this city is still there,” says Rosenior. “It’s a unique city with a unique history. My mum used to take me to the William Wilberforce museum here and show me how important this city was in the abolition of slavery.\nAdvertisement\n“It was brilliant when Hull won UK City of Culture (in 2017), I was part of the campaign. It needs investment and it needs a different way of thinking from the outside. There’s not enough investment and support from central government. It’s a much better place than people give it credit for.”\nSaturday will not be an ordinary away day for Hull City. An allocation of almost 2,500 is close to being sold out and taking most of the travelling fans to Stoke will be a convoy of 37 coaches offering complimentary travel.\nIt was the idea of Ilicali and free buses will be offered to the eight remaining away games that follow. “If we can help them, it’s only right we do it,” he said. Ilicali saw fit to take 320 fans, drawn out at random, on an all-inclusive trip to his native Turkey during the mid-season break.\nRosenior is grinning when the concept is raised. “It all comes from such a generous place,” he says. “He has a gift of being able to make people feel good about themselves. He’s one in a million.”\nThat assessment comes from personal experience. Ilicali insisted on taking Rosenior and his wife, Erica, to the World Cup final in Qatar on his private jet.\n“He mentioned it about 10 days before saying it might happen and I said, ‘Mr Chairman, don’t worry, take your family and your loved ones’,” says Rosenior. “He then called me three days before the Sunderland game (a 1-1 draw on December 17) to chat about a few things and he said, ‘Oh, by the way, you and your wife will come on the plane.’\nView this post on Instagram\n“It wasn’t a question of whether or not we’d come, we were told we’re going. We jumped in the car after that game, straight to Humberside airport and on a plane to Qatar. It was a whirlwind. Something I’ll never forget.”\nRosenior has begun to repay the trust — and generosity — of Hull’s colourful owner with a run of four wins in six games since. Keep that up away to Stoke and that push for the play-offs will not feel quite so improbable.\n(Top photos: Getty Images and Phil Buckingham; design: Sam Richardson)",
