Drawn against PSG, AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund.\nThe proverbial Group of Death producing a fascinating set of matches with such fine margins in play.\nNewcastle United, despite a horrendous number of missing players, were only minutes away from qualifying for the Champions League last 16 in their final group game, but those fine margins went against them in the end, their sixth group match summing that up.\nWith of course an outrageous very late penalty decision having cheated NUFC out of almost certain progress, with PSG and Mbappe gifted a lifeline to draw against Newcastle in that fifth round of group matches.\nIt simply wasn’t to be.\nHowever, we are seeing just how well Newcastle United did in being so competitive in this Champions League campaign.\nThe two clubs that did qualify for the last 16 from Newcastle’s group, ending up with both in the semi-finals AND one of them in the final for sure.\nLast night in Paris, another excellent match that could have gone either way, as two top sides battled for the ultimate prize, that Champions League final at Wembley.\nFor Newcastle United fans with these two clubs from our Group of Death, I think fair to say the overwhelming majority of NUFC supporters were rooting for Borussia Dortmund.\nThe experience this season for sure, is that as a club and as a fanbase, Borussia Dortmund are a different class to PSG.\nSo happily, the good guys emerged the winners and head to Wembley, Borussia Dortmund putting in another excellent performance and winning 1-0 with a 50th minute Hummels goal. A 2-0 aggregate victory, winning home and away.\nPSG of course didn’t take defeat well and amongst claims they were the better team, the one who deserved to go through, as well as other similar nonsense. The simple fact remains that whilst they did hit the woodwork six times over the two legs, including four times last night, if you don’t manage a single goal in over three hours of football then you can hardly claim you were unlucky. Indeed, despite dominating possession, it was actually Dortmund who arguably created the very best chances and PSG’s keeper who made the very best saves.\nAbsolutely bizarre, that the two clubs from Newcastle United’s group made the semi-finals and now Borussia Dortmund go forward to the final. Anybody who claims NUFC’s Group of Death wasn’t an incredibly tough challenge and Newcastle United doing so well to do what they did in the circumstances, they’ve very wide of the mark\nI have no idea whether two clubs from the same Champions League group have previously both got to the semi-finals but certainly unique this season. Indeed, Newcastle United’s group was the only one to produce more than one club that got to the quarter-final stage.\nLife can be cruel and if that shocking penalty decision hadn’t happened in Paris, then Newcastle United would have been all but qualified for the knockout stages and indeed, they would have only needed a draw in the final game against AC Milan. Which I am 100 per cent sure would have been achieved if that had been the case. Which would of course have also meant PSG heading out at the group stage… and just maybe, this would have been Newcastle United contesting a two-legged Champions League semi-final with fellow Group of Death participants, Borussia Dortmund.\nI think that is why we love football so much AND hate it at the same time.\nThese fine margins that at times go for you AND at other times against you.\nGood luck to Borussia Dortmund in the final.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
