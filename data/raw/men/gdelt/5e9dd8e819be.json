  "body_text": "Champions League: PSG Wins, France Loses\nHélène de Lauzun, European Conservative, June 2, 2025\nParis Saint-Germain’s victory over Inter Milan in the Champions League final on the night of Saturday, May 31st, led to scenes of unprecedented violence in the French capital—a far cry from the festive atmosphere promised by a few blissful souls who still believe that football brings people together and unites them.\nThe atmosphere was like a dress rehearsal for a civil war. The authorities’ impotence and blindness can only be cause for concern in the face of the chaos that is coming, patiently organised over the last 50 years through mass immigration and a lenient justice system.\nIn Paris, tensions rose gradually as PSG’s score against Inter Milan climbed. 5-0: a resounding victory, but for whom?\nIn a matter of moments, the streets of Paris were engulfed in violence.\nThis came as no surprise. Several hours earlier, shopkeepers in the city centre and at several locations in the capital—primarily the Champs-Élysées—had barricaded themselves in. In the afternoon, the metro was shut and transport was not guaranteed ‘for security reasons.’ A strange and disturbing atmosphere reigned in the city. It was a new kind of Battle of Britain, since, jokes aside, if we are to believe the analysis of former interior minister Gérald Darmanin during the previous Champions League final, the troublemakers may have been “English supporters.”\nIs it normal to draw the curtains, to set up roadblocks, fences, and security perimeters for a football match? No, of course not. But the French seem to have become accustomed to another form of normality.\nIn fact, as during the Liverpool-Madrid match of grim memory, hordes of ‘barbarians,’ in the words of interior minister Bruno Retailleau, descended on the city. These ‘barbarians’ were of North African and African origin, as was clearly shown in the videos that flooded social media. But these barbarians were almost all French nationals.\nReplacement is not a myth. The massive settlement of these populations on French soil is a reality that clashes head-on with the authorities’ irenic discourse on ‘living together’. On Saturday evening, Paris was the scene of raids by individuals who have only a very distant connection with the city of Robert Doisneau and Edith Piaf. Victory for Paris, but which Paris are we talking about? On Saturday evening, the Champs-Élysées smelled like hell, and the new Children of Paradise, to paraphrase Marcel Carné’s masterpiece of Parisian cinema (Les Enfants du Paradis), had faces full of hatred and destruction. We saw thousands of gangs who were there to destroy and loot, and who did so with complete impunity because they knew they risked absolutely nothing.\nThe mainstream press coverage of the events bears no resemblance to what actually happened on the ground. Fortunately, social media, and first and foremost the X platform, are playing their role in providing real information during such events: mortar fire; roofs on fire; the ring road blocked by wild, hairy people shouting and harassing cars; shops destroyed and looted; cars burned—this is what Parisians saw and heard on Saturday evening. In my own apartment, you could even smell the gunpowder as smoke came through the closed windows.\nIn such a chaotic environment, the fact that there was a so-called right-wing interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, who has been trying hard for several months to make his mark with pseudo-tough talk, did absolutely nothing to change the situation. The police and judicial system are rotten to the core. Numerous law enforcement officers took to social media to point out how nothing was done to anticipate such an outbreak of violence. The Macronist authorities were much more zealous when it came to controlling the yellow vest protests. Above all, the police are paralysed in their actions by instructions from above that kill any possibility of real law enforcement: no deaths, no injuries, avoid blunders at all costs—and leave the field to the rioters. The police were therefore completely overwhelmed. As Baudoin Wisselman, from our colleagues at Frontières magazine, sums it up, “What is happening is no longer law enforcement, it is urban counter-guerrilla warfare.”\nThe result: two deaths and nearly 700 fires. Yet Emmanuel Macron chose this moment to express his “pride” with street slang—“champion, brother!” One wonders what exactly he is proud of.\nThis ‘Saturday night fever’ will be remembered for a few terribly symbolic images.\nThe statue of Joan of Arc, swarmed by half-naked men who climbed and bellowed atop her—oblivious not only to who she was, but to the very meaning of the word respect.\nAt the end of the match, a scandalous moment, when MMA star Khabib Nurmagomedov, who had rejoiced at the beheading of Samuel Paty, refused to shake hands with the CBS Sports presenter—a woman, of course—forcing her to apologise.\nFinally, a photo of Dembelé, one of the PSG players, standing in front of the cup with his veiled wife.\nParis Saint-Germain has long since ceased to have any connection with Paris or Saint-Germain. It is a club owned by Qatar, which is there to defend its own interests. The football ‘celebration’ was an opportunity for all the Hamas supporters who were there to cheer on the players from the Maghreb and Africa to promote militant Islam. “Fuck Israel” could be heard chanted by supporters around the Parc des Princes, while in the evening, Palestinian flags flew alongside Algerian colours. Congolese player Désiré Doué may have thanked Christ for his victory, but he was very much alone.\nAs the left-wing newspaper Libération headlined the day after the club’s victory, Qatar is “getting closer to its goal.” Paris and France, on the other hand, continue to lose.",
