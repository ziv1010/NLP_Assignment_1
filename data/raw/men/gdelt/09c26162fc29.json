  "body_text": "Only a few days after the euphoria of lifting their first Champions League trophy, senior Manchester City figures learned the disappointing news that they were losing their captain Ilkay Gundogan to Barcelona.\nAt the same time, they knew it made all the sense in the world.\nFirst, it meant a new challenge for a player whose seven seasons at City could be seen as having reached the ultimate high point in sealing last season’s treble. And from a footballing point of view, the German going to play under Xavi totally added up.\nAdvertisement\n“There’s almost no one you can compare to Xavi in terms of legacy and impact in football, but in terms of who would be closest to a ‘Xavi-esque’ player, there are not many better names than Gundogan,” a senior City source, who asked to remain anonymous as they did not have permission to speak, said at the time.\nBoth Xavi and Gundogan are renowned for compensating for any physical inferiority with their tactical intelligence and superb technique. Their careers have also been shaped in similar ways.\nLet’s start with Xavi.\nNow 43, he made his Barcelona debut in 1998, arriving in their first-team squad labelled as a defensive holding midfielder. He was an example of the classic Barcelona ‘pivot’ moulded at their renowned academy — in the same way that Pep Guardiola had been almost a decade before.\nGO DEEPER\nWhy everyone wants Xabi Alonso as their next head coach\nXavi came through the ranks first looking up to Guardiola, then mirroring his style, then competing with him for a place in the starting line-up.\nThe real breakthrough in Xavi’s career would come when Frank Rijkaard began to play him higher up the pitch.\nThe Dutchman, who took over as manager in 2003, was the first to believe Xavi could evolve into an attacking midfielder. He positioned Xavi on the pitch with more-defensive players in deeper roles behind him, such as Edgar Davids, Thiago Motta or Edmilson.\nBarcelona won the Champions League in 2006, with Xavi only on the bench for the final following an injury lay-off but by then established in his new role. His progression continued, thanks to the influence of then-Spain coach Luis Aragones, and of Guardiola when he became Barca manager in 2008.\nThe rest, of course, is history.\nGundogan’s change from a defensive midfielder to a more attacking one followed similar lines.\nNow 32, he made his Bundesliga debut in 2009 with Nuremberg, and was always seen as a versatile midfielder, but his best moments in Germany came when paired with Sven Bender in a double pivot at Borussia Dortmund.\nAdvertisement\nHe joined City in 2016, as Guardiola’s first signing, and in the early days there were questions over his defensive capabilities. Gundogan was not the archetypal sole holding midfielder you would expect to see in a Guardiola side, but he certainly shone in an extended spell in that role in 2019 when Fernandinho was out through injury.\nThen, during the pandemic in 2020, Guardiola found himself short on options in attack. He saw in Gundogan what Rijkaard had seen in Xavi: a footballer who was so capable of reading play and predicting patterns that he could easily adapt to a different role. That’s how the Germany international became a false nine, and he would finish as City’s top scorer for the 2020-21 season with 17 goals in all competitions.\nGundogan still served as a multi-functional tool for City, but it was the attacking side of his game, perfected in recent years, that convinced Xavi and Barcelona to push for his signing as a free agent this summer.\nSo what about that earlier suggestion — that Gundogan is the most “Xavi-esque” footballer around? Well, let’s take a deeper look at how he is settling in at Barca. Although we should first make a more general point.\nXavi and Gundogan have been part of totally different squads at Barcelona, not just in terms of quality but also regarding the formation and tactics used. There are differences between the role Gundogan has now and the one Xavi played at his peak.\nBut there are lots of similarities, too.\nThis first graphic shows Xavi’s open-play touches during the 2008-09 campaign. This was the first season with Guardiola in charge, when Barcelona won the treble.\nXavi’s main area of operation was the right of central midfield, where he took 15 per cent of his touches. But 11 per cent of his touches came in the central attacking zone, close to the opposition box.\nAdvertisement\nWe are still in the early days of Gundogan’s Barca career — he’s only made seven La Liga appearances, and one of those was from the bench — so the next graphic is based on a small sample size. But most of his touches (14 per cent) have been in that same zone, just outside the penalty area.\nWe can also see how Gundogan does not tend to sit deep the way Xavi did.\nThis is mainly because this team don’t really need him back there.\nInstead, the right side of their midfield is normally where Frenkie de Jong starts with the ball, playing alongside holding midfielder Oriol Romeu. And the late loan signing of Joao Cancelo, also from City — a full-back with a tendency to play inside — means there is even less reason for Gundogan to replicate that aspect of Xavi’s old role.\nDuring his latter years at City, Gundogan became more of a box-crasher than a game-builder — and that’s what Xavi wants from him, too. He has made it quite clear that he does not want him to play deeper. Even when Romeu was rested against Royal Antwerp in last week’s opening Champions League group game, the manager preferred to use De Jong in defensive midfield rather than Gundogan, who is arguably the better match.\nIn his press conference before that Antwerp game, Xavi said: “We know he can play at the base of midfield, but right now my backroom staff and I believe that Gundogan’s biggest impact has to take place close to the box, or even stepping in. With Pedri injured, we need him even more in there.”\nTaking all that into account, though, there is something that does not truly click.\nXavi also stated that “everything gets better when Gundogan has the ball”. But he does not really have it that much — certainly not compared with Xavi’s years in the Barca midfield.\nBetween 2008 and 2013, Xavi’s average number of touches per La Liga game was always above 100 (123.0 in 2010-11 was the highest, 101.6 in 2008-09 the lowest). After his first seven La Liga games, Gundogan is averaging 63.7 touches.\nAdvertisement\nAgain, this is a small sample size — and in one of those seven games, against Cadiz, he had 114 touches. But in all three of the La Liga matches Barcelona have played against a five-man defence, Gundogan’s number of touches were low: 74 against Getafe, 68 against Celta Vigo, and 51 against Mallorca.\nIn his seven Premier League seasons at City, Gundogan averaged 87.7 touches per 90 minutes. Those are not close to peak Xavi figures either, but it still represents a significant increase on his current rate.\nHe registered more touches in his early years, operating in deeper positions that saw him more involved in the build-up process when Guardiola’s system was still in development. As that system was solidified, City pushed Gundogan higher up the pitch, and didn’t really need him to be as heavily involved in possession terms as he was.\nAs the graphic below shows, Gundogan’s start at Barca has yielded similar stats to Xavi when it comes to assists per game, passing accuracy, dribbles completed, and the number of possessions won.\nEight overall games into the season at his new club, Gundogan is yet to score for Barcelona. But Xavi certainly sounds convinced of his worth.\n“He does everything well, absolutely everything. If we play well, it is because of guys like him,” the manager said after the 5-0 win over Real Betis on September 16. “His signing was Heaven-sent, honestly. He is a superlative player, a total joy to watch.”\nXavi pushed hard for Gundogan’s signing this summer, and if the club decided to offer a man who turns 33 next month a three-year contract it was because the manager expects him to perform a pivotal role in improving Barcelona’s ability to entertain and perform in an attractive way.\nFor a club obsessed with making progress towards that, the more Gundogan is involved the better.\n(Top photo: Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)",
