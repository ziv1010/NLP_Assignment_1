Mauricio Pochettino says the drama involving Christian Pulisic is “behind us”. So all’s well with the USMNT again. Right?\nOn the way:\n🗣️ Analysing Poch’s remarks\n™️ The Gyokeres finish\n🤔 What next for Mainoo?\n🧤 Double goalkeeping ordeal\nAdvertisement\nBack together: Poch names USMNT squad, insists Pulisic issue is ‘behind us’\nAs the USMNT scene set about eating itself over the past few weeks, the only thing missing was an intervention from the top. What did head coach Mauricio Pochettino make of the national disharmony?\nWe’d have paid a penny, or a cent, for his thoughts, but we don’t have to because yesterday, Pochettino gave them freely. A press conference called to tee up next month’s friendlies against South Korea and Japan was his first since the USMNT’s Gold Cup disappointment, and his first since the fixation with all things Christian Pulisic hit a crescendo. Needless to say, The Athletic was in the front row.\nPochettino’s plate is nothing if not full. The aftermath of Pulisic’s non-appearance at the Gold Cup — the debate about it and the politics caused by it — has been a mess. For longer than is healthy, the USMNT have been a bit of a shambles, too. We’ll dissect Poch’s latest U.S. squad shortly, but first, let’s get to the matter of Pulisic.\nQuestions about the forward were bound to be asked, firstly because of the flames around him over the summer and also because Pochettino’s comments about Pulisic sitting out the Gold Cup only served to fan them. None of it gave the impression that the relationship between head coach and long-time U.S. talisman was safe and sound.\nPochettino revealed yesterday that he hasn’t spoken to Pulisic since the Gold Cup ended, but he did describe past events as “behind us”. Pulisic is in the squad to play Japan and South Korea. Poch said: “We need to look forward. We have a plan for every single player and the plan for Christian now is to call and to see him in this camp.”\nIt’s a line drawn — of sorts.\nWhere’s McKennie?\nA fit Pulisic missing this camp would have been incredibly strange, so I took his inclusion as read. What attracted more comments were the notable omissions, including that of a certain Weston McKennie.\nAdvertisement\nPochettino said the Juventus midfielder had been left out in part because of an offseason disrupted by FIFA’s Club World Cup, and in part because his standing in the pecking order at Juve is less than certain (when is it ever anything else?). “We already know Weston,” Pochettino insisted. “It’s not necessary to call him.”\nA similar stance was taken with other high-profile absentees: Yunus Musah, Johnny Cardoso and Gio Reyna, for example. It’s anticipated that when the next batch of fixtures comes around in October, Pochettino’s roster will look more familiar. There’s an experimental feel to his latest round of call-ups.\nWhich is fine, except Poch has all of 10 matches in front of him before the 2026 World Cup; eight after the South Korea and Japan friendlies. Paul Tenorio can see what the U.S. coach is doing, but feels a touch concerned about how far away the country’s line-up is from picking itself.\nI asked another of our American writers, Henry Bushnell, what he made of Pochettino’s press conference. These were his thoughts:\n“Two pressing questions jumped to the front of U.S. minds upon seeing Mauricio Pochettino’s September roster. One: Uh, what the heck is this? Two: What’s the state of Poch’s relationship with Christian Pulisic?\n“Pochettino’s answers, on a Tuesday Zoom call with reporters, were unconvincing. He essentially admitted this is another experimental roster (even though he’ll only have three more to name before picking his World Cup squad).\n“And he seemed to confirm he hasn’t spoken with Pulisic since May. He said the inharmonious back-and-forth between the two ‘is behind us’ — but if they haven’t talked, how do we know Pulisic feels that way?”\nFair points, which I think many USMNT fans will agree with. Get in touch and tell me if I’m wrong.\nNews round-up\n- Celtic losing to Kazakhstan’s Kairat Almaty in Champions League qualifying is an abysmal result. It will cost them well over £15m ($20m). Kasper Schmeichel having to concede a free kick by punching a daft backpass off his own goal line, above, was their performance in a nutshell.\n- The suspicion that West Ham United are falling apart is palpable. They lost in England’s Carabao Cup last night and the usually affable Jarrod Bowen got drawn into an argument with his own fans. He’s since apologised. Will the signing of Monaco midfielder Soungoutou Magassa help them?\n- After spending the entirety of his career to date at Real Madrid, Lucas Vazquez will continue it in Germany at Bayer Leverkusen. He’s just turned 34, but it’s a solid free transfer.\n- The Premier League has issued a reminder to its 20 teams about avoiding ‘politically motivated’ material inside their stadiums. This includes symbolism relating to the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East.\n- Newcastle United would have a hard time attracting wasps to a jam jar. They’ve offered £55m for Wolverhampton Wanderers striker Jorgen Strand Larsen – but Wolves have knocked it back.\n- Another £20m drops into the accounts at Chelsea. They’ve sold midfielder Carney Chukwuemeka to Borussia Dortmund.\n- And, fuelled by that money, the Stamford Bridge club are considering bidding for Barcelona’s Fermin Lopez.\n- Tottenham Hotspur prospect Luka Vuskovic is in line to spend the rest of this season on loan at Hamburg. Talks about the 18-year-old defender are making progress.\nTrademark finish: Gyokeres strikes against Leeds, but we’ve seen it before…\nArjen Robben, the former Bayern Munich and Chelsea winger, had a trademark method of scoring goals: attack down the right, cut inside, shoot with his left foot, boom. Ad infinitum.\nAdvertisement\nIt was telegraphed and it was obvious, yet even with fair warning, defenders were often hopeless at negating it. And there’s a little bit of that in Viktor Gyokeres, because he has a favourite trick of his own: burst into the left channel, dink back across his marker and then drive a finish low inside the near post, also on repeat.\nWe saw it against Leeds United on Saturday (above) when Gyokeres scored his first competitive goals for Arsenal, and Stu James reckons we’ll see a lot more of it going forward because Gyokeres made it his calling card with Sporting CP in Portugal.\nArsenal were crying out for more menace in that area of the pitch, and Gyokeres looks like giving them it. To my mind, it’s the surest sign of quality: telling the opposition what you’re going to do, then doing it regardless. Robben would approve.\nAround TAFC\n- If I was a betting man, I’d say Manchester United and Kobbie Mainoo are about to go their separate ways. That’s certainly the thrust of Mark Critchley and Laurie Whitwell’s piece about the midfielder this morning. Ruben Amorim clearly isn’t sold on him.\n- After his stunning winner for Liverpool at Newcastle United, you’d assume that Rio Ngumoha will go supersonic. But when Gregg Evans went back through the list of Liverpool’s youngest goalscorers, it told a more cautionary story.\n- I properly enjoyed our podcast on the mayhem at St James’ Park. It’s free to download on Apple and Spotify. Our writers weren’t fooled into thinking that Liverpool’s dramatic victory meant they don’t have issues to resolve. Or, perhaps, more players to sign.\n- Most clicked in Tuesday’s TAFC: the best kits across the globe. How did Dunfermline not make the cut?\nCatch a match\n(Selected games, times ET/UK)\nCarabao Cup second round: Everton vs Mansfield Town, 2.45pm/7.45pm — CBS, Paramount+, Amazon Prime/Sky Sports.

It’s almost existential.\nA boycott of their Carabao Cup tie against Leeds United last night meant home fans were virtually outnumbered by away fans. Resources are so thin that Wednesday’s line-up had an average age of 21, including five teenagers. It wasn’t far off an academy team.\nBut we’ll park the poor-me vibe for one day because improbably, they turned Leeds over, progressing to round three via a penalty shootout. And kudos to Leeds goalkeeper Karl Darlow, above, for charitably helping them on their way. It’s behind you…\n(Top photo: Logan Riely/USSF/Getty Images for USSF)",
