While some may see him as a flop and point at him as a figure of fun, there exists an emotional tale behind the journey.\nGrowing up abandoned by his folks, his life took a significant turn when, after being abandoned by his parents, a distinguished showing at the Homeless World Cup led him to be noticed by United.\nBut Sir Alex Ferguson, it turned out, hadn’t seen the £7million signing play before finalising the deal, and when Bebe did get a game for United, he was a major disappointment.\nBut to fully grasp the significance of Bebe’s rise and subsequent fall, we must return to the start of his story. The 12-year-old Bebe’s parents abandoned him, unable to provide for him any longer.\nHe spent eight years at a church-run homeless shelter in Santo Antao do Toja, Portugal. Here, he learned to read, write and play football. During his time at the shelter, Bebe was asked to play at the Homeless World Cup. He made quite an impression, scoring 40 goals in just six matches.\nDespite his success, Bebe admitted that he only played in the competition for fun. However, it turned out to be a pivotal moment in his life.\nRead Also: Reducing cost of governance (2)\n“I didn’t want to sign for a team because I did not want to have to leave the orphanage,” he said about the surge of interest that came his way as he approached his 20th birthday.\nEventually, Bebe signed with Estrela da Amadora, a team from Portugal’s third tier. Even there, he stood out as an exceptional player.\nThe club was in a financial pickle and quickly tried to sell Bebe, who seemed destined for greatness. He moved to top-tier team Vitoria de Guimaraes in June 2010, where his career took off. Although he didn’t play a competitive game for Vitoria, he scored five goals in six friendly matches.\nCarlos Quieroz, Ferguson’s trusted assistant, was impressed.\nIn the summer of 2010, there were whispers of interest from Benfica and even Real Madrid. This was a time when scouting and data-analysis networks weren’t as common in football as they are today.\nBut word was spreading about the former homeless lad who was making waves in Portuguese football. Vitoria had twice increased the forward’s release clause in five weeks, realising how valuable Bebe had become.\nSuper-agent Jorge Mendes, who had previously worked with United on deals to sign Cristiano Ronaldo, Anderson and Nani from Portugal, played a part in the transfer. Advice from Quieroz also helped make it happen.\nJust five weeks after signing for Vitoria and a little over a year after living in a homeless shelter, Bebe became a Manchester United player.\nUnited chief executive David Gill admitted as the 20-year-old was introduced alongside Chris Smalling and Javier Hernandez by Ferguson: “He’s a player we’ve been following but he really came on the scene in the last week or so,”\nBebe was taken aback by the rapid changes in his life. He confessed to MEN Sport in 2018: “It was an amazing feeling because it was something I never expected to happen,” and “I was surprised by the news – I thought it was a joke. It was a week until I believed everything that was happening to me.”\nDespite Sir Alex Ferguson breaking his rule of signing players he hadn’t seen play, Bebe and he got along well. The coaching staff had faith in Bebe’s potential at Old Trafford, confirming he wouldn’t be loaned out and would join the first-team squad for the 2010/11 season. To help him settle in, he was quickly taught English.\nBebe fondly remembers his early days at United, where he began to feel like he belonged. He said: “From day one, my relationship with Sir Alex was like what a father has with his son. He is a person who trusted me without even seeing me play. It is impossible to forget someone like that.” and “I started believing it in my head on that day, it took a lot to believe it!”\nAs it happens, Bebe’s debut for United happened when Ferguson wasn’t present. The Scottish manager was scouting in Valencia while Mike Phelan managed a League Cup game at Scunthorpe in September 2010. Bebe played the last 20 minutes of a 5-2 win for United, alongside Gabriel Obertan, Federico Macheda and Michael Owen.\nBebe scored goals in back-to-back games, first against Wolves in the League Cup and then in a Champions League match at Bursaspor. He helped United reach the Champions League last-16, but his playing time decreased due to better forward options and poor performances.\nIn a league game against Wolves, Bebe disappointed and was substituted after playing 64 minutes on the wing. His transfer fee started to weigh heavily and fans were not happy. His final appearance for United was in a 1-0 FA Cup win over Crawley in February 2011, but he was still seen with the team during their Premier League trophy parade in May that year.\nSir Alex Ferguson saw something special in Bebe, as he mentioned in his book from 2013. He said: “Bebe came with limitations but there was a talent there. He had fantastic feet.” Also, “He struck the ball with venom, off either foot, with no drawback. He was not the complete player, but we were coaching him to be better. On the big pitch his concept of team play needed work. With feet like his, he was capable of scoring 20 goals a season.”\nBut Bebe himself later confessed he didn’t give it his all at United. “I could have used the opportunity better when I was there,” he admitted. “I thought, ‘I’m here, I’m doing well and I don’t have to try hard every day’. It was my fault.”\nAfter that, Bebe went through a tough time. He was sent to play for other teams like Besiktas, Rio Ave, and Pacos de Ferreira. His difficult days at United didn’t end until 2014, long after Ferguson had left.\nBebe’s story is almost like a movie, going from very poor to very rich, but he ended up unhappy at United. He was eager for his agent to find him a new club.\nWhen Benfica agreed to buy him for £2.4 million, Bebe said it was “the best moment of my life!” He also shared: “Every day I called my agent to ask him to get me out. It was a bad time.”\n“It was a dream to play [at Benfica] because all my friends and my family supported Benfica.”\nBebe has been with Rayo Vallecano in Spain since 2015. He joined them permanently in July 2018 after two loan spells. Now 33, Bebe is still part of their La Liga team, playing a few times this season.\nHis handful of international appearances for Cape Verde had been unremarkable – until he scored a 40-yard free-kick reminiscent of Cristiano Ronaldo’s Champions League semi-final effort against Arsenal – in the Africa Cup of Nations on Friday, and has found himself back in the limelight once again.\nMany think his time at United wasn’t without much fondness, as it was too much for him too soon. Some people remember Bebe as an example of when signings from abroad didn’t work out at Old Trafford, especially in the later years of Ferguson’s management.\nManchester United and Andre Onana needed a break from each other after difficult six months\nBut calling Bebe a ‘flop’ might be unfair. He went from living on Lisbon’s streets to playing at Old Trafford in just one year. It wasn’t really his fault things didn’t work out at United.\nIn the end, Bebe was keen to move on from United, but he should feel very proud that he got there at all.\n· This article was first published in www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk",
