And such has been their woeful form this season, Slot has seen his job called into question on more than one occasion.\nWith our correspondent Fraser Fletcher confirming last month that Xabi Alonso has said yes to a sensational Anfield return if the opportunity arises, Slot now once again finds his job on the line after winning just one of their last seven Premier League games.\nHowever, according to trusted Liverpool FC journalist, David Lynch, FSG have no immediate plans to sack Slot in the wake of Sunday’s demoralising defeat.\nPosting on X, he wrote at 8.26pm on Sunday February 8: ‘The word from Liverpool is that Arne Slot is safe, but I don’t really buy the idea he can afford endless poor performances and bad results until the end of the season. Today was both, in my opinion.’\nThat view is also shared by Jamie Carragher, while another former Liverpool player also thinks Slot is on borrowed time…\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?

That’s put a bit of money in the bank for him.\n“The drop off is huge from last season. They are currently outside of the top five places for a Champions League spot. That’s not good enough for Liverpool Football Club.\n“They have been losing at home, drawing against Burnley at Anfield, and those kinds of performances should not be happening after Liverpool spent all that money last summer.”\nSpeaking to Match of the Day, Slot said of the defeat: “A lot has happened, which is normal in this fixture. For us, we are disappointed to come away without a result\n“In the first half, Manchester City were the better team without creating many big chances but they had the ball more in our half. In the second half, we were on top and had good moments. We went 1-0 up and hardly gave anything away. Just before the end, a deflected cross falls good for them, and it’s 1-1. We tried to prevent, but they won the first header. Good anticipation from Bernardo [Silva] and good finish.\n“We are getting almost used to conceding a goal in extra time; it happened again today.”\nAsked if he can take any positives from the defeat, he replied: “Of course. In the second half we pressed really high and played good football. You cannot compare this game with three or four months ago, we have improved so much, but we need to improve the results.\n“So many times this year we haven’t got what I think we deserve, and this is another time.”\nLiverpool latest: Another Newcastle star wanted; 2024 signing to depart\nMeanwhile, Liverpool are keen to bolster their midfield options in the summer, and they have shown concrete interest in a key Newcastle player, and have already made contact over a possible summer deal, according to our transfer correspondent Graeme Bailey.\nElsewhere, new revelations from Spain shed light on the future of Ibrahima Konate with Real Madrid’s true intentions over the Frenchman – out of contract this summer – now emerging via a top Spanish journalist.\nAnd finally, Liverpool have already identified a 2024 signing to cash in on in the summer of 2026, according to a report, which has revealed the transfer fee that the club’s owners, FSG, want for him.\nGet the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.",
