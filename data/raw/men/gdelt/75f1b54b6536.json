Wins over both Leicester in the league and Brentford in the cup have the potential to get our season back on track and the Toon will be hoping to achieve some elusive consistency to fire us up that league table.\nIpswich however, will be desperate for three points of their own, to ease away from the relegation zone where only four points separate fifteenth and the dreaded eighteenth place. They’re also hoping to build on recent success, having beaten Wolves last weekend.\nForm\nIn their past six league matches, Newcastle have really struggled for any type of momentum, winning two, drawing two and losing two. This lack of consistency has led to us being stuck in mid-table when a few more wins could easily have had us competing for the Champions League places.\nOur wins have come in spectacular fashion against Nottingham Forest (3-1) and Leicester (4-0), whereas draws with Crystal Palace (1-1) and Liverpool (3-3) have probably shown both the best and worst of NUFC this season. Defeats however. to West Ham (2-0) and Brentford (4-2), were both poor and frustrating in equal measure. If all results were to go our way over the weekend then we could climb as high as sixth in the league, just a point behind Man City. A defeat coupled with poor results elsewhere could have us in thirteenth.\nIpswich have won twice in their past six matches and these are their only wins of the season, against Wolves (2-1) and Tottenham (2-1), they’ve also drawn with Man United (1-1) but lost to Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. All results going their way could see them out of the relegation zone on Christmas Day, though a disastrous weekend could see them down in nineteenth on goal difference.\nLast time out\nIn the league, Newcastle ruthlessly took Leicester apart last weekend, running out 4-0 winners in a match where we easily could have scored ten! Murphy (2), Bruno and Isak did the damage as United got four goals for the first time this season.\nIn the League Cup, NUFC progressed to the semi-final on Wednesday night with a 3-1 win over Brentford. Tonali struck twice in the first half to put the Toon in control and Schar put the match beyond doubt when Bruno unselfishly set him up for a tap-in to make it 3-0. Brentford pulled one back but Newcastle can look forward to just the third League Cup semi-final in our history.\nIpswich enjoyed only their second win all season last weekend, beating Wolves 2-1 away with a goal four minutes into the injury time. They’re yet to win at home this campaign and will be desperate to put that right on Saturday afternoon.\nStat attack!\nNewcastle have visited Ipswich just four times in the Premier League, winning two, drawing one and losing one.\nNewcastle have won three of their last five matches away at Ipswich in all competitions.\nNewcastle have won just two premier league matches on their travels all season and Ipswich are yet to win at home.\nMemorable match\nIn 2009, Newcastle were tipped for big things in the Championship with high hopes of promotion back to the big time. We travelled to Ipswich in September hoping to reclaim top spot in the table. The Tractor boys had earmarked this match as a day of celebration in memory of Sir Bobby Robson, who had sadly passed away a few months previously. By the end of the ninety minutes the celebrations were in full swing in an ecstatic away end, as the travelling Toon Army gloried in one of the highlights of the season.\nThe match had been given some extra spice by the presence of a certain ex-Sunderland manager and Man United captain. Roy Keane had enjoyed success against the Toon in the past but today he would be forced to scowl his way through dog’s abuse from NUFC fans as United ran riot!\nIn the thirtieth minute, Kevin Nolan buried a header from a Ryan Taylor free-kick to set the tone for a glorious victory. The celebrations were still in full swing when Nolan bore down on goal again, gave the defender the slip and put United 2-0 up to spark scenes of utter delirium behind the goal. Things were to get even better just a few minutes later when Ryan Taylor smashed home an outrageous freekick to put the Toon 3-0 and in absolute dreamland!\nThe second half was an understandably more tepid affair but Toon fans delighted themselves by reminding Roy Keane of the score, as well as his past affiliation with the two clubs we utterly despise. There was time however for Kevin Nolan to complete his hat-trick with a close range header. Final score Ipswich 0-4 Newcastle. Brilliant!\nPlayed for both\nSir Bobby Robson didn’t play for either side but his impact on the two clubs can never be underestimated.\nWinning the FA Cup with Ipswich in 1978 and UEFA Cup in 1981, he also had them competing at the top of the league, finishing runners-up in the first division (now Premier League) on two occasions. He is one of the most celebrated managers in their entire history and have a statue in his honour outside the ground.\nIn 1999, he came home to rescue a Newcastle team destined for relegation, beat Sheffield Wednesday 8-0 in his first home game and soon had the Toon competing at the right end of the table, finishing 3rd, 4th and 5th as well as reaching the last sixteen of the Champions League. A thousand books, poems, songs, DVDs and anecdotes can’t begin to do this wonderful man justice, but his legacy is secured through his amazing cancer charity. Rest in peace Sir Bobby. We salute you Sir.\nKieron Dyer signed for Ruud Gullit from Ipswich in 1999 and opened his account for the Toon in the infamous monsoon derby at home to the mackems. He spent a number of years at the Toon and scored some great goals. Unfortunately, a lot of injuries and questions over his attitude left most fans feeling utterly frustrated with his time at NUFC.\nDarren Ambrose was signed by Sir Bobby from Ipswich in 2003 and stayed for two seasons. He scored six goals for the Toon, including a last minute equaliser in a crazy 3-3 draw away at Southampton that helped secure a spot in the 04/05 UEFA Cup.\nManagers\nEddie Howe after a 3-1 success over Brentford in the League Cup Quarter-Final\n“I think my focus was just on tonight and trying to get through. Of course we’ve been able to do that, then you’re looking at the draw and seeing the teams left in. It’s going to be a really tough game in the semi-final, but I think for us to be there is the most important thing. We’ll take on whoever we get and do our absolute best to try and get through to a second final, that would be an incredible thing.”\nKieran McKenna after a 2-1 win away at Wolves\n“That’s football! These are moments to cherish. We’ve had a few go against us this season but had plenty go for us prior to that (on the way to promotion). So there were no violins for us on that front. It was about doing the right things as often as we could, staying competitive in every game, keep working hard on every tiny little detail – our game model, our mindset, our psychology – and hoping we could turn the margins in our favour. Today we came out on top”.\nCharity\nAs it is an away match, Newcastle United fans will not be collecting opposite the Gallowgate end, for the food bank. However, you can still help out and all online cash donations are very much appreciated. For further info and/or to donate to the food bank online go HERE.\nPrediction\nNewcastle have really struggled for consistency this season, so the chance to win three matches in a week has not come around very often. We have however been brilliant in the past two matches and I feel we’ll be too strong for Ipswich here. It won’t be easy but three points will make a fine Christmas present. Ipswich 1-2 Newcastle\nMerry Christmas to all readers of The Mag and all Toon fans across the globe.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
