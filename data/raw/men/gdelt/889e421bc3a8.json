  "body_text": "Gareth Taylor: Man City determined to dethrone Chelsea and win WSL title\n- City top of the WSL table after taking 10 points from first 12 available\n- The Cityzens have also won back-to-back games in the Champions League\n- Taylor admits team are pushing to go one better than last season's runners-up finish\nManchester City head coach Gareth Taylor says his players are determined to win the Women's Super League title for the second time after making an impressive start to the 2024/25 campaign.\nThe Cityzens, champions in 2016, have flown out of the blocks to win three of their opening four games, while they are also riding high in Europe after clinching back-to-back Champions League wins - one of them an impressive victory over holders Barcelona.\nCity's rivals Chelsea sit second in the WSL table, a point behind after playing a game less, but Taylor told his weekly press conference of his belief that City are ready to dethrone Sonia Bompastor's side – drawing on the experiences from last season's dramatic runners-up finish in order to make it happen.\n\"Yes, because of the experience we had [last season] we are better competitors this year,\" he said, asked if City are more prepared to win the league. \"We don't know what's going to happen or the outcome, but all I do know is the players have a fire in their bell and an intensity.\n\"It's not necessarily about righting any wrongs, but using the disappointment from last season to fuel this season. It was disappointing last season, when we played such exceptional football and went on some incredible record breaking runs that we fell short at the final hurdle, but we are trying to change that.\n\"It doesn't happen overnight and we aren't saying we are going to do it, but from what I've seen the determination to do it is really impressive.\"\nCity's only dropped points of the season came on the opening day of the campaign in a 2-2 draw with Arsenal – who parted ways with head coach Jonas Eidevall on Tuesday – and Taylor is pleased that his team have been able to \"execute a strong start\".\n\"It's been a good start,\" he continued. \"We set the scene in pre-season in terms of what we wanted to do as a team moving forward and we were able to execute a strong start to the season.\n\"We had a difficult start, but we handled it spot on and we are slowly getting into our rhythm and that is exciting.\"\nAston Villa are the visitors to City's Joie Stadium on Sunday, and Taylor described the Midlanders as \"tough opponents\" who \"aren't getting the rewards in terms of points for their performances so far\".\nHe added of Robert de Pauw's side: \"I think they are trying to do something different at the club which is impressive. They have very experienced players and it's likely to be a tough game for us, but we are really pleased to be back at the Joie Stadium in front of our fans as the last experience [against Barcelona] was amazing.\"",
