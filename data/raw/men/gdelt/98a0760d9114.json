  "body_text": "This game ripped up the script established at these clubs this season.\nAston Villa, revived under Unai Emery, passed up the opportunity to move nine points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur as they surrendered a two-goal lead to Chelsea at a nervous Villa Park. Instead, the visitors roused themselves, levelled in a frantic second half and were only denied a winner deep into stoppage time by a VAR review.\nAdvertisement\nA pulsating contest saw Chelsea fall behind early as Marc Cucurella put the ball into his own net. Villa added a second on the counter through Morgan Rogers and looked comfortable, only for the visitors to rally after the break. Noni Madueke pulled one back and the irrepressible Conor Gallagher equalised before Axel Disasi was denied a winner at the death.\nJacob Tanswell and Simon Johnson dissect a breathless contest at Villa Park.\nWhy were Villa so passive?\nAston Villa’s performance was mostly underpinned by a belief their ruthless streak would see them home.\nDespite taking the lead in the fourth minute, with Villa Park roaring and Chelsea’s frailties threatening to rear up once again, Emery’s side were oddly passive thereafter, seemingly content to sit in a mid-to-low block and allow Chelsea onto them. Villa averaged between 25-28 per cent possession throughout the game, in sharp contrast to the level of control Emery wants to assert through patient possession and methodical build-up.\nYet through two sweeping switch-of-play moves, Villa went into the break two goals up and apparently comfortable.\nInstead, with nerves exacerbated by the injury to Martinez, Villa were cagey after the break. They looked short of energy and dishevelled at times, still unable to gain control through ball retention and Chelsea having three times the number of shots.\nAt 2-1, Emery uncharacteristically changed his system in exchange for a more defensive structure, introducing a third centre-back in Diego Carlos and midfield anchor Tim Iroegbunam with over a quarter of an hour left to play. To no avail.\nThe anxiety engulfing Villa Park spoke of a team that has the finish line in view and recognised how crucial holding on to three points was within the grander context of the season. They may have secured Europa League football at the very least for next term, but they appeared inhibited, lacking confidence and were ultimately punished.\nIt might actually have been worse, but it was still two points dropped.\nJacob Tanswell\nAdvertisement\nDoes £1.2billion really buy you a bench like that?\nMauricio Pochettino knew from the outset that it was first XI or bust in terms of securing anything from this game.\nThere was a big clue what kind of squad Chelsea would be able to name on Friday when the club’s official app reported that 12 players were ruled out through injury. But when the team sheet came through, it still left you wondering how on earth the big spenders of the Premier League find themselves in such a predicament.\nEven taking into account that 31-year-old Marcus Bettinelli was named as one of the backup goalkeepers, the average age of the nine players on the bench came to just 20.67. And that only tells part of the story.\nThe number of Chelsea appearances they shared between them before kick-off came to just 66 — of which Axel Disasi contributed 42.\nFour of the players had not previously played a professional game in goalkeeper Ted Curd (18), Josh Acheampong (17), Tyrique George (18) and Kiano Dyer (17), all fine products of the club’s academy but untested at this level. Curd’s only experience of first-team football was playing for Hashtag United in the Isthmian League on loan earlier in the campaign.\nTo perhaps demonstrate how Pochettino was forced into making two late changes to the squad that travelled, George and Acheampong were both set to play for the under-21s against Southampton on Friday night but were pulled out a few hours before the fixture took place and told to join the senior setup instead.\nWith Chelsea trailing 2-0 at the interval, it left Pochettino with next to no options to turn the game around and reliant upon his starters to transform the contest.\nSimon Johnson\nHow much of a blow are the Tielemans and Martinez injuries?\nBoth are significant.\nTielemans has become an integral cog in Emery’s ever-evolving system. The Villa manager previously had reservations over the Belgium midfielder’s defensive discipline and played him as a more dynamic No 10. But, while Douglas Luiz was out suspended, Tielemans retreated into a deeper role in a double pivot, receiving from Villa’s centre-backs and connecting the thirds.\nAdvertisement\nIt says much of the trust he had gained with Emery that even with Douglas Luiz restored against Chelsea, the manager opted for John McGinn in the more advanced role.\nTielemans, however, began to toil before breaking down completely just before the half-hour mark, laying sprawled across the turf. He punched the ground in frustration as Moussa Diaby was being readied to replace him and he could now miss Villa’s defining run in qualifying for the Champions League and Thursday’s first leg of the UEFA Conference League semi-final against Olympiacos.\nHe walked gingerly around the edge of the pitch, receiving an ovation from Villa Park before heading down the tunnel. Scans will reveal the extent of the injury.\nBut he will not be the only Villa player anxiously awaiting the results of medical tests over the next few days.\nEmiliano Martinez had to be replaced at the break after experiencing discomfort with his hamstring in the first half. The goalkeeper needed physio attention, with Villa deciding against risking him after the break.\nEven though Martinez is suspended on Thursday, the goalkeeper being ruled out for any period of time would have big ramifications for Villa’s overall stability and on-field leadership presence.\nJacob Tanswell\nWhy does Villa Park bring the best out of Chelsea?\nThere is clearly something about Villa Park that brings out some fight in Chelsea. If only they could take this attitude into every fixture.\nThis is not the first time they have played at Aston Villa in 2024, with most people, including their own fans, writing them off. In February, they won an FA Cup fourth-round replay 3-1 here having gone into the game off the back of losing 4-1 and 4-2 to Liverpool and Wolves respectively.\nIt was a similar story this evening. They had endured the disappointment of a 1-0 defeat to Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final last weekend, followed by a club-record 5-0 scoreline against rivals Arsenal.\nAdvertisement\nAt 2-0 down, this felt like more of the same, but the second-half collapse witnessed at the Emirates Stadium four days ago was not replicated. Instead, Chelsea raised their game and laid siege to the Aston Villa goal. They enjoyed 70 per cent of the ball and, where normally second-half displays have seen them wilt, here they grew stronger.\nChelsea had almost secured an unlikely victory when Disasi headed in what the visitors believed was a winner deep into stoppage time. As it was, the VAR recommended an on-field review from the referee, with the goal duly ruled out for a nudge on Diego Carlos.\nPochettino had challenged his players on the eve of the game to prove they should be a part of things next season. This one display is not enough to do that, but at least it proves they have not given up on the campaign — unlike 12 months ago.\nSimon Johnson\nWhat did Unai Emery say?\nOn achieving Europa League qualification and targeting the Champions League: “We achieved one very great objective we had during the season — to get Europa League (football) and to still be a contender with Tottenham trying to get fourth position. You have to be motivated, excited, and very proud of our work. We have been consistent in 35 matches.”\nOn the injuries: “We have to try to keep being consistent with the players we have. I believe in the players. After this draw we are now thinking about Thursday against Olympiacos — that will be tough.”\nWhat did Mauricio Pochettino say?\nOn the disallowed goal at the end: “When the referee didn’t see anything and then goes with the VAR and changes his decision… I don’t want to talk badly about the referee, but it’s unbelievable. It’s ridiculous. It’s difficult to accept this type of thing. It’s really painful because this is damaging the image of English football. Even Aston Villa’s players, even the fans, didn’t understand why the goal was disallowed. The referee said it was a foul. But if every single challenge like this (is a foul), we’ll never finish games with 11 players.\nAdvertisement\nOn his team’s display: “The performance overall was really good. We played really well and dominated the game. We conceded two first-half goals too easily, so soft, but to come here and play against Aston Villa — like Arsenal, another team full of confidence fighting for the top four — was very pleasing. The players were so good. If we want to build something important, that is the way we have to perform.”\nWhat next for Villa?\nThursday, May 2: Olympiacos (H), Europa Conference League, 8pm BST, 3pm ET\nThe first leg of this semi-final with the return in Piraeus, a port district of Greek capital Athens, in a week’s time. The winners will play Italy’s Fiorentina or Club Bruges of Belgium, also in Athens, on May 29.\nWhat next for Chelsea?\nThursday, May 2: Tottenham (H), Premier League, 7.30pm BST, 2.30pm ET\nThe Mauricio Pochettino Clasico, with Chelsea having lost only once in the past 14 meetings (winning 10) between the two London clubs.\nRecommended reading\n- How Villa finding Watkins in the middle of the pitch is central to their success\n- Chelsea have actually become Cole Palmer Football Club\n- Villa want Emery to build a dynasty – his new contract shows the feeling’s mutual\n- Why a Premier League spending cap could signify a subtle but important power shift\n(Top photo: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images)",
