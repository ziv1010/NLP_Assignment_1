The Jangwani-based side were expected to leave early this morning with a daunting task ahead in Mauritania.\nThey are set to face group leaders Al Hilal, a Sudanese side coached by Florent Ibenge, after their impressive 3-1 victory over TP Mazembe last weekend. Although Al Hilal have already secured a place in the knockout stages, Yanga know they face a tough challenge in Sunday’s clash.\nThey must deliver a strong performance to recover from their 2-0 defeat in the first leg at home.\nThe battle for second place and the final available spot in the knockout rounds has now been narrowed to Yanga, MC Alger and TP Mazembe and the Tanzanian club is determined to secure vital points to strengthen their qualification hopes.\nSpeaking before departure, Yanga’s Media and Communication Officer, Ali Kamwe, reassured the press that the team is in good form despite the injury setbacks.\n“All our players are doing well and Clatous Chama has returned to full training. However, we will miss Maxi Nzengeli, Kouassi Attohoula Yao and Aziz Andambwile, who have recovered but are not yet fully fit for the game,” Kamwe explained.\nALSO READ: Yanga eye crucial knockout stage push in CAF CL\nThe upcoming match will take place at Cheikha Ouldi Boidiya Stadium in Nouakchott, Mauritania. A win for Yanga would bring them to seven points, putting them in a strong position to advance to the quarter-finals of the prestigious competition.\nKamwe emphasised the importance of the match, describing it as more than just another fixture.\n“This match is about more than football and it doesn’t require many words. This is a fight and our plans are different from any other match. We are heading into a battlefield and battle plans are never shared,” he said.\nIf Yanga can secure victories in their remaining two matches—against Al Hilal on Sunday and MC Alger at home at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium— they will collect 10 points and seal their place in the quarterfinals.\nAs it stands, Yanga are in third place in Group A with four points and two games in hand. Al Hilal lead the group with 10 points, while MC Alger sit second with five points. TP Mazembe are currently at the bottom of the table with just two points.",
