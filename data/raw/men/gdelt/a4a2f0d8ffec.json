Tyler Adams taking no prisoners!! #usmnt pic.twitter.com/ecN05r9rvH\n— Del Shaffer (@delshaffer) February 12, 2023\nMarc Roca\nSigned for £10m last summer, Roca has endured a mixed debut season at Leeds and has struggled with the physicality of the Premier League.\nThe former Bayern Munich midfielder definitely won’t want to play in the Championship and has been linked with a return to his native Spain.\nEstadio Deportivo suggest that Real Betis, who are currently sixth in La Liga, are set to reignite their interest in the 26-year-old after failing to sign him last summer.\nIf Leeds fail to beat the drop, they will be powerless to stop him from leaving as he reportedly has a relegation release clause in his contract.\nWeston McKennie\nLeeds saw off interest from Tottenham and plenty of other Premier League clubs to sign McKennie on loan from Juventus in January.\nHe arrived at Elland Road with a big reputation but has failed to live up to expectations and his performances have attracted a lot of criticism.\nWhile the loan deal reportedly includes a £30m buy option, that only gets activated if Leeds avoid relegation to the Championship.\nHe won’t be missed by the Elland Road faithful with a portion of them turning on McKennie during Sunday’s 4-1 home loss to Spurs.\nJack Harrison\nHarrison came close to a deadline day move to Leicester City in the January transfer window, only for the deal to collapse late on.\nHe recently put pen to paper on a new five-year contract with Leeds, but The Athletic claim that his deal now includes a release clause.\nAccording to The Sun, West Ham United are interested in Harrison and will offer him a swift return to the top flight if the Whites suffer relegation.\nLuis Sinisterra\nAfter starring for Eredivisie outfit Feyenoord in 2021/22, Sinisterra joined Leeds in a £21m deal last summer and was tasked with filling the void left by Raphinha’s departure.\nBut his debut season in England has been plagued by multiple injury problems, which have limited him to just 22 appearances in all competitions.\nThe Colombia international has still managed to showcase glimpses of his undoubted quality and has registered seven goals and one assist, at a rate of a direct goal involvement every 127.1 minutes.\nAC Milan are reportedly keen on the 23-year-old and Calciomercato claim he is “already in the sights of the top English clubs” ahead of the summer window.\nWilly Gnonto\nGnonto joined Leeds from Swiss side FC Zurich in the summer and has been one of the few bright sparks in a disappointing campaign.\nThe 19-year-old has registered four goals and four assists in all competitions, including a Paolo Di Canio-esque volley against Cardiff City in the FA Cup.\nWhile he has said that he is happy in west Yorkshire, that could change if Leeds go down and Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City are reportedly keeping an eye on his situation.\nA return to Italy is also possible for the former Inter Milan youngster, who is attracting interest from Juventus, AC Milan, Lazio, Fiorentina, Roma, Napoli, Atalanta and Sassuolo.\nWilfried Gnonto for Leeds after 26 seconds ☄️\n(via @EmiratesFACup) pic.twitter.com/XreSrldW8r\n— B/R Football (@brfootball) January 18, 2023\nRodrigo\nDespite the club’s struggles in 2022/23, Rodrigo has enjoyed his best individual campaign in a Leeds shirt.\nThe Spain international has netted 13 goals in 30 Premier League appearances and has reportedly informed Leeds he does not wish to play in the Championship.\nHe’s also the highest-paid player at Elland Road and it would be financially impossible to maintain his £100,000-a-week wages if the club got demoted to the second tier.\nAccording to reports in Spain, Aston Villa manager Unai Emery has asked the club to sign the 32-year-old, who has just 12 months remaining on his Leeds contract.",
