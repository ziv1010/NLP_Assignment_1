Players such as Toni Kroos, David Alaba, Arjen Robben and Xabi Alonso have represented both behemoths. Even current Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has spent time in the dugouts of both the Santiago Bernabeu and Allianz Arena.\nThe latest instalment of Bayern and Madrid's international rivalry takes place on Tuesday in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.\nHere are four key battles to watch out for.\nThe Ballon d'Or battle\nWith the Lionel Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo duopoly firmly in the rear-view mirror, the race for the Ballon d'Or could look far more interesting over the next few years.\nAs it stands, Madrid's Jude Bellingham and Bayern's Harry Kane are among the frontrunners for the 2024 award, both thriving at their new clubs following successful summer transfers.\nThe game is about goals, and these two scoring freaks have tallied a combined 63 at club level already this season.\nNeither has played in a Champions League semi-final before, however. Now is the time for them to step up.\nThe actual battle for Harry Kane to focus on\nAway from the narrative of his duel with Bellingham, Kane needs to worry about getting the better of Madrid centre-back Antonio Rudiger.\nAfter a largely underwhelming first year at the Bernabeu, Rudiger has come into his own this season, rediscovering the form that made Los Blancos sign him from Chelsea in the first place.\nErling Haaland got absolutely nothing out of the German in Manchester City's quarter-final defeat to Madrid, and Kane often found it difficult to come out on top against Rudiger during their days in the Premier League. That trend can't continue if Bayern are to advance.\nThe custody of Alphonso Davies\nFor much of the 2023/24 season, Madrid have been linked with a summer move for Bayern left-back Alphonso Davies, who is refusing to sign a new contract beyond the expiry of his current one in 2025.\nThere are now suggestions that Bayern's refusal to lower their valuation of Davies could scupper a deal, but what would really hurt the Canadian's chances of a transfer are poor performances under the intense spotlight of the Spanish media.\nDo you think the notorious Spanish press will take kindly to a Madrid target if he drops two stinking performances against them in the space of eight days? Definitely not. In a sense, Davies will be fighting for the better of himself and two clubs over the next week.\nA proper test for Joshua Kimmich, the right-back\nThe uber-talented and versatile Joshua Kimmich is currently enjoying a run of games at right-back for Bayern, but their absence from this stage of the Champions League for the last three years means he is now in for a tougher test than usual.\nMadrid have operated with a narrow 4-4-2 this season, which features winger Vinicius Junior starting in central areas and pulling out wide to the left wing. How will Kimmich fare with a threat that is as tough tactically as it is physically? If the Brazilian is given the appropriate room to feast, then he will roast the part-time right-back.",
