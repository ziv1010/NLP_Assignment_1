While the winger played against Brighton and Hove Albion before he left for AFCON, Salah’s future at Anfield is up in the air following his extraordinary outburst against Liverpool and manager Arne Slot.\nSources have told TEAMtalk’s transfer correspondent, Graeme Bailey, that Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG) do not plan to sell Mo Salah in the January transfer window.\nHowever, it would be remiss to think that Liverpool would not be looking at a contingency plan, especially as the defending Premier League champions were already on the hunt for a winger to succeed Salah in the long run.\nLiverpool plan ‘reduced offer for Rodrygo’\nRodrygo was a player that Liverpool looked at signing in the summer of 2025, and, according to Defensa Central, the Reds are still keen on him.\nThe Real Madrid-centric news outlet, which is often speculative, has reported that Liverpool are planning to make a ‘reduced offer for Rodrygo’ in the January transfer window.\nLiverpool are ready to ‘present a lower offer’ of ‘between €50 and 60million’ (up to £52.35m, $70.65m) for the Brazil international winger, noting that Madrid wanted at least €100m (£87.2m, $117.7m) for him in the summer of 2025.\nThe report has also noted Rodrygo’s recent return to form, with the 24-year-old Brazilian winger having ‘risen from the ashes in recent weeks’ like a phoenix.\nHowever, sources have told us that Madrid have no plans to sell Rodrygo in the January transfer window.\nGraeme Bailey reported on December 22 that Madrid have made it clear that neither Rodrygo nor Vinicius Junior will leave in the middle of the season.\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?

He was right.”\nWith Alexander Isak injured at the moment and speculation rife that Liverpool are looking for a replacement striker, there have been suggestions that Slot could raid Feyenoord for Ueda.\nHowever, according to 1908.nl, there is no such chance.\nThe report notes: ‘According to information from 1908.nl, Feyenoord have no reason to fear the Japanese player’s early departure.\n‘There is no contact with Arne Slot’s club, nor any indication of concrete interest. Therefore, these reports must be dismissed as myths.\n‘A transfer also seems highly unlikely, as the Eredivisie is no longer seen as a breeding ground from which players can make a direct step to the absolute top.\n‘Furthermore, Feyenoord are locked in the battle for second place, and thus Champions League football for next season, and believes it still desperately needs its top scorer.",
