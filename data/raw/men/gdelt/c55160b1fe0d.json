The 20-year-old winger has now established himself in the German club’s first team and is widely considered one of the best young English wingers in the game.\nThe England Under-21 international has been deployed as a left-winger this season and has scored 11 goals and provided four assists in 35 matches in all competitions.\nGittens made 34 appearances for Dortmund in the 2023/24 campaign, scoring two goals and providing five assists in the process.\nIn October 2024, Gittens became the youngest English player to score against Real Madrid in the Champions League aged 20 years and 75 days. The winger, who found the back of the net in the 34th minute at the Santiago Bernabeu, broke Alan Smith’s previous record when he scored for Leeds in 2001.\nGitten’s rise for Dortmund has not gone unnoticed at Man City, who are reportedly interested in bringing the winger back to the Etihad Stadium.\nDefensa Central has reported that Man City manager Guardiola has told his club’s bosses “to pay whatever they have to pay to sign” the English left-winger this summer.\nThe report has claimed that defending Spanish and European champions Madrid are also interested in Gittens, but the LaLiga club will not enter into a bidding war.\nLos Blancos already have an abundance of talent in attack, and there is no need for Carlo Ancelotti’s side to compete with other clubs and sign a 20-year-old this summer.\nREAD MORE ➡️ Free agents: The three best unattached players available in each position\nManchester City have to pay £70m for Jamie Gittens\nGittens may be only 20, but, according to TBR, Dortmund are not going to sell him on the cheap.\nIt has been reported that the Bundesliga club will demand £70million for the left-winger this summer.\nGittens himself is open to leaving Germany and returning to England, but the youngster will not push for an exit.\nArsenal are among the clubs who are keen on Gittens, with Tottenham, Chelsea and Aston Villa also impressed with the winger after following him.\nLatest Man City news: Diogo Costa interest, Florian Wirtz confidence\nEderson has been one of the best goalkeepers in the world for a while and has been key in Man City’s success under Guardiola.\nHowever, it seems that the defending Premier League champions are moving on from the Brazil international goalkeeper.\nA report has claimed that Man City are keen on adding Diogo Costa to their team for next season and beyond.\nThe FC Porto star is a very fine goalkeeper, and the Cityzens believe that he is good enough to be their new number one between the posts.\nMan City have also set their sights on Sverre Nypan, according to a report.\nThe Rosenborg midfielder was close to a move to Arsenal in the January transfer window, but he had a late change of heart.\nThe Norwegian youngster, though, is expected to move to a new club this summer, and Man City have now entered the race.\nWhile Arsenal are still keen on a deal for Nypan, it has been reported that Man City have promised him first-team football in order to convince him to move to the Etihad Stadium and snub a potential switch to the Emirates.\nMeanwhile, Man City are growing in confidence that they will be able to sign Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen.\nWirtz is one of the finest young attacking midfielders in Europe and is a star at Bayer.\nMan City are among the many top European clubs who have taken a shine to him and are ready to include James McAtee to sweeten the deal.",
