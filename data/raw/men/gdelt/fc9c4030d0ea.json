  "body_text": "We rounded off our Champions League group stage with a hard-earned draw away to PSV Eindhoven.\nTop spot in the group had already been assured in London two weeks ago, but Mikel Arteta’s much-changed side were determined to head into the knock out stages on the back of another strong result.\nEddie Nketiah scored our goal shortly before the interval, with a low guided finish from just inside the area, but PSV – who have got a 100 per cent record in the Dutch league after 15 games – struck back just after the restart.\nBoth sides had chances to win it - including Leandro Trossard at the very end - but we had to settle for a point from another testing European away day.\nBoth sides went into the game knowing that safe passage to the Round of 16 was already assured, so perhaps it wasn’t surprising that the game started at a sedate pace.\nThe best chance of the opening quarter of an hour fell to the hosts. Ricardo Pepi looked certain to score when the ball arrived at his feet in front of goal following a fast break. But Gabriel slid in to make a vital block, and deflect the ball over the bar.\nGabriel was one of only three players to keep his place from the side that faced Aston Villa at the weekend, along with William Saliba and Kai Havertz.\nIt was Havertz who had our first attempt at goal, heading wide from an in-swinging corner after beating his marker in the air.\nAt the other end Yorbe Vertessen came closer with his header, hitting the foot of the post. Johan Bakayoko was beginning to have an influence on the right wing, and he cut inside to unleash a 25-yard effort just wide.\nMohamed Elneny – making his first start for 11 months – also tried his luck from long range, but his effort clipped the post before rolling wide.\nThe hosts were always a threat on the break though. Pepi led another counter, but his shot was blocked by the retreating Saliba.\nLate in the half Nketiah put us ahead with a lovely finish. Cedric and the hard-working Reiss Nelson worked the ball well on the right before Nelson fed a low pass into Nketiah just inside the box. He shifted the ball onto his left foot, and drove home in off the post.\nIt was the striker’s first Champions League goal, and we kept up our record of scoring in the first-half of every game in Europe so far this season.\nOur lead was extinguished early in the second half though. Once again PSV broke forward with real pace and intent, and Vertessen finished the move with an inch perfect right-foot shot across Aaron Ramsdale in off the post.\nMikel Arteta responded by sending on Declan Rice, Ben White and Martin Odegaard. Rice slotted into central defence, alongside Gabriel.\nOnce again Nelson tried to take matters into his own hands, with a driving run that ended with a shot into the side netting.\nThe game was opening up and the lively Pepi once again went close, hitting the post after turning Rice in the box.\nJakub Kiwior had the ball in the net but the flag was immediately up for offside to rule out his header.\nTrossard nearly won it in the final minute, but his fierce strike was saved by Walter Benitez at close range, and Kiwior’s blazing shot over the bar was the final kick of the night.\nEuropean football is put to bed for a few months now. The draw for the Round of 16 takes place this Monday (December 18) at 11am, and we will be drawn against one of the runners-up from the other seven groups (not including Premier League teams).\nAs group winners, we will play the first leg away, returning to the Emirates for the second leg. The first leg will take place on February 13/14 or 20/21, with the second leg on March 5/6 or 12/13. A reminder that the final this year will be held at Wembley Stadium.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
