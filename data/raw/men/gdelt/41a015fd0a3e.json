We should apologise to the fans. We didn't show a good face and we could not match the performance of the Newcastle players,\" Lloris, who was substituted at halftime, told Sky Sports.\n\"We were late in all aspects of the game and we completely missed the first part of the game. The second half is a different story but it's really painful.\n\"It is not even about tactics, we just could not fight and we were late. It is difficult right now to assess the performances but there was a lack of pride.\"\nTottenham remains in fifth place with 53 points from 32 games but it is six behind third-placed Newcastle, who has a game in hand, and also six behind fourth-placed Manchester United, who has two games in hand.\nWith teams below them such as Liverpool and Brighton & Hove Albion also having games in hand, the question is not so much about the Champions League now for Spurs, but whether they will even hang on to a European spot.\n\"You can get punched once or twice but it was like we could not even react or bounce back,\" Lloris said.\n\"Newcastle deserve a lot of credit for starting the game at 100 miles per hour. They knew exactly what to do.\"\nTottenham resemble a club in disarray, having fired Antonio Conte and replaced him with interim coach Cristian Stellini and, on Friday, losing director of football Fabio Paratici after his appeal against a two-and-a-half-year ban for false accounting was rejected by Italy's highest sports court.\nThey also face a fight to keep Harry Kane, their record scorer, at the club but Lloris said there were no excuses.\n\"We cannot hide ourselves behind the club's problems, we are professionals but today there was too much lacked,\" he said.\n\"There was a differences in level between Newcastle and Tottenham. We have two very difficult games to bounce back with.\"\nTottenham hosts Manchester United at home on Thursday and faces Liverpool away next Sunday.\nMeanwhile, Newcastle manager Eddie Howe was delighted with the performance of his team on Sunday.\n\"It was an incredible start to the game,\" Howe told Sky Sports. \"We elevated our performance in that opening half an hour. You don't expect that but the quality of our finishing was lethal today.\"\nALSO READ:\nsaudi lawyer calls for cristiano ronaldo to be deported for 'indecent act' at al nassr game\nmahrez hat trick sends man city into fa cup final\npsg closes in on title as mbappe double sinks angers",
