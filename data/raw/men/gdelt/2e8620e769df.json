I said when I signed that I didn’t want this to be just a ‘stop-gap’ signing to keep us up – I wanted to be here for a long time.\n“So personally it feels even more of an achievement signing this one than it was actually signing here in the first place. I’m delighted and looking forward to the next couple of seasons.”\nNewcastle United head coach, Eddie Howe, said: “Dan is a leader on and off the pitch so we are delighted he has extended his stay with us.\n“He is a key part of our squad and has played a huge role in our progress since his arrival.\n“He knows exactly what it means to represent this great club and is hungry to succeed, and that can only help the team and the club going forward.”\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
