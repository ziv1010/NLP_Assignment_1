  "body_text": "Match Preview\nEverton head to the Capital for the first time since the end of January seeking to end a 30-year wait for victory at Stamford Bridge and their first away win of 2024.\nThe Toffees go into the Monday night game against Chelsea still sitting in 16th thanks to the fact that Nottingham Forest were held by Wolves and Luton were hammered 5-1 at Manchester City and they will know that anything they can get from this game would be a boost to their hopes of avoiding the drop this season.\nSo often a scene of painful defeat, this part of West London has also seen Everton pick up their share of creditable points down the years, not least the 3-3 draw under Roberto Martinez when they came as close as ever to beating Chelsea on their own patch for the first time since 1994, and the 1-1 and 2-2 ties on their last two visits.\nSean Dyche and his men would, no doubt, grab a point with both hands if offered it before kick-off, particularly in view of how poorly they have been playing of late, but if they can recapture the spirit, tenacity and attacking threat they showed against the likes of Tottenham before Christmas, they stand a chance of getting something against erratic opponents.\nMauricio Pochettino has struggled for much of the season to get a sufficient tune out of the expensively-assembled squad he inherited to keep them in the top half of the season but he has started to show in recent weeks that, at home at least, he is finding the right formula.\nChelsea's only away win of the calendar year so far might only have been against Crystal Palace and they were held last time out by Sheffield United at Bramall Lane but, at Stamford Bridge, they've beaten promotion-chasing Leeds and Leicester in the FA Cup and overcome Champions League hopefuls Newcastle and Manchester United, scoring seven goals in those two Premier League fixtures alone.\nThey were also held by ten-man Burnley a fortnight ago, however, which suggests an ongoing fallibility that, hopefully, an Everton side energised by their victory over the Clarets can exploit.\nThe Blues will have to deal with the in-form Cole Palmer, though, who has scored in each of the Londoners' last three home games, including a hat-trick against Man Utd. He didn't finish the draw against the Blades after being withdrawn with a quarter of an hour to go because of fatigue but he has been passed fit for Monday night, as has Malo Gusto.\nRaheem Sterling and Enzo Hernandez are doubts, however, due to illness, Ben Chilwell faces a late fitness test but Wesley Fofana, Romeo Lavia, Lesley Ugochukwu, Reece James, Christopher Nkunku and Levi Colwill are ruled out.\nDyche, though, is hoping to include Arnaut Danjuma in the squad for the first time since the end of January after he turned out for the Under-21s on Friday evening, while Idrissa Gueye and Amadou Onana will be available after missing the Burnley game.\nThe manager is hoping that the second points deduction handed down to them in the same season can add clarity to the Club's situation vis-a-vis the relegation battle and provide a catalyst in the same way last November's 10-point deduction eventually did.\n“I’ve spoken to the players and staff to remind them of the truth of the moment, which is to focus on the games in hand.\n“[The deduction] is unexpected in the sense we thought it had been dealt with but it obviously hasn't been, and [there is] time to possibly appeal, so the Club is looking into that but the last response was, 'what's done is done'.\n“The last time we got a knock everyone pulled together. The fans were terrific in a new reality and it rounded the wagons for us. Everyone said: ‘Hang on, the badge is more important than anything’ and I still feel the same. Myself, the players, the fans all pulling together and making sure we look after the club.\n“Front foot mentality is an important factor.”\nGueye was of a similar mind with comments he made this week, stressing that the Blues have what they need in their ranks to get out of trouble.\n“We need to get back to what we can do best and get wins on the board, always giving everything for the club,” the Senegal international said.\n“Yes, we fought to survive, but the idea of â€‹â€‹Everton being in anything other than the elite is unthinkable. We have quality and we have shown what we are capable of. You have to give everything, it’s as simple as that.\"\nKick-off: 8pm, Monday 15 April 2024\nReferee: Paul Tierney\nVAR: Michael Salisbury\nLast Time: Chelsea 2 - 2 Everton\nPredicted Line-up: Pickford, Coleman, Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Mykolenko, Gueye, Garner, Young, McNeil, Doucouré, Calvert-Lewin\nReader Comments (94)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Just by virtue of the amount of very expensive options they have at their disposal, as opposed to ours.\nOur players, if they haven't realised by now, should know we are in a very precarious position. With a chasing pack behind us snapping at our heels, we basically have to maximise our slender position in the table, and the games in hand we have.\nCOYB ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ‘\n2 Posted 14/04/2024 at 08:47:50\nI understand the need to defend and hope that we might sneak a goal but I loath the Pickford hoofball for Calvert-Lewin to scramble for, so I am hoping for something different from the manager.\nTo begin, I really do hope Ashley Young is not in the starting XI as it is difficult to see just what he contributes. For me, we just have to play our best 11 players, so that's 10 from your team, Lyndon, plus Onana. I realise this will mean James Garner moving out wide, but it has got to be worth a go.\n3 Posted 14/04/2024 at 09:01:40\nForced Everton changes may upset Chelsea's training-ground plan.\n4 Posted 14/04/2024 at 09:03:09\nNot my least favourite ground. That accolade goes to Crystal Palace.\nI know a few Chelsea supporters and as individuals and they are fine. But as a collective, they are arrogant and my least favourite set of supporters.\n3,000 Evertonians descending on Stamford Bridge tomorrow, most with long journeys and not getting home until the early hours. Stick together, Blues. We can take something from this one.\n5 Posted 14/04/2024 at 09:07:46\nIf Luton continue with an open game where they let in on average 2 or more goals a game, then Dyche may have got it right and letting in one goal a game by being ultra tight may be the right apprach until the summer when he can make adjustments so that the squad is better at finishing chances.\nI can't see if this squad flies forward in matches and leaving the door open to potentially an average of letting in 2 goals a game, this team getting 3 goals or more a game to win. Looks like a grind until the end of the season is correct.\n6 Posted 14/04/2024 at 09:27:11\nCan't start Young and must start Onana, Gana and Gueye.\n7 Posted 14/04/2024 at 09:35:37\nMind you, I have never seen one play without the other!\n8 Posted 14/04/2024 at 09:40:27\n9 Posted 14/04/2024 at 09:46:05\nAbsolutely dreadful at Newcastle and so â€˜sore' after that particular shift, he was then unable to grace us with his presence against Burnley.\n10 Posted 14/04/2024 at 10:09:01\nApparently they have checked with the Premier League, and it seems like they have exploited a loophole. I would suggest it's not a loophole but a massive chasm and to be able to sell it to yourself surely has to be against the rules.\n11 Posted 14/04/2024 at 10:10:19\nFor those travelling, there will be a gathering at the White Horse near Parson's Green station.\nYou can then go marching towards Stamford Bridge signing Mark Murphy's favourite song!!\n12 Posted 14/04/2024 at 10:13:24\nNot sure if Calvert-Lewin will make it, but hopefully he does and makes it 3 out of 3!\n13 Posted 14/04/2024 at 10:24:39\n14 Posted 14/04/2024 at 10:37:57\nI remember going there in my teenage years when they were a little club with a half-empty stadium and we often got a decent result\n15 Posted 14/04/2024 at 10:43:00\nTheir recent form is DWDWD so on that basis they're due a win. I'd be delighted with a point. As an aside, I'm also looking forward to watching Cole Palmer in the flesh â€“ the kid is a Rolls-Royce footballer.\nDespite them being a bit patchy, a draw would indeed be an excellent result for us.\n16 Posted 14/04/2024 at 10:57:39\nIt was Joe Royle's second game in charge and Paul Rideout scored the only goal from a lovely Anders Limpar cross.\nI was 13 years old, for fuck's sake!!\n17 Posted 14/04/2024 at 11:11:00\n18 Posted 14/04/2024 at 11:23:42\nForever. Spirit and now Bella Ciao, which will catch on.\nMy girl dog is called Bella. A sign?!!\n19 Posted 14/04/2024 at 11:26:14\nChelsea have had draws and wins in their recent games but no losses so I think that “one day eh!â€ will be tomorrow.\n20 Posted 14/04/2024 at 11:47:35\nTo think City found him surplus to requirement is almost mind-boggling. He could have come to us, along with Conor Gallagher. :-)\n21 Posted 14/04/2024 at 12:23:56\n22 Posted 14/04/2024 at 12:25:47\nHowever, given the boost of the weekend results so far, and given that Chelsea are not Man City, there is that chance for that one set-piece to get something good from this game as long as they are sound defensively.\nPalmer is a real talent but there are others to watch out for so Everton have to produce a good all-around performance.\n23 Posted 14/04/2024 at 12:39:37\nI've not got any confidence in the team nor the manager â€“ negative as feck â€“ and that ain't going to change anytime soon.\n24 Posted 14/04/2024 at 12:45:00\nA free hit, worth the gamble to go for a win would still be a game in hand of the teams around us. Be brave, Everton, puts all the pressure on the teams around us to close that 5-point gap if it comes off.\n25 Posted 14/04/2024 at 12:53:10\nWith Onana and Gueye both fit and Gomes showing some worth, if he does start with your suggested line-up then, barring miracles, he should be sacked immediately we lose.\n26 Posted 14/04/2024 at 13:01:04\n27 Posted 14/04/2024 at 13:08:57\nThey have shipped 52 goals this season. They are not very good at the back â€“ Chalobah has got a mistake in him.\nMykolenko and Branthwaite will have to be at their best because Madueke is a real threat â€“ he likes to cut in from the left.\nPickford\nColeman, Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Mykolenko\nGarner, Gueye, Gomes, McNeil\nDoucoure\nBeto\nUp the Blues.\n28 Posted 14/04/2024 at 13:32:59\nAnd if Dyche cannot get an away victory against a team that has invested over £700m more than us in their playing staff in the last three years then the guy is a fraud.\nYou're right, we really should be looking to sack the guy who has us out of the Bottom 3 with two games in hand and superior goal difference despite an annual relegation fight, an 8-point deduction and negative £70m investment in players in the last 3 years.\n29 Posted 14/04/2024 at 14:00:29\nPosters saying they have shipped 50-odd goals appear to be forgetting that we don't have a goal threat.\nMan for man, they have a lot more talent than we do, it'll be backs to the wall and I'll take a point now.\n30 Posted 14/04/2024 at 14:06:22\nAnd to think people despaired of Gordon Lee. His team was my intro, great days in retrospectâ€¦\n31 Posted 14/04/2024 at 14:58:43\nBut our record there at the Bridge is absolutely depressing; that said, keep it tight for 70 minutes and hopefully snatch a winnerâ€¦ Well, I can dream can't I?\nGotta end sometime hasn't it... hasn't it\n32 Posted 14/04/2024 at 14:59:52\nI saw that article, unbelievable if that's allowed by the Premier League, a loophole that you can sell 2 hotels to your own company?\nPickford\nColeman Tarkowski Branthwaite Mykolenko\nGueye Gomes Onana\nGarner Calvert-Lewin Danjuma\n33 Posted 14/04/2024 at 16:04:01\nI remember we battered them and had two goals disallowed or something and hit the post, I went back there the following August absolutely mental heatwave and they were selling Ruud Gullit wigs in stalls everywhere.\nHow have we allowed a record like that to fester though?\n30 years without Everton Football Club winning anywhere just can't be right surely?\n34 Posted 14/04/2024 at 16:19:30\n35 Posted 14/04/2024 at 16:28:48\nI never felt more like singing the bluesâ€¦\nWhen Everton win, and Liverpool loseâ€¦.\nUTFT!\n36 Posted 14/04/2024 at 17:16:29\nIf Clavert-Lewin's lucky goal v Burnley is the best we can manage, and if we can't win again for the next 7 games, I assume you will conclude that Mr Dyche was a victim of circumstances beyond his control.\n37 Posted 14/04/2024 at 18:53:14\n38 Posted 14/04/2024 at 19:33:52\nI would play Onana just behind Calvert-Lewin in the 'Doucoure role'\nCalvert-Lewin\nOnana\nMcNeil Gueye Gomes Garner\nMykolenko Branthwaite Tarkowski Patterson\nPickford\nSubs: Beto, Dobbin (does he have an injury? Why isn't he even on the bench recently?), Danjuma, Chermiti, Harrison, Doucoure, Coleman, Keane, Virginia\n39 Posted 14/04/2024 at 22:08:06\nI would love us to go for it but you know we'll go there with the plan to keep it tight and nick a draw. A point would be respectable but a win (gotta hope!) would put clear daylight between us and the drop zone, with still a game in hand, and would knock the stuffing out of the two below us.\nPalaces' surprise win means they're pretty much safe now, as too are Brentford â€” almost. For me, it's now just between the bottom 5.\nGames running out fast...\nPut a strong team out tomorrow and go for it, before the humdinger of fixtures next weekend.\n40 Posted 15/04/2024 at 00:34:08\nTherefore, looks like Bella Ciao maybe off the song sheet later.\n41 Posted 15/04/2024 at 02:39:23\nAlso, nice to see Man City back on top of the Premier League again. Just exactly where they belong. £££\n42 Posted 15/04/2024 at 02:55:48\nThis is a massive game where a win can put all the pressure on Luton and Forest!\n43 Posted 15/04/2024 at 04:27:03\nA point would be too good for these present times.\n44 Posted 15/04/2024 at 05:50:10\nPlease no Ashley Young. We can safely say Ben Godfrey won't play, now that Seamus is healthy. It would be great to see Danjuma, if for no other reason than that we otherwise have such little pace and creativity.\nIf there's one thing I do know, it's that the best away fans in the land will be there to give us a shot. COYB!\n45 Posted 15/04/2024 at 05:53:05\nNo Young, play Patterson.\n46 Posted 15/04/2024 at 06:01:03\nLet's hope he does it on the pitch tonight. He had a good outing against Burnley.\nAbsolutely, Jonathan. I'm sure you and others will be there around the globe at ridiculous hours cheering on the Blues as much as those travelling Blues!! Come \"home\" soon, Jonathan. A pleasure to meet you.\n47 Posted 15/04/2024 at 07:26:37\nPlease Mr. Dyche, no Young or Godfrey, we need Gana and Gomes but we don't need Onana.\nGot a good feeling about this one, for some reason. The Chavs are on a good run but are usually inconsistent and they don't do clean sheets.\nAll the best to the best of blues Rob H and everyone else, Mark, Danny, Neil, and the baldy from Bishop Stortford. Have a wonderful meet and greet and night.\n1-2\nCOYB\n48 Posted 15/04/2024 at 07:33:03\nI too am made up for Leverkusen. I went to watch them years ago.\nWatch this space. Bella Ciao will catch on so we'd best get on top of our Italiano!\n49 Posted 15/04/2024 at 08:26:56\nBella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao Bella ciao Bella ciao ciao ciao\nDominic, y Calvert-Lewin,\nAnd it's a goal for Everton!\nDominic, Dominic, Dominic, Dominic Dominic nic nic\nOh Dominic, y Calver-Lewin\nAnd it's a goal for Everton!!\nA presto ragazzi!\nSu le fucking caramelle!\n50 Posted 15/04/2024 at 08:44:59\nNot sure if this is a game we can win, but the weather's lousy so rock up and grind out another away point. Give the travelling blues something to cheer about. It's not a lucky ground for us (understatement of the yearâ€¦.) but we have a chance.\nThere will be wacky unexpected results to come, so anything out of this one is a bonus. It could be another miserable day off the pitch so UTFT on the pitch!\n51 Posted 15/04/2024 at 08:59:45\nThey say we haven't won at the Bridge for 30 years but, not being a stato, I think we have had a few draws there in that period. So why not another one? I would settle for that now, if it were in my power to do so.\nJonathan O @ 44, glad to have met you last week and also you have had a safe journey back, at least you witnessed a win. Take care, my friend!\n52 Posted 15/04/2024 at 09:24:57\nMark, your Italian skills are impressive. It beats my attempts to order a penne arribiata or spaghetti con vongole and doing my stupid English 'talk really slow' thing!!\nSee you later.\n53 Posted 15/04/2024 at 10:04:09\nNo need to ask these fans to cheer the Blues â€“ they will be doing just that, win, lose or draw. Wish I was there with them.\n54 Posted 15/04/2024 at 10:07:51\nI only know the song as the barman in my favourite\nboozer in Turkey plays it a lot.\nWhat a great song and hopefully unique to ourselves.\nSing up!\n55 Posted 15/04/2024 at 10:08:15\nI took your advice last week and visited the Anglican Cathedral.\nStunning! ðŸ‘\n56 Posted 15/04/2024 at 10:13:40\nI think though, that the shite have used it before us but then it will grind their gears if it takes off with us! UTFT\n57 Posted 15/04/2024 at 10:16:35\n58 Posted 15/04/2024 at 10:21:22\nBy the way, did you go up to the roof at the Anglican? Bit of a hike from top of second lift but the view is worth it.\n59 Posted 15/04/2024 at 10:33:06\nI had to read your post twice. I thought it read we are 'signing Bella Ciao' who is he, what position, and where did we get the money from (?) first reactions.\nI then realised it was 'singing', but where and how are the travelling Blues going to learn Italian in the short time before kick-off? :-)\n60 Posted 15/04/2024 at 10:38:47\nOr am I missing something...\n61 Posted 15/04/2024 at 10:46:12\nIsn't it an old Spanish revolutionary song?\n62 Posted 15/04/2024 at 10:53:47\nAnywa,y enough of that, on to tonight's game, until we cross that whitewash, let's save any thoughts and doom until we at least kick off.\nPalace and VIlla have shown you can attack these teams, instead of inviting them to dominate in your half. Eventually they will pick you off, so have a go at them, turn them around.\nA free hit to try and pick up 3 pointsâ€¦ Attack, Attack, Attack â€”It's been a while since I've heard that chant.\nWhatever happens tonight, and hopefully it's a point or three in the bag, we need to use our strength in set pieces against Forest. They are awful at defending set pieces, and draw cheap free kicks. We need to get at them, that's where we can win the game on Sunday. But for tonight, we have a fighting chance, if we keep our shape and have a go.\n63 Posted 15/04/2024 at 11:06:13\nI wonder if it was a dig at the Premier League?\nI agree on Grand Old Team, Brian. I've been saying it for a while. Get rid.\n64 Posted 15/04/2024 at 11:18:27\nAs part of Sky's commentary team.â€¦ Assuming he doesn't get injured putting on his microphone.\n65 Posted 15/04/2024 at 11:19:58\nI'll take as many scruffy games as it takes as long as we get over that line.\nGoing down is not an option.\n66 Posted 15/04/2024 at 11:24:30\nIf you do not sing the national anthem, the Palace will punish you.\n67 Posted 15/04/2024 at 11:36:19\nAlan (58) I think it was you who advised me to read the book â€˜Bloodlands' about the mass killings by Hitler and Stalin from the early 1930s until after the Second World War.\nThose slayed, 14 million were all in Europe with Jewish people singled out men, women and children along with other Nationalities, a lot were killed in peacetime.\nYou warned me it would be a hard time reading the book, it certainly was. Gruesome doesn't really describe it, very hard to understand how people (?) could be so inhumane to other human beings.\nThanks for putting me in touch with the book Alan I certainly learned plenty from it.\n68 Posted 15/04/2024 at 11:55:17\nNot only is he getting paid off us â€“ we are letting him “Work on the sideâ€.\nWe should have him selling the programmes outside the bleedin' ground.\nUnbelievable, this club of ours.\n69 Posted 15/04/2024 at 12:13:35\nI'll do it when I'm up for the Brentford game. If Danny O can manage the Newcastle steps, I'm sure I can climb the stairway to heaven â€“ even if it is the proddy version and they won't let me in!\n(Btw Danny â€“ are you sure you didn't take that lift at Newcastle??? Taps noseâ€¦.)\n70 Posted 15/04/2024 at 12:20:59\nMark I'm with your oldest on heightsâ€¦ view is great but I was stood well away from the edge. You'll get a great view of the new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock.\n71 Posted 15/04/2024 at 12:22:32\n72 Posted 15/04/2024 at 12:26:21\nIf they play Bella Ciao before the derby, we could get a big fuck off Italian flag passed down the park end, with \"Remember the 39\" on, it will put their Steua Bucharest flag to shame.\n73 Posted 15/04/2024 at 12:33:35\nOur record down there makes grim reading though if you think thats important. We are 7/2 to win, so the bookies don't think we are totally dead meat, I was expecting a bigger price.\nObviously a win would be great, but I suspect we might draw the game.\n74 Posted 15/04/2024 at 12:35:45\nYes, some good scores over the weekend and a boost for the Blues but still some serious games to come and they don't want to leave anything to chance.\nOffence still a problem and it really makes things tough but as a team they need to buckle down defensively for 90 minutes or more.\n75 Posted 15/04/2024 at 13:02:15\nIf you are looking for the perfect view of Bramley-Moore Dock, Mark, try the Gino D'Acampo Sky Bar 360 on Old Hall Street, mate. The booze might be a little bit expensive, and you might need to pay by card, but the lifts work perfectly and the views are absolutely stunning, mate!\n76 Posted 15/04/2024 at 13:02:16\nStill hoping that penny-drop moment, when everything clicks, is just round the corner. UTFT!\n77 Posted 15/04/2024 at 13:12:35\nAnyway - just getting ready to set out for tonight's game. As with Danny, this is far from my favourite ground. No entrance to the neighbouring pubs unless you have a Chelsea membership, even if you're not wearing colours and just want a piss!\nThe most ugly, unfriendly arrogant home fans outside Millwall and a stupid or complicit police presence who give minimum segregation and unmoving direction to avoid trouble between home and away fans.\nIf we win, I expect there will be trouble outside. But I bloody well hope we do win! UTFT!\n78 Posted 15/04/2024 at 13:45:06\nMy son's University Graduation was at the Anglican. Indeed a fine building amongst many in our city. St George's Hall and William Brown Street take some beating.\nHidden gems would be the Our Lady and Saint Nicholas Church near to the Pier Head.\nAlso if I can be biased, Speke Hall.\nThe city is only second to London in the number of listed buildings in the UK.\n79 Posted 15/04/2024 at 13:46:22\n80 Posted 15/04/2024 at 13:55:48\n70th minute Subs: Beto for Calvert-Lewin. Harrison for Young.\n81 Posted 15/04/2024 at 13:58:44\nDyche said in the press conference he'd got a tight hamstring but was expected to be fit for tonight. Personally, I think the Forest and Brentford games are more important so, if there is any doubt, I'd rather play safe and save him for those.\n82 Posted 15/04/2024 at 14:31:16\nWhen we win tonight, just walk back with the Everton fans to the coaches. I've yet to see any Chelsea fans come anywhere near that mob. Safe as houses with them.\n83 Posted 15/04/2024 at 14:39:56\nIt's really fucking windy in Herts where I am and also down Fulham way I assume so tonight could be a bit Sunday League if the wind keeps up.\nSee here: Link\n84 Posted 15/04/2024 at 14:41:22\n85 Posted 15/04/2024 at 14:50:46\nDyche will pick the team. The travelling Blues will get behind whoever is chosen. The players won't hear the rest of us.\nOf course it's a difficult game, but we have to see it as an opportunity too.\n86 Posted 15/04/2024 at 14:52:51\nI'll take my chances with the yuppiegans mate! UTFT\n87 Posted 15/04/2024 at 14:55:42\nThe great day starts now!! UTfT\n88 Posted 15/04/2024 at 15:05:21\nFined for tragedy chanting on something that never happened.\n89 Posted 15/04/2024 at 16:01:37\n90 Posted 15/04/2024 at 16:04:49\nStop one for pre meds!\nSat next to a load of Dutch toffees.\nFunny lot the Dutchâ€¦\nUTFmultilingualT\n91 Posted 15/04/2024 at 18:01:07\nWould love all 3 points. Dyche is too scared to be bold.\nA point would be a great result given our squad and horrendous fortune.\n92 Posted 15/04/2024 at 18:01:25\n2-1 to the Chavs.\n93 Posted 15/04/2024 at 18:38:18\n94 Posted 15/04/2024 at 20:54:35\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
