Lauren James - Chelsea & England\nThe World Cup was a funny time for Lauren James given she was arguably England's best player, and yet damaged her reputation in some people's eyes. Her silly red card threw things into jeopardy, but she also scored some wonderful goals and showed she'll be a star for a long time.\nShe was also an important part of Chelsea's successes domestically last season as she scored 11 goals and got eight assists, figures she will almost certainly build on this season.\n4. Sam Kerr - Chelsea & Australia\nThe World Cup did not actually go the way that Sam Kerr would have envisaged as she missed most of it with an injury and Australia were beaten in the semi-final by England. That being said, she still scored a wonder goal against the English to leave her mark.\nIt was her Chelsea form that gave her a chance of winning this award. Her team won the FA Cup and the WSL and she was a vital part of it, scoring 12 league goals and six FA Cup goals. For club and country, she got 32 goals and seven assists and whilst not 100% of those are in the timeframe for the award, she has clearly been on fire.\n3. Jennifer Hermoso - Pachucha & Spain\nWith a prolific record for Mexican club Pachuca on top of her World Cup performances that were crucial to Spain's triumph, Hermoso is easily one of the favourites to scoop FIFA's top individual prize.\nShe became the major news story in the wake of the World Cup due to Luis Rubiales' conduct after the final, which cruelly overshadowed what she and the team had done on the pitch. The 33-year-old started seven games, grabbed three goals and also provided two assists. She was also a leader throughout and it would be great to see her win this award.\n2. Mapi Leon - Barcelona\nIt feels inevitable that a Spanish Barcelona player is going to win this year, simply because they have won everything there is to win. But Mapi Leon was not actually with the Spain squad in Australia and New Zealand as she continued to take a stand against now fired head coach Jorge Vilda and the national team setup by refusing to play in the World Cup.\nHer Barcelona form alone may be enough though, as Leon was a remarkably reliable player for her team throughout last season and she brought a calmness to the whole operation. She also chipped in with a very healthy five goals across Liga F and the UWCL.\n1. Aitana Bonmati - Barcelona & Spain\nThere are two pretty simple reasons why Aitana Bonmati could win the Best FIFA Women's Player award. She was a key part of Spain winning the World Cup, winning the tournament's Golde Ball, and has already collected the UEFA Women's Player of the Year award for the 2022/23 season as well.\nJust like Jenni Hermoso, she started seven games and got three goals with two assists at the World Cup. Her pace and dribbling are a sight to behold and many teams have been unable to deal with her quality. Given that she too could have missed the tournament over the problems surrounding the team, Spanish and neutral fans alike are delighted that she was there.",
