Nobody can say what her ceiling is.\"\nWhile Paralluelo spoke to the media after being named player of the match against Sweden, Putellas walked past reporters without a word.\nThat has become customary for her during the tournament, as the 29-year-old has stayed firmly out of the limelight, in contrast to the radiant figure who appeared before the world on stage at so many recent award ceremonies.\nVilda said during the tournament that he had a squad of \"23 Ballons d'Or\" after it was put to him that Aitana Bonmati could succeed her Barcelona teammate Putellas to win that particular prize this year.\nShe has enjoyed a fine World Cup on the back of being named the best player in the Champions League as her club lifted that trophy despite playing most of the campaign without Putellas.\n'Amazing spirit'\nVilda will now have to decide whether Putellas starts Sunday's final, but there are others that the Spain coach simply cannot do without.\nJennifer Hermoso has made a precious contribution either in attack, or in midfield when Putellas has not started.\nAnd Abelleira of Real Madrid has surely been the best holding midfielder in the tournament.\n\"The spirit in this team is amazing,\" said Abelleira, with Spain having overcome off-field turbulence in the months before the World Cup.\nOf 15 rebels who said last year they no longer wanted to be selected in a protest against the Spanish federation and Vilda, only three returned for the tournament, including Bonmati.\nPutellas did not join the boycott because she was injured at the time, although she did back the complaints and reportedly acted as a mediator between the players and the federation.\n\"We have all come together to achieve our objective and it is just a brilliant experience,\" added Abelleira.\n\"We have grown so much and now we can start talking about being in the final.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
