But, as most Liverpool fans would know, big mid-week results don’t always portend strong performances in the Premier League. And with Liverpool’s injury crisis still in full bloom, any fans dreading a match-up with Eddie Howe’s side would be forgiven their doubt over the Reds. What transpired on Saturday, though, is at least a respite from the seemingly listless performances that have plagued the Reds this season.\nDigging Deeper Into Liverpool’s 4-1 Victory Over Newcastle\nLiverpool notch 4 impressive goals and, for the moment, are in a good spot of form after a comprehensive win.\nLet’s take a closer look, then, into Liverpool’s big day at Anfield as they swept aside Newcastle 4 goals to 1.\nWinners and Losers\nWinners\nThe New Boys\nWe’ll go a little deeper on both Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz as both budding stars absolutely smashed it today. But it must be said that Milos Kerkez had another terrific outing today, including notching an assist on the long ball out to Ekitike for what would become the eventual winner. Kerkez’s improvement has flown a bit under the radar over recent weeks but the left-back has really grown into the Liverpool side since December. And since I’m not counting on anything from Alexander Isak until next season given the new year, it feels pretty safe to say that the new signings have all more or less worked out.\nHugo Ekitike\nEkitike has been so good and, as was on display in this match, incredibly ruthless that he warrants his own section apart from the others. Two goals on the day with one of those finishes being so sublime that I know I’m going to be thinking of it for some time. In real time, I thought Hugo had pushed himself too far wide to make any kind of effort on goal but it turns out he put himself into a position to score with a finish that only he could have put through. Absolutely gorgeous and clearly took Newcastle keeper Nick Pope by surprise.\nRyan Gravenberch\nYung Gravy as he’s known in my household put in the type of necessary if understated performance that has become a hallmark since he’s found his way into Liverpool’s midfield. Composed, elegant, and sturdy, the midfield general continues to grow by leaps and bounds as a Premier League midfielder. Because his contributions - control of both the defensive and offensive tempo - doesn’t always show up on the scoresheet, he doesn’t always get credit. Today, though, he was pretty spectacular as he more or less led a midfield that took away the middle of the pitch from Newcastle for most of the match.\nDissecting the Narrative\nThis was a big day for narrative: Liverpool’s inconsistency after strong performances in mid-week tournaments, questions around whether Liverpool could find their way back to more attractive football without leaving themselves completely wide open, the form of Liverpool’s defenders particularly Ibrahima Konate, and the questions over Liverpool’s spending spree over the summer vis-a-vis the return from those offensive superstars that were purchased.\nToday’s match featured counters to all four narrative points, with the latter two in particular coming to stark relief. Ibou’s performance in particular was quite the sparkler as he and the entire defense once more looked relatively solid with marked improvements in terms of set-pieces/long-throws. Yes, Newcastle doesn’t look like they’ve got a good long-throw on their team - Hall took at least one and since it didn’t event get into the box, I think they went away from it. But at one point in the first half, Newcastle held a 5-nil advantage in terms of corners. And on the other end of the pitch, Konate’s goal felt like the cherry on top of a massive performance in the midst of mourning the passing of his father.\nFor Florian Wirtz, it was another match where the wunderkind displayed the quality that made him one of the most sought after young players in all of world football. What stood out most to me, though, was what felt like a stout and physical performance where he spent time being marked by Newcastle’s Sandro Tonali. Multiple times during the match, Wirtz managed to hold off a defensive challenge from Tonali and kept his feet while in tight spaces. It is yet one more feather in the cap for the young German creator, but it was clear that the entire team’s offense really clicked most when the ball ran through him in order to find space for the final pass. He is such a special player and I think Liverpool fans can and should thank their lucky stars that the post-Klopp Era has two superstars (and potentially a third in Isak) whose quality is so undeniable and who already have a great understanding with each other. The future is bright.\nAll that said, there’s still some major questions for the brass and coach to answer: transition planning in the center of defense, more depth generally, and questions on who will take up the mantle out on the wing whenever Mo Salah does call time on his Liverpool career. All big things that need to be sorted over the next year or so. At the very least, between Wirtz and Ekitike, Liverpool look like they’ve found the answer for replacing the output of Sadio and Mane and Roberto Firmino. No small feat.\nWhat Happens Next\nLiverpool get 8 days before their next match, which will be a prelude to the Super Bowl as the Reds host Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City on Sunday. This season has been quite turbulent for nearly every team, including City, with league’s most expensive side falling victim to dropped points against low and mid-table sides. They’ve not done it as often as Liverpool, but it is saying something that the Reds only find themselves 7 points back of City in the table.\nIt hasn’t been a great title defense for Arne Slot’s side, but it’s also clear that the sides are a little more competitive across the league this season than in other years. It doesn’t wave away the concern and disappointment from the results not going our way, but it is a bit of a balancing thing for me to reflect on other teams at the top dropping points against the likes of Leeds, Burnley, and Crystal Palace. It’s maybe a faint bit of comfort, but it’s there.\nHere’s hoping we get more performances like today’s as we head towards the business end of the season.",
