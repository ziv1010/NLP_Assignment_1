But who are they?\nBoth goalkeepers Ederson and Stefan Ortega have come under fire in recent weeks, with the former arguably to blame for Jude Bellingham's late winner at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday in the UEFA Champions League.\nRodri's horrendous ACL injury has left a gaping hole in midfield but Gallagher believes it is the boys of yesteryear who should be allowed to seek pastures new come the summer months.\n\"I'd of thought so,\" said Gallagher when asked if he expects to see plenty of players leave in the summer on talkSPORT. \"We are seeing the last of them and we are seeing Bernardo [Silva] come to the end, we are seeing KDB [Kevin De Bruyne] come to the end.\n\"Kyle [Walker] has already gone, [Ilkay] Gundogan wasn't supposed to play all these games and you could make a case for four, five six, players going out and a new batch coming in. This is it, this is football.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\n\"We had a stable team and if you think about the four titles we won in a row, we hardly bought any of those players in between, it was a stable squad and it acted like a machine.\n\"It's built on shifting sands at the minute and new players have come in and they will take time to settle,\" added Gallagher. \"The lad Nico Gonzalez looked alright, as alright as you can look against Leyton Orient for 20 minutes till he went off! The other two lads also look alright.\"\nIn FourFourTwo's opinion, Gallagher is right, Guardiola will likely say goodbye to the likes of Walker and De Bruyne, with Gundogan's future up in the air too.\nCity have enjoyed wholesale success for close to a decade now and they can have no qualms about allowing their senior players perhaps one last chance to earn a lucrative contract elsewhere.\nMatthew Holt writes freelance for FourFourTwo, amongst others, and boasts previous experience at GOAL and SPORTBible.
