So obviously none of us saw this coming. Michael is a very clever person and he’ll command respect from the dressing room.”\nAsked whether he would join Carrick’s staff, if asked, Rooney laughed. “Of course I would! I think it’s a no-brainer if that’s the situation.\n“I think what the club needs is people around the place, whether Michael goes in, whether Fletch (Darren Fletcher), John O’Shea, myself, you need people around who know the football club, (people like) Roy Keane…\n“Having people who know the club, who care for the club, people who understand what it takes to be a Manchester United player. I think that’s where the club needs to be.\n“We spoke earlier in this season about how it’s lost that identity, that family feel. I think it’s a great opportunity to bring the spirit of Manchester United back into the club.”\nRuben Amorim was sacked as United boss on January 5th, a day after making pointed comments in a post-match press conference at Leeds, to bring to an end a 14-month reign in which United slumped to a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.\nFormer United and Scotland midfielder Darren Fletcher took charge of the team on a temporary basis, but saw his side held to a 2-2 draw at Burnley last Wednesday night before they were knocked out of the FA Cup in a 2-1 home defeat to Brighton on Sunday.\nUnited’s next match is at home to rivals Manchester City on Saturday. Players had two pre-planned days off on Monday and Tuesday before reporting back to Carrington on Wednesday.\nUnited also held talks with Solskjaer, who was previously in charge from December 2018 to November 2021, having initially been named as caretaker following Mourinho’s exit before taking the job on a permanent basis.\nThe Norwegian earned a second-placed finish in the Premier League and guided the club to the Europa League final in the 2020-21 campaign, but was dismissed after a poor start the following season.",
