  "body_text": "Welcome to Week 8 of our staff column collecting news, insights, and highlights from around Major League Soccer. Let’s dive in.\nIt’s not the league’s most historic or deep-rooted rivalry, but El Trafico continues to prove itself as its most entertaining.\nDespite the derby’s reputation as an equalizer regardless of form, LA Galaxy’s off-the-field issues threatened to take the game out of the home team’s hands before it started.\nAdvertisement\nHad someone parachuted into Dignity Health Sports Park without any knowledge of MLS or LA’s soccer teams and been asked to identify the home side, they may have said LAFC. Against the backdrop of Galaxy’s off-the-field issues and poor start to the MLS season, people from die-hard supporters to casual fans are choosing to stay away. As a result, LAFC faithful populated large swathes of Galaxy’s home stadium, painting what should be an intimidating derby day environment of blue, yellow and white with a noticeable blend of black and gold.\nThis is elite support. @LAFC pic.twitter.com/m0sbbQNrgj\n— Maximiliano Bretos (@MaxBretosSports) April 16, 2023\nIn the rivalry’s short history, there had never been a time when the Galaxy, the league’s most successful club, felt so far away from LAFC. Steve Cherundolo’s side is in the semifinal of the CONCACAF Champions League, and an unbeaten start to their MLS season only strengthens the belief that 2023 could be a historic year for the reigning MLS Cup and Supporters’ Shield winners.\nStill, despite Galaxy’s lack of success during the Chris Klein era coinciding with LAFC’s birth and subsequent success, Galaxy always seemed to turn up for the occasion with seven wins compared to LAFC’s six across 18 matches.\nThe first El Trafico of the season marked Galaxy’s third home game of 2023. They are winless and without their most devoted fans, who continue to leave seats empty in protest over Klein’s position of club president.\nIn an email to season ticket holders this week, Klein said, “If we fall short of our goals this year, I will step aside as the President of the club that I so dearly love. This was my commitment to Dan Beckerman and AEG (the club’s ownership group) when I agreed to my extension, and I stand behind that promise.”\nOutside of “advancing in the playoffs in 2023,” it is unclear what the “goals” for the season entail. But a winless start, with just three goals across six games, undoubtedly falls far below expectations for a club with winning heritage and a demanding fanbase — whose newest frustrated display was a banner reading “#KleinOut #KirovskiOut” flown over the stadium in the fourth minute.\nSomeone rented a plane to demonstrate against Chris Klein and Jovan Kirovski. #LAGalaxy fans have asked for president Klein to step down all season. pic.twitter.com/VJRRGHtTT2\n— Manuel Veth (@ManuelVeth) April 16, 2023\nStill on the field, Galaxy turned up for the occasion again on Sunday, playing their part in a 3-2 “great for the neutral” LAFC win.\nAdvertisement\nThroughout their opening six matches, Galaxy has struggled to turn control of possession into meaningful goalscoring opportunities, often losing the ball after a string of passes that lack penetration and being hit in transition — which was the case for Houston Dynamo’s third goal last week. On Sunday, Galaxy continued to be their worst enemy, gifting LAFC two golden opportunities after sloppy play near their box, which Vela converted. Defender Ryan Hollingshead seemed to put the game beyond doubt in the 70th minute with a header from a corner, and the noise from the LAFC supporters made Galaxy’s home sound more like BMO Stadium.\nBut in the view of head coach Greg Vanney, his side could leave the match with their heads held high after a battling performance against the title favorites. Galaxy again led their opponents in possession, claiming 68% of the ball and creating several promising goalscoring opportunities.\n“There are ways to lose,” said Javier “Chicharito” Hernandez, Galaxy’s captain. “The way we lost today is a way I’m very proud of. I would prefer to lose like this for 10 more games than in the way that we lost to Houston or against other teams.\n“We dominated the best team in the league, but we were the ones who gave away the goals. We gave them something that they didn’t give us. We can be the best team in MLS, but we need to grow more mentally and emotionally.”\nThough LAFC created several chances in transition that could have killed the game off earlier, a late rally inspired by Riqui Puig left Galaxy fans with cautious optimism regarding the club’s future on the field.\nIn the loss, Puig created the most chances (4), completed the most dribbles (8), completed the most passes (83), won the most duels (9) in the match and hit the woodwork once. He also created an excellent one-on-one opportunity for Chicharito, which the former Mexico international could not convert from inside the box. For Vanney, it was the 23-year-old’s best performance of the season.\nAdvertisement\n“I think when we get our spacing right and when we get the ball moving quickly, Riqui has the capacity to pick up the ball on the move and get by almost anyone,” said Vanney. “It’s incredible how he accelerates when he has the ball – he’s faster with it than without it.”\nDespite this, Galaxy lost at home to LAFC for the first time in club history, and three points from seven matches make for difficult reading. Meanwhile, their noisy neighbors continue to march towards domestic and continental success and find themselves far out of reach of the club who provided the MLS success blueprint for a generation.\n—Elias Burke\nNew York Red Bulls fans walk out in boycott\nAttendance at Red Bull Arena in New Jersey has been an ongoing issue, but on Saturday night the clusters of empty seats were part of an intentional boycott by the club’s fans. Red Bulls supporters group Empire SC organized a walkout of the stadium after the opening whistle of New York’s match against the Houston Dynamo.\nThe protest was in response to MLS’ six-game ban of Red Bull forward Dante Vanzeir. The 25-year-old Belgian designated player admitted to using a racial slur against the San Jose Earthquakes on April 8.\nAccording to a league statement, Vanzeir also received an undisclosed fine and will be required to participate in additional “league-mandated training and education sessions” and a restorative practices program. Vanzeir’s ban was widely criticized as too lenient in the context of MLS’ zero-tolerance policy for such offenses. The ban is, however, the most severe of its kind in MLS history.\nThe South Ward leaving Red Bull Arena following the kickoff whistle.

In a statement via Twitter, the supporters’ group asked that Vanzeir and Red Bull manager Gerhard Struber be “justly punished” for their roles in the incident from a week ago. The statement asked fans to boycott the stadium’s concession and merchandise stands and to donate to the Black Players for Change organization.\nAdvertisement\nStruber ignored calls to remove Vanzeir from the match against San Jose. On Thursday, the Austrian manager told reporters that, in hindsight, he would have acted differently.\n“The duration of the decision, in the end, was too long. Right now I could say very clearly … I must bring Dante out immediately,” Struber said.\nEmpire SC’s statement asked for Red Bulls sporting director Jochen Schneider to fire Struber. Chants of “We want Struber out” were heard before Saturday’s kickoff. Struber was asked about those calls for his dismissal after the match.\n“This was not a good feeling. This was a painful feeling today for me,” Struber said during his post-game press conference. “It was the first time that I realized the situation was like that, but at the same time, I have respect for the opinions and the feelings of our supporters.”\nStruber said that he has apologized to the club’s supporters’ groups and stressed that overcoming this moment will take time.\nHere's a shot of the Red Bulls supporters' section tonight after the joint statement from supporters in protest. Very empty, as they promised. https://t.co/Hb2rspn0zD pic.twitter.com/pn0mHqPjjC\n— Tom Bogert (@tombogert) April 16, 2023\nThe Red Bulls earned a last-gasp equalizer against the Dynamo. The Red Bulls have one win after eight matches and have scored just six goals, conceding seven.\n— Felipe Cárdenas\nAsprilla’s bicycle leads Timbers turnaround against Sounders\nEl Trafico on Sunday was highly entertaining, as usual, but Portland Timbers vs. Seattle Sounders on Saturday night certainly delivered the goods, as well. The match started slow and tactical until Raul Ruidiaz scored in the 58th minute to silence the home crowd in Portland. But bedlam ensued when Timbers forward Dairon Asprilla equalized with a cunning bicycle kick.\nDairon Asprilla brought out the bicycle. 🚲 pic.twitter.com/gXyPBl62Aj\n— Major League Soccer (@MLS) April 16, 2023\nAsprilla’s goal in the 71st minute left Seattle shell shocked and the Timbers pounced. Portland would score four goals in 18 minutes to trounce their bitter rivals 4-1. But let’s focus on Asprilla’s worldie. All bicycle kicks are difficult to execute. A player must mix timing, precision and acrobatics in one effortless movement. Asprilla did all of that, but his version of the bicycle was more difficult because of where Santiago Moreno’s service originated.\nAdvertisement\nMoreno’s pass didn’t come from a wide area. Instead, the Colombian playmaker curled a ball into the box from inside a half-space. So, as you can see in the image below, Asprilla was just beginning to make an attacking run. And because of how Moreno was set up to strike the ball, Asprilla and teammate Nathan Fogaca were expecting to run onto the ball.\nThe yellow arrow shows where Asprilla and Fogaca likely expected the ball to be played. The green arrow is where Moreno’s ball ended up going. I think Moreno was trying to go far post to Cristhian Paredes, who had his arm raised and was unmarked as he stormed the box, but Moreno’s ball didn’t get there.\nIt fell to Asprilla, who acted quickly enough to stop his run and adjust his body. He had to do it quickly and slightly alter the classic bicycle kick motion. The low trajectory of the ball didn’t allow Asprilla much time to elevate. He struck the ball with this strong leg, and that swung his weaker leg forward.\nTypically, the weak leg is used to propel a player’s body into the air and initiate what looks like a cyclist pedaling backward, hence the name. Here’s an example. But in Asprilla’s case, he did what he had to do. The Colombian striker deserves a ton of credit for how he handled a difficult ball. Goal of the week. But it shouldn’t come as a surprise that he was able to execute this in a match. After all, he did similar in training earlier this month.\nView this post on Instagram\n— Cárdenas\nStruggling Kansas City\nWhen the Kansas City Wizards rebranded as Sporting Kansas City ahead of 2011, it ended up coinciding with a change in the club’s fate. After years of floundering results and making the playoffs just twice in the previous six seasons, Kansas City became one of MLS’ model clubs. Over the next eight seasons, Sporting never missed the postseason. From 2011 to 2018, they topped their conference regular season title three times, won the U.S. Open Cup on three occasions, and beat Real Salt Lake in the now-classic 2013 MLS Cup. They did it with a clear identity under head coach Peter Vermes, a core of dependable veteran mainstays and a growing influx of homegrown talent.\nBy comparison, the team’s last 42 games have felt more Wizardly woeful than Sporting strong. Saturday brought the latest frustration, a 3-0 defeat against a resurgent San Jose side that sits fifth in the West. Since the start of 2022, Sporting has earned just 43 points, with a goal differential of -21. After finishing 23rd among MLS’s 28 teams last year, the club is currently the league’s second-worst side, only topping CF Montréal (who have a game in hand) on goal differential. Sporting has scored just two goals in their first eight matches this season.\n2 – Sporting Kansas City's 2 goals through 8 matches are the fewest at this stage of a season in MLS history. No team had scored fewer than 4 times at this stage of a season before. Drought. pic.twitter.com/6GTrPZU4y4\n— OptaJack⚽️ (@OptaJack) April 16, 2023\nWhen tracking their rolling expected goals difference, it isn’t as if Sporting has looked bad over the relatively more turbulent past five years. Expected goals help measure the number and quality of chances that a team both generates and concedes. A positive xG differential suggests a team that creates more and/or better scoring chances than their opponents, using historical data to assess each shot based on its assist type, shot angle and distance from goal, whether it was kicked or headed, and other criteria.\nFrom the start of 2019 to the midpoint of 2021, Kansas City was seldom outplayed according to the underlying numbers. Over the past 20-odd months, however, they’ve struggled to keep pace with the opposition.\nAdvertisement\nNow in his 14th full season as manager, Vermes was very brief in speaking with the media after the match on Satuday. The coach took just three questions before joining his side on the solemn trek home. The first asked for his thoughts on how the team fared before a 38th minute red card to center back Robert Castellanos on a challenge in the box (“I thought we were pretty good actually. I am not even sure it’s a penalty. Red card? No chance.”). The second focused on what came next: a penalty kick to extend the deficit to 2-0 and playing a full second half down a man (“Again when you’re playing a man down, it’s never an easy situation especially when they went up 2-0 at that point. But we defended well and we tried our chances to counter quite a few times. I know 100% there’s a penalty on Daniel (Salloi) that doesn’t get called. I’m shocked.”).\nJEREMY EBOBISSE WITH THE TOUCH.\nSweet sweet magic.✨ pic.twitter.com/B3ioGxTplW\n— San Jose Earthquakes (@SJEarthquakes) April 16, 2023\nThe clincher, however, asked how his team could turn things around as the season nears its second quarter. Without penalty kick decisions to assess in this context, Vermes backed his players to stop the rot.\n“I think the guys had a good mindset going into the game,” Vermes said. “I really do. Obviously, when you’re in a situation, you doubt yourself a little bit. I thought the mindset was actually really good. Right now, some things just aren’t going our way. We’re in the game. We’re playing away from home obviously, but then getting the red card changed things. I do know this. The guys didn’t walk into the game feeling sorry for themselves and that’s a good thing. We have got to try to keep that mentality. You can turn things around, and I believe that these guys can.”\nLast season, the underwhelming results were somewhat predictable. Kansas City lost record-signing striker Alan Pulido to a knee injury in January, while fellow designated player Gadi Kinda was also shut down for the season before playing a single minute with a knee injury. Seemingly, then, having both key attackers return in 2023 should have been a reason for optimism. Of course, season-ending injuries are seldom a cinch to recover from; Pulido has yet to score in 132 minutes of play, while Kinda has yet to make his season debut. The third designated player, 33-year-old Johnny Russell, has also failed to score a goal or contribute an assist in 250 minutes.\nAs a team that rosters three true designated players (neither qualifying as U-22 initiative signings, nor as DPs who can be bought down by TAM), Sporting could hope to have its DPs play a maximum of 27.27% of their minutes or 270 of a possible 990 minutes per match. The club has had increased output from its homegrown players as well, most prominently former midfielder Gianluca Busio, attacker Dániel Sallói and goalkeeper John Pulskamp. As such, a team would hope that the rise in homegrown minutes would allow them to prioritize spreading more of the salary budget across the upper end of the roster as the squad numbers are more thriftily filled…\nInstead, the rise in homegrown productivity has not been met by sustained involvement from the team’s highest earners. Since the 2018 season, their designated players have contributed fewer minutes year-over-year; non-DPs and non-homegrowns have had their minute share go from 69.7% in 2021 (when the club finished 3rd in the West) to 77% in the young season to date.\nAt its best, Vermes’ team was lauded for a few hallmark traits. Alongside the balanced approach to roster building and consistency in tactics and personnel compared to many MLS peers, Sporting was a difficult team to break down. Before counter-pressing was all the rage following the rise of Jürgen Klopp, Vermes was proactive in having players lead the defensive press from the front. Over the last half-decade, however, his team has allowed more passes before making a defensive action with each passing season.\nIn short, the team is simultaneously allowing its opponents both a higher comparative sum of chances taken and a less stingy press to work through in build-up. Beyond getting more from their three designated players, the path back to contention is hard to chart aside from simply saying the team needs to play better. After U.S. Soccer contacted Vermes regarding their vacant sporting director position, he instead signed an extension with Sporting through the 2028 season. It complicates the potential to turn the page, as the Earthquakes have by bringing in Luchi Gonzalez to change how the club is perceived with its now-burgeoning youth pipeline.\nAdvertisement\nThe team needs to score more than 0.25 goals per game — that much is obvious. But with its tactician and chief roster builder locked into a long-term deal, it isn’t as simple as suggesting a change in regime. If Kansas City is going to be a force in the West this year, or even a competitive side at minimum, it’ll have to come from an improvement among the players already in the fold.\n— Jeff Rueter\nLewis O’Brien gets D.C. a win\nIn Lewis O’Brien, D.C. United has a gem.\nWhen Nottingham Forest signed him and former Huddersfield Town teammate Harry Toffolo for a combined £10 million ($12.4m) in July 2022, newly promoted Forest was signing one of the Championship’s best midfielders from the previous season, and someone who starred in the play-off final against his new side two months before.\nHowever, a slew of summer and winter additions meant O’Brien was not given an extended time to settle into the side and was out of favor by January when Forest allowed him to seek a loan move, preferring new signings Jonjo Shelvey from Newcastle United and Gustavo Scarpa and Danilo from Palmeiras. He initially was close to joining West Bromwich Albion, but after the proposed move broke down, he looked set to sign for Blackburn Rovers on deadline day, but the paperwork was submitted after the 11 p.m. deadline, and the English Football League rejected the loan transfer.\nBut as one door shuts, another opens. At D.C. United, O’Brien has been handed an opportunity to play consistent football once again before his expected return to the Championship or Premier League ahead of the start of the 2023-24 season. In last week’s 2-0 defeat to the Columbus Crew, O’Brien showed glimpses of the player who was among the Championship’s best a year ago, creating three chances from central midfield.\nAnd in DC United’s 1-0 win over CF Montreal on Saturday, O’Brien brightened a relatively dull affair with his creativity, aggressiveness and eye for goal. The 24-year-old had the most tackles (2) in the match and made four recoveries to complement his game-winning rebound goal 13 seconds into the second half after the woodwork denied a Mateusz Klich effort.\nLewis’ first MLS goal 🤩 pic.twitter.com/QRvJQMkS4W\n— D.C. United (@dcunited) April 16, 2023\n“We’ve done that every game, really, on kickoffs,” coach Wayne Rooney said. “And obviously, we got it right this time.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s something we always talk about, how important it is to start each half well. It was exactly what we wanted, with Taxi picking up the second ball, Klich hitting the post, and O’Brien reacting. Even though it was a bit direct, it’s a good goal, one in which we work on, so we’re really pleased.”\n— Burke\nSt. Louis City ends FC Cincinnati’s unbeaten run\nCincinnati head coach Pat Noonan had a brutal homecoming with his side getting thrashed 5-1 in St. Louis. While Noonan is one of the league’s top up-and-coming managers, there was little he could do about Saturday’s lopsided scoreline. It was Cincinnati’s first loss of the season and a win that reignited St. Louis City’s impressive inaugural campaign.\nThe home side had lost two consecutive matches after their own unbeaten start to the season. They took the lead after just three minutes when Jared Stroud blasted a first-time shot past Cincy goalkeeper Roman Celentano. Star signing Eduard Löwen doubled the lead in the 39th minute and Kyle Hiebert made it 3-0 before halftime.\nIn all, four different St. Louis players scored on the night. A Celentano own goal added insult to injury.\nNoonan insisted that the result was deceptive. He told reporters after the match that his side had not been played off the pitch. Instead, St. Louis was clinical and purposeful in the attack.\n“You can go a lot of way with this one, but it certainly didn’t feel like a 5-1 game,” Noonan said. “But it was, so that’s where we need to figure out the areas that we went wrong. I think they just were far superior in boxes tonight. I think five shots and five goals is what I saw at one point, so everything was going in.”\nThe match was physical and intense despite a two-hour weather delay. CityPark was rocking throughout the night in now typical fashion. St. Louis manager Bradley Carnell insisted post-game that his side’s recent form was not a sign that the league’s darlings needed to be fixed.\nAdvertisement\n“We never really wanted to speak about anything being broken,” said Carnell. “We’re the creators of our own destiny… we knew nothing was broken, nothing structural.”\nIt’s very early in the MLS season, but I’m confident that both FC Cincinnati and St. Louis will be high seeds come playoff time. The St. Louis players’ belief in their counter-pressing system and physical brand of soccer remains intact after losses to Minnesota United and Seattle humbled Carnell’s side. If they can remain top in the West, St. Louis will be a problem when they host playoff matches later this fall.\n— Cárdenas\nGiakoumakis quickly making a name for himself\nAtlanta United’s new center forward, Giorgos Giakoumakis, limped off the pitch on Saturday during Atlanta’s 2-2 draw away to Toronto FC. Before exiting the match, the Greek striker scored his fourth goal in as many starts, which made him just the seventh player in MLS history to do so. Giakoumakis’ header from a Brooks Lennon corner kick was a lovely bit of aerial skill.\nFour starts and 4️⃣ goals for our Tank 😤 pic.twitter.com/D0x0ttqaG5\n— Atlanta United FC (@ATLUTD) April 15, 2023\nIt was his third goal scored from a header, and all four of Giakoumakis’ goals have been scored from inside the opponent’s penalty area. Giakoumakis’ fast start has helped Atlanta United move on rather quickly from club legend Josef Martínez, who went to Inter Miami over the winter. More importantly, Giakoumakis epitomizes new Atlanta CEO Garth Lagerwey’s recruitment strategy. Lagerwey told The Athletic in March that experienced players simply “have more data,” as opposed to younger and unproven international players who Atlanta United has typically signed in the past.\n“I’ve had some success in my career in signing DPs in the prime age, between 24 and 29 years old,” Lagerwey said. “(Giorgos) Giakoumakis fits squarely within that range. When I say I’m risk averse, I want something to underpin what I think, what I look at.”\nThe 28-year-old Giakoumakis presses hard without the ball and has shown a knack for positioning himself cleverly inside the box. When he was introduced to the media in February, I mispronounced ‘Giakoumakis’ when I asked him my first question. Giakoumakis, nicknamed ‘GG,’ smiled and vowed to become a recognizable figure in MLS.\nAdvertisement\n“I hope if you’ll keep repeating my name with the goals then you will learn about it,” he replied. Trust me, I’ve polished my Greek pronunciations ever since.\n— Cárdenas\nSeason Pass outage\nComing into the season, industry insiders voiced concerns about MLS’ debut on Apple’s streaming platform. Essentially, the two sides agreed to terms with mere months to get an international streaming operation to showcase its matches up and running. There were questions about a host of factors, from talent to tech, alongside some specific quirks given the splintering streaming era we are all navigating. Still, as one source speaking with The Athletic summarized in October: “Whenever challenges come up, they just keep throwing more resources at it, and those problems go away pretty darn quickly.”\nWhen a broadcast deal has a partnership cost requiring a third comma over its decade-long duration, those resources aren’t just a luxury — they’re vital. For the first seven match weeks, MLS’ games on Apple went on without many hitches, save for the odd audio sync snafus in the early weeks. On Saturday, however, many Season Pass subscribers reported outages when trying to watch the main slate of games between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Eastern. The glitch told users that their subscriptions were not active, even though that wasn’t the case, preventing them from accessing match streams in Season Pass. As a result, many viewers missed the entire first half of the marquee Portland-Seattle matchup, as well as that of the delayed St. Louis-Cincinnati game.\nMLS Season Pass is currently having technical difficulties. Apple is working on resolving the issue.\n— FC Cincinnati (@fccincinnati) April 16, 2023\nThat may have been an act of salvation for fans of the Orange and Blue. Reuters reported that users also faced issues with other Apple services, like Apple Support and iCloud late on Saturday, so it seemed to be a wider issue that had particularly unfortunate timing for MLS and Season Pass customers. It is, however, a particularly worrisome occurrence when Apple is by and large the only way for fans of the league to watch their favorite teams, as local broadcast partnerships fell by the wayside for the new international streaming venture.\nMLS did not respond to requests for comment on the weekend’s outages.\n— Rueter\n(Top Photo: Jayne Kamin-Oncea/Soobum Im, USA TODAY Sports; Design: Samuel Richardson)",
