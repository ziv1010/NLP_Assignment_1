  "body_text": "Aston Villa fans comments on Newcastle United and NUFC fans after Saturday – Hilarious\nI have to thank the Aston Villa fans.\nNo honestly.\nI needed something to cheer me up and these comments from Aston Villa fans have certainly done that.\nHilarious.\nYou know all the things that Aston Villa fans accuse Newcastle United fans of, such as an obsession with them, getting carried with self-importance, thinking our team are world beaters, adding two and two together and getting five billion…\nYou can read all of that below.\nFair play to Aston Villa, they deserved to win for sure.\nHowever, all a bit embarrassing when not a single one of these Aston Villa fans even mentions how lucky they were with the outrageous deflections on the key first and third goals. Nor any mention of much the referee favoured Villa, getting the bookings they desired on the likes of Bruno and Joelinton with their players jumping ten feet in the air when anybody went near them, to try and get our players booked.\nAston Villa fans have only seen their team win once at St James’ Park since 1999 and that needed three NUFC players to be sent off in 2005. No wonder Aston Villa fans have such an inferiority complex regarding us.\nThe fact that Eddie Howe had overseen five wins out of six against them, including a 4-0, a 5-1, a 3-1 and a 3-0, yet I have never seen NUFC fans going on like Aston Villa fans are, when we have beaten them, again!\nIndeed, the only time I can remember such a similar (over!) reaction was when Villa got than one victory, the 3-0 over NUFC in April 2023 as we headed for the Champions League.\nSuch are the comments from so many of these Aston Villa fans, I just had to check that I had somehow missed them winning the quadruple…just how many points clear they were currently in the Premier League?\nThis is how the Premier League table looked on Sunday afternoon after the 2pm matches and before Leicester v Liverpool:\nSurely some mistake????\nAston Villa in seventh, rather than 30 points clear at the top!\nFair play to Aston Villa fans and their team, they are on a great run at the minute, just as Newcastle United are, our last seven games seeing NUFC win a trophy and win five of six PL matches to put us THIRD!\nA bit like celebrating a horse winning a race when it still has a fair few fences to jump, maybe Aston Villa fans should wait until it actually happens, at least get top five confirmed before you claim the best team, manager and fans in the world title.\nAs football fans, we all know just how quickly things can change in football, for better or worse.\nMaybe Villa on Tuesday night concede a couple of cruelly deflected own goals and lose against Man City.\nIf then Forest win as well tomorrow night, then Newcastle beat Ipswich next Saturday and Chelsea win at home to Everton, what will Aston Villa fans be having to say then?\nWith four Premier League matches to go, Villa would be five points behind Newcastle, four behind Man City, three behind Chelsea and three behind Forest (who would also have a game in hand).\nAlso, the small matter of all these other clubs having far better goal differences than Villa.\nMaybe bookmark this and revisit these comments from Aston Villa fans in a week or two…\nAston Villa fans commenting via their Villa Talk message board:\n‘It doesn’t get much better than smashing those deluded chumps.’\n‘Newcastle has been on an unstoppable rampage the last weeks, then we do this.\nAbsolutely mental performance.’\n‘WE’RE MASSIVE!’\n‘This is a title winning side. This momentum will carry over. Mark my words.’\n‘Howay the lads.’\n‘We’ve absolutely hammered Newcastle today. Probably deserved more!’\n‘Got to feel for Tindall a bit this evening, never nice to see a coach embarrassed like that.’\n‘Bogey team defeated.\nWho’s the best team in Europe? This week, we were.\nWe played like we want to make it back to the CL.’\n‘Excellent performance, excellent result. Just super\nWe are an excellent football team.’\n‘Importantly in form at the right part of the season. Need to keep getting results but there isn’t a team in football who wouldn’t fear us at the moment.\nWe also have the best bench in the history of football.’\n‘Tactically that was absolutely perfect. Just perfect. We exploited their CB’s weaknesses of the ground and cut their midfield open through the middle countless times. Could have scored 7 or 8. That was a stunning display.’\n‘Been on the hoy all day but Knew we would beat Wimbledon tonight\nTake that you over rated Geordie words removed.’\n‘We’ll beat Man City. Top 5 is in our hands.’\n‘4-1 flattered Newcastle massively. Easily our best performance the season. Unai getting us into our rhythm when it matters. He’s a beautiful Basque genius.’\n‘Tonali who?’\n‘Admittance that castle did look tired, particularly in the second half.\nWhen the commentators mentioned it was the same XI they’d picked for five games running, most of which have mirrored our schedule, I did wonder if with all the changes we’ve been able to make from game to game, if it would be significant, and I think it definitely played a part.’\n‘They also haven’t rotated. At all. which is why they look knackered today.’\n‘This was their 7th unchanged game in a row. Not even they could stay fresh that long.’\n‘Brilliant use of the squad by Emery, we’re absolutely cooking at the moment and we have so many options, comparing our bench to Newcastle’s was night and day. Would love for us to go and do a job on Man City midweek.’\n‘We turned the corner with magnificent January business that changed our fortunes. Full of confidence now.’\n‘It’s not often you win 4-1 and the opposition is lucky it wasn’t more.\nEasily could have been 7. On another day, double figures.\nOutstanding.’\n‘THAT is what I wanted all season.\nIt was beautiful.\nWe fully deserved it.\nWell done lads and thank you.\nYou delivered when it mattered.\nWell played, Newcastle!’\n‘We’re luck a footballing Terminator right now. Just completely unstoppable.’\n‘We’re the best side in the league currently, not even joking. This team is going places.’\n‘I was very confident and I am now feeling vindicated. We owned that lot. Shove your League Cup up your backside.\nWe will play in the UCL next season.’\n‘Top class performance against a very good physical side. Watkins my MOTM, absolutely fantastic performance. Emery got everything right, and the ref was OK. Sky are absolutely gutted that Newcastle lost.’\n‘Alan Shearer, Bruno Guimares, Ant and Dec, Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, Jimmy Nail, Kevin Keegan, Your boys took one hell of a beating!’\n‘Did Matt Ritchie just use the excuse of Newcastle have played 3 games in a week? Loool’\n‘Glorious. All the sweeter that it was against those words removed.\nOllie just shades it for MOTM but Rogers, Tielemans, Maatsen, Kamara and Mings were all fantastic, too.’\n‘Beat 2 top teams this week. 10 Wins out of last 11. Class. Beautiful to watch today, battered them really and could have had a hatful more.’\n‘Living in the North East, I’d gladly give up my bank holiday to go to work on Monday morning!’\n‘I hoped that our form would come about in the second half of the season after our mediocre first half and now we’re seeing it.’\n‘We’ve reacted to being knocked out of UCL by doing nothing more than curing our hangover, kicking in the face of everyone’s darling, and keeping Villa Park a fortress.’\n‘Hopefully Guimaraes has a Dog or a Cat.\nAnd when he gets in tonight, it’s sh.t on the floor.’\n‘They beat us the last time in 2021-22, one of two in 2022-23, both in 2023-24, and the first time in 2024-25. That was a stretch where they won 5 of 6. It felt good to beat them.’\n‘So we’ve just beat the apparent two best teams in the world 3-2 and 4-1, what does that make us?’\n‘I like that our club are classy, and don’t engage in silly behaviour.’\n‘Thought was going to be one of those days at one point but in the end rolled them over. They couldn’t handle the energy Ramsey and Onana bought after pressing aggressively all game.’\n‘Our subs kicked us up a notch and we possibly could have got another 2 or 3 goals had we had the rub of the green.’\n‘The score really didn’t represent the performance, Emery dismantled Tindals Newcastle, he had no answer to the way we set up. Our long balls were low and not down the middle, it caused them problems all game. It’s one game but let’s see how they react to that loss, teams no what they have to do, keep the outballs low and not down the middle.’\n‘Newcastle had no answers\nWe really are better than them.’\n‘Newcastle only have one way of playing. Villa are adaptable. That’s why moving forward were far better equipped for multiple competition football.’\n‘Once Joelinton got booked about 75% of Newcastle’s tactics went out the window. A shame it took so long for Guimaraes to get a deserved booking.’\n‘Absolutely battered them, 2nd half in particular.\nNewcastle’s squad is very rigid – they’ve got one way of playing, which is fast and kick lumps out of people. They have like for like subs, we’ve got variety and options. If they don’t make some squad depth in the summer then Europe will see them fall down the table again, which would be a huge shame because they’re such a likeable team – that Bruno lad in particular.’\n‘Missed the game, but it’s absolutely satisfying to humble the thugs in Newcastle today. Five fouls and one booking for Bruno G, Schar who shouldn’t have been on the pitch to score.’\n‘Was very happy to see Tindall getting taught a lesson by a real manager today as well. Don’t like that fella, proper little weirdo who seems very, very far up himself, especially for a No. 2.\nNewcastle and their fans have become very easy to dislike very quickly.’\n‘Newcastle team looking tired? Maybe don’t play the same lineup 7 matches In a row.’\nAston Villa 4 Newcastle 1 – Saturday 19 April 2025 5.30pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nSchar 18\nVilla\nWatkins 1 Maatsen 64, Burn OG 73, Onana 75\nPossession was Newcastle 51% Villa 49%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 10 Villa 23\nShots on target were Newcastle 3 Villa 9\nCorners were Newcastle 7 Villa 7\nTouches in the box Newcastle 36 Villa 31\nNewcastle team v Aston Villa:\nPope, Trippier (Krafth 76), Schar (Targett 82), Burn, Livramento, Joelinton, Tonali, Bruno, Barnes (Willock 76), Isak (Wilson 76), Murphy (Gordon 65)\nUnused subs:\nDubravka, Osula, Miley, Longstaff\n(A game too far – Aston Villa 4 Newcastle 1 – Read HERE)\n(Aston Villa 4 Newcastle 1 – Instant Newcastle United fan/writer reaction – Read HERE)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
