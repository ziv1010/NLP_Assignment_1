His interactions with the various groups at the AGM showcased his impactful leadership and dedication to promoting Nigerian football and fostering a collaborative environment.\nRead Also: Beulah takes free medical outreach to Ifako, Ogba communities\n“His tenure has also seen notable successes in Nigerian football, including the Super Falcons’ recent achievements and the positive growth of domestic competitions like the Nigeria Premier Football League, in which GTI Group is their strategic partner.\n“Aside the aforementioned, GTI commends Governor Seyi Makinde and the good people of Oyo State for their hospitality and great support during the NFF AGM. His Excellency used the occasion to appreciate the improvement in the quality of officiating in the Nigeria Premier Football League ably led by Otunba Gbenga Elegbeleye.\n“However, it is unfortunate that both Kwara United and Abia Warriors crashed out at the preliminary phase of the CAF Confederation Cup last weekend and this clearly shows that Nigerian clubs competing at the continental level should raise their game in order to compete favourably with better outcomes. The future is still bright for our clubs at the continental level and that is why GTI Group has been calling on Corporate Nigeria to invest more in our football as it is done in other thriving leagues elsewhere in the world.\n“To Remo Stars and Rivers United, who are flying Nigeria’s flag currently at the preliminary stage of the CAF Champions League, we encourage them to dig deep and ensure they remain committed to having a successful campaign. They should endeavour to give our soccer fans something to cheer for this season because we understand the demands of competing for trophies at the continental level could be quite enormous,” Ekejiuba concluded.",
