Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nRomero was a substantial investment at £43m and this summer could be Tottenham’s only chance to make a profit on the tough-tackling centre-back.\nThe Argentine may well be tempted to make the step up to Atletico Madrid and work with his countryman Diego Simeone at a club which is regularly in the Champions League and challenges for La Liga titles.\nHe has already voiced his frustrations with the way Tottenham is run, pointing out that the club struggles to strengthen the squad on a regular enough basis to compete with the biggest teams in the land.\nSpeaking earlier this season Romero told Telemundo Deportes: ‘Manchester City competes every year, you see how Liverpool strengthens its squad, Chelsea strengthens their squad, doesn’t do well, strengthens again, and now they’re seeing results.\n‘Those are the things to imitate. You have to realise that something is going wrong, hopefully, they (the board) realise it.\n‘The last few years, it’s always the same – first the players, then the coaching staff changes, and it’s always the same people responsible.\n‘Hopefully they realise who the true responsible ones are and we move forward because it’s a beautiful club that, with the structure it has, could easily be competing for the title every year.’\nMore Trending\nPostecoglou did not entirely condemn Romero for his words, but said he spoke to him about them and his defender apologised for the way he went about things.\nSpeaking in December, the Australian said: ‘He realises that a lot of what he said was good but some wasn’t the right way of dealing with it. The same way I wouldn’t criticise a player publicly.\n‘I’ve spoken to Cristian about it and he’s apologised for it. It wasn’t the right way to do it. It shows he cares. There’s a way to do it and this wasn’t it.’\nMORE: Martin Keown believes Arsenal have ‘already’ signed a new striker\nMORE: Liverpool rejected transfer fee from Real Madrid for Trent Alexander-Arnold\nMORE: William Gallas warns Man Utd over £50m signing despite star considering Old Trafford move",
