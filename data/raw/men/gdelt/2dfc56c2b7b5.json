Instead of a return to Chelsea, moving to Arsenal now appears his most likely solution.\nAccording to an update from Sky Sports, Arsenal will ‘intensify’ their interest in Rice when the season ends after previously casting glances at him during January.\nWest Ham are in no mood to sell their captain, who is under contract until 2025. Yet this may be their best chance to cash in on their biggest asset.\nTherefore, Arsenal are sensing a chance to take him to north London. Strengthening in midfield is one of their objectives in the coming months in order to protect the department for the long term.\nGranit Xhaka, Jorginho and Mohamed Elneny are all in their thirties already, and Thomas Partey will be as well by the start of next season.\nREAD MORE: Arsenal urged to sign league-leading captain as upgrade on regular starter who’s ‘on his last legs’\nAt the age of 24, Rice fits the bill for what Arsenal are looking for to evolve the role. His existing Premier League experience and international reputation with England will enhance how he is viewed at the Emirates Stadium.\nLikewise, Arsenal are almost certain to have Champions League football on offer next season, representing the level Rice wants to play at.\nWhether West Ham will be able to squeeze a nine-figure transfer sum out of Arsenal for Rice, as they publicly insist they want, remains to be seen.\nKANE BECOMES PSG PRIORITY TARGET\nParis Saint-Germain have made Tottenham striker Harry Kane their main attacking target for the summer, according to reports in the French capital.\nKane is about to enter the final year of his contract with Tottenham, but is seriously considering his future. The next terms he signs could take him through the remainder of the prime of his career, so he will want to be committing to the right club.\nDespite the lure of trophies, Kane has already apparently ruled out a move to Bayern Munich. Interest remains, though, from Man Utd in the Premier League.\nAnother contender to take him out of English football, according to Le Parisien, is PSG. In fact, the Ligue 1 champions have installed Kane as their top striker target for the summer.\nFinding a high-pedigree centre-forward is PSG’s main priority in the upcoming transfer window. With that in mind, Kane is right at the top of their wanted list.\nWhether they would have more success than Bayern Munich in tempting Kane remains to be seen. There is a realisation in Le Parisien‘s headline that Kane is a dream for PSG.\nIf they can convince him to join them, though, they believe he could be the missing piece of their attack to feature alongside Kylian Mbappe.\nJust as a move to Bayern would have, joining PSG would give Kane a huge chance of finally winning some trophies. But it would come at the cost of him having to abandon his pursuit of the Premier League all-time goalscoring record.\nNEWCASTLE LOOK AT LEEDS MIDFIELDER\nNewcastle have been monitoring Leeds midfielder Tyler Adams with a view to a summer swoop, per a report.\nWith Champions League qualification more than just a dream for Newcastle, they are beginning to make some exciting plans for the summer transfer window.\nDespite initially preparing a modest approach, the wealthy club are now ready to flex their financial muscles. Any area of their squad could be upgraded further, in theory.\nOne of the positions they are paying close attention to is midfield. In that regard, The Times has revealed they have been looking at Adams.\nThe USMNT player only joined Leeds last summer, reuniting with Jesse Marsch. Obviously, his compatriot has since lost his job as manager.\nEven before Marsch’s exit, there were fears that Leeds might lose Adams after just one season, thanks to his eye-catching form in an otherwise largely underwhelming side.\nNow, Newcastle could be trying to lure Adams further north, although they are simply working from long lists of targets at present, it is believed.",
