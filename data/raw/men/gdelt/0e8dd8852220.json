Frank Lampard will no doubt point to how they were two goals down to Napoli in that season-turning tie back in 2011-12 but this isn’t 2012 and Real Madrid very much are not that Napoli.\nCarlo Ancelotti’s side looked very much the champions of Europe here. That might make the scale of the defeat feel respectable for Chelsea, and the sort of performance where they will talk of pride in the effort, but they were chasing a far better team all night. It was a lesson in so many senses.\nMadrid looked like they treated it as if they were on the schoolyard.\nThe main threat seems like it might be complacency, but even that feels far-fetched given Chelsea went yet another game without scoring.\nTen-man Chelsea escape with some hope after a Champions League lesson by Real Madrid\nFT Real Madrid 2-0 Chelsea\n22:08 , Mike Jones\nFT Real Madrid 2-0 Chelsea\n22:06 , Mike Jones\nVinícius Junior has been named the Player of the Match with Uefa’s Technical Observer Panel saying:\n“He was the outstanding individual threat for Real Madrid. Chelsea had a plan to stop him but his consistency, intensity and energy during the game shone through.\n“He provided two assists and was the difference in yet another game at Champions League level.”\nFull-time: Real Madrid 2-0 Chelsea\n21:54 , Mike Jones\n90+5 mins: Mason Mount has a late chance to claw one back for Chelsea but Antonio Rudiger - his former teammate - denies him with a last ditch block.\nThe full-time whistle goes and Real Madrid win the game. They have a two goal cushion to bring to Stamford Bridge but a dogged effort over the final 30 minutes has kept Chelsea in with a chance of reaching the next round.\nReal Madrid 2-0 Chelsea\n21:52 , Mike Jones\n90+2 mins: Chance!

The host’s bench is so strong and all their substitutions so far could easily have started this game.\nSeven minutes or so to play.\nReal Madrid 2-0 Chelsea\n21:40 , Mike Jones\n80 mins: 10 minutes to go at the Bernabeu. Frank Lampard’s changes seem to have brought Chelsea slightly more control though Real Madrid are not really trying to push for a third goal.\nDani Ceballos comes on to replace Luka Modric for the hosts.\nReal Madrid 2-0 Chelsea\n21:37 , Mike Jones\n77 mins: Conor Gallagher and Mason Mount are sent onto the pitch to replace Thiago Silva and N’Golo Kante. It’s a brave move from Frank Lampard as Chelsea cannot allow themselves to concede another goal.\nThough difficult it is possible to come from two goals down to progress through a second leg but trying to overcome a three goal deficit would need a miracle performance.\nGOAL! Real Madrid 2-0 Chelsea (Asensio, 74’)⚽️\n21:34 , Mike Jones\n74 mins: That’s that for this match and possibly even the tie.\nChelsea concede a corner that Real Madrid play short.

They need to get through the next 30 minutes without conceding too many goals and make sure they’re still in the match for the second leg at Stamford Bridge.\nFrank Lampard is preparing more changes after that red card.\nRed card! Ben Chilwell is off!\n21:19 , Mike Jones\nReal Madrid 1-0 Chelsea\n57 mins: Things are going from bad to worse for Chelsea. A simple ball up the pitch from Real Madrid drops to Rodrygo after he turns away from Marc Cucurella.\nBen Chilwell tries to recover and yanks Rodrygo down on the edge of the box. He’s the last defender though and the referee has no choice but to pull out the red card!\nReal Madrid 1-0 Chelsea\n21:14 , Mike Jones\n53 mins: Frank Lampard is the first manager to look to the bench and brings on Marc Cucurella to replace Kalidou Koulibaly.\nEnzo Fernandez then switches the ball over to Reece James on the right wing but he’s got nowhere to go and has to send the ball back inside or risk losing possession.\nReal Madrid 1-0 Chelsea\n21:11 , Mike Jones\n48 mins: Chance! Chelsea fall to sleep as Vinicius Jr breezes around Reece James before sliding the ball into the penalty area for Luka Modric.\nModric arrives behind the back-tracking defenders and shoots first time but lifts his curling effort up and over the crossbar!\nSecond half: Real Madrid 1-0 Chelsea\n21:04 , Mike Jones\nReal Madrid get the match restarted at the Bernabeu. There’s been no changes from either manager so it’s as you were for both teams.\nIs there a way back into this match for Chelsea or will Madrid drive home their advantage?\nHT Real Madrid 1-0 Chelsea\n21:00 , Mike Jones\nReal Madrid have recorded eight shots on target in this match; the joint-most that Chelsea have faced in the first half of a Uefa Champions League game on record (since 2003/04)\nHT Real Madrid 1-0 Chelsea\n20:57 , Mike Jones\nKarim Benzema has scored 20 goals against English opponents in the Uefa Champions League, with only Lionel Messi scoring more (27).\nHT Real Madrid 1-0 Chelsea\n20:54 , Mike Jones\nHalf-time: Real Madrid 1-0 Chelsea\n20:48 , Mike Jones\n45 mins: Real Madrid take a slender lead into the half-time break as the home side took control of this quarter-final tie.\nChelsea are hanging in their but will need to increase their attacking qualities if they want to get back into this game.\nReal Madrid 1-0 Chelsea\n20:47 , Mike Jones\n42 mins: Federico Valverde hasn’t scored in nine games for Real Madrid and looks hungry for a goal tonight. He fires another effort at goal but sends this one straight into the arms of Kepa Arrizabalaga.\nReal Madrid 1-0 Chelsea\n20:43 , Mike Jones\n37 mins: Luka Modric whips a corner kick into the box for Real Madrid and the ball comes to David Alaba. He turns a shot towards goal but Kepa Arrizabalaga keeps it out.\nReal Madrid 1-0 Chelsea\n20:39 , Mike Jones\n34 mins: Reece James bombs forward on the right wing and tries to make something happen for Chelsea. He drives at Eduardo Camavinga and goes past the left-back before pulling a pass into the six-yard box.\nRaheem Sterling is up with him but the ball comes too close to Thibaut Courtois who smothers it.\nReal Madrid 1-0 Chelsea\n20:36 , Mike Jones\n28 mins: That Benzema goal has really settled Real Madrid who now seem increasingly confident in possession and are maintaining a better shape across the midfield.\nChelsea are struggling to regain the ball at present.\nReal Madrid 1-0 Chelsea\n20:29 , Mike Jones\n25 mins: Chelsea almost respond through Raheem Sterling after he’s picked out by Reece James.

He chips the ball into the box and picks out Vinicius Jr who is leaning on Wesley Fofana.\nVinicius touches it down and forces and sprawling save out of Kepa Arrizabalaga but Karim Benzema is on hand to tap home the rebound!\nReal Madrid 0-0 Chelsea\n20:19 , Mike Jones\n17 mins: Fofana has a nibble at Vinicius Jr as the winger looks to dribble the ball through Chelsea’s penalty area.

He shoots first time and tries to beat Kepa Arrizabalaga at the near post but the goalkeeper has the gap covered and clings onto the ball.\nThis has been a decent match up so far.

All the pundits and feelings say it should be an easy win for Real Madrid but there is something about European nights that make the improbable possible.\nCan Chelsea handle everything Madrid throw at them and somehow pull off a spectacular win?\nFrank Lampard says Europe offers Chelsea a welcome break from domestic struggles\n19:51 , Mike Jones\nThe Champions League will offer Frank Lampard’s Chelsea a chance to escape from “a place we don’t want to be” when they face Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\nChelsea’s interim coach was referring to the team’s position in the bottom half of the Premier League table after they failed to score in any of their last three league outings, with the Champions League offering their only hope of salvaging a wretched season.\nIn the past Europe has offered respite during difficult domestic seasons, as happened in 2012 when the Blues – managed by interim boss Roberto Di Matteo – were crowned Champions League winners at the same time as finishing sixth in the league.\nDi Matteo, who spent five seasons as a player at Chelsea, took over from Andre Villas-Boas when the Portuguese coach was sacked in February, and led the team to a stunning with against Barcelona in the semi-final before beating Bayern Munich in the final.\nLampard was asked about the similarities between the club’s current situation and that season, when a former Stamford Bridge favourite took the manager’s job whilst the team floundered and pulled off an unlikely European success.\nFrank Lampard says Europe offers Chelsea a welcome break from domestic struggles\nLampard on why Kai Havertz isn’t starting\n19:46 , Mike Jones\nFrank Lampard on opted to start João Félix and Raheem Sterling ahead of leading scorer Kai Havertz this evening and explained why he made that decision:\n“It wasn’t an easy choice for me. It’s a game where the output is going to be big, on and off the ball. There will be changes in-game. People in those energetic positions will have to come in and help the team.”\nWill Ancelotti return to Chelsea?\n19:41 , Mike Jones\nCarlo Ancelotti is well known to his opponents tonight. The Italian led Chelsea to a Premier League and FA Cup double in 2009/10 as part of a brilliant managerial career.\nHe has won league titles in all five of Europe’s top leagues - England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\nNow in his second spell at Real Madrid, he is chasing a fifth Champions League crown as a manager having picked up his fourth last year with Real.\nShould he fail to win the Champions League with Madrid again this season, he could find himself on the chopping block which may set up a potential return to Stamford Bridge in the summer.\nPre-match thoughts from Frank Lampard\n19:36 , Mike Jones\nChelsea’s caretaker boss, Frank Lampard, spoke to BT Sport ahead of kick off saying: “The balance of the team feels that we have to match the Real Madrid midfield, who have got three world-class players in there.\n“I felt that we’re strong in that area of the pitch. Going with Raheem [Sterling] and João [Felix] up front, they have great counter-attacking abilities; they’ve got speed, can handle the ball and can get us up the pitch.”\nReal Madrid vs Chelsea\n19:31 , Mike Jones\nReal Madrid and Chelsea had met in only three fixtures before 2020 – in two Uefa finals which were both won by Chelsea.\nThe second of those contests was the 1998 Uefa Super Cup in Monaco, when a Gustavo Poyet goal seven minutes from time at the Stade Louis II gave Uefa Cup Winners’ Cup holders Chelsea a 1-0 victory against Madrid, who had qualified by winning the Uefa Champions League.\nThe English club had also come out on top in the 1971 European Cup Winners’ Cup final against Madrid in Piraeus. The first game finished 1-1, Peter Osgood’s 56th-minute goal at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium cancelled out in the final minute by Ignacio Zoco.\nTwo days later in a replay at the same stadium, first-half goals from John Dempsey and Osgood again earned Chelsea their first European trophy despite Sebastián Fleitas pulling one back for Madrid 15 minutes from time.\nReal Madrid vs Chelsea\n19:26 , Mike Jones\nThomas Tuchel’s Chelsea were 3-1 aggregate winners against Zinédine Zidane’s Real Madrid in the 2020/21 semi-finals.\nGoals from Timo Werner and Mason Mount secured a 2-0 second-leg victory at Stamford Bridge after the first leg in Spain had finished 1-1, Christian Pulisic’s 14th-minute opener for the visitors was cancelled out by Karim Benzema 15 minutes later.\nWho awaits in the semi-finals?\n19:21 , Mike Jones\nThe Champions League semi-final draw was done at the same time as the quarter-finals so the teams already know who they’ll face next if they make it that far.\nThe winner of Real Madrid vs Chelsea will face Manchester City or Bayern Munich but that will most likely be City after their 3-0 first leg win last night.\nAC Milan or Napoli could face an all-Italian semi-final after Inter Milan’s 2-0 win at Benfica.\nChelsea spent £600m and the best goalscorer they signed was the manager\n19:16 , Mike Jones\nIt is exactly a year since Chelsea visited the Bernabeu. It is 365 days since one of the great displays of doomed heroics in their history. Same place, another time. Real Madrid ultimately illustrated why they are Europe’s comeback kings but only after a stunning fightback from Chelsea. They went 3-0 up in the Bernabeu. Now the architect of it, Thomas Tuchel, is gone, along with two of the scorers, Antonio Rudiger and Timo Werner. The other one, Mason Mount, could be gone this summer.\nBut the differences extend beyond the names and faces. After three goals in the Bernabeu, Chelsea have now gone three games under three different managers without scoring. It is a strange sort of hat-trick, but one to sum up Chelsea’s season. The club who have spent more than anyone else in football had over two transfer windows now have 14 goals in their last 22 games. Karim Benzema has six goals in April to Chelsea’s none, 19 since 30 December to their 12. A reunion 12 months on may not feel a fair contest.\nAt least, after spending some £600m in a remarkable recruitment drive, Chelsea can call upon the services of a prolific scorer in the Spanish capital. Not Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, whose Clasico brace in Madrid last year is as irrelevant as his Premier League and Bundesliga Golden Boots and career total of 304 goals after being omitted from their European squad, but a scorer in a Champions League final. Admittedly, Frank Lampard is a 44-year-old caretaker manager now, rather than the most prolific midfielder of his generation. But after bringing in a host of players with a marked aversion to putting the ball in the net, Todd Boehly has finally hired someone who did so on a record 211 occasions for Chelsea.\nChelsea spent £600m and the best goalscorer they signed was the manager\nReal Madrid vs Chelsea\n19:11 , Mike Jones\nThe two sides met at the same stage of last season’s competition with Carlo Ancelotti’s Madrid winning 5-4 on aggregate.\nThe Spanish side won the first leg 3-1 at Stamford Bridge with Karim Benzema scoring twice in the first half before Kai Havertz halved the Chelsea deficit five minutes before the break. Benzema then completed his hat-trick in the first minute of the second period.\nThomas Tuchel’s Chelsea came back strongly at the Santiago Bernabéu thanks to goals from Mason Mount and Antonio Rudiger.\nThey levelled the tie before Timo Werner gave the Blues the aggregate lead with 15 minutes left to play. Rodrygo’s 80th-minute reply forced extra time, where Benzema netted a decisive strike in the 96th minute.\nReal Madrid vs Chelsea\n19:06 , Mike Jones\nReal Madrid are looking to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the 11th time in 13 seasons, while Chelsea have appeared in the last four eight times but only once in the last eight campaigns.\nMadrid have won six of their eight games in this season’s competition (with one draw and one defeat) while Chelsea have recorded five victories and two defeats – both losses coming away from home.\nReal Madrid vs Chelsea\n19:01 , Mike Jones\nReal Madrid and Chelsea, the last two winners of the Champions League, meet in the knockout rounds for the third season running as their quarter-final kicks off at the Bernabéu.\nEach side has enjoyed recent success against the other en route to taking the trophy; Madrid edged through a remarkable last-eight meeting last season on their way to claiming their 14th European Cup, while Chelsea’s 2020/21 triumph included a semi-final elimination of the Spanish side.\nFrank Lampard hits back at James Corden rumours after taking Chelsea job\n18:56 , Mike Jones\nFrank Lampard has rubbished claims Chelsea owner Todd Boehly appointed him as interim manager after a recommendation from James Corden.\nLampard was reappointed Blues boss to the surprise of many last week and reports suggested Corden, who is friendly with Boehly, persuaded the American billionaire owner to bring back the club’s record goalscorer to the dugout.\nCorden, a West Ham fan, has hosted American talk show The Late Late Show since 2015 and was seen at Stamford Bridge with Boehly last October.\nFrank Lampard hits back at James Corden rumours after reappointment as Chelsea boss\nReal Madrid vs Chelsea team changes\n18:51 , Mike Jones\nCarlo Ancelotti makes six changes to the Real Madrid side that lost to Villarreal on Saturday. He brings back Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao into the defence whilst stacking the midfield with experience and talent. Federico Valverde, Edouardo Camavinga, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos all return.\nThere are three changes for Frank Lampard’s Chelsea. He sets the Blues up in a 3-5-2 formation and brings Thiago Silva into the back line in place of Marc Cucurella. N’Golo Kante starts in midfield alongside Mateo Kovacic and Enzo Fernandez whilst Ben Chilwell will provide momentum as the left wingback.\nChelsea can find solace in Champions League\n18:48 , Mike Jones\n\"The Premier League is one of the greatest challenges in world football, and those challenges have obviously taken us to a place we don’t want to be as Chelsea,\" said Frank Lampard when speaking about Chelsea’s struggles this season.\n\"I think the Champions League sometimes offers you a bit of escapism from that - a different speed of game, knockout football, those things can all contribute to getting different success in the same season.\n\"There’s pressure on both teams due to the size of both clubs. Are Real Madrid favourites? Yes. [But] there’s no better carrot in football than trying to prove people wrong.\n\"I think that’s a nice challenge for us. I’m not worried about that, in terms of pressure. Football at this level is pressure and if you can’t handle it, you’re not a big club or big player.\"\nChelsea line-up\n18:44 , Mike Jones\nChelsea XI: Arrizabalaga; Fofana, Thiago Silva, Koulibaly; James, Kante, Kovacic, Fernandez, Chilwell; Sterling, Felix\nYour Chelsea! 🔵#UCL pic.twitter.com/IcN5ciolqy\n— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) April 12, 2023\nLampard’s history with Ancelotti\n18:43 , Mike Jones\nFrank Lampard will be aiming to outwit one of his former managers this evening.\nHe featured in 83 of Carlo Ancelotti’s 109 matches in charge of Chelsea and only Didier Drogba (50) scored more goals for the Blues under the Italian head coach than Lampard’s tally of 40.\n27 of those goals came in Ancelotti’s first campaign in charge of the Blues in 2009/10.\nAncelotti on Lampard\n18:39 , Mike Jones\n\"I hope that Lampard is able to do a fantastic job with them,\" said Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti when asked about Frank Lampard’s appointment as caretaker manager.\n\"He has 20 years’ less experience [than me], but that will not change what will happen in the game.\n\"He was a fantastic player, extraordinary, he knows very well what can happen in these games but experience, in these matches, I don’t think counts for much.\n\"He arrived at the club a week ago, with a lot of players that he already knew.

I’m really looking forward to the occasion myself.\"\nReal Madrid are everything Todd Boehly’s Chelsea want to be\n18:17 , Mike Jones\nIn the initial interviews for Chelsea managers, there was one concern among the club’s hierarchy that became apparent with a few of the candidates. That was the nagging feeling that they were prioritising going to Real Madrid if Carlo Ancelotti leaves in the summer, and may even have been using Stamford Bridge interest to instigate moves. It is difficult to deny the allure of the Bernabeu, and that includes what the defending European champions will look like for the future, before you even consider all that grand history.\nSuch a stature also points to how Madrid continue to defy the economic realities of the game. It’s all the more impressive since the expectation was that they would be another continental giant left behind by the Premier League’s wealth. The truth is they still have, at least in terms of pure finance, but the key has been how successfully they have adapted to that. It is a lesson for the game, and especially for Wednesday night’s Champions League opposition.\nWhen the current Chelsea owners were surveying football in order to make plans for what the club would look like, an obvious example was Liverpool. Co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali felt they could recreate a better-resourced version in London, with all the advantages of the capital. That would be to sign all the best developing talent, and fashion a great team out of it for the long term.\nReal Madrid are everything Todd Boehly’s Chelsea want to be\nReal Madrid vs Chelsea prediction\n18:12 , Mike Jones\nReal Madrid should take control of this quarter-final tie with a strong home win after resting several of their first team stars for the defeat to Villarreal last Saturday.\nFrank Lampard’s return to the Chelsea dugout failed to inspire an immediate response from the Chelsea players and against a disciplined and determined Real they should find things difficult tonight.\nReal Madrid 2-0 Chelsea.\nReal Madrid vs Chelsea predicted line-ups\n18:07 , Mike Jones\nReal Madrid XI: Courtois; Carvajal, Militao, Rudiger, Alaba; Modric, Camavinga, Kroos; Valverde, Benzema, Vinicius Jr.\nChelsea XI: Kepa; James, Fofana, Koulibaly, Chilwell; Fernandez, Kante, Kovacic; Sterling, Havertz, Felix\nWhat is the early team news?\n18:02 , Mike Jones\nCarlo Ancelotti elected to rest a number of first-choice players as Real Madrid slipped to a defeat to Villarreal in weekend La Liga action, but Luka Modric and Toni Kroos should return for this first leg. Ferland Mendy is still recovering from a calf issue. Villarreal winger Álex Baena has made a formal report after an alleged assault by Federico Valverde after that 3-2 win, though as things stand the Real Madrid and Uruguay midfielder will be able to feature.\nChelsea are likely to have N’Golo Kante back amongst things after the Frenchman was absent for the Wolves loss, though Mason Mount’s niggly injury could rule him out.
