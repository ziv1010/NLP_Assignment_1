The head-to-head games between the sides in this competition are a dead heat with each side claiming three wins apiece as well as 3 draws.\nManchester City are in scintillating form, winning 18 of their last 22 games in all competitions and remaining unbeaten since defeat at Tottenham back in early February. Striker Erling Haaland is breaking records with every passing game and the defense has solidified after the World Cup, making them betting favourites in the competition.\nReal Madrid, however, have conceded this season’s La Liga title to rivals Barcelona but were comfortably the second best team in the league. The Galacticos won the Copa Del Rey this month beating Osasuna 2-1. Real Madrid will be hungry to add to that silverware, setting up this week’s clash in Manchester to be an all time great. We think there could be plenty of goals during this huge Champions League clash, so read on for our Manchester City vs. Real Madrid predictions for Wednesday.\nBest bets for Manchester City vs. Real Madrid including Manchester City money line\nHaaland is the most in-form striker in world football scoring 49 goals in all competitions this season and the game against Real Madrid would be the perfect match for the striker to make it 50. You can bet on Haaland to score anytime at odds of -190 or to score two or more goals at +250 (via DraftKings Sportsbook).\nManchester City are the form team in Europe and the sportsbooks have them favoured going into Wednesday’s game. With the way the team from Manchester have been playing, it will be a very tough task for Madrid heading to the Etihad. Manchester City are currently priced at -170 with a handicap of -1, but our best bet for this huge clash is Manchester City to win in 90 minutes.

The Spanish midfielder was dealing with a knee injury late in the game, before eventually being taken off for Kalvin Phillips. However, Pep Guardiola has insisted that Rodri will bounce back quickly from the knock and will be okay on Wednesday.\nA hamstring injury once again kept Nathan Ake out of the City team to face Everton. An initial three-game absence saw the defender briefly return before he was forced off against Leeds and missed the games with Madrid and the Toffees. He returned to training, with Guardiola describing him as feeling “much better” ahead of the weekend. Ake is therefore potentially in contention for the Real Madrid second leg.\nReal Madrid\nFerland Mendy made his long-awaited return from a calf injury in the league this weekend, whilst David Alaba, Rodrygo and Karim Benzema were completely rested with an eye on the second leg at Etihad Stadium on Wednesday.\nEduardo Camavinga had emerged as a doubt when he was substituted in the latter stages of Saturday’s game against Getafe, but Ancelotti said that the midfielder will be back in training on Monday, as he only suffered a blow to his knee.\nRegister for a DraftKings account with this link using our Manchester City vs. Real Madrid predictions and earn bonus bets totaling $150 after placing just a $5 wager.\nGambling Problem?
