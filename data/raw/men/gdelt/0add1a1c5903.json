So it certainly feels like there’s a good vibe around at the moment and we want to try and keep that going.\nWolves won last weekend against Shrewsbury in the FA Cup, then have had a free week to prepare for Sunday.\nEddie Howe and his players though, having had their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Manchester City to deal with as well, though thankfully a five day stretch between these two games.\nRob Edwards knowing what a challenge faces them against United: “We will take anything we can get but we know we are coming up against a really good team that is playing Champions League football, playing in semi-finals of competitions, have recently won a trophy and they are competing at the level they want to be at, with a fantastic manager in Eddie Howe and all his staff.”\nWolves won their first Premier League match of the season against West Ham.\nThen followed it up with a Molineux victory over Shrewsbury, Wolves giving themselves and their fans some respite.\nRob Edwards looking to build on that: “We know it is a really difficult game for us but it is one we are really looking forward to. We have been able to prep for it this week and it’s an exciting game for us. It is nice now we have won a couple of games at home, so I think there’s a bit of a better feel around the around the place and around Molineux now, which is good, so we want to try and utilise that. The cup game was nice, the win before against West Ham was good, we’ve seen some goals, we have seen some good performances, because that was really what we were lacking since we had arrived.”\nRelegation still looks a certainty.\nRob Edwards though, insists that regardless of what will end up happening at the end of the season, the players will still do their best in the meantime: “A lot of the lads around here want to try and maybe right some of the wrongs. They want to help the club, they want to do well for themselves, but for the football club as well. They really are genuinely all committed. That’s not saying that no one’s going to go, but there’s not people banging my door down or trying to force anything. That’s not the case.”\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
