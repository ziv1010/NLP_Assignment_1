  "body_text": "Manchester United appear to be in with a fighting chance of signing priority transfer target Michael Olise.\nBelieved to be a “pre-approved” signing by INEOS, United are expected to pull out all the stops to bring the Crystal Palace winger to Old Trafford.\nThe club seems to be in dire need of some fresh legs on the wing. Marcus Rashford has been a shadow of his former self this season, while Antony, despite a goal at the weekend, has long proven to be an unreliable option.\nAlthough Alejandro Garnacho has enjoyed a fine season despite having to play majorly on the right wing, he has struggled as of late – perhaps an indication that he is being overplayed.\nWith his price tag reported to be £60 million, Olise could prove to be great value for money, however, the lack of a release clause means that a bidding war could ensue thus pushing his price upwards.\nFurthermore, the structure of his contract would require a portion of his transfer fee to be paid to his previous club Reading as well as a percentage to the player himself, making a potential deal more complex.\nLast week, however, United received a major boost in their pursuit of the Palace star. As relayed by The Peoples Person, Chelsea appear to have withdrawn their interest as they seek to strengthen their squad in other positions.\nNow that United have seemingly fewer rivals in the race to sign Olise, a deal this summer appears increasingly likely. What’s more, former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan is of the belief that a summer deal is possible.\n“Everyone is going to be looking at Olise and [Ebere] Eze and that is a big challenge for Palace,” Jordan explained in an interview with talkSPORT, acknowledging that both players have become transfer targets for major clubs.\n“I think you’re probably in a situation where Michael Olise signed a new contract last year predominantly to protect Palace’s value in the next set of negotiations,” Jordan explained.\n“But if Man United come, or Liverpool or Arsenal come, the player forms part of the problem because he then goes; ‘Well, I love it here but I want to go to this bigger football club. Now, I want to go.”\nShould the allure of joining a larger club appeal to Olise, then United may be in with a chance to lure him to Old Trafford this summer.\nStill, the club will be concerned that Erik ten Hag was unable to secure Champions League football next season, which could be to United’s detriment should a side in the top four decide to join the race to sign Olise.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
