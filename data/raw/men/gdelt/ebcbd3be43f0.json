  "body_text": "Age: 29 Position: Forward/full-back Teams: Barcelona and Sweden\nFridolina Rolfo is used to starring on the biggest stages and she did so once again in June, scoring the winner as Barcelona came from 2-0 down to beat Wolfsburg 3-2 and win the Champions League in Eindhoven.\nIt was third time lucky for the Swede, who previously found herself on the losing side in the European showpiece for both Barca and former club Wolfsburg.\nThe Swedish forward is versatile, with Barcelona deploying her in a defensive role last season, her work helping the side to storm to a Liga F triumph, finishing 10 points clear of runners-up Real Madrid.\nAnd when Sweden faced a penalty shootout against reigning champions the USA in the last 16 of the World Cup, she stood up to take the first kick as they earned a victory that ensured an early exit for one of the favourites.\nSweden lost to eventual winners Spain in the semis, but Rolfo took home a bronze medal and scored three goals across the tournament, including in the third-place play-off as they triumphed over co-hosts Australia.\nRolfo in her own words\nHow did it feel to score the winner in the Champions League final?\n\"That was a special one for me - as a defender it's not often I'm scoring goals. Suddenly it was in front of my feet and I was looking where should I put the ball and it was a good goal - maybe the most important goal in my career.\n\"In the first half we were so disappointed with the result because we had the ball but couldn't score.\n\"I remember everyone saying we have to believe, because it is possible we can score three goals and that's what we did.\n\"The mental part at half-time was really important and we showed how good we can be.\"\nWhat does she remember about beating the USA on penalties in the World Cup?\n\"This memory is one of those that will stay with me as long as I live, especially the last penalty kick. I couldn't watch it.\n\"When Lina (Hurtig) was stepping up to shoot, I was so nervous. I couldn't watch because I knew how important it was and how much we wanted to reach the next stage.\n\"I felt really calm [for my penalty], I was not that nervous. The coach was asking who wanted to be the first one and I said I wanted to start.\n\"I was sure I wanted to take the first one. I believe in my team-mates but [then] you can't do anything, you're just standing there, nervous.\"\nDid she dream of being a footballer?\n\"When I think back to when I was younger, I didn't dream about being a footballer. I [didn't think] it was a job you could have, you could not live on it.\n\"I thought that it was only boys [that] could have those dreams.\n\"But so much has happened and if I knew how far you could reach as a football player, I would be crazy proud of my whole journey because it's been amazing.\n\"I never thought I could live this dream that I'm living at the moment.\"\nWho were her footballing role models?\n\"My biggest role model was (Brazilian footballer) Marta. She came to Sweden when she was really young and started her professional career there.\n\"She was so, so different in her technique, speed, dribbling. She was my biggest role model. I even named my cat after her, so she was a big part of me growing up, having someone to look up to.\n\"I remember my mum took me to women's games, they were maybe not that popular, but she was like 'we should watch women, it's something you can identify with'.\"\n'She has an incredible mentality'\nBarcelona captain Alexia Putellas: \"She understands how we play and how to win. She is very motivated and cares about helping the team, everyone can see that.\n\"Fridolina is fantastic. She has tremendous energy, a great shot and many qualities. We are lucky to have those qualities in our team.\"\nBarcelona team-mate Lucy Bronze, speaking after their Champions League final success: \"She's been incredible for us all season in a role that's a little different.\n\"She shows that she has an incredible mentality when she comes in and performs in the most important game of the year.\"\nAchievements of 2022-23\nWhat else should you know?\nShe is naturally a forward - but often plays as a full-back for Barcelona\nAt the start of her career she juggled playing with working at a bank\nRolfo has won two Olympic silver medals\nShe loves handball, which she played until she was 15, and is an ambassador for the European Handball Championships in Germany in January\nIf you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote, external.",
