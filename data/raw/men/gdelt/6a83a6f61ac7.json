Stick the ball in the net at the other end of the field once in a while and we could be in business.\nAn away point\nThree away matches have now seen three points in total for the black and whites. Drawing away from home and winning at St James’ could be the formula for another crack at Champions League football. The seventy-six points this would be rewarded with over a thirty-eight game season would have comfortably been enough for a top-four finish in last year’s league table. This is still the case even when factoring in the recent home defeat against Liverpool. Seven points from our next three matches (two at home and one away) would see us well on course to becoming a team that consistently plays against the very best in Europe.\nSquad depth\nLong gone are the days when the demands of Europe would see our squad stretched beyond breaking point.\nEddie Howe was able to make seven changes from our midweek confrontation with Barcelona and still go toe-to-toe away from home against one of the form teams of the Premier League. Not only that but we came away with a decent result and a point in the bag.\nNEGATIVES\nRobbed?\nPerhaps our best chance of taking the lead came at the start of the second half, when Waltemade clearly had his shirt pulled in the area.\nLudicrously, this was not only missed/ignored by the referee but also survived a VAR check, despite it being clear as day. What is the point of VAR when even the most basic of rules are completely overlooked? A penalty for NUFC at that time could have changed the whole complexion of the match and seen the travelling Toon Army celebrating three points for the lads, making for a much more enjoyable journey home.\nSnooze fest\nI’m in the process of attempting to encourage my three-year-old son into the bittersweet universe of being an obsessive NUFC fan.\nI thought I was onto a winner when ‘Peppa Pig’ was switched over without protest and he pointed to the screen with a smile and said ‘Newcastle!’.\nHe then promptly lay down and fell fast asleep on the sofa for the entirety of the match. I think we can all agree he had the right idea, quite frankly I wish I’d done the same as the match proved to have very little incident of note zzzzzzzzz.\nPoints dropped\nThree away draws so far this season that could (perhaps even should) have all seen wins for NUFC, mean that we have already dropped six points away from home. It’s still too early for the league table to be truly taking shape but our current position of thirteenth place could be a much healthier second in the league if we’d turned those draws against Villa, Leeds and Bournemouth into victories. Let’s start racking up the points that will fire us towards the top four, starting next weekend against Arsenal.\nBournemouth 0 Newcastle 0 – Sunday 21 September 2025 2pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nBournemouth:\nPossession was Newcastle 44% Bournemouth 56%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 4 Bournemouth 11\nShots on target were Newcastle 1 Bournemouth 2\nCorners were Newcastle 2 Bournemouth 5\nTouches in the box Newcastle 18 Bournemouth 16\nNewcastle team v Bournemouth:\nPope, Livramento, Thiaw (Lascelles 84), Botman, Burn, Hall, Tonali, Miley, Willock (Barnes 62), Woltemade (Osula 84), Murphy (Elanga 62)\nUnused subs:\nRamsdale, Trippier, Joelinton, Krafth, Bruno\n(Bournemouth 0 Newcastle 0 – Instant Newcastle United fan/writer reaction – Read HERE)\n(Bournemouth 0 Newcastle 0 – A great point and (defensive!) performance from United – Read HERE)\nNewcastle United fixtures definitely confirmed dates and times (All of the Champions League matches will also be available to watch on TV in the UK):\nWednesday 24 September – Newcastle v Bradford (7.45pm) Sky Sports+\nSunday 28 September– Newcastle v Arsenal (4.30pm) Sky Sports\nWednesday 1st October: Union SG vs Newcastle United (5.45pm)\nSunday 5 October– Newcastle v Forest (2pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 18 October – Brighton v Newcastle (3pm)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
