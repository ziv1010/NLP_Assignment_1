He has been an unused substitute in four of those matches.\nLast season, Nwaneri played mostly on the right wing and scored nine goals in 37 appearances in all competitions to mark himself out as one of England's most talented young players.\nBut with Madueke the first choice as backup to Bukayo Saka and Eze the number 10 to challenge captain Martin Odegaard, the two positions Nwaneri would fit into have become harder to secure.\nThe challenge for Arsenal's youngsters\nArsenal are having an excellent season, are seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, have an 100% record in the Champions League, and are in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup with a lead over Chelsea from the first leg.\nThe Gunners are hoping to end their wait for a trophy this season and have signed a number of players, including midfielders Martin Zubimendi and Eze, and striker Viktor Gyokeres, as \"win now\" signings.\nThat has meant that manager Mikel Arteta has looked at using players with experience to get results, with Odegaard and Zubimendi preferred in midfield, while the Spaniard has favoured both Riccardo Calafiori and Piero Hincapie at left-back this season.\nHincapie has experience of winning a league title, having been part of the Bayer Leverkusen side that won the Bundesliga in 2023-24.\nThat has made things difficult for Nwaneri's fellow academy graduate Myles Lewis-Skelly.\nLewis-Skelly also took his chance during Arsenal's injury crisis last season, making 42 appearances in all competitions, including playing in both games of the impressive Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid.\nLewis-Skelly's performances were so good that he was given an England debut by Thomas Tuchel, scoring against Albania in a 2-0 win and looked set to be the Three Lions' starting left-back at the World Cup.\nGame time hasn't been as hard to come by for Lewis-Skelly and he has started nine of his 23 appearances this season, but he has started just once in the Premier League and has dropped out of the England squad.\nIt is always going to be hard for young players to break through from the academy into the first team at a club like Arsenal without any dips in form.\nBut after two excellent breakthrough seasons for Lewis-Skelly and Nwaneri, it looks as though the development path will be slightly different to what the pair imagined at the beginning of the season.\nLatest Stories\n-\nBooming Indicators, Dying Rivers: Ghana under Chronic Environmental Poisoning\n23 minutes -\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n52 minutes -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n1 hour -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n1 hour -\nNSA introduces dual authentication system for 2025/26 enrolment exercise\n3 hours -\nFuel prices to increase from Feb. 16, influenced by cedi’s depreciation\n3 hours -\nGNFS to launch automated fire safety compliance system to modernise regulation\n3 hours -\nNALAG president commends Local Gov’t Minister for payment of assembly members’ allowances\n3 hours -\nIs having a physical security operations center in your business worth it?\n3 hours -\nAsiedu Nketia recounts fierce political wars in Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam constituency\n3 hours -\nNRSA sets up committee to probe road crashes involving Toyota Voxy\n4 hours -\nCocoa farmers decry the adverse impact of producer price cut on livelihoods\n4 hours -\nFamilies who lose relatives to ‘no bed syndrome’ must sue health facilities – Dr. Nawaane\n4 hours -\nGhana Sports Fund: Dr. David Kofi Wuaku outlines vision for Youth Empowerment growth through sports\n4 hours -\nNUGS President urges sustainable digital governance\n4 hours",
