  "body_text": "In Nashville in 1978, a songwriter from Genoa, Giorgio Calabrese, was introduced to Frank Sinatra. When Sinatra learned where he came from, his face lit up. Sinatra’s mother, Natalina Garaventa, was practically Genovese, too. Her side of the family hailed from Lumarzo in the Ligurian countryside.\n“Giorgio, you have got to know one thing,” Sinatra supposedly told Calabrese. “The city and Genoa Cricket and Football Club are in my heart.”\nAdvertisement\nIt’s why, ever since 2008, My Way has been installed as a club anthem. At Marassi on Sunday, PierC, an X Factor contestant, performed it before kick-off for the 110th anniversary of Sinatra’s birth.\n“For what is a man. What has he got?”\nClashes between Genoa and Inter ultras beforehand were perhaps too literal a reply, as police officers sustained injuries and parked cars went up in flames. Inside the ground, the atmosphere — as is so often the case in this tight and smoky arena — caused the hairs on the back of the neck to stand to attention.\nGenoa hadn’t won a league game here in the 239 days between April and November. They did next to no business in the summer, signing only Nicolae Stanciu on a permanent deal. A Romanian like the owner Dan Sucu and sporting adviser to the board, Razvan Rat, he was a free agent and has played a grand total of 172 minutes in Serie A this season.\n“Genoa has been lacking normality for too long,” Sucu told Il Secolo XIX a week ago, alluding to the curious circumstances in which he took over a club caught between the multi-club group 777 and its creditors, A-Cap.\nPatrick Vieira and sporting director Marco Ottolini left last month with Genoa in relegation bother. But through it all, when there was doubt, the fans never protested. The crowds at Marassi are some of the best in European football. Genoa have averaged gates of more than 30,000 this season and the pre-game choreography celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Figgi do Zena (Sons of Zena) ultra group even drew praise from Inter coach Cristian Chivu, who enjoyed a warm embrace from Daniele De Rossi, his former team-mate at Roma.\nRather than silence the raucous crowd (impossible), Inter hushed their critics instead. Their towering centre-back Yann Bisseck became the sixth defender to score for Inter this season, giving the visitors an early lead. Skipper Lautaro Martinez then made it 2-0 before half-time, lashing a shot beyond Genoa goalkeeper Nicola Leali.\nIt was his 123rd goal in Serie A, the same number as the late, great Gianluca Vialli, who celebrated so many of his own on this ground in much, much happier times for Sampdoria — the other team from this port town, who currently lie second from bottom in Serie B.\nAdvertisement\nGenoa made De Rossi and their supporters proud by making Inter work for their win. The other Vitinha pulled one back, forcing Chivu into a series of defensive adjustments to ensure Inter left Liguria with all three points. He replaced one of his strikers with a midfielder and one of his midfielders with an extra centre-back.\nInter held on and went top of the table for the first time since April. After Juventus, Milan, Napoli and Roma, Serie A has a fifth new leader this season.\n“They called us failures, has-beens, but we’re here,” Chivu smiled and vented to DAZN at full-time. “Five months ago, we were supposed to be eighth or 10th because we were finished.” They’re clearly not.\nDetractors have only said as much because Inter have lost six times this season. Five of those defeats have come in big games: the Derby d’Italia, the Derby della Madonnina, Napoli away, Atletico Madrid and Liverpool in the Champions League. It suggests a trend — a glass jaw in heavyweight bouts — and yet it’s hard to argue Inter deserved to lose any of them.\nMistakes by goalkeeper Yann Sommer have cost them. Refereeing blunders, too. Soft penalties. The truth is Inter have a higher ceiling than anybody else in Serie A and are deep enough to cope with injuries to Francesco Acerbi, Hakan Calhanoglu, and the intermittence of Marcus Thuram.\nThe other contenders hit the skids\nChampions Napoli have had to improvise an entirely new setup over the last month in acknowledgement of a lengthy casualty list. Initially, the contingency worked and they were able to go on a run. Now fatigue is catching up with them. The same players are having to play over and over again.\nBeaten at the Bluenergy Stadium at the weekend, Bluenergy was exactly what Napoli were lacking. Udinese ran over them in the second half. They had a couple of goals disallowed and hit the bar before Jurgen Ekkelenkamp curled in a fabulous winner.\nAdvertisement\n“I wish I could always play Napoli,” he smirked on DAZN afterwards, having scored against them in the past.\nAppearing beside him, Nicolo Zaniolo was sincere in his delight for his team-mate as he picked up the player of the match award. Zaniolo would have been a deserving winner of it, too. Once the next big thing in Italian football, Udinese are his eighth club. His inability to make it at Atalanta under Gian Piero Gasperini seemed to indicate that that was it for him at the highest levels of Serie A.\nThose opinions are perhaps set to be revised.\nZaniolo has scored four times in Serie A this season. He was involved in Udinese’s first disallowed goal on Sunday, powering into Napoli’s half, his thighs working like pistons in a V8 engine. He scored another, only for a foul in the build-up to see it chalked off.\nZaniolo was on the rampage, and if he carries on like this, a recall to the Italy squad for the World Cup play-offs in March isn’t out of the question.\nThe same can be said of Gianluca Scamacca, too. After Ademola Lookman upstaged him with a hat-trick in the 2024 Europa League final, Scamacca missed most of the following season with Atalanta after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament tear. His replacement, Mateo Retegui, then finished Serie A top scorer and accepted a €68million (£59.7m; $80m) move to Al Qadsiah in the Saudi Pro League.\nBack fit, Scamacca is showing glimmers of his form from two years ago when he scored 19 goals in all competitions. Last week, he got the ball rolling in Atalanta’s 2-1 win over ‘world champions’ Chelsea as they climbed to fifth in the Champions League table. On Saturday, they beat Cagliari by the same scoreline thanks to a brace from Scamacca.\nThey remain 12th in Serie A and, quirkily, have as many wins in Europe as in Serie A this season. Their position — and the weekend as a whole — provided a reminder of how competitive the league is this year.\nAdvertisement\nThere are no easy games in Serie A\nPromoted Sassuolo went ahead and then came back to draw 2-2 with Milan at San Siro. Armand Lauriente struck the post and Sassuolo could have won it at the end, as could Milan, in a game blighted by questionable refereeing to the detriment of both sides.\nImperious in the big games, Milan continue to drop points and concede goals against teams they’re expected to beat. Nothing can be taken for granted in this league, as Parma discovered against Lazio.\nIt was 0-0 when Lazio were reduced to 10 men, then nine at the Ennio Tardini. Maurizio Sarri must have felt it was in keeping with their season. “The last five months have been the hardest of my career,” he said.\nLazio were placed under a transfer embargo in the summer when the club failed to comply with Serie A’s equivalent of the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules. Many expected Sarri to quit, but he has too much respect for Lazio owner Claudio Lotito.\n“It’s always best to have a tough president than a foreign investment fund,” Sarri said. “At times it’s best to have a row face-to-face than work for a fund where you don’t know who to talk to.”\nEvery week, the difficulty level went up. The fixture computer dealt Lazio the hardest of starts. They lost players such as Nicolo Rovella to injury and saw red in other games, too. It has been like coaching one game blindfolded, another with his hands tied behind his back, then another upside down.\nParma should have beaten Lazio. Their young coach, Carlos Cuesta, 30, had his opponent right where he wanted them. Instead, Mikel Arteta’s former assistant appeared embarrassed and crestfallen as Tijjani Noslin came on, rounded his goalkeeper and scored an epic winner.\nSarri was asked if he’d ever seen anything like it before. In fact, he had.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s already happened to me,” Sarri said. Thirty years ago, when he’d recently left banking to become a coach at the bottom of the pyramid. “Antella–Figline. We won with eight against 10 men.”\nThe fall and fall of Fiorentina\nIf, at the start of the season, the ghost of Serie A’s future had visited us and prophesied that one of the big clubs would be adrift at the bottom come December, some might have looked at Lazio’s problems and thought: it’ll be them.\nThe team that can’t spend anything, not the one that invested €90m (£79m; $106m).\nFiorentina remain winless in Serie A. They are eight points from safety. This time last year, they were joint top. On Sunday, they lost at home in stoppage time against Hellas Verona, another team battling for survival.\nSince taking over from Stefano Pioli last month, Paolo Vanoli has kept using one word: “Fear”. Fiorentina don’t need reminding of it.\nLast week, the players squabbled over a penalty that Rolando Mandragora converted against Sassuolo. After another defeat, Vanoli claimed Albert Gudmundsson refused to take it. Gudmundsson posted a denial on social media. David de Gea, immense last season, has had a mistake-riddled week.\nConference League wins have fleetingly offered hope, but the team continues to spiral in Serie A.\nRocco Commisso wasn’t the only owner to deny his club was for sale last week. Juventus’ majority shareholder and Agnelli scion John Elkann insisted the club’s values and history were not for sale after his holding company, Exor, unanimously rejected an offer from the stablecoin firm Tether.\nThe Agnellis are football heritage in Italy. Generations have gone to the grave passing Juventus down as a treasured family heirloom. It has always been part of them, just as Genoa was to Sinatra. When Old Blue Eyes passed away, he insisted on being buried in a specific item of clothing: a blue-and-red tie, the colours of his team, the oldest football club in Italy, Genoa CFC. As he faced the final curtain, his way was the Genoano way.",
