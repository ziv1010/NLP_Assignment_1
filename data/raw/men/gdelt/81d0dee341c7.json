And, if you don't end up getting a ticket to go to the final, you can be sure there will be an amazing atmosphere back on home turf.\nEddie Howe's men were in a strong position going into Wednesday night's semi final second leg, after winning the first leg at the Emirates 2-0 and, while their dream start was crushed due to Alexander Isak's goal being chalked off by VAR; United did take the lead shortly after when Jacob Murphy was in the right place at the right time, when Isak then saw an effort come back off the woodwork.\nThings got even better for the Magpies when Anthony Gordon made it 2-0 in the 52nd minute, bringing the aggregate score to a very impressive 4-0 and rubber stamping a return to Wembley for NUFC, two years after they lost out in the Carabao cup final to Manchester United.\nAs supporters hope to land Carabao Cup final tickets, plans have now been revealed for two huge fan zones in the city centre, with one in TImes Square, as part of Paddy Fest and now, another, inside NX, which, like Times Square, has hosted football events on numerous occasions, for the World Cup, Euros, Champions League and last year's FA Cup win over arch rivals Sunderland.\nTickets are on sale now HERE from £11 and organisers are promising a huge 10x7m screen for the big game, flag displays, drink deals and live entertainment pre and post match.",
