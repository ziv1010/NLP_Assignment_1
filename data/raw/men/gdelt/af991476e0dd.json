  "body_text": "The end of the season and the start of the transfer window are getting closer and closer. At Barcelona, a first La Liga title since 2019 is within sight and fans are getting excited about the potential return of club icon Lionel Messi.\nBut nothing at Barcelona is straightforward. The club have their ongoing serious economic problems and a scandal off the pitch to deal with, while their failure to meet La Liga salary rules means they have not even been able to register a new contract for star midfielder Gavi.\nAdvertisement\nAll that will mean another great summer of upheaval in Catalonia. While we are unlikely to see a repeat of last year’s dramatic pulling of so-called financial ‘levers’, thoughts are already turning to raising the funds they need to land their transfer targets — and convince La Liga’s hierarchy they are now on solid financial ground.\nOne way the club will definitely try to address their financial problems is through player sales.\nThe Athletic previously went through the Barcelona first team to analyze which of their players might end up moving on from the Camp Nou this summer, and we will do so again in the near future.\nHere though, we apply the same focus to the crop of their players currently out on loan. How have they fared this season? Which ones have a chance of staying aboard the mothership?\nLet’s take it case by case…\nSamuel Umtiti at Lecce: 18 appearances, 0 goals\nLast August, Umtiti’s arrival in the heel of the boot of Italy was warmly celebrated by Lecce fans, with large crowds chanting his name as he emerged from the airport. The now 29-year-old centre-back, who started for France in their 2018 World Cup final win, was visibly moved by the reception. Struggling through the throng of supporters, he found the microphones of several TV stations ready to capture his first words as a Lecce player.\n🇮🇹 Nouveau joueur de Lecce, Samuel Umtiti a été accueilli en Italie par un véritable bain de foule\n😭 Emu, le champion du monde n'a pu retenir ses larmes pic.twitter.com/PCWgqcAdeB— beIN SPORTS (@beinsports_FR) August 26, 2022\nHe was signed amid questions over his physical condition, having suffered from several knee problems in the years since that World Cup triumph. But Umtiti has overcome injury to start 17 of relegation candidates Lecce’s 23 Serie A games since his debut in early October.\nAdvertisement\nBarcelona are content with the performances of a player whose contract with them expires in summer 2026. “We are following him and we are happy that he has continuity,” head coach Xavi said recently. “He has adapted well to Italian football. He is part of the planning for next season, we will see what we do.”\nThat said, the plan is still to sell him. They do not expect a significant fee for Umtiti — although there have been reports of interest from Serie A heavyweights Roma and Inter Milan. Umtiti has already earned the Catalans more than €500,000 (£443,000; $552,000) by making 15 starts for Lecce, as per the terms of the loan agreement.\nLecce were promoted as Serie B champions last season, and are currently two points above the relegation zone with seven matches to play.\nFrancisco Trincao at Sporting CP: 47 appearances, 12 goals\nWinger Trincao, who spent last season on loan at Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League, has been with Lisbon’s Sporting since the start of this one.\nSporting paid Barcelona a €3million loan fee for the 23-year-old Portugal international and an option to make the deal permanent by paying a further €7m has reportedly already been triggered.\nTrincao moved to the Camp Nou from another Portuguese club, Braga, for €31million three years ago. It has been a disappointing move, however: only 10 of 42 appearances have been starts (just three in La Liga), he has three goals and two assists, and he has not played for the Spanish giants since May 2021.\nIn less than nine months at Sporting, he has already played over double the minutes he has for his parent club, scoring 12 goals and providing three assists in 3,013 minutes across all competitions.\nTrincao seems more settled back in his homeland and Xavi is not counting on him for next season.\nSporting are fourth in the Primeira Liga, seven points off third-placed Braga, with the top three qualifying for next season’s Champions League.\nAdvertisement\nClement Lenglet at Tottenham Hotspur: 30 appearances, one goal\nLenglet was one of the first of many players to leave Barcelona last summer when he joined Tottenham on loan — although he was not the north London club’s first-choice option to improve the centre-back position. Since then, he has made 19 Premier League starts plus two substitute appearances, while he started six of Spurs’ eight Champions League games, scoring a goal against Marseille in the group stage.\nThe 27-year-old France international’s future is still undecided. Tottenham do not seem willing to keep him, and Barcelona want to sell. Lenglet has largely met expectations at Spurs without excelling for a side who find themselves in crisis as they look for a permanent replacement for sacked head coach Antonio Conte and sacked interim replacement Cristian Stellini.\nAbde Ezzalzouli at Osasuna: 29 appearances, five goals\nKnown commonly as Abde, the Morocco winger played a part in his country’s surprise fourth-placed finish at the World Cup last year and has shone on loan at Barcelona’s fellow La Liga side Osasuna.\nThe 21-year-old has played 29 times for the Pamplona-based club: 24 in La Liga and five in the Copa del Rey, where Osasuna are through to the final against Real Madrid on May 6. He has started 15 times in La Liga, scoring three goals and providing two assists, while contributing two crucial goals to their Copa del Rey run. The first was a 99th-minute winner against Sevilla in the quarter-finals; the other was the only goal of the game in their semi-final first-leg win at home to Athletic Bilbao.\nAbde will hope to inspire Osasuna to a first Copa del Rey win in only their second final appearance — they were beaten finalists in 2005. Victory over Madrid would bring Europa League group-stage qualification. They are also eighth in La Liga with seven games to go, five points off the sixth place that brings a Europa Conference League spot.\nAbde’s position is perhaps the least clear of the players summarised in this piece.\nOf all Barcelona’s loanees, he is the most likely to feature in Xavi’s thinking for next season because he is a left winger, a position that needs reinforcing and where Ansu Fati has struggled to shine. The club would not rule out selling Fati if a good offer arrives for the 20-year-old.\nBut they may also look at selling Abde, too, given that his value has risen with his fine performances this season. The club may consider cashing in on him because he is a homegrown player, so any sale would represent 100 per cent profit for them.\nFor now, Xavi plans on making that decision during pre-season.\nAdvertisement\n“In the summer, he will come back, we will look at him, evaluate him and decide what we are going to do,” Xavi said in early April. “I think he can be an important player in the future. We’ll see.”\nSergino Dest at AC Milan: 14 appearances, 0 goals\nThings have not worked out well for Dest since he moved to AC Milan on deadline day last September. The 22-year-old United States right-back has made just eight Serie A appearances (only two of them have been starts) and the Italian champions have already decided not to exercise their option to make the move permanent in June.\nDest, whose Barcelona contract runs until the summer of 2025, was injured in January and has not played for Milan since — although he did play the full 90 minutes for his country both in a Nations League tie against El Salvador last month and in a friendly with Mexico last week.\nSigned to provide competition for Davide Calabria after Alessandro Florenzi was injured in late August, Dest has rarely played — even when Calabria has also been out. His Serie A debut, against Napoli in September, set the tone for his loan spell: he came on at half-time and after 10 minutes gave away a penalty which put the now champions-elect on their way to a 2-1 away win.\nBarcelona are frustrated by the situation as they had hoped Dest would impress and increase his value on the transfer market. The plan now is for him to return to his parent club this summer and they will then look for a new destination for him as he does not feature in Xavi’s plans, even if Barcelona need reinforcements at right-back. Recent reports have linked Dest with a loan move to Union Berlin for next season.\nDest fell out of favour with Xavi after a Champions League defeat away to Bayern Munich last season in which he started and was substituted at half-time with Barcelona 2-0 down. Xavi considers him short of the standards he would like in terms of reading and understanding the game.\nMilan are fourth in the table, in a five-team battle for two Champions League qualification spots, although they also face city rivals Inter in next month’s Champions League semi-finals.\nAdvertisement\nNico Gonzalez at Valencia: 18 appearances, one goal\nHere’s another La Masia graduate whose future is undecided. Widely known as Nico, the now 21-year-old was promoted to the first team at the same time as Gavi and signed a new contract until 2026 before being shipped off to fellow La Liga side Valencia on a season’s loan in August.\nNico is a defensive midfielder who excelled in Barcelona’s youth ranks, prompting then-coach Ronald Koeman to take a chance on the youngster. The backing of his former youth coach Francisco Javier Garcia Pimienta, now in charge at second division Las Palmas, also helped Nico, who made 37 first-team appearances for Barcelona in all competitions last season, mostly from the bench.\nWhen Nico realised his opportunities would be more limited this season, he asked for a loan to continue his development. But he has been unable to nail down a regular place at Valencia, with a metatarsal fracture keeping him out from early January to March.\nThe Mestalla club are in danger of being relegated. They sit two points above the drop zone.\nThere has been interest from elsewhere in Nico, including domestically from Sevilla, and Barcelona are contemplating cashing in on him. As with Abde, they would receive 100 per cent profit from any sale of the academy product.\nAlex Collado at Elche: 14 appearances, one goal\nCollado, a 24-year-old Barcelona-trained winger, has played in 12 La Liga games and two Copa del Rey matches for a total of 656 minutes in all competitions at Elche this season. He has scored one goal and provided one assist.\nElche are bottom of the league with just 13 points and onto their sixth manager of the season, including those who have taken temporary charge. Collado himself was injured for three months from early January, which has not helped his progress either.\nAdvertisement\nHis Barcelona contract expires after next season and he would like to return to the club to try to impress in pre-season, but the chances of him forcing his way into Xavi’s plans are slim. Another loan or a permanent transfer seems the most likely option here — Collado is said to have offers from clubs in Italy, Greece and Portugal, along with one from a La Liga side.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
