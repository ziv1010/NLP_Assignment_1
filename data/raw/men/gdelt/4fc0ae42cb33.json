Ethan’s first two goals came against Bolton Wanderers in the League Cup and he added another, a spectacular effort from distance, at Preston North End in the next round, before netting his first Premier League goal against Nottingham Forest in November.\nIn January, Ethan became only the third player (after Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney) to score three Premier League goals before his 18th birthday, shortly before he opened his Champions League account at Girona.\nEthan said: “Signing this contract means everything to me. I see this as my first real season in men’s senior football, as part of the squad in the changing room. I’m so excited for what I can bring to the team, I want to help us win as much as possible and bring happiness and glory to the club. This is where I feel at home.”\nEthan’s new contract is subject to the completion of regulatory processes.",
