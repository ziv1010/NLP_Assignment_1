  "body_text": "Group F at the Club World Cup features a slight favorite in the form of Borussia Dortmund but could throw up its fair share of surprises.\nDortmund endured a disappointing Bundesliga campaign that picked up pace only in the final weeks. They are joined by Brazilian side Fluminense, South Africa’s Mamelodi Sundowns and South Korea’s Ulsan HD.\nAdvertisement\nFluminense’s history as one of Brazil’s most successful clubs — with 42 major trophies — makes them the consensus pick for a top-two finish with Dortmund. Their 2023 Copa Libertadores win sealed their berth at the Club World Cup.\nBut the Sundowns recently secured their eighth straight South African Premiership title and qualified for this tournament through their CAF ranking between 2021 and 2024. Ulsan, meanwhile, have won three consecutive league titles, though a fourth looks unlikely as they trail leaders Jeonbuk by six points in the K League 1 having played two games more.\nHere, The Athletic picks out the group favorites, the fun facts, and the storylines to watch.\nFixtures\n(All kick-offs ET/BST)\nJune 17: Fluminense vs Borussia Dortmund (New Jersey — 12pm/5pm)\nJune 17: Ulsan HD vs Mamelodi Sundowns (Orlando — 6pm/11pm)\nJune 21: Mamelodi Sundowns vs Borussia Dortmund (Cincinnati — 12pm/5pm)\nJune 21: Fluminense vs Ulsan HD (New Jersey — 6pm/11pm)\nJune 25: Borussia Dortmund vs Ulsan HD (Cincinnati — 3pm/8pm)\nJune 25: Mamelodi Sundowns vs Fluminense (Florida — 3pm/8pm)\nThe favorite is…\nDortmund.\nThe 2024-25 season, which followed a Champions League runners-up finish, was a disappointing for the most part. Former player Nuri Sahin could not build on the foundations laid by Edin Terzic, leading to his sacking in January with the team well outside the Champions League places and ousted from the DFB-Pokal in the second round by Wolfsburg.\nNiko Kovac initially struggled to impose himself but Dortmund turned a corner in the final months to finish the league season with seven wins and a draw. They nearly pulled off a Champions League miracle in the quarter-finals after losing the first leg 4-0 against Barcelona — by winning the second leg 3-1.\nA season that looked lost ended in a fourth-place finish, securing Champions League football for next season. The summer could bring changes, the biggest being the potential sale of Jamie Gittens, with The Athletic reporting last weekend that Chelsea had approached Dortmund for the Englishman’s signature.\nAdvertisement\nTheir main challengers in Group F are Fluminense, who have seasoned professionals in Thiago Silva, Ganso, Jhon Arias and German Cano in their ranks. The Sundowns and Ulsan could cause a few problems too but Dortmund should have enough to finish ahead of all three.\nThe standout match is likely to be…\nFluminense vs Dortmund.\nGroup F kicks off with this meeting between the potential table-toppers, setting the scene for the rest of the fixtures. This has the potential to be a goal-laden game too.\nDortmund have scored 44 goals in 20 matches under Kovac, hitting Union Berlin for six and scoring four past each of Bayer Leverkusen, Freiburg and Wolfsburg. In Serhou Guirassy, they have a prolific striker who often finds the net even if he can be wasteful. Guirassy has scored 15 times in his last 15 club games.\nKovac has alternated between a four-man and three-man defence, with the latter approach providing some solidity, but the bigger change he has brought is in intensity. Dortmund excel in transition given the pace they have upfront, ahead of midfield technicians like Pascal Gross, Julian Brandt and Felix Nmecha.\nFluminense, meanwhile, have scored 26 times in 17 matches across the Brazilian league and Copa Sudamericana. They changed their coach in April, opting to bring back Renato Gaucho for his sixth spell at the helm. His 15 matches in charge have seen him use a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 formation, resulting in 10 wins.\nGaucho often gets one of his full-backs to invert into midfield while the other stays in a wider position and is instructed to overlap the winger, who drifts in-field. He favors a high press, often going man-to-man, but could use a different style given the quality advantage Dortmund possess.\nThe group’s galactico\nDortmund have layers of quality in their ranks. Apart from the names mentioned above, they have Niklas Sule, Waldemar Anton, Marcel Sabitzer, Emre Can, Karim Adeyemi, Maximilian Beier and Julien Duranville. Their squad value on Transfermarkt of €455.9million dwarfs the next best, Fluminense (€76.65m).\nAdvertisement\nSilva headlines the Brazilian side’s squad, which, apart from the names mentioned above, includes former Liverpool under-21s goalkeeper Marcelo Pitaluga. Plenty of younger players will want to make a mark too. Midfielders Ruben Lezcano and Hercules and wingers Joaquin Lavega and Riquelme Felipe are among the ones to watch.\nThe Sundowns’ squad, valued at €35.25m, boasts several South Africa internationals, including experienced midfielder Themba Zwane, 35, and goalkeeper Ronwen Williams, 33. Namibia international Peter Shalulile has 49 international caps.\nLastly, Ulsan boast one of the most experienced international players in center back Kim Young-gwon, who has 112 caps for South Korea. Their €15.1m-valued squad includes former Hammarby duo, midfielder Darijan Bojanic and winger Gustav Ludwigson, and former Barcelona and Lazio youth product Matias Lacava.\nThe player who could make a name for themselves…\nArthur Sales was one of Mamelodi Sundowns’ standout players in his debut season, making 16 goal contibutions (eights goals, eight assists) in 19 league games. Sales, who turns 23 next month, can score with either foot, with his best goal coming against Chippa United on May 14.\nPicking the ball up on the right wing, the Brazilian dribbled forward and cut away from his defender before scoring from a nigh-on impossible angle via the far-post. It may have been unintentional, but added to his catalogue that included stooping headers, acrobatic volleys and near-post thunderbolts.\nThere is an opposition quality perspective to consider given the Sundowns’ superiority in South Africa but Sales broke through at Vasco da Gama in Brazil and has some European experience. He played for Lommel in Belgium, scoring 10 goals in the Belgian second tier in the 2023-24 season before joining the Sundowns, and Pacos Ferreira in Portugal. An impressive Club World Cup might lead him back to Europe.\nA story to look out for\nDortmund are set to include 16-year-old Mathis Albert in their squad for the Club World Cup. Albert, who has been capped four times by the USA’s under-17 team, is a talented forward who scored 10 times in the 2024-25 season, including a goal in their 3-2 UEFA Youth League defeat to Sturm Graz.\nAdvertisement\nGiven his age, the idea might simply be to have him train with the first team. But Kovac is sure to receive questions about Albert in press conferences, particularly from American journalists. If Dortmund win their first two group-stage games, there might be some clamoring for at least a cameo from Albert in the third match.\nYou might not know this but…\nFluminense’s current home ground might be the Maracana but they played at the Estadio das Laranjeiras in Rio de Janeiro in their initial years. The ground hosted the first-ever match played by Brazil’s men’s team — a friendly against English club side Exeter City in July 1914.\nBrazil won 2-0, with the first goal — of the match and in their history — being scored by Oswaldo Gomes, who won eight Campeonato Carioca titles with Fluminense between 1906 and 1919.\nFluminense also provided Brazil’s first-ever World Cup goalscorer in 1930 when Joao Coelho Neto, better known as Preguinho, scored in a 2-1 defeat by Yugoslavia, who had not won an international match before that. Yugoslavia beat the other team in the group, Bolivia, 4-0 to qualify for the semi-finals as the table-topper.\nBrazil also beat Bolivia 4-0 in the final group meeting, with Preguinho scoring twice.",
