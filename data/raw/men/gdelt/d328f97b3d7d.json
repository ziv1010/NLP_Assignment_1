  "body_text": "The second game of Sunday, Aug. 31 is the third game of Week 1 between two top 10 teams as the No. 6 Notre Dame Fighting Irish visit the No. 10 Miami Hurricanes at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.\nThe game is scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m. EDT and will be broadcast on ABC.

Coach Marcus Freeman led his team to a 14-2 record, with the first loss coming in a shocking September upset at home to Northern Illinois. The Fighting Irish defeated seven ranked opponents last season, including three in the top 10, all in the College Football Playoffs.\nThe Hurricanes missed out on the playoffs last year and ended their season with a 42-41 loss to Iowa State in the Pop-Tarts Bowl. The team went 10-3, with the three losses all coming in its final four games. First was a loss to Georgia Tech, 28-23 on the road. Then, once again on the road, Miami fell to another conference foe, as Syracuse earned a 42-38 win to ruin the Hurricanes’ playoff hopes. For the second straight year Miami is leaning on one of if not the top quarterback transfer to lead the team. Last year, Cameron Ward was an All-American and then became the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft, now former Georgia signal caller Carson Beck takes the reins and hopes to actually play in the Playoffs, something he couldn’t do last season with Georgia because of an injury in the SEC Championship, or the year prior, because of a loss in the SEC Championship.\nWho: No. 6 Notre Dame Fighting Irish vs. No. 10 Miami Hurricanes\nWhen: Sunday, Aug. 31 at 7:30 p.m. EDT\nWhere: Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.\nStream: DirecTV (free trial); FuboTV; SlingTV; ESPN+\nBetting: Check out our MA sports betting guide, where you can learn basic terminology, definitions and how to read odds for those interested in learning how to bet in Massachusetts.\nWhat is DirecTV?\nDirecTV is an internet TV service that offers your favorite entertainment, news and sports channels, as well as local TV stations and regional sports networks.
