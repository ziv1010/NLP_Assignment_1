That was the only goal in the first half.\nThe goal was a big relief for Ntopwa as it spared the blushes of midfielder Funny Magombo, who had just missed a penalty that resulted from striker Linda Kasenda being tackled in the box.\nAnother loanee from Civil Service United Women Linda Kasenda could have doubled the lead in the 72nd minute when she found herself in a one-on-one situation with LDF goalkeeper, but her effort went agonisingly wide.\nDisaster struck for the Ban gwe Township-based side in the 86th minute when LDF restored parity after Ntopwa defender Olivia Phikani gifted striker Maseriti Mohlolo a goal.\nIt was a seemingly harmless ball and Phikani just needed to clear from the danger area, but she made a weak pass towards her goalkeeper Mercy Sikelo before Mohlolo pounced and dribbled past the goal-minder to coolly slot it home.\nNtopwa dominated play and had more scoring chances, but failed to make them count. They had four shots on target against LDF three.\nNtopwa’s next match will be against defending champions Green Buffaloes of Zambia tomorrow from 3.30pm. Their last group match will be against Double Action Ladies of Botswana on Monday.\nIn a post-match interview, Chikupira, who was named player of the match, said: “It felt good to score my first goal at an international club competition, but it was just unfortunate to concede a late equaliser.”\nOn his part, Ntopwa coach James Sangala said: “It is just unfortunate that we failed to collect maximum points after controlling of the game. Nevertheless, that is football, we just have to be more resolute in our next games.”\nThe Top two teams from each of the two groups will advance to the semi-finals. Only winners of the qualifiers, played in round-robin format, will represent the Cosafa region in Ivory Coast.",
