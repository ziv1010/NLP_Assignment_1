  "body_text": "Harry Maguire’s absence from the England squad continues with Thomas Tuchel revealing his reasons for picking Chelsea’s Trevoh Chalobah over the Manchester United star.\nTuchel’s squad for upcoming games against Andorra and Senegal in June was revealed on Friday morning.\nMaguire, a permanent fixture in the team under Gareth Southgate, missed Euro 2024 last summer due to injury and was left out of Tuchel’s first squad earlier this year.\nIn March, Tuchel suggested his omission was primarily on the grounds of form. Maguire has been part of a United squad that has floundered in the Premier League, losing 18 of 37 Premier League games this term.\nThe 32-year-old did shine however in the club’s run to the Europa League final – also contributing up the other end of the pitch. That campaign ended with a devastating defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao on Wednesday.\nWith Marc Guehi missing out as a result of the eye injury he suffered in Crystal Palace’s FA Cup triumph, Chalobah was named in the squad alongside Ezri Konsa, Dan Burn and Chelsea teammate Levi Colwill.\nWith Wesley Fofana out for the season, Chalobah has formed a reliable partnership with Colwill at the heart of the Blues’ defence since being recalled from Palace in January, playing the full 90 minutes in nine of their 16 league matches since his return.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nWhile Tuchel insisted Maguire remains in his long-term plans, he explained Chalobah’s fine form was the difference.\n‘He [Maguire] is always in my thoughts because he covers the position as a centre-back but also as a no9!’ Tuchel joked.\nMore Trending\n‘He is always in our thoughts, he is a big personality and he steps up in difficult times as you can see with his club. At the moment, Ezri keeps his place, Dan Burn as a left keeps his place, Marc who is more happy to on the left, has an injury, so we decided with another left footer with Levi Colwill.\n‘We see at this moment, Trevoh is ahead of Harry. I think I have a very clear picture of what Harry can do, what he represents and what he will bring to the squad.\n‘I’m not so clear with how Trevoh will behave in this environment so this is where it is. Performance wise, Trevoh is a step ahead at the moment. He is involved in a campaign fighting for the Champions League.’\nElsewhere in the squad, Ivan Toney is back in the squad after being selected ahead of Dominic Solanke.\nMORE: Champions League permutations for five Premier League clubs on final day tomorrow\nMORE: Thomas Tuchel gives update on Ben White’s England future after latest snub\nMORE: Enzo Maresca sends clear transfer message to Real Madrid amid Enzo Fernandez speculation",
