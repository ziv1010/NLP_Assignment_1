I’m taking everything in - it’s a bit different to England in 2022.\n“I’m excited but also so much has changed so I’m intrigued.”\nReady to start our #WEURO2025 journey together.\n— Lionesses (@Lionesses) July 4, 2025\nSee you tomorrow, #Lionesses fans 🤝 pic.twitter.com/SaKCoNeTnI\nIn just her second major tournament, having first travelled to France for the 2019 World Cup, Williamson captained the Lionesses to their first major tournament trophy,\nIn 2022, she formed a formidable defensive pairing with Millie Bright in a tournament during which her reading of the game meant she won the ball more than any other player despite making no tackles.\nWith Bright absent in Switzerland, it is Manchester City’s Alex Greenwood who will partner Williamson at the back, creating a new dynamic in the England defence.\n“Physicality is the main difference. Millie is blessed in ways that people like me and Alex are probably not so we have to talk in different ways,” explained Williamson.\n“Alex is an exceptional ball player, she sees things that not many do. She’s always at such high performance. When you play next to someone like that she demands so much of herself and naturally of you too.\n“Her experience and everything about Al, she’s one of my best mates so I have a good time playing but she’s also one of those players that you don’t want to let down.”\nBut those partnerships are not the only thing that have changed. Since her ACL, Williamson has not only added a Champions League title to her CV, but built invaluable experience in an ever-involving women’s football environment.\nShe was just 25 at the last Euros, and though this summer’s competition in Switzerland will represent only a third major tournament outing, Williamson has become part of the fabric of Wiegman’s squad.\nNow it is her that younger players like Grace Clinton, Aggie Beever-Jones and Jess Park who are experiencing their first tournament with England look to for advice.\n“The game has changed a lot since the experienced members played their first, like the whole landscape of women’s football so we have to take that into account when we speak to them,” she said.\n“It’s giving them as much freedom to enjoy the experience but know that they’re ready to perform and make their mark on the pitch.\n“I would never want anyone to be so anxious it consumed them but we’re here and ultimately the main focus is on the pitch.\n“And from being out on the training pitch everyone’s focus is football first.”",
