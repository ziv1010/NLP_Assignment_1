It’s special, and that makes it not calm.”\nVeteran midfielder Luka Modric said despite Madrid’s strength in contrast to Dortmund, he was approaching the match as if it were an even battle.\n“Everyone thinks we are big favourites, but we don’t think about it like that,” said the Croatian.\n“It’s 50-50, we’re playing a big team that has had a magnificent season in the Champions League.”\nNacho and Modric, along with Toni Kroos and Dani Carvajal, would reach six career Champions League wins with a victory over Dortmund, leveling all-time leader and former Madrid great Paco Gento.\n“It was hard to imagine we’d get to this moment but we are here, very happy and enjoying this moment,” said Modric.\n“I hope tomorrow we can take this step further, as a team and having six European Cups would be something big.”\n‘Something special’\nMadrid came from behind to beat Bayern Munich in the semi-finals and have a remarkable ability to turn games around in Europe when it seems like they are defeated.\n“We prefer to take the lead if it’s possible,” said Modric.\n“But we’ve shown many times this year and before, that when things don’t go well we fight until the end.\n“We always find a way, we’re capable of turning the game around. We keep having this mentality, this commitment and fight, but like I said, we’d prefer to take the lead.”\nAncelotti said Madrid’s ability to come back from the dead “has happened so many times it’s not chance”.\n“It’s something special… it could be the history, the quality, the tradition, the character,” he mused.\nThe coach confirmed goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois would start the final ahead of Andriy Lunin, resolving the main selection query ahead of the game.\n“Lunin had the flu and hasn’t travelled with the team, tomorrow he will travel and will be on the bench — Courtois will play tomorrow,” said Ancelotti.\nBelgian stopper Courtois returned from a long-term knee injury earlier in May and has kept four clean sheets in four appearances since.\nAFP",
