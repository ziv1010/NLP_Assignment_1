Southgate’s name has been linked with the job – he’s the 8/1 third favourite with William Hill and Betfair – and the longer it takes the Old Trafford board to offer clarification, the greater the distraction for the Football Association and the Three Lions camp.\nMore Trending\nBosnia failed to qualify for the Euros after winning just three of their group matches, with two of those successes coming against Liechtenstein, they have lost their last four games and have not won an international friendly away from home in six years.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nIt’s the ideal opportunity for Southgate to run the rule over the fringe players battling to book their flights to Germany and that means a trio of Crystal Palace stars being given a start with Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton and Marc Guehi trying to impress after finishing the season strongly with Eagles.\nIt will be interesting to see if Harry Kane starts as he is in need of playing time after missing the last couple of weeks of Bayern Munich’s Bundesliga season with a back injury.\nBut it may be that he is kept on the bench until Friday so Ollie Watkins can show what he can do in the spotlight and the Aston Villa striker is 3/1 with BoyleSports, Bet Victor, Sky Bet and William Hill to open scoring and 3/4 with Ladbrokes and Coral to hit the net at any time. Eze is 9/5 with Bet Victor to get on the scoresheet and a 4-0 romp is 9/1 with Paddy Power, Betfair and BoyleSports.\n• Alexander Zverev, our ante-post selection, is 7/5 with BetUK and Unibet to make French Open progress by beating Holger Rune by over 5.5 games as the second week at Roland Garros gets underway. Aryna Sabalenka is in flying form and is 10/11 with bet365 to beat Emma Navarro in straight sets.\n• Back Aiden Markram at 4/1 with Ladbrokes and Coral to be South Africa’s top batter when they face Sri Lanka in the first heavyweight battle of the T20 World Cup. Angelo Mathews is 9/1 with the same firms, Paddy Power and Betfair to be Sri Lanka’s top runscorer.\nMORE: How Jude Bellingham went from boy wonder to Champions League winner\nMORE: England captain Harry Kane receiving treatment for back injury in Euro 2024 scare",
