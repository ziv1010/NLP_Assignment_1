Is that because Rüdiger is playing?\n“He’s on the bench, so he can’t be injured. I never went to see the manager on the morning of a game and said I’m not fit.\n“So he’s injured, is he? It’s Rüdiger-itis, is it? Is that what we’re saying here?”\nIn Haaland’s absence, new signing Omar Marmoush led Man City’s attack against Carlo Ancelotti’s side.",
