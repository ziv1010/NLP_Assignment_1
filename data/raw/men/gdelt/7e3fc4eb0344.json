Emerson and Pablo Fornals came into his side, replacing Aaron Cresswell and Said Benrahma.\nWe will bring you all the action and updates from today's game in the live blog below:\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United LIVE: Premier League updates\nFT!

(@CPFC) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:53\nThat's all for today, goodbye!\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:52\nThat win lifts Palace up to 11th place, now on 40 points, and although they're not mathematically safe, that should be enough to keep them up. They travel to Tottenham next weekend. As for West Ham, they stay in 15th, five points above the drop zone. They play their game in hand against Manchester City in midweek.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:51\nPalace see out a 4-3 win over West Ham. It was the visitors that took the lead in the ninth minute, with Soucek firing in from a corner, but three goals from Ayew, Zaha and Schlupp turned things on their head. Antonio did pull one back from another corner just before the break. Palace were the dominant side throughout and got their fourth from the spot after Eze slotted it in after winning the penalty. Aguerd glanced in another corner for West Ham, but they couldn't find an all-important equaliser.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:47\nFULL-TIME: CRYSTAL PALACE 4-3 WEST HAM.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:46\nA frustrating afternoon at Selhurst Park. pic.twitter.com/khAZMVZYwq\n— West Ham United (@WestHam) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:46\nRice hooks it forward once more, but Palace clear their lines and Schlupp carries it far upfield to take the pressure off his team.

The visitors win another corner though, but this one is played over Soucek and Doucoure clears his lines.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:39\nInto six minutes of stoppage time here, and West Ham are on the back foot once more. Eze and Olise link up well down the right side, but they're in no hurry to put it in the box at the moment.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:36\nAndersen's big switch is cut out by Coufal, but he heads it straight to Schlupp. He tries to drive into the box, only to find his path blocked by Ogbonna.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:36\n🔁 Cornet comes on for Antonio.\n🦅 4-3 ⚒️ (89') | @Scope_Markets pic.twitter.com/71TaFZpbIt— West Ham United (@WestHam) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:36\nSubstitution Michail Gregory Antonio Gnaly Albert Maxwel Cornet\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:34\nPalace win a corner and it's a better delivery from Olise this time.

He's back to his feet quickly though, and he'll be able to carry on.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:25\nCoufal puts another long throw-in into the box an Ogbonna flicks it on. West Ham have bodies in the box, but the defender can't pick one out, and Andersen clears his lines this time.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:23\nWest Ham are patiently playing out from the back again until Cresswell goes the big switch out to Bowen. He nods it down for Ings, but he can't in front of Guehi, who hooks it away.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:22\nA VAR check confirms Aguerd's header stands! It comes from another Souček flick on from a corner.\nBig final 15 minutes coming up! ⚒️ https://t.co/PRGbLr5KWV— West Ham United (@WestHam) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:21\nANOTHER SET-PIECE GOAL!\n🦅 4-3 ⚒️ (73') pic.twitter.com/3m2fixtSfu— West Ham United (@WestHam) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:20\nGoal.

He's judged to foul Mitchell as he goes up for the aerial challenge and another West Ham attack fizzles out.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:17\nWest Ham are keeping possession well, but it's all in their own half.

The penalty stands, much to West Ham's frustration.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:11\nPENALTY TO PALACE! It's fizzed into Eze's feet on the edge of the box and his first touch just knocks it past Aguerd. The defender sticks out an arm which sends him down and the referee points to the spot after a moment's thought.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:11\nPenalty to Crystal Palace.\n🦅 3-2 ⚒️ (63')— West Ham United (@WestHam) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:10\nWest Ham are still struggling to get upfield when they do win possession back.

He clips his second attempt into the six-yard box, but Soucek gets in front of Ayew to clear it.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:05\nYellow Card Vladimír Coufal\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:04\nWest Ham found themselves behind at half-time in a Premier League away game having scored the first goal for the first time since November 2009 against Hull City (3-2 down at the break, finished 3-3).\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:01\n❤️💙#CPFC | #CRYWHU pic.twitter.com/AcyU7vCsbo\n— Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:01\nGREAT SAVE! Ayew gets the better of Aguerd as he spins away from it and tees up Olise just outside the box. He takes it around Cresswell before curling a shot towards the far top corner, and Fabianski stretches to tip it over.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n14:00\nOlise tries to shake off Cresswell with some clever footwork and gets a yard on him to swing in a cross. It's a poor one though, and it sails over everyone and harmlessly out of play.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:58\nWest Ham break quickly on the counter, but their passing is still letting them down when they get into Palace's half. Bowen tries to slide it forward for Antonio, but it's behind him.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:56\nOlise's free-kick from the right is only half-cleared by West Ham, and the hosts work it out to Zaha on the left. He pulls it back to Schlupp inside the D, but he's off-balance as he strikes it, and it's a comfortable save for Fabianski.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:55\n🔁 A second change down the left with Benrahma on for Fornals.\n🦅 3-2 ⚒️ (46') | @Scope_Markets pic.twitter.com/tfIIJKailG— West Ham United (@WestHam) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:54\n🔁 The first of two changes at the break as Cress replaces Emerson.\n🦅 3-2 ⚒️ (46') | @Scope_Markets pic.twitter.com/jl5HVsckAt— West Ham United (@WestHam) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:53\nBack for the second half.\nLet's get back into this, Hammers ⚒️— West Ham United (@WestHam) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:52\nWest Ham get us back underway for the second half!\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:52\nSubstitution Emerson Palmieri dos Santos Aaron William Cresswell\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:48\nPalace were the better side, but Hodgson will still be looking for improvements in their defending, especially from corners. They look a real threat every time they go forward though. Moyes' frustration with his own side's defensive work was clear to see and he'll be urging for much more from them after the break.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:43\nWe would like to sincerely apologise to supporters who were affected by our turnstile failure earlier today, which led to the delay to kick-off. A full investigation is underway.#CPFC | #CRYWHU\n— Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:42\nIt was a brilliant first half of football, which sees Palace leading West Ham 3-2 at the break. It was the visitors that took the lead with the first shot of the game as Soucek fired in from a corner after Olise's poor clearance. Palace quickly turned it around though, with Ayew equalising just five minutes before Zaha fired them ahead. Schlupp added a third, pouncing on a mistake from Soucek, but Antonio pulled one back not long after when he thumped in a header.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:38\nHALF-TIME: CRYSTAL PALACE 3-2 WEST HAM.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:37\nA dramatic first-half, but we lead at the break ✅#CPFC | #CRYWHU pic.twitter.com/k8Hm1TF7T9\n— Crystal Palace F.C.

Olise's free-kick pinballs around in the box and falls to Schlupp, who lets it bounce before hitting the half-volley. It's blocked by Aguerd in the middle, and Andersen can't control it on the rebound.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:35\nEmerson slid in on Olise and though he got the ball, a free-kick goes against him for the follow-through. West Ham aren't happy with the decision, but their arguments won't change the referee's mind.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:32\nPalace win a free-kick just inside their own half, but it doesn't stop Guehi from trying to look for Olise's run between the defenders. He just gets too much on it though, and Fabianski comfortably collects.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:30\nAnother sloppy pass from the visitors sees them lose possession on the halfway line, and Doucoure spins before spreading it out to Zaha again. He drives past Coufal before pulling it back from the byline, but Ogbonna just gets in front of Ayew.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:29\n😍😍😍#CPFC | #CRYWHU pic.twitter.com/qdhpDZBZCD\n— Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:28\nPalace switch it neatly from right to left once more, with Zaha picking out Mitchell's overlapping run. He has two in the middle to aim for, but his low cross is cut out by Coufal on the near side.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:26\nAyew has now reached 50 direct goal involvements in the Premier League (33 goals and 17 assists); he has four goal involvements in his last six games, one more than in his previous 33 combined.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:25\nThere are half-hearted shouts for a penalty from the Palace fans behind the goal as Eze goes down under pressure from Ogbonna. There isn't a lot in it though and the referee points for a goal-kick.\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:23\nAntonio gets us back into it, heading home from a Souček flick on at a corner. https://t.co/MzmWljZ3BZ\n— West Ham United (@WestHam) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:22\nAssist Tomáš SouÄek\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:22\nCOME ON MICK!\n🦅 3-2 ⚒️ (36') pic.twitter.com/9iVQcRg8oz— West Ham United (@WestHam) April 29, 2023\nCrystal Palace vs West Ham United\n13:22\nGoal.
