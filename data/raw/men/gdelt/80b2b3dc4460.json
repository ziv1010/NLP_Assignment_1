In each of those three games, Mikel Arteta’s side have been undone on set pieces.\n‘The two goals were soft goals,’ Wright told Premier League Productions. ‘I don’t want to dig the boys out because I know what is coming and I know how much it means to them. But at the same time you do need to out in a better performance than that.’\nAssessing Bournemouth’s goals, Wright accused Arsenal of ‘not looking at the player who was about to score’ with that issue also at play for the second goal.\nWhile there was a suggestion of handball before Evanilson scored, Wright suggested Odegaard, who was marking the Brazilian, was not in the right position.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘For the first goal, I think it’s a really good goal from where he is but the marking,’ Wright continued.\n‘Both defenders are not looking at the player who is about to score. That was really strange to see especially when you know how diligent Arsenal are with their defensive work but not this season they haven’t been as good from set pieces.\n‘So to see them concede two goals like that at this stage of the season is disappointing, I know they are knackered, they must be physically and mentally but they have to go for that last push. They have to finish it off.\n‘When you look at that second goal, no one challenges. The ball is great but if you look at Odegaard he is not looking at the ball he is reacting off the man.\n‘If he is faced around, maybe the same as Lewis-Skelly he can have a better opportunity to move into a position to stop that. He can’t see anything even if it has come off his arm.\n‘It is a concern. The biggest concern though is how static we were. We don’t have Gabriel to organise things and be a bit more aggressive. But the way we were in those incidents, no one seemed to be doing anything. it seemed very easy. It is poor defending.’\nMore Trending\nArsenal suffered a 1-0 defeat to PSG at the Emirates last Tuesday and head to the French capital for the second leg on Wednesday.\nDespite a demoralising result on Saturday, Wright believes there is still enough fight for the Gunners to turn things around and reach the Champions League final.\nAsked if Arsenal can still do it, Wright said: ‘Yes they can’.\nMORE: Mikel Arteta confirms huge Arsenal injury blow for PSG amid Martin Odegaard concern\nMORE: Ralf Rangnick sends warning to ‘significantly worse’ Man Utd ahead of Athletic Bilbao clash\nMORE: Arsenal or PSG?
