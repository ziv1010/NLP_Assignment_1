  "body_text": "Ange Postecoglou has aimed a thinly-veiled swipe at Arsenal and their European exit this week after Tottenham set up an all-English Europa League final against Manchester United.\nSpurs sealed a 2-0 win away to Bodo Glimt on Thursday night, beating the Norwegian outfit 5-1 on aggregate.\nUnited joined them with a huge aggregate victory of their own, putting four past Athletic Bilbao after conceding early at Old Trafford to progress 7-1 across two legs.\nUnited and Spurs have endured disastrous Premier League campaigns, currently sat 15th and 16th respectively with hopes for a top 10 finish long gone.\nBut in reaching the Europa League final, both have the chance to salvage some unlikely silverware and secure qualification for next season’s Champions League.\nWith English clubs dominating the Europa League, no Premier League side will be involved in this year’s Champions League final after Arsenal crashed out against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday.\nThe French champions also dumped Liverpool and Aston Villa out of the competition with Manchester City also beaten in Paris before crashing out of the competition at the play-off round against Real Madrid.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nSpeaking after the win in Norway, Postecoglou suggested two teams so off the pace in the league reaching the final and will ‘upset a lot of people’ – with Arsene Wenger this week suggesting the winners of the competition should not be qualifying for the Champions League.\nImplying Tottenham’s critics are trying to play down their European run, the Spurs boss insisted the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal and City should try reaching a final ‘if it’s so easy’.\n‘It’s going to upset a lot of people isn’t it,’ Postecoglou said. ‘The debate’s now raging, the latest one is that neither of us will be able to get a trophy if we win, they’re just going to take a team photo because we’re not worthy.\n‘I mean, who cares if we’re struggling in the league? Why is that important? If it’s so easy to get to a final, then why doesn’t everyone who finishes in the top three do it? It’s a separate thing. It’s got nothing to do with league form.\n‘We understand our league form hasn’t been great. We understand the struggles we’ve had. A lot of them are because of the situation we’ve been in.\nMore Trending\n‘But how that diminishes the achievement of getting to a final. Like I said, this club and others have finished in first, second or third in the Premier League and haven’t made finals.’\nTottenham’s run through the knockout stages saw them get past AZ Alkmaar and Eintracht Frankfurt before beating Norwegian opposition in the semis. United meanwhile beat Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Bilbao.\n‘Why should that be diminished? I couldn’t care less who’s struggling and who’s not. I think both us and Manchester United have earned the right to be there,’ Postecoglou continued.\n‘I think we’ve probably beaten teams who will be in the Champions League next year, on our road to getting there. So looking forward to it, should be a great game.’\nMORE: Jamie Carragher predicts major Arsenal change if they sign £51 million transfer target\nMORE: Gary Neville names Inter Milan star who would be perfect for Manchester United\nMORE: Alexander Isak’s stance on Arsenal and Chelsea transfer revealed",
