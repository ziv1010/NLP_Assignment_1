  "body_text": "In a recent interview, Mo Salah opened up about his record-breaking campaign, advice that shaped his mindset, and what could be his final season at Anfield.\nMohamed Salah is currently enjoying one of his most dominant seasons with Liverpool, playing a pivotal role in their charge towards the Premier League title. With 30 goals and 21 assists across all competitions, the Egyptian has also helped propel Arne Slot’s side into the Champions League last 16.\nNow, in an exclusive interview with TNT Sports, the player sat down with former Real Madrid and Liverpool winger Steve McManaman and Salah has revealed the advice that took his game to another level.\nSalah credits former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger with instilling a vital mindset shift. “I think I got that advice from Arsène Wenger in the past,” Salah shared. “I asked him the same question actually because he had great players in his career. He told me: ‘The great player, it does not matter how he performs in the game. He always stays focused and waits for the moment. He’s always in the game.'”\nThe forward added, “I don’t want my emotions to go up and down. I just try to be stable and understand that not every game will be my best. But if I stay focused, I will have one chance.”\nWhile his record-breaking stats have put him among the frontrunners for the 2025 Ballon d’Or, Salah remains more focused on team success, “Let’s win the Premier League and the Champions League first, and we will see. The Ballon d’Or, everybody knows sometimes other factors come into play. My priority is winning trophies for the team.”\nBeyond being the league’s top scorer, he also spoke about helping his teammates, “I think this is my best season because I make the players around me better as well. Cody [Gakpo], Lucho [Luis Diaz], this has been their best season, and I feel I’ve played a part in that.”\nDespite his remarkable contributions, Salah’s future at Anfield remains uncertain. His contract expires in June 2025, and negotiations have yet to yield a new deal. With speculation mounting over a potential departure, the Egyptian dropped what could be perceived as a farewell to Liverpool fans.\n“I want fans to remember that I gave it all for them, for the city. I wasn’t lazy, I just enjoyed my football and gave everything. That’s what this city is about. They give you love, and you have a connection with them because you give everything in return.”\nPressed again on whether there was any progress in his contract talks, Salah simply responded: “In a very polite way… no.”\nAs Liverpool push for another league title and European glory, Salah remains focused on the present. Whether this is his final season at Anfield or not, he is determined to cement his legacy as one of the club’s all-time greats.",
