  "body_text": "Manchester United\nPremier League • England\nMan Utd make contact for completely unexpected signing from Premier League side, with deal easy due to one factor\nManchester United have registered their interest in a surprising late summer swoop for Wolves defender Nelson Semedo, according to a report explaining why the deal could quickly fall into place.\nSo far this summer, Man Utd have signed Mason Mount, Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund. However, with the end of the transfer window approaching, there are still some areas they want to address. But as long as Diogo Dalot and Aaron Wan-Bissaka stay, the right-back role wasn’t necessarily perceived to be one.\nYet according to Football Insider, Man Utd have made it known to Wolves that they are interested in adding Semedo to their squad. They have identified Dalot’s Portuguese compatriot as someone who could be more of a threat in the attacking phase on the right-hand side of their backline (which is an area of Wan-Bissaka’s game that has regularly come under scrutiny).\nAnd after registering their interest in Semedo – who was linked with the same move in January until Erik ten Hag showed some more faith to Wan-Bissaka – Man Utd have taken encouragement from the theory that Wolves might have to sell some more players for Financial Fair Play reasons.\nWolves have already cashed in on the likes of Ruben Neves, Nathan Collins, Conor Coady and Raul Jimenez this summer. The changes they have had to make to their squad prompted the departure of head coach Julen Lopetegui, who has been succeeded by Gary O’Neil.\nSemedo signed a contract extension until 2025 with Wolves back in May, but if Man Utd’s interest becomes a bid, it might be a quick sale for O’Neil’s side to make.\nREAD MORE: Man Utd closing in on £34m centre-back signing as Ten Hag summer spend nears whopping £200m\nWolves set to sacrifice another starter\nSo far this season, Semedo has started both matches for Wolves in the Premier League. He has been with the club since September 2020, when they took him from Barcelona.\nThe former Benfica star has since racked up more than 100 appearances for his current employers. However, he could now get the chance to step back up to Champions League level with Man Utd.\nWhether that means Dalot or Wan-Bissaka could leave Man Utd remains unclear. It was only back in May that the former signed a long-term contract at Old Trafford until 2028.\nWan-Bissaka, on the other hand, is into the final year of his contract with Man Utd, who nevertheless have the option to extend it into 2025 if they wish. Ten Hag has chosen the former Crystal Palace defender as a starter in both Premier League matches so far in 2023-24.\nMeanwhile, in addition to the Semedo saga, Wolves are also bracing themselves for interest from Manchester City for midfielder Matheus Nunes.",
