He has also been known to fill in as a makeshift midfielder.\nA near ever-present for Real Madrid Castilla this term, Valdepenas has played a total of 888 minutes for Alvaro Arbeloa’s side, who sit fourth in the Primera Federacion table.\nBut last weekend, Valdepenas made his first-team breakthrough for Los Blancos as Xabi Alonso rewarded the teenager’s excellent form with a place in his starting XI to take on Alaves in La Liga.\nAlthough his error led to Alaves’ equaliser in Madrid’s 2-1 victory, Valdepenas received glowing praise for his performance and he retained his place in Alonso’s squad to face Talavera in the Copa del Rey.\nHowever, while Valdepenas is highly thought of at Madrid, the club are growing anxious over interest from overseas, with Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen said to be ‘closely monitoring’ the Spain Under-19 international.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nSpanish newspaper AS claim Madrid’s hierarchy have responded by rewarding Valdepenas with a significant pay rise as ‘a recognition of his performance’ and ‘a way to secure his future’.\nThe new deal ‘reaffirms to Madrid’s commitment’ to Valdepenas and also includes an increased release clause – which now stands at over €50million (£44m).\nThe length of Valdepenas’ contract has not been extended at this stage given he was handed a renewal – that runs through to June 2029 – when he turned 18 last season.\nIt’s claimed an agreement was struck before Alonso named Valdepenas in his squads to face Manchester City and Alaves in the Champions League and La Liga respectively.\nThe report describes the development as ‘the icing on the cake’ of a ‘magical week’ for the former Rayo Vallecano and Leganes youth player.\nValde made his debut and I congratulate him for that,’ Madrid head coach Alonso said of the teen’s promising senior debut against Alaves.\n‘And I congratulate him not only for his debut, but also for the match he played.\nMore Trending\n‘He competed well and was very steady in his performance.’\nValdepanas, whose mother was pictured proudly watching on from the stands, thanked his team-mates for helping put him at ease in the match.\n‘My debut? I was nervous, I’m not going to lie,’ he said.\n‘But my team-mates reassured me on the pitch and I thank them for that.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: David Moyes hails Arsenal star as ‘best in the world’ after Everton defeat\nMORE: Jamie Redknapp blasts Arsenal star after Everton win: ‘Not good enough’\nMORE: Shaun Wright-Phillips fires warning to Arsenal after Man City win over West Ham",
