  "body_text": "This was not only the cliched game of two halves, but a game which has divided opinion. Was our slow and torpid start to the match at fault, conceding a goal only 113 seconds into the match? And does the blame of that start fall on the players or the manager? Or does the brunt of that defeat fall on the shoulders of Nicolas Jackson for his petulant foul leading to a red card? Certainly the straight red, accompanied by a three-match ban that will extend into next season, will have more enduring consequences, but does that outweigh the absolutely abysmal start and approach to this match? Time will tell for sure, but I think they are each somewhat equally culpable.\nNewcastle 2-0 Chelsea, Premier League: Tactical Analysis\n(Mag)pies in our faces\nThankfully, Nottingham Forest drew later in the afternoon on Sunday, otherwise our Champions League hopes might have been Magpie in the sky already. Jackson’s foolish decision to make no real attempt at the ball while endangering Sven Botman in the process essentially ruined any legitimate chance we had at a comeback, even despite our vastly improved collective performance in the second half. His rash and reckless decision-making led him to 10 yellow cards in 35 Premier League matches last season and now, in only 30 matches, he has gotten seven yellows and a straight red, and that’s not to mention the yellow he got in the UEFA Conference League qualifiers against Servette. Combine that with the hamstring injury he suffered this season in addition to the criticisms about both his ill-discipline and lack of end product, and the noise about needing a more consistent striker is becoming resoundingly louder. He will finish this season with only 10 league goals, 4 behind last year’s total.\nNewcastle’s setup and game plan should have come as no surprise, which is all the more damning in regards to our performance and perhaps even preparation, especially in the opening phases of the game. Eddie Howe always has them sit back in a 5 while out of possession and press tightly with his midfielders especially, hoping to nick the ball and hit on a quick counter with bombing wingbacks. They were tremendously effective at this in the first half, which is visible from the successful passes completed map below. Notice the concentration on both of the flanks and the forward progression from a majority of them. This map is from the first half alone, it does not include second half passes.\nAlthough Roméo Lavia has taken personal responsibility (apparently unlike Jackson) for losing the ball that led to their goal, the positioning of our entire defense was not ready for the turnover and the covering defense was horrible. From that turnover to the eventual goal, nobody particularly bathes themselves in respective glory, including Robert Sánchez, who may have gotten a bit unlucky with the bouncing shot but could have stayed on his feet a bit longer to potentially save it, and Moisés Caicedo, who should have done much better on his cover of Sandro Tonali at the back post. Whoever did not tell Roméo Lavia that he should not turn into pressure is as equal to blame as Lavia himself, despite his poor first touch.\nGiving away that early goal was not all that went wrong in the first half. Still isolating the first half alone, Newcastle had 57% possession, 1.48 xG, 12 shots (all of which were from inside our box) with 5 on target, and 214 passes with 85% accuracy (117 of which were in our half) - all stats which were much better than Chelsea’s. They had an imposing 26 touches in our box and were accurate on their crosses, connecting on 4 - and nearly scoring on a 5th by Dan Burn (right after Jackson’s sending off) that was rightly ruled for offside. They won 15 ground duels (58%) and 5 aerial duels (63%) to our 11 and 3 respectively. Winning those duels and second balls allowed them to maintain possession in our half of the pitch, and it showed by our 15 attempted clearances in the first half alone, many of which were won by them and allowed them to come right back in attack. To compound all those issues, Jackson was sent off in the 36th minute after we had already been dominated by them both offensively and defensively. Stats don’t always tell the whole story, but they do pretty accurately tell the story of this match, especially when we consider the vast difference between halves - a point I will elaborate on below.\nIn the second half we improved dramatically by adding Reece James for Noni Madueke and changing formation(s) to a very hybrid shape pending which team was in possession and getting Moisés Caicedo into his proper position permanently. In possession, it was something of a 3-5-2 with wingbacks joining the attack to keep the width and/or midfielders coming forward centrally, truly committing to an offensive objective. In fact, as in the image below, it appeared as though it was a 3-1-5 with Lavia as the single pivot and Neto and Cucurella forward on the flanks while Caicedo and Fernández stayed level with Palmer. The image also clearly demonstrates Newcastle’s 5-3-2.\nOff the ball it was largely a 4-4-1 with Cole Palmer isolated up top and minimal high pressing, very unlike our traditional man-marking scheme. It would eventually shift to a 3-3-3 after the 75th minute changes, bringing on Jadon Sancho for Trevoh Chalobah and Malo Gusto for Roméo Lavia in a go-for-broke attempt to get a point. Just comparing the same stats as above, in the second half we had 67% possession, 0.20 xG (which is actually down from the 0.49 of the first half), 4 shots (3 on target and 3 from inside their box compared to 6 shots 0 on target in the first half) and 277 of 311 passes completed for 89% accuracy, including 197 in their half. We were successful on 9 dribbles/take-ons, had 13 touches in their box, and forced them into 17 clearances. But perhaps more importantly, we finally were winning challenges, including 26 ground duels (68%) and 9 aerial duels (75%) to their 12 and 3 respectively.\nWhat all this proves is that we were capable of this effort the entire time and yet, for some reason, started the game incredibly poorly, even with such vital points on the line. This does help Nico Jackson’s case that his red card was not the most defining factor of the match, but his first half stats were as poor as everyone else’s - he did, however, win 2 of his 3 aerial duels. The problem was not with the 2 he won but the 1 he so poorly lost.\nIt is not at all surprising that we have again failed to win away from home. We have now played 18 home (11 wins, 5 draws, 2 losses for 38 points) and 18 away matches (7 wins, 4 draws, 7 losses for 25 points.) We have 34 goals for and 18 goals against at home (+16) but 28 for and 25 against (+3) away, having failed failed to score in 6 away matches but only 1 at Stamford Bridge. That poor away return has made us the only team within European qualifying spots (1st-7th) and indeed only 1 of 2 in the top 10 (the other being Bournemouth) to be underperforming on our xG. In fact, only Southampton, Bournemouth, Manchester United, and Crystal Palace are worse than us in that statistic.\nWe have seen how we struggled without Jackson leading our line when, even if he wasn’t scoring, his contributions helped the flow of our play and our results to boot. Someone is going to need to step up to fill that gap until summer, when we should certainly be looking to add a proven striker to our squad.\nKTBFFH.",
