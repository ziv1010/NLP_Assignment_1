It was confirmed on Sunday that the event will be streamed live on CAF's YouTube channel: CAF TV. In 2023, viewers also were able to watch the event live on CAF's official website CAFonline.com.\nLast year, over 20 broadcasters - continentally and internationally - showed the ceremony, and this year, SuperSport will be broadcasting on SuperSport Variety 4 in South Africa and SuperSport Africa 1 for the rest of the continent.\nCAF have also already announced that many of their broadcast partners, including beIN Sport, Canal+, SABC, Azam and several other platforms will be showing the event in Africa and beyond.\nCAF Awards: Which stars will be in attendance?\nAs well as many of the nominees, expect several legends of the African game to be present at Marrakesh on Monday.\nCAF have already confirmed that ex-Barcelona midfielder Seydou Keita, who finished second behind Yaya Toure in the AFOTY voting in 2011, will be present at the ceremony, where he'll be joined by the likes of Victor Wanyama (Kenya), Mohamed Zidan (Egypt), and Joseph-Antoine Bell (Cameroon).\nSouth Africa's Olympic sensation Caster Semenya will be present, providing some celebrity appeal from outside the footballing world, while Portia Modise, Genoveva Anonman and Alberta Sackey are among the former women players making the trip to Morocco.\nCAF revealed that Kate Scott of CBS Sport would be hosting the event, prompting a backlash on social media, with followers asking why the organisation hadn't opted for a female African presenter, or at least one with a connection to the continent's sport, to accompany fellow host Jalal Bouzrara.\nThose watching in the Palais des Congrès or along on the live stream will also be treated to performances by Moroccan musical artist Dystinct, as well as Tanzanian entertainer Diamond Platnumz.\nCAF Goal of the Year shortlist\nAbdul Aziz Issah (Dreams FC) - Dreams FC vs. APC Lobito (CAF Confederation Cup)\nAboubakary Koita (Mauritania) - Mauritania vs. Angola (Africa Cup of Nations)\nDenis Omedi (Kitara FC) - Kitara FC vs. KCCA FC (FUFA Super 8)\nIbrahim Adel (Egypt) - Mauritania vs. Egypt (AFCON Qualifier)\nKevin Pina (Cape Verde) - Cape Verde vs. Mozambique (Africa Cup of Nations)\nCristovao Mabululu (Angola) - Angola vs. Namibia (Africa Cup of Nations)\nNene Dorgeles (Mali) - Mali vs. Cote d'Ivoire (Africa Cup of Nations)\nSaïd Benrahma (Algeria) - Algeria vs. Togo (AFCON Qualifier)\nSébastien Haller (Côte d'Ivoire) - Nigeria vs Côte d'Ivoire (Africa Cup of Nations)\nWessam Abou Ali (Al Ahly) - Al Ahly vs. TP Mazembe (CAF Champions League)\nYassine Benzia (Algeria) - Algeria vs. South Africa (FIFA Series 2024 Algeria)\nAfrican Women's Footballer of the Year Nominees\nThe full list of CAF Awards nominees can be found on CAF's official site, with the five-player shortlist for the women's Footballer of the Year award reduced to a final three on Thursday.\nShe-polopolo and NWSL Champions Orlando Pride striker Barbra Banda is the favourite for the prestigious award, where she would become the first ever Zambian to win the woman's award.\nBanda, who was recently named BBC African Woman Footballer of the Year, scored 13 goals in the regular NWSL season as Pride won their first title last term, before being named among the Women's Ballon d'Or nominees. She also excelled at the Olympics in Paris, scoring four in three for the Copper Queens.\nHer closest challenge had appeared likely to come from Lyon's Tabitha Chawinga, who won the Coupe de France with Paris Saint-Germain before bagging goals aplenty with her new club, but the Malawian was unexpectedly cut from the final shortlist.\nCAF have not communicated the rationale behind their decision-making, with Chawinga's victory as the French top flight's player of the year for 23-24 appearing to have put her in a strong position.\nMorocco's Sanaa Mssoudy and Nigeria's Chiamaka Nnadozie are the other finalists to rival Banda.\nPlayer of the Year (Women):\nSanaâ Mssoudy (Morocco / AS FAR)\nChiamaka Nnadozie (Nigeria / Paris FC)\nBarbra Banda (Zambia / Orlando Pride)\nAfrican Men's Footballer of the Year Nominees\nCAF's full listing for the contenders for each of the men's award prizes can be found on their official website, with categories such as Coach of the Year, Interclub Player of the Year, and Goalkeeper of the Year set to be decided on Monday.\nThe most hotly anticipated award is likely to be the African Men's Footballer of the Year prize, where, with none of Victor Osimhen, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané or Riyad Mahrez shortlisted, we're guaranteed a first-time winner.\nCAF had originally vowed to reduce the five-man shortlist to a final three - as they had done with the women - on Thursday, as had been the case in previous years. However, they reneged on that decision on the day, citing the closeness of the voting as the reason why all were retained.\nIt's not clear how they will conduct a final round of voting, or indeed if one will take place, with the shortlist not being whittled down to a final three!\nPlayer of the Year (Men):\nAchraf Hakimi (Morocco / Paris Saint-Germain)\nAdemola Lookman (Nigeria / Atalanta)\nSimon Adingra (Côte d'Ivoire / Brighton)\nRonwen Williams (South Africa / Mamelodi Sundowns)\nSerhou Guirassy (Guinea / Borussia Dortmund)\nAmong the current nominees for African Footballer of the Year, Ademola Lookman is the outstanding favourite, having excelled during the period in question both for club and country.",
