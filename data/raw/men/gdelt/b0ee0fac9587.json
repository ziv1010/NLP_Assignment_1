'I covered every one of those games and I still don't know how they won it. They were out.”\nMadrid secured come-from-behind wins against Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City in each of the knockout rounds before beating Liverpool 1-0 in the final.\n“They were like a boxer, they were up against the ropes and they were halfway down the ropes and you're thinking the ref's going to step in and stop the bout,' Hoddle said.“I don't know what happened, they just kept going. And they had that quality.”\nWhere the Champions League is concerned anything seems possible for Madrid, which won the trophy three years in a row from 2016-18 at a time when Barcelona was dominating the Spanish title.\nBut if any team can rival Madrid's ability to produce the unexpected in European club soccer's most prized competition, it is Liverpool.\nThere was the famous comeback from 3-0 down against AC Milan in the 2005 final before going on to win on penalties. And more recently the 4-3 aggregate win against Barcelona in the semifinals in 2019 after losing 3-0 in the first leg at the Nou Camp.\nMadrid, however, has felt like a step too far ever since the draw was made last November.\nAfter all, this is a Liverpool team that faces a fight just to qualify for next season's competition, let alone win it this year.\nJurgen Klopp has struggled to get his team firing after the departure of key forward Sadio Mane to Bayern Munich last summer and a host of injuries.\nAhead of the first-leg match at Anfield, Klopp can at least be encouraged by a recent upturn in form after back-to-back wins against Everton and Newcastle in the Premier League and goals from misfiring forwards Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nunez.\nSuddenly Liverpool looks in contention again for a Champions League-qualifying spot, sitting seven points off fourth place Tottenham with two games in hand.\nThen there is the Anfield factor, with an atmosphere that saw Barcelona wilt in that semifinals comeback and Manchester City repeatedly fall despite dominating English soccer in recent years.\nLike Madrid's fans, the Liverpool crowd believes nothing is beyond their team when it comes to Europe after winning the trophy six times.\nJoe Cole played for and against Liverpool and was part of a Chelsea team that lost in the semifinals at Anfield in 2005 and 2007.\n“It's a huge club. It's as big a club in world football as any and it's got an expectancy and the fans drive it,” said the BT Sport analyst.“In the ground they turn up for their team. It's a sight to behold to play for or against them.”\nBut Cole questions whether Liverpool can overcome this Madrid team, which recently won the Club World Cup.\n“They've got a job on their hands,” Cole said.“This Real Madrid team is actually better than the team that won it last year, I believe. They've improved. The young players coming through are going to be better and the older players are still doing it.”\nMadrid also beat Liverpool in the final of 2018 and won when the sides met in the quarterfinals two years ago.\nTUESDAY'S MATCHES (UAE Time)\n> Liverpool vs Real Madrid, 11.55 pm\n> Eintracht Frankfurt vs Napoli, 11.55 pm\nALSO READ:\nqatar sheikh makes man united bid as billionaire ratcliffe confirms offer\nliverpool boss klopp baffled by chelsea spending spree in january",
