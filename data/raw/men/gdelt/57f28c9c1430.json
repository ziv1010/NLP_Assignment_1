  "body_text": "Is the answer to Arsenal’s ‘left eight’ conundrum right under Mikel Arteta’s nose?\nOleksandr Zinchenko is a left-sided central midfield player for his country, Ukraine. At the start of last season, Arteta even described him as “a midfield player playing as a full-back”.\nAnd yet, 16 months into his Arsenal career, Zinchenko is still waiting for a first start in midfield. With nobody having nailed down the position vacated by Granit Xhaka — and Arteta seemingly having growing concerns over Zinchenko’s defensive capabilities — it must be worth a go.\nAdvertisement\nIn the recent 3-1 win over Burnley, the reshuffle prompted by Fabio Vieira’s red card saw Zinchenko briefly shifted into a more advanced role. It was eye-catching only in that, until now, Arteta has been so reluctant to deploy Zinchenko upfield.\nThe Arsenal manager presumably has his reasons. Towards the end of Zinchenko’s time with Manchester City, Pep Guardiola showed a similar reticence, although that can be explained by the wealth of options at his disposal – the likes of Bernardo Silva, Ilkay Gundogan and Rodri. Arsenal, despite a strong start to the campaign, are still trying to strike the right balance in the middle of the park.\nReplacing Xhaka was always going to be difficult, even if the summer felt like an opportune moment for a parting of ways. He had been a constant in Arteta’s side and shone in the more attack-minded role he occupied last season.\nArsenal signed Kai Havertz at great expense in the hope he could step into that midfield role. A more natural attacker, the expectation was that Havertz would bring improved end product and quality in the final third.\nThus far, that has not transpired. By this stage last season, Xhaka had four goals and three assists. Havertz is yet to score from open play and has just one assist.\nVieira was earmarked as someone to compete with Havertz. After a year spent acclimatising to English football, it was hoped the Portuguese would kick on in 2023-24, but he has largely underwhelmed and the three-match ban picked up against Burnley will not help his cause.\nFor much of the season, the left eight slot has been filled by Declan Rice. While Rice has performed admirably, it’s not where he feels most comfortable. “My best position is probably as a No 6,” Rice told TNT Sports after the 2-0 home win over Sevilla. “Breaking up the play and taking the ball from deep.”\nGO DEEPER\nTrossard and Zinchenko: Keeping Arsenal 'connected'\nPlaying Rice as a No 8 also spreads Arsenal’s contingent of potential holding midfielders relatively thin. Starting with Rice and Jorginho means leaving only Mohamed Elneny in reserve. With Thomas Partey now expected to be sidelined until 2024 and a frenetic period of fixtures looming, it would be helpful for Rice and Jorginho to share games.\nWatch Zinchenko for Ukraine and his aptitude for a midfield role is obvious.\nAdvertisement\nOne of his defensive traits is that, as he’s often up against an opponent who is stronger or faster than him, he tends to be aggressive and gambles on winning the ball early. When this is unsuccessful, it can leave the team exposed.\nIn midfield, that would be less damaging and potentially more productive. Take this example from Ukraine’s match against Wales in June 2022.\nZinchenko pushes high and nicks the ball off Joe Allen 30 yards from goal.\nHe’s then able to advance before firing off a shot from the edge of the box. It is textbook midfield play.\nIf Xhaka had a flaw, it was that he lacked nimble footwork in congested areas of the pitch. That, however, is where Zinchenko is often at his best.\nIn this example against Scotland, he is confronted by eight Scotland players defending narrowly.\nHe slaloms between two, exploiting his close control and body swerves, before looking to drive between a further two defenders.\nAt the last possible moment, just as it looks as if he is about to be dispossessed, he finds a delicate through-ball to the striker for a shot at goal.\nZinchenko’s penetrative passing is what makes him such a valuable player. In the opposition half, that can be particularly effective. In this example against Armenia, Zinchenko has time and space in that left eight zone.\nMykhailo Mudryk makes a run outside him. Zinchenko carries the ball forward before releasing a perfectly timed pass, bisecting two Armenia defenders and putting Mudryk through on goal.\nAlthough Mudryk and Zinchenko will not line up together at the Emirates Stadium as once planned, it’s easy enough to envisage Zinchenko playing this pass into Gabriel Martinelli.\nZinchenko’s ball-carrying and passing also make him an effective player in transition. With Scotland chasing the game in stoppage time, Zinchenko wins a duel on the edge of the box.\nHe then carries the ball 30 yards before playing a through ball to Girona forward Artem Dovbyk.\nAll these attributes seem to be what Arsenal are lacking in midfield and a trio of Rice, Zinchenko and Martin Odegaard would have a balance of complementary skills.\nAdvertisement\nThere is a counterpoint to this argument. The beauty of Zinchenko is arguably that, granted freedom to roam, he can do all of these things — ostensibly from left-back. He might be a left-back on the team sheet, but when Arsenal are in possession, he is already an auxiliary midfielder.\nThat’s true — but there are two phases of the game to consider. Zinchenko might be a midfielder when Arsenal have the ball, but without it, he is required to defend.\nWhile his shortcomings as a defender are sometimes overstated, Arteta does have some concerns. He replaced Zinchenko with Takehiro Tomiyasu at half-time in the 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge and the Japanese international subsequently started both Champions League ties against Sevilla and the Premier League match at Newcastle.\nWhether due to concerns over his defensive fallibility or physical frailty, Zinchenko has completed a full 90 minutes in just two of his 16 appearances this season.\nSummer signing Jurrien Timber began the season at left-back, ostensibly deputising for Zinchenko, before a cruciate ligament injury put him out of contention. Had Timber stayed fit, perhaps Zinchenko would have faced even greater competition for his full-back spot.\nSome games suit Zinchenko playing full-back, such as the recent win over Burnley, in which Arsenal were always likely to dominate possession, but if Arteta is considering giving more games to Tomiyasu and eventually Timber, that frees the Ukrainian to start in midfield.\nArsenal have spent the first few months of the season trying to find an upgrade on Xhaka and Zinchenko surely has to be worth a try.\nIf not now, when?\n(Top photo: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)",
