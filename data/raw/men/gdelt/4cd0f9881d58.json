But during their second clash in less than two weeks Nashville, led by English manager Gary Smith, embraced its defensive mindset and stifled Miami using a deep low block to clog the goal area.\nFor the league’s worst team prior to his arrival (alongside former Barcelona teammates Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba), it marked the first match when Miami did not score a goal with Messi on the field.\nSunday night at BMO Stadium, the defending MLS Cup champion Los Angeles Football Club gets the next crack at becoming the first CONCACAF region club to beat the world’s best player since he arrived playing his joyful, mesmerizing best.\nDespite Wednesday’s result, LAFC is unlikely to mimic Nashville’s tactics.\n“We are not a team that could defend in the box for 90 minutes,” said LAFC defender Giorgio Chiellini, who anchored back lines with Juventus and the Italian national team that both shut out and were exposed by Messi. “It’s a different philosophy. It’s a different quality of player.”\nInstead, LAFC remains committed to its “rock and roll” vertical, high-pressing, turnover-inducing style.\n“We can have some adjustments,” Chiellini said, “but not completely change our philosophy because this won’t work 100%.\n“We will need an effort from all the team and it’s the only way that could work. Be respectful but not scared.”\nWith more than a week to prepare, LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo, his staff, the club’s data analysts and, of course, the players took five days to work out how they want to play 11-on-11 while coping with Messi.\n“Because of obviously his ability and the way he plays it’s an illusion to try and think you can stop him for 90 minutes,” Cherundolo said Friday.\n“If you try and focus on that you’re going to lose out on opportunities to actually beat Miami,” LAFC’s head coach said. “And that’s where our focus is in making sure as a collective they have to defend, as a collective they have to work hard and put a very intense and top shift to beat us. That’s where our focus is, not just one situation.”\nPreparation began in earnest on Monday with assistant coach Marc Dos Santos taking the lead on video scouting.\nDepending on the number of games LAFC has in any given month, those duties get staggered among the staff, including Cherundolo and assistant coach Ante Razov.\nThis wasn’t the first time Dos Santos scouted Messi. A few weeks after winning the MLS Cup, as the Canadian coach completed his UEFA pro license last November, he was tasked with breaking down a Champions League match and did so when Manchester City hosted Paris Saint-Germain.\n“Never last year did I think one day I’d be doing a report where I actually have to talk about Messi, but against us,” he said. “I told Ante now it’s real.”\nAs Dos Santos zeroed in on Miami, dissecting film into digestible segments to be shared with players during the three days leading up to the match, “the choice of clips has to be very coherent,” he said. “If you show a little bit of everything they don’t get one clear message.”\nLAFC generally sorts through film over an opponent’s previous five games, using numbers from the analysis team to lend context to what their eyes identify as patterns of play worth highlighting.\nFacing any opponent, LAFC scouts for five key moments.\nThe run-of-play – defensive organization, that is to say, what happens when they lose the ball, and offensive organization, what happens when they win the ball – comprises four of these instances and is coached on separate days.\nThe fifth component is set pieces. The best defense against Messi in that department has long been not conceding them in the first place, which like everything else his opponents contend with is easier said than done.\nThere’s understanding the uniqueness of his movement, for instance.\n“He doesn’t walk,” Dos Santos said. “I would call it roam. Hang out. Sniffing where the ball is going to go. And then he scans. It’s going to happen. It’s crazy. Suddenly he has this burst. He sees something. This is how it’s going to develop. It’s like he sees the future. When he’s walking or roaming he’s looking at the future. ‘Oh, I saw that. This is where the ball is going to go.’ And he ends up going there.”\nMessi-led teams are transition offense nightmares. His ability to run directly at defenders or find teammates in space, especially when no one else would think to try, offers coaches such as Inter Miami’s Tata Martino chances to build squads around the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner’s preternatural soccer IQ.\nFinding the right spots in the right moments while appearing to take a leisurely stroll as everyone else huffs and puffs around the field is a hallmark of his greatness.\n“He could seem sleepy for 85 of 90 minutes but in that five minutes that is split in 10 actions of 30 seconds, he could be devastating,” Chiellini said. “That’s the problem. That’s a big problem. In 10 seconds he could change the game. That’s a top player.”\nThat’s Messi. And that’s the solution LAFC will try to find on Sunday.",
