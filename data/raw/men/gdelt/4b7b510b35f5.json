Many times, speaking with my family, we say sometimes the house we have here, it feels more like home than the one we have in Portugal.\n‘Everyone knows my aim is to win the Premier League and the Champions League [with United]. If I’m going to do it or not, I’m not going to be able to tell you.\n‘The first question when I spoke to my wife [in the summer] and I said, “look, we have this offer from Saudi,” the first thing she said was, “have you achieved everything you wanted to achieve at the club?” Because she knows that I haven’t.\n‘And when I talk about I haven’t fulfilled my dreams at the club, it comes a lot from what she said to me. And obviously, I’m not sure, she’s not sure I’m going to make it. But if I don’t try it, that’s for sure I won’t make it.’\nFernandes left Sporting Lisbon in January 2020 to join United for £47m – unquestionably, the best signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.\nThe skipper added that he is unaware of any renewed transfer interest from Saudi, saying Al Hilal were not impressed that he turned them down.\nBruno Fernandes Man Utd stats\nAppearances: 299\nGoals: 100\nAssists: 87\nTrophies: FA Cup (2024), League Cup (2023)\n‘At the moment, no one spoke with me about anything. If someone told me, “in the summer, look, we’ll come again.” No one told that to me.\nMore Trending\n‘I don’t think they were very happy for me to reject the offer. I accept that because the offer was very good in terms of salary. Everything was massive for me. It was a huge difference.\n‘Obviously I can’t talk for the club. I’ve seen a lot of news. I’ve seen a lot of people talking that I had an agreement to go already next season. If the club has done that agreement, it wasn’t made with me.\n‘I haven’t spoken with anyone. My agent also knows how I work, so if he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup. Because until then, I won’t speak to anyone.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Pep Guardiola makes Liverpool and Arsenal title prediction\nMORE: Paul Merson claims key Chelsea star ‘can’t do what Declan Rice does’\nMORE: ‘Incredible’ – Pep Guardiola says £53m Man City can become ‘one of the best’",
