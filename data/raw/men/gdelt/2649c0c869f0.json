Let’s hope Zubimendi is one step ahead of Bruno G, Tonali and Joelinton + he keeps his cool.\nSome rough challenges pending.’\n‘Pretty pointless just spamming balls into the box when they’ve got Dan Burn, Botman, Thiaw and Pope who are all 6ft 4+. Hopefully Arteta switches things up and doesn’t rely on just pumping balls into the box, corners and long throws as this really doesn’t seem like the game we’ll be getting much change out of it. Gyokeres will feast if he’s given room to run in behind Dan Burn and co.’\n‘We simply have to win at St James today. I know a draw is always a good result here but champions find a way to win here and cut the gap.\nOur time is now.’\n‘0-0 or 1-0 Newcastle. Cue the anger on here after the final whistle.’\n‘Martinelli against their vicious giants? Nah.’\n‘Win this and we’re right in the hunt. Newcastle are definitely neutered with isak gone.\nNewcastle have one of the finest low block defences and they’re good on th counter. We need to play quick and vertically/forward as quickly as possible and exploit the spaces.’\n‘This will put Arteta under the lights like never before. It’s time to beat the coward allegations and be a man. If I see Merino in the starting lineup, then I’m afraid that he has learned nothing. This is not about fighting fire with fire. We can never physically outmatch Newcastle at their home stadium, but we have better footballers than them. Keep the ball on the ground and move it quickly. One touch football to lull them out of shape when they inevitably lose patience and try to kick us. The worst thing you can do at a hostile ground is play to the stadium’s desires. Keep them quiet by playing you’re own game.’\n‘I hate this fixture so much and was predicting a loss or draw, but I’ve just seen that Newcastle’s form is HORRENDOUS. Just 2 wins in the last 16 games in all comps.’\n‘That doesn’t matter, they treat us going up there as a cup final.’\n‘Newcastle are a physical side but we haven’t been intimidated by strong arm tactics for many seasons now. The old cliche of “Arsenal don’t like it up em” is well and truly a thing of the past now.’\n‘We need to make it work with an in-form Martinelli and Eze on the pitch. Newcastle have comfortably had our number recently at St James.\nWe need to show them an Arsenal that they cannot prepare for. I once again am very hopeful that we do not see the same midfield 3 which has not been working.\nPlay our most talented players, and we will even see Gyökeres be impactful.’\n‘Sorry to kill the hopes but we are dropping points for sure. It’s typical when most of rivals drop points then we play too safe.’\n‘Yep, when was the last time we capitalised?\nAnd it’s compounded by the fact we’re playing these utter thugs.’\n‘No doubt the ref will allow them to kick us all match and make a couple extremely dodgy decisions on top of that.\nHard to see us getting more than a draw here.’\n‘Liverpool dropped points and we all know what that means. Arteta will s… the bed.\nBut in all honesty, if he chooses Zubi, Rice, Merino midfield, Josh should sack him immidiately.\nIf that is our midfiled however, this will be a goalless draw.’\n‘Unfortunately, that midfield away at Newcastle actually makes the most sense…which means we’ll definitely see it.\nI’d rather he was brave and tried Eze at the 10 with two of those three behind, but it won’t happen.’\n‘Surely people aren’t going to watch 90 minutes of ‘Gyokeres’ when the Ryder Cup and NFL are on?’\n‘Who tf watches golf and yankball?’\n‘Far far better sports than Footy.\nI didn’t think the day would come but they’re miles better. Football has been trash last 5/6 years.’\n‘You aren’t winning the league, if you can’t deliver, in moments like this, it’s that simple.\nWe never cut the gap, to 3 points, last week, so we have to get the 3 points, this week.’\n‘People will be more confident if Arteta was a bold manager, assertive and prepare his team to attack when they smell blood but sadly we all know that’s never going to happen.’\n‘Arsenal fans just want to be upset.’\n‘I’ve noticed it, Arsenal fans just want to be angry at something.’\n‘I see dropped points here today unfortunately, weve seen plenty of Arteta not to know whats coming. It will be workman like MF and style of play. We shouldnt rile the crowd by going toe to toe physically, intead i want to see our creative technical players kill the mood and keep the ball, because a transitional game favours them.\nHowe is banking on Mikel copying the liverpool template, teta needs to throw a curveball and START Eze, as crazy as that sounds (eze should be a default starter). Throw the likes of Martinelli against tired legs and if we are ahead or they are pushing to equalize to win, we can pick them off the counter.\nBut i dont see that happening so itll be a narrow loss or a draw.’\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
