Maybe we are going to lose again in the Premier League against Brighton and against Tottenham and against Liverpool,\" Guardiola told reporters referring to their next three Premier League games.\n\"We are just two points behind Liverpool who are a top-class team ... We've started well in the Champions League but I know people expect us to win 38 league games and win the treble every season as these are our standards.\n\"The reason it is difficult is because we have had a lot of absentees which can happen in some seasons.\nALSO READ: Man City move top as early Haaland strike secures win over Southampton\n\"Sometimes, to win the treble, everything has to be on the same page with injuries, but this is not possible this time ... The teams are very strong and everything is more difficult and we have to accept that. That is the challenge.\"\nCity will be without Ballon d'Or winner Rodrigo and Oscar Bobb for most of the campaign, while John Stones, Jack Grealish and Ruben Dias remain sidelined and did not travel to Portugal.\nManuel Akanji, Nathan Ake and Kyle Walker still have problems despite being in the squad, Guardiola said, and Kevin De Bruyne and Savinho are improving while Erling Haaland is fit.\nCity, third in the Champions League standings after two wins and a draw, are looking for a third consecutive European win at Portuguese champions Sporting, who are eight but also have seven points and are unbeaten across all competitions this season.\nGuardiola's City side claimed a resounding 5-0 win at Sporting in the 2022 Champions League last 16.\n\"They play quite similar like we faced two seasons ago, the pattern is so clear,\" Guardiola added.\nREAD MORE: Spurs sink Man City, Man United thump Leicester to make League Cup quarters\n\"They have changed players but have the same manager and same mentality,\" he said referring to Sporting boss Ruben Amorim, who will take over at Manchester United next week.\nALSO READ\nMore\nMilan-Cortina day 6: Sun earns China's first medal of short track speed skating\nArsenal miss chance to go six points clear with draw at Brentford\nAtletico hit Barcelona for four to take giant step toward Copa del Rey final\nItaly's Olympic venue a pacesetter for Chinese resorts\nEarning her wings\nMilan-Cortina day 5: Ning earns China's first skating medal\nReal Madrid reaches agreement with UEFA to officially end Super League project\nWasserman to remain LA28 chairman after Epstein review\nFOCUS\nColumnists\nCOMPANY\nDownload Our App\nCopyright 1995 - 2026.
