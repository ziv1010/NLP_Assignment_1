The league said after the match he also \"entered the referees' dressing room without permission and made seriously offensive statements\".\n\"For the first time in my career a referee has spoken to me in an unjustifiable way,\" added Mourinho.\n\"To react like that, something must have happened. We need to see if we can do anything from a disciplinary perspective.\"\nAC Milan have recovered from a dreadful start to 2023 by winning their past four games in all competitions without conceding.\nStefano Pioli's side face Fiorentina on Saturday ahead of next week's second leg against Tottenham in the last 16 of the Champions League, while Inter Milan host Lecce on Sunday.\nOne to watch: Paul Pogba\nThe France midfielder made his first competitive appearance since April as Juventus defeated Torino 4-2 in the Turin derby on Tuesday.\nPogba injured his right knee injury during pre-season in July shortly after his return to Juve following six years at Manchester United.\nThe 29-year-old won four Serie A titles in as many seasons during his first spell in Italy, and Juve hope his recovery can help the club make an improbable push for a top-four place following a 15-point deduction for illicit transfer activity.\nKey stats\n8 - successive league games in which Victor Osimhen has scored for Napoli. The Nigerian is Serie A's top scorer this season with 19 goals -- six more than nearest rival Lautaro Martinez.\n30 - Cremonese's 2-1 victory over Roma snapped the joint-longest run without a win for a club in Italian top-flight history. Ancona also went 30 Serie A games without winning between 1993 and 2004.\nFixtures (all times GMT)\nFriday\nNapoli v Lazio (1945)\nSaturday\nMonza v Empoli (1400), Atalanta v Udinese (1700), Fiorentina v AC Milan (1945)\nSunday\nSpezia v Hellas Verona (1130), Sampdoria v Salernitana (1400), Inter Milan v Lecce (1700), Roma v Juventus (1945)\nMonday\nSassuolo v Cremonese (1730), Torino v Bologna (1945)\n© 2023 AFP",
