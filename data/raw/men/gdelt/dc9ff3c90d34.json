For example, if you aren't sleeping, if you aren't eating, if you're irritable, if you're not doing all the things that you love, if you're obsessing over something.'\nPhysically, the most common signs of chronic stress are chest pains, headaches and muscle aches.\nThis is because stress causes the body to release too much of the hormone cortisol, which is produced by the adrenal glands that sit on the top of the kidneys.\nIt regulates a wide range of bodily processes including blood pressure, metabolism, fertility and sleep-wake cycles.\nAs well as cortisol, the body releases a surge of adrenaline — an increase in both hormones is a result of the 'fight or flight' reaction that's triggered when we're under threat.\nTogether, these hormones cause the blood vessels to constrict, which makes our heart have to work harder to pump blood around the body.\nThis can lead to heart palpitations and chest pains, as well as high blood pressure and pains in the muscles and head.\nStress causes the body to release the hormone cortisol, which is produced by the adrenal glands. It regulates a wide range of processes throughout the body such as, blood pressure, metabolism and sleep-wake cycles\n'If the stress doesn't go away, that's when things like high blood pressure, heart attacks, all of those physical things are more likely to happen,' Dr Tang warned.\nThe NHS agrees that long periods of stress can our raise blood pressure, as well as causing headaches, blurred vison and chest pain.\nAnother sign that cortisol is at worryingly high is struggling to get to sleep, or waking up frequently during the night.\nDr Tang explained that a lack of sleep can cause problems day to day and trigger behavioural problems like general irritability and carelessness.\nHowever, sleep deprivation doesn't just put us in a bad mood, in the long-term it can also impair metabolism and further increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases, according to experts.\nDr Tang describes stress as a 'vicious cycle' as a lack of sleep also makes it harder for the body to regulate cortisol levels, worsening the problem.\nAnother sign to watch out for is a dramatic change in appetite.\n'Sometimes stress makes us not eat at all, but for others, it makes us eat lots, and that's the effect of the cortisol affecting our normal processing,' she said.\nIn addition, stress can make the body physically tense up as a way of guarding the body against injury and pain, according to the American Psychological Association.\nThis adds to muscle pain because the tissues are constantly taut.\nAnother sign your stress is at alarming levels is a significant loss of libido.\nAccording to the mental health charity Mind you may lose interest in sex or be unable to enjoy it.\nThat's because chronic stress can affect testosterone production resulting in a decile in sex drive.\nAlthough there are no specific treatments for stress, you should speak to your GP if stress is affecting your physical health.\nStudies show that stress should not be taken lightly.\nOne 2021 paper showed the mental health problem can cause sudden cardiac death, while a 2015 study showed a 50 per cent increased risk of early death due to chronic stress and depression.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured",
