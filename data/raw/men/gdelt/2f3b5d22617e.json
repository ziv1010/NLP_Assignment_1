  "body_text": "Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins would truly be an ideal signing for Chelsea. The England hero is exactly what is required at Stamford Bridge - and we all know it. Nevertheless, here are some reasons why the Villan could be a perfect Blues addition.\nAnd it looks like the suitable acquisition is not just a pipe dream because the west London outfit are supposedly 'preparing' a tempting offer to their Premier League rivals. This prospective deal is arguably even better than hypothetical moves for Napoli attacker Victor Osimhen or Newcastle United hitman Alexander Isak.\nIn addition to talk of a possible world-class centre forward coming to Fulham Road, there is also resumed speculation concerning midfield warrior Conor Gallagher. Will CFC allow their Three Lions squad member to depart?\nConor Gallagher bids incoming - claim\nChelsea won't be stopping at six signings this summer, if a report is to be taken on face value. Of course, some of the additions have been prospects for the future. But marquee acquisitions remain anticipated at the Bridge.\nThere will also be simultaneous sales along with supposed fresh faces arriving at CFC. For example, apparently unwanted Blues goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga is said to be in talks with Al Ittihad from Saudi Arabia.\nThen there is Conor Gallagher; it is suggested that the club is awaiting bids. There are those in the fan base who would prefer him to stay at Chels', naturally. However, the pure profit obtainable from relinquishing academy products seems to be the telling factor in this saga.\nWith Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia and now Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, the midfield is stacked with No.6s and No.8s. Therefore losing one of a talented bunch is almost inevitable due to squad saturation. Not to mention a want for maximum playing time amongst top professionals, irrespective of age.\nWhy Ollie Watkins is a great match for Chelsea - opinion\nCFC recruitment chiefs have reportedly been instructed to offer Aston Villa some players plus cash for Watkins. This rumour should be music to Blues supporters' ears. That is because, aside from a world-class 'keeper, the only element missing at the Bridge is a natural goalscorer of the utmost standard. The Three Lions striker has clearly proven that he's of the highest calibre.\nThe only problems are the ridiculous fee that Villa will definitely demand. Oh, and they have Champions League football while the Blues merely secured entry to the Europa Conference League. But can you imagine Watkins' possible link-up with Cole Palmer, and the impact of having a true No.9 on this team.",
