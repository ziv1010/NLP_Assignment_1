Even as a player I never experienced emotions like it,\" said Roy, a former Marseille and Sunderland midfielder.\n\"It is why we love football. I had already congratulated the lads for being guaranteed a top-four place but there was one more stage to conquer.\n\"We thoroughly deserve it after the season we have had.\"\nFrance captain Mbappe was left out of PSG's squad as the champions won away at struggling Metz.\nMbappe, who will leave PSG at the end of the campaign after seven years, had already missed his team's 2-1 victory at Nice in midweek due to a hamstring niggle.\nHe did not travel with the team to Metz and was one of several first-team regulars who were rested by coach Luis Enrique, whose side had already wrapped up the title.\nOusmane Dembele, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Marquinhos and Vitinha also played no part but PSG still claimed the victory thanks to early goals by Carlos Soler and Lee Kang-in.\nMbappe is still expected to play his last game for PSG in next week's French Cup final against Lyon, before a likely move to Real Madrid for next season.\nLyon qualify for Europe\nDespite their defeat, Metz could still stay up. They end the season in the relegation play-off place, finishing above Lorient because they scored more away goals in meetings between the two clubs.\nLorient's 5-0 win over Clermont meant they ended level with Metz on points and goal difference, but the Brittany club go straight down to Ligue 2 with Clermont, while Metz will get a second chance to survive in a play-off against a side from the second tier.\nElsewhere, Lyon completed an astonishing turnaround in their fortunes as Alexandre Lacazette's stoppage-time penalty secured a 2-1 win over Strasbourg that saw them snatch European qualification.\nLyon had been rock bottom in early December and looked favourites for relegation, but their revival under new coach Pierre Sage has been stunning.\nThey made it 15 wins in their last 20 league games with Lacazette getting the decisive goal after his opener had been cancelled out by Habib Diarra.\nLyon finish sixth, pipping Lens after they squandered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Montpellier.\nSage's team are therefore certain to play in the Europa League next season, before going into the French Cup final against PSG next weekend, while Lens finish seventh and will be in the Conference League.\nIn other games, runners-up Monaco crushed Nantes 4-0, while Marseille missed out on a European place despite a 2-1 win at Le Havre, and Reims defeated Rennes 2-1.\n© 2024 AFP",
