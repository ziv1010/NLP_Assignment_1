That is what we are working very hard on.”\nManchester United boss Michael Carrick hailed super-sub Benjamin Sesko’s “unbelievable finish” after the striker’s stunning late volley snatched a draw at West Ham.\nSesko got his toe to Bryan Mbeumo’s cross six minutes into stoppage time and rifled it into the top corner to deny Carrick’s old club a vital victory in the relegation battle.\nIt was second time the £66.3million Slovenian, yet to start a match under Carrick, has climbed off the bench to score at the death after his 94th-minute winner against Fulham.\nCarrick said: “It’s an unbelievable finish from the angle to generate that, to get it on target, to finish it – it’s some goal.”\nArne Slot admits he is enduring by far the most challenging season of his managerial career as he attempts to secure Champions League football with Liverpool.\nSunday’s eventful 2-1 home defeat by Manchester City left the reigning Premier League champions in sixth place and prompted mounting speculation over Slot’s position less than two years after he moved from Feyenoord to succeed Jurgen Klopp.\n“By a mile,” said the Dutchman when asked if it was his most difficult campaign. “Because all the other seasons I’ve managed there was only positives, I don’t think I’ve ever lost two games in a row (before).\n“It is different with the season we’re having now than all the other seasons I’ve managed where we always did something special – and there’s still the possibility that we can do something special this season as well.”\nBayern Munich are in “intensive talks” with England captain Harry Kane over his future amid speculation that he could make a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia.\nThe 32-year-old, who has scored 123 goals in 129 appearances for the Bundesliga champions since his £100million switch from Tottenham during the summer of 2023, is under contract until 2027 but has been linked with a move to the Middle East should he not extend his stay at the Allianz Arena.\nHowever, Bayern’s sporting director Max Eberl told a press conference: “We are talking. That doesn’t mean negotiations have started. We are in intensive talks with Harry, then the next steps will follow.\n“I can’t comment on the rumours circulating that someone is preparing anything (on a transfer bid for Kane). All I can say is that we are in close contact with Harry regarding him and our success.”\nManchester City have the chance to close the gap on Premier League leaders Arsenal to just three points when they welcome Fulham to the Etihad Stadium.\nLiverpool will attempt to bounce back from their home defeat by City at Sunderland, who remain unbeaten in the league at the Stadium of Light this season, while third-placed Aston Villa entertain Brighton.\nElsewhere, struggling Burnley travel to Crystal Palace and bottom-of-the-table Wolves head for Nottingham Forest.",
