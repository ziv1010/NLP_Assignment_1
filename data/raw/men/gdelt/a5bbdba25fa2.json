  "body_text": "Unai Emery looks to revive Aston Villa’s stuttering season with a Europa League return, while Ange Postecoglou guides Nottingham Forest into Europe for the first time in 30 years\nBirmingham\nAston Villa hope a change of competition will bring fresh energy as they prepare to begin their first Europa League main-draw campaign since 2008–09. Manager Unai Emery, who has lifted the trophy four times and reached another final, will lead his struggling side against Bologna on Thursday at Villa Park. Villa are yet to win in the Premier League this season, with their only goal coming in Sunday’s 1-1 draw against 10-man Sunderland.\nWe’ve not been doing well, admitted Emery after the match. Some players are still adapting and others know our system, but it will take time. Villa, who reached last season’s Champions League quarterfinals before narrowly losing to Paris Saint-Germain, will now try to find momentum in Europe. Bologna, back in continental action after winning the Italian Cup, provide their first test — a repeat of Villa’s 2-0 victory in last October’s Champions League group stage.\nNottingham Forest are also embarking on a milestone journey, marking their first European appearance since 1995–96. New manager Ange Postecoglou, fresh from guiding Tottenham to Europa League glory last season, takes his Forest side to Spain to face Real Betis on Wednesday. Forest, the two-time European Cup winners, have endured a slow start under Postecoglou with two defeats and a draw in his opening matches.\nI like my teams to play exciting football and score goals, Postecoglou said on his arrival. That won’t change here. Betis, last year’s Conference League runners-up under Manuel Pellegrini, boast former Manchester United winger Antony, who has returned on a permanent deal.\nElsewhere, Celtic travel to Serbia to face Red Star Belgrade in a battle of former champions, while Rangers enter the Europa League under pressure to make amends for domestic struggles.",
