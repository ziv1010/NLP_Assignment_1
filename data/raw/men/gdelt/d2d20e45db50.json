Juve Stabia now sits alone in fourth place in the Serie B table, with 28 points and 2 points over fifth-ranked US Cremonese – just behind Sassuolo, Spezia, and Pisa. The top three Serie B teams are promoted to Serie A at the end of the season, with the first two automatic qualifiers, and the third is determined by a playoff among teams finishing the season standings ranked three through six.\nKey Highlights of the Acquisition Process:\n- Investments and Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) – Brera Holdings has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Juve Stabia through share capital and reserve increases in the Club. These will be made by Brera via cash payments and issuances of BREA’s shares in a three-step process that ensures a seamless transition and continuity in club management. These three steps, upon conclusion, will give Brera Holdings 22%, 38%, and ~52% ownership of the Club. Upon completion of these three steps, Brera will be the Club’s majority shareholder, and a Shareholder Agreement with the current sole owner, Andrea Langella, will further enable integration into its multi-club framework. The first step, giving Brera 22% ownership, is expected to conclude by December 31, 2024.\n- Milestone-Based Compensation – The SPA includes provisions for additional compensation to Mr. Langella tied to performance-based milestones, such as qualification for Serie B promotion playoffs and promotion to Serie A. These incentives align Brera’s interests with Juve Stabia’s competitive success, reinforcing a focus on operational excellence.\n- Final Closing and Majority Control – The acquisition will conclude with a third and final closing, scheduled for March 31, 2025. At that point, Brera Holdings will secure ~52% ownership, establishing Brera as the controlling shareholder and enabling immediate integration of the Club into the Company’s multi-club framework. This phased approach ensures a seamless transition and continuity in Club management and prepares the Club for an IFRS audit according to the PCAOB guidelines for SEC disclosure filings.\nStrategic Rationale for the Acquisition\nBrera’s acquisition of Juve Stabia underscores its commitment to scaling its MCO model, which targets achieving potential operational efficiencies, cost synergies, and streamlined talent development across its portfolio. By integrating Juve Stabia into this model, Brera strengthens its ability to enhance revenue growth and create long-term value for shareholders.\n“With Serie B’s expanding commercial prospects, Juve Stabia offers a compelling opportunity for growth,” said Daniel McClory, Executive Chairman of Brera Holdings. “We are excited to partner with local management and invest in this historic team to capitalize on player trading opportunities, potentially secure a position in the Serie B playoffs, and ultimately pursue promotion to Serie A, all of which would augment Club revenue and unlock further value for our investors.”\nLooking Ahead\nAs Brera Holdings progresses through the Juve Stabia acquisition timeline, Mr. McClory said the Company remains committed to supporting the Club’s ambitions on and off the field. With a focus on scalable operations and strategic partnerships, we believe Brera is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the global football market.\nABOUT BRERA HOLDINGS PLC\nBrera Holdings PLC (Nasdaq: BREA) is dedicated to expanding its social impact football business by developing a global portfolio of emerging football and sports clubs. Building on the legacy of Brera FC, which it acquired in 2022, the Company aims to create opportunities for tournament prizes, sponsorships, and professional consulting services. Brera FC, recognized as \"The Third Team of Milan,\" has been crafting an alternative football legacy since its founding in 2000. The club also organizes the FENIX Trophy, a nonprofessional pan-European tournament acknowledged by UEFA. This tournament, which has been referred to as \"the Champions League for amateurs\" by BBC Sport, has garnered significant media coverage, including from ESPN.\nIn its efforts to broaden its reach, Brera expanded into Africa in March 2023 by establishing Brera Tchumene FC in Mozambique, which quickly rose to the First Division after winning its post-season tournament. In April 2023, the Company acquired a 90% stake in the North Macedonian first-division team Fudbalski Klub Akademija Pandev, now known as Brera Strumica FC. Additionally, in June 2023, Brera made a strategic investment in Manchester United PLC, realizing a 74% gain. The Company has further diversified its portfolio by acquiring a majority stake in UYBA Volley, an Italian women's professional volleyball team, in July 2023, assuming control of Bayanzurkh Sporting Ilch FC, a Mongolian National Premier League team, which became Brera Ilch FC, in September 2023, and establishing a joint stock company for the North Macedonian women's football club Tiverija Strumica, now known as Brera Tiverija FC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brera Strumica FC, in June 2024.\nMost recently, Brera announced plans to acquire an Italian Serie B club, having signed a binding term sheet with SS Juve Stabia SpA, “The Second Team of Naples,” targeting an initial closing within 2024. With a focus on bottom-up value creation, innovation-driven growth, and socially impactful outcomes, Brera Holdings endeavors to position itself as a forward-thinking player in the global sports landscape.
