It is better that he receives medical follow-up at his club.\nNorway coach Stale Solbakken added: “Erling took it hard when he realised that he could not fight for the team.\n“Fortunately, there is still plenty of self-confidence, talent and cohesion in this group to win points in the next matches.”\nThe 22-year-old Haaland has scored 42 goals in 37 matches for City since joining Pep Guardiola’s side from Borussia Dortmund last summer.\nCity are next in action on April 1 when they resume their Premier League title push at home to Liverpool and 10 days later play the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich.",
