In his absence, Czech international Patrik Schick has stepped up, thriving in the striker position and solidifying his role as a key player.\nSchick, 28, has seen a resurgence in form, contributing 16 goals across all competitions this season. He credits his turnaround to discussions with head coach Xabi Alonso, who encouraged him to make adjustments to his game.\n\"Things work well, and I am happy,\" said Schick, who had considered leaving the club earlier this season to secure more playing time. Instead, he has become a vital asset for Bayer Leverkusen, just in time for Tuesday's UEFA Champions League clash with Atletico Madrid.\nLeverkusen is riding high on an 11-match winning streak across all competitions, fueling hopes of retaining their Bundesliga title and achieving European success. While the Bundesliga title race with Bayern Munich remains fiercely contested, Leverkusen's Champions League campaign has been particularly impressive. They currently lead German clubs in the competition, sitting at the top of their group with 13 points.\n\"The right mentality is back,\" said team captain and Swiss international Granit Xhaka, reflecting on the team's improved focus and determination.\nDespite the strong performances, Alonso has maintained high expectations for his squad. Following a dominant 3-1 league win over Borussia Moenchengladbach, the Spanish coach expressed dissatisfaction with the team conceding a late goal. \"That was the moment we failed to keep up the mentality,\" Alonso said, urging his players to sustain their intensity.\nWith crucial matches against Atletico Madrid and Sparta Prague looming, Leverkusen has set its sights on making a deep run in the Champions League. After securing domestic glory last season, the team is eager to add international achievements to their resume.\nXhaka emphasized the importance of mental fortitude in their upcoming match against Atletico. \"The upcoming duel is a mentality issue,\" he said, highlighting the team's commitment to staying focused under pressure.\nAs Bayer Leverkusen pushes forward with renewed determination, the club's ambitions extend beyond domestic success, aiming to leave a lasting mark on European football this season.
