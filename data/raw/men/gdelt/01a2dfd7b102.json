Their treble in the 2022/23 campaign is proof of that, though according to Spanish outlet Marca, Guardiola believes there’s room for improvement.\nIndeed, City are firmly in the mix for West Ham’s Declan Rice who along with Mateo Kovacic, could be viewed as the successors to Ilkay Gundogan who’ll join Barcelona.\nElsewhere, RB Leipzig’s imperious centre-half, Josko Gvardiol, is wanted as an upgrade on Aymeric Laporte and Nathan Ake. If Gvardiol signs, it’ll be Laporte who is sold.\nBut according to Marca, Guardiola is also turning his attention to landing a world class right-back in the form of PSG ace, Achraf Hakimi.\nCity’s current frontline options in the position are Kyle Walker and Joao Cancelo. However, both could depart the Etihad before the summer is out.\nIndeed, Cancelo is surplus to requirements having surprisingly been loaned out to Bayern Munich in January. Cancelo was a two-time selection for the PFA Team of the Year prior to last season, though Guardiola’s mid-season change to a 3-2-4-1 formation saw Cancelo frozen out.\nWalker, meanwhile, is in advanced negotiations to join Bayern Munich. The 33-year-old remains one of the world’s best when it comes to nullifying opposing left wingers. However, Guardiola has publicly admitted Walker is not suited to his new system.\nThat was evidenced by the fact Walker was omitted from City’s starting line-up in the Champions League final against Inter Milan. Bayern have spied an opportunity to strike and per BILD, are prepared to break their in-house rule to sign Walker.\nBayern generally don’t offer more than one guaranteed year to players over the age of 30. Indeed, Manuel Neuer and Thomas Muller are recent examples of players who have been made to settle for 12-month extensions.\nHowever, BILD claim Bayern have lodged a two-year deal with an option for a third to help lure Walker to Bavaria.\nNegotiations are termed ‘advanced’, and per Marca, the player Guardiola will replace Walker and Cancelo with is Hakimi.\nThe 24-year-old Morocco international is far more comfortable in possession than Walker and more solid defensively than Cancelo.\nAs such, he’s seemingly viewed as the ideal player Guardiola wants to ‘perfect the machine’ at Man City.\nThat is a frightening thought for City’s rivals given the team already at Guardiola’s disposal have just won the treble.\nHowever, Guardiola is always striving for perfection and in Gvardiol, Rice and Hakimi, City may be even stronger next year.\nCity reportedly tried to sign Hakimi during his time at Borussia Dortmund. The article states they’ve launched a new move and are prepared to pay a ‘high fee’ to get a deal done.\nTRANSFER GOSSIP: Declan Rice chooses between Arsenal and Man City with £100m bid imminent; Man Utd striker target gets ‘here we go’ confirmation",
