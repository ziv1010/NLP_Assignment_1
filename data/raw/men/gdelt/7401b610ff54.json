Man Utd have preferred to keep Joshua Zirkzee as their rotation option for their new striker, spelling the end for their former Atalanta striker after two years in the Premier League.\nLast night, several sources confirmed a deal was struck between United and Napoli for Hojlund to move back to Serie A. The two clubs have agreed a loan move that could become permanent on certain conditions.\nAccording to The Athletic, the value of the potential permanent transfer for Hojlund will be €44m (£38.1m/$51.4m). That would represent a major loss on the £64m+£8m that United spent to sign him from Atalanta in 2025.\nBut the permanent move for Hojlund hinges on a factor that won’t be known for several months. The obligation is a conditional one, meaning it would only be activated if a certain target is reached.\nThe report explains that the condition for Hojlund’s permanent transfer is if Napoli qualify for the Champions League.\nOn paper, that’s something they should expect after winning Serie A last season and retaining the services of Antonio Conte as head coach, before strengthening their squad with the likes of Kevin De Bruyne from Manchester City, Noa Lang from PSV and Sam Beukema from Bologna.\nBut the last time Napoli won the league, they followed it up with a ninth-place finish, so there are never any guarantees.\nHojlund stance on Napoli move\nThe Athletic also relayed some doubts as to whether Hojlund himself would agree to the move, after previously aiming to fight for his place at Old Trafford.\nBut Fabrizio Romano has broken down those concerns, confirming Hojlund ‘has already accepted’ the move and ‘wants’ Napoli. Only some ‘small details’ are in the way of the move.\nRomano adds that Hojlund’s contract if he becomes a Napoli player on a permanent basis would last until 2030.\nOne important point overlooked in The Athletic‘s report but emphasised by Romano is that Napoli will also pay a loan fee of €6m (£5.2m/$7m) for Hojlund’s services.\nThat means, should they qualify for the Champions League, Hojlund’s move will be worth a total of €50m (£43.3m/$58.4m).\nAlthough they would be coming to terms with a transfer loss, that would be one of United’s biggest sales of all time and would provide them with a slight capital gain.\nMan Utd transfer news: Latest headlines\n👉 Bruno Fernandes ‘open’ to shock MLS move as Man Utd stance softens\n👉 Fabrizio Romano downplays reports Man Utd sale collapsing with ‘best efforts’ ongoing\n👉 Man Utd offer Onana to Prem club after keeper leaves Amorim ‘raging’\nHow Hojlund’s value has declined\nUnited identified Hojlund as their top target in the summer of 2023 and were initially expecting to pay no more than £45million (€54m, $60.3m).\nBut they ultimately forked out an initial £64million (€76.3m / $79.5m) and another £8million (€9.6m/$9.9m) in potential add-ons to sign the striker from Atalanta.\nIt was a fee that raised eyebrows at the time, given the Denmark international scored nine goals in 32 Serie A appearances in his solitary season at Atalanta.\nThe big-money transfer also came 12 months after Atalanta paid a reported fee of just under £15million (€17.8m / $18.6m) to sign him from Austrian outfit Sturm Graz.\nHojlund initially struggled to adapt to life in the Premier League, failing to score in his first 14 appearances in the English top-flight.\nHe did impress in the Champions League and also enjoyed a promising second-half to the 2023/24 campaign, finishing his first season at United with 16 goals in all competitions.\nBut the 22-year-old failed to kick on in his second term and his form actually regressed, scoring just 10 goals in 52 appearances in all competitions.\nJust four of those 10 goals came in the Premier League, and he has failed to score in 49 of his 62 top-flight appearances for United.\nHojlund went on a run of 21 games in all competitions without a goal between December, when he scored against Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League, and March, when he ended his drought against Leicester City.\nThe striker was once deemed as ‘unsellable’ by United but the club have changed their stance.\nHe still has plenty of potential to improve but his value has undoubtedly dropped in the last 18 months.",
