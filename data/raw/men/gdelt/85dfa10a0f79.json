  "body_text": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a long to-do list waiting for him at Manchester United.\nRatcliffe, founder of petrochemicals company INEOS, is buying a 25 per cent shareholding in the club for £1.3billion ($1.6bn) and there will not be a shortage of issues for the Manchester-born billionaire, who is based in Monaco, to wade through.\nThe Athletic breaks down six key items for Ratcliffe and INEOS to address…\nThe manager\nHad this minority investment gone through last summer, Erik ten Hag’s future would not even have been a subject of debate. The United manager was in a position of strength after winning the Carabao Cup, the club’s first trophy in six years, and guiding United back into the Champions League.\nAdvertisement\nBut a poor start to the season, which has seen them knocked out of the Champions League and Carabao Cup, as well as being 12 points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal in eighth, has led to mounting speculation over his future at Old Trafford. In November, The Athletic reported that there was a growing feeling of unrest in the squad, with some players beginning to lose belief in Ten Hag and his methods.\nWhile the INEOS deal was being thrashed out, it became apparent that United were reluctant, even powerless, to change course and dismiss a manager whose contract runs until the summer of 2025. INEOS has not said anything about the Dutchman’s future.\nThe executive team\nYou would expect the exact make-up of United’s new executive team to have been a crucial part of the discussions that took place between the Glazer family — the club’s U.S.-based majority owners — and Ratcliffe’s team.\nRichard Arnold, United’s chief executive, has already been replaced by Patrick Stewart, their general counsel, on an interim basis. But who will be the long-term CEO?\nJean-Claude Blanc, former chief executive of Italian club Juventus, who oversees the INEOS Sport portfolio, has joined the board and is under consideration to come in as United’s CEO.\nRatcliffe wants to be in charge of sporting decisions, which casts doubt on John Murtough’s future. Murtough is United’s football director, responsible for recruitment, and he will need to convince Ratcliffe he is the right person to continue in that role.\nSince Ten Hag became their manager in the summer of 2022, United have spent more than £330million ($400m) on signings, including €100m (£87.5m; $110m) on Antony and an initial £55m on Mason Mount.\nPaul Mitchell, formerly of Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, RB Leipzig and Monaco, was initially viewed as a strong candidate to lead the club’s football operations but talk about him joining the club has quietened down. Mitchell is credited with signing Son Heung-min at Spurs and Sadio Mane for Southampton. Other names linked include Crystal Palace’s Dougie Freedman and Newcastle United’s Dan Ashworth.\nAdvertisement\nSir Dave Brailsford, INEOS’ director of sport and the driving force behind British cycling’s successes at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, will play a prominent part in the club’s hierarchy, too. Brailsford has been actively involved in the running of Nice, the French top-flight club owned by INEOS since the summer of 2019, and will conduct a thorough review of United’s football operations as a member of the board.\nThe playing squad\nGiven Ratcliffe felt confident enough to question United signing Casemiro — then aged 30 — from Real Madrid on a five-year deal in August 2022, a transfer that will cost the club £70million if all add-ons are met, you can be certain he has an opinion on other members of the squad, too.\nYou wonder what he thinks of Jadon Sancho’s predicament. The England forward cost the club £75million in July 2021 and is now training alone after falling out with Ten Hag. Sancho, 23, hasn’t been in a United matchday squad since August.\nRatcliffe will have views on why United have been underperforming for the best part of a decade, having not won the Premier League since the 2012-13 season, and the make-up of the playing squad is sure to have been part of his evaluation.\nUnited are not shy when it comes to spending money, with more than £1billion going out on transfers since 2014, and there is very little to show for all that investment.\nRatcliffe will know the facts and figures behind each player and, with his sporting staff at INEOS, would have analysed where improvements could be made and at what expense.\nThe debt\nUnited owe more than £1billion through a combination of gross debt, their revolving credit facility and outstanding transfer payments.\nMost people would run a mile from investing in such a business but United posted record revenues of £648.4million for the year ended June 30. Although this was not enough to stop the club from recording a £28.7m loss, it showed what could be possible with someone other than the Glazers in total control.\nAdvertisement\nRatcliffe is known to be happy for the American family to still oversee the club’s commercial department, and, while any sense of the Glazers remaining is unpalatable for United’s supporters, the commercial income continues to grow.\nThis income stream totalled £302.9million, surpassing £300m for the first time, and represented a 17.5 per cent increase on the previous year.\nUnited recently signed a £900million, 10-year deal with Adidas, their kit supplier, and Qualcomm will become their front-of-shirt sponsor from next season. United, who had been seeking a package worth £60m annually, have agreed a minimum three-year deal with the U.S. technology company.\nThe INEOS bid has always maintained that Ratcliffe will not place any debt on the club, and that money — if he were to go down this route — would be borrowed against the petrochemicals company instead of United.\nOld Trafford\nEven though Old Trafford remains the largest club football ground in the United Kingdom, with a capacity of more than 74,000, its facilities have become dated and it lags behind other venues in the Premier League and across Europe.\nThe club belatedly announced in April last year that they had appointed architects Populous and management firm Legends International as master planners and consultants for a revamp of the stadium, which recently staged its 2,500th United home game.\nThe feasibility of several options was explored, including increasing the capacity, building a replacement stadium next door to the current one, and a development centred on the construction of a new main stand. That work has come to a standstill since the Glazers announced their strategic review this month last year.\nSources acting for the Qatari bid to buy United claimed that Sheikh Jassim would upgrade Old Trafford and Carrington, the club’s training complex, while Ratcliffe had never made such commitments until now.\nAdvertisement\nRatcliffe knows the stadium and training ground need to be addressed and is committing $300million (£245m) of his wealth for infrastructure upgrades at United. Given the need to invest in the squad, as well as the infrastructure, you would expect more attention to be paid to how Liverpool have gone about redeveloping Anfield — at a relatively modest cost — as opposed to potentially knocking Old Trafford down and starting from scratch.\nWhile it has not yet been officially agreed or signed, the cash injection is expected to happen and, as it would come out of Ratcliffe’s pocket, will not be added to the club’s existing debts.\nRebuilding relationships between fans and owners\nIt is not normally the case that minority investors throw their weight around in a public forum and divulge what is happening behind the scenes.\nBut relations between the Glazers and many United supporters are broken beyond repair and it will be on Ratcliffe to open a dialogue with fans and explain why he has bought a 25 per cent stake.\nThis would be even more important as the expectation is that he will take on responsibility for football operations, leaving the commercial side to the Glazers, meaning there has to be communication from him to explain the decisions he is going to be making.\nThe 71-year-old is known as a straight talker and not someone afraid to give an opinion, but there is an acceptance that he will need to be respectful of the fact he’d be a minority shareholder.\nDo not expect him to come out and say the Glazers have been terrible for the club.\n(Top photo: Steven Paston/PA Images via Getty Images)",
