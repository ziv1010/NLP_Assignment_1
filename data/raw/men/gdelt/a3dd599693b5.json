Their new manager Thiago Motta was at Bologna last season and he wants an instant reunion with the defender.\nArsenal have made the first big move in the race though and according to today’s edition of Corriere dello Sport, they’ve submitted an offer of €47m (£39.8m) for the 22-year-old.\nBologna swiftly ‘rejected’ that offer, before informing the Gunners’ sporting director Edu that they will only accept a bid of €50m (£42.4m).\nThey haven’t been deterred, and the report claims that Arsenal have given Bologna their ‘guarantee’ that they are ‘ready’ to submit a new offer and match their €50m valuation.\nREAD MORE: Arsenal rocked as Real Madrid, PSG track Gunners superstar for summer transfer, with groundwork laid\nChelsea could still make offer for Italy star\nSources exclusively revealed to TEAMtalk on Tuesday that Chelsea are also expected to submit an offer for Calafiori, so the battle for the centre-back might not be over just yet.\nCorriere dello Sport’s report doesn’t make clear whether Arsenal have officially sent their improved offer to Bologna or just given them their verbal ‘guarantee’ – so the Blues could have a window of opportunity to hijack their approach.\nThe problem for Enzo Maresca’s side, however, is that Chelsea cannot offer Champions League football to Calafiori, something the player considers a factor in deciding his next move.\nJuventus, on the other hand, are also at a disadvantage because they will struggle to match his €50m price tag, which Arsenal have already agreed to do.\nAs for Liverpool, their stance is not revealed in the report but there’s no doubt that they’re looking to sign a new centre-back, so they could still throw their hat into the ring.\nMikel Arteta is more than happy with his Arsenal centre-back partnership of Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba but wants more competition for them in case one gets injured.\nThat has happened on a few occassions over the past two seasons and had a negative effect on their Premier League title aspirations.\nCalafiori certainly has the potential to be an excellent long-term addition for the North London club and they seem determined to get their man, if the talk coming out of Italy is to be believed.\nIt will be interesting to see how this story develops in the coming days but it seems Arsenal are the favourites to sign Calafiori at this stage.\nDON’T MISS: Top 10 most expensive transfers between Premier League clubs: One team fills three spots",
