Welcome back any time!\"\nUlli told TWTD that he has contacted the Blues in order to put officials at the two clubs in touch with one another: “As our club recognises what’s going on between both sets of fans and its positive effect and want to play a friendly, I have approached [Town club secretary] Sally Webb on behalf of the board of directors of Fortuna Düsseldorf.”\nIn his letter to Town, Ulli wrote: “Our club chairman Peter Frymuth and our director of finance Paul JÃ¤ger would like to send an official invitation to the managing directors of ITFC to figure out whether ITFC would be interested in a friendly match or other official club activities, [perhaps] an exchange for youth teams or U21 teams in the future.”\nWhether the planned game would take place in Ipswich or Düsseldorf would form part of the proposed discussions between the clubs.\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nWould actually love a trip to the 'Esprit Arena'. would certainly be a more exciting occasion, better atmpsphere and better beer!\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
