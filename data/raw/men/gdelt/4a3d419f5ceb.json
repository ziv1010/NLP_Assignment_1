Siverio was just 23 when he took Manolo Marquez’s advice and followed in his footsteps to India.Siverio and Manolo know each other from their days at Las Palmas in Spain, so when the experienced coach asked if he wanted to give India a try, the striker didn’t think much. After two seasons with Hyderabad FC where they won the ISL Trophy in 2022, the duo went their separate ways: Manolo to FC Goa and Siverio to East Bengal, and later Jamshedpur FC.Now they are reunited. At Goa.“It’s important that a coach has confidence in the player and knows what he offers (on the field),” Siverio told TOI after a training session at the Field of Dreams in Guirim last week. “That’s why he took me to Hyderabad, now here. For me, he’s a coach who does not invent or experiment too much. Everyone knows what they have to do. That’s important because even if you sometimes have a bad game, you can still get a good result.”\nStay updated with the latest local news from your city on Times of India (TOI).
