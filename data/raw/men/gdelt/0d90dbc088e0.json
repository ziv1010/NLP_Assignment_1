All done.”\nSays our correspondent: “For a moment I thought she was going to ask the bloke if he wanted a nice cuppa and a biscuit, while he recovered from his terrible ordeal.”\nChamps & chumps\nScottish football is famous for the unbalanced nature of its contests.\nThe superstars of Rangers and Celtic hog the goals and glory while players from rival teams are content to saunter round the pitch, occasionally accidentally colliding with the ball, then politely kicking it back to the Old Firm chaps.\nOther European teams are obviously jealous of this style of football, and are now attempting to emulate it.\nWhich explains the recent Champions League final.\nReader Tom Bain read a report of the match in one newspaper which described the victory as: Intern Milan 0 PSG 5.\nSays Tom: “I thought that was a bit harsh for a punishment, on top of such a severe loss.”\nMind your language\nOur native tongue is a difficult lingo to learn, with its many grammatical contradictions, weird spellings and bizarre sounding words.\nHowever, plucky reader Craig Macauley rushes to its defence, and says: “English can be understood through tough thorough thought, though.”\nHard to swallow\nA question for the medical practitioners amongst our readership.
