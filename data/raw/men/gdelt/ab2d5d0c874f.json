That could change in the new year once third-place Champions League sides drop down, but no true big-hitters look likely to need a second-chance, providing the Reds with a free run to the final in Dublin.\nSaying all that, though, they still have a problem - defensively, Liverpool look poor, and the nature of the competition in the Europa League could see bad habits start to set in without them realising. Transfer those habits to the Premier League, and trouble could start to brew.\nThe Toulouse goal on Thursday night was simple enough: two passes through the lines exposed Liverpool’s extremely aggressive high line, allowing Thijs Dallinga a whole half to himself, bare down on a helpless Caoimhin Kelleher in goal and comfortably slot it past him.\nShould Liverpool employ those same tactics against Manchester City, then they’ll be signing their own Premier League title challenge death certificate. That’s not the only chance Toulouse had, either, and elite domestic sides will inevitably punish their lapses in defensive concentration. Old habits may die hard, but bad habits die even harder.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nGranted, Joe Gomez, Joel Matip and Luke Chambers aren’t regular starters, nor is Endo sitting in front of them, but their shape looks far too exposed if they’re to win gritty games of football later in the season.\nVirgil van Dijk will certainly add some more solidity when he comes back in, but Andy Robertson is set to miss an extended period of time out injured and defensive midfield is still an issue within the starting XI. Alexis Mac Allister far preferes receiving the ball on the half turn and progressing it forwards rather than patrolling the back four, while Endo is lacking the quality required of a title-winning side.\nStill, Jurgen Klopp doesn’t seem too concerned. Speaking in his post-match press conference, the Liverpool manager highlighted how the rebuilt squad still needs time to get to know one another, suggesting the aforementioned defensive frailties aren’t too much of an issue right now.\n“Result good, performance good,” Klopp said, “and there were especially a lot of really good individual performances, which is nice because it is important for development.\n“Besides the goal we conceded and the chance we gave them when Trent had his spectacular save, around that everything was what we expected.\n“Toulouse are a good team, they are playing football, but we put a proper shift in and that's what I wanted. The goals we scored were wonderful. I would say the right players scored the goals, all of them were really, really good. So, nothing to complain about really.”\nSportsbreaks.com is a leading sports supporter travel brand offering ticket-inclusive packages to many of the world’s top sporting events, including world-class football match breaks with some of Europe’s top teams.\nMore Liverpool stories\nFormer Liverpool striker Emile Heskey speaks to FourFourTwo about being one of only two players to have scored 100 Premier League goals without taking a penalty.\nMeanwhile, the Reds already have an \"agreement in place\" to sign Victor Osimhen.\nAgainst Everton, Mohamed Salah hit a new goal milestone with his brace in the derby match.\nRyan is a staff writer for FourFourTwo, joining the team full-time in October 2022.
