There’s no sign of the calm, collected, analytical Xabi.\n‘Right now, he’s a coach trapped by the pressure, aware that time is running out. Real Madrid’s football has ceased to be about tactics and has become about survival.’\nAS, though, has observed how the Madrid players are fully behind Alonso and are backing him, although there is no guarantee that the former Los Blancos midfielder will not be sacked in the coming weeks.\nMadrid played well against Man City in the Champions League last week, with Rodrygo hugging the former Liverpool midfielder after his goal against the Premier League club.\nAS noted: ‘Perhaps Xabi Alonso will finish the season; perhaps he’ll be sacked in a matter of days.\n‘That question remains unanswered. But one thing is certain: the players are with the coach, Xabi is not alone.\n‘This attitude was symbolised by a gesture… which is much more than that: Vinicius’s embrace during the celebration.’\nThe report added: ‘Whatever happens with Xabi Alonso, it could be said that he’s winning his first major battle at Real Madrid: winning back the dressing room.\n‘A dressing room he had practically lost not so long ago, even though – understandably -he wants to deny and hide it from the outside.\n‘The reality is that the atmosphere became quite tense. But now it’s very different.’\nREAD NEXT: Man Utd star opts for huge Real Madrid transfer\nTottenham urged to hire Real Madrid managerial target Jurgen Klopp\nAlonso is not out of the woods yet, and rumours linking former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp with the role at Madrid persist.\nSky Germany journalist Florian Plettenberg reported on X on December 11 that “Jurgen Klopp is among the candidates” to replace Alonso “in the event of a dismissal”.\nKlopp, who won the Premier League and the Champions League during his time as Liverpool manager, has been working as the Head of Global Soccer for Red Bull GmbH since January 2025.\nOliver Mintzlaff, who is the CEO of Corporate Projects and New Investments of Red Bull GmbH, said last week regarding Klopp and Madrid rumours: “Jurgen has made it clear that he doesn’t want to be a coach at the moment. Whether that changes at some point in his life, of course, is possible.\n“But I can see how passionate he is about this job, how many ideas he has, and how much he wants to develop further. Therefore, I’m completely relaxed.”\nShould Real move for Klopp, they may now have to do so with more urgency, though, after former Tottenham Hotspur chairman Lord Sugar told the north London club to sack Thomas Frank as their manager and turn to former Liverpool boss Klopp.\nLord Sugar believes that ENIC International Limited could be able to tempt Klopp with the promise of a lot of funds.\nThe 78-year-old wrote on X on December 14 after Tottenham lost 3-0 to Nottingham Forest away from home at the City Ground on Sunday: “With the massive fortune of the Lewis family it would be a win win situation if they hired Jurgen Klopp in January. Loads of money for players and a great manager. Who agrees #coys @SpursOfficial.”\nWhen pointed out by a follower on X that Klopp “won’t touch it with a barge pole”, Lord Sugar replied: “It is the way he is approached.\n“If it’s put as a kind of challenge and no pressure just prove you can do it mate.\n“The money is there if you want it for players. As well as we are in London new experience. Name your price.”\nLatest Real Madrid transfer news: Man Utd raid, Chelsea lead race\nMeanwhile, Chelsea are leading the race for a Premier League star also on Real Madrid’s radar.\nA Real Madrid midfielder is said to be the ‘dream signing’ for Manchester United, but Los Blancos have no plans whatsoever of selling him anytime soon.\nAnd finally, sources have told TEAMtalk’s transfer correspondent, Graeme Bailey, that Real Madrid want to sign a Man Utd defender in 2026.",
