  "body_text": "Everton 0 - 3 Manchester United\nEverton return to action for the first time since the Premier League deducted 10 points as Manchester United come to a Goodison Park that is expected to be a bearpit of defiance in front of the Sky cameras.\nAmadou Onana is still suffering from a calf injury that keeps him out while Seamus Coleman finally returns to the first-team bench almost 7 months after he left the Leicester City pitch on a stretcher with a serious knee injury, while Beto is 'unavailable'.\nThere was a phenomenal welcome of booing accompanying fans around the entire ground holding up 'Premier League – Corrupt' cards in response to the draconian imposition of a 10-point deduction by their 'independent commission 9 days ago.\nThe visitors kicked off and did well to keep possession despite decent pressing from the Everton players. But after just 2 minutes Garnacho produced a moment of magic from a deep Rashford cross to destroy Everton hearts, an acrobatic wonder that flashed past Pickford into the Gwladys Street net.\nIt was 5 minutes before Everton got any worthwhile possession, but Harrison was denied a free-kick. Everton tried to take more control but Man Utd were still having a lot more of the ball. Rashford got forward, his shot flicking off Mykolenko's boot for a corner that Shaw smashed just over the bar.\nEverton finally had some possession but could not get forward and resorted to crosses that were easily defended, then Gana gave the ball away. Young gave away a foul on Garnacho, and Man Utd then played keep-ball.\nEverton's build-up was painfully slow, Harrision's eventual cross easily blocked. Gana's cross then went over everyone, with Calvert-Lewin in completely the wrong position and Everton then had to defend, with a dreadfully late lunge on Garnacho from Young for his requisite early yellow card.\nEverton repelled the free-kick but struggled to build anything approaching an attack, Harrison losing the ball. Young and Gana going for the same ball as McTominay cruised into the fray for a Blues free-kick that was really, really poor.\nMcTominay fouled Harrison and Doucoure demanded that he be booked... and so Doucoure himself was duly booked. What an absolute idiot! From the free-kick, Harrison's cross was blocked for a corner powered straight at Onana by an unchallenged Calvert-Lewin, who this time was in a perfect position to score but completely failed to apply the required directional control on his header.\nCalvert-Lewin then powered a snapshot toward the corner of goal, that Onana got across brilliantly to parry back into play, enabling McNeil to almost score but his shot lacked power and Mainoo was able to clear off the line. Docuocore then mishit his shot just wide. McNeil got forward but could not beat Mainoo's block, the subsequent corner repelled.\nMore testing times came for the Everton defence before they could get the ball forward again, Pickford on a free-kick from the centre-spot that came to nothing. Calvert-Lewin ran at the retreating Man Utd defence but his shot was blocked; however, a cross from Young was headed over by Calvert-Lewin leaping high.\nCalvert-Lewin ran at them again with the ball but this time it went through to Gana, who did what Gana so often does in front of goal: he skied it.\nAnother deep free-kick found McNeil who was fouled but the ref played advantage to everyone's annoyance, and the Blues walked off at half-time a little unlucky not to have converted at least one of the chances they had created through sheer hard work.\nDespite Everton restarting, it was Man Utd who attacked with more drive, McTominay firing over. But Fernandes fouled Gana, however, any impetus was lost. Eventually they worked the ball to Harrison but his cross was straight to Onana.\nMykolenko was blocked by Maguire but nothing given. Martial was booked for a dive but on replay it was clear that Young had put his foot into the player's path. The VAR invited the ref to take another look at it, and it was very clear that the ref had made a mistake. He rescinded the yellow card and gave Man Utd a penalty, Young escaping a second yellow card for his infraction. From the spot, Rashford lashed it high into the net.\nEverton did their best to respond, Gana powered a tremendous curving strike on target but Onana tracked it all and palmed it over with a superb save. There were then screams for an Everton penalty after Tarkowski was held in the penalty area. Nothing given. The ball fell to Mykolenko but he fired straight across goal.\nThe visitors got forward and won a corner, they reworked it around but were kept away from goal before winning another corner. Everton cleared but it came right back for another corner and this time Garnacho from a similar position, lashed his shot sky high.\nEverton broke with a good move but Harrison's cross was behind Calvert-Lewin who could not convert. Young got a great cross in but Lindelof was able to head it behind for an Everton corner that Onana grasped at the second attempt. Harrison's cross fell for Doucoure but his strike was easily blocked for a corner that was not worked well at all, ending up back with Pickford.\nRashford got forward and crossed well for Garnacho who tried a wild strike at the far post that hit the side netting. In the next attack, Martial walked in their third to end the game as a contest, not by any means the result Everton needed on such a crucial weekend.\nMykolenlo got into the area on Danjuma's excellent pass and smacked his shot off the bottom of the United crossbar and out with Onana well beaten for once. Calvert-Lewin should have fought for a good ball into the Man Utd area but Maguire was easily able to shepherd him away.\nGarner tried a wild shot that flew wildly away from goal, and Chermiti replaced Calvert-Lewin. Pellistri got a chance to shoot but Pickford saved it comfortably. Rashford tried to play in Fernandes for the 4th but Tarkowski had other ideas, clearing it behind.\nAt the other end, Chermiti fired in a decent shot that flew just past the post as the team had to play out a pointless 6 added minutes in front of a rapidly emptying and thoroughly depressed Goodison Park, as another Everton chance from a late corner was cleared off the line.\nEverton: Pickford, Young [Y:21'] (72' Patterson), Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Mykolenko, Gana [Y:90+2'], Garner, Doucoure [Y:30'] (90' Dobbin), Harrison, McNeil (72' Danjuma), Calvert-Lewin (82' Chermiti).\nSubs not Used: Virginia, Keane, Godfrey, Coleman, Hunt.\nManchester United: Onana, Dalot, Maguire, Lindelof, Shaw (76' Wan-Bissaka), McTominay, Mainoo (72' Amrabat), Garnacho (72' Pellestri), Fernandes, Rashford, Martial (85' Mejbri).\nSubs not Used: Bayindir, Varane, Reguilon, Van de Beek, Hugill.\nReader Comments (228)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.
