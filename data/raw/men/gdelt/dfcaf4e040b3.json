Third place went to Liverpool in Jurgen Klopp's final game.\nAt Manchester City, Foden struck twice early on as the team secured the Premier League title with a convincing 3-1 win over West Ham.\nThere were few signs of last-day nerves from Guardiola's dominant side, although a spectacular effort from Mohammed Kudus just before half-time at the Etihad Stadium did give rivals Arsenal brief hope.\nYet that was soon extinguished as Rodri drove home City's third.\nThe victory ensured they could not be caught by the second-placed Gunners regardless of their result against Everton, which ended 2-1 to the Gunners.\nArsenal had needed a favour from West Ham, who were already confirmed in ninth place and were playing out the final match of David Moyes' second spell as manager.\nWith City having shown little sign throughout the run-in of pressure affecting them, only optimistic Arsenal supporters were expecting them to slip up.\nIt took less than two minutes to dash even their hopes as City powered out of the traps to put the matter beyond all reasonable doubt.\nCarson was reportedly removed from the party at 4am after trying to fight a fellow reveller\nMatheus Nunes enjoyed sipping a drink after his debut season with Manchester City\nGrealish made plenty of room for alcohol as he got into the groove of his party boy persona\nAfter wild celebrations on the pitch, the players took the fun back to the dressing room\nMan City became the first team in history to win four consecutive English top-flight titles\nPhil Foden got City off to a flyer against West Ham, scoring a screamer inside two minutes\nRodri added his name to the scoresheet on a fantastic day for the champions at the Etihad\nWith the sun blazing down and their player of the season Foden at his magical best, they did it in style.\nFoden took a Bernardo Silva pass on the right and cut inside, skipping past a challenge from James Ward-Prowse and drilling a left-foot shot into the top corner from the edge of the box.\nThe atmosphere had already been buoyant but it was at this point the party really seemed to begin and City revelled in the occasion.\nWest Ham, without Jarrod Bowen due to tonsillitis, could do little to repel the hosts and it seemed only a matter of time before they doubled their lead as Jeremy Doku twice tested Alphonse Areola.\nRodri also lashed an effort wide but the second goal duly arrived on 18 minutes as Doku pulled the ball across the box and Foden swept home with a first-time shot.\nErling Haaland looked set to add another but Konstantinos Mavropanos did just enough to put him off as he shaped to shoot before Areola also denied the Norwegian.\nThe Hammers stirred before the break as Kudus forced a save from Stefan Ortega and then pulled one back with a stunning overhead strike.\nIt came following a corner as the ball struck Tomas Soucek and was flicked up into the air, with Kudus reacting instinctively to connect with a powerful bicycle kick.\nErling Haaland scored 27 goals on his way to winning the Premier League Golden Boot\nFoden (centre) has played a massive part in their success this season winning the Football Writers' Player of the Year award as well as the Premier League Player of the Year\nWith news filtering through soon after that Arsenal had equalised against Everton, to some the seeds for second-half drama may have been planted, but in reality there was little chance.\nHaaland fired narrowly over and Kevin De Bruyne shot just wide soon after the break.\nCity tightened their grip and West Ham had seen little of the ball when Rodri powerfully guided home City's third from the edge of the box just before the hour.\nThere seemed little motivation from West Ham to respond and City calmly stroked the ball around.\nHaaland went close to adding another when the ball glanced off his shoulder and flew inches wide.\nSome hearts may have been in mouths when Soucek put the ball into the net two minutes from time but it clearly struck his arm and was disallowed by VAR.\nCity saw out five minutes of stoppage time without alarm and the celebrations began in earnest with thousands of fans ignoring requests to keep off the pitch.\nBut after the game, Guardiola cast doubt over his long-term Manchester City future after admitting he is running out of things to achieve.\nArsenal will be left to rue Son Heung-min's failed opportunity against Man City mid-week\nArsenal threw away three points in a costly 2-0 defeat to Aston Villa last month\n'In terms of numbers, nobody has been better than us - the records, the goals, the points and four in a row,' said Guardiola, who praised Arsenal counterpart Arteta and departing Liverpool boss Klopp.\n'If I land here tomorrow and you say I will win six Premier Leagues in seven years, I would say 'Are you crazy?'. It's impossible. We have done something unbelievable.\n'Six Premier Leagues in seven years, in this country with the modern football and the teams and everything. The teams and the organisation surprises me, it's an incredible club.'\nThis is Guardiola's 12th league title in 15 top-flight seasons as a manager and he is looking to add another FA Cup to his CV in next weekend's Wembley final against rivals Manchester United.\nThe double would come hot on the heels of last season's treble, leaving the City boss - whose deal runs out in 2025 - running out of things to motivate him.\n'The reality is I'm closer to leaving than to staying,' Guardiola told Sky Sports. 'It's eight years, will be nine.\n'Right now my feeling is I want to stay next season. We talked with the club, we have time to talk next season because I have to see the players as well, (to see) if they follow me, they follow us, for many reasons. I will stay and during the season we will talk when calm.'\nAsked in the press conference if he feels like he has completed English football and what he felt was left to achieve, Guardiola shrugged his shoulders and said: 'I had that feeling last season.\nIlkay Gundogan lifted the trophy as part of their Treble success last season\n'When we won in Istanbul (in the Champions League final) I said, 'It's over, what am I doing here? It's over, there's nothing left'.\n'But I have a contract, I'm here and still enjoying. Some of the moments I'm a bit tired but some of the moments I love, and after I said 'OK, we are here'.\n'(We) start winning games, looking good, different players, new players and I start to think about, 'No-one has done four in a row, why don't we try?' And now I feel 'It's done, so what next?' I don't know right now.\n'I know next is the FA Cup. Gary Lineker said to me, I didn't know, that no team has done back-to-back Premier Leagues and FA Cups.\n'It is our rivals and now what I want is for my players is to enjoy this two, three days, then we have two days to prepare the final.'\nMost watched Sport videos\n- Disgusting drink act caught on camera at ICC T20 World Cup\n- Tiffany Salmond dazzles in red bikini at Bondi Icebergs\n- Team GB Winter Olympics hero: Matt Weston wins skeleton gold\n- IOC President in tears after Ukrainian athlete is kicked out\n- NBA player makes long-awaited debut after battle with cancer\n- Team USA skier Breezy Johnson gets engaged after crash\n- Aussie snowboarder Scotty James shows off his dance moves\n- Has VAR broken football?
