The midfielder has also represented England under former manager Gareth Southgate.\nMeanwhile, Zubimendi was close to joining Liverpool in the summer transfer window but later changed his mind and decided to stay at his boyhood club.\nWith Sociedad struggling to perform this season, interest from Man City has come at the perfect time for him and it could provide him the opportunity to play under one of the best managers in world football.\nGuardiola’s side have been linked with a move for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres as well, showing that they are ready to splash the cash again.\nMan City have looked a completely different side without Rodri\nSince suffering the injury against Arsenal this season, Rodri has been out of action and his absence has been felt massively by Guardiola’s side.\nMan City will be up against Liverpool in the Premier League this weekend and this will be their biggest test of the season.\nTo face the Premier League and the Champions League leaders while going through your worst form for years will not be easy for Guardiola and his team.",
