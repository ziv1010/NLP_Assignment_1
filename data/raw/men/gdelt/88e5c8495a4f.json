Maybe he's got something to prove.\nWhen we don't have much spare change it's a short term solution,however if he's on fire for us will he just jump ship again end of season ?\nI thought the plan would be to spend on players who would develop and show a return on investment.\n6 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:19:23\n7 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:21:02\n8 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:26:02\nHopefully the latter. Loan looks a good deal for a player with ability, track record, good physical characteristics and goal threat.\nHe's versatile too and can play across the front line as a modern forward, rather than a conventional / traditional striker like DCL. Opens up up more tactical options for Dyche.\n9 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:26:35\n10 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:26:39\n11 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:32:18\n12 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:33:12\n13 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:35:24\nWhat antics was that?\n14 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:40:06\n15 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:42:28\n16 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:43:31\n17 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:44:43\n18 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:45:45\nReally?\n19 Posted 20/07/2023 at 14:51:34\n20 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:04:59\n21 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:05:40\n22 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:07:19\n23 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:09:36\nNo grudges here on his change of mind in January... when the manager who recruited you is sacked right before you sign, you've got every right to step back.\n24 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:09:47\n25 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:21:14\n26 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:21:47\nGary I very much doubt anyone on here is a snow flake as you call them. I certainly am not, and I'll be damned if I alter my opinions just to not have some tit calling me a snowflake, not that I'm calling you a tit Gary, but isn't one of the terms relating to a snowflake, unable to deal with opposing opinions?\nSo you are in fact a snowflake yoursel.\n27 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:21:51\n£3.5m is a touch steep for a loan fee but not that unusual for a player of this ability. He will be a really useful player for us. He is quicky, tricky, feisty and crucially can find the back of the next with either feet. I think on a good day he is actually similar in respects to Richarlison. Though not so good in the air.\nHis versatility makes him an especially sensible addition and he has performed well as striker in the past though i'd expect him to be mainly playing of the left or right. Or possibly as a second striker off DCL is Dyche fancies 442.\nI think Everton fans will like him. Decent chance he gets 8-10 goals for us this season. I wonder if there's a purchase price.\n28 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:23:36\n29 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:24:43\n30 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:24:52\nIts a bit worrying that he couldnt get game time at Spurs despite a stuttering Richy and an out of sorts Son at the time.\nHowever if we are set to lose Gray we need someone like Danjuma.\nIve also read conflicting reports on Gnonto that we've agreed terms and his agent is in London finalizing the deal with the opposing report saying now we've got Danjuma subject him not making a last-minute change of mind that we have pulled out of the Gnonto deal.\nPersonally, I won't be happy until Maupay goes, and we get a decent goalscorer in.\n31 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:29:13\n32 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:30:30\n33 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:37:28\n34 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:37:30\n35 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:37:43\n36 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:39:51\n37 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:41:30\n38 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:41:37\n39 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:48:33\n40 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:51:03\n41 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:53:34\nDCL played against Brighton and played well and even set up the first goal\nHe was a focal point for the wingers\n42 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:54:04\n43 Posted 20/07/2023 at 15:54:05\n44 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:02:27\n45 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:05:53\n46 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:09:15\nLook I'm not being negative about him as a player. A decent attacking option that can play a few positions up front. It's obviously a means to get a player for this year for 3.5m who would cost considerably more to get permanently.\nYou only have to see the comments on here to know the guy is not coming with a clean slate, if he struggles to hit the ground running his history will be a stick some will beat him with.\nOn the other hand, he could have a point to prove and a bit of extra incentive to prove people wrong.\nAn option to buy for the right price would be good as if we getting him firing and in top form we don't have to let him go, for villareal to reap the benefits.\n47 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:13:03\nWe've spent £3.5m on a player who, when in the championship, scored just less than a goal every 2 games, and failed to score in the premiership - and we only have him for a year.\nAnd we've just sold a player for £3.5m (initial payment) who, when in the championship, scored just less than a goal every 2 games and even managed to score in the premiership.\nForgive me if I'm not ecstatic about this oneâ€¦\n48 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:13:09\nFrom what others have said, Danjuma appears to check both the striker and wing boxes, which is good in one sense, but makes me fear that we won't sign a true striker, which leaves us with Cannon as our only clear back-up up top if DCL gets injured.\nI sure hope that there's a reasonable option to buy if he has a strong season for us.\n49 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:13:37\nWe are all entitled to opinions right or wrong. Very few come on here to offend anyone, but you seem to take personal offence against anyone who differs from you.\nBut I'm sure even you agree that we are all, as Everton supporters entitled to say what ever we FKG LIKE about the team we support.\n50 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:17:00\n51 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:17:43\n52 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:19:33\nHis loan fee (reported £3.5) is relatively insignificant IF we are planning to use the money saved to buy the striker we need. I don't know this but I hope and pray this means we now can go all out and get Bilal-Toure, Brobbey from Ajax (that is a bit of a dream signing) or perhaps Beto.\nThis is a no brainer signing, he was excellent two seasons ago for Villareal and did OK for Spurs last year, for those judging him because he didn't get in above Kuleveski, Richy & Son, give yer head a wobble. He also comes in with some PL experience. Maybe he will feel he has a point to prove.\nDanjuma can play anywhere across the line. He prefers to drift in from the left but can also play as a main striker or on the right. He is more like Richy if anyone. He isn't a target man but is very mobile. For these reasons I still think we will bring in a bigger striker who gives us something to aim for.\nI honestly can't fault this business if my above prediction is correct. Let's welcome him with open arms. Now for one of the above strikers and Wharton from Blackburn. Shift a bit more deadwood and I will be pretty happy with that.\n53 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:31:25\n54 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:36:34\nWoah damn, that was a run of Steves. Steve Shave is the preferred\n55 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:37:37\n56 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:37:54\nMy concern with it being a loan and seeing Burnley in all the Dyche years is that Sean not only subs late he rarely uses his loan signings.\n57 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:39:18\nThe game is only about money and prestige. So he was ready to sign for Everton when his greedy vampire called an agent phoned to let him know he had got him a better deal with chance to play in Europe with a top 6 club. What do you do, turn them down.?\nThere is no thing as a friendly deal, they are business deals, and the club you are with will sell you without blinking an eye if they are making a profit from you.\nWhat you have to ask yourself at a new signing is, will he help out in an area that we needed, will he help bring out the best in the players he plays with, did we need this position strengthened,and are we getting value for money spent.\n58 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:42:58\n59 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:45:44\n60 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:52:39\n61 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:54:11\nRight, I'll try my best to see this as an improvement both administratively and on the pitch or bench, or maybe just a lie down for 5 minutes to see if any other signings make me see the light. Did I ever mention that as a teenager I used to go spud picking down around Finch Farm, true, 12/6d a day.\nStill, the cricket's going well.\n62 Posted 20/07/2023 at 16:55:39\nHis stats from the previous season at Villarreal were pretty good 10 goals, three assists in 23 league games.\nSix goals from 11 Champions League matches. Last season was a disjointed one so maybe that's why he didn't perform so well.\nThose 21/22 stats prove that he is not shy in sticking the ball into the onion bag, in a decent standard league too. Dyche will have him fit as a fiddle by the season's start so it's possible that his good form from a year ago could return.\nBased on that I think it's a no-brainer to get the player in and give us the much needed forward threat and some goals. They are all risks to a degree but this is one that looks worth taking.\nIs there any information yet about us having an option/obligation to buy ? If Dyche gets him banging 10 goals this season we will want to keep him.\n63 Posted 20/07/2023 at 17:05:14\nThis may keep our investment price on Gnonto low by showing we have some cover for that position. Getting Danjuma over the line may ward off any last minute moves by Dirty Leeds after Gnonto has said he approves. Thelwell may know how to do the business in proper sequence which would obviously bode well for our future. Just speculation.\n64 Posted 20/07/2023 at 17:06:22\nAt 26 he should be up for the challenge, to earn one more big money move.\nSo something that we haven't seen for years.\nActually, to keep us up might need 25 goals from the lad.\nFingers crossed not another dud. UTFT.\n65 Posted 20/07/2023 at 17:12:28\n66 Posted 20/07/2023 at 17:33:49\n67 Posted 20/07/2023 at 17:39:06\n68 Posted 20/07/2023 at 17:43:16\n69 Posted 20/07/2023 at 17:49:49\n70 Posted 20/07/2023 at 18:06:42\n71 Posted 20/07/2023 at 18:12:01\nJust my own personal opinion. It's the same with Mahrez (among others) refusing to play for Leicester when City were after him. If I had been in charge of City it would've been interest over the minute he refused to play for Leicester.\n72 Posted 20/07/2023 at 18:19:26\nANC in January.\nSo thats a plus.\n73 Posted 20/07/2023 at 18:40:00\n74 Posted 20/07/2023 at 18:47:33\nSo while signing a back up striker for DCL would be ideal, we clearly need at least one and possibly 2 other options along with the youngsters.\nDanjuma and Gnonto give us those options. Both are in the Richarlison mould of being able to play in any of the front positions. We don't seem to mind versatile defenders, so why the pigeon holing of forward players?\nIf we can then add a number 9 type to the squad it will be icing on the cake. If we can keep DCL fir for 30 odd games it will be a half decent cake to ice.\nFinally, cut the guy some slack. He agreed a deal when Lampard was manager. Between that deal and the signing the manager was sacked. He then got another offer. Simple choice. Go to a club in turmoil or to a seemingly settled club. Would anyone have done anything different?\n75 Posted 20/07/2023 at 18:50:05\n76 Posted 20/07/2023 at 18:53:04\nWe can argue the pros & cons all day & night.\nIt will be a boss deal if he's a success and bangs in a load of goals, Or it won't if he doesn't !!\nWe've never really done a bad deal for someone who goes and scores loads of goals.\nThen we can say if it was worth it or not !\n77 Posted 20/07/2023 at 18:58:27\nPlease Please give Cannon a chance to prove himself to the club.\nFrom what I understand Cannon was at Finch Farm during the summer break upgrading his skills and fitness ready for the new season.\nAt least we know Cannon would be committed to the club.\nWhy do we assume these continental signings will be an asset to the club in the near future.\n78 Posted 20/07/2023 at 19:03:26\nEverton have to adapt, improvise and overcome now, more than ever before, by self inflicted neglect by the Chairman and Board, over decades running the club to the brink.\nBut this could be a good signing and I hope he has a point to prove.\nHe must be better than Biley, Mick Ferguson and Ainscough, in those days.ðŸ‘\nSeriously right now, any squad addition is a boost, and it gives Sean Dyche more options, and more scope to find some reliable and hopefully potent striking formations.\nI'm quietly confident this season, Sean Dyche will get good consistent form, from his squad.\nUTFTs!\n79 Posted 20/07/2023 at 19:09:17\n81 Posted 20/07/2023 at 19:21:47\nFrom my perspective it is just about defending the good parts of Everton from attacks deserved by others upstairs.\nPlease let David Peate know that we can work it out just fine without gallery drama. It happens, David.\n82 Posted 20/07/2023 at 19:22:34\nYes he was at Finch Farm and had photos but then Everton sacked Lampard.\nWe were in complete turmoil. I don't blame him for going somewhere else, it's his decision not to play for a club who suddenly sacks the manager who wanted him and all the negativity that when on.\n83 Posted 20/07/2023 at 19:25:30\nYes, it's all about opinions with all of us, but I just think the club had a lot to answer for and it wasn't all his fault why he suddenly went someone else.\n84 Posted 20/07/2023 at 19:41:09\n85 Posted 20/07/2023 at 19:50:22\n86 Posted 20/07/2023 at 20:03:55\nClerk: \"What kind of work are you looking for, Mr Davies?\"\nTom: \"Footballer.\"\nClerk: \"Are you taking the piss?\"\nTom: \"Skateboarding?\"\n87 Posted 20/07/2023 at 20:10:25\n88 Posted 20/07/2023 at 20:21:57\nAs for Danjuma, personally, I'd tell him to bugger offâ€¦ but if he joins us, I'll back him and hope he's a success.\n89 Posted 20/07/2023 at 20:31:03\nTom has been paid up to the middle of July by Everton so he isn't eligible for unemployment benefit until round about now, and as he refused to sign a new contract, meaning work I doubt he will get any money at all from that Avenue, I hope he isn't left homeless!\n90 Posted 20/07/2023 at 20:55:10\nKeep the real funds for the lad from Leeds... a quality player and young too, who will only improve us, I believe.\n91 Posted 20/07/2023 at 21:14:01\n92 Posted 20/07/2023 at 21:35:12\nDanjuma has mostly operated from the left but I can't see him playing there for us. My guess is that he will be used as the third strike option with a top young striker to follow but primarily as a first choice right winger.\nEven though Danjuma over the last few seasons has barely played in that role, Dyche always seems to prefer conventional wide men with the likes of Lennon and Gudmonssen on the right and McNeil and Cornet predominantly on the left when in charge of Burnley.\nIf our squad was in a much stronger position, I wouldn't mind seeing two left-wingers come through the door as I have always viewed Dwight McNeil like a Bastian Schweinsteiger type player in that, at 24 or so, he converted from a wide player to more centrally.\nI don't think McNeil has the pace or trickery to be a top wide player but I think he has become a much better footballer over the last 6 months. I would like to see him on the left of a midfield three long term.\nInteresting to see if he plays both new signings as right-wingers considering they are both right-footed and McNeil looks our only decent wideman.\n93 Posted 20/07/2023 at 21:36:02\n94 Posted 20/07/2023 at 21:37:55\n95 Posted 20/07/2023 at 21:58:52\n96 Posted 20/07/2023 at 22:03:08\nEverton have had more than their fair share of injuries and the players who missed many games last season no doubt contributed to the position they were in.\nWe are still unsure about the likes of DCL and dare I say Dele Alli and Gbamin but certainly we cannot afford to have no replacements for Iwobi, Onana and Doucoure based on their contributions last season.\nWe have to take what we can get and like most fans at most clubs this time of year hope that it is sufficient to keep the club competitive.\n97 Posted 20/07/2023 at 22:14:43\nFair enough he moved Elsewhere, but a bit shitty imo. Some fans won't forgive him until he's banging goals left, right and centre was my point.\nI'll judge on performance.\n98 Posted 20/07/2023 at 22:56:07\n99 Posted 20/07/2023 at 23:05:49\nThis could well be the very snarl that we've lacked since Dogs of War days. Maybe, just maybe, some backbone, cohesion, give the referees something to mull over instead of utter contempt and disdain usually reserved for the mighty, if slightly dazed blues comeback to the respectable end of the table.\nOr not...\n100 Posted 20/07/2023 at 23:16:37\nSmooth-talking Frank convinced him to come to us, and in the process turn down far better teams. Then we rather comically sacked Frank before the boy had signed. At the same time we had fans chasing player's cars down the street and a load of protests. Plus we were shit and looked destined for relegation.\nHe changed his mind, and who could bloody blame him? He had no idea who would replace Frank. How could he know if the new manager would even want him?\nHe made the sane decision. Anyone who thinks otherwise is simply unreasonable.\nAs soon as he pulls on the blue shirt, all must be forgotten. He did nothing wrong.\n101 Posted 20/07/2023 at 23:25:07\n102 Posted 20/07/2023 at 00:01:27\n103 Posted 21/07/2023 at 01:34:02\nI hope Snr Danjuma can eradicate that stereotype when and if he's playing for us.\n104 Posted 21/07/2023 at 05:15:44\nI think I would have realised that my actions made me look extremely unprofessional and would have taken to social media to offer up some sort of explanation and an apology.\nYou never know, at some stage that club that you completely disrespected may end up being your only option. It may not be so embarrassing having the photoshoot in full kit and the standard ''It's great to be here'' interview if you have at least acknowledged your prior decisions.\n105 Posted 21/07/2023 at 06:53:38\nAnd I don't think he has anything to apologize for.\nAll he owes us is his very best effort from Day 1.\n106 Posted 21/07/2023 at 07:04:15\nObviously we are not behind the scenes but it never seems like we have a plan.\nWith Billy Liar still pulling the strings, I don't believe our transfer strategy will amount to much anyway.\nWe need goalscorers first and foremost.\n107 Posted 21/07/2023 at 07:06:54\nYes, maybe, I suppose none of us knows what goes on behind closed doors as they say.\nI think he will be a good signing, it's up to him now to win the fans over.\n108 Posted 21/07/2023 at 07:10:33\nMaybe it's time Dyche got a bit more credit for his achievements in keeping Everton in the Premier League. If we hadn't comically sacked Lampard, then I think we would be preparing to play in the Championship right now.\nI heard people slagging this decision yesterday, and my initial thought's were that we are very desperate, but to be fair to the player, if he was coming to Everton because of the previous manager, who was then suddenly sacked, then I agree with everything else you said, Chris!!\nI saw that last night, Marc, and if there is any truth in this then they must be getting paid a right few quid to keep their fuckn mouths shut.ðŸ¤«\n109 Posted 21/07/2023 at 07:17:22\nThey must be, its disgraceful though.\n110 Posted 21/07/2023 at 07:18:32\nAgree - I thought that was a very odd comment from Chris #100â€¦\nI'm so glad â€˜we comically sacked Lampard' as we would be down by now.\nDyche saved us under ridiculously difficult circumstances and deserves credit.\nI often wonder how good a judge some of our fan base is.\n111 Posted 21/07/2023 at 08:22:43\n112 Posted 21/07/2023 at 08:44:08\nWe very nearly signed Danjuma back in January, with him saying he would do everything he can to help us stay up. No doubt a loan fee to Villarreal would still have had to been paid, as well as wages to the player.\nSo, he snubs us, due to lampard getting the boot and chooses “Big Club my Arseâ€ Spurs instead.\nSo, we save on the loan fee, players wages, and most importantly, stay up, whilst all the time, Danjuma is picking up splinters in his arse, watching and learning how games in the premier league are played, the speed, intensity etc etc etc.\nOk, we've still got to pay the loan fee and wages, but we've got him for twelve months, not six, and there won't be as much pressure on him to hit the ground running like it would have been back in January, plus he will also have the benefit of a few weeks pre season training. Win win!!\nWarped logic, I know! ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜\n113 Posted 21/07/2023 at 08:45:12\nHe was going to come to play for Lampard, who was then sacked. He then went to a better club. Most of us would have done the same in his situation.\nWelcome aboard.\n114 Posted 21/07/2023 at 09:02:28\n115 Posted 21/07/2023 at 09:05:30\n116 Posted 21/07/2023 at 09:08:55\nYes your completely right. Lets hope MSP will be on board and sort out the whole mess we are in\n117 Posted 21/07/2023 at 09:12:19\nA lot still to do but there is still time to improve the situation.\nThis time next year a lot of the deadwood will have departed, things will get better\n118 Posted 21/07/2023 at 09:28:34\nHe runs down too many blind corridors and doesn't get his head up. He's very much a highlights player but his unreliability is why Dyche doesn't fancy him.\nWe are potentially swapping a player that the manager doesn't like for one that he does, one who could also make an effective CF option (unlike Gray); and also making £10m or so profit as well.\nI think Danjuma will prove popular. And getting him in with minimal expense (£3.5m loan fee for someone who scored 6 champions league goals in his last proper season is pretty standard) means we can spend what money there is on a striker and maybe another forward option (Gnonto and Iheanacho?)\n119 Posted 21/07/2023 at 09:30:56\nThat is what it is, hush money. They were all willing scapegoats.\nActually it will make little difference that they are gone. Bill called all the shots, they just wrapped them up. There are still people at Everton doing the same thing.\n120 Posted 21/07/2023 at 10:14:59\nIf it is true that Elanga was identified as a priority signing, and if the Daily Mail's article is accurate, then clearly someone has not done due diligence on Elanga, and precious time has been wasted?\nI have a feeling that the Danjuma loan will turn out well, provided the player responds well to playing across the front line when needed.\n121 Posted 21/07/2023 at 10:34:44\nProbably right.\nThe thing that worries me is Danjuma looks massively one-footed the direction he starts out on he stays on.\nMy concern is he'll be worked out pretty quick by defenders and howls of derision will cascade from the stands resulting in another going through the motions player.\nBut that's the market we operate in to fulfil our present ambition of avoiding the drop. Grim stuff.\n122 Posted 21/07/2023 at 11:02:15\nCorrect but please don't overthink it. He can run and in this wooden team that's a bonus. The next George Best is not going to sign for Everton.\nI've realised I'll be nearly 60 when Everton can hopefully find their feet again. Decades lost, thanks to Kenwright. That twat had better not turn up at the new stadium opening. ðŸ˜ˆ\n123 Posted 21/07/2023 at 11:06:54\nAlso, pointing out his poor return for Spurs? Have a look at Richarlison's stats for Spurs. But we'd all have him back?!\nThis signing makes sense and is clever like the Young signing in that we've signed two players but now have cover in virtually every outfield position.\nA couple more in, ideally Iheanacho, and I'd be delighted.\nFactor in Branthwaite, Patterson, Onana and McNeil also a year more experienced and we're starting to resemble a football team.\nIt's just getting that striker in that we struggle with. Fingers crossed.\n124 Posted 21/07/2023 at 11:34:10\nApparently Man Utd upped their valuation of Elanga when more clubs became interested alongside us, so that's the hold-up with that one. He was basically signing for us on deadline day in January with Dyche in charge so I can't see him now moaning about playing under Dyche â€“ Daily Mail with another nothing article, most likely.\nSurely the club just use January's signing announcement videos for a laugh...\n125 Posted 21/07/2023 at 11:35:58\nI couldn't agree more.\n126 Posted 21/07/2023 at 11:52:20\nI'll throw in Rod Belfit and Joe Harper, beat that!\nRe Danjuma, let's see what he can do before we start the sledging, forget what did or didn't happen at Finch Farm.\n127 Posted 21/07/2023 at 12:30:13\n''He made the sane decision. Anyone who thinks otherwise is simply unreasonable.''\nHow ironic.\n128 Posted 21/07/2023 at 13:01:18\nI'd just like to thank the board, in particular Kenwright and Moshiri for putting us in this position for some time to come.\nI only hope they stick with Sean Dyche, and the manager merry-go-round stops, and Kenwright gets shown the door asap. ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž\n129 Posted 21/07/2023 at 15:09:57\n130 Posted 21/07/2023 at 15:24:47\n131 Posted 21/07/2023 at 16:23:59\n132 Posted 21/07/2023 at 18:04:11\nG/K : Tomas Vaclik Age 34 and current Czechia International 54 Caps so far. Was on loan at Hudderfield last season.\nDefender: Samuel Umtiti Age 29. CB and left footed. Freed by Barcelona and spent last season at FC Utrecht. A real upgrade on Holgate, Keane and Godfrey. He has also played at Left Back.\nMidfield: Ainsley Maitland-Niles. Age 26 in August. Freed by Arsenal. Played on loan at Southampton last season - 27 games. Career totals - RM 87, CM 50, DM 28, RB 48, LB 23, LM 22 and CB 2. From RM has scored 8 goals and 12 assists. An upgrade on Tom Davies. His versatility could prove a godsend, given the lack of depth in the squad.\nMidfield: JoÃ£o Moutinho, Age 36, Freed by Wolves. Played 36 games last season. During the second half of the season, mainly used as a sub, to steady things down in the second half of games. Even as a 45 minute sub he could do a job. Very rarely gives the ball away. A one year contract as per Ashley Young.\nForwards: The list provided by Transfer Market for Centre Forwards is short of players, who have a decent record over last season. For example Moussa Dembele played 28 games last season scoring 3, with 1 assist. He played 90 minutes 3 times. I assume that is why we are desperate to buy someone as getting a freebie is not really on. My money is still on Wieghorst coming in, especially as Dyche seems to rate him.\n133 Posted 21/07/2023 at 19:43:28\nThere is a hint of another signing possibly this weekend too\n134 Posted 21/07/2023 at 20:26:56\nOnce again I find myself agreeing with your posts.\nDemari gray at his best is an asset.\nAt worse a luxury liability.\nThe problem with him is inconsistentacy, wastefull possession, to little end product for his efforts.\nI'd say he's at a stage where we are at his peak valuation and we need to capitalise more on players at their peak valuation. Rather than letting their values slump and taking the wages and transfer hits.\nDyche didn't play him for a good portion when he took over.\nIf danjuma is to be his replacement this year and the profits are put towards more reinforcements I'd take that.\nIf this is really the route that Thelwell and dyche are taking, I personally like the ruthlessness of it.\nDeadwood being cleared, high earning non contributing players leaving, academy players pulling in fees & players at their peak valuation that are not irreplaceable moving on is a sign of progress.\nLike to see if Thelwell can get 1 or 2 Onana esk players through the door. Hopefully, a stiker & winger/wide forward.\n135 Posted 21/07/2023 at 20:52:39\nGray isn't going to sign a new deal, so him going with £15m added to the kitty is decent business for me.\nA striker signed, and I think Maupay will be next out through the door - along with Cannon on loan.\nBilal Toure supposedly chased by Atlanta, Boniface to Leverkusen, would leave Dia, Iheanacho, Brobbey and Dembele. Whoever we get needs to he able to handle being an Everton starter with Dcl still not fit.\nI think Gnoto will be a long chase, and may be we don't get him. I think he's Villa's back up option to Diaby.\nHolgate, Gbamin, and maybe Iwobi to be heading out?\nStill see Mina is free. I'd still have him a head of Michael Keane.\n136 Posted 21/07/2023 at 21:05:38\nWe'd have to pay mina twice as much on a free !!! £100 - 200k a week, for what 8- 10 games a season, and £15k a year on plasters and germoline for all his sores ???\nNah !!!\n137 Posted 21/07/2023 at 21:30:42\nJack #133, interesting list. Perhaps not realistic salary-wise, however. This time last year Moutinho signed a one-year deal with Wolves for £100,000/week, and I doubt he'd take less. And Umtiti, who just passed a medical for Lille, was being paid even more.\n138 Posted 21/07/2023 at 22:21:11\n139 Posted 21/07/2023 at 22:36:31\n140 Posted 21/07/2023 at 23:43:56\n'We looked shit and were destined for relegation, but we comically sacked Lampard, Chris G?'\nAh, I see how that looks...what I meant was, Danjuma had agreed to join and play for Lampard, and then we sacked Lampard 24hrs before Danjuma was due to sign. The timing was comical, not the decision to sack him.\n141 Posted 22/07/2023 at 11:44:50\nWhat do you mean?\n142 Posted 22/07/2023 at 12:51:19\n143 Posted 22/07/2023 at 13:52:44\nWhat I meant was, the likes of Elanga favours Forest rather than us, whereas in years gone by he would have jumped at the chance to join us.\nWhilst on the subject of signing players, it's reported Danjuma will have his medical â€˜soon', what does that mean?\nGet him signed before another club come along and highjack the deal again!!!\nI'm guessing, but I see a house of cards which will fall when a certain signing somewhere else hinges on sever transfers going through!\n144 Posted 22/07/2023 at 20:50:13\n145 Posted 22/07/2023 at 21:35:04\nDanjuma, not you.\n146 Posted 23/07/2023 at 09:39:30\n147 Posted 23/07/2023 at 10:19:22\n148 Posted 23/07/2023 at 10:58:04\n149 Posted 23/07/2023 at 11:15:54\nIf it's in the bag don't be surprised to see us agree a fee for a striker in the coming days. El Bilal TourÃ© please.\n150 Posted 23/07/2023 at 11:44:50\nNothing unusual about that you may think, but the first words out of Eddie Howe's mouth is that the transfer should satisfy the Premier League, who may have concerns about the fee being over-inflated.\nAs we all know, the Skunks are owned by Saudi's Public Investment Fund, who also run the Saudi Pro League. So what's to stop Al-Ahli paying an over-inflated price for Saint-Maximin? After all, they would in effect, be giving the money back to their own country.\nSo, in today's market, what would he be worth? I reckon anything between £20M to £25M. Eddie Howe must have concerns if the fee is going to be way north of that amount to even mention the fee should satisfy the Premier League. Plus it also helps the Skunks massively with FFP.\n151 Posted 23/07/2023 at 12:04:52\nBut he hasn't favoured Forest over us, from Alan Myers he was one of many Everton were interested in but that was it. We never offered a loan, buy or anything.\n152 Posted 23/07/2023 at 12:14:50\n153 Posted 23/07/2023 at 12:30:07\nWhat's the hold up now if medical was yesterday??\n154 Posted 23/07/2023 at 12:39:51\n\"Oh it's 5 o'clock, it's Friday, sorry son, come back on Monday when the office reopens, have a nice weekend.\"\n155 Posted 23/07/2023 at 13:02:09\n156 Posted 23/07/2023 at 13:09:55\n157 Posted 23/07/2023 at 13:28:55\n158 Posted 23/07/2023 at 13:30:12\nLeave us poor supporters sweating - but we don't matter.\n159 Posted 23/07/2023 at 15:28:16\nThe spirit of Evertonians cannot be dampened and this signing provides Sean Dyche with attacking options across the front line.\nUTFTs!\n160 Posted 24/07/2023 at 06:58:43\nThanks for the update.\nI promised myself not to put too much credit on media hype and fake news, but failed ðŸ˜‚\nI'll wait until they come through the front door ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘\n161 Posted 24/07/2023 at 10:41:59\nDon'y worry mate I fall for it sometimes on Twitter, think we all do. There are a couple of good sources that I only listen to now thats Alan Myers and Fabrizio.\nBut as you say unless we see them wearing the shirt best not to get to excited!\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
