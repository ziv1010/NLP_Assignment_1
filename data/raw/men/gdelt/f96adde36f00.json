The AFC announced last week that the prize money for the men’s Champions League will triple to $12 million in 2024/25.\nIn a separate decision, it was agreed to shift the AFC Women’s Asian Cup to non-FIFA World Cup odd years.\nIt means after the next Women’s Asian Cup in 2026 the subsequent edition will be in 2029 instead of 2030.\nAFP",
