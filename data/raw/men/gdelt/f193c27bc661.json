Since then, the No.6 has gone on to win the FA Cup and League Cup with the Reds.\nBut Thiago has struggled for fitness during his three years in English football, playing in just 24 and 25 matches in his first two seasons respectively. Jurgen Klopp has chased Jude Bellingham as a serious upgrade in his midfield options, with two plyers in that position likely this summer.\nIn the midst of this midfield regeneration, The Mirror claims that Thiago will be allowed to leave at the end of his current deal.\nThe Italian-born maestro has another year on his contract but recently turned 32. It is likely that the Reds would entertain any kind of offer – but may be willing to part with him on a free transfer if finances become an issue.\nThe Merseysiders have had to put the Bellingham pursuit on the back burner given that they don't have the money to spend on a £100 million player if they don't qualify for the Champions League this season.\nEqually, if Thiago were to find a move to get his wages off the books ahead of a rebuild, it's likely that Klopp would let the player leave without a fee.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nLiverpool are also expected to move for full-backs and centre-backs along with two midfielders this summer.\nThiago is valued at €18m by Transfermarkt.\nMore Liverpool stories\nLiverpool's failed pursuit of Jude Bellingham has led to discussion over who is to blame, with This Is Anfield writing that the fault lies with both Jurgen Klopp and ownership FSG for FourFourTwo.\nThe Reds are looking at a number of possible alternatives, including Ryan Gravenberch of Bayern Munich, Inter Milan star Nicolo Barella, Brighton midfielder Moises Caidedo and Chelsea fringe midfielder Conor Gallagher. Ex-Red Jose Enrique has questioned whether the Merseysiders even needed Bellingham, anyway.\nMeanwhile, there could be significant outgoings from Anfield this summer. Mohamed Salah has apparently enquired about a move to Spain, Jurgen Klopp is a target for Real Madrid if Carlo Ancelotti departs and Roberto Firmino has reportedly agreed a deal with Los Blancos when his Liverpool contract expires.\nMark White is the Digital Content Editor at FourFourTwo.
