Rivers United captain Temple Emekayi has urged his teammates to bounce back from recent disappointments.\n“I know it will take a little bit to get going again, but I think what we are playing for in the league is enough motivation for all of us,” he told PUNCH Sports Extra.\nRivers United are seeking to recover from consecutive defeats—a 1-0 loss to Bayelsa United in the league and a shock 2-1 exit to Beyond Limits FA in the President Federation Cup.\n“Every game now is so important, it has been for a while. It has been so tight and so competitive,” Emekayi added. “We want to win something, and that’s been the big goal. But I think we can’t look too far ahead; we have to take it day by day, and game by game.”\nA win for Rivers would cut Remo Stars’ lead to five points, breathing new life into the title race. Defeat, however, would all but confirm the Ikenne-based side as champions.\nENGLAND\nFulham vs Liverpool (Iwobi, Bassey)\nAlex Iwobi will have more than Fulham pride at stake when Liverpool visit Craven Cottage on Sunday. The Nigerian midfielder, alongside fellow Super Eagles star Calvin Bassey, will be key to Fulham’s plans against the champions-elect.\nThe former Arsenal player could do his academy club a favour in the title race with the Gunners 12 points behind the Reds.\nLiverpool top the Premier League table with 73 points from 30 games, and victory would keep Arne Slot’s men on course for their first league title since 2020.\nIwobi has been Fulham’s most influential midfielder this season, contributing seven goals and three assists in 30 league appearances. He was rested for the first hour of Fulham’s narrow loss to Arsenal during the week but still made a notable impact after coming on.\nHis importance is reflected not just in goals but in buildup play, leading all players in Europe’s top five leagues in progressive carries into the final third (86). With Fulham scoring 28% of their league goals through Iwobi’s direct involvement, he remains Marco Silva’s most reliable attacking outlet.\nCalvin Bassey, meanwhile, was an unused substitute against Arsenal, likely rested for this crucial fixture. The 25-year-old centre-back has made 29 appearances across all competitions and scored twice this season.\nTottenham vs Southampton (Aribo, Onuachu)\nJoe Aribo and Paul Onuachu could feature in a match that might confirm Southampton’s Premier League relegation at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nOnuachu has scored four goals and provided one assist in 20 appearances and is in line for a bench role.\nAribo, with three goals in 29 matches, is expected to be promoted to the starting lineup as the Saints fight to avoid becoming the first team in Premier League history to be relegated as early as matchday 31.\nSouthampton currently sit bottom of the table with just 10 points, and will be relegated if they lose to Tottenham and Wolves beat Ipswich Town on Saturday.\nFor Spurs, the match represents a chance to rebuild momentum after a disappointing 1-0 defeat to Chelsea, with Ange Postecoglou expected to rotate his squad ahead of Thursday’s Europa League quarter-final against Eintracht Frankfurt.\nSPAIN\nSevilla vs Atletico Madrid (Ejuke, Adams)\nNigerian forwards Chidera Ejuke and Akor Adams will hope to make an impact when Sevilla host Atletico Madrid at the Estadio Ramon.\nBoth players featured in Sevilla’s 2-1 defeat to Real Betis last weekend, with Adams making only his second appearance for the club since returning from injury. The striker is still searching for his first goal for Sevilla.\nEjuke has contributed two goals and one assist in 19 appearances this season and remains an important attacking option for Garcia Pimienta’s side, who sit 11th in La Liga.\nAtletico Madrid, meanwhile, are looking to end a winless run that extends back to early March. Diego Simeone’s side have seen their title hopes fade in recent weeks, currently sitting third in the table, nine points off leaders Barcelona.\nSevilla will be looking to avoid a third straight defeat after losses to Athletic Bilbao and Real Betis, while Atletico need a victory to maintain their grip on a Champions League qualification spot.\nITALY\nAtalanta vs Lazio (Lookman vs Dele-Bashiru)\nTwo Nigeria internationals will face off in Bergamo on Sunday evening as Ademola Lookman’s Atalanta host Fisayo Dele-Bashiru’s Lazio in a crucial Serie A clash.\nBoth teams are faltering in their quest for Champions League football, with neither having won in their last two matches. Atalanta have lost their last two games without scoring, while Lazio have managed just one win from their last six Serie A fixtures.\nWhen these sides last met in December, both Nigerians made significant contributions, with Dele-Bashiru scoring a brilliant goal and Lookman providing the assist for Atalanta’s equaliser in a 1-1 draw.\nLazio manager Marco Baroni recently urged Dele-Bashiru to improve his performance in the final third.\nLookman, meanwhile, will be looking to break his recent goal drought. Despite being one of Serie A’s most dangerous attackers earlier in the season, the Nigerian forward has struggled for form in 2025.\nPORTUGAL\nPorto vs Benfica (Zaidu Sanusi)\nSuper Eagles defender Zaidu Sanusi could feature in Portugal’s biggest derby when Porto welcome title-chasing Benfica to the Estadio do Dragao on Sunday.\nThe left-back has struggled for game time this season, making just three league appearances as he continues his recovery from a long-term anterior cruciate ligament injury.\nPorto sit third in the Primeira Liga, nine points behind second-placed Benfica, who are locked in a title race with Sporting Lisbon. Victory for the Dragons would not only tighten their grip on a Champions League qualification spot but also revive their fading title hopes.\nThe last meeting between these Portuguese giants ended in a humbling 4-1 defeat for Porto, but they will take heart from their most recent clash at the Estadio do Dragao, where they produced an emphatic 5-0 victory.\nTURKEY\nFenerbahce vs Trabzonspor (Bright Osayi-Samuel)\nBright Osayi-Samuel could get a start as Fenerbahce hosts Trabzonspor in one of Turkish football’s most intense rivalries.\nThe Nigerian defender, whose contract expires at the end of the season, has been linked with a return to England, with Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest reportedly interested in his services.\nJose Mourinho’s side currently sit six points behind league leaders Galatasaray with a game in hand and will be desperate for victory to keep their title hopes alive.\nOsayi-Samuel has been a key figure for Fenerbahce this season, following a turbulent end to the previous campaign when he was controversially involved in a post-match incident during their second clash against Trabzonspor in March 2024.\nTension started flaring in the 87th minute when objects were thrown onto the field after Michy Batshuayi scored what proved to be the winner for Fenerbahce. A melee ensued after the game that had the defender engage a pitch invader in a boxing contest. The Turkish FA eventually cleared him of any wrongdoing.\nTrabzonspor will be looking to build on their recent good form under new manager Fatih Tekke, who has overseen a victory and a draw in his first two league matches in charge.",
