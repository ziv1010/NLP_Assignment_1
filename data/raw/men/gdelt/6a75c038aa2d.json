And, like Rashford, he can play through the middle too.\nWest Ham will be unable to prevent his departure in the summer as his £85million release clause becomes active at the end of the season.\nMorgan Gibbs-White\nGibbs-White has gone from strength to strength since becoming Nottingham Forest’s record signing in the summer of 2022. Recently, he earned his full international debut for England.\nThe 24-year-old scored a winner against United last season and also registered a goal and an assist in Forest’s recent 3-2 win at Old Trafford.\nLargely playing as a central attacking midfielder for high-flying Forest this season, the creative right-footed player can also operate in a slightly wider role.\nIn fact, he could be an especially suitable fit for Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system as one of the two attacking midfielders, potentially alongside club captain Bruno Fernandes.\nBig-name stars\nRafael Leao\nLeao has spent the last five-and-a-half years at AC Milan and played an integral role in their Scudetto-winning campaign in 2021/22.\nBut he could be in line for a transfer away from San Siro in the January transfer window as his relationship with manager Paulo Fonseca has been strained.\nUnited have been credited with an interest in the Portugal international and a move to Old Trafford would see him link up with compatriots Amorim, Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot.\nMilan will reportedly listen to offers in the region of €80-90million (up to £74.9m / $93.6m), although Leao may decide to join a club playing in the Champions League.\nRodrygo\nRodrygo has enjoyed a trophy-laden career at Real Madrid, winning three La Liga titles, two Champions Leagues, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups, a FIFA Intercontinental Cup and a Copa del Rey.\nThe Brazil international has played a key role in that success, but he has expressed his frustration about not playing in his natural position on the left wing.\n“Often, I’m just filling in the gaps,” he said. “Is someone missing on the right? Rodrygo. Is someone missing as a number 9? Rodrygo. That bothers me a bit, but I’m a team player.”\nVinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappe have played on the left wing this season and reports in Spain claim that Madrid will consider selling Rodrygo if a suitable offer is made in the January window.\nBut United would have to break their own transfer record to sign the 23-year-old, who is valued at around €120million (£100m/$130m).\nKhvicha Kvaratskhelia\nSince joining Napoli from Dinamo Batumi in the summer of 2022, Kvaratskhelia has established himself as one of the best wingers in Europe.\nHe won the Serie A title and the Serie A Player of the Season award in his debut campaign and has made a strong start to the 2024/25 campaign.\nThe Georgia international is renowned for his incredible dribbling skills and his defensive work rate, making him an ideal fit for Amorim’s side.\nAccording to reports in Italy, he has agreed to sign a contract extension with Napoli but the new deal will include a release clause.\nAmorim reunion\nPedro Goncalves\nAmorim joined United from Sporting CP and TEAMtalk understands that he wants to raid his former club for Goncalves.\nThe Portugal international registered 81 goals and 61 assists in 190 appearances under Amorim, helping Sporting CP win two Primeira Liga titles and two Taca da Liga trophies.\n“He can play in any team in the world and with any player, because he is a great player,” Amorim said before taking over at United.\n“I could take him anywhere. He is very funny, which improves the personal relationship. He is also very intelligent, but he also has to focus on Sporting because we have to be champions this year. But he could play in any team in the world.”\nHe has an €80million (£66.3m/$84.6m) release clause in his contract and could now reunite with his former head coach at Old Trafford.\nDIVE DEEPER: Seven clubs Marcus Rashford could leave Man Utd for, including Premier League rival and European giants",
