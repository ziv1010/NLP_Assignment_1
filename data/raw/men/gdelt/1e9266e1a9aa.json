The match is scheduled to kick off at 8:00 PM.\nSpeaking ahead of the encounter, Simba Head Coach Fadlu Davids said the aim is to secure an away victory, noting the importance of winning both home and away fixtures to reach the next round.\nHe added that Simba’s recent matches, including Simba Day and the Community Shield, have provided adequate preparation for continental competition. While expressing respect for their opponents whom he described as champions in their own right, Fadlu made clear that his side is ready to compete.\nThe second leg of the fixture will be played on September 28th at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam.\nHowever, the match will be held behind closed doors, following a ban issued by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). Simba, who reached the final of last season’s CAF Confederation Cup, are aiming to return to the group stage of the Champions League.\nMlandege FC, also competing in the Champions League, will take on Ethiopian Insurance today at the Abebe Bikila Stadium in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The match is scheduled for 3:00 PM.\nIn the CAF Confederation Cup, Azam FC will face El Merriekh Bentiu of South Sudan at the Juba International Stadium. Kick-off is set for 5:00 PM.\nAzam Head Coach Florent Ibenge said the team travelled to South Sudan early to acclimatise to the local weather conditions, which differ significantly from those at home.\nHe stated that the players have trained and are fully prepared for the match, adding that the main objective is to perform well in the first leg and maintain a strong position going into the return fixture in Dar es Salaam on September 28th.\nThe winner of this tie will face either KMKM of Zanzibar or AS Port of Djibouti in the next round. Azam will be aiming to avoid a repeat of last season’s disappointment when they were eliminated by APR of Rwanda.\nSingida Black Stars are in Kigali, Rwanda, where they will face Rayon Sports in a CAF Confederation Cup fixture at the Kigali Pelé Stadium at 7:00 PM.\nThis marks Singida’s debut in international competition following their victory in the CECAFA Kagame Cup, held recently in Dar es Salaam. The team enter the tournament with momentum and aim to advance past the first round.\nMeanwhile, the Tanzanian government has expressed support for the country’s representatives in continental football. Government Spokesperson and Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Gerson Msigwa, conveyed good wishes to all four clubs on behalf of President Samia Suluhu Hassan.\nHe reiterated the continuation of the “Goli la Mama” incentive programme, through which the government will award 5m/- for each winning goal scored in the early rounds. He added the prize increases to 10m/- at the quarter-final stage, with further increases expected in the semi-finals.",
