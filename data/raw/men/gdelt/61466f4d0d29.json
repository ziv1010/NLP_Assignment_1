The United manager suggested the winger was excluded from the matchday squad for their 3-1 loss to Arsenal due to poor training levels, but Sancho refuted this on social media - he has refused to apologise for Ten Hag for this misdemeanour and been dropped from the senior squad.\n90min understands three new teams have registered an interest over a potential move for Sancho, with Leverkusen, Leipzig and Stuttgart exploring a deal.\nEarlier this month, 90min reported Leipzig are set to lose Fabio Carvalho in January as Liverpool are looking to cut his loan deal short - the 21-year-old has played just 360 minutes of football so far this season.\nAs such, Leipzig are in the market for another forward option and they have spoken with intermediaries regarding Sancho. However, his considerable wages would make any deal difficult - if Sancho leaves on loan, United want a good portion of his salary covered and they would prefer to include an obligatory purchase clause.\nBundesliga high-flyers Leverkusen and Stuttgart have both made enquiries - the former sit top of the table and are four points clear of champions Bayern Munich, while the latter are in fourth place and in serious contention for a Champions League spot.\nBut Sancho's most likely destination should he leave United remains former club Borussia Dortmund. Sancho loved his four years with BVB and the option of him returning on a longer-term 18-month loan remains a possibility. Contrary to reports though, United and Dortmund have not held talks about a swap deal involving Donyell Malen contrary to reports.\nSancho is yet to finalise his future plans but has made it clear to United that if he leaves, it will be on his own terms - he notably knocked back an approach from the Saudi Pro League towards the end of their summer transfer window.",
