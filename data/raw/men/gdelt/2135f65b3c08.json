Their rich vein of form has taken them up to second in the table and only two points behind leaders Liverpool.\nThe phenomenal three year spending spree by owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali was eye watering and during that period 39 players moved to Stamford Bridge. Many critics said the strategy was crazy.\nWhat has happened at the club is simple. Coach Enzo MarescaEnzo Maresca arrived to take over an outfit in trouble! He has stopped the dressing room tensions of overpaid superstars who considered themselves more important than the team, brought players closer together and although he tends to keep his distance, they know they have a man in charge who cares about them and his door is always open for them.\nMost important is the changed direction of the team. Under Mauricio Pochettino, who is a very good manager but one who never really brought the team together with a clear plan. He used a more scattergun approach with players moving in and out of the first team and they lost that sparkle and focus. Under Maresca there is clear vision, the players know exactly what they have to do on the pitch because his training sessions at the Cobham complex is clear and each one of them has bought into his ambitions for the club and where it should be heading.\nMaresca is a coach who enjoys working with youngsters, he improves them, moulds them and gives them confidence. The average age within the team is only 23.4 years which means that because most signed long term contracts this team will get stronger and stronger as the youngsters gain more experience. He worked with Cole Palmer at Manchester City as a youth coach and recognised his potential and since moving to Chelsea Cole has become a much stronger and a more skilful player and he is now an England regular.\nImproving the senior players is a Maresca quality and you only have to look at Spanish international Marc Cucurella who has become a stand-out full back making marauding runs up the wing and into the middle and even attacking the goal. In midfield Moises Caicedo has become a lynchpin and is playing his best football. Breaking down a huge squad has been another Maresca triumph.\nAmorim’s feelings about Rashford\nOnce undroppable Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho have been told by newly installed Manchester United coach Ruben Amorim that they will have to fight for their places and are no longer automatic choices to start. Under the new regime United have sent 250 loyal staff home without jobs and any stars who do not give 100% in training, which Rashford and Garnacho are accused of, will not play. Rashford has even been the subject of comment from the coach about his personal life and dress style. The club believes he is being distracted by too many issues off the field. When pressed Amorim insisted his actions in leaving Rashford out of the team were not disciplinary but then he said, “You can dress in a way I don’t like, that I really don’t like but it’s not a disciplinary thing…I want to improve my players and you understand that for so long, we tried for example with Rash and it does not work. Let’s continue to do the same or try something different? So it’s as simple as that, if they train well with the talent they have we will be so much better off with them. But they have to work and if they do today and they train hard then next week, new life, let’s see.”\nAmorim tells Maguire to stay\nLoyal United centre back Harry Maguire was expected to exit Old Trafford next summer after a couple of difficult years. However, with Ruben Amorim in charge there looks to be a change of focus. The club have offered Harry a new contract despite him being able to talk to other clubs in January. His current deal ends in June. He endured a strained relationship with Eric Ten Hag and his form suffered. A move to West Ham failed because he could not agree on the leaving fee with United. Amorim has assured Harry that he has a part to play in his plans and he was excellent in last weekend’s 2-1 derby win over City. Negotiations are continuing.\nIs this the end for Guardiola at City?\nWhoever thought they would hear these words coming out of Pep Guardiola’s mouth: “I am not good enough!” And who would have thought that bookmakers would make Pep second favourite to get the sack!\nAcknowledged as the arguably the best coach in the world with his life dedicated to football – on his day off on Sundays he sits on the sofa at home and plays videos of Saturday’s games over and again looking for clues, weaknesses, strengths in opposing teams while others involved in weekend matches relax with their wives, girlfriends and children, go out for breakfast or lunch and enjoy family outings. Not Pep…he never stops working.\nSo, what has gone wrong at City? Eight losses in 11 games – a run of defeats never experienced in his career before. Losing late in games has caused City problems such as giving up a three goal lead to Dutch club Feyenoord in the Champions League.\nSuperb Lookman is African Player of the Year\nI always thought Ademola Lookman was a player never truly appreciated and underrated at Everton, Fulham and Leicester and I am delighted to see his quality has been recognised after being voted African Player of the Year. The Atalanta player helped the Super Eagles Nigeria to second place in the Africa Cup of Nations in Cote d’Ivoire. He also played a big part in Atalanta FC’s UEFA Cup victory last year and scored a hat-trick in the final. This season he has played in 18 games across all competitions and scored an impressive 11 goals and made five assists. Atalanta are the surprise package in Serie A and head the table two points in front of Napoli and Lookman is playing a big part in that success.\nSarr is becoming Palace’s king player\nCrystal Palace are slowly clawing their way out of relegation trouble and one man in particular is growing in confidence and quality. Senegal’s Ismaila Sarr scored twice in their win against Brighton. Left wing-back Tyrick Mitchell provided the assist for Sarr’s first goal and he said, “He’s an amazing player and you can see it week in and week out. He’s got more confident with each game. You can see how he affects other teams’ back lines.”\nSarr inherited Michael Olise’s No9 shirt and has improved considerably under the coaching of Oliver Glasner who says his striker is “getting better and better.”\nUPDATE NEWS:\nNigerians can now invest ₦2.5 million on premium domains and profit about ₦17-₦25 million.
