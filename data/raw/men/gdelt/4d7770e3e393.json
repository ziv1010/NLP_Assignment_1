The protesters have also demanded reforms to social services—particularly health and education—and expressed anger over social inequality.\nMorocco is scheduled to host the AFCON from December 21 to January 18, with 24 national teams competing at nine venues across the country. Stars such as Mohamed Salah of Egypt and Liverpool, and Achraf Hakimi of Morocco and Paris Saint-Germain, are among the top players expected to feature.\nSpeaking during an annual gathering of African football executives in Kinshasa, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) President, Patrice Motsepe, said:\n“We are absolutely confident the AFCON will go ahead as planned. Morocco is plan A, Morocco is plan B, and Morocco is plan C.”\nHe added that CAF would cooperate with the Moroccan government and its citizens to host “the most successful AFCON in history.”\nMorocco last hosted the AFCON in 1988, when it was an eight-nation tournament, but withdrew from hosting the 2015 edition due to Ebola virus concerns.\nMotsepe also disclosed that CAF hopes to revive the African Football League, which was launched with much enthusiasm but discontinued in 2023 after just one radically altered edition. Instead of 24 participating clubs, Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa won a reduced eight-team tournament.\n“There are ongoing discussions, and we are very happy about the progress made,” he said. “The African Football League is very important, and it will continue.”\nWhen Motsepe took office in 2021, CAF was in financial distress, following the ban of former president Ahmed Ahmed by FIFA over breaches related to loyalty, abuse of position, and misappropriation of funds.\nSince then, Motsepe has turned around the confederation’s finances, announcing a net profit of $9.48 million for the 2023–2024 financial year, with projections of a $28.45 million surplus next year.\n“We have been enormously successful in the last five years. Revenues have quadrupled. Zero tolerance for bribery and corruption is important—every cent goes into football development,” Motsepe stated.\nHe further noted that CAF funding to member associations has doubled, with more support directed toward player welfare and national teams.\n“We give $100,000 to each club that does not qualify for the group stage of the CAF Champions League or Confederation Cup. It is not enough, but it helps with transport and other expenses,” he added.\n— AFP\n🔗 Follow Ghanaian Times WhatsApp Channel today. https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VbAjG7g3gvWajUAEX12Q\n🌍 Trusted News.
