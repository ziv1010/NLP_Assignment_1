More importantly, two points off Brighton.\nIt is now only one point from their last possible nine for the Seagulls.\nLeicester had lost 15 of their last 16 PL games and lost all of their last eight without scoring a single goal. Apart from their win at Spurs nine matches ago, the last previous point that Leicester had picked up was at home to…Brighton in a 2-2 draw on 8 December 2024.\nForest 0 Everton 1\nEverton might play very negative football and be so boring to watch, BUT this is potentially a massive result for both Forest and Newcastle.\nThat is now two defeats in a row for Forest and they have a potentially tricky run of games coming up, their next three Premier League games are Spurs away, Brentford at home and Palace away, They also have the distraction of an FA Cup semi final against Man City in amongst those league games.\nEverton hadn’t won in their last six PL match, five draws and one defeat.\nDoucoure though scoring four minutes into added time today to stun Forest, who had been mediocre at best.\nSouthampton 0 Villa 3\nAlready relegated Southampton managed 72 minutes without conceding, then once they did concede, they leaked two more. Villa winning 3-0 despite Marco Asensio failing with two penalties.\nThis is how the table looks on Saturday (12 April 2025) afternoon following the 12.30pm and 3pm Premier League results:\nAs you can see, these Premier League results so far, have opened up a very enticing prospect for Newcastle United.\nBy the close of business on Wednesday, Newcastle United are guaranteed to be third in the Premier League if they get four or more points from these home matches against Man U and Palace!\nMy thoughts on the remaining Premier League matches this weekend:\nArsenal v Brentford – Brentford have only lost once away from home in the Premier League since 15 December 2024, that one away defeat in four months was at…Newcastle. Arsenal have only won two of their last six PL matches and appear to have accepted no chance of catching Liverpool. With their focus now massively on the Champions League and finishing the job off against Real Madrid in midweek, I think Brentford can get at least a point today.\nSunday 13 April\nChelsea v Ipswich – The good news is that Ipswich outplayed and defeated Chelsea 2-0 on 30 December 2024. The not so positive news is that Ipswich have only won one other PL match since then. However, that latest win did come in their last away match and it was at Bournemouth. Ipswich also led for most of their last match until Wolves scored twice late on. Chelsea will be big favourites and should win, however, the blues have only won five of their last 15 PL matches and I wouldn’t be putting any money on them.\nLiverpool v West Ham – A late collapse for Liverpool starting with that defeat to Fulham last weekend? Wishful thinking probably. The Hammers though have improved to a certain extent, other than losing to Newcastle United, the other five of their last six PL games have seen only one other defeat for West Ham.\nWolves v Spurs – After losing three and drawing one of their last four games, Spurs finally won a PL match, though it was against rock bottom Southampton. Wolves have won their last three PL matches, although they were all against other clubs in the bottom five. However, Spurs are so weak and will be another club with eyes mainly on their next game in European competition, so I fancy Wolves to make it four PL wins in a row.\nNewcastle United v Man U – The only match that really counts. Newcastle looking to make it five wins in a row (all competitions), whilst Man U have only won two of their last eight PL matches, against soon to be relegated Leicester and Ipswich. Man U are also only looking at Europe to save their season, so a lot of confidence that United will make it five PL wins in a row.\nMonday 14 April\nBournemouth v Fulham – After going eleven PL matches unbeaten, a spectacular collapse for the Cherries. Their last eight PL games seeing five defeats, two draws and a win over Southampton. Fulham have won five of their last eight, including last weekend against Liverpool. Hopefully Bournemouth can revive themselves enough to at least get a draw and help prevent any Fulham hopes of mounting a late challenge for the Champions League places.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
