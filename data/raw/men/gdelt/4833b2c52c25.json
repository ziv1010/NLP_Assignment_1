Rashford came off the bench tonight, I think Sancho is looking as good as he has looked all season,” Scholes told Premier League Productions.\n“I’m a little bit sorry the season has got to end for him, he’s looking fit, he’s looking trim, he’s looking quick and he’s looking confident as well. So I think he could come into that final.”",
