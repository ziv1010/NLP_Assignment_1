  "body_text": "Man City and Real Madrid – two titans who want to burn football’s house down\nReal Madrid and Manchester City had an ally in common for a few years at least in the previous decade: the giant Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, which signed a €400 million (£333 million) deal to finance the first Bernabéu Stadium renovation before both parties fell out in spectacular fashion.\nIt was 11 years ago when the International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), part of Mubadala, agreed to finance the first attempt to rebuild the Bernabéu. Mubadala is chaired by Sheikh Mansour, the City owner, and its chief executive is another familiar face, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, the chairman of City Football Group. The fallout from the collapse of that deal went all the way to a Paris courtroom in 2023, when Mubadala prevailed. It successfully argued that, with works delayed and plans redrawn, Real had failed to fulfil the conditions of its original contract.\nThey meet one another in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 play-off tie on Tuesday, the guaranteed early elimination of one of Europe’s big guns exactly what Uefa did not want with its new format. That said, these feel like the biggest two games of the season so far – a delicious rerun of the great European Cup when the jeopardy of an early knockout was ever present. How different the clubs’ relationship might have been had Real renovated the Bernabéu with Abu Dhabi money and arrived at the Etihad this week with IPIC on their shirts and a massive commercial deal with one of the super-rich Middle East micro-states.\nMadrid resent new world order\nWhat the two clubs do have in common is a mutual antipathy with their respective domestic leagues – and they seem utterly committed to breaking down those regulators who seek to govern them. Real and City, placed in the top two spots by Deloitte for annual revenue, want to reorder the game – whether you like it or not.\nEventually Real financed the stadium renovation with more than €1 billion of debt and, in 2025, the general mood of the club is one of utter resentment about the way football has reordered itself. Real were the world’s wealthiest club in the early 2000s, when they broke the transfer market. Now at loggerheads with La Liga and Uefa, Real remain an outsider within the European game, refusing to give up the Super League project. In Spain, there is barely the time to list the grievances between Real president Florentino Pérez and his Liga counterpart Javier Tebas. A prospective Tebas legal action against Real this week was entirely in keeping with the mood.\nThat was proposed in response to Real’s allegations of corruption in Liga refereeing – just another skirmish in a long war. Tebas, for all his faults, has stood up publicly to Pérez and his Barcelona counterpart Joan Laporta on issues such as television revenue distribution and the private equity deal, in a way that the English authorities simply do not with their own big clubs.\nMeanwhile, to no one’s great surprise, this week City launched yet another legal challenge to the Premier League rules – this time the rule amendments that the clubs voted through in November to fix the issues flagged up by the commission that heard City’s previous challenge. This latest move comes while both sides await the same commission’s response to questions about that same November decision. Feeling confused? The one essential to hold on to is that City are never going to stop. Legal challenge after legal challenge, while the rest try to get on with the competition.\nOwnership model at stake for both clubs\nReal would doubtless look at City as part of their problem. Uefa’s failure to make City’s financial fair play sanctions stick in 2020 was painful for the oldest dynasty in European football, which likely looks with some surprise on City’s latest annual commercial revenue earning of €407 million. Perez, 77, president of Real for 22 of the past 25 years, once found a way to make them the most powerful force in the European transfer market but those days are gone. In the meantime, its Liga duopoly has made it a much less attractive proposition than the Premier League to broadcasters, and so everyone in Spain earns less.\nThe club has managed rising borrowings, including the sale of future income streams, while still leveraging its reputation to sign the world’s best free agents, and some of its best emerging talent. Although that is a hard trick to pull off in perpetuity.\nFor both clubs, what is at stake is the efficacy of their very ownership models. For City, that is the Abu Dhabi royal, who has transformed English football like no other owner – both on the pitch and in the willingness of his club to wage a massive legal campaign to change the very rules of the Premier League. For Real, it is the 123-year-old membership structure that precludes any private capital investment.\nThat model has its advantages – Pérez is a very wealthy man but all he has ever had to pay to be the figurehead of the world’s most famous club is the same annual fee every member does. Nevertheless, the future for Real ever more seems to be a part-privatisation. The problem is how that might work under Spanish law, in terms of capital gains and other complex questions, and whether the membership would willingly give up the value of their shares in the enterprise in full or in part.\nNo end in sight to power struggle\nIn the meantime, both clubs, giants of the current age, carry on largely outside the auspices of the competitions that have made them globally famous. Both are at odds with their domestic leagues. Both have fought Uefa. Yet this may not be the last time they play one another this season. The Fifa Club World Cup awaits in June and, providing both win their groups, they will go into separate halves of the knockout phase, potentially to meet in the final on July 13.\nFifa is the one global organisation that neither club seems publicly at odds with, either now or recently. Perhaps Gianni Infantino spies an opportunity. The Fifa president was the guest of Khaldoon and Ferran Soriano, the City Football Group chief executive, at City’s recent game against Chelsea. Ideally, those of us who value strong, equitable domestic competition would like to see a competitive City in a competitive Premier League minus all the legal trouble. Doubtless, Tebas and others in Spain would say the same for Real. Yet both clubs seem to savour the fight. They want domestic competitions run on their terms – and for the rest, the fallout just goes on and on.",
