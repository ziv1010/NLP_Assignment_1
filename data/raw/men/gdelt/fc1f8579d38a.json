Plenty of observers thought his first-half performance was the best he’s done for them so far.\n“This has surely been the best half of football that Viktor Gyokeres has played for Arsenal, and probably by some distance? Holding it up, switching play, finding through balls,” Telegraph journalist Sam Dean posted on X.\nSimilarly, Charles Watts wrote: “That’s Viktor Gyokeres’ best 45 minutes in an Arsenal shirt by a distance. Got his goal obviously, but his hold and link up play has been excellent. Everything has been sticking and his pass in the build-up to Rice’s goal was exquisite.”\nAtul Kasbekar concurred: “Gyokeres has had perhaps one of the best halves in his Arsenal career. Best hold up play I’ve seen from him as yet. More to come…”\nAnd famous Arsenal supporter Piers Morgan posted a picture of Gyokeres with the caption: “This guy is going to be an Arsenal legend…”\nAlas, Gyokeres was taken off at half time, so couldn’t build on his promising first half. Mikel Arteta has confirmed it was due to a muscular ‘niggle’, which he will be hoping isn’t too serious a setback.\nGyokeres’ track record questioned\nAnd there are still some sceptical non-Arsenal perspectives on Gyokeres’ ability, with the calibre of opponent being raised as an argument against him.\nNotorious X account Invert The Wing suggested: “They were spot on about Gyokeres being a flat track bully. 0 goals against anything other than the 2 newly promoted sides he’s played.”\nGyokeres previously scored a brace against Leeds United earlier in the season, but that claim about not scoring against sides who were already in the Premier League last season is incorrect considering his goal against Nottingham Forest in September.\nStill, it’s the next step Gyokeres will have to take to prove himself. Scoring against Atletico in the Champions League was a good start, but now he needs to be as impactful against higher-ranking Premier League opponents.\nAnd it’s a question he won’t get to answer soon either, since Arsenal play another recently-promoted team – albeit one performing above expectations at the moment – next weekend in the shape of Sunderland.\nIt won’t be until after the international break when they face someone expected to be competing for a similar standing in the Premier League: their north-London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on November 23.\nLatest Arsenal news: Explosive attacker eyed\nWhile Gyokeres should give Arsenal what they’ve been crying out for up front, they have also been tipped to battle Barcelona for an ‘explosive’ attacker for the long-term.\nDavid Ornstein has also explained why Kylian Mbappe would be Arsenal’s dream signing in a money-no-object situation.\nSources have also revealed that a Serie A winger is very keen on a transfer to the Premier League, where Arsenal are among the admirers.",
