If we can get ourselves into a position over the five days of the Test match to win, we'll push really hard for that.\"\nSouth Africa have been one of the most consistent teams across formats as they made it to the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup final last year while playing semi-finals of both ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 and Champions Trophy 2025.\nCommenting on their mindset and approach towards the WTC final, Aiden Markram shared that every player received clear instructions.\n\"I think it's the collective decision for each guy to bring their best skill. It's going to be a tough game.\n\"It's a Test match, of course, against Australia and a Dukes ball, Lord’s, all those sorts of things, but ultimately, the guys have a skillset that have got them here, got them selected, throughout the cycle performed as well, doing those skills.\n\"So it's about backing that, our best skill versus their (Australia’s) best skill, and we'll see where it lands us at the end of the day.\"",
