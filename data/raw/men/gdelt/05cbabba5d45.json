The Coupe de France final was a huge moment for me, but there’s still a lot of football left to play. My target is to keep improving, to score more goals, and to be a consistent performer for the team.”\nIbrahim’s journey reads like a football fairytale – from selling watermelons on the streets of Kano to starring in French football’s showpiece final. The towering striker’s path to prominence began at the modest Nigerian club Ojodu City FC, but it was his explosive performance at the 2024 Viareggio Cup in Italy that truly announced his arrival on the international stage.\nHis 10 goals in six matches, including back-to-back hat-tricks, not only led his team to the semi-finals but captured the attention of scouts across Europe. After trials with Chelsea, where he scored a hat-trick for their U19s, Ibrahim signed a four-year deal with Reims in August 2024.\nThe physical forward, standing at 1.90 metres, has drawn comparisons to Belgium’s Romelu Lukaku for his combination of strength, aerial ability and clinical finishing. After initially impressing with eight goals in six appearances for the reserves, Ibrahim was promoted to the senior squad and made his professional debut in December 2024.\nHis standout moment came in April’s semi-final against fourth-division side Cannes, where he opened the scoring with a tap-in after 14 minutes before assisting Teddy Teuma’s winner to secure Reims’ place in their first final since 1977.\nSaturday’s final represents the perfect stage for Ibrahim to showcase his talents against Luis Enrique’s star-studded PSG side, who are chasing an unprecedented treble consisting of Ligue 1, the Coupe de France and the Champions League. The Parisians have dominated this competition in recent years, reaching seven finals between 2015 and 2021 and winning six of them.\nFor Reims, the final offers a chance to end a trophy drought dating back to their 1961/62 Ligue 1 title triumph, with their last Coupe de France success coming in 1958. Manager Samba Diawara’s side have defied the odds to reach this stage, with their cup run coinciding with a dreadful league campaign that has left them fighting relegation.\nThe timing could hardly be more challenging for Reims, who played the first leg of their relegation playoff against Metz on Wednesday, drawing 1-1 in a result that adds unwanted pressure ahead of the final.\nHowever, Ibrahim and his teammates will be determined to create history and deliver the club’s first silverware in over six decades.\nIbrahim’s rise mirrors that of compatriot Chiamaka Nnadozie, who recently inspired Paris FC to Coupe de France Féminine glory against Paris Saint-Germain. The Super Falcons goalkeeper was the hero in that historic final, saving two penalties in a dramatic 5-4 shootout victory to hand her club their first major trophy in nearly two decades.",
