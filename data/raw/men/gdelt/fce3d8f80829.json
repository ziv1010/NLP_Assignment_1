The teams will play in the first season of the newly revamped competition, which has seen the group stage transformed into a single 36-team league stage.\nEach Europa League side will face eight different teams this season, with the top eight advancing straight to the round of 16. Those placed from ninth to 24th will play in knockout round play-off matches, with the winners also going through to the last 16.\nAfter this, the remaining teams will play straight knockout games through to the final.

Last season, United were knocked out in the group stage of the Champions League as they finished bottom beneath Bayern Munich, FC Copenhagen and Galatasaray.\nBut the squad has welcomed a raft of new faces since then, with Joshua Zirkzee and Matthijs de Ligt joining over the summer alongside Dutch Man United legend Ruud van Nistelrooy, who now serves as assistant manager.
