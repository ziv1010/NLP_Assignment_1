For half an hour, this was a markedly improved performance from Liverpool compared to the one in which they were resoundingly beaten at the Etihad in the reverse fixture in November. That 3-0 defeat saw just one shot on target for the Reds, who went on to lose the next two games by three goals, too (Nottingham Forest and PSV).\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nThe head coach rightly pointed out that his side raised the intensity after the interval, but the problem for Slot is that you can’t win football matches by playing well for just 30 minutes.\nYou also can’t rely on “individual special moments” as the Dutchman had phrased earlier in the season. Szoboszlai certainly provided such a moment, but then Slot’s side dropped so deep and City’s equaliser seemed inevitable.\nTo be 1-0 up, backed by a strong Anfield crowd, with 83 minutes on the clock, and still lose, it’s not something Liverpool fans have been used to in the past decade.\nAnfield used to be a fortress. Here, City walked away with their first win at Anfield in front of fans since 2003.\nFor Liverpool, who were again out-run by their opponent, it was their fifth home defeat of the season. In their last six home games they’ve won three; against Barnsley, Qarabag and Newcastle.\nLosing, or not winning, at Anfield has been normalised and that in itself should ring alarm bells.\nOf course, this result can be explained when viewed individually and in context, given that it also comes with the absence of five first-team players. But then most defeats in football can be accepted when taken only in isolation. When you add results together and see a trend, it’s far more concerning - and Liverpool’s results are far more than a poor run of form, approaching a year since defeat in the Champions League to PSG and the Carabao Cup final that signalled a seeming turning point.\nA trip to Sunderland on Wednesday now looks more difficult without player of the season, Szoboszlai.\nLiverpool sources, one such unnamed one in an article in the Times over the weekend, continue to back Slot, while sporting director Richard Hughes has also publicly spoken recently in support of the head coach.\nIn the same interview, chief executive Billy Hogan said: “This has been a challenging last several months, but I think there’s an element of patience which is required – difficult in the world we live in.”\nHow long will that patience last if Liverpool continue to drop away from the Champions League qualification places?\nAs Jamie Carragher assessed post-match: “I think if Liverpool continue the way they are with a front four and games end-to-end, I don't see how they can make the Champions League positions, at all. But no matter what he [Slot] does, the make-up of this squad, the balance of the team and the squad is not right. It never looks stable, they never look in control.”\nControlled football was what Slot brought to Liverpool last season en route to winning the league, but now, without such control, there’s a lack of identity or strength to the side.\nWith Manchester United and Chelsea winning again after changes in their dugouts, Slot needs more than a change of fortune to ensure patience continues to the end of the season and into the summer.\nMatt Ladson is the co-founder and editor of This Is Anfield, the independent Liverpool news and comment website, and covers all areas of the Reds for FourFourTwo – including transfer analysis, interviews, title wins and European trophies.
