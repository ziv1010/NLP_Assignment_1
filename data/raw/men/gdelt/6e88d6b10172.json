They have to enjoy tomorrow’s game. Playing at this level, in a Champions League semi-final against Inter, is great. I don’t want to put pressure on my players; they have to enjoy themselves. I want them to be well connected, to complement each other well, and to play with a fantastic style.”\nThis is the same message Johan Cruyff gave to his teams as Barça coach back in the day, and it always worked wonders. Hopefully the players can listen to Hansi as well and try to treat this like any other game if they are able to. I know every Barça fan will be an emotional wreck and will be anxious leading to and throughout the game, but the players must find a way to block out the noise and just play a football match.",
