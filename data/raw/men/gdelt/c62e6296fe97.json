The Red Devils named Darren Fletcher as interim manager before turning their attention to a caretaker boss who can see them through to the end of the campaign, when Amorim’s permanent replacement will arrive.\nCarrick has overtaken Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the race for the caretaker role, with his return expected to be announced on Tuesday.\nKey Man Utd target revealed\nThere will be ‘finance at Carrick’s disposal’ as he looks to strengthen the United squad this month, The Guardian have revealed.\nCarrick is aligned with United chiefs over the need for a new central midfielder, and former Wolves star Ruben Neves is emerging as a top target.\nHe will cost £20million to sign from Al-Hilal, a fee United see as good value for money and are ready to match.\nNeves currently earns between £300-400,000 a week in Saudi Arabia, though he will need to take a significant pay cut before moving to Old Trafford.\nUnited see Neves as a stop-gap solution before they splash out on at least one expensive midfielder this summer.\nCarrick’s side are likely to face competition from Newcastle United for the Portugal star.\nMan Utd vs Man City for England star\nOur transfer correspondent Fraser Fletcher has revealed that Man City have made contact as they try to beat United to the signing of Nottingham Forest ace Elliot Anderson.\nSources have confirmed to us that Anderson is a key target for United to improve their midfield this summer, alongside Brighton & Hove Albion’s Carlos Baleba, though City are threatening such plans.\nHaving already initiated contact with Anderson’s entourage, City are preparing a strong push to land him.\nWe understand City director of football Hugo Viana has closely monitored the Englishman’s progress at Forest, while Pep Guardiola sees the player as a perfect fit in his midfield.\nCity stepping up their interest in Anderson has caused serious concern at Old Trafford. United chiefs are worried Anderson could pick City due to the allure of working with Guardiola, as well as their recent Champions League pedigree.\nAnderson is valued at between £80-100million, though that price might rise further if he shines for England at the World Cup.\nRomano shuts down manager rumour\nUnited have been linked with a stunning move to make Luis Enrique their next permanent boss, though Fabrizio Romano has cooled such speculation.\nThere have been rumours Enrique is unhappy at Paris Saint-Germain, potentially opening the door for United to swoop in after having axed Amorim.\nBut on his YouTube channel, Romano insisted that the ‘atmosphere is very good’ between Enrique and PSG, and they remain in talks over a new contract.\nThe journalist added that stories suggesting Enrique could walk away from the Parc des Princes are ‘completely fake’.",
