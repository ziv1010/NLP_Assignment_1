  "body_text": "It’s probably English football’s most storied grudge match: the two most successful clubs of the last century playing head-to-head in the northwest derby. And yet in recent years, Liverpool and Manchester United have been on vastly diverging paths.\nIn the last seven seasons, Liverpool have claimed the Champions League, won the title twice and only finished below third place on one occasion. United have been wretchedly inconsistent to say the least, bouncing between second and 15th. The head-to-head picture is similar, as United haven’t won at Anfield since 2016 – though their last two trips along the Manchester Ship Canal down to Merseyside haven’t quite been fruitless. December 2023 saw them fight to a crunchy 0-0 in which Liverpool’s 34 shots led to nothing (the most significant moment of the game was a 94th-minute Diogo Dalot red card for dissent), while in last season’s fixture they went ahead and then came from behind in a bracing 2-2 draw amidst a freezing January blizzard.\nThe truth is, relatively little has changed since then. Liverpool are still the best team in England, if not Europe (don't come for me, it's objective), while Ruben Amorim’s side languishes in 14th place after six games (in a year of managing United, Amorim has not yet won two successive matches of football). And yet if there’s one thing that this corner of the country can guarantee, such as its footballing heritage, it’s drama. Anything can happen in this massive game.\nWhat are Liverpool and Man United's October fixtures?\nThe match will take place at Anfield stadium in Liverpool on Sunday 19 October, with kick-off at 16:30.\nLiverpool’s other games in October include fixtures against:\n- Chelsea, at Stamford Bridge, on 4 October (Premier League)\n- Eintracht Frankfurt, at Deutsche Bank Park, on 22 October (Champions League)\n- Brentford, at the G-Tech Stadium, on 25 October (Premier League)\n- Crystal Palace, at Anfield, on 29 October (League Cup)\nManchester United’s other games in October include fixtures against:\n- Sunderland, at Old Trafford, on 4 October (Premier League)\n- Brighton & Hove Albion, at Old Trafford, on 25 October (Premier League)\nHow to buy tickets for Liverpool v Manchester United\nRegular tickets for Liverpool vs Manchester United are currently restricted to purchase through a ballot open to local club members and those with a Liverpool postcode, or via pre-registration to those members who attended between two and four home games in the 2024/25 season. Because of this, that means tickets are now generally unavailable to most members of the public by ‘normal’ means.\nHowever, you can still access tickets in Anfield’s hospitality section through SeatUnique, spanning several tiers of packages. SeatUnique offers hospitality tickets for sale that are otherwise not used by their regular holders, and because access to these tiers is incredibly rare to the general public, it actually might suit you better than typical ticket-buying routes.\nSeatUnique’s Liverpool-United tickets are available at two tiers: the Reds Bar package and the Anfield Beat Lounge package.\nThe Reds Bar package includes:\n- Seats in the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand Lower in Block KG (on Anfield’s southeast side)\n- Access to the Reds Bar three hours before kick-off and one hour after full-time\n- A half-time drink included, and tea and coffee throughout the day.\n- A selection of food is available for purchase\n- A complimentary matchday programme\n- A licensed bar and in-lounge betting facilities.\nThe Anfield Beat Lounge package includes:\n- Seats in the Main Stand Lower in Block L16 (on the northwest side of Anfield).\n- Access to the lounge three hours before kick-off and one hour after full-time, with direct access from the lounge to your seats\n- A complimentary half-time drink\n- Former Liverpool FC players in attendance\n- Pre-match entertainment\n- A complimentary matchday programme.\nFood and drink are available to purchase within the lounge. Both tickets include a one-night stay at a three-star hotel on the night of the match, with one room per two guests, though this must be requested via help@seatunique.com five days prior to the fixture.\nHow much are tickets for Liverpool v Manchester United?\nRegular tickets at Anfield for Premier League games typically start from £9 for an adult in the ground’s Main Stand Upper section, rising to £61 for an adult in the Main Stand, but these tickets are now restricted to members with two to four games’ attendance at Anfield last season, or local balloting Liverpudlians. Via SeatUnique, Reds Bar tickets are £799 per person, while Anfield Beat Lounge seats are £1,095 per person.\nHow can I watch Liverpool v Manchester United?\nIn the UK, the game will be shown live on Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Premier League, and Sky Sports Ultra HDR, and can be streamed on the Sky Sports app, or the NOW app. Sky Sports packages can be bought from £35 per month, including Sky TV and Netflix, but if you don’t have a Sky subscription, single-day passes can be bought for a one-off £14.99.",
