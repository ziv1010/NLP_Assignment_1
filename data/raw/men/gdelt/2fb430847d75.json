  "body_text": "After a summer of frenetic activity, Liverpool took the opposite approach to this season’s winter transfer window.\nDespite the struggles head coach Arne Slot and his team have endured in defending their Premier League title, they decided not to try to fix things through the market and have put faith in the current squad for the rest of the campaign.\nAdvertisement\nThat comes with risks as Liverpool face a battle to secure a Champions League spot next season with an injury-hit set of players that was already lacking depth in certain areas.\nThey did end the window with a bang as they confirmed the signing of French youth international Jeremy Jacquet for an initial £55million, which will see the defender join the club ahead of the 2026-27 campaign, but many fans will be concerned at the lack of immediate incomings.\nWas this window a success or a failure?\nLiverpool entered January expecting a quiet transfer window, and that’s exactly what it was. So, on a fundamental level, it can’t be considered a failure.\nHowever, when you look at the limited size of their squad, the failure to strengthen key areas leaves them in a precarious position.\nIt only needs one or two more medium- to long-term injuries on top of those that have happened already, and a player pool that is on the limit could be pushed over the edge.\nThey did make a late attempt to add a right-back in Lutsharel Geertruida, who is on loan at Sunderland, but the complicated nature of the deal meant they were unable to get it over the line.\nAt least their summer business has started positively, however, with the early addition of centre-back Jacquet from Rennes.\nHow much did they spend and how much did they bring in?\nWhile £3.5m was invested in youngsters, there were no incomings or outgoings to and from the first-team squad. The signing of 20-year-old Jacquet for a deal that may rise to £60m will be part of Liverpool’s summer spend.\nAndy Robertson’s proposed move to Tottenham Hotspur, in a deal that could have risen to around £5m, was called off after Liverpool decided they were not prepared to sanction his exit.\nThe long-serving 31-year-old, who is out of contract at the end of this season, saw his potential move shelved largely due to the club’s difficulties in recalling fellow left-back Kostas Tsimikas from his season-long loan at Roma to provide cover. Roma wanted a satisfactory replacement signed before letting Tsimikas return.\nHarvey Elliott’s situation at Aston Villa, where he is on a season-long loan, remained unchanged in the end.\nAdvertisement\nElliott started their most recent Europa League fixture last Thursday, but has rarely been in Unai Emery’s matchday squads. With no recall clause in last summer’s deal, the ball was in Villa’s court to negotiate a possible return to his parent club for the 22-year-old midfielder, but they were not prepared to incur that financial cost.\nWho have they signed?\nThe acquisition of Jacquet is a real coup, as he is viewed as one of the biggest prospects in that position, and there were several other centre-back additions to strengthen their academy ranks.\nMor Talla Ndiaye and Ifeanyi Ndukwe both caught the eye of scouts at November’s Under-17 World Cup. Ndiaye moved, in a £1m deal, from Senegalese club Amitie. The 18-year-old Senegal youth international has joined up with Rob Page’s under-21s squad.\nThe payment to Austria Vienna for Ndukwe could rise to £2.5m if all the various add-ons are triggered. Already 6ft 6in (198cm), the teenager played a key role in Austria’s journey to the final of that Under-17 World Cup, where they lost 1-0 to Portugal. He doesn’t turn 18 until next month, so he is expected to arrive on Merseyside for pre-season in July.\nLiverpool also added a third young centre-back from slightly closer to home: 19-year-old Noah Adekoya of fellow Premier League side Burnley.\nWere there any deals they wanted to do that didn’t get over the line?\nMarc Guehi was agonisingly close to becoming a Liverpool player in the summer and there was an expectation that the situation could be revisited in January.\nInstead, Manchester City ended up signing the 25-year-old England international from Crystal Palace, with Liverpool deciding not to pursue the deal as it did not make financial sense for them.\nThe club were adamant that any January signing would be made with a view towards the long-term, rather than opting for a short-term fix, but the injury to Jeremie Frimpong, which left Liverpool without a fit right-back, did alter that.\nAdvertisement\nOptions were explored, but arranging a move for Geertruida, who played under Slot at Feyenoord, with parent club RB Leipzig and Sunderland proved too complicated.\nAre there still any obvious gaps in the team?\nWhere do you want to start?\nAfter the Guehi deal fell through and summer signing Giovanni Leoni was lost long-term to an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury, Liverpool have been light at centre-back. Joe Gomez has been the only backup to starters Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate.\nAnother issue has been the lack of depth in wide areas after they decided not to directly replace Luis Diaz when he was sold to Bayern Munich in the summer. Outside of Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah, Slot has Federico Chiesa, who he is reluctant to use, and 17-year-old Rio Ngumoha, who he is managing carefully due to his age. Florian Wirtz has played on both flanks and Frimpong on the right, but those are not their preferred positions.\nThe struggles of both Gakpo and Salah for form have not helped, but the squad is also lacking certain characteristics, including pace and one-on-one duel winners.\nRight-back has been a persistent problem because of injuries to Conor Bradley and Frimpong. The former is not expected to play again this season after suffering knee bone and ligament damage at Arsenal in early January. Frimpong is out with a groin injury, which is more of a short-term issue.\nDo they have the squad to achieve their goals for the season?\nSlot is up against it, as he is working with a relatively small group of players.\nChampions League qualification for next season is crucial, and the hope is they can make a deep run in that competition this season, having finished third to qualify directly for the round of 16, where a tie against one of Atletico Madrid, Club Brugge, Galatasaray or Juventus awaits in March.\nAdvertisement\nThe decision not to bring any new faces in this window, though, means their current squad must stay fit.\nWill the head coach be happy?\nAt his press conference on January 7 ahead of the FA Cup tie against Barnsley, Slot was asked about whether he felt there was sufficient depth in the squad and if reinforcements were required.\n“First of all, I’m really happy with the squad we have,” Slot answered. “All the decisions that are made last summer and the summer before and all these things are completely aligned with me and Richard (Hughes, the club’s sporting director) and ownership. I think it has shown this season how talented this group is and, if everyone is available, how good a team we can be.”\nThe head coach has not altered that stance over the ensuing weeks. There has been no plea to the board for new recruits. He has continued to explain that the club have to be smart and think long-term as well as short.\nThe problem is that Liverpool have suffered injuries, and Slot has repeatedly spoken about having to keep using the same players because he doesn’t have the squad to rotate and give individuals a rest.\nSo while the approach may be aligned across the various levels of the club’s hierarchy, it is difficult to see how he can be happy about the situation. He has a lack of options and the pressure is mounting on him to turn Liverpool’s Premier League form around so they finish in the Champions League places.\nWhat will their priority be in the summer?\nCentral defence was an area that needed addressing and Liverpool have been proactive by securing the signature of Jacquet. That was important because there continues to be no progress on a new contract for Konate. He is set to become a free agent in the summer.\nFurther additions in that area may be required, with Van Dijk another year older (he turns 35 in July) and because of Gomez’s lengthy injury history.\nAdding wingers will also be high on the off-season to-do list. As we’ve mentioned, Liverpool are short of options at those positions already, and there remains uncertainty over Mohamed Salah’s future after the comments he made in December about the club “throwing him under the bus”. He will turn 34 this summer.\nAdvertisement\nWill they have money to spend in the next window?\nYes, although they have already dipped into it.\nWhile they spent £450m on signings last summer, Liverpool also recouped over £200m through player sales, and they remain in a strong PSR position. They also generated £702m in revenue, according to analysis from financial firm Deloitte.\nHow much they can spend may depend on the outcome of this current campaign.\nLiverpool face a fight to qualify for the Champions League, even with the Premier League likely to have five places again in the 2026-27 edition. They remain in this season’s competition, but winning it — another route to qualification — will be very difficult. And missing out on the hugely lucrative top table of European club football would have financial ramifications.\nTheir small squad means there are not many players who could be sold to add to the funds available either.\nWhat is their strongest XI now that the window is shut\nNeither Leoni nor Bradley can be considered, as they are out for the season. The hope is striker Alexander Isak will return at some point from his leg fracture in December, but the timescale on his recovery remains unclear, so…\nLiverpool XI: Alisson; Frimpong, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Szoboszlai, Wirtz; Ekitike.\nTheir full list of ins and outs\nIN:\nMor Talla Ndiaye (Amitie, £1m)\nIfeanyi Ndukwe (Austria Vienna, up to £2.5m)\nNoah Adekoya (Burnley, undisclosed fee)\nOUT:\nJames Norris (to Shelbourne, undisclosed)\nLuke Chambers (to Charlton, loan)\nLewis Koumas (to Hull, loan)\nCalum Scanlon (to Cardiff, loan)",
