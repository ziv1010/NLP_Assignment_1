  "body_text": "Dutch football expert Arthur Renard details the background of Manchester United's new goalkeeper, chronicling his development at Ajax on his way to Old Trafford.\nPlayer analysis - Andre Onana\nIn Onana, Man Utd have got themselves a goalkeeper who is used to competing for silverware.\nThe 27-year-old won several trophies with Ajax and Internazionale Milano and helped both clubs to reach European finals.\nWhile there have been many highlights for the Cameroonian, there have been moments of adversity, too. But they have made him even more determined to become the best.\nSee: Andre Onana: Man Utd's new 'holding midfield' goalkeeper\nThe newspaper headlines didn’t make for good reading when Onana made his official debut for the second team of Ajax – who play in the Dutch second division.\nHe was directly at fault for the opening goal of opponents Achilles ’29 – losing possession when distributing from the back – and several other tricky moments with the ball at his feet made those in attendance wonder why exactly Ajax had gone to great lengths to sign this 18-year-old goalkeeper from the Barcelona academy.\nAlthough Onana and Ajax would regroup later on in the match, winning 2-1 in the end, it’s fair to say his first appearance in an Ajax shirt was one to forget.\nWatch: Onana’s difficult debut for Ajax\nHennie Spijkerman, assistant coach of the first team at the time, recalls: “It didn’t look good. Perhaps he wanted to prove himself. He made many mistakes with his feet and he was restless as he was kind of stumbling through the penalty box. You were left wondering where he would end up.”\nWhatever they say about the importance of making a good first impression, Onana is proof that early viewpoints can change quickly. The goalkeeper stayed calm, as he would do in later challenging moments in his career as well.\n“He developed very well afterwards,” Spijkerman reflects. “In his early days he could be sometimes a bit wild, but you could notice he was a special goalkeeper, with extraordinary qualities. You could see he was a huge athlete who was very adept with the ball at his feet and had fantastic reflexes. His reaction ability was immense.”\nTaking his chance\nOnana quickly managed to convince many at the club. He still had to wait a year to make his first-team debut, as Jasper Cillessen was the undisputed starter, but as soon as the Dutch goalkeeper left for Barcelona in the summer of 2016, Onana got his chance and grabbed it with both hands.\nOnana impressed, soon earning his own song among Ajax fans, but he couldn’t rest on his laurels as Ajax had also brought in the experienced Tim Krul.\nOn loan from Newcastle United, Krul was recovering from injury and Onana was cementing his starting spot. Still, when the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations was looming, Onana opted to stay in Amsterdam to avoid the risk of losing his place.\nWhether that influenced Cameroon national team manager Hugo Broos or not, the goalkeeper wasn’t named in the final squad.\nRemarkably, Cameroon went all the way to win the tournament, with Onana’s cousin Fabrice Ondoa in goal and playing a crucial part in the country’s victory.\nWhy Onana chose Ajax\nOnana's and Ondoa’s early career path have striking similarities, as both were scouted for the Samuel Eto’o Academy in Douala, before Ondoa made the move to Barcelona in 2009 – followed by Onana a year later. The two grew very close, while they also spent much time with other young Cameroonian talents who were at La Masia academy at the time.\nIn 2014, Onana impressed during Youth League matches between Barcelona and Ajax. When approached by the Amsterdam side, he decided to accept their offer as he felt he might be given a chance in the first team at a young age.\n“That was the deciding factor,” Onana told Elf Voetbal. “Chelsea, Arsenal and several Spanish clubs also showed an interest, but I didn’t believe I would get to play there.”\nPerfecting his game\nHis feeling about Ajax would prove right. In the space of one-and-a-half years he established himself as the club’s No 1, reaching the UEFA Europa League final in his first season – which Ajax would lose to his future club Man Utd.\nTwo years later Onana won the domestic double and almost reached the UEFA Champions League final, this time being denied by Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-finals. But the goalkeeper had put himself on the global map with many impressive performances.\nSee: Onana can be top-scoring goalkeeper in Fantasy\n“He stood out with his reaction ability and also his athleticism, something which he managed to cultivate even more over the years,” reflects Spijkerman, who used to be a ‘keeper himself for clubs like PEC Zwolle and Go Ahead.\n“At first his movements were maybe partly to impress, but over time it got much more efficient. It just became solely about stopping balls and subsequently distributing them to team-mates, preferably with his feet. He developed very well on that side.”\nSpijkerman, who worked at Ajax until the end of 2017, concedes that Onana would sometimes play a bit too far from his goal during build-up play, but feels that he has now found a better balance.\nHe says: “We pointed this out to him, that he was too overconfident at times, taking too many risks, such as playing a ball behind his standing leg – even in his own five-metre area!”\nOnana's love for seeking the footballing solution might have been at the heart of a dispute with the Cameroon head coach Rigobert Song at the FIFA World Cup 2022, as Song supposedly found Onana’s build-up play too risky at times, which led to an argument and the goalkeeper’s eventual departure from the camp, followed by Onana’s decision to retire from international football altogether.\n'He knew what he wanted'\nOnana is not afraid to speak his mind, something which is also reflected in his involvement in the FIFPRO’s Global Player Council, a platform for active international players with leadership qualities to raise any matters they come across in the game. They are consulted on cross-border issues such as fixture schedules and recommended rest periods.\nSpijkerman recognises his straightforward character, saying: “He knew what he wanted, like he had a goal in mind with the focus from within.”\nOnana's mindset as a sportsman is interwoven with a positive personality, explains the Dutch coach. “He always had a smile on his face, got on well with everyone and was in for a joke,\" Spijkerman adds.\nHis balanced personality means Onana is not too distracted by critics, as was evident after his difficult start for Ajax's second team in 2015, but also six years later when he was banned for 12 months by UEFA after he was found to have taken the forbidden substance Furosemide.\nThe suspension was reduced to nine months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after he explained he had mistaken his wife’s diuretic pill for a small painkilling tablet.\nOn his return, Onana faced criticism from fans for some unconvincing displays and the fact that he would leave Ajax on a free transfer. But again he remained unfazed, opting to sign for Internazionale last July.\nRadiating confidence\nIn Milan he dislodged long-serving goalkeeper Samir Handanovic to win a starting place and reach yet another European final, against Manchester City.\nSpijkerman believes Onana has developed into a versatile goalkeeper and has what it takes to succeed at Old Trafford.\n“He radiates confidence and stability, something which creates trust among his team-mates, but also a discouraging feeling to opponents, like that it won’t be easy to get anything past him,\" says Spijkerman.\n\"He has that flair and appearance about him. During matches, I remember thinking at times, ‘Today we are not going to concede a goal. Andre will get everything.’”\nLinking up 🤝@AndreyOnana has arrived in the USA 😍🇺🇸#MUFC || #MUTOUR23 pic.twitter.com/vPM3BS0VVU\n— Manchester United (@ManUtd) July 21, 2023\nSpijkerman believes his personality will make his adjustment in England go smoothly and points out an important external factor which is favourable for Onana, too.\n“He is a signing of Erik ten Hag, with whom he has worked,\" says Spijkerman. \"When you feel that a manager has gone the extra mile to get you, then that gives you an advantage. It will give him even more confidence.”",
