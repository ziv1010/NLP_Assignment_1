  "body_text": "Stream the action…\nDisney+ is staking a claim in live sport with a major coup: the platform will stream the 2025/26 UEFA Women’s Champions League draw live across Europe on 19 September, marking a new phase in how fans consume women’s football.\nAt 11am BST, subscribers will be able to tune in as the fixtures for the League Phase are revealed, setting the stage for the continent’s premier club competition. Arsenal – last season’s champions – lead a line-up of seeded clubs that reads like a roll call of European giants: Lyon, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Wolfsburg, Barcelona, Chelsea, Benfica and Juventus. They will be joined by nine teams emerging from the third qualifying round, with the draw determining who faces who in the six-match League Phase.\nUnder the revamped format, all 18 clubs will play six games – three at home, three away – against different opponents. The top four will march straight into the quarter-finals with home advantage, while sides ranked 5th to 12th must negotiate a two-legged play-off for a place in the last eight.\nThe stakes are high, and so too is the symbolism of Disney’s involvement. From 7 October, the streaming giant will carry every one of the 75 matches live across Europe. The deal represents not just another rights acquisition, but a recognition of the momentum behind the women’s game, which has seen rising attendances, record TV audiences and growing commercial investment.\nFor Disney+, long known for its catalogue of films and franchises, the move into women’s football also hints at its evolving identity in a streaming market defined by competition. For UEFA, it represents an opportunity to place the Women’s Champions League in front of a broad, international audience – one that blends traditional football followers with new fans discovering the sport through on-demand platforms.\nIt’s also a significant milestone in visibility. Where once draws and matches were confined to sports broadcasters, the ability to watch on a mainstream entertainment service signals the Women’s Champions League’s arrival as not just a sporting event, but a cultural moment.",
