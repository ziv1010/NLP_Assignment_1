They even held current champions Manchester City to a 2-2 draw, conceding at the death via a John Stones equaliser back in September.\nThe Gunners are back in action against Bournemouth on Saturday and with competition for places higher than ever, the defender in question is likely to start against the Cherries.\nArsenal star Riccardo Calafiori should have been a prime target to Juventus, claim the Italian media\nArsenal defender Riccardo Calafiori joined the club for £42 million this summer and has been something of an instant hit at the Emirates Stadium.\nThe 22-year-old has even forced out regular Ben White from the team in recent weeks, further hinting at the positive impact he has had under Arteta so far this season.\n“Losing Calafiori was madness,\" Italian football journalist Valentina Ballarini told Italian media BianconeraNews recently. \"I don’t know how to define it in any other way. It was a madness in our football, the most evident in recent years.\n“There have been many, it’s true, caused by the economic power that we no longer have for some time, but that of Calafiori drives me crazy in a negative way.”\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nCalafiori spent time at Roma before moving to Switzerland back in 2022. He then moved back to his homeland, transferring to Bologna, before his summer move to Arsenal came.\n“How could Roma lightheartedly let go of a player like that?\" added Ballarini. \"How could they not see his infinite potential and not trust him despite his many physical problems? Why didn’t Juventus go all in on the defender instead of spending €50m for Douglas Luiz and €15m for [Juan] Cabal?”\nWhy Arsenal Want Riccardo Calafiori So Badly\nIn FourFourTwo's view, Ballarini does perhaps have a point, given how effortlessly the young Italian has seemingly adapted to the demands of the Premier League.\nArsenal transfers under Sporting Director Edu Gaspar have been well constructed it must be said, given Declan Rice, Ben White and Martin Odegaard have also fitted into Arteta's clear philosophy at the club.\nWho is Riccardo Calafiori?\nRiccardo Calafiori is an Italian defender who can play as a centre-back and as a left-back. He left Bologna to sign for Arsenal in the summer, costing somewhere in the region of £42m.\nA talented acquisition, Calafiori was a standout star for Bologna as they qualified for the UEFA Champions League last season, featuring heavily under Thiago Motta before he moved to Juventus to become their new manager.\nMatthew Holt writes freelance for FourFourTwo, amongst others, and boasts previous experience at GOAL and SPORTBible.
