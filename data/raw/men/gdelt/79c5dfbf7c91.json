  "body_text": "Munich, Jun 1 (UNI) Paris Saint-Germain became European champions for the first time in their history, delivering a record-breaking 5–0 thrashing of Inter Milan in the UEFA Champions League final at the Allianz Arena on Sunday IST.\nWith this emphatic win, PSG became the 24th club to lift the prestigious European Cup, setting the record for the biggest margin of victory ever in a final.\nAchraf Hakimi (12), Desire Doue (20’, 63’), Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (73’) and Senny Mayulu (87’) were on target for the French champions, who outclassed the Italian side in every department to seal a famous triumph.\nThe Parisian club struck early through Hakimi, who turned in Doue’s intelligent square pass after a precise through-ball from Vitinha. Just eight minutes later, Doue scored his first of the night, chesting down Ousmane Dembele’s cutback and firing in via a deflection off Federico Dimarco.\nInter, who had conceded just twice in the knockout stage en route to the final, appeared shell-shocked and could only muster a couple of wayward headers from Francesco Acerbi and Marcus Thuram before the interval.\nThe second half followed a similar script, as Paris continued to press with precision and poise. On 63 minutes, Doue completed his brace after a slick one-two with Dembele, drilling a low shot into the far corner.\nKvaratskhelia, who was a menace down the left, got his reward with a well-taken finish after another assist from Dembele in the 73rd minute.\nWith Inter already resigned to defeat, 19-year-old Senny Mayulu capped the night with a thunderous strike in the 87th minute, his goal not only sealing the rout but also setting a new record for the largest winning margin in a European Cup final.\nGianluigi Donnarumma made a crucial save late on to deny Thuram and preserve the clean sheet. At the other end, Paris were in full flow, orchestrated by a tactical masterclass from coach Luis Enrique, who became only the seventh manager to win the European Cup with two different clubs.\n“This club had never lifted the Champions League. It’s a historic moment,” said Enrique, who previously led Barcelona to the title in 2015.\nPlayer of the Match Doue, just 19 years old, said: “I have no words. That was just incredible for me, simply incredible.”\nA visibly emotional Simone Inzaghi acknowledged Paris’ superiority, saying, “Paris deserved to win this game and the trophy. We’re disappointed, but I’m proud of how far we came.”\nMidfielder Nicolo Barella added, “They had more energy and quality. Sometimes in football, you must accept defeat.”\nFittingly, this was the fourth European Cup final held in Munich—and the fourth to see a club crowned champions for the first time. For Paris, it was a night when dreams became reality, as tears of frustration from past campaigns gave way to unbridled joy and historic glory.",
