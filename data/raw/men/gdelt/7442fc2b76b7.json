Then we will make the resume of the season.\n“But I’m really confident when we recover all the players that we are going to be a strong team. There is no doubts in my mind.”\nUnited begin 2026 on Sunday at rivals Leeds, where Amorim says he is “not going to risk anyone” making existing issues worse.\nBut the Red Devils would love a spark that was lacking against Wolves, who made life difficult and led to the Portuguese taking off goalscorer Zirkzee – who came in for injured Mount – at half-time to bring on teenager Jack Fletcher.\nAmorim confirmed the decision was “just tactical”, and added: “We need to do what the game was asking.\n“We were struggling, they put a lot of men in the middle of the park, and with Jack we balanced that. I think we recover the ball faster in the in the second half.\n“In the first half, we struggled a little bit to recover the ball, so I’m just looking not for their age and the experience. In this moment, I just look what I can do to win the game.”\nUnited reverted to Amorim’s favoured three-man defence having won with a back four – a set-up switch Wolves boss Edwards had predicted and prepared for.\nThe 43-year-old was proud of his players’ effort as they secured a first point since he took charge last month, with attention now turning to Saturday’s match against fellow strugglers West Ham.\n“It’s nice to take something from the game,” Edwards said. “I do feel it’s the least we deserve. I do. It’s progress. Overall, it was a really good performance.”\nAsked if his players could sense unease from the United fans, Edwards said: “Yeah, we talked about that at half-time.\n“We said to the lads, even when we were walking up the tunnel, ‘listen, listen’ because we know how difficult is to play in front of an unhappy crowd at the moment.\n“And ours are rightly unhappy. I get it, so I’m not complaining about that.\n“But, again, everyone tonight will be turning up expecting a win, maybe a comfortable one, and it wasn’t that.\n“I think they saw we created a few chances, and we were good and good value for it, so they won’t be happy. We had to try and play on that. We talked about that at half-time.”",
