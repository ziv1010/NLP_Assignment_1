  "body_text": "In September, Real Madrid lost 3-1 to Atletico Madrid in a defeat that raised doubts about Carlo Ancelotti’s side.\nMadrid were badly exposed in defence and the result meant they lost top spot in La Liga to Barcelona. Ancelotti’s deal was due to expire in July 2024 and, with reports continuing to link him to the Brazil national team job, you might have wondered how much longer he would be in charge at the Santiago Bernabeu.\nAdvertisement\nAlmost four months on, as Madrid prepare to face Atletico again in the Supercopa de Espana semi-finals in Saudi Arabia this evening (Wednesday), his position could not be more secure, and Ancelotti, 64, has just signed a contract extension until 2026.\nGO DEEPER\nAncelotti extension could see him stay at Real in non-coaching role\nSince the Madrid derby, his team have gone 13 La Liga games unbeaten, conceding five goals and scoring 29. That defeat — Real Madrid’s only loss of the season in all competitions — was a huge turning point. In the way he reacted to it, Ancelotti once again proved his supreme ability to expertly adapt to circumstances; the superpower behind his continued success at the Spanish club.\n“They opened our eyes,” Ancelotti said this month when talking about the Atletico game. “We were weak in the crosses and then we fixed it by keeping the centre-backs in the penalty area and with the help of the midfielders closing down the opposition’s full-backs.\n“We fixed the mistakes in the derby against Atletico and, although there are important injuries, the team is now very solid at the back.”\nThat night at the Metropolitano forced the Madrid boss to rethink the 4-4-2 diamond formation he had introduced in the summer. After seeing how the system left his full-backs exposed, Ancelotti decided to switch to a ‘box’ midfield — four players in the middle of the pitch, with two sitting alongside each other deeper than the other two.\nThe two attack-minded midfielders, usually Jude Bellingham and Federico Valverde, now help protect the flanks when Madrid are out of possession. This has strengthened Ancelotti’s team in defence and attack, with Bellingham finding Vinicius Junior more easily — as in the build-up to the Brazilian’s goal against Napoli in November.\nGO DEEPER\nWhy Real Madrid's versatile midfield is their super-strength\nThis is certainly not the first major tweak Ancelotti has made since last season. The Italian and his coaching team came up with the diamond formation after being left without a first-team striker following Karim Benzema’s move to Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia.\nAdvertisement\nThe system brought wingers Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr closer to the penalty area and allowed Bellingham to shine in attack, laying the foundations for the slightly modified and more stable system we are seeing now. Bellingham has especially benefited from being deployed in what is a new position for him, scoring 17 goals in 22 games since signing from Borussia Dortmund.\nAs the 2023-24 campaign has progressed, Ancelotti’s plans have also been disrupted by Madrid’s injury problems: goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, Eder Militao and David Alaba have all ruptured their anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) and there have been other key absences during the campaign. Antonio Rudiger and Nacho are Madrid’s only available senior centre-backs, so the Italian has turned to midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni as a backup option in defence.\nAncelotti recommended the signing of a centre-back after Alaba’s ACL injury last month but the Tchouameni solution took the pressure off the club. The club’s decision-makers are hesitant to sign another centre-back and Ancelotti understands that. It’s another sign of his pragmatism.\nIt was a similar situation last summer when, as The Athletic reported, Ancelotti recommended the signing of Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane to replace Benzema. Instead of complaining when the board turned down his suggestion, he again made the most of the resources at his disposal and concocted the new formation.\nMembers of the Bernabeu hierarchy were not happy with Ancelotti’s insistence on fielding Luka Modric and Toni Kroos together in that September Atletico defeat. It was seen as a gamble that went against the club’s policy of blooding young talent — between Bellingham, Eduardo Camavinga, Valverde and Tchouameni, the average age is just over 22 years.\nBut they do value the coach’s ability to get along with their cast of emerging stars and give them their space. Ancelotti has shown trust in the side’s exciting young talents while taking advantage of Madrid’s multiple injuries to continue to give playing time to Kroos and Modric. Ancelotti defends his ideas but always outwardly backs the decisions that are taken “for the good of the club”.\nAdvertisement\nIt is that understanding of Madrid’s idiosyncrasies and structure at the highest level that has led to him being described more than once by club sources (who, like all those cited here, preferred to speak anonymously to protect their positions) as “the best coach we could have” during this second spell at the Bernabeu.\nAncelotti certainly showed a deft touch with his handling of the situation with Brazil. For months, the president of the Brazilian Football Federation (CBF), Ednaldo Rodrigues, publicly expressed his desire to make Ancelotti the national team’s next head coach. Last April, the coach even said he would be “very excited” if Brazil wanted to appoint him.\n“The reality, everyone knows, is that I had contacts with the president of the CBF,” Ancelotti told a press conference after his renewal. “I want to thank Ednaldo Rodrigues for his affection and interest. He has made me feel very honoured and proud, but this was pending the situation I had with Real Madrid… I want to thank him for the affection but, in the end, things have gone as I wanted them to.”\nThe early announcement of Ancelotti’s renewal came as a surprise to the coach himself and those around the club, who are not used to seeing Madrid renew a manager’s contract mid-season. It was even more surprising given the team failed to win the Champions League and La Liga last term — practically a prerequisite to keep the job at Madrid.\nEven so, he was always clear on his priority: he wanted to stay at Madrid as long as they let him.\nMadrid are always exploring potential alternatives to their head coaches, but the club’s president, Florentino Perez, considered Ancelotti to be the one who guaranteed him the most stability. Perez and chief executive Jose Angel Sanchez maintain an excellent relationship with Ancelotti, who has huge respect for the medium- to long-term project outlined by the club hierarchy.\nEven with last month’s renewal, members of Ancelotti’s entourage do not take it for granted that he will stay at Madrid until 2026. They know a coach depends on his results — especially at Real Madrid.\nBut there can be no doubt that his stock at the club is as high as it has ever been.\n(Top photo: Fran Santiago/Getty Images)",
