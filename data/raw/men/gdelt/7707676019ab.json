  "body_text": "After years of bad decisions in the transfer market, Manchester United will need to act smart in the upcoming transfer window in order to acquire their desired profiles.\nSuch are the PSR concerns that new co-owners INEOS need to think about selling players first before thinking about recruitment.\nOne shrewd acquisition that the club are keeping an eye on is Galatasaray’s Baris Alper Yilmaz with his biggest attribute being his versatility.\nThe Turk prefers the right wing role but can also play on the opposite flank and even upfront while also doubling up as either a right-back or left-back.\nYilmaz links\nThe 23-year-old has played a key role this season, making 51 appearances across all competitions, while scoring six times and providing nine assists. Galatasaray are leading the Turkish league currently.\nTen Hag and United are aware of his talents after the player registered one of his assists against the Red Devils during the Champions League game at Old Trafford .\nHis ability to play across different positions on the pitch have seen him earn comparisons with Real Madrid’s versatile genius Federico Valverde and he has even been dubbed as the “Turkish Valverde”.\n“Premier League giants Aston Villa, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United are watching Galatasaray star Baris Alper Yilmaz with one scout feeling he could be the ‘Turkish Valverde’,” HITC Football reported.\n“The stellar form of Baris Alper Yilmaz has been a big reason for Gala’s success in 2023/24, scoring six goals and providing nine assists while catching the eye of Aston Villa, Tottenham, Man United, AFC Bournemouth and Brighton and Hove Albion.\n“Scouts, HITC have been told, have been drawn to Yilmaz’s versatility. One talentspotter has even drawn comparisons with Real Madrid’s Federico Valverde.”\nThat is not all as the Turkish international has also been compared with Gareth Bale in terms of strength and speed and with Phil Foden by former coach Ilker Puren.\n“I compare Baris Alper Yilmaz to Gareth Bale in terms of strength. He has the ability to sprint 3-4 meters after eliminating the opponent with the ball,” former coach Ilker Puren told GS Gazete.\n“One day, he will definitely play in the Premier League because physics comes to the fore there. He has also improved his positional knowledge. The level he is at now is close to Phil Foden.”\nVersatility is his forte\nSuch comparisons must have piqued United’s interest with the player said to be available for around £22 million. His ability to play on both flanks could come in handy considering the uncertain futures of Jadon Sancho, Antony and Marcus Rashford.\nHis ability to play as a full-back means Yilmaz could potentially come in if Aaron Wan-Bissaka is moved on or if the likes of Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia once again suffer from injury as seen this season.\nVictor Lindelof and Sofyan Amrabat have had to play as an emergency left-back due to lack of options. Yilmaz could certainly fill the void.\nConsidering his fee, this could prove a bargain buy. Lots of other teams are in the fray and this could be a deal worth keeping an eye on. Gala are also interested in multiple United players and the club could take advantage if they are serious about the player.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
