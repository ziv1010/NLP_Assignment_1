  "body_text": "Liverpool have emerged from one of the busiest stretches of their season with eleven points earned in five league games and a 13 point advantage in the title race, capped off by a dominant 2-0 victory over Newcastle.\nVirgil Van Dijk on “Intense 15 Days” in the Premier League Title Race\nLiverpool have come out of one of the busiest stretches of their season with a 13 point lead with ten games to go in the Premier League.\nThe focus now for the team is to keep their focus according to captain Virgil van Dijk. To rest and recover and then to go again, seeking to protect their advantage over the final three months of the 2024-25 season.\n“It was an intense 15 days, five games in 15 days,” Van Dijk said following Wednesday’s victory. “I think the main thing for all of us now is focusing on the next one and the next one now that we have a little bit of a gap.\n“We focus now on recovery of course and then we will have a couple of days off and then we focus on the Champions League—it will be a very big test as well—and then we focus back on the league and go again.”\nA shock defeat in the FA Cup to Plymouth means the Premier League leaders and one of the favourites in the Champions League won’t play this weekend, resulting in a rare week without football and a chance to rest.\nFor his part, Van Dijk isn’t entirely sure whether a break now is a clear positive—but they will try to take what positives they can from it as attention shifts to Europe and Paris Saint-Germain in the Round of 16 next week.\n“At this stage of the season you could argue it, sometimes you want to stay in the rhythm and sometimes it’s good to rest,” he added. “We have to maximise rest now because there is no other way and be ready for PSG.”",
