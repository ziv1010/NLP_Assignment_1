A charismatic leader, the German will exit the field after the Premier League match against Wolves knowing he leaves behind a lasting legacy at Anfield and as a bona fide club legend.\nStepping into his shoes will be no easy feat and, after much deliberation, it is Feyenoord coach Slot who has been selected as the man to ensure the drop-off post Klopp is not as serious as expected.\nChosen for his man-management skills and the similar way he approaches the game, the Reds have agreed to pay the Eredivisie side compensation worth up to €13m.\nGO DEEPER 👉 Five Liverpool players facing potential Anfield axe when Arne Slot moves to Merseyside\nConfirmation on his official appointment is expected to arrive a matter of hours after Klopp’s farewell and the Dutchman will inherit a squad about to embark on a return to the Champions League but one in which there remains quite a few issues to fix.\nWith that in mind Slot has already earmarked in conversations with CEO of football Michael Edwards of the squad additions the Reds need to focus on this summer.\nTo that end, a centre-half, a second-choice goalkeeper – with a once-capped England man backed to arrive should Caoimhin Kelleher depart – a left-back and a midfielder are likely to be top of the agenda come the summer window.\nLiverpool make strides towards Teun Koopmeiners signing\nA new midfield addition is likely to be key.\nThiago Alcanatara will depart Anfield at the end of his contract this summer after Liverpool decided that the Spaniard’s injury-record over his time on Merseyside – and in particular the last years especially – did not merit him earning a new deal.\nThere is also some doubts over whether summer 2023 signing Ryan Gravenberch will continue at Anfield into next season. A €40m signing from Bayern Munich, the Dutchman has failed to make a telling impression on Merseyside and is emerging as a transfer target for Galatasaray.\nA tempting offer for his services could yet convince Liverpool to sell up.\nAs a result, adding to his midfield options is very much in Slot’s thinking and one player very much of interest to the Reds is Atalanta midfielder Koopmeiners.\nThe Netherlands international has been on Liverpool’s radar for some time; first recommended to the club as a possible target by Klopp in summer 2023.\nBack then, Liverpool decided to pursue other options, though he has remained a player of interest and Liverpool have been encouraged by comments made by the player about wanting to leave Atalanta this summer.\nNow their hopes of securing his signing have been given a significant boost.\nAny deal for the 26-year-old will not come cheap off the back of an excellent season in Italy that has seen the player score 16 times and add another eight assists.\nHowever, it is indeed Atalanta’s demand for €60m that puts Liverpool right at the front of the queue and severely deflates Juventus’ chances of beating the Reds to his signature.\nReds ready to meet €60m fee to sign midfielder\nSuch a fee would place him beyond Juventus’ reach and, despite their plans to offload the likes of Gleison Bremer, Matias Soule and Dean Huijsen this summer, the Bianconeri will also need to strengthen other areas of their squad too.\nThat £51.6m fee would not be seen as totally obsene to the Reds and, with Slot having previously worked with the player before and having made him captain at AZ Alkmaar, the player is understood to be open at linking up with his former manager again, this time on Merseyside.\nAs Tuttosport note, Koopmeiners’ agent Bart Baving is currently in Italy holding talks with Juventus over a potential deal. And while they could offer him a payrise to take his salary from €2.5m a season to €4m a season (£41,000 a week to £65,000 a week), he knows that his salary would catapult even higher were he to make the move to the Premier League and presenting Liverpool with another significant advantage.\nDON’T MISS 👉How Liverpool could line up under Arne Slot with triple signing and one position change\nAs a result, Edwards is reportedly ready to top any offer Juventus present for Koopmeiners with the deal likely to be relatively straight forward if Slot gives the green light for the move to go through.\nAnd with Liverpool ‘have no problem satisfying’ La Dea over Koopmeiners’ asking price, nor paying him over and above what Juventus are capable of doing.\nIn short, both their financial mite, together with the presence of Slot puts the Reds well ahead in the transfer race and it’s widely expected in Italy that Koopmeiners will become the first major signing of the Dutchman’s Anfield reign.",
