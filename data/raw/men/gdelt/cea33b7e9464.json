  "body_text": "Speculation regarding Carlo Ancelotti’s potential departure from Real Madrid has been circulating for quite some time—particularly concerning the possibility of him taking over as head coach of the Brazilian national team.\nFor months, this idea has been floated, with the Italian manager repeatedly deflecting such talk in press conference after press conference.\nHowever, the prospect of Ancelotti taking charge of Seleção now appears more realistic than ever following the dismissal of Dorival Junior in March.\nSeveral outlets, including The Athletic, are now reporting that \"Ancelotti is expected to leave Real Madrid\" and that \"he appears poised to accept a role with the Brazilian national team.\"\nBrazil is keen to have Ancelotti lead the squad through the 2026 World Cup. He is reportedly their top candidate for the position, though Al Hilal manager Jorge Jesus is also being considered.\nStill, according to the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), Ancelotti remains “the president’s dream choice.”\nAncelotti has publicly stated that he would only leave Real Madrid if the club decides to part ways with him.\nNevertheless, The Athletic claims that Brazil is already in advanced talks with the 65-year-old manager.\nAccording to the report, a CBF representative was present at Real Madrid’s Champions League quarter-final loss to Arsenal on Wednesday night, with plans to meet Ancelotti later this week.\nHowever, when contacted by The Athletic, the Brazilian Football Federation (CBF) denied having sent any emissary to Madrid.\n“The matter is being handled solely by Rodrigo Caetano, the general executive coordinator of the men’s national teams, and CBF president Ednaldo Rodrigues—both of whom are currently in Rio de Janeiro,” the organization stated.\nReal Madrid is expected to clarify its managerial situation before the start of the FIFA Club World Cup, which kicks off on June 14.\nIn this same context, Fabrizio Romano reports that Xabi Alonso remains Real Madrid’s top priority to replace Ancelotti.\nHe adds that “Leverkusen will not stand in Alonso’s way, fully aware of his desire to return to Madrid after he turned down offers from the Premier League and Bayern Munich to stay last year.”",
