  "body_text": "Ange Postecoglou press conferences are always interesting, but today’s post-match after Tottenham Hotspur’s 2-1 win over Burnley was particularly illuminating. There was a lot to discuss — Micky van de Ven’s winning goal and stint as a substitute left back, Richarlison’s season-ending injury after Ange previously said he was fine, and Tottenham’s chances for Champions League qualification. Postecoglou touched on them all.\nPostecoglou praises Van de Ven, talks Richarlison injury after win over Burnley\nWith regards to Richy’s injury, turns out everyone was right!\nBut let’s start with Richarlison, since that was what was on everyone’s mind ahead of the match today. Yesterday, Postecoglou gave a press conference where he said there were no fresh injury concerns at the club after last week’s loss at Anfield. Two hours later, Brazil manager Dorival Junior released his squad for this summer’s Copa America which did not include Richy, and in comments to the press stated that the striker was out for the season with a calf injury “that the club has not announced yet.”\nThat caused a lot of consternation and confusion. Which one was right — Ange or Dorival Junior? Turns out, they were BOTH right. Postecoglou gave his press conference yesterday immediately after training, and Richy had apparently sustained his injury right at the end of that session. The full extent of the injury wasn’t known until after Ange was done speaking to the press, and that news then got its way (likely via Richarlison) to the Brazil camp.\n“It was unfortunate. I know I did the press conference yesterday, but it was literally the last kick of the game and I saw him hobble off and I assumed it was nothing serious. Then it didn’t get any better later on in the evening and he was sent for a scan on his calf and I still don’t know the results of that to be honest, but watching him today he was still hobbling about.\n“So that made it difficult for us. Like you said I had to get creative with the set-up, knowing that in the last half hour we would probably be dominant from a physical perspective because we have been pretty consistently. So having a set-up that at least gave us a chance to take advantage of the chances we had. Dane came on and worked really hard. I thought Rodri was really good when he came on as well. Radu did well so the subs made an impact.”\nThat creativity came in the form of starting a front three of Brennan Johnson (on the left), Son Heung-Min, and Dejan Kulusevski (on the right). In addition, Oliver Skipp made a rare start since the first of the calendar year, and at left back, in place of Emerson Royal. When Skipp tired in the second half, Ange opted to bring in Radu Dragusin and shift van de Ven to the left back position, where he thrived, bombing forward regularly and eventually scoring the winning goal.\nBut does this mean that Micky’s our left back from now to the end of the season? Not so fast, said Ange.\n“Yeah, at the same time I’ve been mindful with Micky that he’s had a couple of injuries and the demands of playing left-back are a lot different to playing centre-back. I just have to be careful - what’s more important is what we’re trying to build here, and I was reluctant to put him out there for that reason alone. It’s been quite a disrupted season and playing full-back as opposed to playing centre-back is a lot different from a physical perspective.\n“But yeah I thought for the last bit of the game it made sense, Skippy was only ever going to be able to play for more than about 60 minutes, he hasn’t played for ages. And Radu coming on I thought was very good when he came on as well, so it helped us get over the line and Micky’s goal was outstanding.”\nTottenham’s defensive pressure was outstanding against Burnley, forcing numerous turnovers and forcing keeper Arijanet Murich to play out of the back, often poorly. But Murich still had seven saves in this match, some of them fantastic, at times single-handedly keeping the Clarets in the match. Ange noted that Tottenham were significantly better on the day than Burnley, but the visitors, who were quite literally playing to avoid relegation, were dangerous because of what was at stake.\n“Yeah, [Muric] had a hell of a game. We probably should have won the game more comfortably. It was always going to be a tricky game for us because as much as you try and put it to one side, losing four games in a row, for the players there’s always a bit of stress and anxiety. And Burnley really had to go for it today - they had nothing to lose, I mean obviously they had a lot to lose but with their approach. I thought in the first half we controlled the game really well - I just thought we were a bit anxious in the final third with our decision making.\n“But I thought Pedro [Porro]’s goal before half-time was really important. And the second half was better, and we were stronger after half-time - we always are. It’s just that some recent games have got away from us. But today we were right in it. Pleasing for the players and credit to them for not getting too wound up and just playing our football.”\nWith today’s win along with Brighton drawing at Newcastle, Spurs now only need one point from their last two matches — at City and home to Sheffield United — to clinch fifth place and Europa League qualification. But when asked, Ange noted that Spurs are still, mathematically at least, not out of Champions League consideration, and that they will go out to win both of their remaining games, regardless of where that leaves Arsenal in the title race.\n“We’ve still got six points to play for. That’s the key thing for us. There’s a big game for us on Tuesday night against City and it will be a great test for us and the Sheffield United one. We’ll see where we can get to, playing our football and see what points we get and end up. Today was important for the supporters and for the players. When you lose four in a row, irrespective of the circumstances and the opposition, it can weigh on your mind. It can dent your confidence and belief. I thought they handled it well today and at least that gives us a platform to tackle these last two games.”",
