Simba, however, arrive with firepower and experience.\nSimba’s General Manager Dimitar Pantev has confirmed a 22-man squad for the away leg.\nThe traveling party includes goalkeepers Yakoub Suleiman and Hussein Abel, while the defensive wall will be manned by the likes of Shomari Kapombe, Karaboue Chamou and Rushine De Reuck, who will be vital in keeping Nsingizini’s attackers quiet.\nSimba’s midfield is a blend of youth and maturity, featuring Mzamiru Yassin, Kibu Denis and South African maestro Neo Maema, alongside tenacious talents like Elie Mpanzu and Jean Charles Ahoua.\nUpfront, the Red Giants are placing their hopes in Jonathan Sowah, Steven Mukwala and Seleman Mwalimu, who will be expected to penetrate the Hotspurs’ backline with pace and precision.\nYet, Simba will be without key names – midfield dynamo Mohammed Bajaber and firstchoice goalkeeper Moussa Camara who remain sidelined with injuries.\nAcross the border, Yanga will take on Silver Strikers tomorrow at Bingu National Stadium in Malawi’s capital, Lilongwe.\nThe Malawian giants, who boast a rich history in their domestic league, dispatched Equatorial Guinea’s FC Futuro Kings in the first preliminary round and have been revitalised under new technical leadership.\nKnown for their organised build-up play and disciplined midfield, Silver Strikers will be hoping to exploit their home turf and the chemistry of seasoned players like Stain Davie and Chikondi Kamanga.\nALSO READ: Tanzanian duo in key CAF ties\nBut they face a Yanga side built on hunger, momentum and continental ambition.\nCoach Romain Folz has summoned a 24-man squad, loaded with experience and raw talent.\nIn goal, Djigui Diarra leads a trio of trusted keepers, supported by defenders such as Lassine Kouma, Mohamed Hussein and Frank Assink, forming a backline designed to absorb pressure and launch fast transitions.\nIn midfield, Balla Conte, Mudathir Yahya, and Ivorian import Pacome Zouzoua are tasked with dictating tempo, while the striking force includes lethal options like Prince Dube, Maxi Nzengeli and Andy Boyeli.\nHowever, Yanga’s preparations have been affected by injuries.\nTalented forward Clement Mzize and Celestin Ecua miss the trip due to injuries, while key defender Dickson Job remains out after sustaining an injury while on national duty with the Taifa Stars during the World Cup qualifier against Zambia.\nBoth Simba and Yanga are acutely aware that an away goal or two could be the key to unlocking the group stage door, where Africa’s elite clubs battle under the bright lights of the CAF Champions League.\nThe return leg for Yanga will take place at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam in two weeks’ time, a fortress where the Jangwani boys will look to finish the job.\nSimba will also host Nsingizini Hotspurs in a reverse fixture set for the same period and venue and they will count on their passionate Msimbazi faithful to roar them forward",
