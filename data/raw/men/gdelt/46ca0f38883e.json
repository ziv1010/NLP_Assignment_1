  "body_text": "Arsenal and AFC Bournemouth face off at the Emirates Stadium on May 3 as the Gunners fight to consolidate second place on the Premier League table.\nThe Cherries have different objectives but remain keen on causing an upset in North London. There is so much to play for.\nArsenal fought the good fight but came up short again in their bid to clinch that elusive 14th Premier League title and will likely have to settle for second place for a third successive season.\nLiverpool sit 13 points clear of Arsenal at the summit with five games left at the time of writing and only need a win against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday to secure the title.\nNevertheless, Mikel Arteta and his men cannot take their foot off the gas as there is a fiercely-contested battle for the remaining UEFA Champions League places they must avoid getting sucked into.\nOn the other hand, AFC Bournemouth have already broken the record they set last season for their most points in a Premier League season (48).\nHowever, with a handful of games left, they are hungry for more, potentially a place in Europe.\nBournemouth are eight points off seventh place on the league log. Seventh will likely be enough for a Europa Conference League slot, and Andoni Iraola’s side cannot rest on their laurels.\nBournemouth know that every point counts. They will be eager to spring a surprise in North London and keep their continental hopes alive.\nThe Cherries stunned the North Londoners earlier this season, and Arteta’s men want revenge, setting the stage for an epic showdown.\nDon’t miss a moment of the action. Buy Arsenal vs Bournemouth tickets from Seatsnet.com to watch this fascinating tie live.\nHead to Head\nA 3-0 beatdown at the Emirates in May was the fourth successive loss Bournemouth had suffered in the top flight at the hands of Arsenal.\nHowever, Bournemouth shocked fans and pundits with a 2-0 win over Arsenal in October. William Saliba received his marching orders early, leaving his team shorthanded.\nBournemouth struggled to break Arsenal down despite the extra man advantage but found the breakthrough on 70 through Ryan Christie.\nJustin Kluivert ensured the win, comfortably dispatching a penalty nine minutes later.\nIt was only their second victory over Arsenal in the Premier League following their win versus the Gunners in January 2018.\nArsenal will back themselves to enact revenge on Bournemouth, but the Cherries are tricky customers and can frustrate those plans.\nBest XIs\nArsenal\nArsenal goalkeeper David Raya remains one of the best in the business. He has been a cornerstone for Arsenal this season and should be in the starting line-up when the Cherries visit the Emirates.\nMeanwhile, Ben White is up to full speed and should take his usual place at right-back. The England international is in line to partner Saliba and Jakub Kiwior in central defence.\nGabriel Magalhaes has been sidelined by injury, but Kiwior has impressed in his absence and will likely take the starting berth with Arsenal wunderkind Myles Lewis-Skelly on his left side.\nThe midfield of Thomas Partey, Declan Rice, and Martin Odegaard is a perfect blend of steel, stamina, and creativity.\nThey blow teams out of the water, technically and physically. The trio will control the engine room against Bournemouth.\nUp top, midfielder Mikel Merino is expected to lead the line. The Spaniard has enjoyed a new lease of life as a striker and will play a pivotal role for the Gunners in attack.\nWing wizards Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka flank Merino, bringing creativity and flair to open the stubborn Bournemouth rearguard.\nIt is worth noting that Arsenal have two Champions League semi-final games against Paris Saint-Germain sandwiching this Bournemouth fixture, and might rotate heavily with the Premier League title already lost.\n(4-3-3): Raya; White, Saliba, Kiwior, Lewis-Skelly; Odegaard, Partey, Rice; Saka, Merino, Martinelli.\nBournemouth\nGoalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga has been a revelation for Bournemouth following his loan move from Chelsea, and the Cherries are working to make the deal permanent.\nHe will be the last line of defence against Arsenal.\nAdam Smith and Milos Kerkez usually hold down the full-back spots. The latter has caught the attention of Premier League giants with his performances this season. Chelsea and Liverpool want to sign him.\nCalm and composed jewel Dean Huijsen complements no-nonsense, tough-tackling Illya Zabarnyi in central defence. The pair have a massive job as they try to stave off the Arsenal attackers.\nHardworking midfield duo Ryan Christie and Lewis Cook screen the backline. They also form the base from which the other four forwards can spring attacks.\nAhead of them, Dango Ouattara, Kluivert, and Antoine Semenyo are dangerous counterattacking forces that Arsenal must be wary of.\nThey can execute fast breaks in a blink, capitalising on turnovers.\nThey have run many teams ragged and will be out to claim another scalp at the Emirates. Arsenal must stay alert to avoid getting caught out.\nYoung Brazilian striker Evanilson starts up top and is a handful for any defence in the league.\nHe is not the most prolific, but his relentless pressure and impressive movement mean Arsenal must constantly keep an eye on him. He keeps defences honest and punishes lapses.\n(4-2-3-1): Kepa; Smith, Zabarnyi, Huijsen, Kerkez; Cook, Christie; Semenyo, Tavernier, Sinisterra; Evanilson.\nTicket Information\nReady to feel the excitement of Premier League football live from the stands?
