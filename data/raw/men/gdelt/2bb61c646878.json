A player with personality, above all, more than quality, means that an important shirt like Real Madrid's doesn't weigh so much.\"\nThat personality was on display when he led England to the World Cup quarter-finals last year in Qatar at only 19.\nThus far Ancelotti has deployed Bellingham as a number 10, providing a strong physical presence in the area behind the nimble Brazilian duo of Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior, the latter of whom is currently injured.\nThe only match in which he has not scored was Sunday's 2-1 comeback victory over Real Sociedad, where he dropped deeper and got stuck into the midfield battle.\n\"He had a consistent game, he didn't get into the box until right at the end but he was involved throughout, working a lot,\" said Ancelotti.\nBellingham's goals have replaced Benzema's -- he has played more like the French forward than Les Bleus icon Zidane since joining the club.\nReal Madrid were linked with Paris Saint-Germain striker Kylian Mbappe this summer, who has made it clear he was keen on joining Los Blancos.\nHowever with Mbappe's contract due to expire at the end of the season it would have been a big and potentially unnecessary investment for Madrid, which they thought better of.\nBellingham's goals were the final nail in that coffin as he showed he can make the difference in the opposition box in the attacking position Ancelotti has created for him.\nPerhaps Mbappe will arrive next summer, and perhaps a new coach will change Bellingham's role once Ancelotti takes over the Brazilian national team, but in the short term, the current set up has suited coach and player just fine.\n© 2023 AFP",
