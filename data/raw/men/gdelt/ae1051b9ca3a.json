Anything beyond that will be a bonus for us,” Sangala said.\nApart from facing LDF in their four-team group, Ntopwa will also take on defending champions Green Buffaloes of Zambia and Double Action Ladies from Botswana.\nGroup B has South Africa’s Mamelodi Sundowns, the Comoros’ Olympic de Moroni, Costa do Sol of Mozambique and Young Buffaloes of e-Swatini.\nThe top two teams from each group will advance to the semi-finals. Only winners of the qualifiers, played in round-robin format, will represent the Cosafa region in Ivory Coast.\nAccording to a statement from the Council for Southern Africa Football Associations (Cosafa), LDF are searching for their first win in the qualifiers after their debut appearance in the inaugural edition in 2021 saw them losing 6-0 to eventual champions Mamelodi Sundowns and Double Action Ladies. They drew one-all against Manzini Wanderers from e-Swatini.\nNtopwa have beefed up their squad by roping in Nyasa Big Bullets Women striker Vanessa Chikupira and Civil Service United Women forward Linda Kasenda on loan and Sangala said they have gelled well with the rest of the squad.\nApart from the two players, Ntopwa also bank their hopes on the likes of midfielder and captain Saliva January, striker Yamikani Mhango, defender Lynes Mbera and goalkeeper Mercy Sikelo.\nOn the other hand, LDF have strengthened their side by signing their defender Thato Mapepesa from Banthu Ladies and Massive Ladies’ goalkeeper Mamakhabane Makibinyane, according to an article on www.maserumetro.com .\nNational Women’s Football Association (NWFA) chairperson Adelaide Migogo said they are overjoyed to see a Malawian women’s football team participating in an African club competition.\n“We should all come together in support of this team and we wish them all the best. This should also act as a wake-up call for the corporate world to start sponsoring women’s football in the country,” she said.",
