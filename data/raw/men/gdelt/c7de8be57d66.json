  "body_text": "LOS ANGELES — Christian Pulisic won’t turn 25 until later this summer, but America’s most famous men’s soccer player sounded like a grizzled veteran on Saturday.\nVisiting Los Angeles on a preseason tour with his newest club, the storied Italian side AC Milan, Pulisic’s past five years have intertwined accomplishments and setbacks as he evolved from a can’t-miss prospect to an established star.\nA World Cup qualification. A Gold Cup, among other national team celebrations. Serving as the face of U.S. men’s soccer. Plus lifting a coveted UEFA Champions League title at Chelsea.\nYet a sense that Pulisic and his American teammates could have done more than they did. And a stop-start run in London that saw him play his best only in spurts, earning the heat of English supporters and media.\nPositive or negative, these aspects of a once implausible dream that arose from watching Premier League games with his father, Mark, back in Hershey, Pennsylvania, are now realities that Pulisic takes in stride.\n“It’s all part of a player’s career,” he said during a press conference at BMO Stadium, where Milan shook off jet lag and trained prior to a friendly against Real Madrid on Sunday at the Rose Bowl. “If it was just all up all the time it wouldn’t be as exciting and it’s what makes the good times even better.”\nOn the cusp of his physical prime, the quick attacker signed with Milan until 2027. The iconic Serie A club was sold last year for $1.2 billion to an American group, RedBird Capital Partners, which also aligned the Rossoneri with the New York Yankees.\nSo it only made sense to get “Captain America” following a difficult final season at Chelsea, which included three separate managers and too much time on the bench because of what Pulisic described as his inconsistent play.\n“It’s a big moment for me,” Pulisic said, discussing his next chapter. “It’s a fresh start. I’m really excited to go and give that good first impression in the club, get the trust of my teammates and, hopefully, play really well with them and look forward to this challenge.\n“You feel like you have to give something extra. Really show them that you’re part of this team. You’re good enough. It’s a little bit crazy feeling but I think it’s important to believe in yourself, trust in your ability.”\nThrough a whirlwind first week, the early returns for Milan and Pulisic have been strong.\nAn exhibition match in Italy prior to departing for the States included Pulisic tormenting defenders and assisting twice within 20 minutes.\nOff the field, Milan said retail sales shot up in the wake of acquiring Pulisic for a transfer fee of $22 million dollars, which is a third less than what Chelsea paid Borussia Dortmund for the forward in 2019.\nAt the start of that Bundesliga season, Pulisic’s final one in Germany, Dortmund brought their wunderkind to L.A. for an exhibition match against the LAFC at BMO Stadium, where he took questions afterward in the same press room he would hold court in five years later.\n“It’s really special for me and I try not to take it for granted,” Pulisic said of his soccer journey. “It’s hopefully a really exciting and even better next four or five years.”\nWhen: Sunday, 7 p.m.\nWhere: Rose Bowl, Pasadena\nTV/Radio: ESPN, ESPN+",
