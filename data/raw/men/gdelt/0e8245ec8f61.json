  "body_text": "With Nottingham Forest riding high in the Premier League, the club will have the opportunity to cement their position with new additions when the transfer window opens. Adding depth to their attacking arsenal will be the primary focus.\nNuno Espirito Santo will also be keen to keep what he already has, with Forest’s successful start to the campaign having enhanced the reputations of a few key figures in his Forest squad.\nHere, we take a look at how January might unfold at the City Ground.\nAdvertisement\nWhat positions will they be looking at in January?\nChris Wood is in exceptional form, having scored 10 goals already for Forest as they have climbed into the Champions League places — and Nuno holds him in exceptionally high esteem.\nWhile Taiwo Awoniyi is also an established Premier League forward; somebody who provides quality competition and cover for the New Zealand international.\nBut the priority, nevertheless, remains to sign a third quality forward, simply to ensure Forest have the required goalscoring depth, in case anything happens to Wood or Awoniyi.\nBeyond any efforts to sign a striker, Forest will also look at younger players, who they can develop for the future.\nWhich players do they want?\nForest worked hard to add a striker during the last transfer window. Amid some impressive recruitment — including key figures Nikola Milenkovic and Elliot Anderson — it was their only frustration when the end of August arrived without them adding another to their ranks.\nOmar Marmoush was the player Forest pushed hardest for towards the end of the window, when they had at least two bids rejected by Eintracht Frankfurt. The Egypt international’s stock has only risen since and he has likely moved out of Forest’s reach — despite their lofty position in the Premier League.\nForest’s bright start to the campaign and their position among those chasing European qualification might make them a more attractive proposition to potential new additions this time around.\nWho will they be looking to sell?\nForest will look for a move for forgotten man striker Emmanuel Dennis. He spent last season on loan at Basaksehir in Turkey and at former club Watford.\nForest spent £10million to sign him from Watford in the summer of 2022 and are unlikely to recoup anything close to that figure. But a move would be best for all parties.\nAdvertisement\nOne player who is expected to remain at the City Ground is Awoniyi. Forest still regard him as being an important member of their squad and they are in no rush to weaken their attacking options in January, midway through the season.\nThere has previously been interest in Anthony Elanga with Newcastle United seeing more than one bid for him rejected in the summer. At the time, selling the Sweden international would have been seen as a backward step in the final days of the window. That position is unlikely to have changed in January, with Elanga having scored two goals in two games, as Forest climbed into the Champions League places.\nWill anyone move out on loan?\nAndrew Omobamidele is the obvious contender for a loan move. While regarded as a decent prospect, the former Norwich City player is well down the pecking order.\nFollowing the arrival of Milenkovic and Morato in the summer, Forest are well stocked in the centre of defence, where Murillo and Willy Boly are further quality options. Omobamidele has previously been linked with a move to Leeds United, who are managed by his former Norwich manager, Daniel Farke.\nForest have a decision to make over 18-year-old defender Zach Abbott. He is regarded as a potential star of the future and is a part of Nuno’s first-team squad.\nBut the club must decide what is best for his development if an opportunity does arise for him to play regular first-team football.\nWho will make the key decisions in January?\nForest’s recruitment team have excelled in the last few windows and, while Lina Souloukou will begin her role as chief operating officer on January 5, that should not impact on the recruitment dynamic.\nThe leading figures in Forest’s recruitment strategy are chief football officer Ross Wilson, head of recruitment Pedro Ferreira and global technical director George Syrianos.\nAdvertisement\nForest owner Evangelos Marinakis also has an influence on new signings — as does head coach Nuno. But it is Syrianos, Wilson and Ferreira who are tasked with identifying potential targets.\nEdu is expected to join the Marinakis football empire in a senior role that will encompass all of the clubs within it. But his arrival is not expected until the summer.\nWhat is their PSR position?\nThe impressive business Forest did in the summer did not just apply to new signings, they made some astute sales as well.\nThe deal that saw Anderson arrive for £35m from Newcastle in a deal that effectively saw Odysseas Vlachodimos included as a £20m sale, was inspired.\nWhile a further £27m was raised by the sale of defender Moussa Niakhate to Lyon and Orel Mangala’s loan move, also to Lyon, was made permanent for a sum of £10m. So Forest have room to manoeuvre, but the need for caution remains.\nSo while Forest do have a budget for new additions, their recent habit of careful planning will need to be maintained.\nWhat is the manager’s priority?\nThe Portuguese felt one of the biggest successes of the summer was holding on to players like Morgan Gibbs-White and Murillo; at keeping the core of his squad together.\nThe same will be true in January. When asked if Forest’s league position will make the club a more attractive proposition for signings, Nuno said before the visit of Tottenham Hotspur: “I do not see it this way. I focus on our squad and being ready to avoid any kind of surprises. This is my main concern.”\nKeeping players does not just mean fending off any offers for their key figures. Forest are working to agree new contracts with both leading scorer Wood and influential defender Ola Aina.\nNew Zealand international Wood does have interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia but the club believe he is happy at Forest and are hopeful a two-year contract can be agreed to extend the 33-year-old’s stay at the club.\nAdvertisement\nAina’s stock has risen since he signed as a free agent in the summer of 2023, but Forest are willing to award his progress with improved terms. Talks continue with both players.\nWhile James Ward-Prowse has not played a huge amount of football since signing on loan from West Ham United, he is also a player Nuno values as a positive influence around the dressing room and there are no plans to terminate his loan.\nForest also have the option to make Alex Moreno’s loan from Aston Villa permanent, but that option will remain in place as the season goes on so there is no immediate pressure to activate it in January.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
