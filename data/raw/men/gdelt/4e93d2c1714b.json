The final phase would see the camps in the south disarmed, ending with Ain Al Hilweh – the largest and most heavily armed of the 12 camps and the most likely challenge.\nThe issue of disarming Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, which fall outside Lebanese state control, has long been a contentious one. Armed groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad – aligned with Hezbollah and committed to armed resistance against Israel – have previously used Lebanon as a launch pad for attacks across the border.\nThe Palestinian Authority is internationally recognised as the governing body of parts of the Palestinian territories, but its legitimacy is contested by many Palestinians. In Lebanon, Palestinian refugee camps are not governed by the PA, but by inter-factional committees – some of whom do not pledge loyalty to the PA.\nWhile some Palestinians view weapons as essential for self-defence, citing memories of the 1975–1990 Lebanese Civil War, others say arms have become tools of internal strife and criminal activity.\nUnder a long-standing understanding, the Lebanese army does not enter the Palestinian camps, leaving security to be handled by the factions themselves. That agreement, however, may be coming to an end.\nLebanese security sources and Fatah officials previously told The National that the plan to disarm the camps will involve lifting the army’s non-intervention policy.\n“The discussions during the visit are focused on camp security and preventing the camps from becoming havens for fugitives,” the Palestinian source said. “The Palestinian Authority does not want Palestinians to form a ‘state within a state,’ and we are ready to co-operate with any proposal put forward by the Lebanese authorities.”\nSerhan Serhan, deputy secretary of Fatah in Lebanon, echoed that position.\n“We believe and trust that the Lebanese army will stabilise Lebanon, and we are part of Lebanon,” he said. “We are ready to co-operate.”",
