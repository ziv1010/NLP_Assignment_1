I feel that (being part of the Manchester United family),\n‘Not only in the stadium but I feel it in the streets. This afternoon I was walking in Deansgate and the love the Manchester fans still give me is incredible.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

Villa is doing well this year so it’s a nice game to watch.’\nVan Persie, ultimately, left enthralled after watching Rasmus Hojlund finally break his Premier League duck after a 15-game goal drought, to seal a memorable victory.\n‘I hope we get a good game in and three points,’ he added in his pre-match interview.\n‘I know Erik is working very hard, he is working long days. The boys are working hard so it would be nice to get three points with a really good game of football for themselves and for the fans.’\nWhether Hojlund, meanwhile, is now capable of kicking on and matching Van Persie’s achievments remains to be seen, but Ten Hag is confident the Dane will now kick on after finally breaking his domestic duck.\nMore Trending\n‘Of course I’ve had several talks with him and every time I’ve pointed out he has scored for Denmark a lot, he has scored in the Champions League, he has demonstrated his ability so you can do it, believe,’ Ten Hag said of the 20-year-old striker.\n‘I’m sure now he has the first goal he will score more…\n‘When a striker doesn’t score it’s a problem but he has a strong character, he is so solid, determined. He has a big personality. I think this is what a striker needs. When you keep investing, the goals will come.’\nMORE: Manchester United monitoring PSV winger Johan Bakayoko\nMORE: Belgian wonderkid Arthur Vermeeren responds to Manchester United transfer links\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
