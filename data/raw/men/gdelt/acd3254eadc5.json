Just a couple of years removed from coming so close to winning the FIFA World Cup, Didier Deschamps’ crew comes to Germany with expectations of easily advancing beyond the group stage, and then some. They are led by one of the greatest players today, Kylian Mbappe. The new Real Madrid star is hoping to help his return to past glory. They were not able to challenge for the title are Euro 2020, but with players like N’Golo Kante supporting Mbappe, Les Bleus is going to be a tough team to beat.\nAustria is not on anyone’s radar as a favorite to win Group D, let alone be a semifinalist.
