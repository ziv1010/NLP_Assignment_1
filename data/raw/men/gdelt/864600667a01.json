  "body_text": "Tottenham Hotspur ran out comfortable winners against Slavia Prague, barely getting out of second gear against below-par Champions League opposition.\nRicharlison came close to opening the scoring after just 40 seconds, after Wilson Odobert brilliantly crafted a crossing opportunity from the left to give the Brazilian a golden chance from six yards out. Unfortunately, it was an inspired performance from Prague goalkeeper Jindrich Stanek, who singlehandedly prevented the scoreline from being far more emphatic.\nAdvertisement\nTottenham got their opener through a comedic own goal from David Zima, who powered the ball into his own net from a corner. While Prague offered a threat in transition in the first half, Spurs went into the break 1-0 up.\nThe second period was far more comfortable for Thomas Frank’s side, extending the lead from the penalty spot first through Mohammed Kudus and then Xavi Simons, who scored his second goal in as many games from 12 yards.\nThe Athletic’s Jay Harris and Elias Burke analyse the talking points from a pleasing win.\nSon Heung-min’s homecoming\nTottenham’s pre-season game against Newcastle United in Seoul was a beautiful tribute to Son Heung-min. The forward waved goodbye to Spurs after 10 incredible years and had the privilege of doing so in his home country. The entire stadium applauded every touch and he was in tears when he walked off the pitch. He then departed for a new challenge with Los Angeles FC. It was almost the perfect ending but Son needed to make one last appearance at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to honour his legacy.\nA few days before Tottenham’s game against Slavia Prague, it was announced that Son would attend. It turned what could have been an otherwise unglamorous Champions League tie into a must-see event. A new mural of Son was unveiled on Tottenham High Road before kick-off and there was a huge cheer when a video of him arriving at the stadium was shown on the television screens around the ground.\nEverybody applauded, apart from the away fans who started to chant but were quickly drowned out when Son emerged from the tunnel. The 33-year-old looked emotional and took a few seconds to compose himself before giving the crowd a brief message.\nSon’s first words were “I hope you guys don’t forget me”, which is impossible after he scored 173 goals in 454 games. Son then added “this will always be my home” and encouraged fans to watch him play for Los Angeles FC before finishing up with “come on you Spurs.”\nAdvertisement\nSon received a gift from Ledley King, another former Spurs captain, and walked down the tunnel where he received a hug from Guglielmo Vicario. It was a wholesome start to the evening, which let the Spurs fans shower their hero with love.\nIt was made even more special for Son when Ben Davies made his first appearance of the season, coming on as a second-half substitute. Son is the godfather of Davies’ son Ralph, with the pair having become close friends during their 10 years together in N17.\nJay Harris\nVan de Ven suspension a frustrating blow\nGame-to-game changes have been a theme of Thomas Frank’s tenure, but there are a few players who, when fit, are almost exempt from the tinkering. Naturally, as the starting goalkeeper, Guglielmo Vicario is one. Club captain Cristian Romero is another, as is his centre-back partner Micky van de Ven.\nHowever, after picking up a booking in the first half, the Dutch speedster will miss January’s penultimate league phase match against Borussia Dortmund due to an accumulation of yellow cards. Before being rested in the 2-2 draw to Newcastle United earlier this month, Van de Ven had played every minute of Spurs’ Premier League and Champions League campaigns as one of the team’s standout and most important players.\nDortmund owe a fair amount of their early-season success to striker Serhou Guirassy, who has scored five goals in the league this season and ended last season’s league phase as the tournament’s top scorer. If Spurs are to progress automatically into the knockout stages, they will likely have to beat Dortmund, and without Van de Ven, keeping the Guinea international quiet becomes more challenging — even if Kevin Danso has proven himself a capable deputy.\nElias Burke\nWhat does this mean for Spurs’ top-eight chances?\nTottenham needed to beat Slavia Prague to increase their chances of finishing in the top eight of the Champions League, and with it secure a place in the last 16. Slavia Prague looked threatening on the counter but Thomas Frank’s side returned to winning ways after losing to Paris Saint-Germain a couple of weeks ago.\nAdvertisement\nSpurs have a perfect record at home in the competition this season — in complete contrast to their underwhelming performances in the Premier League in front of their own fans. They have beaten Villarreal, Copenhagen and Slavia Prague without conceding and produced some of their most entertaining football under Frank.\nIf Spurs want to avoid the dreaded play-off round, they will likely need maximum points from their final two games against Borussia Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt. Spurs beat Frankfurt 1-0 in Germany in March in the quarter-final of the Europa League.\nWhat will give Frank cause for concern heading into those games is how many chances Slavia Prague created. Youssoupha Sanyang was a constant threat with his speed, while Lukas Provod got into some dangerous positions. Provod lashed a left-footed volley just past the post in the 12th minute. Michal Sadilek had a good opportunity to equalise before half-time but Guglielmo Vicario pushed his shot away. David Doudera had the best chance to score when he received the ball in the box completely unmarked but he somehow missed the target.\nSpurs might be punished by Dortmund and Frankfurt if they offer them the same opportunities. If they tighten up in defence while maintaining some of the swagger they showed tonight, Frank’s side could crash the top eight.\nJay Harris\nWhat did Thomas Frank say?\n“I think actually (Mohammed Kudus) started the season quite well. Then he had a dip, and now I think the last three performances it seems we had that freshness, energy, acceleration, decisiveness in his actions. And Xavi’s (last) two performances have been positive. So that of course is so important, what I call form, sharpness, getting more in sync with each other, the team. I think all that is important.”\nWhat next for Tottenham?\nSunday, December 14: Nottingham Forest (Away), Premier League, 2pm UK, 9am ET",
