His last game for the Buccaneers was against Al Ahly in the CAF Champions League group phase.\nORLANDO PIRATES STAR SALENG TO SUBMIT TRANSFER REQUEST AT THE END OF THE SEASON\nIn recent months, his absence has been making headlines, with the club stating that it is due to ‘personal issues.’\nHowever, rumour has it that he had a fallout with the club after his camp asked for a pay rise.\nAgainst the reports, his parents and close friends opened up about his woes in an exclusive interview with Sunday World.\nSaleng’s parents said he was no longer happy at Orlando Pirates. His father noted his salary as one of the problems.\nHe said, “The problem is the contract. We would want him to stick with Pirates because it is one of the biggest clubs in the country.” The star player is apparently earning around R70 000 at Orlando Pirates.\nSpeaking to the media about his contractual issues, Saleng’s friend, Boikanyo Maine, said, “If he was not an important asset, Bafana could not have called him. We are requesting that Pirates consider what he wants.\n“It’s unfair; imagine getting R70 000, but your contribution in most of the matches speaks volumes, while somebody [else] is getting R500 000.”\nDespite being on the sideline for months, Saleng was included in the Bafana Bafana CHAN qualifiers squad that squared off against Egypt.\nHe was included in the first line and had his moments of brilliance in the 1-1 draw. Against his performance reports have it that Saleng is set to leave Orlando Pirates at the end of the season.\n‘HE’S NOT HAPPY WITH HOW HE HAS BEEN TREATED’\nHowever, reports suggest that he is set to submit a transfer request at the end of the season. The reasons behind his Orlando Pirates woes have been pinned on ‘contract issues’ and unfair treatment.\nA close source to the star revealed to the media that Saleng wants out at Orlando Pirates.\n“He’s not happy with how he has been treated by Pirates. He feels he deserves better, especially for what he has done for the club,” the source revealed to the media.\nKaizer Chiefs is reportedly monitoring his situation. Will the Soweto giants pull one of the most shocking transfers in PSL history?\nIS HE STILL A BUCCANEER?\nHowever, the reports come barely a few days after Orlando Pirates coach Mandla Ncikazi failed to answer media questions after being asked about Saleng’s future at Orlando Pirates.\nAfter the Orlando Pirates’ 2-0 defeat, Mandla was asked if Saleng was still a Buccaneer.\nThe Orlando Pirates coach seemingly avoided the question and promised Orlando Pirates fans good football and better results in their next fixtures.\nWILL ORLANDO PIRATES LET GO OF MONNAPULE SALENG AT THE END OF THE SEASON?\nLet us know by leaving a comment below or send a WhatsApp to 060 011 021 1\nSubscribe to The South African website’s newsletters and follow us on WhatsApp, Facebook, X and Bluesky for the latest news.",
