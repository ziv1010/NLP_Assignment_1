  "body_text": "Tottenham Hotspur are reportedly keen on signing Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig this summer.\nThe player has been linked with Chelsea as well, and it will be interesting to see where he ends up. The 22-year-old Netherlands International has done quite well in Germany, and he has the technical attributes to do well in England as well.\nTottenham need more cutting edge in the final third, and the 22-year-old could be a useful long-term investment for them. He is capable of operating in multiple attacking roles, and his versatility will be an added bonus.\nIt will be interesting to see if they can beat Chelsea to his signature. The Blues have more resources compared to Tottenham, and they have been working on the transfer longer than the north London club.\nSpurs eyeing Xavi Simons\nFormer Premier League scout Mick Brown revealed to Football Insider: “But one player I hear they’ve been looking at is Xavi Simons.\n“I’ve heard good things about him, and he’s clearly a decent player because Chelsea have been interested in him for pretty much the whole summer.\n“If Tottenham have identified him as an option, they’ll have to move quickly and quietly to get it done.”\nTottenham need someone like Simons\nTottenham have started the season well, and they will look to sustain their current run of form. They need more quality on the site. They will be competing in the UEFA Champions League as well, and they cannot hope to do well in multiple competitions with their current depth.\nSimons would give them more options in the attack. The 22-year-old is young enough to improve further, and he could develop into a top-class player with the right guidance. Thomas Frank might be able to elevate his game and help him fulfil his potential. It will be interesting to see if they come forward with a lucrative proposal to win the race for his signature.",
