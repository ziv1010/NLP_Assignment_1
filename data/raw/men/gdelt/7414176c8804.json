It is also time for refs to start brandishing a Yellow card the very first time dissent is experienced. Likewise for blatant time wasting.\nThe players are also starting to become annoying by holding their head when fouled at times just to waste time fully knowing the refs are instructed to stop games for potential head injuries.\nAll very annoying but needs clamping down on.\nInjured ? trainer comes on and play continues - player misses next 3 minutes of the game to recover, ball hits trainer - free kick to opposition\n95% of players receiving medical treatment are running freely in the next 2 minutes*. *made up fact\nCramp in the last 10 minutes ? leave the pitch and don't come back on\nIf a player can't take a throw in after 20 seconds (Fleetwood) then it goes to the opposition.\nFree Kick - 20 seconds to take it or booking and goes to opposition\nGoal kick - 20 seconds to take it or booking and corner\nHead injury? -we'll need to check that mate - 5 minutes off\nif the world cup can go to Qatar the above is possible and BETTER for the game\nReferees are weak and pretty poor in this village football league but need rules to support common sense decisions.\nBurns play acting at Oxford included, Burns, Bonne shouting at linesman on Saturday - sent OFF.\nAll games involoving Fleetwood, Oxford and any other cheating boring time wasting jokers to be erased from football records due to their antics.\nI've fixed it !\nKeepers should have to get the ball back in play within a certain time - wasn't that a rule once ? likewise standing over the ball to stop a free kick being taken ....just move the ball 10 yards forward and the same for arguing with the ref ....it works in rugby !\nI still maintain that an early yellow card would focus the mind before others try it. Time limits need to be placed on certain set pieces. As mentioned above 20 secs is ample time to take a throw in and should also be incurred from the time the ball is placed for a goal kick. I remember over past years when goalkeepers were allowed either 10 or 12 secs to hold on to the ball and another scheme where they were allowed four bounces before they had to release the ball. Something the 4th official could keep an eye on so the ref can concentrate on other forms of cheating going on.\nAl5hough I cannot understand why a player wants to whip his shirt off when he scores a goal (are you listening Bersant) this currently warrants a yellow but cheating/time wasting goes unchecked.\nOur players are no angels either. Morsy's right hander against Accrington only one of many nasty niggles by our captain and more recently Norwood's body block on a Cambridge player right in front of the 4th official went unpunished.\nBack in the 60's/70's the game was much rougher and tougher but there was none of the continuous cheating that goes on in every game now. Kevin Beattie, Billy Bremner, Norman Hunter, Dave Mackay etc….did they need to cheat? No and neither did the players they whacked as they just got up and carried on and exacted revenge later in the game\nEither a ruling is made to eradicate such spoilers tactics or we have to get used to it. The issue is compounded by poor refereeing in league one imo. Maybe we should've utilised the tactics at Oxford.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
