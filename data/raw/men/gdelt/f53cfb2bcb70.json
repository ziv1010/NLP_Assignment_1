  "body_text": "Manor Solomon must have found everything about Saturday’s FA Cup fourth-round tie cathartic.\nFor the first time in seven months, the Fulham winger completed 90 minutes in a competitive match. His run out against Sunderland was his first full outing since a 2-2 draw for Israel against Iceland last summer, and his first at club level since he played for Shakhtar Donetsk in a 1-1 draw with Sheriff Tiraspol in the Champions League way back in December 2021.\nAdvertisement\nAs years go, his 2022 was emotionally exhausting. He first fled war in Ukraine, existing in limbo as the domestic football was suspended, and then endured a protracted transfer saga to join Fulham which, at one point, meant he could train with his new team-mates but not even feature in pre-season friendlies.\nTo top it off, he suffered a knee injury that would keep him sidelined for 12 weeks to choke any momentum generated by his debut as a substitute in the Premier League against Liverpool.\nA first Fulham start, then, felt long overdue.\nUnsurprisingly he appeared eager to make up for lost time in a match defined by its wingers. Their creativity and flair helped both teams produce a combined 39 shots, and they also contributed the subplots. For Sunderland, there was Patrick Roberts, the one-time boy wonder who struggled to achieve greater things after leaving Fulham. He may still, judging from his outstanding performance back at Craven Cottage, dovetailing exquisitely with the excellent Manchester United loanee, Amad Diallo.\nFor Fulham, there was Solomon but also Harry Wilson, two wingers who have been condemned to a shared fate this season.\nSo happy to get my first 90 minutes after a long time! We will finish the job in the next game💪🏻🤍🖤 @FulhamFC pic.twitter.com/ft8ApaIo14\n— Manor Solomon (@Manorsolomon) January 28, 2023\nBoth had high expectations before the season kicked off, eager to make their mark in the Premier League, and both would have envisaged becoming key components of Marco Silva’s team. Yet when Solomon suffered his injury in a behind-closed-doors match in August, he joined Wilson in the treatment room, the Welshman having been sidelined a week before with a similar knee issue. That meant Saturday’s tie had much riding on it for their hopes of breaking into the league XI.\nAdvertisement\nAt full-time, with the contest drawn 1-1, the conclusions felt divergent. Solomon seems closer to challenging current incumbents Willian and Bobby De Cordova-Reid. Wilson, meanwhile, is still searching for his spark — something that burned so brightly last year, only for injury to snuff it out.\n“It has been a tough season for him,” said Silva of Wilson in the build-up to the Sunderland tie. “He was always involved in our best moments last year. He was one of the players that arrived in the best form and better shape in pre-season. He was so good and started really well, confident, playing his best football.\n“Unfortunately he got injured. It broke completely his good moment. Now, it’s up to him to get to that level again because he has the quality. He has to play with much more confidence, and of course, he needs minutes.”\nIt is easy to overlook just how influential Wilson was last year. He had 29 goal involvements in the Championship, more than any other creative midfielder, and provided 19 assists, the most since Opta started recording them in 2013-14. He seemed set for a pivotal year, one that would allow him to prove his Premier League credentials while also helping Wales at the World Cup.\nHe would share in that historic moment in Qatar, returning in time from injury to participate in the tournament. But his best form alludes him.\nAgainst Sunderland, there were flashes of his quality. Twice he cut inside off the left and let fly, fizzing one shot wide and seeing another sting the palms of Anthony Patterson. He raced to keep up with Andreas Pereira on the counter, breezing past his marker but then failing to shape the angle kindly for the shot. Again, Patterson denied him. Then there was a hefty touch which took the ball too wide to strike with any purchase. He needed a moment. A break. Something to lift him.\nAdvertisement\nIt has not been easy for Wilson. During pre-season, his work to ensure he was razor sharp for the new campaign generated real excitement behind the scenes, but, after injury, he has emerged into a changed landscape. A player who might have been first-choice now finds himself lower down the pecking order.\n“He knows he has all my confidence,” said Silva. “He has all the support. Now it’s up to him to pop up and show his quality. I believe you will see the best of Harry Wilson again in the next months of the season.”\nSolomon, in contrast, appears to be going from strength to strength.\nHe was lively against Sunderland, twisting and turning his full-back and then burrowing into tight spaces with relish. He created three chances in total. From the best, Pereira was somehow denied by a combination of Dan Ballard and Patterson.\nA clearance as good as a goal 🚫@dg_ballard, take a bow 👏@SunderlandAFC #EmiratesFACup pic.twitter.com/eEH8xXTnO9\n— Emirates FA Cup (@EmiratesFACup) January 28, 2023\nHe tired as the game went on, unsurprisingly, but his bursts of flair and quick feet were encouraging. “He had very good moments in the first half,” added Silva. “The second half was tough, (especially) the last 10 minutes. He’s getting better in terms of fitness and stamina. He’s different to the other wingers. He’s really strong one-v-one. We can see him improving every day.”\nAs it stands, Solomon looks to have the edge when it comes to a starting spot in the Premier League. That will still not come easily, with Fulham flying and Willian and De Cordova-Reid in form. But increased squad competition can only be a good thing, and Silva will want both pushing for involvement.\nIf they do not, their only dubious incentive will be a midweek replay on Wearside next month. And, for both, this season was supposed to be about so much more.\n(Top photo: Chloe Knott, Danehouse/Getty Images)",
