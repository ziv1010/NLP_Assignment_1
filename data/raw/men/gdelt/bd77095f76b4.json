  "body_text": "Slot: Feyenoord played “perfect match” in 1-0 CL defeat at Lazio\nFeyenoord coach Arie Slot said he has no regrets about the way his team played in Rome despite losing 1-0 down to Lazio, a result that dented their chances of qualifying for the knockout stage of the Champions League.\nCiro Immobile sprung the offside trap and rounded keeper Justin Bijlow on the stroke of half-time in what the home side’s only shot on target in the whole match.\nThe visitors dominated possession but were unable to break through the well organised Italian defence. Feyenoord’s best chance came in the closing seconds when Ayase Ueda’s header from a free-kick was blocked on the goal-line.\n“If I analyse the match I think we played a perfect away game,” Slot said. “We were in control, we had 65% possession and enough chances to score a goal.\n“If we played like them we would lose by four or five. The way we play is our style, it’s the only way that gives us a chance of success.”\nAtlético top group\nMidfielder Calvin Stengs said the team struggled in the first 15 minutes in the hostile Stadio Olimpico, where visiting fans were banned, but conceded a goal at the worst possible moment.\n“Going 1-0 down in the 46th minute is very hard,” he said. “But you make mistakes in football, we knew that if we kept our heads and played our own game the chances would come. We had chances to make it 1-1.”\nThe defeat means Feyenoord surrendered top position in Group E to Atlético de Madrid, who thrashed Celtic 6-0 in Spain, while Lazio moved a point ahead of Slot’s team.\nFeyenoord will still qualify if they win their last two matches, at home to Atlético on November 28 and against Celtic in Glasgow on December 13.\nThank you for donating to DutchNews.nl.\nWe could not provide the Dutch News service, and keep it free of charge, without the generous support of our readers.
