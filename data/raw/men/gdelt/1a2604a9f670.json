  "body_text": "Paddy Davitt delivers his verdict from Austria after Norwich City’s 2-0 win over Toulouse.\n1. Window locked\nDavid Wagner was unequivocal after this friendly that debutant goalscorer Christian Fassnacht could be his last piece in the transfer jigsaw.\nWagner declared himself ‘pleased with the squad’ and reiterated from this point, with over a month left in the summer trading window, he only expects a further addition should there be exits.\nOr rather one exit. The feeling you get from those inside the camp is there may be suitors willing to show their hand for centre back Andrew Omobamidele.\nThat would clearly require a replacement sourced from the market, given the injuries to Grant Hanley and Jonathan Tomkinson. But should either of Max Aarons or Milot Rashica also depart it would seem alternatives are already in the building.\nThere may, of course, be some housekeeping in terms of loans for fringe or younger players.\nMaybe even a loan or two incoming, if unforeseen injuries alter the dynamic once the real business of Championship combat gets underway with Hull City’s visit to Carrow Road on August 5. But there will be no late flurry.\nStuart Webber’s round of post-season interviews hinted at the bulk of the club's transfer activity being completed by the time Wagner and his players embarked on part one of their European tour to Germany.\nWith the final chapter reaching a conclusion, ahead of Friday’s return to England, it would seem a successful conclusion to a lengthy pursuit of Fassnacht marks the last act.\nHow that plays with sections of the City fan base may entirely depend on whether Norwich hit the ground running when league points are at stake.\n2. Catching the eye, Kellen\nWagner’s first public utterance on the topic of Bali Mumba, and why he sanctioned his recent departure to Plymouth on a permanent deal, was both fascinating and enlightening. There was two parts to the Norwich chief’s answer.\nMumba wanted the move, and feels he is best suited to a wing back role that amplifies his attacking instincts and may, in truth, help mask some of the defensive deficiencies and concerns Wagner himself outlined after the early King’s Lynn friendly.\nWith Jack Stacey and Aarons, for now, still in the building, Mumba’s opportunities in an unaccustomed full back role looked severely limited.\nBut perhaps Kellen Fisher’s emergence in pre-season proved the deciding factor.\nWagner candidly admitted had Aarons not been on England Under-21 duty this summer, Fisher may have remained with the development pool.\nBut the City chief was open to fast-tracking him into his senior plans, and has been pleasantly surprised by a seamless transition and the maturity he has shown to step up from non league Bromley.\nThere was another demonstration of Fisher's composure and his self-belief against the French cup winners.\nThe teenager's combative athleticism, and his technical ability on the ball, were again evident. There was no doubt he looked closer to the finished article than Mumba, on the close season evidence, and far better equipped to challenge Stacey, should Aarons move on in these coming weeks.\n3. Flying Fassnacht\nA Swiss international with Champions League experience, and a serial title winner at Young Boys.\nA player still in his 20s with an impressive volume of goals and assists last season to suggest he can inject some dynamism into Norwich’s laboured play in the final third.\nCertainly that drab Championship tailspin down the stretch last season once Kieran Dowell was ruled out through injury.\nFassnacht took all of 15 minutes of a debut tour to pin his marker and powerfully head home Gabby Sara’s deep corner.\nNot bad for a player who Wagner conceded was still learning the names of his new pals, and was unable to train with his team mates during a hectic Sunday and Monday of medicals, paperwork and travel.\nFassnacht started the weekend in line to feature for Young Boys in their opening Swiss Super League game. He finished it criss-crossing Europe to fit in a London medical and then a detour to Austria.\nThe 29-year-old was scheduled to head back to England later on Tuesday, due to visa requirements, before returning to Austria for the final two days of camp and then back to his new home.\nLife must be a blur at present for a player who seemingly possesses the physical attributes to match the aerial threat and eye for goal that should embellish Norwich’s Championship output.\nIf indeed Wagner was the main pull for Fassnacht in swapping Switzerland for NR1, then the City boss could have pulled off a masterstroke.\n4. Sara salute\nIf Fassnacht, for now, is bracketed in terms of potential at Norwich then Sara looks the finished article.\nHis influence on this City side was underlined graphically again when he made his first appearance of the summer for the final 40 minute segment in Kufstein.\nA game meandering to a stalemate was sparked into life with the Brazilian’s quality at two set pieces. The first was a hanging corner despatched by Fassnacht.\nBut the match-clinching second was another demonstration of that 'cut above' class he exudes. Christos Tzolis was used as a decoy for Sara to bend an inswinging free kick with such velocity it was past the keeper before he had a chance to fully extend himself.\nThat ability to produce something out of nothing, with an devastating individual intervention, is what sets Sara apart from not only the rest of this Norwich squad – perhaps with the exception of the inconsistent Marcelino Nunez – but the Championship as a whole.\nWebber started the summer with an admission the Brazilian midfielder was attracting admiring glances from higher up the food chain. That was hardly a surprise given his showreel of goals from a debut season which got stronger as he got to grips with the unique demands of English football.\nBut Sara himself made it clear in an interview with ESPN Brasil he is loving life in green and yellow, and wants to get to the Premier League with Norwich.\nWith or without the club who brought him to Europe there can be little doubt Sara is Premier League-bound. Enjoy him while he remains at Carrow Road.\nOur correspondents are out in Austria for the latest leg of Norwich City's pre-season tour in association with Cavell Healthcare.",
