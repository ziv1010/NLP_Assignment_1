  "body_text": "Real Madrid are reportedly preparing a bid to sign one of Tottenham’s emerging stars.\nYang Min-hyeok, who signed for the Premier League side in the summer of 2024, has yet to make a competitive appearance for Tottenham, having spent his time on loan to gain experience.\nDespite this, the European champions have seemingly seen enough potential to launch an early swoop for the teenager.\nReal Madrid are monitoring Yang Min-hyeok\nAccording to a report by Spanish outlet Defensa Central, Real Madrid have been closely tracking Yang’s progress and are formulating a strategy to convince Tottenham to sell.\nThe report suggests that Los Blancos view the transfer as a low-risk, high-reward investment for the future.\nThe La Liga giants are reportedly willing to offer an initial fee of approximately £4.4m (€5m), with a further £1.8m (€2m) available in performance-related add-ons.\nThe proposed roadmap for the ‘very impressive‘ Tottenham starlet involves an initial stint with Real Madrid Castilla, the club’s reserve team, to help him adapt to Spanish football and the club’s philosophy.\nReal Madrid scouts believe his technical profile fits their long-term vision, and the plan would see him progress into the first-team set-up once he has adapted to life in Madrid.\nTransfers between Real Madrid and Tottenham in the past\nIf Real Madrid sign the youngster, Yang would join a prestigious list of players who have swapped North London for the Spanish capital.\nThe relationship between the two clubs has been defined by blockbuster transfers that shaped Real Madrid’s modern history.\nIn 2012, Luka Modrić joined from Tottenham and went on to become a Ballon d’Or winner and one of the club’s greatest midfielders.\nA year later, Spurs sanctioned the sale of Gareth Bale for a then-world-record fee, with the Welshman delivering iconic goals and decisive moments in multiple Champions League triumphs.",
