  "body_text": "Mikel Arteta and William Saliba have both defended David Raya after the goalkeeper’s errant pass led to Lens’ first goal in their surprise Champions League victory over the north Londoners on Tuesday night.\nThe Gunners took the lead against the Ligue 1 side through Gabriel Jesus but were pegged back by an excellent finish from Adrien Thomasson before Bukayo Saka was forced off with an injury shortly before half-time.\nAlthough Arsenal dominated the contest, it was Lens who claimed all three points after the lively Elye Wahi swept home following a flowing move to secure a 2-1 victory.\nLens’ first-half equaliser came about after some sloppy play from Raya, whose floated pass out to the wing was picked off by Deiver Machado; the left wing-back fed Wahi, who brilliantly flicked the ball to Thomasson to curl the ball home.\nRaya was brought into the team to provide better distribution than previous undisputed number one Aaron Ramsdale but Arteta played down the error afterwards and says it is a byproduct of trying to play out from the back.\nAsked about his goalkeeper’s distribution error, Arteta told TNT Sports: ‘But this happens. Mistakes are part of football and they will continue to be there somehow.\n‘But I think the difference was made in both boxes today. Especially in the Champions League, you don’t generate 10 clear-cut chances in the Champions League. When you get there you have to put the ball in the back of the net. And we have to defend our box much better than we have done.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

I think today we had most control, especially after the first goal, and then when we were dominating we had two big chances to score before them.\nMore Trending\n‘And then the game turned around in that situation when they played around us and we defended the box really poorly.\n‘But it’s what happens. Big teams punish you. Today we didn’t punish them like we punished PSV and that was the difference in the game.’\nCentre-back William Saliba also defended Raya and said the first goal was the collective responsibility of the whole team.\nAsked if the first goal was a drawback of the way Arsenal play with Raya between the sticks, the Frenchman said: ‘So yeah, it’s part of the game. We all make the mistake, so we are all together on this. Of course we conceded two goals so it’s not happy.’\nMORE: Martin Keown and Michael Owen criticise ‘sluggish’ Arsenal star in Lens defeat\nMORE: Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta provides Bukayo Saka injury update after winger limps off against Lens\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
