The Wolverhampton Wanderers star is eager to join United even if they fail to win the Europa League and do not have Champions League football next season.\nAs per Fabrizio Romano, contract talks with Cunha are at the ‘final’ stages. Once they are complete, United can activate his £62.5m (€73.5m / $84m) release clause.\nThe Brazilian is expected to operate as one of Ruben Amorim’s two No 10s behind their main striker.\nAccording to Football Insider, United are ‘ready to sign an out-and-out striker’ once Cunha has arrived at Old Trafford.\n‘The Red Devils have set their sights on a stunning double deal’ as they look to improve their struggling attack and replace the under-fire Rasmus Hojlund up front.\nWhile the report does not name the player United are specifically chasing, that man is widely understood to be Liam Delap of Ipswich Town.\nIndeed, it emerged on April 10 that United have made Delap – who has been called a ‘beast’ by his Ipswich team-mate Jens Cajuste – their No 1 striker target.\nThey have placed him at the top of their wish list, ahead of other top strikers such as Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen.\nWriting on X, formerly Twitter, our transfer insider Ben Jacobs confirmed on Tuesday that Delap’s £30million (€35m / $40m) relegation exit clause ‘is now active’.\nUnlike Cunha, Delap ‘is expected to prioritise European football’. As such, he is ‘likely to wait and see’ if United win the Europa League before agreeing to join.\nREAD MORE 👇\nMan Utd handed HUGE Harry Kane update amid exit clause price drop\nMan Utd to submit ‘formal offer’ to sign 32-year-old icon\nMan Utd target Liam Delap makes decision\nIt is ‘still likely to be a quick transfer’, as all of Delap’s suitors are ready to activate his bargain release clause.\nThe Englishman is ‘expected to pick his next club before heading off to the U21 Euros’, which will start on June 11.\nIt recently emerged that United are ‘leading the race’ for Delap’s services. Even if they qualify for the Champions League though, they need to watch out for other clubs.\nJacobs has confirmed that Newcastle are also ‘keen’, while Bayer Leverkusen and RB Leipzig have ‘made enquiries’, too.\nChelsea are ready to battle United all the way for Delap’s signing, having made him a key target as well.\nBut it is ‘unclear’ if Delap will play for England at the U21 Euros or for Chelsea at the Club World Cup, should Enzo Maresca’s side hijack United’s swoop for him.\nMan Utd transfers: ‘Serious interest’; striker alternative\nMeanwhile, sources have informed TEAMtalk that United hold ‘serious interest’ in a coveted Argentine starlet also wanted by Real Madrid.\nShould United be beaten to Delap, then they could turn their attention to a ‘nightmare’ striker.\nHe is thought to be ‘keen’ on joining Amorim’s side after fresh ‘contact’ was made.",
