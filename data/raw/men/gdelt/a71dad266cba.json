It is unbelievable,” Guardiola said after Man City thrashed Real Madrid 4-0 in the Champions League semi-final second-leg tie at the Etihad Stadium.\nSince leaving Barcelona over a decade, Guardiola has never been able to win the Champions League again despite managing Bayern Munich in the past and now Manchester City so far.\nDAILY POST reports it remains to be seen when Guardiola, who is considered by many to be one of the greatest managers of all time as judged by the success he has achieved at every stop in his managerial career, might finally break his 11-year Champions League jinx.\nGuardiola has reached the Champions League final on three occasions in the past – twice with his Barcelona side when he lifted the trophy and once with Manchester City in 2021.\nWhen asked to give his thoughts about Guardiola after the Spaniard led his team to the Champions League final, Engr. Audu Ojo, the head coach of Dawaki Rangers, told DAILY POST that the Man City boss is one of the best managers in football.\nHe also congratulated him for reaching the Champions League final and praised him for the excellent game plan he adopted against Madrid.\n“First and foremost, let me say congratulations to Guardiola for reaching the Champions League final.\n“He showed that he was one of the best managers in the world when he led Man City to beat Real Madrid 4-0. His game plan against Madrid was excellent,” Ojo told DAILY POST.\nAsked if Guardiola can finally break his 11-year Champions League jinx and to give his prediction for the Champions League final between the two teams, Ojo added, “I believe Guardiola had experience against Italian teams when he was the manager of Barcelona.\n“However, this current Inter Milan side are formidable as they boost the likes of [Lautauro] Martinez [Romelu] Lukaku and [Edin] Dzeko, who can upset any defence.\n“I believe if Guardiola can improve on his game plan against Madrid when Man City face Inter, he might just finally win his first Champions League trophy with City.\n“But Inter will not make it easy for him as they will give them a run for their money. I think the match will be a close game with City having a little edge over Inter.”",
