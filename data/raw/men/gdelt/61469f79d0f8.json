They were cruising in the first half, but the script flipped completely when left-back Theo Hernandez was dismissed early in the second.\nTheo, who picked up a needless yellow card before the interval, was shown a second for diving in the 51st minute, and that act of simulation ultimately cost Milan. They failed to cope with the numerical disadvantage and Feyenoord took control of the game beautifully, eventually grabbing the goal they needed to win this tie on aggregate.\nIt was a foolish decision from Theo to try and deceive the official, and he was made to pay as he watched his side slip out of Europe's top competition.\nBrugge's perfect smash-and-grab\nAtalanta play some beautiful football at time, but last year's Europa League winners won't be celebrating any intercontinental silverware this year after coming out on the wrong end of a goal fest in Bergamo.\nWith a 2-1 advantage in their back pocket, Brugge were more than happy to sit back and frustrate Atalanta who, for all their possession, found clear-cut chances incredibly hard to come by in the first half. They were 3-0 down at the interval and the outcome looked set.\nHalf-time substitute Ademola Lookman looked determined to change the narrative as he scored within seconds of the restart, but his missed penalty on the hour mark sucked the wind out of Atalanta. Rafael Toloi's late red card was the bitter icing on top of the miserable cake.\nMiss of the season contender costs Monaco\nThere was a good, old-fashioned battle between Benfica and Monaco, with the Portuguese side emerging victorious after a 3-3 draw on the night secured a 4-3 aggregate victory.\nMonaco were on top on the first half and could have scored a handful of goals, with the dangerous Breel Embolo missing an excellent chance in truly sublime fashion. Given decent space inside the Benfica box, Embolo somehow managed to send his effort ballooning way over the bar, reaching the sort of altitude most would struggle to break even when trying.\nThe French side twice put themselves ahead in the second half but Benfica simply did not lie down. Vangelis Pavlidis's penalty tied things up at 2-2 on the night and, after George Ilenikhena thought he had set up extra-time, Orkun Kokcu netted with six minutes remaining to bring an electric encounter to an end.\nEarly profligacy proves fatal for gutsy Celtic\nDespite being the underdogs, Celtic did not hide away from Bayern and could have turned their tie on its head had they taken any of their three excellent chances early in the game. Callum McGregor, Nicolas Kuhn and Daizen Maeda could have all been celebrating with a little more fortune.\nBayern took control of the second half and Celtic had to sit incredibly deep to try and absorb the pressure, knowing a counter-attack was likely to be their only chance of survival in this competition. That golden chance was handed to them on the hour mark as Kuhn danced beyond some woeful defending to put Celtic ahead on the night.\nCeltic dug deep, desperate to secure the famous victory their spirited performance undoubtedly merited, but their resolute back line was finally breached in the the ugliest of fashions as Alphonso Davies bundled home in the fourth minute of stoppage time.\nIt's true heartbreak for Celtic, who deserve to be celebrating what was ultimately a truly impressive draw away at Bayern.",
