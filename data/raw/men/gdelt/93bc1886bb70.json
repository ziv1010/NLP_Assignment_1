Maybe it took too much out of them?\nEddie did not look too happy on the sideline, but lets move on from this difficult start to the season (for lots of reasons) and all join back together on the 13th, with a refreshed team raring to go again.’\nGToon:\n‘A difficult watch but at least we didn’t lose.\nBruno was amazing on Monday but well marked by Longstaff today.\nThe game was pretty poor but I thought individually the lads played well.\nJust missing a goal scorer.\nPope did well today too.\nAn interesting couple of days lie ahead…’\nBilly Miller:\n‘A game with little going on.\nGot into some decent positions but no proper opportunities.\nFor me, the season starts at the end of the international break.\nThe transfer window will be closed, so we’ll know our squad and can move forward one way or another.\nIsak has derailed our August and, if he’s still a Newcastle player when he comes back from Sweden, he’s got a huge job on to repay everybody.’\nMatt Busby said…:\n‘Does Expected Goals tell the real story? Probably.\nLeeds United are dreadful.\nNewcastle United the better team but toothless.\nUnbeaten on the road and we haven’t conceded is probably the best I can muster having sat through that.\nWe could be in the relegation zone after tomorrow’s matches!’\nTony Mallabar:\n‘Well, on the way down, it’s got to be the quietest away coach I’ve ever been on.\nAs all the lads were on their phones trying to book planes, trains and coaches for our Champions League adventures.\nUnfortunately, after that display there ain’t going to be any European football in the 26/27 season.\nTo put this into context, there was no lack of effort, but a distinct lack of cutting edge up top.\nHopefully, come 7.01pm Monday night this will have been put right.’\nDavid Punton:\n‘A really poor game that we laboured through, with no cutting edge up front.\nIt was a hard one to watch.\nThis is what you get when you don’t have strikers signed in time for the start of the season.\nIt was a drab encounter. There was little to inspire, save for the fact we emerged with a point instead of none.\nOur new German striker Nick Woltemade can’t come into the team quick enough, we also need someone else to fill the number nine shirt. The clock is ticking.\nAt least we had a clean sheet but the formation deployed by Howe was a surprise.\nWe need to see way more from Barnes and Elanga.\nMonday’s heartbreak game against Liverpool may have left a slight hangover.’\nMark Jankwski:\n‘Newcastle made a tweak to their formation today and while we were able to keep Leeds very quiet, the shift in tactics also stifled us.\nCredit must be given to Leeds’ effort in frustrating any attempts we made to play down the wing but, we’ll have to improve against teams that sit in like that, or there’ll be more frustrating afternoons on the horizon.’\nGreg McPeake:\n‘So much for the Leeds 12th man atmosphere.\nGame we could have won and should have won but just felt flat.\nHaven’t asked my teenage son’s opinion in case I upset the experts.\nDisappointing game and disappointing result but early days, so as the new lad with the tash looked on from the directors box, let’s hope he makes the difference.’\nLeeds 0 Newcastle 0 – Saturday 30 August 2025 5.30pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nLeeds\nPossession was Newcastle 57% Leeds 43%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 8 Leeds 10\nShots on target were Newcastle 2 Leeds 1\nCorners were Newcastle 5 Leeds 5\nTouches in the box Newcastle 13 Leeds 19\nNewcastle team v Leeds:\nPope, Trippier (Hall 61), Schar, Botman (Barnes 69), Burn, Livramento, Tonali, Bruno, Ramsey (Miley 46), Jacob Murphy (Elanga 62), Osula\nUnused subs:\nRamsdale, Lascelles, Thiaw, Krafth, Willock\n(Thud and blunder… Leeds 0 Newcastle 0 – Read HERE)\nNewcastle United upcoming match schedule:\nSaturday 13 September – Newcastle v Wolves (3pm)\nThursday 18th September: Newcastle United vs FC Barcelona (kick-off 8pm BST)\nSaturday 20 September – Bournemouth v Newcastle (3pm) (set to be changed now due to Barcelona)\nW/C Monday 22 September – Newcastle v Bradford (Carabao Cup)\nSunday 28 September– Newcastle v Arsenal (4.30pm) Sky Sports\nWednesday 1st October: Union SG vs Newcastle United (kick-off 7:45pm BST)\nSunday 5 October– Newcastle v Forest (2pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 18 October – Brighton v Newcastle (3pm)\nTuesday 21st October: Newcastle United vs Benfica (kick-off 8pm BST)\nSaturday 25 October– Newcastle v Fulham (3pm)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
