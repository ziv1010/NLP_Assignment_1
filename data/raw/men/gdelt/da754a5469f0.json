But while Liverpool allowed Slot to put his own stamp on the side during the summer, his mammoth £440m (€505m, $600m) squad investment is yet to pay serious dividends.\nIndeed, instead of the trophy dynasty Liverpool hoped they would create by signing the likes of Florian Wirtz, Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike in mega-money deals, the club has actually gone backwards.\nAnd a woeful run of form over the autumn, in which the Reds lost nine times in 12 games across all competitions, seriously ramped up the pressure on Slot’s shoulders.\nSince then, though, Liverpool have gone unbeaten in nine games, though two draws against Leeds, one at home to Sunderland and, most recently, at Fulham on Sunday, is indicative of a side well below their best.\nAs a result, speculation on Slot’s future has gathered serious pace once again this week and, ahead of Thursday night’s clash at table-toppers, Arsenal, reports in Spain claim Liverpool are ready to dispense with the Dutchman’s services ‘this week’, with their board allegedly ‘fed up’ of their poor results and ongoing mistakes.\nNow, a fresh menacing report from Spain, as relayed by Football365, claims that Real Madrid head coach Alonso, who is under pressure at the Bernabeu, ‘has a preliminary agreement with Liverpool to become their new manager.’\nAnd amid claims Alonso could be dismissed if Real lose their Spanish Super Cup semi-final to Atletico Madrid on Thursday in Saudi Arabia, the report adds that Liverpool are ‘keeping a close eye on the situation’ and are ‘convinced his tenure will not be long-lasting’.\nFurthermore, it’s claimed the Reds see Alonso as ‘fitting in perfectly with their football philosophy’.\nAnd while the intensity of the job at the Bernabeu has seen Alonso put under early pressure, that does not necessarily equate to an immediate move to Anfield….\nWant breaking transfer lines from original sources?

So things to like, but the result is, again, not what we may deserve, question mark.”\nAs for Alonso, he has never hidden from his admiration for his former club, but insists his focus remains on Real Madrid.\nSpeaking last month, he openly admitted that a return to Anfield could be on the agenda at some point in the future.\nAsked if he would consider a return to English football, he revealed: “Well, for sure.\n“There’s this bond with the English clubs, for sure with my former club, but at the moment this is my place. This is where I want to be.\n“In the future, you never know what could happen.”\nLatest Liverpool news: Stunning Semenyo hijack? Burnley defender signs up\nMeanwhile, stunning claims suggest Liverpool are not out of the race to sign Antoine Semenyo just yet and are on course to hijack Manchester City’s agreement, according to Jamie Redknapp, while TEAMtalk can dissect what would happen were the Reds to make a concrete move.\nElsewhere, as Liverpool continue to maintain their interest in Marc Guehi despite Manchester City stepping up their pursuit of the Crystal Palace star, another defender has announced that he is moving to Anfield in the January transfer window after confirmation that he would be leaving Burnley.\nAnd finally, Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Liverpool may not be able to bring Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace to Anfield in the January transfer window, while Slot has addressed the situation of Harvey Elliott, who is struggling to make an impact at Aston Villa.",
