It is pure folly now after a couple of familiar failings reared their head at the Stadium of Light on Sunday, before City laid down an emphatic marker against Liverpool. City have hunted down the Gunners from less promising positions in the past and although the personnel might be different, Arsenal’s failure to go course and distance in the past is likely to haunt them until they finally get over the line. Nothing about City’s recent form suggests they’re going to give them an easy ride.\nCity’s wing wizards\nWhile they’ve still got to go some to emulate some of their illustrious predecessors, there’s definitely shades of Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling about the current City widemen. Jeremy Doku gave Conor Bradley an infinitesimally more testing time than Vinicius Jnr in midweek and his electric dribbling style now, more frequently than not, culminates in end product. On the opposite flank, Rayan Cherki’s magnetic first touch and inventiveness neatly complimented the qualities of those around him before he was withdrawn early in the second period.\nNico shows why he’s been called up by England\nEngland’s left-back position is certainly up for grabs given the number of options Thomas Tuchel has experimented with over the course of his tenure. Myles Lewis-Skelly’s relative inactivity for Arsenal has handed an opportunity to Nico O’Reilly and it’s one the City youngster looks primed to take. Tasked with taming Mohamed Salah, the 20-year-old hardly gave Liverpool’s talisman an inch and his poise on the ball, a pre-requisite for any City player in Pep Guardiola’s system, helped his side navigate its way out of several tight spots and spring dangerous attacks.\nWirtz ghosts again\nDoku’s improvement this season and man of the match display served as a timely remind that it is still way too soon to write off one of Liverpool’s two headline summer signings, but this was another concerning performance. So infrequent was his involvement in the game that it was difficult to determine the role he had been assigned. Either way, he looks ill at ease with the playmaking responsibilities he has presumably been charged with, no matter which combination of midfielders and forwards Arne Slot selects. Lightweight, indecisive and short on confidence, Wirtz and his manager have major issues to solve.\nThat’s all from us!\nThanks for joining our live blog today – stay with Metro for all the best reaction to this game and more!\nSlot makes worrying title claim\nLiverpool head coach Arne Slot has made a worrying claim about the Premier League title race.\nClick the link below for the full story…\nVan Dijk sends message to Arsenal\nVirgil van Dijk insists Liverpool are ‘not going to give up’ on retaining the title and says they are ‘ready’ for a ‘big fight’ with Arsenal and Manchester City for the Premier League trophy.\nNeville slams Liverpool star after ‘really worrying’ loss\nClick the link below to read what Gary Neville had to say about today’s game…\nLiverpool’s worrying season continues\nLiverpool have lost five of their 11 matches in the Premier League this season, the most defeats by a reigning champion at this stage of a campaign since Leicester in 2016-17.\nOnly Chelsea in 2015-16 (six) have ever lost more after 11 games of a Premier League season as reigning champions.\nHow is the Premier League table looking now?\nMan City look to be the main challengers for Arsenal this season, moving up to second and closing the gap to four points.\nLiverpool are eighth – below Manchester United – after today’s loss.\nKeane rules Liverpool out of the title race\nRoy Keane has declared that Liverpool can no longer be considered Premier League title challengers after today’s defeat.\n‘You can’t be considering Liverpool for the title,’ the Manchester United legend and football pundit told Sky Sports.\n‘That was a sore defeat.
