  "body_text": "Darwin Nunez has been patient for game time this season and Diogo Jota’s injury has opened the door for more minutes for our No.9.\nThe Uruguayan has repaid his head coach’s faith in his ability with solid performances in our last few games and an assist for Mo Salah’s late equaliser against Arsenal will do his chances of more opportunities no harm.\nIt was what the 25-year-old did after the Egyptian King’s finish that will win over our fans even more, as cameras in the crowd captured what he did.\nThe striker ran to the travelling Kop and passionately thumped the Liver Bird upon his chest, showing how much the club means to him.\nVOTE for Empire of the Kop as Best Club Content Creator (Premier League) here: Football Content Awards\nOR on X with the FCA’s one-click X link with:\nI am voting for @empireofthekop in @The_FCAs for #BestClubContentCreator (Premier League)\nArne Slot has handed Darwin Nunez a chance to shine\nFollowing on from a Champions League goal against Leipzig, you can see that the former Benfica man is enjoying his football at the moment and long may this last.\nWhat we’ve seen under Arne Slot is more defensive responsibility for the forward and he’s thrived in being able to utilise his physicality and thus being more involved in the game.\nThis then means that he’s sharper and more ready for any attacking chances that come his way, something we’ve seen in our last two matches with goals and assists.\nWe all know there’s a great player in our club record signing, it’s just about finding a way to get consistent performances and making him as confident as possible so that he can be the best version of himself.\nYou can watch Nunez’s celebration via @drwnunez on X:\ndarwin tapping the liverpool’s crest 🤍 pic.twitter.com/1tEQg3NmfU\n— hae (@drwnunez) October 27, 2024\nArne Slot’s Liverpool reign is about to be turbocharged as Reds enter rollercoaster fixture sequence",
