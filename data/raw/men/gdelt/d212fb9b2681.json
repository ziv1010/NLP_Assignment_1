Indeed, he has six goals and two assists from 14 starts in LaLiga, becoming a fixture in Carlos Carvalhal’s side.\nHis displays in the middle of the park have seen Veiga earn comparisons to Barcelona legend Andres Iniesta.\nIndeed, the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid are both reportedly on his trail.\nBut there is interest from further afield too, with Newcastle, Arsenal and Manchester United also on his trail.\nAccording to AS, though, the strongest interest is likely to come from Manchester United. And it seems Erik ten Hag is readying an approach to prise Celta to part ways with Veiga.\nPer the report, the LaLiga side are looking for a fee in the region of £31m (€35m) for Veiga. And an offer for around that would leave them little choice but to cash in. Indeed, that would comfortably shatter the club’s record for record transfer fee received, currently standing at the €21m paid by Napoli for Stanislav Labotka.\nTen Hag is looking to take his United rebuilding on to the next level with new midfielders in his sights. And Ben Jacobs told TEAMtalk that two midfielders could be among the summer exits with Donny van de Beek and Scott McTominay seemingly up for sale.\nARSENAL EYE SUMMER SWOOP FOR NICO WILLIAMS\nArsenal are looking to make a summer raid on Athletic Bilbao for Nico Williams, according to a report.\nDespite the winter addition of Leandro Trossard, Mikel Arteta still hopes to bring in another winger this summer. And with the Gunners looking to go deep in both the title race and the Champions League, Arteta wants some quality options at his disposal.\nAnd while Trossard provides excellent cover for Gabriel Martinelli on the left, Arsenal want a top-quality star to compete with Bukayo Saka on the right.\nAs such, reports in Spain claim they are turning their attention towards Bilbao’s electric winger Williams.\nAlongside his brother Inaki, the Williams brothers have become firm fixtures in the LaLiga side’s team.\nAnd this season, Nico has seven goals and six assists to his name from 27 appearances. He also appeared in all four of Spain’s matches at the 2022 World Cup.\nHis deal with Athletic Club is currently due to expire in summer 2024, putting his future at the Basque side in some doubt.\nHowever, Bilbao are in no mood to sell him on the cheap and are currently pointing clubs towards his £44m (€50m) exit fee.\nThat said, with a year left on his deal there is genuine belief he can be signed for a discounted fee.\nREAD MORE: Arteta gives green light to new Arsenal deal for influential star who has blown away club officials\nWEST HAM LEAD FOUR-CLUB CHASE FOR OLIVIER GIROUD\nAC Milan striker Olivier Giroud could be heading back to the Premier League this summer, according to reports.\nThe veteran frontman will be out of contract at the San Siro and will currently be available on a free. And while Milan are keen to extend the 36-year-old’s stay, it seems the Frenchman is destined to leave.\nAs a result, The Sun claims a return to the Premier League looks to be on the cards. And the former Arsenal and Chelsea striker appears destined to return to the capital with the paper claiming a quartet of London clubs are on his trail.\nThat chase is currently being led by West Ham, while Fulham, Crystal Palace and Brentford are also on his trail.\nThere is interest too from Everton, who saw a January offer for Giroud fail.\nGiroud, a four-times FA Cup winner, has scored seven goals and has four assists for Milan this season.\nAnd there is clearly a belief that he can continue performing at the highest level for another season yet.\nGiroud’s best goalscoring season came in 2015/16 when he notched 24 goals for the Gunners in all competitions.",
