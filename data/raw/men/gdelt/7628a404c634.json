  "body_text": "Didier Deschamps has announced that he will step down as France men’s head coach following the 2026 World Cup in North America.\nDeschamps is one of the longest-serving managers in international football, having been appointed to the role in 2012. He has overseen a successful period with the national team, winning the World Cup in 2018 as France defeated Croatia 4-2 in the final.\nAdvertisement\nHe led the side to a second successive World Cup final in Qatar in December 2022, though his team was defeated on penalties by Argentina after extra-time. The 56-year-old also counts the 2020-21 UEFA Nations League among his list of honours.\n“It’s going to be 2026,” Deschamps told French broadcaster TF1. “I’ve been here since 2012, I’m expected to be here until 2026… the next World Cup. It’ll stop there, because it has to stop at some point. It’s clear in my head.\n“I’ve done my time, with the same desire, the same passion to keep the French team at the highest level, but 2026 is very good.\n“You never want it to end when it’s a beautiful thing, but you have to know how to say stop. There’s a life afterwards, I don’t know what it will be, but it will be very good too.”\nDeschamps began his managerial career with Monaco, before taking over at Juventus for the 2006-07 season, guiding the side back to Serie A after the Calciopoli scandal saw them relegated to Serie B. He returned to Ligue 1 with Marseille in 2009 and spent three seasons with the club.\nAs a player, he won the Champions League with Marseille in 1993 and claimed three Serie A titles with Juventus. Deschamps was capped 103 times by France and captained the team that won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000.\nDeschamps will be looking to go out on a high note by leading France to its third World Cup next year. The tournament will be hosted across three countries — the United States, Canada and Mexico — and will feature 48 nations for the first time.\nGO DEEPER\nFrance fell flat at Euro 2024 - so why is Deschamps set to stay as manager?\nIs Deschamps’ decision a surprise?\nAfter France’s exit at Euro 2024 in which they were criticised for playing, in the words of then-vice-captain Antoine Griezmann, “boring” football, there was a question to be asked: will Deschamps stay?\nHis response was prickly. “Ask my president… I’ve just lost a semi-final. Do you think I’m going to answer already?” said Deschamps immediately after the semi-final defeat.\nAdvertisement\nThe answer from the French Football Federation (FFF) president Phillipe Diallo, somewhat surprisingly to an international audience but less so for the French, was a resounding yes, Deschamps was not going anywhere.\nThe timing is a surprise. Why not announce your decision after the Euros? Why announce it 18 months in advance? It will be a year and a half of the Deschamps farewell tour, all the way up to the World Cup and Deschamps will not want to distract attention from the team.\nIn any case, Deschamps has realised that 14 years in post is a very long time, too long. But he is stepping away on his own terms and that is satisfying.\nFrench legend Zinedine Zidane is the name on everyone’s lips to replace the 56-year-old. He is still without a job after leaving Real Madrid in 2021 and it would be a Hollywood script if he were appointed but he would have to wait for another 18 months.\n(Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)",
