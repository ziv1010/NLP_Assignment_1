Because if he doesn't play, Pedro Neto plays wide in his position. And Pedro is good. And we are happy with Pedro. We try just to defend the game plan, we use 11 players,” Maresca continued.\n“Tonight we decided, probably in the most difficult game of the season, we decided to play with Estevao. So I'm not a manager that I don't allow players to play minutes.\n“It's just the game plan. The game plan always decides the first 11. It's the reason why we changed so much. And you say that we are unpredictable. But it's the game plan. The game plan defines the first 11.\n“Now the next one is Arsenal. The game plan is not always good, sometimes it's also wrong. It defines the first 11. And Estevao, when the game plan is for him, he's going to play. And for sure he's going to play many games because he's very good.”",
