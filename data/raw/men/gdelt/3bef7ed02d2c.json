  "body_text": "It's official. The New Year Honours list has dropped for 2025, and there is a whole host of well-deserving famous faces who are being recognised at the end of this year. This list is part of the British honours system, which recognises people across the UK (and some Commonwealth realms) from all walks of life, from acting to sports and charity work, for outstanding service and achievement.\nAhead of New Year's Day, a host of names are announced with an honour attached. These honours range from Knighthoods, Damehoods, as well as Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), and Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE).\nThe New Year Honours list is decided by an independent honours committee of experts and civil servants who review nominations from the public and government before recommending candidates to the prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer. The PM will then forward the list to King Charles for final approval.\nOf the 2025 line-up, Sir Keir Starmer said: \"This year’s Honours list celebrates the very best of Britain – people who put the common good ahead of themselves to strengthen communities and change lives.\n\"Their quiet dedication speaks to the decent, compassionate country we are proud to be. On behalf of the whole nation, thank you – and congratulations to everyone recognised today.\"\nTo meet the stars receiving honours in 2025, keep scrolling…\nHelen Mark\nHelen Mark has said she is \"thrilled\" to be made an MBE. The Scottish broadcaster presents BBC's Open Country and the Ulster-Scots programme Kintra.\nShe told Press Association: \"The letter came in a very posh envelope, you know, really good paper. And you open it up, and I said to my husband: 'What's this?' I thought it was a summons.\"\nRoy Clarke\nThe British comedy writer Roy Clarke, best known as the creator of sitcoms including Last Of The Summer Wine, Open All Hours and Keeping Up Appearances, will receive a knighthood.\nThe 95-year-old worked alongside titans of the British comedy scene during his career, including David Jason, Ronnie Barker, and the late Patricia Routledge.",
