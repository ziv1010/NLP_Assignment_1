So, we have an idea of what to expect.”\nIn a post-match interview after the first leg, Pasuwa said only wonderkid Patrick Mwaungulu turned on a vintage show and he expects the rest to stand up and be counted if they are to stand the Lubumbashi was awarded.”\nIn its determination, the committee said it has suspended Nkhakananga for failing to control the match by allowing play to continue after blowing his whistle to stop play, continuing play without proper restart, allowing a goal from a dead ball and giving advantage by blowing a whistle.\nHowever, Wanderers board secretary Chancy Gondwe said Nkhakananga deserved severe punishment.\nHe said: “What he did was very irresponsible and scandalous. That referee should be banned for the rest of his life.\n“And what FAM has done is a mockery of justice in football administration.”\nMeanwhile, Zuza Nyondo, who was the match assessor in the match between Karonga United and Chitipa United, has been suspended for four months for poor report writing while Deus Nyirongo, who was the centre referee for the same match, has been suspended for three months for failing to control the game.\nPeter Jossam, who officiated the match between Silver Strikers and Blue Eagles, has also been suspended for three months for the same reasons.\nAnother referee Dave Chomnbo has been suspended for six months for poor knowledge and application of the laws of the game.",
