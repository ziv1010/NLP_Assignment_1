  "body_text": "Press conference'I love it!' - Jürgen Klopp on 'super-important' Arsenal clash\nJürgen Klopp is relishing Liverpool's top-of-the-table clash with Arsenal on Saturday evening and is hoping 'a proper Anfield experience' will be delivered.\nThe Reds welcome the first-placed Gunners to L4 just one point behind them in the standings, meaning the winner of the contest is in line to be in the Premier League's pole position on Christmas Day.\nWith kick-off set for 5.30pm GMT, it promises to be an electrifying tie under the lights – and it's one the manager can't wait for.\nAsked during his pre-match press conference how much he enjoys these kinds of occasions, Klopp joked: \"I love it the most when you are first and 55 points ahead! Then it is a pure joy!\n\"But it's all fine – I love it. It's how I said, we are in the position we are and it's not that bad. We play a super-strong team; we play a team that played an exceptional last season and coming back is even better than last season.\n\"Bringing in top players, they had already a top team, bringing in really good players to improve the team. They did that, went through the Champions League [group stage] pretty easily and played a really good Premier League campaign, so [it's] a massive game.\n\"It's great, great to have them, great to meet them. We met quite frequently, obviously, and it's good but we have to make sure we make it a proper home game, a proper Anfield experience. That's all I want.\"\nArsenal showcased their considerable qualities on their last visit to Anfield back in April when they raced into a two-goal lead through Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus inside the opening half-hour.\nHowever, Liverpool fought back to secure a point in a 2-2 draw as Mohamed Salah netted before half-time and Roberto Firmino headed in a late equaliser.\nQuizzed on the Gunners' title prospects this time around, Klopp replied: \"I thought they looked like that last year, to be honest, then some results kicked in or whatever, I don't know exactly the reasons.\n\"I remember our game here, they were outstanding until we found a way into the game – and then maybe in the end we should have won it. Maybe they had other chances as well, I can't remember them, to be honest, but I can remember Ibou Konate at 2-2 with the chest half a yard in front of the goal... I am still wondering how he couldn't score there. That was the team we faced, a super-strong team.\n\"That's what they are – and you bring in Rice and Havertz and that doesn't make you worse. Raya in goal doesn't make you worse. Mikel built exactly the team he wanted and they are difficult to play. They are a good mix between physicality, like big, strong players, fast, good technique, very good organisation, they are really well-coached, well-drilled. You can see every year they make another step.\n\"They really have my respect but we want the points anyway.\"\nYou have to accept cookies in order to view this content on our site.\nWatch on YouTubeDespite the fixture seeing the Premier League's current top-two sides facing off, Klopp doesn't believe the outcome will have a substantial impact on the outcome of the campaign for either team at this stage.\n\"[It's] matchday 18 – that means after that we play 20 more games, right?\" said the boss. \"If we win it we are not through, if they win it they are not through, even when probably that's then the headlines they have to deal with.\n\"It's just a super-important football game. We were, result-wise, pretty stable this season. That's the basis for everything – it's the basis for consistency, that you get results. We did that. I didn't really think about [what impact the game will have on the season], I couldn't care less. I am just interested in this game tomorrow and not what it means for the rest of the season or whatever.\n\"I spoke the other day about it, I said the position we are in is OK. We don't feel now it is exceptional – 'wow, how did we end up here?' I really think we deserve where we are, but it's just a basis. January, February then it's really getting interesting where you are. Then you might see you play less games than you already played and you see if there is a distance or not. Then there might be a moment, I don't know exactly when, March maybe or April, when you think OK, a six-pointer: win today and you have them out of the way or whatever.\n\"That's obviously far off and nobody thinks about these kind of things. We have enough, believe me, to prepare for a game like this... I enjoy it a lot, but there's no space for left and right. There is enough to do to make sure they cannot do what they want and we can do what we want.\"",
