Weah is the first African former professional footballer to become a head of state.\nRegarded as one of the greatest African players of all time, Weah was named FIFA World Player of the Year and won the Ballon d'Or, becoming the first and only player to win these awards while representing an African country at senior international level.\nWeah won 75 caps with Liberia, netting 18 goals and playing at two AFCONs.\n2) Daniel Amokachi\nAmokachi, nicknamed 'The Bull', is the first player ever to score in the glamorous UEFA Champions League (new format). He made history on November 25, 1992, after his goal for Club Brugge of Belgium secured a 1–0 win in the opening match in the group stage against CSKA Moscow.\nIn 2020, the immediate past president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, appointed the ex-Super Eagles star, as his special assistant on sports.\nAmokachi’s new appointment came about five months after he was initially named Nigeria’s football ambassador by Buhari. He has also served as an aide to former minister of youth and sports, Sunday Dare.\nLegit.ng reports that Amokachi is an open and unapologetic supporter of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) government.\nIn January 2023, prior to the general elections in Nigeria, the former AFCON star branded his Bentley with APC presidential posters, an action that elicited reactions on social media platforms.\nThe 51-year-old began his career with Ranchers Bees Football Club of Kaduna and played for Club Brugge of Belgium, Besiktas of Turkey, Everton of England and Colorado Rapids.\nHe was part of the 1994 squad that won the AFCON in Tunisia and also went on to the World Cup in the United States the same year.\nTwo years later, Amokachi helped Nigeria to the historical gold medal in the football event of the Atlanta 1996 Olympics.\nSince quitting active football, Amokachi has featured as a pundit and also gone into coaching.\nHe has coached the U-23 national team, served as assistant coach of the Super Eagles and coached a handful of Nigerian and foreign clubs also.\n3) Titi Camara\nAboubacar Sidiki \"Titi\" Camara is a Guinean former professional footballer who played as a striker.\nHe was also the coach of the Guinea national team, which he captained and played for. He is best known for his stint with Liverpool in the 1999–2000 season, where he scored 10 goals in 37 games in all competitions, memorably scoring the winner in a game against Arsenal at Highbury.\nOn December 28, 2010, Camara was made sports minister of Guinea by newly elected president Alpha Condé, making him the country's first ex-sportsman to hold a government post. He was forced out of his post on 5 October 2012 in a government reshuffle.\nN30bn for AFCON 2024 top performers\nEarlier, Legit.ng reported that the Confederation of African Football (CAF) is set to pay the winner of the 2024 edition of the AFCON in Cote d'Ivoire $7 million (over N6.70 billion).\nThis is a 40% or $2 million increase when compared to the $5 million received by champions Senegal during the last AFCON.\nAFCON: Osimhen vibes to Wizkid’s song\nLegit.ng also reported that reigning African player of the year, Victor Osimhen, was spotted vibing to a song by Nigeria's music star Wizkid.\nThe video was shared via the Confederation of African Football (CAF's) official X (formerly Twitter) handle.\nYemi Alade lands in Cote d’Ivoire for AFCON\nMeanwhile, popular Nigerian singer, Yemi Alade, will perform at the opening ceremony of the 2023 AFCON in Cote d’Ivoire.\nAlade spoke on the importance of prayer while revealing it has been her long-time desire to perform at a football stadium in the presence of a massive crowd.\nPAY ATTENTION: Unlock the best of Legit.ng on Pinterest!
