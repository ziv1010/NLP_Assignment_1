  "body_text": "Arsenal look to have been handed a huge boost as it now looks like Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins will be available this summer.\nThe Gunners saw a bid turned down for the England international back in January, but his form has dipped since then and he’s lost his place in Unai Emery’s starting line up.\nWatkins has had a fine career in the Premier League, proving himself as an elite goal-scorer at this level, and he’d surely be welcome at the Emirates Stadium.\nAs all Arsenal fans looking into how to buy tickets for Arsenal vs Crystal Palace at the Emirates later this month will be wondering – who will end up being Mikel Arteta’s top target up front this summer?\nIs Ollie Watkins the new striker signing that Arsenal need?\nSome Arsenal fans will likely feel that their club could do better than Watkins, who is now 29 years of age and who has recently gone off the boil.\nOne imagines Watkins could revive his form, but it’s a bit of a gamble for someone who’d likely cost big money and who might only have two or three years left at his best level.\nLiverpool have also been linked with Watkins, as per Football Insider’s report, while Arteta likely has his eye on several other big-name centre-forwards.\nArsenal have also been linked strongly with Benjamin Sesko, while one imagines the likes of Alexander Isak, Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres will also be names to watch.\nAFC fans would probably prefer any of those over Watkins right now, even if a January move for the Villa front-man could have been a fine piece of business with a huge impact on the team’s season.\nIt’s been a hugely frustrating campaign of one injury after another for the north London giants, with Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus both out at the moment and unlikely to play again this season.\nMeanwhile, Bukayo Saka has also missed a lot of games and only recently returned, so one imagines a goal threat like Watkins could have made a big difference for the club in this tricky period.\nArsenal recently fell out of the Premier League title race, with draws against the likes of Manchester United, Everton and Brentford likely contributing to Liverpool being able to run away with the title.\nWatkins could have been ideal to break the deadlock in those tight games, but one imagines a younger and more in-form option will be needed for next season.",
