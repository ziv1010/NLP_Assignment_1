  "body_text": "Legends react on Simba, Yanga Groups\nCAIRO: FOOTBALL legends have called on Tanzanian envoys in CAF Interclub Competitions Young Africans and Simba to embrace ample preparations in order to succeed in their group stage matches.\nOn Monday in Cairo, Egypt, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) conducted group stage draw for CAF Champions League (CAF CL) and CAF Confederation Cup (CAF CC) respectively.\nIn Champions League, Yanga have been packed in Group A alongside TP Mazembe (DR Congo), Al Hilal (Sudan) and MC Alger (Algeria).\nIn Confederation Cup, Simba are in group A together with CS Sfaxien (Tunisia), CS Constantine (Algeria) and FC Bravos Do Maquis (Angola).\nHowever, reacting after the draw, former Simba player Abdallah Kibadeni said both Yanga and Simba should prepare well for their group stage matches in order to excel.\n“I have seen their opponents and in my opinion, I think the best way for them is to have ample preparations and work out on their shortcomings which are in their respective teams.\n“Football will forever remain unpredictable game…they should not fear the names of their opponents because football is played on the pitch with eleven players each side.\nALSO READ: Make us proud Stars – Majaliwa\n“The good thing about our two teams is that they have enough exposure of these international matches and their performance is always admirable…I personally believe that they will do well,” he said.\nAlso, former Yanga player Bakari Malima pointed out that both Yanga and Simba should take each game seriously and never underrate any of their opponents.\n“Each team that qualifies in group stage of CAF competitions is to be respected because they did not claim the status by accident but rather, they won games to reach there.\n“I urge them to do their homework well and attract the winning mentality so that they should not rely on winning at home ground only but also aim to record positive results at away venues,” Malima said.\nHowever, in group A of the champions league, TP Mazembe are the most successful team after winning the title 5 times in 1967, 1968, 2009, 2010 and 2015.\nMC Alger won it once in 1976 while Al Hilal have never put hands on the champions league title despite reaching in two finals in 1987 and 1992.\nIn group A of the Confederation Cup, CS Sfaxien have clinched the title three times in 2007, 2008 and 2013 hence they are seeking for a fourth opportunity to grab the lucrative silverware.\nIn 2010, they finished as runners-up to FUS Rabat of Morocco after suffering a 3-2 defeat while in 2012, they were eliminated in the First Round of the competition.\nOn the other hand, CS Constantine are making their maiden appearance in CAF CC group stage though they managed to reach in the quarter-finals of the Champions League in 2019.\nLikewise, the Angolan side FC Bravos are also making their first appearance in the Confederation Cup.",
