  "body_text": "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has suggested that Alejandro Garnacho may have been “trying too much” in an effort to make an impact against Nottingham Forest, which ultimately led to his struggles.\nUnited were beaten 1-0 by Forest at the City Ground on Tuesday night\nAnthony Elanga’s solo effort in the fifth minute was enough to give Forest all three points and boost their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.\nUnited dominated possession and created some chances but ultimately, couldn’t find the equaliser.\nAfter the final whistle, Amorim spoke to reporters in his post-match press conference and gave his verdict on the result and United’s performance.\nAsked whether United deserved more from the game, Amorim replied, “I think that is clear. We created some chances but we could have created more with the possession that we had. We reached the final third a lot of times but we need to be better because it’s really important to score goals and we have a lack of goals.”\n“We started the game by suffering a goal and we put Nottingham Forest in the place they wanted to be: defending with a lot of men and then they have really fast players to make transitions – even that we controlled quite well, especially in the second half.”\n“We pushed forward but then again, in the final third we were not good enough.”\nOn whether Elanga’s goal could have been stopped, Amorim answered, “That is clear. When we have a corner, if you have men to block transitions, you have the whole pitch and you can make a foul…so yeah, if you look at the game and you’re the coach, then you have to do better.”\nOn the late flurry of chances United had, Amorim explained, “Harry Maguire, when he’s attacking set-pieces, is maybe the best player on our team. So inside the box [late into the game], you’re not a defender, you’re a striker.”\nSo that was the idea…to put one man in the box who’s really good, to score a goal.”\nAsked about Garnacho, who endured a difficult game, Amorim said, “He’s making everything. He’s trying and sometimes you have one day when you’re doing the right things but in the final third, we were not that good. That can happen.”\nThe United head coach added, “That can happen during the game [Garnacho doing too much to try and get back into good form]. The most important thing for me is when he needs to run back, he’s running back. Of course we want a player who gets into one vs. one situations. Sometimes he’s trying too much to make a movement but I think he wants to help the team and he’s doing his best.”\n“Sometimes he doesn’t make the best choice but you can point to any player today.”\nAsked whether it’s a concern that Maguire appeared to be more of a threat compared to United’s strikers, Amorim remarked, “No [it’s not a concern]. It depends on the characteristics. Again, Forest were playing with [a defensive] line of six and then it’s also a matter of size and the way you have the ability to have a ball. So I don’t see it that way.”\n“That can happen with any team with the best strikers in the world, the defenders sometimes are the best to attack the ball inside the box and Harry was really good at that.”\nOn Elanga and whether it hurts seeing him performing for another team, Amorim told reporters, “We are talking about a lot of front players for Manchester United that are doing right but they had the chance here.”\n“At Manchester United you don’t have the time. I will not have the time. We have to get it right fast.”\n“You are not talking about players that didn’t play for Manchester United, they were here playing for Manchester United. In here the pressure is too big sometimes and sometimes you don’t get time and you should have time for these kids to develop.”\n“But for that you need a strong base to support all these kids and if you don’t have strong base we are not going to help our kids. They had their chances and sometimes football is like that and the pressure of playing for Manchester United is really big.”\nUnited are back in action on Sunday when they host cross-town rivals Manchester City at Old Trafford.\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
