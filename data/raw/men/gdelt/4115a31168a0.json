United would initially receive £16 million, as all clubs who begin the 32 team league stage are awarded this sum.\nThey would also receive money from UEFA’s “value pillar”, which sees clubs paid money for their previous performances in the Champions League.\nRuben Amorim’s side would also stand to make substantial figures from the four home games they would play as part of the league stage.\nThe club could expect to make something in the region of £21 million from their matches at Old Trafford next season were they to qualify.\nAdding these figures to the Europa League prize money means that success in Bilbao guarantees United will have made £121 million from this season’s European odyssey.\nThese earnings and projected revenue could be crucial in the rebuild that Amorim wants to carry out this summer.\nUnited will certainly make signings this upcoming window regardless of whether they win the Europa League or not. Nonetheless, an extra £121 million in the kitty would transform their summer plans dramatically.\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
