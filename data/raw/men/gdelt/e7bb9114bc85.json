Van de Ven and Romero, the cover that they need. Dragusin has come in and we’ve not really seen much of him.\n“With Van de Ven’s injury record, and Romero’s injury record and suspensions, we know they’re not going to play a full season.\n“The full-back areas as well.\n“I think they struggled with Ben Davies at left-back when they played against Arsenal. Bukayo Saka caused him a lot of problems.\n“When Udogie and Porro are not fit, the strength in depth that they’ve got in these areas, the manager needs to rejuvenate the squad.\n“He played against Manchester City with four full-backs across the back four. That’s obviously an area of glaring need.”\nEmerson set to keep his Spurs\nOne name we didn’t mention regarding summer exits was right-back Emerson Royal, who looks like he might just avoid the cull.\nA different report suggests Tottenham still believe Emerson has something to offer and are keen to keep him as cover going forward.\nThe former Barcelona man, who is known to be a target for Milan, has been a solid performer on the right and in the centre when called upon but struggled badly at left-back in defeats to Chelsea and Liverpool.\nBut in terms of which centre-backs could be Spurs-bound, TEAMtalk have learned that two top targets – Bournemouth’s Lloyd Kelly and Fulham star Tosin Adarabioyo – are on the way to Newcastle in a double blow for Postecoglou.\nHaving signed Romero and Dragusin from Italy, the club have been linked with a Serie A raid again in the form of Bologna centre-back Riccardo Calafiori.\nThe 21-year-old is viewed as perfect cover for Romero and Van de Ven and is good enough to challenge either if their form drops off.",
