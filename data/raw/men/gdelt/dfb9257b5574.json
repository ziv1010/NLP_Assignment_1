  "body_text": "Former Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Foster has insisted Aston Villa boss Unai Emery is unlikely to sanction the permanent signing of Marcus Rashford, citing the forward’s demeanour during the first leg Champions League clash against Paris Saint-Germain.\nRashford has enjoyed a renaissance at Villa since joining them from United during the January transfer window.\nHe has proven to be a key player for Villa, regularly contributing in front of goal, with his most recent strike coming in Tuesday’s 2-1 defeat to Manchester City.\nRashford fell out of favour under head coach Ruben Amorim, who constantly left him out of United matchday squads but he appears to be enjoying his football once again under Emery. Villa have the option of making his stay a permanent one for £40million.\nWhenever Emery has been questioned about whether the Birmingham side will trigger the option, he has remained non-committal, even though his selections have consistently shown a clear preference for Rashford over Ollie Watkins.\nA report covered by The Peoples Person claimed that United could potentially use Rashford as a makeweight in a deal to land Watkins.\nNow, Foster has hinted that Emery is unlikely to keep faith in Rashford beyond this season. He specifically took issue with Rashford’s demeanour and attitude during Villa’s 3-1 defeat to PSG in the first leg of their quarter-final clash. Despite that, Rashford played a pivotal role in the second leg, where Villa came close to pulling off a remarkable comeback with a 3-2 win.\nFoster said on his Fozcast podcast [as quoted by the Express], “I think a lot of people saw him against PSG the other night and were like, ‘Oh my god, that’s Rashford.’ That’s what you want from him and there were glimpses, I totally agree.”\n“During the first leg though, he was miles off it and he didn’t really look happy again.”\nFoster explained that Emery is unlikely to keep Rashford at the expense of losing Watkins.\n“I just think it’s too risky for Aston Villa and I don’t think Unai Emery would sanction it. He’s on so much wages wise at Man United, I think they are going to try and sell him because they need him for PSR [profitability and sustainability rules].”\n“I don’t think Amorim really wants him around the place and he doesn’t suit the system.”\nMeanwhile, United are back in action on Sunday when they go away to Bournemouth.\nFeatured image Michael Steele via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
