The Champions League finalists are considering Balogun as a potential attacking option for the upcoming season.\nWhile no formal bids have been made thus far, it is expected that the USMNT international will have several offers to choose from this summer. RB Leipzig is also monitoring the situation, although they are exploring alternative options such as Lens striker Lois Openda.\nThe @USMNT will not back down and the reaction to this tackle tells me Balogun is already part of the team.\n🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/e4aUdUJkfa— Taylor Twellman (@TaylorTwellman) June 16, 2023\nThe London outfit are willing to sell Balogun as manager Mikel Arteta cannot guarantee regular playing time. However, the Gunners may include a buy-back clause in any potential deal to retain some level of control over the player’s future.\nAs discussions progress and offers start to materialize, the young striker will carefully consider his options, weighing the opportunities for consistent game time and future development.\nThe coming weeks will be crucial in determining the next destination for Folarin Balogun as he aims to make his mark in professional football.",
