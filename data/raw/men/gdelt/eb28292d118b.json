  "body_text": "Manchester United are expected to sign a high-profile striker this summer, but that player does not look like it will be Victor Osimhen.\nWith just 44 goals in the Premier League last season, United were the fifth-lowest scorers in the division, far from the numbers expected of a team aiming for league glory.\nIt is no secret that United are keen to improve their attacking output.\nSeveral prolific strikers have been linked with a move to Old Trafford, and among them is Osimhen.\nThe Nigerian forward remains one of the most lethal strikers in world football.\nHis goal-scoring prowess is unquestionable, and goals inevitably follow whenever he leads the attack.\nIn the 2022-23 season, the Napoli hitman netted 26 goals in 32 matches, firing the Serie A side to their first league title in 33 years.\nDespite missing several games due to injury the following season, the former Lille star still delivered an impressive return, scoring 15 goals in 25 Serie A appearances.\nThe 26-year-old would have hoped to improve on those numbers in Italy this season, but a reported fallout with his Napoli manager, Antonio Conte, led to his departure from the club.\nGalatasaray secured him on a loan deal, a decision they have not regretted.\nOsimhen maintained his fine form in Turkey, scoring 25 goals in 29 appearances.\nHis contribution proved invaluable, helping Galatasaray retain the Super Lig title and secure their 25th domestic championship.\nUnited’s interest and Al Hilal’s offer\nOsimhen’s prolific performances have not gone unnoticed. Several top European clubs, including Arsenal, Chelsea, and United, have been linked with his signature.\nWith a £63 million release clause for clubs outside Italy, the price was clear for those hoping to secure the striker.\nIs there any realistic chance of United signing Osimhen?\nAccording to Sky Sports France, Osimhen is unlikely to switch to Old Trafford.\nThe report suggests he has agreed to personal terms with Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, who are offering him a lucrative £15 million per season deal.\nWhile Al Hilal are confident of finalising the transfer, the deal may take time to be completed as they await funding approval from the Saudi Ministry of Sports.\nCould this delay allow another club to hijack the move?\nFew European clubs can match Al Hilal’s wage offer.\nThe Peoples Person relayed reports that INEOS had no intention of meeting Osimhen’s steep salary demands.\nRegardless, Osimhen has verbally committed to Al Hilal before a summer transfer.\nFor United, missing out on another striker target may seem like a setback, but reports suggest it will not significantly disrupt their recruitment plans.\nUnited turns focus to Delap\nThe Red Devils have reportedly identified Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap as their primary target to lead the attack next season.\nFortunately for United, Delap prioritises a move to Old Trafford, and the absence of Champions League football does not deter him.\nEven if Osimhen snubs Ruben Amorim’s project, United’s striker chase remains intact. With Delap, they may still land the prolific goalscorer they have been searching for.\nFeatured image Ahmad Mora via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
