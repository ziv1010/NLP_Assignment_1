I think with this record that people will remember me here,\" Mbappe said after being awarded a trophy by PSG in a lavish on-field presentation before an adoring crowd.\nMbappe has 30 goals in 30 games for his club this season and has a strong claim to be the best player in the world right now, even if Lionel Messi recently pipped him to win The Best FIFA men's player award.\nMessi, with 18 goals himself for PSG this season, is mainly there to serve Mbappe in Christophe Galtier's side, for whom the absence of Neymar due to injury in Munich — and for several more months — may not matter.\nGoing out of the Champions League in the first knockout round for what would be the fifth time in seven seasons really would matter for PSG and their Qatari owners, however.\nThey lost to Bayern in Lisbon in their only appearance to date in the final, in 2020, but one of the defining performances of Mbappe's time with PSG so far came in Munich the following year.\nIt was a snowy night in April 2021 when Mbappe netted twice in a 3-2 quarter-final first-leg win over Bayern in an empty Allianz Arena.\nHe opened the scoring as Paris went 2-0 up. Bayern pulled themselves back level only for Mbappe to score a superb winner, shaping to curl one towards the far corner only to smash his shot past goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at his near post.\n\"My mind is already on Wednesday's match. We are going to Munich with the clear aim of qualifying,\" Mbappe said on Saturday before playing down suggestions a PSG exit would precipitate his departure from the club.\n\"I don't think this match will have an impact. If I linked my future to the Champions League, without wishing to show a lack of respect for the club, I would have left a long time ago.\n\"I am here and I am very happy to be here. I am not thinking about anything other than making PSG successful.\"\nPSG may need Mbappe's goals more than ever in Bavaria because coach Galtier does not have his defensive problems to seek.\nHis side has looked their best this season when playing with three centre-backs, but the coach´s options in that sector have been limited by the loss of Presnel Kimpembe for the rest of the campaign with an Achilles injury.\nCaptain Marquinhos came off at the weekend with a rib injury, while Nordi Mukiele was also forced off.\nThe former, whose mobility is so important to a defence also featuring an ageing Sergio Ramos, is expected to play even if not fully fit.\nMukiele's presence would be useful too, although Achraf Hakimi may return at right-back less than a week after being charged with rape.\nPSG have said they are supporting the Moroccan while the case is investigated, and the legal proceedings do not stop the player from leaving France.",
