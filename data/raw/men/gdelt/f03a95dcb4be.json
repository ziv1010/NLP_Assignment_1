With hard-working midfielders behind them like Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga, Aurelien Tchouameni and stalwart Luka Modric, the platform is set for Madrid to dominate Spanish and European football for the coming years.\nAppearing on The Residency, Valverde was asked about the prospect of the former PSG forward's arrival and couldn't hide his excitement.\nHe said: \"It's going to be crazy, we have the best team in the world.\"\nMadrid showed their dominance in Spain with 29 victories from their 38 La Liga games, losing just once all season, and eliminated continental giants Manchester City and Bayern Munich before beating Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final last month.\nBoth Valverde and Mbappe are currently on international duty for their respective nations.\nValverde is one of Uruguay's leading figures for their Copa America charge, with their first game coming against Panama in the early hours of Monday morning.\nMbappe, meanwhile, suffered a broken nose during France's 1-0 victory over Austria at Euro 2024 and his participation in their next group stage match against the Netherlands on Friday night is in doubt.\nThe Real Madrid forward will wear a mask on his face for the remainder of the tournament but Les Bleus manager Didier Deschamps gave an encouraging update regarding his potential availability against the Dutch.\nHe said: \"Everything is going in the right direction after this major shock with the consequences. Yesterday he went out, he did a little activity. This will also be the case this evening. Things are moving in the right direction to ensure that he is available tomorrow.\"",
