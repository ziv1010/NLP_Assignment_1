PSG’s performances were as dominant as they were attractive, pairing the best elements of the Tiki-taka movement from Catalonia with Germany’s high-intensity Gegenpressing — the two tactical approaches which have dominated football in the 21st century.\nEnrique’s elevation beyond his peers was officially recognised after being awarded FIFA’s Best Men’s Coach award for 2025, confirming his status as the world’s leading manager. It’s little surprise, therefore, that United would turn their attention towards the Spaniard in the wake of Ruben Amorim‘s dismissal this week — and INEOS are even prepared to rip up their plans to convince him to leave Paris.\nFull Sporting Control\nOne of the key reasons Amorim’s relationship with United’s rulers deteriorated so sharply was the Portuguese coach’s frustration with his lack of influence at the club.\nINEOS’s initial priority after taking the helm was to install a “best in class” executive structure, led by chief executive Omar Berrada, poached from the club’s local rivals. He is joined by Jason Wilcox as sporting director and Christopher Vivell as head of recruitment.\nThis team sits above the head coach — Amorim’s role within the structure — but works closely with him to help steer the football operation at Old Trafford, though ultimately they all answer to Sir Jim Ratcliffe, United’s co-owner and INEOS chairman, and the Glazer family.\nBut in a fiery final press conference, following the 1-1 draw with Leeds United, Amorim called this structure — and his position in it — into question. He made repeated references to himself as the “manager, not the coach” and demanded other figures, including the sporting director and scouting department, “do their jobs” so he could do his.\nIt was a bombastic statement — the type which ends only one way for a coach with such a dismal record.\nRuben Amorim managerial stats at Man United\nUnder-18s coach Darren Fletcher has taken charge of the senior side on a temporary basis, while a permanent caretaker is sourced — with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick the two frontrunners — until the end of the season. A decision on a long-term replacement for Amorim will then be made over the summer.\nBut, in a shocking twist, Fichajes reveals United are now ready to offer “full sporting control” to entice Enrique, as the 52-year-old considers complete autonomy “crucial for implementing his system” — the exact dynamic which led to Amorim’s bombshell departure this week.\nIt would be a remarkable change for INEOS to sanction, given how much effort and attention has been directed towards building the executive structure at United. But Enrique is a manager like no other, outside of unobtainable targets like Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp, and Ratcliffe may just be willing to give him the keys to the Theatre of Dreams to ensure his arrival.\nThe Spanish outlet concludes that Enrique “welcomes” the challenge of rebuilding a “sleeping giant” like the Red Devils and is “seriously considering” a departure from PSG this summer.\nFinal Thoughts\nEnrique represents the best possible candidate for United to appoint — but the Red Devils are not the best possible club for a manager to join. It would be a remarkable, bordering on ridiculous, decision to swap the perfect coaching situation in Paris for a chaotic one in Manchester, even for the most ambitious of managers.\nUnited are also believed to be prioritising a coach with Premier League experience, something even the best manager in the world lacks. And there is yet to be a reputable source confirming this story, with PSG sporting director Luis Campos describing it as “100% fake news”, though every executive in the world would say the same, regardless of the truth.\nIt also would constitute a complete abandonment of INEOS’s plan to give a manager the level of influence Fichajes are claiming Enrique wants.\nAs such, The Peoples Person advises caution before any level of excitement builds around the idea of Enrique arriving at Old Trafford — even if this writer’s imagination is already running wild thinking of how good Kobbie Mainoo would look in the Spaniard’s system.\nFeatured image Michael Regan via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
