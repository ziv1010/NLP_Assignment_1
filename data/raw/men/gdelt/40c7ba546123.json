The World Cup circus is in full swing — brace yourselves for another Gianni Infantino wheeze — but the city of Chicago will take no part in it. We’re here to explain.\nOn the way:\n- Why Chicago said no to 2026\n- FIFA creates ‘peace prize’\n- More sorcery from Yamal\n- Wrexham star ‘punched’ fan\nChicago no show: Why city did not want to be a World Cup host\nNo bid to host the World Cup is worth its salt without promising to lavish riches on a country domestically. Every tournament, without fail, will be ‘worth X to the local economy’ (insert a satisfying number of millions or billions), heading off financial sceptics at the pass.\nAdvertisement\nThe book Soccernomics devoted a chapter to this subject and, through a fair amount of research, deduced that projections of how much a nation earns from a World Cup — i.e. the amount of cash which benefits ordinary people like you and me — are often optimistic at best. Some are pulled from fantasy land. If you’re in the United States, Mexico or Canada, I’d recommend reading it.\nAnd when you see it said, as it does in two FIFA-backed reports, that the 2026 edition and the 2025 Club World Cup could generate a combined $47bn (£36bn) for the U.S. alone, I’d suggest applying your hogwash filter. It’s possible that the impact will be felt to that extent. Just don’t take the figures at face value.\nChicago certainly didn’t, hence why the third-biggest city by population in the States won’t be hosting any of the matches at the 2026 finals. It’s odd when you think about it. Soldier Field, above, the home of the Chicago Bears and Chicago Fire, is every bit as large and modern as the average venue set aside for next summer. I’d have had it on my bingo list as readily as Boston, San Francisco or Philadelphia.\nBut as Adam Crafton illustrates in his World Cup column today, the authorities in Chicago were far from convinced that pitching to be a host was in the best interests of the city’s public purse. On the contrary, they feared it might merely incur debt. So Chicago was out. And others who got in on the act are apparently wondering if the Windy City called it right.\nCost-benefit equation\nAdam spoke to Kara Bachman, the executive director for the Chicago Sport Commission (a body which supports major events there). Her concerns were numerous, starting with the question of whether Chicago would post a significant profit from hosting World Cup games.\nBeyond that, she described the terms put forward by world governing body FIFA as “demands”, not requests, and claimed Chicago had no power to alter the contract it would be told to sign. She says she was unable to speak to anybody at FIFA in person, calling this “a red flag”. FIFA sources contacted by Adam insist they were cooperative but according to Bachman, officials in certain host cities — having encountered the reality — quietly wish they had taken Chicago’s stance.\nAdvertisement\nThe costs incurred through hosting are not minor. Take, for instance, the $37m spent upgrading MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the stage for the World Cup final, or the $65m that state will spend on travel security. It falls to individual locations to manage “safety, security and protection”, none of which is simple or cheap for a competition so big. Adam also reports U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent threats to relocate fixtures are running the risk of spooking prospective sponsors.\nThe counter-argument is that the World Cup can turn host cities into jamborees. People in and around group-stage and knockout-phase matches are having the door opened to experiences they might remember forever (assuming they can afford to attend). But on the matter of who stands to earn what from the 2026 finals, all we can say is that FIFA will make hay. The various host cities would be well advised not to spend their mooted royalties in advance.\n- FIFA president Gianni Infantino announced yesterday that he will present a specially-created ‘Peace Prize’ at the World Cup group-stage draw on December 5. No awards for guessing the most likely recipient…\nNews round-up\n- Wrexham winger James McClean has admitted punching a Cardiff City fan outside Wrexham’s stadium before last month’s Carabao Cup tie between the two Welsh clubs. He says he reacted in self-defence after being threatened in the car park.\n- Paris Saint-Germain will be relieved about this development: Achraf Hakimi avoided a serious injury when he was fouled by Bayern Munich’s Luis Diaz on Tuesday night. A sprained ankle is expected to keep the defender out for about six weeks.\n- Christian Pulisic, meanwhile, should return to Milan’s squad for their Serie A match at Parma on Saturday. The USMNT forward suffered a hamstring strain during October’s international break.\n- A great exclusive from Tom Bogert, who learned that Luis Suarez will miss the crucial third and final MLS play-off game between Inter Miami and Nashville. We’re told the Miami striker was cited for kicking out at opponent Andy Najar in game two.\n- San Jose Earthquakes top scorer Josef Martinez is leaving the franchise. I’d expect other MLS sides to be sweet on him as a free agent. He scored 14 league goals this season.\n- Another potential international switch to tell you about: Marcelo Flores, who has three caps for Mexico, is to join a Canada training camp in the next international window. Jesse Marsch has been chasing him for a while.\nSuper strikes: Big clubs, big goals, starting to dominate Champions League\nI’m not saying UEFA’s Champions League is going as expected this season, but the top eight halfway through the first stage resembles a European Super League, with English sides doing particularly well. Barcelona, in 11th, are the only real outliers, and that won’t last.\nDon’t mistake those observations for complaints, though. I’m a natural-born sceptic, but I can’t deny the Champions League is the most entertaining competition out there as it stands. The goals alone are worth the subscription fees, and after Micky van de Ven’s Roadrunner impression for Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday, we were treated to another batch of dynamite last night.\nApologies to Lazar Samardzic, whose stonking late winner for Atalanta at Marseille doesn’t quite make the TAFC cut, but we had to squeeze in a Lionel Messi-esque finish from Lamine Yamal in Barcelona’s 3-3 draw at Club Brugge, above.\nAdvertisement\nAnd you remember I wrote about Piotr Zielinski’s volley for Inter at the weekend being as smooth as chocolate? Well, this Dan Burn header for Newcastle United in their win against Athletic Club, below, is straight out of the same packet. Every time I roll it back, I’m convinced it’s going wide. Genius.\nTactics board: ‘Total Football’ and the origin of the 4-3-3\nRinus Michels and Johan Cruyff made 4-3-3 the staple diet at Ajax. Then they took it to Barcelona. It was so immensely successful for both clubs (and later under Pep Guardiola at Barca) that you’d think the system would have taken over the world.\nInstead, it remains the domain of Dutch clubs, many of whom still cling to Cruyff’s ideal of Total Football. That’s not to say coaches elsewhere don’t go 4-3-3 — Jurgen Klopp did at Liverpool, and Luis Enrique guided PSG to the Champions League title last season using that formation, after a fashion — but the Netherlands is its spiritual home.\nThat’s shown by The Athletic’s latest Tactics Board feature, a series which our readers have been all over (the potted histories of 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2 were very popular). Since 2011-12, four of the five teams who have used 4-3-3 most often are Dutch, with Ajax top of the list. Only nine of the top 20 hail from elsewhere.\nBut even in the Netherlands, loyalty to it is fading. Go back 10 years or so and a staggering 79 per cent of formations deployed in the Eredivisie top flight were 4-3-3. Now it’s down to 29 per cent. “Anyone with the guts to use 4-3-3 in the right way will be rewarded, as long as the right players are chosen,” Cruyff once wrote, and his word was gospel. But no corner of football is impervious to change.\nAround TAFC\n- Adidas hit us with a batch of World Cup 2026 kits yesterday, including the shirt that Argentina will defend their title in. We’ve got the full array for you to check out here. They’re highly generic, in my humble opinion, though I do like Italy’s.\n- You won’t read a better interview today than Michael Walker’s chat with Granit Xhaka. The 33-year-old’s impact at Sunderland since arriving in the summer is resonating but what I really wanted to hear more about was that infamous flashpoint in his Arsenal days. Michael got right to the bottom of it.\n- Anantaajith Raghuraman’s Alternative Premier League Table is focusing on expected goals against (xGA) metrics today. It’s funny: however you slice these things, Arsenal come out on top.\n- Underwhelming spells in charge of Chelsea and Everton damaged Frank Lampard’s stock as a head coach. But he’s now smashing it at Coventry City, who are on track for promotion from the Championship. Cerys Jones went to check his team out.\n- Did you know that Fulham have the smallest pitch in the Premier League (with Liverpool close behind) — or that pitch sizes in the division are allowed to be different? Let Tifo Football fill you in.\n- Most clicked in Wednesday’s TAFC (by miles): Van de Ven’s box-to-box rampage.\nCatch a match\nSelected games (3pm/8pm unless otherwise stated. All TNT Sports in UK)\nUEFA Europa League: Midtjylland vs Celtic, 12.45pm/5.45pm — Paramount+, ViX; Sturm Graz vs Nottingham Forest, 12.45pm/5.45pm — CBS, Paramount+, Fubo, ViX; Aston Villa vs Maccabi Tel Aviv — Paramount+, DAZN; Rangers vs Roma — CBS, Paramount+, Fubo, DAZN; Real Betis vs Lyon, Stuttgart vs Feyenoord — both Paramount+, ViX.\nAdvertisement\nUEFA Conference League: Mainz vs Fiorentina, 12.45pm/5.45pm; Crystal Palace vs AZ — both Paramount+, ViX.\nAnd finally…\nLet’s lower the tone with foul of the week. A Swedish top-flight game between GAIS and Osters IF was tied at 1-1 in the 97th minute when GAIS broke clear in search of a winner. Osters’ defender Mattis Adolfsson had two choices: let the attack ride or stick a foot in. Like any loyal servant, he took one for the team. I can feel this one from here.\n📬 Love TAFC?
