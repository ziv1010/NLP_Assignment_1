Sunday 2 April, 17:00 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played? Campo de Futbol Jose Maria Soriano Munoz\nTV channel/live stream? DAZN Women's Football YouTube\nREAD NEXT\nBarcelona team news\nBarça have recently been buoyed by the return of Ballon d'Or Feminin holder Alexia Putellas to training after recovering from an ACL injury, though she is still a few weeks away from competitive.\nMariona Caldentey (hamstring) and Claudia Pina (ankle) have both missed recent games with niggling injuries, but could return to the matchday squad on Sunday.\nJonatan Giraldez will likely field his strongest side possible ahead of the April international window having made a number of changes for last week's Clasico win - the starting XI should look more reminiscent of Wednesday's thrashing of Roma.\nAlhama vs Barcelona score prediction\nWith 23 wins under their belt already and having emerged as 4-0 victors in their last meeting, it's probably fair to say that Barcelona are overwhelming favourites here and any other result would be a huge shock.\nA place in history remains at stake with the Liga F title pretty much sewn up, but Barça have both the star quality and strength in depth to march on and complete a flawless season in this competition.\nSpare a thought for Alhama, who will surely be hoping just to keep the scoreline down on Sunday.\nPrediction: Alhama 0-3 Barcelona",
