  "body_text": "Manchester United planning for life without European football next season\nManchester United have accounted for the prospect of the club missing out on European qualification this season, Telegraph Sport understands.\nUnited announced last week that there would be up to a further 200 job cuts on top of the 250 redundancies from last summer as part of the club’s ongoing drive to save money after pre-tax losses of £313 million in the last three seasons.\nBudgeting going forward has been calculated under the assumption that United qualify for the Europa League for the next four years – a marked change after years of budgeting to reach the Champions League knockout stages.\nTelegraph Sport believes this caused some concern and unease among staff fearful of the financial implications and knock-on effect on jobs if United fail to secure European qualification this term. However, it has emerged that United have factored in the threat of no European football at Old Trafford next season as part of their costings.\nUnited must win Europa League\nUnited’s exit from the FA Cup on penalties at home to Fulham on Sunday shut off another potential route into Europe next season.\nWith United languishing in 14th position in the Premier League, it means the club’s only realistic prospect of playing European football next season is to win the Europa League in Bilbao in May. United are due to face Real Sociedad in San Sebastian on Thursday in the first leg of their round of 16 tie. Victory in that competition would secure entry into next season’s Champions League and bring with it a significant financial windfall at a time when United are exploring an array of different ways to boost revenues at the same time as cutting costs, including post-season tour games in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong worth around £8 million.\nRuben Amorim, the United head coach, has already admitted the club must “sell to buy” this summer and the prospect of no income from European football next season would further reduce their room for manoeuvre in the transfer window.\nUnited historically tended to budget for the club reaching the Champions League quarter-final stage each season but they have only achieved that feat twice since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.\nAlthough United’s aim is always to be in the Champions League, the club are adopting a more prudent approach to budgeting.\nInjury problems ahead of Sociedad tie\nHarry Maguire is to be assessed this week as Amorim continues to wrestle with a host of personnel problems ahead of Sociedad, which has become United’s most important match of the season to date.\nLuke Shaw, Mason Mount, Amad Diallo, Lisandro Martínez, Kobbie Mainoo, Jonny Evans, Toby Collyer, Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton all missed the Fulham match through injury.\nPatrick Dorgu is due to return against Sociedad after missing the Fulham game through suspension and Amorim will hope Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee recover properly after both suffered from cramp on Sunday, when the game went to extra time before United lost 4-3 on penalties.\nMore in Sports\nUnited will be without Chido Obi for the Sociedad game as the 17-year-old striker is ineligible for the Europa League. He cannot be added to the B list of players due to only signing for United’s academy from Arsenal last year. Players need to have been signed for at least two years to be eligible for the B list. It means Amorim has just Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, both of whom are struggle for goals, as his only striker options.\nObi could have been named on the revised A list that was submitted last month but United opted not to. Patrick Dorgu, a £29 million January signing from Lecce, and Ayden Heaven, who arrived from Arsenal for £1.5 million the same month, were added to the 25 man squad list before the February 6 deadline.",
