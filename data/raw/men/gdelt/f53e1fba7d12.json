  "body_text": "Euro Paper Talk: Edu strikes gold as Arsenal agree €60m fee for sublime first summer signing; Leeds to swap top star for Leverkusen striker\nArsenal have agreed terms over their first signing of the summer, Tottenham have made a first move for a playmaker with 29-goal contributions this season, while Leeds will reportedly sacrifice their star man for a 54-goal Bayer Leverkusen striker.\nEDU AGREES DEAL TO BRING JOSHUA ZIRKZEE TO ARSENAL\nArsenal are moving closer and closer to the signing of Joshua Zirkzee – with reports in Italy explaining why it is adavantage Edu in the race to land the talented Bologna striker.\nThe Dutchman is enjoying a brilliant season under Thiago Motta, with the La Rossa very much on track to secure a place in next season’s Champions League. And with Serie A set to be granted a fifth place in next season’s expanded format, it would take a pretty hefty collapse for Bologna to miss out now.\nHowever, the flipside of their success is that a number of top clubs are starting to pay close attention to a number of their prized assets – and reports in the Italian media widely expect one of Serie A’s smaller side to see their squad picked apart this summer – starting with in-demand coach Motta, who is wanted by Juventus.\nBut it is star attacker Zirkzee who is attracting the most attention with Juve, AC Milan and Inter Milan all making a beeline to Bologna’s games to track the brilliant 22-year-old.\nGO DEEPER ~ Joshua Zirkzee scouting report: Why big clubs are desperate to bring in 22 y/o talent\nNow according to Wednesday’s Tuttosport, it is Arsenal who lead that race, having recently met with the striker’s agent to offer him a deal worth €6m a year (£100,000 a week), which has already been accepted by his entourage.\nAnd while his suitors could yet make an offer to match that, they won’t be able to compete with the Gunners when it comes to the Netherlands international’s transfer fee.\nTo that end, and amid claims Bologna would rather see Zirkzee move abroad than joining a Serie A rival, it’s suggested that Arsenal have also already negotiated a fee for his services for €60m (£51.6m).\nGunners sporting director Edu Gaspar has looked at a number of attacking options this summer to strengthen the Arsenal attack, with neither Gabriel Jesus or Eddie Nketiah seen as prolific enough.\nAnd while the likes of Victor Osimhen, Ivan Toney, Viktor Gyokeres and Alexander Isak have all been considered, it’s reported that Edu feels that Zirkzee best fits their profile and offers best value for money this summer.\nAs a result, it’s now reported that the 42-goal marksman will become the Gunners’ first signing of the summer as they look to build on their achievements of this season.\nMAN UTD READY TO SPEND BIG TO SIGN INTER DEFENDER\nManchester United are prepared to go as high as €60m (£52m) in an effort to convince Inter Milan to sell star Italy defender Alessandro Bastoni.
