  "body_text": "Liverpool can be crowned Premier League champions on Sunday when they play Leicester City at the King Power.\nAside from a slight wobble in the last few weeks, Arne Slot’s side have been near unstoppable all season long, building up a 13 point lead over Arsenal.\nIt has been known for some time that the Reds will end up victorious, with the Gunners wisely switching focus to the Champions League, a decision that has worked with Mikel Arteta’s men defeating Real Madrid to reach the semi-finals.\nThe Reds only need six points in the final six games of the season to seal their second Premier League title but they could wrap up proceedings today with the Gunners also in action at Ipswich Town.\nHere are all the title permutations:\nCan Liverpool win the Premier League title today?\nThe earliest date Liverpool could officially be declared Premier League champions is today, Sunday, April 20 when they travel to Leicester.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nFor that to happen, Arsenal would need to lose at Ipswich Town first, followed by the Reds beating the Foxes, which would give Liverpool an unassailable lead of 16 points with five games to go.\nHowever, both Ipswich and Leicester are destined for relegation so the likelihood of the Tractor Boys beating the Gunners isn’t high.\nTherefore, it is more likely that the title will be won sometime next week. Should, as expected, both Liverpool and Arsenal win today, the next opportunity to be crowned champions will be on Wednesday, April 23 if the Gunners lose at home to Crystal Palace.\nIf they avoid defeat to the Eagles, the Reds need only match their result when they welcome Tottenham to Anfield on Sunday, April 27.\nLiverpool's remaining Premier League fixtures\n20 Apr: Leicester (a)\n27 Apr: Spurs (h)\n04 May: Chelsea (a)\n11 May: Arsenal (h)\n18 May: Brighton (a)\n25 May: Crystal Palace (h)\nThis would be only Liverpool’s second Premier League title but the first they’d be able to properly celebrate with fans after their 2019/20 triumph during the Covid-19 lockdown.\nIt is a remarkable achievement for head coach Slot in his first season since replacing the great Jurgen Klopp, with the Reds losing just two league games under the Dutchman.\nShould they win their remaining six fixtures, they will finish the season on 94 points, their third best tally behind only the 2019/20 and 2018/19 campaigns.\nArsenal's remaining Premier League fixtures\n20 Apr: Ipswich (a)\n23 Apr: Crystal Palace (h)\n03 May: Bournemouth (h)\n11 May: Liverpool (a)\n18 May: Newcastle (h)\n25 May: Southampton (a)\nWill Arsenal give Liverpool a Guard of Honour?\nAs is tradition, should Liverpool win the Premier League title before the final game of the season, opposing teams will give them a Guard of Honour when they walk onto the pitch ahead of matches.\nMore Trending\nThat means that if, as expected, the title is wrapped up against Tottenham, Arsenal should give Liverpool’s players a Guard of Honour when they meet at Anfield on May 11.\nThe same will apply for Chelsea, Brighton and Crystal Palace.\nThe Gunners honoured the tradition in 2020, though Mikel Arteta’s side were not title contenders then so it remains to be seen whether they will follow suit this time round.\nThankfully for the north London club, they will most likely not have to witness Van Dijk lift the trophy in person as that should be saved for Liverpool’s last home game against Palace on May 25.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Man Utd ready to offer Marcus Rashford in deal to sign ‘fuming’ Premier League star\nMORE: Is Man Utd vs Wolves on TV today?
