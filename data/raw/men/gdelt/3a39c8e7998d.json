  "body_text": "Enzo Maresca has explained why Estevao Willian was an unused substitute in Chelsea’s Champions League defeat to Atalanta.\nChelsea’s hopes of automatic qualification to the knockout stages of the Champions League were dealt a major blow on Tuesday as the Blues were beaten 2-1 by Atalanta.\nJoao Pedro gave the Premier League side the lead midway through the first-half but the hosts scored two second-half goals to come from behind and clinch their fourth win from six European games.\nWhile Atalanta climb to third in the Champions League group phase ahead of Wednesday’s other European fixtures, Chelsea slip to 11th.\nMaresca’s side were tipped as dark horses after an impressive 3-0 win over La Liga champions Barcelona last month but Chelsea have not won any of their four games since then.\nReflecting on Chelsea’s defeat in Italy, Maresca said: ‘I think after the first goal we conceded, we lost a little bit of control of the game.\n‘In the first half, we scored the goal but also we created some chances. In the second half, I think we had two good chances to score the second one.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘And then again, after we conceded the 1-1 [goal], we lost a little bit of control of the game, and then we conceded the second one. I think both goals, we can avoid both of them, they’re quite easy goals.\n‘Now that the game is finished, now the focus has to be on Saturday game, because now we need as soon as possible to win games.’\nChelsea supporters were surprised and disappointed not only to see Brazilian teenage sensation Estevao on the bench but remain there for the entity of the game.\nAsked whether he was planning to bring Estevao on before he introduced Tosin Adarabioyo for the injured Wesley Fofana, Maresca said: ‘The idea, the change of Tosin, is because Wes went in to change him. So that was a bit of a force, for sure.\n‘With one more change, probably there was more chance for Estevao to go inside or for Andrey [Santos] to go inside. But then with that change, it changed a little bit the plan of the game.’\nEstevao has quickly established himself as one of the most exciting young players in world football since his £51m summer move to Chelsea.\nThe 18-year-old has scored five goals for Chelsea but Maresca has been keen to manage his workload, starting him six times in the Premier League and three times in Europe.\nDiscussing his rotation policy more in detail, Maresca added: ‘I think tonight, first XI, we had inside the pitch eight, nine players that they play against Tottenham, they play against Barcelona, they play against Wolves, Arsenal.\n‘We had eight, nine players that they are the ones that they are playing every time, these kind of games.\n‘So if you see the five changes that we did compared to Bournemouth, it’s different.\n‘But if you see that inside the pitch, we had eight, nine players that they are the same, Barcelona, Arsenal, Tottenham, Wolves, you know, these kind of games.\n‘But the ones that they play tonight are the ones that they are playing almost all the games.’\nFollowing their second Champions League defeat of the season, Maresca believes Chelsea will need to win their final two group games to qualify automatically for the knockout stages and avoid play-off matches.\nChelsea face Greek side Pafos next before finishing their Champions League group campaign at Serie A champions Napoli.\n‘Yes, probably with two wins, probably with 16 points, you can be in the top eight,’ Maresca said. ‘Not sure about that, but now the focus has to be that first game.\nMore Trending\n‘And then the next one, for sure. If we want to try to finish top eight, we need to win both. Otherwise, we try to play the play-off and then go to the next round.’\nChelsea will put their Champions League aspirations on hold this weekend and look to get back to winning ways in the Premier League against Everton.\nThe Blues welcome Everton to Stamford Bridge sitting fifth in the table, eight points behind leaders Arsenal.\nEverton have won four of their last five games to climb to seventh in the Premier League, just two places and one point behind Chelsea.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Rio Ferdinand urges Man Utd to make ‘unbelievable offer’ for Liverpool star\nMORE: Martin Keown names the signing Barcelona need to win the Champions League\nMORE: Thierry Henry says Liverpool star is ‘not at the races’ after Inter Milan win",
