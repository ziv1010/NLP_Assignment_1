We've got you covered. Nottingham Forest vs Sheffield United is not being shown in the UK. Brit abroad? Use a VPN to watch the Premier League with your subscription from anywhere.\nBoth Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United come into this game desperate to get off the mark in the Premier League, following their respective opening day defeats to Arsenal and Crystal Palace.\nForest showed promise against Arsenal at the Emirates, though, with Steve Cooper's side refusing to give up and Taiwo Awoniyi scoring in the final 10 minutes after a fantastic run from Anthony Elanga.\nThe manager still wants some fresh faces through the door before deadline day, however, but they'll be confident heading into their first home game of the season regardless.\nSheffield United, meanwhile, fell 1-0 at home to Palace on opening day, failing to make an instant impact upon their return to the top tier. Losing Sander Berge and Iliman Ndiaye certainly hasn't helped their survival chances, but Paul Heckingbottom's side have plenty of character and will look to be difficult against a side they need to secure points against if they're to beat the drop.\nKick-off is at 7.45pm BST. Make sure you know how to watch the Premier League wherever you are.\nTeam news\nOmar Richards, Wayne Hennessey and Felipe are all missing for Nottingham Forest, with none of the three expected to make a return to Steve Cooper's side until at least September.\nSheffield United are without a host of players for their second game. Rhian Brewster, Ismaila Coulibaly and Jayden Bogle are all expected to return in September from injury, while the extent of John Fleck's and Rhys Norrington-Davies' problems aren't clear yet. Ollie McBurnie, Ismaila Coulibaly and Daniel Jebbison are all missing, too.\nForm\nNottingham Forest: L\nSheffield United: L\nReferee\nPeter Bankes will be the referee for Nottingham Forest vs Sheffield United. His assistants will be Harry Lennard and Nick Greenhalgh, with Andy Madley the fourth official. Michael Oliver is the VAR, with Stuart Burt the assistant VAR.\nStadium\nNottingham Forest vs Sheffield United will be played at the City Ground in Nottingham, which has a capacity of 30,445.\nKick-off and channel\nNottingham Forest vs Sheffield United kick-off is at 7.45pm BST on Friday 18 August in the UK. The game is not being shown live in the UK.\nIn the US, kick-off time is 14.45pm ET / 11.45am PT. The match will be shown on NBC in the US. See below for international broadcast options.\nVPN guide\nUse a VPN to watch Premier League football from outside your country\nIf you’re out of the country for a Premier League fixture, then you won't be able to watch on your domestic streaming service as usual. The broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!) and blocks you from watching it. You can use a VPN to get around that, though, without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and will let you watch. And all the info going between is entirely encrypted, anonymous and safe – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there. For the Premier League, FourFourTwo currently recommends:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS5 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price.
