The official spoke about a \"Bayern-like performance and reaction.\"\nIn time, German international Joshua Kimmich, Kingsley Coman, and silverback Muller turned into team-leading forces pushing their colors forward. Winger Coman continued his stunning journey over the past weeks. Nagelsmann called the French international \"one of the best in the world.\"\nMuller spoke about a performance close to \"what is our claim\" and a rest-of-season guideline \"we want to follow in the same efficient way.\"\nWhile fans enthusiastically celebrated Mane's return after 110 days due to an injury that made the former Liverpool striker miss the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Africa's 2022 footballer of the year spoke of an \"entirely happy day.\"\nThe 25 on-pitch minutes \"are an important step for me after a long journey,\" the forward stated. The 30-year-old announced to use the upcoming days to reach the full shape to face French giant Paris on home soil at the beginning of March.\nBayern is enjoying the advantage of a 1-0 victory out of the first leg.\n\"We all have a common goal this season as we want to make it to the Champions League final in Istanbul,\" Mane said adding his side has taken a promising path to meet the expressed goals of playing passionate football.
