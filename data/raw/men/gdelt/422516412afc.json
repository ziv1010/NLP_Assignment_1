  "body_text": "Carlo Ancelotti spoke to the media ahead of Real Madrid’s game at Mallorca on Saturday. Ancelotti was asked a few questions in a rather short press conference, particularly about Bellingham’s form, to which he said: “His scoring pace has slowed down, but he had 20 goals. That was precisely the surprise. He is doing his job; he is more of a midfielder, but in terms of football, he is very good. He does not lack anything, only the goals, which sooner or later will return.”\nAncelotti: “Bellingham does not lack anything, only the goals, which sooner or later will return”\nAncelotti speaks to the media ahead of Mallorca.\nAncelotti on Militao and Rodrygo\n“Rodrygo suffered a knock yesterday, but the entire squad will be available, and the priority is tomorrow, not Manchester. We have a lot at stake, like all teams. We maintain confidence, and, I repeat, tomorrow is vital. Millitao is also available.”\nOn what he expects from Mallorca\n“Difficult, competitive game against a rival with an extraordinary collective attitude. It will be intense. We will try to match what the rival does very well: commitment.”\nOn Nacho’s form\n“He is Nacho, someone who is always reliable, but when you play so much, you can also make more mistakes. He is a player with a lot of confidence and personality, who has been useful and will continue to be.”\nOn Modric’s physical levels\n“I see him well at his best on a physical level no matter when I put him in. It’s a good time for him, that’s what I think. That physically, he is fine.”\nOn the entire team’s physical levels\n“The physical sensations are very good, and although in the second half, we went down a little, we had a 2-1 advantage, and we tried to manage it, nothing more, but physically everyone is fine.”\nOn whether it’s important for players to get “reps” before a big game\n“It’s a thought that we have in our heads, of course, but if I see a player well, I don’t think about the minutes he has spent or the time he accumulates outside. I put someone who was coming off an injury in a Champions League final and I did it because he saw him well, at that moment, that night. The question for a footballer is whether he is available.”\nOn whether he’ll keep Rodrygo on the left\n“Could be. Vinicius is very humble and has understood that this system can be good for the team, with him playing more inside. It’s something I’ve talked to both of them about, and they agreed.”\nIn which league has Carlo been the happiest?\n“I am happy at Real Madrid! Because this city has a kind of climate, people and, above all, Real Madrid.”\nOn the poor performances from Haaland, Mbappe and Bellingham on Tuesday / Wednesday\n“Calm, Calm. It may be that they did not give their best versions in the first leg, but now other games are coming up and... be careful. Be careful with the three you mentioned.”\nOn whether losing the CdR final has impacted Mallorca\n“I don’t know, but they have the urgency of permanence, so I hope for their best version. It will be an enormously demanding match, really.”\nOn whether Tchouameni will keep playing as a centre-back\n“Well, it is one more resource that we have, but always keep in mind that it is a great pivot.”",
