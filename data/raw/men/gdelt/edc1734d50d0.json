The 30-year-old model expressed her gratitude to the medical team after a four-day stay in the hospital due to pneumonia.\nFollowing a glamorous break in Saint-Tropez with football icon Ronaldo which sparked secret wedding buzz, Georgina took to Instagram to share her health ordeal: \"Finally back home! I spent 4 days at the hospital with pneumonia, I'm better now but still recovering at home with my family.\n\"I have to say a big THANK YOU to all the staff members, doctors, nurses and everyone at the hospital... They took care of me so wonderfully and I'm very grateful for that. Thank you all for such a great stay.\"\nPosted from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, she included a photo taken at the Saudi German Hospital, showcasing her arm with an IV, the Mirror reports. The hospital prides itself on treating patients \"like family\".\nWhile Georgina recuperated at what's billed as Dubai's top hospital, her rumoured hubby Cristiano was on the pitch for Al-Nassr in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nThe former Manchester United star recently showcased his enduring talent, netting a goal in the tense 2-1 victory for his Saudi Pro League team against Al-Shabab just last week.\nHe then jetted off to Dubai to face Iranian side Esteghlal in the AFC Champions League, where he played the entire match, contributing to his team's narrow 1-0 win.\nCristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodriguez have been an item since 2016, sharing two children of their own, while Georgina also plays a nurturing role to Ronaldo's other three children. The couple sparked marriage rumours during a yacht excursion on their opulent holiday, as both were spotted donning what appeared to be wedding bands.\nAdding to the speculation, Ronaldo referred to Georgina as his 'wife' during a playful Mr. and Mrs. game on his new YouTube channel, although the football legend has never publicly confirmed a wedding nor addressed the gossip.\nTheir romance began with a chance encounter at a Gucci store in Madrid, where Georgina was employed as a sales assistant when the celebrated Real Madrid player walked in back in 2016.\nIn a heartfelt revelation to Italy's Elle magazine, Georgina reminisced: \"The first meeting with Ronaldo was at Gucci where I worked as a sales assistant. Days later we saw each other again at another brand's event. It was then we could talk in a relaxed atmosphere, outside of my work environment. It was love at first sight for both.\"\nGeorgina accompanied Ronaldo to Saudi Arabia when he decided to leave Europe and sign a high-profile deal with Al-Nassr, marking the Saudi Pro League's most significant signing. Ronaldo has previously expressed a desire to expand his family to seven children, mirroring his iconic shirt number.\nDuring an interview in July 2017, after already having three children and dating Georgina for about a year, Ronaldo is quoted in the Portuguese media, saying: \"My eldest Cristianinho is very happy. He's doing well and says he wants more brothers and sisters. He wants seven, the magic number, and I think that's good.\"\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.
