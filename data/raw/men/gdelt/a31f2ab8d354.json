But there are also the UEFA Europa League and Europa Conference League competitions, which will also kick off their first legs in the second week of May.\nWith that in mind, which of the six first leg ties offer the best value for real money players, bettors and fans with New York gambling sites?\nHere is a look at a few of them, with an eye towards who might be playing in the finals, and a look as well at the futures odds for each tournament.\nUEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TITLE FUTURES\nManchester City -143\nReal Madrid +375\nInter +700\nAC Milan +750\nBEST FIRST LEG MATCHUP\nReal Madrid (+210) v Manchester City (+128), draw (+245)\nThis is a rematch of last season’s semifinals, which was won 6-5 on aggregate in dramatic fashion by Real Madrid with two goals in the final minutes of the second leg.

You can get great odds on either team at betMGM NY.\nUEFA EUROPA LEAGUE TITLE FUTURES\nJuventus +190\nRoma +275\nBayer Leverkusen +275\nSevilla +375\nBEST FIRST LEG MATCHUP\nJuventus (-110) v Sevilla (+350), draw (+240)\nThe Italian team is back in the Serie A top four after a points deduction was overturned, and can now advance to a final if they can beat Sevilla.
