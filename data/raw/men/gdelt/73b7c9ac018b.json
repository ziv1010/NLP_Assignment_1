  "body_text": "Seven years ago, I published an article titled ‘Meet the Real Madrid U23 XI,’ marvelled at the fact that I could now put together an entire squad’s worth of talent for a club previously hesitant to place trust in younger players. Back then, this team could have easily secured results at top level despite the tender age of the players. Fast forward to 2024, and the youth policy started in late 2014 has been a colossal success, resulting in the most successful decade of football in Real Madrid history, with the trophy room continuing to expand year upon year. But what happened to the original band of players put together all those years ago? This article delves into the journey’s of each player in the squad, and establishes how their careers have gone so far and what they are up to now. The players will be listed with their current age and clubs, and the age that they were at the time in brackets.\nThe Real Madrid U23 XI: Where Are They Now?\nRevisiting the start of the youth policy, seven years later.\nThe Starters\nRubén Yáñez - 30 (23) - Sporting Gijón\nFirst Team appearances: 1\nClubs: Castilla, Real Madrid, Getafe, Cadiz, Huesca, Malaga, Sporting Gijon\nCareer Honours: 5\nPotential reached: No\nPerhaps the most disappointing department down at Castilla and the academy is that of the goalkeepers’. Rubén Yáñez was the third choice keeper for the Real Madrid first team for two seasons after impressing with Castilla, picking up a debut and four medals for his troubles. The former Spanish youth international is still amongst the best that the academy has produced in recent years. Rubén left for Getafe in La Liga, where things seemed to be going okay, before dropping down to the second division, never to return (as of yet). Other than a short spell in the third tier, in which he won the title with Huesca, he has managed to maintain a decent level in the second best league in Spain. Currently first choice at Sporting Gijón, Rubén hasn’t lived up the to top level potential that he exhibited at Real Madrid. There is still time, though.\nAchraf Hakimi - 25 (18) - PSG\nFirst Team appearances: 17 (2 goals, 1 assist)\nClubs: Castilla, Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan, PSG\nCareer Honours: 12\nPotential reached: Yes\nIf the academy lacks goalkeeping pedigree, it certainly makes up for it with full-backs in abundance. Achraf Hakimi is one of the best right-backs I have seen play at Castilla, making his international debut with Morocco whilst with the development side, and has gone on to become one of the best in the world in his position. His ability on the ball meant that at times he has excelled at a very high level as a winger, and has looked comfortable on either the right or the left hand side. Sadly, despite winning four trophies with Real Madrid, his time with the senior side was a short one. However, Madrid did secure some decent funds for him (€43M to Inter), as he has gone on to make a name for himself elsewhere.\nDiego Llorente - 30 (23) - Roma\nFirst Team appearances: 3\nClubs: Castilla, Real Madrid, Rayo Vallecano, Malaga, Real Sociedad, Leeds United, Roma\nCareer Honours: 1\nPotential reached: No\nIt feels harsh putting a no by the composed Diego Llorente’s name, as he has sustained a top level standard throughout his career, with a handful of Spain caps to add to his name. However, in the early stages of his journey he looked destined to contribute to Real Madrid. Still, he is currently a start at Roma in Serie A, on loan from Leeds United where he has also played regularly in the Premier League. He has also increased his versatility, occasionally being deployed in midfield, adding to the fact he started out as a strong right-back at Castilla. I doubt he will lose much sleep with the way his career has gone.\nJesús Vallejo - 27 (20) - Granada\nFirst Team appearances: 31 (1 goal)\nClubs: Real Zaragoza, Real Madrid, Eintracht Frankfurt, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Granada\nCareer Honours: 8\nPotential reached: No\nAnother weird one, because Jesús Vallejo has definitely not reached his potential, but he was contributing for the Real Madrid first team as recently as last season. The first player on this list not to come through Castilla, Jesús gained his hype by captaining Zaragoza whilst still a teenager. A great loan spell and subsequent German cup final with Frankfurt led Madrid fans to believe they had found the next big defender. After initially gaining a first team roster space, a very poor loan in England with Wolves derailed his progress. Currently, he barely plays in La Liga with Granada, and whilst only on loan from Real Madrid - he won’t be at the club for much longer.\nÁlvaro Tejero - 27 (20) - Eibar\nFirst Team appearances: 5 (1 assist)\nClubs: Castilla, Real Madrid, Albecete, Eibar, Real Zaragoza\nCareer Honours: 0\nPotential reached: No\nOne of my favourite Castilla full-backs. The quality he showed whilst with the youth sides convinced me that he was desperate for top level football. Despite playing 21 games in La Liga, he has spent the rest of his career thus far at the top of the second division. He clearly is still a very strong right-back that can play on either flank, bagging seven assists this term for promotion chasing Eibar. His low centre of gravity made him fun to watch going forwards, but unlike many modern full-backs, Álvaro was very switched on defensively. This made him untouchable in the group winning Castilla side of 2015/16, and his first team appearances were really promising as well. He probably only made the starting side because the imminent signing of Théo Hernandez was not yet official, but I hope to see Tejero back in La Liga as soon as possible.\nMateo Kovačić - 29 (23) - Manchester City\nFirst Team appearances: 109 (3 goals, 8 assists)\nClubs: Dinamo Zagreb, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Chelsea, Manchester City\nCareer Honours: 19\nPotential reached: Yes\nSigned for €38 million, made over 100 appearances as a strong back up during a hugely successful era, sold for €45 million. Despite failing to land a place as a starter, Mateo has enjoyed a great career at some of the biggest clubs in the world, and will win way over 20 honours come retirement. One of the best ball carriers from midfield around, it was always unlikely that he was going to break into the Real Madrid midfield, so he made the correct decision to leave at the right time. He doesn’t exactly start for probably the best team in the world right now in Manchester City either, but he certainly contributes.\nMarcos Llorente - 29 (23) - Atlético Madrid\nFirst Team appearances: 39 (2 goals)\nClubs: Castilla, Real Madrid, Deportivo Alaves, Atletico Madrid\nCareer Honours: 4\nPotential reached: Yes\nOut of all of the players not to reach their potential, this name feels like a weird one to put yes next to. I personally do think he could have reached a higher level with his boyhood club Real Madrid after a stellar tenure with Castilla, but on the other hand he has gone on to achieve a lot with the wrong club - rivals Atlético Madrid. One thing I would never have predicted, is the type of player he would go on to become. I couldn’t believe my eyes when the Xabi Alonso-esque passing maestro with Castilla was speeding down the wing at times with Atlético, scoring crucial goals in the Champions League. He has transformed himself into a player that has a little bit of everything and can excel in literally any outfield position, but it remains a real shame to see him do it in the red and white stripes, even if they did pay handsomely for his services.\nMartin Ødegaard - 25 (18) - Arsenal\nFirst Team appearances: 11\nClubs: Stromsgodset, Castilla, Real Madrid, Heerenveen, Vitesse Arnhem, Real Sociedad, Arsenal\nCareer Honours: 2\nPotential reached: No\nStill only 25, the youngest Real Madrid player of all time has become one of the best players in the world in his position, and one of my favourite to watch. It pains me to put a no next to his name, and Real Madrid deserve a share of the blame (11 appearances in six years despite thriving at Castilla and on two of his loans is simply not good enough). The Real Madrid loan system is so questionable, that somehow he was loaned out to one of the only top league teams in Heerenveen that were worse than the third division Castilla side he was leaving behind. However, when you were projected to be the best around at Real Madrid, and you currently are one of the best at Arsenal, then full potential has not been reached. Still, he has a an awful lot of time to reach the very top, and to captain the gunners (and his country) to become one of the best teams in the world after many dormant years is some achievement, and I couldn’t be happier for him. Contrary to popular belief from many uninformed Madradistas, Martin really does have that prestigious and ruthless Real Madrid mentality instilled within him from his time at the club, meaning it wasn’t all for nothing.\nVinícius Júnior - 23 (16) - Real Madrid\nFirst Team appearances: 258 (78 goals and 75 assists)*\nClubs: Flamengo, Real Madrid\nCareer Honours: 10\nPotential reached: Yes\nIt really doesn’t get any better on this list than Vinícius Júnior. The poster boy for the entire youth project, Florentino Pérez couldn’t have dreamt for a better outcome when taking the huge risk to sign a 16 year old Brazilian with no senior experience for a then staggering (now a bargain) €45 million. The winger has become a household name, and another from this roster to develop into one of the best in the world. I had to double take looking at the 258 appearances for the club already, as his time at the club seems to have gone by in a flash. Here’s to the next 258, and the trophies that those appearances will entail.\nMariano Díaz - 30 (23) - Sevilla\nFirst Team appearances: 84 (12 goals and 3 assists)\nClubs: Badalona, Castilla, Real Madrid, Lyon, Sevilla\nCareer Honours: 10\nPotential reached: No\nSo close for Mariano, who had an incredible Castilla career, a tremendous loan to Lyon in France, and a frightening start with Real Madrid - but it all fizzled out far too quickly. He was so impressive abroad, that Real Madrid decided to buy him back and award him the legendary number 7 jersey after Cristiano Ronaldo left. Unlike the masses, I liked the decision to grant the number to a homegrown talent over a world class signing (given that the pressure might be too much for someone with a huge price tag already weighting them down) - - and after his re-debut worldy against Roma in the Champions League I thought that he would go on to reach his potential. But alas, despite scoring a hat-trick at the Bernabéu and a vital, league clinching goal away to Deportivo La Coruña amongst others, he found it hard to break into the team regularly with Karim Benzema ahead of him in the pecking order. Who wouldn’t? The club certainly should have given him more game time when he was in great form, but it was his own fault to stay too long after not being selected for so long, and being stripped of the number 7. To this day that decision has clearly affected his rhythm and match fitness.\nMarco Asensio - 28 (21) - PSG\nFirst Team appearances: 286 (61 goals and 32 assists)\nClubs: Mallorca, Real Madrid, Espanyol, PSG\nCareer Honours: 19\nPotential reached: Yes\nPerhaps the first singing of the entire youth policy, this one was another weird yes for me - because Marco definitely reached his potential, it just wasn’t for as long as expected. After arriving on the cheap and going on to score in a Champions League and SuperCup final all before writing the initial U23 article, but an ACL injury stunted his progress. By the time he left for PSG on a free, it seemed like the best deal for all parties. I’m talking like he is retired, and there isn’t still time to find his best form again, but I doubt he’d be thrilled about how his time at the club ended when at one point it seemed like he would be the one to lead the team to new heights.\nThe Subs\nÁlex Craninx - 28 (21) - Fuenlabrada\nFirst Team appearances: 0\nClubs: Castilla, Sparta Rotterdam, Cartagena, Molde, Lillestrom, RFC Seraing, Fuenlabrada\nCareer Honours: 1\nPotential reached: No\nIf there is any player who sums up the goalkeeping scene at La Fábrica, it’s Álex Craninx. The former Belgian youth international was, and probably still is, a real talent - but due to unlucky timing he couldn’t get in the Castilla side ahead of the stronger Carlos Abad. The highlight of his post-Madrid career came in Norway, winning a league title and playing in Europe with Molde. Since then, he has come full circle as a back-up in the third division, making no further progress sine his Castilla days. Shame, as he would have started for so many other generations, including this current one.\nPhilipp Lienhart - 27 (20) - SC Freiburg\nFirst Team appearances: 1\nClubs: Rapid Wien, Castilla, SC Freiburg\nCareer Honours: 0\nPotential reached: No\nThis one is more of a not yet, as I still have a hunch that he could reach his full potential. Centre-back is another strong position for the Real Madrid conveyor belt, and Philipp Lienhart is right up there with the best Castilla graduates. When not injured, he is a mainstay in the Bundesliga for the impressive Freiburg, and an Austrian international alongside David Alaba. Lienhart could easily start for most top half teams from the top leagues. If he secured a move to a Borussia Dortmund type side, which would be a realistic aspiration, then he would easily go on to be as good as projected back in 2017.\nMario Hermoso - 28 (21) - Atlético Madrid\nFirst Team appearances: 0\nClubs: Castilla, Real Valladolid, Espanyol, Atletico Madrid\nCareer Honours: 1\nPotential reached: Yes\nI was actually surprised to see that Hermoso never made his official Real Madrid debut, instead only playing in friendlies. Mario was a great left-back at Castilla, and it came a shock to see him brought back in 2017 and transformed into a centre-half - but since then he has never looked back. After a great time with Espanyol, it came as another disappointment to see him follow the path of so many others and join arch rivals Atlético Madrid. He’s played at a good level for the inferior Madrid team, and has both reached his potential and become perhaps the best Castilla graduate in his position other than Nacho Fernández.\nFede Valverde - 25 (18) - Real Madrid\nFirst Team appearances: 251 (20 goals, and 23 assists)*\nClubs: Penarol, Castilla, Deportivo La Coruna, Real Madrid\nCareer Honours: 11\nPotential reached: Yes\nWas originally on the bench in favour of more experienced players. He wouldn’t be now. Only the second player on the entire roster to make it at Real Madrid, many have tipped him to become a future club captain. It seems easy to forget just how good he was at Castilla, after being made back home with Peñarol. Castilla still long for the days of such investment to return. The Uruguayan international has become one of the world’s best, and after impressing on loan to Deportivo La Coruña, was slotted straight into the Real Madrid first team. Since then he has won ten trophies with the club, and is set to win many more. What a player.\nAleix Febas - 28 (21) - Elche\nFirst Team appearances: 0\nClubs: Castilla, Real Zaragoza, Albacete, Mallorca, Malaga, Elche\nCareer Honours: 0\nPotential reached: No\nAnother one of my Castilla favourites, Aleix Febas has taken a similar road to Álvaro Tejero. In fact, they both made the second division team of the season whilst with Albacete after leaving Castilla. Aleix also had a short spell in La Liga with Mallorca, starting regularly and showing his best level yet. However, since then he has remained stagnant in the second division, even getting relegated with Málaga last season. This year is looking a lot better for him, as he is a star for La Liga hopeful’s Elche. Hopefully he is back in the top flight as soon as possible, but he still won’t reach his once sky-high ceiling.\nBorja Mayoral - 27 (20) - Getafe\nFirst Team appearances: 33 (7 goals, 4 assists)\nClubs: Castilla, Real Madrid, Wolfsburg, Levante, Roma, Getafe\nCareer Honours: 4\nPotential reached: No\nA striker who really should have been a Real Madrid great. Ridiculous academy statistics, combined with a great Castilla career has propelled Mayoral into a top level career after a stint with the first team. This season has been arguably his best, at one point racing towards the La Liga golden boot with Getafe. Borja is a player that you could envisage taking the Joselu Mato route of aging like fine wine, but for a player who should have been one of the most prolific strikers in Europe, he has not gone as far as he should have.\nSergio Díaz - 26 (19) - Panetolikos\nFirst Team appearances: 0\nClubs: Cerro Porteno, Castilla, CD Lugo, Corinthians, Club America, Panetolikos\nCareer Honours: 1\nPotential reached: No\nIt has recently come to my attention that some people may have no idea who Sergio Díaz is. The Paraguayan prodigy, signed for €5 million from Cerro Porteño alongside Fede Valverde, got off to a far better start than his South American counterpart. The forward went on tour with the first team and looked sharp against the likes of Chelsea. Sadly, by the time of writing the original article, it was very clear to see the damage that Santiago Solari was causing this talent in real time. In a situation that deserves an article all by itself, the Paraguayan international was isolated away from his in-form striker role, and pushed out-wide. This went completely against his talent profile, which was glaringly obvious after the first few games - but Solari lacked, amongst a plethora of things, the basic ability to identify this problem. He genuinely spent the rest of his Castilla career on the wing, adding no further goals or assists to his great start. Despite playing for some massive clubs back in South America, he never found an inch of from or confidence again, and injuries started to make things even worse. He returned back home to Cerro Porteño a poorer player, and fans must have wondered what on earth had happened. His talent alone has allowed him to forge a career, and he currently resides in the Greek first division. However, if he never met Solari I have no doubts that he would have been as big as Fede Valverde, and likely in the Real Madrid first team to this day.\nThe Reserve List\nI jotted down a few players who missed out at the time, including the likes of Raphaël Varane who had just turned 24. For some reason, there was also a potential incomings section highlighting the impending Théo Hernandez, and of course, the inevitable Kylian Mbappé. Below are the last two to mention.\nVíctor Campuzano - 26 (20) Sporting Gijón\nFirst Team appearances: 0\nClubs: Castilla, Espanyol, Sporting Gijon\nCareer Honours: 0\nPotential reached: No\nCampuzano was Castilla’s top scorer at one point, and had a decent amount of ability, but hasn’t been able to cement a place at top level after looking decent at Espanyol at one point.\nÓscar Rodríguez - 25 (18) - Getafe\nFirst Team appearances: 1\nClubs: Castilla, Leganes, Sevilla, Celta Vigo, Getafe\nCareer Honours: 1\nPotential reached: No\nOne of the best dead-ball strikers in the world, Óscar never showed his best level with Castilla. At one point, he was carrying Leganés on his back in La Liga, and after a move to Sevilla looked like he might be a dark horse to realize his potential. Since then, he has been floating around at top level without causing much of a ruckus. Still has the ability to decide matches at top level on his day.\nAt first glance, just two of these players remaining at the club to this day doesn’t look great, but Real Madrid have been so invested in this project that at this point, I could have made multiple full squads with all of the Castilla graduates and external talents brought in since 2014. For every player that failed or didn’t even get a look in such as Alberto Soro, there is a Rodrygo Goes that have either become an overwhelming success, or have gone on to be sold at a profit. The gamble on investing and placing so much trust in young players has ultimately paid off big time. In the near future I will be looking at exploring the stories of some of these individual players, and Castilla squads in a new series. Which player has impressed you the most? And which was the biggest disappointment for you?",
