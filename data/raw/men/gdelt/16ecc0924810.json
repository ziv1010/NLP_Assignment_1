  "body_text": "This is where European advantage can kick in for Newcastle United\nThere is no European football for Newcastle United this season.\nThe shock Man U FA Cup win over Man City, seeing them grab a Europa League spot, despite finishing only eighth in the Premier League.\nThis in turn meant Chelsea who finished sixth, dropped from the Europa League to Conference League.\nWhich in turn, squeezed seventh finishing Newcastle United out of any European football.\nA lot of debate about the benefits of playing in European football at this stage of Newcastle United’s (hopeful) development under ambitious owners.\nI think fair to say that pretty much every Newcastle United fan would say that playing in the Champions League is very much worthwhile, for both football and financial reasons. Yes, there are extra matches to play, but well worth it.\nAs for the Europa League, I think for sure still a sizeable majority would say yes to it. The financial side still decent, even if nowhere near comparable to the Champions League, whilst obviously also one of the higher level competitions on the football side of things. Though the increase to play a guaranteed eight matches, plus very high chance as well of an extra two-legged play-off knockout round at the end of that, meaning that it is an even more full on commitment in terms of travel and matches, without the extra levels of glamour and cash that you get with the Champions League.\nThat leaves us with the Conference League. This was specifically set up so that a lot more clubs from a lot more of the smaller countries/leagues could get European football, many of these smaller clubs/countries tend to often be a lot further away in Eastern Europe and so on, as compared to the clubs you typically face in the Champions League especially. My personal view is that Newcastle United were fortunate to dodge this competition and Chelsea were welcome to it, so many extra matches, so much extra travelling, with the rewards very minimal in comparison. I think Newcastle United fans very split but a majority agreeing with me that certainly with where Newcastle United are now as a club and as a squad, better to not be in it this season.\nSo could the benefits of no European football start kicking in for Newcastle United? As so far we have picked up the three wins, a draw and just one defeat, plus progress in the cup, without any of these results having been against a team that had European commitments either side of our match against them.\nWe are about to find out.\nIn case you didn’t know yet, this is the full Carabao Cup fourth round draw that was made on Wednesday night:\nBrentford v Sheffield Wednesday\nSouthampton v Stoke\nTottenham v Manchester City\nAFC Wimbledon or Newcastle v Chelsea\nManchester United v Leicester\nBrighton v Liverpool\nPreston v Arsenal\nAston Villa v Crystal Palace\nTuesday 1 October 2024:\nAFC Wimbledon v Newcastle United (Sky Sports+)\nAdvantage Newcastle United?\nFast forward to after the October international fortnight.\nNewcastle United’s schedule\nSaturday 19 October – Newcastle v Brighton\nSunday 27 October – Chelsea v Newcastle\nW/C Monday 28 October – AFC Wimbledon or Newcastle v Chelsea\nChelsea’s schedule\nSunday 20 October – Liverpool v Chelsea\nThursday 24 October – Panathinaikos v Chelsa\nSunday 27 October – Chelsea v Newcastle\nW/C Monday 28 October – AFC Wimbledon or Newcastle v Chelsea\nAs you can see, after Brighton, Eddie Howe has eight days to prepare his team for the trip to Chelsea on the Sunday, then if getting through against AFC Wimbledon, United would then play Chelsea at St James’ Park on the Wednesday in the cup.\nIn contrast, after Newcastle last play before the game at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea actually play twice before facing Newcastle in what could be the first of two games against NUFC only three days apart, Eddie Howe’s side having home advantage as well if beating AFC Wimbledon at SJP.\nSo Chelsea are away at Liverpool on the Sunday, I’m guessing then a rest day Monday, train Tuesday, fly to Greece Wednesday, play Thursday night, get back to London on the Friday, train Saturday, play Newcastle on Sunday, rest day Monday, train Tuesday, play at Newcastle (hopefully!) on Wednesday.\nThe extra games and travel due to European football, doesn’t of course then automatically mean the opposition will win any match that follows. However, I think when you look at the two schedules above, you have to think that there is surely a significant positive in Newcastle’s favour. Just then a case of whether they can take advantage of those fine extra margins that run in your favour.\nMy thinking is that so long as we get past AFC Wimbledon, certainly by the time we get to that Wednesday night match under the lights at St James’ Park, a return to the type of high press that blew Chelsea away 4-1 in the Premier League last season, would be something that could potentially lead to a very enjoyable night against our West London mates.\nOn the commitments of European football, following that Chelsea cup match on the Wednesday night (if getting past AFC Wimbledon…), we then face Arsenal on the Saturday, the Gunners having a tough away Champions League match away at Inter Milan on the following midweek.\nAgain, it doesn’t mean that Newcastle United automatically get a win, but for sure, it doesn’t do any harm for NUFC this season when the opposition are having a far heavier workload and travel.\nNovember 2023 saw a very happy St James’ Park, the only two games played there that month were THE 1-0 over Arsenal and then the 4-1 thrashing of Chelsea, that Arsenal win preceded three days earlier with a 3-0 beating of Man U on 1 November at Old Trafford.\nIf Eddie Howe can get his players moving up through the gears after this indifferent start performance-wise, then these largely healthy early positive results can have every chance of getting built on, the possibility is there.\nNewcastle United upcoming match schedule, confirmed to end of November:\nSaturday 28 September 2024 – Newcastle v Man City (12.30 pm) TNT Sports\nTuesday 1 October 2024 – AFC Wimbledon v Newcastle (7.45pm) Sky Sports+ (To be played at St James’ Park)\nSaturday 5 October – Everton v Newcastle (5.30pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 19 October – Newcastle v Brighton (3pm)\nSunday 27 October – Chelsea v Newcastle (2pm) Sky Sports\nW/C Monday 28 October – AFC Wimbledon or Newcastle v Chelsea\nSaturday 2 November – Newcastle v Arsenal (12.30pm) TNT Sports\nSunday 10 November – Forest v Newcastle (2pm) Sky Sports\nMonday 25 November – Newcastle v West Ham (8pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 30 November – Crystal Palace v Newcastle\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
