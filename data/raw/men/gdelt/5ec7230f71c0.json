Villa has eight wins and two draws from their last 10 league games, and Ollie Watkins will be a big test for a defense missing Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane.\nThree consecutive wins have given Liverpool a chance to qualify for Europe and they host Tottenham, who showed a new spirit under Ryan Mason to fight back against Manchester United.\nLiverpool looks to have recovered their high-press, while Harry Kane and Son Heung-min continue to be the Spurs' biggest threat.\nNottingham Forest ended an 11-game run without a win to beat Brighton 3-1 on Wednesday to throw themselves a survival lifeline, but Steve Cooper's men now face a difficult visit to Brentford, who are boosted after their comfortable 2-0 midweek win away to Chelsea.\nBrighton looked drained after their FA Cup exertions last weekend as they capitulated in Nottingham, but should have recovered their legs again in their home game against Wolverhampton.\nThe match promises to pit Brighton's passing game against Wolves' organization, as Brighton chases a place in Europe, while a win would probably assure Wolves is safe from relegation.\nCrystal Palace is on 37 points - the same as the Wolves - after their revival following the return of Roy Hodgson as coach. That revival has stuttered with a draw and a defeat in their last two matches, and they now play West Ham, who has 34 points after their narrow defeat to Liverpool on Wednesday.\nBournemouth's win over Southampton lifted them seven points clear of the bottom three, and they entertain Leeds, who are two places and one point above the drop zone with three defeats and a draw in their last four games.\nLeicester City will test their recovery at home to second from bottom Everton, who has just 25 goals in 33 games.\nArsenal will hope to have defender William Saliba back as they take on a Chelsea side in disarray with five defeats in five games since Frank Lampard returned and no sign of any improvement.\nDisclaimer: This story was supplied by an external content provider; we do not endorse or accept responsibility for its accuracy, completeness, or any outcomes from relying on it.
