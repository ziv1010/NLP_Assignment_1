But unbeknownst to her, it would be the birth of a challenging but highly fulfilling journey.\nFormer KDF officer appeals for job in security after alleged romantic relationship with boss: \"Naelewa sana\"\nIt is a journey that saw Rita Fowler and her husband Geoff come face to face with the difficulties most children in impoverished areas in Kenya face - access to quality education.\nSomewhere along the way, Rita met Jude Bellingham, then a fledgling star at Birmingham and later at Borussia Dortmund. Bellingham's willingness to help Rita in her charity work in Kenya shot Miche Bora Primary School—the school they started—to global fame.\nBut that doesn't even begin to tell the story.\nWhy Miche Bora Primary School was opened in Mombasa\n\"My husband had red hair and burnt very easily, so he wasn't interested in the beach,\" Rita tells us cheekily from the United Kingdom. \"The taxi driver that we'd been using took us to his community.\"\nRita had just retired from teaching while her husband, an engineer, was semi-retired.\n\"We had no idea how to go about it, but we figured that if we put together some resources, we could help.\"\nOn a sunny day in mid-October, we meet Sonery Kavere Edagula in Mombasa, whose first encounter with Rita in 2008 is still fresh in her mind.\n\"I had just lost my job. Where we stayed, the owner had around 30 children whom he used to help, and I decided to chip in. The little room had only one desk where I sat on with the kids sitting on the floor.\"\nAs fate would have it, it is here where Sonery first met Rita and Geoff as she tried to impart knowledge with the few things she had.\n\"I remember Rita came in and I had only one chalk. She talked to us and was very surprised because she wasn't used to such. She promised us she would come back.\"\nBut Sonery didn't believe Rita—and with good reason. Many people had promised to return before, but they didn't—only that Rita was different. To put it simply, Sonery is now the head of the lower school at Miche Bora, the school Rita founded after living up to her promise of coming back.\nFormer KDF officer narrates how alleged romantic relationship with boss led to her dismissal from military\nMiche Bora is a Swahili term which can be loosely translated to mean good seedlings or good foundation.\nMiche Bora Primary - the start-up\nWith limited resources, a passion for helping, and unfamiliar territory, Rita and her husband started with 17 children in someone else's school. They moved to different rental locations but eventually made plans to build their own place.\n\"In 2014, we couldn't get any more accommodation we needed to build somewhere. At this point, we are a registered charity (Mustard Seed) in the UK and through the writing of bids and holding fundraising events, we managed to build the first part of our building, which had four classrooms and three toilets.\"\nRita and her husband footed all the bills from the start, including overhead expenses like employee salaries and rental charges. She even took Sonery back to school to complete her teaching certification.\nJude Bellingham helps build school in Mombasa, Kenya\nAs the school grew, so did the need for more resources. Enter Jude Bellingham. Bellingham was introduced to Rita and Geoff when he was just 15.\n\"He is a nice guy. They're just ordinary people, and they just wanted to be able to give back. His father, Mark, was working with my daughter, so he introduced us.\"\nBellingham and his father shared a couple of tweets on their X accounts to ask for financial support to build the school.\n\"Join us in donating for the students in our Mombasa located school if you can, all sums are doubled as part of ‘The Big Give’ Christmas challenge. Any amount is greatly appreciated. Thank you,\" read one of the posts on his X account.\nJude Bellingham at Real Madrid and Ballon d'Or ambitions\nBellingham had captured everyone's attention at that time as this hot English prospect who went to chase his dreams in Germany. Rita admits that she isn't as much of a football fan as her late husband, but she made a point of watching Bellingham play once in a while.\n\"My husband was the person who followed football, and he supported Leeds. While he was alive, Jude was at Borussia Dortmund, and I used to watch Jude play. Even I could tell he was a good footballer.\"\n2024 Ballon d'Or Award\nWell, she wasn't wrong. A couple of years later since their first meet-up, Bellingham has risen brilliantly to the highest echelons a football player could dream of. At only 21, he has already won the Champions League, reached the Euro final with England and is in line for a podium finish at the 2024 Ballon d'Or awards.\nApart from the financial support, Bellingham also sent merchandise to the children.\n\"The children are football mad, and when they knew Jude was supporting us, they went wild!!. To them, football presents an opportunity to escape poverty and other harsh realities of this community.\"\nRita is eternally grateful for the support she received from Bellingham's family and everyone who has ever contributed.\nImpact on the community\nThe impact the school has made in the surrounding community cannot be overstated. The school is located in an area characterised by high truancy, disheartening poverty levels and rampant drug abuse.\n\"Our children here are well catered for,\" Sonery says proudly, \"Apart from the learning resources, they have lunch and porridge. Most children in this community are struggling, and at times, this porridge might be the difference between having something to eat and going hungry.\"\nApart from the children, the school also feeds some of the families around and avails its property for barazas or chamas (public meetings) if need be.\nDrug and substance abuse in Mombasa\nA worrying 2016 report done by the National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (NACADA) showed that at least 45% of Coastal Residents abuse substances in their lifetime.\n\"We have a lot of idle people around, which often leads to substance abuse. The children are safer in our school. Our girls are also taken through the correct hygienic practices when they start their periods. They have been taught how to take care of themselves, and sometimes, we have organisations who bring sanitary towels.\"\nI asked Rita whether the progress the school has made was what she had in mind when she started the journey back in 2009.\n\"It is a learning process every day. It is really hard to quantify it, but we have achieved a lot. The so-called free education in Kenya doesn't exist because many of the parents still cannot afford it. Seeing how much difference it's made, that's just great for me.\"\nRacial stereotypes and the challenges\nBut even in her high moments, Rita has encountered some bottlenecks like every success story out there. She narrates that her skin colour and the corruption levels in the country have impeded her times without number when she is looking for permits.\n\"People always assume that because I am a Mzungu (white person), I am very rich. There's that assumption. People have tried to get bribes along the way and made things very difficult for us.\"\nRita has steadily equipped the school as more funds come along. She secured a piece of land around two minutes away from the main school compound, which the children now use as a playground. Plans are underway to develop it further.\nHow many children does Miche Bora have?\nMiche Bora Primary School currently houses over 300 children aged 3 to 15. The pioneer class of 2009 is now in the university. The school has conformed to the constant changes in Kenya's education sector, such as the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC), which brought the Junior Secondary School (JSS).\n\"All this has been possible because of Rita and her late husband. I don't even want to imagine where we would be as a community if our paths hadn't crossed in 2008,\"\nPhilanthropy is not about money; it's about feeling the pain of others and caring enough about their needs to help - Timothy Pina.\nSource: TUKO.co.ke",
