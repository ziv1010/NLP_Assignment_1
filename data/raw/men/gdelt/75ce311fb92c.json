  "body_text": "Brighton 2 Newcastle 1 – Match ratings and comments on all Newcastle United players\nWe asked Sam Hepworth to give us his match ratings and player comments after Brighton 2 Newcastle 1.\nNick Pope 7\nContinues his very good start to the season.\nGiven no chance with either goal and made some smart saves and swept really well behind his defence.\nKieran Trippier 6.5\nA decent performance and in the final half hour or so when United began to get some control, Trippier was involved in most of the best attacking moves down the right.\nMalick Thiaw 6\nThe central defenders did well overall but must share most of the blame for the opening goal. They drifted too far apart and gave Welback the space and opportunity for his admittedly top class finish.\nI think Thiaw and Botman have done well as a partnership and not suggesting any change is made.\nHowever, I am thinking that we miss Fabian Schar’s ability to pass long out of defence, as well as bringing the ball forward. I don’t think Thiaw is poor on the ball, just that Schar is so excellent with it.\nSven Botman 6\nSee Thiaw comments when it came to the defending today. Played well generally but not great on the opening goal.\nDan Burn 5.5\nI thought he stuck at it and did ok.\nMinteh got the better of him a couple of times but Burn did alright generally at the back. Got forward a bit and one excellent low ball across the ball saw Thiaw get there just too late, should have thrown himself at it and likely would have scored.\nBruno Guimaraes 6.5\nThe best of our midfield trio today.\nLike the rest of the team, nothing much to shout about first half. However, as Newcastle started to get into the game, Bruno was helping to make things happen and made some good turns and carries with the ball.\nSandro Tonali 5.5\nNot one of his best games. Maybe playing so much football catching up with him a little bit. Could have maybe done better in the build up to the first goal as Brighton cut through the middle of our midfield too easy, Tonali also losing possession in midfield shortly after that but the Brighton player blazing the ball over the bar.\nJoelinton 4\nFeel a bit guilty giving such a low score for a player who has given us so much.\nHowever…the truth is that these kind of matches aren’t becoming such a rarity.\nAt times he is of course still the Joelinton reaching heights of what he used to do so regularly, but then games like today where he looks so off the pace and struggles to contribute much of anything. I certainly wouldn’t be blaming the first half performance only on him, but I do think as well that at times he is such a weak link when Newcastle are trying to pass and move to get play up to the opposition penalty area.\nAnthony Elanga 4\nDidn’t really contribute anything of note.\nHas played well in both Champions League matches when maybe getting a bit more space where he could use his pace. Still to reach those levels in the Premier League for NUFC.\nNick Woltemade 7.5\nWhat a sublime finish with a flick of his heel, worthy of winning any match and so unlucky to be on the losing side.\nHe wasn’t good in the first half but then when you rarely get the ball and not much support, any forward struggles.\nNewcastle still not totally working out the best way to get the best out of the striker, though with the help of the subs changing things in the second half, once United started getting it into Big Nick’s feet he really comes alive.\nGreat control and clever lay-offs, plus better balls into the box, especially from the right side, Woltemade suddenly looking so dangerous. Should have done better with a great heading chance just before half-time but otherwise no real negatives, if you play to his strengths!\nAnthony Gordon 6\nNot saying much but Newcastle’s best attacking threat in the opening half. I think overall he did pretty well with what he got in terms of positions when he was in possession, made some good turns and looked to try and unsettle Brighton with some one-twos, but lack of movement from others not doing him any favours.\nSubs:\nJacob Murphy 7\nUnited looked much better on the right side as the match moved on in the second half, some decent crosses and good interplay with others. Difficult on today’s performances to suggest Elanga should get in ahead of Murphy.\nHarvey Barnes 6\nDid ok when coming on and with the game opening up, I think this is Barnes’ biggest strength, as an impact sub against a tiring opposition.\nLewis Miley 6\nAnother who did pretty well off the bench. Keeps the ball well and made runs forward a bit more today, one of those saw him get an assist as his low pass was brilliantly put away by Woltemade’s heel.\nJacob Ramsey 6\nSo unlucky to get injured by Sean Longstaff so early in his NUFC career in the draw at Leeds. I think he will be a real asset to United and as he gets to full match fitness he will be looking to start. A player who can carry the ball and be an attacking threat, I think he can be part of a more attack-minded Newcastle team once he gets up to speed.\nWilliam Osula N/A\nNot on long enough to judge.\nBrighton 2 Newcastle 1 – Saturday 18 October 2025 3pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nWoltemade 76\nBrighton:\nWelbeck 41, 85\nPossession was Newcastle 54% Brighton 46%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 16 Brighton 13\nShots on target were Newcastle 3 Brighton 5\nCorners were Newcastle 4 Brighton 8\nTouches in the box Newcastle 25 Brighton 29\nNewcastle team v Brighton:\nPope, Trippier, Thiaw, Botman, Burn, Bruno (Osula 86), Joelinton (Miley 46), Tonali (Ramsey 70), Gordon (Barnes 70), Woltemade, Elanga (Murphy 46)\nUnused subs:\nRamsdale, Krafth, Willock, Schar\n(Brighton 2 Newcastle 1 – Instant Newcastle United fan/writer reaction – Read HERE)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
