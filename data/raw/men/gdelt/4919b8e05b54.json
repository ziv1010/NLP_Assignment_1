Despite notching 64 goals for Juventus, recent injury setbacks and a loss of favour under the current management have seen his influence wane.\nRenewal discussions with Juventus have stalled for months, with sources indicating the club proposed adjustments to his substantial €12million (£10.4m / $14.3m) annual salary that Vlahovic has been unwilling to accept. Juventus officials remain hopeful of a resolution but have agreed to park talks until the season concludes, leaving the door wide open for an exit without a transfer fee.\nVlahovic has long harboured ambitions of testing himself in England, a desire that has grown stronger in recent years. Tottenham are monitoring his situation alongside Chelsea.\nSpurs view the powerful forward as a potential long-term solution to lead their attack, given his physical presence and proven finishing ability. However, the North London club face challenges in pursuing such a move. Their current campaign has been poor and Thomas Frank has been sacked, raising questions over squad reorganisation and they cannot guarantee Champions League football next term – a key priority for Vlahovic. Without European elite competition assured, the move could lose appeal.\nChelsea, under Liam Rosenior, are considering a move for a new striker this summer amid uncertainty surrounding Liam Delap. We revealed on February 7 that Delap is effectively playing for his future at Stamford Bridge, with five clubs keeping an eye on his situation. The signing of a new forward hasn’t been ruled out, even with Emanuel Emegha being set to arrive from Strasbourg next season, and Vlahovic is on their radar.\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?

The Red Devils invested heavily in young Slovenian talent Benjamin Sesko last summer, securing his services on a long-term deal.\nSesko has settled fairly well at Old Trafford, contributing goals and demonstrating significant potential. United are prioritising his continued development rather than adding another established centre-forward that might limit his opportunities.\nOther Premier League sides, including Newcastle United, have made preliminary enquiries, though sources suggest the Magpies would need to secure Champions League qualification to seriously tempt the Serbia international.\nHigh agent commissions and Vlahovic’s wage expectations – coupled with potential signing bonuses – mean any deal would carry a hefty financial commitment despite the zero transfer fee.\nAs the campaign progresses and Vlahovic edges closer to free agency, his Premier League desire remains strong but there are many pieces that need to fall into place for him to realise his desires.\nWith Chelsea in with a chance of Champions League qualification and side showing interest in Vlahovic, they appear to be his most likely destination at this stage – but things could still change.\nLatest Chelsea news: Ex-Blues star snubbed / Big Baleba update\nMeanwhile, former Chelsea star Antonio Rudiger is considering returning to the Premier League from Real Madrid in the summer, and the Blues have been offered the chance to re-sign him.\nHowever, we understand that BlueCo are not considering a move for Rudiger, though Tottenham, Crystal Palace and West Ham could all be tempted to move for the 32-year-old.\nIn other news, Chelsea are now considered frontrunners to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, alongside Paris Saint-Germain, as we revealed on February 9.\nMan Utd have been left trailing in the race, though it will take a huge fee to lure him from the Seagulls this summer.\nGet the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.",
