I don’t think it’s normal to have beer thrown at you.\n“But we’re in a third semi-final in four tournaments, and I think we continue to give people fantastic memories. So, we’ll keep grinding, we’ll keep fighting, and we’ll keep enjoying this journey.”\nMemories made. More to make! 💪 pic.twitter.com/o9GTfr2u4R\n— England (@England) July 7, 2024\nEngland now take on the Netherlands in Wednesday’s Signal Iduna Park semi-final looking to make back-to-back European Championship finals and ultimately go one better than three years ago.\nAn improved performance is needed if they are to make next Sunday’s Berlin showpiece, but Southgate dismissed those criticising his team’s displays.\nPut to him that England, like fellow semi-finalists France, have not been “easy on the eye”, he retorted: “Well, I’m sorry for that, but our intention is always to play well with the ball.\n“In football you have an opponent that’s trying to stop you, and these are not normal football matches.\n“These are national events with huge pressure, with really young men in the middle of it. Our team has been under enormous pressure from the start and they’re doing so well. So well.\n“I thought they showed moments. I think Phil (Foden) had one of his best games for us, looked really free.\n“We’re not able to score a load of goals at the moment, but, again, we’ve played three teams that play back five, very well organised defences.\n“Pitches are a little bit bobbly, so you sometimes need the extra touch, and as you have the extra touch the space is gone.\n“None of it is easy. None of this stuff is easy. But we’re in a third semi-final in four tournaments, and for the staff and players that have been involved in all of that, that’s a pretty good achievement. But it’s not where we want it to end.”\nSpain or France will provide stern opposition if England can overcome the Netherlands, who are the highest-ranked side they have faced at Euro 2024.\nTalk of easy runs at this edition and the last one three years ago rankles with Southgate, who hit back at a reporter who began listing England’s so-called lesser Euros opponents.\nHe even interjected when the journalist dismissed beating a “poor” Germany in the Euro 2020 last 16, saying : “A poor German team? It had about eight Champions League winners in, yeah?”\nOnce the reporter stood his ground and ended his lengthy question, Southgate said: “Are you sure you’re not English? You’re German?\n“Look, the teams we played are because we won our group. If you go back through history, England had different routes to the final because they didn’t win their group.\n“Of course, you’d rather not have to jump the Grand National to win the tournament.\n“Most teams when you have back-to-back games, two, three, four games against big nations, the margins are so fine and in the end those games end up really quite even.\n“You win one, you lose one, you draw one, so it’s very, very tough to go through those processes.\n“I’m not really sure what to say. It’s the madness of this job, but we’ve had an enjoyable night, and I’m going to try and keep it enjoyable if that’s OK.”",
