Especially as they pipped Liverpool to the top four.\nErik ten Hag will be able to use this to his advantage as both sides are interested in a deal for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi.\nLiverpool’s interest in the defender had been clarified in recent weeks. Jurgen Klopp is keen to add another defender to his ranks this summer.\nWhile Liverpool are interested in Guehi, missing out on Champions League football could have them behind Man Utd in the transfer pecking order this summer.\nMan Utd are also wanting to add another defender to their ranks and he ticks a lot of boxes. According to the latest reports, Man Utd seem most interested in the Palace star.\n“The excellent season of Marc Guehi at Crystal Palace has attracted, for sure, interest from many European clubs,” Rudy Galetti told GiveMeSport.\n“And at the moment, the most concrete one is Manchester United, the team that is monitoring him more closely and that are planning at least two incoming moves to strengthen in the defence in the summer.”\nThe 22-year-old is said to be valued at around £50m. Whatever Palace deem his value as, they are bound to make a healthy profit on the original £18m they spent two years ago.\nGuehi ticks a lot of boxes\nThere are expected to be plenty of moving parts this summer at Old Trafford. The likes of Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly could all depart.\nWith Phil Jones also set to leave, they will need to sign a handful of defenders to maintain the depth of the squad.\nGuehi would be a much younger alternative to those departing and he would push Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane for a starting spot.\nGiven how injury-prone Varane has been since arriving in Manchester, a competent backup for him makes sense.\nOf course, Man Utd are also exploring other targets alongside the Crystal Palace defender. A move for Napoli star Kim Min-jae is also said to be close.\nThe Napoli star has a release clause of around £54m and Man Utd are said to be ironing out the final details to land the defender.\nWhile the Red Devils have kept a record 17 clean sheets in the Premier League this season, their backline has looked fragile at times.\nAfter shipping several goals against the likes of Liverpool, Brentford and Manchester City it became clear that they needed to bolster their squad in this position.\nLanding a defender or two this summer will go a long way in improving Ten Hag’s side. With the lure of Champions League football too, they can be ambitious in who they target.\nREAD MORE: Man Utd set to beat Liverpool, Arsenal to £55m Chelsea signing thanks to Ten Hag brilliance",
