  "body_text": "Michael Owen believes Rasmus Hojlund can go on to become a ‘fantastic player’ and feels the huge fee Manchester United paid for him is symptomatic of a lack of proven goal-scorers available in the transfer market.\nHojlund arrived at Old Trafford from Atalanta over the summer for an initial £64m, which took some by surprise given his goal-scoring record previously.\nStill only 20 years old so with plenty of time for improvement, Hojlund scored 10 goals in 34 games for Atalanta over his brief stint with the Italian club.\nBefore that he scored five in 32 for Copenhagen and 12 in 21 for Austrian outfit Sturm Graz. Solid, if not breathtaking numbers.\nNevertheless, the Red Devils liked what they saw and Hojlund does indeed look bright, with pace and power but has struggled for goals so far in a United shirt.\nThe Denmark international is yet to score in seven Premier League games, although he has netted three times in three games in the Champions League.\nOwen reckons that the hefty price tag is not surprising given Hojlund’s potential to become a great goal-scorer, and the lack of players who could be classed in that category at the moment.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘The hardest position to play, and the hardest thing to do in football is to score a goal and to score lots of them is obviously something that every team wants and every team needs,’ Owen told AceOdds.com.\nMore Trending\n‘The minute anybody’s going to show any progress or any potential, then there’s going to be such an inflated number on them because they can be the difference between mediocrity and a great team.\n‘Centre forward players, it’s pure instinct. It’s knowing your job and being able to do it under the highest of pressure. There is such a dearth of top centre forwards that are guaranteeing goals around the world, then, you know, when one becomes available, somebody will pay over the odds for the player. And that’s where we are.\n‘I’m sure there’s lots of clubs around at the moment would die for a striker that can score loads of goals, but they’re just not about, and all of a sudden somebody shows a little bit of promise and massive numbers are spent just in case that person is going to be able to carry them for the next 10 years.\n‘And Manchester United have obviously done their homework. He does appear to be somebody that could be a fantastic player in the future. But you normally associate spending that kind of money on somebody that’s going to guarantee you 30 goals every season.\n‘Yes, they’ve got to pay through the nose for a kid, but they haven’t paid hundreds of millions. So it’s only what happens in business all the time. If somebody’s young and looks like they could be good, there’s a premium to pay.’\nMORE: Erik ten Hag explains Rasmus Hojlund decision that was met with boos at Old Trafford\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
