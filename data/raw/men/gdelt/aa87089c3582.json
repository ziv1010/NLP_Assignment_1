For years to come fans recall the starting XIs, the squads, the managers, the run - everything.\"\nHow to follow FA Cup semi-finals on the BBC\n- Published25 April 2025\nBBC to show Crystal Palace-Aston Villa semi-final\n- Published4 April 2025\nMajor trophy - or Champions League cash?\nThis season's FA Cup has produced its fair share of surprises leading to a somewhat unfamiliar look to this weekend's semi-finals.\nRecord 14-time winners Arsenal went out in the third round, Premier League champions-in-waiting Liverpool came unstuck at Plymouth in the fourth round, while last season's winners Manchester United lost on penalties to Fulham at Old Trafford in the fifth round.\nCrystal Palace are the only one of the four remaining teams not to have won the FA Cup.\nBut while Manchester City have won two of the past six finals, it's been more than 60 years since Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest lifted the prestigious trophy.\nVilla might be seven-time winners but their last FA Cup triumph was in 1956-57.\nTwo-time winners Forest have won the European Cup on two occasions since they last won the FA Cup win in 1958-59.\nThe FA Cup final, watched by a global television audience of millions, is full of pomp and prestige, while the winners get to claim a major trophy in front of their fans at the national stadium.\nFrom a financial point of view, however, it is small change compared to the riches of the Champions League.\nFA Cup semi-final: Crystal Palace v Aston Villa\nSaturday, 26 April at 17:15 BST\nWembley\nWatch on BBC iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and app; listen to live commentary on BBC Sounds\n'Winning the FA Cup is eternal'\nAston Villa have earned a total of £910,000 in FA prize money for defeating West Ham, Tottenham, Cardiff and Preston in this season's FA Cup. They received £8.85m for winning five Champions League league-phase games this season.\nWhile reaching the Champions League last 16 also earned clubs an additional £9.27m each, Villa, Forest, City or Crystal Palace will receive just £2m in prize money if they win next month's FA Cup final.\nForest's last match in European football's premier club competition was in October 1980 when it was known as the European Cup before being rebranded the Champions League.\nWith five games to play, Nuno Espirito Santo's team sit fourth in the Premier League table with a three-point cushion between themselves and sixth-placed Chelsea.\n\"I want to be an FA Cup romantic, but Champions League football would provide such a big windfall that it offers a much better opportunity for establishing a strong foundation for future success,\" Forest fan Ben tells BBC Sport.\nFellow Forest fan Simon has a different view.\n\"Yes, European football brings in cash. But winning a cup is eternal,\" he says.\n\"Look at the joy of Newcastle fans - they will remember this year more fondly than the year they made the top four.\"\nOnuoha adds: \"These are pinch-yourself moments for the Forest fans and if they get one and not the other, they can decide how they feel about that afterwards.\"\n'We play to be in the top five'\nVilla are desperate for more more big European nights under the floodlights after memorable wins over the likes of Bayern Munich, Bologna and Celtic.\nHaving lost 5-4 on aggregate to Paris St-Germain in the quarter-finals, Unai Emery's side must finish in the top five to play in next season's Champions League.\nThey currently lie seventh, two points off fifth having played one game more than the three teams immediately above them. Their goal difference is also inferior compared to their rivals.\nVilla, however, are two wins from a first major trophy since Brian Little's team defeated Leeds United in the 1996 League Cup final.\nDo they go all-out to win the FA Cup - or make finishing in the top five the priority?\n\"Of course the Premier League is our priority,\" said Villa boss Emery after his team's 2-1 league defeat at Manchester City on Tuesday.\n\"We play in the Premier League to be in the top five.\"\nThis weekend Villa will play in their first FA Cup semi-final for 10 years and more than 30,000 of their fans are expected to be at Wembley to see them play Palace.\nEmery added: \"It's special to play in semi-finals. It's something we achieved with hard work. Now we must continue it.\"\nOnuoha believes the FA Cup semi-final is Villa's biggest game of the season.\n\"We saw with Newcastle what seeing your team lift silverware can mean to supporters and sometimes it's a once in a lifetime type thing,\" he added.\n\"Villa will want a chance to try and lift the trophy. You could very much make the case that it is the biggest game of their whole season so far.\n\"I think at times it is maybe taken for granted in this modern age of the financial power of Champions League qualification.\n\"The game is massive, the players will know it's massive, all those fans travelling down to Wembley will know it's massive.\n\"You can say the whole season could ride on this semi-final, and in some ways maybe it does. But isn't that always the case when you get a chance to play for silverware?\"\n'Important to win semi-final - but Champions League is main goal'\nIncredibly, this is the seventh successive season Manchester City have appeared at this stage of the FA Cup.\nThey've gone on to reach three finals, winning two of them in 2019 and 2023.\nYet missing out on the Champions League would be a huge blow for City and manager Pep Guardiola, who said \"we haven't done anything special with just one\" after being crowned champions of Europe for the first time in 2023.\nCity sit third in the table on 61 points, four more than sixth-placed Chelsea, who have one game in hand.\n\"Guardiola has spent a lot of this season making the point about how good this team has been in years gone by - like reaching seven FA Cup semi-finals in a row,\" said Onuoha.\n\"Many teams have not reached seven in their whole history so he has been more defiant in how he speaks about his team.\n\"He wants to make sure that people understand where he is coming from, where the club is coming from, how good they have been in years gone by, and how he still believes in the team.\"\nThe last time City failed to appear in the Champions League was way back in 2010-11 and Portuguese midfielder Matheus Nunes said qualifying for the competition was the number one priority in the final weeks of the season.\n\"It's important to go and win the semi-final, but I think our main goal is the Premier League, to try to qualify for the Champions League,\" Nunes said after the midweek league win over Villa.\n\"We are not looking to the FA Cup as a secondary thing, but our main focus is to win the remaining four league games.\"\n- Published16 August 2025",
