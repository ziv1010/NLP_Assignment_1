  "body_text": "Luis Rubiales confirmed his resignation as president of the Spanish football association on Sunday, Sept. 10.\nThe last thing UEFA wanted to talk about at the annual launch of its club competitions this week was the only thing everyone else has been talking about.\nSo, you could argue it was a case of mission accomplished for European football’s governing body in Monaco, as nobody — not with a microphone, anyway — said “Luis Rubiales”. But it would equally be true to say that the fate of the Spanish FA chief was the first topic of every conversation.\nAdvertisement\nWednesday was arrivals day on the French Riviera and for every journalist the task was simple: ask UEFA chief Aleksander Ceferin why he had not spoken publicly about the scandal.\nCeferin, however, saw us coming because no sooner did we spot him in the lobby of UEFA’s hotel than we were told the wily Slovene had just given the scoop to L’Equipe.\nUnderwhelmed would be a fair description of the reaction to the interview, as Ceferin had told the French outlet that the UEFA vice-president’s behaviour had been “inappropriate” but there was no point in suspending him, as FIFA had got there first. Everyone, said Ceferin, would just have to wait for the independent disciplinary process to run its course.\nInappropriate?!? This is the guy who called European Super League ringleader Andrea Agnelli “a snake” and said he was less trustworthy than the criminals he used to prosecute as a criminal lawyer in Slovenia.\nHowever, the private messages to the Spanish FA from UEFA have been more robust. It seems that Rubiales’ refusal to quit took his colleagues on UEFA’s executive committee by surprise and his The Wolf of Wall Street-like “I’m not leaving” speech has scuppered any chances of him being quietly found a job elsewhere in the game. Only his mother loves him now.\nThis became obvious during the awards section of Thursday evening’s Champions League draw.\nFirst, England manager Sarina Weigman used her acceptance speech for the women’s Coach of the Year prize to hail Spain’s World Cup winners and say “they deserve to be listened to”. She then put her trophy on the floor and led the auditorium in a round of applause for women’s football and the extinction of dinosaurs.\nThen, Barcelona and Spain star Aitana Bonmati, the winner of the women’s Player of the Year prize, seized her chance. She said Rubiales had ruined Spain’s moment with his “disrespectful” behaviour and “abuse of power” and that she wanted her team-mate Jenni Hermoso, the recipient of Rubiales’ unsolicited kiss, to know “we are with you”.\nAdvertisement\nThe co-presenters of the show, Reshmin Chowdhury and Pedro Pinto, only found out what she was going to say while the rest of us watched men’s winner Erling Haaland’s highlight reel. They asked if she was going to speak English or Spanish and if she wanted a question about Rubiales. Bonmati, who speaks fluent English, told them she was going to speak Spanish and she had something to say. Chowdhury then presented her with an open goal and Bonmati did the rest.\nLater on, in the post-ceremony press conference, Bonmati answered every question in English apart from the inevitable Rubiales-related one for which she switched back to Spanish and repeated what she said in her acceptance speech. She wanted everyone back home to understand that Spain’s World Cup winners were not backing down.\nSchmeichel’s relaxed approach to finding new club\nHard though this might be to believe, an even more controversial individual than Rubiales dominated conversations at the post-draw party.\nFor reasons that remain unclear, someone booked a very convincing Michael Jackson impersonator, and his loud backing group, to do a 30-minute medley of the King of Pop’s greatest hits.\nA few in the room enjoyed the tribute act’s performance almost as much as the tribute act did themselves but the majority were left shouting in each other’s ears to ask if this was, you know, “a bit weird”.\nLike Rubiales, some thought the booking was “inappropriate”, while others shrugged and said “only in Monaco”.\nThe wisdom of this take was underlined when a group of guests moved to the post-draw party after-party at a bar across the road. First song they heard? “Dirty Diana”.\nSitting in the VVIP section of this bar — Monaco institution the Sass Cafe — was local resident Kasper Schmeichel.\nHe did not weigh into the Jackson debate but he did say he was now a free agent and looking for a club. A football club.\nAdvertisement\nSaudi Arabia get the silent treatment\nDo you know what was not talked about much, though? The prospect of Saudi Arabian clubs one day coming along to a UEFA draw.\nThe reason for this is that The Athletic did not speak to a single UEFA delegate or club official who thought it would happen. And most of them used less diplomatic language than that.\nWhen asked why, various reasons spilled out: no financial fair play rules, their teams are rubbish, they have their own Champions League and so on.\nIn fact, if you were to characterise how European football feels about the Saudi football revolution it would appear to be: “Am I bothered?”\nNow, some of you will read this, put it down to European arrogance and remember to remind us about this when Al Nassr beat Real Madrid in the 2030 Champions League final in Riyadh. But others will look at the global reach of the Champions League, remember the North American Soccer League and Chinese Super League booms, and think: yeah, I just don’t see UEFA caving in.\nAnd that is the view from the top of UEFA, where Ceferin makes little effort to hide his scepticism of Saudi Arabia’s sporting ambitions. No Saudi sides in European club competitions, no UEFA finals in Saudi Arabia, no joint Saudi/UEFA bids for World Cups. Not on his watch, anyway.\nThere are some more commercially minded people in European football, though, who wish Ceferin could be a bit more diplomatic. After all, you never know, right? Perhaps the SPL is for real.\nAshworth leaves Gulf politics to the bosses\nThere is one thing that Saudi Arabia could do to convince UEFA it is willing to play the same game as everyone else: let fans in the kingdom watch legal streams of Champions League matches.\nIf you were under the impression that Saudi Arabia’s attempts to bankrupt Qatari broadcaster beIN were a thing of the past and the Gulf neighbours were friends again, well, they are and they aren’t. It’s complicated.\nAdvertisement\nIt is true that the state-sponsored piracy operation beoutQ has been shut down and beIN’s satellite TV service is operating legally in Saudi Arabia again, but TOD, beIN’s newish streaming service for the Middle East and North Africa, remains banned.\nSo, when Newcastle United were drawn in the same Champions League group as Paris Saint-Germain, there were a few in the room who wondered if this might be a good time for the Saudi government to let its people use the only legal streaming platform for most premium sport in the region.\nThat was a niche observation, though, as most people reacted to the Group F selection of PSG, Borussia Dortmund, AC Milan and Newcastle in exactly the same way as the latter’s sporting director Dan Ashworth.\nWhen asked by reporters after the draw if getting PSG added an extra pinch of spice, Ashworth looked completely stumped.\n“Qatar versus Saudi Arabia,” we prompted.\n“Oh, I hadn’t thought about that,” said Ashworth. “I was just thinking about it in a football context.”\nAnd rightly so. Best leave the Gulf politics to the bosses.\nHaaland says ‘scary Pep’ puts things in his brain ‘I don’t think I have’\nSpeaking of elite operators for state-sponsored enterprises, Haaland was a popular winner of the men’s player of the year award.\nFirst, the 23-year-old made the audience in the auditorium laugh by telling them that Pep Guardiola and his father Alfie can be “a bit scary” but he likes it when Guardiola shouts at him because the Manchester City manager is trying to put “something in my brain that he doesn’t think I have”.\nAnd then the Norway striker made the written media giggle by explaining to them how he got so good at scoring goals.\n“When I was young watching football, I saw the people celebrating a goal and I thought ‘I would love this to be me’,” he said.\n“So it seemed natural to me to become a striker, as the striker scores the most goals. I would practise my celebrations when I played on my own. And then, with my friends, I would score a lot and practise the other type of celebration.\nAdvertisement\n“I don’t think I was born with it. I’ve been working on it a lot and it’s become natural. I just love the feeling and that’s why I do it.”\nAnd with that, the goal machine left for the helicopter transfer back to Nice airport and private jet to Manchester that UEFA had laid on in order to get him there. After all, he would be shouted at if he missed training on Friday morning.\nNo time wasted in dig at FIFA\nOf course, it would not have been a UEFA event without a dig at FIFA, and it got that out of the way on Wednesday, before most people had arrived.\nThat was when UEFA’s chief of football, former Milan and Croatia star Zvonimir Boban, piped up from the front row of a presentation by Roberto Rosetti, the chairman of the referees’ committee, to call FIFA-style injury time “absurd” and say that referees would not be adding 15 minutes of it to Champions League games.\nNow, a cynic might suggest that if FIFA was pushing for the abolition of added time, UEFA would be telling referees to add 30 seconds for each throw-in, but Boban and Rosetti had the data to suggest that UEFA’s way — telling everyone to hurry up a bit and not blowing the whistle so much in the first place — might be the best approach.\nLast season, Champions League games featured fewer fouls on average than games in the top divisions in England, Italy, France, Germany, Portugal and Spain, but five extra minutes of effective playing time than the best of the rest, the Bundesliga, and over six minutes more than La Liga and the Premier League.\nBerlin next up for meetings over money\nIf this week in Monaco was largely about the matches, there is another meeting in Berlin next week that will deal with the money.\nThe European Club Association’s 30th general assembly will feature many of the same names and faces as UEFA’s official launch of its club competitions but there will be more workshops and fewer fireworks.\nAdvertisement\nThe main decisions will be about what is known in the jargon as ‘the distribution’, or how the billions UEFA makes in media rights every year get carved up.\nNo spoilers — we will deal with this absolutely fundamental issue in detail next week. When asked for a steer on how the negotiations were going, The Athletic was assured that the ECA and UEFA were confident they would achieve their goal of upsetting everyone equally.\nBut as a final thought to underline just how important European football is to clubs across the continent, you will never see a more nervous viewer of a midweek match in August than the owner or chief executive of a club playing a qualifying round for the Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League.\nSome arrived at the draw on Thursday evening looking like they had just won one of the sports cars conveniently parked outside the Casino de Monte-Carlo, while others wore the expressions of those left with the drinks bill after a night in Sass.",
