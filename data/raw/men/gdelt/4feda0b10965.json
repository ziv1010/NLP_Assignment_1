He has started just six Premier League games and played fewer than 300 minutes in all competitions last season before suffering a serious knee injury.\nTwo years remain on the contract Van de Beek signed upon his arrival, while United also have the option of triggering a 12-month extension.\nLISTEN NOW TO 90MIN'S TALKING TRANSFERS PODCAST\nOn this edition of Talking Transfers, part of the 90min podcast network, Scott Saunders is joined by Graeme Bailey to discuss Al Ittihad's attempts to sign Mohamed Salah, Jadon Sancho's Man Utd future, the players that could still leave the Premier League and more!\nIf you can't see this embed, click here to listen to the podcast!",
