  "body_text": "Manchester United’s shocking season has left INEOS under pressure to make some major changes in the summer.\nTop of the list may well be a new manager with Erik ten Hag’s chaotic playing style leading to some bizarre performances throughout the campaign.\nThe Dutchman has suffered badly in his second season and failure to qualify for next year’s Champions League may have been the final straw for the new minority owners.\nMany names are being linked with the managerial post but with the ownership yet to take a final call regarding Ten Hag’s future, any conversations will be currently taking place behind closed doors.\nOne man heavily rumoured to be on INEOS’ managerial list, should they make a change, is outgoing Bayern Munich coach, Thomas Tuchel.\nHowever, as relayed by Sport Witness, United will need to move quickly to secure the German’s services with the 50-year-old open to taking some time off after a gruelling couple of seasons with Bayern.\nBayer Leverkusen have romped to an unlikely title success, ending Bayern’s 11-year stranglehold on the competition and damaging Tuchel’s reputation in the process.\nJournalist Tobias Altschäffl confirmed, “He (Tuchel) hasn’t completely ruled out the possibility of taking a sabbatical,” despite being the bookies favourite to take over at Old Trafford.\nFurthermore, football expert Christian Falk claimed that Tuchel remains extremely tempted by the position at United and the club are keen as well.\n“Tuchel wants to go to the island, he’s hotly tipped at Manchester United,” says Falk.\nNo official deal is likely to be announced before the end of the season given the importance of United’s remaining fixtures.\nThe four remaining Premier League games will end up determining where the club finishes while the FA Cup final will bring the curtain down on United’s season, and possibly Ten Hag’s career in Manchester.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
