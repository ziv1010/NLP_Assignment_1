According to Spanish outlet AS, Camp Nou hadn't finished work on the South Goal and Main Stand prior to this month – and still needed to complete the second part of that phase to satisfy UEFA regulations.\nUEFA requires every Champions League stadium to be able to show visible spectators from a specific camera angle, called ‘U’ view. For Barça, the problem is that they'd usually be filling their ground with fans who would be seen from this angle – but they're yet to confirm that part of the renovations.\nThe club have been waiting from Barcelona City Council, the Fire Department, Civil Protection, and local police to all approve construction on the South Goal, Main Stand, and Side Stand, making it increasingly likely that PSG will have to travel to the Montjuic instead, for a fixture at the old Olympic stadium.\nWhat comes next for Barcelona?\nThere are two “home” games coming up for Barcelona in quick succession.\nGetafe are scheduled to be the new Camp Nou's first LaLiga guests on September 21, yet it's unconfirmed as yet as to whether or not the ground will be ready – with a fixture seven days later against Real Sociedad more likely.\nIn FourFourTwo's opinion, it remains probable that Camp Nou will host games of some kind across the Champions League this season – but it depends on UEFA's willingness to work with Barcelona to see when that will be.\nIt's perhaps most likely that Barça will defer their first couple of matches (with UEFA's permission) to another venue, with Espanyol's RCDE Stadium or Girona's Estadio Municipal de Montilivi options if the Estadi Olimpic is unavailable, as it was at the weekend (thanks to a Post Malone concert).\nThe club itself will be rueing the lost revenue, though – and with fans eager to get back, the delays have already caused plenty of disappointment.\nMark White is the Digital Content Editor at FourFourTwo.
