  "body_text": "Roy Keane singled out one Manchester United star for praise after the Premier League defeat to in-form Aston Villa.\nMorgan Rogers’ brilliant finish broke the deadlock at Villa Park but United equalised just before half time through summer signing Matheus Cunha.\nRuben Amorim’s side were arguably the better team over the course of the match but Rogers’ second goal earned Aston Villa a 2-1 win – their 10th successive victory during a run which started on November 6.\nThe home win also ensures Aston Villa will sit third in the Premier League on Christmas Day, a point behind Manchester City and just three adrift of leaders Arsenal.\nManchester United, meanwhile, slip to seventh in the table, three points outside the Champions League places.\nWhile the Red Devils left Villa Park empty-handed, Keane saw some promising signs in United’s performance and continues to be impressed by summer recruit Cunha.\nCunha, who completed a £62.5m move from Wolves last summer, scored his second goal for United in the defeat to Aston Villa, though he also missed a glorious chance to equalise in the second half.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nAsked if he sees potential in Cunha, Keane said on Sky Sports: ‘It’s more than potential, he’s the real deal.\n‘It was never in doubt [the goal], it’s a brilliant finish. And then he misses a sitter in the second half which defies logic really, it’s hard to see how he missed that.’\nDiscussing United’s performance more generally, former captain Keane added: ‘I wouldn’t say they were unlucky – they gave up two goals.\n‘They’ve conceded six goals in the last two games and that’s not good enough. We praise them going forward and they are more of a goal threat but the amount of chances and goal they’re giving up, you can’t make progress with that.\n‘United can dig deep, they showed that again today, but they need to be more intense when they’re defending, they need more pride there.\n‘You can’t give up six goals in two matches and expect to get results because you’re making it too hard for yourselves. Out of possession they are nowhere near good enough.’\nMore Trending\nSpeaking in his post-match interview, Amorim said Manchester United were the ‘better team’ against Aston Villa.\n‘I think we were the better team today,’ Amorim said. ‘We were the better team.\n‘We blocked the transitions quite well and they did really well. We did a very good job that no one is going to remember tomorrow because what matters is the result.\n‘I think we deserved so much more today but the better team did not win.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Bruno Fernandes injury update after Man Utd’s defeat to Aston Villa\nMORE: Gary Neville blasts Man Utd star for ‘big mistake’ against Aston Villa\nMORE: ‘Really nasty’ – Shay Given slams Chelsea star after Newcastle United draw",
