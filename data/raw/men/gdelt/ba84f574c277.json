I think maybe at times in the last couple of years I've not fallen out of love but didn't enjoy football as much as I should,\" said Grealish.\n\"I want to have that feeling again when you get up on a match day and can't wait to get out there. That's how I felt today and hopefully my performance showed that.\"\nGrealish has already been taken to Evertonian hearts and is the marquee signing the club hope will bring a new 53,000 capacity crowd to its feet.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
