(Photo by Adrian DENNIS / AFP)\nBut the French champions should take nothing for granted given their history of epic European collapses.\nArsenal's first defeat in 18 home European matches was a painful blow to their own bid to win a first Champions League crown.\nMikel Arteta had labelled Arsenal's run to the semi-finals a \"beautiful story\".\nThe last chapter might make for frustrating reading, but they aren't dead and buried just yet.\nThe Gunners had beaten holders Real Madrid 5-1 on aggregate to reach their first Champions League semi-final since losing to Manchester United in 2009.\nThey could not replicate the swaggering display that blew Madrid away 3-0 in the first leg, despite a frenzied atmosphere as kick-off approached.\nFormer Arsenal's French manager Arsene Wenger (L) does a thumbs up as he speaks with Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the UEFA Champions League Semi-final First Leg football match between Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) at the Emirates Stadium in north London, on April 29, 2025. (Photo by Adrian Dennis / AFP)\nWhen Arsenal's players gathered for a pre-match huddle in the tunnel, Declan Rice implored his team-mates to give everything as he roared \"if we don't have the ball we die\".\nA video message from Arteta played on the Emirates screens struck a similarly rousing chord as the Spaniard urged fans to raise the roof.\nBut PSG had already eliminated Premier League champions Liverpool in the last 16 and Aston Villa in the quarter-finals, after coming back from two goals down to beat Manchester City in the league phase.\nArsenal were the one English side they had failed to conquer, losing 2-0 in north London in October.\nHowever, PSG were without the influential Dembele for disciplinary reasons on that occasion and Luis Enrique insisted his side were \"more complete\" seven months on.\nOut-gunned\nDembele took just four minutes to prove the point as the France star started and finished a ruthless raid.\nTaking possession in the centre circle, Dembele worked the ball out to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and he drove at Jurrien Timber with intent.\nArsenal's English midfielder #07 Bukayo Saka (L) controls the ball past Paris Saint-Germain's Portuguese defender #25 Nuno Mendes during the UEFA Champions League Semi-final First Leg football match between Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) at the Emirates Stadium in north London, on April 29, 2025. (Photo by Adrian Dennis / AFP)\nDembele had carried on his run into the Arsenal area and Kvaratskhelia's perfectly weighted pass picked him out for a clinical finish that went in off the far post.\nHaving seized the momentum, PSG went for the kill and Marquinhos rose to meet Achraf Hakimi's cross with a header that was just too close to Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya.\nKvaratskhelia had a strong penalty appeal waved away when Timber appeared to halt the forward's burst into area with an arm around his chest.\nKvaratskhelia was undeterred, forcing Raya to save after attacking Timber again.\nDembele was proving equally hard for Arsenal to handle, his clever run and pass reaching Desire Doue for a low strike that Raya saved at full stretch.\nArsenal had been out-gunned but they should have equalised just before half-time when Myles Lewis-Skelly's sublime pass found Gabriel Martinelli, whose shot was superbly saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma.\nArsenal thought they had drawn level two minutes into the second half when Mikel Merino headed home from Rice's free-kick, yet their celebrations were premature as VAR disallowed the goal for offside against the Spain midfielder.\nArteta's men had the momentum and Leandro Trossard was inches away from equalising when Rice's pass sent him bursting into the PSG area for a shot that Donnarumma brilliantly tipped away.\nFeeling the shift in the balance of power, PSG looked to take the sting out of the game by playing at a slower pace.\nThe tactic almost worked to perfection when Bradley Barcola sauntered through, but with just Raya to beat he dragged his shot wide of the far post.\nIt was a woeful miss, leaving Luis Enrique holding his head in disbelief.\nThe PSG coach was in the exact same stunned pose moments later when Goncalo Ramos fired against the bar from close-range.\n-\nStrong winds, blowing dust forecast from Sunday: Qatar Meteorology\n-\nMandarin Oriental, Doha celebrates dual five-star recognition at Forbes Travel Guide 2026 Star Awards\n-\nMinistry of Municipality launches 34 e-services for livestock sector\n-\nAl Attiyah, McInnes top times on Jordan Baja Prologue\n-\n‘Stability offers investment confidence as Qatar poised for further growth’",
