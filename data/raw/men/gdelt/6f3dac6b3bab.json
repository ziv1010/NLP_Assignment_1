  "body_text": "If reports are to be believed, Chelsea Football Club are attempting to line up a mesmerising striker signing. However, a prospective fee for the Sweden international would be north of £115 million. Yet rival Premier League outfit Newcastle United are reportedly exhibiting a reluctance to relinquish their prized asset.\nThe west Londoners require a goalscorer capable of propelling them back to the Champions League whilst collecting silverware. Is Alexander Isak worth this astonishing amount as the Blues seek a truly worthy centre forward?\nMeanwhile there is another pleasing update from transfer guru Fabrizio Romano concerning Barcelona starlet Marc Guiu. What's the young attacker all about?\nFabrizio Romano and others like David Ornstein confirm Barcelona striker Marc Guiu has chosen Chelsea\nChoosing Chels' is what most promising world footballing stars of the future have been doing recently. Guiu is the latest in a procession of ridiculously talented prospects coming to Stamford Bridge. He only turned 18 years old in January, but he's already garnered two million followers on Instagram. Wow.\nIf you've seen him live, on television, or video clips on YouTube, you'll know that Guiu is special. He's earned quite the following, to be honest. His Barcelona debuting was also quite something. Now he wants further senior minutes for a notable club on his possible way to superstardom\n\"Marc Guiu to Chelsea, here we go\"Fabrizio Romano\nWhy Alexander Isak would potentially be a phenomenal Blues signing\nIf Isak can do what he's been doing for Newcastle in the Premier League - he will probably do it even more convincingly for Chelsea! The Magpies have a great squad, a very good starting lineup and have been thoroughly entertaining for a while now. It is also enjoyable when they capitulate or collapse.\nYet the Blues have a superior roster. Well, they will once they add a further few key reinforcements this summer. If CFC manage to take Isak from NUFC, then they are likely destined to finish even higher above their EPL competitors this season.\nOne of the few elements still needed at the Bridge - like a first class goalkeeper, in my opinion - is a world-class centre forward. Isak is a fairly uniquely talented striker as I see it: distinctively combining guile in the box with strength and terrific speed.\nHaving the two latter traits is almost paradoxical in a positive sense; it's certainly beneficial on route to goal. Therefore, in spite of a valuation which surpasses the £115m paid for Moises Caicedo, Isak is possibly worth that amount in the long run.",
