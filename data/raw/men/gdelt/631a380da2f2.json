  "body_text": "It will be another big window for Nottingham Forest this summer as they look to strengthen their squad for the additional challenge of competing in Europe for the first time in three decades, with Nuno Espirito Santo’s side having earned a place in the final round of Conference League qualifiers.\nMaking the league phase would mean six extra midweek games, so Forest want to add at least five additions to their squad — and are already making progress towards getting three over the line.\nHere, The Athletic looks at what to expect from them in this transfer window.\nAdvertisement\nWho will make the key decisions during this window?\nOne of the main changes in the dynamic this summer is the arrival of Edu in a senior role across the multi-club group overseen by Forest’s owner Evangelos Marinakis.\nIt remains to be seen how much of an influence the former Arsenal sporting director will have on Forest specifically, or whether his association with Kia Joorabchian will mean that the agent has any role to play in their recruitment process, but he is seen as a statement appointment.\nForest’s recruitment in the past few windows has been impressive, and a lot of trust will remain with a recruitment team that is headed up by George Syrianos, the global technical director for Forest, Olympiacos in Greece and Portugal’s Rio Ave. Head of recruitment Pedro Ferreira and chief football officer Ross Wilson will both also have an influence, as will head coach Nuno. Marinakis himself will have input, too.\nWhat positions will they be looking at?\nForest want to add at least one, if not two, forwards to their attacking options, to provide competition and cover for Chris Wood and Taiwo Awoniyi. A versatile performer who could also operate across the three, as part of Nuno’s favoured 4-2-3-1 formation, would be the preference for one of those additions.\nThey will also look to sign a left-back, with no plans to renew/make permanent Alex Moreno’s loan from Aston Villa and a question mark over Harry Toffolo, who is out of contract this summer. The club would like to add another winger to the squad, as well as another goalkeeper capable of being a quality backup option to Matz Sels.\nWhat is the manager’s priority?\nThe injuries to strikers Wood and Awoniyi in the final stages of last season underlined the importance of adding to Forest’s attacking options after they won only two of the last eight matches to miss out on a Champions League finish.\nAdvertisement\nWood enjoyed a remarkable season, becoming the first 20-goal forward for Forest since Stan Collymore 20 years earlier. But he will also turn 34 in December. Awoniyi has also suffered more than his fair share of injury misfortune over the past few seasons, most recently when he ended up needing emergency surgery on an abdominal injury after colliding with the post trying to score a late winner in the draw with Leicester City on May 11.\nNuno knows Forest have a strong starting XI but need to add more depth, especially as they prepare to add at least three months of midweek European football to their calendar.\nAre there any specific players they are targeting?\nForest are already close to completing their first piece of business, and it’s a whopper in the form of a triple signing from Brazil’s Botafogo, the current South American champions. They have initiated moves for forward Igor Jesus, left-back Cuiabano and centre-back Jair Cunha.\nJesus is a 24-year-old who can also operate on either wing — exactly the brand of versatility that Nuno favours. He has scored seven goals and provided one assist in 23 games this season. He has four caps for Brazil, scoring one goal. He joined Botafogo from the United Arab Emirates side Shabab Al Ahli in 2024.\nCunha is a 6ft 5in central defender. Botafogo only signed the 20-year-old from fellow Brazilian side Santos in February, but the Brazil Under-20 international has already established himself as a first-team regular, making 16 appearances in all competitions.\nCuiabano is a 22-year-old left-back or wing-back. He joined Botafogo from Gremio, another team in Brazil, in April 2024 and has scored two goals and provided three assists in 21 games this season.\nForest were among the suitors for Liam Delap, who is expected to complete the final formalities of his £30million ($40.6m) move to Chelsea from relegated Ipswich Town. The club felt the 22-year-old would fit perfectly into their squad and their style of play under Nuno, but were always aware that there would be a fierce level of competition for his signature.\nAdvertisement\nThere remains an interest in Yoane Wissa, the versatile Brentford forward Forest made an unsuccessful £22million bid for in January.\nManchester City’s attacking midfielder James McAtee is another who has been on the radar for some time, with Forest also holding an interest in him during the previous window at the start of the year. The 22-year-old has been left out of City’s squad for the Club World Cup this summer, having previously found his Premier League opportunities limited.\nWho will they be looking to sell?\nForest will not be actively seeking takers for Morgan Gibbs-White but the future of their hugely influential attacking midfielder will nevertheless be one of the biggest talking points of the summer. Manchester City are interested as they look to bolster their No 10 options.\nWhether a deal can be agreed that persuades Forest to allow a player signed for £42.5million from Wolves in summer 2022 to move on remains to be seen. City also have other targets. And, while other clubs will continue to monitor Gibbs-White’s position, it certainly is not set in stone that he will move, with his contract tying him to the club until 2027, but what happens with him will shape the rest of Forest’s transfer business.\nLyon, who previously signed Moussa Niakhate and Orel Mangala from Forest, have now been linked with both midfielder Danilo and goalkeeper Matt Turner, who has been on loan at Crystal Palace. Lyon, Palace and Botafogo are all part of the multi-club ownership group that are overseen by Eagle Football Holdings, headed up by American businessman John Textor.\nThere are a few more peripheral players whose status will be up in the air in the coming weeks, including Ramon Sosa, Toffolo, Willy Boly and Carlos Miguel. Like Toffolo, Boly is out of contract. Jota Silva, the Portuguese winger, has also found his opportunities limited but remains determined to prove himself at the City Ground. Wayne Hennessey, the backup goalkeeper, is another whose deal expires this summer. The 38-year-old could be offered a coaching role if he is not kept on the playing staff.\nThere will also be question marks over many of the players coming back from loan spells at other clubs.\nAdvertisement\nStrasbourg hold an option to make Andrew Omobamidele’s move permanent, but Matt Turner (Crystal Palace), Omar Richards (Rio Ave), Lewis O’Brien (Swansea City), Emmanuel Dennis (Blackburn Rovers) and Josh Bowler (Luton Town) will all return to the City Ground. Richards, O’Brien, Dennis and Bowler are going into the final year of their contracts.\nForest also signed Marko Stamenic and David Carmo last summer, before immediately loaning them to sister club Olympiacos. It remains to be seen whether they will be off to Athens again next season.\nWill anyone move out on loan?\nForest are excited about the potential of central defender Tyler Bindon, the New Zealand international. He was signed in a £700,000 deal from Reading in February, before immediately being loaned back to the League One side, where he won their player of the season award.\nThe 20-year-old will join up with Forest for pre-season training, before the club decide whether another loan might be the best way to continue his development.\nYoung B team players such as Ben Perry (Northampton Town), Jamie McDonnell (Colchester United), Dale Taylor (Wigan Athletic) and Joe Gardner (Lincoln City) all benefited from loan spells at various levels of the EFL last season and could be farmed out again to continue their development.\nWhat moves have they made already?\nThe wheels are already turning with that potential triple signing from Botafogo, while Forest did register their interest in Delap.\nWhat sort of budget do they have and what is their PSR position?\nForest do not actively need to sell players to remain on the right side of PSR (profit and sustainability rules), with the club reporting a pre-tax profit of £12.1million in their most recent accounts, suggesting finances are in a reasonably healthy state.\nMarinakis is willing to fund the additions Forest need to create the strength in depth that will allow them to compete on several fronts next season. If Gibbs-White is sold in the coming weeks, it would further alter the dynamic, with any transfer fee they get for him likely to be reinvested in the first-team squad.\n(Top photos of Wissa, left, and McAtee: Getty Images)",
