I love watching players score great free-kicks,’ Beckham said on CBS, referencing the Arsenal midfielder’s two superb free-kicks against Real Madrid in the quarter-finals.\n‘There were a couple of comparisons so I messaged him just to say congratulations.’\nWhen Rice left West Ham in the summer of 2023, a host of Premier League clubs, including United and Manchester City, were queueing up to try and sign the dynamic midfielder.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

This is why we play this sport, there are going to be setbacks along the way.\n‘PSG have obviously gone through tonight, we’re absolutely gutted but this isn’t going to define us for sure.\n‘We’re going to be back and when we get our players back who have been out for a very long time, we are going to be a much stronger outfit so we’ve got to keep going.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Viktor Gyokeres tells Ruben Amorim his view on joining Arsenal ahead of Manchester United\nMORE: Marcus Rashford begins talks with ‘dream club’ to speed up Manchester United exit\nMORE: ‘Serial winner’ installed as new favourite to replace Mikel Arteta as next Arsenal manager",
