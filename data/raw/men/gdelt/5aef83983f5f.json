Now it identified 105 top-division clubs in Europe having a “cross-investment relationship” with at least one other club. There were 112 more European clubs involved who play in lower tier divisions.\nAmerican investor groups combined to have majority stakes in 37 top-tier European clubs, the UEFA report said, and 65 clubs in total – almost five times more than the next highest total of 14 clubs in Italian ownership groups.\nAmerican ownership groups include RedBird whose prize asset is AC Milan, Eagle Football which has Lyon, and 777 Partners, whose pursuit of English club Everton has intensified scrutiny on legal issues for its companies in the U.S.\nRedBird and another American-backed group, Aston Villa’s owner V Sports, were investigated by a UEFA-appointed panel last year. Milan and its French sibling Toulouse, plus Villa and Vitória Guimarães in Portugal all qualified for European competitions.\nUEFA judged the multi-club owners had some “decisive influence” over both teams and the cases led to board members being removed, investment stakes cut or divested, one-year transfer embargoes, and ending shared use of scouting databases.\n“These changes substantially restrict the investors’ influence and decision-making power over more than one club,” UEFA said last July.\nThose interventions were seen as tougher than a 2017 ruling by a different UEFA panel that accepted separation in Red Bull’s ties to Leipzig and Salzburg that let both enter the Champions League. When those clubs met in the 2018-19 Europa League, Salzburg won both games and Leipzig failed to advance from their group.\nAsked last week about a likely Man City-Girona investigation, UEFA general secretary Theodore Theodoridis said it was not yet appropriate to comment.\nCollusion in the transfer market between clubs in shared ownership has been cited by UEFA as another integrity risk, though its latest research suggested this was “perhaps not the main (driver of multi-club purchases), as most people tend to think.”\nUEFA also insisted its club monitoring rules previously known as Financial Fair Play will “prevent advantages from related-party loans or transfers.”\nWhile being in a multi-club network has been welcomed at Girona, fans have protested against American owners in recent weeks in England, Belgium and France.\nCrystal Palace and Molenbeek fans have been unhappy with Eagle, and Strasbourg fans have objected to being seen as less important to owner BlueCo which has a multi-billion dollar investment in Chelsea.\nUEFA acknowledged on Thursday the multi-club trend “marks a significant shift in traditional ownership structures, with far-reaching implications for the interconnected relationships between clubs, sponsors and fans.”\nThe UEFA-recognized Football Supporters Europe group has urged soccer bodies to “adopt firm regulations before the whole game is (irredeemably) compromised.”\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",
