Tottenham Hotspur\nLeaving a club destined for Champions League football in 2024/25 for a club that isn't doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Calafiori at this stage in his career.\nSure, Ange Postecoglou has got Tottenham playing some pretty tasty stuff, and they are undoubtedly a bigger club with bigger resources, bigger ability to draw and bigger, well, everything. Nevertheless, it would be the wrong step.\nGood fit rating: 1/10\n5. Chelsea\nAs mentioned above, leaving a Champions League club for a club that hasn't qualified for the competition doesn't make sense.\nUnlike any move to Tottenham though, in this instance at least Calafiori would be joining a team with a winning pedigree and a future route to challenging for the Premier League title.\nThat said, Chelsea don't seem to have any clue about what they are doing in the transfer market - planting many, many red flags for Calafiori.\nGood fit rating: 3/10\n4. Arsenal\nThe first Champions League club on this list.\nThanks to their stunning form under Mikel Arteta in recent seasons, Arsenal are one of the most enticing clubs in Europe right now.\nWhile joining the Gunners would, on the surface, be a great move for Calafiori, Gabriel having the left centre-back role firmly sewed up may make first-team football slightly difficult to come by.\nIs there any point risking being a rotation option? Doubtful.\nGood fit rating: 4/10\n3. Man Utd\nManchester United are another non-Champions League team, but they are literally Manchester United.\nAnd with the Sir Jim Ratcliffe/INEOS revolution underway, things appear to be a little more cohesive in terms of their approach to transfers – the less said about the treatment of their women's team, the better.\nCalafiori would be a statement signing for new technical director Jason Wilcox, representing what United hope is a new era of success. A good fit next to Lisandro Martinez too? You bet.\nGood fit rating: 6/10\n2. Real Madrid\nYep, the biggest club in the world and current European champions are reportedly interested in Calafiori.\nThat is quite the compliment.\nKylian Mbappe and Endrick have already been secured for their frontline, and with Nacho Fernandez leaving and David Alaba and Eder Militao making their way back from ACL injuries, the next obvious thing to do is find Antonio Rudiger a shiny new partner who could end up being the best of Carlo Ancelotti's bunch.\nJust picture it.\nGood fit rating: 8/10\n1. Juventus\nCalafiori has long been expected to link up with his former manager Thiago Motta at Juventus this summer.\nTrouble is, the Nesta/Maldini/Cannavaro looks regen has been so good at Euro 2024 that Juve are now worried that his price tag has skyrocketed so much that they now can't afford to sign him.\nDespite those fears, La Vecchia Signora have to do all they can to secure Calafiori's services. He'd be a game changer for the club.\nGood fit rating: 8/10",
