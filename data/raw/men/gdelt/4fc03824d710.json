Long-term it’s not healthy for anybody, especially for the club because people come and people go, you don’t get your identity in there.\n“The club has to rebuild in a lot of aspects of it and as I said before, as long as I’m here, I’ll give it everything I’ve got, 100 per cent commitment, heart, soul, everything. I really enjoy it here, it’s really good.”\nDonacien, 25, is yet to feature for Town under Lambert, his boss for part of his time at Aston Villa as a youngster, but could come into the reckoning against his old club in the FA Cup on Saturday.\nPhoto: TWTD\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nIs he gonna stay long term ?\nWho knows I hope so but it'll be down to the backing he gets from Evans !\nExtremely worrying times here\nThough next time to speed things up a little he should just come across on a dinghy\nSadly no way is he either a left back or centre half. Can't see why Lambert doesn't play him at right back,as Spence is a liability. His positional sense is awful and under any sort of pressure makes too many mistakes.\nI hope I'm wrong, but I'm not holding my breath over this January window and sadly feel after the Millwall catastrophe we are doomed.\nI also feel for Nsiala who looked promising until his sending off\nBoth these two would have dealt with the physicality of Millwall surely?\nChambers is now feeling the pressure and making mistakes plus he's got Pennington who for me isn't big enough to cope with taller forwards.\nPersonally, I cannot see him overcoming either. He cannot do 90 minutes without suffering from both, which is there for all to see in every game he plays.\nDonacian in and Spence out please.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
