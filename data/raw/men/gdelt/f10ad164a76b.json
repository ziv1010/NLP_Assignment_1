  "body_text": "Harry Redknapp has warned Arsenal and Manchester City they could both end up missing out on Declan Rice this summer.\nThe West Ham midfielder has attracted bids worth £90m from Arsenal and Man City but Redknapp can ‘see a future’ for Rice in east London.\nArsenal have been confident of bringing Rice to the Emirates Stadium for several months, with Mikel Arteta a known admirer of the 24-year-old.\nThe Gunners have already submitted two bids for Rice but West Ham, looking for £100m, quickly rejected the offers.\nThis has given Manchester City hope of securing Rice’s signature and the Premier League champions made their first formal bid for the England star on Monday night.\nWhile that also looks set to be knocked back by West Ham, Man City could well return with improved turns and possibly even blow last season’s title rivals Arsenal out of the water.\nRedknapp admits Rice may end up leaving West Ham this summer but has not ruled out the chances of the midfielder staying put for another season.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

I would really love to see the club push to keep him.\nMore Trending\n‘In reality it looks as though he will go to Arsenal as things stand and they do begin to look a very good team to whom he would be a big help.\n‘I certainly see them as being the main challengers to Man City next season and beyond. They are a young and exciting team but I would have thought he would want to speak with Man City.\n‘However, at the end of it all I want the Hammers to have a right go at keeping him. We are a big club and he could do far worse than to stay where he is.’\nMORE: Man City make formal bid for West Ham star and Arsenal target Declan Rice\nMORE: Arsenal defender Jakub Kiwior reacts to Jurrien Timber transfer links\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
