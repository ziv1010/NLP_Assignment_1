  "body_text": "Rio Ferdinand insisted Barcelona star Pedri should have ‘taken one of the team’ and ‘got his head kicked off’ while trying to prevent an Inter Milan goal in their Champions League thriller.\nBarcelona and Inter fought out a sublime 3-3 draw in the first leg of their semi-final on Wednesday night.\nThe Nerazzurri took a shock lead inside 30 seconds through Marcus Thuram’s outrageous finish – the quickest semi-final goal in Champions League history.\nDenzel Dumfries doubled the lead after 24 minutes, brilliantly latching onto Francesco Acerbi’s flick-on from a corner kick with a superb volley from close range.\nBarcelona midfielder Pedri was closest to the Dutchman as he connected with the ball with former Manchester United and England defender Ferdinand insisting he should have been braver and put his body on the line.\n‘I tell you what, Pedri has got to go in there and get kicked,’ Ferdinand said on commentary for TNT Sports.\n‘I think he’s just jumped away from the ball. Look at it here, he doesn’t go towards the ball he jumps away from it.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘You have got to go in there and get your head kicked off a little bit and take one for the team.’\nAlly McCoist, also on commentary duty, agreed with Ferdinand’s comments, insisting a challenge from Pedri would have potentially seen the goal ruled out for a high boot.\n‘You’re absolutely spot on. Because if he does go with his head I think that goal gets disallowed.’\nLamine Yamal turned in a mesmeric performance to inspire Barcelona’s fightback, pulling one back in sensational fashion before Ferran Torres drew the game level after 38 minutes.\nMore Trending\nDumfries was on the score sheet again after 63 minutes, capitalising on more disappointing defending from the hosts.\nBut Barcelona drew level again with Yamal again involved, dummying the ball before Raphinha crashed a wonderful effort from range off the cross bar with the ball bouncing off goalkeeper Yann Sommer before trickling over the line.\nWith the tie finely poised, the two go at it again in Milan next Tuesday.\nMORE: Paul Parker argues Man Utd may end up having a better season than Arsenal\nMORE: William Saliba admits Arsenal players found it ‘difficult’ to stop PSG star\nMORE: Mikel Merino sends message to PSG ahead of Arsenal’s Champions League second leg",
