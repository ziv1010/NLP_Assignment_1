  "body_text": "Erik ten Hag says the club is keeping him informed of what is happening in regard to Manchester United being sold.\n“From the start, yes. They informed me how the process will go. I focus on football, they are focusing on other parts, departments of the club how to get everything financed,” he said at the pre-match press conference ahead of Sunday’s Premier League clash with Leicester City.\n“We are following it, it is our club and of course we are committed, but we are focusing on football, on training, on our way of playing, on games.\n“We are enjoying our togetherness at the moment. It’s really enjoyable to work and we are focusing on games and we are in four competitions.\n“Others in the club will have to make decisions and give efforts in the process [of the takeover] but it’s not up to us.”\nThe manager was also asked whether he thinks United can win the Premier League title.\n“We don’t think about that so far,” he answered.\n“What we have to do is to put us, in April, in the right position, so our thinking can only be on the next game. We always have to be better than the previous game and think about it game by game – that is our focus.\n“We have to collect the three points against Leicester. That demands a lot of energy and demands high standards.\nWith matches coming thick and fast and United still competing on four fronts, Ten Hag was asked whether he thought his squad can cope with the schedule and recover for the Leicester game.\n“It is about if we do the things right and we are ready and we have been in this rhythm for many weeks. So our players are doing really well in their sleep, in their recovery, in their food and they will be ready for Sunday. Definitely,” he said.\n“The players in our squad, they like it. They like to play in big games and they know as team, and as an individual, you grow from such games.\nAsked about qualifying for the Champions League next season, Ten Hag said there were two ways in which the club could qualify.\n“We are in the right direction but we have to fight for it. There are two ways. One is to win the Europa League and the other way is the Premier League. We know what to do and we have to see it from game to game. We must fight to get back in the Champions League,” he said.\nUnited Matchday Magazine – be in the know about everything in red!\nStill itching for more United content?
