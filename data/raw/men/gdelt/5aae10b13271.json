  "body_text": "Robbie Fowler has warned Liverpool that it will be a sad day if Mohamed Salah leaves at the end of the season and they will be a poorer team for it.\nThe 32-year-old is having yet another brilliant season for the Reds, with 28 goals to his name in all competitions and leading the Premier League goal-scoring charts.\nThe Egyptian has taken his tally to 239 Liverpool goals in 385 games and shows little sign of slowing down, despite turning 33 in June.\nHowever, there is the very real prospect that he will leave the club on a free transfer when his contract expires at the end of the season.\nVirgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold are in the same situation, and despite the Premier League leaders enjoying a fabulous season so far, it is a concern hanging over them.\nThe former Reds striker is desperate for Salah to stay, saying his contribution to the team cannot be replaced and Arne Slot’s team is guaranteed to be worse without the prolific winger.\nFowler was speaking to BoyleSports, who offer today’s football odds, and said: ‘You’re in the realms of impossible when it comes to replacing Mohamed Salah at Liverpool. If Salah leaves Liverpool then they will become a poorer team whoever comes in.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘Look at the goals and assists that Salah is posting this season, he has just been incredible. His performances haven’t always been brilliant but he will always pop up with something beautiful and out of the ordinary.\n‘It will be a sad day if he doesn’t sign a new contract because when you have aspirations of winning the Premier League, Champions League and domestic cups you need to have players like Salah around.\n‘There are so few players matching his numbers and any replacement would be downgrading, fingers crossed he stays at Liverpool because a sad day is looming.’\nFowler is much less concerned over the future of Darwin Nunez, who he does not see as ever nailing down a place in the starting XI at Anfield.\nThe Reds legend has not dismissed the contributions of the Uruguayan completely, but says he will have to be happy with being a squad player if he is to remain at the club.\n‘It’s interesting with Darwin Nunez, he hasn’t played as much as he would’ve liked under Arne Slot having not played as much as he would’ve liked under Jurgen Klopp,’ said Fowler of the 25-year-old who has scored six goals this season.\n‘I think Liverpool would be open to offers for Nunez because of that, but it all depends on one thing and that’s what the player wants to do.\nMore Trending\n‘If he wants to stay and fight then he has his contract, I just don’t think he is ever going to be a regular in that starting XI so it’ll be about being a squad member.\n‘You want a squad that is happy and comfortable in the Premier League and they have that at the moment, but the future of Nunez is up to him.’\nLiverpool’s bid for the Premier League title continues on Wednesday night when they travel to Aston Villa.\nA win would stretch their lead at the top to a commanding 10 points, although they will have played a game more than closest rivals Arsenal.\nMORE: Arsenal eyeing transfer move for £66m Bundesliga striker\nMORE: Raphael Varane admits ‘surprise’ at Marcus Rashford decision before Manchester United exit\nMORE: Premier League rivals have already tried to sign Arsenal wonderkid Ethan Nwaneri",
