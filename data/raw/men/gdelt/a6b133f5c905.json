They were out.\"\nMadrid secured come-from-behind wins against Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City in each knockout round before beating Liverpool 1-0 in the final.\n\"They were like a boxer, they were up against the ropes and they were halfway down the ropes and you're thinking the ref's going to step in and stop the bout,\" Hoddle said. \"I don't know what happened, they just kept going. And they had that quality.\"\nWhere the Champions League is concerned anything seems possible for Madrid, who won the trophy three years in a row from 2016-18 when Barcelona were dominating the Spanish title.\nBut if any team can rival Madrid's ability to produce the unexpected in European club football's most prized competition, it is Liverpool.\nThere was the famous comeback from 3-0 down against AC Milan in the 2005 final before going on to win on penalties. And more recently the 4-3 aggregate win against Barcelona in the semifinals in 2019 after losing 3-0 in the first leg at the Nou Camp.\nMadrid, however, have felt like a step too far ever since the draw was made last November.\nAfter all, this Liverpool face a fight just to qualify for next season's competition, let alone win it this year.\nJurgen Klopp has struggled to get Liverpool firing after the departure of key forward Sadio Mane to Bayern Munich last summer and a host of injuries.\nAhead of the first-leg match at Anfield, Klopp can at least be encouraged by a recent upturn in form after back-to-back wins against Everton and Newcastle in the Premier League and goals from misfiring forwards Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nunez.\nSuddenly Liverpool look in contention again for a Champions League-qualifying spot, sitting seven points off fourth-place Tottenham with two games in hand.\nThen there is the Anfield factor, with an atmosphere that saw Barcelona wilt in that semifinals comeback and Manchester City repeatedly fall despite dominating English football in recent years.\nLike Madrid's fans, the Liverpool crowd believes nothing is beyond them when it comes to Europe after winning the trophy six times.",
