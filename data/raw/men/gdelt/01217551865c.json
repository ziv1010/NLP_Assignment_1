  "body_text": "Cristian Chivu is the new Inter head coach\nThe Coach has signed a contract with Inter until 30 June 2027\nFC Internazionale Milano is pleased to welcome Cristian Chivu as the new head coach of the First Team. The Coach has signed a contract with Inter until 30 June 2027.\nSome lives are full of stories, lives that go through all kinds of challenges and always find a way to come back stronger. Lives that find solid foundations on which new, meaningful chapters are built. During his life, Cristian Eugen Chivu has faced major challenges and defining moments that shaped him, both as a person and a professional. And through it all, his bond with the Nerazzurri has only grown stronger. Today, he begins his third chapter with Inter, but this time as the head coach of the First Team.\nBorn on 26 October 1980 in Reșița, a Romanian city of about 80,000 people, Chivu quickly learned the value of discipline to succeed in the world of football. Cristian grew up immersed in the game, inspired by his father Mircea, a former player and his first coach in CSM Reșițas youth setup. His journey was long and without any shortcuts. His deep bond with his father made all the difference, teaching him the values of sacrifice and ambition. Cristian started out as a forward but could also play as an attacking midfielder when needed. He possessed enough talent to make his first-team debut at just 17, playing in the very stadium that today bears his father Mirceas name. In 1998, he moved to Universitatea Craiova before catching the eye of an Ajax scout and joining the Dutch club in July 1999.\nCristian had already established himself as a defender who could also play as a full-back, but it was in the Netherlands that he completed his transformation. At Ajax, he refined his technical skills and, more importantly, trained his mind. It was a true footballing school for a young player on the rise. In 2001, Chivu became the youngest captain in Ajaxs history, a role reserved for someone with exceptional character and leadership qualities. During his time in Amsterdam, Cristian won a league title, the Dutch Cup and Dutch Super Cup. After 142 appearances over four years, he made the move to Italy, signing for Roma in 2003. The Romanian spent four seasons in the capital, winning the Coppa Italia. Then came a turning point came in 2007: his transfer to Inter, a move that would change his life forever.\nDuring his seven-year spell as an Inter player, theres one moment that speaks more about Cristian Chivus connection to the Club and its fans than any win, trophy or his 169 appearances and three goals for the Nerazzurri. On 24 March 2010, just 77 days after suffering a terrible skull fracture against Chievo in Verona, Chivu made his return to the pitch, wearing protective headgear. That day marked a new beginning for Cristian, who only months earlier had almost lost far more than just his career. The Nerazzurri fans greeted his first, tentative header with a standing ovation a feeling that was hard to put into words for Chivu. From then on, he played the rest of his career wearing his protective helmet, removing it only to celebrate titles and victories. In total, he won the Scudetto three times, two Coppa Italia titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies, the Club World Cup and the 2009/10 Champions League.\nAt international level, Chivu captained Romania, earning 75 caps and taking part in the European Championship in 2000 and 2008. In 2014, his first chapter with Inter came to an end as he called time on his playing career. However, his Nerazzurri journey was far from over: in 2018, Cristian started his coaching career in Inters youth sector.\nChivus adventure began with the U14s and continued with the U17s and U18s. In the summer of 2021, he took charge of the Primavera side an important challenge and a big opportunity for such an ambitious person. In his first season, he led the team to a brilliant Scudetto title, the tenth in Inter Primaveras history. At the end of the 2023/24 campaign, he left Inter.\nIn February 2025, Cristian was given his first opportunity to coach a senior side as Parma, in danger of being relegated, came calling. He led the Emilians to safety, with the team picking up 16 points from 13 matches under his guidance.\nNow, Cristian Chivu is beginning the third chapter of his Nerazzurri story. And hes doing so with the values that have always guided him: dedication, sacrifice and a tireless work ethic.\n( Press Release Image: https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/339487/339487-1.jpg )\nWebWireID339487\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.
