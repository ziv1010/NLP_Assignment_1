  "body_text": "Sergio Rico is expected to be discharged from hospital next week, nearly three months on from an accident that left the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper fighting for his life.\nThe 29-year-old was hit by a mule cart and a runaway horse while on a pilgrimage in Spain on May 28 before he was taken to the Virgen del Rocio Hospital in Seville where he has been ever since.\nAdvertisement\nHe has undergone a number of medical operations to address the severe injuries and brain trauma he suffered before being placed in the hands of doctors and specialists for dedicated care.\nIt had been hoped that Rico would be able to leave earlier but his discharge was delayed due to normal complications in such a complicated process. His family now expects him to be allowed to leave this week before he is expected to return to his home in Seville.\nA return to football is not a priority at this stage as he embarks on the next stage of his recovery although doctors have been positive throughout the process as long as his rehabilitation continues to progress as planned.\nThe news is a huge relief to his family who have been by his side throughout since May.\nRico had travelled to El Rocio, a pilgrimage which takes place in Almonte, Huelva, in the province of Andalucia and involves a procession that includes people walking, riders on horseback and carts following PSG’s 1-1 draw against Strasbourg on May 27, a result that secured the Ligue 1 title.\nRico’s family said following the accident: “Sergio Rico travelled last night from Strasbourg to Malaga and there to El Rocio, with the permission of the club after PSG won Ligue 1. After just over an hour and a half with his family and friends, he was on his way to the Pontifical Mass next to the chapel when he suffered an accident when a mule cart and a runaway horse hit him.\n“We are grateful for the expressions of affection, the messages and the interest of all those of you who are asking about the condition of the patient.”\nPSG paid tribute to Rico during their final Ligue 1 match of the season against Clermont Foot. Players wore warm up shirts with his image on before the fixture and their playing shirts also had Rico’s name printed on the back.\nAdvertisement\nThe goalkeeper’s former side Sevilla wore shirts displaying the message “come on Sergio, we are with you” ahead of their Europa League final victory over Roma, and Mallorca also paid tribute to Rico ahead of their La Liga fixture against Rayo Vallecano.\nGO DEEPER\nSergio Rico was trampled by a horse. This is the incredible story of how he cheated death\nSergio Rico profile\nThe 29-year-old goalkeeper was born in Seville and made nearly 200 appearances for his hometown club Sevilla, playing in and winning the 2015 Europa League final. He picked up another winner’s medal the following year, though he was an unused substitute in the final against Liverpool.\nHaving fallen out of favour at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan, Rico spent a season on loan at Fulham in 2018-19, playing 29 times as they were relegated from the Premier League.\nThe following season, he was loaned to Paris Saint-Germain, but was second-choice to Kaylor Navas. Rico did, however, start the Champions League quarter and semi-finals, before Navas returned for the final defeat to Bayern Munich.\nThe move was made permanent in 2020, but Rico — who also made one substitute appearance for Spain in 2016 — has remained as a back-up at PSG with Gianluigi Donnarumma joining in 2021. He spent 2021-22 on loan at Mallorca.\n(Photo: David Ramos/Getty Images)",
