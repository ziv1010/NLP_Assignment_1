His ability on the ball makes him an ideal fit for Mikel Arteta’s philosophy. However, the Gunners’ opening offer of around £30m was rejected by Ajax.\nArsenal are ready to respond with a new bid for the Netherlands international. Promisingly, earlier reports suggested a move to the Emirates Stadium is a dream for Timber.\nNow, journalist Florian Plettenberg has tweeted that Timber is ‘on [the] verge’ of joining Arsenal, with whom he already has a ‘verbal agreement’ on personal terms.\nThe upcoming second bid by Arsenal could therefore be crucial. According to the Sky Sports Deutschland expert, an ‘agreement [is] expected’ between the two clubs soon.\nPlettenberg has relayed that the transfer fee for Timber should be somewhere between €40m (£34.4m) and €45m (£38.7m), plus bonuses – which isn’t actually that much higher than what they initially put on the table.\nIndeed, there were fears that Ajax might hold out for £50m, but a compromise could be close.\nThere are only two years remaining on Timber’s contract with Ajax, so business at that value is deemed to be ‘a good deal for all parties’ by Plettenberg.\nTimber has also been suggested as a target for Bayern Munich, but Plettenberg says the Bundesliga champions are ‘not involved at this stage’. It potentially leaves the path clear for Arsenal to sign him.\nBy doing so, they would be able to offer the coveted defender his first taste of Premier League football. Arsenal will also be in the Champions League in the upcoming campaign.\nTimber already has experience of UEFA’s top competition from his time with Ajax, so could be the kind of reinforcement Arsenal need to prepare themselves.\nArsenal ready to find role for Timber\nThere might be some question marks about the exact role he will fill at Arsenal – who have been using another natural centre-back, Benjamin White, on the right-hand side of their back four this season.\nIt is similar to their pursuit of Chelsea’s Kai Havertz to reinforce their attack. An obvious role for the German to fill isn’t clear, but his ability to operate in a variety of positions has encouraged Arsenal to go ahead.\nTherefore, they are ready to put their faith in Timber as they look to construct a squad that can build on the promise they showed this season while finishing as runners up to Manchester City in the Premier League, having led the way for a long time.\nREAD MORE: Havertz deal spooks Arsenal forward with West Ham among three clubs ready to pounce",
