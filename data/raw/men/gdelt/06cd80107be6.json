Rose has won two and drawn two of his four meetings with Bayern.\nLast year however, Leipzig met eventual champions Man City in the last 16.\nA 1-1 draw in Germany was followed up by a 7-0 thumping in Manchester, with Haaland -- who played under Rose at Salzburg -- scoring five goals before Pep Guardiola took him off in the 63rd minute.\nCity's 2-1 defeat at Wolves on Saturday followed a midweek defeat to Newcastle in the League Cup, the first time they have lost two in a row since January.\nBut they remain top of the Premier League and are a force to be reckoned with.\nRose said on Saturday \"there's no secret what we've got waiting for us\" but was confident \"we'll get our chances there.\"\n\"We'll try and do better than we did in Manchester a few months ago, but I have complete trust in the boys that they're up for it.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
