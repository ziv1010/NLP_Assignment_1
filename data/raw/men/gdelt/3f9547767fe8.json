  "body_text": "Tottenham are yet again on the hunt for a new manager after sacking Ange Postecoglou and there is a clear favourite for the job: Thomas Frank.\nWinning the Europa League and ending Spurs’ 17-year wait for a trophy was not enough to save Postecoglou, with Daniel Levy unable to overlook the club’s horrific Premier League season.\nAfter finishing 17th in the table, losing a record 22 games and with the return of Champions League football on the cards, whoever takes over in the dugout will have an almighty task on their hands.\nBrentford boss Frank has emerged as the leading contender following his impressive work in west London and reports say the Bees are expecting an approach from Tottenham very soon.\nBut is the Dane the right fit for Spurs and how could the Lilywhites line-up under him?\nAt a glance:\nThomas Frank’s managerial career\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nFollowing a practically non-existent playing career, Thomas Frank worked as a youth coach in Denmark for 18 years, in which time he managed various youth levels of the national team.\nHis first venture into senior management came at Danish Superliga side Brondby before moving to Brentford in December 2016, initially as an assistant manager to Dean Smith before getting the top job two years later.\nIn 2021, Frank guided the Bees to victory in the Championship play-off final, returning to the club to the top-flight for the first time in 74 years, where they have remained ever since.\nUnder the 51-year-old, Brentford have finished no higher than ninth and no lower than 16th, impressive given their relatively tight budget, with a net spend of £161.2million over the past four years.\nThomas Frank’s tactical style and possible Tottenham line-up\nFrank has made a name for himself by getting the best out of unlikely and less well-known players, turning the likes of Ivan Toney, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoanne Wissa into some of the Premier League’s best forwards.\nThe Dane’s attacking philosophy centres around high-pressing, direct and vertical play, creating numerical overloads which overwhelm opposition defences and proficiency from set-pieces. In theory, Tottenham should be able to adapt to easily.\nLast season, Brentford were the fifth-highest goalscorers in the Premier League with 66 – two more than Spurs. It should be noted however that they conceded 57 – just eight better than Tottenham’s leaky defence.\nFrank is not set on one formation, often changing between a 4-3-3 and 3-5-2 depending on players’ form and opposition.\nIf using the former, Tottenham under Frank would line-up pretty much the same way as they did under Postecoglou, but a back-three system might give fans PTSD from Antonio Conte’s toxic time in north London.\nWhich other managers are in the running?\nIt is far from a certainty that Frank will get the Tottenham job, with fellow London-based Premier League managers Marco Silva and Oliver Glasner also frontrunners.\nMore Trending\nSilva’s high tempo style of play is well-liked and has helped re-establish Fulham as solid top-flight team but does the Portuguese fancy his chances of managing in the Champions League again?\nGlasner may use a back-three formation like Conte but his tactics are completely different and by winning the FA Cup with Crystal Palace and the Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt, it’s clear the Austrian can achieve with an underdog club.\nAndoni Iraola is also a contender after his Bournemouth side finished ahead of Brentford, Fulham and Palace last season, while former Spurs players turned managers Kieran McKenna and Michael Carrick could be options, though their Premier League credentials are lacking.\nAnd last but certainly not least is arguably the club’s best manager of the Premier League era: Mauricio Pochettino. Still loved by many fans, he could be tempted to return but surely not until after the 2026 World Cup where he’ll be managing host nation USA.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Cristiano Ronaldo makes ‘very difficult’ Lionel Messi claim ahead of Club World Cup\nMORE: Chelsea make swap deal offer to sign €60m Barcelona star in summer transfer window\nMORE: John Obi Mikel calls for three more Chelsea signings but fears one star will leave",
