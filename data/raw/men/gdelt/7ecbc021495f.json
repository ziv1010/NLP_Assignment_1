Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nAsked about Mbappe and Rodrygo’s ability after Real Madrid knocked Man City out of Europe, Bellingham told CBS Sports: ‘Kylian is unbelievable. Everyone knows what a special player he is.\n‘That start of the season was difficult for him, adjusting to a new team, incredible pressure, unimaginable for most players.\n‘But it was only a matter of time before he got started and as soon as the goals came, it was always going to be a different level of player.\n‘You give him the ball and he can make something happen in any situation. It’s terrifying for most defenders to play against.\n‘Rodrygo is so underrated. For me, he’s probably the most talented and most gifted player in the squad. The things he can do with a football…\n‘We’ll be messing around in training and he’ll flick the ball up and we’re all like, “how did you do that?” I’m trying to copy him and I’m twisting my ankles.\n‘It’s a pleasure to play with both of them. They affect and win games for us. Another thing to mention with Rodrygo is he sacrifices the most.\n‘It’s clear that his favourite position is on the left but he does a lot for the team defensively on the right side and he never complains, he just gets on with it.’\nReal Madrid will face city rivals Atletico or German club Bayer Leverkusen in the last-16 of the Champions League.\nMore Trending\nAssessing Madrid’s performance against Man City, Bernabeu boss Carlo Ancelotti said: ‘This has been the complete performance.\n‘Attack, defence, with the ball and without the ball, we showed such high levels of quality. We created so many goal chances. Almost the perfect night.’\nPlayer of the Match Mbappe added: ‘This was a perfect night. We wanted to win and this was how to do it.\n‘To us, it’s logical that Madrid are in the quarter-final. We gave everything in front of our home fans and we won because we produced a great performance against City, who are always difficult to play.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Man City vs Liverpool: Latest team news, predicted lineups and injuries\nMORE: Chelsea stance on Cole Palmer transfer after Champions League release clause claim\nMORE: Cody Gakpo injury update issued by Arne Slot ahead of Liverpool vs Man City",
