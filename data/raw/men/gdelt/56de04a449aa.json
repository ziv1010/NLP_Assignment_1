  "body_text": "African Stars coach Prince Koffie believes his side have it in them to beat the top clubs on the continent, following Saturday’s 2-1 success over Zambia’s Power Dynamos in a CAF Champions League first leg preliminary round clash in Johannesburg.\nPeter Adiwoh and Edmund Kambanda were on target for the Namibian champions, while Andy Boyeli’s consolation will give the Zambians a fighting chance when they host Stars in the return leg next weekend.\n“We’re going to stick to our game plan, but obviously our structure or system will change because it’s an away game and we need to be extra compact, so that when we go there we don’t concede and we try to put the ball into their net,” Koffi said.\n“When we go there, we won’t be under pressure. Their fans will expect them to beat us by hook or crook, and by so doing it will put pressure on them. They will try to impress and we’ll just take it easy, try to capitalise on their shortcomings and eliminate them.”\nThe Ghanaian tactician believes he has assembled a “very strong” side, which can can make a real impression in the Champions League.\nThis belief stems from confidence in his own ability and the team’s performances in six matches under him.\nStars impressed on their return to Africa’s premier club competition, taking the lead through Ghanaian import Adiwoh 25 minutes into the hard-fought encounter.\nThe away side drew level just before the break through last season’s Zambian top-flight leading goalscorer Boyeli, before Kambanda got the winner for Stars just after the hour mark at the Dobsonville Stadium.\n“I’m very optimistic that if our players pay attention to the little details of the game, we can go far. We’ll be able to get to the group stage and beyond.\n“We’re very strong. If we do the needful, we’ll be able to go places as far as this Champions League is concerned.\nThe winner over two legs will face Tanzania glamour club Simba SC, with the coveted group phase beckoning thereafter.\nStars have what it takes to get to that stage for the first time in their history, Koffie said.\n“I’m an optimist. I’m not scared. As a coach, I am very confident. If I don’t meet you, I will not be able to tell whether I can beat you or not,” he said of the potential rivals that lie ahead.\n“I’m the type that doesn’t like to lose. So, even if [record CAF Champions League winners] Al Ahly come and we’re able to pay attention to the details of the game, I don’t think they can beat African Stars,” said Koffie.\nDynamos head coach Mwenya Chipepo intends to shore up his shaky defence and feels they can overturn the narrow deficit inside the Leevy Mwanawasa Stadium cauldron in Ndola.\n“I can say the team played good football today. I’m happy with how the guys played despite losing the game. It’s a pity we conceded very easy goals, we struggled to clear the balls in the [penalty] area,” Chipepo said in post match analysis.\n“We also created a lot of chances but we missed them. We’ve scored one goal which is good for us and we just have to make sure that in the return at home, we beat them. We can win 1-0, 2-0 or even 3-0.”\nIn other preliminary action on Saturday, Orlando Pirates of South Africa returned to the CAF Champions League with a 1-0 away win at Djabal FC in the Comoros.\nIn Mali, Real Bamako were held goalless by Coton Sport de Garoua of Cameroon, with Bo Rangers of Sierra Leone also held 1-1 at home to Liberia’s LISCR FC while Rwanda’s APR and Somalian side Gaadiidka FC playing out the same scoreline in Kigali.\nIn an age of information overload, Sunrise is The Namibian’s morning briefing, delivered at 6h00 from Monday to Friday.
