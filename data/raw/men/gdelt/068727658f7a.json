Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘He’s good at finishing, has a lot of magic… and he works very hard. I can say this: with Estevao, Brazil have a guaranteed future.\n‘He’s a very talented player. He is able to show every game, in Chelsea too, and he doesn’t need a lot of minutes to show his quality.\n‘He can play five minutes and he can show his quality. I think the Brazil national team is really lucky to have him, and also Chelsea.’\nEstevao scored Brazil’s opening goal against Senegal on Saturday before Manchester United midfielder Casemiro doubled their lead.\nBrazil, who have already qualified for next summer’s World Cup, play Tunisia in another friendly on Tuesday.\nGiven Estevao’s form for club and country, some Chelsea fans want him to get even more game-time for the Blues.\nEstevao was only on the bench for Chelsea’s last Premier League game against Wolves, for example, before coming on for the final 30 minutes.\n‘His talent is top,’ Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said after the Wolves win. ‘Again, we are trying to help him adapt and give him the right minutes, and he’s doing fantastic.\n‘He will be for this club, in the next five or ten years, a top, top player.’\nAsked if it was proving difficult to stop the hype surrounding Estevao, Maresca added: ‘Absolutely, yes.\n‘I said already twice the reason why fans pay tickets is because they want to see players like Estevao and like Cole [Palmer] because people are happy when they are on the pitch.\nMore Trending\n‘The only difference is Estevao arrived from Brazil, he needs to adapt a little bit. Slowly, slowly, he’s going to start games for us in the future.\n‘I was very worried before this game because they are the worst games, they are tricky games because everyone is thinking it’s going to be easy.\n‘I can understand first half people were not happy because we didn’t score, not because of the performance, to be honest.\n‘And then when Estevao was on the pitch the energy raised because people loved that kind of player, so we are happy he can help the team and the fans can be happy.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Manchester United cleared to sign Ruben Amorim’s £100m transfer target\nMORE: Sir Alex Ferguson hails ‘outstanding’ Manchester United signing in message to Ruben Amorim\nMORE: Tottenham handed another injury blow ahead of Arsenal showdown",
