Much in the background that we are never party to.\n11 Posted 11/07/2023 at 00:00:49\n12 Posted 12/07/2023 at 00:35:20\n13 Posted 12/07/2023 at 01:27:54\n14 Posted 12/07/2023 at 03:55:22\n15 Posted 12/07/2023 at 03:59:21\n16 Posted 12/07/2023 at 05:00:51\n17 Posted 12/07/2023 at 05:26:25\n18 Posted 12/07/2023 at 06:16:51\n19 Posted 12/07/2023 at 06:41:20\nThen again, I didn't know an awful lot about James Garner, but the now 22 year old (4 months past his Birthday), has impressed once we got him playing.\nSteady on the ball, looks for a forward pass. Just give him options. A lot of potential from what I've seen with the naked eye.\nLet's see what the transfer window brings. For those who lived the Moyes years, which includes most on here I would imagine, we're accustomed to the odd 2359 on deadline day deal. Strap in an buckle up.\nI am going to make the assumption that the manager is quietly going about his business. Just as he did when he came in last season and ignored the Billy not-so-Smart's circus upstairs and focussed on the pitch and players backed by the supporters.\nHis language after the latest Great Escape suggested that. No love in with Kenwright compared to his predecessor who surprised me with his praise for the great Everton impersonator. Especially given his connection with the supporters. If he did get Everton, he didn't get that.\nThere is a total disconnect between supporters and club and that will remain until the obvious is removed or retires. I don't care if he goes gracefully. He just needs to go. Then we can move on. Will it mean success or competitiveness? Who knows, but we need that final change to happen otherwise the streets around Goodison will be full of protests and banners and the players can do without it.\nDo the honourable thing and accept failure. Accept you are not wanted. Go.\nHe's made his money. Just leave us and the team to it like you have done anyway.\nPre-season on the horizon. It's nearly August. We have a team to support. But if he is still in his vacant seat by then, I think many will go toxic or, worse still, vote with their feet. I speak to very loyal Evertonians and yes, it has come to that.\nWake up and smell the coffee as they say. If not, try smelling salts.\n20 Posted 12/07/2023 at 06:43:24\nLiverpool reserve and reject.\nYou just never know.\n21 Posted 12/07/2023 at 07:36:39\nAmad Diallo prefers attacking from the right and did very well last season in the Championship. I don't know really what to expect from Elanga because I haven't seen enough, but I would be more excited about us going for Diallo.\n22 Posted 12/07/2023 at 07:40:24\nWe are staying up, we are staying up.\n23 Posted 12/07/2023 at 07:57:33\nRumours that the MSP deal is nearing completion have began circulating on Newsnow Everton, and like I said the other day, if anyone within the club has any sense then Kenwright will depart and Everton should bring in three or four new players in the same week?\nI was looking at James Garner the other day, and started thinking has he got enough energy to play in a two man midfield? Maybe that tactic is outdated in the modern game, but my belief is that no tactics are outdated, just as long as you have got the players to adapt?\n24 Posted 12/07/2023 at 08:17:38\nGueye and Doucoure in front with the latter bombing forward as he did towards the end of last season.\nIt would all be a bit fluid.\nInterestingly, from what I've seen on him, Lewis Warrington is a similar type of player, although no two players are the same.\n25 Posted 12/07/2023 at 08:27:28\nNot commenting on this player, but generally, when we were criticised for buying their cast-offs, we were finishing in the Top 7 and regularly qualifying for Europe.\nNeville, Howard, and Saha were all excellent signings. Gibson didn't work out due to injury.\n26 Posted 12/07/2023 at 12:08:55\n27 Posted 12/07/2023 at 12:15:38\nIt's a big big world with lots of up-and-coming talent to take a chance on, yet we go for someone who has proved they haven't got what it takes for the Premier League.\nGet off your big fat backsides and find the talent which is out there.\n28 Posted 12/07/2023 at 12:22:54\nI hope Garner does turn out well despite his bad back. I think Kanchelskis was let go because of his gambling problem.\n29 Posted 12/07/2023 at 13:12:18\nIf we don't get some goals we will be in the same position as we were a month ago. For fuck's sake â€” buy a striker.\n30 Posted 12/07/2023 at 13:46:14\n31 Posted 12/07/2023 at 14:02:05\nPlayers may not work out due to many factors that do not rule them out as potential contributors for another club. It could be team specific factors that limit the chances to breakthrough. For many at larger clubs those chances are few and packed with pressure.\nAlso, there could be a simple mismatch in complementary skills with adjacent teammates. We have seen this here with Doucoure and McNeil. Moving a player to a new setting may allow the player unlock the mystery of why that partnership did not work.\nWe obviously don't want to overpay for these possibilities but we would be foolish to discount them to the point of ruling them out.\n32 Posted 12/07/2023 at 15:07:49\nDoes everyone now believe that'll happen?\n33 Posted 12/07/2023 at 15:13:19\n34 Posted 12/07/2023 at 15:16:58\nHe's only 21 so had plenty of time to develop into a useful player. Maybe a loan with buy option might make sense to get a good look at him but if were spending £10m I think there are more exciting options.\n35 Posted 12/07/2023 at 16:08:26\nI know it's too much of a come down for those who remember the good times but I tend to think this profile of player is about spot on for us: young player not quite good enough for a Rich 6 / Champions League place but with plenty of scope to improve if given games.\nHe's obviously got some pace and ability but needs games which he's not going to get at Utd with Garnacho, Sancho, Anthony, Diallo etc all ahead of him now probably and the likes of Shoretire coming through.\n36 Posted 12/07/2023 at 18:36:14\nAlso Johnny Morrissey who was a steal from the RS!\n37 Posted 12/07/2023 at 22:22:50\n38 Posted 12/07/2023 at 23:49:45\nI've done a bit more digging and convinced myself it could be quite a sensible move. Crucially it seems Elanga is a very hard worker who presses well and gets up and down the wing a lot to keep shape and make tackles. He's also good in the air for a winger and has the pace to counter attack swiftly.\nBasically he seems a very good fit for Dyche and at only 21 can be coached to even better things.\nI think there's reason to believe he could have a similar impact to McNeil, even if his shooting isn't as good. At £8m and only 21 I'm not sure we'd lose much money on him. Even if he's a dud for 3 years you can probably shift him for £5-6m.\nCould be a smart move.\n39 Posted 12/07/2023 at 23:56:17\n40 Posted 13/07/2023 at 06:19:54\nJohnny Morrissey was a steal for ten thou but, if memory serves, didn't The Catt sneak in for him while Shankley was on holiday or something and went berserk when he found out on returning as he saw him as Peter Thompson's (no relation) replacement?\nHarry Catterick had that quiet way in the transfer market and I remember both Howard Kendall to Liverpool and Alex Scott to Spurs both being emblazoned across the sports pages. It was also rumoured, although doubtful, that the Preston manager sold Kendall to Everton so he wouldn't displace his son, Gordon Milne, who was the Liverpool incumbent.\n41 Posted 13/07/2023 at 06:44:32\nOr maybe I'm being unfair to the very young Belgian, especially because he's got a lot of talent and has now got his first year in the ultra-competitive Premier League out of the way.\nWe will see, maybe it might even be Iwobi? The next few weeks will tell us a lot, and with every signing being a gamble, hopefully we get it right by selling and signing the right players.\n42 Posted 13/07/2023 at 07:06:33\nIf one does happen, perhaps we'll see 4-3-3 or 4-5-1 with Dwight switching inside?\nPickford\nPatterson Tarkowski Branthwaite Young\nIwobi Garner Onana McNeil Elanga\nCalvert-Lewin (or Cannon or AN Other)\nGot the bones of a team, that!\n43 Posted 13/07/2023 at 07:23:11\n44 Posted 13/07/2023 at 12:36:26\nInteresting move if true.\n45 Posted 13/07/2023 at 13:53:18\n26 games last season, zero goals. That's pretty impressive playing for Man Utd, and against some crap in Europe & Cups.\nWe need to sign goals. There are none in this bloody team. When is anyone at Everton going to wake up to the fact we have sold all our goal-scorers and creators.\nDo not piss £10-15M up the wall on Elanga. Just spend it on good quality loans till we get to the new stadium.\n46 Posted 13/07/2023 at 16:21:36\nHe may have made 26 appearances but the vast majority were as substitute and he only racked up about 700 minutes of game time. It's pretty hard to impact games when only coming on a substitute from time to time.\nI'm not saying I think he'll be a goal machine but I reckon like most players he'll be capable of more if he has a run of starts.\n47 Posted 13/07/2023 at 16:21:36\n48 Posted 13/07/2023 at 17:06:48\nIt's hard to figure out how he's going to do for us. Like backing a young 2-year-old horse with no form, but it's got a good pedigree and comes from a top stable.\nThe £8M figure, probably spread out, means the gamble won't be a painful one if it goes pear-shaped.\n49 Posted 13/07/2023 at 17:08:02\nWhat are we doing about it and, without giving secrets away, are we likely to do anything about it before the window closes? Getting worried with the names I am seeing because they read all wrong and point to no strikers this time round again.\nWe are buggered unless we get our finger out. And if anyone says Billy Liar is looking after it, I'll know we're doomed and it will be my signal to scarper.\n50 Posted 13/07/2023 at 17:13:45\nI've seen nothing to tell me he's much of an upgrade on what we have. And if that's the case, is it not just buying for buying sake?\nOn loan, yeah may be. But £15M with his recent delivery â€“ no chance.\nI'd far rather us sign one good player, and some loans, than buy 3 players we all want to sell next summer.\n51 Posted 13/07/2023 at 19:30:12\nLoan with an option to buy makes more sense.\n52 Posted 13/07/2023 at 20:03:42\nI'm curious which players you think we could realistically sign who could single-handedly score or create enough to ensure we won't get relegated?\nI'm not sure there are that many out there.\nAlso, as we saw last season, I think Dyche's Everton relies on the team rather than certain individuals. I think Elanga could be a really good team player for us. Difficult to judge his potential for goals and assists but I don't see why he couldn't do something similar to McNeil last season.\nA loan with buy option probably makes more sense but, if we were to buy him for around £8M, I honestly think the downside would be pretty low.\n53 Posted 13/07/2023 at 21:25:45\nI read Rodrigo was open to coming here, but said £200k pw. We said it's too much money. He's now looking at Saudi.\n54 Posted 14/07/2023 at 09:00:49\nThey're buying them from leagues that aren't main stream, or that have done well in junior leagues or junior international football. Players that have had good loan moves. Players on the up and have something to prove.\nWe in the main are buying players on the way down.\nAll of us could have put forward Danjuma, Young, Gnoto, and Elanga. And all of us could of put forward Mcneil, Coady, and others like that the year before.\nToure looks interesting - and there will be plentyof players like that in mid table sides around world football who pay a fraction of Evertons wages.\nAn average Joe with no real knowledge:-\nBroja on loan if he is fit.\nDembele on a free looks decent business at his age.\nSome of those Celtic attackers have looked decent and wages won't be an issue.\nBalogun, Madueke, Smith Rowe, Nketiah, Ziyech, I think would all be decent loan moves. Some of these clubs will need to trim the squads and wages bills, so a decent loan fee could get us through a season until we get in bramley moore and another year of ffp drops off.\nI'd love a Cole Palmer on loan, but City don't loan out players of that ilk. Not seen much of Doyle.?.\nEven Vardy at 36 is quick, mobile and knows how to score. For a nominal fee, I think Dyche could still get something from him.\nAre they all likely to give us a better goal return value than Elanga next season for £10-15m? Yes.\n55 Posted 14/07/2023 at 09:44:19\nHowever as long as the player bought is a good fit for the system and decent value then that alone would be a huge improvement on what we've had at Everton for the last 6 years.\nI'm not sure the likes of Balogun, Madueke and Smith Rowe will be available on loan and if they were they would have more attractive suitors than us. Cole Palmer would definitely be worth looking at if available.\nVardy managed only 3 goals in 39 appearances last season so not sure he is offering much goal return.\nContext is everything and its worth remarking that in the only season where Elanga has had any sort of a run of games (2 years ago) he managed 2 goals and 2 assists in 1200 minutes. That's roughly a goal involvement every 3 matches which is pretty good for a 19 year old.\nSince then he's not got much of a look in or consistency as they bought Sancho and Antony for huge sums. He's in a dip of form which is why he's available for £8-10m rather than the £20m he was valued at 2 years ago. But he's only 21 and has plenty of time to settle and improve.\nHe's a kid. Whose shown ability already but needs somewhere to give him a proper chance. If he'd had a season on loan in the championship I bet he'd have a bunch of goals and assists and we'd be having a different conversation. And his price would probably be double.\nI'm not saying it's my dream move but I can see the sense in it and £8m is not much more than we got for Simms. Think he'd do well under Dyche.\n56 Posted 14/07/2023 at 09:54:21\n57 Posted 14/07/2023 at 10:19:04\n58 Posted 14/07/2023 at 10:23:48\n59 Posted 14/07/2023 at 10:29:19\n60 Posted 14/07/2023 at 10:43:18\nWe also bought Kendall when Harry Catterick gave the impression he wasn't interested in signing Howard then got in quick and signed him with Evertonians made up and saying Shankly got lost in the Lake District looking for Kendall !\n61 Posted 14/07/2023 at 11:03:08\n62 Posted 14/07/2023 at 11:36:26\nWe looked so much better with Mina in the team at the end of last year. Not just because of his defending but his calmness on the ball and ability to find a forward pass, often through the press. We don't have anyone else who can do that, or even close to it (except Branthwaite possibly). It still pains me that we spent around £25m on Godfrey when we could have got Saliba or Gabriel; or maybe Botman, Guehi, Fofana, Tapsoba etc. So many good young centre backs around and sadly we signed one who just struggles to position himself well and is not great in the air.\n63 Posted 14/07/2023 at 13:34:46\n64 Posted 14/07/2023 at 13:45:50\n65 Posted 14/07/2023 at 13:58:02\nThat was pretty much the team I had picked to start the season as well although I had Doucoure in the team rather than Elanga on the basis that we don't know who we will be signing to be honest. I hope Cannon can step up but we need to purchase another striker and a descent left back and then possibly won't be fighting relegation again.\n66 Posted 14/07/2023 at 15:53:14\nThere's another loan for you. Plays on the right rather than shoe horning another player onto their wrong side.\nHe's on big wages, but he needs to restart a career and quickly. Another on the down, rather than up.\nHe'd be another gamble.\n67 Posted 14/07/2023 at 22:50:08\nOne of the things I like about Elanga (and Gnonto, Bilal Toure etc) is he'll only be on £40-50k per week.\nPaying big wages to mediocre players is really what got us in this mess!\n68 Posted 19/07/2023 at 21:07:07\n69 Posted 19/07/2023 at 21:25:37\n70 Posted 19/07/2023 at 22:07:31\nI see where you are coming from. But, that starting XI is a couple of injuries away from disaster. There is absolutely no experienced cover.\nAlso, it doesn't recognise the struggles for form and confidence that a number of the younger players will suffer.\nIf Garner, Branthwaite, Patterson, Onana etc lose form and we are stuck in a rut of defeats then they'll be buried for the season.\nThe best business is always done early in a transfer window. Arsenal and Liverpool have done this in 2023. Historically our best business has always been done early. The summer of 2006 proved this as it was the first and probably last time we started to build a team based on signing players early and of a type that we wanted and also required.\nThe current structure seems to not be able to identify the talent that it needs and/or be able to get the deals over the line. It will send us scrambling towards deadline as usual.\nIf Harrison and Gnonto are the players Dyche wants then they should already have been paraded in Everton jerseys. Harrison in particular would be a brilliant signing. Iheanacho for the money being mentioned also.\nPersonally I would think that we would benefit from an experienced centre back too as cover.\nIn addition to those 3 I would sign 2 players without premier league experience as players with potential for us. Preferably cheaper options from abroad or the lower divisions.\n71 Posted 21/07/2023 at 17:40:05\nHarrison a very good call, but unless he has a buy out then Leeds will want to pull our pants down. I suspect Gnonto will end the same way as Elangaâ€¦..priced out for us, then goes to someone Forrest for £10m less than they offered to us under our Brighthouse payment scheme approach.\nThe comment on Garner, Branthwaite, Patterson, Onana is just bizarre too. That's the same for every player regardless of age. Like it or not, but these are the players we can attract and we must take a risk on them. “Experiencedâ€ cover is just dead wages and depreciation, and still being in relegation fight anyway. Dead end strategy.\n72 Posted 21/07/2023 at 18:21:41\nHe's never quite settled. But despite that in his PL career he's managed a goal or assist every 112 minutes. Thats in the PL all time top ten.\nI'm not sure of his injury status. Obviously he has missed some chunks but it doesn't seem any have been really debilitating. They'll have to check that obviously.\nA fit Iheanacho would be a real asset though.\n73 Posted 21/07/2023 at 18:46:28\nInteresting that they wanted Holgate so maybe here's a deal to be struck. I noticed Monaco were after Salisu too but have had their £15m bid knocked back.\n74 Posted 21/07/2023 at 19:13:54\nIheanacho is a decent footballer who has had to fit in around the likes of Vardy and Daka. Never going to be prolific but certainly capable of around 10 per season - which sounds crap but very, very few strikers score more than that (especially since goalscorers often start in wide forward positions now).\nIf he's fairly low cost with manageable - then he's probably a good signing. That's where we're at, people.\n75 Posted 21/07/2023 at 19:15:42\nBut yes, ideally we'd have a high quality partner for Tark with Branthwaite first reserve and given time to bed in.\nThere's lots of high quality CBs out there both young and old. It pains me that we somehow spent over £100m on Williams, Keane, Mina (unlucky there) and Godfrey. So many better options have been around during that time, including Salisu for only £10m and Bella-Kotchap who might be even better!\n76 Posted 21/07/2023 at 19:27:34\nAlso, Iheanacho is a sick note. He is barely fit for 10 games a season.\n77 Posted 22/07/2023 at 22:49:10\n£20M for Sarr who can play on the right, looks a better deal.\n78 Posted 22/07/2023 at 23:24:17\nI guess that is despite him achieving above even half that only once in 6 top years.\nSaying he was behind Aguero and Vardy is like saying Rickie Lambert was a god, but just undervalued to be behind Sterling. Mind-bogglingly stupid. He's a poor man's backup at best.\nWith regard to Elanga, I think he's thrown his dummy out because we chose Danjuma for 1/5th of the outlay. Hopefully the next Lingard.\nIan B - if we could get Sarr for Gnonto money (or Elanga + £5M) I think that'd prove a masterstroke.\n79 Posted 28/07/2023 at 20:42:23\nWahi at Montpellier is a goal machine â€“ going for about £20-25M.\nBoth look decent shouts.\n80 Posted 28/07/2023 at 20:55:13\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
