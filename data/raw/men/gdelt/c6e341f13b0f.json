Diogo Costa spared Portugal's blushes with a terrific save to deny Benjamin Sesko in the dying embers and three penalty stops in the shootout.\nRoberto Martinez's side simply must improve if they harbour genuine hopes of reaching the semi-finals. A match-up with France, the side they beat 1-0 in the final of this competition eight years ago, will push them to their limits, even if Les Bleus have underwhelmed in Germany so far.\nWith some enormous decisions to make, Martinez must get the big calls right to give Portugal a fighting chance of overcoming the 2022 World Cup finalists.\nPortugal predicted lineup vs France (4-2-3-1)\nGK: Diogo Costa - If Portugal go on to win Euro 2024, Costa will have been the deciding factor. His heroics in the last 16 will never be forgotten, with the Porto stopper putting in one of the all-time great displays at a major tournament.\nRB: Joao Cancelo - A relentless showing from Cancelo against Slovenia, who struggled to stifle his creativity in the second half. There are always questions about his defensive acumen, which will be tested fiercely by Kylian Mbappe on Friday.\nCB: Ruben Dias - It was another clean sheet for Dias, who held up his end of the bargain in defence. The Manchester City star didn't put a foot wrong against Slovenia.\nCB: Pepe - The 41-year-old's error almost cost Portugal their place at Euro 2024 last time out, but the veteran was bailed out by his goalkeeper. His spot in the starting lineup isn't in doubt, but he may not be able to play another 120 minutes against France.\nLB: Nuno Mendes - The Paris Saint-Germain defender has impressed at this summer's tournament, chiefly in the final third. Mendes and Barcelona's Jules Kounde will reunite this Friday after enjoying a good battle in last season's Champions League.\nDM: Vitinha - Comfortably Portugal's standout performer at Euro 2024, Vitinha has blossomed in a box-to-box role alongside Joao Palhinha. A classy operator, his energy is just as important as his technical prowess.\nDM: Joao Palhinha - The Fulham destroyer was typically combative against Slovenia and will be even more active against France. He recovered the ball ten times in Portugal's last-16 clash, the most of any outfield player.\nRW: Bernardo Silva - After a quiet display against Slovenia, Silva did at least convert his penalty in the shootout. However, Martinez will need more ingenuity from him moving forward, especially against a stubborn France backline yet to concede from open play.\nAM: Bruno Fernandes - Also smashing home his spot kick in the shootout, Fernandes was similarly quiet against Slovenia. However, he still managed to forge four chances for teammates, which was the most of any player on the pitch.\nLW: Rafael Leao - Whether Leao should start on Friday is worth pondering, with the Milan star having been extremely underwhelming this tournament. With Diogo Jota and Francisco Conceicao impressing during their cameos, his starting spot is in jeopardy.\nST: Cristiano Ronaldo - One man who categorically shouldn't start but likely will anyway is Ronaldo. He has actually proved a burden for Portugal, who are more or less playing with ten players when the Al Nassr forward leads the line. Immobile and no longer as clinical as he once was, Ronaldo is still yet to score at Euro 2024.",
