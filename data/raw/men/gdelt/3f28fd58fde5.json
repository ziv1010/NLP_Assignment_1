  "body_text": "THE Newcastle Jets' Australia Cup success secured the club a long overdue piece of silverware and a place in the lucrative Asian Champions League 2 competition next year.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nCoach Mark Milligan also believes it gave his inexperienced squad a false indication of what was ahead in the A-League.\nSunday's 2-1 defeat to Perth Glory at home was the Jets' third straight loss and left them bottom of the ladder on three points after five rounds.\nIt is in stark comparison to the five-game cup run, which included victories over A-League rivals Adelaide and Macarthur.\n\"Maybe the run through pre-season gave them a false indication of how hard it is, not only to play the football we want, but get results in the A-League,\" Milligan said after the loss to Perth.\n\"It is a very competitive league. Maybe that (Australia Cup) gave us a bit of false confidence there. We need to make sure that is reined back in.\"\nIt was an improved performance against the Glory, but the Jets were again their own worst enemy.\nThe home side went ahead in the 15th minute through a beautifully worked goal to Xavier Bertoncello.\nPerth, who hadn't scored a goal since round one, were there to be taken.\nAfter failing to convert a series of chances, the Jets gave the visitors a lifeline through a turnover just before half-time.\nThe visitors grabbed all three points after a controversial penalty for handball in the 79th minute was converted by Nick Pennington.\n\"It was a little bit naive from us. We have to understand in those moments you have to go and take a team's soul,\" Milligan said.\n\"We need to get much better in terms of our decision making. We allowed them back into it from the decisions we made.\"\nIt's not quite crunch time yet, but the next four games before Christmas could shape their play-off hopes.\nThey are away to second-placed Auckland on Sunday, welcome premiers Melbourne City to McDonald Jones Stadium, before another trip to New Zealand to tackle Wellington and a visit by Sydney.\nThe Jets have the youngest squad in the A-League but Milligan said the players - and staff - had to be accountable.\n\"Yes, it's a young team. But if you look at world football, that is football now. We are still looking at these players at 21 and 22 as young players. In the world of football they are not young players.\n\"They are inexperienced because they haven't played 50 or 60 A-League games. They have to go through these moments to learn. We have to stay on top of them, but we also have to hold them, as well as myself and the staff, accountable.\"\nMilligan made four changes for the Perth game.\nTom Aquilina was relegated to the bench and import Joe Shaughnessy was dropped from the squad.\nMax Cooper started alongside Aleks Susnjar in the heart of defence and Joel Bertolissio was promoted for his first start at right back.\nLachie Rose and Xavier Bertoncello also came into the XI for Ben Gibson and Lachie Bayliss.\nRose was a constant threat and could have had a hat-trick on another night.\nBertoncello made the most of his opportunity with a goal - his first in the A-League.\nThe 20-year-old winger won possession near the touchline and centred the ball to Will Dobson. He found Alex Badolato, who slid a pass in for Bertoncello to lift a shot over keeper Matt Sutton.\n\"It felt good to score my first goal but the loss dims the celebrations a bit,\" Bertoncello said.\n\"My game is to run in behind, make runs and find space.\n\"I scored a similar goal in training on Saturday.\n\"It was an instinctive finish. The ball came to my feet and I just thought: 'get it on target and make the keeper work'.\"\nMilligan was \"over the moon\" for Bertoncello, who returned to the XI after playing off the bench against Brisbane.\n\"He is one who works extremely hard,\" Milligan said. \"We had to freshen him up a little bit. He has had a very long year. A couple of them have.\"\nBertoncello, who was part of the premiership-winning youth team in 2024, admitted it had taken him time to adjust to the A-League.\n\"The A-League is a big step up from the Australian Cup, but Millsy has always backed us young boys,\" he said.\n\"There is no easy week. Every team can beat anyone. Perth were coming last and beat us. Now we are coming last.\n\"It feels weird to be bottom of the table. I'm not used to it. I want to change that for the fans. I know how much they want us to do well.\"",
