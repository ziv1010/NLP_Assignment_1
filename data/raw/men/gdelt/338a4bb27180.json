That’s despite the fact he had his best season in Chelsea colours last term.\nIndeed, the Englishman scored 11 goals alongside 10 assists in his 32 Premier League games.\nWhile that would suggest the relationship between him and the side is a good one, it seems to have broken down of late. This season has seen 16 new faces walk through the door at Stamford Bridge.\nThe biggest names will be making big money. That’s been identified by Mount, and he reportedly felt, amid contract negotiations, he was deserving to be paid in line with the biggest earners.\nAs it stands, that’s not happened, and talks were shelved in February.\nMultiple sides will be waiting in the wings to take Mount on board of he is to leave Chelsea. That group has consisted of Manchester City, Newcastle United, Liverpool and Arsenal.\nHowever, the former pair have reportedly dropped out of the race, leaving the other two clubs to battle it out.\nMerson brands Chelsea, Mount situation ‘ridiculous’\nMerson feels there should be no chance of Mount leaving Chelsea. He is baffled that with the amount of players in the squad, the England international is the one that looks most likely to leave.\n“There are 30 players there, it’s ridiculous. For me, you’ve got to keep Mason Mount straight away.” he said on Sky Sports News.\n“Mount looks like the one going [this summer], and you’re like ‘wow’.\n“All right, he hasn’t been great this season and hasn’t been playing a lot because of his injury, but he was one of their standout players last season and one of England’s best players. So, for me, it needs to change quickly.”\nMount exit raises questions\nIt seems fair for Merson to question why Chelsea would let Mount go. He’s been one of their most vital assets in each of his four seasons playing senior football at the club.\nThat’s despite the fact his first campaign was his inaugural season in the Premier League, following loan spells at Vitesse Arnhem and Derby County.\nIt begs the question, why won’t Chelsea pay him what he wants? They must be paying some of their most lucrative recent signings a decent sum and they’ve not yet contributed anything to the side.\nWhereas, Mount has been directly involved in 70 goals in 195 Chelsea games, and has won the Champions League with them – directly contributing to four goals in 11 games during that triumphant campaign.\nHe certainly seems deserving of a good wage and it seems fair for him to ask for that, given people who have not been part of Chelsea’s successes will be getting it.\nREAD MORE: Man Utd frustrate Chelsea with sensational wing-back snare taking shape in £60million move",
