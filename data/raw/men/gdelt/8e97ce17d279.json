Numerous discussions have since taken place in an attempt to find an amicable solution to this scheduling conflict between the league and UEFA.\n“Despite our best efforts to seek alternative options which would allow us to play both matches safely, these have been unsuccessful.\n“It is therefore with sincere regret that we are left with no other option than to confirm the postponement of next weekend’s WSL fixture.\n“We are extremely disappointed with the outcome but wish to reiterate that player welfare and the impact on our supporters are of the utmost importance to us.”\nA statement from the Women’s Professional Leagues Limited (WPLL), the independent entity that as of this season oversees the top two tiers of English women’s football, read: “Due to the scheduling of Chelsea’s first UWCL group-stage game, the BWSL game between Chelsea and Manchester United, due to take place on Sunday, October 6, has been postponed.\n“We apologise for any inconvenience to fans. In this instance, we have to put player welfare first and we will announce a new date for the fixture in due course.\n“We thank the clubs and Sky Sports for their understanding as we work on a resolution.”\nThe same statement was posted on Manchester United’s club website.\nUEFA said in a statement: “More than one year ago and in accordance with the competition regulations, UEFA established the Women’s Champions League match calendar, highlighting the two possible match days available in every match week and communicated it to national associations, leagues and clubs to allow advance planning.\n“For the Women’s Champions League group stage draw, there are two well-established draw principles concerning teams from the same national association.\n“The first prevents teams from the same national association from being drawn into the same group and the second pairs two teams, in this case the highest seeds Arsenal and Chelsea, to ensure that they play on different days of every match week.\n“These principles have been clearly communicated in advance and have been common practice since the introduction of the Women’s Champions League group stage in the 2021-22 season.”",
