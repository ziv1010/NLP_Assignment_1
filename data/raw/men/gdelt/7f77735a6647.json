We are disappointed in that sense but as well we are very aware that we only want to bring certain kinds of players and we have to be very disciplined with that as well. I think that we were.\n\"It's in the profile, a player that we believe can make us much better. Financially there is a lot of ways, a lot of things that we must stay in the lane that has taken us this far and from there try to improve.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Sport before Arteta's news conference, football finance expert Kieran Maguire explained that Arsenal's lack of business was a decision made in a tough market for buyers.\n\"As far as the market they would be looking at [is concerned] there are relatively few players,\" Maguire said.\n\"We've got the extension of the Champions League and Europa League [into January] so clubs were reluctant to sell.\n\"So if Arsenal wanted to recruit they've really got to go into a rarefied market. I guess they felt there wasn't somebody who would improve the starting XI or regular 16.\"\nArteta said the Arsenal front line will have to be \"flexible\" and that he might have to \"try something different\" because of injuries.\nThree players left Arsenal during the window, with defenders Ayden Heaven, 17, and Josh Robinson, 20, joining Manchester United and Wigan Athletic respectively.\nBrazilian attacker Marquinhos joined Cruzeiro on loan until the end of the season.\nArsenal are second in the Premier League following Sunday's 5-1 win over Manchester City, six points behind leaders Liverpool having played one game more.\nLatest Stories\n-\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n10 minutes -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n55 minutes -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n2 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n2 hours -\nCocoa crisis, galamsey complicity and election credibility to dominate this Saturday’s Newsfile\n3 hours -\nINTERPOL deletes Red Notice for Ofori-Atta as extradition process continues — OSP confirms\n3 hours -\nMasterMinds resources positions itself as key player in skills development and workforce training\n5 hours -\nINTERPOL has deleted Ofori-Atta’s Red Notice – Lawyers\n5 hours -\nSteven Spielberg donates $25,000 to James Van Der Beek’s $2m GoFundMe\n5 hours -\nSix possible effects of Trump’s climate policy change\n6 hours -\nBooming Indicators, Dying Rivers: Ghana under Chronic Environmental Poisoning\n6 hours -\nWorld’s rules-based order ‘no longer exists’, Germany’s Merz warns\n6 hours -\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n6 hours -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n6 hours -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n7 hours",
