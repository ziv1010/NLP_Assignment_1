  "body_text": "There will soon be just eight teams left in this season’s Champions League, as the competition reaches its quarter-final stage.\nA handful of Europe’s biggest clubs look set to make up a stellar cast after a largely underwhelming first knockout round.\nEight teams have now booked safe passage to the quarter-final after this week’s action.\nSo here is everything you need to know about the upcoming Champions League draw.\nAdvertisement\nWhen is the Champions League draw?\nThe draw will take place on Friday, March 15 at 11am GMT/12pm CET/7am ET/4am PT.\nIt will be hosted at the UEFA headquarters — officially known as the House of European Football — in Nyon, Switzerland.\nMore Champions League on The Athletic…\n- UEFA’s new Champions League: Thursday matches, a ‘seeding table’ and no Saudi teams\n- Xavi hits back at Barcelona critics after Champions League progess: ‘Who’s laughing now?’\nWhich rounds will be drawn?\nInterest will be highest for the quarter-final as that is the round that will be played first, but UEFA will also include the semi-final draw as part of Friday’s event.\nIt means that the road to the final can be fully mapped out for the eight teams that have made into the quarter-final and avoids everyone having to fly back into Switzerland in a few weeks for four balls to be pulled out of a Champions League-branded bowl. It is an open draw — meaning teams from the same nation can now face one another.\nThere is also a ‘draw’ for the final, which is largely irrelevant. But it is used to determine which side of the draw will produce the ‘home’ team for the final at Wembley Stadium.\nAn hour later (12pm GMT/8am ET/5am PT), the same will be done for the Europa League and at 1pm GMT (9am ET/6am PT), the draws for the Europa Conference League will be made.\nHow to follow the Champions League draw\nThe Athletic\nwill provide live updates from the draw in Nyon as they happen.\nOtherwise, you will be able to follow a stream for the draws on UEFA.com while, in the UK, TNT Sport will be broadcasting the draws for all three competitions.\nParamount+ will be doing the same in the US.\nWhich teams will be involved?\nManchester City and Paris Saint-Germain cruised into the quarter-finals after making relatively light work of their last-16 ties against Copenhagen and Real Sociedad.\nThey will be joined in that draw by Bayern Munich and Real Madrid who, despite favourable draws, were far from convincing across their two-legged ties against Lazio and RB Leipzig.\nConfirmed quarter-finalists\n- Bayern Munich\n- Manchester City\n- Paris Saint-Germain\n- Real Madrid\n- Barcelona\n- Arsenal\n- Borussia Dortmund\n- Atletico Madrid\nOn Tuesday, Arsenal defeated Porto 4-2 on penalties following a 1-1 aggregate scoreline to advance to a first Champions League quarter-final since 2010. Barcelona, meanwhile, beat Napoli 3-1 after drawing 1-1 in the first leg.\nAdvertisement\nAtletico overcame a 1-0 deficit from the first leg to defeat Inter 3-2 on penalties following a 2-1 win that initially levelled the tie. Dortmund, meanwhile, secured a 2-0 home victory after a 1-1 draw in Eindhoven three weeks ago.\nChampions League key dates\n- Quarter-final first leg: April 9 & 10\n- Quarter-final second leg: April 16 & 17\n- Semi-final first leg: April 30, 2024 & May 1\n- Semi-final second leg: May 7, 2024 & May 8\n- Final: June 1, 2024\n(Top photo: Maria de Gracia Jiménez/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images)",
