  "body_text": "Trending\nPanaji: Despite a truncated season that will have just 13 matches — instead of the minimum stipulated 24 — in the Indian Super League (ISL), Indian clubs will still be eligible to compete in Asian competitions next season.There were fears that India would miss out on continental competitions after failing to meet the 24-match, eight-month criteria due to a delayed season. But the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has told the All India Football Federation (AIFF) that the ISL champions will still get to play in the AFC Champions League Two but will have to navigate a single-leg playoff. “Member Associations that fail to fulfil the Member Association Eligibility Criteria shall be eligible to be allocated only indirect slots for the relevant AFC Club Competition. In such cases, the number of direct slots for the relevant Member Association in the relevant AFC Club Competition shall be wholly converted into indirect slots,” AFC’s deputy general secretary (competitions & football) wrote to AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan on Thursday.India previously had two continental slots. While the ISL champion qualified directly for the group stages of ACL2, Super Cup winners were rewarded with a playoff spot in the same competition.\nEnd of Article\nFollow Us On Social Media",
