Not in a million years he’s a Man United midfielder.\n‘That’s just one example of the recruitment and how they keep getting it wrong. They keep getting it wrong all the time with the players they’re bringing in and that’s a fact.’\nEven his then-manager Amorim stuck the boot in on Ugarte, saying he was struggling in November last year.\n‘He is struggling in the moment, but it is our job to try to help our players and again, everything can change,’ said Amorim.\n‘You saw it five weeks ago, the environment was completely different, so I know that Ugarte is struggling in the moment, and my job is trying to help him to feel as a player, like I felt when he was a Sporting player, for example.\nManuel Ugarte Premier League stats\nApps: 45\nGoals: 1\nAssists: 2\nPass completion: 87%\nTackles: 116\nYellow cards: 12\nRed cards: 0\n‘But it is a different world and he needs to adapt and he needs to improve, especially in training.’\nPerhaps the most stinging criticism came from ESPN pundit and former Chelsea midfielder Craig Burley, though, who said of the Red Devils flop: ‘Manuel Ugarte is just absolutely nothing. He’s just like a wet blanket.\nMore Trending\n‘Put him in with the kids and even the kids would be going, “Who the hell is this guy?” Seriously.’\nThe criticism has also come from a legendary name in Marco van Basten, who was stunned by how much Manchester United paid for Ugarte shortly after they signed him.\n‘I saw a new player walking around at Manchester United, Ugarte, for €50M! How is this guy walking around there?’ Van Basten questioned.\n‘It’s idiotic how much he [Ten Hag] has decided to invest in players who are not even good!’\nMORE: David Beckham slammed for ‘disowning’ Brooklyn by former Man Utd teammate\nMORE: Manchester United offered chance to make shock signing of former Chelsea star\nMORE: Rio Ferdinand mocks Jamie Carragher over criticism of Manchester United star",
