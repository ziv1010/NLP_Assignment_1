Borussia Dortmund fans taking the chance to make a very public stand.\nThe same after the match, countless articles written about how the Newcastle United owners had been shown up.\nTypical of them was a report from Four Four Two that had the headline ‘Newcastle United owners sent stunning message by Borussia Dortmund fans, following European defeat’\nOh hang on though…\n‘You don’t care about the sport – All you care about is money!’ read the Borussia Dortmund fans’ banner\nAnother banner held up showing three of the massive culprits in the eyes of Dortmund fans.\nAmanda Staveley, Yasir Al-Rumayyan and Jamie Reuben?\nPerhaps not.\nInstead the three figures represented were FIFA president Gianni Infantino, PSG president Nasser Al Khelaifi and former chairman of Juventus Andrea Agnelli.\nWhat has this got to do with the Newcastle United owners, or indeed NUFC at all?\nWhich is the point.\nThe lazy media yet again clueless.\nThe Dortmund fans were protesting against those they see ruining football in Europe and indeed worldwide, it was nothing to do with NUFC or its owners.\nThe changes to the Champions League that will come into force next season, one of the key reasons for the protests. Dortmund fans seeing this, quite correctly, as simply a drive to generate more and more cash via ever more additional matches.\nDortmund fans threw fake money and gold bars on the pitch against Newcastle to protest against #UCL reforms. Also a banner saying, “You don’t care about the sport – all you care about is money.” pic.twitter.com/xUM181qAub\n— Ben Jacobs (@JacobsBen) November 7, 2023\nStats via BBC Sport:\nBorussia Dortmund 2 Newcastle 0 – Tuesday 7 November 5.45pm\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nBorussia Dortmund:\nFullkrug 26, Brandt 79\nPossession was Dortmund 46% Newcastle 54%\nTotal shots were Dortmund 17 Newcastle 10\nShots on target were Dortmund 8 Newcastle 5\nCorners were Dortmund 7 Newcastle 4\nReferee: Alejandro José Hernández Hernández\nNewcastle team v Borussia Dortmund:\nPope, Trippier, Lascelles, Schar, Hall (Almiron 45), Longstaff, Bruno, Joelinton, Livramento, Willock (Miley 81), Wilson (Gordon 45)\nSUBS:\nDubravka, Karius, Dummett, De Bolle, Parkinson\n(United missing a spine but not backbone – Borussia Dortmund 2 Newcastle 0 – Read HERE)\n(Borussia Dortmund 2 Newcastle 0 – Match ratings and comments on all of the NUFC players – Read HERE)\n(Borussia Dortmund 2 Newcastle 0 – Instant NUFC fan / writer reaction – Read HERE)\nNewcastle United confirmed matches to mid-January 2024:\nSaturday 11 November 2023 – Bournemouth v Newcastle (5.30pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 25 November 2023 – Newcastle v Chelsea (3pm)\nTuesday 28 November 2023 – PSG v Newcastle (8pm) TNT Sports\nSaturday 2 December 2023 – Newcastle United v Man U (8pm) TNT Sports\nThursday 7 December 2023 – Everton v Newcastle (7.30pm) Amazon\nSunday 10 December 2023 – Tottenham v Newcastle (4.30pm) Sky Sports\nWednesday 13 December 2023 – Newcastle v AC Milan (8pm) TNT Sports\nSaturday 16 December 2023 – Newcastle v Fulham (3pm)\nTuesday 18 December 2023 – Chelsea v Newcastle (8pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 23 December 2023 – Luton v Newcastle (3pm)\nTuesday 26 December 2023 – Newcastle v Forest (12.30pm) Amazon\nMonday 1 January 2024 – Liverpool v Newcastle (8pm) Sky Sports\n(Weekend of Saturday 6 January 2024 – FA Cup third round matches)\nSaturday 13 January 2024 – Newcastle v Man City (5.30pm) TNT Sports\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
