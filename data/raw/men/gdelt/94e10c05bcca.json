They still have Arsenal to play at Anfield, remember.\n‘That same season, City amassed a record 100 points. Liverpool can still hit 94. They have won seven of their last eight league games, during which they have apparently been having a wobble.’\nLiverpool could even outdo the legendary 2019/20 champions\nWhen the Reds won the Premier League in 2020, their eventual winning margin was a whopping 18 points, and even that had been reduced in the closing weeks of the season, with two of their three defeats that term coming after they’d already clinched the title.\nIt’s not unthinkable that there could be a similar subconscious drop-off in the final month of his campaign, but nor is it implausible that they might yet exceed the cavernous gap by which they won the division five years ago.\nIt’s fair to claim that Liverpool haven’t been all-singing and all-dancing in quite a few of their victories this season, but the same could be said of the 2019/20 side which claimed 79 points from the first 81 on offer and accrued a final tally of 99.\nThe Reds’ final four matches this term are against Chelsea (away), Arsenal (home), Brighton (away) and Crystal Palace (home).\nThe west Londoners are still scrapping for a Champions League finish, but the Seagulls’ European hopes may be extinguished by the time we visit the Amex Stadium, while the Eagles will either be jubilant or crestfallen when they come to Anfield, depending on the outcome of the FA Cup final.\nThe Gunners still have that heavyweight European tie against PSG to negotiate, along with a trip to the newly-crowned champions and a home clash against a Newcastle side hunting down a top-five finish, so they could easily fall even further behind Slot’s side.\nAfter all the accusations from the likes of Keys, wouldn’t it be quite the response to win the Premier League by a record points margin this season!",
