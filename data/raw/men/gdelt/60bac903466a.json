The Premier League is where we want to get to.\n\"It's an ambition of mine, one of the club's, and we're putting everything in place to make sure we do that in the near future.\"\nThe 37-year-old said he had wanted to return to English football after his stint in the United States.\n\"I've had opportunities over the last four, six weeks at other clubs as well, to do that,\" he said.\n\"But I think since speaking to Birmingham and seeing the ambitions of the club, where they want to go, where they want to get to, it excited me.\n\"I want to be successful. It's clear this club wants to be successful, and everything we spoke about really was very similar. It was a really easy decision once I'd spoken to them.\"\nThe former England captain was unable to stop Derby being relegated to the third tier in 2022 after the club were deducted 21 points for entering administration and financial breaches.\nHe also failed to take DC United into the MLS play-offs this season.\nRooney was a teenage sensation as a player with boyhood club Everton before he joined Alex Ferguson's Manchester United in 2004.\nHe became United's record goalscorer and won five Premier League titles and the Champions League along with other silverware at the club.\nBirmingham currently occupy the final play-off place in the Championship, 10 points behind Ipswich, who are second in the table, in the second of the automatic promotion spots.\nUS-based Shelby Companies Limited completed a takeover of Birmingham in July, with seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady becoming a minority owner in the club.\n© 2023 AFP",
