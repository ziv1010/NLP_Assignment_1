Speaking at a press conference on Monday Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said Saka and captain Martin Ødegaard – who picked up an ankle injury while on international duty – are both ‘progressing well’.\n“They are closer,” he said. “Both progressing well. Martin is not fit. With Bukayo let’s see how he is with the training session later on.”\nArsenal and Shakhtar Donetsk meet in the second league phase of the newly revamped Champions League, which has seen the group stage system scrapped for a new league phase consisting of 36 clubs.\nEach side will now play eight matches against eight different teams in the new league phase, rather than facing the same three opponents twice. The top eight sides will progress to the round of 16, while the teams placed ninth to 24th will play a two-legged knock-out phase play-off to secure their place in the last 16.\nShakhtar Donetsk currently sit in fourth place of the Ukrainian Premier League, having won six games out of nine. Their last Champions League fixture ended in a 3-0 defeat to Atalanta, which has left them sitting 27th in the table. Arsenal are currently 13th after taking three points from their 2-0 win against PSG earlier this month.\nSo as both sides gear up for their latest European fixture, here’s how you can watch Arsenal vs Shakhtar Donetsk absolutely free.\nREAD MORE: Sky is offering its 'lowest ever' price on TV and broadband if you merge with this bill\nREAD MORE: Top Tech: How to save £150 on an Apple iPad from a little-known corner of Amazon\nWhen is Arsenal vs Shakhtar Donetsk?\nArsenal vs Shakhtar Donetsk is scheduled to kick off at 8pm on Tuesday, October 22, with Gabby Logan leading the coverage from 6.30pm alongside Gael Clichy, Laura Georges and Theo Walcott.
