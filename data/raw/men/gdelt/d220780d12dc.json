See original.\nBy MUHAMMAD IKHSAN MAHAR\n17 Jul 2024 10:24 WIB · English\nIn front of around 80,000 Real Madrid supporters who filled the stands at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, Tuesday (16/7/2024) afternoon local time, Kylian Mbappe introduced as a new player \"Los Blancos\". His biggest dream of wearing a Real shirt has been fulfilled. In the next five seasons, Mbappe is determined to fulfill his lofty goals of preserving Real's tradition of being the best team in Europe and the world.\nEven though he had received an invitation from Zinedine Zidane, a French and Real legend, to visit Real's training center, Ciudad Valdebebas, December 2012, Mbappe's path to Real was not easy. Instead of accepting Real's offer to join the academy team, Mbappe was more interested in staying in France to defend AS Monaco.\n”He almost joined Real, but chose to go to Monaco. \"We knew how very good he was from then on,\" said Zidane in MarcaWednesday edition (17/7/2024).\nZidane accompanied Real President Florentino Perez in welcoming Mbappe's presentation at the Bernabeu. Mbappe hugged Zidane, someone who was very important in realizing his dreams as a football player.\nAlso read: ”Galacticos 3.0” and the Champions League, Key Factors for Mbappe Joining Real Madrid\n\"I was still a child talking to the best player in French history. It was an incredible time. However, I prioritize staying in my own country. I stayed in Monaco,\" Mbappe recounted a flashback 12 years ago.\nAfter four days of engaging in activities in Ciudad Valdebebas, from training to watching Real's best players train and compete, Mbappe returned to France. He has returned to being a normal child. Mbappe's mother, Fayza Lamari, brought her son back to earth after feeling like he was flying due to being at Real Madrid at a young age.\n\"After returning, I washed my belongings for three days. From the peak, I felt like I returned to the bottom. At that time, I thought; what made my mother bring me back to France? When I was young, I didn't understand it. However, if I could relive that time now, I would do the same thing,\" he said.\nAlso read: After Mbappe, What's Next for Real Madrid?\nThrough the decisions of Lamari and his father, Wilfried, Mbappe could become a new phenomenon in French football. They educate Mbappe and his younger brother, Ethan, with discipline. Before breaking into Monaco's main squad in 2015, Mbappe was still washing his own clothes, jersey and football equipment.\nLamari and Wilfried carefully monitor Mbappe's training patterns and nutrition. Despite being a superstar, Mbappe remains close to his parents. Mbappe chose Lamari as his agent. When witnessing Mbappe being introduced to Real, Lamari was caught on camera wiping tears from his cheeks. He was moved that his son could fulfill his dreams.\n\"I finally achieved my dream of becoming a Real Madrid player. This dream came true through hard work. I didn't get it for free,\" said the striker who wears the number nine jersey at Real.\nSimilar to Zidane, Mbappe came to Real Madrid with the status of a World Cup champion and a strong ambition to win the Champions League title. After Zidane was able to achieve this, it is now Mbappe's turn to maintain Real's glory in the world's best inter-club competition.\nAnother thing, Mbappe's parents also enrolled him in a secondary school that taught several foreign languages. At that school, Mbappe showed his great ambition to defend Real by diligently studying the Spanish language.\nTherefore, he did not suddenly learn Spanish in the past year after getting closer to Real Madrid as his contract with Paris Saint-Germain ended. Mbappe showcased his fluency in Spanish during his first press conference as a Real Madrid player.\n\"I'm not the best student at school, but when it comes to Spanish lessons, I always focus 100 percent,\" he said.\nAlso read: Kylian Mbappe, Real Madrid and French Interests\nMbappe also has good English. Kompas 's experience of interviewing Mbappe in the mixed zone after the match between France and Poland in the round of 16 of the 2022 World Cup, Mbappe was willing to answer questions from international journalists in English.\nAlthough he has never had a career in the English League, he did not refuse when asked in English. As for other French players, they only want to be asked in French.\nApart from Zidane, Mbappe also really wants to join Real to follow in the footsteps of his idol, Cristiano Ronaldo. It seems impossible for Mbappe to break Ronaldo's goal record with Los Blancos.\nHowever, Mbappe can emulate Ronaldo's success in winning all titles with Real. The Spanish league, Spanish Cup, Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, and Club World Cup are the trophies that Mbappe must present if he wants to match Ronaldo as the greatest legend of Real in the 21st century.\nIn order to make this happen, Mbappe is ready to carry out the role given by Coach Carlo Ancelotti. Ancelotti's brilliant reputation for bringing out the best performance from his children has become an asset for Mbappe to immediately adapt to Real's system.\n\"I can play in any position in the three striker scheme. I will carry out the tasks as requested by the coach,\" said the scorer of 48 goals for France.\nEven though with his current quality, Mbappe can provide a frightening front line sharpness alongside Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham, Real still feel that Mbappe has not reached his maximum potential. Ancelotti has also prepared a conditioning coach, Antonio Pintus, to improve Mbappe's physique. Spanish media said Mbappe would be Real's Cyborg 2.0project after Ronaldo.\nPintus has also succeeded in improving Bellingham's physical condition. This can be seen from the improved muscle mass of the British skipper. His body looks stronger than when he was still defending Borussia Dortmund. As a result, Bellingham became Real's top scorer and Best Player in the Spanish League 2023-2024.\nAside from turning Mbappe into an unstoppable goal-scoring machine, Real has also devised a plan to improve the club's brand image with Mbappe's presence. Mbappe's grand presentation event is on par with that of Ronaldo, so it is hoped that Mbappe can also boost financial gains in the coming years.\nThat potential was seen when the jersey with Mbappe's nameset sold out before his unveiling at the Bernabeu. Apart from attracting new sponsors, Mbappe is also expected to increase matchday revenue related to match ticket sales.\nReferring to the 2023 Money League, Real's matchday income is 122 million euros (Rp. 2.14 trillion). This figure is still far from the 136 million euros (Rp. 2.4 trillion) generated in 2018 or Ronaldo's final season at Real. Apart from being lower, if inflation is calculated, Real matchday income is still very minimal.\nWith Mbappe's significant economic value, Real has the opportunity to become the first team to generate a revenue of 1 billion euros in one year. In 2023, Real was the world's highest-earning team, accumulating 831 million euros (Rp 14.6 trillion).\n\"Kylian (Mbappe), thank you for your hard work in wearing this uniform. You have achieved things that were previously unimaginable. Scoring many goals and winning everything in France, and then your foundation contributed to hundreds of children. We are proud to welcome you,\" said Perez in his welcome speech to Mbappe.\nMbappe is not just a player expected to help Real maintain its glory in Spain and Europe. More than that, Mbappe is Real Madrid's effort to establish itself as the most prosperous football club in history.\nWriter:\nMUHAMMAD IKHSAN MAHAR |\nEditor:\nPRASETYO EKO PRIHANANTO",
