Since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital's summer takeover the Blues spending has exceeded £400million, and landmark additions have been made in January at the expense of rivals, including Mykhailo Mudryk.\nWith the club languishing in 10th place in the Premier League and 10 points outside of qualifying for the Champions League, the recruitment team have acted and the likes of Benoit Badiashile, Joao Felix and Mudryk have all entered first team contention upon their arrivals. The west London side have moved quickly in a bid to aid Graham Potter's cause, whilst also taking advantage of stricter FFP rules coming into force - clubs will soon be restricted to 70% of their revenue being utilised in transfer dealings.\nIt will be a difficult route to reach Europe's elite competition next term, though the Blues are also fighting for European glory which could allow an alternative path. Not qualifying for the competition will bring greater stress onto future business, meaning the Blues will not be able to spend so easily.\nREAD MORE: Negotiations underway to decide Chelsea ace's future as Hull City hope to complete transfer\nHowever, the current size of Chelsea's squad is already set to cause issues, with only three new additions allowed to be registered for Champions League football for the knockout stages. A number of players have already been linked with moves away including Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic, while N'Golo Kante and Jorginho are currently set to see their contracts expire and a glut of players including Mason Mount and Mateo Kovacic will only have one year remaining on their deals come the summer.\nNot qualifying for the Champions League will make Chelsea's task in the transfer market more difficult financially but also when selling the club to potential players. The prospect of playing in the prestigious competition is sure to come into Declan Rice's reasoning if he is to leave West Ham in the summer for example.\nHowever, the issue that current Chelsea players may also be unwilling to miss out on the competition also arrives. Reports in Germany have already suggested that Kai Havertz could depart for £53million.\nThere's been little to indicate a move is already in the offing, and Havertz has proved himself vital to Potter's plans so far as he has led the line ahead of the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. It has not been a vintage season for the German international but he nevertheless remains Chelsea's top goalscorer.\nHowever, if he is to depart, Chelsea may have already prepared the perfect replacement. As early as October, the Blues made a pre-contract agreement with Christopher Nkunku, while more recently an agreement for the transfer is said to have been finalised, some noting a £52million release clause.\nThe forward, who is currently on his way back from an injury suffered before the World Cup, netted 12 times across 14 starts for RB Leipzig coming off a 2021/22 season where he recorded 31 goals and registered 20 assists in 48 appearances for the German club in all competitions. While the Bundesliga offers a different proposition to the Premier League, Nkunku's ability to generate chances is impossible not to note.\nPer FBref, Nkunku produces 4.21 shot-creating actions every 90 minutes, more than double that of Havertz. Though it must be acknowledged that Havertz outshines the 24-year-old in defensive actions, with Chelsea's forward proving valuable in pressing and within his own box.\nWhile signing Nkunku would have been done without the thought of Havertz departing, working ahead and coming to agreements early has given Chelsea a strong position to work from if the German forward deems his future elsewhere.\nREAD NEXT :\nBrighton boss details Moises Caicedo conversation amid Arsenal transfer bid and Chelsea interest\nGraham Potter's £45m transfer verdict hands Mykhailo Mudryk and Noni Madueke Chelsea warning\nChelsea receive major N'Golo Kante injury boost ahead of hopeful Borussia Dortmund return\nTodd Boehly vision clear amid January window as Chelsea aim to avoid Roman Abramovich blindspot\nFind the footballs on the football.london website to win cash prize, vouchers and TV worth £3,000",
