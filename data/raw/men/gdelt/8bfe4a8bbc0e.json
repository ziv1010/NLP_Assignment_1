The 35-year-old emphasised the importance of Bellingham's contributions to his team's success, both on and off the pitch, and what that could mean for him individually.\n\"The last few weeks he has looked a bit tired, but if he wins La Liga, the Champions League and the European Championship he could be a candidate for the Ballon d'Or,\" Ozil said. \"He's still very young, it's unbelievable.\n\"His first half of the season was incredible and left everyone speechless.\"\nAnother player Ozil was eager to praise was Arda Guler - Madrid and Turkey's young attacking midfielder.\nAt the start of 2022/23 season, following the departure of Ozil, Guler was given the number 10 at Fenerbahce, and the youngster continued to mirror Ozil's career by taking his talents to Spain last year.\n\"I know him very well. He was like my little brother when we both played for Fenerbahce,\" said Ozil.\n\"Everyone knows his talent, that's why I don't want to praise him too much and put more pressure on him. His situation is not very easy to manage, especially when all the hope of a country as fascinating for football as Turkey is placed on him.\"",
