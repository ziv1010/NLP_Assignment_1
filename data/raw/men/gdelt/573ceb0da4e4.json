But that is what we did.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘We had enough chances to score more than one goal, but on the other hand again conceding two and one of the two was the set piece.’\nThe Reds brought their losing run to an end in emphatic fashion on Wednesday night with a 5-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League and Slot responded to claims that he had been somewhat salty in defeat to Manchester United.\n‘We faced a team that had their game plan very well in order,’ Slot told TNT Sports. ‘There was a bit of a debate over what I said after the game, but it was meant to be a compliment… so, they had a low block and played a lot of long balls. I was asked why it was difficult, and that was the reason.\n‘It wasn’t criticism, it was me trying to explain why the game was made difficult. If you win the ball back after they’ve played it long, there are 11 players behind the ball. I would add that, to a certain extent, I was positive that we created as many chances as we did.\n‘Against [Crystal] Palace, we were able to create a lot against a low block, the same against United, but not many games since I’ve been in charge have we been able to create many chances against a 5-4-1 low block. It wasn’t meant as a criticism at all.\n‘It was a very smart game plan and certainly their last three signings – two of them for sure – had an impact on the game, in [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo.’\nSlot will be hoping the big win in Germany has stopped the rot and will be looking to build on the momentum at Brentford on Saturday evening in the Premier League.\nThe Reds boss admits that even before the four-game losing run things were not perfect, accepting that criticism is valid.\n‘[The scrutiny] is totally normal, losing four times in a row after we have won the league. We started the season well in terms of results, not always in terms of performances,’ he said.\n‘The funny thing is, you can maybe argue that the wins we had we didn’t play as well as we did in the second halves against Palace and Chelsea, nor for the entire game against United – but it’s a results-driven world we live in, and I accept that.\nMore Trending\n‘When we were winning in the first set of games, I wasn’t that positive, and I wasn’t telling everyone how great we were. Even in the second half of last season, I’ve said many times that the margins were small and we were sometimes on the lucky side. We needed set pieces at that part of the season to bring wins over the line.\nLiverpool's next five fixtures\nSat Oct 25: Brentford (a) – Premier League\nWed Oct 29: Crystal Palace (h) – Carabao Cup\nSat Nov 01: Aston Villa (h) – Premier League\nTue Nov 04: Real Madrid (h) – Champions League\nSun Nov 09: Man City (a) – Premier League\n‘That told me something, and as a result of that, we thought we had to improve [the squad] in the window and make changes. But when you change, it’s quite common that you have to adapt to a new situation, and things can go a little bit like this [his hand moving up and down].\n‘It’s not only going upwards; things can go down a bit as well. A very wise man told me this week that the important thing is that we grow together, and that’s what we need to do.\n‘It’s not easy when you lose four games, but that’s why I have to tell the players what we did wrong and why we lost. In the three or four moments where we had to defend, we were not at it enough, and we missed too many chances.’\nMORE: £27m Arsenal star hailed as ‘one of the best in the world’ after Atletico Madrid win\nMORE: Barcelona star Marcus Rashford sends message to Real Madrid ahead of El Clasico\nMORE: Ajax boss makes Chelsea claim after Champions League defeat",
