Indeed, with the club likely to miss out on a top-four finish, strengthening the area will be priority No 1 this summer.\nTo that end, Klopp is being linked with a series of big-name stars following news they are to shelve interest in Jude Bellingham.\nAnd it seems he will not be short of options with multiple stars – most recently the £88m Bruno Guimaraes – seemingly on his wishlist.\nHowever, Klopp is all too aware that buying within the Premier League will come with a premium price.\nAnd now reports in France claim they are hot on the trail of Monaco midfielder Fofana.\nThe all-action midfielder has become a regular for club and country in recent times, underlining his abilities at the World Cup.

As a result, the player is reportedly open to returning to the Premier League if the right offer came along.\nPer the report, Arsenal, Newcastle and Liverpool are among those keen on the former Chelsea man.\nAnd with finances tight at Milan, they are reportedly open to offers for Tomori in the region of €50m.\nThe prospective double deal for Tomori and Fofana would set Liverpool backed a combined £88m (€100m).\nARSENAL TO START SUMMER SPENDING WITH LINDSTROM SIGNING\nArsenal will open their summer spending by signing Danish midfielder Jesper Lindstrom in a £26.4m (€30m) deal from Eintracht Frankfurt.
