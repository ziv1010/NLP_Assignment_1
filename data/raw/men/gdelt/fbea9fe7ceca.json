  "body_text": "Manchester United 2 - 0 Everton\nEverton travel to Old Trafford on Saturday to take on Manchester United in the lunchtime kick-off, with Elllis Simms in the starting line-up.\nAbdoulaye Doucouré starts his 3-match suspension for slapping Harry Kane.\nA lovely bright sunshiny Spring day at the so-called Theatre of Dreams, with Sean Dyche and his charges looking to disturb the slumbers of the locals.\nThe home side kicked the game off, Everton all in Royal Blue. An early chance for Ellis Simms was blocked away from him as he swung a boot at Iwobi's cross. At the other end, Sabitzer was quick to turn and shoot, deflected behind for an early corner. Rashford's attempted shot well blocked.\nTarkowski gave away another early corner, played short until McTominay skied his effort. An excellent Everton move resulted, with Godfrey winning Everton's first corner in by Iwobi, intercepted by Rashford as Man Utd broke at pace, Fernandes drifting in a ball for Pickford to claim.\nBut Rashofor looked to have beaten Keane only to fire straight at Pickford. Then a tremendous cross that Pickford punched onto Rashford and behind.\nColeman drew a free kick off Sancho that was superbly delivered by Gray but headed behind. End to end as Rashford got a great pass from Fernades but Iwobi was across brilliantly to stop his shot. From the corner, Anthony hit the post and Wan Bissaka, with an open goal, shot outside the far post.\nMore determined Man Utd pressure won another corner, worked short until Malacia belted it high and wide. Godrfey tried to release McNeil but he couldn't keep the ball in play. Sancho then collapsed at the merest touch of Coleman behind him. Mcneil then played his pass for Simms too hard and straight out.\nMalacia went in on Gray for another free-kick opportunity but it was defended away. Gray played a clever ball crossfield to McNeil and looked like his cross t Sims was well smackable but Wan-Bissaka blocked it. Coleman then set up Simms for a fabulous chance but he took his eye off the ball and scuffed his shot horribly across the face of goal with only De Gea to beat!\nA fast Man Utd break saw Sanco floor two Blues before Sabitzer shoot at PickfordAnthony got free behind the Everton line and went for goal but Pickford stopped it superbly. Iwobi and Gray tried to counter, Maguire rugby tacking Gray to the grround but not even reviewed by the VAR, given as a corner! Gray delivered this one a fraction too far.\nFrom the clearance, Godfrey was beaten again, Antony getting in for another shot only for a superb recovery tackle from Godfrey. But Man Utd got forward again, Focring another superb save from Pickford.\nAnother brilliant Man Utd ball over the top found Rashford but Pickford was out brilliantly to totally block any shot chance for the England forward. The xG should be around 6-3 at this point but still goalless!\nAnother fluid Man Utd move got into the Everton goal area, put behind by Keane. From the second phase, Gray blocked another goal-bound shot. Another slick Man Utd move saw Fernandes fire over.\nMore forward play from Man Utd got to be too intricate and was defended until Sabitzer got on the end oaf another good move but the fired the difficult shot over.\nFinally, though, determined work from Rashford could not be halted and he set up McTominay who made it look far too easy to beat Pickford at the near post.\nEverton had done so well to keep them out to this point but there was a relentless inevitability about the succession chances Man Utd had created. The Blues needed to settle but it was the Red Devils who kept surging forward, Rashord again well in n Pickford, who saved his shot well despite him being flagged offside.\nAt the other end, Gray worked up a shot that was blocked away. and Man Utd again looked to break with the Blues defence reforming, Wan-Bissaka's shot deflected behind for a corner that Onana cleared.\nEverton got a chance to get forward but could not fashion a chance as the first half. Simms did well iin midfied but was far too slow getting forward and the cross was wasted. But Anothony yet again got around Godfrey and lashed another shot that Pickford had to save before a corner ended the half.\nGodfrey paid the price for his lackadaisical defending, Mykolenko on in his stead. But it was Man Utd pressure again from the restart. Everton did not make good use of the forward balls they had early on in the half as the pace of the game dropped.\nGray was fouled wide left but Tarkowski's looping header was no threat. With little on note happening, Sean Dyche decided for an early switch (for him): Davies and Garner on for Onana Gana.\nEverton tried some ponderous ball play from midfield but it was slow and went nowhere. McTominay kicked Cloeman while he was on the ground, red card offence? But of course, nothing from the VAR.\nGary put in the free-kick, Coleman swung in a decent cross to Simss in the crowd. Then the ball dropped but Simms shot well off target, however, it was blocked back and Iwobi's better shot was deflected behind.\nThe corner was well-competed, with Garner's shot blocked for a corner and it was worked around until lost. Man Utd surged forward, Fernandes heading and Pickford pushing it over the bar.\nEverton, in comparison, were just far too slow and laborious to get forward, with less than a quarter of the match now left, as Maupay replaced Simms. Rashford got forward, but Davies got in late to upset his shot.\nBut Coleman made a horrendous error, letting a straight-forward ball slip under his foot with Rashfrod behind him and in like a flash, Martial finishing with ease.\nTom Davies did well to win the ball back in midfield and Gray should have done a helluva lot better with his poor effort that failed to trouble De Gea.\nMan Utd looked to lock things down but, when Everton did win an easy ball, Iwobi lost it again immediately. When they did get some more ball, it ended with Coleman firing at De Gea.\nDavies went in clumsily over the ball on Fred and from the free-kick Fernandes got behind Mykolenko and could have headed a third. Fernandes was gifted another shot for Pickford to save. But the goals Everton needed looked further away than ever as the last minutes played out.\nPatterson returned for his first game in 3 months since that knee injury, replacing Coleman who took a knock.\nManchester United: De Gea, Wan-Bissaka, Maguire, Martinez, Malacia, McTominay, Sabitzer (76' Fred), Fernandes, Antony (60' Martial), Sancho (76' Eriksen), Rashford (81' Weghorst).\nSubs: Butland, Dalot, Lindelof, Varane, Pellistri.\nEverton: Pickford, Coleman (87' Patterson), Keane, Tarkowski, Godfrey (46' Mykolenko), Gana (60' Garner), Onana (60' Davies), Iwobi, McNeil, Gray, Simms (70' Maupay).\nSubs: Begovic, Holgate, Mina,, Coady.\nReader Comments (269)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Confidence will be up after that strike against Chelsea, but a tough game all the same. Maybe 2-2, and another valuable point.\n6 Posted 08/04/2023 at 11:42:08\nIt's an attacking move. I'm quite surprised.\n7 Posted 08/04/2023 at 11:49:11\n8 Posted 08/04/2023 at 11:54:10\n9 Posted 08/04/2023 at 11:55:32\nIt's a positive move bringing Simms in. He looked a bit leaner and fitter than I've ever seen him in the training vid so he will hopefully cause Man Utd's defence a few problems today.\nCOYBLUES!\n10 Posted 08/04/2023 at 12:01:17\nCOYBB\n11 Posted 08/04/2023 at 12:04:26\ncannot see Iwobi moving inside.\n12 Posted 08/04/2023 at 12:12:21\nThose in the stadium, those watching at home, those following at some ridiculous hour overseas.\nA unified blue wall. Here we go.\nSpeak to you on my way home.\nEnjoy the ride!\n13 Posted 08/04/2023 at 12:13:56\n14 Posted 08/04/2023 at 12:27:57\n15 Posted 08/04/2023 at 12:58:31\n16 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:09:13\n17 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:10:22\n18 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:12:31\n19 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:19:29\nI reckon he may get dragged.\n20 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:21:44\n21 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:23:10\n22 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:26:34\n23 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:27:11\nBut Simms could/should have scored, and I fail to see how Maguire not making any attempt to get the ball and merely barging Grey to the ground is not a penalty? it's a foul anywhere else on the pitch, it's a clear penalty.\nGodfrey has been woeful. Not sure how we go about this. Really think we need another midfielder on the pitch, but can't be hooking Simms as he is a goal threat.\n24 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:28:26\n25 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:28:39\nDyche had better come up with something because the ball over the top is killing us. Godfrey is 10 yards off his man all the time, once again it is the long diagonals, drop it over the full back, it's painful.\nHanging by a thread.\n26 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:31:07\nAgain for the goal we have defenders just dropping back all the time otherwise the scorer should have been played offside.\nAnd when we get forward and wide there seems to be no thought of at least putting a cross over, just fiddle before giving the ball away. I thought we could have had a penalty about 20 or 25th minute when Gray was held back but forgot we are up against one of the never happened sides.\nThe one sad point is that Simms could have given us the lead but now seems to have developed the Finch Farm speciality of being frightened to put his boot through the ball.\nCan't see us getting anything out of this other than keeping our goal difference almost respectable.\n27 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:39:25\nSorry guys and lasses.\n28 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:43:02\n29 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:49:16\n30 Posted 08/04/2023 at 13:58:24\nGana our best player?\nRemember Jordon Pickford?\n31 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:14:01\nSo many mistakes, he is almost always scared to put a foot in. Not the only one making mistakes agreed but fuck off, Iwobi!!!\n32 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:17:51\n33 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:18:21\nIwobi is fucking useless. How the fuck can the manager keep picking him. Can' t pass, shoot or tackle. How much? Arsenal were pissing themselves when they got rid.\n34 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:18:41\nCrack on next week.\nThis squad ain't quitting on the back of a bad day...\n35 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:23:15\npassing was way below standard, Utd played well, but every time we had the ball we gifted it back to them, got to be better than this.\n36 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:25:46\n37 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:26:25\nIn truth we could have taken a morale sapping hiding today.\nOh well, the big games for us are still coming.\n38 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:31:26\n39 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:34:12\nIt was a step too far replacing the mainly midfielder Doucoure with the mainly attacker Gray. I thought we were on the back foot throughout and possibly a better call would have been to have a more solid midfield and play Gray up top on his own. Maybe the same formation as has been decent recently, but simply with Garner for Doucoure.\nMan Utd have so many quality attacking players it probably wouldn't have made much difference, especially on their wide open pitch. Ten Haag's tactics of switching play and exposing our full-backs worked well.\nNeed to forget this now and move on, get a win next week.\n40 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:34:43\nWhy you would bother bringing on Maupay is beyond me and if you thought Simms did little then you would have had difficulty knowing Maupay was on other than his number was on the subs board. We seemed to miss DoucourÃ© getting forward as we got few if any players into their penalty area and nobody that gave them anything to worry about.\nAs for the second goal, again, Coleman made an error that let the Man Utd player in but had he been holding the line then he was offside. When will we wake up to it!\nI thought this was one of\nthe better refereeing displays of our season but similar to Kane last week why was McTominay not booked for twice kneeing a player?\nAll-in-all, we deserved everything we got from this game and the best I can say is that our goal difference could, perhaps should, be a lot worse. The almost bubble has burst.\n41 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:38:28\nBetter chances to win coming up.\n42 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:38:51\nFulham, Palace, Newcastle, Leicester, Brighton, Man City, Wolves, Bournemouth.\n9 points from Fulham, Palace and Leicester would be lovely.\nToday, I had very little confidence â€“ tough game on the road, coming off a great effort with one less day of rest.\nI have a lot of confidence we can beat Fulham at home. Hopefully that gets a ball rolling and we actually drag Palace down officially into the Relegation Battle Royale.\nIt's all getting a bit ass-pucker for me now.\n43 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:40:26\nSeamus played really well apart from that terrible mistake.\n44 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:40:50\nBut it highlights the gap between the two sides; how many of our players would get in the Man Utd squad and how many of theirs would get into ours.\nAnswer none and all of them.\n45 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:46:30\nWe're just a poor team relying on spirit when faced with decent teams. I'm not despondent â€“ I expected to lose today â€“ but we are where we are on merit, not by bad luck. It's a poor squad.\n46 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:52:37\nI'll say it again: we should have stabalised with Big Sam being here longer.\n47 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:53:07\nTen Hag has Man Utd playing as well as they have in the past decade since Ferguson retired. We couldn't cope with it. I don't think there's a huge inquest into what we could / should have done. Points were available through either luck or Man Utd having an off day. We got neither. As it is, we've lost without unduly harming our goal difference.\nSome of today's poor performers still have much to contribute to us staying up. We move on.\n48 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:58:18\n49 Posted 08/04/2023 at 14:58:22\nThe positives we can take from the game is the Goal Difference is going to count in staying up or going down, and we kept the score respectable, plus another strong display from Pickford.\n51 Posted 08/04/2023 at 15:00:49\nAlso not surprised that McTominay did not get even a yellow card.\n52 Posted 08/04/2023 at 15:01:49\nYou've got to be joking â€“ he was as bad as Onana and Godfrey. James Garner done more in 10 minutes than the other two.\nMotM has got to be Pickford.\n53 Posted 08/04/2023 at 15:05:13\nThis was a write-off from the get-go unless Man Utd didn't bother showing but of course the sneaky petunias did. On the plus side, we avoided a hammering meaning goal difference is still retrievable and confidence not unduly affected.\nOnly two more write-offs remain â€“ Man City and Newcastle Utd â€“ so the league we start in next season is very much in our hands (points deduction notwithstanding). Not good but not disastrous.\n54 Posted 08/04/2023 at 15:05:54\n55 Posted 08/04/2023 at 15:08:26\nWe will go down because we drop points to Fulham, Bournemouth and Newcastle. Win those three and we should be okay with maybe an away win or couple of away draws to be sure.\nWe are a poor squad which is why we are in trouble. Onana is not giving enough, Ben Godfrey is struggling and we need of course a fit Calvert-Lewin. We will only pick up points if everyone is playing well and we had too many today who weren't allowed to by a top side.\nLet's move on!!\n56 Posted 08/04/2023 at 15:17:54\n57 Posted 08/04/2023 at 15:19:00\nI wish you could blame Ramadan for Onana's very poor performance but he has been producing these displays all season to be honest; the lad simply hasn't shown anything to demonstrate why we paid such an extravagant price for this player, he offers next to nothing going forward or defending, but apart from Pickford the whole team played a lot worse than they have been recently.\nWe can play better than this and will do to get the points needed to stay up.\n58 Posted 08/04/2023 at 15:33:12\nSimms shot aside, too timid, and Jordan Pickford saved us from a very heavy defeat.\nWe go again v Fulham which is a must-win, and hopefully results go Everton's way today.\nDisappointing day to say the least but there's a big battle ahead which Everton can winto stay in the League.\n59 Posted 08/04/2023 at 15:41:13\nDefinitely missed DoucourÃ© in midfield, maybe Garner or Davies would have been a better option in midfield, as Iwobi and Gray offer no physicality with Onana offering little.\nWe badly need Calvert-Lewin available.\n60 Posted 08/04/2023 at 15:41:16\nI think we've missed two opportunities to win games under Dyche, the game at Forest and last Monday's draw with Spurs. We understand that we are down where we are for a reason, but that doesn't excuse non-performance in any game anywhere.\nIf we are to win away again this season, it's better to do it at the teams around us, like Wolves, Palace and Leicester, but the Fulham game on Saturday has become all important and we simply must win it.\nIt could go down to the final two games of the season, but we have to win a game or two to make that happen. It's tough being a blue at the best of times, but this next few weeks will truly test our resolve.\n61 Posted 08/04/2023 at 15:41:59\nI think we now have a good run of games to take points through to end of the season and that includes Man City at home who may have one eye on the semi-final of the Champions League.\n62 Posted 08/04/2023 at 15:43:21\nNow that's not as big a problem as it first appears footballers who can play have virtually vanished from the game most can't trap a bag of cement these days and wrestle with rather than control a ball. The unopposed inheritor of the Messi/Ronaldo crown, Mbappe, is an athlete first and foremost his sprinting prowess being what sets him aside\nSo, in the land of the blind where the one-eyed man is king, Onana is effectively a prince and therefore valuable as a saleable asset which, in all honesty, is all we are interested in this summer. Might be best to keep the truth of his performances on the down low whilst other clubs seem to be buying the hype â€“ we need the cash pronto.\n63 Posted 08/04/2023 at 15:58:05\nGarner in for DoucourÃ© and Onana given the DoucourÃ© role was the simple change to make.\nIf we had kept to the tried and trusted we might have won the midfield battle and kept things even or nicked a goal.\nMaybe Dyche underestimated Man Utd but Old Trafford is not the place to tinker with the proven formation. He better have it sorted for next week. And a strong midfield is essential.\n64 Posted 08/04/2023 at 16:17:06\nI was flummoxed when I saw Dyche had changed the system. We find one that works and then change it because of one missing cog?\nOn saying that, how many more games will Iwobi get based on that graphic of him running all over the pitch last season? He can't tackle, his decision-making is shocking, and he runs into blind alleys. I get that he's skilful but he's five-a-side skilful!\nBut it's not just individuals â€“ our squad is Bottom 6. I'm 100% for giving Sean Dyche the chance that, in hindsight, Allardyce should indeed have been given. There, I've said it!\nUTFT!\n65 Posted 08/04/2023 at 16:18:03\nThe midfield all season is where our problems have cost us, the lack of goals we have known about for a good few years but there's no creativity or nous in that midfield whatsoever.\nGarner for me, if he's fit, should finish the season now, at least he looks half calm and capable on the ball which is not something you can say of Gana, Iwobi or Onana.\nDesperate times and we can only hope that next Saturday our need is greater than Fulham's and we eradicate anymore self-destruct errors which have plagued the season for us.\n66 Posted 08/04/2023 at 16:21:42\nGueye was the bigger disappointment for me today because he's our most experienced outfield player and his use of the ball during the first half was very poor. He did improve after the break and was playing as well as anyone when he got hooked but I think the game was already away from us even at this stage.\nThe gulf in class was huge and this was amplified when you realize Iwobi is meant to be our biggest creative player according to the stats.\nA free-hit but you don't get nothing away from home without being horrible and hard to play against â€“especially when we have got such little creativity in the team. I agree the well coached Man Utd were at it today and, even though I thought we played right into their hands, they did show teams how to play against a very narrow defence and could have been four or five up by half-time.\nWe need Calvert-Lewin — I believe this team could even become a mid-table side if he was fit but without him it's going to be a real struggle until the end.\n67 Posted 08/04/2023 at 16:22:30\nAgreed. We need the extra man in midfield. Today was like watching a Lampard team. Wide open without the ball and too slow and predictable with the ball.\n68 Posted 08/04/2023 at 16:31:18\nI'd forget Calvert-Lewin now, mate, as bad as it sounds, I know he's had loads of stick for his life choice etc etc and I'm not going down that road.\nI mean, for 2 years now he's not featured hardly and I doubt if we are all honest with ourselves that next season will greatly differ because the problems just seem so ongoing that any physical exertion is killing his body and preventing any competitive nature.\nWe should have been ruthless last summer and looked at Calvert-Lewin as a squad player and signed two first-choice strikers and had Calvert-Lewin as a third choice, if he's fit then fine but don't expect anything.\nWe've brought it on ourselves sadly.\n69 Posted 08/04/2023 at 16:33:34\nThink about this: who in that dreadful squad would you have in any selection of players that you'd be happy with in our team for the start of next season? The same two for me and that is all. What has happened to what were some seemingly good buys?\nPickford is the best goalie in the world — we'd be in the Championship already without him.\n70 Posted 08/04/2023 at 16:34:18\nAnd once it became clear Onana was having another stinker, I was desperate to see Garner. I was also desperate for us to stop playing such a high line â€“ they created so many chances from long balls.\nWe didn't deserve anything, but we were still in it until the Coleman mistake. Not a match to get too down about â€“ there are more key games ahead.\n71 Posted 08/04/2023 at 16:39:35\nIwobi doing well, then give it straight back to them. As I've said, he is limited because of his 10 to 2 feet. That might sound daft but he constantly gives the ball away.\n72 Posted 08/04/2023 at 16:50:13\nI said when Dyche came in, we have a manager to get us out of the Championship. Staying up would be a title win. Going down will not be a shock. Still have a chance!!!\nLooks like Frank has put another nail in our coffin! Cheers, Frank, for everything!\n73 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:03:03\n74 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:06:33\nNo matter what we think of Calvert-Lewin, we simply have to risk him for the Fulham game and beyond. Once the season ends, all being well still in top-flight football, go all out to bring two top-class strikers in.\nCalvert-Lewin will be the messiah in a couple of weeks, and all the name-callers will be kissing his backside, watch this space.\n75 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:09:28\nSpurs should have had Perisic and Romero sent off, and 2 goals ruled out by the VAR, and Kane rolling around again twice, unbelievable.\n76 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:10:04\nOn the bright side, after that tough run of games, we are above the Bottom 3 and we got away with an absolute battering to our goal difference today.\nWe have to beat Fulham next week.\n77 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:10:37\nI agree. Cannon could even link up with Simms. The may have had an understanding. Something that Maupay lacks in abundance.\n78 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:11:10\nCheers, Villa.\n79 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:14:09\nGray\nMcNeil Garner Gueye Davies Iwobi\nMykolenko Tarkowski Keane Coleman\nPickford\nThis is a solid enough team until Doucoure and hopefully, Dominic are back.\nAnd as expected, Lampard loses at Wolves - one of the worst managers at Everton in the long list of poor managers.\n80 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:18:27\nSimms looks better coming off the bench for the last 15 - 20 minutes.\n81 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:21:13\nNottm Forest have a horrific run of games coming up, looks like it could be between us and Leicester who survives.\nFulham next week is a must-win.\n82 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:28:04\nWhilst the team overall were poor today, in part I think that was due to the manager's initial game plan which made us short in midfield.\nHowever, there were also a number of players who performed poorly, notably Godfrey, Onana, Iwobi, McNeil and Maupay. The rest I thought were okay, given their various limitations.\nWe will need to play a lot better than this if we are to stay in the Premier League.\nFor his part, I hope DoucourÃ© was fined for his silly sending off, and Calvert-Lewin is on the team sheet for the remainder of the season, and Garner starts next week.\n83 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:28:40\nI hate the fact that Calvert-Lewin might come back as a hero but, if he had played at all, we wouldn't be in the position of needing a hero.\nIf he is willing â€“ I am not convinced â€“ we need to risk him against Fulham. If we don't win that, it is over.\n84 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:32:08\nSpurs, Chelsea, Arsenal (x2), Villa, Liverpool, Brentford, Forest and Leeds, yup! that is a whole raft of relegation rivals isn't it?\n85 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:37:49\nI don't know if Dyche wanted to force them wide and hope we could deal with the crosses, but the tactics didn't work today. Simms was too isolated, no one really ran in front of him the way DoucourÃ© has been getting forward.\nGray needs to deliver the ball without all the stepovers, he's definitely better through the middle with the goal to run at instead of the byline.\nIt could have been embarrassing if not for Pickford. I think the Gana & Onana were took off to give them a rest as it didn't look like we were getting anything .\nThis game's gone, next 2 are huge now. No one seems to want to drag themselves out of this relegation battle but 6 points from the next 2 would go a long way for us.\n86 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:40:22\n87 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:45:55\nWin lose or draw against Fulham, I won't be giving up till that fat lady is singing... why would we give up when there's even a small chance? And the chance isn't even that small â€“ we are well capable of staying up!!\nWe'd have gone down last season with that attitude!! And in '98 and '94!!\nWe don't give up, lad!!!\n88 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:49:37\nIt's 3 out of the Bottom 4. The others will pull away. I don't want to come back and haunt us â€“ Wolves injury time winner and surrendering the lead twice at Forest.\nI don't want to dwell on Bournemouth results as they are a better team.\nGrimm, isn't it.\n89 Posted 08/04/2023 at 17:52:19\n90 Posted 08/04/2023 at 18:02:09\nHorrible journey up because of engineering works.\nLondon to Leicester. Leicester to Nuneaton. Then Nuneaton to Manchester.\nSame deal on the way back only delayed an hour at least due to an emergency ahead. I hope the person is okay.\nSat amongst the home supporters and with a few Man Utd friends in United pubs after the match.\nTough day.\nBut we go to Goodison on Saturday.\n91 Posted 08/04/2023 at 18:02:21\nRashford also looked like he put an intentional elbow into the face of McNeil. I only watched it as it happened because there wasn't a replay, but I'm sure Rashford meant it.\nMcNeil toughed it out, someone like, Harry Kane would have been down and writhing getting the VAR to have a look.\n92 Posted 08/04/2023 at 18:05:13\n93 Posted 08/04/2023 at 18:12:48\n94 Posted 08/04/2023 at 18:24:35\nI won't just forget about Calvert-Lewin because I think we badly need him mate. He's been injured a very long time, but not for as long as the club has been totally mismanaged into the ground.\nI believe if Dominic doesn't get fit, then this total mismanagement could possibly lead us into the Championship.\n95 Posted 08/04/2023 at 18:32:34\nstill right in it too.\n96 Posted 08/04/2023 at 18:54:37\n97 Posted 08/04/2023 at 19:04:18\n98 Posted 08/04/2023 at 19:09:11\nI don't think Dyche or the squad will feel demoralised by the result today. It's just one of those things.\nContrast that with how Leicester must be feeling right now...\n99 Posted 08/04/2023 at 19:12:12\nI fucking hate Spuds nearly as much as the shite. They're an absolutely diabolical club. Haven't won a league title since 1961 and the media go on and on about them like they're laden with trophies.\nLast major honour â€“ FA Cup in 91. Must be the only team in the Champions League who've never won the domestic competition. Embarrassing.\nBut what that snide Levy has done is keep them relevant by hook or by crook â€“ usually with the help of the PL and dire decisions â€“ unlike uncle Bill who's managed us the opposite way. Anyway, rant over.\nI didn't see the game today as was travelling. Sounds like we never turned up and they did as the Sky 6 always do with us. And that bag of shite Martial got his obligatory goal against us. Incredible.\nWe need points and we need the likes of Bournemouth to start running out of luck. Anyway, it's all by the by cos unless something drastic changes, we'll be here again next year.\nFuck off, Kenwright.\nUTFT\n100 Posted 08/04/2023 at 19:17:05\nBrian 74, agree about Cannon, he would be an option right now.\n101 Posted 08/04/2023 at 19:26:12\n102 Posted 08/04/2023 at 19:32:15\nWhilst we are certainly an improved outfit since Dyche took over, our form isn't exactly pulling up trees. We will need to significantly improve and get at least 3 wins, possibly 4 to stay up. Are they possible or likely from 8 games?\n103 Posted 08/04/2023 at 19:55:11\nIan 96, Rob 98 exactly!! We all knew there would be setbacks. How we deal with the setbacks is vital now. The two coming games will tell us a lot.\nJohn 92, yeah we've lost. It's hard another weekend looking at other teams, coming fixtures others fixtures. But I belive we wouldn't have had a chance if we'd kept Frank so we have more than a chance now.\nPeople saying Cannon shouldn't be on loan we need him, no it's Calvert-Lewin we need. We have Simms and he's shown the step up is not an easy one to make.\nThe yards the team have run lately, we were bound to have a setback when the sqaud is so thin!\nKeep believing, lads!! What's the alternative??\n104 Posted 08/04/2023 at 19:55:39\nOkay, it's changed now, no more of Kenwright's jobs for the boys.\nI know I'm digressing but I'm angry that we haven't got a better squad because of 8 wasted years because of Kenwright.\n105 Posted 08/04/2023 at 20:01:37\nWe have just sold an academy graduate for 㿙M, so not all bad, mate.\nSimms, Mills, Cannon and few others on the fringe of things too.\n106 Posted 08/04/2023 at 20:10:23\n107 Posted 08/04/2023 at 20:29:29\n108 Posted 08/04/2023 at 20:30:26\nDidn't see that one, but normal form for Oliver to turn a blind eye.\n109 Posted 08/04/2023 at 20:34:47\nI think Dyche will change it back to his more orthodox 4-5-1 that grinds out wins and is a much meaner team. But even then we will need to pass it better, we were sloppy today and there's no excuse for that.\nAlso we can't afford any more giveaway mistakes as we don't score freely to compensate.\nEight points from those four games will go a long way to securing safety. If we stick to our system that works, we can do it.\n110 Posted 08/04/2023 at 20:37:04\n111 Posted 08/04/2023 at 20:53:22\nTony A, I kind of thought, or rather hoped we may have got a penalty from Carthorse Maguire's antics inside the box, but the chances of that were slimmer than a Rizzla Paper. Almost makes Fulham a must-win game now, just to keep pace with others at the bottom.\n112 Posted 08/04/2023 at 21:02:34\nThe paucity of quality in the squad must be concerning Dyche. The bench is hardly inspiring. Let's hope we can get 3 points versus Fulham. It's a must now.\n113 Posted 08/04/2023 at 21:09:02\nBut we need a win. Fulham will be no pushovers for certain and we will miss DoucourÃ© as we did today. But I have a feeling we might see Calvert-Lewin back soon. Whether he'll be fit enough to make a positive impact, I've no ideaâ€¦ but hopefully so.\nDyche has improved us but we've had a really tough run of games. Fulham, Palace and Leicester are the next 3. I'd say we need an absolute minimum of 4 points from those but ideally 6 or 7 (though I wouldn't say no to 9!). It's gonna be a nail-biter.\n114 Posted 08/04/2023 at 21:12:59\n115 Posted 08/04/2023 at 21:31:23\n116 Posted 08/04/2023 at 21:34:23\n117 Posted 08/04/2023 at 21:53:25\n118 Posted 08/04/2023 at 22:02:43\nTo get a result today, we would have had to be playing a Man Utd team with little to play for, which was the complete opposite, they are chasing a Champions League place so they were always going to put in a massive shift today in their own stadium.\nThe relegation battle is obviously still finely balanced. I think that Wolves and West Ham will be involved despite their victories today. There is still a way to go and it could go right to the last matches of the season for us unfortunately.\nWe just have to grin and bear it until it's over and hope we survive. Surely then some drastic changes will be made at boardroom level, otherwise we will be back here again next season, god forbid.\n119 Posted 08/04/2023 at 22:15:39\n120 Posted 08/04/2023 at 22:29:42\nThey all have them.\nHe'll come good.\n121 Posted 08/04/2023 at 22:31:18\nGarner's Distinctly Average' is, at the moment, better than that big galoot Onana.\nTalking of big galoots, Godfrey had another less than 'Distincly Average' day... not for the first time either.\nSimms didn't have much to work with and looks what he might turn out to be, a bit... in the style of a Lukaku-lite... one dimensional — Okay when it comes off, like Chelsea.\nI think Dyche pushed the back line up a bit too far to compress the midfield a bit — compensating for the missing DoucourÃ©?\nIf it all goes down to Goal Difference, then thank Pickford — MotM.\n122 Posted 08/04/2023 at 22:44:28\nHe's been here 3 or 4 seasons now and nobody knows his best position. I think we bought him as a right-side centre-back but he's probably only played there 5 times.\nI think he's going to be one of those utility players who is not considered to be great anywhere, but he'll have a career in and around the Premier League and Championship as per his last few years but will never be considered as a really good player.\nOnana has been really disappointing., I believe Dyche is getting a bit fed up with him now and we will see him benched when DoucourÃ© is back.\n123 Posted 08/04/2023 at 23:38:07\nSo you think it's a success over 8 years?\nSimms — Cannot control a ball.\nGordon — hit and run merchant. No close control whatsoever.\nTypical Unsworth players. As the saying goes, in the Godfather, \"It's not personal, just strictly business.\"\nWhat I'm saying is, under Bill Kenwright, it was who was up Kenwright's arse. I really believe that.\n124 Posted 09/04/2023 at 00:28:59\nIn the same week that Tiger Woods hits the flag on the green, three Everton players fail to hit the target in two games, they are DoucourÃ©, Gana and Simms.\nAs for Calvert-Lewin, he will suddenly be fit for at least the last three games; otherwise, Arsenal or Man Utd will not make a bid for him. His fitness battles remind me of the Man Utd player we bought; Sir Alex Ferguson was convinced his 'injuries' were in his mind.\nSimms needs to realise he needs to be proactive; otherwise, he is showing the same meaningless movement as Rondon. With that kind of performance, he will undoubtedly follow Rondon out of the club. I hope, regardless of our situation, that Dyce remains in charge next season; he will be very careful with his spending and will get rid of players if he feels they are not trying.\nWhat does Dyche say? \"The minimum requirement is maximum effort.\" Clearly Simms did not do that today.\nSimms has 8 games to impress before Calvert-Lewin, Cannon and Dobbin return.\nTo quote another great manager: \"Defence starts with the striker\".\n125 Posted 08/04/2023 at 02:06:14\nDefinitely this Everton squad can't stay up but they must not forget their club identity and what it means. Today was as good as a no-show. Next week, show no mercy and beat Fulham. Beating Fulham is what counts.\nUTFTs!\n126 Posted 09/04/2023 at 02:12:15\nMy humble apologies.\n127 Posted 09/04/2023 at 02:52:09\nLeft back is in my opinion a specialist position requiring a left-footed player. All the best Everton left-backs have been left-footed. That is why Mykolenko should start there every time.\nI am a Ben Godfrey fan, he has some qualities that I really like but playing him at left-back is setting him up for failure. Personally, I think he could be turned into a box-to-box midfielder.\nI thought Dave Abrahams was a bit premature in his assessment of Onana but it looks like you were right, Dave. He is looking more and more like a show pony to me. At this stage, I would swap him out for Davies without hesitation. If we can sell him for a profit in the summer, I would (and buy Richarlison back off Spurs).\nI noticed that Dyche finally decided it would be a good idea to switch Gray to the right and McNeil to the left. They both can cut in and shoot with their preferred foot. For that reason, I think Dyche will have to persist with Simms in the centre.\nLast but not least â€“ drop Iwobi and replace him with Garner.\nPickford,\nColeman, Keane, Tarkowski, Mykolenko\nMcNeill, Gana, Garner, Davies, Gray\nSimms\nps: McTominay knees Coleman twice while he was on the deck and Rashford elbows McNeil in the mouth â€“ not even a yellow card in sight! Say no moreâ€¦\n128 Posted 09/04/2023 at 04:44:59\nGive me strength, Lawd.\nAlso, Cannon wouldn't be an option if he had stayed with us. Lampard wouldn't have used him. Dyche wouldn't have used him. He has slowly developed over 1200 tough minutes at Preston -- remember, he didn't score in his first seven games there, even briefly lost his starting job. He survived that long dry spell and grew into the game.\nNever would have had that chance with us.\n129 Posted 09/04/2023 at 05:17:58\nHe looks the part, like Grealish, socks half down etc, but that's about as far as it goesâ€¦ He's been a wage thief, and gravy train stowaway since that goal against Man City 6 years ago. Yes, that long. Another who has had a few (equivalent) Lottery Wins without even buying a Ticket.\nStrewth, Bruce! He's not called Dogshit Davies or Harpo Marx (brother of Skid) or Bette Davies for nothing. :-)\n130 Posted 09/04/2023 at 06:02:46\nBut seriously, I don't get the abuse that he gets from some posters here. I get it that some players trigger a very negative reaction among some fans for irrational reasons (for me, it is Mina and to an extent, Godfrey and Onana) but I cannot get why Tom sparks such rage.\nIn my eyes, he has performed quite decently whenever called upon. I believe he is capable of more, but he has never been played consistently by any manager â€“ mainly because (again my opinion) there have been more sexy name options â€“ Schneiderlin, Gomes, Delph, Gbamin, Allan, DoucourÃ©, Onana, etc â€“ most of whom have let down the club more spectacularly than Tom Davies.\n131 Posted 09/04/2023 at 06:54:00\nI haven't seen that Everton have offered him a new contract as his current one, I think, expires at this season's end but it won't be him that breaks the bank but somebody will blame him for our position this season.\n132 Posted 09/04/2023 at 07:38:38\n133 Posted 09/04/2023 at 08:09:52\nHe 's not even Welsh, hence not scoring for them ! Despite his surname sounding eligible, although he would be better suited to work on a sheep farm than than kick a sheep's inflated bladder on a football pitch. :-)\n134 Posted 09/04/2023 at 08:20:46\n135 Posted 09/04/2023 at 08:23:28\nSo if he wants a career at Everton after this season the answer is simple, pull your socks up, stop the silly fouls and concentrate on winning the ball and passing it to someone in a blue shirt. It's got to be largely in his own hands, but the Manager can play his part too. We desperately the Tom Davies who showed great promise to rediscover those skills by next week if not he doesn't deserve to be on the team sheet.\n136 Posted 09/04/2023 at 08:35:04\n137 Posted 09/04/2023 at 08:57:57\nAll the good work done recently feels like it has gone.\nNevermind a win next week and we will be feeling a whole lot better. Up the blues.\n138 Posted 09/04/2023 at 08:59:56\nThe lad has always tried his best but if this isn't good enough then just say it.\nThe people posting these comments are just idiots. Why can't you just stick with saying players are below standard, not good enough, shouldn't be in the team etc?\nPathetic support. Do you understand that word support as in supporter? Go and look it up in a dictionary.\n139 Posted 09/04/2023 at 09:03:33\nLet's be honest the central midfield players are not full of brilliant or even competent performers and I think most of thought Doucoure would be a big miss, his energy and Gueye's are vital to this team and Gueye was fighting a losing battle on his own yesterday, the invisible man really was invisible yesterday, but they all had a bad day along with Dyche, hopefully we will be a team again versus Fulham.\n140 Posted 09/04/2023 at 09:10:26\n141 Posted 09/04/2023 at 09:31:17\nMina for keano\nHolgate for Godfrey/ mykelenco\nKean for Simms\nPatterson for an injured Coleman\n142 Posted 09/04/2023 at 09:33:36\nDoucoure may be out, but Onana and Godfrey need to improve or be dropped for the next game.\n143 Posted 09/04/2023 at 09:39:42\n144 Posted 09/04/2023 at 09:40:40\n145 Posted 09/04/2023 at 09:44:46\nFulham on a poor run of form and looking toothless following Mitrovic's ban coming to Goodison next week...storyline almost writes itself.\nAll of the other relegation candidates have very difficult matches next week so a real opportunity for Everton.\n146 Posted 09/04/2023 at 09:46:20\n147 Posted 09/04/2023 at 09:47:36\n148 Posted 09/04/2023 at 09:59:09\n149 Posted 09/04/2023 at 10:06:29\nWe have just had back to back games with 2 top 4 teams, so these weren't easy games to get anything from.\nThe plus is we aren't in the bottom 3 and have a possible winnable home game next. I think our survival might go down to our last game of the season. Its going to be very tense the remaining games, but with our fantastic support lets hope we can survive.\n150 Posted 09/04/2023 at 10:11:51\n151 Posted 09/04/2023 at 10:33:46\nWhat's that got to do with Tom Davies? A kid who has been pushed from pillar to post and back again, and hasn't been allowed to develop because he's been playing for the most dysfunctional club in the country for years.\nDavies might not be good enough for where we want to be, but I believe once he finds stability, he will prove to be a very good player for some team, because he's not scared of hard work. He lacks a yard of pace, he doesn't lack much else, except he's playing for a fan base that have also been kicked from pillar to post, watching this kid struggling for the same reason. Just my opinion, I might be wrong.\n152 Posted 09/04/2023 at 10:38:09\nNow some may say you cant blackmail a player like that, but I would remind everyone that the club is paying Dom in excess of £100,000 per week. The club need him to play even if it gives him a few niggles.\n153 Posted 09/04/2023 at 10:51:05\nOther results were a mixed bag but we're still 17th amazingly.\nThe first half was ridiculous, and Godfrey was well out of his depth. We played way too high a line and it could easily have been about 5-0 at half time had it not been for Pickford.\nLosing away to Utd won't relegate us, and all the teams around us have to play each other which could be good for us too. There'll be upcoming weeks where we win and the other relegation candidates lose so I'm not too fussed about yesterday.\nUtd are better than us. A lot better than us, in fact so it was no disgrace to lose 2-0 and our players were still full of running towards the end.\nOnana flatters to deceive and basically switches off defensively when the oppo has the ball. He's headless and has very little defensive nouse. I'm actually starting to wonder what he does for the team other than a bit of cheerleading, lots of lying on the floor waving his arms about like he's taken sniper-fire, and occasionally making a last ditch tackle.\nWhat does he offer with the ball? The system Dyche plays seems to suit Doucoure and his idiocy could go so far as to cost us our place in the league if our midfield performance yesterday was anything to go by. Lets hope it was a one-off and the next 2 games without him don't go the same way.\n154 Posted 09/04/2023 at 10:51:25\nI was very surprised how we set up, a bit like Lampard's set up away to Spurs last season, playing such a high line was folly and that's not something I associate with our manager.\nI am sure Sean will have learnt from the experience, Michael Keane cannot survive in a team that plays a high line. Ben Godfrey was similarly exposed and we have to accept at this stage that as a defender he is very limited. His judgement is truly suspect.\nThe Fulham game is an ideal opportunity to put three points on the board and move a little closer to safety.\nI have to hold my hand up re Bournemouth, as of now they are the team at the foot of the table that shows most attacking intent and penatration.\nOne positive from yesterday, Pickford was fantastic!\n155 Posted 09/04/2023 at 10:54:56\nOne final, final thing, The Duke was a loss yesterday!\n156 Posted 09/04/2023 at 10:56:37\nEveryone has their own opinions, and mine has always been that DCL, has always worked very hard for his team, so trying to get back up to speed after a very serious injury, and constantly trying to play with the little niggles that anyone would suffer from, after so long out of the game, might have been taking its toll on him? (THIS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM IF WE HAD MORE FORWARDS, LIKE A TOP CLUB SHOULD)\nAll guesswork, but when Dyche said that they were trying to get Dominic close to the physical stats he was producing before he got injured, then hopefully he's getting very close to these now, especially when you consider that our manager said he wasn't far away, when he arrived at the club.\nMy hope is that Dyche's approach has earned him the total respect of Dominic, and he will now go and repay his manager in the best way possible!!\n157 Posted 09/04/2023 at 11:04:25\n158 Posted 09/04/2023 at 11:18:02\nI don't think some understand the level of physical fitness premier league footballers have to attain and maintain.\nIt's not like Sunday league where we all played with knocks etc.\nIn particular the players that rely on speed and twisting and turning need to be fully fit.\nThey're like Formula 1 cars, if they're a couple of percent off they're useless.\nNow maybe with some \"niggles\" some players can still perform to an acceptable level but depending on the type of injury/s that might just NOT be possible.\nI've seen on here for years that some just need to blame somebody and need to take out their frustrations and disappointment on somebody, a lot of the time very unfairly.\nTony, you know more than most on here that if you're a player you WANT to play, you're desperate to play, unless there's something actually preventing you from doing so.\nThe fact that nobody on here knows the full story of why DCL can't play leads to all sorts of weird and wonderful theories, a lot of them downright nasty.\nThat side of ToffeeWeb is one that's led to a good few either leaving the site for good or taking a leave/s of absence.\nI refuse to pile on to DCL simply because I don't know the facts. I'm not going to take out our predicament on a single player because it makes me feel better, and also because if/when the facts come out I may well look like a right c**t for some of the shite I may have come out with.........and some have come out with some shite that's for sure.\n159 Posted 09/04/2023 at 11:37:31\nWith regards the mental side I would say that the long road of recovery has been a difficult one to take. All that work to get healthy then back to square one again on numerous occasions. The sheer frustration it all would leave anyone scraping the barrel for some more energy and motivation to keep on trying.\nI'm not biased at all, but the best thing in the world that I can ever imagine, is being Everton's centre forward and scoring goals that help win games. It's the ultimate dream and life long fantasy. I'm sure Dominic can't wait to get back into that role permanently.\n160 Posted 09/04/2023 at 11:38:49\nNobody would be able to convince me that he doesn't love playing for Everton either, but imagine being the only decent centre forward, at a club, that doesn't have any other decent centre forwards, (no disrespect to Simms or Maupay, but they are either not ready or will never be able to lead the line single handedly, the way Dominic can) and are having to constantly try and play when you just don't feel right?\nNot on top of your game, and you will hear things about our centre forward (yourself) wearing nickers & bra's, and getting slaughtered by all and sundry, simply because the football club you play for has been desperately mismanaged for years, and they haven't even got one other player who can take your place adequately. (Something that has gone on for years)\nI love Everton, I think I'd die for Everton, but if I was getting slaughtered for playing, when I was struggling and wasn't quite right, then it would break my heart, and the only way it could be rectified is by getting one hundred percent fit.\nThat would be my feelings, and until/unless you get a manager who is prepared to stop you from hiding from nothing, by taking you out the firing line, and allowing you to concentrate on getting yourself totally right, then I don't know any other way, how a player could totally recover?\nI keep saying it Brian, but hopefully Dyche is going to reep the rewards, even if I'm also just guessing, mate!\n161 Posted 09/04/2023 at 11:51:05\nDavies needs to come in and protect the Defence. Iwobi is frustrating. He continually loses possession either trying to dribble or a loose pass.\nOne win in the last 7 is a concern and if we don't beat Fulham then Palace away is absolutely huge.\n162 Posted 09/04/2023 at 11:53:30\nTotally agree, and I suspect many on here, hope you will follow him too ! :-)\n163 Posted 09/04/2023 at 12:05:15\nVery good post and very true. Some of the abuse players get based on nothing but biased opinion is ridiculous.\nCalvert-Lewin has put the hard work in for this club over the years and has earnt his paypacket.\nSome of the asinine comments about what he wears just shows a lack of maturity. Society moaned about Teddy Boys, Punk Rockers, New Romantics beacuse it was a change from the norm. Calvert-Lewin is doing nothing wrong he is just dressing different from the norm and some can't handle it.\n164 Posted 09/04/2023 at 12:11:33\nYesterday wasn't because Simms started, it was because the shape of the team was wrong. We should have played a 3rd central midfielder to replace DoucourÃ© and compressed the space that way.\nInstead, we pushed the defence up to try to close the space and this just invited balls over the top for the likes of Rashford and their other speedy players to thrive as our slow central defence were forced to turn backwards and chase quicker players.\nGodfrey is the quick one but playing a right-footed centre-back at left-back in that system was madness too. Hopefully Dyche has learnt from his mistake yesterday and plays a more compact side for the rest of the season.\n165 Posted 09/04/2023 at 12:11:47\nAlthough we're struggling for wins, we're picking up points at a much better rate than most others around us.\n166 Posted 09/04/2023 at 12:25:03\nI have been at a low ebb most of the day because we weren't at the races â€“ never mind Old Trafford. We were just not there mentally, and never first to a ball or even second to it.\nIt was painful to watch: no high energy and some dreadful marking especially in the first half. How it stayed at 1-0l was down to Pickford.\nThe back four to a man were poor, very poor, we sorely missed DoucourÃ©, Garner when he came on was up for it, but by then it was far too late.\nI worry that the ineptitude of this display is our baseline and not just a bad day at the office. The motivation, energy and drive were non-existent, it was a team of dead men walking. I hope Dyche tares a few strips of them.\nThat's not to say we were anywhere near Man Utd in terms of individual ability, but endeavour can compensate to a point.\nWe need a moral boost and I think, hope, that bringing Calvert-Lewin back into the team will be a huge lift â€“ God knows we need it. Each game has to have a plan to win it, not just parking the bus and hoping for a breakaway.\nIf we had taken the couple of chances we had, it would have been a different headline, but for that to happen we need a dedicated striker.\nIf we succumb to it all and go down, the responsibility is solely on the club. (Sorry, Darren H if your listening in.) We need to operate at our players' peak every game to stand a chance. We didn't yesterday... winning is now everything.\n167 Posted 09/04/2023 at 12:27:19\nThat's a good explanation of what actually happened and the reasons why.\n168 Posted 09/04/2023 at 12:27:57\nWhen you think of millions and millions we've spent on midfield players while Tom's been here at the club, I'd say not many have been much better than him. Sigurdsson, Gana, Jamesâ€¦ maybe DoucourÃ© but only recently has he been playing well.\nWe've spunked 𧴜s of millions on midfielders that have come and gone and Tom's still there trying his hardest.\nYes, he's not world-class and lacks pace but, as a sqaud member, he's done a job.\nSome will write off Onana and Garner too, when these are still young developing players that need patience.\n169 Posted 09/04/2023 at 12:30:59\nI didn't think Simms was isolated yesterday. I thought he kept getting the wrong side of their defenders, and didn't do enough to get to the ball first.\nI thought he kept allowing Man Utd's defenders to keep picking up our clearances, because he was always too far ahead of the ball, and should have been dropping deeper and competing, instead of just allowing this to happen.\nWe all see a different game.\n170 Posted 09/04/2023 at 12:32:20\nAgree 100%, mate.\n171 Posted 09/04/2023 at 12:38:15\n49% of Man Utd attacks were on the right wing, suggesting they identified the weakness you pointed out. In previous games, opposition attacks were predominately down the left wing.\n173 Posted 09/04/2023 at 12:39:18\nDyche ould have been well within his rights to change it after the first 20 minutes, and probably should have and admitted his original fuck-up. Martinez is slow but skilful and strong and Godfrey pushed up, making up the ground when needed; again, madness and I take it he was not following instructions; otherwise, he wouldn't have been hooked, surely?\nWe never get anything at Old Trafford so forget it and move on. Next week will be a real test of where we are under Dyche.\n174 Posted 09/04/2023 at 12:42:10\nHe could make all the difference if gets a few games. Wouldn't it be demoralising to the player, fans and team if like Lampard did he kept saying he might be fit for the next game, or 1 week, 2 weeks, putting more pressure on and then having to say no he's not ready or \"It's going to take longer\". That would feel like setbacks when it's not if he was never fit!\nA few games with a fully fit Calvert-Lewin will be better for us than a handful of half-arsed performances from the lad because he's not fully fit!!\n175 Posted 09/04/2023 at 12:45:50\n176 Posted 09/04/2023 at 13:23:18\nIs that an option??\n177 Posted 09/04/2023 at 13:29:26\n178 Posted 09/04/2023 at 13:39:40\nNow I hate the Red shite as much as the next person, but with being of the older generation, It still never fails to bring back that awful event and unhappy memories.\nI have no doubt whatsoever that Evertonians will stand strong alongside the enemy for that Day, we always do it with class, show our respect, then hopefully pick up three points on Saturday.\n179 Posted 09/04/2023 at 13:51:09\n180 Posted 09/04/2023 at 14:01:10\n181 Posted 09/04/2023 at 14:03:28\nAnyway back to the main topic, yesterdays game has gone, three points a must Saturday.\n182 Posted 09/04/2023 at 14:12:56\n183 Posted 09/04/2023 at 14:15:00\nAnd on long term contracts with high wages too!\n184 Posted 09/04/2023 at 14:20:02\n185 Posted 09/04/2023 at 14:31:59\nAgreed that it is a result we can look past given the recent form on defence. Carry on.\n186 Posted 09/04/2023 at 15:42:53\nThat's right, he isn't and I'll bet you're not a careers adviser either.\n187 Posted 09/04/2023 at 18:15:44\nThe only professional part is picking up money on false pretences on a regular basis, in all fairness to Tom, the would be ' Sheep Hand ', he is not alone !\nSilence of the Shams !\n188 Posted 09/04/2023 at 19:17:22\nLast year they celebrated on the streets on the Heysel anniversary after winning the cup. They don't care but want sympathy for Hillsborough!\n189 Posted 09/04/2023 at 19:22:21\nCOYB\n190 Posted 09/04/2023 at 19:30:51\nI think Dyche toyed with the idea of shoving Keane upfront prior to his scoring the equaliser against Spurs, not sure if Dyche was joking or not, but could he be any worse than what we currently have?\n191 Posted 09/04/2023 at 20:11:26\n192 Posted 09/04/2023 at 20:15:12\nDon't agree with throwing Keane up top. The team and formation should be the one that worked v Chelsea and Spurs - just put Davies in for Doucoure with a flea in his ear and the chance to resurrect his career with us, his boyhood club. Until DCL is fit.\n193 Posted 09/04/2023 at 20:29:07\n194 Posted 09/04/2023 at 20:55:39\nJust a correction - we drew 1-1 at OT last season.\nTownsend scored, we had a VAR goal overturned and ironically Ben Godfrey was man of the match at left back\n195 Posted 09/04/2023 at 21:04:50\n196 Posted 09/04/2023 at 21:10:26\n197 Posted 09/04/2023 at 21:25:58\n198 Posted 09/04/2023 at 22:47:24\n199 Posted 10/04/2023 at 06:31:16\nI agree.\n200 Posted 10/04/2023 at 06:51:46\n201 Posted 10/04/2023 at 07:26:00\nAs a kid, when you were 6-0 down on a 'freezing wet n windy Wednesday afternoon' and just wanted to go home for your tea, Mike's never say die attitude shone through. A true blue, those same Trojan attributes, which he later epitomised so well, serving EFC for so many years after.\nI'm greatly saddened to hear of his recent problems with dementia. But knowing Mike I'm certain he will face his condition in his own sunny indomitable style. I'm still in touch with his old classmate Phil Murray. We were speaking fondly of memories of Mike recently. I don't know how long he's here from Australia for, but If anybody reads this and is able to put us in touch, then two of his old mates from his youth would dearly love to meet up with him to share old times.\n202 Posted 10/04/2023 at 08:14:00\nThe advantage Davies has over Onana is that he is more experienced and hopefully has improved in keeping possession under Dyche. Onana still needs more training in marking up and awareness but, like all Everton players, is under the pressure of time in a relegation battle.\nSimms is in the same situation. His first two starts have been in a Merseyside derby at Anfield and at Old Trafford an hour away. Well that is what it seems like when you travel there, which would be a derby game anywhere else.\nThis game has been the first statistical setback for Dyche. He will have learn't a lot about it. He himself said there was a fall down on basics and other analysis done has confirmed him as right.\nOn MotD, on hearing Dyche's analysis, the pundits said they could not add to his correct analysis and showed clips as examples of what he was talking about. So that is a good start going into the next game â€“ the manager knows where the problem lies and where he got it wrong himself.\n203 Posted 10/04/2023 at 08:26:46\nI reckon we'll see Davies in the DoucourÃ© role against Fulham, with Gray back up top.\n204 Posted 10/04/2023 at 09:22:44\n205 Posted 10/04/2023 at 10:52:05\nThanks for that Jeff. I'll look into it.\nI agree with you regarding his dementia issues, that exact thought crossed my mind.\n206 Posted 10/04/2023 at 11:09:15\nThey don't make them like they used to, especially when you realize that these academies are actually taking natural aggression out of these young children.\nI hope you get to meet your old mate Phil, because knowing the type of person Mike Lyons is, I'm sure it would make his day. He's a very genuine nice man, but you don't need me to tell you that.\n207 Posted 10/04/2023 at 11:45:43\n208 Posted 10/04/2023 at 12:04:11\n209 Posted 10/04/2023 at 12:25:04\nSeems the same incident happened in the Spurs game against Brighton, almost identical and yes you guessed it, no penalty awarded to Brighton.\nSo on that basis, the official has got it wrong on one of those decisions, it is either two penalties or none.\nIn my opinion, both players played to get a penalty, if you are about to kick a ball, and some player puts his foot there, what else can a player do but kick the other player's foot?\n211 Posted 10/04/2023 at 12:54:32\nThe officials seem to just give the least controversial decisions lately. The VARs or the on-field refs just want the least controversy.\nTake Maguire's rugby tackle on gray on Saturday, he has 2 hands round him holding him back, he even grabs his shorts. If that was Rashford at the other end, it would be a nailed-on penalty and probably a red card for stopping a goal scoring opportunity. The VAR didn't even look at it!!!\nBut it's less controversial to not give Everton a penalty because the media won't blow it up like if it was Man Utd, Arsenal, Man City or Liverpool. It's just a joke how they favour the big clubs.\n212 Posted 10/04/2023 at 13:03:26\nThe club does not kick up enough fuss about this. Decisions change matches. We would have beaten Spurs if not for the Doucoure sending-off. And if Doucoure had a red shirt on, like Mane in last season's derby no action would have been taken.\nOne of the reasons Anfield and Old Trafford are graveyard grounds for us is because we are given nothing while they get everything.\n213 Posted 10/04/2023 at 13:16:50\nThe guy he was talking to said we are advised to give them some weeks but not the following week, now I am not sure what he meant because the subject got quickly changed, but from what I could read into it, was saying the VAR can only get involved some of the time and other times keep out of it.\nSurely that is the whole point of the VAR, not to pick and choose, but step in every time they feel they need to.\n214 Posted 10/04/2023 at 13:45:02\nHi, nice to read your report. People never believed me when I said Mick Lyons played for the Lobster, but I seen him. I ran a team in the Sunday League, the Norgreen, and was friends with T Gannon and H Scott and was also on the League Management Committee.\nThe Lobster had another well-known player who played for them J O'Leary, I think that is how you spell his name. We had a young player who was on Everton's books around that time N Whitehead. My Wife and her family lived in Portlemouth Road.\n215 Posted 10/04/2023 at 14:02:29\nNot the first time I've heard something along those lines, different teams, different 'Rules of Engagement'\nOr in some teams' cases, 'Rules of Disengagement'.\n216 Posted 10/04/2023 at 14:03:21\n217 Posted 10/04/2023 at 14:21:47\nDanny O'Neill is coming up from London too, so hoping to see everyone pre-match in the Harlech Castle (County Road opp KFC), handy for most including Jim Lloyd, think Stephen Vincent may come also, and anyone else who wants to put in an appearance for an impromptu ' Get Together ' will be more than welcome, but don't expect me to get the Ale in, well I might if I get a win on the Donkeys. :-)\n218 Posted 10/04/2023 at 14:53:45\nNo, luckily the Dyche Meister seems to have turned misfiring donkeys to finer equinesque analogies, at home at least, may we hurdle the Fulham Fence with aplomb and win at a canter.\nUp the Toffees and looking forward to Saturday and being in the company of such fine long suffering evertonians for whom real footballing joy is long overdue as we have been circling the drain while flittering hundreds of millions in recent years. You could not make it up. Onwards and upwards please lord from this perilous position. COYB.\n219 Posted 10/04/2023 at 16:12:13\n220 Posted 10/04/2023 at 16:49:37\n221 Posted 10/04/2023 at 17:44:35\nIt didn't clash with any other event as far as I know, John Hall had come over all the way from the Philippines, hence the reason that date was chosen, as he had previously expressed a desire to meet as many Evertonians as possible. (?)\nI appreciate that at present, it is not the easiest place to get to to, as there are no buses on that route yet. The nearest Train Station is Sandhills which requires about a 15 minute walk to Bramley Moore. There was little or no excuse last time either, as Tony Abrahams had kindly offered along with Neil Copeland to ferry anyone who wanted to go down from Goodison Park.\nThey even offered to make two trips if there were too many wanting to go down. So, there was no excuse at all last time, for anyone not being able to get there. The Bar Staff at the Bramley, are only too willing to phone a Taxi for anyone wanting to leave, to catch a Train or other Transport at the end of the evening, so come on folks ' heads up for the next one ' !\n222 Posted 10/04/2023 at 17:53:32\n223 Posted 10/04/2023 at 18:05:34\nLooking forward to meeting up again for the Fulham game. Not seen Andy since the TW meeting at The Excelsior a couple of seasons ago. Sounds like there will be a few at The Harlech and looking forward to seeing everyone.\nBack to the game against Manure, I can't really criticise the team selection because that is line up I wanted to see. It shows how much work Doucoure does by the way we were torn to pieces. Both goals were disappointing ones to concede but overall I would say we got away with 2-0, it could have been seriously embarrassing.\nI think Dyche will have learned from the game and fully expect to see Davies or Garner come in in place of Simms who, I agree with others, looks better as an impact sub for now.\nHopefully Seamus will be fit, I know he made an error for the second goal (very unfortunate slip IMO) but he has been brilliant. Also, Patterson doesn't look ready yet which is no surprise given his lack of game time.\nThe other issue is Godfrey, how many times is he going to be caught out of position before the penny drops? His pace seems to be returning as exemplified by his cracking recovery tackle on Antony (I think). He makes me so nervous though. Problem is that Mykolenko appears to have lost form and confidence (looked better on Saturday than of late though).\nSo, a few dilemmas to sort out. Maybe DCL will be fit and give us s bit more bite up frontâ€¦..\n224 Posted 10/04/2023 at 21:49:40\nThe comment at the end about DCL coming back. We desperately hope so don't we, but it seems a persistent forlorn hope.\nI was shocked we failed to get Viktor Gyokeres over the line in January, I seriously worry we will rue that January window abject failure come May.\n225 Posted 10/04/2023 at 21:59:59\nMy comment regarding DCL was intended as being more than a little sarcastic, I too think it may be forlorn.\nAgree also in respect of the lad from Coventry I thought that would have been straight forward really. But, I think the financial situation tells us the real reason why we didn't sign him.\n226 Posted 10/04/2023 at 22:34:59\n227 Posted 10/04/2023 at 23:44:36\nI think Dyche is doing and has done as well as could have reasonably been expected. Despite that, given the remaining fixtures and the state we are in, its proper touch and go whether we can hang on by our finger nails to our top flight status.\n228 Posted 10/04/2023 at 23:47:33\n229 Posted 11/04/2023 at 00:08:12\n230 Posted 11/04/2023 at 07:26:05\n231 Posted 11/04/2023 at 13:46:19\nHow much easier would that make it, if your in a random pub, and spot the badge on another person, even on none match Day.\n232 Posted 11/04/2023 at 14:16:17\n233 Posted 11/04/2023 at 14:58:54\nBadgecompany.co.uk\n11 Cannon Grove\nFetcham\nLeatherhead\nSurrey\nKT22 9LG\nUnited Kingdom\n234 Posted 11/04/2023 at 15:06:51\nAny chance of a poll Ed's to see how many would have a badge.\n235 Posted 11/04/2023 at 15:10:44\n236 Posted 11/04/2023 at 15:12:21\n237 Posted 11/04/2023 at 15:15:29\nAnyway on to Saturday, my train gets in lime street around 12.10, so if any others fancy a swift drink in the North western Wetherspoons whatever it's called who are catching the train in to Liverpool see you in there, before I head off for the bus and the Harlech pub, for around 1\n238 Posted 11/04/2023 at 15:27:09\n239 Posted 11/04/2023 at 15:34:57\nHi Brian [231] your idea of badges is excellent, I feel sure that there will be someone who ''knows someone'' and I think that we can rustle up the money to make the idea become reality.\nI hope that you can forgive me if I 'Blow my own trumpet', by saying that the first get-together was a result of my seven week stay in Southport Hospital [ five nil by mouth] which led to the invitation in July 2018, to express my appreciation to all who posted their kind regards, relayed to me by my daughter Nicki.\nThe get-together took place in the Central Hotel on the day of the World Cup Final, my [80th birthday], and it's true to say that from 12-noon to 7-pm friendships were cemented and have lasted. At the gathering were, Dave Abrahams, Tony Abrahams, Steve Fearns, Bill Griffiths, George McKane, Gerard McKean, Peter Mills, and Myself. One final 'Blow on the trumpet', I'm the only ever-present.\nHi Bill, [232] I believe you traveled from North Wales to attend the get-together that day, something that was much appreciated. I hope to see you in the Harlech on Saturday.\n240 Posted 11/04/2023 at 15:47:40\nJoking aside though John, I was unaware of the earlier meet ups and only cottoned onto them last season, after meeting Steve, Jim, Derek, Bill, Jim and Danny in the crown.\nIt was a great idea by yourself John and certainly worthy of a big Pat on the back.\nIt's always good when we have a meet up and always a pleasure to bump into you John.\nLooking forward to the Harlech on Saturday and after tipping Keane to score against Spurs, McNeil against Brentford, I am going for the hatrick and going for Calvert-Lewin to make a suprise return and score.\n241 Posted 11/04/2023 at 15:48:16\nIt will be better to see you and the others you mention, who have become friends through the life and soul that connects us regardless of who we are or where we come from.\n242 Posted 11/04/2023 at 16:21:17\n243 Posted 11/04/2023 at 16:23:47\nLooking at his stats out on loan, he has played 12 games, scored 4 goals and 7 assists so far, with a 40 yarder goal in his last game.\nWhether we keep the player or not I still think Nkounkou will make an excellent left sided midfielder rather than a left back.\n244 Posted 11/04/2023 at 16:30:46\n245 Posted 11/04/2023 at 17:53:44\n246 Posted 11/04/2023 at 18:02:55\n247 Posted 11/04/2023 at 19:06:41\nI new Norman better than most as he played for me for 2 yrs. The owner of Skemersdale had to get permission from me for him to play for them.\nOne of our players Dad, with a reporter from the Express got Norman's release from Everton as they would only play him and not often in the (B) Team.\nNorman was his own worst enemy, he played a trial game at Nottingham and they wanted to sign him but when they found out he was on Everton;s books they got him out of Nottingham a hell of a lot quicker than they did Robin Hood.\nI am not sure how Rochdale heard about him but apparently 1 of their coaches Lived in Liverpool someone said Scarisbrick road but I am not sure about that, and I took him up to Rochdale where he played for their reserves that night, and after that they signed him.\nThe replay at Maine road for Skemersdale, I was amazed that he played as on the TUES or WED before it he showed us his foot, and it had cuts and bruises over it and he had someone else's shoe on as he couldn't get his on.\n248 Posted 11/04/2023 at 19:10:55\nGareth Bale\nAndy Hinchcliffe\n249 Posted 11/04/2023 at 19:17:33\nNorman was a good mate of my cousin and my cousin went to PNE with him for a trial game when Alan Ball's dad was manager there, my cousin done some laughing over Ball's dad, said he was a real character.\n250 Posted 11/04/2023 at 19:22:38\nGood Stuff, man. Write something up about those times. I'm sure more than a few would enjoy the read.\n251 Posted 11/04/2023 at 19:50:58\nWe've had a few like this over the years who we don't really know what their best position is before we've shoehorned them.\nMore recent examples: Godfrey and Holgate. I don't know where they fit. Mykolenko could be a left-sided centre-back in a back 3.\nGoing back, didn't we have concerns over Baines's defensive qualities initially and tried Seamus out as a right-sided midfielder?\nBack further, if the ageing memory still serves me, didn't Ratcliffe start as a left-back before moving central?\nI know most players eventually settle on a position, but let them develop and feel where they are best placed.\nOnly rarely do you get a Milner. I feel sick for saying that, so I will redeem myself with Alan Harper. It's rare to get players who can practically play in most positions.\n252 Posted 11/04/2023 at 19:55:08\n253 Posted 11/04/2023 at 2023/04/11 : 21:21:52\nI was very surprised to see Sean Dyche choose only 2 centre midfielders, against Utd, in the absence of Doucoure. Leaving Gueye and Onana on their own to win the midfield battle at a place like Old Trafford was a mistake.\nI think most people thought bringing in Garner for Doucoure was the obvious thing to do and I hope Dyche now realises this error and plays Garner against Fulham.\nYes, having Gray and Simms in the team together gives us more attacking options but if you don't have an effective midfield they will not see enough of the ball to cause problems.\nIf Dyche is going to revert to 4-4-2 from 4-5-1 Gueye needs a reliable passer with him and Onana is not that, he is too unreliable. Better to have Gueye with Garner and then decide whether to give Onana or Davies the Doucoure role or go with Gray.\nI don't like making too many changes to a team but one thing I would like Sean Dyche to consider is bringing in Patterson at right back and moving Seamus to the right flank of the midfield.\nI think this would make the right side defensively stronger and I actually think it would give us a greater attacking threat down the right too. Both Patterson and Coleman are dangerous going forward and Seamus wouldn't have the problem of getting up and down the pitch as much. But his influence would still be there in a better position.\nIt would also release Iwobi to play in his best position, where Doucoure has been playing.\nIt is getting very worrying now, we need a few wins, and anything we can do to give us more attacking options should be considered without, weakening our midfield too much.\nIf DCL is fit or close it is time to play him. It is time to ask him to fight for the club. Play him for 60 minutes and then bring on Simms or Gray or both, but keep Gueye and Garner together in midfield.\nThere are nearly 40,000 Evertonians who pay good money to support the team and thousands more who would like to. If DCL can't see this and think he now has to do everything he can to help the team there is something very wrong.\nIf we could beat Fulham it will be massive, if we don't the trap door starts to open.\nAnd if we can beat Fulham I would consider a formation of 460 against Palace with Gray Davies and/or Onana making runs into the box. Palace will not be easy as no game is now. But I'd like to think we could pinch a 1.0.\nI'm tempted to say I would take 6 points from the next 4 games, and 6 from the 4 after that but I have no idea if that would be enough.\nWe have to aim to get at least above Leeds. I can see Leicester suddenly coming up with a good run of form but Southampton and Forest are definitely going to fight on. Bournemouth keep picking up wins as do Wolves.\nSo we must fight on no matter what and hope it's the other teams that pick up the injuries, suspensions, bad refereeing and bad luck.\nThe madness of this club is obvious. First we send Simms on loan when we could have done with him, then we bring him back only to send Tom Cannon on loan. Unbelievable.\nIn view of this I think Dyche should have players like Sherif, Okoronkwo, Mills on the bench. I cannot see how it would do any harm to give them 10 minutes or so in a game. James Vaughan did it why not some of the youngsters we have now.\nThey would be itching to play and would give their all. It's desperate times and we should try anything we can that might just change a game.\nAll I can say to the supporters is:\nKeep up your fantastic support\nKeep off the pitch no matter what happens\nKeep the faith and no matter how the dice fall this season and next season one day it will all come good.\nCOYB!\n254 Posted 11/04/2023 at 21:26:02\nI keep saying and will say, no matter how many people shout at me, 4-4-2 is going to hurt you in the modern game.\nThe midfield will get overrun.\nNo point having two forwards if you aren't controlling the ball in midfield to supply them.\nI know we all have different views on the game. I watched Everton win titles and trophies playing 4-4-2. But that was then, not now.\n255 Posted 11/04/2023 at 21:30:38\nJust a little off subject, there was talk of a meet up on the 14th May, I cannot see the date being changed again but if City advance in the champs league, I am pretty sure the Champs league game is scheduled for the following midweek.\nIt could work in our favour, if City advance and have one eye on the following midweek game.\n256 Posted 11/04/2023 at 21:39:15\nDo not book your train ticket just yet Danny. :-)\n257 Posted 11/04/2023 at 21:46:14\n258 Posted 11/04/2023 at 21:49:25\n259 Posted 11/04/2023 at 22:15:36\nOur best fit and on form eleven is:\nPickford\nPatterson Coady Tarkowski Myko\nO'Nana Gueye Doucoure\nGray DCL McNeil.\nIn my opinion.\n260 Posted 11/04/2023 at 22:24:53\nPickford\nPatterson Keane Tarks Myko\nGarner Gueye Davies\nGray Simms McNeil.\nIn my opinion.\n261 Posted 11/04/2023 at 22:39:01\nIf City reach the semi final, then the second leg will be the following Tuesday, now the plot thickens as it is the Eurovision contest in Liverpool Sat 13th May.\nI would not be suprised if our game gets moved again to Saturday 13th.\n262 Posted 11/04/2023 at 02:49:05\nThe Future's Bright, The Future's Blue ! ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ‘\n263 Posted 12/04/2023 at 06:45:44\nSo it's quite possible if Michael and Lyndon get their commercial act together that they could do a deal with a company and make some money into the bargain. I wouldn't begrudge them making a few Bob from \"merch\" and they could expand into caps and T-shirts if there's demand.\n264 Posted 12/04/2023 at 11:05:55\nI would be very suprised if City play Sunday, then only have 1 day to recover and train for a semi-final.\n265 Posted 12/04/2023 at 12:46:19\nHas no one asked the question, while he and the board are staying away, why have they not donated their seats to Everton in the Community for supporters who may be struggling financially?\nOr donate them to their fan club?\nThere you go, Martinâ€¦ email Bill and see if he will sort you a couple of seats out, for the Fulham game. You may have to go in a ballot of 4 though to be drawn out.\n266 Posted 12/04/2023 at 12:58:59\nI always said, we should never have been made to play Man Utd in the FA Cup Final only 3 days after the European Cup Winner's Cup Final in Rotterdam.\nThe FA should have rescheduled once they knew we were going to Rotterdam.\nRegarding the vacant board seats. I've been calling that since their self-decided absence. There are enough Everton supporters out there that either can't get or can't afford to get tickets.\nSold out as usual for Saturday, apart from empty seats in the Directors Box and those no doubt in the away section.\n267 Posted 12/04/2023 at 13:08:02\nI could not agree more, Danny, had we got an extra day or so, I have no doubt we would have landed the treble. Man Utd did not play us off the pitch, fatigue beat us in the end.\n268 Posted 12/04/2023 at 13:13:17\n269 Posted 12/04/2023 at 13:53:09\nI was at an Everton dinner the following week and Sharp was one of the guests so I went over to his table and asked him about that Man Utd cup final.\n“Why do you think we lost against a team we had beat twice that season and they only had 10men, Graeme?â€ I askedâ€¦\n\"We were absolutely knackered,\" he replied.\n“I knowâ€ I said, “So why didn't you tell that horrible red bastard that on the radio last week?â€\nHe shook his head and laughed but I was fuming because I knew the Liverpudlian and he's another one of that crowd â€“ the crowd that are never wrong!\n270 Posted 12/04/2023 at 13:54:10\nThen Psycho Pat for whatever reason not making Whiteside go on the outside of him with his weaker foot.\nWe had 2 that hit the woodwork and went to safety, they had one that hit the woodwork but went in.\nBut it was as clear as Day you could see the players were shattered even against ten.\n271 Posted 12/04/2023 at 14:15:18\n272 Posted 13/04/2023 at 16:32:45\nAlthough it may have taken a little longer than anticipated, I believe that it will lead to greater attendances, especially when we move to the Bramley Moore Stadium.\nI was delighted when Dave Abrahams, Tony Abrahams, Steve Fearns, Bill Griffiths, George McKane, Gerard McKean, and Peter Mills, helped me celebrate my 80th birthday.\nI look forward to sharing your company on Saturday, and meeting new 'Friends'\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
