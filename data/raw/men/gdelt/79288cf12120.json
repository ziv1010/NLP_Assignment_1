The doubt was from outside,’ the Italian told reporters.\n‘All the ones that have the answers or the ones that have the truth, they were saying that we are too young, we are not good enough, they were waiting for Aston Villa to drop points for us to achieve the Champions League.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

Unfortunately for them, they have all been wrong. All the ones that have the truth and have the answer to everything.\n‘So in English, how you say? F off to all of them, because the players deserve that. The effort they have been doing is fantastic.\n‘I feel part of their improvement, the way they grew through the season, and I feel especially proud for that because they are a fantastic group, a fantastic squad. They are good boys, they work hard, they try to help each other.\nFinal Premier League table 2024/25\n- Liverpool – 84pts\n- Arsenal – 74pts\n- Man City – 71pts\n- Chelsea – 69pts\n- Newcastle – 66pts\n- Aston Villa – 66pts\n- Nottingham Forest – 65pts\n‘And I said, probably most of the time, it was from outside, that we were not good enough, we were too young, we don’t have a leader, blah, blah, blah, these kind of things. But at the end, it all comes from results.’\nMore Trending\nMaresca’s comments were echoed by Chelsea captain Reece James, minus the language, who told BBC Radio 5 Live: ‘It is an amazing feeling.\n‘We had to dig in. We both needed to win, but I am so happy that the team got the job done today. We talk about being the best team-mate and everybody showed that today.\n‘So many people before the season, during the season had disbelief – they told us “we were you young, inexperienced and were not going to make it”. But we are here.\n‘The season has been long and tough. We started off so well, but then we had a dip. Going into another final and we have our eyes on the prize.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Unai Emery sends message to Man Utd and Arsenal over Emiliano Martinez transfer\nMORE: ‘I hope one day!’ Tearful Trent Alexander-Arnold sends emotional message to Liverpool fans\nMORE: Three Manchester United players leave club after final game of season",
