'My dream has always been to play abroad. I played 400 games in the J League and wanted a new challenge.\n\"I am very happy here. I have a lot of experience and the coach wants me to make the team better.\"\nMizunuma played under Ange Postecoglou, Kevin Muscat, Harry Kewell and John Hutchinson at Yokohama F Marinos.\n\"Australian coaches are very good,\" he said. \"I learnt off all four of them. That is why I am here because of them.\"\nMizunuma arrived in Newcastle on Sunday night and did a conditioning session with the squad on Tuesday.\nBaring a mishap, he is keen to play against Perth and couple of countrymen and new arrivals Yuto Misao and Takuya Okamoto.\n\"I have many friends playing in the A-League,\" Mizunuma said. \"It is a different style to Japan, but it's a very exciting league.\n\"I played against Central Coast a month ago in the Asian Champions League. I have watched a lot of the A-League when in Japan. It is a physical league, lots of running.\"\nMizunuma arrived at his first press conference dressed in a three-piece suit and coach Rob Stanton said he had been equally impressive on the training pitch.\n\"You could see his touches and the way he worked in tight spaces, he is quality,\" Stanton said. \"He will have to adapt in some areas.\n\"He did 90 per cent of a conditioning session today and got through it fine. His last game was in mid December and he has been training. We have a couple more sessions before Saturday and I would like to think he will be involved against Perth.\nMORE NEWCASTLE SPORT\n\"He brings a wealth of experience of knowledge. He has played at the highest level in Japan. It's exciting to have on board.\n\"We will give us qualities that we don't have which I am excited about. You could see the players lift today.\"\nMizunuma has played the majority of his career as a right winger but is comfortable in a central role.\nThe Jets normally play with inverted wingers.\n\"He has watched us play many times,\" Stanton said. \"He likes our style. He said a lot of A-League teams play direct but he likes that we try and play a possession game. That was part of the attraction to coming here.\n\"That was good to hear. He did his research and knows the way we play which is really good.\"\nMizunuma led Yokohama against Sydney FC in the Asian Cup in 2022 when Stanton was assistant to Steve Corica at the Sky Blues.\n\"When his name came forward I recognised straight away that he was captain of Yokohama,\" Stanton said. \"In Japan that is a big position to hold. You are held in very high regard.\n\"One area we have lacked since I have been here is experience.\n\"It might open doors for other players in that region as well.\n\"He won't be required to play 90 minutes every week. I want players who can change games and offer different things. It is exciting to have a player of that quality.\"\nMizunuma's wife and daughter will join him in Newcastle.\nJapanese international adds class, experience to young Jets outfit\nNEWCASTLE Jets have confirmed the signing of Kota Mizunuma and the Japanese international could make his debut in the must-win game against Perth Glory at McDonald Jones Stadium on Saturday.\nMizunuma trained with the squad this morning in Maitland after inking a deal until the end of the 2024-25 A-League campaign. His contract has triggers that could extend his stay until the end of 2025-26..\nThe 34-year-old recently completed a season with Yokohama F. Marinos and played the last of his two internationals in 2022.\nAn attacking midfielder, Mizunuma played under Australians Ange Postecoglou, Kevin Muscat, Harry Kewell and John Hutchinson at Yokohama.\nHe can play in a wide or central attacking role and will add much-needed experience to a youth Jets squad, who have lost senior players Aleks Susnjar and Dane Ingham to long-term injuries.\n\"Kota is a player who brings a wealth of experience and quality to our side,\" Jets coach Rob Stanton said. \"He's very versatile in the final third and will add a unique style to our attack. His resume speaks for itself, and he is a winner. I'm so happy to bring him here to Newcastle.\"\nThe Newcastle Herald revealed on Sunday that the Mizunuma was in the club's sights.\nHis addition is the first of possible two during the A-League transfer window which opened on January 12.\nTanzania international and former Macarthur midfielder Charles M'Mombwa has been training with the Jets for the past two weeks.\nThe A-League transfer window closes on February 12.",
