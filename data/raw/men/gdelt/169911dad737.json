Guimaraes has been one of many star performers in a well-drilled Newcastle side that secured the club's first taste of Champions League football in 20 years.\nWorld domination may have to wait, but here's what lies ahead in Newcastle's assault on the continent.\nWhat 2023/24 Champions League pot are Newcastle in?\nUnlike the glory days of the European Cup, when the likes of Diego Maradona's Napoli could face Real Madrid in the first round, the Champions League group stage is seeded.\nAll 32 teams are split into four pots which are evenly spread between the eight groups. Pot one consists of the league winners from England, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Portugal and the Netherlands - Europe's seven highest-ranked divisions - as well as the Champions League and Europa League champions.\nThe rest of the teams are filtered into each pot according to their UEFA club coefficient - a proxy for quality. This figure is usually the sum of points earned from European competition over the past five seasons but Newcastle have not graced any continental stage since reaching the quarter-finals of the Europa League in 2013. Therefore, Newcastle's ranking is 20% of the Premier League's association coefficient.\nAs a result of their low ranking, Newcastle will enter the competition in pot four. Theoretically, this means the toughest possible draw for the Magpies, however, it will all come down to luck when the balls are drawn.\nNewcastle's 2023/24 potential Champions League group stage opponents\nWith their fate in pot four now confirmed, Newcastle will face one side from each of the other three pots.\nThe Magpies are guaranteed to avoid the three other English sides in the competition - Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal - as two teams from the same association cannot be drawn together.\nHowever, Newcastle will face one team from each of the other three star-studded pots. Barcelona delivered the decisive blow to ensure Sir Bobby Robson's Newcastle didn't advance from the second group phase of the competition back in 2003. Xavi Hernandez was subbed off at half-time in that contest but could lead the Blaugrana back to St James' Park as manager.\nIn the immediate aftermath of Newcastle's takeover, fanciful rumours of Kylian Mbappe's imminent arrival on Tyneside proliferated social media. If he remains in the French capital this summer, Mbappe could go up against Newcastle from the tip of Paris Saint-Germain's attack.\nThe champions of Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands - Napoli, Benfica and Feyenoord respectively - also lie in wait, as do perennial Europa League winners Sevilla.\nPot two may not have the numerical edge over pot one but it contains plenty of formidable foes. Record-champions Real Madrid headline this section, with 2023 runners-up Inter also looming ominously.\nAfter leaving Bournemouth in 2020, Howe famously spent time watching Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid train. The combative Argentine's wily tactics have been laced through Newcastle's successful season, crystallised by Howe's mantra: \"We're not here to be popular; we’re here to compete.\" A group-stage double-header between Newcastle and Atletico would certainly be one for the purists.\nWhile Howe was still in charge of Bournemouth, he flew to Empoli to learn from the club's then-manager Maurizio Sarri. The chain-smoking former banker is now in charge of Lazio, a potential opponent for Newcastle now they are certain to be in pot four.\n2023 Champions League semi-finalists AC Milan, Austrian champions Red Bull Salzburg, Ukrainian top-flight winners Shakhtar Donetsk, Serbian behemoths Red Star Belgrade and Portuguese outfit Braga are the other clubs confirmed of a spot in pot three.\nNewcastle will avoid clashes with Union Berlin, Lens, Real Sociedad, Galatasaray and Celtic - clubs guaranteed to be the weakest team in each group on paper but with the potential to cause plenty of upsets against the continent's more established elite.\nNewcastle's toughest potential 2023/24 Champions League group (according to UEFA coefficient)\nIf Newcastle's start to the new Premier League season looks daunting, there is the potential for an even trickier return to the continent's premier club competition.\nBayern Munich and Real Madrid are two of the three highest-ranked clubs according to UEFA's coefficient - only freshly-crowned treble winners Manchester City are deemed to be more imperious.\nAs Bayern and Real occupy different pots and associations, they could feasibly be drawn together into what would immediately be brandished a group of death. As a team ranked outside the first two pots, there is every chance that Newcastle could wind up alongside these behemoths of the European landscape.\nNow that Newcastle are confirmed in pot four, the highest-ranked pot three side they could draw would be Shakhtar Donetsk. Despite the ongoing turmoil back home, Igor Jovicevic's spirited team won their domestic league and held Real Madrid to a 1-1 draw in last season's Champions League group stage.\nIf Newcastle are to live up to Guimaraes' goals of global recognition, they will have to compete with the best sides Europe has to offer - although, they may not want them all stuffed into the same Champions League group.",
