  "body_text": "The Arsenal Women will have the chance to be crowned European champions when they take on Barcelona Femení on Saturday, 24 May in Lisbon. The Gunners will be looking to end their season on a high after falling short in the domestic title race. Arsenal finished 12 points behind WSL champions Chelsea, who led the table throughout the campaign.\nDespite the disappointment, Arsenal closed out the league season with a thrilling 4–3 win over third-placed Manchester United. That result shifted focus to the club’s biggest match in years—the UEFA Women’s Champions League final, where they will have the opportunity to cap off a remarkable European campaign.\nArsenal’s journey to the final has captured attention\nArsenal’s run to the final has been nothing short of outstanding. They topped a group featuring Bayern Munich and Juventus with 15 points, before producing dramatic comebacks in both the quarter-finals and semi-finals.\nA 3–2 aggregate victory over Real Madrid was followed by an even more impressive turnaround against Lyon. After losing 2–1 at home in the first leg, many doubted Arsenal’s chances at the home of the eight-time European champions. But the Gunners defied the odds, producing a stunning 4–1 win in France to book their place in the final.\nThat result sent shockwaves through European football and set up a showpiece clash with Barcelona, who are aiming to win the competition for a third consecutive season.\nBonmatí surprised, but Arsenal have earned respect\nAhead of the final, Barcelona midfielder and Ballon d’Or winner Aitana Bonmatí expressed surprise at Arsenal reaching this stage of the tournament.\n“For me, it was a surprise, Arsenal reaching the final,” she told ESPN. “They absolutely deserve it, because scoring four goals against Lyon in the second leg is not easy at all. I congratulate them for that because I think it was a big surprise, but a well-deserved one.\n“It’s a final with a different feel because we’ve never played Arsenal in a final. It’s been a few years since we even played them. For that reason, it’s a new challenge for us, being able to play a different team.”\nArsenal will feature in just their second Women’s Champions League final, having lifted the trophy back in 2007. While the reigning champions present a formidable challenge, the Gunners have already taken down European heavyweights to reach this stage.\nWith belief and momentum on their side, Arsenal will head into the final knowing they have the quality to beat anyone. It will require their best performance of the season, but on their day, this team is capable of creating history once again.\nThoughts on Aitana Bonmatí’s comments?
