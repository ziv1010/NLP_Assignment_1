Petrovi? has been in charge of Levski, Litex and CSKA-Sofia throughout his magnificent career. Hope he gets well ? pic.twitter.com/T5PJmSOMse\n— Metodi_Shumanov (@shumanskoo) July 1, 2023\nAccording to a tweet from Bulgarian sports writer, Metodi Shumanov, Petrovic has been in a car crash on the outskirts of Belgrade.\nAt the time of writing it isn’t clear whether he is out of danger or not, but surely those who have played under him over the years will all be praying for him and wishing him well.",
