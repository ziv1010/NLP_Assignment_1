I think not! It is hardly a secret that Newcastle’s transfer business this summer is made extra difficult because the Newcastle United owners aren’t prepared to let the wage bill spiral, by adding players who demand significantly more than the current top earners.\nThe latest available info is for the 2021/22 season, accounts from both clubs available, Chelsea then had a wage bill more than double that of Newcastle United. I don’t think that gap has significantly closed yet.\nSadly, there does appear to be some truth in this Ollie Harrison to Chelsea story.\nWith the usually reliable Craig Hope of The Mail reporting:\n‘Big blow for NUFC with England U16 midfielder Ollie Harrison set to join Chelsea. Compo/tribunal to follow. Spurs/Wolves/Brighton were also interested. NUFC made player offer but weren’t going to break wage structure. Complicating factor is dad Steve is respected NUFC U14s coach.’\nVery disappointing if any promising young player decides to leave Newcastle United and it would especially be so in this case, as only three months ago, Ollie Harrison told the official NUFC site:\n“I’ve put in a lot of hard work over the years and a huge part of it comes from Newcastle and all the staff that have helped me at the Academy. My under-16s coaches are Iain (Bogie) and Mark (Atkinson) and I work with Graeme (Carrick) and Chris (Moore) when I play for the under-18s.\n“Everyone at the club have put a huge amount of time into my development as a player\n“The ultimate dream is playing at the top level. That’s what you work for everyday as a footballer, especially at the Academy.\n“I think it’s been a good season for me so far,” Harrison said. “I started the season really well, playing games for Newcastle under-16s and worked hard to get into the under-18s. I’ve played a few matches for them but then picked up an injury halfway through the season which was quite tough as I was on a good run of matches for the under-18s.\n“I just had to work hard to get back to the best level after my injury. Since then, I played a few matches and then got the England call-up which was really positive. I’m back playing with the under-18s, which I love. It’s a great test, physically, going up against older lads and helps with my development as a player.\n“The goal is play at the top level for Newcastle.\n“That’s always been a dream of mine since I was a young lad. I need to keep developing as a player, like I am now, and hopefully it continues to be positive in the future.”\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
