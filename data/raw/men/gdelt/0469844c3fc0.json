  "body_text": "In the past we have had weekends in the GAA when the phrase “Calculator Sunday” was used. But since Jarlath Burns took over as GAA president one of his favorite phrases is the ‘‘lack of jeopardy’’ in football’s Super 16s with 12 of the 16 counties progressing to the preliminary and quarter finals proper. Next year the GAA are going to scrap the “Super 16s” format, but I think for this year we can safely say that that this will be ‘‘Jeopardy Weekend’’ in the All-Ireland football championship.\nHowever, the calculator might still be needed to count the scoring aggregates. Counties like Kerry, Meath, Down, Monaghan and Armagh are all guaranteed to progress, but if you take Group 1, all four counties, Donegal, Mayo, Tyrone and Cavan are tied on 2 points each with just one round of games to be played. There are four games on Saturday and four on Sunday with identical throw-in times.\nThe big game in Group 1 is at 4 p.m. on Sunday in Dr. Hyde Park, Roscommon, where Donegal, who started the championship campaign as joint favorites to win the Sam Maguire Cup, play unpredictable Mayo. After losing their first game in Castlebar to Cavan, their first in the championship to the Breffnimen since 1948, Mayo bounced back to beat Tyrone in Omagh, when coach Stephen Rochford deputized for the hospitalized manager Kevin McStay. It’s a close one to call and the winners of the group will be guaranteed home advantage in the next round. At the same time on Sunday afternoon Tyrone should be too strong for Cavan in Brewster Park, Enniskillen. However, if Mayo are beaten, Cavan could survive on the head to head result against Mayo.\nIn Group 4 in Breffni Park on Saturday evening we have a repeat of the 2024 All-Ireland final when Armagh play Galway. Armagh won the final last year, but Galway need to win on Saturday to ensure staying in the race for Sam Maguire; a draw, though, might be enough, depending on results elsewhere. Derry, who like Galway have just one point, need to beat Dublin in Newry to advance.\nElsewhere in Group 2 it’s a bit simpler, Kerry need to beat Meath in Tullamore on Saturday to top the group and get home advantage in the next round, while Cork need to beat Roscommon in Portlaoise to save their season; a draw would do the Rossies. In Group4 it’s a straight shoot-out to decide the group winners when Down play Monaghan in the Athletic Grounds, Armagh, while the winners of the Louth vs Clare game in Portlaoise will also progress.\nLOCAL SCORES\nPAIRC WINNER\nThe Republic of Ireland Women beat Slovenia 1-0 at Pairc Ui Chaoimh in Cork last week, but it wasn’t enough to gain automatic promotion to the Nations League Group A as Slovenia top the group with a superior goal difference. The winning goal at the famous GAA grounds on the banks of the River Lee was scored by local star Saoirse Noonan, a former Gaelic footballer with Nemo Rangers and Cork. The Girls in Green now have a promotion play-off against Belgium, while Northern Ireland, who are also in the play-offs in October, will play Iceland.\nMeanwhile Arsenal and Republic of Ireland star Katie McCabe has confirmed she will not travel to the United States with the Irish squad for their two international friendlies against the USA in Commerce City, Colo., on June 26 and in Cincinnati, Ohio on June 29. She is taking a well-deserved break following a grueling campaign with both Arsenal and the Irish team. The 29-year-old Dubliner ended the club season as a Champions League winner but says the physical and mental demands of the last two years have taken a significant toll. Ireland’s disappointing exit in the Euro 2025 play-offs last December, followed by managerial upheaval and a lack of clear leadership at the FAI, only exacerbated the strain. McCabe said: “It hurt coming into the most recent camp. there was so much change, so much noise around the FAI and us as a team. And ultimately it affected me because we didn’t get to a tournament. I know we are footballers, but we’re also human and when you are striving towards something that you crave so much as a team but then don’t achieve, it takes its toll on you.’’ McCabe added that the players have reviewed the failed campaign amongst themselves. Several senior figures have retired and Ireland’s performances in the current Nations League B campaign have been inconsistent. Despite this, McCabe insists the squad must look forward. “There comes a time when you have to move past it. Just go, Okay, that happened. Let’s just see how we can improve now going forward,’’ she added.\nLANCASTER IS NEW\nBOSS IN CONNACHT\nFormer Leinster and England Coach Stuart Lancaster was last week confirmed as Connacht’s new Head Coach. The 55-year-old who was most recently coaching Racing 92 in France, has signed a two-year deal. He takes over from Pete Wilkins who stepped down in April. Lancaster, who hails from Penrith in Cumberland, will take up the role in time for the beginning of pre-season training in July. He said: “I’m hugely excited to be joining Connacht Rugby and begin this new chapter of my life in the West of Ireland with my wife Nina. Connacht is a club with a proud identity, a passionate supporter base, and enormous potential both on and off the field, so I’m honoured and humbled to be given the opportunity to lead the Professional Men’s team programme.’’ Lancaster arrival should ensure full houses at the Dexcom Stadium (formerly The Sportsgound) next season. The official opening the revamped Dexcom Stadium is expected to happen prior to Connacht’s URC game against Leinster in Jan. 2026.\nCASEY IS IRISH\nTOUR SKIPPER\nMunster scrum half Craig Casey will captain Ireland for their summer tour of Georgia and Portugal, while there are 11 uncapped players named in the squad. Interim head coach Paul O'Connell has named a 32-man squad for the Tests against Georgia in Tbilisi on July 5 and Portugal in Lisbon on July 12. Casey will become the 112th player to captain his country. Alex Kendellen, Darragh Murray, Paddy McCarthy, Stephen Smyth and Hugh Gavin have been called up for the first time, while Tom Ahern, Michael Milne, Shayne Bolton, Nathan Doak, Ben Murphy and Tommy O'Brien will look for their first caps having previously trained with the senior squad. After recently returning from long-term injuries, Ulster forwards Iain Henderson and Rob Herring were not considered for selection to allow them to focus on a full pre-season programme, while Leinster centre Robbie Henshaw was not available due to injury.\nGOVT MUST DELIVER\nON CASEMENT: O’NEILL\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Michelle O’Neill has said the British government must deliver on its commitment to provide substantial funding to help rebuild Casement Park, the home of Antrim GAA, in west Belfast. British Chancellor Rachel Reeves is due to announce a comprehensive spending review today and it’s viewed as a pivotal moment for the plan to redevelop the stadium. The project has an estimated cost of £250m and just under half is already in place, with the Irish government pledging around £43m the Stormont Executive £62.5m and the GAA £15m. Ms O'Neill and her Sinn Féin colleague, north Belfast MP John Finucane, met the Northern Ireland Secretary of State in Belfast last week. Afterwards, Ms O'Neill said she had stressed the political significance of the project going ahead as well as what she said would be huge economic benefits.\nKELLEHER PAYOUT\nFOR RINGMAHON\nCork junior club Ringmahon Rangers are in line for a reported €3million payday after their former goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher joined Brentford from Liverpool last week. Kelleher came up through the age grades at Ringmahon and eventually lined out for their senior team before making the move to Liverpool in 2015. The Cork club are understood to have agreed a 20 per cent sell-on fee with Liverpool when Kelleher moved to Merseyside and are now set for a windfall payment. Kelleher joined the Bees last week for an initial €16million, potentially rising to €21.3million with add-on fees, Ringmahon are set to receive what would be the largest ever sell-on payment received by an Irish club. That payment would eclipse the €2million Shamrock Rovers got from Gavin Bazunu’s move from Manchester City to Southampton. So two goalkeepers providing big payments for their former clubs.\nKelleher, who has secured a five-year contract with the London club, said the decision to leave Anfield was easy for him, saying: ‘‘I don’t think it was very difficult for me to leave Liverpool. I felt for my own career that the time was right for me to go, to be a No. 1 and play every week. I heard of some interest a few weeks back. Once I knew Brentford was in for me, it was definitely one I was really excited about and wanted to get it done as quickly as possible.’’ Kelleher also said that he consulted with Irish colleague Nathan Collins, who is currently playing for The Bees, before making his mind up.\nSCANNELL TO QUIT\nAFTER 12 YEARS\nMunster have confirmed the departure of centre Rory Scannell, the latest vastly experienced player who will leave Thomond Park this summer. The centre’s departure had been expected at the end of the season, with Munster captain Tadhg Beirne hinting as much following the recent URC quarter-final defeat to the Sharks. It was a cruel way for the 31-year-old to sign off on his Munster career, as he missed one of his two place-kicks in the shootout defeat in Durban, on what was his 200th appearance for the province. Scannell said: ‘‘It's a huge honor to have played for my home club 200 times, particularly alongside my brother Niall. It’s been a rollercoaster of ups and downs over the last 12 years, but I have made so many great memories that will live with me forever. I have met some great people here and made friends for life.’’",
