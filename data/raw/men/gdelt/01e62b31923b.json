In fact, it can be argued that things became much worse.\nUnited couldn’t buy a win in the Premier League, regularly falling short as their rivals continued to get the better of them. The Red Devils appeared unable to cope with the physical and technical demands of the top flight, and the results showed this.\nAmorim and his players ended up finishing a lowly 15th place, having suffered 18 defeats all term. Nine of these came at home.\nThe heartbreak deepened when United were beaten by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final, squandering their last chance to secure Champions League football through the back door.\nAfter the final whistle on the last day of the Premier League season, which saw United claim an unexpected victory over Unai Emery’s Aston Villa, Amorim addressed supporters at Old Trafford and emphasised that the worst is already behind and that the future is looking more promising.\nSo far in pre-season, the signs have been encouraging and there is a feeling of positivity and optimism heading into 2025/26. The Telegraph’s James Ducker, who has been observing the team in the United States has revealed that it’s crystal clear Amorim is making changes not only on the pitch, but also off it.\nAmorim changing the culture at United\nDucker notes that the squad now appears more united and tightly-knit than ever. Luke Shaw recently echoed this sentiment, describing the current group as the closest he’s seen since joining United.\nBruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha are given as examples. The duo have already formed a strong connection, which has been clear to see. That chemistry is starting to show on the pitch as well, with the pair posing a real threat in the 2-1 victory over West Ham.\nIt’s understood that Amorim is eager to have a team where everyone is pulling in the same direction. This could explain why he exiled the ‘bomb squad’ – Marcus Rashford who has since joined Barcelona on loan, Alejandro Garnacho, Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho and Antony.\nOn Amorim’s running United’s pre-season camp and how his approach is different to Ten Hag, Ducker points out, “Given the ground they have to make up, it would not have been a surprise to see Amorim working his players morning and afternoon on the training ground but the Portuguese has actually dialled back the gruelling double sessions that were a fixture on previous tours under Ten Hag.”\n“Guarding against injury may form part of Amorim’s thinking but training has often wrapped by early afternoon, giving players time to unwind, relax and enjoy each other’s company.”\n“The ‘rec room’ complete with table tennis table, basketball hoops and a darts board at the Waldorf Astoria in Chicago where United are based is a couple of floors below where the players are staying at the hotel so has not been as frequented as expected. But the real bonding has evolved more naturally: over meals, in the gym, during trips to the baseball and walks to the Lake Michigan beachfront or around the shops.”\nDucker adds, “Amorim will have usually done his own gym session by the time players begin to file in for breakfast, usually from 7:30am onwards, and the manager’s style has been very much to treat the players as adults. There is structure, yes, but not to the point of suffocation, which contrasts starkly with the strict, prescriptive regime ran by Ten Hag, with fines for lateness and an unbending approach to punctuality and process.”\nAccording to The Telegraph, when last season concluded, each United player was given a tailored fitness programme to follow during their holidays. Staff have been left impressed by the results and there is a sense that those plans were adhered to.\nAmorim himself has admitted being upbeat by what he has seen in pre-season and hopefully, it spills over into the competitive campaign.\nMeanwhile, United are back in action on Sunday when they take on Everton in the final game of their Premier Leageue Summer Series.\nFeatured image Patrick McDermott via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
