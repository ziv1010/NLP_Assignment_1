His FC Copenhagen side were drawing 3-3 with Manchester United at Parken, with time draining away. The Danish champions had been riding momentum with a man advantage in front of a feverish home crowd and, when the chance to win the game arrived, Roony punched a shot down into the turf and up into the net.\nRoony's winner ⚽️#UCL pic.twitter.com/oyyFwdpyQL\n— UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) November 10, 2023\n“This kid actually thinks he’s born to score the winner in games like these,” Jacob Neestrup, Copenhagen’s head coach, said after the game.\nAdvertisement\nThe kid thinks he was born for more than just that. “My goal is to become the best footballer in the world,” he said in 2022.\n“Nothing can stop me except myself.”\nFor a player unhelpfully christened the Swedish Messi, Roony, who prefers to be known by his first name, does little to discourage the comparison, nor to ease the expectation that continues to build around him. He turned 18 this week but his talent has been whispered about for years and the Football Manager series has already made him a digital star.\nBut now he is becoming real.\nThe Copenhagen derby is not for the faint-hearted. It’s a blood-and-thunder class war of a game, between two teams from very different parts of the city.\nIn September 2023, FCK travelled to Brondby for the first game of this season and, as ever, walked into a deafening bear pit of a stadium that burned brilliant yellow.\nThey fell behind, too, finding themselves deep in a hole. It was Roony who dug them out, scoring twice to turn a 2-1 defeat into a 3-2 victory. His second goal won the game, but his first was more of a moment — the scoring of it, with a brilliantly-timed run and finish, but the way he celebrated, too, with a skip towards the home stand and then a bow towards it. It was outrageously cocky.\nA year earlier, in the same game and at the same end of the ground, he scored a 98th-minute equaliser. He celebrated in front of the Sydsiden terrace with his arms outstretched and his teammates on his back.\nIs that who he is? The strutting boy king with his first name on the back of shirt? Not really. He wears Roony rather than Bardghji (bard-gah-jee) because he thought it would be easier for people to pronounce. And the strut with which he plays hardly seems true of who he is.\n“Actually, if you talk to him after training, he’s a little bit shy. But he’s very, very polite and always talking about the team.”\nAdvertisement\nKasper Larsen has seen Roony play more than most. FCK’s training ground in Frederiksberg is open to the public and Kasper, who founded the fansite Kvart I bold, is there most days, watching the sessions from the little gallery above the training pitches.\n“I see him train three or four times every week and when the other players go inside, Roony is always on the pitch alone. He’s taking shots, practising his free kicks… just doing everything he can to get better.\n“Every day. Every time. Always, always on the pitch.”\nRoony’s reward is to be the youngest player in FCK’s history. He was playing in the Superliga a week after his 16th birthday, as soon as the league would allow it, and scored in that competition a week after that.\nHe’s a wide forward. One of those sharp-edged players who knifes in from the right, cutting into dangerous positions and terrifying defences with his wicked changes of direction. He has a nose for chances — seven goals already this season — but a sense for where his teammates are, too, and that makes him extremely dangerous.\nAnd desired, by almost every major club in Europe. His future will be fascinating.\n“FC Copenhagen have developed quite an expansive and incisive method of playing, which serves them well in Denmark, but also troubles big European sides,” a Premier League scout tells The Athletic, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not cleared to speak publicly on the player.\n“That movement suits Bardghji, too. I see him as someone who is going to be good in tight spaces, especially as runners go beyond him and give him the opportunity to get his end product away.”\nThe Swedish Messi? Weighty comparisons crush fragile careers. Roony is a comparable player in style. It’s hardly surprising because he has tried to mimic many of his dribbling traits and tendencies. But he is not as overwhelming. Not as quick, not as explosive.\nNot yet, at least.\nAdvertisement\n“He’s going to have to be a big fish in a small pond at first,” says the scout, “and that will limit where he can go. He’s not the most athletic player, so it will be about finding the right style and shape. Perhaps a narrow right-side role in a 4-3-3, which would provide plenty of cover behind and doesn’t demand that he cover great distances.”\nLarsen agrees that there is work to do.\n“His defending can be much better. But he’s young. And he’s not that fast and I think in modern football you need to be fast. But he has a lot of potential and I don’t think we’ve even seen half of it. He certainly has the mentality.”\nYes, he does. Healthy ego, good arrogance; traits of players who go a long way. With Roony it seems more self-belief than entitlement, though, and the benefit of being consistently elevated as a youth player. He played for FCK’s under-19s when he was 15 and alongside future Manchester United forward Rasmus Hojlund, who is almost three years older than him.\nHis progress has not always been serene. With each new age group attained, the speed of the game around him has quickened. For skilful players who like to hold the ball and flash their feet, that can be difficult. But while the adjustments have not been automatic, the challenges have been consistently defeated — by hard work and the resolve of someone who seems ready for whatever comes next.\n“Ahead of that Champions League game,” says Kasper, “a lot of players would think, ‘Wow, I’m going to play against Manchester United!’\n“Roony just says: ‘Give me the ball, I will handle it.’”\nIt makes him an unusual player. He has taken an unusual route, too.\nRoony’s parents met in Aleppo, Syria, but he was born in Kuwait City, where his father moved for work. His footballing education started when he was three years old but without any formality. He never played for a Kuwaiti club or team. Instead, his early experiences were with his father, on a neighbourhood pitch. Just the two of them and a bag of balls, day after day. Roony’s father is a Manchester United fan. He has a younger brother, Rayan, who is named after a former great, too. But pictures of the time show a different influence: they capture him as a tiny boy, dressed in a Barcelona shirt and standing over an Adidas Jabulani ball that came up to his knees.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2012, with his father remaining in Kuwait, Roony, six by then, moved to Sweden with his mother and younger brother. The family settled in a small apartment in Kallinge, on the country’s south coast and again, as in Kuwait City, his front door opened onto local football pitches. And there, under the shadow of high-rises and on fields to which the neighbourhood would flock — to socialise, to grill food, or to play football — he would assimilate.\nHe learnt Swedish by playing on those pitches. He became the player most of Europe is now chasing there, too. Coaches who have worked with Roony say he is not really an academy product. He may have learnt tactics and disciplines within institutionalised football, but he has not been bolted together and built step by step. Instead, he is self-made, with an archetype forged by his environment, and decorated by what he has seen great players do and learnt to copy.\nPlaying on those neighbourhood pitches took him to a trial at Kallinge SK, his local club. In 2015, he moved to Rodeby AIK, in Blekinge, 30km to the east, and while there he experienced the kind of moment that so many successful careers call back to.\nAt that year’s Audi KB youth tournament in Copenhagen, Rodeby’s P05 side won a bronze medal, despite competition from some of the biggest academies in the region. To this day, there is still a page on the Rodeby website congratulating the team on their medal and Roony can be seen crouching in the front row, first from the left.\nMost players have that origin story. In his case, those performances — which are still on YouTube — remain vivid. In 2022, FC Copenhagen released an in-house documentary, 372 Dage, that chronicled his progress from signing his first contract to making his first-team debut. One of the first scenes shows the Bardghji family and FC Copenhagen officials gathered around a boardroom table, with a contract ready to be signed. Even then, Mikkel Kohler, head of scouting and recruitment for the club’s academy, was talking about the Audi Cup and the teams a 12-year-old Roony had torn apart.\n“We became aware,” Kohler later says to camera, “that 400km away in Sweden, there was a really special player.”\nRoony moved to FCK in 2020, having spent a year at Malmo. Even after the move, he and his family continued to live in Sweden. He would get up at 5am, leave home at 6am, and then take a train across the Oresund Bridge to attend school in Denmark, before training in Copenhagen. They were long days, but necessary ones. The standard of domestic Danish football is higher and FC Copenhagen’s academy is considered to be among the very best in the region. It was a change that brought challenges, but one which he and his family thought necessary.\nAt Malmo, though, there is evidently still regret that Roony felt it necessary to leave.\nAdvertisement\nDaniel Kristofferson covers Swedish football and the Swedish national team for Aftonbladet, one of the country’s biggest daily newspapers.\n“Many Malmo supporters were surprised,” he tells The Athletic. “Roony was one of the best players they have seen in the academy and I know that Daniel Andersson, the sporting director, was very sad that he left for FC Copenhagen.”\nIt has been three years since he left, but the expectation has been growing in Sweden ever since.\n“It’s very big,” says Kristofferson. “If you look at what he has done in Copenhagen already at his age, we are very surprised that he is not in the national team. We think he will have a fantastic career in Europe.”\nSweden did not qualify for Euro 2024. Head coach Janne Andersson will be leaving his position before the end of the year, meaning that with Roony not selected in the current squad and, with no senior international scheduled for six months, the clamour for his inclusion will have the chance to die down.\nNot that it will temper expectation, though. Sweden have only qualified for one of the past four World Cups. When he is eventually called up, Roony will join a squad that lacks the star power of previous generations, and — most likely — be expected to become central to the country’s qualification push for the 2026 tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States. He’s not quite a saviour. Andersson’s successor can already build an attack from Alexander Isak, Dejan Kulusevski and Anthony Elanga. But Roony is potentially the country’s biggest individual star since Zlatan Ibrahimovic, or Henrik Larsson before him.\nCan he handle that kind of expectation?\nHe has handled everything else that the game — and life — has thrown his way and retains a dead-eyed conviction in his ability to succeed. Everybody else probably shares that faith, too.\n(Top photo: Lars Ronbog / FrontZoneSport via Getty Images)",
