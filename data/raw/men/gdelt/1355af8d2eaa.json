  "body_text": "Manchester United bounced back from successive 3-0 home defeats with a 1-0 win at Fulham thanks to a late Bruno Fernandes strike.\nThe win will ease the pressure on manager Erik ten Hag, but the performance wasn’t always entirely convincing, with the likes of Christian Eriksen and Antony struggling to make any discernable impact on the game before being substituted.\nThankfully for United, up stepped the captain in injury time.\nHere, The Athletic’s Carl Anka answers three key questions to arise from the game…\nWhere would United be without Bruno Fernandes?\nRoy Keane wanted Bruno Fernandes stripped of the United captaincy following defeat in the Manchester derby, but the Portuguese playmaker proved the difference six days later.\nAdvertisement\nIt was a scrappy goal that owed a debt to the defensive harrying of Facundo Pellistri and a few fortunate deflections, but Fernandes’ effort, arced low and hard and in the corner, was enough to win a scrappy game. Few other United players have moments like that in their locker, especially in the perilous final moments of a game.\nFernandes was far from his best against Fulham but – restored to his best position as the No 10 – offered some of the penetrative passing and movement that has made him so important in recent seasons. This 1-0 win was his 200th appearance in a United shirt. He is an unconventional attacking midfielder, who plays football as if he is constantly running downhill, but his energetic stylings helped paper over the cracks of an otherwise poor team performance.\nThe Fulham crowd did not take too kindly to Fernandes’ presence on Saturday, singing “He looks like a rat”.\nWhen the full-time whistle blew, the United captain had the last laugh.\nWhat is a ‘subjective offside’?\nAnother weekend of Premier League fixtures, another weekend of picking apart controversial/confusing refereeing decisions.\nManchester United thought they had gone a goal up in the eighth minute, after Scott McTominay capped off a clever free-kick routine started by Christian Eriksen.\nInitial replays suggested it would be a tight call but that Alejandro Garnacho – who provided the assist – was a fraction onside, only for lengthy VAR check to still chalk the goal off.\nIt fell to VAR official Jarred Gillett to inform referee John Brooks that Harry Maguire was interfering with Fulham’s defenders from an offside position before the ball reached Garnacho.\nThe phase of play was judged to have been a “subjective offside” and the goal was not given. The correct decision, according to the rule book? Yes, but it was also the sort of decision that more than one Premier League referee has let slide in the past.\nAdvertisement\nShould VAR be allowed to pass subjective judgment, when it was promoted as offering help with the objective “clear and obvious” issues? Your judgment may vary…\nWas it right for Maguire to play on…?\nWithin the first 30 seconds of kick-off, Harry Maguire’s head collided with the shoulder of Fulham’s Rodrigo Muniz. It all seemed innocuous enough for a few moments until Maguire misplaced an easy five-yard pass out of play and fell to his knees.\nThe centre-back was checked over for a possible concussion before continuing the game.\nMaguire ultimately lasted the rest of the match, but looked noticeably off-colour in several moments, despite an overall solid performance. One phase of play saw Maguire one-v-one against Willian on the right-hand side, only for him to repeatedly point at the winger as if another defender was supposed to step across and help him.\nA little past the hour mark, Maguire again looked groggy and took a pause after a free kick, leading to referee John Brooks to tell him to leave the pitch and get further treatment. But still no substitution.\nMaguire made three clearances at Craven Cottage – all of which were with his head. At a time when players, coaches and match officials are meant to be taking concussion protocol more seriously, it’ll be interesting to see how much the 30-year-old remembers of the game.\nWhat did Erik ten Hag say after the game?\nTen Hag hit back at critics of captain Bruno Fernandes after Saturday’s win, saying he is “immensely important for us”.\n“I don’t understand it (the criticism),” he said to TNT Sport. “Everyone makes mistakes and no one is perfect, but he does very good things.\n“He shows every time that he is an example as a captain. You saw today his work, his pressing, and he scored, so he’s immensely important for us.”\nWhat next for Manchester United?\nWednesday November 8: Copenhagen (A), Champions League group A, 8pm GMT, 3pm ET\nAdvertisement\nUnited travel to Denmark to play their fourth group stage game having won only one of their opening three matches, losing two on the bounce before beating Copenhagen at Old Trafford thanks to Andre Onana’s injury-time penalty save. United are third in the group on three points, one behind Galatasaray, who play group leaders (on nine points) Bayern Munich.\nSaturday November 11: Luton Town (H), Premier League, 3pm GMT, 10am ET\nUnited will then face Luton Town for the first time in a league fixtures since April 1992, when Lee Sharpe scored in a 1-1 draw at Kenilworth Road.\nRecommended reading\n- Erik ten Hag’s future at Manchester United: What we’re hearing\n- Sir Jim Ratcliffe prepared to invest $300m for Manchester United infrastructure upgrades\n- Manchester United’s Adidas kit issues explained – from Andre Onana’s jersey to devil logo stitching\n- Why Manchester United are playing so poorly\n(Photo: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images)",
