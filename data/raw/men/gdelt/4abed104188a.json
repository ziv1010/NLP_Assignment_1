This season, the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League have switched from a traditional 32-team group stage to a singular 36-team league phase. In this new format, every goal and every point truly counts.\nLiverpool ended the league phase as the top-placed team with with 21 points in eight matches. While the Reds’ form across all competitions this season has been impressive, several clubs are also strong contenders for the Champions League crown, including Barcelona, Arsenal, Inter Milan, PSG, Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid.\nThe question on everyone’s mind is, “Will Liverpool win the Champions League this season?” The manner in which they cruised through the new-look league phase suggests so.\nWhy Liverpool Could Win the 2024/25 Champions League\nOver the years, Liverpool have often been excellent across all competitions. but the team has been exceptional this season. They are not only on top of the Champions League table but also in the Premier League.

At the forefront, Mo Salah’s contribution to the team this season has been incredible. The 32-year-old has already reached seven goal contributions in the Champions League this term and more than 40 in all competitions, making him one of the best wingers in the world.\nMeanwhile, Virgil van Dijk has captained the team excellently and held the defence together, often preventing Liverpool from conceding goals. Other players who’ve also excelled in Europe during the current campaign include Luis Diaz, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Cody Gakpo and Ryan Gravenberch.\nTactical Approach\nTactics are the foundation of success in any sport, and football is no exception. Under Slot’s leadership, Liverpool have developed a strategy which combines high pressing, organised ball possession and solid defence.\nWhile playing, it is important to analyse, calculate risks and adapt to the situation. Fans of gambling know that before playing for real, it’s useful to test strategies – for example, by trying out demo versions of slots at slotozilla.com. This approach helps to better understand the mechanics of the game and develop your own tactics.\nUnder Slot, Liverpool have adopted a more structured tactical approach focusing on high pressure, structured build-up play and a defensive block. This aggressive pressing tactic allows the players to leverage their opponent’s weaknesses and score plenty of goals.\nChampions League Form\nLiverpool finished the group stage top of the table, although a 3-2 defeat to PSV Eindhoven in their final match ended their perfect record. Slot rested key players like Salah and Van Dijk, giving some academy graduates first-team opportunities.\nDespite that loss, the team’s overall performance in the group stage was commendable, earning them automatic qualification for the round of 16. Liverpool had one of the best scoring records this season, and their matches often rank among the highest-scoring.\nPotential Challenges to Liverpool’s Champions League Campaign\nLiverpool have been one of the strongest teams in the 2024/25 Champions League, but their path to the trophy is far from easy. While their attacking power and tactical discipline under Slot makes them contenders, several challenges could hinder their journey.

Over the years, Los Blancos have taken pride in conquering other teams in knockout stages and finals, making them a fearsome opponent even when the odds seem firmly stacked against them.\nInjuries and Fatigue\nLiverpool’s success across all competitions relies on their key players. So far, the Reds’ medical team has prioritised fitness and effective healthcare to ensure that players are fit to play and unleash their best skills on the field. Hence, an injury to any key player could lead to a decline in the team’s overall performance and weaken their chances of winning the Champions League.\nPressure From Fans\nFootball goes beyond running on a pitch for 90 minutes, as players are under pressure from fans to achieve the best results. After delivering such stellar performances in the league phase of the tournament, Liverpool fans and board members have increased their expectations for the knockout rounds.\nWhile these expectations can boost the squad’s morale, they could also lead to psychological pressure, ultimately affecting their performance.\nAway Form in Big Games\nHistorically, Liverpool have thrived on their home advantage at Anfield, but their away performances in Europe have sometimes been inconsistent. Playing in intimidating stadia like the Bernabéu or Allianz Arena can be a challenge, and any slip-ups away from home could cost them dearly in the knockout rounds.\nConclusion\nWith all eyes on the Champions League prize, Liverpool have displayed resilience and brilliance. Thanks to Slot’s leadership and flair, the team brings an aggressive tactical approach, making them a formidable opponent for anyone in Europe.\nAs we’ve analysed, different factors could affect the Reds’ chances of winning the Champions League, but for now they remain many fans’ favourites to win the trophy. having excelled in not just the league phase of this tournament but across all competitions this season.
