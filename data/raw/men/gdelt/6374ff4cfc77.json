It means a lot with it being with my boyhood team as I’ve grown up loving the club and it’s so surreal that I’m officially a professional footballer for the club.\n“My footballing journey started seven years ago and it’s been absolutely incredible. I don’t have any regrets and, so far, I’ve made the most of the opportunities I’ve been given. There’s been low points in my career but they’ve taught me more than the highs ever could so I’m grateful for both.\n“To make my first-team debut for Newcastle in Australia was something I’ll remember forever. It was a great experience and I learnt a lot from the 30 minutes I played. The whole trip was brilliant and I made a lot of memories along the way. To progress through to the first-team is the long-term goal and it’s one I’ll strive towards non-stop during my time at the Academy and watching goalkeepers such as Tim Krul, Freddie Woodman and Fraser Forster has inspired me to do the same.”\nCharlton is a defender who plays primarily as a left-back and made his Magpies first-team debut during a post-season friendly against Tottenham Hotspur in front of over 78,000 spectators at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in May 2024.\nThe Gateshead-born full-back, who joined United’s Academy in 2013, is hoping to follow in the footsteps of Paul Dummett, who made over 200 competitive appearances for the Magpies after progressing through their youth ranks.\nThe former Heworth Grange pupil said: “I’m delighted to sign my first professional contract. It’s very special being a local lad from the area. Being a left-back, seeing Dummett progress through the ranks is inspiring to what I want to do after starting off young in the Academy then ultimately getting into the first-team as well as a lot of other local lads.\n“My footballing journey was mostly enjoying my football during the younger age groups and gaining an extended one or two-year contract at the end of the season which has led to securing a professional deal.\n“It was dream come true to make my first-team debut out in Australia and it was even better to get my first senior start (against the A-League All Stars).”\nMunda is a midfielder who joined Newcastle’s Academy from Newcastle City Juniors as a nine-year-old in 2012.\nThe Cowgate-born teenager, a representative of England at under-18 level, scored his first goal at under-21 level in a 2-2 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League 2 and is hoping to kick on from his positive displays with United’s second-string last term.\nThe 17-year-old added: “I was pleased with my season, making my debut for England and being able to play games for Newcastle’s under-21s. I got an injury towards the end of the season which was unfortunate but, now, it’s about looking forward to the season ahead.\n“It’s a big moment for me and my family to sign my first professional contract as it’s something I’ve been working towards since I was young and coming through the ranks at the Academy. My family have sacrificed a lot for me in order to get me this far in my career so to finally earn my first pro deal is a proud moment for all of us.\n“It’s great seeing Lewis Miley making that jump into the first-team as he’s someone I’ve played with coming through the club’s Academy. Seeing him make that jump gives me motivation that I can follow in his footsteps and break through myself.”\nHarry Powell is a defender who, like twin brother Rory, joined Newcastle’s Academy after playing for Red House Farm and Gateshead FC Juniors.\nThe former Ponteland High School pupil, who made his under-21s debut during a Premier League 2 clash against rivals Sunderland in March 2023, is keen for himself and his identical sibling to continue their rise through the club’s youth system.\nHe said: “I have an immense amount of pride playing for my boyhood club with my brother. It’s a very special thing for the both of us to be at this level together and it’s a great feeling for our families.\n“I’m very pleased to have signed my first professional contract as it’s always been a dream for me to do so and doing it with my boyhood club is a very special feeling for myself and my family to have achieved.\n“I’m very much looking forward to stepping into under-21s football because it’s another step to challenge myself and another jump towards potential first-team football.”\nRory Powell is a versatile defender who was on target during Newcastle’s 7-2 thrashing of Leyton Orient in last season’s FA Youth Cup third round and is hopeful he and his identical twin, unidentifiable at times to their teammates and staff, can emulate the footsteps of the Longstaff and Amoebi brothers and both feature at first-team level.\n“The staff still find it difficult to tell us apart. They just guess who is who,” he explained.\n“I’m very much looking forward to it after signing my first professional contract at the club I’ve grown up supporting. Signing my first pro deal with Newcastle is one thing but to do it with my twin brother is very special and just shows the amount of work we have put in together to get here.”\nEmerson, a winger who plays primarily on the left flank, scored the winning goal in Newcastle’s 2-1 win against Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Youth League last term, the club’s first ever victory in the competition’s history.\nThe Carlisle-born youngster, a representative of Scotland at under-18 and under-19 level, made his under-21s debut at the age of 16 and reflected on featuring against the likes of AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund and PSG for the Magpies’ under-19s side.\nThe 18-year-old said: “Playing in the UEFA Youth League was very valuable experience for me. It gave me a taster of playing on a big stage with more pressure and fans and I loved it. I thought it improved me massively as a player and, mentally, being able to deal with those types of games. I enjoyed testing myself against some of the best players in the world at my age group to see where I was at as a player and that’s the only way to improve so I enjoyed the level of competition.\n“Signing my first professional contract is a dream for me. My whole life, from the day I was born, has been 100% football so it’s very special for me because it’s something me and my family have worked towards and do it with such a massive club like Newcastle is an honour, especially with the way the club is going.\n“Being at the Academy since 2019, and first coming on trial, I think it was quite different from starting at a boys club in Carlisle called Northbank to then moving to play in Scotland for Annan and Queen of the South and then coming to Newcastle, having my parents drive me an hour four to five times a week from Brampton. I think it’s all helped me to be the player and person I am today.\n“Seeing people who have progressed through to the first-team from the Academy like Lewis Miley and Joe White has been very inspiring because it shows it’s possible and the pathway is there if I do all the right things. The goal is to try and and follow a similar pathway as Lewis because, ultimately, he’s living our dreams by playing in the Premier League and Champions League.”\nNeave is a striker who scored 13 goals across all competitions for United’s under-18 side last term, including 11 strikes in the Under-18 Premier League North and made his under-21s debut during an EFL Trophy clash against League Two Crewe Alexandra last year.\nA representative of England at under-17 level, the former Wallsend Boys Club product is hoping to continue his bright goalscoring form at second-string level after an eye-catching campaign in front of goal for United’s under-18s side.\n“I’m really happy about signing my first professional contract with the club,” he said. “Ever since I was young, it’s been my dream to play for Newcastle United so to sign a professional deal here is surreal.\n“I was really pleased to make my debut for the under-21s as it means next year, I can push on and try to make a few more appearances and hopefully score a few goals. Making my international debut was a really proud moment for me and my family. Playing for your country is one of the biggest things in football and I’m hoping that, next season, I can gain more appearances for England.\n“I’m more than happy about my goals this season at under-18 level and I was really pleased to be the top goalscorer at the club. I’m hoping I can push on, score a few more next season and be up there with the top goalscorers in the league.”\nBailey is a box-to-box midfielder who joined Newcastle’s Academy as a nine-year-old and is relishing a competitive debut at under-21 level.\nThe Durham-born youngster, who was also on target in United’s 2-1 win against PSG in the UEFA Youth League, said: “I am really excited to move into under-21s football and I’m going to try and hit the ground running straight away in the Premier League 2 and try to finish in a good position in the table.\n“After all the hard work I’ve put in, I’m really pleased to be getting my first professional contract and especially at Newcastle, a club I’ve been at for so long.\n“My journey has been full of ups and downs and I’ve had to work harder than ever to get my first contract and I’m so happy to have, finally, been offered the pro contract due to that work.”\nDonaldson, who hails from Gateshead, turned out for Washington Boys Club before joining his boyhood club in 2019.\nThe teenage centre-forward scored on his under-21s debut during a Premier League Cup group encounter against Huddersfield Town at the John Smith’s Stadium and is keen to create further memories with United’s second-string.\nHe said: “My debut against Huddersfield was a good taste of under-21s football, especially with their team being much older than I am and scoring at their stadium was a great feeling.\n“Signing my first professional contract is the proudest moment of my life so far and doing it at the club me and my family have grown up supporting makes it even better.\n“Seeing a few of the lads making their first-team debuts last season inspires me because it shows that the club is providing a strong pathway for us young players to try and play for the first-team and that the opportunities are there.”\nHarrison is a goalkeeper who played at Ponteland and Gosforth Boys Clubs before arriving at United’s Academy at the age of 13 and was named on the bench for Newcastle’s UEFA Champions League Group F visit of AC Milan in December.\nAwaiting his under-21s bow, the 17-year-old ‘keeper said: “When I found out I was going to be in the squad for one of Newcastle’s biggest games in many years, I didn’t think it was real at first.\n“To be involved in one of the biggest tournaments in football was an amazing step in my career. I gained a lot of experience during that game, walking out in front of 52,000 fans and being around top class players I watched and looked up to as a kid. I learnt a lot from the game and took home many special memories I will always look back on.\n“I was over the moon when I found out I was offered a professional contract. To do it with the team me and my family have have always supported and seeing where the club is going, it’s is a once in a lifetime opportunity which I am very grateful for.\n“Looking towards next season, I’m excited for the challenges of playing professional football and the challenges that holds. I’m always looking for ways to progress myself and stepping into a new environment at under-21 level will help me improve.”\nPalmer is a versatile midfielder who is keen to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Lewis Miley and Sean Longstaff who made the step from Academy to first-team football in recent years.\nThe 18-year-old said: “I’m really pleased to be signing my first professional contract with Newcastle United. Being a local lad makes it extra special. Since the takeover, the city has been vibrant and excited about the future. I’m looking forward to being a part of that.\n“I would like to say it’s been easy but it’s extremely hard work and full of ups and downs. It’s worth all of those sacrifices in the end and it’s made me even stronger and more resilient.\n“Playing alongside Lewis Miley for six years and watching how well he’s done gives me the confidence to know that I can make that next step. I admire the longevity of Sean Longstaff and it would be great to emulate him.”\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
