  "body_text": "Hello and welcome to today's Arsenal live blog on Monday, January 2, 2023.\nArsenal have had the perfect start going into 2023 following the Gunners' 4-2 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday. This was made even sweeter after both Spurs and Chelsea dropped points on New Year's Day.\nToday is the second day of the January transfer window and clubs are now open to complete transfers ahead of the second half of the season. For Arsenal, a new bid for Mykhaylo Mudryk is expected to be offered after an initial offer of £55million including add-ons was rejected by Shakhtar Donetsk, while Youri Tielemans continues to be linked with a move.\nWith that said, stay tuned as we bring you all the latest news from north London.\nJesus injury boost\nJesus provided Arsenal fans with an update that could spell positive news for the Gunners. The Brazilian took to Instagram to provide an update.\nHe released an Instagram story where he is seen throwing his crutches away and captioning the post ‘Freedom Sang’, which highlights he no longer needs support during his recovery from the knee injury.\nNdicka blow\nArsenal have been linked to the Eintracht Frankfurt defender but according to German outlet BILD, Newcastle are also interested in signing Ndicka at the end of the season, while the player has also been linked with a move to Anfield.\nThe Frenchman’s contract is set to expire at the end of the 2022/2023 season, which means that the Gunners can sign him on a cut-price deal in January or on a pre-contract for a free transfer for him to join at the end of campaign. The Daily Express have quoted the defender to cost around £7million for a January deal.\nHowever, the Gunners have potentially received a blow in securing a deal as Bild have continued to report that Frankfurt has offered to extend Ndicka’s for a further three years into 2026, which would end Arsenal’s free transfer hopes.\nArsenal's 2023 'mission'\nMikel Arteta will undoubtedly have a number of wishes for 2023 and at the top of that will likely be the Premier League title.\nThe signing of Mykhaylo Mudryk will be a short-term priority for Arteta and technical director Edu, as well proposed moves in the summer for Youri Tielemans and Evan Ndicka.\nHowever, there are many 2023 plans that will be a huge boost for the Gunners in the long-term and high up on that list will be renewing contracts.\nFabrizio Romano has revealed on his YouTube channel that agreeing new deals for William Saliba, Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka and Charlie Patino is one of the missions of 2023.\nGabriel Jesus injury update\nArsenal star Gabriel Jesus has given a huge update on his rehabilitation from a knee injury suffered at the World Cup.\nThe Brazilian forward underwent surgery to repair the damage and has been keen to give Arsenal supporters a number of updates as he continues his recovery.\nThe 25-year-old has now given another update and this one appears to be quite significant. Posting on his Instagram story showing an image of his crutches with the caption 'liberdade cantou' which translates roughly to 'freedom sang', which seems to indicate the crutches will be no longer needed for Jesus.\nHowe encourages Newcastle to enjoy Arsenal challenge\nNewcastle manager Eddie Howe has urged his players to relish the situation they find themselves in as they prepare to take on Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on Tuesday evening.\nThe Magpies sit third in the Premier League table, nine points behind the Gunners, and could close the gap with a victory against Mikel Arteta's side. Ahead of another tough task, Howe has told his players exactly how they should be approaching the fixture.\nAhead of the game, he said: \"For me, the players shouldn't feel burdened by expectation, or any of those types of emotions. They should be relishing the place we're in and enjoying every second, as long as they continue to be united and give everything to continue to achieve consistent results.\"\nArsenal target Ligue 1 youngster\nArsenal have been following Montpellier striker Elye Wahi for Several months now and intensified their interest recently according to various reports.\nArsenal suffer Ndicka blow\nEintracht Frankfurt star Evan Ndicka looked to have 'reached an agreement' to join Arsenal upon the expiry of his contract in the summer of 2023.\nHowever, according to Get German Football News the German club have now offered their left-footed French defender a new contract with a lucrative wage offer which could make him, along with Daichi Kamada, one of the highest-paid players at the club.\nMudryk improved fee revealed\nArsenal look to have submitted an improved offer for Mykhaylo Mudryk after their £55million package was swiftly rejected by Shakhtar at the end of 2022.\nCBS' Ben Jacobs has now revealed the latest figures being sent over by the Gunners which includes a note on how much the Ukrainian club want to receive.\nArteta given boost ahead of Newcastle test\nArsenal extended their lead at the top of the Premier League table with a 4-2 win against Brighton on New Year's Eve. The Gunners moved seven points clear at the summit as reigning champions Manchester City dropped points as they drew against Everton.\nNewcastle, who face Arsenal next, have found themselves embroiled in a battle to stay inside the top four and currently sit just nine points behind Arsenal. The Magpies have amassed 34 points in their opening 17 fixtures, a huge improvement compared to last term when Eddie Howe took charge at St. James' Park with the club facing relegation.\nAhead of the match, Howe has delivered the latest updates on who could be available for the game with Arsenal receiving a boost as key players are set to be absent\nRead the full story here\nArsenal make next Mudryk transfer bid\nArsenal have made an improved bid for Shakhtar Donetsk star Mykhaylo Mudryk after seeing their £55million including add-ons rejected last week.\nThe new year arriving also looks set to see a new bid coming from the Gunners for their main January transfer window priority, with Ukrainian journalist Yehor Danylov revealing that Shakhtar are considering Arsenal's improved offer.\nArsenal improve Mykhaylo Mudryk transfer bid\nArsenal have submitted an improved offer for Shakhtar Donetsk star Mykhaylo Mudryk, as reported by Yehor Danylov for Sports Arena.\nChelsea are also interested in Mudryk and are ready to hijack a deal should his proposed move to the Gunners collapses.\nArsenal have improved their proposal to sign Mykhaylo Mudryk, confirmed — as talks are on after €40m plus €20m bid rejected. #AFC\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 2, 2023\nIt’s up to Shakhtar now, as @yehor__d reported.\nChelsea, also interested in Mudryk in case Arsenal deal collapses. #AFC remain priority. pic.twitter.com/YBYWFSlZSy\nSaliba makes Premier League title claim\nArsenal defender William Saliba has revealed his aim for the end of the 2022/23 campaign and Gunners fans will love it. Mikel Arteta has led his players to the top of the Premier League table heading into the new year as they prepare to face Newcastle next.\nSaliba returned to the Emirates Stadium last summer after spending his first three seasons as an Arsenal player out on loan. The French defender spent last term on-loan at Marseille, winning the Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year award, before carrying on his brilliant form into his first full season with the Gunners.\nRead the full story here\nArsenal can repeat Martin Odegaard transfer trick\nArsenal are seeing the best of Martin Odegaard this season after he signed permanently from Real Madrid in 2021. The Norwegian playmaker was handed the club captaincy at the start of the 2022/23 campaign and has led the Gunners to the top of the Premier League table.\nOdegaard has scored seven goals and provided a further five assists in 21 appearances so far this term, the same number of goals and assists he managed in 40 games last season. The 24-year-old's improvement has highlighted Mikel Arteta's ability to develop young talents into better players in a short period of time.\nRead the full story here\nArsenal fans propose crazy Mudryk theory\nShakhtar Donetsk confirmed that Mykhaylo Mudryk and his team-mates were due back to the club in early January 2023, but the Arsenal transfer target may already be in England.\nThe winger posted a workout video to his Instagram and one particularly keen Gunner has performed a deep investigation of the post which may reveal that the 21-year-old is already in the country\nArsenal can compete 'next Erling Haaland' transfer\nArsenal can look to beat their Premier League rivals Manchester United and sign the 'next Erling Haaland'. The Norwegian striker has taken the English top-flight by storm since arriving at Manchester City in the summer.\nHaaland has already notched 30 goal contributions in just 21 appearances for City in all competitions this term, reaching 20 Premier League goals quicker than any other player in history. The Gunners are in need of attacking reinforcements after Gabriel Jesus suffered a knee injury during the World Cup that is set to keep him sidelined until February.\nHowever, the Gunners are keeping tabs on a midfielder from Molde, the Norwegian club where Haaland broke through, who could have a similar explosive impact if he moves to a top five European league, if Haaland's development there is anything to go off.\nRead the full story here\nThe grind never stops for Oleksandr Zinchenko\nArsenal star Oleksandr Zinchenko made his first Arsenal appearance since the World Cup in the Gunners 4-2 win over Brighton.\nDespite not going to the World Cup, with Ukraine beaten by Wales in a qualification game, the versatile left-footer missed all of the preparation games ahead of the season resuming.\nKieran Tierney was slotted in at left-back ahead of Zinchenko for the West Ham clash but the former Man City man returned to the starting XI against the Seagulls.\nJust a few days after the hard-fought win, Zinchenko posted to Instagram celebrating the new year, showing him in the gym despite the quick turnaround in fixtures while others may be recovering.\nSee the post here\nMajor Balogun claim\nArsenal star Folarin Balogun has enjoyed a fruitful loan spell in Ligue 1 playing for Reims where the Hale end grad has scored ten goals in 16 Ligue 1 appearances.\nAccording to CalcioMercato, his impressive form has captured the attention of AC Milan who are on the hunt for a new striker.\nStefano Pioli currently has Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Divock Origi and Olivier Giroud as his attacking options and he is now searching for a young striker and Balogun perfectly fits that mould.\nThe Gunners had the option to recall him from his loan spell but opted to not do so, despite the injury suffered to Gabriel Jesus.\nIt's highly unlikely Arsenal would sanction a move for Balogun, but the potential arrival of another striker could see Balogun as the fourth-choice option once he returns to north London in 2023.\nThe 21-year-old has already proven he can thrive in a foreign league and a move to Serie A, a league which has seen fellow Englishman such as Chris Smalling, Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori thrive, could be tempting for Balogun if he is not considered to be part of Mikel Arteta's plans.\nArsenal take up Saka extension\nArsenal have activated the one-year extension option in Bukayo Saka's contract which now sees his current deal expire in 2024, as football.london understands.\nMikel Arteta and Edu are hopeful of agreeing a new long-term contract for Saka as well as William Saliba and Gabriel Martinelli, but do have short-term backup plans for all three.\nSaka has now joined Saliba in having a one-year extension option activated, while Arsenal hold a two-year option for Martinelli, but it appears new terms for the Brazilian are progressing well.\nSaka has been one of Arsenal's best performers this season and the extra year added on to his contract gives Edu more time to work on negotiating a new deal for the Hale End grad.\nRead more here\nMykhaylo Mudryk drops fresh transfer hint\nThe month of January could be a long one for Arsenal fans as they follow every move of the Mykhaylo Mudryk to Arsenal transfer saga which could be completed in a few weeks.\nArsenal saw their opening £55milion bid, including add-ons, rejected by Shakhtar, however they are expected to return with an improved offer.\nPersonal terms don't appear to be an issue in the slightest with Arsenal reportedly having already 'agreed' the length of his contract and Mudryk himself appears to be preparing for a Premier League move.\nAs a diminutive attacker heading to a league known for it's physicality, Mudryk has posted to his instagram a video of him building up muscle in the gym.\nSee the post here\nA World Cup winner targeted by Arsenal has returned\nFollowing his role in Argentina's World Cup victory, Alexis Mac Allister was given time off to rest and recover ahead of returning to Brighton in the new year.\nA number of Premier League clubs including Arsenal have registered an interest in the Brighton star and he has now returned to the South coast where he was greeted by what appears to be all of of the Brighton squad and staff.\nFirst 2023 arrival 'in the pipeline'\nArsenal look set to help their chances of acheiving Premier League glory in 2023 by completing the signing of Shakhtar Donetsk star Mykhaylo Mudryk in January.\nThe Gunners have 'agreed' a five-year contract with the the 21-year-old and while a fee still needs to be discussed and finalised things seem to be progressing well for Mikel Arteta and Edu.\nArsenal look to have already completed their first deal of the new year though with a pre-contract agreement for Eintracht Frankfurt defender Evan Ndicka.\nThe French defender is out of contract in the summer and according to Calciomercato his move to Arsenal is \"in the pipeline\" and \"expected\" to be completed.\nArsenal extend Bukayo Saka contract\nArsenal have taken up their option to extend Bukayo Saka's contract by a further 12 months to 2024.\nSaka's previous deal, signed in 2020, was an initial three-year agreement but, as expected, Arsenal triggered the additional year before last month's deadline while finalising a longer-term deal for the 21-year-old England winger remains a priority.\nArsenal have activated similar clauses to extend the deals of William Saliba, also to 2024, and young midfielder Charlie Patino to 2025. The Premier League leaders are set to make an improved offer for Shakhtar Donetsk winger Mykhaylo Mudryk, according to The Daily Mail.\nArsenal sent Premier League title warning by Man City star\nManchester City defender Manuel Akanji has issued a Premier League title warning to leaders Arsenal.\nCity dropped two points in their 1-1 draw against Everton as the Gunners extended their points gap to the reigning champions with a win against Brighton.\nSpeaking after the draw to Everton, Akanji said: \"We got one point out of this game, we try to keep putting the pressure on Arsenal and it's still a long season.\n\"We've still got a lot of games to play, it's a busy January that we've got now and we try to win all of our next games.\"\nEdu urged to complete Mykhaylo Mudyrk transfer\nSpeaking to Sky Sports, Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has urged Arsenal to sign Mykhaylo Mudryk. The former Reds defender said: \"Eddie Nketiah has started this second half of the season really well, hasn’t he? I thought losing Gabriel Jesus was going to be a huge blow as I think he’s been outstanding, without scoring the goals.\n\"It’s probably a little bit like Darwin Nunez at Liverpool, who’s playing really well but could do with a few more goals. Nketiah’s form and him getting those goals may just ease Arsenal off in the transfer window.\"\n\"They’re after Mykhaylo Mudryk, when I’ve seen him play in the Champions League, he’s been left wing and Gabriel Martinelli is there right now, he’s been outstanding. Maybe one of them will go through the middle?\n\"If they want to compete with Manchester City – and they are doing that right now but I’m talking about in all competitions and for the next few years like Liverpool have done – you need options from the bench. Mikel Arteta knows that better than anyone from his time at Manchester City and I think Mudryk would be a really exciting signing from what we’ve seen in the Champions League.\"\nArsenal to battle Man Utd for next 'Erling Haaland' transfer\nArsenal and Manchester United are battling to sign the 'next Erling Haaland'.\nThe Gunners and United are both interested in signing 20-year-old Norwegian midfielder Sivert Mannsverk from Molde, according to a report by French outlet Jeunes Footeux.\nThe two Premier League giants are among the clubs keeping tabs on Mannsverk. Molde will demand a Norwegian-record sale worth €10million (£8.8m) to part ways with the young midfield sensation.\nMolde have recently let go of David Datro Fofana to Chelsea and could now be set to lose another talented youngster.\nArsenal suffer transfer blow for Youri Tielemans alternative\nArsenal have been dealt a huge blow in their transfer pursuit of Brighton star Moises Caicedo.\nThe Ecuadorian midfielder has caught the eye of a number of top Premier League clubs this season and it looks like Liverpool have beaten the Gunners to his signing.\n#Liverpool set to reach agreement of €70M with #Brighton HAFC for Moises Caicedo.\n— Olbracht Białas (@AlVeissSport) December 31, 2022\nDeal will be finalised in upcoming days.\nMy exclusive for @SPORTBILD:https://t.co/YGnQa9mjjN\nArsenal face £18.5m obstacle in Joao Felix pursuit\nAccording to The Athletic, Felix's agent, Jorge Mendes, has contacted multiple English clubs to lay out possible terms for a loan until the summer. Initial conversations have focused on a €21million (£18.5m) package for the remainder of this season, with a €15million (£13.2m) loan fee going to Atletico, and the rest covering the player’s wages.\nArsenal are looking to sign an attacker, but are not prepared to pay the requested loan fee and Felix's salary. The Gunners are thought to be open to negotiating a loan deal worth around half of the current asking price from Atletico and the player.\nThe report adds that Arsenal do like the 23-year-old forward and some influential figures at the club believe he would be an ideal addition, especially on loan. The current Premier League leaders see a deal for Felix as similar to the initial loan that brought Martin Odegaard from Real Madrid to the Emirates Stadium - with the north Londonders providing an opportunity for the player to reignite their career and potential to earn a permanent move in the summer.\nGiven that the size of the current package being offered to Premier League clubs is considered too expensive, even for a club with United’s resources, it shows that Arsenal will need the loan fee and salary to come down significantly before a deal can be agreed. Atletico and Mendes may lower their demands as the January transfer window progresses given Felix's desire to leave the Spanish club and get his career back on track.\nArsenal 'agree' five-year contract with Mykhaylo Mudryk\nArsenal have agreed a contract with top transfer target Mykhaylo Mudryk, according to reports. The Ukraine international is claimed to have given the green light to a five-year deal.\nUkrainian outlet Sport Arena says a fee is yet to be sorted with Shakhtar. However, the report says a contract has been finalised with the winger and the Gunners are set to return with an improved offer.\nMudryk, 21, has made just 44 senior career appearances for Shakhtar. But his 12 goals and 17 assists so far has clearly caught the eye of Arteta. Arsenal's interest in the player first emerged in the summer window. Mudryk shone for Shakhtar during the Champions League group stage, which led to the club slapping a price tag of around £86m (€100m) on his head.\nArsenal's secret agent in Joao Felix negotiations\nArsenal have a 'secret agent' they can rely on to help persuade Joao Felix to sign for the Gunners in January.\nFelix maintains contact with his former Atletico team-mate Thomas Partey, who switched to the Emirates in October 2020, and that could help Arsenal convince him if the move comes down to a personal choice, according to The Athletic.\nThe 28-cap Portugal forward does have international team-mates at Manchester United too, of course.\nBukayo Saka continues breaking records\nArsenal star Bukayo Saka continues to break records for the Gunners as he guides his boyhood club on a potentially history-making season.\nThe England international has returned from the World Cup in brilliant form, scoring in back-to-back games to take his tally to six in the Premier League, with a further six assists having already been provided.\nNo player has scored more Premier League goals for Arsenal before the age of 21 than Bukayo Saka pic.twitter.com/UG3z4qVkPz\n— ESPN UK (@ESPNUK) December 31, 2022",
