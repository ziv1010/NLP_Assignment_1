  "body_text": "When Sergio Busquets made his Champions League debut for Barcelona in October 2008, George W Bush was the president of the United States, Lionel Messi had yet to play any games as a false No 9 and Pep Guardiola was a promising but unproven manager. The phrase ‘expected goals’ would have produced blank looks and many Barca fans were convinced Yaya Toure was their best holding midfielder.\nFifteen years on, the world looks very different — but Busquets keeps on doing the same things.\nAdvertisement\nOld Trafford reached boiling point after half-time of Barcelona’s Europa League play-off second leg against Manchester United, with the home crowd pushing for an equaliser following Robert Lewandowski’s penalty. Marcus Rashford saw an opportunity to press the Catalans’ back line and force them into giving the ball away.\nThat was when Busquets came across in the same way he has done for years, instantly defusing the situation with a lobbed header which fell to his fellow midfielder Franck Kessie. It was an intervention as smooth as his entire performance until then — but then the plan went wrong.\n- Manchester United 2-1 Barcelona: Player statistics, formations, xG\n- Barca after Busquets: Could Neves or Zubimendi replace a legend?\nKessie miscontrolled and Jadon Sancho regained possession in a dangerous area. One pass to Bruno Fernandes, another to Fred and suddenly United had drawn level in a game which, until then, had been run by Busquets.\nUnited fans erupted, Xavi bowed his head, a sign he knew what was coming next. The momentum was with United and it seemed clear that one goal would win it for either side. David de Gea made a spectacular save from Jules Kounde’s header before Antony struck the killer blow.\nAt that point, Busquets may have wondered whether that was it for his career at European level with Barca.\nIn the stands, Sir Alex Ferguson was beaming and there was a link to Busquets, too — the midfielder won two of his three Champions League titles against the legendary United manager. The Barca captain lifted his head and tried to rally his team-mates: Xavi’s team had 17 minutes plus stoppage time to save their season in Europe and potentially Busquets’ hopes of lifting another continental trophy.\nIt ended in sorry fashion. Busquets picked up a yellow card for pulling substitute Alejandro Garnacho to the ground as he looked to mount a counter-attack. He also ended up operating as an emergency centre-back when Andreas Christensen pushing forward in search of an equaliser.\nAdvertisement\nSo after 129 Champions League games, seven Europa League matches and three more in the UEFA Super Cup — contributing to his total of 708 Barca appearances — is that it?\nBusquets’ contract finishes in June and there is uncertainty over his future. Xavi insisted his captain stayed in January despite the option of a move to Major League Soccer, and the Barca coach wants him around next season too.\nHowever, some in Barca’s corridors of power would happily take Busquets’ salary off their books — he reportedly costs the club €23million per year.\nThe absence in midfield of Pedri and Gavi alongside Busquets — the former through injury, the latter through suspension — proved too much against United. But for 45 minutes, it seemed as if Barca were on the way to a statement win, thanks in large part to Busquets.\nGO DEEPER\nWhat does Pedri's injury mean for Barcelona before a crucial run of games?\nWhile football is increasingly about players’ physicality, pacy wingers and open spaces to attack, Busquets can compensate for all of that with his mind when he is well supported.\nHe blocked three attempts from Rashford, intercepted multiple deliveries from Casemiro and dismantled any press Erik ten Hag had planned before the game. That meant Barca started on the front foot in a stadium where Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal have lost this season.\nBusquets’ defensive clearances are vital in setting up Barca attacks. The way he chests the ball down in his box, his body feints and ability to remain in possession serve as a reminder of what made Barcelona great.\nThe 34-year-old ended the game with three clearances (the most of any Barca player), four interceptions (the most in the game), five successful tackles (the most in the game), 73 touches (the second-most in the game) and 39 accurate passes (the second-most in the game).\n“Busquets’ game was a bit like the rest of the team,” Xavi said. “He was excellent in the first half, but his influence on the game ended up being a bit blurred.\nAdvertisement\n“Our first half was excellent. We can’t be proud, but we have put up a competition in this game. Last year, it was not the case. We did not have enough to compete against the best teams, but this campaign has been different.”\nXavi’s words will hardly mitigate the frustration of fans, who are tired of seeing their team failing in Europe. Barcelona will enter March out of European competition for the first time in 24 years.\nLewandowski may have scored his 25th goal of the season, but Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez left the pitch happy after largely shutting out the Poland striker. The 34-year-old has not looked the same since the World Cup and that is a worry.\nThe new generation offer promise — in the absence of Pedri and Gavi, 19-year-old Alejandro Balde produced a performance to remember to establish himself as one of the most promising young full-backs in world football.\nXavi will now face the same questions when it comes to next season. Are Barcelona ready to work past their traumas? How long will it take them to get back to the European elite?\n“Hopefully next season,” Xavi said. “Now we have to learn again and come back. Today in the second half we lost most of the duels and the intensity we had.”\nBarcelona are still top of La Liga, eight points clear of Real Madrid and had not lost in 18 games.\nSecuring the league title would still represent a significant achievement and there is the Copa del Rey, where Barcelona face Real Madrid in the semi-finals either side of a league meeting against their arch-rivals in the next six weeks.\nWhat is next for Busquets? Only he will know if Thursday night at Old Trafford was a legend’s last dance on the European stage.\n(Top photo: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images)\nThe Athletic’s Spanish football coverage has expanded…\n- La Liga news, La Liga table; La Liga fixtures and results\n- Dermot Corrigan is joined by four new writers…\n- Real Madrid news from Mario Cortegana and Guillermo Rai\n- Barcelona news from Pol Ballús and Laia Cervelló Herrero",
