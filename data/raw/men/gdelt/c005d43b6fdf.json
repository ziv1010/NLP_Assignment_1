The Red Devils finished 15th, though they were never under any real threat of relegation due to the three promoted clubs struggling to adapt to the top flight and going straight back down.\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, Ruben Amorim and United began to focus on the Europa League. They knew that the competition could ease the pressure on their shoulders by giving fans the chance to celebrate a trophy, while also qualifying the club for next season’s Champions League.\nUnited reached the final but were left bitterly disappointed as Brennan Johnson’s winning goal saw Tottenham Hotspur end their 17-year trophy drought instead.\nUnited chiefs remain behind Amorim and are prepared to back him with serious spending this summer to improve the side’s fortunes next season.\nMatheus Cunha is expected to be the first new arrival, joining in a £62.5million deal from Wolverhampton Wanderers, and several more stars could follow the Brazilian to Old Trafford.\nEx-United midfielder Paul Ince has questioned why his former team has missed out on elite Premier League stars such as Alexis Mac Allister and Declan Rice.\nInce wants United to enter talks with Villa for England centre-forward Watkins amid concerns over the goalscoring ability of current No 9 Rasmus Hojlund.\n“If you picked your best 11 players from the Premier League, you wouldn’t have one United player in there,” he told The Telegraph.\n“And you probably could have said that in the last six or seven years. How can Liverpool go and sign the likes of Virgil van Dijk, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister, and Arsenal get Declan Rice?\n“Why haven’t United been in the market for them? Are they looking in the right places? I don’t think they are right now, so it’s a big summer for everyone involved at the club, that’s for sure.\n“They badly need more firepower and I’m looking at someone like Ollie Watkins – a striker who can actually score goals – as a player United need to be going for.”\nDIVE DEEPER 👉 Man Utd striker targets: EVERY option linked for the summer after Liam Delap rejection\nSolskjaer did want Rice at Man Utd\nFormer United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has previously confirmed he wanted to sign the likes of Rice, Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham before they became world-class players.\nHowever, United decided to pursue different targets, and they have been paying the price for those missed opportunities in recent years.\nWatkins could be a great signing for United as he is a proven Premier League goalscorer, having found the back of the net 16 times in 38 appearances this term.\nVilla boss Unai Emery called Watkins ‘fantastic’ after he bagged against Bournemouth to become the club’s record goalscorer in the Premier League. That strike also guaranteed Villa European football for next season.\nUnited fans might want a more glamorous name to join their club and replace Hojlund, such as Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen or Benjamin Sesko.\nBut United cannot be overly picky given the fact they have failed to qualify for any European competition.\nINEOS hoped to bring in Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap but he has chosen Chelsea instead due to them being in the Champions League.\nMan Utd transfer news: Two Brighton stars eyed; Scholes verdict\n📌 Double Man Utd raid on Prem rival ignites as journalist reveals approach for 27y/o star\n📌 Paul Scholes brutally demands Man Utd SELL Bruno Fernandes with scathing assessment of captain\n📌 Man Utd turn to 17-goal hitman after Chelsea deliver Ruben Amorim brutal transfer blow – sources",
