  "body_text": "Spurs hold City to help rival Arsenal\nVilla also slips up against Brentford, as United rolls back the years with dramatic victory over Fulham\nTottenham did fierce rival Arsenal a huge favor in the Premier League title race on Sunday.\nDominic Solanke scored a second-half double — including one from an outrageous scorpion kick — as Spurs came from two goals down to salvage a 2-2 draw with second-placed Manchester City, leaving Arsenal with a six-point lead with 14 games left.\nIt was almost the perfect day for the league leader, with Aston Villa — the other title contender — losing 1-0 at home to 10-man Brentford.\nVilla stayed seven points adrift of Arsenal and was in danger of being reeled in by fourth-place Manchester United, which scored a stoppage-time winner through Benjamin Sesko to beat Fulham 3-2 for a third straight league win under new manager Michael Carrick.\nHaving already overseen victories over City and Arsenal in his short tenure, Carrick appears to have found the magic touch needed to revitalize United.\nThe same cannot be said of Pep Guardiola at the moment.\nMissed opportunity\nThis was a huge wasted opportunity for Guardiola's City, which was 2-0 up against a heavily depleted Tottenham side and was cruising into halftime thanks to goals from Rayan Cherki and Antoine Semenyo. At times, it was almost too easy for City in front of an apathetic home crowd at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nCity then collapsed as a revitalized Tottenham fought back. Solanke bundled in Spurs' first goal — appearing to kick the back of new city signing Marc Guehi's leg, resulting in the ball dribbling over the line — and then grabbed the equalizer with a deft, flying back-flick that looped over City goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma into the corner of the net.\n\"The first half was difficult — we couldn't get near them at times,\"Solanke said. \"The second half was a different story. In the second half, we were great and grew with confidence and belief.\"\nIn the last five games, City has looked vulnerable, losing twice — to United and tiny Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League — and now stuttering against injury-hit Spurs.\n\"We haven't had the consistency to win the games when others were able to do it,\" said Guardiola.\n\"It is a setback, but we are still there. There are 14 games to go and a lot of points. We will see.\n\"I know that these types of games, always in the past, you had to capitalize and win, but yeah, players are coming back, and I saw incredibly good spirit.\n\"We had the injuries, one month ago we had a lot, with nine or 10 players out, but, at the same time, we are there, and the calendar is what it is.\"\nArsenal, a 4-0 winner at Leeds on Saturday, might not have a better chance to end its league title drought that stretches back to 2004.\n'It's not fair'\nVilla played for more than half of its match with an extra man after Brentford winger Kevin Schade's straight red card for kicking out at Matty Cash in the 42nd minute after a challenge for the ball.\nIn the first minute of first-half stoppage time, Dango Ouattara escaped down the right and scored at the second attempt for what proved to be only goal, as Brentford weathered a second-half onslaught.\n\"Of course, I accept it. But for me it is not fair,\" said Villa boss Unai Emery. \"My explanation is that it is one action after a long time. If the assistant referee did not see it, we must continue playing.\n\"I think the problem is the VAR should not be asking in this situation. I accept it, but it is not fair.\n\"I can't say anything more about it. It is football, and, of course, Brentford played fantastic with one player less than us.\"\n'The best feeling'\nUnited squandered a two-goal lead earned by goals from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha, with Raul Jimenez — via a penalty — and a Kevin screamer bringing Fulham briefly level at Old Trafford.\nThere was still time for Bruno Fernandes to send in a cross that was controlled by Sesko, who swiveled to curl home a finish in front of the Stretford End.\n\"It's the best feeling, I have to say,\"Carrick said about the kind of late winners United scored so often under his old manager, Alex Ferguson. \"People leave here with more than just, 'United won today.' It's layers on top of that, the emotion and the feeling, and it's why we all love it so much.\"\nThe match took place after a protest by around 500-600 United fans unhappy at the ownership of the 20-time champion, but the team is finally in a decent league position — fourth place — in its bid to return to the Champions League.\nUnited is five points behind Villa with 14 rounds remaining.\nAlso on Sunday, Crystal Palace — without star striker Jean-Philippe Mateta ahead of his possible move to AC Milan — drew 1-1 at Nottingham Forest, which was reduced to 10 men after Neco Williams was sent off in the 45th minute for a handball on the line.\nMost Popular\n- Guangdong beats Macao 2-0 in first leg of soccer cup\n- Para teams set to leave mark on ice\n- US skier Johnson wins women's downhill as Vonn crashes at Milan-Cortina Games\n- Su Yiming clinches first medal at Milano-Cortina\n- Over 300 athletes from 35 countries and regions kick off Asian championships in Tianjin\n- Legacy of Beijing 2022 lives on as Milan welcomes Games",
