The series opened in Greece with the Derby of the Eternal Enemies, then followed with the Old Firm in Scotland. Now to southern France and the story of Marseille versus Paris Saint-Germain.\nAdvertisement\nIt is 10pm on Sunday at the Stade Velodrome and Kylian Mbappe has settled this loudest of arguments.\nThe France forward’s second sumptuous goal of the match, 10 minutes after half-time, put Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 up against Olympique de Marseille. In the absence of influential defenders Chancel Mbemba and Samuel Gigot, the home side have been exposed and dispatched by the brilliance of Mbappe and Lionel Messi.\nFor now, at least, there is no way back. Victory in Le Classique, French football’s biggest rivalry, has gone to the men from the capital.\nAs the final whistle approaches, patches of white seats appear as some Marseille supporters, thousands of whom had gathered hours ahead of kick-off to generate an atmosphere so hot it could impact climate change, head out into the drizzle to squeeze onto a metro train home.\nBut at either end of this 67,000-seater stadium, with its roof that undulates like one of the waves breaking on the shore of the city’s Vieux (old) Port, the thunderous noise continues.\nEven as this game slips away out on the pitch, the stadium remains a cauldron. There’s little self-pity, frustration or fury — just rolling apocalyptic noise. Lots of it. The crack of ever more flares, and the drums.\nIt is as if nobody told the Ultras on Les Virages Sud et Nord (the South and North ends) that they stood no chance of salvaging a game which would have been loaded with intensity even if it was not a potential Ligue 1 title decider. That their heroes are slipping even further behind the leaders almost goes ignored.\nPSG fans celebrate, but only at home or in bars. Their team remain top and en route to retaining the championship, but they are banned by government decree from attending this away fixture, and vice versa for their Marseille counterparts, because of previous disorder when these clubs have collided.\nAdvertisement\nBut back on the streets of this rebel city — which may have given its name to the French national anthem La Marseillaise but otherwise feels culturally distinct from the capital far to the north — this setback will not dampen the defiance.\nBy the end, as Messi and company celebrate in the away dressing room, the North and South stands continue to sing, if only serenading each other; each still a cluster of jumping, swaying, frenetic energy oblivious to the pain of a comprehensive defeat inflicted by bitter rivals.\nThere will be raw throats and sore heads in Marseille on Monday morning, but the battle goes on.\nLe Classique is France’s answer to Spain’s Clasico, Germany’s Der Klassiker, the Old Firm in Scotland or the Premier League’s biggest derbies.\nBut while the enmity between Marseille and Paris is very real, the rivalry around Le Classique is a relatively new creation.\nIt was really only whipped up in the mid-1980s when PSG, a club not founded until 1970, first emerged as potential challengers for the title and then, in 1991, received their first ticket to the big time thanks to a takeover from French broadcast giants Canal Plus. Marseille had long since established themselves as the dominant force in French football, but they needed a big rival to bolster Ligue 1’s strength and international appeal.\nRecognising as much, the southern club’s chairman Bernard Tapie — a controversial and divisive figure in his own right — conspired with his Parisian counterpart to build meetings between the two clubs into a brand fixture.\nIn that sense, this rivalry is manufactured.\nThe supporters needed little encouragement. A level of animosity, whether on grounds of class, economics or governance, had always existed between the two cities. Football had offered those here a means of demonstrating their defiance of distant Paris. Now that PSG posed a direct threat, that merely intensified.\nAdvertisement\nMarseille fans viewed PSG as nouveaux-riches upstarts, where they represented footballing heritage.\nAs the 1990s progressed, Le Classique gathered fierce momentum.\n“Sometimes this rivalry goes a little overboard,” former PSG president Alain Cayzac told French newspaper Le Figaro in 2020. “Excellent when it is a competition; when there is rivalry and not violence.”\nMarseille remain the only French club to have won the Champions League, beating AC Milan in the 1993 final of a newly-rebranded European Cup, but their old superiority ebbed away as time went on. They endured life in Ligue 2 for two seasons in the mid-1990s after financial irregularities and a match-fixing scandal during Tapie’s time as president.\nSince PSG’s takeover by Qatar Sports Investment (QSI) in 2011, the tables have turned emphatically.\nAs one of the wealthiest clubs in the world, the team from the Parc des Princes went on to sign superstars such as Neymar and Messi. They have won the league in eight of their 11 seasons under Qatari ownership and are eight points clear at the top this time round. Marseille’s last title came in 2010, more than a year before Qatar’s involvement in the capital had even been established.\nYet their impressive form this season under Croatian manager Igor Tudor had been offering Marseille fans hope they might yet break PSG’s monopoly. There is a feeling they can muster a challenge.\nIn geographic terms, Le Classique is not a derby at all.\nAs the crow flies, the Parc des Princes is 414 miles (666 kilometres) from Stade Velodrome.\nThe capital is considered the sophisticated and affluent seat of power. Marseille has a reputation for being more working class and culturally diverse, with centuries of immigration from North Africa. The two cities can feel poles apart.\nArno Tarrini is an Agence France-Presse journalist based in Paris. He is also a passionate Marseille fan, living behind enemy lines.\nAdvertisement\n“Sometimes it’s not easy,” he laughs. “Especially working in the media industry. You have a lot of PSG fans in Paris, so they always try to make fun of Marseille fans. They are pretty quiet lately.\n“Actually, Marseille’s traditional rival has always been Bordeaux, but they are now in Ligue 2. But there is, however, a wider south versus capital rivalry.\n“Marseille is the popular port city who have always challenged the powerful. Paris is viewed as the rich and disconnected city. The arrival of the Qataris strengthened that idea, giving Marseille fans another argument: ‘We are the biggest club in France, we have passion. You only have money’.”\nTarrini believes Marseille can still claim to be France’s most popular club. Their away following, at games to which their fans are allowed to travel, is vociferous and considerable. Visiting Marseille fans regularly drown out the noise made by home crowds.\nBut he craves an upturn in fortunes when it comes to Le Classique.\n“Most of them are bitter memories,” he says. “In recent years, we haven’t won a lot of games against Paris. The big one everyone remembers is the 2015 Classique. It ended at 2-2 and that was probably one of the best atmospheres ever at the Velodrome at that time.”\nEven more fondly, he recalls the most recent notable win in Paris, 3-0 during Marseille’s last title-winning season.\nThere have been colourful results up in the capital.\nFormer Marseille president Pape Diouf clashed with French football’s governing body over security issues and his club’s away ticket allocation ahead Le Classique in March 2006 and, in protest, ordered the coaching staff to field a reserve side. His youngsters managed a goalless draw.\nDiouf was hailed a hero by Marseille fans, who felt his stance typified their city’s rebellious spirit.\nPSG fans may be accustomed to Champions League rivalries with some of the continent’s marquee clubs these days, but when it comes to mutual dislike, they keep their side of this bargain.\nAdvertisement\n“For me, the most important game when the fixtures are released is Marseille,” says Antoine Medeiros, a PSG fan from Nice, a couple of hours along the coast from Marseille. As a southerner, he has a nuanced perspective on the rivalry.\n“This time, we need to beat them to keep on track for the title and to lose is unthinkable,” he said before Sunday’s game. “I can accept going out of the Champions League because we are used to that, but to lose the title to Marseille would be the worst. I can take losing to Monaco or Lille, but never Marseille.\n“The last 10 years, it was hard for them because they lost most of the games between us. But now they are strong and have hope.”\nAs an obsessive PSG fan who wakes up in the middle of the night to watch their pre-season friendlies being played in Japan on TV, does he feel frustrated not to be able to go to the Velodrome?\n“I would not go and sit with Marseille fans anyway,” he says. “I would not put my hand in the fire.”\nTyrone Mears thought he knew all about antagonistic fixtures.\nThe defender came through Manchester City’s academy before briefly playing for their first team, so experienced what the Manchester derby means. He went on to sign for West Ham United and played in heated games against fellow Londoners Chelsea.\nBut it was a season on loan at Marseille in 2008-09 that made him reappraise the concept of rivalry.\n“I was injured when I first went and, after I got fit, my first game was against PSG in Paris,” he tells The Athletic from the United States, where he coaches Inter Miami Under-17s. “I wasn’t really prepared for it. This was a real hatred.\n“I don’t think I ever played in a bigger rivalry in my career. The Marseille fans turned up in big numbers everywhere we went. For away games, they’d come and see us off at the airport.\nAdvertisement\n“For that PSG match, there was lots of security around us at the hotel. Then the road to the Parc des Princes was partially blocked off as our coach was driving to the stadium. But as we got closer the other players and staff started putting their heads down. I didn’t have a clue what was going on until someone grabbed the back of my head and said, ‘Get down’.\n“Then I heard it — bang, bang, bang. Bricks and rocks started smashing into the coach. It was surreal. When we got off to walk into the ground, their fans were screaming at us from behind the fence.\n“It was passion and, I have to say, real aggression, too.”\nA Boudewijn Zenden-inspired Marseille won 3-1 that day and the players were greeted again by jubilant fans as they arrived back at Marseille Provence Airport in the early hours of the next morning.\nIt is 5pm, nearly four hours before kick-off.\nMarseille fans gather outside bars on Boulevard Michelet, the long dual carriageway leading to the stadium. They clutch tin foil trays crammed with shots of pastis, a 45 per cent ABV anise-flavoured spirit which emerged in the 1930s to fill a void left by the ban on absinthe and remains popular in Bouches-du-Rhone.\nThe drink’s distinctive aroma mixes with the distant smell of smoke from flares already being thrust into the air.\nDance music throbs out of kerbside speakers and the sirens of passing police cars and ambulances provide a heady backbeat.\nOutside one bar, members of the South Stand Winners, one of Marseille’s biggest Ultra groups, drink in the liquor and the atmosphere.\n“This is the big game for us,” says Valentin, in his orange hoodie.\n“During the game, you will hear us sing to the Dodgers [the name of the Ultras in Le Virage Nord at the opposite end of the ground] and they chant back to us. You must go far to find spirit like in our stadium.”\nHe is not exaggerating — the noise is formidable long before the 8.45pm kick-off.\nAdvertisement\nAs tradition demands, the build-up shifts to Jean Bouin Square at the entrance to the Velodrome as more fans take their positions on the steps to the stadium concourse. This is reminiscent of the throng outside the Stadio San Paolo, now the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, before a Napoli game, or the scenes before Argentinian club Boca Juniors play at La Bombonera in Buenos Aires.\nFireworks constantly crack and pop into the dusk and, as day turns to night, the atmosphere cranks up further still. It’s raucous and highly charged, but there’s no aggression or menace. Just passion. And more pastis.\nChants of “Paris, Paris, on t’encule” (“Paris, Paris, fuck you”) begin to break out more frequently. The incessant flow of passing cars honk their horns approvingly.\nFifteen years ago, Marseille defender Taye Taiwo got a little carried away himself. The Nigerian scored the only goal to clinch the French League Cup final against Montpellier and, during celebrations on the pitch, he grabbed a microphone to give his own rendition of that pointed message to PSG. Taiwo was given a one-match ban and fined €20,000 (£17,746; $21,352) by the French Football Federation’s ethics committee.\nHad they been allowed near the ground, PSG supporters may well have sung a notorious retort in which they compare their southern rivals to rats in the mud and the sewers. It is a chant shrouded in controversy, linked to racism prompted by Marseille’s diverse fanbase.\nThere have been more serious ramifications to the emnity.\nIn 2010, a PSG fan died after being attacked by supporters of his own club. The 38-year-old was caught up in street clashes before a match against Marseille, which PSG lost 3-0.\nFrance’s then-sports minister, Rama Yade, said in a statement: “The club’s survival is at stake. The worst has happened. Passions transformed into sordid, senseless, murderous rage.\n“Love of the team jersey has become hate for the other, hate for the sport, hate for life.”\nDespite such dark flashpoints, supporters of both sides hope the present ban on away travel does not persist. But such is the intensity generated by Marseille fans on Sunday, it is difficult to imagine how it could crank up a gear even with their PSG counterparts in town.\nAs with Mears, life as a Marseille player was a shock to Chris Makin’s system.\nAdvertisement\nThe former Sunderland and Ipswich Town full-back had a long and varied career but reserves special affection for his time as one of the first pioneering Bosman ‘free transfers’ — alongside John Collins and Allan Johnston, who joined Monaco and Rennes respectively, in the summer of 1996 — to swap life in England for continental Europe after his contract expired.\nHe joined Marseille from Oldham Athletic and played 32 games in all competitions during his single season in Bouches-du-Rhone.\n“Basically, you couldn’t lose a home game,” Makin, who retired in 2008, tells The Athletic from Qatar, where he now works as a commentator. “If you were losing at Stade Velodrome, you could sense the atmosphere change towards the end and you knew there’d be fighting outside the ground.\n“Like in Italy, you had those different fan groups and Ultras. I remember we lost once at home and they came into the dressing room, going nuts. I was staring intently at my bootlaces. I think because I’d not long joined, I got a pass, but it was nuts.\n“Another time, they were running after the players’ cars, booting them. I was thinking, ‘What’s going on here?’, but they were just so passionate. The noise they made was immense and it never let up throughout games. Most of the time, you could barely hear your team-mates or the manager and you were playing off instinct.”\nMakin admits to enduring a dash of impostor syndrome when he first arrived at the Velodrome.\n“I remember when I went there to sign my contract, they’d only won the Champions League a few years before and in the offices were pictures of Basile Boli, Rudi Voller and Didier Deschamps,” he says. “I’d been at Oldham a few weeks before and I’m thinking, ‘What am I doing here?’.\n“You’ve got to click into the mentality of what it means to the fans. In England, we’d get to the stadium at 2pm for a 3pm kick-off. But at Marseille, we’d go to a hotel and then travel by coach to the stadium a few hours early. When we were getting close, we’d see hundreds of them. They’d been there well beforehand.\nThe scene outside Marseille’s training ground as the players leave for the last time ahead of a title challenge clash vs PSG tomorrow.

I had that English mentality of getting stuck in and working hard. That was what they demanded.”\nAdvertisement\nMakin would go on to play for Sunderland against Newcastle in the Tyne-Wear derby but says nothing in his career compared to Le Classique. “The intensity and volume didn’t drop for 90 minutes,” he said. “I remember once we played at Parc des Princes and the two sets of fans were firing flares at each other.\n“The cities are so far away but they despise each other. There’s nothing remote about that rivalry.”\nIn the bowels of the Velodrome late on Sunday night, Tudor is talking about aliens.\nSpecifically, the one who just became PSG’s joint all-time domestic goalscorer with a brace that took him to 200 goals.\n“Mbappe got too much space because he is an amazing player,” he says in Italian to the assembled media as a French interpreter works feverishly to keep up beside him. “He’s from another planet.”\nFor Marseille fan and journalist Loris Biondi, there is the familiar lament of the modern observer of a club outside the uber-rich petro-clubs. “It feels like we don’t fight in the same competition,” he says with a sigh. “Today people in Marseille say that, without Qatar, PSG would not be able to play for the league.”\nHe pulls up his hood and heads off into the rain, already planning the next game; a Coupe de France quarter-final against second division Annecy back here last night. (In the round of 16, Marseille had defeated PSG 2-1 at the Velodrome. But they lost to Annecy on penalties after needing an equaliser deep in added time to force the shootout).\n“Anyway,” he adds, “the PSG public has nothing to do with the Marseille public.\n“They are spectators.\n“We are supporters.”\nExplore the venues, from the stadia to where to eat and stay when visiting Marseille, in our interactive Google Map:\n(Photos used in top image: Christophe Simon/AFP via Getty Images; Franck Fife/AFP via Getty Images; Sylvain Thomas/AFP via Getty Images; Franck Fife/AFP via Getty Images)",
