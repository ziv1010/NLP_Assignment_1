We need a massive effort on Sunday, a bit of luck and some game management might be nice.\nTonight keeps us in the hunt for Europe and after the Brighton cup debacle it’s a tonic to lift spirits.\nI’ve seen it suggested by some fans that this game was more important than Sunday!\nNot sure I entirely agree but kind of get where they’re coming from.\nOh for everything just to click on Sunday…’\nThe Armchair Fan:\n‘Whoo hoo! absolutely delighted with that!\nA Huge win and a brilliant three points to help us towards the champions league.\nLet’s repeat the winning scoreline at Wembley in a few days’ time!\nBrilliant from the Toon tonight.’\nBilly Miller:\n‘Our least important visit to London this week but a welcome win and a jump to sixth.\nHappy for Barnes getting the winning assist but the drop-off in quality on that left hand side was clear with both Gordon and Hall missing.\nWe’ll need to go up several gears to better Liverpool.’\nTony Mallabar:\n‘You know when it’s going to be your day, you have a lie in and you still have your electric blanket on, you go and get petrol and despite it being chocka you get straight to a pump.\nThe downside being when we got to the Premier Inn and checked in, it was my turn to have the double bed in our twin room, but unfortunately, both were single beds. So hence my forecast of a 1-1 draw.\nThe joys of following Newcastle United away.\nJoking apart, there’s a lot worse going on in the world.\nSo come on my mighty mags bring that trophy home on Sunday.\n(Sleeping arrangements for Sunday to follow.)’\nJamie Smith:\n‘That could be a massive three points in the scheme of things but it’s the shorter term benefits we’ll be hoping for.\nIt didn’t look like any injuries were suffered, although I’ll be dreading Craig Hope’s tweets tomorrow.\nThe win will hopefully boost confidence ahead of Sunday and after a dull first half, a couple of encouraging performances.\nJoelinton’s helping out of Livramento against Bowen looked like a good dress rehearsal for Salah.\nNick Pope’s daft header at the edge of the box was the sort of half chance Dubravka stands off and the opposition score.\nLevel on points with 5th, we’ll take that.\nWonder if we’ve one more London win in us this week?’\nMark Jankowski:\n‘Following the weekend’s results and the fact we don’t play in the league next week because of a certain trip to Wembley, this was a huge game against West Ham.\nNewcastle needed to win against a recently resurgent Hammers team and we were able to deliver.\nIt wasn’t a classic in East London but it was a very professional away performance where, aside from a very early Soucek chance, we were never seriously troubled.\nWe can head to Wembley now knowing we’re well in the mix for Champions League. Let’s give it everything on Sunday.‘\nSimon Ritter:\n‘Can we have this referee and his VAR for the League Cup final please?\nOn another day, our goal would have been disallowed for a push by Isak and West Ham would have been given a penalty for a push by Guimaraes.\nAnyone who says luck doesn’t play a big part in football is a fool.\nI just hope we didn’t use up our March allocation tonight.\nWe deserved to win because we wanted it more than a home team who rarely looked as good as they did when winning at Arsenal two weeks ago.\nPlus points (apart from the invaluable win) were the way Joelinton played himself back into form, Livramento coped on the wrong flank and Tonali controlled the midfield.\nWorries were Isak’s lack of sharpness and the sloppy passing that halted our momentum time and again.\nAs for that “attacking” free-kick five minutes before Guimaraes scored, which ended with Pope hoofing the ball into touch…words fail me.’\nOden Hudson:\n‘In a game that kept neutrals far from the edge of their seats, Newcastle managed to scrape what is overall a very solid victory away at the London stadium.\nImportantly, no further injuries were added to the list and the boys will hopefully go into Sunday with some much needed renewed confidence following recent struggles.\nPrior to Sunday, the full back situation certainly needs looked at, with Livramento clearly poor on his weak foot.\nPerhaps swapping Trippier and Tino is the way to go.\nThe lack of energy from Wilson is also unfortunately clear and I would rather call upon the youthful energy and hunger of Osula on Sunday should we be chasing a goal.’\nWest Ham 0 Newcastle 1 – Monday 10 March 8pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nBruno 63\nWest Ham:\nPossession was Newcastle 49% West Ham 51%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 9 West Ham 9\nShots on target were Newcastle 3 West Ham 2\nCorners were Newcastle 4 West Ham 3\nTouches in the box Newcastle 28 West Ham 21\nNewcastle team v West Ham:\nPope, Trippier, Schar, Burn, Livramento, Joelinton, Tonali, Bruno (Longstaff 88), Barnes (Willock 79), Isak (Wilson 79), Murphy\nUnused subs:\nDubravka, Targett, Krafth, Osula, Miley, Neave\n(Match Report – Massive for Champions League AND Carabao Cup Final – West Ham 0 Newcastle 1 Read HERE)\nThe remaining Newcastle United match schedule:\nSunday 16 March – Newcastle v Liverpool (4.30pm) Carabao Cup final Sky Sports\nWednesday 2 April – Newcastle v Brentford (7.45pm)\nMonday 7 April – Leicester v Newcastle (8pm) Sky Sports\nSunday 13 April – Newcastle v Man U (4.30pm) Sky Sports\nWednesday 16 April – Newcastle v Palace (7.30pm)\nSaturday 19 April – Villa v Newcastle (5.30pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 26 April – Newcastle v Ipswich (3pm)\nSaturday 3 May – Brighton v Newcastle TBC\nSaturday 10 May – Newcastle v Chelsea TBC\nSunday 18 May – Arsenal v Newcastle TBC\nSunday 25 May – Newcastle v Everton (4pm)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
