Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nUnited flattered to deceive for much of their Premier League opener against Fulham on Friday night but a late goal from summer signing Joshua Zirkzee proved decisive.\n‘In the beginning of the season, the first target is going into the top four,’ Guardiola said of Man City’s aspirations. ‘And the people say, ‘Ah, come on. What?’ No. Top-four.\n‘Newcastle – they’re not in European competition – they’re going to play one game a week. And Newcastle, one game a week, this season will be the Newcastle of two seasons ago.\n‘And Arsenal it’s not necessary to talk about, Liverpool it’s not necessary to talk about, I know the signings of (Manchester) United and at the end they’re going to take the moment and they will be there.\n‘Tottenham, I’m pretty sure of that as well, they invest in the young players, with the manager who knows better.\n‘So there are a lot, a lot of teams – Chelsea, again, with the amount of players, the quality, I believe with the manager.\n‘All the six or seven teams are there. If you drop a little bit, you will be away.\n‘This is the reality I’ve felt from the first season that I arrived here, and after, yeah, we proved ourselves that we can do it. And we’ll try to do it again this season, it’s simple.’\nWhile Guardiola claimed Man City’s first objective is to qualify for the Champions League, in reality he is hoping to guide the team to an unprecedented fifth straight Premier League title.\nMore Trending\nBut several pundits – including former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand – believe Manchester City will be denied by Arsenal.\n‘I think it’s hard to go against City because of how successful they’ve been over the last four seasons,’ said Ferdinand on TNT Sports. ‘They’ve set a new benchmark, a new record of four in a row.\n‘But I just think Arsenal, Calafiori coming in on the left hand side, if he comes in and sures that area up…I think he’s a fantastic player, played at Bologna under Thiago Motta, he understands that type of football that Arteta wants to play.\n‘I think that was the area that was a slight weakness in the team, he gives them a bit of balance there and a bit of stability. So I’ll go maybe Arsenal to win it, but there’s got to be a hunger.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Angel Gomes provides update after sickening head injury in Lille’s clash with Reims\nMORE: Ian Wright criticises ‘desperate’ Arsenal star after Wolves win\nMORE: Huge boost for Chelsea as key target ‘wants to join’ before transfer deadline",
