He has attended several high-profile matches, including many Aston Villa games.\nThe 42-year-old also recently took his son, Prince George, to the Champions League Quarter Final Second Leg match on April 15 in Birmingham, England.\nPreviously, William explained his strong connection to Aston. He told the BBC in 2015, \"A long time ago at school, I got into football, big time. I was looking around for a club to support, and all my friends at school were either Manchester United fans or Chelsea fans,\" but he said he chose Aston.",
