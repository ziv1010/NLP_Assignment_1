  "body_text": "The rumours surrounding West Ham captain and England international, Declan Rice, just won’t go away, and it’s entirely possible he could end up at Liverpool according to super agent, Haydn Dodge.\nIt hasn’t been the best of seasons for the Hammers, because despite getting to the semi-final of European football’s third-tier tournament, the Europa Conference League, they’ve struggled badly in the English top-flight.\nRice has rarely, if ever, let the team down and is always looking to lead by example and drive the team forward.\nHe has been a shining light in a team of underperforming stars, and it really wouldn’t be a surprise to see him taking those talents to a team that’s challenging in the upper echelons of the Premier League table and in the Champions League or Europa League.\nAccording to Haydn Dodge, writing in his exclusive column for CaughtOffside, the England international could well be plying his trade at Anfield in the near future.\n‘Declan Rice has always been a recruitment target for Liverpool, but I’m also being told that he would like to stay around London,’ he wrote.\n‘I know Mason Mount was a big target for Liverpool around the same time.’\nAs Dodge mentions, there are potentially other clubs that are in the race, but there’s a reason why a move to Liverpool could have added value for the national team.\n‘If I’m a Liverpool fan and I’ve potentially got a midfield of Harvey Elliott, Declan Rice and Mason Mount, plus the other players they’ve already got there, that’s a real big positive and could potentially be an England midfield for years to come,’ he added.\nHe clearly isn’t going to come cheap for any interested parties, but you get what you pay for, and Declan Rice is a player that is at the top of his game right now.",
