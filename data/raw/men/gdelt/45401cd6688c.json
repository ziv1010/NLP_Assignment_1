But it wasn’t enough.\nPellistri was unable to establish himself as a first team regular, and sought a loan move, landing with La Liga strugglers Granada.\nHe is getting what he wanted, with three starts for Granada so far – more than the one Premier League start he had in 2023.\nFacundo Pellistri on Manchester United\nUruguay international Facundo Pellistri has no regrets over his spell at Manchester United, talking up the experience, and he is happy with his current opportunity.\nSpeaking to ESPN, he said: “The whole time I was in Manchester was incredible, the experiences I had, I shared with the best players in the world and I was able to play many important games. Today I am in a stage of looking for more minutes, I am very happy with the opportunity.\n“Although I had minutes at Manchester United, it was not the amount I would like given the football moment I was in. I am very happy for the minutes I played here.”\nHe was thankful for a start he had away at Bayern Munich in the Champions League for United, explaining: “It was a dream night, making my Champions League debut with the Bayern stadium full, playing against one of the best in the world was a unique experience.”\nThe young winger played at the 2022 World Cup with Uruguay and his national side beat both Argentina and Brazil last year, with Pellistri playing a key role. He wants to keep his international place, and this will mean playing regularly.\nPellistri’s early highlight in Spain was a goal and assist for Granada in a 3-3 draw against Barcelona at the Nou Camp. He spoke about this, commenting: “The goal against Barcelona was in an incredible match, where we deserved a little more.”\nPellistri on Erik ten Hag\nFacundo Pellistri’s chances of getting another chance at Manchester United were not helped in January, when his agent fired a broadside at the Dutchman.\nWhile his Granada loan was in the process of being completed, Pellistri’s agent spoke out to say that unless Erik ten Hag is fired, he believes the young winger has no future at Old Trafford.\nPellistri offered some perspective with his thoughts, demonstrating an understanding that Ten Hag’s job is not so easy.\nHe said: “A player always wants to play, many times one does not put oneself into the manager’s decisions, who has to think about many more things. Many times the player does not know what the coach is thinking or why he makes the decisions he makes. One has to be ready and enjoy the moments one has.”\nHe added that he believes Ten Hag is very ‘strict’, and added he is a manager ‘with a clear idea of what he wants to play and always tries to translate it.’\nThe first part of the season was not easy for Manchester United, with the team losing as many games as they won, and knocked out of Europe altogether.\nPellistri says this certainly made matters more difficult for him, but added he is glad to see the team’s form improving.\nHe said: “Manchester was not finding a win, when a great team enters that situation everything becomes more difficult and day to day life is more complicated. Now they have picked up a little and hopefully at the end of the season the goal of reaching the Champions League will be achieved.”\nREAD MORE: Join the conversation with the United in Focus Whatsapp group",
