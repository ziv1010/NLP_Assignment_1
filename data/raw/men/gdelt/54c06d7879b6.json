Deals for both forward players will set United back a combined £92.5m.\nDON’T MISS 🔴⚫ Alarming Leny Yoro injury prediction as Man Utd sweat on defender’s Europa League final fitness.\nLiam Delap to Man Utd: transfer timeline revealed\nWriting on X, Jacobs says there is now an ‘optimism’ that United can secure his signing, ahead of Chelsea, though the striker is still waiting to see which of the two sides will be able to offer him Champions League football first before fully making up his mind.\n‘Manchester United are optimistic of signing Liam Delap if they win the Europa League,’ Jacobs began. ‘United and Chelsea are currently the two leading Premier League clubs considering triggering Liam Delap’s £30m clause, which is active now that Ipswich are relegated.\n‘Delap is waiting to see who gets what at the end of the season, but Man Utd have made a strong pitch already. He is the number one striker target, and United have the financial means to sign both Delap and Matheus Cunha early in the window if they can reach an agreement with both players.\n‘Chelsea have a number of striker options with Delap well-known to Enzo Maresca and Chelsea’s recruitment team.’\nJacobs has also revealed the 22-year-old wants to finalise his future before heading off with England Under-21s for this summer’s European Championships, with their campaign due to begin on June 12 against Czech Republic in Slovakia.\n‘Delap wants to decide before he leaves for the Under-21 European Championship,’ Jacobs confirmed.\nFletcher explained that Chelsea sources have told us that “Man Utd’s package is far more solid” and that the Blues “have been offering a much more staggered deal than them”.\nAs stated before, we can also confirm that salary will be an important factor in Delap’s final decision over where he ends up playing next, with the Red Devils out in front in that regard.\nTEAMtalk can also reveal that Delap would still be interested in a move to Old Trafford even if United have no European football next season, though, of course, the offer of Champions League football would be a hugely persuasive factor all the same.\nTalkSPORT pundit Troy Deeney also thinks a move to Old Trafford would benefit the player more.\n“He has to play [to get into the England squad], right?” Deeney asked.\n“So his next step would be, if I was advising him, would be that with Man United, it’s nailed on.\n“If he went to Man United, he’d start every week. He’d instantly make them better.”\nMan Utd transfer latest: Final Jadon Sancho decision made; new Bruno fear\nMeanwhile, Chelsea are reported to have been in contact with United to inform them they will not be signing Jadon Sancho this summer and will happily pay the costly fee to back out of the deal, with the winger’s agents now working on a deal to one of two sides overseas.\nSancho could ultimately be replaced at Stamford Bridge next season by another Man Utd star in Alejandro Garnacho. And according to a recent report, the Argentine is willing to join the Blues in the summer window, and with TEAMtalk able to reveal the Red Devils’ stance on selling the winger.\nElsewhere, there are also fresh doubts emerging over Bruno Fernandes, with the report revealing the midfielder ‘concerned’ about a potential lack of European football next season, and therefore has a ‘strong temptation’ to accept a huge contract elsewhere should they lose to Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday week.\nIn terms of incomings, Gary Neville has urged United to sign Denzel Dumfries, who’s been tearing up the Champions League with Inter Milan this season.",
