Just two years later, Paris FC were relegated to the second tier as PSG moved into the top flight.\nIncredibly, the French capital had not had a professional football club since the demise of Racing Club de France and Stade français in the 1960s and inspired by the great Ajax team of Johan Cruyff, the club’s first president, fashion designer Daniel Hechter, placed a large vertical red stripe in the middle of the shirt, a design that has been reprised many times since.\nRed and blue are the colours of the city of Paris with white alluding to the royal connections of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the city just outside the capital where PSG’s training centre and youth academy are currently based. The club’s badge features the Eiffel Tower and a cradle, representing the badge of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the birthplace of legendary French king Louis XIV.\nNot surprisingly, PSG immediately drew the support of the Parisians, who finally had a football club that could contend for domestic trophies. Shortly after earning promotion to Ligue 1 in 1972, the club moved into the legendary Parc des Princes, which would serve as their home to this day.\nThe early 1980s saw PSG win their first major trophies by claiming back-to-back French Cups in 1982 and 1983 and consequently trying their luck in European competitions, although they failed to advance past the quarter-final stage, reaching the last eight of the Cup Winners’ Cup quarter-finals in 1984.\nUnder Gérard Houllier, PSG claimed their first French top-flight title in 1986. With a side featuring French internationals who had won the European Championships in 1984, they went unbeaten over the last 27 games of the campaign to pip FC Nantes to top spot by just three points.\nThe arrival of TV company Canal+ as a shareholder in 1991 did much to change the face of PSG. Ex Newcastle United star, David Ginola, along with Bernard Lama and George Weah, were among the big names that arrived in the capital, and unsurprisingly with that sort of talent, success followed.\nIn addition to claiming their second Ligue 1 trophy (1994), three French Cups (1993, 1995, 1998) and two League Cups (1995, 1998), PSG became the second French club to win a European trophy by defeating Rapid Vienna in the 1996 Cup Winners’ Cup final.\nThese golden years were followed by a period of relative decline until 2011, when the club was bought by Qatar Sports Investments who have had phenomenal domestic success.\nBearing in mind David Beckham inspired PSG to only their third League 1 title in 2013, after winning the league again in 2023, with 11 League 1 titles to their name, PSG surpassed Saint-Étienne’s record haul of 10 French titles.\nSuccess on the domestic front had not been matched by success on the continent until last year however. PSG’s quest to win the Champions League had seen them spend record-breaking sums on star players, but it took considerable time for that investment to pay off.\nDespite smashing the world transfer record in 2017 when they paid Neymar’s €222 million release clause to acquire the Brazilian from FC Barcelona, and spending a further €180m to pair him with the French international Kylian Mbappe a year later, the closest PSG had come to winning the Champions League was in the 2019/20 campaign, when they reached the final, but were beaten 1-0 by Bayern Munich in Lisbon, with Kingsley Coman (ironically an ex-PSG player) scoring the winner in the 59th minute.\nDespite winning ten French titles in the eleven years prior to last season, PSG had failed to get beyond the Round of 16 of the Champions Cup on five occasions with that solitary appearance in Lisbon in the final of 2020 being the only time they’d progressed that far.\nHowever, that all changed in the 2024/25 campaign.\nAn inauspicious start led to a 15th place finish in the Swiss league, PSG losing three of their opening five group games before a late rally saw them win their final three games, including a 4-2 win at home to Manchester City. In the play-off, Paris saw off fellow French side Brest, winning 10-0 on aggregate before a succession of English clubs were put to the sword.\nLiverpool were beaten on penalties at Anfield (a few days before they lost the 2025 League Cup Final), Aston Villa were despatched 5-4 on aggregate in the quarter finals, before Arsenal exited the competition at the semi-final stage, PSG comfortably winning both legs against the side from north London to set up only their second appearance in the final of Europe’s most prestigious club competition, this time going one step further by landing the big cup.\nThis is who we’re up against tonight, the defending champions.\nBut, we’ve played this lot very recently and after last week’s convincing win over PSV Eindhoven, United stand on the brink of automatic qualification to the last sixteen. To do that, we’ve got to get all three points in the Parc de Princes and that will be extremely difficult.\nAvoiding the qualifying round has got to be the objective, especially given the fixture congestion and you never know, where there’s a will, there’s often a way.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
