The 32-year-old was let go by the Blues at the end of the season.\nWright has previously been mentioned in connection with West Ham, Crystal Palace and Charlton.\nThe former England keeper is reportedly seen as back-up with one of Shay Given or Joe Hart the first choice and the other expected to be sent out on loan.\nMeanwhile, former Town striker Sam Parkin is training with St Johnstone after being released by Walsall and is expected to sign for SPL side, while ex-loanee Giovani Dos Santos has been linked with a move from Spurs to Blackburn.\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nCome on, the chance to go to a Man City and earn a lot of money, I think most people would go for that\nPerhaps City think he is good enough to play if needed and in the meantime could add a lot to the young goalkeepers whilst there as a coach ,shame we didnt think the same\nAnd as soon as the one they keep is injured, the other one will be recalled from his loan club and Wrighty will be back on the bench again. He might be given a few Europa League games, of course.\npromise!\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
