However, rather than capitalising on having an extra man, Tottenham sank deeper and deeper into their own half and invited pressure.\nCristian Stellini’s side were unable to string more than a handful of passes together and slowly wilted under 10-man Everton’s press. Once Lucas Moura evened up the numbers, it seemed inevitable Everton would equalise.\nAn issue highlighted during the contest was Tottenham’s inability to retain and recycle the ball in the congested middle area. Indeed, Stellini himself bemoaned Spurs’ lack of ability on the ball in his post-match assessment.\nThe lack of a creative outlet in midfield who can turn on the ball and act as the bridge between defence and attack is an issue that has plagued Spurs all season.\nHowever, according to the Daily Mail, Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, plans to solve that problem through a transfer that could cost around £60m.\nREAD MORE: Tottenham transfer talk prompts top Bundesliga midfielder to hesitate over signing new Dortmund deal\nTottenham turn to James Maddison\nThe newspaper states that irrespective of who the club’s next permanent manager will be, Levy fully intends to sign Leicester playmaker, James Maddison.\nThe England international, 26, has been one of very few bright sparks at the King Power this term. Indeed, the Foxes are currently languishing in 19th and would likely be bottom if not for Maddison’s 15 goal contributions in just 21 league matches.\nThe Mail report Levy is ‘eager’ to bring Maddison to north London, and his potential arrival could also go some way to convincing Harry Kane to sign a new contract.\nReporter Ben Jacobs previously stated Leicester hope Maddison will commit his long-term future to the Foxes. However, Jacobs added that is a scenario that looks unlikely at present, while Maddison is virtually guaranteed if they’re relegated.\nWhat’s more, his contract is due to expire at the end of next season, meaning there’s pressure to cash in while Leicester still can this summer.\nMaddison is therefore likely to be on the move, though Tottenham will face stiff competition for his signature from Newcastle.\nREAD MORE: Tottenham revive transfer plans for Serie A signing Conte would’ve loved as sellers drop €20m demand\nNewcastle to up the ante for Maddison\nIndeed, Sky Sports reported the Magpies lodged multiple bids for Maddison last summer. The biggest was worth £50m, though Leicester did not play ball.\nNewcastle again registered their interest in January, though it quickly became apparent Leicester would not sell while staring a relegation battle in the face.\nThe story is expected to be different at season’s end, and both the Athletic and i newspaper have confirmed Newcastle will try to make it third time lucky.\nMaddison is unquestionably the most valuable player in Leicester’s squad and if they avoid the drop, they’ll hold out for as much as they can get.\nGiven they previously rejected a £50m bid from Newcastle and Spurs are now primed to ignite a bidding war, Maddison may yet cost a sum closer to £60m.\nTransfer insider Dean Jones previously cited a £60m fee when outlining how far Newcastle are prepared to stretch for Maddison this summer.\nIf both clubs bid, the presence of Champions League football could be key.",
