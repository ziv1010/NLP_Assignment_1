  "body_text": "This Thursday, June 5th, the Spanish and French national squads will face off on an international fixture for the UEFA Nations League semifinal. Now, there is no doubt that the players on both sides will be focused on one singular thing: defeating their opponent and meeting Portugal on the final stage this Sunday, June 8th. However, there may be something else hanging in the balance for two young sensations who have dazzled us with their play all season long.\nDembélé’s numbers speak for themselves\nIt seems difficult to believe that a game featuring the young superstar Kylian Mbappe won't have everyone's eyes on him. However, it's his French national and former Paris Saint Germain teammate, Ousmane Dembélé who's been making waves in the football world the past few months.\n48 goal contributions for PSG (35 Goals - 13 Assists), Ligue 1 champion, Ligue 1 Golden Boot winner, Coupe de France champion, French Super Cup champion, Champions League champion and being named UCL Player of the Season are just a few of the accolades with which Dembélé has expanded his resume during his second season in Paris. This outstanding campaign has led to widespread belief that he's the clear front-runner to receive the coveted Ballon d'Or award this September in Paris. However, there is one player who may just get in the way of that.\nYamal’s breakout year\nI'm talking, of course, about Barcelona's explosive 17-year old right winger, Lamine Yamal. 43 goal contributions for Barcelona this season across all competitions (18 goals - 25 assists), on top of winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Supercopa de España is a campaign just impressive enough to compete with Dembélé elite play this season. There is a reason Barcelona just granted the winger a record-breaking multi-million dollar extension until 2031, which could lead to his earning up to €40 million a year. Yamal's football this year has been nothing short of exceptional, and the numbers show for it on and off the field.\nWith all this in mind, a conversation has sparked surrounding these two athletic phenoms and their encounter this Thursday for the Nations League semifinal. The public is anticipating both of these players to bring their absolute best play in one final showdown between the two favorites to win the most prestigious individual award in football.\nA young voice in the Ballon d’Or debate\nWhen asked whether Thursday’s match should influence the Ballon d'Or race, Yamal remained firm on his criteria.\n“I’m confident we will win on Thursday,” he said. “But whether we win or not, I would vote for the best player over the whole year. For me, it’s about consistency throughout the season. If people want to base it on one game, that’s their choice.”\nDembélé, on the other hand, has remained quiet in regards to the speculation surrounding the award. That's not to say he doesn't have his fair share or supporters who believe he should be the one to win the big one, such as his PSG teammate Marquinhos who rallied an \"Ousmane, Ballon d'Or\" chant during the french squad's Champions League victory celebration.\nAmongst those making Dembélé's case heard is also his PSG coach Luis Enrique, who made a point of endorsing him for the accolade during his post-game interview following their Champions League win: “I would give it, based only on how he performed in this final, to Ousmane Dembélé. That’s true humble leadership. I sincerely believe he deserves the Ballon d'Or — not just because of the goals or titles, but because of how he’s applied pressure all season long.”\nThe stage is set for what promises to be a dazzling evening of high-level football between the world's elite. Could Thursday's winner give us our first hint towards who will be crowned this year's best footballer? This is a question that only time will reveal the answer to.\nThe awaited semifinal between Spain & France takes place on Thursday 5 June 2025. Kick-off will be at 20:00 (BST), 15:00 (EDT) & 12:00 (PDT).",
