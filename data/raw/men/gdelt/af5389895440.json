Despite their exit from contention, Simba have redirected focus to domestic glory.\nThe club struggled to clinch the Tanzanian Premier League title over the past four seasons, and the management is determined to reclaim the championship.\nSpeaking before departure, Simba’s Media and Communications Manager, Ahmed Ally, emphasised the club’s renewed priorities ahead of the Angola trip.\n“Right now, our priority is to secure the Premier League title. This is the trophy we truly need, the one we are hungry for, and where we have the most to prove,” Ally said.\n“Focusing on the Premier League now is a strategic decision. While the Champions League offers international recognition, our recent performances have shown that our chance to advance further this season is limited.”\nSimba delegation to Angola comprises goalkeepers Djibrilla Kassali and Hussein Abel. Defenders are Shomari Kapombe, David Kameta, Nickson Kibabage, Anthony Mligo, Rushine De Reuck, Ismael Toure and Vedastus Masinde.\nMidfielders in the trip are Yusuph Kagoma, Libasse Gueye, Allasane Kante, Kibu Denis, Clatous Chama, Anicet Oura, Naby Camara, Hussein Semfuko, Morice Abraham, Inno Loemba, Elie Mpanzu and Neo Maema. The delegation also comprises strikers Seleman Mwalimu and Jonathan Sowah.\nALSO READ: How Simba, Yanga fuelled Tanganyika Independence\nSimba are set to take on Angola’s Petro Atlético on Saturday.
