It's not switching a light switch. It's not just a simple short-term fix. We have to walk to the right solution not run to the wrong one,\" he explained to the BBC.\n\"The short-term issue is we want to get into the Champions League. It's a two-to-three-season challenge to get the organisation and environment right, to get the performances on the field right and win football matches. That involves the design and structure of the organisation being correct.\n90min Man Utd WhatsApp channel\nLooking to keep up to date with everything happening at Old Trafford?

That says to me there is something wrong with the environment. It is not constructive for me to blame anyone, it's just a fact. My focus is on how I change that environment to get the best out of the coach and squad.\"\nRatcliffe went on to defend the Glazer family, who have been unpopular with fans throughout the 19 years since patriarch Malcolm Glazer instigated a controversial leveraged buyout in 2005, insisting it would have been easier for them to fully sell to the Qatari bid headed by Sheikh Jassim. He is refusing to look back at past failings is only interested in what lies ahead.\n\"I only know Joel and Avram and they are, despite what you might read in the press, very nice people, very courteous and they are avid supporters of Manchester United,\" Ratcliffe reasoned. \"I understand the frustrations and the anger [of supporters] but I am looking forward not backward.\n\"Try to be patient and we'll try to build Manchester United back to where it should be, which is as one of the very elite clubs in the world. The key to it working is the relationship we will have with Joel and Avram, which in my view is a very good and trusting relationship.\"",
