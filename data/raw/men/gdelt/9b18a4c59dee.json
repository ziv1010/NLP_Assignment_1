The home game we did very well, so for tomorrow we need a very good plan as well.\n“You have to defend him as a team. He’s a clever player, so don’t allow him to come into situations. He can have a big impact on the game.”\nAsked what makes Kane such a great striker, Ten Hag said: “First of all, the number of goals.\nHe’s just a great player\nErik ten Hag\n“And also his key actions (that) come to a goal, final passes as well. He’s just a great player, great personality as well.”\nThen pushed on whether he would fit in well at United, Ten Hag said after a slight pause: “I am preparing my team tomorrow for a game against Spurs.\n“He is one of the players but we have to face Spurs, so I don’t think about anything else.”\nUnited had already looked light up top before Cristiano Ronaldo’s acrimonious November departure.\nFootball director John Murtough told a fans’ forum the following month that “it’s no secret that we’re looking for a new centre-forward”.\nWout Weghorst joined on loan from Burnley in January to plug that gap for the remainder of the season, but Murtough said “the main focus remains on the summer window”.\nPlanning was well under way for that window before the curtain came down on 2022 and Kane is among the elite number nines United have been linked with.\n“I think we have to strengthen the team on more positions (than just striker) – for instance the depth in the squad,” Ten Hag said when asked about the need for a striker.\n“But don’t think about that in this moment. It’s not about that.\n“So far I think we have a great season so keep going, keep improving, keep progressing.\n“The team is doing so well and I think it’s enjoyable to be part of this team.\n“We have to keep the process going. We have good players, we have a great team, we have a great year but it’s only success if you keep going.”\nUnited won the Carabao Cup in February and have the FA Cup final against Manchester City to look forward to on June 3.\nThey are on course for a top-four finish but last week’s embarrassing Europa League quarter-final loss at Sevilla provided a reality check for Ten Hag’s developing team.\n“We know where Man United should belong, but the reality is we are not in that place\nErik ten Hag\n“Of course it would be great but in this moment we can’t dream for that,” the United boss said when the prospect of pushing for the title next year rather than the top four was put to him.\n“We know where Man United should belong, but the reality is we are not in that place, so, as a club, we have to work very hard to get back in that position.\n“So, don’t dream in this moment, be in the reality and make a good plan, strategy, but work very hard and be ready for every game.\n“I think we are in a good direction, but we have still a way to go. That’s also the truth.”",
