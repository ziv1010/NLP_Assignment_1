He spent the second half of last season on loan at Swiss side Grasshoppers.\nHe is now looking forward to making a name for himself at Vicarage Road and helping Watford secure promotion to the Premier League.\nIrankunda's move to Watford will be welcomed by Australian national team head coach Tony Popovic, who is reportedly a big fan of the Socceroos prodigy.\nPopovic has been vocal about his desire to see the talented teenager play regular first-team football and continue his development with the 2026 World Cup firmly at the back of his mind.\nWith the youngster now poised to prove himself at Watford, his development could align with Australia's World Cup hopes in a way that both fans and sports bettors should keep a close eye on.\nThe sportsbooks featured on comparison website AustralianBettingSites offer extensive coverage of the Championship. Irankunda's presence at Watford could make them a popular pick with punters.\nHis exploits in the Championship may also trigger increased wagering activity on the Australian national team ahead of their participation at the 2026 World Cup.\nThe Aussies are eager to progress to the knockout stage in North America and could be a good bet to achieve the feat if Irankunda has a good season at Watford.\nIrankunda could be Australia's trump card at the World Cup\nAustralia will head into the World Cup looking to prove that they deserve to rub shoulders with the global elites. But if they are going to pull that off, they need their brightest stars firing on all cylinders.\nPopovic has already made a stunning impact since taking over from Graham Arnold. The Socceroos have not tasted defeat under his leadership, but the World Cup is a different beast.\nIrankunda's move to Watford may not be headline-grabbing, but it could be one of the most crucial transfers of the year for Australia's hopes of enjoying a productive World Cup campaign.\nAfter sharpening his game during spells in Germany and Switzerland, the teenager's move to Watford comes with the promise of regular first-team football in a highly competitive division.\nIrankunda's European journey started with the prestige of Bayern, but his path to the first team was blocked by world-class names and fierce competition.\nHe trained with the senior squad and made the bench in Champions League and DFB-Pokal fixtures, but never got onto the pitch for Bayern's first team.\nAfter moving to the Swiss league on loan, Irankunda featured 19 times in the top flight, bagging a goal and three assists. His numbers may be modest, but they do not tell the full story.\nHe sparked into life in a struggling Grasshopper side and was the highest-rated player in his first seven games.\nIrankunda effortlessly imposed himself in difficult circumstances. The teenager was directly involved in 40 percent of Grasshopper's goals in his early weeks at the club.\nHe is electric on the counter, his ball striking ability is outstanding, and heis not afraid to take on a defender in 1v1 situations.\nIrankunda netted 16 goals during his A-League days with Adelaide United, and many of them were screamers from outside the box.\nHe has already been capped five times by the Socceroos and needed just two games to open his goalscoring account.\nIt is easy to see why he has been touted as one of the biggest talents to come out of Australia, and he has all the necessary attributes to be the ace up Popovic's sleeve at the World Cup.\nThere is still plenty of time before the Socceroos take to the field in the United States, Mexico and Canada, but the building blocks are being laid now.\nIf Watford's new signing stays healthy, continues developing and thrives in England, he could arrive at the World Cup as a genuine attacking weapon.\nHe could even have the oddsmakers on the sportsbooks listed on australianbettingsites.net.au running for cover in the Golden Boot market.\nFor a country that dreams of going beyond the round of 16 for the first time ever, he could be the difference-maker when it matters the most.\nGamble responsibly.
