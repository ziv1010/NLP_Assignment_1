Suffice to say, an already incredible season could go down in the history books as one of the best ever with a victory on American soil.\nIn-game leader Dan \"apEX\" Madesclaire took some time during the tournament's media day before Stage 3 kicks off to share his thoughts on several topics concerning the European squad, from having to navigate tricky best-of-ones in the opening day, to the pressure such a feat can produce, facing Legacy in the first round, and comparing the pressure and state of Vitality when they won at the Paris Major in 2023 to now.\nYou can listen to this interview on Spotify.\nLet's go back to where you left off, which was, of course, winning a trophy, and then your buildup to here. You had some time off and you're starting from Stage 3 now. You've been able to watch what's been going on here and you've had some time to disconnect and prepare. How has that transition been?\nFor us it has been kind of easy because Dallas was not a priority for us, even though we won it. We arrived in Dallas with four days of practice because we took a week off before, so the goal was to take maximum rest after BLAST Rivals and then come into Dallas... Not with the least practice possible, but with not that much practice, just to recover for the Major, in a way.\nWe got to Dallas, not in the best shape, but in the end we won it. That was a pretty crazy ride, once again. I'm happy that we got better after each game, and then, yeah, we had time to go home. We didn't take that much rest, we went to practice almost straight away. I think we took a day off plus the travel day, but, yeah, we had a few days at home, then a bootcamp, and we had time to watch the other stages.\nCrazy things happened, mostly when you look at Falcons and the way they exited the tournament, but that's also how tough the Major is and how tough the best-of-ones are because what happened to them is that you miss one day and then you get so much pressure. Then you tend to not play your game and think too much about whatever happens. That's what happened to them. If they were 1-1, I promise you it would have never have happened. I'm pretty sure about that.\nThat's the scary part of the Major, and we've only been playing best-of-three and best-of-five the whole year, and now we have to play best-of-one, so Volvo maybe wake up? It would be nice to have something different because it's too random, in a way. You lose pistols, you lose one forcebuy, and then it's almost GG. It's been tough to watch others, but that's how the Majors work now.\nYou say you didn't take much time off and got straight to work. Was it in the back of your mind to not get cold, to make sure you stay on?\nEverything was planned. The way we've done our recovery moments during the year was almost all planned at the beginning of the year. That we had one week off after Katowice, one week off after BLAST Lisbon, and one week off after Rivals. Then we could just do Dallas, prepare again, and be as fresh as possible because I'm not sure that many teams had as much rest, like us.\nFor us, the goal was to be as fresh as possible arriving at the Major, but also sharp because we couldn't take too many days off after Dallas because we had to prepare here. To be as ready as possible, even though, in a way, I would prefer playing better and better after each game and if we go to playoffs, still do the same, but the best-of-ones are really rough and you need to get ready as fast as possible, so if we're so good in the best-of-ones, I won't complain about that.\nWe've moved away from best-of-ones in other tournaments, and now you have this streak that's built on series, so what have you done to change the chip and get ready for these best-of-ones? Is there anything you've done during preparation to be ready for this?\nWell, of course you have to focus a lot on your pistols, but we all know that pistols can be a bit random. They can go from one kill or whatever, it's a bit tougher than other rounds, so we try to focus on that but you never know how it can be.\nIt's more, I think, on the mental side that we talked about. Even though we're not that focused on the winstreak, the sure thing that I mentioned with the guys is that, yeah, we can finish the winstreak on a best-of-one, which is crazy in a way, but that's how it works. Even though we don't really care, that's just on the back of your mind and you're like, 'Ah, it can happen.' But it's not something important for us, it's just being ready mentally to fight in these best-of-ones and give our best and not get into the trap of, 'Yeah, it's fine, it's the beginning of the Major,' or whatever.\nWe don't want to get into a situation like Falcons because it's really difficult to come back from. Twice I've gone 0-2 at Majors. Once I came back, the other I didn't, but you also just waste a lot of energy, so I think losing one best-of-one can be okay, but not losing two. That's for sure!\nSo at least 1-1 after the first day...\nThat's the minimum I want!\nWe brushed over the streak and this whole thing going, and you've already talked about it saying that one day you'll lose, but just the fact that you're in this dominating season, a historic season that is already going to be remembered... But this Major can elevate it to a whole new level. Is that something you've talked about? How to deal with just having that in your mind while you're here?\nOf course. The main thing we talked about is that we're coming to the Major as one of the biggest favorites ever, or the biggest favorite ever, and that's not easy. That's not easy to handle. That's a talk we had, for sure, because you need to talk about those things because for sure it's in the back of your mind. It has to be.\nSo yeah, we know that, and the way we want to tackle that is a luxury. Imagine how many teams would love to be in our shoes, even though it's not easy to handle. It's not going to be easy, for sure, but we're ready for that.\nFor us, these six trophies have been wonderful. Even if we don't win the Major, the first part of the season is already a success, that's for sure, but the Major is the most important tournament, that's what we want to win, that's what big players need to achieve, etc.\nWe also have two Major 'virgins', so to speak, who have never won, and it would be wonderful for us to bring them their first. But yeah, we're ready mentally, for sure, although you never know what's going to happen.\nWe've shown some really good resilience during the year and the only thing we have to do is not overthink if it's a Major or what. We need to reflect about how we play CS, and the way we love to play CS, and the way we're good at playing CS. If we do that and we don't focus too much on everything around it, I think it can be a really successful Major for us.\nIf we take out the format stuff, the best-of-ones and that, is there something you've seen as the biggest threats to Vitality going all of the way?\nWhat we've seen from Vitality since the beginning of the year is that, if we play our A-game, no one can beat us. That is what has happened. Even when we play our B-game, it has been difficult, but when we play our A-game, the finals have ended 3-0, the semis have ended 2-0, and really one-sided. So we know that we can control that, we can control everything towards that.\nIf we play our A-game, the whole tournament, I tell you now that we will win the Major. There's no doubt about that, but of course, it's not sure that we'll play our A-game and we've seen a lot of champions that don't play their A-game the whole tournament and have tough runs. So for us, it's going to be to handle those moments, how to not be scared that it's too close and to still play our game, and to still fight and believe and play with our DNA, with the way we used to play — that's going to be the big thing.\nAnd, of course, you never know what can happen from the other big dogs, from MOUZ, Spirit, Aurora, The MongolZ, as well, they've been playing well, you never know what can happen from them, so for us, the first part is trying to bring our A-game, and then just focusing on that. But yeah, there are other threats, for sure.\nOther than the Falcons thing, which was a big headline, were there other things you noticed as you were watching? Other interesting little bits or any teams you learned about or anything like that?\nThe thing you see at every Major is that you see upsets. Maybe even more than at other tournaments. Why? Because there's a lot of pressure. There's a lot of pressure. It can go both ways. The first way is that the smaller team is already happy to be at the Major. They have their stickers, they have everything, so now for them it's a bonus. They will play with patience, they'll really want it, and be without pressure. That's the first thing you see at every Major. It's the 22nd, yeah? And we've seen it from the beginning.\nThe second is that the team that wants to perform at the Major, that has been doing everything since the beginning of the year to be able to perform at that moment, ends up struggling sometimes. We can see that at every Major, and of course we see Legacy playing very well, beating FaZe 2-0, coming from Stage 1 and getting better and better... Because those guys weren't supposed to come here, for them it's a full bonus, and they play super well. That's deserved, in a way, but that's just something you need to accept.\nOf course they'll have less pressure than us, that's normal, and that's just the way of competition. But for me, that's what I've seen, but I'm not going to focus on that. Just watching the tournament, I started having pressure at home. But that's normal. In Paris, I probably had the most pressure I've had in my career so far. It's just about the way you handle it. Personally, and I know my team, we're ready to handle it. I'm pretty sure that's not going to be a problem.\nHaving the Major at the end of the season is exciting because it ends the season and you play the whole season to reach this moment, but for a lot of teams it can be really hard. There are teams that are dead and making changes, and teams that are coming in at bad points, that peaked earlier and are now tired. How important was it for you to have this preparation and what do you make of the end-of-season Major?\nFirst of all, that's a good thing, to have the Major at the end of the season. That's how it works in sports, big tournaments are at the end of the season. In football you see a lot of teams being good in winter and when the Champions League playoffs arrive, they drop off. It happened to PSG for a long time while this year they got better after each game and just got better from August to May.\nI don't know about the strategy, it's not that easy to have because if you're in our shoes, we're going to give our best at every tournament, but sometimes it wasn't the goal to win before coming. Of course, when you're at the tournament, you're going to give your best, that's normal, but before it wasn't, and you still went. So when people ask me that we maybe peaked too early, I answer them: 'Yeah, but it's not something we can control that much, sometimes.'\nIt's something that's out of our hands, if we feel good or we're a step ahead in the strategy, we know how to answer every move in the game, etc. and as the meta shifts a bit and you don't have time to make the small changes, then yes, after that you're a bit behind and you lose games. It's really tough to peak at the right time.\nIn 2023, in a way, it was a bit lucky to arrive in Paris in our peak. We got worse and we could change something, but if you're good, you want to be good straight away. I've never played in a team that says, 'Okay, this year we start and we just want to make the playoffs...' That's not how it works. The strategy can change on some teams, but it's not easy.\nWhen I look at Falcons, for example, if I look back at the season, if I were them, what I would have changed is that I think this is their tenth event this year. That's a lot. They also stayed in the US after Dallas to bootcamp, so it's like, 'How exhausted are you?'\nThat's something we don't see that much in other sports because they don't do as much as we do. Like, for them, it was like 15 out of 20 weeks away from home. That's a lot. People don't understand that when you're at the hotel, when you're not home, you don't rest the same.\nFor some teams, maybe that's how they should handle things, but it can be really scary with the VRS points, so I'm not the genius saying what you need to do, but I think that some teams have different perspectives and we had our own and we were also lucky to win because we didn't have to play 10 or more events this year. It's our eighth event, that's the minimum we could do, and we've done well.\nA lot of it is also about the psychology of the game, especially talking about the pressure of coming here, and the pressure of the Major. What would you say is the most important thing now for CS players in this aspect?\nFor me, the best way to handle all of that is to focus on the things you can control. So the thing I can control is the way I can prepare for the event, the way I'm going to call at the event, the way I'm going to behave, the way I'm going to communicate... The result, the aim I'm going to have, all of that is things I can't control. I don't know if I'm going to be good today, but I'm ready to not be good. I really try to focus on the things I can control and the others, shit happens. I can't do anything, anyway.\nSometimes you feel a lot of pressure and there is a round or a moment that you feel pressure and you just need to tell yourself, 'Yeah, that's part of it.' And also, people think of pressure in a bad way, but it's also a really good thing because it's an emotion and without emotions we wouldn't be scared and we'd run through highways and die, so it's good, if these emotions are there it's because it matters and it's an important moment. But the way you need to handle it, and also with time, this pressure can transform into good adrenaline, so you think that you need to perform.\nThat's why, for example, I always feel much better on stage than I do in the studio because that's where I want to play, that's where I feel the best, and with the experience I have, I know how to handle things, and I think it's the same for most good players and veterans because we've handled it for a long time. For me it's never been, if it happens, to say, 'I'm being pressured right now,' I found a way in my brain to put it away. To not think too much.\nI could feel when I was younger that sometimes you think about pressure and it stays there for hours, like, 'How am I going to handle that? How am I going to do that?' For me, now, it's like, 'Yeah, I have pressure. Accept it. Get away.' It's going to be here during the whole tournament anyway, so I'm fine with it.\nYou spoke of Legacy and how they're playing with no pressure because they weren't even supposed to be here, and then they went 3-0. So they're probably coming into this game excited, thinking that it's a best-of-one and maybe they're the team to break the streak. What do you make of this situation, the super favorite that hasn't lost against the team that didn't even qualify and then made their way to Stage 3?\nI know it's going to be a tough one because of the best-of-one, first of all, and because they've played two stages and we've played none, so they already know the environment and we don't. They've already gotten more confident, and of course we're confident, but it's a best-of-one and if we start 0-5, it might be a different way.\nFor me, the way I take this game is like it's a Major and you should never underestimate anyone because of everything I told you before. It's just about giving my best, not underestimating anyone, and play the game as if it were the final or whatever and see how it works. The sure thing is that I'm going to prepare for them as I would prepare any game against a top-tier team.\nI'm going to give my best to play against them because we could see that if we say, 'I'm not going to give my best today,' you'll lose because they get some confidence and players these days are very close to each other in those departments. It's going to be a normal game, a big game. I'm going to give my best, and try to beat them to start our journey 1-0 to already feel good and get some good confidence coming into the second game.",
