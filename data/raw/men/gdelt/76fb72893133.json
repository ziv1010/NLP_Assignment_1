Game over.\n\"When Mark made the point in the sheds that we hadn't made the semis of the Australia Cup, that lit a fire in me,\" Dobson said. \"I wanted to take this opportunity and take us through to the semis.\"\nDobson's first senior goal was far from a tap-in. He ran on to an Eli Adams through ball, took a touch away from his defender before sliding a shot past keeper Filip Kurto at the near post.\n\"Eli and I have a really good connection on the pitch,\" Dobson said. \"As soon as it went into him, I knew I had to get to the next line, and he would find me.\n\"When he bounced it into me, I didn't have any other thoughts than to touch and shoot.\"\nThe Jets will meet newly crowned Victorian NPL premiers Avondale in the semi-final at Avenger Park, Melbourne on Sunday at 3pm.\nAuckland City tackle Victorian NPL giant killers Heidelberg in the other semi in Melbourne on Saturday night.\nThe winner of the Australia Cup earns a place in the AFC Champions League Two.\nHowever, New Zealand is a member of the Oceana confederation, meaning Auckland are ineligible to compete in Asia.\nIf they win the Cup, the other finalist would take their place in Asia and pocket $462,000 for competing in the group stage.\nTeams that make it out of the group stage receive a further $123,000. Prize money increases with every knockout stage. The winner collects $3.8 million.\n\"It is not a different game for us in terms of our mentality,\" Milligan said ahead of the clash with the semi-professional Avondale.\n\"We showed that against [NNSW NPL club] Cooks Hill, with the attitude we took into the game.\n\"It will be no different next week. Avondale have done fantastic in the Cup and have just won their league as well.\n\"It will be a challenge for us. It is the first time a few of our boys have travelled [interstate]. There are a few things there.\n\"We want to be a team where the occasion doesn't affect the way we go about our work.\"\nDobson is among a host of young players Milligan has used in the Cup run.\nCentre back Max Cooper has played every minute, while Christian Bracco (right back) and Xavier Bertincello (left wing) have started in the past two games.\nOscar Fyer, Alex Nunes, Ethan Debono and Lucas Scicluna have also been given game time.\n\"Mark has instilled confidence in every player,\" Dobson said. \"He has put faith in the young boys. A few of us have been starting. Max Cooper has come in and been unbelievable.\n\"My confidence is growing. I am feeling better and better every day.\"\nMilligan has been impressed with Dobson and all the young players in the squad.\n\"Dobbo is an attacking midfielder, we want our attacking midfielders to be brave,\" he said. \"We want them to get in goal-scoring positions and positions to assist. That is what they love doing. That is why Dobbo is the player he is. He has done that all his life.\n\"It is up to us to help him grow in that department. Allow him to be himself while fitting into the structure of the team.\n\"Like most of the young ones. He has a great attitude and a real desire to be a part of what we are doing. That is the biggest thing for me.\n\"He really threw himself into the way we train and the information that we give him. It's not just him, there are a lot of them.\"",
