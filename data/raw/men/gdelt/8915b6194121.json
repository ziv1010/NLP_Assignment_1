Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nThe Spain international had loan spells at Real Madrid and Bournemouth before completing a £5m move to Arsenal last summer.\nHis game-time in north London always looked limited given Raya’s status as one of the best goalkeepers in the world and Arrizabalaga has made just two appearances this season, both coming in the Carabao Cup.\nAsked whether the 31-year-old shot-stopper made a mistake joining Arsenal, Gunners legend Dixon told Metro on behalf of OLBG: ‘Yeah, I couldn’t believe he came.\n‘You would need to ask him what his reasons were because I don’t know. I don’t know why you would, at his stage of his career, make that decision.\n‘He’s never going to play. He’s only going to play if David Raya gets injured. So why would you want to do that?\n‘I guess all players are different and he might have a different mindset. There might be something going on personally that he needs to be settled in the area, I don’t know.\n‘But from a football point of view, it didn’t make any sense to me whatsoever.’\nAt the time of his move from Chelsea, Arrizabalaga was hailed as the ‘best value signing of the summer’ by Arsenal legend Charlie Nicholas.\nShaun Wright-Phillips, meanwhile, questioned Chelsea’s decision to sell Arrizabalaga given Enzo Maresca’s goalkeeping issues at Stamford Bridge.\nRobert Sanchez remains Maresca’s No. 1 at Chelsea despite making several errors and attracting criticism from a number of pundits over the past 12 months.\nDiscussing his move to Arsenal, Arrizabalaga said: “I’m really, really happy to be here, really excited and looking forward to what is coming.\n‘The ambition that is shown in this club, when I talk with Mikel [Arteta] and Inaki [Cana], how much they show me their desire to win… I think we are so close to winning and, hopefully, altogether, we can achieve it.’\nSpeaking last month, Arrizabalaga also revealed he spoke to Arsenal star and ex-Chelsea forward Kai Havertz ahead of his move across London.\n‘In the first month or so you have to settle into the surroundings, off the pitch as well if you have family, but I’m used to this,’ he said.\n‘Also we have had a few new players this summer, so we can all share our thoughts on some of the new situations for us.\n‘There are some Spanish players that I know from the national team, and that’s really good, especially in the first week.\nMore Trending\n‘I knew Kai as well; he’s been a big supporter for me. We chatted a lot during the summer.\n‘He was on holiday with [Arsenal captain] Martin Odegaard so we had that time to chat and share our thoughts about things.’\nFollowing an emphatic north London derby win over Spurs, Arsenal’s attentions now turn to the Champions League and a huge clash with Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich on Wednesday night.\nArsenal and Bayern are two of only three teams with a perfect record in Europe after four group games.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Man Utd on alert as Crystal Palace star’s contract talks stall\nMORE: Man Utd 0-1 Everton: United booed off after woeful defeat to 10-man Toffees\nMORE: Frank Leboeuf backs three Chelsea stars to ‘kill’ Barcelona in the Champions League",
