The problem in this case is that Salah isn’t a once-elite player. He’s still elite now.\nRealistically, he can aim higher than Besiktas – and that’s before even considering the financial aspects of the deal.\nElsewhere in his interview, Yucel revealed that Besiktas have just £226,600 in their budget – which is less than Salah earns per week at Liverpool.\nAnd while Yucel has confirmed Besiktas’ ‘need’ to sell some players, while hoping for two or three loan signings in January, it seems they would have a mountain to climb in order to be ready to accommodate someone like Salah – unless he’s willing to do them a favour, which would appear to be incredibly unrealistic.\nIt sounds like Yucel knows it, too, which is why he was strict in saying any move for Salah would be in the ‘dream’ territory.\nLatest Liverpool FC transfer news\nSalah is one of three Liverpool players with a contract expiring in 2025, but you know that by now.\nInterestingly, though, one of the others has also just attracted a new suitor, since reports are claiming Real Madrid now have a rival in the race for Trent Alexander-Arnold.\nBut even if the right-back doesn’t move to Spain, Liverpool might not be safe from a Real Madrid raid, since the reigning Champions League holders are said to be plotting a move for one of Arne Slot’s midfielders.\nThough it’s not all doom and gloom when it comes to transfer rumours for the Premier League leaders, since some potential signings are being spoken about as well.\nIt’s been explained why there is hope for a U-turn from midfield target Martin Zubimendi, while Liverpool are planning an opening bid for a highly-rated Premier League forward.",
