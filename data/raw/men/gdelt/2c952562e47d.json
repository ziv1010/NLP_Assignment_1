Both Andijon and Arkadag have a game in hand as they look to leapfrog the Bahrainis on the standings to earn a spot in the knockout stage.\nMeanwhile, in Muharraq’s stand-off against Wasl, Edimar Ribeiro da Costa Junior put the visitors ahead after only two minutes with a goal from the centre of the box off a through-ball from Portuguese teammate Elliot Jorge Simoes Inacio. But Wasl’s Nicolas Gimenez was on target in the third minute of first-half stoppage time to send the match into the break level at 1-1.\nMuharraq were back in front just four minutes after the re-start when Inacio struck from the centre of the penalty area following an assist by Brazilian Arther Rodrigues Rezende. The Emiratis were then able to secure a share of the points when Adryelson headed home off a cross after a corner kick.\nWith the result, Muharraq stayed second on the Group B table with seven points – three behind leaders Wasl, who have played a game less.\nMuharraq are back in action against Esteghlal FC of Iran on December 24 at home in their final fixture of this stage.\npatrick@gdnmedia.bh",
