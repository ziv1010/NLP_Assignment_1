He claimed United tried to sell him to Saudi Arabia last summer, stated United’s directors lack ‘courage’, and insisted he doesn’t feel valued.\nFernandes is a long-standing target of the Saudi Pro League, but as mentioned, he’s still a world class operator and has plenty left to give in the upper echelons of European football.\nThere is a clause in his contract at Man Utd that stipulates non-Premier League sides can sign the playmaker if bidding £56.6m.\nAnd rather than move to the footballing wilderness of Saudi Arabia, the i paper touted a blockbuster move to Bayern Munich.\nThe German giants have shown a propensity for spending heavily on big-name Premier League players who are very much in the second halves of their careers.\nBayern bought Harry Kane from Spurs when aged 30 and Luis Diaz from Liverpool aged 28. Both players – Kane in particular – have been roaring successes at Bayern who are among the favourites to win the Champions League this season.\nA move to a major European power who always compete in the Champions League and practically come with a guarantee of winning major trophies every season could be just what Fernandes needs after over half a decade of frustration in Manchester.\nThe i paper concluded: ‘A move to another top European club is not out of the question, even at his age. Bayern Munich remain potential suitors, The i Paper understands.\n‘The German giants are not afraid to sign established names who are far from young – they paid £87m for 30-year-old Harry Kane in 2023.\n‘It is understood Fernandes’ contract includes a clause that would allow him to join a club outside England for £57m.’\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?
