  "body_text": "Manchester United are reportedly interested in a blockbuster move for Florian Wirtz but there is acceptance at Old Trafford that a deal will be difficult with the continent’s elite clubs also in the hunt for the German international.\nWirtz, 21, has emerged as one of the standout stars across Europe after propelling Bayer Leverkusen to a historic season last year, winning the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal Cup without losing a single game.\nThe attacking midfielder returned an impressive 18 goals and 20 assists across all competitions while being crowned as Germany’s Player of the Season, with his work-rate and tenacity off the ball matching his incredible abilities on it.\nInterestingly, Leverkusen achieved this remarkable feat under Xabi Alonso with a similar tactical set-up to Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford with a 3-4-2-1 system, utilising two number tens behind an out-and-out striker – with Wirtz operating in this attacking midfielder role.\nDie Werkself have not been able to replicate the dizzying heights of last season in this year’s campaign. But Wirtz has remained an essential cog in Alonso’s machine, scoring 15 times and providing a further 13 assists with three league games left to play.\nThe 21-year-old is firmly in the category of ‘elite’ young talents in Europe, alongside the likes of fellow German international, Jamal Musiala, (Bayern Munich), Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), and Pedri (Barcelona), among others.\nBut unlike his competitors, Wirtz has not joined one of Europe’s ‘elite’ clubs. And this is why he is the primary target across the continent this summer with a growing acceptance at the BayArena he will leave.\nGerman football expert Florian Plettenberg reveals Bayern Munich are leading the race for Wirtz with a belief that the 21-year-old “wants to join them in the summer.”\nBut Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Barcelona have also been linked with a move for the attacking midfielder, though it remains unclear if each club could afford the price Leverkusen are said to be demanding – around the £110 million mark.\nSpanish journalist Jorge C Picon (Relevo) contends the total package for the transfer will be worth between €110 million and €150 million (£93.5m-£130m) – an exorbitant price, even if a talent like Wirtz does not come around often.\n💣 El objetivo número uno del Bayern de Múnich para este verano es Florian Wirtz. Otros jugadores han sido ofrecidos pero tienen claro que quieren al futbolista del Leverkusen con el que ya negocian, como avanzó @Plettigoal.\nSobre el precio, calculan que se tendrán que gastar… pic.twitter.com/kcFoOFzIWm\n— Picón (@JorgeCPicon) May 1, 2025\nTranslated Tweet: “Bayern Munich’s number one target this summer is Florian Wirtz. Other players have been offered a move, but they are clear that they want the Leverkusen player, with whom they are already in negotiations, as @Plettigoal reported.\nRegarding the price, they estimate that they will have to spend between 110 and 150 million euros. The contract expires in 2027.\nManchester City also want him, and United are keeping an eye on him, although they have fewer options. As for Real Madrid, signing him this summer is practically impossible, even if the club and Xabi Alonso like him.”\nPicon states Bayern and City are both interested with the Bavarian club having designated Wirtz as their “number one target” this summer. He also reveals Madrid have been ruled out of the race as the price tag makes a move “practically impossible”.\nBut Picon also reveals United are “keeping an eye” on developments, indicating Old Trafford officials would be willing to strike if the opportunity, however unlikely, arose.\nThe reporter concedes the Red Devils “have fewer” options than their rivals, suggesting the finances involved may be too steep, as well as the prospect of no Champions League football and the state of the team’s fortunes – currently languished in 14th in the Premier League – being potential deterrents to a move for Wirtz.\nHowever, the German international is tailor made for Amorim’s system and offers the potent pairing of creativity and goal-scoring United have been desperately deprived of this season.\nINEOS moved heaven and earth to secure a similarly highly-regarded youngster, ahead of elite European competition, last year in the form of Leny Yoro. The fact that United are keeping a watchful eye over developments at Leverkusen suggests they may wish a chance to repeat the trick this summer.\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
