There are things I can't explain right now because I'm at Madrid and I want to respect the shirt.\n\"From 26 May onwards, I'll be Brazil's coach. It's a very important challenge, but I want to finish the final stretch of this fantastic adventure here well.\n\"I never had problems with Real and never will have problems with Real. It's a club that lives dearly in my heart, but everything in life has a date to end.\n\"I couldn't be Madrid's coach for the rest of my life. It comes to an end for many reasons. The club may need a new impetus. I'm not making a big deal out of it.\n\"A thousand thanks to this club. And we'll carry on. I'll always be a Madrid fan. It's the end of an era. Spectacular. I never thought I'd coach Madrid for six years, and now it's happened.\"\nOn Madrid not issuing a statement, he added: \"Madrid will release a statement whenever it wants. There is no problem whatsoever and they'll do it when they deem it appropriate.\"\nDuring two spells with Real Madrid, Ancelotti has won 15 trophies, including three Champions League titles.\nLast season, he led them to a Champions League and La Liga double, but is set to finish this campaign without silverware.\nReal Madrid exited the Champions League in the quarter-finals, lost the final of the Copa del Rey to Barcelona, and sit seven points behind Hansi Flick's side in the league with three matches remaining.\nReflecting on his time at Madrid, he said: \"I always kept in mind that one day it ends. I've had a great time, and I think everyone has, but there comes a time when it ends. Football is like life; something begins and ends.\n\"I've had a great time. We've won a lot and it will be a memory for life.\n\"The day I arrived [for the second time], if they told me I'd win 11 titles in four years, I'd sign it with my own blood. It's been an unforgettable time.\"\nLatest Stories\n-\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n22 minutes -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n47 minutes -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n49 minutes -\nNSA introduces dual authentication system for 2025/26 enrolment exercise\n2 hours -\nFuel prices to increase from Feb. 16, influenced by cedi’s depreciation\n2 hours -\nGNFS to launch automated fire safety compliance system to modernise regulation\n3 hours -\nNALAG president commends Local Gov’t Minister for payment of assembly members’ allowances\n3 hours -\nIs having a physical security operations center in your business worth it?\n3 hours -\nAsiedu Nketia recounts fierce political wars in Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam constituency\n3 hours -\nNRSA sets up committee to probe road crashes involving Toyota Voxy\n3 hours -\nCocoa farmers decry the adverse impact of producer price cut on livelihoods\n3 hours -\nFamilies who lose relatives to ‘no bed syndrome’ must sue health facilities – Dr. Nawaane\n3 hours -\nGhana Sports Fund: Dr. David Kofi Wuaku outlines vision for Youth Empowerment growth through sports\n3 hours -\nNUGS President urges sustainable digital governance\n3 hours -\nNational Investment Bank kicks off Ghana Sports Fund with landmark seed donation\n3 hours",
