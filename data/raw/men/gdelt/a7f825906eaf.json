Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘But in those wide areas he has got plenty of options and the fact he could bring Madueke and Martinelli off the bench against Villa at the weekend and then start them tonight and see both of them score brilliant goals is a real positive.\n‘More and more, Madueke looks like a really smart signing. I already thought he was a loss to Chelsea, but you are seeing now he is back from injury that Arsenal can have Saka off that right side, or use him – it bodes really well for them with such a busy period coming up.\n‘Madueke was a constant threat off that right-hand side tonight. He likes to come inside and get shots off, and got the second goal by attacking the far post too, which pretty much sealed the game.\n‘Gabriel Martinelli was not so effective off the left but still got a really good goal and overall it was a really good evening for Mikel Arteta when you consider how stretched his squad is and how tired they looked at the weekend.\n‘So for Arsenal to win away like this in the Champions League is a great result for them.\n‘In the first half there wasn’t really much in it, just the goal from Madueke, and Club Brugge had a few chances but even with Norgaard having to fill in at centre-half, they still looked quite steady.\n‘In the end though it was just about getting three points for Arsenal and avoiding any more injuries and they achieved both of those aims.\n‘They are still top of the Champions League and they still have a 100% record.\n‘They know they must be going through and they even have the luxury of maybe resting players now in their next game against Inter, which is exactly where Arteta wants to be.’\nAs Sutton mentioned, Arsenal have now all but secured their place in the knockout stages of the Champions League.\nThe Gunners reached the semi-finals last season before losing to eventual winners PSG, but look an even bigger threat in Europe this term.\nSpeaking after Arsenal’s win over Club Brugge, Madueke said: ‘The first goal was really nice, second a tap in but the first one was sweet. We’re delighted with the result.\nMore Trending\n‘I think the bare minimum I need to give to my team is threat. Obviously trying to score and be as decisive as possible, that’s the next level I need to get to in terms of being consistently decisive for club and country. I think I can reach that level.’\nAs well as being the best team in the Champions League, Arsenal have been the best in the Premier League, boasting a two-point lead at the top of the table despite Saturday’s defeat at Aston Villa.\nAsked what he believed Arsenal could achieve this season, Madueke added: ‘We’re fighting on all fronts.\n‘I feel like we can win this competition and win the league, that has to be the aim. We’re in a good place at the moment.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Two Chelsea summer signings ‘frustrated’ with Enzo Maresca\nMORE: ‘No question’ – John Arne Riise makes bold Liverpool and Man Utd prediction\nMORE: Real Madrid make decision on sacking Xabi Alonso after Manchester City defeat",
