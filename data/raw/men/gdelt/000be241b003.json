having already signed Ben White and Leandro Trossard in the last two seasons - by persisting with a move for the Ecuador international, with the Seagulls clearly reluctant to part with their star.\nThe 31-year-old was not deemed crucial to Chelsea's squad, as they look to make room for incoming Argentine wonderkid Enzo Fernandez, who is reportedly close to joining the Blues from Benfica.\nJorginho's style of play may not on paper be a direct match for that of Arteta's league leaders, but he does bring a wealth of big-game experience and success in some of football's biggest tournaments.\nThe Gunners decided to accept Brighton 's resistance to selling Moises Caicedo (above)\nArguably one of the biggest fears of the club's fanbase, was the athletic ability of the incoming Italian compared to that of Partey, whose work-rate has been key in their title bid.\nBut a closer look at the statistics highlights that Jorginho in fact covered more ground on average than both Partey and Arsenal's first-choice option Caicedo since the start of last season - and by quite a margin.\nThe 31-year-old covers an average of 11.1km per 90 in the Premier League, with Partey down at 10.5 and Caicedo at 10.2.\nChelsea were open to selling Jorginho as his contract at the club was set to expire this summer and the potential arrival of Enzo Fernandez would push him further out of the picture\nJorginho outscores both Partey and Caicedo\nHe has also scored more goals (eight) than both Partey (four) and Caicedo (two), though all of them have come from the penalty spot.\nNevertheless, he has also made more passes, more forward passes and with a better accuracy than both Partey and Caicedo.\nPerhaps surprisingly, he has also won possession more times per 90 minutes (8.3) than Partey (7.3) and Caicedo (6.7), and betters Partey and matches Caicedo for both interceptions and tackles.\nWhile Jorginho is clearly a technician, any perception that he's lightweight in midfield is clearly not entirely true.\nThat said, perhaps the one worry for Arsenal fans will be the fact he has been dribbled past 1.9 times a game, more than Partey (1.1) and Caicedo (0.6), and has a lower duel success rate at just 52 per cent, compared to the Ghanaian's 54.2 percent and Ecuadorian's 57.8 per cent.\nJorginho played a crucial role as Chelsea claimed Champions League glory back in 2021\nMost watched Sport videos\n- Disgusting drink act caught on camera at ICC T20 World Cup\n- Tiffany Salmond dazzles in red bikini at Bondi Icebergs\n- Team GB Winter Olympics hero: Matt Weston wins skeleton gold\n- IOC President in tears after Ukrainian athlete is kicked out\n- NBA player makes long-awaited debut after battle with cancer\n- Team USA skier Breezy Johnson gets engaged after crash\n- Aussie snowboarder Scotty James shows off his dance moves\n- Has VAR broken football?
