The Jamaica Premier League champions Cavalier FC were said to have been fined by the regional governing body after their Concacaf Champions League game against MLS Club FC Cincinatti at the National Stadium in February due to dim lighting.\nThe Sports Ministry announced recently that new LED lights were to be shipped in from China but the Observer learnt they have yet to reach the island. In response, IPL borrowed lights and installed them for a final inspection on Tuesday night in hopes to meet the standards before today’s game. However, Concacaf’s venue coordinator Patrick Beckles confirmed on Wednesday that the match would kick off mid-afternoon.\nGeneral manager of Independence Park Limited Major Desmon Brown says he was stunned that the initial 6:30 pm time wasn’t approved after a successful inspection.\n“There was no Concacaf coordinator here last night. Concacaf asked us to get someone to do it independently; we got Phase 3 to do it and they reported that the quality was up to standard. Phase 3 sent that in but we were told that the decision was made previously. Phase 3 is their local broadcaster, so, and as far as they’re concerned, the quality was up to standard,” he told the Observer.\n“What I understand is that the decision was taken from Friday because they didn’t get a light report up to Friday. We were under the impression that the light inspection would have been [Tuesday] night and that’s what we were working towards and we met the standard, sent that report in but it was changed to 3:30 pm,” he added.\nHowever, speaking to the Observer, Ricketts says his federation was at the mercy of IPL and the Government and was gutted by the decision.\n“We have tried and a lot of people are going to blame the JFF, which is unfair. We had absolutely no control; we made every effort to have gotten everything in place for a 6:30 pm game,” said Ricketts.\n“We were instructed by Concacaf that the game had to be at 3:30 pm. There was a last-ditch effort on Tuesday evening to improve the lights and the truth is it has improved a little bit, but doesn’t meet the minimum standard for Concacaf to improve. From a commercial standpoint, from a marketing standpoint, from a standpoint of getting numbers in the stadium, we are very, very disappointed but the show has to go on.”\nRicketts says the JFF will miss out on significant revenue with many supporters expected to miss the match.\n“The commercial value would certainly be diminished, and I’m sure that we would have lost a couple million dollars,” he said.\n“The [ticket] sales up to last weekend wasn’t bad; I think it would have been better than most matches, so that would have given an indication that people are excited and people want to come out and support our World Cup qualifying campaign.”\nReggae Boyz Head Coach Heimir Hallgrimsson is also disappointed with the decision as it affects several aspects.\n“Of course the game probably will have a lower tempo in the heat, especially if it’s sunny. The forecast is a little bit cloudy or rain, so probably it will be okay for the players but it will of course affect how we play. But most of all, it’s a shame if people can’t attend the game, that will be the biggest shame of everything because people will be at work. I hope the persons in charge of the companies will allow the fans to come and leave work early to be in the stadium,” said Hallgrimsson.\nRicketts has also made a plea to businesses and organisations to allow their staff to attend the match.\n“I want to reiterate this is no fault of the JFF; don’t bash the JFF. We had absolutely no control of it; in fact, we tried. I still want to encourage those who can make it to make an effort and give us some support, but we will lose a lot of money,” he said.\n“I really want to apologise for the inconvenience that this may have caused to a number of patrons. I’m sure some persons would have wanted to come to the game and are not able to do so [now]. But I’d like to ask the private sector, as best as possible, to permit their staff who would want to come to the game to do so.”\nDespite concerns, UK-born defender Di’Shon Bernard believes the team won’t be overly affected by the change in time.\n“In England, you don’t know what to expect when you wake up in the morning; it could be rain, sun, heat or snow, so I’ll adapt to whatever. We’re all built to withstand whatever so I’m sure we’ll be fine,” he said.",
