  "body_text": "Ruben Amorim becomes Man Utd’s seventh manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired\nSir Alex Ferguson was manager at Manchester United for 27 years, but the club have now appointed a seventh full-time boss since the Scot retired in 2013.\nHere, the PA news agency looks at the record of those to have followed Ferguson ahead of Ruben Amorim taking over.\nDavid Moyes (June 2013-April 2014)\nP51 W27 D9 L15\nTrophies: 0\nMoyes was seen as the ideal Ferguson successor and handed a six-year contract but, after 11 years at Everton, he lasted just 10 months at Old Trafford, paying the price for a dismal campaign in which United failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1995. After years of further struggle at various clubs, Moyes rekindled his career at West Ham, leading the club to Europa Conference League glory in 2023 before stepping down 12 months later.\nLouis van Gaal (May 2014-May 2016)\nP103 W54 D25 L24\nTrophies: 1\nThe tough-talking Dutchman delivered the FA Cup in his second season, but United’s fifth-placed finish in the Premier League, coupled with criticism of his side’s ponderous style and lack of goals, led to his departure. Van Gaal returned to management in a third stint as Netherlands head coach in 2021, but quit after their exit from the 2022 World Cup and last year rejoined former club Ajax as an advisor.\nJose Mourinho (May 2016-December 2018)\nP144 W84 D32 L28\nTrophies: 2\nThe much-decorated Portuguese initially breathed new life into the club, winning a cup double in 2017 and securing a runners-up finish in the Premier League in 2018. However, his defensive brand of football did not delight fans and his abrasive character, with constant rumours about problems with Paul Pogba, affected the dressing room and results suffered before his sacking in December 2018. Mourinho was sacked after two and a half years in charge at Roma in January and, after being appointed as Fenerbahce boss in June, oversaw the Turkish club’s 1-1 Europa League draw with United in Istanbul last month.\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer (December 2018-November 2021)\nP168 W91 D37 L40\nTrophies: 0\nThe former United striker transformed the mood at Old Trafford after initially taking charge on a caretaker basis, winning 14 from 19 games to earn the job permanently. Solskjaer led United to third in 2019-20 and runners-up a year later, when they also lost the Europa League final on penalties. But despite the progress made, the 1999 treble hero paid for a series of poor performances when he lost his job in November 2021.\nRalf Rangnick (December 2021–May 2022)\nP29 W11 D10 L8\nTrophies: 0\nThe German was drafted in as interim boss with a view to transitioning to a two-year consultancy role, but never took up the extended job after accepting the post of manager of the Austria national team. Rangnick guided the club to a sixth-placed finish with their lowest Premier League points tally of 58 while all the time talking up the overhaul required to revitalise the club.\nErik ten Hag (July 2022-October 2024)\nP128 W70 D23 L35\nTrophies: 2\nDutchman Ten Hag arrived at Old Trafford with a formidable reputation having guided Ajax to three Eredivisie titles. He ended the club’s six-year wait for a major trophy when they lifted the Carabao Cup in February last year before leading them to a top-three finish and Champions League qualification. However, a miserable second season blighted by injuries and faltering form saw United exit Europe after the group stage and finish eighth in the Premier League, their worst ever return. They did beat rivals Manchester City in the FA Cup final to temper that but made a disappointing start to this term, where they sat in 14th place following defeat by West Ham when Ten Hag departed.",
