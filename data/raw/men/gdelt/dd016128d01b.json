  "body_text": "GOALThe Egyptian King's reign: Does Mohamed Salah deserve the 2025 Ballon d'Or?\nFew players in football history have combined individual brilliance with an unwavering impact on their teams quite like Mohamed Salah. The Egyptian forward has spent the last decade proving his class, yet, despite his dazzling performances, he has never claimed football’s most coveted individual award — the Ballon d’Or. As the 2025 edition of the award approaches, there is an undeniable case for Salah to finally lift the golden trophy. His statistics, records, and sheer influence on Liverpool this season paint the picture of a player at the absolute peak of his powers, one whose achievements should no longer be overlooked.\nThe Ballon d’Or, organized by France Football, has been the ultimate benchmark for individual excellence in football since 1956. The award recognizes the best player over the course of a season, factoring in their impact at both club and international levels. Over the last two decades, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have dominated the accolade, winning a combined 13 titles between them. With Messi now in the twilight of his career and Ronaldo no longer in Europe’s elite competitions, the door is wide open for a new name to etch itself in footballing history.\nWhile Salah has finished in the top ten of the Ballon d’Or rankings multiple times, he has yet to claim the crown. However, if individual numbers, record-breaking performances, and team success are the defining factors, this should be the year that changes.\nSalah’s numbers this season have been staggering. At the time of writing, he has already racked up 30 goals and 22 assists, with months still left in the campaign. These are not just empty statistics; they are game-changing contributions that have defined Liverpool’s title charge.\nHe has shattered multiple records along the way, reinforcing his claim as one of the most dominant players in world football. Salah became the first player in Premier League history to record 40+ goal involvements in two different seasons and the first to register 25+ goals and 15+ assists in a single campaign. He also set a new mark for scoring and assisting in 11 different Premier League matches, a feat unmatched since Lionel Messi in the 2014/15 La Liga season.\nBeyond domestic competition, his impact has been equally impressive in Europe. On 10 December 2024, Salah scored his 50th Champions League goal in Liverpool’s 1-0 victory over Girona, further cementing his legacy as one of the finest African players to ever grace the competition. Just a month later, he registered his 100th assist for Liverpool, showcasing his evolution into a complete forward who excels in both scoring and playmaking.\nEvery Ballon d’Or winner must face stiff competition, and Salah’s biggest challenger for the 2025 award appears to be Kylian Mbappé, who made a blockbuster move to Real Madrid. While Mbappé is undoubtedly one of the most electrifying talents in world football, his numbers this season fall short of Salah’s.\nLast year’s winner, Manchester City’s Rodri, would have been a strong contender had he not suffered an injury that effectively ruled him out of the race. With other usual suspects like Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham unable to match Salah’s all-around impact, the Egyptian finds himself in a prime position to claim the award.\nHistorically, winning major silverware has played a significant role in the Ballon d’Or voting. Liverpool’s resurgence under new head coach Arne Slot has put them in contention for multiple trophies, and should Salah lead the Reds to a Premier League or Champions League triumph, his case for the Ballon d’Or would become nearly irrefutable.\nThe last time a Liverpool player won the award was Michael Owen in 2001, and since then, legends like Steven Gerrard, Luis Suárez, and Virgil van Dijk have come close but fallen short. Salah has a golden opportunity to break that trend, bringing the Ballon d’Or back to Anfield for the first time in nearly a quarter-century.\nSalah’s potential victory would carry significance far beyond just personal glory. If he wins, he would become the first African player to lift the Ballon d’Or since George Weah in 1995. Given the immense contributions African players have made to world football, it is long overdue for one of the continent’s finest to be recognized at the highest level.\nOver the years, elite African footballers like Didier Drogba, Samuel Eto’o, and Sadio Mané have been in the conversation but never managed to claim the prize. Salah’s relentless excellence across multiple seasons makes him the ideal candidate to end that 30-year drought.\nSalah’s 2024/25 campaign has been nothing short of historic. His numbers rival the peak years of Messi and Ronaldo, and his ability to deliver consistently on the biggest stage separates him from the rest of the pack. If the Ballon d’Or is truly about recognizing the best player in world football over the course of a season, then there is only one logical conclusion — Mohamed Salah deserves to win the 2025 Ballon d’Or.\nFor too long, the Egyptian King has been overlooked when it comes to individual awards. This year, that must change. The Ballon d’Or belongs in Anfield, and Salah is the rightful heir to the throne.\nNo stories found.\nDaily Tribune\ntribune.net.ph",
