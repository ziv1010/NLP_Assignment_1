  "body_text": "Aston Villa have been one of the busiest Premier League teams throughout the summer transfer window.\nThe Villains have signed eight first team players with Amadou Onana topping the list after the Belgian joined from Everton for a reported £50 million fee earlier in the window.\nHowever, despite splashing out well over £100 million on talent already, the team from the Midlands, according to Fichajes, are on the hunt for one more addition, and have identified Spurs’ Giovani Lo Celso as a player capable of ‘perfectly fitting’ into Unai Emery’s system.\nAston Villa in three-way race to sign Giovani Lo Celso\nEmery knows the Argentine well from their time together at both Villarreal and PSG and is keen to be reunited with him for a third time at Villa Park.\nLo Celso, 28, has just one year left on his contract with Spurs and is thought to be available for transfer should the Lilywhites’ £13 million asking price be met.\nAnd although Roma and Real Betis are also tracking the South American, the lure of Champions League football under Emery could be too tempting to turn down, and that fact alone makes the Villains strong contenders to seal the 28-year-old’s signature.\nDuring his time at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Lo Celso, who has represented Argentina on 57 occasions, has directly contributed to 18 goals in 108 games in all competitions.",
