Fortunately, our guide can help you watch every match from anywhere, examining both free and paid routes.\nWhile many countries charge for access, there are plenty of options for a free Champions League live stream for each matchday. The box below will show you various international options for watching in countries around the world. To get around region blocks, you'll need a VPN (virtual private network) to access them from overseas.\n- See also: Best streaming deals | Best sports streaming services\nUpcoming free Champions League live streams\nThere are some fantastic free Champions League live streams around Europe. You don't get every game, especially in the early stages, but we often get many of the bigger matches appearing in the list. If you're not in the channel's country, you can still watch by using a VPN to prevent the website from detecting your location and blocking you.\nThe VPN mimics the required country for your viewing device and lets you watch along for free. We've tested this ourselves for lots of live sports and TV shows.\nDon't have a VPN to watch the above options from abroad? Right now, there's a fantastic offer on one of our favorite VPNs we've tested and have been using for years for streaming and protecting our online devices. You can save up to 75% on the usual price of ProtonVPN. If you're unsatisfied, there's a hassle-free 30-day money-back guarantee. Sound good? Then get stuck in and enjoy these free Champions League live streams.\nHow to watch the Champions League with a VPN\n- Sign up for a VPN if you don't have one.\n- Install it on the device you're using to watch the game.\n- Set the location to the required overseas streaming service's country.\n- Create an account and sign in if required.\n- Enjoy the game.\nNeed a low-cost VPN packed with useful features and servers in 110+ countries? Then don't miss these ProtonVPN deals with a sizable 75% discount on a two-year plan at $2.49 a month. If you'd prefer a shorter-term, the one-year plan is great value too and only $3.99 a month. If you only want a rolling one-month deal, Proton is much cheaper than the competition at $9.99. All plans can be used across 10 devices at once and feature a great ad-blocker, split tunneling, and more security-conscious features.\nWhere to watch Champions League in the UK\nTNT Sport via the Discovery+ service (£30.99 a month) is the home of all Champions League action in the UK, minus one game a week, which will be shown on Prime Video instead.\nIf the idea of tracking another streaming service grinds your gears, you might prefer the simpler option of adding it to your Amazon Prime membership as an add-on. It's the same £30.99 a month, and you can cancel anytime. Watching it through Amazon Prime Video means you can enjoy Champions League live streams across more devices, as app support across TVs, consoles, and streaming sticks is much better for Prime Video than Discovery.\nThe Prime-exclusive matches during the league phase will focus on British teams. Here are the upcoming fixtures for 2025:\n- November 4: Liverpool vs. Real Madrid\n- November 25: Chelsea vs. Barcelona\n- December 9: Inter Milan vs. Liverpool\nPro tip: If you want a cheaper option than TNT, you might want to try Australia's Stan Sport, as you can subscribe with a UK bank account for half what it costs for TNT (we've tested this ourselves). You need a VPN to access the site and Champions League live streams outside Australia. It still works out cheaper, though. More details below.\nWhere to watch Champions League in Australia\nThe Champions League is a Stan Sport exclusive in Australia for the majority of the season (but the free service, 9Now, is also showing the final). So if you want to see the entire tournament, you'll need to sign up for Stan and then add Stan Sport as an add-on. The cheapest setup is $32 a month (for Stan Basic at $12 and Sport at $20). Better yet, it comes with a 30-day free trial first for the baseline tier - you'll still pay $20 for the Sport add-on from the off, though.\nStan Basic only streams in standard definition, but Stan Sport's content will stream in up to 4K, even when paired with this cheapest tier, so you might as well go Basic if you're just getting it for sport. However, if you want to check out the TV shows and movies too, HD is $17 a month/$22 for 4K (then add $20 for Sport). All are on rolling one-month contracts, so there's no long-term commitment.\nIf you're eying up this option via a VPN as a cheaper alternative to your country's Champions League streaming service, we can confirm it will work. We could pay with a UK bank card and have full access to the streaming service. You could also use a travel card like Revolut to pay in local currency so you don't get a foreign transaction fee from your bank.\nWhere to watch Champions League in the US\nThis is where 'soccer' being so far down the rankings of the most popular sports in the USA really pays off for viewers who want to enjoy the most prestigious competition in club football.\nEvery Champions League game is live streamed on Paramount Plus for just $8.99 a month or $89.99 a year.\nSo yes, you can opt for the cheapest Paramount Plus tier and still get the Champions League despite it not having CBS, as the games will run via separate feeds. If you have CBS already, you'll find it airs some games, but nowhere near as many as Paramount Plus, and rarely the best ones, in all honesty.\nParamount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime.\nCan I access Champions League on Paramount Plus with a VPN?\nYes and no. If you set up Paramount Plus while already living in the US and are traveling abroad, and want to keep watching, you're all set. A VPN will indeed let you tune in like you were still in the US.\nIf you have a non-US subscription, like in the UK, you won't be able to access the US version's content with those same login credentials via a VPN on the app or the US website, as they're essentially different apps and services in each country. Unlike Netflix, which will allow one login to work anywhere via a VPN.\nIf you're outside the US and want a US account, Paramount Plus has made it difficult for outsiders. That's because you'll need a US form of payment, and we've found international currency cards, like Revolut, don't count.\nWhat about PayPal? You'll need to create a US PayPal account, which must be verified by a US mobile phone number. So, if you can get around all this, you can enjoy the best value Champions League live streams in the world.\nNote: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services.
