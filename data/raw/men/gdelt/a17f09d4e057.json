This is a club every player in world football would love to join.\n“I have admired watching Manchester City for many years – so to now be able to play for the club is a huge honour and a privilege. I cannot wait to meet my new team-mates, the staff and the fans.\n“Playing at the Etihad Stadium will be very, very special for me. I am very excited for what lies ahead and can promise that I will give absolutely everything to try and help the club achieve even more success.”\nMeanwhile, Ederson has completed a move to Turkish side Fenerbahce following eight “amazing” years at City.\nThe 31-year-old goalkeeper leaves the Etihad Stadium having helped the club to 18 major honours during his time at the club, including six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, four League Cups and a Champions League.\nThe Brazilian also won the Golden Glove award three times.\nEderson told the club’s website: “I leave incredibly proud of what we have achieved together, and I am honoured to have worn the shirt so many times.\n“Under (head coach) Pep (Guardiola), we have dominated the Premier League and conquered Europe. It has been amazing.\nThank you, Ederson pic.twitter.com/r40KhhUn7r\n— Manchester City (@ManCity) September 2, 2025\n“I arrived in Manchester eight years ago full of hope, but I could not have predicted such a beautiful time together.\n“Playing for City has been the most special time of my life and I will always be a fan of this special club.”\nCity have also confirmed the exit of Swiss defender Manuel Akanji to Inter Milan on a season-long loan.\nCrystal Palace had earlier expressed an interest in Akanji, who joined City in September 2022 and was a key component of the side which won the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup treble in 2023, and the team which won the domestic title again in 2024.\nIlkay Gundogan has also left City for a second time, this time heading to Turkish giants Galatasaray.\n📸 İlkay Gündoğan, İstanbul’da! #GundoIsHere 🦁 pic.twitter.com/Prga2IFBpA\n— Galatasaray SK (@GalatasaraySK) September 2, 2025\nHis new club did not publish details of the deal but the Germany midfielder told the club’s website: “I’m very happy. It’s a proud day for me and my family. We’re very excited.\n“We’re very happy to be here. Hopefully, we’ll adapt to the team quickly, meet my team-mates and play some fun football.\n“It’s a great pride to be a part of the Galatasaray community. We’ve reunited. I’m looking forward to the moment I put on that jersey and step into the stadium.”",
