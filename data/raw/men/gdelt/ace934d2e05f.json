KHALID MUBARAK AL-SHAFI\nAl Rayyan players attend a training session yesterday.\nDoha, Qatar: Al Rayyan have struggled in domestic football this season, but they have a golden opportunity to make their mark on the continental stage.\nAfter suffering three consecutive defeats to Saudi giants Al Hilal, Al Nassr, and Al Ahli Saudi, the Lions roared back in the AFC Champions League Elite (West) registering two victories and as many draws to secure a place in the Round of 16.\nWith eight of 12 teams advancing to the knockout stage, Al Rayyan - currently eighth in the Qatar Stars League - sit sixth in the Elite standings with eight points, three behind fifth-placed UAE’s Al Wasl, who face Al Hilal today.\nTonight, Artur Jorge’s side will host Esteghlal FC at Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium, seeking a win to break into the top five.\n“Our focus is on finishing fifth in the standings. This is not about avoiding a specific team in the Round of 16, but because we believe we deserve to be in this position,” Jorge said at a press conference yesterday.\nAl Rayyan are bracing for a fierce battle against Esteghlal, who sit 10th with six points - behind Pakhtakor, Persepolis and Al Gharafa - and must win to ensure qualification.\n“We know we are facing a strong team with experienced players, and we must maintain the highest level of focus to achieve our goal,” said Jorge.\n“The team has great positive energy, and the fans push us to achieve our targets together. We are working on building a winning mentality and playing at home gives us an extra edge to claim three points and bring joy to our supporters.”\nAl Rayyan coach (left) Artur Jorge and Esteghlal coach Sohrab Bakhtiarizadeh during a press conference.\nAl Rayyan goalkeeper Paulo Victor emphasised the importance of teamwork ahead of their final league-stage clash.\n“It’s a crucial match for us. Our ambition is to finish in the best possible position, which is fifth,” he said.\n“My mindset is all about teamwork. I don’t focus on individual efforts - I am here to help the team and I will give my best.”\nEsteghlal coach Sohrab Bakhtiarizadeh, meanwhile, acknowledged the challenge of facing Al Rayyan on their home turf but remained confident in his side’s determination.\n“We know this will be a tough match against Al Rayyan, but we are motivated to secure the three points and advance to the next stage,” he said.\n“Our focus is on delivering a strong performance with a high fighting spirit.”\nBakhtiarizadeh praised Al Rayyan’s quality, saying his team must be at its best.\n“They are a well-organised side with high-caliber players, which means we must give our absolute best to claim victory. Winning is our only option,” he added.\nKick-off is set for 7pm.\n-\nStrong winds, blowing dust forecast from Sunday: Qatar Meteorology\n-\nMandarin Oriental, Doha celebrates dual five-star recognition at Forbes Travel Guide 2026 Star Awards\n-\nMinistry of Municipality launches 34 e-services for livestock sector\n-\nAl Attiyah, McInnes top times on Jordan Baja Prologue\n-\n‘Stability offers investment confidence as Qatar poised for further growth’",
