According to data from SiteMinder, the world’s leading hotel distribution and revenue platform, reservations at local hotels between 29-31 May are currently higher by 32% compared to bookings made over the same period last year.\nSiteMinder’s data further reveals that room rates have increased year-on-year in the lead-up to the final at Munich’s Allianz Arena, with the average daily rate (ADR) for stays during the period climbing by 10% to €265, from €241 last year. By contrast, the ADR in the preceding week was €56 lower, highlighting the spike in demand as the final game approaches.\nAdditionally, shifts in booking windows and lengths of stay reflect the impact of one of the world’s most anticipated football matches: travellers are locking in their stays at local properties earlier by 23 days, with the average booking lead time reaching 136 days, up from 113 days last year. Meanwhile, stays have shortened slightly year-on-year, with guests booking for an average of 1.57 nights, down from 1.83 nights over the same period in 2024.\nWe saw during Germany’s hosting of UEFA Euros last year just how positive its impact was on local hotels, and it’s pleasing to see that the Champions League is proving no different, offering valuable momentum at a time when hotels are navigating more complex market dynamics. With thousands of fans – both local and international – preparing to travel to Germany to see who takes home this year’s trophy, hotels are encouraged to fully embrace dynamic revenue practices that respond quickly to booking demand, whether through pricing or marketing strategies. For instance, longer booking windows give hotels more time to connect with their guests, creating opportunities to upsell and provide exclusive, personalised offers well before visiting fans arrive at the front desk. Andreas Kastl, SiteMinder’s Regional Manager – DACH\nAhead of the final showdown in Munich, the UEFA Champions League semi-finals will be played over two legs on 29-30 April and 6-7 May, with each of the qualifying teams set to host one match at their respective home stadiums across Europe. The venues will be confirmed following the quarter-final results.\nAbout SiteMinder\nSiteMinder Limited (ASX:SDR\" target=\"_blank\" data-symbol=\"SDR\" rel=\"noopener\">ASX:SDR) is the name behind SiteMinder, the world's leading hotel distribution and revenue platform, and Little Hotelier, an all-in-one hotel management software that makes the lives of small accommodation providers easier.
