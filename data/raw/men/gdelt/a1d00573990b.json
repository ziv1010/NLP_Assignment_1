Never forgotten.\nJohn Brennan\nDear Mag.\nI am one of the Newcastle United members that has to rely on match by match tickets.\nI have to say, I now approach the results of each ballot, the same as I do the national lottery.\nI still bother checking BUT have no expectation, or hope, of success.\nI honestly can’t remember the last time I was successful (in the NUFC ballots, not winning the lottery…).\nI think the last ballot was very early last season when I was successful in getting tickets. I have been to matches in between but only due to friends helping me out.\nI think it is shameful that the club refuse to be honest and transparent.\nThe Newcastle United owners refusing to tell fans how many members there are, how many (how few!) tickets are available each ballot, where all the tickets are going (I think schoolkids in Dundee was just the tip of the iceberg)?\nWhen the likes of NUST have carried out surveys and the results show how few times on average NUFC members are successful in ballots, the club have claimed that the figures are very misleading and not reflecting the truth. Yet they won’t make public what the truth is…about anything to do with ballots or number of members.\nMy experience with people I speak to who are also members, is the same as me, I don’t know anybody who is getting tickets even 10% of the tie in ballots.\nLD\nDear Mag,\nA surprising and slightly insulting question (Asked about rumours that Man U could approach him if/when sacking Ruben Amorim) at Eddie Howe’s pre-match press conference before the Forest game, highlighted how certain journalists, along with many fans, find it difficult to consider any change to what they see as the natural level of football clubs in England.\nWhy should Eddie Howe consider leaving behind all of the good work he and his team have done developing the club to where the are now – Carabao cup holders and competing in the Champions league – to instead join Manchester United, a club which currently do not have a managerial vacancy and in the not too distant past have carried out major behind the scenes cost cutting.\nEddie Howe is far too level headed to be tempted by what was historically a big name, thinking they have greener grass to offer.\nRegardless of the loony element, which all clubs have, who take pleasure in criticising everything the club do, the real supporters understand the great job being done and are 100% behind Eddie.\nAs supporters under the current regime, we need to be more glass half full and less glasses half empty.\nRob the exiled Geordie\nDear Mag,\nOne of my greatest frustrations watching the Mags, is the poor quality and wastefulness of our throw ins.\nDo they ever practice them?\nWe have a set piece coach now and I believe they (throw ins) should be regarded as having the potential importance as a free kick.\nMy gripe is that when we take a throw in, say near the halfway line, the thrower’s options are limited to our players around him standing statically, with an opponent hovering.\nNext game, watch and count how many of these throw ins are intercepted and any advantage lost.\nSurely they can devise some sort of coded system amongst themselves, allowing the ball to be thrown into open space for the knowing players to run onto, offering a speedy, deceptive and potentially attacking option.\nThe Gallowgator\nDear Mag,\n(ED: This obviously received before the 4-0 in Brussels)\nI first took my 3 year old son as a taster, as you do (was Sampdoria).\nHe lasted 75 minutes, was canny proud.\nHe came out of the East stand – ran down, fell over, tears falling. I was thinking, lots more tears there mind pet…\nScuffed knee, but you know what, at 3 years old it was there, he got it.\nI wrote in (to The Mag) about taking my bairn to the final against Man U, how proud I was taking him to a final.\nThen he went on his own with his mates to Wembley against Liverpool, I met him after, wow we celebrated, left his mother by the way…\nYou know what though, I’m going to Belgium with my bairn, to me he is still my little 3 year old who fell over on the cobbles outside the East stand.\nSharon Wilson\nDear Mag,\nHave to say, I thought a disgrace on Sunday, the club not having a proper tribute to Willie McFaul.\nThe players wore black armbands but why no minute’s silence?\nAbsolutely shocking.\nWhen you think how at times we have a minute’s silence for people who have nothing to do with Newcastle United, including royalty and suchlike.\nThe likes of Willie McFaul are our royalty, black and white royalty.\nWillie McFaul gave our club so many years of service, won the Fairs Cup, was then manager after Jack Charlton left us in the lurch and did a really decent job.\nYet not even a minute’s silence in tribute. unbelievable.\nW Davison\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
