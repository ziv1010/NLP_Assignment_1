It’s in the name!\nTop of The Tree : 25 December 2023\nChristmas Edition of the Daily Merengue\nShoutout to the mods who do a fantastic job, Valyrian Steel, Felipejack, Juninho, NeRObutBlanco and yours truly, Kung_Fu_Zizou\nIn the Christmas Edition we handout some flowers to some of the biggest influences of 2023\nVinicius Junior\nVinicius Junior has had to pick up more responsibilities with each passing season and last season he was tasked with leading the attack as Karim’s influence was diminished by lack of form and continuity.\nWhile he has been injured twice this season, a fit Vinicius Junior makes Real Madrid one of the most potent attacks in the game with his ability to make something out of nothing.\nHis numbers in the champions league continue to speak volumes.\nRodrygo Goes\nRodrygo came to the fore last season helping the team to the Copa del Rey trophy most notably and showing his ability to perform without Vini or Karim in the closing games of the season.\nWhile he struggled for form in front of goal initially, he’s turned it around and routinely helped the team comfortably overcome opponents to top both the champions league group and La Liga\nAnton Rudiger\nRudiger is a player who’s experience came to the fore when he shut out Erling Haaland at the Bernabeu.\nHe has since grown in confidence and played a large part in solidifying Real Madrid’s defence under difficult circumstances. He has played with Alaba, Nacho and Tchouameni and never looks out of place. One of the success stories of the season so far.\nJude Bellingham\nJude Bellingham is one of those players who comes around once in many generations. It would be easy to forget he has yet to win silverware with Real Madrid but he has put the team on his back like a veteran baller. His decision making and execution have been excellent. The quality he has displayed in terms of leadership, and tactical and technical ability on both sides of the ball. He makes his teammates better in both attack and defence.\nHe will have an opportunity to win his first bit of silverware with Real Madrid in the supercopa which could be the start of a trophy laden career at the Bernabeu.\nFOOD FOR THOUGHT\nReal Madrid after years of being accused of being too eager to rid themselves of older players have gone in the opposite direction and kept players way past their “sell-by date”.\nThe feelings are unrelenting when it comes to this topic. Real Madrid won the double in 2022. A memorable CL victory which will go down as the greatest CL run of all time. Real Madrid were underdogs from the Round of 16 all the way through the final and emerged victorious.\nThe idea here is that victory is vindication. Is victory vindication?\nThe Daily Poll\nPoll 1\nPoll 2\nPoll 3",
