The decision has already been made: there will be no loan in January if the current conditions are maintained.\n‘In return, the coach has promised him more minutes in the next few matches, especially in matches where the team needs to score.’\nREAD MORE ⚪🔵🟡 Four big strikers Leeds could sign as sources confirm links to Real Madrid, Championship stars\nXabi Alonso call on Gonzalo Garcia is sensible\nE-Noticies is a Catalan publication, so the report about Alonso and Garcia must be treated with a bit of caution.\nHowever, unlike many speculative reports from the Catalan media that often try to stir trouble at Real Madrid, like one that claimed that Los Blancos are not happy with manager Xabi Alonso, this particular one does have some merit.\nAs things stand, Kylian Mbappe, Garcia and Endrick as the three recognised strikers in the Madrid squad.\nMbappe is the number one striker at the Santiago Bernabeu and plays when he is fit and available, with Alonso preferring Garcia to Endrick to be the second choice.\nAs reported by the likes of Fabrizio Romano and The Athletic, Endrick is set to join Lyon on loan from Real Madrid in the January transfer window.\nWhile Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo have played as a centre-forward in their careers, both prefer to operate on the left wing.\nRodrygo’s future at Madrid is also in doubt, with Alonso using him to push Vinicius Junior to step up his game.\nMadrid should not let Garcia leave in the middle of the season and deplete their squad.\nGarcia showed at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the summer that he can lead the line for Madrid.\nLos Blancos could be in need of the young striker in the second half of the season when they are competing for LaLiga and Champions League glory, especially if Mbappe suffers an injury.\nHowever, at Madrid, the manager hardly ever gets the final say, and it will be interesting to see if what Los Blancos should Leeds make a big offer for Garcia.\nLatest Real Madrid transfer news: Man Utd offer, Liverpool raid\nMeanwhile, Real Madrid have responded to Manchester United’s offer for one of their star midfielders.\nThere is also speculation in the Spanish media that Liverpool are planning to raid Real Madrid for one of their top forwards.\nAnd finally, a Bundesliga midfielder wants to join Real Madrid in 2026, despite being aware of interest from Man Utd.",
