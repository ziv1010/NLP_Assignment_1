But what were the best Premier League shirts of all time?\nAs we welcome in a new Premier League season, we thought it would be fun to take a look back at the football kits that caught our eye from seasons past to decide the best Premier League shirts ever.\nBest shirts in Premier League history\nAfter much painstaking research, we can now reveal the definitive list of the greatest shirts worn in the Premier League, taking into account everything from the legendary players who wore them to just how stylish they look off the pitch, too.\nNewcastle United 1995-97\nWho made it? Adidas\nWhy is it great? An uncluttered design, a rarely seen grandad collar, Newcastle Brown Ale label on the front. A complete package, and that's before you even factor in the goodwill the club generated by having one of the most exciting teams English football has ever seen in the years wearing this.\nFond memories? Let's hope so. Fans remain bitterly disappointed they only finished second in both seasons wearing this, but considering the fallow years that followed, it will be hard not to look back on the kit fondly.\nBest to wear it? Alan Shearer\nGet exclusive shortlists, celebrity interviews and the best deals on the products you care about, straight to your inbox.\nArsenal 2005-06\nWho made it? Nike\nWhy is it great? It's clean, unique, boasting a different shade of red to mark the farewell of an iconic ground and was seen on the backs of some of the very best players to grace the Premier League. It also features a classic logo and looked unreal with long sleeves.\nFond memories? The 2005-2006 season was a bit of a bittersweet goodbye for Arsenal, as it was their last dance at the legendary Highbury, their home sweet home since way back in 1913. All that nostalgia, plus the deep connection to the beloved stadium, really made this kit something special.\nArsenal went on an incredible adventure that season, making it all the way to the UEFA Champions League final! Led by the one and only Arsène Wenger, they battled their way to Paris, taking down giants like Real Madrid and Juventus along the way. Even though they didn't quite clinch the win against Barcelona (losing a close one at 2-1), it was a truly historic run that captured everyone's hearts.\nBest to wear it? Thierry Henry\nFulham 2001-03\nWho made it? Adidas\nWhy is it great? The kit is particularly remembered for its clean and simple design. It was primarily white, a colour long associated with Fulham. Black and red accents, especially on the collar and cuffs, gave the kit a sharp, stylish appearance. The red and black contrast, along with the Pizza Hut sponsor on the front, made it distinctive among other Premier League kits of the era.\nFond memories? Fulham's 2001-2003 kit was there for a super exciting time – the club's big return to the Premier League after a whopping 33 years. They got promoted in 2000-01, and that kit became a symbol of all the buzz. It was an important couple of years for Fulham as they settled back into being a top-flight club, and it kicked off their journey of growing and developing in the modern Premier League.\nBest to wear it? Louis Saha\nPortsmouth 2003-05\nWho made it? Pompey Sport\nWhy is it great? The blue and yellow accents—such as the yellow collar and cuffs—gave the kit a sharp, modern look, further enhanced by a prominent sponsor logo. It stood out because it was a simple but effective design, particularly at a time when football kits were beginning to embrace more streamlined, minimalistic designs. The look became synonymous with the early Premier League years for the club.\nFond memories? A significant factor in the enduring appeal of Portsmouth's 2003-2005 kit is the club's return to the Premier League in 2003 after a 15-year hiatus. Following years in the lower divisions, the club, under the ownership of Alexandre Gaydamak and management of Harry Redknapp, secured its place in the top flight.\nThe kit from this era represents the renewed optimism and excitement of their Premier League return, embodying a period of significant progress for the club before what has since been a huge decline. The kit marks a better time for Pompey fans.\nBest to wear it? Yakubu\nBrighton and Hove Albion 2020-21\nWho made it? Nike\nWhy is it great? The 2020-2021 home kit was a real throwback, bringing back those blue and white vertical stripes that just scream classic Brighton. They were a bit wider and updated, making for a look that was both striking and timeless. And that collar? Chef's kiss! It completed the whole classic vibe.\nThe design was super clean, with the stripes running all over the shirt, blending those traditional club colours with a fresh, modern feel. It brought back memories of the old-school kits, but it also had a sleek, new look that everyone, new fans and old, just loved.\nFond memories? The 2020-2021 season was a pivotal one for Brighton in terms of their long-term future in the Premier League. After securing promotion in 2017, the club was entering its fourth season in the top flight and had begun to establish itself as a fixture in the Premier League.\nThis list wouldn't be complete without a modern Brighton kit, thanks to their overwhelming impact and influence on the top flight. The 2020-2021 home kit represents a period where Brighton was moving from being a newly-promoted side to a club aiming for mid-table stability and consistent performance at the highest level.\nBest to wear it? Yves Bissouma\nBournemouth 2022-23\nWho made it? Umbro\nWhy is it great? The AFC Bournemouth 2022-2023 home kit really pops. It's got this cool, dynamic design that mixes old-school vibes with a modern twist.\nThe main thing that catches your eye is the zig-zag pattern cutting across the chest and body. The red and black just bounce off each other, giving it an energetic look. That jagged pattern makes it feel like it's always in motion, which is perfect for any club.\nFond memories? AFC Bournemouth was back in the Premier League for the 2022-2023 season after being relegated a few years prior. They'd earned their spot through the 2021-2022 Championship play-offs. Their home kit for that new season really showed off how excited everyone was to be back in the top league – it was a symbol of the club's big comeback.\nBest to wear it? Philip Billing\nBlackburn Rovers 1994-96\nWho made it? Asics\nWhy is it great? A Blackburn shirt doesn't need much work to be great. Keep it simple and let the unusual half-and-half design speak for itself. Little touches of (Lancashire rose) red make it even more vibrant.\nFond memories? Rovers won the 1994-95 Premier League title wearing this, so fond is an understatement. Every neutral in the country wanted them to get one over on United.\nThe following season was less memorable: they finished seventh in the Premier League and bottom of their Champions League group. The astonishing on-pitch fight between David Batty and Graeme Le Saux took place while they wore their boring away kit, thankfully.\nBest to wear it? Alan Shearer\nCoventry City 1996-97\nWho made it? Le Coq Sportif\nWhy is it great? The typical Coventry kit since the 1987 FA Cup has been atrocious (anything from the Ribeiro oeuvre, Puma’s hoops) or bland. But this is timeless. Uses thick stripes and traditional colours, making the likes of Peter Ndlovu and even Dion Dublin look graceful and purposeful. These were heady days at Highfield Road.\nGood memories? They narrowly avoided relegation from the Premier League wearing this. We're sure that a 17th-place finish sounds pretty good to fans watching them in League One right now.\nBest to wear it? Gary McAllister\nManchester United 1992-94\nWho made it? Umbro\nWhy is it great? It changed the game. Umbro, having taken over from Adidas as United's kit supplier, made the bold step of adding a lace collar and a patterned fabric without it ever looking too busy. Within a year, everyone was looking to the past for inspiration as Sky beamed this instant classic into everyone's home every 30 minutes (or so it felt).\nFond memories? Wearing this, United won their first title since the 1966-67 season. With the monkey off their back, it began an era of domination we've not seen since and now must feel like a distant memory for fans.\nBest to wear it? Eric Cantona\nTottenham Hotspur 1999-2001\nWho made it? Adidas\nWhy is it great? The switch from hit-and-miss Pony to Adidas also coincided with the return of a classic sponsor: Holsten. The shirt has a cool retro-style collar with modern touches that have stood the test of time.\nFond memories? Meh. Mid-table twice and one decent cup run.\nBest to wear it? David Ginola\nWimbledon 1997-99\nWho made it? Lotto\nWhy is it great? This was Wimbledon FC (RIP) at their most established. A kit that didn't make them look like top-flight gatecrashers, but rather one of the big boys. Smart with no unnecessary features, this was more attractive than the (admittedly effective) football they played in this era.\nFond memories? Absolutely. In their first season wearing this, they finished eighth (just five points off UEFA Cup qualification) and reached the semis of both domestic cups.\nBest to wear it? Efan Ekoku\nWest Ham United 1999-2001\nWho made it? Fila\nWhy is it great? Fila doesn't make many kits over here, but when it does, they’re pretty damn cool. The thick blue arm stripe really pops and gives the whole thing a very modern edge. Nice sponsor logo, too. The 2015-16 kit by Umbro, the last to be worn at the Boleyn Ground, has the chance of overtaking this one, but for now, this reigns supreme.\nFond memories? They won the Intertoto Cup in this kit, so draw your own conclusions.\nBest to wear it? Paolo Di Canio\nIpswich Town 1992-94\nWho made it? Umbro\nWhat makes it great? A classic example of the faux-heraldic aesthetic pioneered by Umbro in the early days of the Premier League. As the new broadcaster added fireworks and cheerleaders (whither the Sky Strikers?), venerable British football brand Umbro sought to emphasise the heritage of the clubs it supplied, leading to this absolute peach. Red, white and blue, daring lace colour and iconic sponsor word mark: the best post-Uefa Cup shirt the Tractor Boys have worn.\nFond memories? Worn for two Premier League seasons, relegated in neither, so let's say yes.\nBest to wear it? John Wark\nLiverpool 1995-96\nWho made it? Adidas\nWhy is it great? No brand has made Liverpool look better than Adidas has (the Reebok kits were so, so boring; let’s gloss over Warrior) but narrowing it down was a challenge. We plumped for this effort, a radical departure from the previous few, all of which prioritised Adidas branding over the LFC aesthetic and were just colour-swap versions of the ones worn by the likes of Sweden.\nNotice the welcome return of the three-stripe arms and retro-inspired thick V neck alongside the Liverpool crest within an Umbro-style shield. It's actually a bit barmy but so was the club back then.\nFond memories? A mixed bag. Finished third but way off the top two. Reached the FA Cup final but lost (in their away kit) to Manchester United, who clinched the double. However there was that incredible 4-3 win over Newcastle, still considered one of the best matches in Premier League history.\nBest to wear it? Robbie Fowler\nArsenal 2010-11\nWho made it? Nike\nWhy is it great? Arsenal has probably had the most consistently good-looking kits since the Premier League’s inception, but this is the best of the lot. Inspired by those worn at Highbury in the Sixties and Seventies, this has a classy round collar in white and is a beautifully unfussy shirt.\nFond memories? Nope. This was worn during the League Cup final defeat against Birmingham City.\nBest to wear it? Cesc Fabregas\nLeeds United 1996-1998\nWho made it? Puma\nWhy is it great? This may not be the first shirt that comes to mind when you think of Leeds, but it should be. No shirt has ever pulled off the club’s classy colour scheme of white, blue and yellow quite so well. The later boom-and-bust teams wore very stark Nike kits, but this Puma effort has its own clean style while also boasting flourishes.\nFond memories? For the most part. They were mid-table in the first season of this shirt and a solid fifth – with UEFA Cup qualification – in the second, under new manager George Graham.\nBest to wear it? Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink\nNottingham Forest 1992-93\nWho made it? Umbro\nWhy is it great? Vintage Nineties Umbro on display here, as a slick pinstripe was added to the traditional Forest red. Note classic local brewery as shirt sponsor rather than Canadian interloper Labatt's.\nFond memories? Not really. They finished bottom in this shirt's only Premier League season (although it was worn in the Football League the following year as Forest earned immediate promotion). It's also notable as the shirt worn by Teddy Sheringham when he scored the first Premier League goal to occur live on TV.\nBest to wear it? Roy Keane\nCrystal Palace 1997-98\nWho made it? Adidas\nWhy is it great? For some reason, brands like to tinker with the Palace design. Frequently, the stripes are too wide, too red, too truncated or too faded. This strikes a perfect balance.\nFond memories? Yes and no. It was used in 1996-97 in the Football League and worn for the triumphant Playoff Final. But it was also in use for a Premier League season that saw Palace finish dead last.\nBest to wear it? Attilio Lombardo\nDerby County 1997-98\nWho made it? Puma\nWhy is it great? Teams that play in white generally have the worst kits, but the use of thick black elements elevates this to a spot in our top 20. Having the two chest logos on black backgrounds is simple but hugely effective.\nFond memories? Certainly. The club finished ninth, wearing this and just missed out on a UEFA Cup spot on the final day of the season.\nBest to wear it? Paulo Wanchope\nEverton 1993-95\nWho made it? Umbro\nWhy is it great? Before Chang came along, an Everton shirt didn't feel complete without NEC on it. Another early to mid-Nineties beauty from Umbro, with the badge in a regal-looking shield and patterns on the fabric.\nTheir kits went off the rails after this: black trim replacing white, NEC swapped for Danka and, in 1997-99, totally the wrong shade of blue.\nFond memories? Sort of. Both seasons, they were scrapping to avoid relegation, but they did win the FA Cup in 1995. Sadly, they didn't wear this shirt on the day.\nBest to wear it? Tony Cottee\nManchester City 2009-10\nWho made it? Umbro\nWhy is it great? It's one of the few club shirts under the 'Tailored By Umbro' banner, and it's a beauty. It takes design cues from the ones City wore from 1961 to 1975, and could only be improved by the badge being round. The club is, sensibly, set to reintroduce a circular design.\nFond memories? Up to a point. It was the first season they started to look like the City we know and loathe right now, but they failed to crack the top four this time.\nBest to wear it? Carlos Tevez\nChelsea 1993-94\nWho made it? Umbro\nWhy is it great? Because almost all Umbro kits of this era were impeccable. The esoteric collar and effective use of red as an accent combine with a wonderfully retro sponsor. We miss the Amiga. The 2015-16 shirt will probably reach cult status like this one has: a way of showing people 'I was supporting Chelsea when they were rubbish'.\nFond memories? Although they finished in the bottom half of the table, they did reach the FA Cup final for the first time in 24 years. But wearing this, they lost 4-0 to Manchester United at Wembley. It was enough to put them in Europe for the first time since the early Seventies, however.\nBest to wear it? Glenn Hoddle\nBurnley 2009-10\nWho made it? Errea\nWhy is it great? Just look at it. The retro-inspired beauty was a tribute to the Burnley team that had won the title 50 years earlier, and was able to showcase this achievement in the Premier League no less.\nFond memories? Just about. It was a great achievement for Burnley to reach the Premier League, especially in such a special anniversary year, but this should overshadow the fact that they got relegated.\nBest to wear it? Steven Fletcher\nAston Villa 1998-99\nWho made it? Reebok\nWhy is it great? If any club has struggled to look good from a sartorial perspective, it's Villa. There have been so many weak designs from the likes of Asics and Diadora in the Premier League era, so it comes as something when Reebok is the one that has made them look best. It's simple yet distinct, using plenty of blue. The rare use of white piping helps the colours stand out.\nFond memories? Not especially. They sold Dwight Yorke early in the season, yet were top at Christmas. They faded so badly they didn’t even qualify for Europe, some 12 points off a UEFA Cup spot.\nBest to wear it? Paul Merson\nWest Bromwich Albion 2005-06\nWho made it? Diadora\nWhy is it great? Quite what possessed Diadora to model its third West Brom shirt on those worn intermittently in the Seventies and Eighties is a mystery, but we're glad it happened. The wide stripes and proper collars are a revelation.\nFond memories? Certainly not. After failing to win any of their final 13 fixtures, the Baggies were relegated from the Premier League.\nBest to wear it? Nwankwo Kanu\n- Morgan TruderStaff Writer\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.",
