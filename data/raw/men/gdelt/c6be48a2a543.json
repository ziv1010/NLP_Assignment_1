I’m focused on Como, which is where I belong. I’m very happy and excited,’ Paz said in an interview with Spanish publication AS this summer.\n‘Maybe one day I’ll return to Real Madrid. I have no idea what the future holds. I don’t even know what I’ll do tomorrow!’\nFacing the media after Como’s victory over Juventus on Sunday, Fabregas said he believed in Paz just as Arsene Wenger did with him in his early days at Arsenal.\nMore Trending\nWenger was pictured in the stands at Como’s Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia to watch the match, with Fabregas revealing: ‘He came into my office with Thierry Henry beforehand.\n‘I thank him because when I was 16 he believed in me, just as I believe in Nico Paz.\n‘I am very confident about his [Paz’s] future because I can tell when a player has the mindset to become a top player.\n‘If he continues like this, he can go wherever he wants.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Arsenal vs Crystal Palace: Latest team news, predicted lineups and injuries\nMORE: Rio Ferdinand claims key Liverpool star will already be ‘doubting’ summer move\nMORE: Gary Lineker claims £64m star could cost Arsenal the Premier League title",
