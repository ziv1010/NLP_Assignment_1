This time our opponents scored and we didn’t. The result reflects how close the game was.\n“In the last two rounds, they had the home game as their second game, whereas it was the other way round for us. Now it’s a different and new scenario, we’ll have the crowd on our side in the second leg.\n“I would have liked to create the chances we have created, but you have to be effective to score. We’ll see what version we show in Paris.”\nDespite creating more chances after the break, PSG lost without scoring for the first time across all competitions this season.\n“We missed our chances in the second half,” PSG defender Achraf Hakimi told Canal+.\n“We knew what they were going to do, with long through balls. We were very focused, the coach repeated it all week.”\nPSG have progressed from two of their previous four Champions League knockout ties when losing the first leg, with the first of those coming against Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 in 2019-20.\n“We’ve come back from 1-0 down before,” added PSG captain Marquinhos.\n“We’ve shown that we can do it, especially at home, with the energy of our supporters, it’s going to be a different scenario. We know we can do a lot better. We just need to take our chances and be more decisive.\n“We conceded a goal that we shouldn’t have conceded, and we’ve been talking all week about these deep passes from this Borussia team. It’s the details that make all the difference, and we’re going to do better in the next game if we want to go through.”\nEUROPA LEAGUE\nMarseille 1-1 Atalanta\nRoma 0-2 Leverkusen\nAston Villa 2-4 Olympiacos\nFiorentina 3-2 Club Brugge",
