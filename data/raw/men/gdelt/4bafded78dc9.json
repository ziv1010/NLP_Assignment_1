I’ve met him a few times over the years with a few mutual friends and I think that he’s a fan and obviously he’s a great businessman as well, one of the best and one of the biggest.\n“But I think more importantly the fans see that he cares, and I think that’s a big part of it. I think obviously the fans had lost faith with the leadership over the years and obviously he really cares about what he wants to do and what he wants to create.\n“So, hopefully, things will change but these things take time.\n“I think we have been quite patient as United fans over the years but we want those good old days back. We want those days back and the sooner the better.”\nBeckham knows all about running a football club as he has been president of MLS side Inter Miami since it was founded in 2018.\nInter Miami, who signed Lionel Messi last year, have won this season’s MLS Supporters’ Shield – awarded to the team with the best regular season record – and will be targeting their first championship when the play-offs start later this month.\nThe former England captain said he looked to his old Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson for guidance when founding the club.\n“I went to him once and said to him, ‘I’m starting this team, how would you run it?’,” he added.\n“And he sat me down for a couple of hours and he told me what I should do and what players I should be looking for and how I should run the academy.\n“And that’s really what I’ve tried to do. And then I also learnt from people like (Real Madrid president) Florentino Perez. You know, with Florentino, he has this crazy vision of always bringing the greatest players to the club and building this unbelievable stadium.”\n:: Listen to the full Rio Meets Becks interview on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.",
