Just one defeat from their\nlast nine home games against Spanish teams suggests they’ve got a chance (W7, D1), although Monaco have lost each of their last seven home matches in the UCL, which means an unwanted piece of history awaits, as no side has ever lost eight in succession in the competition!\nThere’ll be no mercy on display from a red-hot Barcelona side who have surged to the La Liga summit by winning all five of their league games this term, scoring 17 goals in the process. Hansi Flick will have to cope without Dani Olmo for this trip though, with his new\nsigning ruled out for four to five weeks with a hamstring injury sustained in a 4-1\nthrashing of Girona on Sunday.\nPlayers to watch: The captain’s armband has inspired Monaco’s Denis Zakaria, who has directly contributed to three goals in his last two club appearances from defensive midfield (G2, A1), with both strikes arriving beyond the 80th minute.\nOnly Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have outscored Robert Lewandowski in the UCL. Eight of his 94 goals in this competition have come for Barça, though just one of them was the match opener.\nCredit: flashscore.com\nArsenal travel away to take on Atalanta\nAfter making it all the way to the quarterfinals in last term’s comeback campaign, Arsenal\nreturn to the Champions League on Thursday, as they meet Atalanta BC in Bergamo.\nArsenal finally ended a six-season absence from the Champions League last season, when they finished first in Group B – ahead of PSV Eindhoven, Lens and Sevilla – with four wins from six games.\nArsenal will therefore try to continue their continental renaissance this year, having negotiated their first four Premier League fixtures without losing – most recently claiming victory in Sunday’s North London derby.\nThe Gunners have conceded only one goal so far, while Gabriel’s match-winning header against Tottenham Hotspur was the 23rd time they have scored from a set piece since the start of last season.\nLeading into their midweek trip to Lombardy – which is swiftly followed by a high-stakes clash with title rivals Manchester City – Arsenal have won six straight Premier League away games stretching back to last term. They now aim to post maximum points on their travels once again, ahead of another tough test at home to Paris Saint-Germain next month.\nWith perfect timing, Atalanta celebrated completion of their newly renovated home stadium earlier this month, ready to welcome Champions League football back to Bergamo.\nAtalanta now take part in the Champions League for a fourth time, having featured for three successive seasons between 2019 and 2022, twice reaching the knockout phase.\nCredit: sportsmole.co.uk\nBayer Leverkusen kick off their campaign against Feyenoord\nAfter winning the German double and reaching the Europa League last season, Bayer Leverkusen are back in the Champions League this season and kick off their European campaign on Thursday when they visit Feyenoord.\nXabi Alonso’s side have won all their games this season, apart from a 2-3 defeat to RB Leipzig that ended Leverkusen’s unbeaten run in the Bundesliga after more than a year.\nKey player Florian Wirtz has started the season in fine form and took his tally to three\ngoals in three games in Leverkusen’s 4-1 win over Hoffenheim at the weekend. Nigerian\nstriker Victor Boniface got on the scoresheet for the first time this season in the same\ngame, firing home a brace and also picking up an assist.\nFeyenoord, meanwhile, have endured a tough start to the season as they try to adjust\nto life without Arne Slot, who has joined Liverpool. Under new coach Brian Priske, the\nRotterdam club have managed just one win and three draws in four Eredivisie games so\nfar this season. Most recently, they were held to a 2-2 draw by Groningen.\nTheir only previous meeting was in the last 16 of the 1987-88 UEFA Cup, when Leverkusen\nwon 3-2 on aggregate en route to lifting the trophy. Both teams should have a full squad at\ntheir disposal for Thursday’s game.\nCredit: bulinews.com\nAtl. Madrid host Bundesliga opposition RB Leipzig\nJust five months after being eliminated from last season’s UEFA Champions League (UCL)\nat the hands of Germany’s Borussia Dortmund, Atlético Madrid will kick off this European campaign with the first of two home games against Bundesliga opposition.\nMaking their 12th consecutive appearance in this competition under the tireless Diego Simeone, the Spanish giants are looking to go beyond the quarter-finals for the first time since 2016/17. No visiting side were able to take all three points home from the Metropolitano in the two previous UCLs, and Simeone’s side recently emphasised the strength they boast at home by scoring six unanswered goals in three La Liga outings.\nCombine that with an unbeaten home record against German clubs in any UEFA competition this century (W8, D4) and this fixture against both RB Leipzig certainly looks\nwinnable. Ironically, Atlético’s crosstown rivals Real Madrid were responsible for Leipzig’s departure from the last UCL in the round of 16 last season.\nThe Red Bulls should be full of confidence of at least reaching the knockouts again this time\naround after making an unbeaten start to the season (W3, D1), while they also won their most recent meeting with Atlético in when the pair met behind closed doors at the quarter-final stage in Lisbon back in 2020.\nLeipzig have proven themselves to be fearless travellers in the last couple of campaigns and cannot be taken lightly, even if this promises to be a stern test. Players to watch: Four of Antoine Griezmann’s UCL goals last season were scored at home, a tally he’s primed to add to after finding the net in their last two La Liga home victories.\nSimilarly, Loïs Openda scored in two away games in last season’s UCL, while his three competitive goals this term were all scored on the road.\nCredit: flashscore.com",
