It is difficult to accept, these type of things in the semi-final [FA Cup against Man City] two weeks ago it was handball and it was no penalty, the referee he didn’t check it.\n“It is painful as it has damaged English football and I think Villa players and their fans didn’t understand why the goal was disallowed.\n“They said it was foul and if you see the challenge what happened if we go into every single challenge like this it is going to be a foul and we wouldn’t finish the game with 11 [players].\n“We can talk about the performance or the decision – it is damaging the game.\n“I am calm and it is only to help. Now, we have to move on and it will be in the headlines with the disallowed goal.”\nFour days on from their horror night at Arsenal on Tuesday, where they lost 5-0, it looked like being another difficult evening for Chelsea when they fell 2-0 down at half-time to Marc Cucurella’s own goal and a Morgan Rogers strike.\nBut they rallied in the second half and levelled through Noni Madueke and Conor Gallagher goals before the stoppage-time drama.\nDespite blowing a 2-0 lead, Villa will see this as a point gained after looking leggy and below their best.\nThere was a lot going on today in the contest for European places…\n⚒️ West Ham hold Liverpool to a draw⚫️ Newcastle earned a resounding win against Sheffield Utd🔴 Man Utd could only finish level at home to Burnley🤝 Aston Villa and Chelsea play out an entertaining draw pic.twitter.com/VyTY1NBAIs\n— Premier League (@premierleague) April 27, 2024\nThey moved seven points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham in the race for Champions League qualification, but Spurs have three games in hand.\nUnai Emery’s men, who have a growing injury list and a Europa Conference League semi-final to contend with, will still be favourites for the top four as the London club have Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City still to play.\nThey suffered more injury woe as influential goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez went off at half-time with a hamstring issue, while Youri Tielemans limped off with a groin problem.\nEmery said: “Tomorrow we will test him (Martinez). And with the injury with Tielemans, we will wait for tomorrow. Hopefully not a lot.\n“Martinez is very important – that’s clear. He saves us a lot. But Robin (Olsen) saved us in minute 90 in a man-on-man against (Cole) Palmer.\n“We are very happy, even with the point we achieved today. Our way is to be consistent. And 35 matches with 67 points. Analysing the match, of course, for Chelsea were contenders to be in the top four, to have the difference we have in the table is good.”",
