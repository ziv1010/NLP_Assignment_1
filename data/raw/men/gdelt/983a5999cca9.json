But Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA.\nThe boss of world football's governing body was back in the White House this week, and sport wasn't even on the agenda.\nAnd yet it still came back to football and today's World Cup draw - even after the signing of a peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nMr Infantino was picked out in the audience as Mr Trump diverted from trumpeting ending another conflict to boasting about World Cup ticket sales.\n\"A great leader in sports and a great gentleman,\" the US president said.\nSo it's certainly not just Mr Infantino dishing out the flattery. But there is plenty of that, aligning himself with the MAGA agenda going back into the first term.\n\"Together we will make not only America great again,\" he said in January, \"but also the entire world\".\nThere is often bemusement when Mr Infantino pops up wherever Mr Trump is - from a Saudi-backed financial conference in Miami to an official visit to Saudi Arabia and the Gaza peace summit in Egypt.\nThere isn't a non-American with such prominent proximity to the presidency. And it's being used to shortcut decision-making for the World Cup, with direct access to the most powerful man on Earth to help smooth the tournament's delivery.\nMr Infantino knows how to chime with Mr Trump's talking points, recently telling critics to lay off the president because he has a mandate from winning the 2024 election.\n\"We should all support what he is doing because I think he is doing pretty good,\" Mr Infantino said.\nFor a man who was largely known a decade ago for drawing balls for the Champions League, the ascent to the peak of power has been rapid and only made possible by scandals knocking out presumptive leaders.\nIt will be a draw on Friday that cements this unlikeliest of bonds when the World Cup schedule is determined at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC.\nSo much has been done to flatter Mr Trump, to pander to his passions.\nThe one thing he craves more than anything is a peace prize.\nAnd after missing out on the foremost, illustrious Nobel version - despite an endorsement from Mr Infantino - FIFA created its own to hand out on Friday without any announced process for nominations or selection.\nAnd if there is one song to indulge Mr Trump with it is the unlikely YMCA. The 1970s disco group Village People have been hired for the draw ceremony.\nExpect the Trump dance. Expect the unexpected. Expect uneasy moments as Mr Trump takes centre stage alongside Mr Infantino.\nHow freewheeling will the presidential address become?\nAnd is it all too political, even for a football organisation rarely untouched by politics?\nIt has created awkward moments when Mr Trump has been disparaging towards Democrat-run cities attacked for not being safe.\n\"Gianni, can I say we will move (matches)?\" Mr Trump asked on live TV in the Oval Office.\n\"I don't think you're going to have this problem. But we're going to move the event to some place where it's going to be appreciated and safe.\"\nUsually FIFA dismisses questions about moving World Cup venues this late on, but Mr Infantino responded in part: \"Safety and security is the number one priority.\"\nUsually, FIFA would be working to ensure all fans can attend its tournament, but the governing body is not dissenting against the block on visitors from Iran and Haiti.\nThe rhetoric of Mr Trump - framed around security - collides with FIFA's idealism about uniting the world through football, with everyone being welcome.\nAnd this is not just about the US. For the first time this is a World Cup being co-hosted by three nations, even if Mr Infantino has paid more visits to just one of them.\nRead more from Sky News:\n88-year-old veteran given £1.2m to help him retire\nTrump 'never rules anything out' to ensure World Cup's safety\nBut the leaders of Canada and Mexico are due at the draw here in DC.\nThey'll hope the football ceremony provides some respite from Mr Trump's threats of a military strike on Mexico over drugs or deepening the trade war with Canada.\nThere is a peace prize to award, after all.\nA celebration of all things Donald Trump.\nAnd at some point, the teams will discover they will be drawn to play at the tournament next summer.\nBecause with Gianni Infantino it has to come back to football, the whole purpose of his role.\nEven if his political alliances can seem more prominent than what happens on the pitch.",
