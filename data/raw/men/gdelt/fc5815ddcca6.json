  "body_text": "Updated Aston Villa have now officially signed Amadou Onana from Everton in a deal that could be worth in excess of £55m.\nThe Belgian international agreed personal terms with the Midlanders on a long-term contract last week and completed the move to Villa Park over the weekend, the ground where he made his debut for the Blues in August 2022.\nThe transfer is reportedly worth £50m, with Everton negotiating an additional £5m in performance-related add-ons and a percentage of any sell-on fee..\nOnana was signed from Lille two years ago in a deal that would have topped £33m had all appearance clauses been met. The Ligue 1 club are due 20% of the profit made on the sale but it still represents a profit of around £26m on Onana's amortised book value.\nDavid Ornstein reported for the The Athletic that Onana, who was supposedly targeted by the likes of Arsenal, Newcastle and Bayern Munich, was keen on joining Unai Emery's project at Villa which will involve Champions League football this coming season following their fourth-place finish last term.\nHe makes the switch from Goodison Park to fill the void left by Douglas Luiz who was recently sold to Juventus and will link up with former Toffee, Ross Barkley who recently joined Villa in a £5m deal from Luton.\nOnana's transfer should also allow Everton to keep hold of star defender Jarrad Branthwaite this summer unless they receive an astronomical bid for the young defender who has been the subject of two derisory offers from Manchester United.\nThe news came on the heels of a suggestion by journalist Sacha Tavolieri that Onana had turned down the offer of a three-year contract from Saudi League side Al-Ahli, indicating his preference to remain in the Premier League.\nReader Comments (296)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Disclaimer ()\n1 Posted 13/07/2024 at 10:27:57\nProbably would have given his mate Levy a few million quid to sweeten the deal as well!\n2 Posted 13/07/2024 at 10:55:57\nMany a true word said in jest, Col.\n4 Posted 13/07/2024 at 11:01:27\n£50M for Onana. What did we pay for him?\n6 Posted 13/07/2024 at 11:15:30\nTypical Everton, only this time it probably makes sense just for that spot kick alone against Fulham.\n7 Posted 13/07/2024 at 11:22:28\n8 Posted 13/07/2024 at 11:23:05\nI've no doubt he will slot seamlessly into a Champions League team and help Villa stay in and around the Top 4. Good signing for them.\nLille get 20% of the £20M profit so we make £16M on the player. Maybe they'll throw in Philogene on loan!\n10 Posted 13/07/2024 at 11:32:17\nI wonder if the fee is depressed because they overpaid for Dobbin — an arrangement designed to create PSR headroom?\n11 Posted 13/07/2024 at 11:37:59\nHe hasn't improved that much since he's signed for Everton let's be honest.\nI've yet to see him ever truly dominate a midfield battle, I've not seen him use his stature or athletism anywhere near enough and he's not a goal threat enough.\nFor £50M I'd want more to be honest but he may well go to Villa, shine brilliant and then if Villa do fall away next season, they'll probably be forced to sell him to an Arsenal or a Bayern Munich won't they.\nThen again he may go to Villa and just remain the same decent but peripheral figure that I think he's been too often.\nHopefully that money from his sale means we can give Man Utd an even bigger fuck off now over Branthwaite.\n12 Posted 13/07/2024 at 11:45:45\nHe can be erratic but, if it is possible through PSR, I would keep him.\n13 Posted 13/07/2024 at 11:47:35\nI think Robert is right that the fee is part of the Ireagbewan - Dobbin - Onana arrangement. And it would be clever work as Sam suggests if we also got Philogene on loan.\n14 Posted 13/07/2024 at 11:53:50\n15 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:00:39\nGood luck, Amadau, go and prove the doubters wrong, now you are joining a better team.\n16 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:14:50\nDon't wrinkle your cardigan about it, grandad.\n17 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:29:43\nYou must have some sausage fingers to type £20 million instead of 20%.\n18 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:40:08\nI think he will go on and have a good high-level career but not the outstanding one I think he believes he will.\nHe seems like a decent lad though and brighter than the average footballer, mind you so is my cat. He has always at least seemed committed to our club and he was always going to be a player we moved on for profit, I echo Sam's sentiments though, we should have made more from him and failed.\nI can't imagine Dele is a the like-for-like replacement for Onana so maybe we will get a central midfielder in on loan. Arthur Melo is the one most mentioned but he looks a bit washed up these days.\nI suspect our remaining available money will be spent on a decent wide man, Gnonto please for me. I like the look of Asprilla and Lindstrom too though. Reports are that Newcastle are back in for Calvert-Lewin.\n19 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:42:12\nInteresting that Unai Emery rates him more than our own fans. What does he know, eh?\n20 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:45:49\nHe's not one of the players we really can't afford to lose, such as Pickford or Branthwaite, so he should be sold in my view.\nFees are lower now than in previous years so all the comparisons and doubts are unfounded as far as I see it. The club knows the value they put on a player, and not one of us is an expert despite feeling like one. Ours are mere opinions, not fact.\n21 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:47:58\n22 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:53:39\nHe's 2 years into 5-year deal, so his book value is £18M.\nSo from a PSR point of view, it's £50M less £18M less £4M = £28M or thereabout, I think.\n23 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:56:15\n24 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:57:37\nWe need to buy a defensive midfielder, as Gueye is past his best, attacking midfielder to replace Onana, a winger and fullback. We have to keep Branthwaite and Newcastle rumoured to be targeting Calvert-Lewin again, because Callum Wilson is too injury prone with his constant hamstring problem.\nWe should agree to Dom's contract demand, it will cost us more to try and replace him, he's only 27 and is now over his injury problems and a huge loss if we let him go. Is he not worth the same money we're paying Doucoure?\n25 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:58:30\nPersonally, I've not forgiven him for that dreadful penalty shootout miss.\n26 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:58:36\nHappy to see him go, if it means we keep Branthwaite.\n27 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:58:37\nI watched him for Belgium and he never did nothing wrong but he never really had much influence over the game either in the sense that he just ambled around and just kept the ball moving, with the lack of any real urgency being the most disappointing aspect of his game.\nGood luck to him because he's obviously got a great deal of potential, but, if he is to fulfill his talent, then he has definitely got to implement a lot more urgency into his game.\n28 Posted 13/07/2024 at 12:59:25\nIt will be interesting to see whether another central midfielder comes in or if Dyche thinks we have enough with Gueye, Garner, Doucoure and Iroegbunam. And possibly Dele:\nRight-wing and right-back remain the priorities for me. And possibly a centre-forward if Calvert-Lewin leaves — though I've got more faith in Beto and Chermiti than most.\n29 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:02:17\nI wish him all the best and I think he genuinely enjoyed playing for us. I just hope we use the money well, ie, a winger, right-back, and Phillips in on loan.\n30 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:04:21\nI don't hold a lot of faith that Dele can regain some kind of stable form but my word will I be getting behind him to do so, what a story that would be. The romantic in me would love to see it happen.\n31 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:07:34\nIt will be paid in instalments over the same payment terms Villa pay us — so, like all transfers, it will be spread over 3 or 4 years.\n32 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:09:17\nHe wasn't a bad player, but I never saw him fitting into the scheme of things, and I don't think he was ever comfortable either. So all in all, not a bad result.\nClearly a defensive (holding) midfielder, Dele I would not have thought of as a replacement (more creative, but god knows how that will work out, but I hope it does).\nWe have some serious deadwood that still needs moving on now, and three or more replacements if Calvert-Lewin follows him out the door.\n33 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:13:16\nWatched him during the Euros and thought he was average in most of the games.\nHe had some good moments in an Everton shirt but I think we can find some decent players from the £50M we get for him.\nKeeps some much-needed funds coming in, and hoping we can continue to do some tactical and savvy signings for the remainder of the window!\n34 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:14:57\nOnana made it clear in the Euros that he wanted to move on, no one else as yet has come in for Onana, that does not mean another club knowing the price will not jump in late on.\nFor me, unless Man Utd get close to the asking price, it just makes it that much more likely we will hold on to Branthwaite.\nNot too bothered about losing Onana; if he thinks he can\ndo better elsewhere, good luck to the player. I have every confidence we will find someone to slot in his place.\n36 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:17:32\nWe needed this deal done to finance other moves. What may have been gained for a few million more might well have been taken away in a late window scramble to pursue other targets.\nThelwell has damn near earned a nickname, a complimentary one by the way: Thelwell in Excelsius!\n37 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:18:54\nMaybe it is the system we play but similarly for Belgium, he also seemed to play an over-hyped role in the Euros and delivered nothing.\nHe was dropped by Dyche and was not even missed. I for one won't miss him.\n38 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:19:43\nYou are assuming that Man Utd and Arsenal were prepared to pay more than £50M for him and so desperate to have him.\nAnd can you see Onana being worth more than Branthwaite?\n39 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:21:44\nDale, did you catch yourself a buck or a doe?\n40 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:25:26\nI can't remember ever thinking this, but I'm open to offers.\n41 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:28:14\nI love a cult hero like all Blues do, but just thumping the badge and running around doesn't justify it! James Garner is literally 5 times the player Onana is…\nAlso, if it means we keep Branthwaite another year, then I'm over the moon. But hey, if we sell Jarrad for £60M as well, then who can complain? £110M in the account of my beloved EFC.\nBack in the late 1800s, who would have thought such a thing!! £100M is big money for any business in any industry. Nobody is bigger than the club. But can we please keep Jarrad another year!\nAlso, £20 million profit is nothing to sniff at, profit is never guaranteed! See Gylfi Sigurdsson…\n42 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:31:19\nWe moved the ball out of our half more effectively with Garner and Gana. There was too much station to station passing with Onana in the pivot and it limited our attacks by making defensive matchups easy to select.\nGarner and Gana created more runs and typically found more forward passes that unlocked defence assignments.\n43 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:31:32\nWe need the money. We won't miss him.\n44 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:33:43\nVilla bigger than us? Not so long ago, they were in the Championship.\nWish him well and it gives us funds for further additions.\n£50M in today's market represents a fair old profit on what we paid for him, especially as he always to me seemed on the outside looking in, with bursts of inclusion at certain times during games.\nVery rarely the inspiration we all thought he would be but who knows what role he will play at Villa?\nHas the ability to burst forward but seemingly always content to sit back as a defensive type of midfielder… but was that his role in the Dyche formation?\nOn we move in readiness for the new season, and good luck to him.\n45 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:35:08\n1. It's the way we should be doing business moving forward under new ownership. Buy young. Buy potential. Sell for profit.\n2. This is the first piece of business that must be executed in order to hold on to Jarrad Branthwaite. If we can sell Onana and one other (probably one other) to keep Branthwaite this window has been overseen by Kevin \"Walk on Water\" Thelwell.\n46 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:36:03\nWe need to bring in another midfielder; with Gueye 35, he's not capable of playing every game. We were supposed to be interested in Phillips, who was supposedly on his way back to Leeds, but not getting promoted changed that.\nIn my opinion, a new start under Dyche could resurrrect his career and show why Man City bought him. I also think we should offer Calvert-Lewin a better contract to get him to stay; Newcastle rumoured to be sniffing around again because Callum Wilson is too injury-prone, with his constant hamstring problem, to be back up to Isak.\nBeto and Chermiti are not good enough, and when you see Ipswich paying Man City £20M for Liam Delap, who was very average on loan in the Championship last season, it would cost a lot more to replace the quality of Dom.\n47 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:42:29\nI just wanted to remind him that, if he intends driving Amadou down to Birmingham himself, the national speed limit is 70 mph.\n48 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:47:23\nAnyone wants to chip in with the GoFundMe, feel free to chip in.\n49 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:53:10\nI reckon it would show Sean Dyche has saved the club literally hundreds of millions. Getting £50M for this lad, probably £30M for Calvert-Lewin, still being in the top league for two campaigns, potentially £80M for Jarrad…\nLampard would have crashed the club, and all the players would have been picked up for buttons, and the new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock would be the biggest white elephant ever.\n50 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:53:59\nEven in the Euros, I didn't see him make a forward pass of any note.\nBank the money, move on.\n51 Posted 13/07/2024 at 13:55:29\nChristy @43 is whats wrong with our fanbase. Beto has looked great and Chermiti did well when he played inthe derby, he's a young lad…\nI would happily just play Beto up top if Dom goes. He's a unit and is boss in the air and he played the way us Blues want to see the team play, giving 100%, always on the edge.\nThe Premier League is different from Italy and he'll improve. You were probably saying that Ellis Simms wasn't good enough either before he left.\n52 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:02:07\nAll this sounds harsh as I do think he can \"do a job\" up top and I don't dislike the man, he's easy to get behind as his effort is always good.\nChermiti I think has tons of potential and I don't see what the haters do. I think the kid could develop into a damn good striker. He's very good on a ball, he's quick, and he just needs more experience in my opinion to really up his game. I'm a \"buy\" not a \"sell\" guy with Chermiti and hope he gets a lot more minutes this season. He's only what? 20 years old?\nBefore Chermiti is deemed unfit for purpose, let's let him actually get meaningful minutes on the pitch and develop?\n53 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:03:09\nThat tells me we've done alright on this one. And VillaTalk ain't exactly doing the can-can over an Onana - Barkley midfield axis.\n54 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:04:05\nThe Philogene lad may now come our way. Loan to buy maybe.\nLindstrÃ¸m a smokescreen to fool the Premier League … Not!\n55 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:07:38\nI certainly think there is something there in Beto. If Calvert-Lewin moves on, we certainly need to keep hold of Beto and give him a run in the friendlies.\nLet's see how he does in his second season in the Premier League. There is definitely a footballer in the guy, it's just a case of the coaching staff working on it, getting him to lift his head up when running with the ball.\n56 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:11:41\nI bet Dyche would whip him into shape. On his day, he's one of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League. He just needs an arm around the shoulder and for someone to tell him he's a skinny little fuck.\n57 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:11:48\nYour post, on the other hand, I entirely disagree with.\nAnd that is the beauty of a fanbase; we are a broad church with different opinions. Which is why I don't consider you to be “what is wrong with our fanbase.”\nAnd for what it's worth, I believe Simms was sold out of necessity. Same with Tom Cannon. They were saleable assets that we could afford to sell without materially weakening the first team in the short term.\nI doubt either will become Premier League regulars in the future, but you never know, especially since Cannon is likely to be part of Leicester City's squad for the coming season.\nAs for Onana, I expected more from him in an Everton shirt. I think he will go on and become a big player for Villa (if the deal goes through) and then maybe we'll all understand how his particular mix of size, strength and deep-lying passing range could mark him out as a very unique footballer.\n58 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:13:08\nI'm very happy with this bit of good business.\n59 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:21:58\n60 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:22:17\nAnd according to Belgians media it is even lower than that and is believed to be worth £40million plus £5million in add-ons\nTypical Everton!\n61 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:28:36\n'I'm what's wrong with our fan base'? — Up yours!\nYou seem to think you're a mind reader, re Simms? Do you think your Mr ToffeeWeb?\nChermiti is young and probably needs to go out on loan, and can you the expert, tell me when 'Beto looked great, boss in the air, and played the way us Blues want the team to play'???]\nI'll be in Sligo next Friday, watching our Blues in action… will you?\n62 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:36:04\nI have seen his potential in very fleeting moments, maybe he is keeping it for the top club he thinks will come in for him, although Villa, like him, have that possible potential. Onana has kept his well hidden in the 2 years he has been here.\nI'm not counting my chickens until he and his sister get that deal done.\nDave (44), I couldn't drive him down to Birmingham — I never got past my provisional licence, cars came too late for me and too technical!\n63 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:40:45\nHe never went about the club sulking and although there is disagreement among supporters of his actual talent, I believed he done his best.\nHolding out for more money stopped the club from having extra financial backing in transfers they were following,\nYou cant keep a player that does not want to stay, and i am aware that he seems slow and lazy at times but always seems to be in the rite place to receive and pass a ball knowing were his fellow teammates are.\n64 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:44:18\n65 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:49:03\nOnana registered the highest aerial duel success rate (74.3%) of any midfielder in Europe's top five leagues last term.\n66 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:49:28\nHappy to give him a second season to see if he just needs to adjust to a new league. But my instinct tells me the lack of the basics would be the same in any league and there's a reason Udinese let him go with zero pounds up front.\nThink about that. No fee paid for a player. They can't have rated him. I truly want it to work for Beto and hope it does. But every time I watch him, I see errors made that shouldn't happen at this level.\n67 Posted 13/07/2024 at 14:55:56\n£50M? — snap their bloody hand off and run to the hills.\nIneffectual, lazy and doesn't impose himself on games like he should. When there is a midfield war to be won, Onana is the first player that goes missing.\n68 Posted 13/07/2024 at 15:02:26\nWe move on… just keep Branthwaite.\n69 Posted 13/07/2024 at 15:09:51\n70 Posted 13/07/2024 at 15:22:19\nI think it's fairly possible he might be one of the best central midfield players in the world in 5 or 6 years time and we will wish that we got more than £50M for him, but right now that's a decent profit and much-needed cash.\nUgochukwu on loan would be interesting but really it's the quality of winger(s?) we bring in that might decide whether we have a shot at the Top 10 this season.\n71 Posted 13/07/2024 at 15:29:37\n£17M profit, about £13.5M left after paying 20% to his previous club and a decent salary off the wages.\nNow for a couple more incoming!\n72 Posted 13/07/2024 at 15:38:56\nInteresting to see him at Villa as he didn't look like a £50M player at Goodison to me. Massive upside is we can tell Man Utd to get lost re Branthwaite — unless they offer £80M+. PSR also hopefully now not an issue for 2023-24 or 2024-25 seasons.\nOnly thing left is to sell Calvert-Lewin to the Barcodes and get a some new players in.\nI'm happy with the transfer business so far. I'm sure deals are in negotiation in the background and Dyche and Thelwell have some cash to spend.\n73 Posted 13/07/2024 at 15:41:31\nYou are not alone, Dave Abrahams, I think it is smart busIness and, for me, £50M is a good price. I'm pretty sure we will have someone on the radar to bring in.\nIf this kills off the Branthwaite sale, that will do for me.\nBest of luck to him in the future, if he gets his move.\n74 Posted 13/07/2024 at 15:43:51\nHe never really got the chance to play there for us, because of Gueye, so we never really saw how good or effective he is in his proper position.\n75 Posted 13/07/2024 at 15:44:45\nAnother example of how purchasing young talent pays off.\nGood luck to the boy!\n76 Posted 13/07/2024 at 15:47:31\nThe same ones said Gordon is no good, as did Ped on Toffee TV; he now is worth £80-100M.\nDyche's one-dimensional system doesn't suit Onana. All this protection of Branthwaite, but to whose detriment?\n77 Posted 13/07/2024 at 16:00:47\nI think most Everton fans like their players to run around like headless chickens than watch cultured footballers.\n78 Posted 13/07/2024 at 16:04:23\nVilla have seen us coming to get rid of their crap to make money for PSR and now they pull our pants down. Onana will be one of the best midfielders in the Premier League whilst we have Thelwell and Dyche with their one-dimensional thinking.\nWhat the fuck???\n79 Posted 13/07/2024 at 16:13:29\nThe other positive is it shows up and coming players that EFC is a good staging place, chances in the team and Premier League shop window. Recruit correctly, sell on and keep the very best!\n80 Posted 13/07/2024 at 16:17:47\n81 Posted 13/07/2024 at 16:24:44\nPoor Thelwell and Dyche have been given the biggest clean-up job in the history of Everton Football Club without a pot to piss in… and still you get people moaning that it's all their fault!\nI grew up thinking that Everton had a very knowledgeable fanbase; when I finally did grow up, I realised that this isn't entirely true.\n82 Posted 13/07/2024 at 16:25:44\nKeeping Branthwaite is key since he's a generational talent.\n83 Posted 13/07/2024 at 16:31:59\nRyan # 63 astute comment about Onana's aerial ability.\nThose using this as an opportunity to have a go at Dyche and Thelwell might also note that our net spend since Moshiri pulled the plug (summer window 2021-22) is £80M behind Norwich, £90M behind Luton, £140M behind Ipswich, £210M behind Brentford, £220M behind Palace and £300M behind Bournemouth and Forest over the same period.\nIf you want better football, you need to invest in better players.\n84 Posted 13/07/2024 at 16:35:08\nYou'd be better just posting on your own thoughts rather than speaking for \"most\" of us, mate.\n85 Posted 13/07/2024 at 16:36:13\nHow can anyone blame or criticise the tremendous job they've done???\n86 Posted 13/07/2024 at 16:48:40\nWhen you consider he's 6ft-4in? And he spends most of his time on the floor.\nBackwards and sideways passer, he will not be missed. Compare to Mainoo for example and there is no contest.\nDelighted to get rid of the robot.\n87 Posted 13/07/2024 at 16:51:02\nLike many central defensive midfielders in modern football, Onana is essentially a centre-back playing in front of the defence. That is his role.\nLike other centre-backs, he is generally supposed to stay put — not drive forward.\n88 Posted 13/07/2024 at 16:57:29\nI'd fancy us to concede more set-piece goals if they leave us…\n89 Posted 13/07/2024 at 17:07:04\nAs for Onana, I watched him in all of Belgium's games and lost count of the pointless passes he returned to teammates after asking for the ball.\nOver-rated and expensive — mainly because he is big and young.\nAston Villa have gone backwards considering they did have Luiz.\n90 Posted 13/07/2024 at 17:08:56\nHe will need to pull his socks up and take games by the scruff of the neck if he wants to fulfil his ambitions — and not just 5 mins here and there.\n91 Posted 13/07/2024 at 17:11:46\n92 Posted 13/07/2024 at 17:12:57\nAt times he looked the part using his physique to make important tackles and showing guile with some shrewd passing. Too often though he disappeared from view when we might have expected him to grab hold of the midfield.\nThe unholy mess he made of what would have been the winning penalty against Fulham suggested a lack of focus at what was a key moment in our season. I imagine that went a long way to undermining Dyche's trust in him.\nThe weaknesses in his game, especially the lack of a consistent goal threat, would suggest £50m is a decent fee for a player who offers the potential to be a competent holding midfielder but no more than that.\n93 Posted 13/07/2024 at 17:14:50\nLook at his stats. He is very tall and with long legs; watch him soar under Villa. West Ham wanted him but we got in there only because we were willing to pay his high wages.\nDyche will never get the best out of talent like Onana. Onana likes feeding the wingers and tackles and playing forward. We play him as a defensive midfielder but he's in his element going forward.\nIf Dyche played him in his preferred position, that would be natural and I think he'd be even better for Belgium. For him now, it's like an anxious relationship of defensive midfielder and striking midfielder.\n94 Posted 13/07/2024 at 17:19:50\nAt £50M, this could be Count Unai's first big error.\n95 Posted 13/07/2024 at 17:19:53\nPersonally, I never forgave him for the lazy penalty miss\nwhich probably contributed greatly to the terrible run of results which followed.\n96 Posted 13/07/2024 at 17:29:26\nCalvert-Lewin next perhaps.\n97 Posted 13/07/2024 at 17:29:28\nMay do well at Villa who have lost Douglas Luiz but Onana needs to step up his work rate and passing.\n98 Posted 13/07/2024 at 17:36:05\nI was convinced we had a world beater on our hands, in the month after we signed him, strong, aggressive, could tackle, and run with the ball, but sadly all of them traits eventually disappeared, and he was more comfortable playing a safe, sidewards 10-yard pass, and he became anonymous for long periods in games.\nPeople may laugh at this but I wonder whether he couldn't handle the constant pressure of fighting relegation battles at the wrong end of the table? Not all young players can.\nOn a much more positive note, since we lost 'the greatest Evertonian', the shackles seemed to have come off in the transfer market. Hopefully no more 'chewed fingernails' at 10:55 pm on the last day of the transfer window, hoping for that 31-year-old free transfer we'd all hoped for, to add experience and guile to our squad?\nJust how much of an influence and overall control the man had on transfers is becoming increasingly obvious.\nI think we'll see a much changed Everton squad by the time the season starts, and hopefully a much better goal return from the newbies that we sign, without relying on the much-maligned Calvert-Lewin, who will eventually exit I'm sure.\nTin hat on, but I'm cautiously optimistic.\n99 Posted 13/07/2024 at 17:53:47\nLuiz is very good on the ball but he is not much of a ball winner. Onana is a mirror image of him.\nThe Count may believe that sacrificing some creativity for better defensive capability will improve his team.\n100 Posted 13/07/2024 at 17:58:08\nSorry to disagree, Sam, but Beto is not a good match for what Dominic brings the team. He might not even be here by the start of the season. Onana is the established defensive midfielder for Belgium; while Tim Iroegbunam may develop into a good player but he will on the bench.\nI don't blame Thelwell for this, or Dyche. They have been given a hospital pass with the challenge of operating with the club's financial constraints.\nOver to Sean to perform more miracles.\n101 Posted 13/07/2024 at 18:01:53\nOur former “watch this space” chairman loved being the centre of attention and, if that meant a bit of fibbing, then the old drama queen was in his element.\nHe spread the myth that he was a tough negotiator, doing his best in the transfer market but, apart from a few crackers, eg Cahill, Coleman, Baines etc… he was more miss than hit.\nAnd that bullshit about other owners asking him, \"What would Everton do?\"\n102 Posted 13/07/2024 at 18:02:48\nAs others have said, this Onana sale is an excellent piece of business. Perhaps about £10 million light on what I would have liked to see, but we'll make that up with the sell-on fee in 2026. He's a terrific young man and I wish him nothing but the best.\nEd #100, I suspect it's what Ryan said earlier about Villa losing every aerial battle in midfield last season with their Munchkin brigade. Onana is the precise answer to that need.\n103 Posted 13/07/2024 at 18:03:07\nWe have stopped paying huge sums for players at their peak with no resale value. Recruiting young players with the potential to improve and deliver a decent return is the only way a club in our position should operate. The great pity is that we blew such a huge chunk of money learning that lesson.\n104 Posted 13/07/2024 at 18:16:05\n105 Posted 13/07/2024 at 18:17:00\nThe problem is he doesn't impose himself on games — even playing for Belgium.\nA player with his class and ability ought to be driving his team on and demanding the ball the way De Bruyne is.\nI don't doubt his ability and I believe with a bit more maturity and confidence he will be a truly great player.\nRight now, he is a £50M player so the fee from Villa is a fair one that also helps us rebuild and keep Branthwaite.\n106 Posted 13/07/2024 at 18:28:09\nI wouldn't be surprised if we required Villa to overpay for Dobbin and underpay for Onana in order to generate a PSR win — and lessen the amount payable to Lille as a % of the sale proceeds.\nOn that basis, £60M or so for the pair is probably about right.\n107 Posted 13/07/2024 at 18:36:11\nI got so fecking sick of that argument depending, as it did, on nothing solid but speculation and the daunting resilience of some on here who I will not name.\nOnana is great at clapping, pointing, and running to fans after the final whistle (usually doing some sort of dumb dance), but he did not have the guts to do so after that pathetic me me me me penalty.\nOnana is as far from being a top player as I am of being a key player in the USA ladies Olympics beach volleyball team. I cannot think of a single match where he was dominant; goals I can count on the fingers of two hands; killer exquisite passes on the fingers of two hands; goal-saving or chance-preventing killer tackles or blocks ........\nI'm sure that the Onana onanists will correct me on some of these things but £50 million is well south of some of their optimistic valuations. In fact, after Lille get their 20% the fee suddenly shrinks to not a whole lot more than we paid for him. Glad that we got the sell on clause just in case, you never know .......\nNow we can sit and wait for the plastic nothingness and crocodile tears of \"I love this club and its fans, I will always have a place in my heart for you, but Villa were too big an opportunity to turn down, I want to win trophies, and the Villa [note \"the Villa\", he's one of them now] are a massive club. Anyway, how could I turn down a team supported by the next King. of England [pause for laughs]. God bless The Villa and God bless my future mate Prince William\".\n108 Posted 13/07/2024 at 18:43:15\nHopefully we've included our own sell on clause.\nNow, let's spend the money wisely.\n109 Posted 13/07/2024 at 18:44:34\n110 Posted 13/07/2024 at 18:50:54\n111 Posted 13/07/2024 at 18:54:53\nThe upside of this, fingers crossed, is that a proper young star now stays with us, but Thelwell and Co do need to get busy in the middle, right-back, wings, in particular.\nI hope that they have every Euro match on their iPads and have them trained on the likes of Slovakia, Slovenia, Georgia, Turkey, and Albania.\n112 Posted 13/07/2024 at 18:57:21\nThat sounds a bit better.\n113 Posted 13/07/2024 at 18:58:03\nErm… they stat anything these days!\n“I imagine he wanted to go and raise his profile in the Champions League.” Has he only signed for a year with Villa then? Cos we've as much chance of Champions League in 2025 as they have!\nMeh — if he was as good as some people seem insistent that we should all believe, he'd have held out for a bigger team than Villa!\n114 Posted 13/07/2024 at 19:00:54\nBelgium also play him as a defensive midfielder so I think his coaches consider that to be his best role.\n115 Posted 13/07/2024 at 19:07:23\nWe've no idea who was really in for Onana but some pretty reliable journalists claimed he was high on the list for most of those clubs and may well end up there. The lads only 22 after all!\nA sensible move for him as he will be first choice at Villa and will grow under a talented manager there. I was probably one of the most optimistic of his valuers and thought we could maybe get around £60-70m for him. If he does well at Villa and they sell him for a mint in 4 years time then that could still be the case.\nAt the very minimum we will be making a £16m profit on him which is better than we've done on most players recently.\nGood luck on your trials for the USA ladies olympic beach volleyball team!\n116 Posted 13/07/2024 at 19:09:24\nTargets should have been identified weeks ago and hopefully obtained in the coming weeks!\n117 Posted 13/07/2024 at 19:17:12\nAh, my intention was not to continue the fee war so if I did that was an own goal. £60-70m was not, if the indices were correct, beyond the realms of possibility at all. In fact, with add ons and sell ons (if all goes well, a hefty \"if\" for me) we will end up with over £60 million in all likelihood.\nI was being a tad tongue-in-cheek (107) and hope that you and yours are all thriving.\nI do hope, though, that we are having long and hard looks at the likes of Slovakia, Slovenia, Georgia, Turkey, and Albania for new signings.\nThe Chelsea lad on loan, if there is any substance, is also the sort of thing I have in mind (even better with a to buy clause).\nChristopher (116), tournaments have always been hunting grounds for talent. How could they not be?\nIf you can give me a list of post-tournament transfer duds, I bet my list of successes is longer (with Sam's help!).\nAll transfer business these days is risky.\n118 Posted 13/07/2024 at 19:19:20\nHe looks good with 5- to 10-yard passes backwards and sideways but what else?\nKeeping hold of Branthwaite has now just improved too. Time to tell Man Utd to fuck off with the daft bids as well!\n119 Posted 13/07/2024 at 19:20:35\nI struggle to see how people don't rate him but that's the beauty of opinions I guess. A shame to see him leave but a totally understandable sale given the financial circumstances of the club.\nI would absolutely take Phillips on loan to plug the gap and concentrate the permanent purchases on a winger and a right-back, both with pace please, Mr Thelwell.\nNow please try and shift Holgate, Patterson and Maupay. That will do in terms of outgoings as the squad is pretty threadbare now — although I'm pretty sure Calvert-Lewin will also leave unfortunately.\n120 Posted 13/07/2024 at 19:21:53\nYes, lots of good affordable talent out there such as in the places you mention. I think our scouting has been better recently so have more faith than I did a few years back.\n121 Posted 13/07/2024 at 19:24:47\n122 Posted 13/07/2024 at 19:32:07\nEverton selling one of our best players to Aston Villa. Lose a target to Ipswich. Looking for loan deals.\n123 Posted 13/07/2024 at 19:37:22\nSam & Paul F,\nThe question I find myself asking is, if you had £50M-£55M to spend, would you be happy if we bought him? I think at that price we've done a decent deal.\nShows that Man Utd need to double their Branthwaite valuation too!\n124 Posted 13/07/2024 at 19:38:33\nThat's fair enough but my own opinion is that all good midfield players either take the ball forward or try and drive their team forward.\nUntil Onana learns to do either, then he will continue to be a player who has potential but mostly flattens to deceive.\n125 Posted 13/07/2024 at 19:44:31\nWhen you're in the Champions League you will naturally draw in a different pool of talent.\nLet's not forget Villa were relegated and came back up a better team five seasons ago under better ownership.\nHopefully we will be on that upward trajectory over the next few seasons under Dan Friedkin as well as the new stadium. No reason to suggest otherwise why we cannot be the next Aston Villa in 4/5 seasons time.\n126 Posted 13/07/2024 at 19:53:38\nI'm of the camp that he never wowed us in any significant way, that his theatrics (both positive and negative) were a tad grating, that the touting of his potential has always been a bit overblown — but generally I also just really like him as a person. (Maybe I'm just a sucker for foreigners who can speak several languages so fluently, especially Belgians.) He seemed to genuinely enjoy being a part of the club.\nAnd so I wish him well, but not so well that Villa remind us in the coming years just how far we've fallen in comparison to their rise.\n127 Posted 13/07/2024 at 20:21:06\nGood business for a player who constantly flatters to deceive. I'm sure he'll look better in a better team and we are better off having £50M to spend on what we need.\n128 Posted 13/07/2024 at 20:32:40\n129 Posted 13/07/2024 at 20:43:32\nWe're selling a guy to a Champions League team, making a £17M profit on him (~£13M after Lille get their cut), with add-ons and a sell-on fee to come, and we're still shitting on him as a fanbase.\nHe missed a fucking penalty. Move on. It's so unbelievably petty.\nHe's not been terrible, he's not been great. He's mostly been misused, and has been playing in a team which has been terrible for years.\nIf all our transfer dealings had gone this way, we wouldn't be hip-deep in Shit Creek right now. That some are treating the fact he's being sold to Aston Villa as a gotcha is a joke, given that they're well-run and about to play Champions League football.\n130 Posted 13/07/2024 at 21:32:02\nI do not see the point in selling Onana. Who is going to replace him? We're not going to make much on selling him now. Never heard of balance, Everton?\nBranthwaite is treated like the Holy Grail. Er, scoring wins games, not defence. We had the 4th best defence because we're firing blanks up top and the teams that meet us know that too and that's why we're always on the defence.\nAt least Onana helps stop that in midfield.\n131 Posted 13/07/2024 at 21:35:01\nWe don't have £50M to spend mate — 20% to Lille on profit — and in the bigger picture, ie, initial fee, we might emerge with somewhere in the region of £12-14m. It's also something of an assumption these days to think that money gained will go straight into the transfer kitty.\nThere might have been reports about Bayern etc links, Paul, but dear Lord they were recycled over and over again to try to convince us that Onana was star potential because Bayern etc clearly thought so as they prepared their bids.\n132 Posted 13/07/2024 at 21:39:36\n133 Posted 13/07/2024 at 21:39:51\n£50M for a good player. It's Aston villa's star signing. They are buying potential, may be? Who knows?\nWe move on! The club did warn us players would be sold. Another hard season ahead. Keep the faith.\n134 Posted 13/07/2024 at 21:46:59\n135 Posted 13/07/2024 at 22:02:21\nThere are lots of intricacies to these multi-million-pound deals that a lot of people just don't take into account.\nI'm not reporting to know them all, but as I've said, would we be happy if Thelwell and Dyche were unveiling Onana as our new £50M signing?? If you think not, then we have the better side of this deal, in my opinion.\n136 Posted 13/07/2024 at 22:12:08\nVilla are in the privileged position that they need a CDM and someone who wins a lot of aerial duels — and have £50M to spend on someone who fits the bill and should settle in easily for their Champions League campaign.\n137 Posted 13/07/2024 at 22:24:28\nWhen the fuck has Beto ever looked great?\nHe makes Rondon look like Ian Wright.\n138 Posted 13/07/2024 at 22:49:44\nIt is the ability to appear keyed in, to demonstrate to the stands that you, and you alone, can see what is happening. It makes you look like being involved while actually not being involved.\nIt makes you look like your team mates don't quite get you and makes the more discernible supporter appear more discerning because they do, in fact \"get you\".\nIt, when the pointing is properly finessed, may get you a move to a Champions League club.\nHowever, pointing always ends in tears, not financially, but when you end up, aged 34, at a relegation-threatened club with an octogenarian Sam Allardyce telling you that you are an overpaid lazy cunt.\n139 Posted 13/07/2024 at 22:52:01\n140 Posted 13/07/2024 at 23:42:24\nSo for me this is a good bit of business.\n141 Posted 13/07/2024 at 23:47:27\nI remember an interview with Tarkowski in which he listed all of Onana's incredible physical attributes, we all know he has these. But the most important one he neglected to discuss was his footballing ability. Which is the most important.\nGive me a Leon Osman with very limited physical attributes ahead of this guy any day of the week.\n142 Posted 14/07/2024 at 00:31:38\nRob #129, top corner shot. Can't believe all the negative comments. But wait, yes I can, after all this is ToffeeWeb.\nTony #124, \"good midfield players either take the ball forward or try and drive their team forward.\"\nI think that's exactly what you're going to see out of Onana after a few months at Unai University. I consider Emery one of the finest managers on the planet. Look at how he developed Watkins and resurrected Bailey, and the dramatic improvement in Buendia before his injury. He'll work magic on Onana.\nJohn #130, \"scoring wins games, not defence\"... thanks for the Luton-esque laugh.\nAndy #138, I've seen you point at a beer glass and thought it was one of the most brilliant performances I've ever seen.\n143 Posted 14/07/2024 at 01:25:00\nProbably true but don't post stuff like that on here as Masters will cite you as a reliable source of PSR violations evidence, lol.\n144 Posted 14/07/2024 at 03:15:37\n145 Posted 14/07/2024 at 05:17:28\nRobert makes some very valid points above. We are being outspent by everyone, not just the big 6… everyone.\nHeading towards another season where we are selling an established international player and replacing him with a PSR makeweight.\nCalvert-Lewin wants out, how long before Branthwaite wants out? We couldn't even tempt the lad from Hull as Ipswich offered more.\nI am very concerned about next season.\n146 Posted 14/07/2024 at 05:41:13\nHe definitely has talent and physical attributes, and is still only 22 years old.\nHe was only ever going to stay here 2-3 seasons. We will make a profit on him — although I'd like it to be bigger — so a good move for him and for us.\n147 Posted 14/07/2024 at 05:53:59\nMostly it has been long ball football but towards the end of last season we occasionally looked to play the ball through midfield but Onana always looked to me to be the player who most often made himself available to take a pass. Later even Gana started looking to get forward but even then the only outlets seemed to be Harrison or McNeil.\nI've never understood why Onana got as much criticism as he did while Garner, who to me was not any better, and to a lesser extent Doucoure, gets away almost blame free as, to me, the midfield must play as a unit.\nPresently, I'm wondering where the players we've bought — Iroegbunam, Ndiaye or if they arrive LindstrÃ¸m, Philogene (unlikely) or Ugochukwu — are going to fit in? Don't tell me, it's a squad thing.\n148 Posted 14/07/2024 at 06:09:51\n149 Posted 14/07/2024 at 06:51:36\nStands around pointing. Passes sideways and backwards a lot. Achieves very little.\n£50M! Villa will wonder what possessed them.\n150 Posted 14/07/2024 at 08:04:47\nOr maybe Villa are just signing squad/bench players.\nWell, all those who profess to know say 'he just needs to be in a good or better team'... like Belgium play in the Zingari Alliance... I suppose it's wait and see.\n151 Posted 14/07/2024 at 08:24:32\nFrom a club point of view, they've made a profit on him, and I believe he will show his worth in time.\nAt the top end, you need pace and power, and he's got that. His dominance will grow through experience. We just can't showcase it with a net spend behind Luton, Sheffield United, Ipswich and other such heavyweights.\nYes, he didn't score and create assists. But not many defensive midfielders do. Perhaps the issue was spending that level of money on a player who doesn't contribute goals in a team that's short of goals, and playing a low block/long ball that negated his strengths.\nFrankly, the marginal gains of a £10M vs a £30M defensive midfielder never added up to me. This highlighted another odd/poor transfer from Thelwell.\nOthers wax lyrical over the job he's done; I am not so sure: Maupay, Beto… sold our better players, and brought in some reserves. Jury still out; he's going to need to bring in some success stories as we continually lose players.\n152 Posted 14/07/2024 at 08:29:54\n\"Amadou Onana has immense potential,\" he said. \"Already a fixture in the Belgium starting line-up, he was named in L'Equipe's ‘team of the group stages' even with his side struggling before being knocked out of the Euros by France. He is a player of clear talent and that is not lost on anyone at Everton, who had previously valued him far in excess of the £50m they set as the starting point for any negotiations this summer. He's an £80m player. \"But we are in unique times and this is a deal that shows a degree of pragmatism from the club. There is an acknowledgement Onana is an ambitious player and the 22-year-old has made no secret of his desire to test himself at the highest levels. Set against that is the style of play Everton have adopted under Sean Dyche. \"Onana was brought in under Frank Lampard — making his debut at Villa Park — and the regime change that followed saw Everton go more direct, compete for less possession, and often bypass the midfield for fear of getting caught in transition and being punished, as was so often the case under Lampard. It is a style that has been hugely effective but it is not one that suits Onana, who likes to be at the heart of his team's efforts to progress up the pitch. \"The biggest symbol of that disconnect has been Dyche's willingness to leave him out of the starting XI, particularly in key games such as the three in a week that Everton won in April. Those victories, including the Merseyside derby win, took Everton to safety with weeks to spare. Onana did not start one of them. \"He is also a player, partly because of the reasons already mentioned, who has had too few big performances in Royal Blue. His best performance saw him dominate Arsenal in a home win in February 2023 — a display that had the away dressing room in raptures about him. There is a degree of frustration that he did not produce more performances like that. \"So while Villa have got a bargain who many Everton supporters accept may flourish elsewhere, this is a move that brings in a decent fee for a player who is not integral to Dyche's plans and who is open to a move. It enables Everton to strengthen the club's PSR position and potentially fund improvements in key areas while also being able to put up a stronger fight should someone launch a genuine push to sign Jarrad Branthwaite. \"He is a confident player who is eager to have the ball at his feet and unafraid of taking it in tight spaces. Going forward, he can eat up the ground when running with the ball and is capable of picking out a clever forward pass. Defensively, his physicality helps and his long legs help him to make recovery tackles and interceptions to help break up opposition attacks. \"Onana does not quite have the defensive discipline to play a straight six and benefits by having someone alongside him. His height means he is useful in both boxes, but he could do better in the air when attacking set pieces. He is a player who most expect to stand out in a team that is more suited to his attributes. This feels like a good deal for all parties.\"\n153 Posted 14/07/2024 at 08:31:47\nWhen Andy pointed in the pub, he got a lovely pint of bitter .\nWhat did Everton get for all the pointing Onana did? — Absolutely fuck-all.\n154 Posted 14/07/2024 at 09:03:10\nVilla are buying potential but most people know that potential is not enough.\nI still remember Onana having one of his best games for Everton the day Dyche managed Everton for the first time, and then smiling when I read that the new manager told Onana after the game that he might get one of his old Belgian players, Stefan Defur, to have a word with him about how he had to learn the dirty side of the game to succeed in England.\nOnana hasn't pushed on with regards trying to do the dirty bits, which most players who sit in front of the back four do quite naturally. (Robert T!). He has moved to a better team, so it will be interesting to see if he improves now he is surrounded with better players.\n155 Posted 14/07/2024 at 09:18:16\nOnana has simply got to go and do a lot more because, if he doesn't, I don't think he will get many games for Villa.\nHe comes across to me that he thinks he his better than he actually is. But, once you get with better players, you will only be accepted if you prove you are good enough.\nI wish him well, and believe that, if he adds more drive into his performances, he can become a very good midfielder. But my concern is Everton and I just hope that we use whatever money becomes available to create a more competitive squad.\n156 Posted 14/07/2024 at 09:29:03\nNo, he doesn't run around like a headless chicken because he's usually in the right positional sense.\nI think in general football fans don't know what they are watching and Everton fans in particular prefer the up-and-at-them style of football.\nEmery will get the best from him and Everton fans will watch puddings like James Garner…\n157 Posted 14/07/2024 at 10:38:53\nI'm more concerned on who we bring in.\n158 Posted 14/07/2024 at 10:57:29\nI, like many, like players in an Everton shirt to show passion and commitment, eg, Mick Lyons, Graveson, Carsley, Cahill, Coleman etc… but I also love the artistes, eg, McKenzie, Sheedy, Dobson, Rodriguez, etc….\nPlayers like Onana fall in between those two categories. He's like Lukaku, you know there's a player in there but is he determined to reach his maximum potential?\n159 Posted 14/07/2024 at 11:30:33\n160 Posted 14/07/2024 at 11:30:33\nOn the pitch Tony, on the pitch. What benefit was he on the pitch for £3M a year?\n161 Posted 14/07/2024 at 11:46:45\nBad news, what if a five-year-old trips Onana up on the beach? It'll take a week for him to get up.\nHow about his poor wrist with him wearing a fashionable wrist strapping? ðŸ™ˆ\nI really really hope nothing jeopardises the move. I'll be glad to see the back of him.\n162 Posted 14/07/2024 at 11:47:17\nThe point I keep coming back to is that he's never going to be a player who drives a team forward — the thing most often called out as his big failing.\nAlthough his position is midfield, his role in the team is more like that of a centre-back. According to the CIES observatory (which Arsenal have used to rebuild their squad so successfully), Onana plays the same role in the side (aerial duels and recovery tackles) as Virgil van Dijk and Marquinhos at PSG.\nIn terms of midfielders, he is comparable to Danilo of PSG (who also often plays centre-back in a back 3). None of these players drive the team forward because that is the role of other players in the team (in particular the full-backs).\nNot addressing this bit to you, Tony, but I think part of the problem is that because £30M was a big signing for us, the fans expect a player who really stands out and delivers. Unfortunately, £30M is peanuts these days — not even enough to buy a very average centre-back such as Max Kilman.\n163 Posted 14/07/2024 at 12:12:54\nI can't remember coming out of Goodison too often thinking \"Onana was brilliant today\". He may have had some impressive 15-minute spells in games, but I can't think of many midfield players who went missing for large sections of the game, as much as Onana did.\nI watched all his games for Belgium believing that some ToffeeWebbers might be right that in a good team he would impress, and he didnt impress and much like at Everton went missing for large parts of the Belgium matches.\n164 Posted 14/07/2024 at 12:14:08\nTypical of Everton to have to offload to realise value. He has gone to a side who will play in the Champions League and no doubt his value will increase.\n165 Posted 14/07/2024 at 12:37:25\nWishing him all the best but not at our expense.\nBye Bye.\n166 Posted 14/07/2024 at 13:37:44\nAs for Onana himself, I have no doubt he will thrive under an elite manager. Dyche does not appreciate him because he can't spell 'creativity' — let alone understand it.\n167 Posted 14/07/2024 at 13:48:56\nI think he knows a bit more about the player's ability than the lad's knockers on here.\n168 Posted 14/07/2024 at 13:51:28\nA young, first-team-ready player who we've developed and sold at a tidy profit.\n169 Posted 14/07/2024 at 13:52:04\nI always liken it to a car or a motorcycle: If you bought it with the possible chance of it becoming a collector's item, or to double its value, how long would you have to wait?\nIn the meantime, it gets involved in an accident that was down to a third party (uninsured) and was almost written off for buttons.\n170 Posted 14/07/2024 at 14:20:13\n171 Posted 14/07/2024 at 14:49:05\nBut if that doesn't take your fancy, we have some soggy porridge or burnt toast. Unfortunately, we've sold out of most of our continental breakfasts.\n172 Posted 14/07/2024 at 14:56:51\nWill we look to recruit to directly replace those attributes or recruit to change style which may weaken the defence over the long term ?\nI think it could be a season defining decision to make and its hard to see how we can replace those attributes that Onana possesses within the financial constraints the club have.\nWho is going to win those aerial duels now? Who will make those recovery tackles now?\n173 Posted 14/07/2024 at 15:11:52\n174 Posted 14/07/2024 at 15:16:25\nIt will be interesting though to see if Emery gets a different tune out of him\n175 Posted 14/07/2024 at 15:46:49\nIf he's supposedly going to be a better player in a different team and/or position, does it not still make sense to sell him? Our team is unlikely to change massively in the near term.\nAll players go at some point and I for one am glad we're getting a decent price for a player we probably, imo, won't miss that much. Also, he obviously wanted to leave and join a CL team.\nBank the £50m and move on I say.\n176 Posted 14/07/2024 at 16:15:48\nWhat it might do is improve the chemistry in midfield - since Garner and Gueye probably worked better in the end than Garner and Onana from a footballing point of view.\nPersonally, I think the real key to getting the team to function much better overall is a high quality right back.\n177 Posted 14/07/2024 at 16:54:11\nYou would have thought that stupid Everton, would have instigated a bidding war, but then the other rumour said that Amadau, wasn't really interested in going to Saudi Arabia, which must have given Villa, a free reign\n178 Posted 14/07/2024 at 17:04:02\nIt will be interesting to see how he goes in a vastly different team with more quality. Good luck to him.\nFeels like the right decision at the right time and probably not the last time we will see this kind of investment approach.\nAt the end of the day it's a gamble buying anyone and I think we've done well on this one.\n179 Posted 14/07/2024 at 17:09:36\nThe reason why you left Goodison not being able to recall him having any brilliant 15 min spells was because he didn't have any.\nI left every away game the same.\n180 Posted 14/07/2024 at 17:15:03\n181 Posted 14/07/2024 at 17:24:17\nI hope the loan for Ugochukwu you mention comes through as you say he is similar in style to Onana. I don't know anything about this player but, having read your informative posts and articles over the years, I am happy to take your word on his attributes until I see him play for myself.\nAttacking full backs have become the key players for most of the top teams and are hard to come by so we will be lucky to find what we need. We should have kept hold of Antonee Robinson and Nkounkou.\n182 Posted 14/07/2024 at 17:26:42\nPeter I agree with your sentiment but given the shocking financial state we are seeing n thanks to Moshiri buy low sell high is the model we need at the moment. Next season after the takeover, move to BMD and scrapping of PSR we can re-evaluate\n183 Posted 14/07/2024 at 17:46:40\nRobinson, on the other hand, would have been a mainstay in this club for years. I don't know if it was Brands or Carlo who pulled the trigger on \"Jedi\" for the £2 million in pocket change but it was the dumbest player move I've ever seen from this club. And that's saying a lot.\n184 Posted 14/07/2024 at 17:47:41\nWhen he put himself in the window a few weeks ago. I think he (like a few of our fans) was expecting them to be queuing around the block\nVilla fans in for the sort of shock we have become accustomed to when the big money signing turns out to be simply not all that.\n185 Posted 14/07/2024 at 18:00:52\nHe impressed Tedesco. He impressed Emery, who watched him at the Euros and then decided to pay a club-record fee for him.\nAnd he impressed the New York Times:\nFrom midfielders in Europe's top-five leagues last season, Onana ranked in the top eight per cent for tackles made per 90 minutes (3.06) and top 13 per cent for ball recoveries (6.89). They are numbers that underline why he matches Emery's vision for what a combative central midfielder should be. Belgium were tactically chaotic for parts of Euro 2024 but manager Domenico Tedesco entrusted Onana to be the lone central midfielder in their last-16 game against France, anchoring Kevin De Bruyne — and keeping Youri Tielemans, a future team-mate with Villa, on the sidelines. Going forward, Onana has a propensity to crash the box, suggesting he is more suitable to replicating Douglas Luiz's role as the all-round midfielder than Kamara, who is more defensively minded and inclined to hold his position. After arriving from Lille in 2022, Onana was used by then-Everton manager Frank Lampard in a similar mould to himself as a player — timing late runs into the penalty area and getting on the end of crosses from out wide. Onana's height, however, meant he tended to make curved movements towards the back post, where he would have the aerial advantage over opposition full-backs. Last season, Onana ranked in the top six per cent of midfielders for aerial duels won, indicating scope that he could, if moulded correctly, become a growing threat in the opposition box and increase his goal tally (he scored three league goals across two years at Everton). Villa desired a deluxe talent and Onana has a considerable bank of experience and a ceiling that will only be elevated under Emery's coaching. It is a sign of what the fruits of Champions League football can buy.\nApologies Ray #181 for mucking up your name. Can't even blame it on Spellcheck.\n186 Posted 14/07/2024 at 18:14:01\n187 Posted 14/07/2024 at 18:26:20\n188 Posted 14/07/2024 at 18:30:34\n189 Posted 14/07/2024 at 18:31:55\nThe lad can play but I have doubts on his mentality and desire.\nPerhaps he will excell, but Everton, comes first every time.\nUTFTs!\n190 Posted 14/07/2024 at 18:50:06\n191 Posted 14/07/2024 at 19:00:54\n192 Posted 14/07/2024 at 19:14:08\nMG, mate, with the greatest respect, you more than anyone have been banging the Bayern/Spain etc. drum (not even knowing if those reports were true). There was no interest in Onana after his come and get me pre-Euro invitation and his mediocre tournament.\nSo, those on here who still bang the he will be better in a better team drum now focus their attention on the one non-Saudi team who we know want to buy Onana: Villa. He might well thrive there, and if he does I'll be pleased for him and first to say sorry.\nWe have to get rid of him. He doesn't fit Dyche's style of play and this Belgo wizard did not play a single second in the April three wins in a week.\nThere are many more on here who are at best sceptical, quizzical, and intrigued (me et al) and at worst dismissive.\nQuite frankly, there are top blues on here who rarely miss a match who are in the \"Onana is not really that good\" camp. It seems that the more matches you attend in person where you get the comprehensive view of the pitch we miss on the box, the more likely you are to be in \"Onana is not really that good\" camp.\nThe view of those true blues if more than good enough for me.\n193 Posted 14/07/2024 at 19:21:33\n194 Posted 14/07/2024 at 20:52:35\n195 Posted 14/07/2024 at 22:41:38\nOnce January comes it will be thirty very long years since Everton, won a trophy, whatever way we have played.\n196 Posted 14/07/2024 at 23:08:14\nThis is the way I want to see us play next season; Ndiaye and Iro…… appear to be the type of players that suit that style.\n197 Posted 15/07/2024 at 02:17:03\n198 Posted 15/07/2024 at 03:32:39\nShhhhh Ashley, you never know, Emery might be reading.\n199 Posted 15/07/2024 at 11:24:23\nFans don't know what they are watching? I think we have all seen enough shite to dispute that ridiculous comment, but each to their own, as always.\n200 Posted 15/07/2024 at 21:43:01\nHe'll pick up the big cheque at Villa every month & then bugger off to Saudi. He's a typical mercenary footballer that we're seeing more of in the Premier League. Arsenal and others sussed him out early doors.\n201 Posted 15/07/2024 at 21:58:54\nGetting worried this thread is going to scupper the deal…..\n202 Posted 17/07/2024 at 11:31:59\n203 Posted 17/07/2024 at 11:44:05\n\"Establishment of independent football regulator, to ensure greater sustainability of the game and strengthen protection for fans.\"\n204 Posted 17/07/2024 at 12:18:56\nAndy Burnham would be just the person to become the independent football regulator.\n205 Posted 17/07/2024 at 12:29:49\n206 Posted 17/07/2024 at 12:54:44\n207 Posted 17/07/2024 at 13:17:14\nImagine Masters's face if Andy was appointed!\n208 Posted 17/07/2024 at 13:29:06\nI suspect his long term ambition might still be leader of the Labour Party and PM.

Now where did I leave the LSD...\n214 Posted 22/07/2024 at 14:57:17\nClever business by Villa as they try — like Everton — to stay the right side of PSR, as the Diaby sale has essentially rendered the Onana signing a \"net zero\" outlay?\nIt's now being reported that Villa are also looking to sell their striker Jhon Duran to another Premier League club, so maybe they will be in the market for another striker as cover for Ollie Watkins? Maybe Calvert-Lewin will become a target?\n215 Posted 22/07/2024 at 15:33:11\n216 Posted 22/07/2024 at 15:36:27\n217 Posted 22/07/2024 at 15:42:19\n218 Posted 22/07/2024 at 15:50:37\nReckon we'll soon see Gnonto and Lindstrom for more speed and guile on the wings and Phillips to make sure there's no food wasted at Finch Farm's eatery.\n219 Posted 22/07/2024 at 15:54:22\n220 Posted 22/07/2024 at 16:01:44\nGood luck to the lad. I was not a great fan of the lad.\n221 Posted 22/07/2024 at 16:04:25\n222 Posted 22/07/2024 at 16:05:11\n223 Posted 22/07/2024 at 16:08:20\nI never really rated the fella, he didn't ever impose himself when on the pitch. Plenty of arm waving and gesturing to the crowd but not enough for me.\nJust need to get this ownership sorted out now then things might start looking up. roll on 17 August. COYB.\n224 Posted 22/07/2024 at 16:13:02\n225 Posted 22/07/2024 at 16:14:31\nBrian Williams. I am also looking forward to Onana's message. He's an intelligent guy, speaks a few languages (not including forked tongue) so I expect it to be a classy one.\nPaul, agreed, we will. Imagine he'll become the player most of the top clubs think he'll become before he moves on to one of the more prestigious European clubs.\n226 Posted 22/07/2024 at 16:15:57\n227 Posted 22/07/2024 at 16:17:21\n228 Posted 22/07/2024 at 16:20:06\nLet's see what we do with the money. Offset PSR or bring in a player or two?\n229 Posted 22/07/2024 at 16:31:24\nI could certainly see the ability he had but always felt he was playing within himself.\nWhy he'd do that I don't know and I'm not going to try'n guess.\n230 Posted 22/07/2024 at 16:44:52\n231 Posted 22/07/2024 at 16:51:37\nI think is going to be more a case of Villains finding out how bad he is. Maybe the Holt end will appreciate his cheerleading.\nHope Thelwell had the decency to wear a mask.\n232 Posted 22/07/2024 at 17:01:34\nBut he's wasted sitting deep, he needs to have licence to go forward and be direct. Remember his first few games for us, I was so excited to see his development. But he's not been able or allowed to show his attacking talents.\nIMO Dyche and Belgium don't play to his strengths.\n233 Posted 22/07/2024 at 17:20:42\n'… to make sure there's no food wasted at Finch Farm's eatery.'\nBrilliant!\n234 Posted 22/07/2024 at 17:21:34\nUnless of course it stretches to cheerleading!\n235 Posted 22/07/2024 at 17:29:54\nCan't think of too many Onana moments that will stick in the memory, just the doh! penalty.\nIf he is the real deal then Aston Villa will provide the platform for take off (or not). Fully expect that he'll slot one past Pickford in his first re-visit to Goodison.\n236 Posted 22/07/2024 at 17:30:54\nOnana was ranked eighth for the most tackles won in the entire Premier League, and sixth for the most aerial duels won out of all midfielders in the league, was that last season?\nBut needs must and, if this means we keep Jarrad Branthwaite, then all the better. Who takes his place then?\n237 Posted 22/07/2024 at 17:32:05\nGood player, not right for us at the moment, might do better at Villa or might not. But he was always well-turned out with nice hair and a big smile and, as far as I know, didn't kick any kittens across the kitchen or anything nasty like that.\nThelwell needs to go out and find a tall player to wave his arms around a lot in front of the Street End as soon as possible.\nGood luck.\n238 Posted 22/07/2024 at 17:37:50\n239 Posted 22/07/2024 at 17:43:33\nI expected improvement when he played for Belgium, I just did not see it, I could not see anything that he did that justified his price tag and \"potential\".\nIroegbunam, our signing from Villa, may prove that we did the better business and +£40M for the transaction.\nI am also excited to see who we bring in with the money, two possibly three new signings that will make our squad stronger, and that will be very welcomed.\n240 Posted 22/07/2024 at 17:46:01\nHe seems intelligent enough to work things out in the right circumstances and perhaps that is with Unai and Villa.\n241 Posted 22/07/2024 at 17:58:31\n242 Posted 22/07/2024 at 18:08:58\nWe had him for 2 years so have already written off £12M of his £30M fee. I suspect the add-ons have not been triggered, unless it was we don't get relegated or the number of arm waves per match!\nLille get 20% of the fee or the profit — that makes it £10M or £4M.\nSo £50M (all in this season's accounts), less the £18M still in the books = £32M, less paid to Lille = £22M or £28M profit.\nFor 2023-24 we have:\nGodfrey — 75% of his fee had been written off so £6M profit\nDobbin — £10m all profit\nIwobi — 80% had been written off so £16m profit\nDemari Gray — £7m profit and\nThe academy kids (Cannon, Simms, Samuels-Smith) £18M\nMaking £57M profit in the books in the year just gone.\nI also reckon we will have a £37m write-down in the books for the existing team (including the two new signings) so just a net £15M to £9M cost. And if Phillips is on a free, LindstrÃ¸m on loan, and Gnoto just £5M a year, then we should be okay for PSR this season.\nThelwell is doing a good job.\n243 Posted 22/07/2024 at 18:16:54\nAttitude is always something that can hinder progress\nbut maybe Villa can get a lot more from him than Everton could. Everton's midfield is very average and that is why we struggle.\nI don't think Onana's departure will affect what we have now but we need desperately to get some real control in that area.\n244 Posted 22/07/2024 at 18:31:53\nMaybe his supposed potential will be realised under a very good manager and when surrounded by better players.\nBased on what he had offered us in the last 2 seasons, I am confident we can find a player just as effective — or ineffective — for a lesser fee and wages.\n245 Posted 22/07/2024 at 18:44:29\nIf you want 'lazy', look at the statues in front him that don't show for the ball or make an off-the-ball run. We are leaders in checking back and playing the ball back to Pickford. I checked that stat and we have over 8 titles for Xpected Passbacks.\nWe are leaders in slow players. We are leaders in players unable to get their head up and play a killer pass.\nDyche wants minimal messing around in his own half. Onana likes to receive the ball on the half turn and potentially take on opportunities in his own half to keep possession, beat the counter-press, and build up attacks. Dyche is comfortable with his keeper and defenders playing it long and scrapping for seconds.\nDyche likes a low block with 4 defenders sitting on the 18-yard box. Which means his midfielders play deep. Onana suits playing higher up, as he has the pace, power and recovery tackle to suit a more adventurous side.\nAt Villa, he will prove to be an outstanding No 6. I think a lot of fans were expecting him to be a box-to-box midfielder, that drives forward creating and scoring goals. He ain't that, and to be fair I don't think there are many around.\n£50M raised that will hopefully will be better utilised on a team short of quality and numbers. Thelwell better be doing better than Beto and Maupay. Some of the links don't inspire confidence.\n246 Posted 22/07/2024 at 18:57:35\nPaul the Esk mentioned on the latest TTB podcast that over the last 8 years Everton have generated £300M+ in profits from player trading. It seems to be one area that we've had some success in.\nSadly, and in view of last week's Friedkin news, I guess we'll see that figure increase before the current transfer window closes.\n248 Posted 22/07/2024 at 19:03:34\n249 Posted 22/07/2024 at 19:05:43\nI remember arguing with my dad in the lower Gwladys one match about Keown! Me in favour, him turning the air blue!!\nLater on, I always thought we had a talent in Materazzi, but he moved on quickly and went on to achieve success.\nGood luck Onana. I suspect in a year or two he will be back on the continent, but who knows? Now about to go and play for Aston “Everton” Villa. I think that's 5 ex players now.\n250 Posted 22/07/2024 at 19:07:17\nNot sure I ever saw anything from him to suggest he will be a big loss. Fellaini was better for me.\n251 Posted 22/07/2024 at 19:21:54\nThe three teams coming up this season are going to be pretty strong, staying in the Premier League isn't going to be a cakewalk.\n253 Posted 22/07/2024 at 19:46:04\n254 Posted 22/07/2024 at 19:56:01\nWe can use the profit to improve the squad and it helps with PSR.\nI saw this stat on the platform formerly known as Twitter kind of makes you think we might not miss him that much\nEverton with / without Amadou Onana starting in the Premier League last season:\nðŸ…¿ï¸ Starts - 23 / 15\nâœ… Wins - 6 / 7\nðŸ¤ Draws - 3 / 6\nâŒ Defeats - 14 / 2\nâš½ï¸ Goals scored per game - 0.96 / 1.2\nðŸ¥… Goals conceded per game - 1.74 / 0.73\n256 Posted 22/07/2024 at 20:08:19\nI've also watched some dross through the 90s, and recently been kept breathless as we limped over the line.\nA low point last season was that 6-0 thumping by Chelsea. That was hard to take. But they turned it around.\n257 Posted 22/07/2024 at 20:19:31\nHe has the talent and attitude to go close to the very top. Sad that Villa is such a step up these days.\n258 Posted 22/07/2024 at 20:36:14\nWe spent big money, got a couple of years out of him, and made a profit.\nI suspect Villa will do the same with him.\nAs long as we do the same again when reinvesting the money this is an example of what good transfer dealing looks like.\n259 Posted 22/07/2024 at 20:44:40\nWithout the takeover going through, I suspect the recruitment this summer is likely to be very pragmatic now — so a loan for Kalvin Phillips could happen.\nI suspect he's more likely than the (very tall) young midfielders we've been linked to in Ugochukwu, Rohl of Freiburg and Richardson of Reims.\n260 Posted 22/07/2024 at 21:02:18\nI hope we bring in Phillips, if there's anyone who can get him back to his Leeds form, it is Dyche. To be honest, he was never getting into the Man City team with Rodri ahead of him.\n261 Posted 22/07/2024 at 22:31:20\nMoney can be used smartly, go to Morishi, or the Everton way, buy a worldy injured star player who will never shine again. Hope for number one.\nThanks for your services, Onana. I will not really miss you, but I guess you have whatever you had to give.\nBut better him go than Branthwaite, who's been much more important for us. Wish he keeps up with us.\n262 Posted 22/07/2024 at 23:11:39\nVidimus\nNulla victoria\nDeborah 128 That is the best clip I've seen in years !!!!\nSomeone mentioned Ken McNaught. I liked him. Great centre half.\nOnana was not the right type of player required during the club's troubled time on the field. He may flourish under Emry.\nWhatever happens, I wish him well.\nThelwell hasn't made the best signings since his arrival. He no longer has a bulging blockage at board level so let's hope he turns that corner, like right now!!!\n263 Posted 22/07/2024 at 23:48:47\nPersonally, I think his PR is better than his play and I'd take the £50M, especially if it meant keeping a truly excellent player like Jarrad.\n264 Posted 23/07/2024 at 00:03:09\n265 Posted 23/07/2024 at 01:09:19\nThat's not a prediction just a belief that judging a player's performance at Everton has to be qualified with acknowledgement that the team overall might be what limits their effectiveness.\nI can only be happy knowing it's Everton that are better off without a player rather than the other way round.\n266 Posted 23/07/2024 at 02:09:12\nI think he will become a top player at Villa, as do most players that leave Everton. That has always been the issue with Everton ever since Moyes left, even our younger players who leave seem to become better players.\nNot advocating the return of Moyes but we really have to revamp our skills coaching system. You could probably count on one hand the amount of players who we have brought to the team that have improved to a higher level since being at Everton in the last 4 years.\n267 Posted 23/07/2024 at 03:01:20\nMartin #263, we got two pretty good seasons and a £20M profit out of Onana, which makes him a very good signing.\nThelwell gets an A for this one.\n268 Posted 23/07/2024 at 03:30:23\nA path to sustainability by buying players with our Premier League spending power from the continent, give them a couple of years experience, and move them on for a decent profit.\nRinse and repeat until we're in a position to financially compete at the top end of the Premier League.\n269 Posted 23/07/2024 at 05:41:23\nAlso being with a team that would be playing in the Champions League.\n270 Posted 23/07/2024 at 06:25:04\nI'm not overly sure about Kalvin Phillips the more I weigh him up (no pun intended).\nHe's been winging it since he left Leeds, he's been unprofessional in gaining weight over a summer so that tells me straight away he's not been the greatest of trainers.\nIf he couldn't get himself going for a move to Man City under Pep, and even under Moyes who for all his faults usually always gets a tune out of players, then I'm not sure why a loan move to Everton would be much different.\nDon't get me wrong: 4 years ago, yes, top player in his position… but right now, I'm just not convinced at all, to be honest with you.\nAt 29 too, a loan move would be unlikely to see a permanent deal next year.\nI just get the feeling this would be another Fabian Delph type signing.\n271 Posted 23/07/2024 at 07:22:31\nPerhaps the best counter-examples being Gareth Barry and James Rodriguez.\nPhillips has looked pretty mediocre in the (admittedly limited) minutes he has had over the last few years. I wouldn't object to a loan on reasonable wages (nothing over £100k certainly).\nBut I certainly hope we would not commit serious money to a player who looks out of shape and form with the best of his career behind him.\nIf we had got him in quickly for a full Dyche pre-season, I would have felt more comfortable about him regaining some spark. Let's see if the deal makes sense.\n272 Posted 23/07/2024 at 08:35:03\nThe likes of Gareth Barry, the late Gary Speed, God rest his soul, and as much as many fans don't like to admit, Ashley Young all belong in the true professionals category.\nYoung has looked after himself very professionally to still get on a football pitch at this level at his age.\nSome players let themselves go badly, Rooney for example.\nI'd like to be proven wrong on Phillips but I wouldn't be throwing too much money his way.\n273 Posted 23/07/2024 at 08:55:16\n274 Posted 23/07/2024 at 09:28:29\nI'll remember him largely for missing a penalty, throwing his arms around a lot, falling over a lot, feigning injury a lot, making the odd last-ditch telescopic leg tackle, and often taking the easy option with the ball.\nNext man up!\n275 Posted 23/07/2024 at 10:24:36\nHe is a ball-on-the-ground footballer, who can play through the middle of the field.\n276 Posted 23/07/2024 at 12:13:14\nI'm gonna agree with you on the \"good business\" statement. But I think it wasn't deliberate… more luck than judgement by Thelwell.\nAs we were looking to improve for the future (or so he said), I am gonna guess he saw Onana staying a few years longer. I can't deny £50M is a good price. But he was an underwhelming performer for the vast majority of appearances. Thelwell gets a B+ from me because he got fortunate.\nI think if we start a policy of risk investment — ie, more Onana types to buy for the purpose of moving on swiftly for profit — then we will flop.\nI look back over the last decades and sadly still see the dreadful dross dragged in and total failure. Huge losses with little quality, especially in front of goal.\nI want stability — throughout — on and off the field. Once that is complete, take evaluation and then decide what to do. So, if that means buying or loaning tried and tested Premier League players to bring a measure of calmness for a few years, so be it.\nOddly mediocre sides can get into Europe. So the lesser competitions may be achievable. We have little financial manoeuvrability because of crooked P&S rules.\nSo avoid big money risk-taking… I know, easier said than done, but that is Thelwell's job.\nMeanwhile, Thelwell needs to get a grip of our piss-poor academy. The U21s finished 25th out of 26 in Premier League 2; the U18s finished 10th out of 14. This is his job. It is without doubt a failure.\nWe should have youngsters leaping into the boots of a crocked or suspended first-teamer, in all positions. A youngster who is so good that the player replaced needs a crowbar and KY to try and force him out.\nSadly, we have nothing of the kind by a long chalk. Dyche won't (and shouldn't) play these kids because our first team is short on numbers. They are not good enough.\nEither turn it around immediately or in 2025-26 scrap it all.\n277 Posted 23/07/2024 at 12:44:36\nSee Beto is shouting his mouth off in the press about shutting up the haters.\nI like the guy for his work rate, but hitting the back of the net from 3 yards out rather than Row Z would be a start!!!\n278 Posted 23/07/2024 at 12:49:44\nDefine a style of play, buy youngish players to fit the style of play, and move them on at a profit.\nNo doubt, not sustainable forever… and I would love some stability at the club but, taking a few examples off a report into how Brighton manage to make a profit on player trading... and purely just taking the fee paid and fee received into account, they haven't done too badly:\nBissouma: paid £15M, received £25M\nCucurella: paid £15.4M, received £63M\nTrossard: paid £15M, received £26M\nMac Allister: paid £7M, received £55M\nCaicedo: paid £4.5M, received £115M\nOf course, the wheels may fall off at some stage and the likes of Chelsea may not be stitched up.\n279 Posted 23/07/2024 at 13:24:32\nI think, without the points deductions, we would have at least finished alongside if not above Brighton.\nPersonal opinions, but I'm never going to aspire to be Brighton.\n280 Posted 23/07/2024 at 13:37:55\nI'm always surprised by people who think they're hated as if they're relevant enough in the public's mind to attract such emotions.\n281 Posted 23/07/2024 at 13:51:45\nIn a few years time, other owners and chairmen of clubs when faced with transfer issues will be heard to say \"What would the Everton board do because they always get it right?\" ðŸ˜€\n282 Posted 23/07/2024 at 14:08:56\nBuying him and selling him at the prices is good business, even better if we bring in decent replacements.\n283 Posted 23/07/2024 at 14:22:20\nI get your Brighton point but think you're doing us a bit of a disservice. The bonkers transfers we had were years ago. In the last 3 seasons we've actually brought in more transfer revenue than spent on players. You have to go back to the 2020-21 season for the last time we had a negative spend.\nSome highlights include Onana (sold for £50M, bought for £33M), Gordon (sold for £40M, cost nothing), Richarlison (sold for £60M, cost £50M). Gray, Kean, Simms, Iwobi etc also sold without a loss I think.\nBrighton have done exceptionally well but we at least seem to have started to learn our lesson, no longer paying massive fees and wages to players with no sell-on value. We can't win them all but hopefully the likes of Tosun and Walcott are a thing of the past.\nWe still can't get rid of Keane mind….\n284 Posted 23/07/2024 at 14:48:01\nUs mortals are the gift that keeps giving.\n285 Posted 23/07/2024 at 14:53:13\n286 Posted 23/07/2024 at 15:04:18\nSo yes, from a financial viewpoint, they've got their buying and selling policies right… but from a playing point of view, it won't be sustainable. Sooner or later, they'll buy a few turkeys.\n287 Posted 23/07/2024 at 15:17:10\nOff the top of my head, I'd say Maupay is the only bad signing, especially because it doesn't appear to have been well thought-out.\nThe jury is very much out on Beto, but he's another who is in the \"we had to do something\" bracket, and things like this usually only happen when a club hasn't got any money to spend in the first place. Unless you're Steve Walsh or Marcel Brands…\nIf Onana gets pace and movement in front of him and suddenly improves, I'll feel sorry for Sean Dyche, Paul T, because it will be obvious he never managed him properly.\n288 Posted 23/07/2024 at 15:30:59\nDo you realise Everton had an academy ban which halted recruitment there?\nAlso, I don't know if you have seen… but Everton are absolutely skint.\n289 Posted 23/07/2024 at 16:22:59\nEverton's academy has been dreadful for way way too long. What is the point of recruiting kids who are not good enough and never are going to be? It is pointless and much more importantly, cruel.\nI don't know about the halting of recruitment as we have been buying youngsters every season since I can recall. Maybe you can elaborate. Thing is, it hasn't stopped the club having a functioning academy.\nIt needs a total rethink. Revitalising. For example, why not take on say six young kids who meet a really high standard (way better than now) and concentrate on them. Have them coached and mentored intensely.\nTraining with the first team. Going to matches with the side. Loaned out to clubs to learn the craft on the pitch etc. Okay, that is just an idea. not a suggestion.\nRemove the sausage factory. Do we need kids from 8 or 9 or younger? No. Do we need kids teams or U18s and U21s when not one is going to make it out of squads of 20+ per side?\nBy definition, it is supposed to be special for those who are excelling. I've watched them. I see school teams and West Cheshire League. Why run an academy when it isn't working?\nAnd Thelwell is their boss. Yes, we are skint. Rethink and cut your cloth.\n290 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:00:43\nI'm an old arse who has seen the best at the club and suffering this interminable catastrophic end-of-days football and deterioration of this once great club over the decades is killing me.\nThelwell's time has seen him shift out a lot of \"deadwood\" and waste of wages, plus youngsters and players too old for the academy but who were not part of first team plans. Great. As it should be.\nHowever, I am looking hard to find where he has set his mark and illuminated our footballing sides. What has he done to improve upon the players he has shipped out?\nLast season, we had less first-team players compared to the seasons previously, by some numbers. And no goal-scorers still.\nThe necessity of Ashley Young proving the state of affairs of the club had now reached an all time low, within recent memory.\nConsidering his position during the Wolves arising from the ashes and spectacular players that were recruited on a tight budget, was I expecting too much? He has been here a couple of years now.\nI am asking tough questions because Everton have to improve. Arguably, since Dyche arrived, they have.\nIt's Thelwell's job to get the players to improve the side in liaison with Dyche. It is a bloody hard one. Treading water and getting away with it is not improvement.\nI am not convinced Thelwell is going to advance us or is the right guy. But I am eager to be proved wrong. As DoF, he is the boss of the academies. They have gone downhill. I expect him to be tearing a new one into everyone involved. Staff and players. Last season should not repeat itself.\nAt the momentt some may feel I am being too harsh. Welcome to Nil Satis Nisi Optimum.\n291 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:02:33\nAs for his \"cheerleader\" qualities, it annoys me when players tell the crowd to make a noise. It's the players job to make the crowd excited, not the other way round.\n292 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:29:01\nI understand what you're saying but, if you have got a Director of Football with no money (I'm going off last summer), then him and the manager have obviously had to devise a plan to keep Everton in the Premier League.\nIt does seem like Thelwell and Dyche have a close working relationship and both seem to understand what is needed to achieve this, even if it hasn't been pretty.\nI think the route the club has taken since Moshiri came in has contributed massively towards the downfall of the academy but I couldn't blame Thelwell for this because, although the man will obviously be well paid, I also believe he has been given a thankless task at Everton.\nOne thing both Dyche and Thelwell have proved is that they are absolutely fine with being tasked with working under enormous (on fucking steroids) pressure, so I genuinely find it hard in criticizing either of them, if I'm being honest, Martin, and I'm just glad they both seem to be arl arses as well!\n293 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:40:38\nYou might not have heard but Everton compete for kids with Man City, Man Utd and Liverpool. Even Newcastle are taking our players at a young age.\nWhy?\nMoney.\n294 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:56:42\nI think you're directing your frustration at the wrong people. Definitely agree (as I am sure everyone does) that the current situation is not acceptable — but you seem to be blaming the people who have been stabilising the club and sorting it out.\nIf you want to see improved output from the academy soon, then you have to buy it in. Liverpool, for example, buy a very high volume of players between about 14 and 17 for their academy.\nAs Jack notes, we had a ban on that sort of thing until recently but Thelwell has stepped it up, buying Graham, Benjamin and Loney this summer.\nIf you want improved output from the homegrown kids, then be prepared to invest and wait 5 to 10 years. That is what Chelsea, Man City and others did...\n295 Posted 23/07/2024 at 18:24:31\nWith the examples offered, seems I am doing the club a disservice re recent transfers. Too easy to forget the good deals!\n296 Posted 23/07/2024 at 18:57:55\nAn example is the theme of this thread, Onana. Expensive and shipped out. Dyche had him warming the bench when others were available last season. That says to me that it isn't as you think.\nToffeeWebbers were screaming for Chermiti. Dyche didn't fancy him. They were also deriding Beto and Young.\nMaupay is a duffer. And was loaned out but Brentford don't want him. Loaners haven't exactly been singing like Thelwell and Dyche are in tune. So on a tight budget, it was not a duet in harmony. Season three soon for Thelwell. Let's see what happens.\nI have gotten behind Dyche 100%. If not for him, we would be sunk. The man is exactly who we need right now and has performed miracles. He has my full support and massive gratitude.\n297 Posted 23/07/2024 at 18:59:00\nLet's agree to disagree.\n298 Posted 23/07/2024 at 19:04:54\nThanks for your explanation.\nMy point is our academy has been terrible and gotten worse. Let's see how the new lads do. They are gonna need lots of support and let's hope last season was a blip.\nBut I fear our academy is just wash, spin repeat. A definition of madness.\nI don't rate our DoF. You think the opposite. But we both love the Blues.\n299 Posted 23/07/2024 at 21:56:21\nYou make some good points, but at 28 he's still worth a gamble, especially under Dyche, if his wages are subsidised.\nI wouldn't put him in the same category as Delph, who I said at the time was a shocking buy, because of his injury record, and it definitely backfired, but Phillips doesn't have any injury issues.\n300 Posted 23/07/2024 at 22:18:04\nIf Moyes couldn't get a tune out of him, I am struggling to see us turn around a star that's been way off it for 2 years.\nI'd far rather the transfer fee and wages be put into a player with better form and fitness.\nHas the hallmarks of a Dele Alli Mk 2. You aren't signing the player from 3 odd years ago, you're signing a player way, way off it. Avoid!\n301 Posted 23/07/2024 at 22:34:50\n302 Posted 24/07/2024 at 08:14:34\nWe want the best and that is expected from day one.\n303 Posted 27/07/2024 at 12:23:21\nThey've the money, champions league football and he will offer back up to Watkins in lesser games.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
