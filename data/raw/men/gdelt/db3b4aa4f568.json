You guys have gone down in history. Thank you very much.\n‘This is a magnificent achievement for the club and hopefully is going to get us on the road where we absolutely deserve to be, which is at the very top. Thank you very much.’\nSpeaking in his post-match press conference, Postecoglou admitted he had not held talks with Levy over his future as Tottenham manager.\n‘No, no planned meetings. I haven’t had any discussions, no one has spoken to me about anything,’ Postecoglou said.\n‘Maybe they felt like they don’t need to or they were waiting for this game.\n‘What I do know is, I’ll go back to my hotel room, get my family and friends together, open up a nice bottle of scotch, have a couple of quiet ones, get ready for a massive parade on Friday, play Brighton on Sunday. And then Monday I’ll go on holiday with my beautiful family because I deserve it. And que sera sera.’\nMeanwhile, Gareth Bale believes Postecoglou still has a future at Spurs despite the team’s poor Premier League form this season.\n‘I think only the chairman can decide, to be honest,’ Bale told TNT Sports.\nMore Trending\n‘There’s been so much talk about whether he goes or whether he doesn’t.\n‘I guess it’ll be interesting to see that because he’s won a trophy, the first Tottenham manager to do so in a long time. So I guess the board has some decisions to make.\n‘I like the football that he plays. Obviously he lacks a bit of a plan B. But tonight showed there is a plan B. There’s a different side to how he’s played.\n‘So I guess if he also matures as a manager and brings that defensive side to his teams, of course he can still have great success here.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Europa League final: Rubbish game, scrappy goal but Tottenham won, so they don’t give a monkey’s\nMORE: How much money do Championship play-off final winners get for Premier League promotion?\nMORE: Enzo Fernandez reveals dream Chelsea signing ahead of summer transfer window",
