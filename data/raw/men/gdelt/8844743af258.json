  "body_text": "Manchester United are reported to have registered an interest in signing Inter Milan goalkeeper Andre Onana.\nAndre Onana played under Erik ten Hag at Ajax, and while the pair had a bumpy ride in their last season, with Onana suspended and then pushing through a move to Inter, that may not put club or player off a move.\nAccording to The Guardian, Manchester United have ‘registered an interest’ in signing Onana from Inter this summer.\nThe Serie A side are expected to have to sell players due to financial issues.\nAndre Onana favours Manchester United move\nThe Guardian report Andre Onana favours a move to Manchester United over Chelsea, who are also interested.\nThis could be down to a combination of Ten Hag, and the Red Devils being able to offer Champions League football.\nOnana starred in the Champions League final, impressing with his footwork and shot-stopping ability.\nPep Guardiola told his pre-final press conference, “Identifying the space and emptying the midfield is a special quality. Normally, teams have great keepers, but he [Onana] is exceptional with his feet.”\nHe added after the game that Onana made the game more difficult for his City side.\nOnana was excellent in the final in Turkey, and really showed what Manchester United have been lacking, with David de Gea simply not good enough with his feet.\nDe Gea’s contract has not yet been signed, and even if he does, there is no guarantee he will stay on as first choice.\nOnana, 27, is a Cameroon international and also a former teammate of Lisandro Martinez and Antony at Ajax.\nThe Guardian report Manchester United are also considering a move for Porto’s Diogo Costa, four years younger than Onana at 23.",
