  "body_text": "Eddie Howe would have smiled knowingly: on a lush, green Queen’s University pitch in south Belfast, Wilfred Bouma was delivering instructions about a 4-3-3 attacking formation creating space against a 4-4-2 defence. As Bouma spoke, assessors from the Irish Football Association observed and made notes. This is the UEFA A Licence coaching course. Fifteen years ago, it was Howe covering this territory, this grass.\nAdvertisement\nHowe completed his A diploma with the Irish FA and returned to Belfast in 2011 to study for his Pro Licence. On each occasion, Howe impressed both his peers on the course and his assessors.\nAs Kieran Harding, one of the IFA tutors then and now, says: “All I can tell you is Eddie was the same man then that he is today: quiet, thoughtful, always respectful. When there were sessions on, he would ask more questions than others. He wouldn’t do it in front of the group but in a quiet way to the side.\n“And when he put on his own sessions, they were exceptional.”\nThat last word — exceptional — was heard repeatedly regarding Howe during two days of watching the latest A Licence candidates in Belfast recently.\nMichael Carvill agrees. Then doing his B badge while Howe was on his A course — and now an IFA tutor — Carvill says: “Eddie just stood out. No arrogance, keen to learn and there was something about him that was really infectious. He was inquisitive and we say it now — you can tell who’ll be top coaches because they always want more. It’s an addiction; it’s like they almost need their hit of football.\n“I remember a set-piece drill. The tutors would have put on a session and it would have been detailed — these were coaches from a coach education background. But when Eddie did his, the level of detail went up again. You could almost feel the tutors going ‘Wow, this is brilliant’. The timings, everyone’s role and responsibilities, the numbers involved, blocking, movement. It set it apart.”\nNewcastle United fans will read this and think of some set-piece routines seen last season.\nBelfast may seem an unexpected place for Howe, an Englishman, to gain the two most important qualifications UEFA require to manage at elite levels, but quietly the Irish FA has earned a reputation for the thoughtfulness, fun and affordability of its UEFA C, B, A and Pro courses.\nAdvertisement\nAt one stage last season, three English Premier League managers at the time — Howe, Sean Dyche and Gary O’Neil — were IFA graduates, Hull City manager Liam Rosenior, too. Emma Hayes is another — and also someone who attracts the description “exceptional”.\nGaizka Mendieta, Luis Garcia and the highly rated Sporting Lisbon manager Ruben Amorim are three more who have been through the system here. Former Chelsea player Tiago Mendes, who became Diego Simeone’s assistant at Atletico Madrid, is another.\n“We have never advertised,” says Sean-Paul Murray, the head of coach education. “It’s word of mouth.”\nRangers manager Michael Beale was here; now his assistant Harry Watling is over and Howe offered further proof of word mouth a few weeks ago, telling The Athletic he chose the IFA venue because his assistant Jason Tindall had been.\n“I went there because Jason had gone out the year before and he highly recommended it,” Howe said. “The timing fitted in, so we both went out again.\n“I remember the courses — I did two there — really fondly. I made some good friends, people I’m still in contact with. And I learned from the courses, they had some really good guest speakers. When you do your coaching badges, you get so much from it.”\nOne of the influential memories Howe may have taken away from his Pro Licence was the mock job interview. The IFA ask candidates to prepare in pairs and Howe’s partner was ex-Notts County, Derby and Celtic player Tommy Johnson, who just happens to be a Newcastle fan from Gateshead.\nJohnson has since become one of the IFA coaches overseeing diplomas in Belfast and having assessed Bouma’s session, Johnson recalls how “Eddie was meticulous, quiet, but got his point across. Very bright.\n“He was at Burnley at the time. On the course, he was very astute and knew his stuff. We had the mock interview together — you’re given scenarios about a squad, who you would release, keep, buy, sell. Eddie was like the manager and I was like the assistant. Even then, you knew he could do it. As a Geordie, I’m delighted (he’s Newcastle manager).”\nAdvertisement\nHarding recalls that task and says: “Eddie blew everyone out of the water — his attention to detail, presentation skills, background work, presenting his philosophy. This unassuming guy, every time he did something our response was ‘wow’. His personality, his intellect and his understanding of the game made him stand out.”\nThe relevance of Howe being effective in his mock interview will be noted in Newcastle’s boardroom. His real-time job interview in 2021, conducted on Zoom, was said to have been outstanding.\nIn May 2008, when Howe arrived at Belfast’s Stranmillis student accommodation block — candidates now stay in a swish hotel — he was 31, player-coach at Bournemouth and yet to have an interview. Seven months later he was made manager of a club where the bailiffs were at the door and which had a 17-point deduction. The Minus 17 documentary reveals the scale of the mess Howe faced and dealt with.\n“When I took the job, I think I’d done one FA coaching course to that point,” he said. “I think when I started I was coaching really on my experiences as a player, from watching managers, from being quite an analytical thinker throughout my career, it sort of helped me start my journey of coaching.”\nThe “coaching journey” is a phrase heard on courses. It is emphasised that it is not the same for everyone. Coaches such as Murray and Harding are also realistic about what can be achieved in a condensed period.\n“You can’t produce a coach in six months,” Murray says. “What you can do is enthuse one to go and work in coaching for 10 years.” They would all concur with Howe when he said: “I think there’s no substitute for actually doing the job and, since being in the job, I’ve also travelled to loads of countries and watched loads of different training sessions and enhanced my knowledge that way.”\nThat is not to downplay the benefits of courses. Some of those are formal, some informal; the IFA set time aside for coffee breaks, make sure meals are consumed at round tables and encourage candidates to socialise in the evening.\nAdvertisement\n“Eddie would have gone down to the bar,” Carvill says, “but he was always professional, knew when it was time to go. But we say it on the course, lots of the relationships and learning is done in the bar or at the coffee machines. Friendships are made and grow; they learn from each other.\n“You have people from different cultures — we’ve someone here who’s worked for Sao Paulo in Brazil. His tactical setup is completely different from someone playing in European football, so he gets asked about differences in training, tactics, everything. I think that’s the beauty of these courses.”\nTutors remain in touch afterwards. The diploma is the qualification and the Association grants the licence to use it, which is “re-validated” every three years, although the IFA prefer an annual re-assessment and was in contact with Howe in May.\nThe social network is something Howe touched on — and should he choose to at Newcastle, he could ask academy head Steve Harper, loans manager Shola Ameobi, or former players Lee Clark or Jonas Gutierrez what they thought of the IFA courses. All did them and ex-defender Steven Taylor was there recently.\nAs Howe said, another aspect absorbed was the guest speakers.\n“You build relationships with people you’ve never met, contacts you keep throughout, and you learn things from either the speakers or the courses themselves. I remember one: Watt Nicoll, who was a motivational speaker. I kept in contact with him and he came to see us in Bournemouth and did a few presentations down there. He was amazing. I took a lot from him.”\nNicoll is retired now, but his work helped coaches and players consider personalities. A recent guest, Jonny Bloomfield, gave a talk on sleep which again focused on personalities and whether players rooming together have similar or different sleep patterns. It makes coaches think.\nAdvertisement\nThis is the human element of coach education to go alongside the tactical and practical. It has been seen again in one of this year’s Pro Licence pairings — Joey Barton and Ronny Johnsen.\n“In terms of personalities, you couldn’t get more different,” Murray says of the former players of Manchester City and United, but Barton and Johnsen gelled to produce a convincing presentation. As Murray adds: “They all say coaching and talking in front of their peers is nerve-wracking, demanding.\n“But if you want a job, you have to stand in front of people and present. If they can’t sell themselves, they aren’t going to get a job and the way the game is going with American owners — it’s business, entertainment — your first interview might be your last.”\nSome come with more experience than others: Bouma has 37 Netherlands caps and played Champions League and World Cup football, while others are starting out in the amateur game.\n“But they’ve all got experiences,” Murray says. “It’s important to value that.”\nUnderstanding the nature of experience is another matter; Murray digresses into Gary O’Neil, one of Howe’s successors at Bournemouth.\n“Gary did all his badges here. On his first session, I was asked what I thought. I said the only negative feedback I could give Gary is that I don’t like his boots,” Murray says.\n“It was the best session I’d seen — attacking runs from midfield. It wasn’t new what he was saying, it was his manner, dealing with players, painting pictures. He was giving explanations as to why he was saying what he was saying. He had the coaching sciences nailed. He was calm, concise, had clarity similar to Eddie — in that he’s quiet and unassuming — but the attention to detail, the questions he asked, he had a thirst for knowledge. Gary O’Neil has something, I would love to play for him.”\nAdvertisement\nAfter his coaching session, Bouma — “Freddie” to everyone — talks of being struck by that morning’s guest speaker, former Northern Ireland international and Ipswich Town manager Jim Magilton.\nIn England, Bouma played for Aston Villa — the course was recommended to him by Villa colleagues Stiliyan Petrov and Gabby Agbonlahor; in the Netherlands, he had two separate stints with PSV Eindhoven, where he has been coaching the B team.\nAn external assumption would be that Bouma wants to manage PSV, but that is not his current trajectory and may never be. What he likes about the course, and Magilton’s words, is the importance placed on being a good coach at whatever level.\n“A lot of head coaches were captains of their team,” Bouma says. “I was never a captain, I was always a follower. But I’m a good follower, so what I’m thinking is that maybe I can be a good assistant one day.\n“We are all babies in coaching. We know what’s in our heads because we have been in the game, but to produce it out there? It’s a puzzle, to get the right bits at the right moment. Being a good footballer does not mean being a great manager, head coach or assistant.”\nBouma has been managed and coached by, among others, Martin O’Neill, Bert van Marwijk, Huub Stevens and Guus Hiddink — “he was something else”. So he has experiences to draw upon. Would it make him return to Belfast to do his Pro Licence?\n“It depends. So many think they can do it, but the pressure…\n“I think head coaches are born — Eddie Howe is one.”",
