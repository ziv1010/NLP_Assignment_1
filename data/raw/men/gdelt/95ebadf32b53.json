  "body_text": "At the height of Newcastle United’s antsy, angst-ridden summer of 2025, with star striker Alexander Isak refusing to train or play, a senior figure at the club ran through a list of unappetising options. In a perfect world, Isak would have been convinced to stay for one more season, but persuasion had curdled; in an incendiary statement on social media, the Sweden international had written about broken promises, lost trust and fractured relationships.\nAdvertisement\nNewcastle were left with a couple of stark choices: keep Isak against his will, in the hope he could be reintegrated, or cut their losses. The first of these felt vanishingly unlikely — bridges had been torched and bulldozed, not merely burnt — and the second carried repercussions. Not only would the club be losing a world-class centre-forward who had scored 20-plus league goals for them in each of the previous two seasons, there was also a deep concern about how selling Isak would be viewed.\nAs that senior figure, speaking anonymously because they were not authorised to discuss club strategy, put it: “If we let Alex go now, what message does it send to the rest of the dressing-room?” The question was not just about Newcastle’s place in the Premier League pecking order, but about the consequences of a player’s behaviour.\nIf Isak could throw a hissy-fit and still get his desired move, would others in the squad follow suit? Would a precedent be set?\nIsak did leave, joining Liverpool for a British record fee of £125million ($168.1m at the current rate) in a transfer which is yet to bring any of the involved parties much in the way of joy. Isak is out injured, Liverpool have flailed as reigning champions and Newcastle’s first XI immediately became worse. Their late foray into the market to sign new forwards was tinged with desperation, and a 2025-26 season which automatically became transitional with his exit is now locked in a cycle of false dawns and corners turning into cul-de-sacs.\nIt is not all gloomy. After too much churn — as well as a vacuum — at the top of the club, Newcastle now have an energetic chief executive in David Hopkinson and a well-regarded, collegiate sporting director in Ross Wilson. Their team have competed on four fronts, including in the Champions League, where they play PSV of the Netherlands at St James’ Park today (Wednesday). With two of their eight league-phase games to play, a win against the back-to-back Dutch champions guarantees them at least a place in next month’s play-offs to decide which eight clubs complete the last-16.\nAnd speaking of Dutchmen, in an early test of that post-Isak messaging, Sven Botman last week agreed a new long-term contract.\nAdvertisement\nOn his day — injuries mean there have not quite been enough of them — the 26-year-old is a supreme centre-half, both powerful and gifted on the ball. Like his team-mates Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali, Lewis Hall and Tino Livramento, he is one of those players you could build a future around.\nBotman was also close to Isak. When the striker left for Anfield, the central defender posted a picture of them together on Instagram with the following comment: “What started off as team-mates grew into one of my rare best friendships. No more words needed, Brother. All the best in your next chapter.”\nThis, to put it mildly, did not reflect the prevailing mood on Tyneside, nor did it reflect suggestions that Isak had let down head coach Eddie Howe and his team-mates. Not all of them felt like that, clearly.\nAs a player, Botman still has a lot to prove and a lot to give — he has started only nine of the 22 Premier League games so far this season and it was just six of the 38 last time, the vast majority of those absences being fitness-related — but the fact he intends to prove it and give it for Howe’s team carries psychologically heft. In those terms, Botman’s commitment to Newcastle feels substantive, on and off the pitch. It is a sign that important players do not believe ambition has withered.\n“It’s really important that when we enter those negotiations, the players that you’re discussing terms with have a good feel for their football club, for us, the people who work with them every day, for the supporters, for the ownership, that they feel this is the right place for them to continue their development and their journey,” Howe told reporters. “I’m really pleased that Sven feels that way about the football club.\n“It’s been a tough few months for him with difficult injury problems, setbacks. He’s had to show real strength of character because he’s someone that always wants to play. He’s desperate to help the team, he’s very ambitious, determined. He’s got great qualities and we have really missed him when he hasn’t played — it took us a long time to adjust. We’re seeing the very early signs of him returning to his best level, so hopefully that can stay the same for many years to come.”\nBotman’s longest absence for Newcastle was for almost nine months after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee surgery in March 2024. This season, there have been hamstring issues, some sketchy form as he groped for match sharpness and a difficulty in dislodging Dan Burn as the team’s left-sided centre-half.\nAdvertisement\n“When Sven first came to the club (from French side Lille in summer 2022), he was an instant hit with us,” Howe said. “His early form was magnificent, he was part of a back four that conceded very few goals and part of a team that suffered very few defeats. Hopefully he can get back to his very best form. When he was at that level, for me he was one of the best defenders in the Premier League, without a doubt.”\nThis is Botman’s aim, too.\n“That’s what I’m striving for,” he said. “It has been a difficult two years, but I feel like I’m getting back to full fitness and great form. I’m enjoying my football.”\nHis next step, surely, is a first senior cap for the Netherlands which, notwithstanding a couple of call-ups to the squad only to be an unused substitute, feels like a glaring miss from his CV. “I’m a believer in that if you’re in good shape, these things will come,” he said, adding, “of course, there’s a chance”, of him making this summer’s World Cup.\nBotman agreeing to give the best years of his career to Newcastle during a season of sweat and labour is a vote of confidence in Howe and the club’s general direction of travel.\n“This club has huge potential,” Botman said. “I just love being part of it. Since I stepped through the door, we have already achieved great things. We definitely want more. Winning the Carabao Cup last season was really nice and we want to have more trophies.\n“We are setting ourselves a goal to be in the Champions League spots every season and that’s what we’re aiming for. With the group we have, that’s what we should be achieving. I’m looking forward to being part of it.”",
