So Man United are waiting to understand how much they can really invest in the summer transfer window on the striker, and obviously a Champions League budget would be completely different.\n“So that’s going to be a really important point for United. There is interest in Osimhen for sure, from Man United.”\nDON’T MISS ➡️ Man Utd plotting brutal HIJACK of ‘powerful’ French attacking talent\nAll change in Man Utd frontline\nAt this stage of the season, TEAMtalk understands that Osimhen is enjoying life with Galatasaray. He feels loved by the fans, fully trusts the club’s project, and has developed a strong bond with the people around him. However, despite his happiness in Turkey and recent statements by Galatasaray’s management, Osimhen is very likely to take on a new challenge next season.\nArsenal still have the attacker shortlisted as they hunt a new striker, but it’s United who remain the ones to watch.\nIndeed, TEAMtalk can reveal that the Red Devils could offload BOTH Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee if they find adequate replacements for the duo this summer in what’s likely to be a major overhaul at Old Trafford.\nAnother one of those replacements could be Ipswich star Delap, who United are currently battling Chelsea for.\nAs we revealed last week, Chelsea and United have both made fresh approaches for the England Under-21 star, with Delap expected to quit Portman Road for a fee of just £30million due to a relegation clause in his contract.\nThe 22-year-old attacker, who would be keen on a move to Old Trafford even if there is no European football next season, has bagged an impressive 12 Premier League goals this season.\nLatest Man Utd news\n🔴⚫ Man Utd put ‘damaged’ star up for sale after Amorim decides enough is enough\n🔴⚫ Ruthless Amorim in brutal Andre Onana verdict as Man Utd eye £124m double signing\n🔴⚫ Man Utd transfer clause triggered with payment now guaranteed",
