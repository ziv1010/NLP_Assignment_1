There’s no shortage of action, from a fiery Madrid derby to an all-German showdown.\nWe’ve broken down the five biggest clashes to guide our betting predictions. So, whether you’re backing the favourites or searching for a lucrative cash-out, here’s what you need to know before placing your wagers.\nAdvertisement\nReal Madrid vs Atlético Madrid\nThe Madrid derby is set to be a spectacle for football fans. But for the players and managers? Probably more of a headache.\nDon’t expect a goal-fest just because there’s a plethora of attacking talent. With city bragging rights on the line and one serious contender about to pack their bags, this could be a gritty battle instead of an all-out shootout. We’ve already had two La Liga dress rehearsals this season for Wednesday’s clash, and both have ended in 1-1 draws. Betting under 2.5 goals at 22/25? Not a bad shout.\nEven with Real Madrid’s patchy form, Atlético Madrid got the short end of the stick facing Carlo Ancelotti’s squad this early. Los Blancos are heating up at the right time, shaking off their league-phase stumble with a Kylian Mbappé-inspired takedown of Manchester City. His strike partners aren’t too shabby either. Vinícius Júnior and Jude Bellingham are more than capable of stealing the show. The both teams to score bet at 10/11 seems like a no-brainer.\nBut, Atléti won’t be showing up empty-handed. Antoine Griezmann’s magic, now paired with Julian Álvarez’s lethal finishing, makes them a serious threat.\nThe bets: BTTS at 10/11 and under 2.5 goals at 22/25\nFor more stories like this click here to follow The Athletic’s sports betting section and have them added to your feed.\nBorussia Dortmund vs Lille\nBVB may not be flying in the Bundesliga, but last season’s silver medallists know how to step it up under the European lights. Niko Kovač’s side have bagged 25 goals (third behind Barcelona and Real Madrid) powered by a red-hot Serhou Guirassy. The Guinea international is the surprise Golden Boot front-runner with 10 goals, edging out stars like Robert Lewandowski, Erling Haaland and Harry Kane. With Guirassy firing and Dortmund rolling, it’s no shock they’re favoured to strike first at 8/13.\nWho doesn’t love an underdog? Lille certainly fit the bill. Les Dogues stunned both Madrid sides earlier in the tournament and, despite slipping up in Ligue 1, showed their bite with a 6-1 demolition of Feyenoord in January. Canadian star Jonathan David is their main man, netting six UCL goals this campaign. With his contract up this summer, expect him to put on a show for potential suitors.\nAdvertisement\nBoth teams scoring (4/5) feels like a safe bet considering their form, but Dortmund’s firepower and pedigree give them the edge. Odds suggest a 2-1 scoreline for BVB (15/2) is the most likely outcome.\nThe bets: Dortmund to score first at 8/13 and 2-1 Dortmund as the most likely correct score at 15/2\nBayern Munich vs Bayer Leverkusen\nIt’s an all-German showdown as reigning Bundesliga champions Leverkusen take on six-time European winners Bayern. These teams are inseparable this season, producing two league draws (1-1 last September, and 0-0 at the BayArena this month) while occupying the top two spots in the standings. Expect another razor-tight contest here.\nXabi Alonso’s side have looked well put-together in Europe, with one less defeat and one more draw than Bayern in the group phase. They aren’t as invincible as last season, but with Florian Wirtz pulling the strings and Patrik Schick lurking up top, they remain a serious threat. Meanwhile, Vincent Kompany’s men limped through the playoff round, squeezing past Celtic thanks to a last-gasp Alphonso Davies winner. But, with the ever-prolific Kane (21 goals in 20 Bundesliga matches) leading the line and Jamal Musiala’s creativity, the Bavarians shouldn’t be underestimated.\nBayern lead the Champions League in possession (63.4 per cent) and will be happy to dictate play, but Leverkusen’s counterattacks could sting. Given the recent form between these sides, an interesting betting combination could be Bayern to win or draw, over 1.5 first-half goals and both teams to score at 14/5.\nThe bet: Bayern to win or draw plus over 1.5 first half goals plus both teams to score at 14/5\nBenfica vs Barcelona\nBarcelona couldn’t have asked for a better round of 16 draw. Instead of facing a surging Paris Saint-Germain, they got a Benfica side that barely topped Monaco in the playoffs. Barca should use this fixture to re-assert their dominance after a wild 5-4 win against this week’s opponents in the group stage.\nAdvertisement\nConsidering the Blaugrana are the clear favourites, Benfica need to lock in. Shutting down a Barca attack that has netted a tournament-high 28 goals this season is a tall order, especially when Lewandowski (nine goals) and Raphinha (eight goals) are in lethal form. The Spanish giants haven’t lost in 2025, and with wonderkid Lamine Yamal dazzling in the box, Hansi Flick’s attack looks unstoppable.\nMeanwhile, Benfica’s hopes rest on the leadership of veteran Ángel Di María, who still has plenty of magic despite being near retirement.\nThe odds, possibly using the group stage results for inspiration, are implying a lot of goals will be scored. Over 2 goals (2/13) is the safest play, while under 5.5 (1/7) and over 2.5 (10/21) offer more value but higher risk. Expect the second half to be the highest scoring (1/1), with Barca’s stars putting on a late show. This should be a fun game — just maybe not for the hosts.\nThe bets: Over 2 goals at 2/13 and second half as the highest scoring half at 1/1\nParis Saint-Germain vs Liverpool\nLiverpool topped their group and are soaring domestically, but their form has been wobbly. The Reds have failed to win six of their last 14 games, suggesting they’re not quite firing on all cylinders. But when Arne Slot’s side clicks, there’s no stopping them – just ask Manchester City. Mohamed Salah is enjoying a goal-heavy campaign, while Virgil van Dijk is a confident force on the backline.\nAfter a sluggish group stage start, PSG are moving through the gears. The French champions are on a winning streak, but at times they’ve had to work for it. A 4-2 comeback victory over Man City showcased their resilience and grit. In other instances, they’ve flexed their ruthlessness by shutting opposing teams out.\nThis post-Mbappé PSG is finding its rhythm, with Ousmane Dembélé leading the charge and January signing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia offering additional firepower.\nAdvertisement\nConsidering the talent on both sides, this one feels like a toss-up. The bookmakers gave PSG an edge to win the first leg (possibly due to playing at home), but Liverpool still have better odds to qualify. If it’s too risky to bet the overall winner, turn to the attacking markets instead. The odds are saying to expect goals in both halves (1/2), with both teams to score at 10/21.\nThe bets: A goal in both halves at 1/2 and BTTS at 10/21\nMore Champions League stories\n- Last-16 draw analysed: Liverpool-PSG tops bill alongside Madrid derby\n- Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate took their partnership to a new level\n- Champions League projections 2024-25: Who will lift the trophy in May?\n(Photo of Kylian Mbappé: Denis Doyle / Getty Images)",
