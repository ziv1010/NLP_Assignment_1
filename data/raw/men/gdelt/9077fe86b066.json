  "body_text": "EA FC 25: five Career Mode changes that can make it better than EA FC 24\nCareer Mode will always be a fan-favourite game mode, but there's lots that can be improved in EA FC 25\nCareer Mode has been one of the most popular game modes for over a decade in FIFA and EA Sports FC, but after a dismal EA FC 24, there's plenty of room for improvement ahead of EA FC 25.\nLike the majority of game modes that were edited ahead of EA FC 24, EA Sports seemingly sold us a dream with Career Mode in EA FC 24, with the additions that impressed at first sadly falling flat. The updated match simulation and spectator system just hasn't worked as well as it should have, and Tactical Visions aren't as in-depth and detailed as many players had hoped, leaving Career Mode players underwhelmed.\nA game mode that players complain has been forgotten about at times, Career Mode is a bit of a sleeping giant, and there's endless potential to improve both manager and player Career Mode in EA FC 25. If EA wants to make Career Mode the best it's ever been in EA FC 25, we think this is what should happen.\nHow Career Mode can improve for EA FC 25\nDespite some big changes being made in EA FC 24, fans are crying out for lots more to be added - or even taken out - ahead of EA FC 25. These are five of the changes that I think the majority of Career Mode players would like to see.\nAcademy football overhaul\nIt seems now more than ever before that teams are putting lots of trust and investment into their academy set-ups to either find the next superstar to lead their club to glory or to sell on for big transfer fees. With this in mind, I think it's awful that the current academy setup in Career Mode is as bad as it is, and it's in desperate need of an overhaul.\nIn Manager Career Mode, players are extremely limited in what they can do with young, low-rated players. Either your 50-rated, 17-year-old prospect will sit in your reserves, not play a minute of football, and fail to improve, or you will send them on loan for multiple years, which doesn't tend to work very well.\nWe're in desperate need of a way to help grow youth players in an academy set-up, and there are so many methods to make this happen without getting too complicated! Adding a U21 squad to every team along with a generic U21 league for them to compete in means players can develop in-house. There could also be an investment option where you can select how much you want to invest in your youth team's development.\nAlex Hunter 2.0: A new journey mode\nAlex Hunter's Journey game mode spread across three FIFA titles, with the fan-favourite mode being added in FIFA 16 before concluding in FIFA 19 (Hunter did make a brief cameo in FIFA 20 Volta, but he wasn't a playable character). The Journey game mode lost a lot of popularity towards the end and was rightly canned, but six years on, I'd love to see the game mode reimagined for EA FC 25 Career Mode.\nWith a new protagonist, new challenges, and a new storyline, I think an updated Journey game mode would go down a hit with the FC community. The journey peaked in FIFA 16, but it wasn't long enough. You could finish it in a few hours if you really wanted to, so I think if EA can make it longer this time around, it would be a big success.\nStats, stats, and more stats!\nThe stats currently available to view in EA FC 24 Career Mode are extremely limited, and it only scratches the tip of the iceberg with what sort of stats we could access. If you've managed a club for 10 years in Career Mode, I'd love for there to be a stats page where I could view career-long stats such as games played, trophies won, biggest wins and losses, top scorers, favourite opponent, bogey team, etc.\nIt would also be good to see the stats of other players and teams from different leagues. Right now, you are restricted to only seeing team stats of teams from your league and from that current season. It's not detailed enough, and this has to be improved for EA FC 25.\nNine subs\nThis will hopefully be rolled out across all game modes in EA FC 25, but nine substitute spots have been a thing for years now, so it baffles me that it's not the case in EA FC 25. You can't call yourself the most realistic football game while not having such a basic feature in EA FC 25.\nGet rid of unrealistic Objectives\nFor the love of god, can we please get rid of the unrealistic Objectives in Career Mode? The concept of the Objectives is fine. I think it's needed to add some risk and competitiveness to the game mode. But in EA FC 24, EA has taken the Objective difficulty to a new level, and it now seems extremely easy to get sacked after failing to meet just one or two impossible objectives, which is extremely unrealistic.\nI could lead Tottenham to Premier League, Champions League, and FA Cup glory, but if I haven't done it while buying five 18-year-olds from Moldova who play in 90% of those games, I could be sacked. Ok, maybe that's a bit dramatic, but you get the gist. The realism of the Objectives is out of touch, and this needs to be fixed for EA FC 25.",
