  "body_text": "How can Tottenham qualify for the Champions League?\nIt was a season that initially promised so much, but one that is set to conclude in misery and ambiguity at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nAfter Antonio Conte worked a minor miracle to help Tottenham into the Champions League last season, some projected the Italian's Lilywhites to potentially compete with Man City for the Premier League title following a busy summer.\nA productive start to the season ensued, but it didn't take long for Spurs' season to turn sour. The performances were often drab, but results kept the fans onside. However, there was nothing sustainable about Tottenham's productivity, and it was no surprise Conte eventually departed off the back of an explosive rant after his side collapsed to a 3-3 draw at St. Mary's in March.\nConte's assistant, Cristian Stellini, who has oddly been installed as interim boss until the end of the season, has hardly overseen a resurgence but Tottenham are just about still in the top-four race.\nStrategic drift has turned Spurs into a broken mess, and some might question whether Champions League football would actually be any good for them next season. They need a total reset.\nTottenham’s remaining Premier League fixtures\nSpurs may be just three points behind Newcastle at the time of writing, but things haven't been growing great for a number of weeks.\nConte is out of the door, a dramatic defeat to Bournemouth is in the history books and the fixture list is less than kind.\nNewcastle and Man Utd must be beaten in their next two games - their fiercest rivals in this battle - and even then Liverpool are waiting in the wings at the end of the month.\nFollow that with games against two of the division's most in-form sides, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa, and you understand further why it might be curtains. Sliding Brentford and struggling Leeds are slightly more comforting sights.\nWho are Tottenham competing with for Champions League qualification?\nMan Utd and Newcastle currently occupy the remaining top four spots and they're considered the favourites to qualify for next season's Champions League alongside Man City and Arsenal.\nHowever, threats are emerging from below. too. Unai Emery's Aston Villa are on the rise and have placed themselves ominously, while Brighton have played fewer games than their competitors and will be in a promising promising to secure an unbelievable Champions League berth should they win their games in hand.\nLiverpool cannot be written off just yet either, even if a top-four finish for the Reds looks unlikely.\nHow many points normally earns Champions League qualification?\nTottenham achieved Champions League qualification under Antonio Conte with 71 points, which is just a shade over the 69.66 point average (since the Premier League received four qualifying berths in 2001/02) required over the past 20 years to get the job done.\nTottenham are currently 16 points light of that average fixture, and their fixture list does not make for pretty reading. Tough times for Stellini and his players ahead, who potentially can only afford to drop five points before the end of the season.",
