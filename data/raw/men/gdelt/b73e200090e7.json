  "body_text": "Cristiano Ronaldo marked a milestone that few footballers reach while still playing at an elite level—his 40th birthday.\nBut for the Al-Nassr star, age is just a number, and the mission remains the same: to keep proving that limits are meant to be broken.\nPUNCH Online reports that the Portuguese star and Champions League Hall of Fame legend clocked 40 on Wednesday.\nSome legends at, above 40\nSeveral football legends have played beyond 40, defying age like Cristiano Ronaldo. Gianluigi Buffon retired at 45, while Paolo Maldini and Ryan Giggs thrived at 40.\nZlatan Ibrahimović scored for AC Milan at 41, and Pelé played until 42. Japan’s Kazuyoshi Miura, now in his 50s, remains active. These icons proved that elite football has no age limit, and Ronaldo is set to join them.\nCR7 as fondly called is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 900 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.\nRelentless Pursuit of Greatness\nRonaldo has never been short on confidence, and his latest declaration on Spanish TV on Monday only reinforced his self-belief.\n“I think I’m the most complete player to have existed,” he said.\n“One thing is taste—if you like Messi, Pele, Maradona, I understand that and I respect that—but saying Ronaldo isn’t complete? I haven’t seen anybody better than me, and I say it from the heart.”\nFrom a young player who once envisioned retiring at 30 to a footballing phenomenon who outscored himself in his 30s—460 goals compared to 440 in his 20s—Ronaldo has redefined longevity.\nBBC Sports on Wednesday reports that his former Portugal teammate Costinha recalls a very different ambition from the teenager who made his international debut in 2003.\n“He told me, ‘Costa, I’m going to play until the age of 30 and then I’ll do something different.’”\nTwo decades later, Ronaldo is still rewriting the script.\nWhat’s Next? The 40s Blueprint\nWhile many expected him to slow down, Ronaldo remains as ambitious as ever.\nHis targets include:\n- Playing in the 2026 World Cup—and winning it, a feat that would cement his international legacy.\n- Scoring 1,000 career goals—he currently stands at 923, and with his scoring rate, this once-unthinkable milestone is within reach.\n- Reaching 250 caps for Portugal—already the most-capped international player, he is on 217 and counting.\n- Sharing the pitch with Cristiano Ronaldo Jr.—his 14-year-old son is progressing through Al-Nassr’s youth system, making a dream father-son moment a real possibility.\nThe Final Goal of the 30s—A Fitting Send-off\nLate Tuesday night, Al-Nassr paid tribute to their talisman by sharing a clip of his last goal of his 30s—a soaring strike in a 4-0 victory over Al Wasl, where he bagged a brace.\nThe caption? “For the history books: the final goal of the 30s soared through Riyadh skies. #GOAT.”\nFor Ronaldo, the chase for history never stops. With former Al-Nassr coach Luis Castro convinced he can play “for another one, two, or even three years,” the footballing world is watching to see just how far the legend of CR7 will go.\nAs he steps into his 40s, one thing remains clear: Cristiano Ronaldo doesn’t just defy time—he bends it to his will, multiple media reports and fans have opined.\nPUNCH Online reports that Ronaldo’s first game in his 40s will be on Friday in the Saudi Pro League at home against 13th-place Al Feiha.\nAl Nassr currently sits third on the 18 teams table with 38 points alongside Al Qadisiyah with the same point on 4th.\nAl Hilal and Al Ittihad sit first and second with 46 points both.",
