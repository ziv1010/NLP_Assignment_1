  "body_text": "I’m not sure he said Eddie Howe should be sacked\nWe have asked a number of Newcastle United fans some questions following the conclusion of the internationals.\nThis of course follows the triumph at Wembley and in advance of the return to action in the Premier League.\nSo we have asked some regular and irregular contributors to The Mag, some trophy winning and also aspiring to the Champions League questions.\nOur thanks to all who have taken part.\nNext up with his answers is Wor Lass:\nThree words that come to mind now, having won that League Cup Final against Liverpool at Wembley?\nDon’t believe it!\nAnd I still don’t. I started saying it when we went two up, continued after the final whistle and woke up thinking it the next morning!\nThe bizarre John Barnes reaction to Newcastle United winning the League Cup Final, was to declare that if losing the final 10 Premier League matches, Eddie Howe should be sacked. What is your reaction to what Barnes said?\nI’m not sure he said Eddie Howe “should be sacked”. He was using Eddie Howe as an extreme example of what can happen in football and that owners can be ruthless. Where John Barnes is concerned I’m more concerned about the gambling habit he must have to dare to wear clothes like that in public.\nGun to the head, if only one of the two was to stay at Newcastle United this summer, would you keep Alexander Isak or Eddie Howe?\nNo contest – King Edward.\nIf Alex did go (and I don’t see it yet) then we’d get mega bucks for reinvestment. I also think it would completely splinter the fantastic team spirit Eddie has fostered. HE is the reason we’re doing so well.\nWhich five players, in order, were key to that win at Wembley?\nBDB – he got the first goal and had a towering game at the heart of the defence.\nJoey – an absolute beast in the middle\nIce Cold Alex – he gave us that cushion – necessary as it turned out – in inimical style.\nTrips – as good as he’s ever been, a leader and a calming influence.\nTino – I think Mo Salah’s still picking out pieces of Tino’s pocket lint from his ears.\nWhich player most surprised you with how well he played in that final?\nNo one totally surprised me but I’d give special mention to Jacob Murphy for the shift he put in. I was so pleased to see him with a medal around his neck.\nAlso, Bruno for the way he made sure to include Jamaal Lascelles in lifting the trophy and getting the crowd to show their appreciation of Anthony Gordon. He definitely needs to get someone to do his singing for him, though.\nPredict the results for the final 10 NUFC matches, what you think will happen:\nWednesday 2 April – Newcastle v Brentford WIN\nMonday 7 April – Leicester v Newcastle WIN\nSunday 13 April – Newcastle v Man U WIN\nWednesday 16 April – Newcastle v Palace WIN\nSaturday 19 April – Villa v Newcastle WIN\nSaturday 26 April – Newcastle v Ipswich WIN\nSunday 4 May – Brighton v Newcastle DRAW\nSaturday 10 May – Newcastle v Chelsea (TBC) WIN\nSunday 18 May – Arsenal v Newcastle (TBC) LOSE\nSunday 25 May – Newcastle v Everton WIN\n(ED: So that makes it eight wins, one draw and no defeats in the final 10 matches, which would see Newcastle United end the season on 72 points)\nA bit gung-ho, maybe, but I think we’ll win all of our home games and do Villa away. Brighton and Arsenal are much trickier fixtures. We could win them but I think I’ve pushed my luck far enough.\nIn what order do you think the top half of the Premier League table will be?\nLiverpool\nArsenal\nForest\nNewcastle United\nMan City\nChelsea\nBrighton\nVilla\nBournemouth\nFulham\nDo you think winning the Carabao Cup will now help or hinder Newcastle’s chances of top five and a Champions League place?\nDefinitely “help”.\nThe boys have learnt how to win, got a trophy monkey off their back and defeated their modern day nemesis. That’s bound to have given everyone a massive lift.\nWho are the eight current Newcastle United players, in order, who Newcastle United most need to keep for next season?\nAlex, Bruno, Tonali, Joey, Flash, Tino, Hall, Botman.\nI’ve put Sven last just because he hasn’t shown that he’s completely over his cruciate problems. One or two of them could be swapped around but getting replacements for any of them would be difficult. There are obviously plenty of others I would want to keep as well but they are the top quality assets that we have.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
