  "body_text": "Arsenal transfer target Nico Williams has dropped a hint on his future ahead of Athletic Bilbao’s Europa League semi-final against Manchester United.\nThe Gunners have been long-time admirers of Williams and failed with a move to sign the 22-year-old following Spain’s success at Euro 2024 last summer.\nBarcelona have also been credited with a strong interest in the talented winger, who has a €58 million (£48.4m) release clause in his current deal.\nDespite injury problems earlier in the campaign, Williams has still managed to notch up 11 goals and seven assists in all competitions this season.\nAnd the Spain international has particularly impressed in the Europa League, with his goal last Thursday night securing Athletic’s 2-0 aggregate win over Rangers and a place in the final four.\nHis side now face United in the semi-final, knowing a win would afford them the opportunity to play in the final at their home stadium in Bilbao.\nAnd while Williams is not overlooking the challenge presented by Ruben Amorim’s side, the forward admitted he has his eyes set on winning the Europa League and playing for his hometown club in the Champions League next season.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘Every kid wants to play at Old Trafford. We have the goal of winning the Europa League and, next year, to crush the Champions League. Little by little,’ Williams told Spanish publication AS.\n‘I think our motto of going ‘on the down low’ is the best. We’re doing very well, and we need to continue like this to reach the final to continue this streak to help the team. The team is extraordinary.\n‘We’re going to celebrate this victory. San Mamés deserves it more than anyone. We’re doing very well to reach the semifinal we want. One more step before the final, and hopefully we can get there.’\nWhile Williams may harbour ambitions of playing in the Champions League with Athletic, the release clause in his deal may take the decision out of his hands in the summer.\nAnd with Barcelona reportedly now not interested in a move for Williams this summer, Arsenal could well be the front-runners for the Spaniard’s signature.\nAndrea Berta, the Gunners’ new sporting director, is said to have already met the wingers’ representatives to discuss a deal, but the north London will not get a free run at the 22-year-old, with Chelsea and Bayern Munich also still considering a move.\nMore Trending\nA winger is one of three key positions that Arsenal are keen to upgrade upon this summer, with a striker and another central midfielder also top of their wishlist.\nSpeaking earlier this week, Arteta insisted that Arsenal should be confident of convincing any player to join them in the summer.\n‘I think we are very lucky because we are a football club that every time we have spoken to players, they want to be part of it,’ he said.\n‘That is probably something that can generate more enthusiasm or belief, and the fact that I want to be part of these nights now because the club is in a good place. Overall, we are ready, we are strong and we can attract any player.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: ‘Arsenal and Liverpool couldn’t win here!’ – Pep Guardiola hails Everton victory\nMORE: Viktor Gyokeres sends transfer message to Arsenal ahead of summer window\nMORE: Carlo Ancelotti reveals what hurt him most about Arsenal defeat in Champions League",
