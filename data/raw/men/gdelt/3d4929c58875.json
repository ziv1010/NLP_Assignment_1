  "body_text": "The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup kicks off on June 14th, and 32 teams will embark on a quest to lift the Club World Cup trophy in the first edition of an expanded format. With the match being hosted in the United States, the team payouts are higher and the stakes are higher for the teams involved as they hope to prove they are the best club in the world.\n2025 FIFA Club World Cup: Group A Preview\nMessi and friends take on a tough group.\nGroup A figures to be one of the most watched groups, as Lionel Messi and Inter Miami compete against Palmeiras, Porto, and Al Ahly. We take a look at the teams in this group and who could emerge as the favorites to move through to the knockout stage.\nPalmeiras\nLeague: Brasileiro Serie A (Brazil)\nHow they qualified: 2021 Copa Libertadores winners\nTop Players\nThe world may know Estêvão’s name by the end of this tournament. The 18-year-old striker - who is off to Chelsea after the tournament ends - leads Palmeiras this season with 11 goals. Facundo Torres is a veteran that can affect a match quickly with his production.\nTeam Synopsis\nPalmeiras is not going to be scared of any team in their group. They currently lead the Brasileiro and are through to the Copa Libertadores knockout stage with a perfect group stage record. They have a lot of talent that can open up a match and make it entertaining while still scoring goals...and so far this year, they’ve scored 57 goals across all competitions. Where they have questions will be on defense. With an open style of attack, that will expose them to counterattacks and teams taking the ball and going the other way. But this is arguably the best team in the group.\nPorto\nLeague: Primeira Liga (Portugal)\nHow they qualified: 5th best UEFA team in 4-year ranking\nTop Players\nSpanish striker Samu Aghehowa led Porto with 25 goals this season across all competitions, including 6 in Europa League to help Porto to the knockout stage. Portuguese midfielder Rodrigo Mora broke out this season at only 18 years of age, contributing 10 goals and 4 assists. He could be set up for a major tournament, and Porto will need both players to do well.\nTeam Synopsis\nPorto is always a solid team in continental play, but on the international level they may need to elevate their production. They finished third in the league this season, and they know that to compete in the Club World Cup, they will have to pull off inspired performances similar to the ones that brought them a UEFA Champions League title in 2004 and the 2011 Europa League title.\nAl Ahly\nLeague: Egyptian Premier League (Egypt)\nHow they qualified: 2021 CAF Champions League winners\nTop Player\nEmam Ashour led Al Ahly in goals this season, helping his club to the Egyptian Premier League title and Egyptian Super Cup title. They’re hoping he can help the club send some shockwaves and impress in the Club World Cup group stage.\nTeam Synopsis\nAl Ahly hopes to show that North African soccer is as good as it gets. People have likely heard of the club from previous editions of the Club World Cup, but they want to put some good performances behind their name in this expanded tournament. The question will be whether their roster is ready for prime time, and if they will be able to counter the physicality that some of these teams could present.\nInter Miami\nLeague: Major League Soccer (USA)\nHow they qualified: 2024 Supporters’ Shield winners (awarded the host nation spot)\nTop Players\nLionel Messi is the engine of the team and the most recognizable player in this tournament. He leads the team with 13 goals and 3 assists so far this season across all competitions. His teammate Luis Suárez has added 7 goals and 9 assists and has created a terrific 1-2 punch. They will be counted on to produce for Miami before their home fan.\nTeam Synopsis\nInter Miami is the team being fronted as the team from MLS to watch in this tournament, mainly because of the allure of Messi, Suárez, and guys like Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba who are household names worldwide. However, Miami will have some issues on defense as teams try to push numbers forward, and the test will be if some of their younger players can rise to the occasion.\nGroup Predictions\nA lot of the attention will be focused on Lionel Messi and Inter Miami, but they are going to struggle in this group stage. Al Ahly could be a dark horse candidate to pull off an upset. However, the class of the group should be Palmeiras and Porto, who both have the star power to produce a lot of goals and make it through to the knockout stage.",
