No club from Greece has ever lifted a major European trophy before, with Panathinaikos way back in 1971 the only other side to even reach a final.\nAlthough possession was fairly even throughout, most of the chances fell to a wasteful Fiorentina.\nOlympiacos threatened first when Daniel Podence, on loan from Wolves, forced Pietro Terracciano to save inside the opening four minutes – the Fiorentina goalkeeper later denied the same player from a near-post header later in the first half. La Viola then had the ball in the net with only nine minutes on the clock, but VAR intervened and ruled Nikola Milenkovic offside.\nGiacomo Bonaventura, frustrated at being left out of Italy’s Euro 2024 squad, didn’t do himself any justice when a tame effort with the whole goal to aim at went straight at Olympiacos stopper Konstantinos Tzolakis, who was also sharp off his line to deny Andrea Belotti a moment later.\nFiorentina continued to press but routinely missed the target, with little change in the pattern of play into the second half. They should have been made to pay for their profligacy with only ten minutes left when a glancing header from Vicente Iborra was inches from putting Olympiacos ahead.\nVeteran Olympiacos substitute Stevan Jovetic went close in extra-time against the club where he made his name more than a decade ago. Tired legs threatened to open things up, but as penalties neared it didn’t bode well for Fiorentina given their woeful record from the spot this season.\nThey needn’t have worried because it didn’t get that far. As he so often has been for Olympiacos, El Kaabi was there when it mattered and, after five goals over two legs in the semi-final, threw himself at Santiago Hezze’s bouncing near-post cross to head beyond Terracciano. There was a lengthy VAR check for a possible offside, but confirmation of the goal was greeted by roars from the Olympiacos players, bench and local Athenian crowd, as it was again moments later at the final whistle.",
