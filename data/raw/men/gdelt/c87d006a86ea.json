But we are working to plan the strategy for summer and pre-season, then to start (next) season in the best condition.\n\"The way we are finishing the season, I am happy. To finish in this way gives us the hope to start strong next season, with the capacity from the beginning of the season to have the possibility to fight for big things.\"\nSince being hammered 5-0 by Arsenal on April 23, Chelsea have recovered to find their best form of Pochettino's tenure, fighting back to draw 2-2 with Champions League-bound Aston Villa four days later before embarking on their winning run.\n© 2024 AFP",
