United showed their determination in reaching the final this season after their display in Spain last week.\nUnited 4-3 defeat to Brentford in the Premier League on Sunday shows that United can still score the goals and has kept them in the same form they were in last week, which bodes well for the club at this time. Ruben Amorim will want this team to achieve this season, which will be a morale booster for next season after this abject season.\nPredicted Manchester United Starting XI – 3-4-2-1\nOnana;\nShaw, Maguire, Yoro;\nMazraoui, Ugarte, Casemiro, Dorgu;\nFernandes, Garnacho;\nHojlund\nGoalkeeper: Onana\nAndre Onana looks set to return in goal considering the number of goals that Altay Bayindir conceded against Brentford on Sunday. The Cameroonian has had a better season but has conceded a high number of goals in his two seasons at the Old Trafford club. There will need to be changes in the summer, that is for sure.\nOnana is an experienced goalkeeper but his time at United has been marred with mistakes and a high number of conceded goals. It is not the United way. In terms of being better than David De Gea – he is nothing up there yet and might never be – which is realistic. However, I trust Onana to achieve for United this season.\nBayindir will most likely be on the bench against Bilbao and that is where he should perhaps stay. This is an important matche for United and they cannot afford to concede even a single goal, which could change the game for the Spanish club. United need to ensure they win this tie, reach the final and work out how to win it.\nDefenders: Shaw, Maguire, Yoro\nThe United defence is likely to be an area that struggles once again due to injuries with Matthijs de Ligt likely to be considered a doubt for this tie after he came off against Brentford on Sunday with a knee injury. If he does not start, United will need to make some changes with the depth of the defence not as strong as it could be.\nLuke Shaw could start on the right of the back three, as he did a week ago in Spain. His experience shows that he can play a centre role, instead of the left back position he has played throughout his career. In the centre of the defence, Harry Maguire should also start as he is a danger in front of goal too, which is what United need.\nLeny Yoro should be starting on the left of the back three as he has risen in stature since signing for United last summer and he looks like a player that United really needed – which is a great thing. United will have a number of options on the bench as defensive changes will be required for United to grind out this win they badly need.\nMidfield: Mazraoui, Ugarte, Casemiro, Dorgu\nUnited’s midfield will need to be strong to deal with the attacking threat of Bilbao. 3-0 is not a big enough lead to settle this tie as United have conceded many goals this season, even from 2-0 up so it is entirely possible that Bilbao come to Old Trafford seeking a victory. However, United have the stature to grind out the win.\nNoussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu should be starting in the wide wing back roles on Thursday evening, which should show United much stronger on the defence, which is where they need to be wary of that Athletic Club can do. There will be some options on the bench but it will either be players playing out of position or talented youth.\nIn the centre of the midfield, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro should be starting as they both did well last week, even if Ugarte did not have the strongest of starts – he found his feet and got stuck into the tie. Casemiro scored the opener with a great finish and rolled back the clock on his career, looking hungry to win another trophy.\nAttack: Fernandes, Hojlund, Garnacho\nUnited’s attacking line will need to be up to spec against Bilbao on Thursday evening at Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes’ leadership and ability to find a goal or two will be required. The support of the likes of Alejandro Garnacho will be needed too with Rasmus Hojlund leading the line for the club.\nUnited have not had a great season in terms of scoring goals. That said, Fernandes has 35 goal contributions this season (19 goals and 16 assists) with Garnacho on 20 goal contributions (10 goals and 10 assists). Hojlund has just 11 goal contributions (nine goals and two assists). It is still a good rate of goals but it should be so much better.\nThis trio should be more than capable of getting this tie to bed with United needing one other two goals to back up the three they have already scored in Spain. United will need to up the ante as they did in the early stages of the first leg and push for the victory, giving them time to rest key players ahead of the final of the competition.\nSubstitutes: Bayindir; Lindelof, De Ligt, Amass, Fredricson, Kamason; Mount, Eriksen, Mainoo, Scanlon, Mantato; Amad\nUnited can name up to 12 players on the bench in the UEFA Europa League which will give United a number of options from the bench in order to retain their lead over Bilbao. Amorim could place Altay Bayindir on the bench, opting to add youth outfield players on the bench instead of two goalkeepers.\nIn defence, United could have the likes of Victor Lindelof, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Amass, Tyler Fredricson and Jaydan Kamason on the bench with changes needed in this match for United to ensure they reach the final of the UEFA Europa League this season. I am sure United will be confident of this feat with it effectively in the bag.\nIn the midfield, Mason Mount, Christian Eriksen, Kobbie Mainoo, James Scalon and Bendito Mantato could all be part of the squad for this Old Trafford clash. In attack, United have few options at this stage of the season so could just have Amad on the bench, which is a great option for United to have at this stage of the season.\nWritten by Paul\nDiscover more from Daily Man Utd News\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.",
