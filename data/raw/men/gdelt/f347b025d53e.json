  "body_text": "Mikel Arteta said he was delighted with the team's \"determination, quality and aggression\" in our victory over Sevilla on Wednesday.\nWe took a big step towards qualification to the knockout stages with a 2-0 win at Emirates Stadium, a game in which we restricted the visitors to just one shot - in the final minute of injury time.\n\"I'm really pleased with the performance, and the determination, quality, aggression that we showed today, it was really pleasing to watch,\" he said afterwards. \"It was a really convincing win, generating a lot and not conceding anything. It was a big step for us.\n\"It’s two games; against Newcastle we conceded one shot and today as well, so that gives a lot of strong foundations to the team. I think attacking-wise, we were a real threat, our wingers were a real threat today, so I’m really happy.\"\nThe win extends our lead at the top of the group, and means we will definitely progress as group winners, should we beat Lens at home on matchday five.\n\"It’s something that we have to earn,\" the manager said, \"and it’s still for us to do. I will prepare for that game because it will be a huge step.\"\nMikel also gave an update on injuries to Takehiro Tomiyasu and Bukayo Saka, who were both withdrawn. \"Tomi had to leave the pitch because he was feeling some discomfort, and we didn’t want to take any risks. And Bukayo as well, obviously he got kicked a few times and with the last one, he was unhappy to continue.\n\"I’m sure we’ll have 11 players here that we’ll put out against Burnley to do our best to beat them.\"\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
