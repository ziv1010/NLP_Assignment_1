  "body_text": "World Cup winner Laia Codina is officially a Gunner.\nIn her first interview since signing with our club, Spain international Codina shares her trophy ambitions, style of play, and how excited she is to get going.\nHere is everything she had to say:\nLaia, welcome to The Arsenal! How does it feel to finally be a Gunner?\nI’m really excited. I can’t wait to start with the team and to be a Gunner.\nThere have been rumours of this move happening for a little while now, but when did you first find out that Arsenal were interested?\nIt was before the World Cup. When they called me, I knew about this club, about the history of the club and I didn’t think if yes or no, I decided yes because I think it’s the best option to grow up and become a good football player.\nWhat is it about the current project here at Arsenal that convinced you to join?\nI think that Arsenal is a team that is growing up a lot and now we have the Champions League I think we can do a lot of good things during the season. We have four competitions to compete for titles and I think we can and have to win one of them.\nTell us a little bit more about you as a player. What do you think you can bring to this side?\nI don’t know. It’s true that I came from Barcelona, typically it’s about having the ball and I think I’m very aggressive in playing the game and I think this is also necessary in the Women’s Super League.\nWhat has Jonas and the club said to you about the way they can see you fitting in?\nI have talked with Jonas and he told me what he knows about me and I think we can understand each other a lotand he can help me a lot.\nHow excited are you to meet your teammates and get to work?\nI can’t wait. I met some of them today during the day. I met Lia Walti, I met Gio and I think that it will be a good season.\nYou’ve just enjoyed the most incredible summer, winning the World Cup with Spain! What was that like to experience?\nIt was incredible, I can’t believe what happened, but it was amazing and I think we did a good job. I was lucky because I can play, so it’s better, no? I enjoyed it a lot but now I’m focused with Arsenal.\nDo you think being involved in a big moment like that can help you take your game to the next level?\nYeah, I think so. I think that’s going to help me because I played a final so the atmosphere that I lived is going to help me when we are going to play here in Emirates Stadium, and I think it has been a good experience.\nAre you looking forward to your first time playing here?\nYeah, I can’t wait. I think it’s an amazing stadium and I hope that the first game against Liverpool will be busy.\nDuring your time at Barcelona you’ve been part of a team that’s pretty much won everything there is to win… what are some of those things that you’ve taken from being there?\nI think that the pressure to win every day, to be competitive every training and I think that this is a good thing, the pressure to win every game and to do it better every day.\nJust finally, what’s your message to our supporters who are going to be thrilled to see you pull on that Arsenal shirt for the first time?\nI can’t wait to see them, I can’t wait to make moments with them and to fight for a lot of victories, I hope.\nTo hear more from our latest signing, click play on the video above.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
