  "body_text": "Ex-England defender Micah Richards says three Premier League teams are simply ‘better’ than Chelsea and challenging for the top four is a ‘realistic target’ for Liam Rosenior.\nRosenior was appointed as Chelsea’s new head coach last week after Enzo Maresca decided to call time on his tenure after 18 months at the helm at Stamford Bridge.\nThe 41-year-old, formerly the manager of BlueCo-owned Strasbourg, watched on from the stands as Chelsea slumped to a 2-1 loss at Fulham, with Calum McFarlane remaining in charge at Craven Cottage.\nBut Rosenior was in the dugout for the first time at the weekend and the Englishman reign got his reign off to an encouraging start as the Blues ran out 5-1 victors at Charlton to reach the fourth round of the FA Cup.\nThere is little time for sentiment or celebration, though, with Rosenior’s men facing Arsenal in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday night, before entertaining Brentford in the Premier League just three days later.\nThough Maresca departed with Chelsea sat in fifth, defeat at Fulham means the west London giants are now languishing down in eighth place – four points off fourth-placed Liverpool.\nDiscussing expectations and targets for Rosenior on The Rest Is Football podcast, Richards said: ‘The only worry is what Chelsea want from him and if they’re happy just being top four and challenging for the Europa League, Champions League or whatever, maybe winning the Europa League if they don’t get into the Champions League.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

If their plan is to get top four and challenge for a trophy, I think he’ll do really well.\nRichards added: ‘They’re not better than Manchester City, they’re not better than Liverpool and they’re not better than Arsenal.\n‘Aston Villa are creeping up there as well so a realistic target is to challenge for top four.\n‘I hope he does really well and I think he will, as long as it’s a realistic plan.’\nLike Richards, Gary Lineker – the host of the podcast – hopes to see Rosenior succeed in the hot seat at Stamford Bridge, where so many top managers have come and gone in recent years.\nHowever, the former England striker is concerned about possible ‘interference’ around Rosenior, which is reportedly what paved the way for Maresca’s departure on New Year’s Day.\n‘They’re a young side and only going to get better in time, if you’re given time,’ Lineker said.\n‘He’s got a long contract so they obviously think good things about him.\n‘My worry for him is the points that Enzo Maresca made in terms of interference in terms of selections and who to bring on and that sort of stuff.\n‘If you’re getting that from above, that is very, very difficult.’\nMore Trending\nAlan Shearer, the Premier League’s all-time goalscorer, is delighted to see a young English manager given an opportunity at a club of the size and stature of Chelsea.\n‘It doesn’t matter how long his contract is because if they want to get rid of him, they’ll just get rid of him I guess,’ the ex-Newcastle and England forward chimed in.\n‘But I think we all know what Chelsea demand, with what they’ve spent.\n‘I hope he can do really well because it’s great for young English coaches, that he’s been given a chance at a club like that.’\nWill Chelsea finish in the top four this season?\n-\nYes\n-\nNo\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: ‘That’s a problem’ – Man Utd told they made big transfer mistake\nMORE: Arsenal legend hits back at claims Mikel Arteta made £67.5m transfer mistake\nMORE: Manchester United rule out club legend after being blown away by manager talks",
