  "body_text": "Simone Inzaghi did not want to make it about himself. Winning in Lisbon, he insisted, personally meant “nothing”. There were no index fingers raised to his lips, no demands for “respect, RESPECT!”, no ears cupped to a critical crowd. In this regard, Inzaghi differs from the last Inter coach to lead the club to a Champions League semi-final, Jose Mourinho. “My upbringing wouldn’t allow it,” the 47-year-old said in his baritone drawl.\nAdvertisement\nNo coach in Italy cops as much flak as Inzaghi. He gets mocked for his “spiaze”, a perceived overly apologetic streak, whenever Inter drop points. His substitutions keep Elon Musk in a job at Twitter, generating a disproportionate amount of traffic. His endorsement of signing Joaquin Correa from former club Lazio for €30million (£26.4m; $32.7m) is hard to swallow. Visits by Inter’s executive team to the club’s bucolic training ground in Appiano Gentile are presented as if they are dropping by to give “Simo” a clip round the ear after defeats in the Derby della Madonnina and other tough losses against Spezia and Fiorentina.\nIt is hard not to feel a little sympathy. Maybe only Gigi Simoni, who was informed of the sack by Inter as he received the Panchina d’Oro, Italy’s coach of the year award, in 1998 got more.\nSome fans of the Nerazzurri will no doubt roll their eyes. The football this year has not been as good as it was last season when Inzaghi, particularly over the autumn, managed to get Inter to kick on and play a more attractive style than under Antonio Conte. Ten defeats in 28 league games is the poorest run since the turbulent 2016-17 campaign when Inter changed coach three times, binning Frank de Boer (“the worst manager in the history of the Premier League,” per Mourinho), as well as a future champion of Italy, Stefano Pioli, and the other “Ste”, Stefano Vecchi, who gets a shoutout for leading Feralpisalo to Serie B for the first time this week.\nThe same owners, Suning, were already in situ back then, better able to throw money at a perceived problem than they are now. But Inter are no longer in that position. The days when they fired Luciano Spalletti at a cost of €25.8million shortly after giving him a new contract are over. Nevertheless, Inzaghi has appeared continuously on the brink, irrespective of chief executive Beppe Marotta saying: “He absolutely isn’t in the dock.” Gazzetta dello Sport keep insisting he only has so many games to save his job and yet Inzaghi keeps nudging it back another game, then another and another.\nAdvertisement\nThrough it all, he has ploughed on, occasionally venting, like the time he acknowledged how great it was Inter won the league under Conte, only that the success came at a price and provoked financial problems Inzaghi has to reckon with: a club up for sale, eight players out of contract, loan players like Romelu Lukaku preparing to be returned to sender, a sense of drift.\nNone of this should be far away when judging Inzaghi. Sure, Inter should not be shipping 25 goals on the road in Serie A, the 15th-worst record in the league. Of course, it is worrying, considering the financial state of the club, that they have dropped outside the top four. Being winless in six games does exactly not inspire confidence either when you are heading to Benfica for a Champions League quarter-final. “There has always been criticism in football and always will be,” Inzaghi scoffed. “It’s normal.”\nGO DEEPER\nJose Mourinho exclusive: Inter’s treble-winning season 10 years on\nInzaghi could have gone full Graham Potter and highlighted the expected goals (xG) in seeking to put a gloss on a bad run. Instead, he limited himself to saying: “The people writing and talking are influenced by results.” They look at the score of a game like Inter-Spezia (a 2-1 loss), rather than the xG (3.8 vs 1.0) or the shot count (30 vs two). They forget Lukaku’s header against the bar in Salerno was the 14th time Inter have hit the woodwork this season.\nThey neglected to mention what happened in Monza when Pablo Mari tripped over his own player and the referee mistakenly called a foul on Roberto Gagliardini just as Francesco Acerbi scored what would have been the winning goal. It is true that Inter’s performances have generally been below par this season, but they have still been good enough to get better results than they have had, too.\nTuesday night at the Estadio da Luz was overdue, a ketchup game when a sudden splurge follows a prolonged shaking and patting of the bottle.\nAdvertisement\nOK, Benfica were without three-quarters of their first-choice defence and Porto had knocked their confidence on Friday, but it still takes nothing away from Inter’s display. They have yet to concede in the knockout stages and defused Benfica’s narrow press with repeated switches of the play while getting centre-back Alessandro Bastoni to step out from the back, as he did to cross for Nicolo Barella’s opening goal. The pair of them have underwhelmed this season but know how to connect when it matters as they have done against Juventus and Barcelona.\nWhat a beauty of a cross to find Barella! 🤩\nInter take the lead against Benfica with their first shot on target! 🔥#UCL pic.twitter.com/85WPs1K5wv\n— Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 11, 2023\nLukaku then dispatched another penalty (that is now two goals in three knockout-stage games) and while he could undoubtedly use a goal from open play in the league (the Belgian’s last one was in August), he has at least made himself useful from the spot. Lautaro Martinez, meanwhile, has gone seven games without scoring. As for Edin Dzeko, he has not found the net in the league since Inter beat Napoli in the first game back after the World Cup.\nAll three of them have not exactly lacked chances. All three have seen Inzaghi take the wrap for their mistakes. “I said it last night,” Bastoni said. “We didn’t get what we deserved in the last three games. We were composed this evening. I was convinced we could put in a performance like this and I’m proud of every one of us.”\nPerhaps Inter should have a little more faith in Inzaghi. He seems a kindred spirit of Carlo Ancelotti’s in that he prefers la Coppa. Maybe he will develop a taste for the league later in his career, as Ancelotti has done, although losing the Scudetto to AC Milan on the final day of last season definitely hurt Inzaghi. It has meant he has had to keep falling back on his reputation as a cup specialist.\n“Watch the games and leave the results to one side,” Inzaghi said in Lisbon. For the first time in what felt like long time, performance and result went hand-in-hand.\n(Top photo: Patricia de Melo Moreira/AFP via Getty Images)",
