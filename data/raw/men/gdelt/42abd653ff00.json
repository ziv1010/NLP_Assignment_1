Although they could use the money they recuperate from the transfer to sign other attacking options.\nCarlos Soler\nValencia youth academy product Carlos Soler joined PSG in the summer of 2022 for a fee of around €18m and signed a five-year deal.\nSoler is a versatile player in the sense that he can play almost anywhere across the midfield or attack and has helped to plug gaps when needed.\nThis campaign he has been in the starting 11 just 30 per cent of the time and has played less than a third of the total league minutes for the Parisians.\nThis drop in playtime could signify an early exit from France as PSG look to raise funds following the announcement of Mbappe’s departure.\nPresnel Kimpembe\nFrench international Presnel Kimpembe has spent his entire senior career at PSG, racking up over 230 appearances in all competitions for the club since making his debut in 2014.\nThis season, however, Kimpembe has yet to make a league appearance for the club due to rupturing his Achilles tendon in February 2023, meaning he’s approaching a year in the treatment room.\nPSG did renew his contract in December 2023 – valud until the summer of 2026 – so a permanent move away this summer seems unlikely.\nHowever, they could be tempted into loaning the 28-year-old out once he returns to full fitness to gain some more match sharpness.\nDON’T MISS ~ How much Kylian Mbappe will earn at Real Madrid compared to his new teammates\nFabian Ruiz\nSpanish midfielder Fabian Ruiz has been in the PSG starting 11 less than 50 per cent of the time this campaign, with competition in the midfield high.\nWhilst at Napoli, Fabian was one of the most coveted midfielders in Europe, so when PSG signed him in August 2022 for €23m (£19.6m) – a price well below his market value – it was seen as a real coup.\nSince moving to France, Fabian has made 61 total appearances for PSG, though a large portion of those were from the bench.\nWith PSG needing to sell to comply with Financial Fair Play regulations, Fabian could be one of the saleable assets the club would be willing to let go of.\nLayvin Kurzawa\nFrench left-back Layvin Kurzawa has been a part of the PSG squad since 2015, and is one of the longest-serving members of the current squad.\nThough the former French international has barely appeared for the Parisians since 2020/21, making just one league appearance in the last two years.\nThree appearances on loan at Fulham last season did little to help reinvigorate his career, and he’s not featured in a matchday squad since early December.\nWith his current contract set to expire at the end of this season, it would be a surprise if he was a PSG player next campaign.\nSergio Rico\nSpanish goalkeeper Sergio Rico joined PSG on loan in 2019 and then permanently in 2020.\nSince he arrived in France from Sevilla, Rico has served as a deputy, making only 13 league appearances in his five years at the club.\nWith his contract up this summer, and Rico now 30 years old, he could well leave the capital in search of some more regular first-team football as he approaches his latter years.\nColin Dagba\nFrench right-back Colin Dagba joined PSG in 2016 and came through the club’s academy before making his first-team debut in August 2018.\nDagba has never really nailed down a place in the PSG starting lineup and with the arrival of Achraf Hakimi he was always going to struggle to play a major part in the club’s future.\nA loan to Strasbourg last campaign didn’t do much to help the Frenchman. With him now on loan at Ligue 2 side Auxerre and not a guaranteed starter in their side, his time at PSG is limited bar a huge turnaround.\nREAD MORE ~ Kylian Mbappe and five other transfers already agreed for summer 2024",
