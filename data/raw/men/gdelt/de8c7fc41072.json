A Barcelona Champions League and Clasico post-mortem\nWhere did it all go wrong for the Blaugrana?\nFor culers around the world, it’ll take until the dawn of a new season to fully recover from the trophyless disappointment of this one.\nIn the span of a week, Barcelona’s new found hope and optimism were shattered.\nA surprise run to the Champions League quarter-finals. Heading into the second leg with a one-goal lead that grew to two within the opening minutes at the Estadi Olímpic.\nAn unbeaten run in La Liga, dating back to January 27th, the day that Xavi announced he would step down as manager at the end of the season after a shocking 5-3 defeat at the hands of Villareal.\nThings weren’t just looking up, Barca fans were dreaming of the impossible.\nIn the blink of an eye, it all came crashing down.\nWhat if Ronald Araujo just let Bradley Barcola through?\nWould Barcelona have made it through to semi-finals?\nWould they have had the confidence and backbone to see out the victory against Real Madrid, keeping their hopes alive in the domestic title race?\nIn my mind, it seems very possible, if not likely.\nMomentum matters. The Champions League will make a hero out of you, or give you the harshest reality check before you have the chance to process the reversal of fortune.\nBut Barcelona, as a club, seems to have these moments of existential contemplation more often than they would like. The fact that you have to even ask these questions should be a sign that something is amiss in their way of going about the business of the game.\nReal Madrid, and I’m not going to mince words here, is more than happy to play ugly. And that’s exactly what they are. They don’t play for the love of the game.\nManchester City gave us poetry for 90 minutes, but they weren’t rewarded for it. True art, so often, manifests as tragedy.\nInstead, Real Madrid won the penalty kick lottery.\nBarcelona lost the lottery of what color card comes out of the referees pocket.\nAnd then, later in the week, when the two teams met head to head, as it was for the second time in one La Liga season, Barcelona squandered a lead, and gifted their historic rivals the Spanish championship.\nBut that’s also where the question of luck or merit starts to shift.\nI wouldn’t go so far as to say Real Madrid are the protagonists of the story. They really aren’t the good guys. They’re simply the perfect heel.\nThey sit back, antagonize, get in your head, and wait for you to self-destruct.\nThat’s exactly what Barcelona did, not once, but twice domestically.\nFor Manchester City, it wasn’t quite so dramatic, but they did beat themselves by allowing the match to go the distance, instead of going for the knockout when they had the chance.\nSo who’s to blame in all of this, and could Barcelona have done anything differently to affect the outcome?\nXavi, for his part, hadn’t put a foot wrong for months.\nHis high-profile decision to publicly announce his departure seems genius in hindsight. He said he was doing it for the love and benefit of the club, and that’s exactly how it played out.\nBarcelona could have been out of the Champions League in the round of 16, and the league campaign could have been over much sooner, given the path they were on at the start of the year.\nInstead, they recovered their confidence, and got out of their heads. The manager was a liberated man, and his players, in spite of continued injuries to key teammates, hit the field with a nothing to lose mindset as well.\nAnd the results kept coming.\nRonald Araujo’s red card, however, exposed yet again, some uncomfortable truths.\nWhen faced with adversity, Barcelona doesn’t respond well.\nXavi’s decisions in the match can be fairly scrutinized. They still had a two-goal lead, and by the end of the match, within 60 minutes, they surrendered four goals.\nOnce again, against Real Madrid, when the pressure was on, they let their advantage slip away.\nIt was a nightmare of a week for Joao Cancelo, and the defensive line in general.\nBut we also know that individual mistakes don’t exist in a vacuum.\nPSG came out of the gates on the front foot. Araujo’s red card came after a bad give away.\nReal Madrid had everything to play for, and in the end, Barcelona couldn’t muster enough desire to suffer for the result. They gave up the lead not once, but twice.\nAnd yet, in the totality of his tenure as manager, Xavi seems to be gradually shifting the self-image.\nYes, there have been steps back, but perhaps there have been more steps forward.\nHe didn’t win a La Liga title by accident. In the wake of two truly disastrous years where the team looked competitively paralyzed, he woke them up from the coma, and got the fire back in their belly.\nSurely, no one is more frustrated than Xavi in the outcome of this season.\nIt’s true that some of the same old ghosts returned. But we’ve also seen the clouds part and the light shining through in Barcelona again.\nGoing forward, the club will have to shake off the self-fulfilling prophecy of always being doomed to bad luck.\nPlaying beautiful, dominating football, is what’s brought them success in the past.\nAnd in the future, quality on the field will be the path forward as well.\nFortunately, La Masia continues to bear fruit.\nLet those wounds heal. Next season, and beyond, Barcelona will be back and ready to compete for everything.",
