And every day he has trained more and more since Monday. Everything is fine, he is going to play,\" coach Thomas Tuchel told a pre-match press conference on Friday.\nThe England captain, who has scored 37 goals in all competitions for Bayern already this season, hurt his ankle two weeks ago while in Bundesliga action.\nFrench international winger Coman, 27, returns as a substitute for the 'Klassiker' after a two-month injury layoff with left knee ligament damage.\n\"Kingsley is an important factor for us. He returns to the group,\" Tuchel said.\nCaptain and goalkeeper Neuer, 38, is recovering from an adductor muscle tear he suffered while on international duty with Germany.\nFor the first time since the spring of 2010, Bayern and Borussia Dortmund face each other without one of the two German football giants occupying top spot in the Bundesliga.\nBayern look set to lose their league title to Bayer Leverkusen, who are 10 points ahead at the top, while Dortmund are fourth, fighting to qualify for next season's Champions League.\n© 2024 AFP",
