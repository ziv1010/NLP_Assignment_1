For a player it is an honour”.\nThe 27-year-old attacker joined Barcelona this past summer, on a season-long loan deal from Manchester United.\nHowever, the agreement includes a €30 million permanent buy-out option that the Catalans can activate at the end of the season.\nSo far, Rashford has made an impactful start to life at Barca, registering five goals and six assists in 12 games across all competitions.\nReflecting on his motivation for joining Barcelona, Rashford said his main focus was on football.\n\"The main focus is to win football matches, this is why I joined this club, and it's what the club demands,\" Rashford said.\nThe England international also praised his new teammates, highlighting the players who have impressed him the most.\n\"Lots of players have lots of qualities but probably the standouts are Lamine Yamal. And, for me, Pedri is unbelievable,” Rushford noted.\n\"They have such high quality. It's the perfect scenario to play with players like this.\"\nSpeaking further about Pedri, Rushford praised the midfielder’s intelligence and influence on the team.\n\"His game understanding is clear. From when he first got into the first team here, his game understanding is one of the main strengths,” he said.\n\"Having him in the team is a huge positive. If Pedri is playing well, there is a high chance that the team will score lots of goals.\"\nCurrently, Barcelona sits with two points behind rivals Real Madrid, who top La Liga, heading into this weekend's Clasico.",
