The 28-year-old, who also won this year’s Ballon d’Or, helped PSG secure all domestic titles and reach the final of the Club World Cup. He was able to attend the ceremony as he was already in Qatar for Wednesday’s Intercontinental Cup final against Flamengo.\nBonmati, who was named Champions League Player of the Season, also won the women’s Ballon d’Or for the third consecutive year. She helped Barcelona secure the domestic treble and reach the Champions League final. The 27-year-old also led Spain to the Euro 2025 final, narrowly losing to England on penalties, and was named Player of the Tournament.\nCoaching honours went to Sarina Wiegman, who won the Best Women’s Coach award for the fifth time after leading England to retain their European Championship title, and Luis Enrique, who claimed the Men’s Coach award after guiding PSG to their first Champions League victory.\nIn the goalkeeper categories, England and Chelsea’s Hannah Hampton won the Best Women’s Goalkeeper award, making crucial penalty saves to secure England’s Euro 2025 win and a domestic treble with her club. Italy’s Gianluigi Donnarumma, now with Manchester City, won the Men’s Keeper award for his role in PSG’s treble-winning campaign.\nThe FIFA Puskas Award for best men’s goal went to Santiago Montiel for an overhead strike for Independiente against Independiente Rivadavia in May. The FIFA Marta Award for the best goal in women’s football was awarded to Mexico’s Lizbeth Ovalle for her spectacular scorpion kick for Tigres against Guadalajara in March. -Reuters\n🔗 Follow Ghanaian Times WhatsApp Channel today. https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VbAjG7g3gvWajUAEX12Q\n🌍 Trusted News.
