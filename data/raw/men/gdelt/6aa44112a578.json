When you have the quality he has, it is just about getting to the right spots,\" Bobb said ahead of Saturday's trip to Bournemouth.\n\"As long as he gets in those situations, if he misses a few one game it's not like he's going to start missing all his chances.\"\nAfter Jim Ratcliffe finally completed his purchase of a 25 percent stake in Manchester United this week, the British billionaire boldly declared his desire to knock Liverpool and Manchester City off their perch.\nHaving spent the past decade in the shadow of their two bitter rivals, Ratcliffe, who will take control of football operations from majority owners the Glazer family, knows that repackaging an old line from United's former boss Alex Ferguson will play well with a disgruntled fanbase.\nBut even Ratcliffe, 71, acknowledged it will take time to put United in position for a first title since 2013.\nFor now, Erik ten Hag's side have the more modest goal of trying to salvage a troubled campaign by qualifying for next season's Champions League via a top-four finish.\nUnited, currently five points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa, have little margin for error as Fulham visit Old Trafford on Saturday to officially kick off the Ratcliffe era.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
