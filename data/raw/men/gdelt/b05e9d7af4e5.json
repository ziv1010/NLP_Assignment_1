Then after another FA Cup final defeat in 1999, that meant UEFA Cup qualification.\nChampions League football arrived on Tyneside again in 2002/03 after a fine 3rd place Premier League finish for Sir Bobby Robson’s charges.\nWe became the first team to qualify from the group stage despite losing our first three games.\nThere was then UEFA Cup semi and quarter finals in 2004 and 2005.\nGlenn Roeder led us into the UEFA Cup again in 2006, after we qualified by winning the Inter-Toto Cup.\nIn 2012 Newcastle United were back on European soil after a 5th place in the Premier League.\nWe are now back in the Champions League after an exciting and exhilarating campaign last season under Eddie Howe and fought out a hard earned draw on Tuesday against Milan at the San Siro.\nIf the Sunderland fans are jealous of Newcastle United and our fans’ jaunts on the continent, all they have to do is take a look at their own poor top flight league placings over the best part of the last 70 years.\nThey have never really been deserving of a place in Europe, although I do commend them on their 1973 FA Cup success.\nWe have a European pedigree and reputation that they unfortunately don’t.\nI’m a fan of spaghetti westerns and in one of the final scenes in Sergio Leone’s ‘The Good, The Bad and the Ugly’ there came a great metaphor ,which went like this.\n“There are two sorts of people in this life. Those with loaded guns and those who dig.”\nThe bitter and envious Sunderland fans will always be digging so long as Newcastle United and us Geordies are around.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
