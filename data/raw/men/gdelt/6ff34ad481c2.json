The ex-Benfica forward has struggled for game time this season, making just seven Premier League starts and scoring just four goals and two assists in 20 appearances.\nCutting ties with the 25-year-old Uruguayan, who has been less effective under Slot than he was with the Dutchman’s predecessor Jurgen Klopp, may be the right call. Either way, an intriguing period lies ahead for Liverpool.\nLiverpool transfer roundup: Huijsen latest and an Isak alternative\nTEAMtalk previously revealed that the Reds are planning on signing a new centre-back this summer and Bournemouth’s Dean Huijsen is one such target.\nThe 19-year-old, who has a £50m (€60m, $63m) release clause, has impressed for the Cherries since signing from Juventus last summer and Liverpool are now considering him as a long-term Van Dijk replacement.\nElsewhere, if Liverpool are unable to sign Isak, they may turn their attention to Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike, who is also on Arsenal’s radar.\nThe German team are hoping to hold onto the 22-year-old for a while longer but it is thought that a bid of £60m or so could secure his services.\nFinally, Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly keen on bringing Reds centre-back Ibrahima Konate to Ligue 1 over the summer.",
