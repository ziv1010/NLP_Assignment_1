  "body_text": "June will be a busy month for 10 Manchester United players as a summer of international football begins this week.\nEight of Erik ten Hag’s squad will travel to Germany as Euro 2024 begins on Friday, while two will join the fun in the United States a week later as the 2024 Copa America kicks off. Both tournament finals will be held on July 14.\nAdvertisement\nOff the field, there are numerous news stories for fans to keep an eye on — such as Ten Hag’s future and how INEOS plans to approach its first summer transfer window since buying a minority stake in the club.\nOn the field? Allow The Athletic to present a guide to some things United should keep an eye on at the Copa America and Euro 2024.\nGO DEEPER\nThis summer on The Athletic: Tournaments, transfers and tours\nHow to follow Euro 2024 and Copa America on The Athletic…\n- Follow Euro 2024 news here | Euro 2024 fixtures\n- Follow Copa America news here | Copa America fixtures\nWhich Luke Shaw turns up this summer?\nInjury issues to several England left-backs mean Gareth Southgate has wrapped Luke Shaw in cotton wool, hoping he will recover from his hamstring issue later in the tournament (much like he did at Euro 2020).\nGO DEEPER\nLuke Shaw says he and Manchester United at 'fault' over injury problems\nIf England are to be successful at the Euros, they will need the full-back in the starting XI. His ball progression skills, defensive aptitude, and set-piece delivery have made him a valued member of Southgate’s setup.\nOn his day, few left-backs are better than the 28-year-old (Shaw will turn 29 on July 12). That those days are becoming rarer is a point of frustration for United fans; the left-back managed just 15 club appearances in 2023-24, and he can be prone to lapses in concentration.\nAn ideal summer has Shaw reaching full match sharpness over the tournament and performing well before he returns for a pre-season tour at United, raring to go. A less-ideal summer sees him struggle for fitness and form, making it clear United will need another look at their left-back options in the transfer window. (Here are some suggestions we made earlier.)\nWill Lisandro Martinez be OK?\nLisandro Martinez will travel to the Copa America in an interesting position.\nThe 26-year-old played 90 minutes in the 1-0 win over Ecuador. A centre-back partnership with Cristian Romero should have enough complementary qualities to be Lionel Scaloni’s preferred pairing. Yet the head coach may pivot back to the tried and tested Nicolas Otamendi, now 36.\nAdvertisement\nWould United fans prefer Martinez to have a starring role at the Copa America as Argentina look to win back-to-back tournaments? Or would they prefer to keep him out of harm’s way as a substitute? Let us know in the comments.\nIs Altay Bayindir going to get a look in?\nThe 26-year-old goalkeeper made only one appearance for United last season and his lack of game time has seen his stock slide further for the Turkish national team. Where he once looked to have the upper hand over Ugurcan Cakir, he now appears to be the nation’s third shot-stopper behind Cakir and Mert Gunok in the eyes of head coach Vincenzo Montella.\nBayindir is considered a capable goalkeeper, but it’s been a while since he’s played regular minutes. Will he be content sitting on the bench for some additional weeks this summer?\nIs this Kobbie Mainoo’s moment?\nMainoo makes football look easy.\nThe 19-year-old has established himself as a mainstay of the United midfield. He calmly receives and passes the ball under pressure, which should make him a good fit as the “third midfielder” alongside Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham.\nHowever, the skills that make Mainoo a natural successor to Michael Carrick for United may mean he encounters Carrick-esque problems for England. His press resistance — valuable when collecting the ball off his centre-backs for United — is less of a necessity in the slower games at international football. His more considered passing — and developing running power — may see Southgate opt for more adventurous players in England’s engine room.\nMainoo will have plenty to offer England over the years. Can he prove that they need him now?\nGO DEEPER\nKobbie Mainoo interview: 'I'll play anywhere on the pitch, I don't mind'\nWill Hojlund be United’s No 1 striker next season?\nRasmus Hojlund’s March 2023 hat-trick against Finland made him the youngest player to do so for Denmark since Michael Laudrup in 1983. The striker scored seven goals in Euro qualifying and manager Kasper Hjulmand will ask him to carry the majority of Denmark’s attacking load.\nAdvertisement\nThis should be great news. There were patches of 20243-24 in which the 21-year-old showed he was a dangerous striker, particularly when he’s running the channels or stretching defences. If Denmark are building their attack around Hojlund, we could see more of the form that saw the striker score five goals in the Champions League group stages.\nBut as Ten Hag explained partway through the season, Hojlund can lose his attacking rhythm after encountering (injury-related) setbacks. There are games in which his first touch has been inconsistent, and he can have difficulty wrestling with defenders with his back to goal.\nConsistency will be a keyword for Hojlund, both for this summer and the ones beyond it.\nIf the striker is to have a successful tournament, he might need a helping hand from club-mate Christian Eriksen. Hojlund described Denmark’s recent 2-1 victory over Sweden as like “take your dad to work day”, making special mention of Eriksen outclassing him with his performance.\nView this post on Instagram\nNo other nation will rely on United players as strongly as Denmark this summer. The duo will need to be at their very best at Euro 2024.\nCan McTominay make Germany sweat?\nScott McTominay finished Euro 2024 qualifying scoring seven goals – one more than Erling Haaland’s tally.\nThe 27-year-old’s transformation from chugging defensive midfielder into box-crashing attacking sledgehammer was a welcome boon to Steve Clarke’s side. McTominay’s eye for goal was so appealing that Ten Hag began to give him similar freedoms for United.\nGO DEEPER\nScotland Euro 2024 team guide: Greater than the sum of their parts and aiming high\nFreshly recovered from a minor injury, McTominay will be needed by Scotland to cause a ruckus and pick up a few goals so they make it out of Group A.\nWill Garnacho offer anything off the bench for Argentina?\nScaloni has devastating attacking possibilities to put around Lionel Messi for this summer’s Copa. Angel Di Maria will surely be one forward in Argentina’s starting line-up, while Julian Alvarez and Lautaro Martinez are talented options.\nAdvertisement\nAlejandro Garnacho will be hoping to use the tournament as an opportunity to add to his five caps, but will most likely have to do it from the bench. For all of his direct and disruptive ball-carrier qualities, Garnacho will be more of late closer than an integral cog to the Argentina machine. The 19-year-old has only played for Argentina once in a competitive game — featuring for five minutes against Bolivia in a World Cup qualifier in December.\nGO DEEPER\nCopa America 2024: A beginner's guide\nThe forward might not play too much during the Copa, but expect him to be a late difference-maker.\nCould Bruno Fernandes be the Euros player of the tournament?\nUnited’s Portuguese contingent finished 2023-24 well. Bruno Fernandes won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award for the third occasion and Diogo Dalot was awarded the Players’ Player of the Season.\nBoth men could have a key role in Portugal’s run through the Euros, but for Fernandes, the next few weeks represent an opportunity to rubber-stamp his place among the great attacking midfielders of his time. His preference and perseverance for line-breaking passes can occasionally be a hindrance in United games in which his team could be better served by retaining the ball. But he has an ability to conjure something out of nothing.\nGO DEEPER\nPortugal Euro 2024 squad guide: The complete package, if the balance is right\nHe’s not at the top of Player of the Tournament lists now — but that accolade is not beyond him.\nManchester United players at this summer’s Euro/Copa America\nGoalkeepers: Altay Bayindir (Turkey)\nDefenders: Luke Shaw (England), Diogo Dalot (Portugal), Lisandro Martinez (Argentina)\nMidfielders: Scott McTominay (Scotland), Christian Eriksen (Denmark), Kobbie Mainoo (England), Bruno Fernandes (Portugal)\nForwards: Rasmus Hojlund (Denmark), Alejandro Garnacho (Argentina)\n(Top photo: Getty Images)",
