The former boxer was pictured on the streets of Istanbul enjoying a song and a dance as City supporters gear up for a historic evening.\nThe Hitman has followed his team across Europe including in Madrid for the Champions League semi-final, and would not miss out on the chance to attend such a huge night in the club's history. \"I went out to Madrid at the Bernabeu, which was fantastic,\" Ricky told the Daily Star.\n\"We've come a long way, City. When you think that we were in the League One a few years ago, to be playing a Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid and beating them 4-1 on aggregate, it's crazy!\nJoin our WhatsApp Top Stories and Breaking News group by clicking this link.\n\"City have always had a massive following, even when we were in League One, but, speaking on behalf of most City fans, I can honestly say that I don't think any of us thought we'd be watching football as good as this, so we're making the most of it while we have it.\"\nSpeaking before heading out to Istanbul, Ricky said he enjoys mixing with the fans and having fun ahead of the game. \"I don't really get pestered by the City fans when I’m watching the games,\" said Hatton.\n\"When I travel to the matches with my friends, I always go where the fans are, so for the Madrid game we were in the main square having a few drinks and a sing-song with the other fans. I've always considered myself, even when I was World Champion, no different to the people that support me and no different to any of the City fans.\n\"I'm going to Istanbul for the Champions League final and I'm looking forward to spending some time with the fans there too.\"\nRead more of today's top stories here\nREAD NEXT",
