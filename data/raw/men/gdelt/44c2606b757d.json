However, the weekend was somewhat overshadowed by suggestions Kelly is no closer to extending her stay at the Joie Stadium.\nKelly joined the Manchester club from WSL rivals Everton in 2020, and she swiftly became a regular in the team. Although, in recent times, minutes have been much harder to come by for the 26-year-old.\nThe winger has accumulated just 85 minutes of action in the four WSL games so far this season and has been an unused substitute in their last two matches across all competitions. A report on Monday from the Daily Mail indicated contract negotiations have hit an impasse due to a fractured relationship between the player and manager, which is a concern given she is out of contract at the end of the current season.\nWhen asked about the rumours on Tuesday ahead of City’s Champions League clash against Austrian side St. Polten, Taylor described the story as a \"non-event\" and insisted Kelly is aligned with all they are doing at City and understands the intense competition for places at the top end of the pitch.\n\"There's no news on the contract front,\" he said. \"I felt the story was a bit of a non-event, if I'm being honest. Particularly after a solid performance from us at the weekend.\n\"Chloe has been great. She's really working hard, she's really engaged and she's really aligned with what we're doing. She understands, like the rest of the players at the top end of the pitch, that things are slightly different from the last season or two.\n\"We have been able to strengthen in those areas. She's contributed this season, for sure, and like the rest of the players I talk to, whether it be Mary [Fowler] or Aoba [Fujino], you've got to be ready to play if you're needed.\n\"Chloe is doing that really well, I have to say. She's been great in that sense, and like I said, she's really aligned with the team. She's working hard for the team, and sometimes you get the rewards off the back of that, and sometimes you don't.\n\"She's doing everything we expect of her, she's contributed goals and assists in the minutes she's had this season, and that's exactly what we're looking for.\"",
