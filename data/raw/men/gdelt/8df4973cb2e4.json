Laverty was interested.\nHe met with a number of prominent Down GAA people for something of an informal interview as summer turned to autumn.\nLaverty told those gathered that McGuinness was coming into his backroom team. Naturally, that got people excited. Having delivered success already at U20 level, Down wanted Laverty.\nSoon after, he pulled out. One of his issues was that McGuinness was proving hard to contact. At that point, McGuinness had not been involved in soccer coaching since he had a spell just short of six months in charge of Charlotte Independence that brought one win in 14 games and, ultimately, dismissal.\nAt the time, McGuinness spoke to The Irish Times, with whom he had a regular column, and denied involvement with Down.\nIn the meantime, he had popped up doing a training session with Galway footballers, a season with Naomh Máirtín in Louth, and later helped his native club Naomh Conaill in their preparations to defeat St Eunan’s in the 2022 Donegal county final.\nEarlier that year, in July, he was pictured among a number of coaches on an FAI course attending a Champions League early qualifier between Shamrock Rovers and Hibernians at Tallaght Stadium.\nWith options whittling away, Down turned to James McCartan, a man with a solid track record in keeping Down competitive and bringing them to the 2010 All-Ireland final. Laverty was able to give full attention to Kilcoo and it helped as they went on to win the All-Ireland club title, beating Kilmacud Crokes in the final.\nWhen the year didn’t work out for Down or McCartan, Laverty came back into the frame once more as manager.\nHe accepted the role in August 2022 and built a backroom team including Marty Clarke, Mickey Donnelly and Declan Morgan.\nAfter they won a league game away to Tipperary the following January, it was reported that McGuinness had joined the backroom team.\nThis is something that Laverty denied, stating that McGuinness, “Will not be involved in the Down senior management.”\nAfter that, it’s all about semantics. McGuinness was present once a week at training sessions to start with. That increased as the evenings got longer.\nSome of the McGuinness peccadillos remained. One evening at a training session in Ballykinlar, he refused to start it while someone from the club remained on the premises, fearing his methods might become known to a wider audience.\nWhen it came to match days, he wasn’t seen whatsoever. He was however, hooked up and communicating with the Down management, including for that Ulster championship 2-13 to 1-11 win for Down against Donegal.\nBy then, Paddy Carr had already been and gone as Donegal manager, leaving after relegation from Division 1 was confirmed. The selectors Aidan O’Rourke and Paddy Bradley held the post until the end of the season.\nOnce their business was concluded, a delegation of Donegal players approached McGuinness to come back as manager. His involvement with Down came to a close.\nIt was one of the more curious developments in the criss-crossing of county boundaries that happens among the coaching fraternity. It began with a false start, was revived a year later, but at every turn, each party downplayed the involvement or minimised it altogether.\nBut in Ulster, this kind of cross-pollination is nothing unusual.\nDown have plenty of it. As well as Mickey Donnelly, a former manager of the Tyrone minors and a Hogan Cup winning manager with St Ronan’s of Lurgan, they made a move for Ciaran Meenagh when his involvement with Derry ended after the 2023 season.\nMeenagh played underage football with Tyrone and a promising career was destroyed by injury. In his coaching career, he had assisted with Derry since the days of Damien McErlain’s management, with his day job as a teacher in Ballinascreen.\nWhen Armagh face Tyrone this weekend, quite apart from the usual statistical analysis that teams have on their opposition, selector Conleith Gilligan is intimately familiar with Tyrone football.\nThe Ballinderry man has coached or managed with Derrytresk, Coalisland and Edendork, three clubs all in a triangle just under four miles apart. He has managed Paudie Hampsey, Michael McKernan, Niall Morgan, Darren McCurry and Conn Kilpatrick at club level.\nThe Armagh backroom has another splash of cosmopolitan colour with Kieran Donaghy there. Had things panned out differently, he might have been in the Tyrone corner this Saturday in some fashion, his late father Oliver being a Beragh man.\nTyrone have a varied management team. Manager Malachy O’Rourke is from Fermanagh, but has lived in Tyrone for 33 years. He had local man Leo McBride with him in Fermanagh and Monaghan, adding Ryan Porter to the latter post.\nDonegal buck the trend somewhat. While McGuinness recruited Rory Gallagher as his assistant in his first spell in charge, this time it is different.\nHe has brother-in-law Colm McFadden along with Neil McGee and Luke Barrett as selectors, while a number of close associates from his club Naomh Conaill are helping out in various roles.\nFor a set-up that go to extreme levels to guard their methods, none of this is surprising. In November, it was reported that the highly active band of Donegal supporters club in London were footing the bill of €55,000 to erect an eight-foot high fence around one of the training pitches in Convoy, the Donegal training base.\nWhen Donegal training sessions are ongoing, a number of stewards are stationed around the perimeter of the pitch and are swift at moving on anyone that attempts to glance in the direction of the pitch.\nLittle wonder that McGuinness’ year with Down was downplayed so much.\nCheck out the latest episode of The42′s GAA Weekly podcast here",
