This collaboration brings together two iconic names known for their history, innovation, and commitment to excellence within football.\n“As Newcastle United Football Club embarks on a new chapter for the men’s and women’s team, adidas is honoured to provide them cutting-edge sportswear technology. Our previous partnership delivered some of the most iconic kits of the 90s and we look forward to creating many more unforgettable moments, inspiring fans and players alike.”\nDarren Eales, CEO of Newcastle United, was part of a club delegation that visited adidas’ global headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany to complete the deal, as captured on Amazon Prime.\nHe said: “Our upcoming partnership with adidas evokes memories of some of the most famous players, coaches and matches in the club’s history so we are delighted we will be teaming up once again as we look to create our own exciting future together.\n“The club, supported by our fans, owners and commercial partners, is on an exciting journey and we look forward to continuing that as we welcome adidas on board next summer.”\nA vital element of this new agreement will see Newcastle United rebuilding its own retail operations both in store and online, locally and globally, with further information to follow during the course of this season.\nPeter Silverstone, Newcastle United’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We are delighted to have agreed a new multi-year partnership with adidas from summer 2024. The history and heritage between the two brands is obviously very compelling and exciting.\n“This partnership will help us to deliver on our ambitious brand and commercial strategy. Importantly, it will allow us to rebuild a direct retail relationship with our current, and future, local and global fanbase.
