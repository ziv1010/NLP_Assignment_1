Our first domestic silverware in 70 years. Won the hard way. Who’ll forget that we dispatched three of the four sides that finished above us in the league to get our hands on that prize?\nAnd, Champions League qualification. Again. Sounds good doesn’t it? I can’t wait for the draw.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
