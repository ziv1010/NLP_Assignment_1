Could I come here and think about all the amount of games and trophies we would win in eight years?\n\"Probably not. But it is something we have not won yet and it is something that we want to win. Hopefully it will be Saturday.\"\nYet as Guardiola eyes what would be the third Champions League of his career, City cannot overlook the threat of an Inter team who qualified from their group ahead of Barcelona before seeing off Porto, Benfica and city rivals AC Milan.\nThey have maybe not faced a team of City's calibre, but they have a clear Cup pedigree, having recently retained the Coppa Italia.\n\"I mean, they're in the Champions League final for a reason,\" warned John Stones, whose move from central defence into midfield has been key to City's outstanding form.\n\"They've got incredible players, we can all see that. How they played in a big occasion, in a derby game in the Champions League semi-final, is never easy. We know what we're up against.\"\n'No fear' for Inter\nInter know what they are up against too, not least veteran 37-year-old forward Edin Dzeko. The Bosnian played for City between 2011 and 2016.\nHe has scored 14 goals this season and has been an excellent foil for Inter's star forward, Lautaro Martinez.\nSimone Inzaghi's side may not have as many superstars as City, but they have a grizzled back line, dangerous wing-backs and a hard-working midfield in which Nicolo Barella excels.\n\"We're talking about a football match, there's no fear,\" said Inzaghi, who was appointed in 2021 after the Nerazzurri had won Serie A under Antonio Conte.\nDefender Alessandro Bastoni added: \"You are scared of murderers, not football players. It would be a mistake to to talk about fear.\"\nInter are in their first final since winning the trophy under Jose Mourinho in 2010, the last victory in the competition for an Italian side.\nThey have lifted the trophy three times before, while City's only European silverware to date remains the Cup Winners' Cup, which they won in 1970 by beating Poland's Gornik Zabrze 2-1 in the final.\nSaturday's game will need to go a long way to equal the drama of the last final at the Ataturk stadium.\nIn 2005, Liverpool recovered from a three-goal half-time deficit to draw 3-3 with Milan before winning on penalties.\n© 2023 AFP",
