When it’s getting closer, we try and prepare the boys mentally for what’s coming ahead,” Finidi told the club’s media.\n“It’s extra motivation for the players, having this platform on the big stage. I think it’s going to bring a lot of expectations and a lot of confidence for the players. They are all looking forward to using this platform to showcase what they have.”\nRivers United are set to make their debut in the group stage of the CAF Champions League.\nThe group stage fixtures are scheduled to take place from 21 November 2025 through February 2026, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals slated for April.
