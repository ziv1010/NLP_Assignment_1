  "body_text": "Danny Murphy believes Arsenal should be considered the favourites to win the Champions League this season and can only see one team standing in their way.\nMikel Arteta’s side have made a flawless start to the competition this season and boast six wins from six games ahead of tonight’s test against Inter at San Siro.\nAtletico Madrid and Bayern Munich have already been comprehensively beaten at the Emirates, while the Gunners have amassed 11 goals from games on the road against Sparta Prague, Athletic Bilbao and Club Brugge.\nArsenal are in a commanding position in the Premier League, too, but Murphy sees no reason why they aren’t capable of securing a memorable double.\nPSG knocked Arsenal out at the semi-final stage last season after two evenly contested legs and former Liverpool midfielder Murphy insists the French champions are the side the north London club should fear.\n‘I think if you offered Arsenal just the Premier League, they’d take it, but I also think they’re capable of winning the Champions League,’ Murphy told Boyle Sports.\n‘It’s going to be very difficult, though, because in the Champions League, you can have one bad evening, or everything goes against you, and you’re out.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘You can even have an amazing performance and still not go through due to penalty shootouts, bad decisions, or a sending off.\n‘But watching them play as regularly as I have, there’s no reason for them to not have the belief that they can win it. They’ve destroyed Bayern Munich, one of the other strong teams in the tournament. They’re playing better than anyone else in the Premier League.\n‘I don’t think the Spanish teams are as strong as they have been in the past. When you look at what Liverpool did to Real Madrid, even when Liverpool weren’t playing well, and what Chelsea did to Barcelona. The only one that concerns me is PSG.\nChampions League Odds | Outright Winner\nArsenal 9/2\nBayern Munich 7/2\nMan City 6/1\nPSG 13/2\nBarcelona 17/2\nReal Madrid 9/1\nLiverpool 9/1\nChelsea 16/1\nOdds supplied by Paddy Power\n‘I think once they get everyone fit, similar to last season, they could have a really strong second half. When PSG are at it and playing at their best, that’s a tough challenge for anyone.\n‘So they would probably be the other joint favourites with Arsenal at the moment because of their experience and because they won it last year.\nMore Trending\n‘But you have to reach for the stars. When you’re at a big club, you’re aiming to win it all. I had an experience where we won a treble at Liverpool, not the ‘real’ treble, but there was still a belief in the camp that every time we went on the pitch, we could beat anybody. Whether it be Barcelona in the semi-final or whoever, we truly believed it.\n‘I think Arsenal have that belief now. They look like a confident group, they don’t look fearful. I know there was a bit of criticism after the Liverpool game, but they had played a lot of games, there was some fatigue, and Liverpool played well.\n‘Liverpool have top-class players and kept the ball really well to stop Arsenal from getting on top of them. But overall, I think they should be confident. They should have real belief that they can win both.’\nMORE: Arsenal in talks to sell £30m defender in permanent deal after transfer development\nMORE: Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri holds positive talks over loan to Champions League club\nMORE: Manuel Akanji aims dig at Arsenal over ‘best team in Europe claim’ ahead of Inter clash",
