  "body_text": "The report into the chaos at last season’s Champions League final is 220 pages long — and just about every one of them contains a stern, chastening, humiliating rebuke for UEFA and the French authorities.\nQuite right too.\nBecause anyone who was caught up in the mayhem outside the Stade de France on May 28 will tell you the picture painted by UEFA on the night (“the late arrival of fans”) and by French ministers in the appalling aftermath (praising their security operation and the use of tear gas, blaming the problems on a “massive fraud” of “30,000 to 40,000 people with fake tickets or no tickets”) was an outrage.\nAdvertisement\nIt has taken nearly nine months for an independent review panel, led by Portuguese politician Dr Tiago Brandao Rodrigues, to investigate the matter and to replace the authorities’ narrative with the truth.\nFar from blaming supporters, the review blames the issues on an “absence of overall control or oversight of safety and security” in UEFA’s preparations and a “defective” police operation, which included the “life-threatening and disproportionate” use of tear gas on innocent fans.\nThe review panel was damning of UEFA but also of Gerald Darmanin, the French interior minister, and Amelie Oudea-Castera, France’s minister for sport, who repeatedly praised the security operation while trying to pin the blame on Liverpool supporters. UEFA, the French Football Federation, the local Prefecture de Police and government officials were also implicated in what the panel called a “reprehensible” attempt to “deflect responsibility for the planning and operational failures of stakeholders”.\nIt all sounds horribly familiar, doesn’t it?\nThere are haunting echoes of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, which caused the deaths of 97 Liverpool supporters, only for the authorities (in this case, led by South Yorkshire Police) to blame the fans in an attempt to shift focus away from inadequate security arrangements and failures of crowd control.\nIn both cases, independent reviews exposed alarming shortcomings in leadership both on the day and in the aftermath.\nAs stated in the report, “Institutional defensiveness, putting reputation and self-interest above truth and responsibility, prevents progressive change. A healthy organisation welcomes scrutiny and criticism based on evidence, an unhealthy one hides behind prejudice and baseless assertions and contributes to a carousel of blame, where it is everyone else’s fault. That is why independent investigations based on evidence are so important, because otherwise the same will happen next week or next year with devastating consequences.”\nAdvertisement\nThe unsuccessful smear campaign is a big part of this story — and those responsible for it should retract their comments and offer a profound apology — but this is ultimately about a colossal failure that could have had disastrous consequences at the 2021-22 Champions League final.\nAs stated in the report, “All the stakeholders interviewed by the panel have agreed that this situation was a near-miss: a term used when an event almost turns into a mass fatality catastrophe. It is remarkable that no one lost their life.”\nChillingly, the report added: “The parallels between Hillsborough 1989 and Paris 2022 are palpable. The similarities include the fact that both events were preventable and both were caused by the failures of those responsible for public safety. Neither was a ‘black swan’ event, or the result of a ‘perfect storm’. Both events were foreseeable.\n“In the judgement of the panel, the different outcomes were a matter of chance. In one, nearly a hundred died, the other none — but through no merit of those in charge.”\nThis is precisely what Liverpool supporters told The Athletic on the night of, and the day after, the final.\nThe stories our journalists heard involved a variety of details and individual experiences, ranging from the infuriating to the terrifying, but the common theme (echoed by those of us on reporting duties that day) was about the terrible organisation, which created problems rather than solved them.\nThat has to change.\nAs much as fans and we in the media will focus on the authorities’ efforts to deflect blame onto the innocent, it is even more important that there is a change in how these big events are organised and policed — that the near-miss at the Stade de France is the catalyst for lessons to be learnt, like the English authorities should have learnt from the “near-miss” at the 1981 FA Cup semi-final between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers at Hillsborough, eight years before disaster struck at the same end of the same stadium.\nAdvertisement\n“We set out initially hoping for a retraction of the statement UEFA put out before the game started, saying the kick-off was delayed due to the ‘late arrival of fans’,” Liverpool supporter Joe Blott, of the Spirit Of Shankly fans’ group, told The Athletic. “We wanted an apology for that and for the lies about there being thousands of ticketless fans.\n“But more than anything else, we want it to be safe for any future game they organise. There’s another Champions League final in three months. Can we be confident that this one will be organised better and that fans can go there feeling safe?”\nIt isn’t just finals, though. Blott cites Liverpool fans’ experience in Champions League matches away to AC Milan, Benfica and Villarreal last season.\nAnd it isn’t just Liverpool, as some rival supporters might like to suggest. Anyone who has followed their team away in Europe in certain countries — France, Italy and Spain, in particular — is likely to tell the same stories of overzealous policing: riot officers, batons, tear gas, the assumption that they are dealing with the same hooliganism problem that blighted English football in the 1980s.\nOf course, there are occasions when crowd disorder is a serious issue. English fans behaved appallingly at the European Championship final against Italy at Wembley in July 2021. That, too, was described as a “near-miss” and in that instance, Baroness Casey’s review concluded that, as well as a huge number of failings in terms of organisation and security, these were compounded severely by behaviour which was “not just disgraceful (but) recklessly endangered lives”.\nThe Stade de France 10 months later was nothing like that.\nHaving been at both finals, the first as a paying spectator and the second as a working journalist, the moods could hardly have been more different.\nAdvertisement\nArriving at Wembley on the day of that Euros final, there was a wild, unsettling, anarchic feeling in the air and it was apparent from an early stage that the police and the stewards were struggling to keep control.\nBy contrast, the Champions League final felt entirely normal, until fans were confronted with a dangerous bottleneck just beyond the stadium’s perimeter.\nAnyone making their way from the Stade de France Metro station, finding themselves funnelled into an underpass and then detained for more than an hour in an ever-more-congested narrow section of street alongside a dual carriageway, would have been forgiven for wondering what on earth the French authorities thought they were dealing with here.\nA potential riot? Hardly. Supporters were treated appallingly and yet, even when kick-off time approached with many ticket-holders still kept outside, some of them being crushed, others being sprayed with tear gas, they still behaved with restraint. And then they found themselves blamed.\nAt least now, the truth has been established.\n“Supporter groups across Europe have long called for a higher standard of policing, steward and fan experience across all European club fixtures,” said the Football Supporters Association’s head of policing and casework Amanda Jacks, who was part of the panel investigating last year’s events in Paris. “Fans can continue to play a part by ensuring their own clubs read this report and take note.”\nThe report concludes with 21 recommendations to improve safety and security at future UEFA finals.\nThese include the need to engage with Football Supporters Europe and other fan organisations in the planning process, to move towards digital-only ticketing — though this was a problem at the Stade de France, where some tickets did not scan properly — and to improve arrangements around security perimeters, particularly when it comes to catering for supporters with disabilities or special needs.\nAdvertisement\nAbove all, the report stated that policing and security needs to embrace “an approach towards supporters based on ‘safety, security and service’ rather than one based on preparing for disorder”.\nThat is precisely the issue.\nIt comes from a culture in which fans are demonised and portrayed as a threat to public safety. Interior minister Darmanin said it in the days after the final — “Liverpool supporters pose a threat to our public”, apparently oblivious to the issue, highlighted in the report, of fans visiting the Stade de France being attacked outside it by locals, both at last year’s final and on previous occasions.\nThere are serious questions for the French authorities to answer, as thoughts turn to the country hosting this autumn’s rugby union World Cup — including a final at the Stade de France — and to the Olympic Games in Paris in the summer of 2024, but also to the way they continue to police matches in the Champions League and indeed France’s Ligue 1 top flight in the meantime.\nFor UEFA, too, there are serious questions about the complacency that was seemingly shown at every level of their organisation in the lead-up to last season’s final.\nThere was an apology from UEFA general secretary Theodore Theodoridis to Liverpool supporters on Monday evening — “for the experiences many of them had when attending the game and for the messages released prior to and during the game which had the effect of unjustly blaming them for the situation leading to the delayed kick-off”.\nBut as welcome as those words might have been, what matters now is actions: UEFA engaging more closely with groups such as Football Supporters Europe and moving towards a more progressive, more conciliatory approach to crowd management, rather than the all-too-familiar routine of batons first, tear gas second, ask questions later.\n“The panel has made clear to UEFA that this report has to be taken seriously and cannot be allowed to sit in a drawer gathering dust,” Jacks said. “Lasting, positive change has to come from this.”\n(Top photo: Adam Davy/PA Images via Getty Images)",
