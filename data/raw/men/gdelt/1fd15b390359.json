His leadership continued to inspire Bhutanese athletes and sports administrators.\nBhutan also witnessed four significant developments: the groundbreaking ceremony of the world-class Rama Centre of Excellence for Cricket and Shooting in Thimphu, the inauguration of an international-standard cricket ground in Gelephu, the introduction of sports science, and the inception of a sports insurance scheme for athletes and coaches.\nAthletes who made history\nWhile all athletes put forth their best efforts, a few carved their names in history.\nLieutenant Jigme Palden Dorji became the first Bhutanese to summit Mount Everest, while bodybuilder Thinley Wangkay Dorji clinched gold at the 15th World Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championships in the Maldives.\nFootballer Deki Lhazom secured the Golden Boot for being the highest goal scorer at the SAFF Women’s Championship, and Sangay Wangchuk of the Royal Bhutan Army won the Snowman Race. Additionally, Sangay Wangchuk and Kinzang Lhamo triumphed in the 10th Bhutan International Marathon, and compound archer Tandin Dorji Paro claimed a silver medal at the Bhutan International Grand Prix in Thimphu.\nHosting international competitions\nBhutan significantly increased its international presence by hosting over 10 international tournaments.

Karatekas won 42 medals at the South Asian Karate Championship, while judokas secured two gold, two silver, and four bronze medals at the Jita-Kyoei International Judo Tournament in Thimphu.\nAmong all sports, football maintained its status as Bhutan’s most popular game.

Boxer Migma Dorji competed in the Asian Boxing Confederation’s U-22 and Youth Boxing Championships in Kazakhstan, while Bhutanese chess players took part in the 45th Chess Olympiad in Budapest, Hungary.\nBhutan was also represented at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris by swimmer Sangay Tenzin, runner Kinzang Lhamo, and recurve archer Lham Dorji.
