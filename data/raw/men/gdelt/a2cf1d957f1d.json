For me it is too much to give a red for this play and from then on it is a different game.\n‘I told the referee that he was very bad, that he was a disaster and does not understand football. It killed the tie. It changes everything. I don’t like to talk about the referees but we have to say it, we can’t stay silent.\nMore Trending\n‘Barca will try again.

We had two moments today that could have set us back, but we were strong and deserved to progress in the end.\n‘I’m proud to say that we deserved to progress against a team like Atletico Madrid and now we face Paris.\n‘Our first [group] game against them wasn’t good. In the second game, we adjusted to them better and were closer to victory.
