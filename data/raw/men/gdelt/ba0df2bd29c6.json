As such, Ten Hag has no use for the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer signing.\nTelles cost £15.4m when arriving from FC Porto back in 2020. The Brazil international featured sparingly during his first two years at Old Trafford and was loaned out to Sevilla last season.\nTelles racked up 38 appearances across all competitions for the Europa League winners. However, Sevilla seemingly have no intention of bringing him back on board on a permanent basis.\nThat is troubling for Man Utd given Telles only has one year remaining on his contract. As such, another loan spell makes zero sense given he’d become a free agent once it concludes.\nAn outright sale is the ideal solution and according to Portuguese outlet O Jogo, Man Utd may find a willing buyer in the form of Porto.\nTelles previously played for Porto between 2016-20 and per the report, is keen to return. Porto can also offer the lure of Champions League football given their second-placed finish in the Primeira Liga last term.\nWith Man Utd keen to sell and Telles happy to join Porto, the ball is now in the Portuguese club’s court.\nClouding the issue slightly is the claim Porto will only begin ramping up their summer transfer activities from July. As such, United have a smaller window to secure a sale.\nHowever, given Telles doesn’t appear to be courting widespread interest anyway, that is only a minor drawback.\nREAD MORE: Ten Hag in dreamland with world class star heading to Man Utd ‘next week’; transfer fee set",
