He wants to sign another player like Leandro Trossard, who can play on both flanks.\nReports suggest that the Gunners have enquired about signing in-form Barcelona winger Raphinha, who scored a stunning hat-trick against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday night.\nHowever, the Catalans have rejected Arsenal’s advances. Now, the North London side are reportedly looking at another Barcelona winger, Ferran Torres.\nIt’s claimed that Arsenal are one of several Premier League clubs keen on Torres, with manager Mikel Arteta a ‘huge fan’ of the former Manchester City ace.\nDespite having improved their financial situation in recent months, Barcelona will ‘consider offers’ for Torres as they look to increase their transfer funds.\nIn other news, Arsenal are reportedly interested in Real Madrid wonderkid Arda Guler, but will face competition from Man City for his signature.\nThe Cityzens view Guler as a potential long-term replacement for Kevin de Bruyne, who looks likely to depart the Etihad at the end of the season.\nDON’T MISS: Premier League Signings of the Season Power Ranking: Arsenal star 6th, Tottenham striker 7th…",
