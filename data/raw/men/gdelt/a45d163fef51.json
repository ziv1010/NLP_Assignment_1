Meanwhile, BBC Breakfast star Naga Munchetty received a boost to her pay, putting her in the top ten with £355,000, up from £345,000, but co-host Charlie Stayt's salary stayed the same\nThe top 10 earners this year are:\n- Gary Lineker - £1.35million\n- Zoe Ball - £515,000 - cut from £950,000\n- Alan Shearer - £440,000 - up from £380,000\n- Greg James - £425,000 - up from £415,000\n- Fiona Bruce - £410,000 - up from £405,000 and Nick Robinson - £410,000 - up from £345,000\n- Stephen Nolan - £405,000\n- Laura Kuenssberg - £395,000 - up from £325,000\n- Vernon Kay - £390,000 - up from £320,000\n- Justin Webb - £365,000 - up from £320,000\n- Naga Munchetty - £355,000 - up from £345,000\nJust missing out on the top ten was Radio 2 presenter Scott Mills, earning £355,000-£359,999, up from £315,000 - £319,999 last year, having taken over the station's Breakfast Show at the start of the year.\nA number of the BBC's on-screen talent doesn't feature in the publicly-funded BBC’s salary dossier, which discloses salaries above £178,000, because they are paid by external production firms or BBC Studios, the corporation’s commercial arm.\nMany big names, including Strictly Come Dancing hosts Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly, Graham Norton and Bradley Walsh do not feature for the same reason.\nIt comes as under-fire Director General Tim Davie received a £15k pay hike as he took home £540k. As the report was released, he said he can \"lead\" the BBC in the \"right way\" following a series of reputational scandals for the broadcaster.\nThe BBC has been criticised for a series of failings in recent months which included breaching its own accuracy editorial guidelines, livestreaming the controversial Bob Vylan set during Glastonbury, and recent misconduct allegations surrounding the MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace.",
