That player is Bruno Fernandes. In his second season as captain at United, he has been the one player who has been a level above the rest.\nFor Bournemouth, they currently sit six places above United in the league in 8th but have recently dipped in form.\nManchester United have been one of the worst teams that have been hit by injuries this season, with seven first team players out of the squad.\nCredit: vavel.com\nInter lineup against a strong Roma side\nInter have been spiralling lately, but they have no time to dwell on it as their season is on the line against a very strong Roma side.\nLosing in the final seconds to Bologna put Inter in a really difficult position. They have the same number of points as Napoli but face a far tougher and more condensed schedule. Their struggles were evident in the Cup against their cross-town rivals Milan, who bested them easily in the rematch, eliminating them from the competition.\nThat means Serie A holds even more weight now, with this upcoming match against Roma being hugely important. Should Inter fail to win and Napoli succeed in their game, Inter would drop to second place.\nThey cannot allow that to happen, but beating Roma will be challenging given how they’ve been performing recently. Keep reading this Inter vs Roma preview to find out what our algorithm predicts in this clash.\nInter have struggled lately, playing two very poor matches in a row. Neither the match against Bologna nor the one against Milan was good in any way, and fatigue is mostly to blame.\nTheir players are tired because the team doesn’t have a strong bench, and most of the starters have played a lot of football so far this year. It’s not something that will improve anytime soon, with the upcoming Roma match only a few days away.\nThe bottom line is simple: they have to win at all costs, and they will attempt to do so. There are some minor reasons to feel optimistic, because Roma aren’t world-beaters and can be defeated, but Inter haven’t been very good for a while.\nCredit: forebet.com\nFIXTURES\nPremier League\nSaturday 26th April\nSunday 27th April\nBournemouth 14:00 Manchester United\nSpanish La Liga\nSunday 27th April\nItalian Serie A\nSunday 27th April\nComo 11:30 Genoa\nVenezia 11:30 AC Milan\nFiorentina 14:00 Empoli\nInter Milan 14:00 Roma\nJuventus 17:00 Monza\nNapoli 19:45 Torino",
