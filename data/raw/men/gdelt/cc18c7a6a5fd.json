Fabrizio Romano writes of an offer from Como worth €7m, although Gianluca Di Marzio puts the number slightly higher at €10m.\nComo, backed by Italian football's wealthiest ownership group, have surged up the table in recent weeks thanks to improved results since Christmas, having initially struggled following promotion.\nCesc Fabregas' side lost summer signing Raphael Varane early in the campaign, with the French veteran choosing to retire after an injury flareup but continuing to work behind the scenes as a board member. Garcia also has experience of English football, playing 35 times for Manchester City at the start of his senior career, and could be a shrewd addition if a deal is done.\nBarcelona are over the worst of their financial problems but must still make considerations regarding the wage bill if they are to push ahead with summer spending to rebuild the squad, with Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford among their expensive targets.",
