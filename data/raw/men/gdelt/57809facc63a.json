It is a tricky balance to strike between maintaining discipline and not being authoritarian or obstinate to the point of cutting your nose off to spite your face, particularly in modern day dressing rooms.\nTen Hag may have called it right with Cristiano Ronaldo last season but it is debatable as to whether he has handled the delicate Jadon Sancho predicament as well as he could while his treatment of Maguire and Varane seems dubious at best.\n“You can ban players but it’s also about man-management of course and how to work with and handle players,” the perceptive former United and Netherlands defender Jaap Stam told The Overlap’s ‘Stick to Football’ podcast. “There was the Ronaldo thing, the Sancho thing, Raphael Varane probably – I don’t know if something’s happened over there.\nMore in Sports\n“There’s the thing with the press now and banning journalists from press conferences. It doesn’t work in your favour as a manager. You need to have peace and quiet.\n“You need to fully focus and I don’t think you want to talk about players or what players think about you as a manager.\n“I worry a little bit for him and that’s why it would be good if he gets the results. He has got to be worried and thinking about what’s going to happen now.”\n“Is he going to make progress?” 🇳🇱\nJaap Stam on his fellow countryman Erik ten Hag and his time at Manchester United so far. pic.twitter.com/ddCqefsSCZ— The Overlap (@WeAreTheOverlap) December 13, 2023\nWhen Varane joined United from Real Madrid for £42.7 million in August 2021, it was announced on the club’s website that his contract ran until 2025. However, that will only be the case if a 12-month option in the deal is exercised, meaning Varane will become a free agent next summer assuming that clause is not triggered or he does not leave beforehand.\nVarane is thought to want to stay at Old Trafford but it is no secret that his relationship with Ten Hag has deteriorated and it is hard to see how that can continue in the longer-term without things coming to a head.\nA transfer away next month cannot be discounted although his age and wages may deter European suitors, particularly as he could be available for nothing six months later, while a lot of Saudi Pro League clubs have already filled their foreign player quotas.\nEither way, Ten Hag has yet another player headache with which to contend.",
