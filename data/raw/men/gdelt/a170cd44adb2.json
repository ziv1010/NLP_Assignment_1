They’re going to probably support Villa, but I’ve left the other two at home, probably watching tonight, so we’ll wait and see who they support.”\nWilliam told the pundits that he was predicting a 2-1 victory for underdogs Villa, who ended up losing 3-1.\nThe royal hugged some of Villa’s players, including Marco Asensio and England international Marcus Rashford as they came out of the dressing room.\nAfter William discussed Villa’s tactics and the “intensity” of PSG’s press, former Manchester United defender Ferdinand joked: “Do not go for a punditry job, please, because I could be out of the game.\nWelcome to Parc des Princes, Prince William! 👋\nThe Prince of Wales, and Aston Villa fan, joins @rioferdy5 and @Ally_McCoist9 to talk about the Villans' Champions League clash against PSG 🗣️@KensingtonRoyal pic.twitter.com/AttIJDHxkK\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) April 9, 2025\n“The way he just dissected that there, I’m going to nick that for later on.”\nWilliam said Villa manager Unai Emery was an “absolute gentleman” and a “lovely guy”.\nDiscussing the Spanish coach, he added: “He’s an absolute tactician.\n“I mean, I try when I get the odd chance to talk to him, to try and take some nuggets of information from him, but he’s very guarded in what he says and how he does stuff.”\nWilliam was in the crowd for Villa’s victory over Bayern Munich earlier in the competition and away to Monaco in January.",
