  "body_text": "Premier League 2015/6 Preview\nHold on to your hats folks!\nIt all starts on Saturday, with the first of 40 commentary games on Today FM, as Manchester United play Tottenham, followed by Everton versus Watford.\nWe in the words of Ferrero Rocher will be 'spoiling you' on the opening day.\nAs Delia Smith of Norwich fame would say, here's one we prepared earlier to look ahead to the campaign, club by club:\nArsenal\nThe Gunners have won 2 FA Cups on the bounce, and wait for it, a Community Shield. Do they have what it takes to win a first title since 2004? Perhaps not, given they lack a traditional world class striker. Olivier Giroud doesn’t appear to be one and do they have enough brilliance behind him in the form of Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla to compensate? As a counterpoint, Theo Walcott could sparkle in a forward position if he remains fit. In addition, Petr Cech is a fantastic acquisition and Arsene Wenger’s deployment of Francis Coquelin in front of the defence is really paying dividends now. Alexis Sanchez was magnificent in his first nine months and embraced what the Premier League is all about. What we do know about Arsenal is that they play great football. If they can display greater mental strength and consistency then they can challenge very closely for the title.\nAston Villa\nThey go into the campaign having lost two major players; Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph. Will that money be re-invested? We have our doubts. Young starlet Jack Grealish has shown glimpses of greatness, but let’s not get carried away. The Villa midfield is nondescript and manager Tim Sherwood will have to work his magic on Emmanuel Adebayor, if he signs, but better hopes may rest with regular leader Gabi Agbonlahor and new man Jordan Ayew. From an Irish perspective, Ciaran Clark should get his game, even if he isn’t under Martin O’Neill. Villa may be in for a long, hard, relegation threatened season ahead.\nBournemouth\nSometimes the first album can pleasantly surprise, and Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe is a talented young manager. Bournemouth play with great pace and attacking verve. Callum Wilson lit up the Championship, but can he bring that form to a greater level? Republic of Ireland international Harry Arter and Andrew Surman are quality players that should help Bournemouth hold their own and not go straight back down. Bournemouth don't strike us as a team in the mould of Norwich, Leicester or Sunderland. In fact, it is not incredulous to say that they could finish in the top tier of the table.\nChelsea\nMoaning about the Wembley pitch or Rafael Benitez’s wife would raise an eyebrow into Jose Mourinho’s frame of mind going into the new season as defending champions. The Happy One? How deep is their squad as they also push to win the Champions League? Diego Costa is injured again and how do we know for certain that Falcao will be the player he was at Atletico Madrid and not the one we saw at Manchester United? Chelsea’s defence was superb last season, but they could do with picking up John Stones before the end of the transfer window with a view to the long term. That all said; they have top class players; wizard Eden Hazard, the evergreen John Terry, fulcrum Cesc Fabregas and the dominant Nemanja Matic. Favourites, but vulnerable favourites.\nCrystal Palace\nBoss Alan Pardew has made some really good signings; with Yohan Cabaye the pick of them. Patrick Bamford has also joined on loan from Chelsea, Connor Wickham is in the house and in Mile Jedinak and James McArthur, the Eagles have two decent midfielders. Yannick Bolasie can be unplayable on his day. Squad strength is deep, so Palace should be aiming for a top 10 finish, bolstered by a great home support at Selhurst Park.\nEverton\nThe challenge for manager Roberto Martinez is not to follow a mediocre season with another one. He also must hold onto his top players (see Barkley, Ross) and hope additions such as Tom Cleverley and the returning Gerard Deulofeu make a measureable impact. Romelo Lukaku is a class act up top, and in Steven Naismith and Gareth Barry, the Toffees possess rock solid performers. Here’s hoping for good seasons from James McCarthy, Seamus Coleman and Aiden McGeady at the traditional ‘Irish’ club of Merseyside.\nLiverpool\nThe jury is out on Brendan Rodgers, and the Antrim man will be hoping to generate the type of atmosphere that visited Anfield in the spring of 2013. The ‘we lost Luis Suarez’ excuse no longer holds water and the Steven Gerrard era is over. It means the excellent Jordan Henderson and Emre Can must lead, and a suspect defence must not buckle as the Reds bid for Champions League football again. Nathaniel Clyne is a great signing for the rearguard, while Christian Benteke could be a thriller in front of the Kop. The Belgian will need to be a hit record to end the goal drought as Daniel Sturridge once again battles injury. Adam Lallana is an underrated midfielder, while James Milner and Danny Ings should contribute as Liverpool cope with Europa League congestion. It all comes back to the defence though, doesn’t it?\nLeicester City\nNigel Pearson worked miracles at Leicester, and now he’s gone, to be replaced by ‘The Tinkerman’ – Claudio Ranieri. Leicester’s owners are playing a high stakes game. First things first, they possess a decent keeper in Kasper Schmeichel, but in front of them, the defence looks wobbly. Esteban Cambiasso is another name through the exit door – so Leicester will be pinning their hopes on new boys N’Golo Kante, Christian Fuchs and Shinji Okazaki. Jamie Vardy is the star player, but the Foxes could be heading for a fall.\nManchester City\nIf Pep Guardiola is eventually going to Manchester City, what will the players be thinking of when Manuel Pellegrini addresses them? It doesn’t appear the most stable environment at Eastlands. Captain Vincent Kompany was out of sorts last season, so will need to regain his form, especially as Eliaquim Mangala doesn’t seem to have worked out. Is Yaya Toure’s best football behind him? Raheem Sterling and Fabian Delph are purchases on the credit side of the ledger, but how will they fit into the team? Sergio Aguero, when fit, remains one of the best strikers in the world and Wilfried Bony is the perfect foil for the Argentinian. Add in David Silva, and it looks like a fantasy football side, but unity of purpose and team spirit do actually count and a deficit of same may cost City the title. Remember that with all of their riches, City have won their two Premier League titles by inches.\nManchester United\nUnited seemed to be in such disarray last season, with injuries, a new manager and a new system, so they must receive credit for qualifying for the Champions League. Expect a much improved showing from the Red Devils this time around. Louis Van Gaal could do with both a centre half and a striker before the end of August. In Morgan Schneiderlin, they have snapped up a quality holding midfielder to protect the likes of Marcus Rojo and Chris Smalling. World Cup winner Bastian Schweinsteiger is the marquee signing, but don’t expect him to play every game. Ashley Young enjoyed a great campaign last season, while Juan Mata and Memphis Depay will supply adventure. Can Wayne Rooney, who seems to have a great relationship with Van Gaal, score 20 goals next season? United will be better, but don’t look the finished product just yet. And we haven’t mentioned Marouane Fellaini at all.\nNewcastle United\nThe soap opera that is Newcastle has a new lead actor in Steve McClaren. A proven coach, who should keep the Magpies flying in the top flight. Serbian Aleksandar Mitrovic is an exciting signing, while Dutchman Georginio Wijnaldum is a goal scoring threat from deep. Another player from the Netherlands, Siem De Jong, may turn out to be a vital cog, but Newcastle look ordinary at the back and are poised for a topsy turvy, if safe campaign. At least Mike Ashley will get in the papers, or should we say, the internet. They still have the best fans, mind.\nNorwich City\nThe Canaries were relegated two years ago, so what has changed? Alex Neil is a very decent young manager and the good news for Republic of Ireland fans is that Robbie Brady is set to slot straight into the team on the left flank. Another Irishman, Wes Hoolahan, may be retained for fixtures at Carrow Road. Russell Martin is a teak tough defender, but will Gary Hooper and Lewis Grabban carry the can in the goal scoring stakes? Youssouf Mulumbu was a good buy, but is already injured. Norwich emerged from the quagmire that is the Championship, but are likely to be in another one in the shape of a Premier League relegation dogfight.\nSouthampton\nA top Academy and an excellent manager in Ronald Koeman had everyone sitting up and admiring the Saints last season, especially as they offloaded so many players. Nathaniel Clyne is gone now, but they’ve invested in a good replacement in Cedric Soares. It will be imperative for Victor Wanyama to remain fit following the departure of Morgan Schneiderlin. Up front, Graziano Pelle blows hot and cold, but is aided by the tricky Sadio Mane, one of three attacking players behind Pelle in a classic Koeman formation. One hopes that Tipperary’s Shane Long can start to flourish on the South Coast.\nStoke City\nMark Hughes is far more mild mannered as a manager as he was as ‘Sparky’ on the pitch, but his quiet revolution at Stoke continues and they could surprise a few onlookers. Shay Given is now a Potter, but set to be understudy to the promising Jack Butland. Marco Van Ginkel is a player on loan from Chelsea that could make waves as Hughes ditches the ‘Rugby League’ reputation of Stoke. Glenn Whelan and Stephen Ireland will contend for inclusion, and watch out for Spanish striker Joselu, a player that may lead the line effectively. Stoke finished 9th last season. They are capable of even better.\nSunderland\nThe Black Cats must have used up some of their nine lives last season, and they are set to require more luck this time around. Costel Pantilimon will provide some solidity, but a lot of their players have seen better days. John O’Shea should maintain an Indian Summer at this level as the legs begin to battle with him, while Lee Cattermole remains important in the middle of the park. If he can stay fit, Steven Fletcher is important in attack, but Jermain Defoe and Danny Graham could struggle to be the difference. Flirtation with the Championship beckons.\nSwansea City\nGarry Monk is an example that homemade talent can taste good, and his team plays nice football. 8th place last season was the stuff of John Toshack, but it won’t be as easy this time around. In Lukasz Fabianski and Ashley Williams, Swansea have the beginnings of a decent spine. Jonjo Shelvey is talented but undisciplined, while Iceland’s Gylfi Sigurdsson is a silky midfielder. Goals will be dependent on Ghanain Andre Ayew, who will be supported by the dangerous, but inconsistent Bafetimbi Gomis. Safe as a rollercoaster, but in the bottom half.\nTottenham Hotspur\nOne thing we have noticed about Tottenham is that their squad is threadbare. Toby Alderweireld and Kieran Trippier are good additions, but don’t scream as players that will make the difference in terms of Champions League qualification. Spurs also have the complication of Europa League football to contend with. Harry Kane was brilliant last season, but is carrying a lot on his shoulders now. Expect Chairman Daniel Levy to pull some type of rabbit out of his hat by the end of the transfer window as he always does, but also expect Spurs not to contend for major honours until the new stadium is built. At least the manager is not the issue, as Mauricio Pochettino is one of the best.\nWatford\nWho will be managing Watford by next May? Who will be playing for them? Where will they be? To hazard an educated guess, the Hornets will be buzzing around the bottom. Sebastian Prodl is a strong Austrian defender, while Almen Abdi should chip in with his fair share of goals. Troy Deeney is a proven hit man, but can he do it in the Premier League? Too many questions may reveal an answer that says ‘Relegation’.\nWest Bromwich Albion\nDespite his recent appearance in the limelight for reasons other than football, Derry native James McClean could flourish at the Hawthorns, as he does appear as a ‘Tony Pulis type of player’. Joleon Lescott and Darren Fletcher may be in a different phase of their careers, but will still do a job, as will the reliable James Morrison. Saido Berahino is the main attraction, but may not be around forever. Pulis will guarantee West Brom are tough to beat, and that will ensure they will comfortably retain their status in the best league in the world.\nWest Ham United\nCroatian Slaven Bilic is back at his alma matter, and stability will be the keyword as the Hammers prepare to move to the Olympic Stadium in London. Diafra Sakho is a top striker, but injury prone. In Carl Jenkinson, the Hammers have a flyer, while Winston Reid and Cheikhou Kouyate give backbone to the Irons. They’ll be fine, but there are a lot of mid strength players in the team, and that means the story has a mid table ending.",
