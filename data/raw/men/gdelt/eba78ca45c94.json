  "body_text": "As the UEFA Champions League kicks off another thrilling season, all eyes are on today’s marquee matchup between Premier League champions Manchester City and their Italian counterparts, Inter Milan.\nBoth teams are set to face off in what promises to be an exhilarating contest between two of Europe’s top clubs.\nFootball fans were treated to a goal-fest in the opening fixtures of the revamped Champions League tournament on Tuesday, with 26 goals scored on the first night.\nGerman giants Bayern Munich were involved in almost half of the goals, with a 9-2 victory over Dinamo Zagreb, while Liverpool beat AC Milan 3-1. Defending champions Real Madrid and Juventus also dispatched VfB Stuttgart and PSV, respectively, with 3-1 victories.\nMeanwhile, Premier League side Aston Villa made their return to top-tier European competition after 41 years in style with a 3-0 away win over Swiss club Young Boys on Tuesday, in front of Prince William, who was in the stands.\nHowever, all attention will be on the Etihad Stadium tonight as Manchester City, under the guidance of Pep Guardiola, welcome last season’s Scudetto winners, Inter Milan.\nGuardiola’s men, who are eyeing their second-ever Champions League title, are unbeaten in their first four Premier League games and will be hoping to extend their dominance to Europe, with key players like Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne expected to be pivotal as they look to capitalise on their attacking prowess.\nCity will not approach the clash as a stroll in the park, as Inter, who have made significant strides in Serie A, will seek to prove themselves against last season’s quarter-finalists. With a solid mix of youth and experience, the Nerazzurri have the talent to challenge City. Players like Lautaro Martínez and Nicolò Barella will be crucial in breaking down City’s defence and converting opportunities into goals.\nManchester City vs Inter Milan: Head-to-Head/Form\nTheir first meeting occurred in the 2022/23 Champions League, where City beat Inter 1-0 to lift their first-ever UCL title. Inter, who are three-time UCL champions, will be looking to avenge that defeat.\nCity come into the game in excellent form, having won all four opening Premier League matches, scoring 11 goals and conceding just three. Haaland has scored nine of these goals, including two back-to-back hat-tricks.\nInter, on the other hand, enter the game with two wins and two draws, having been rescued late in their last 1-1 draw by Denzel Dumfries (88′) against Monza in Serie A.\nOther Matches to Watch\nIn addition to the City vs Inter clash, several other exciting fixtures are on the slate:\n- PSG vs Girona\n- Bologna vs Shakhtar Donetsk\n- Celtic vs Slovan Bratislava\n- Club Brugge vs Dortmund\n- Sparta Praha vs RB Salzburg",
