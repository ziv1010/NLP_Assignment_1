He apologised for it and after that we move on,” he replied.\nOn injury news ahead of the match, Ten Hag confirmed:\n“Antony and Scott [McTominay], I expect them to be back. We have some problems, Harry [Maguire] struggled with a small injury against Bournemouth. He didn’t train this week so far but he’s now back on the pitch and I think he’ll be available for Sunday.”\nTen Hag was also asked his thoughts on exiled Jadon Sancho reaching the Champions League semi-finals with his loan club, Borussia Dortmund, and whether his form may have changed his future.\n“No, but we know he is a fantastic player. That is not a surprise. That is not the issue,” he replied bluntly.\nSpeaking about the ongoing frustrations around his team’s progress this season, the boss replied:\n“Yes, of course we want to win every game so when we don’t win we are disappointed. We are frustrated but we know also we can beat the best teams. We drew twice against Liverpool, we beat them in the FA Cup, we played very good against Chelsea.\n“When we play to our levels we can achieve really high highs. Last season was last season. We want to achieve every season, we want to win trophies, we have a big opportunity. We are in a semi-final but it’s a huge challenge.”\nHe was also asked his opinion on the changes to next season’s FA Cup, when replays are to be scrapped. He said:\n“It’s very sad for the British football culture but it is also inevitable. It’s due to the overload in the schedule, that’s dictated by FIFA and UEFA.”\nThere should be more comments from the presser in the embargoed section which will be published here tomorrow evening at 10.30pm.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
