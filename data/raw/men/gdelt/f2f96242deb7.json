In all the other games always there was an injury aspect we have to deal with. That is normal in football but not so many as we have had, and I know when you have so many injuries as we have had in crucial key positions you can't deliver the results you want to bring.\n\"That is my truth, others can have a different truth but I can't put energy in that.\"\nFollowing news that Mason Mount, Sofyan Amrabat and Willy Kambwala will not be fit to face Coventry, United's number of separate injury or illness cases has passed 60 for the season.\nSuch is the extent of their injury crisis that out-of-form midfielder Casemiro is in line to start at centre-back, with Harry Maguire - who has missed several training sessions this week due to a minor issue - the only fit senior option left in Ten Hag's ranks.",
