It sounds as though he could be in line for a rare start.\nWhilst 32 year old Michael Keane has only started one PL match since November but looks likely to play in the absence of first choice centre-backs, Keane set to leave on a free this summer.\nAshley Young could be set to be handed a last ever start for Everton having only started one PL game in over four months, he is also set to leave at the end of next month on a free, just days before his 40th birthday.\nEverton’s 22 year old attacking midfielder Carlos Alcaraz might also get a start, he has only had six PL starts whilst on loan a Goodison and is set to go back to Brazilian club Flamengo.\nEverton are going through a massive change and not just when it comes to moving stadiums. They have a host of players leaving this summer, some the choice of the club and some the choice of the players themselves.\nAs well as those mentioned above, the likes of Abdoulaye Doucoure, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Joao Virginia, Asmir Begovic, Armando Broja and Youssef Chermiti will also exit the club after this final match of the season. Which, if any, of his leaving players will David Moyes give sentimental final games to? Will he give younger players who will be still at the club next season a rare opportunity?\nNewcastle United have seen a number of their rivals for the remaining Champions League places, benefit from other clubs putting out weakened teams in recent weeks. After winning the Premier League we saw Liverpool do this to a serious degree against Chelsea, whilst both Spurs and Man U have clearly prioritised the Europa League.\nNobody should think that David Moyes and Everton will be simply handing the points over on Sunday BUT I think every reason to think that timing could for once be in favour of Newcastle United. Eddie Howe’s side with everything to play for in this final match of the season, up against a team/squad with nothing left to play for, who have already done their job(s) of avoiding relegation and then leaving Goodison Park in winning form.\nI think for sure that whatever team David Moyes picks, Newcastle United are facing Everton at a far more advantageous point of the season than would have been the case very recently. Especially when you factor in that they are all but sure to be missing their two key defenders, as well as club captain Seamus Coleman at the back.\nNow Eddie Howe’s side just have to now go out there and do what they have been doing, which is winning their last six home Premier League matches and scoring 20 goals in the process.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
