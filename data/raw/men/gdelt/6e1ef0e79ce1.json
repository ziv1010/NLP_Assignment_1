  "body_text": "Bayern Munich’s sporting director, Christoph Freund, is understood to have held a meeting with Jamal Musiala’s management.\nFlorian Plettenberg reported the update on X amid Liverpool’s interest in the German international (Football Insider), with the player currently unwilling to extend his terms at the Allianz Arena.\n❗️Christoph Freund has had a meeting with Musialas management. The bosses want him to become the decisive face of the club. But at the moment the are no concrete talks about a new contract beyond 2026. 🔴\n➡️ And as always reported via BILD the 20 y/o has no intention no extend… pic.twitter.com/xXqN1lCFcU\n— Florian Plettenberg (@Plettigoal) October 24, 2023\nPete O’Rourke has claimed that the Reds are, alongside Manchester City, doing their ‘due diligence’ over the possibility of landing the attacking midfielder in future.\nREAD MORE: Liverpool will be braced for ‘major change’ that could rock European football in December\nJamal Musiala’s stance on Liverpool\nIf one is to take Philipp Kessler’s reporting on the matter as gospel, Musiala is not considering Anfield as a possible destination as things currently stand.\nThat’s an understandable position to take in light of the project Thomas Tuchel is building in Bavaria, with top striker Harry Kane signed alongside a host of other exciting additions to the squad in the summer window.\nPresuming that Bayern can hold out until January for a top holding midfielder – a key requirement for the manager – you’d have to consider the Munich-based outfit a genuine contender for Champions League glory this term.\nThat’s not to suggest Liverpool as an option is a total non-starter in future, with a midfield overhaul completely transforming our fortunes in 2023/24.\nWe have our own transfer priorities to cater to, of course, which conflict with the need for an attacking midfielder, though it’s difficult to imagine us not being tempted into the market should a player of Musiala’s quality be made available.\n#Ep94 of The Empire of the Kop Podcast: EOTK Insider with Neil Jones🎙️",
