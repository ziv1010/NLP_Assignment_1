  "body_text": "Manchester City on Sunday made English Premier League history by becoming the first side to clinch four consecutive titles after beating West Ham at the Etihad stadium\nNo side in the history of the English top flight had ever won four successive titles, but City have become accustomed to rewriting the record books under Pep Guardiola.\nThe Catalan coach has masterminded six Premier League wins in the past seven seasons.\nIn four of those years, City have also surpassed 90 points. They were pushed this season to deny Arsenal a first title since 2003/04.\nThe Gunners celebrated a 0-0 draw at the Etihad last month that kept them one point in front of City with nine games to play.\nBut the champions were relentless in the run-in, winning their final nine league games, and scoring 33 goals.\nGuardiola conceded City had felt the pressure in a nervy 2-0 win at Tottenham in midweek that kept the destiny of the title in their own hands.\nIn the same scenario two years ago, they needed a remarkable late fightback from 2-0 down to beat Aston Villa 3-2 on the final day.\nThere was far less drama as West Ham melted under the baking Manchester sun in David Moyes’ final game in charge of the Hammers.\nFoden was recently crowned the football writers’ player of the year for his best-ever goalscoring season and ended any suspense after just 79 seconds.\nThe England international arrowed a blistering drive into the top corner to ensure there was no nervous wait for the title party to get started.\nFoden doubled City’s lead inside 20 minutes with another cool left-footed finish from Jeremy Doku’s cross for his 27th goal of the season.\nCity should have been out of sight before half-time as Alphonse Areola denied Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland failed to turn in from point-blank range.\nOut of nowhere, there was a twist in the tale of the first half when, from a West Ham corner, Mohammed Kudus’ outrageous overhead kick flew high past Stefan Ortega.\nHaaland claimed his second Golden Boot in as many seasons in the Premier League despite a day to forget in front of goal.\nThe Norwegian missed a huge chance to restore the home side’s two-goal cushion when he spooned over another inviting Doku cross.\nCity swiftly restored order at the start of the second period and fittingly it was Rodri, himself a player of the year contender, who delivered the knockout blow to Arsenal’s title hopes.\nThe Spaniard has not been on the losing side for club or country since March 2023.\nCity’s only three Premier League defeats came in the three games the 27-year-old was suspended.\nThis time Areola should have done better as the Frenchman failed to turn Rodri’s tame effort round the post.\nCity could cruise to the finish line and extend a remarkable 35-game unbeaten streak in all competitions from open play.\nThe only blip on that run was a penalty shootout defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals that denied Guardiola’s men the chance of back-to-back trebles.\nThey can make it double next weekend when Manchester United have the unenviable task of stopping their local rivals in the FA Cup final.\nBy achieving a degree of league dominance never seen before, City have made their case to be considered the greatest side English football has produced.\nThere was an anti-climactic end as City players had to tell fans to get off the pitch before the full-time whistle.\nThousands of supporters poured onto the field at the end despite pleas from the club to stay off the playing surface.\nAFP",
