But considering they were in the Group of Death with Inter Milan and Bayern Munich, who both qualified instead of the Spanish side, there’s no need to read into that too much.\nThat said, it says a lot for Inter that they managed to oust a red-hot Barca side.\nTottenham Hotspur, of course, did what Tottenham Hotspur often do – they entertained us with their whole “will they, won’t they qualify?” act and were indeed 45 minutes away from an early exit after falling behind to a goal at Marseille in the final group match. Harry Kane and co. recovered and the 2019 finalists joined UEFA Cup holders Eintracht Frankfurt in the last 16.\nChelsea topped Group E despite an atrocious showing in the Premier League so far. They won 4, drew once and lost once, scoring ten goals and conceding just 4. It’s an impressive record for a team that’s clearly using Europe as a distraction from domestic tribulations.\nAC Milan, who are also experiencing a torrid time domestically as they seek to defend their Serie A title, joined them in qualifying for the last 16.\nNaturally, current Champions League holders Real Madrid eased their way into the last 16, although it was perhaps a surprise that they only topped Group F by one point in the end. Despite a few big results along the way, including a 5-1 demolition of Celtic, Los Blancos were beaten 3-2 away at RB Leipzig, who came second.\nPre-tournament favourites Manchester City led the way in Group G, finishing with 14 points and recording zero defeats. Benfica and PSG also qualified with zero defeats in Group H, although it probably surprised many that Benfica topped this group – despite PSG slapping Maccabi Haifa 7-2 in the final game.\nLiverpool will be the team that are most relieved to have qualified at this point. After suffering horrendously at the hands of an inspired Napoli side in their opening match, they were thankful that they were in a group with a woeful Rangers side and a newly-managed Ajax side, who are seriously struggling for form this season.\nBoth sides provided cannon fodder for Jurgen Klopp’s men and the Reds went through with 12 points.\nRelated: Best Bingo Sites in the UK\n>> Latest Champions League odds\nChampions League Betting Odds: UEFA Champions League Predictions 2022-23\nMan City (9/4)\nMan City added the firepower of Erling Haaland in the summer to seemingly complete Pep Guardiola’s dream team.\nYet despite the Norwegian hitman bagging a staggering 25 goals by the end of January in the Premier League alone, things haven’t worked out exactly according to Pep’s masterplan.\nThe City manager has had to make a number of tactical changes to accommodate Haaland, even lining up the sale of right-back Joao Cancelo, so formidable to his team over the last few years, because he no longer suits City’s game plan this season.\nWhat’s more, despite being the favourites practically every year since Pep took over, City have yet to win the elusive Champions League. They choked last season at the Bernabeu, when they were just two minutes away from a place in the final.\nWe think both their winners and Champions League final odds are too short – and if you back them, you may have to rely on Haaland pushing your City bet settlement in your favour.\nBet on Man City (9/4) at LuckLand.\nBayern Munich (3.5/1)\nSince returning from the winter pause, Bayern Munich have played three league games – and drawn three league games. They’ve scored three and conceded three.\nMissing Lewandowski much?\nMaybe that’s harsh. After all, this Bayern team put 6 past Mainz, 6 past Werder Bremen and 5 past Freiburg in the space of four weeks at one point.\nBut the goals have dried up since Sadio Mane’s injury. The good news is that Mane is expected to be fit in time for the resumption of the Champions League. He’ll slot back into a fast-paced Bayern attack that also includes the tricky Kingsley Coman, wing wizard Leroy Sane and the devastatingly fast Alfonso Davies.\nHe’ll also be joined by new signing Joao Cancelo from City, who’ll add strength down the right.\nWe like the look of Bayern Munich – who recorded a 100% group record, playing 6 and winning 6 – to start scoring a pile of goals again soon.\nBet on Bayern Munich at 3.5/1 at Grosvenor Casino.\nReal Madrid (7/1)\nIt seems crazy to us that current holders Real Madrid are available at an astonishing 12/1.\nSurely that’s too good to ignore when thinking of Champions League winners?\nAfter all, this is the side – coached by the wily Carlo Ancelotti who knows what it takes to win the big trophies – that has won the Champions League four times in the last seven years.\nWhat’s more, their squad has largely been the same for the last few years. Luca Modric is still pulling the strings in midfield and Karim Benzema is still banging in the goals.\nThe big question is how long this Real Madrid team can keep their incredible run going. Can they pull off another miracle like last season, when they snatched victory from the jaws of defeat against Man City?\nIt’s asking a lot – but when predicting Champions League winners 12/1 is an incredible price.\nBet on Real Madrid (7/1) at 888 Sport.\nParis Saint Germain (6/1)\nPSG are in the same Champions League oasis as Man City. Their owners took over with the aim of dominating Europe. But after eleven years, Qatar Sports Investment are still looking for their first UEFA Champions League title.\nTheir fantasy football attacking line-up is scarily good and probably won’t ever be this good again. The triumvirate of World Cup winner Lionel Messi, World Cup runner-up Kylian Mbappe and Neymar should be too hot to handle for any team on their day.\nBut that’s always the thing with PSG – they’re not always “on their day.”\nIn fact, since they returned after the World Cup, PSG have hit the meltdown button. They lost to their title rivals Lens 3-1, they lost to Rennes 1-0 and then they drew with Rennes 1-1.\nBut Europe is what matters most right now. Is it finally PSG’s year?\nWe think 6/1 is an excellent price that will only get shorter.\nBet on Paris Saint Germain at 6/1 at Leo Vegas today.\nRelated: Best Online Casino Apps\nLiverpool (8/1)\nThe straight facts are simple: Liverpool are in woeful shape at the moment. Their January record includes league defeats against Brentford (3-1) and Brighton (3-0) and a fourth round FA cup exit at the hands of the Seagulls (2-1).\nSo it’s probably ironic that the Reds are faring quite well in Europe.\nAn early away day disaster at Napoli, when the Italian side pumped four goals past Alison, was soon forgotten, with Liverpool going on to pick up 12 points in their group. They also got their revenge on Napoli with a smart 2-0 win at Anfield in the final group game.\nWe actually like the look of Liverpool to forget their domestic trials and fare well in the Champions League now that the serious stuff has started.\nTheir biggest problem is that they face current holders Real Madrid in the round of 16. If they can overcome the 14-time champions, a miracle could happen.\nBet on Liverpool (8/1) at Mr Play Sport.\nReal Madrid (12/1)\nIt seems crazy to us that current holders Real Madrid are available at an astonishing 12/1.\nSurely that’s too good to ignore?\nAfter all, this is the side – coached by the wily Carlo Ancelotti who knows what it takes to win the big trophies – that has won the Champions League four times in the last seven years.\nWhat’s more, their squad has largely been the same for the last few years. Luca Modric is still pulling the strings in midfield and Karim Benzema is still banging in the goals.\nThe big question is how long this Real Madrid team can keep their incredible run going. Can they pull off another miracle like last season, when they snatched victory from the jaws of defeat against Man City?\nIt’s asking a lot – but 12/1 is an incredible price.\nBet on Real Madrid (12/1) at 888 Sport.\nUEFA Champions League Betting Odds: Quarter Final Predictions\nWe’ve now entered the Champions League round of 16, which starts on Tuesday 14 February. There are 8 match-ups, with each match consisting of two legs – a home leg and an away leg.\nIn this section, our football betting experts share their tips on each contest:\nLiverpool vs Real Madrid\nThis is a repeat of the Champions League 2021/22 final – but what a difference less than a year makes!\nThese two footballing giants are now so far apart in terms of quality, form and morale that it’s hard to anticipate anything other than a Real Madrid victory over two legs.\nThis is further emphasised by the fact that, despite trailing Barcelona in La Liga, Real Madrid are the European experts.\n“But aren’t Liverpool European experts, too?”\nThat’s true – which is why we predict Liverpool will fight and will score a few goals … and they may even qualify over two legs.\nExpert tip: Bet on Real Madrid to score an away goal at Anfield (2/7) at LuckLand.\nAC Milan vs Tottenham Hotspur\nSpurs manager Antonio Conte returns to Italy – and he couldn’t have timed it any better.\nAC Milan are the current Serie A champions. After spending years in the wilderness, they finally won their first league title for eleven years and their Champions League betting odds look better than they have in years.\nBut their current form is nothing short of horrendous. In 2023, they lost 2-5 at home to Sassuolo and 4-0 away at Lazio. They were also thrashed by Inter Milan in the cup.\nSpurs aren’t exactly in champion form themselves – but they certainly look more solid than AC Milan.\nExpert tip: Bet on Spurs to win away at AC Milan (11/5) at Grosvenor Casino.\nPSG vs Bayern Munich\nThis is easily the pick of the Champions League round of 16 ties, with the first leg taking place in Paris. The big shame is that this isn’t the final!\nIt’s impossible to call which team will make it through over the two legs, with bookies pricing PSG at 5/4 to win at home, and Bayern at 15/8 to win in Paris.\nBayern will be aided by the return of Sadio Mane, as well as the recent addition of Joao Cancelo.\nBut PSG are desperate to land the one trophy that still eludes them.\nExpert tip: Bet on both teams to score in the first leg (2/5) at Leo Vegas.\nBorussia Dortmund vs Chelsea\nIn any given year, you’d say this is a terrible round of 16 tie for Borussia Dortmund. But they were always going to finish behind Man City in Group G – and drawing Chelsea as group runners-up isn’t actually that bad in the current climate.\nIndeed, things are – shall we say – not right at Chelsea at the moment. Fans don’t trust Graham Potter, while the board have been spending erratically throughout January.\nWill the new players fit into Potter’s system for UEFA Champions League 2022-23?\nWell, Potter doesn’t really have a system.\nWhat’s more, Dortmund will be buoyed by the return of striker Sebastien Haller.\nExpert tip: Bet on Borussia Dortmund to win the first leg (29/20) at Mr Play Sport.\nClub Brugge vs Benfica\nSurprise package Club Brugge have made it this far and the draw was massively kind to them when Benfica were picked out as their opponents.\nClub Brugge made it out of a group that included serial Champions League experts Atletico Madrid – but their league form has been nothing short of disastrous of late.\nBenfica, on the other hand, have a high-quality team at the moment and topped Group H – a thorny group that included PSG and Juventus.\nIt was a remarkable achievement and we see their run continuing, making a bet on Benfica one of our lock Champions League predictions.\nExpert tip: Bet on Benfica over 1.5 goals in the first leg (4/5) at 888 Sport.\nEintracht Frankfurt vs Napoli\nThere’s no doubt that Napoli are the form team in Europe right now. They went undefeated in January, with their eye-catching 5-1 destruction of Juventus the pick of their results.\nThe Italians are charging towards their first Serie A title since 1990 and have opened up a 13-point lead over nearest challengers Inter Milan.\nEintracht Frankfurt are no mugs, of course. They qualified for the Champions League by winning the UEFA Europa League and they’re having a solid Bundesliga season.\nBut their 7 goals scored in the group stages was the lowest recorded by any of the remaining 16 teams – and it contrasts with Napoli, who with 20 goals, recorded the most goals.\nWith two teams really in form, one of our best UEFA Champions League predictions is both teams scoring in the first leg.\nExpert tip: Bet on both teams to score in the first leg (1/2) at BetUK.\nInter Milan vs FC Porto\nFC Porto are one of those niggling European teams that no one really wants to face. They’re always capable of causing an upset (just ask Juventus two years ago) – and facing Inter Milan certainly will not daunt the Portuguese outfit.\nIn fact, Inter will be going into this match with a few reservations. Yes, they did well to see off Barcelona’s challenge and get out of Group C but they lost twice against Bayern Munich.\nWhat’s more, Inter’s Serie A form has been patchy. Yes, they’re second in the table – but they’re only 3 points above sixth-placed Roma making their Champions League final odds look grim.\nIf they’re to get past Porto over two legs, they’ll need top scorer Lautaro Martinez to be firing.\nExpert tip: Bet on under 2.5 goals in the first leg (10/11) at Kwiff.\nRB Leipzig v Man City\nMan City’s prize for winning Group G is a last 16 meeting with RB Leipzig.\nNot exactly a prize, is it?\nRB Leipzig are a real danger team who still have a chance of winning the Bundesliga. They recently re-signed forward Timo Werner, who’s since rediscovered his goalscoring form.\nThey have extra attacking quality in the likes of Andre Silva and Dani Olmo, and Pep will not be taking the German’s lightly.\nThat all said, regarding Champion League betting Man City are the heavy favourites here – and for good reason. They’re arguably one of the top two best teams in Europe right now and pretty much no defense is a match for Erling Haaland.\nExpert tip: Bet on Man City over 1.5 goals in the first leg (4/6) at Luckster.\nRelated: Best 3 Card Poker Online\nGet a Bonus for Betting on the UEFA Champions League at LuckLand\nNEW CUSTOMERS ONLY.
