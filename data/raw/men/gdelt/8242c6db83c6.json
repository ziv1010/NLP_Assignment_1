  "body_text": "Wednesday night in the Conti Cup proved to be a significant evening for two of our longest-standing players.\nAfter a long nine months on the sidelines, Leah Williamson returned to the pitch to complete her ACL recovery and captain Kim Little earned her 300th appearance for the club.\n\"It was the perfect scenario,\" said Williamson, after the full-time whistle. \"I've worked hard. I've kept my head down for a moment like today. I sat on the bench with my teammates who couldn't have been more supportive and then returned to the pitch. The girls gave me a good reception and so did the fans, so it was lovely.\"\n\"I couldn't be prouder of this one,\" Little added. \"She's worked extremely hard - you've probably all seen that - and then she comes back in like she's never been away. I can't wait to get back on the pitch with [Leah] more often.\"\nAs for Captain Little's prestigious honour of 300 games at the club - only the sixth player to have reached this milestone in our history - it inspired some reminiscing about an early game against Chelsea at Emirates Stadium where she scored her very first Arsenal goal.\n\"It was a little tap-in at the Emirates. That was what...2008? That's a long time ago. That was fifteen years ago!\"\n\"I think I was a mascot for that game. Just to make you feel a little bit older!\" revealed our number 6.\n\"You were there from the start for me, so I'm glad that I got to do this moment with you,\" Williamson continued. \"To play with Kim, even back then, they were talking about her in the same way that we talk about her now. To have been that consistent for that long, for one club and be loyal, I think that's something that shouldn't go unnoticed.\n\"No one in this squad is even close to it, because it takes a certain type of person. This is about you.\"\nThis long-awaited return precipitated plenty more trips down memory lane for the pair, including a reflection on the growth they've witnessed on the sidelines.\n\"I think this is a good time to tell this story! [Kim and I] sat together at Wolfsburg last year when the Emirates was sold out for the Champions League semi-final. We're both fairly level people but we were both emotional because we felt so proud that the club was in that position.\n\"But it was sad that we missed a lot of football between the two of us. So to be back in a place where we can be on the pitch as well to enjoy that moment from a different perspective, it feels like we've done our time. And now we're in a good position for the rest of the season. So I can't wait.\"\n\"Yeah, Leah's right,\" said Little. \"Last year at Wolfsburg, we both got injuries later in the season. And for people who've been at the club for a long time. I can remember playing at the Emirates in front of 5,000 people so for me, those moments are special.\n\"Now that Leah's back on the pitch as well, to be able to share it with people who've been here a long time and I've been through that whole journey with, as well as the new players is pretty special. We're incredibly proud to represent this club and can't wait to see what we can do for the rest of the season.\"\nTo hear more from Leah and Kim, click the play button above.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
