  "body_text": "The reliable David Ornstein has revealed that Napoli striker Victor Osimhen is not a player Manchester United are pursuing ahead of the summer transfer window.\nUnited are eyeing reinforcements in the striker position amidst Rasmus Hojlund’s struggles and Osimhen’s name has repeatedly popped up.\nThe Nigerian is currently on loan at Galatasaray but he hasn’t missed a beat, scoring an impressive 21 goals and providing an additional four assists in 25 Super League matches. Osimhen has plundered 30 goals in 35 games across all competitions.\nThe 26-year-old’s time at Napoli appears to be over, especially after his failed attempt to engineer a move last summer. This time around, a departure seems inevitable.\nIn addition to United, the 26-year-old has also been linked with Arsenal, Chelsea, and Paris Saint-Germain. However, in recent weeks, speculation surrounding a potential move to the Red Devils has intensified.\nA report from Turkey suggested that United have reached an agreement on personal terms with the player’s representatives. It was later claimed that Napoli and Ruben Amorim’s side also agreed on the terms of a transfer to Old Trafford.\nOrnstein has now set the record straight, insisting these reports are wide off the mark. In fact, Ornstein explains that Osimhen is unlikely to join United in the summer.\nSpeaking on NBC Sports, Osimhen said, “The priority for Manchester United in this upcoming transfer window is attack. They’re looking at a centre forward and a No. 10 as their main focus and they want to get on with it pretty quickly. The finances are in place, as I understand it, to do the deals they would like to do. They do not depend on European football, I’m told, nor on sales to necessitate them.”\n“Their main focus for the No. 10 position is Matheus Cunha. He wants to come but personal terms still need to be agreed, which is not a formality. Let’s see if other clubs come in for him but there is optimism at Old Trafford that they can land him. They have alternatives – the likes of Antoine Semenyo and Tyler Dibling. But Cunha is the one they’re focusing on. It’s not close yet but I could see this one developing rapidly.”\n“In the striker position, it’s Liam Delap of Ipswich Town as their target. He has a £30m release clause if Ipswich are relegated but they’re also a lot of other suitors for him, including Chelsea, so there’s not guarantee that will happen.”\n“I think Delap will decide before the U21 European Championship on where he wants to go. If United want to look at others, I’m assured it will not be Victor Osimhen, despite reports that you might be reading.”\n“He is not on the agenda for United. They will have other options because they might have to, or they’ll stick to internal solutions like Rasmus Hojlund and focus on other positions. Those positions may be more dependent on sales – the likes of Marcus Rashford. Aston Villa have an option to buy him, let’s see if they get into the Champions League and whether they are the proposition he wants to join and also if they can afford him.”\nOrnstein also noted that Rashford could potentially seek a move elsewhere, particularly given his long-standing interest in playing in La Liga – most notably in the colours of Barcelona.\nThe Athletic journalist noted that Rashford’s departure alongside others such as Jadon Sancho, Casemiro, Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Hojlund, Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof could raise a lot of money for United that they could reinvest on bringing in fresh players.\nPremier League insider @David_Ornstein shares the latest on Arsenal and Manchester United as the summer transfer window gets closer. pic.twitter.com/h8CkzphZjX\n— NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) April 23, 2025\nOrnstein’s latest update will no doubt come as a blow to a section of United fans, many of whom have been vocal in their desire to see a striker of Osimhen’s calibre arrive at Old Trafford. Proven goal-scorers of his quality are a rare commodity, and his profile fits exactly what the club has been lacking up front.\nShould United secure Champions League qualification by winning the Europa League, they’ll hopefully reignite their pursuit of Osimhen. The added prestige and financial boost could put them in a stronger position to lure the prolific striker to their ranks.\nFeatured image Ahmad Mora via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
