  "body_text": "Arsenal have no plans of registering Gabriel Jesus for the league phase of the Champions League despite an ankle injury sustained by Cristhian Mosquera.\nMosquera suffered the setback against Brentford at the Emirates Stadium this month, and it has been reported that he could be out for six to eight weeks.\nManager Mikel Arteta has also confirmed that the £31 million-rated Spanish star will be sidelined for ‘weeks‘ after the unfortunate injury against the Bees.\nDespite this, the Gunners are not looking to register Jesus in place of Mosquera in their Champions League squad, as per football.london journalist Tom Canton.\nUEFA permit the replacement of one outfield player with a long-term injury or illness before matchday 6.\nChelsea have already exercised the option with Facundo Bounanotte taking Dario Essugo’s place, while Liverpool attacker Federico Chiesa has replaced Giovanni Leoni.\nWith a potential eight-week absence, Mosquera won’t return until the league phase concludes, but Arsenal have opted against requesting UEFA for a change, as things stand.\nJesus is close to a return to first-team action with the Gunners after a long-term knee injury lay-off, but he won’t play any part during the league phase of the Champions League.\nThe Gunners can, of course, make three changes to the A-List squad in early February.\nThe London giants submitted a 23-man A-List squad for the league phase last summer. They are permitted a maximum of 25, and Jesus could be registered for the knock-outs.\nJesus has been regularly linked with a mid-season move away from Arsenal, but the Brazil international recently said that it makes ‘no sense’ to leave the club after his lengthy absence.\nThe 28-year-old added that he would only part ways with Arsenal to return to Palmeiras in future.\nArsenal host bottom-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League after facing Club Brugge in Europe tomorrow. Jesus could make his first appearance since January on Saturday.\nStats from Transfermarkt.com",
