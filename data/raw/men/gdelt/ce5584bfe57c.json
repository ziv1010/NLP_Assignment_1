Milan have turned to serial winner Allegri in their hour of need following the expected sacking of Sergio Conceicao, who leaves the San Siro club after five miserable months in charge.\nMilan did not reveal details of the deal but Italian media widely report that Allegri has signed a two-year contract worth five million euros a season, with the option to extend for a further two years. Allegri has become the fourth coach in a year for Milan, who finished this past Serie A season in eighth place and missed out on European football for next term.\nThe 57-year-old led Milan to the 2011 Scudetto in his first stint in charge, between 2010 and 2014, and he was their coach for one of the most infamous episodes in recent Serie A history. Milan were beating Juventus, rivals for the 2012 league title, 1-0 in February that year when a Sulley Muntari goal was not given despite the ball clearly crossing the line.\nJuve went on to draw that game 1-1 and then win their first title in nine years -- finishing the campaign unbeaten -- and two years later hired Allegri who then won Serie A five more times in his two spells with the Turin giants.\nAllegri had been on hiatus since being sacked by Juve in May last year, his final act there being a post-match rampage after winning the Italian Cup in which he railed at officials and sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli.\nConceicao, a former Inter Milan and Lazio player, was hired in late December in place of his countryman Paulo Fonseca on a contract until next year. The 50-year-old began in positive fashion at Milan by winning the Italian Super Cup in January, but he failed to claim a Champions League spot for a talented but inconsistent team that also lost the Italian Cup final to Bologna earlier this month.\nConceciao, 50, won 16 of 31 games in charge at Milan, including 11 victories, seven losses and three draws in the league and also had to deal with vociferous protests from supporters against the club´s American owners RedBird.\nFans demonstrated in large numbers outside Milan´s headquarters ahead of their team´s final match of the season, a dead-rubber against relegated Monza last weekend. That protest was a culmination of months of visible anger from supporters who have watched Milan slide down the league after Stefano Pioli took them to second place in 2023/24.\nFor months matches have been punctuated by loud calls for owner Gerry Cardinale, the founder of investment fund RedBird, to sell the club as fans watched Inter battle for the Serie A title and arrive at this weekend´s Champions League final.\nAlso looking for a new coach are Roma after Claudio Ranieri retired for the second time in the space of a year, with Gian Piero Gasperini reported to be the capital club´s prime target. Meanwhile even Simone Inzaghi had to play down reports of a mega-money move to Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia, rumours which arrived out of the blue ahead of Inter Milan´s Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain.\n-\nMichelle Obama Gets Candid About Spontaneous Decision At Piercings Tattoo\n-\nBunnie Xo Shares Raw Confession After Year-long IVF Struggle\n-\nBrooks Nader Reveals Why She Quit Fillers After Years\n-\nTravis Kelce Plays Key Role In Taylor Swift's 'Opalite' Remix\n-\nHow Jennifer Aniston's 57th Birthday Went With Boyfriend Jim Curtis\n-\nJoJo Siwa Shares Inspiring Words With Young Changemakers\n-\nJames Van Der Beek Loved Ones Breaks Silence After Fundraiser Hits $2.2M\n-\nDisney’s $336m 'Snow White' Remake Ends With $170m Box Office Loss: Report\n-\nTravis Kelce's Mom Donna Kelce Breaks Silence On His Retirement Plans\n-\nPremiere Date Of 'Spider-Noir' Featuring Nicolas Cage Announced\n-\nPedro Pascal's Sister Reveals His Reaction To Her 'The Beauty' Role\n-\nKate Middleton Proves She's True 'children's Princess' With THIS Move\n-\nPaul Anka Reveals How He Raised Son Ethan Differently From His Daughters\n-\n'A Very Special Visitor' Meets Queen Camilla At Clarence House\n-\nJodie Turner Smith Shares One Strict Rule She Follows As A Mom\n-\nHailey Bieber Reveals KEY To Balancing Motherhood With Career",
