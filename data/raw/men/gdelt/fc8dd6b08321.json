  "body_text": "Go Ahead Eagles put out PSV, reach cup final for second time\nDeventer football club Go Ahead Eagles have reached the finals of the KNVB Cup for the second time in their history, beating favourites PSV Eindhoven 2-1 on Wednesday night.\nGo Ahead scored twice in quick succession in the first half, with goals from Gerrit Nauber and Victor Edvardsen. It was not until the second half that PSV pulled one back with a penalty.\nThe only other time the club, currently seventh in the league, reached the final was in 1965 when they lost to Feyenoord. They will face the winner of Thursday night’s second semi-final between Heracles and AZ on April 21 at De Kuip stadium in Rotterdam.\nThe defeat is another blow to PSV, who had seemed assured of the league title earlier in the season but are now five points behind Ajax, who still have a game in hand.\nPSV did, however, secure a surprise win against Juventus in the Champions League last week to qualify for the round of 16.\nThank you for donating to DutchNews.nl.\nWe could not provide the Dutch News service, and keep it free of charge, without the generous support of our readers.
