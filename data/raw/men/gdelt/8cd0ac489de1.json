  "body_text": "Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy says new financial fair play rules will hamstring the spending power of clubs like Chelsea, while he ‘feels sick’ seeing Arsenal at the top of the Premier League table.\nUnder their new ownership, Chelsea have spent around £600million on transfers in the past year and have got around spending rules by amortising the fees over the duration of longer contracts, with a number of signings handed deals as long as eight-and-a-half years.\nBut UEFA are set to remove that loophole ahead of the summer window by limiting the length of contracts, and Levy believes those changes and others will have a significant impact on the way clubs operate.\n‘Well firstly there are new rules coming into effect this season, UEFA rules, where sustainability is going to become much more paramount in people’s minds,’ said the Spurs chief in an interview with Cambridge Union that was recorded on March 14.\n‘So you’ll be limited in the amount you can spend on wages and transfer fees, effectively the amortisation element, as a percentage of your total turnover.\n‘So starting off at 90% and over three years it is going down to 70%. The impact of that is effectively some form of wage control.\n‘So I think even though clubs have been spending very heavily – and you talk about someone like Chelsea – now the new rules come into effect this summer, I think you’ll find that, regardless of who is the owner, it’s going to have quite an impact on the financing of football.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nLevy has been chairman of Tottenham for the past 22 years and has overseen enormous growth off the pitch – including the development of a state-of-the-art new stadium and training complex – but has only delivered one trophy, the League Cup in 2008.\nHe has now defended Spurs’ record under his stewardship and insists winning silverware is his ultimate aim, though he is not enjoying seeing Arsenal enjoy such a stellar season at the top of the table – though was quick to remind everyone that Tottenham have not finished below their north London rivals since the 2015-16 season.\n‘We had a meeting a couple of weeks ago with all our staff – we have about 750 staff in Tottenham – we brought everyone together and put up a big picture with lots of trophies in it,’ said Levy.\n‘And it is about winning, but winning depending on the moment in time you ask that question to various people means different things.\nMore Trending\n‘So when we first came into Tottenham, winning was making sure we stayed in the Premier League. And then as time goes on and we got more successful it was about getting into the Europa League, getting into the Champions League.\n‘And obviously the ultimate [goal] is to win the trophies. That is clearly what we are trying to do. It’s easier said than done.\n‘Am I happy that we haven’t won more than one trophy in the last 15 years? Absolutely not. But I also think that we’ve had some fantastic times, we’ve been in the Champions League a number of times.\n‘And despite the fact that I feel sick that there’s a club in north London that’s a bit higher than us at this moment in time, if I look back over the last five years we’ve also been above them. So that’s what happens.’\nMORE: Daniel Levy insists Harry Kane can win a trophy at Tottenham amid Manchester United transfer link\nMORE: Chelsea star ‘disillusioned’ after being singled out by Todd Boehly in dressing room speech\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
