Los Blancos are at the top of the Spanish league table and could also progress to the Round of 16 in Europe’s premier club competition without going through the playoffs.\nDespite Madrid having a very good attacking unit that includes Jude Bellingham, Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior, they are keen on adding Florian Wirtz to their squad.\nWirtz is one of the best attacking midfielders in Europe and has been in fine form for Bayer Leverkusen.\nThe 21-year-old Germany international playmaker has scored 14 goals and given 11 assists in 30 matches in all competitions this season.\nArsenal are among the clubs who have been linked with Wirtz, with a report in the English media on December 31 claiming that the Gunners will be in the market for the youngster “once the Germany attacker decides to leave”.\nWirtz is Bayer’s prized asset and the defending Bundesliga champions will not sell him for anything less than €120million (£100.7m / $125m), which, according to Defensa Central, is too much for Madrid.\nThat is the reason why Los Blancos are looking at alternatives, and one of them is AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders, who will cost half of what Madrid will have to pay for Wirtz.\nReijnders is 26 now and is more versatile than Wirtz, with the Netherlands international able to play in defensive midfield as well as in a more attacking role.\nREAD MORE 🔴 Five reasons for Trent Alexander-Arnold to stay at Liverpool vs five reasons to leave for Real Madrid\nReal Madrid stance on Wirtz a boost for Liverpool too\nWith Madrid looking at cheaper alternatives for Wirtz, Liverpool will feel more confident of getting a deal done for the playmaker.\nThere have been reports in the Spanish press that the Reds have already been in contact with the youngster’s entourage about a possible deal.\nManchester City and Chelsea are also keeping tabs on Wirtz, who is a regular for the Germany national team.\nIt remains to be seen if any of the Premier League clubs would be willing to pay £100m for the 21-year-old.\nLatest Real Madrid news: Alexander-Arnold blow, Tonali interest\nOne of the players that Madrid have long wanted to sign is Trent Alexander-Arnold. The right-back is out of contract at Liverpool at the end of the season.\nWhile Liverpool are trying to convince Alexander-Arnold to sign a new contract and extend his stay at Anfield, Madrid are keen on bringing him to the Santiago Bernabeu in the January transfer window or as a free agent in the summer of 2025.\nWith Madrid having injury problems at right-back, head coach Carlo Ancelotti would love to sign Alexander-Arnold now.\nHowever, with Liverpool adamant that they will not sell the England international in January and the player himself not pushing for a move in the middle of the season, Madrid are getting annoyed and have now made initial contact with Joshua Kimmich.\nKimmich, who can play as a right-back or midfielder, is out of contract at Bayern Munich at the end of the season.\nAnother Premier League-based player that Madrid have been linked with is Newcastle United midfielder Sandro Tonali.\nItalian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio has reported that the Spanish and European giants could make a move for the Italy international midfielder in the summer of 2025.\nDi Marzio has suggested that defending Premier League champions Manchester City could try to sign Tonali too, adding that the midfielder will leave Newcastle at the end of the season.\nMadrid are also looking at a Valencia centre-back for the long term. Yarek Gasiorowski has emerged as one of the best young players in La Liga this season, and Los Blancos are keen on a summer deal for him.\nReports have claimed that Arsenal are interested in Gasiorowski as well.",
