  "body_text": "Real Madrid ready to wreck Liverpool and Newcastle plans over Europe’s most fearsome winger\nReal Madrid have two blockbuster attacking signings in mind and one would play havoc with the plans of Liverpool and Newcastle, per a report.\nLos Blancos have already scooped two trophies this season – the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup. However, all is not well at the Bernabeu on the domestic front.\nReal Madrid sit a hefty 11 points behind bitter rivals Barcelona in LaLiga. Xavi’s side sunk Real in the final of the Spanish Super Cup and the pair have drawn each other in the semi-finals of the Cope Del Rey.\nWith tensions heightened, a report out of Spain has claimed Real intend to re-establish themselves at the head of Spanish football through making two blockbuster transfers.\nThe first involves PSG and France icon, Kylian Mbappe. However, it’s the second that’ll be of greater interest to Liverpool and Newcastle fans.\nVia Football Espana, it’s stated Real Madrid are lining up a move for Napoli phenom, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.\nThe Georgian counts the Reds and Magpies among his suitors. The latest on Newcastle’s audacious chase was detailed here.\nHow long can Napoli retain Kvaratskhelia?\nLiverpool, meanwhile, learned just how exceptional the 22-year-old Kvaratskhelia is first-hand in the Champions League Group Stage.\nKvaratskhelia provided an assist and was a veritable livewire in the 4-1 thumping of Liverpool back in September.\nThe left winger has amassed an incredible 25 goals in just 23 matches across all competitions this year. That includes seven contributions in five matches in the tougher Champions League.\nLiverpool are known to have placed the fearsome forward on their watchlist, though so too have Real Madrid.\nA move to the Bernabeu ‘over the next couple’ of windows is deemed possible. Napoli will be understandably reluctant to part ways with such an influential star, though money can and often does talk in the end.\nOn that front, it’s claimed his current valuation is around €80m (approx. £71m).\nNewcastle need signing more than Liverpool\nOf the English pair, Newcastle’s need for Kvaratskhelia is unquestionably greater.\nJurgen Klopp can already call upon Luis Diaz for his left side who is the de facto replacement for Sadio Mane. Furthermore, Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo can both operate comfortably on the left.\nEddie Howe, meanwhile, has deployed Allan Saint-Maximin in the position of late.\nHowever, the maverick Frenchman has struggled with injuries this year and his modest return of 13 goals and 19 assists in 112 matches for the Magpies pales in comparison to the numbers Kvaratskhelia is putting up.\nIf Newcastle are to establish themselves as a regular UCL contender, signings the calibre of Kvaratskhelia will eventually have to be made.\nOne interesting point to note regarding Kvaratskhelia’s future stems from recent comments by his agent.\nVia Fabrizio Romano, the player’s agent confirmed there’s mass interest in his client, though insisted he won’t join another Italian side in the event he leaves Napoli.\n“There’s lot of interest from many clubs but he’s only focused on Napoli — he loves the club and the city, he won’t join any other Italian club,” he told CalcioNapoli24.\nEURO PAPER TALK: Unthinkable Man Utd exit emerges with ‘almost everything agreed’; Chelsea discussing £71m LaLiga transfer",
