  "body_text": "Tottenham Hotspur\nPremier League • England\nGlenn Hoddle opens up on Conte future and urges Daniel Levy to make right call over successor\nGlenn Hoddle feels Antonio Conte has worked wonders to keep Tottenham in the top four and believes he should stay until the end of the season.\nConte is under severe pressure at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after a tough season on and off the pitch. He recently missed several games while undergoing surgery but is now back on the touchline. However, the Italian tactician will probably wish he had still been absent from Saturday’s 3-3 draw at Southampton.\nHaving taken a 1-0 and 3-1 lead, Spurs were pegged back to 3-3 at the final whistle. James Ward-Prowse buried a penalty deep into stoppage time to earn the south-coast outfit a point.\nThe result means Spurs are still in the top four but just two points better off than Newcastle United. The Magpies have two games in hand and appear to be finding form at just the right time.\nConte has been tipped to leave at the end of the season although a few pundits feel he should go now.\nAnd Saturday’s amazing post-match tirade at his players has done little to smooth the waters. It would be no surprise if the club took matters into their own hands.\nFormer Spurs chief Hoddle is convinced the ex-Chelsea boss will go but feels it would be counterproductive to get rid of him now.\n“I think he will leave, yes at the end of the season but I don’t see any advantage at this moment in time in getting anyone in,” he told BT Sport.\n“It would have to be for the long term. I think they have to look at the long term at the end of the season. If they bring somebody in now it may just not work.”\nHoddle praise for ‘professional’ Conte job\nTottenham are a club renowned for their attacking football. Therefore eyebrows were raised when they employed a coach known for his defensive prowess.\nHowever, Hoddle feels Conte should be applauded for his tactics that have managed to keep the club in Champions League contention.\n“This group of players, they have some good players, Tottenham but he has done miracles to get them into the top four and keep them in the top four this season,” added the former England manager.\n“If they play the open football that I think a lot of the Spurs fans are asking for, this team would be eighth in the league.\n“I can tell you that now, so he has done a really good job on a professional point of view. “\nHoddle trusts Levy to deliver success\nAll eyes will now be on Daniel Levy and whether he pulls the trigger before the end of May.\nNames such as ex-Spurs chief Mauricio Pochettino and Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi have been mentioned as possible successors.\nAnd Hoddle is convinced that the next man in the Tottenham hotseat will put the club back on track.\n“It is not the way that Spurs fans want to see the game played,” he continued.\n“Daniel Levy will be looking at what I need to be for the top four and he is going to give us the best chance. We’ll deal with next year, next year.”",
