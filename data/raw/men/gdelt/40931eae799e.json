  "body_text": "German clubs see Club World Cup as crucial test ahead of 2026 FIFA World Cup\nBy Oliver Trust\nBERLIN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The outcome of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup carries significant implications for German football, with Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund both involved in high-stakes quarterfinals.\nBayern faces Paris Saint-Germain, while Dortmund takes on Real Madrid in all-European clashes. But beyond the continental power duels, matches against opponents from Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Arab world are offering valuable insights into global football trends.\n\"Looking ahead to the 2026 World Cup, we need to pay close attention to the level of quality from teams on these continents,\" said Michael Rummenigge, a former striker for Bayern and Dortmund and the brother of Bayern board member Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.\nDespite initial European skepticism, Rummenigge said the tournament is gaining global traction. He emphasized that the Club World Cup offers vital lessons for clubs as they prepare for next season's Bundesliga and UEFA Champions League campaigns.\n\"Progressing to the next round enhances the international reputation of the Bundesliga,\" added the three-time German title winner.\nDortmund coach Niko Kovac noted that South American and European teams are dominating the competition but stressed the importance of intercontinental matchups.\n\"It's vital for European teams to play against the best from other continents,\" said Kovac. \"European fans and clubs are beginning to realize that South American teams, and their supporters, approach this tournament very differently.\"\nKovac also sees broader value in the tournament, particularly in preparing European national teams for the 2026 World Cup in terms of travel demands, climate adaptation and logistical planning.\nBayern manager Vincent Kompany echoed the sentiment, calling the exposure to diverse tactical systems and styles \"overwhelmingly interesting.\"\nThough both German sides may be viewed as underdogs against PSG and Real Madrid, Michael Rummenigge believes the experience will be invaluable. \"It would be priceless if both teams - or at least one - advance to the semifinals,\" he said.\nThe quarterfinals also reignite rivalries: while Bayern has bested PSG in recent duels, the French side claimed the 2025 Champions League title in Munich. Meanwhile, Real Madrid defeated Dortmund in the 2024 final.\n\"We may be the underdog, but with teamwork, we can cross the finish line,\" said Kovac.",
