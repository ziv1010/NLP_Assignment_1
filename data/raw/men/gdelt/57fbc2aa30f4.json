It looks like a first Champions League campaign for 20 years is imminent – and with that, big signings could be made.\nThe likes of Alexander Isak, Anthony Gordon and Bruno Guimaraes have already joined for big fees but with the influx of Champions League money, Newcastle United could have more breathing room from financial fair play laws, enabling them to spend even bigger in the upcoming transfer window.\nAccording to the Telegraph, Newcastle are targeting four \"elite signings\" this summer, with Declan Rice, Ivan Toney and James Maddison have all been mentioned as potential new recruits.\nRice is thought to be Arsenal's No.1 target this summer, with the Gunners looking for another midfielder. The Gunners are said to be confident of a deal according to TalkSport but given that they have refused to \"overpay\" for targets above what they value them to be worth, Newcastle could well swoop in sign the West Ham United star first – similarly to how Mikel Arteta missed out on Mykhaylo Mudryk.\nSimilarly, transfer guru Fabrizio Romano recently confirmed Tottenham are tracking James Maddison – and should the Magpies pip the Lilywhites to the post of Champions League football, it's likely that they will position themselves as the first-choice destination for the Leicester City playmaker.\n“Tottenham are monitoring James Maddison for sure, also Newcastle have his name on their list since last August as he’s always been appreciated,” Romano told Caught Offside.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nIvan Toney, however, may be the most fascinating link of the lot. The Brentford striker was released by Newcastle as a youngster and with the likes of Alexander Isak and Callum Wilson as first-choice No.9s, there isn't an obvious need for a new striker.\nNewcastle have also been linked with Arsenal star Kieran Tierney by the Telegraph.\nMore Newcastle United stories\nFormer Newcastle star Yohan Cabaye has told FFT he was \"surprised\" when Joe Kinnear called him \"Yohan Kebab\" live on radio – and why he went on strike at the Magpies.\nKieran Tierney is a major target for the Toon, while former Leeds star Raphinha is on the shortlist, too.\nIn other news, emails have revealed the UK Government's involvement in Newcastle United's Saudi takeover.\nMark White is the Digital Content Editor at FourFourTwo.
