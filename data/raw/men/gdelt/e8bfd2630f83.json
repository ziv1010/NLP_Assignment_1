  "body_text": "ANDONI Iraola says he is keen to approach his job at Cherries with an “open mind”, but has taken advice on board from the club’s former management duo Eddie Howe and Jason Tindall.\nDuring his sabbatical from management following his departure from Cherries in August 2020, club legend Howe visited various coaches to broaden his experience and knowledge.\nHe then brought that back into his role at Newcastle United in November 2021, where he has guided the Magpies into the Champions League, with Tindall as his assistant.\nOne of the clubs Howe visited during that spell was Rayo Vallecano in Madrid, Iraola’s old club.\nIraola was on Wednesday afternoon presented to the media for his first press conference since becoming Cherries boss last month.\nDiscussing the pair’s encounter in Spain, Iraola explained: “We were talking about the game generally, the approach they had especially against big teams here in the Premier League.\n“Sometimes we were talking about things he tried against Chelsea when they played with a back three and wing-backs.\n“We talked about how we faced them and just talked about football, nothing very detailed. Some exercises, some things that are probably different here than we do in Spain. But overall, talking about the game.”\nHe added: “That is very helpful, because I have to learn a lot of things.\n“In Spain, players probably are used to working one way, certain things we do differently. Here I have to learn as quick as I can.\n“The staff that was already working for the club will be very valuable for me. I have been working with them very closely, they are fantastic guys and they will help me a lot.\n“I spoke with Jason Tindall, he is here on holidays still. They (Newcastle) haven’t started training.\n“We talked a little bit about the club, the players, he knows the players very well.\n“But I also want to come here a little bit with an open mind. You want to have the information, but a lot of times not so much so you can also take your own decisions and look at the things for yourself.”\nAsked about Howe’s imprint on Cherries after the wonders he worked in taking them from League Two to the Premier League, Iraola added: “Everyone here talks about Eddie.\n“That’s a sign he did a lot of very, very good things here in Bournemouth.\n“I am happy that he has been very successful also now in Newcastle.\n\"But every coach has his own ideas.\n“There are some things we should maintain from the previous manager (Gary O’Neil) also and some things we will do our own way.”",
