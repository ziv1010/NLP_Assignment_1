I’m Emily Olsen, here with Meg Linehan and Steph Yang — welcome to Full Time!\nRest Day\nGet caught up on the ‘underdogs’\nObviously, this newsletter has a strong American influence, but I think we all need a break, and this rest day has come at the perfect time. There are so many other great stories I want to highlight before that U.S. game against Sweden (there is still plenty of time to talk about that one).\nAdvertisement\nParity has become a key feature in this expanded World Cup. Lopsided scores were also met with surprising victories — some of which came from first-time participants. More countries are investing in the women’s game and it’s showing: hello, Morocco, and, of course for a while now, the Netherlands. Meanwhile, other teams are winning despite their federations — taking a page from the USWNT handbook.\nThese results haven’t been freak accidents, but well-practiced and prepared performances that happened while you weren’t watching. So, it’s not their fault if you’re caught by surprise, but it is our job to fill you in…\nTamerra Griffin looked at Nigeria and where its round of 16 ticket came from:\n- Despite fumbling their last international competition at the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, the team has been steadily building ever since.\n- Unbeaten in their group-stage matches, against teams ranked significantly higher than them, they finished second in their group behind Australia.\n- Their players are with clubs like Racing Louisville, Wuhan Chegu Jianghan in the Chinese Women’s Super League and beyond. Then there’s Barcelona’s Asisat Oshoala, who became the first African woman to win a Champions League title in 2021 before adding a second last season.\n“Let’s not get lost in the respectability politics of glitzy club teams and individual awards,” Tamerra says, “Nigeria can ball, period, and they’ve shown tens of thousands of fans not only what they are capable of, but what they can do against rankings’ odds.”\nJamaica and South Africa, like Nigeria, have had to play this game with the backdrop of a federation that is unresponsive at best, and harmful at worst. As Nick Miller writes, “If there’s a message for the national federations of those three countries it’s this: don’t you dare try taking credit for their success.”\n- What else? Nigeria, Jamaica and South Africa’s success owes nothing to those who failed them\n- And also: Zambia’s heroes and a ‘sorrowful’ tale of coercion allegations, vulnerability, and pain\nAppreciating Sinc and Marta\nThis World Cup is likely the last for Canadian great Christine Sinclair and definitely Brazilian legend Marta, both of whom went out in heartbreaking group-stage defeats.\nI can’t say goodbye to Sinc — who faced Australia in her 23rd World Cup start, putting her next to Joy Fawcett for second most in World Cup history — any better than Steph Yang: “It’s inevitable and reasonable, and a reminder that no good thing lasts forever. All we have are the games that we get and then one day even those will be a memory that’s burrowed its way into our hearts for safekeeping, slowly growing duller in detail as memories lose their crisp edge. What will remain is that feeling, the love and awe and joy and misery of the moment.”\nThis speech from Marta about how far women’s sports have come during her lifetime 🥺 pic.twitter.com/fpqCNJ7Rs3\n— Bri Lewerke (@brilewerke) August 2, 2023\n“Continue supporting women’s football,” Marta said. She called time on her own World Cup appearances and pointed out that even though it was her last, it wasn’t for her teammates.\nNext up, Meg Linehan shares her thoughts on the first half of the tournament below…\nMeg’s Corner\nThe best World Cup yet\nWe are only just about to start the knockout stage, but it already feels pretty fair to say this is the best World Cup we’ve ever seen.\nAdvertisement\nFor all of the anxiety about expanding to 32 teams, the way that the group stage played out has not only reinforced that we were ready to move to 32 teams, but has made the tournament so much better.\nSo it’s really hard for me to pick one standout moment from this tournament so far.\nOn Thursday, I think I had the perfect kind of encapsulation of bouncing back and forth between watching Morocco leading Colombia and Germany trying to find a winning goal against South Korea, then trying to focus on Morocco waiting for the result from that Germany game.\nThat, to me, is just a wild and perfect World Cup sequence.\nAnd obviously, there was Germany going out. They were a lot of people’s favorites to win the whole thing. It’s just been so unpredictable in the best possible way.\nWhat is the fan experience like?\nI went through the fan fest here in Sydney and not only did I watch a tuba band from Australia play strange covers of American pop music, I watched two guys come in and absolutely lose their minds posing for photos next to Linda Caicedo’s jersey.\nSometimes you just have to marvel at watching an Australian Oompa Loompa band play Bon Jovi on the other side of the World. That’s a #FIFAWWC moment, baby. pic.twitter.com/2ChVBunN4h\n— Meg Linehan (@itsmeglinehan) August 3, 2023\nObviously, there were a ton of Colombian fans out to watch the two Group H matches, but it feels like we have finally gotten to where it’s not “women’s football,” it’s just football for these athletes.\nIt’s ”just” the World Cup.\nThere are so many standout players from this tournament, but if I think of a breakout star of this year in general, I think it has to be both Linda Caicedo and the pure, wonderful chaos.\nNo result can be taken for granted and it has made for a really amazing tournament to this point.\nAdvertisement\nRemembering the Group Stage\nGroup stage Best XI\nIt’s worth commemorating the accomplishments of players to this point, regardless of how this tournament finishes. Best XIs can so easily skew toward how a player’s team fared when there’s only a maximum of seven games for any one team to play. Why not sort out who was the standout of group play (hint: it’s Linda Caicedo) and find those diamonds among the eliminated sides who may soon be overshadowed by whoever makes a run to the final? A group of writers and editors covering the tournament for The Athletic cast their ballots; here’s who stood out in the 2023 World Cup group stage:\n- Goalkeeper: Rebecca Spencer (Jamaica)\n- Defenders: Ona Batlle (Spain), Julie Ertz (U.S.), Katie McCabe (Republic of Ireland), Steph Catley (Australia)\n- Midfielders: Kyra Cooney-Cross (Australia), Jill Roord (Netherlands), Teresa Abelleira (Spain)\n- Forwards: Linda Caicedo (Colombia), Mina Tanaka (Japan), Ary Borges (Brazil)\n– Jeff Rueter\nEd. note from Emily: I think it’s a farce that Thembi Kgatlana isn’t in this. She might be in my finalists for group-stage MVP.\nFun Time World Cup Trivia\nTest your nickname knowledge\nIf you don’t want the answer to yesterday’s question, stop scrolling now….\nNo. 72 Morocco advanced to the round of 16, becoming the lowest-ranked team to do so. They beat the record set by No. 54 South Africa who qualified a day prior.\nToday’s question…\nI agree with Rebecca Lowe and Brendan Hunt, The USWNT needs a cool nickname. What is the nickname of the China women’s national team (hint: it’s one of the coolest out there)?\nFull-Time First Looks\nThe first time Yamila Rodriguez’s head popped out of the dugout during Argentina’s game, her light-blue-tinted hair was visible in the stands. An Argentinian fan sitting near Laia Cervello Herrero exclaimed: “Look at her, that one is the anti-Messi.” The story of the Argentine top scorer with a, gasp, Cristiano Ronaldo tattoo.\nFor Ona Batlle, one of the stars of last season’s Women’s Super League campaign, the summer involves not only the World Cup but the move of a lifetime. The former Manchester United defender is off to Barcelona Femeni. Before the World Cup, she took The Athletic through some of the crucial plays over her career.\nAdvertisement\nFinally, you must see Jamaica coach Lorne Donaldson’s celebration as it became clear his side was going through to the next round. I don’t think I’d act any differently.\nJamaica Head Coach Lorne Donaldson's postgame celebration was amazing 🤣🇯🇲 pic.twitter.com/camPymOtcc\n— FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) August 2, 2023\n(Photo: Alex Pantling/Getty Images)",
