It wasn't a good experience in terms of the result but this is the kind of game you want to play in. Players from Liverpool FC, from Chelsea, from Man United, from Man City, are players that have to enjoy playing in this kind of game. I enjoy it a lot when we play against big opponents.\n\"As a football player, as an elite athlete, you are going to try to use it [the 7-0] to motivate yourself. I don't know much about the Man United players but I’m sure they are coming here to try and get the result from us.\"\nUnited's 7-0 defeat at Liverpool last season came only a week after they won the Carabao Cup - the high-point of the Erik ten Hag era so far.\nSince then, United have failed to meet the lofty expectations set of themselves and could end the weekend as low as ninth in the Premier League standings.\nWhile United head to Anfield off the back of a disappointing 1-0 loss to Bayern Munich in their final Champions League group stage match, Liverpool were able to rest most of their key stars for their defeat to Union Saint-Gilloise in the Europa League on Thursday having topped their group with a game to spare.",
