The protection of players must be at the center (of them).\"\nWith the semifinals and final scheduled for 3 pm local time at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, where temperatures could reach 32 C, the heat debate is set to intensify.\nSuggestions for 2026 include scheduling midday games in covered stadiums to combat heat stress.\nThunderstorms have also caused disruptions, with matches suspended as players left the pitch and fans sought shelter.\nChelsea manager Enzo Maresca criticized having the US as a host after a two-hour weather delay marred his team's last-16 win over Benfica in Charlotte.\nIts knockout match in front of a half-empty stadium, with under 26,000 fans at the start, showed how attendances have also been underwhelming for matches involving European clubs, with South American and Arabic fans providing much of the tournament's vibrancy.\nDespite the excitement on the pitch, FIFA's website still lists plenty of tickets available for the remaining games, including next week's semifinals and the July 13 final, raising questions about the tournament's broader appeal in the US.\nAs FIFA reflects on the Club World Cup's successes and challenges, the lessons learned will be critical in shaping the 2026 World Cup, where similar issues may loom large.\nReuters\nMost Popular\n- Guangdong beats Macao 2-0 in first leg of soccer cup\n- Para teams set to leave mark on ice\n- US skier Johnson wins women's downhill as Vonn crashes at Milan-Cortina Games\n- Su Yiming clinches first medal at Milano-Cortina\n- Over 300 athletes from 35 countries and regions kick off Asian championships in Tianjin\n- Legacy of Beijing 2022 lives on as Milan welcomes Games",
