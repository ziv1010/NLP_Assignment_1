The Red Devils are yet to draw a single match, with all 18 of their contests across all competitions ending in victory or defeat.\nArguably the most humiliating loss of their nine was the 4-3 defeat to Danish side Copenhagen on November 8.\nMan Utd led 2-0 and 3-2 in the tie, though ultimately fell to a 4-3 loss in Denmark. The defeat was United’s third in the group phase of the Champions League and leaves them bottom of the pile with only two matches remaining.\nThe matchwinner in Copenhagen was livewire winger Roony Bardghji who was aged just 17 at the time.\nThe Kuwait-born Sweden Under-21 international is a veritable wonderkid and despite his tender age, has already been playing senior football for Copenhagen since 2021.\nBardghi has taken giant strides forward this season and added end product to his game. Indeed, the left-footed right winger has has scored 11 goals in 25 matches.\nGiven many of his outings have come off the bench, Bardghi is operating at a goal every 122 minutes this term. That’s a truly remarkable record for a player who only turned 18 two days ago.\nNow, according to online outlet Football Insider, Brighton intend to bring Bardghji to the Premier League.\nBrighton spy latest transfer masterstroke; plan to beat rivals revealed\nThe Seagulls are universally known for being masters of the transfer market and regularly sign young stars who go on to generate gigantic profits for the club.\nPer FI, Brighton are by no means alone in chasing Bardghji. However, they’re confident they’ll be able to lure Bardghji to the south coast by way of a more concrete path towards regular first-team football.\nA move to a higher profile club could result in Bardghji wasting away on the bench. Brighton, meanwhile, have shown a willingness to trust young stars and would be able to fast-track the winger into their first-team plans.\nCopenhagen are understandably reluctant to lose such a high calibre player. However, the report adds that with interest growing, a sale will wind up being inevitable.\nOn the subject of cost, FI conclude ‘a fee of around £30m plus add-ons’ could be enough to seal a deal.\nThat is far higher than the types of fees we’re accustomed to seeing Brighton spend on teenage sensations.\nHowever, it’s perhaps an indication of just how highly Bardghji is regarded, as well as the fact he’s already an established first-team player in Denmark.\nEURO PAPER TALK: Fresh Man City ‘tension’ opens door for Real Madrid to seal stunning £175m raid; Chelsea chasing exciting Monaco attacker",
