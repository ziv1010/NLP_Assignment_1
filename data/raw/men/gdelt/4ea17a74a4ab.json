  "body_text": "Sport Editor Alice Hunt considers the changes in format to the Champions League\nAfter 144 games and 470 goals, the league phase of the new Champions League format has reached its conclusion. With much debate surrounding the changes, reflections can be made over the competition’s success so far.\nThe league phase consisted of thirty-six teams from across Europe, a substantial change from the previous group-stage format. Premier League leaders Liverpool ended the stage top of the table. Liverpool won seven of their eight fixtures – including comfortable victories against Real Madrid and AC Milan. Liverpool’s domination formed part of a broader British control, with all five teams representing the UK progressing in the competition. The Premier League boasted the strongest contingent. Three teams finished in the top eight – Liverpool, Arsenal and Aston Villa. This highlights success for the Premier League, but does it signal a successful change to the competition’s structure?\nThe Champions League, previously named the European Cup, is the pinnacle of European football. It is a competition children across the world dream of winning. The expansion of the competition to thirty-six teams has made such dreams more accessible to clubs traditionally on the periphery or excluded entirely from European success. French side Brest are an example of this, having reached the play-off round in their first season in the competition.\nExciting competition was evident throughout the league. Not only have teams like Brest tasted the exhilarating high of Champions League progression, but stronger teams including financial powerhouses Real Madrid and Manchester have struggled – with both failing to secure an automatic qualification spot. Instead, they will face-off in the play-off round. This adds another layer of excitement to the competition. Furthermore, only three of the nine top-seeded teams in the original draw finished in the top eight of the league phase. This uncertainty has only added to the theatre of the competition.\nThe competitive nature of the league resulted in a dramatic final matchday of the phase, with only six teams finishing in the same position they began the matchday in. Additionally, sixty-four goals were scored in the final game-week, averaging a goal every ninety seconds. Such excitement and chaos were a phenomenal advert for the game, with so much at stake until the final whistle. Thrills were present throughout the phase, with this year providing the highest goal-per-game average in the competition’s history. If so much drama happened throughout the phase, why are critics continuing to dwell on the format’s flaws?\nOne major drawback of this year’s Champions League is that there is no longer the consolation prize of Europa League participation for those knocked out in the early stages of the competition. With more teams competing at the top of the European pyramid, it is now more difficult than ever to secure that prestigious Champions League trophy. Though many teams had to work to secure their fate on the final matchday, a handful of clubs had already been eliminated. This again exposing the less exciting aspects of the format. A team in the play-offs would have to play seventeen games in the competition in order to win it – many critics would argue this is too long and tedious a process for what should be an enthralling cup competition reserved for Europe’s best.\nMany more debates can and will be had on the changes to the Champions League. With the league phase over, the puzzle is slowly being completed, and we are one step closer to the finished piece. For now, excitement is brewing for the British teams, with Liverpool leading the pack – will they make it number seven come the end of the season?\nLike this?
