  "body_text": "I thought last Sunday was one of our best performances of the season.\nIt’s a double edge sword though, isn’t it? As the Gunners fill you with pride you can’t help but think what if?\nWhat If Saka had converted his spot kick at the London Stadium?\nWhat if Ramsdale doesn’t pass the ball to Alvarez?\nThe margins between success and failure in sport so small.\nMan City have some tricky trips left, and if we needed the Champions to slip up once I would fancy our chances.\nWe need them to at least drop 4 points out of their final five fixtures though.\nSo, either a loss and a draw or three draws.\nGiven Pep’s men have won 12 of their last 13 Prem games (drawing the other) it’s not looking likely, and we are probably in truth, running out of games?\nLook at it another way though.\nOne slip up from City and it would take the title race to the last day when anything can happen and at least we can dream?\nThe type of occasions we waited decades to be involved in.\nThat’s if we win all our remaining matches of course …\nLeeds 1-2 Newcastle\nSo, shock horror …despite Pep Guardiola ‘ not knowing more ‘ then Big Sam, despite their ‘nothing Pep, Klopp, Arteta can teach me ‘ …….\nLeeds lost their first match under their new boss!\nDidn’t see that coming!\nIn all seriousness I think Big Sam would have looked at Leed’s final two fixtures as more winnable then the first two (especially if West Ham are distracted by a European Final).\nThe Leeds faithful will try and create an intimidating atmosphere at Elland Road.\nAny other year I would fancy the Toon to buckle, but the Geordies are made of sterner stuff these days and have the personality to roll up their sleeves if they have to.\nVilla 3-1 Spurs\nThe maximum points Spurs can get this season is 66, having played a game more than Newcastle on 65 and Man United on 63.\nSo, this should be the weekend where they mathematically can no longer qualify for the Champions League.\nThey should instead be looking over their shoulder and worrying if they will be playing In Europe at all next season (most likely top 7 will be enough ……8th if West Ham win the Conference).\nA Villa win puts these two on joint points.\nPlaying in any UEFA competition will be a success given where Villa was when Emery took over.\nThat feelgood factor will be felt at Villa Park while the visitors go through the motions.\nChelsea 1-1 Forest\nForest kicked off in the bottom three on Monday night having watched all their relegation rivals play, so give them credit for handling the pressure of the occasion.\nLeeds and Leicester’s 2 out of their final 3 fixtures are against those in the top 6 while Everton have to play Man City.\nSo, 33 points might be enough to stay up.\nWith their goal difference though, Leeds or Leicester would overtake Forest with one win.\nOne more point then could be enough for Forest (I can’t see the Foxes getting to 34 points).\nThe fact it’s taken till May for Chelsea to get over 40 points highlights how bad they have been. I thought nothing else could highlight that.\nThen I look at Forrest’s final three fixtures and I think that a trip to the Bridge is their best chance of getting that point!\nSays it all!\nPalace 4-1 Cherries\nLeicester or Leeds would have to win all those games to catch the Cherries now.\nIt shows that the difference in a relegation battle is who can put consecutive wins together.\nIt’s an incredible achievement for Bournemouth to stay in this division.\nThey have to give everything for every point and it’s natural that with survival secured there will be a drop off as they no longer play with jeopardy.\nThey would have bitten your hand off for that scenario.\nMan United 1-0 Wolves\nMan United seem to be doing their best to not qualify for the Champions League.\nThey can actually afford another loss and would still have their top 4 fate in their own hands, so no need to panic.\nYet Eric Ten Hag would like to prepare for an FA Cup Final with some momentum.\nAt the moment his team are limping over the line.\nWolves are now mathematically safe. They were bottom of the table at Xmas, so Julen Lopetegui has done a great job.\nSaints 1-1 Fulham\nSaints are relegated if they don’t win on Saturday and even if they do could be later on in the weekend.\nThat’s a hard scenario to get yourself motivated for.\nOn and off the pitch, the club have accepted Championship football next season, and preparations will already be under way.\nThey will give it one last push, but it won’t be enough.\nA certain Mitrovic is back for the visitors.\nBrentford 3-1 West Ham\nThis is where West Ham wanted to be in time for their UEFA Conference Semi Final.\nDavid Moyes won’t publicly admit it, but his team are safe, 2 of the 4 teams below them are not getting to 37 points.\nIt means he can rest players with the 2nd leg in Holland in mind.\nEven if he plays his strongest team on Sunday, it’s natural that players will be distracted by Europe.\nHow often do the Hammers get a chance to get to a final?\nFor some of these players it might be their only chance of ever lifting a trophy.\nEverton 2-3 Man City\nToffees fans are trying to replicate 12 months ago by meeting the coach, getting to the ground early, setting off blue flares, in a bid to create a Cup final like atmosphere to be the 12th man in their relegation battle.\nI can understand why some see this as a banana skin for City in between a Champions League Semi Final.\nGoodison Park is an old-fashioned venue, with the crowd on top of you.\nIt’s always a tough place to go even when the home side are near the bottom.\nThe type of place where crazy things can happen.\nAs a Gooner you rather Everton go into the game having just scored 5 instead of conceding 5.\nTheir mood could be dictated to by what Leeds and Forest do the day before.\nThe issue is though there will a prolonged period where the visitors put the home side under intense pressure. Is Everton’s defence good enough to hold out?\nHopes on Merseyside and North London momentarily raised but ultimately dashed ….\nArsenal 2-1 Brighton\nIt would have been nice for at least once in this title race if the TV companies asked for us to play before Man City.\nWe either kick off at the Emirates on Sunday 4 points behind City or with a chance to go back top of the table.\nEither way it guarantees a nervy atmosphere and tests our players mentality.\nThat’s why Jorginho needs to carry on playing. I wonder if Arteta goes to bed regretting not trusting the Italian sooner.\nAlongside Xhaka last weekend, they were always talking, instructing their peers where to be and teaching youngsters how to see out a game.\nBrighton have earnt the right to assume Monday was a freak result, plus we won’t be counter attacking like Everton did as we will have most of the ball.\nThe Seagulls are good enough to take advantage of our anxiety and I think they will give us a scare.\nLeicester 1-4 Liverpool\nFor the second Monday running the TV companies haven’t been kind to Leicester with the Foxes having to watch all their rivals play before them.\nThey will be in the same scenario the following Monday.\nBy the time they kick off they could be 19th and as much as 5 points away from safety.\nJames Maddison said his peers were not ‘hungry enough’ at Fulham.\nIf they couldn’t be motivated against a team with nothing to play for (knowing the tougher games ahead) then do the players or fans think they can keep out free scoring Liverpool?\nBear in mind it’s 20 league games since they kept a clean sheet!\nWere Maddison’s comments helpful?\nThey smacked of someone who knows whatever happens he’s still playing in the top flight next season.\nDan Smith\nLAST WEEKS TABLE\nJRA 233\nSid 231\nMatthew 230\nJ gunner 229\nTerrah 226\nHH 225\nGB 225\nRob 49- 223\nMTG 211\nSJ 207\nDendrite 207\nGundown 206\nOkobino 205\nStephanie 204\nIGL 204\nI 203\nOnyango 203\nPrince 202\nLongbenark 199\nLoose cannon 197\nDan kit 196\nYayo.193\nTom 192\nAntivirus 191\nZeek 189\nMisgana 188\nAckshay 188\nToney 185\nTaiwo 4321 – 185\nSue P 183\nGoonersia 180\nMe 180\nSagie 177\nDiehard 176\nEdu 174\nPhenom 172\nK Tyson 171\nAngelo 167\nKenya 001- 166\nDrayton 165\nAyan 165\nSplendid 162\nE blaze 159\nDotash 159\nOluseyi 157\nAdmin 139\nJ gunz 138\nGotanidea 128\nLabass 128\nJ Bauer 120\nO Achiel 118\nKadii 117\nTN Arsenal 114\nJOA 112\nKuhepson 104\nDunchurado 104\nFamochi 104\nWalidomy 96\nM Wokoma 95\nBig slim 94\nChuck 88\nNOAS 81\nUzil Ozil 81\nBaron 74\nM leashim 74\nJ Moati 72\nJ legend 66\nQuincy 54\nBME 53\nAdeybayo 50\nBa thea 45\nElsammy 45\nRiveriosantos 44\nFlash G 32\nOlushorlar 29\nRuler system 28\nIlliterate 28\nSamson A 27\nArsha 23\nGogo\nAdiva 19\nKobin 19\nMy name is Lehman 18\nLucia 18\nRusty 17\nZeus 16\nOGHENE 16\nGibson Power 15\nBob 123 – 15\nBen 15\nEasyguy 15\nDannie 15\nIshmael 14\nVZ 14\nLima 13\nK hristov 12\nBen Dungate 12\nAdajim 11\nEmperor A 11\nAtangana 11\nKoktafo 10\nStone 9\nLancydatguy 9\nOlamide 9\nLinsagunner 9\nRoyal Challenger 8\nMr Fox 8\nM powson 8\nTop 4 never again 8\nSt Joachim 8\nS malah 7\nJeremy 7\nTrue Gunner 7\nWale Akinlatun 7\nJoebaba 6\nAkota 6\nMide 6\nAzeez omerah cole 6\nSws 6\nChigozirim 6\nAltaseb A – 5\nZig 5\nMide 5\nJosiah 5\nKenneth 5\nKyambadde Sam 4\nAnti Kev 4\nAkuta George 4\nWenger ball 4\nOkal JR.14- 4\nGavana 4\nJen 4\nE Augustus 4\nD McAllister 4\nSamuel Akinsola Adenosin 3\nClassy Gunner 3\nE Franklyn 3",
