If anyone claims they predicted back in August that Nottingham Forest would be above Manchester City going into the final stretch of the season, they’re a liar. Just like Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur being in the bottom half of the table, it’s been an unpredictable campaign.\nSo, as we run the rule over the best players in the Premier League for 2024-25, there are undoubtedly some names who wouldn’t have been in the conversation at all last summer. Players from Brighton, Brentford, Bournemouth, Forest and Fulham make the grade, whereas there’s little room for Manchester United and Spurs representatives. As with all these sorts of rankings, they’re open to debate, so let us know what you think on social media using #FFTPL50.\nElsewhere, David Beckham turns 50 this month – we talked to former team-mates and people in the game, Harry Kane included, to offer their thoughts on Golden Balls as he morphs from footballer to owner.\nDuncan Ferguson cut a rather intimidating figure on the pitch, but FFT plucked up the courage to speak to him and pass on readers’ questions.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nPlus, 20 years on from that famous night in Istanbul, we relive Liverpool’s Champions League final triumph over Milan with Stevie G, Carra & Co.
