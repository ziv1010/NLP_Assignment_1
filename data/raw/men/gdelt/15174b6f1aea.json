He could also look to Brighton's Joao Pedro as a replacement, with Richarlison also ruled out having undergone surgery last week.\nMail Sport also understands that Jesus, who has endured an injury stricken season so far, will be assessed by Brazil's medical team before the green light is given for him to play.\nArsenal's technical director Edu is in contact with the national side's staff over the fitness of the forward.\nJesus, who has scored four times in all competitions for Arsenal this season, has only featured in seven of their opening 12 Premier League matches, having been ruled out of their first three games with a knee injury.\nOne of those goals came during their victory against Sevilla, in which Jesus played 81 minutes before he left the field with a hamstring problem.\nIf deemed able to play, he could start in a front three alongside team-mate Gabriel Martinelli and Rodrygo.\nArteta had previously stressed that he didn't want to put a timeline on his return to full fitness, urging caution over rushing him back too fast.\n'With him [Jesus], I’m honestly not going to give [a timeframe],' the Spanish manager said in a press conference ahead of his side's game against West Ham at the start of November.\nHe added: 'I did it once and got it totally wrong. We need to be cautious because we need to treat it in the right way.\n'He’s already pushing everybody and wants to be back as quickly as possible, and we need him, so that’s great.'\nBut the Gunners boss will be sweating on the fitness of his forward should he start on Tuesday night.\nMeanwhile, Diniz has also claimed that it was Jesus' decision to fly out to join the Brazil national team.\nJesus previously sustained a knee injury that saw him miss the first three games of the season\nArsenal staff in dialogue with the national side's medical team, who will assess his fitness before the tie\n‘I trust the player and him being here. I talked to Gabriel and he didn’t come here without planning,' the Brazil coach said.\n‘He said he is feeling good and was already doing things ten days before the first game and 15 days before the second game.\n‘We thought it was an interesting risk to bring him here. He is in good condition.\n‘We are doing things with great care. As soon as he arrived, we gave him a new MRI scan. We are treating him very carefully.\n‘If he is in the right condition, he will be available against Argentina.'\nMost watched Sport videos\n- Disgusting drink act caught on camera at ICC T20 World Cup\n- Tiffany Salmond dazzles in red bikini at Bondi Icebergs\n- Team GB Winter Olympics hero: Matt Weston wins skeleton gold\n- IOC President in tears after Ukrainian athlete is kicked out\n- NBA player makes long-awaited debut after battle with cancer\n- Team USA skier Breezy Johnson gets engaged after crash\n- Aussie snowboarder Scotty James shows off his dance moves\n- Has VAR broken football?
