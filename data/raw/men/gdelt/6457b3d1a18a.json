Offaly, and Co. Galway native Duffy have been shining in the Athlone set-up for some time, and have recently won international recognition on numerous occasions. Both players are expected to have very exciting careers ahead of them in the League of Ireland.\nMeanwhile, club stalwart Kellie Brennan has been elected by her fellow players to be part of this season's Professional Football Association of Ireland's Management Committee.\nThe 12-strong Committee, that represents the interests of players throughout the League of Ireland, also includes fellow women's player, Maria Reynolds from Shamrock Rovers, and current Athlone Town senior men's captain, Brendan Clarke.\nAthlone's women's team have also found out their fate for this season's Avenir Sports All-Island Cup, the cross-border competition founded in 2023.\nThe Town, who won a famous domestic League and Cup double last season, have been drawn in Group 3, where they will face Cliftonville Ladies, Treaty Utd and Cork City.\nAthlone will play one home fixture and two away fixtures, commencing the first weekend of April.\nLike last season, Athlone will probably juggle their squad for this competition, as the League of Ireland season will have commenced, and John Sullivan's side will again have UEFA Champions League fixtures on the horizon. Last season's All-Island Cup was won by Wexford with Galway Utd claiming the title before them.\nNews of the draw comes hot on the heels of Athlone announcing another impressive new signing for the women's squad in the shape of Donegal native and former Republic of Ireland player, Roma McLaughlin. The 27 year-old midfielder has League of Ireland experience with Peamount Utd and Shelbourne, as well as abroad for Connecticut Blue Devils and Fortuna Hjørring, in Denmark.\nMcLaughlin has played for 12 times for the Irish senior national team and comes to the Midlands with huge promise, as Sullivan and his all-conquering side continue to prepare for the season's traditional curtain-raiser, the President's Cup Final, on Sunday, March 8.",
