In the period between 2016 and 2020, 16 new artificial pitches opened in Latvia with the help of the national association.\nAs far as women’s football is concerned, the LFF is striving to bring more players into the game, and ensure a sustainable competition environment for each girl to fit into and play, while simultaneously investing in the development of local clubs. From 2016-20, the number of registered women players increased from 1,129 to 2,216\n\"Opportunities for development are endless and we are eager to improve football facilities, coach education and the number of players involved in football so that everyone gets a chance to play, follow a healthy lifestyle and build strong and friendly relationships in the game.\"\nUEFA support\nUEFA's HatTrick programme, which channels EURO funds into football development across Europe, has been fundamental to the LFF’s football development programmes, especially in women’s football where UEFA’s Women’s Football Development Programme (WFDP) has provided important guidance for the development of the game.\nHatTrick funding has helped to encourage the sustainable development of clubs and participation programmes, supporting the laying of artificial pitches and the improvement of natural turf pitches, and playing a crucial role in the opening of the national youth training centre at Staicele, which has residential facilities for young players.\nUEFA's Football and Social Responsibility (FSR) goals have also inspired the LFF, with new projects geared towards creating gender equality and equal access to football, and focusing on inclusion for people with mental health issues.\nTimeline\nAssociation history\nNational team history\nPresident\nVadims Ļašenko\nNationality: Latvian\nDate of birth: 7 April 1984\nAssociation president since: 2020\nGeneral secretary\nArturs Gaidels\nNationality: Latvian\nDate of birth: 24 June 1984\nAssociation general secretary since: 2021",
