But I’ve taken the decision to experience this adventure, and I’m really motivated. I’ve got a house already, and my car. The traffic is really s*** — nothing like Villarreal — but I’m feeling good.”\nAdvertisement\nThe traffic is just one difference between Villarreal, a quiet city in the east of Spain with a population of 52,000, and London, where more than 15million people live within its metropolitan area.\nBut Pino has made a promising start to life in the capital since he joined for a fee in excess of €25million (£21.5m) in August, playing seven times in all competitions and providing two assists in their Europa Conference League opener against Dynamo Kyiv. Pino took Eberechi Eze’s No 10 shirt after his initial £60m move across the city to Arsenal — a tough act to follow after his FA Cup final-winning goal and all-round contribution to the club’s recent successes.\nIt is an exciting time to be at Palace after that first major trophy in their history and their Community Shield win on penalties against Premier League champions Liverpool in August. Last month’s 2-1 win against the same opponents has helped Oliver Glasner’s side to sixth in the table, part of a club record 19-game unbeaten run that ended with a 2-1 loss against Everton before the international break.\nSpeaking from Spain’s international camp at Las Rozas near Madrid, winger/attacking midfielder Pino says fellow Spanish speakers Daniel Munoz and Jefferson Lerma are among those helping him to settle in. French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta is also doing his best to help out.\n“The Colombians (Munoz and Lerma) are all helping me, (Argentine goalkeeper) Walter Benitez too,” Pino says. “And Mateta, always with his personality. He doesn’t speak much Spanish, but he tries to speak it with me. The club also have staff who advise you on good places to live. So I’m settling in well.”\nPino has also been supported by Spain team-mates who live in London — Marc Cucurella at Chelsea, Pedro Porro at Tottenham and Arsenal trio David Raya, Mikel Merino and Martin Zubimendi.\nAdvertisement\n“When I arrived, I spoke a lot with them,” he says. “We live close to each other, and we’ve been out to eat together. But I’ve not got my favourite Spanish restaurant yet. I’ve been pretty busy, just trying to settle in, and then I can try to get to know the city a bit more.”\nBorn in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the capital of the Canary Islands, Pino joined Villarreal’s academy aged 14 from local youth club Roda. He went on to score 22 goals and provide 25 assists across 170 games for Villarreal’s first team. His stint at the club saw them win the Europa League by beating Manchester United in the 2021 final, with the side coached by Unai Emery reaching the following season’s Champions League semi-finals.\nPino accepts the Premier League is faster and more physical than La Liga, and is aware of the challenge that poses for someone of his 5ft 8in (172cm) frame and build. He also knows many diminutive Spanish playmakers have thrived in England, including two of his personal heroes growing up — Santi Cazorla at Arsenal and David Silva at Manchester City.\n“I’m enjoying the Premier League,” he says. “It’s a bit crazier than Spanish football, but that’s no problem. With technical quality, you can survive the pace of the game in England.\n“Spanish players who physically are not the biggest athletes have been among the best in the world with the ball. I know Cazorla (from Villarreal, where he made 334 appearances across three spells), he knows that he’s my idol. David Silva too, who’s from the Canary Islands like me. I keep them in mind, always.”\nGlasner played a key role convincing Pino, who turns 23 on October 20, to leave Villarreal.\n“He has trusted in me from our first phone call, up until today,” Pino says. “He told me he wanted me to play the same role as at Villarreal. My old coaches (from Villarreal), Marcelino and Emery, also wanted the team to have possession of the ball. But when we don’t have it, to press really hard and high to win it back. That fits perfectly with my way of playing.\nAdvertisement\n“He (Glasner) tells me to have freedom and confidence, to play as I know how. He tells me things I have to improve, which are many, and that I have a very high ceiling.”\nPino met one of his former managers when he made his Palace debut off the bench in a 3-0 win against Emery’s Aston Villa. There was also a chance to catch up with Marcelino and his old team-mates when Villarreal visited Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League in early September.\n“Emery gave me my debut and I will always be thankful for everything he taught me,” he said. “It’s thanks to him that today I’m the player I am. We shook hands, but we didn’t have much time for advice — it was all very quick.”\nMarc Guehi, Ismaila Sarr and Tyrick Mitchell are among Pino’s new Palace team-mates to have made a big impression. He praises Adam Wharton’s contribution on and off the ball and says the 21-year-old midfielder — whose name has been discussed positively behind the scenes at Real Madrid — would easily fit into a Spain side who are reigning European champions.\n“Adam can do everything,” says Pino. “Defensively, he is a fighter. He goes in very strong, wins a lot of balls. Technically, you just have to watch him and enjoy him. He has the quality to play in the Spain national team, no doubt.”\nPino made his full Spain debut aged just 18 and has scored four goals in 16 appearances for his country — netting his latest international effort in their 2-0 World Cup qualifying win against Georgia on Saturday, which he started. He has featured in two UEFA Nations League finals, playing a key role as they beat Italy and Croatia to win the 2023 edition and coming on in the 2025 final against Portugal this June, a game Spain lost on penalties.\nA serious knee injury meant he missed out on La Roja’s victory at the 2024 European Championship in Germany, but, once he was fit again, national coach Luis de la Fuente brought him straight back.\nAdvertisement\n“I really appreciate that, and Luis knows that,” says Pino. “The players called me during the Euros, and then again during the celebrations, to talk to me. Luis too. I was far away, but they made me feel close, and I really appreciate that.”\nBarcelona’s 18-year-old star Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams of Athletic Club were Spain’s starters in the wide attacking positions during the Euros, but both are out injured for this international break. After his goal against Georgia in Elche, he will look to impress again in Tuesday’s match against Bulgaria in Valladolid.\n“If I’m not playing, I always help make the group,” he says. “Then, when you get the chance, do your best so that the national team wins things. It’s not about the individual. Hopefully we can go as far as possible (at the World Cup) and try to win such a big trophy.\n“People always talk about Spain as possible winners. And those of us who take the pitch have to show we can do that.”",
