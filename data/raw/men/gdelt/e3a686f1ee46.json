At the moment, we are not talking about players.\n\"I saw Behdad [Eghbali], with Paul [Winstanley] and Laurence [Stewart]. I think we are going to have a chat tomorrow. We didn't talk about names or players. For now, we are focusing on players like Andrey Santos.\"\nHenderson is a modern great at Anfield, captaining the Reds to successes in the Premier League, Champions League, the FA Cup and the Carabao Cup before calling time on his 12-year career on Merseyside.\nAny potential incomings at Stamford Bridge may depend on potential departures. 90min understands Chelsea are keen to keep Conor Gallagher, who is into the final 18 months of his contract, but will listen to offers of £60m.\nChelsea's young and expensive squad have struggled for consistency throughout the campaign but are currently enjoying their best run of form since Pochettino's arrival, winning five of their last six games in all competitions.\nNext up is the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final away at Middlesbrough before a home clash with Fulham. There are then ten days until the Blues play Boro again at Stamford Bridge.",
