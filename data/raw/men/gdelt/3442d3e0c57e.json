When Sandro Tonali gets to 27 and 28, what an even better player he could be!!\nAlthough he isn’t too bad just now…\nSandro Tonali can do everything, defensive cover, link up play, create chances, score goals…how on earth that one stayed out when hitting the post yesterday???\nTino Livramento is one of the quickest players I have seen and he looks it.\nSandro Tonali is even quicker BUT doesn’t look it. He just glides across the turf and it is a bit like a computer game, where suddenly he is on another part of the pitch and you think how has he got from A to B (a bit like Jimmy Nail in Spender when he was running around Newcastle!).\nWe saw it against Wolves on Saturday, yet more players finding they have been ‘Tonali’d’, thinking they are free in a dangerous position and suddenly the Italian genius is picking their pocket, taking the ball off them.\nLong may that continue, in a Newcastle United shirt.\nWhat he will help NUFC achieve this 2025/26 season, I can’t wait to find out.\nNewcastle 1 Wolves 0 – Saturday 13 September 2025 3pm\n(Stats via BBC Sport)\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nWoltemade 29\nWolves:\nPossession was Newcastle 57% Wolves 43%\nTotal shots were Newcastle 16 Wolves 8\nShots on target were Newcastle 4 Wolves 3\nCorners were Newcastle 10 Wolves 4\nTouches in the box Newcastle 29 Wolves 23\nNewcastle team v Wolves:\nPope, Trippier, Schar, Burn, Livramento, Tonali, Bruno, Joelinton (Willock 65), Barnes (Elanga 80), Woltemade (Osula 65), Murphy (Botman 95)\nSubs:\nRamsdale, Hall, Thiaw, Krafth, Miley\n(Match Report – Until someone reminds me it was the first of Nick Woltemade’s 200 goals for Newcastle United… Read HERE)\n(Newcastle 1 Wolves 0 – Match ratings and comments on all Newcastle United players – Read HERE)\n(Newcastle 1 Wolves 0 – Instant Newcastle United fan/writer reaction – Read HERE)\nNewcastle United fixtures confirmed dates and times (All of the Champions League matches will also be available to watch on TV in the UK):\nThursday 18th September: Newcastle United vs FC Barcelona (8pm)\nSunday 21 September – Bournemouth v Newcastle (2pm) Sky Sports\nWednesday 24 September – Newcastle v Bradford (7.45pm) Sky Sports+\nSunday 28 September– Newcastle v Arsenal (4.30pm) Sky Sports\nWednesday 1st October: Union SG vs Newcastle United (5:45pm)\nSunday 5 October– Newcastle v Forest (2pm) Sky Sports\nSaturday 18 October – Brighton v Newcastle (3pm)\nTuesday 21st October: Newcastle United vs Benfica (8pm)\nSaturday 25 October – Newcastle v Fulham (3pm)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
