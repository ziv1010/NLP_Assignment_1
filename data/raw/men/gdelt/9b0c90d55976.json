That's why we play here in a different way than I did at Ajax. That will have to be the case, because I can't play the same way here.\n\"That is not in the DNA of Manchester United at all. The football at Ajax is very typical, here we will play much more directly. We also have the players for that, especially at the forefront.\"",
