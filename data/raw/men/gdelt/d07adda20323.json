Appearance tallies are correct as of the end of the 2024/25 season.\n10. Ben White – £50m\n- Year: 2021\n- Signed from: Brighton\n- Appearances: 160\nEyebrows were raised when Arsenal agreed to pay £50million for White, who had just one season of top-flight football under his belt.\nThe former Brighton centre-back had a disastrous debut against Brentford on the opening day of the 2021/22 season but bounced back and silenced his critics.\nHe made a seamless transition to right-back at the start of the 2022/23 season and is now considered one of the best in his position in the Premier League.\n9. Noni Madueke – £52m\n- Year: 2025\n- Signed from: Chelsea\n- Appearances: N/A\nOne of two former Chelsea players on this list, Madueke moved across London in a deal worth an initial £48.5million and £3.5million in add-ons.\n“At just 23, Noni already brings experience of club and international football, and he knows the Premier League very well,” Arteta said.\n“Having seen the quality of Noni’s performances up close in recent seasons, we’re really excited he is joining us.”\nBut a section of the Arsenal fan base have treated the move with scepticism, with more than 5,000 signing a #NoToMadueke petition.\nExcited by the arrival of Noni Madueke, @Arsenal fans? 🔴 pic.twitter.com/pYAT1mnRfN\n— Premier League (@premierleague) July 18, 2025\n8. Gabriel Jesus – £55m\n- Year: 2022\n- Signed from: Manchester City\n- Appearances: 96\nAfter working with Jesus at Manchester City during his time as an assistant coach to Pep Guardiola, Mikel Arteta brought the striker to Arsenal in the summer of 2022 for a total package worth £55million.\nHe scored 11 Premier League goals in his debut season as they finished runners-up to Manchester City and secured Champions League qualification after a six-year absence from Europe’s top competition.\nBut the Brazil international netted just four league goals in the 2023/24 season, suffered an injury for the second half of the 2024/25 season and has now lost his place in Arteta’s starting line-up.\nHe could fall further down the pecking order next season as Arsenal are looking to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP.\n7. Martin Zubimendi – £55.8m\n- Year: 2025\n- Signed from: Real Sociedad\n- Appearances: N/A\nWhen it emerged in the middle of the January 2025 transfer window that Arsenal were pursuing a summer move for Zubimendi, it was big news, especially in the wake of him turning down a move to Liverpool just a few months before.\nArsenal’s wish ultimately came true in July 2025, when they confirmed the signing of the Spain international midfielder for a fee slightly higher than his £52million release clause so they could pay Real Sociedad in instalments.\n“Martin is a player who will bring a huge amount of quality and football intelligence to our team,” Arteta told Arsenal’s official website.\n“He will fit in really well and has all the attributes to be a key player for us.”\n6. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang – £56m\n- Year: 2018\n- Signed from: Borussia Dortmund\n- Appearances: 163\nThe last signing from the Arsene Wenger era, Aubameyang left Borussia Dortmund and joined Arsenal in a £56million deal in January 2018.\nHe established himself as one of the most clinical strikers in the world and won the Premier League Golden Boot award in 2018/19.\nThe Gabon international also led the Gunners to FA Cup success in 2019/20, scoring both goals in the semi-final and the final as they overcame Manchester City and Chelsea.\nBut his form took a swift nosedive after he signed a new £350,000-a-week deal in September 2020 and that contract was terminated by mutual consent in February 2022.\nPure skill from Aubameyang to put Arsenal up 😤 @brfootball\n(via @EmiratesFACup)pic.twitter.com/VG0FptYpwS\n— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) August 1, 2020\n5. Viktor Gyokeres – £64.2m\n- Year: 2025\n- Signed from: Sporting CP\n- Appearances: N/A\nIf there was one area Arsenal needed to put their money towards in the summer 2025 transfer window, it was the centre-forward position.\nSeeing a new striker as the missing piece of the puzzle, Arsenal opted for one of the most prolific in circulation, buying Gyokeres after his 54-goal season for Sporting CP.\nAfter two seasons in Lisbon, the former Coventry City striker pushed for his Premier League move and ultimately got his way, signing a five-year contract.\n“Viktor has so many qualities,” Arteta promised. “He is a quick and powerful presence up front, with incredible goalscoring numbers at club and international levels.\n“He brings a clinical edge with a high conversion rate of chances into goals, with his intelligent movement in the box making him a constant threat.”\n4. Kai Havertz – £65m\n- Year: 2023\n- Signed from: Chelsea\n- Appearances: 87\nDespite failing to live up to expectations at Chelsea, Havertz did enough to impress Arteta and joined Arsenal in a deal worth an initial £62million and £3million in add-ons.\nHe endured a slow start to life in north London in the first half of the 2023/24 season but has experienced an upturn in fortunes since moving into the centre-forward position.\nThe Germany international has 29 goals and 13 assists across his first two seasons at the Emirates, although he too could feel the consequences of plans to sign Gyokeres.\n3. Eberechi Eze – £67.5m\n- Year: 2025\n- Signed from: Crystal Palace\n- Appearances: N/A\nEze was once an Arsenal academy player, but after releasing him at the age of 13, they had to pay up to £67.5m to sign him from Crystal Palace by the time he was an established Premier League star and England international.\nWith the fee comprising an initial £60m plus add-ons, Eze returned to north London at the age of 27, in the prime of his career.\n2. Nicolas Pepe – £72m\n- Year: 2019\n- Signed from: Lille\n- Appearances: 112\nWhile Unai Emery wanted to sign Wilfried Zaha in the summer of 2019, the Arsenal hierarchy overruled his decision and ended up buying Pepe instead.\nHe displayed glimpses of his talent and played a key role in Arsenal’s FA Cup success in 2019/20, setting up the winning goal in the final.\nBut the Ivory Coast international failed to justify the £72million price tag and was ultimately usurped by academy graduate Bukayo Saka.\nPepe spent the 2022/23 season on loan at Nice and the Gunners decided to terminate his contract in September 2023.\n1. Declan Rice – £105m\n- Year: 2023\n- Signed from: West Ham\n- Appearances: 103\nAfter leading West Ham United to victory in the 2023 Europa Conference League final, Rice decided to leave his boyhood club.\nArsenal then broke their transfer record and fought off competition from Manchester City and Bayern Munich to sign the England international in a deal worth an initial £100million and £5million in add-ons.\n“It’s £100 million, it’s a lot of money, I could understand the pressure that comes with it,” Rice said. “Not only the pressure you put on yourself but there’s an expectation of being bought for that much money.\n“People need to see performances straight away. I want to re-pay the club straight away, they have invested a lot of money in me, I need to prove why I can go there and change things.”\nBut the midfielder justified that fee with his performances in his debut season and was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year in 2023/24.\nHe followed it up by being named the Arsenal Player of the Season for 2024/25.\nREAD MORE: Ranking EVERY Arsenal signing under Edu from worst to best after shock exit decision",
