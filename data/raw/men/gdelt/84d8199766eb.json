They travel to Liverpool next month with a one goal advantage in their semi-final tie.\nBut should Daniel Levy decide a change is needed before then a number of Premier League managers have been tipped to replace the Australian.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

This is not about me, but what is about me right now is I have the responsibility of the group of players I do have, to try and get us through this, and that’s what I’ve got to focus on.\nMore Trending\n‘For me to focus on anything else is abstaining myself from the responsibility I have. I’m just determined to get us out of this.\n‘The club’s doing its best to…more about helping the players than helping me because they’re the ones we’re asking some massive jobs of 18-year-olds. We had a 17-year-old out there trying to win games of football for us.\n‘And others who are just playing week on week, so, you know it’s more about getting the players help rather than me help.’\nPostecoglou will be desperate for a win when Tottenham travel to Hoffenheim in the Europa League on Thursday, and again when they host Leicester City in the Premier League on Sunday.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Owen Hargreaves makes worrying Man Utd claim after ‘dreadful’ Brighton defeat\nMORE: Michael Dawson says £58m Chelsea star would be ‘perfect’ for Man City\nMORE: Chelsea hope injury doubt Cole Palmer is fit to end Vitor Pereira’s Wolves honeymoon",
