The Brazilian footballer has been on Merseyside since he joined the club in 2018, since then he has established himself as one of the world's best goalkeepers.\nLiverpool signed the 33-year-old goalkeeper in a record deal, paying £67m from Italian side Roma. The family relocated from Italy to Liverpool and have been together for thirteen years, they married in 2015. Together, Alisson and Natalia have three children together. The couple share Matteo, Helena and Rafael, who were born between 2017 and 2021.\nOn Instagram, Natalia posted a photo of her and Alisson together. Her birthday message said: \"Happy birthday to my favourite person in the world.\n\"May Jesus be the foundation and centre of your life and may you continue to grow in grace, love and wisdom, good health and many more years to come.\"\nShe continued: \"May you continue dreaming and realizing, reflecting Jesus and inspiring with your humility, simplicity and gratitude. You have all my love and admiration! May God Bless You! Congrats my love!\"\nWith Alisson's busy schedule, Natalia tries to be by his side as much as possible. When Liverpool lifted the Premier League in May, Natalia was in attendance to watch the special events unfold.\nThis year Liverpool FC launched a docuseries about the Becker family. The series follows Alisson throughout the Premier League-winning season of 2024-25 and features special interviews with his family in Brazil, who share stories of how he rose to become first choice goalkeeper for club and country.\nIt has been a difficult couple of games for Liverpool FC after suffering consecutive defeats against Crystal Palace in the Premier League and Galatasaray in the Champions League.\nAlisson was forced from the field in the second half of the Reds' 1-0 defeat at RAMS Park after making a save from Victor Osimhen in a one-on-one situation.\nRegarding Alisson, Arne Slot said in the post-match press conference: \"When he sprinted back he felt something. I cannot tell you [exactly] because I am not a physio, but normally when a player feels something, goes to the floor and doesn't come back onto the pitch [it's not good].\n\"If my player is on the floor, I nine out of 10 times fear the worst – and by the worst I mean he cannot continue. That's what happened with Alisson.\"\nLiverpool's manager added: \"Normally, he will not be able to play Saturday. That's 99.9% – I've already said 100%, but let's make it 99.9 [although] I think it's 100.\"\nAlisson was at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in France on September 22, as he was nominated for the 2025 Yachine Trophy. The accolade celebrates the best men’s goalkeepers in world football.\nThe Brazil international Alisson, who helped the Reds win a second Premier League title last season, didn't win the award as it was awarded to Manchester City keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.\nDespite Alisson missing out on the award, Natalia posted online: \"so proud of you\" as she used a red love heart emoji to show the love and appreciation for her partner.",
