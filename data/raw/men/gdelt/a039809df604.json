Expect the ex-Inter goalkeeper to be the Red Devils' number one for a long time.\nRWB: Kieran Trippier - The first new face in this lineup is a pretty familiar one to Southgate. The England international has long been a favourite and, with rumours swirling about Newcastle United's need to sell their captain due to FFP concerns, he could be a cheap option for Man Utd.\nCB: Jean-Clair Todibo - From a cheap option to a slightly more expensive one. The INEOS-owned centre-back has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford and would slot perfectly into Southgate's five-man defence, providing some pacy cover for Trippier on the right-hand side.\nCB: Harry Maguire - New contract, reinstated as captain, statue outside Old Trafford. If Southgate takes over, Maguire is getting the lot.\nCB: Lisandro Martinez - When fit, Martinez is arguably the most important player in Erik ten Hag's current team, and we'd expect the Argentine to hold similar importance to a Southgate side too.\nLWB: Luke Shaw - Another player of huge importance when fit, Shaw is one of the best left-backs in the Premier League on his day. He was vital to Southgate's England team in the past, scoring in the Euro 2020 final and everything (a final England famously lost).\nCM: Kobbie Mainoo - Southgate has quite the soft spot for Mason Mount, but there's no way that he could drop Mainoo. The youngster has been one of the few bright spots in Man Utd's 2023/24 campaign and looks set to become a genuine superstar in the very near future.\nCM: Kalvin Phillips - Stop laughing! With literally any other manager in the world at the helm, Kalvin Phillips to Man Utd would be an utterly proposterous signing to suggest. Under Southgate though, it's not. The England manager is Phillips' biggest fan, and has relentlessly called him up for squads regardless of how much, or little, football he's played at club level.\nRW: Bruno Fernandes - With Southgate favouring playing deeper-lying midfielders, Bruno Fernandes could find himself shifted out to the right flank. Such a move won't be the end of the world for the Portugal international, he's impressed when he's occasionally played out wide for United in the past.\nST: Rasmus Hojlund - The Red Devils have been linked with plenty of forwards in recent times, but they'd be remiss not to keep the faith in the young Rasmus Hojlund. When fit, the Danish striker has been fantastic in recent months.\nLW: Marcus Rashford - As the sixth most capped player of the Southgate era, it's fair to say that the manager fully trusts Rashford. Only two players (Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane) have scored more goals under Southgate for England, so expect him to be key under him in Manchester too.",
