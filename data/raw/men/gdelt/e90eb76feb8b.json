  "body_text": "Manchester City defensive midfielder, Rodri, has issued a warning about a potential strike from footballers.\nAccording to him, players across Europe feel it is the right measure to take if the issue of fixture congestion continues to persist.\nRodri said that footballers would not hesitate to refuse to play if those in charge of football continue to increase the number of games season after season, adding that players are suffering.\nThis was after a revamped format of the UEFA Champions League which now sees teams play eight group-stage games instead of six.\nThe Club World Cup has also seen some changes with teams also set to play more games with 32 participating teams.\nThis means that top European sides like Manchester City, where Rodri plays, could end up playing over 70 games per season.\nAsked if players could potentially stage a protest against the fixture scheduling by going on strike, the Spain International said via Mirror, “I think we’re close to that.\n“It’s the general opinion of the players, and if it keeps this way, we’ll have no other option. I really think it’s something that worries us. We are the guys who suffer.\n“From my experience, I can tell you that 60 or 70 games – no. Between 40 and 50 is the amount of games in which a player can perform at the highest level. After that, you drop because it’s impossible to sustain the physical level.”\nClick to signup for FREE news updates, latest information and hottest gists everydayAdvertise on NigerianEye.com to reach thousands of our daily users",
