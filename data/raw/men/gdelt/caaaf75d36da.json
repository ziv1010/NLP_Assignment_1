We've got you covered. Bournemouth vs Tottenham is on TNT Sports in the UK. Brit abroad? Use a VPN to watch the Premier League with your subscription from anywhere.\nBournemouth are still awaiting their first Premier League win under new manager Andoni Iraola, but they have produced some promising performances so far.\nThey kicked off the new term with a 1-1 draw at home to West Ham, before heading to Anfield to face Liverpool. Despite losing 3-1, Bournemouth dominated the early proceedings and arguably should have been more goals ahead. The signs are encouraging, though, regardless of the results at the moment.\nTottenham, meanwhile, have plenty of positivity surrounding them at the moment, with Ange Postecoglou developing a feel-good spirit at the club. A 2-2 draw with Brentford on opening day was followed up with a 2-0 victory against Manchester United at home last weekend, and their Australian manager will certainly want to build on their form.\nKick-off is at 12.30pm BST. Make sure you know how to watch the Premier League wherever you are.\nTeam news\nBournemouth are missing a number of players at the start of this season, with new signings Alex Scott and Tyler Adams out, alongside Ryan Fredericks, Lewis Cook, Adam Smith, Dango Outtara and Marcus Tavernier. Lloyd Kelly does make his return, though.\nRyan Sessegnon, Bryan Gil and Rodrigo Bentancur are all out for Spurs, with the first two not expected to return until October at least. James Maddison finished the win over Manchester United last weekend with a protective boot on his foot, but is in the XI for the game against Bournemouth.\nBournemouth XI: Neto; Aarons, Zabarnyi, Kelly, Kerkez; Christie, Rothwell; Semenyo, Billing, Kluivert; Solanke.\nTottenham XI: Vicario; Porro, Romero, van de Ven, Udogie; Sarr, Bissouma; Kulusevski, Maddison, Son; Richarlison.\nForm\nBournemouth: DL\nTottenham: DW\nReferee\nTim Robinson will be the referee for Bournemouth vs Tottenham.

John Brooks is the VAR, with Darren Cann the assistant VAR.\nStadium\nBournemouth vs Tottenham will be played at the Vitality Stadium in Bournemouth, which has a capacity of 11,379.\nKick-off and channel\nBournemouth vs Tottenham kick-off is at 12.30pm BST on Saturday 26 August in the UK.

See below for international broadcast options.\nVPN guide\nUse a VPN to watch Premier League football from outside your country\nIf you’re out of the country for a Premier League fixture, then you won't be able to watch on your domestic streaming service as usual. The broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!) and blocks you from watching it. You can use a VPN to get around that, though, without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and will let you watch. And all the info going between is entirely encrypted, anonymous and safe – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there. For the Premier League, FourFourTwo currently recommends:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS5 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price.
