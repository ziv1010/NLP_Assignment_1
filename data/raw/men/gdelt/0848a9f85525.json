It’s in the name!\nA Por La 15th? : 24 April 2023\nMonday Edition of The Daily Merengue\nShoutout to the mods who do a fantastic job, Valyrian Steel, Felipejack, Juninho, NeRObutBlanco and yours truly, Kung_Fu_Zizou\nSo close, yet so far\nReal Madrid are 3 games away from a 15th Champions league title. It’s impossible as usual to not be excited about the prospect of another unforgettable triumph. The hurdle this time is a Man City side who will believe, they have fixed their major weakness in offense by recruiting the juggernaut aka Erling Haaland. Last season, City’s loss could be rightly chalked up to their inability to put away that second goal at the Bernabeu. Real Madrid on the other hand have maintained their tendency to concede chances.\nVini’s CL?\nLast season Karim’s impeccable form in the CL captured the imagination. This season, Karim’s fitness struggles have pushed Vinicius to the fore once more. If Real Madrid is going to win the CL this season, it will be down to Vinicius. With 6 goals and 6 assists so far in the CL out of 40 G/A for the season so far, Vinicius is once again arguably the best player in the world.\nPhenomenal\nIf you were lucky enough to watch this game as a Real Madrid fan and the build-up to the game which set the stage.. Special moments.\nThe Daily Poll\nPoll 1\nPoll 2",
