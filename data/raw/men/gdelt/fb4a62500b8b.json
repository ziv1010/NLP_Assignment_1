  "body_text": "Our 3-2 victory over Kairat Almaty in the Champions League not only ensured we finished top of the league phase table, but ensured Mikel Arteta's side went down in history.\nHaving set our longest-ever winning streak in our European history against Inter Milan the previous week, we extended that run against the Kazakhstan side, winning all eight of our matches and becoming the first team in the competition's history to finish the league stage with the maximum 24-point haul.\nBut how does our current compare to the rest of Europe? We've delved into the numbers to assess just how impressive an achievement it is:\nour hot streak assessed\nWe kicked off our campaign with a 2-0 victory against Athletic Club, courtesy of super subs Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard, to give us all three points in Bilbao. That was followed by two home successes: a 2-0 win over Greek giants Olympiacos, and a 4-0 blitz of Atletico Madrid.\nA Bukayo Saka penalty and a double from Mikel Merino gave us a 3-0 win against Slavia Prague before a special night in N5 as we downed Bayern Munich 3-1 as Jurrien Timber, Noni Madueke and Martinelli got on the scoresheet against the side who finished directly behind us in the table.\nMadueke and Martinelli continued their scoring form by netting all three goals in a 3-0 win over Club Brugge before we made it seven in a row against Inter Milan at the San Siro, when Gabriel Jesus scored twice before Viktor Gyokeres sealed the points. The Swede also kick-started our 3-2 win over Kairat, with Kai Havertz and Martinelli also on target.\nKairat's late consolation was the first time we had won a game by less than two goals during the league phase, meaning we are one of only two teams in European Cup and Champions League history to have won seven games in a row by two or more goals, equalling the feats of Bayern Munich's swashbuckling 2019/20 side.\nMeanwhile, Martinelli's strike means only Thierry Henry (7 in 2001/02 and 2002/03) has scored more goals for us in a single edition of the competition than the Brazilian:\nAs well as being the first team to finish the league phase with a 100% record, the eight wins in a row have become the best winning streak in our European history, surpassing six-match winning runs in the 2005/06 Champions League campaign that saw us reach the final, and the 2020/21 Europa League group stages.\nIt is also the first time we have ever completed a Champions League group or league phase with a perfect record, having never won all six of our group matches in the previous incarnation of the competition.\ncompared to the rest\nWe are on the hottest win streak in Europe's premier competition right now, but how does it stack up with some of the longest runs in the European Cup since its inception 71 years ago?\nCurrently, six-time winners Bayern Munich hold the record for the longest winning run, amassing an incredible 15 games in a row between September 2019 and November 2020.\nThe German giants' 10-game winning streak in 2013 is second on the list, tied with Real Madrid's across 2014 and 2015 and Manchester City's from 2023-2024.\nMeanwhile, only one English side has enjoyed a longer winning streak in European Cup or Champions League history, with Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City winning 10 in a row between May 2023 and March 2024:\nunbeaten runs\nAs well as big winning runs, we've also enjoyed our fair share of unbeaten runs across a host of European competitions.\nOur longest unbeaten run comes in the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. We went all the way in the 1993/94 edition, beating Parma in the final, and continued into the following season's semi-final stage when we lost to Sampdoria, but still progressed to the final, where we came unstuck against Zaragoza.\nOther unbeaten spells include a 13-game run in our 2005/06 run to the Champions League final, and a 10-game unbeaten run in the UEFA Cup in 2000.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
