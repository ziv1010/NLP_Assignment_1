This day is amazing, historic for me and my family, my friends. I expected to have a great day but it has been much better than expected.\n“It was my dream when I was a kid, I’ve been waiting for this moment for so long and now it has become true, that dream. I knew that my destiny was to play for Real Madrid and it would happen one day.”\nMadrid had earlier posted a photograph of the France superstar posing in front of the club’s 15 replica Champions League trophies alongside Perez as he became manager Carlo Ancelotti’s latest and much sought-after recruit.\nMbappe highlighted his first priority as getting to know his team-mates and settling into the side.\n“I’m here with ambition,” he said. “These are the values of the club, humility and ambition and always a will to win.\n“I think the priority right now is to get along with the team, to match the team and I think that, when this happens, everything is going to be much easier because I’m going to play for a great club and I want to adapt to it as soon as possible to help the team.”\nThe Spanish champions have been long-time admirers of one of world football’s most prodigious talents and made a concerted effort to sign him last summer as he prepared to enter the final year of his contract at PSG.\nDespite winning six Ligue 1 titles and four French Cups during a stay that encompassed 308 appearances and 256 goals, he and PSG never got their hands on the Champions League trophy, something he will hope to be able to remedy during his time in the Spanish capital.\n“I was close to coming to Real Madrid two years ago and three years ago, too,” said Mbappe. “The past is past, many things have happened. I want to focus on the present, I want to focus on what I’m going to live every second here.\n“I think this is the best place to win titles. If I can fit with the system, the next things will come in a natural way so my priority and my energy is for that.\n“Of course I want to win the Champions League, the cup, the league, everything’s a goal, but these are goals in the long run. Now I have to train again and I have to adapt to the team.”\nOne complicating factor is the broken nose Mbappe suffered in France’s opening game of the Euros, which could potentially delay his debut.\n“We are in touch with the medical staff,” he said. “I’m fully available for the club, of course, they are the ones who are going to give more information in the following days when they get every result.\n“Now I’m going to go on holiday and when I come back they’ll tell me how to prepare to help the team as fast as possible.”",
