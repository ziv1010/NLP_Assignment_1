  "body_text": "Rio Ngumoha swapped Chelsea’s Academy for Liverpool’s a couple years ago, leaving the club that he joined as an 8-year-old, believing that he would have a better pathway to first-team football on Merseyside.\nLiverpool to pay Chelsea £2.8+4m in compensation for 2024 Rio Ngumoha signing — report\nBusiness time\nJury’s still out on whether that’s the case. He’s got 400 minutes so far this season, which is not bad for a 17-year-old, but less than even Tyrique George this season (and certainly much, much less than George last season). But he’s already become their youngest goalscorer ever (his only professional goal so far) and also their youngest ever player in the Champions League, so he’s certainly off to a good start.\nBecause Rio was still just 15 when he moved — and Chelsea were none too happy with Liverpool poaching him — there was no transfer fee involved. Instead, the matter was referred to a tribunal, which finally got around to setting one, some 18 months later.\nAccording to The Athletic, Liverpool have been ordered to pay £2.8m, with an additional £4m in performance- and appearance-related bonuses. Not much, though Chelsea will also receive 20 per cent of any profit booked by Liverpool should Ngumoha transfer to another club, and that could be a significant amount if he does fulfill his potential.",
