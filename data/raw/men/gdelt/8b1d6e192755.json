Obviously it was bad that (Lewis) got sent off. I didn’t check the tackle yet, I don’t know if it’s a correct one or not, but what I can say is it was a good goal, it gave us a point, which is better than zero, but we have to do better.\n“Of course it’s never easy to play with one less player. We still tried to go for it, and we had a few moments where we could have damaged them a little bit more, even with 10 men.\n“When we’re all together, when the team is complete, we’re much, much stronger. That’s no excuse, but we have to make an effort to bring back the players as quickly as possible, because with the schedules nowadays, it’s just difficult to cope with.\n“We’re just 12, 13 players and some of them are not even 100 per cent fit.”",
