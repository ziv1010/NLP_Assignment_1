Oli McBurnie played the ball to Moleiro and the 20-year-old got past Airelien Tchouameni with a brilliant first touch before getting the better of a wrong-footed Eder Militao, and then slotted home past Thibaut Courtois.\nMid-way through the first-half, Federico Valverde tested the home goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen with a well-worked fee-kick. Eight minutes from break, the 35-year-old made a stunning diving save to keep out Rudiger's dipping long ranger. The visitors ended the opening half with nine shots to their name.\nTen minutes into the second half, Las Palmas created a rare goal-scoring chance as Kirian Rodriguez played a lovely through ball to find the run of Sandro Ramirez, but the 29-year-old's effort went over the bar. In the 65th-minute Alex Suarez was adjudged to have handled the ball inside the box and referee referee pointed to the spot.\nVinicius stepped up and fired home past Cillessen. Meanwhile Las Palmas had a late goal ruled out for off side and the points were shared.\nMbappe is yet to score in three La Liga games since moving from PSG this summer.\nReal Madrid's will next play host to Real Betis at Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday (September 1) before dispersing for the international break. After three games, Carlo Ancelotti's side are sitting at the fifth spot in the La Liga standings, with five points to their name.\nAlso read:\nEuropa Conference League 2024-25: Chelsea go through to group stage despite losing 2-1 against Servette\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
