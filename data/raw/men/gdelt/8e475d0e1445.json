In the end, it was AS Roma who lured the sporting director, recognised as the best in his field at the time, to Italy in a season where they progressed to the Champions League semi-finals.\nSevilla’s success had been watched with interest across Europe as, in the years after Monchi’s appointment in 2000, they went from a club who had won only seven trophies in their history to a feared force both domestically and in UEFA competition.\nArsenal even considered pairing both experts together in the hope that Emery’s managerial excellence mixed with Monchi’s talent-spotting nous would be a game-changing combination in England.\nAs it turned out, Monchi, unlike Emery, never fully fancied moving to north London despite the club going as far as organising accommodation for him.\nWhen Arsenal came calling after a failed spell under an intense spotlight in Rome, he instead decided to return to Sevilla.\nEmery was far from the hit so many predicted away from Sevilla, either. But he has since re-established his reputation as an elite coach after winning another Europa League at Villarreal and then guiding the Spanish club to the Champions League semi-final in 2022. His work over the past eight months at Aston Villa has silenced critics with an interest in the Premier League and recent history arguably suggests his time at PSG and Arsenal was not as bad as many made out.\nSporting directors, like managers, can have periods of struggle but still be supremely good at what they do.\nSevilla, with Monchi restored, might have flirted with relegation from La Liga for a chunk of last season, but the mystical power they have in the Europa League again prevailed. Since 2005-06, they have collected 11 trophies, including seven UEFA Cups or Europa Leagues — all of them on Monchi’s watch.\nThe 54-year-old’s ability to spot and sign players at bargain prices, then sell many of them on when their value is highest, has also been the envy of many clubs across Europe. He built Sevilla’s scouting system, staffed it with loyal people and created a database that has proven more often than not to find players worthy of trophy winning teams.\nAdvertisement\nBut it is not a powerhouse club taking on his expertise and giving him the platform to turn 2023-24 into a memorable season.\nInstead, it is Aston Villa — ambitious and upwardly mobile — who have thrust Monchi and Emery back together.\nLengthy and complex negotiations were finally wrapped up on Friday as Villa struck an agreement to reunite Monchi with the coach he knows so well. He will be Villa’s new president of football operations, signing a three-year contract and starting in July with Damian Vidagany taking on the role of director of football. Johan Lange stays on in a senior role as director of football development and international academies.\nNow it remains to be seen whether a partnership that once had all the big clubs in the world talking can flourish again.\nAt first glance, it feels a little strange that Villa, a club who had not managed a top-half finish in the Premier League for 12 years until last time round, have been able to lure two figureheads recognised as being among the best in the business only a few years ago.\nBut this is a new-look Villa whose grand plans under owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens (NSWE) are starting to take shape.\nHow this ends up will be fascinating. Only time will tell if such a move is indeed a masterstroke, or one instigated years too late. Whether Monchi still has the magic that served him so well over the last two decades will be key as other forward-thinking clubs start to set a new tone.\nIn the short time that Emery has been at the club, Villa have moved from the lower reaches of the Premier League into seventh with a points-per-game record that would have been good enough for a top-four finish if sustained over a full season.\nVilla had a strong structure already in place but decided to break up the old way of working by allowing CEO Christian Purslow to leave.\nAdvertisement\nNSWE have handed over more power to Emery, who will run the football department with Monchi and Vidagany with new president of business operations, Chris Heck, overseeing all important off-field matters.\nSo is Monchi, the man hand-picked by Emery, the final piece of the jigsaw?\nEmery, who will work closely with Sawiris as he takes on a more hands-on role, certainly feels so.\nThe manager was told he could bring in a director-of-football-type figure when he agreed to the challenge of moving Villa up the table back in November.\nIt’s no secret that Mateu Alemany was the man Villa initially pushed for to fill this position. There was hope that Barcelona’s football director would fancy the challenge of joining but, ultimately, the security of staying at an already-established giant and continuing the project he had started was too great from which to walk away.\nGO DEEPER\nAston Villa and Mateu Alemany - a setback, yes, but not enough to derail Project Emery\nYet a man of Monchi’s stature hardly feels like second best. Villa are securing an experienced operator who knows Emery well enough to assist him with everything he needs. The pair worked well together at Sevilla without overly relying on one another. Monchi quickly understood the type of player Emery wanted and was able to deliver key additions, often at bargain prices.\nCarlos Bacca was secured from Club Bruges for €7million (£6m; $7.7m) and was prolific before joining AC Milan for over four times that amount two years later. Grzegorz Krychowiak, signed from Reims, was a strong presence in midfield and would subsequently follow Emery to PSG. Aleix Vidal joined from Almeria and was sold on at a considerable profit to Barcelona after one successful season.\nMonchi was clear in his message to Sevilla when Villa came calling this summer. He wanted to leave even though a number of signings had already been lined up and plans for next season were in place.\nAdvertisement\nThere was a sense of anger and frustration inside the club. His exit came as a surprise on the back of another Europa League victory.\nSevilla’s president, Jose Castro said publicly that he was “praying” he would stay, but it quickly became clear where his focus was fixed.\nWhile the Emery-Monchi dream team has never been tested outside Sevilla, the hard work Emery has put in to build on an already strong set-up at Villa will give his former colleague a head start in his new role.\nVilla have a talented squad with players all around the peak ages of their career. Some of the deadwood needs to be shifted and decisions in the transfer window this summer will determine how long the team can compete in the Premier League, Europa Conference League and the two domestic cup competitions next season.\nBut a list of targets has already been drawn up and the emphasis will not be on scouring the globe for players Villa can sell on at a premium; a mission that worked well in the early days at Sevilla.\nThe owners NSWE want to achieve success in the quickest and cheapest way possible, so discovering hidden talent would be an advantage, but the bottom line is there will be money to spend on players proven already at a high level, as well as a realisation that it will still take some time to catch up with the big-hitting teams in the Premier League and the rest of Europe.\nThat’s useful for the once-pioneering Monchi, who got ahead of the rest through sophisticated scouting and statistical data analysis.\nHis database often had lists of up to 10 options for each position and was pulled together through a trusted team of scouts across the world.\nThrough meticulous, painstaking research, he is famous for picking out Dani Alves, Ivan Rakitic, Freddie Kanoute, Julio Baptista and Luis Fabiano — players who thrived at Sevilla before furthering their careers and reputations elsewhere.\nAdvertisement\nOften overlooked is how he also had to sell the likes of Sergio Ramos, Jesus Navas, Luis Alberto and Jose Antonio Reyes but found replacements to keep Sevilla competitive. The club went through spells of success with different groups of talented players and regularly competed in the Champions League.\nGO DEEPER\nMonchi’s secrets (including why he tells players not to drive green cars)\nTimes have moved on now, though, and plenty of other clubs — including perceived smaller teams such as Brighton & Hove Albion and Brentford in the Premier League — have caught up through creative recruitment strategies of their own.\nWhile Sevilla were still able to win the Europa League last month and qualify for next year’s Champions League, there were far too many low points for a club who had grown accustomed to giving the big boys a run for their money.\nLast summer was a disaster in the market. They sold both Jules Kounde and Diego Carlos (the latter to Villa) but could not replace either adequately. Monchi decided on Tanguy Nianzou, a youngster from Bayern Munich, who ultimately has shown he is not yet ready for life at this level, and Marcao from Galatasaray. The latter started only four league games because of injury.\nThe January signing of Loic Bade from Rennes helped make amends and added to Monchi’s success stories when picking talent from France. Over the years, some of his best selections have been plucked from this market, and it will be interesting to see whether he turns to that particular pool of players in the early weeks of this new adventure at Villa.\nWhether supporters will hear from him is not yet known. His understanding of the English language is said to be basic from those who have dealt with him, but sharp enough to assist.\nHis predecessor, Lange — a man of little ego — has been comfortable outside of the media spotlight and would allow Purslow to do the talking in public when it was needed. The Dane has not conducted a single in-depth interview since joining Villa in 2020.\nBut Monchi is a very different character.\nAdvertisement\nThose who have worked with him say he likes to focus on his success stories. He gets emotionally attached, too, and has been known to rant at reporters for what he perceives to be unfair criticism. At times last season, he was seen pleading with supporters after defeats. On one occasion, he cried in the stands when Sevilla wrapped up a victory. Yet, for a man once considered a master in his trade, he hardly leaves behind a squad crammed with players of significant value.\nSevilla have 12 squad members in the 30 to 37 age bracket. They have the fifth-oldest team in the five elite European leagues and the second-oldest in Spain with an average age of 28.7.\nUntil he proves otherwise — and Villa will be his chance — he will always be beaten with a stick that says he can only build a team within the comfortable surroundings of Sevilla.\nHis one time away from the club, in the pressure-cooker environment of Roma, was a huge anti-climax. So bad were the signings he recommended, former owner Jim Pallotta described the process of looking back at his list of players as a “f****** nightmare’” when discussing that period with The Athletic.\nRoma sold key players but were unable to find suitable replacements.\nMohamed Salah departed to Liverpool for €42.5million, which was initially thought of as exorbitant in England but soon made to look cheap. In truth, Salah would have left regardless of whoever was calling the shots in recruitment, but it was the subsequent work of Monchi when sourcing new arrivals that drew heavy criticism.\nJavier Pastore, a €24.7million Argentinean midfielder, was supposed to help fill the gap left by Salah, but quickly became considered an expensive mistake.\nSigning Patrik Schick from Sampdoria for almost €42million — a club record fee that eclipsed that once paid for Gabriel Batistuta — alongside Steven N’Zonzi from Sevilla for €26.63million backfired. Robin Olsen, the goalkeeper who has under-performed at Villa since his move from Roma, was also the chosen replacement for Allison; another dubious decision, although keeping hold of the Brazil goalkeeper, now among the best in the world, was always a challenge when Liverpool came calling.\nThose mistakes meant that, aside from Bryan Crisante, the bulk of Roma’s big-money signings fell way short of expectations.\nAdvertisement\nWhat also went against Monchi was his decision to back the under-pressure coach Eusebio Di Francesco when the going got tough and the club were looking for a way out. Roma expected him to offer up multiple coaching options to consider — a reason he was given so much power in the job in the first place — but there was no alternative plan ever put forward.\nMonchi ended up leaving Roma two years into a four-year deal. That remains his solitary taste of life in this role away from Sevilla.\nJudging him on one experience, especially in the goldfish bowl of Rome, would be a little short-sighted. Sevilla, it is worth noting, were also far from the same side without him. They won nothing in the two seasons he spent away but they duly claimed another Europa League in his first campaign back.\nNow NSWE expect him to build upon the eye-catching success of last season’s seventh-place finish.\nThere are some similarities between Roma and Villa. Neither can compete with the top clubs in the world when it comes to recruitment. Both have to battle to make an impression in their own domestic league. Both have to find ways to increase revenue streams to be more aggressive in the transfer market. And yet, in Birmingham, the pressure on Monchi will not be as intense.\nNSWE are prepared to loosen the wage structure to help attract the next level of player, and if that still means the occasional snub — as endured when Marco Asensio chose PSG instead of Villa upon his release from Real Madrid earlier this summer — then so be it.\nCrucially, there is a significant pull at Villa now.\nYouri Tielemans chose them ahead of both AC Milan and Roma, largely because of the huge contract he was offered as a free transfer signing. But there was also the draw of playing for a club on the up, under a manager with a history of improving players, and the additional excitement of a European adventure — albeit only in the Europa Conference League.\nVilla already have a strong squad without the need for major summer surgery, so Monchi can get stuck into using the rest of his expertise to help continue moving the club forward.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough he is an emotional character, having an experienced operator like Monchi on board will allow Emery to focus on what he does best: coaching, picking apart opponents and working on a number of tactical plans to turn to in games.\nThat they know each other well is an advantage and only adds to the growing power the Spanish now have at Bodymoor Heath.\nEmery brought with him a large coaching team, including his personal assistant Damian Vidagany, who already assists in day-to-day operations and team-building tasks but now has increased responsibility. Long-term allies Alberto Benito and Pablo Rodriguez have joined the recruitment team, too, and will be influential in identifying targets and getting deals over the line.\nVilla are expected to recruit from La Liga to build on the capture of Tielemans.\nVillarreal’s Pau Torres and Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams are known targets of whom the recruitment team are fond, but now Monchi will add his valuable input and start assisting Emery in a way that worked so well when they were together at Sevilla.\nThe hope, internally, is that Monchi fits in as seamlessly as Emery and his staff have since arriving last October. Longer-serving staff at Villa talk about a hard-working coaching team, but also a group of friendly, affable characters who go out for lunch with staff to help build a family feeling.\nMonchi and Emery have pulled it all together before and it was always likely they would link up again someday.\nAston Villa, in England’s Second City of Birmingham, may not have been the most obvious location for that reunion. But this is a club where people are starting to believe again, and that suits two of the game’s big dreamers down to the ground.\n(Top photo: Jose Breton/Pics Action/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
