  "body_text": "Timothy Tillman was considered one of German football’s most exciting youth prospects, leaving Greuther Fürth for Bayern Munich at 16 years old to the dismay of Fürth president Helmut Hack, who said he was “the biggest talent we have had for 30 years. His departure is a catastrophe for our club.”\nWhile at Bayern, intrigue about the midfielder — who goes by Timmy — continued. The club fielded interest from Barcelona and Real Madrid, according to various reports. From 2015 to 2018, he was also a fixture in Germany’s youth squads, where he primarily played on the wing in support of Kai Havertz. He was promoted to Bayern’s reserves in 2017, where he contributed with six goals and seven assists across 31 appearances in Germany’s fourth tier.\nAdvertisement\nAs a young player, Tillman’s German mother, with whom he has an “unbreakable” bond as “the most important person in his life,” helped mold him. The love of the game grew from the back garden of his Nuremberg home, where he spent countless hours playing football with his brother, Malik.\n“Our thoughts were always about football. We just didn’t care about any other stuff as much as we did about football,” Timothy Tillman told The Athletic. “We just enjoyed it anywhere we go. We just needed a ball with us, and we would have a good time. We would be entertained for the whole day.”\nLike notable USMNT figures John Brooks and Jermaine Jones, among others, Tillman’s father was a U.S. military serviceman stationed in Germany. Though he grew up in a single-parent household with his mother, Anja, and brother – who now represents the USMNT and Rangers, on loan from Bayern – the connection he had with the United States kept him intrigued with American culture from afar.\n“I came to the U.S. twice before this year, once on vacation and once on a trip with Bayern,” Tillman said. “From there, I always considered playing in MLS because I love the country, and the league is growing. I saw it as a challenge for me as a person and a player, so I had it in my mind to come here one day.”\nAs football evolved from a backyard hobby to an unforgiving profession, where talented players he had grown up with were being released to make way for new players from around the world, the pathway to the first team at Bayern became hazy. At that point, he was a tricky winger who modelled his game after former Manchester United, Portugal and Orlando City forward Nani. As a result, Tillman found himself behind Bayern legends Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery and the emerging Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman.\n“Moving to Bayern is not always easy,” said Tillman. “Of course, you have top players in your position, and you start to feel some pressure. So at that point, I just tried to keep a clear mind. My mom helped me a lot with that. She supported us in every way. And she always said, ‘No matter what, I’ll be proud of you.’ That’s what you need to hear, ‘You’re gonna be fine.'”\nAdvertisement\nWithout a clear route to progress beyond Bayern’s reserve team, Tillman returned home to play for Bundesliga side FC Nurnberg in 2018 on loan. He featured six times as the team was relegated to Bundesliga 2. To compound a difficult period, he suffered a ruptured ligament injury upon his return to Bayern, keeping him out of action until the January window, when he decided to re-join Greuther Fürth – the club where he enjoyed a sparkling period as a youngster.\n“One thing I always keep in my mind is that I don’t want to regret anything,” he said. “I own every choice I made. I never had any negative thoughts about moving back to Fürth. I was really excited about going there. I knew the club. I knew the city. I had some friends over there. I saw it as a perfect option to get back on track because, after the injury, I was ready to start in the second division or maybe with another team in the Bundesliga. I felt good, like I was back on track again.”\nDuring the 2020-21 season, Tillman helped Fürth reach the Bundesliga, featuring in 27 matches across all competitions. However, the team struggled last season, suffering relegation after being rooted to the bottom of Germany’s top division for much of the campaign.\nWhen LAFC came calling in January, it fulfilled an aspiration Tillman has had from childhood, growing up as a dual-national.\n“Growing up in Germany and looking like me, I never felt 100% German,” said Tillman. “I still grew up with my dad, so I had American food and listened to American music and stuff like that. I grew up German, but I always felt a connection to my roots.”\nIn this context, there was perhaps nobody better to sell him on LAFC and MLS than current head coach Steve Cherundolo, affectionately dubbed “the mayor of Hanover” after spending his entire professional playing career in Germany with Hannover 96. After retiring as a player, Cherundolo honed his coaching skills with the Hannover and German national team’s youth sides, where he helped develop Linton Maina, Tillman’s best friend in the youth national team set-up.\nAdvertisement\n“(Cherundolo’s) understanding of me was a big part of my decision to move here,” added Tillman. “I wanted the coach to trust me. I wanted to coach to know me as a player; I wanted him to know how I wanted to play. I want to help the team. I just wanted to feel right. And yeah, that’s what was the case here in LA.”\nIn Los Angeles, Tillman is arguably playing the best football of his career. The versatile No. 8 fits perfectly into Cherundolo’s midfield, combining athleticism of a 6-foot-1 stature with the technical quality of a player groomed as an attacker with Bayern and Germany. Through 13 games across MLS and the CONCACAF Champions League, he has registered three goals and two assists, his highest goal contribution rate since turning professional.\nPerhaps just as important as the raw numbers are where Tillman operates in LAFC’s system.\nDespite lining up in central midfield, the graphic above highlights his desire to operate in the half-space. His assist for Denis Bouanga’s second goal in the Champions League match against the Vancouver Whitecaps displayed his ability to impact the game in different positions, coming off the left touchline — a position he is comfortable with due to his development as a wide attacker —- and playing a pass between defenders into the striker’s feet, who finished with his left foot.\n⚽ What a goal! ⚫️🟡\nA brilliant performance from @BouangaDenis tonight!

From a coach’s perspective, Tillman’s goal against New England Revolution, in a match where he also registered an assist and won player of the match, is the most impressive. After spotting former LAFC midfielder Latif Blessing receiving the ball, blind to pressure behind him, Tillman quickly closed the gap and profitted off a poor touch, stealing the ball and firing past the goalkeeper with his weaker left foot. It was an individual play that highlighted his pace, anticipation and technical quality in a flash, detailing why the reigning MLS Cup champions took a gamble on a player who had not yet consistently displayed his potential as a professional.\nTimothy Tillman scored his first @MLS goal for @LAFC 💪 pic.twitter.com/LslUtGvhJx\n— FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) March 13, 2023\nNaturally, as a dual-national performing well in MLS, and with a brother already committed to the team, anticipation has risen within the U.S. soccer scene regarding Tillman’s international allegiance.\nMalik Tillman, who has featured for USMNT’s senior squad on four occasions, was more familiar to soccer fans in the United States before Timothy joined LAFC in February. Having first appeared for the USMNT’s U-15 squad in 2015, Malik, like Timothy, moved through the age ranks of Germany’s national team from U-15 to U-21 but applied for a one-time switch to represent the U.S. in May 2022.\nAdvertisement\nAfter a glowing endorsement from his brother, Timothy has now applied for the one-time switch, and, should it be approved by FIFA, he will be eligible for this summer’s Nations League and Gold Cup matches.\n“When (Malik) joined the senior national team, he told me how much he enjoyed being with the team. He only had positive words about it,” said Tillman. “I would be happy if I got called up, but it’s all in the coach’s hands. We’ll see. I’d be proud to represent the U.S. in any game.”\nWithout a permanent head coach, it is unclear whether the USMNT will operate with the 4-3-3 adopted by Gregg Berhalter. The first-choice midfield triumvirate there, Tyler Adams, Yunus Musah and Weston McKennie, all of whom play in top-5 European leagues, will be difficult to unseat.\nEncouragingly, though Tillman has displayed the ability to play several different roles inside the No. 8 position, with his complete midfield display in the Champions League semifinal second leg against Philadelphia Union, registering a goal, 24 out of 30 accurate passes (80% completion rate), two dribbles and a tackle won, demonstrating he is someone who can be relied upon in and out of possession in big matches.\nStill, Tillman’s feet remain firmly on the ground. At 24 years old, his best years are ahead of him in a club situation that he enjoys personally and professionally. If the quality performances continue, a move back to Europe could tempt him, but he is in no rush to make the trip across the Atlantic.\n“I enjoy being here a lot at the moment. I really like the club and everyone in and around the club. So yeah, I don’t want to think about the future too much,” said Tillman. “I want to bring more trophies to LA. That’s what I’m working on at the moment.”\n(Photo: Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports; Design: Samuel Richardson)",
