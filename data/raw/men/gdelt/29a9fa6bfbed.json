  "body_text": "Alexander Isak: Arsenal, Barcelona, Chelsea & Liverpool learn Newcastle's asking price\n- Alexander Isak's prolific form for Newcastle has created plenty of suitors\n- The 25-year-old is thought to be keen on a transfer this summer\n- Magpies are demanding a club record sum to sell Sweden international\nNewcastle United are expected to demand more than €100m (£83m) for their star striker Alexander Isak, who is pushing for a move away this summer according to a report in Spain.\nIsak has been in staggering form this season. In a rare campaign devoid of any serious injuries, the rubbery Swede has rattled in 17 goals across 23 Premier League appearances, including a run of eight consecutive games with a goal on either side of the new year.\nSuch a prolific burst of form - which doesn't even capture the intangible impact he has on the rest of Newcastle's team - has prompted Magpies boss Eddie Howe to gush: \"I love working with Alex and I wouldn't swap him for anyone.\"\nThat decision may be taken out of Howe's hands this summer. Isak is thought to be very keen on moving to one of Europe's elite clubs, per SPORT. The Spanish publication notes that Arsenal, Barcelona, Chelsea and Liverpool are all interested in snapping up the 25-year-old, but they would have to part ways with at least €100m (£83m) for the privilege of the striker's signature.\nIf a club is willing to match that lofty asking price, Isak would become Newcastle's most expensive sale ever, the costliest Swedish player in football history and only the 17th individual to command a sum of €100m or more.\nIsak's current deal at Newcastle stretches to the summer of 2028 and there is no suggestion that it includes any release clauses. Other sources report that the Magpies could demand as much as £150m for their talisman, but SPORT claims that such an exorbitant fee will only be required in the event that Newcastle qualify for next season's Champions League.\nThe Northern giants will not countenance the possibility of approaching Europe's premier club competition without Isak.\nDefeat to Manchester City last weekend left Newcastle in seventh place, three points adrift of the reigning top-flight champions in fourth. However, if English clubs continue to advance in UEFA's various club competitions this season, the Premier League's top five (rather than four) will automatically qualify for the expanded Champions League. Newcastle trail fifth-placed Bournemouth by two points - although Chelsea are very much in the race as well.",
