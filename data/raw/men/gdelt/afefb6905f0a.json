More transfers are expected to be completed ahead of the 11pm deadline, with Pablo Fornals expected to leave West Ham to join Real Betis.\nFulham are understood to be chasing a loan deal for Chelsea striker Armando Broja and PA understands West Ham’s Pablo Fornals has permission to discuss a £7million move to Real Betis.\nRibeiro came through the ranks in Lisbon and made his professional debut for the club as a late substitute in a Champions League tie against Manchester City in March 2022.\nThe 18-year-old’s move to Forest could become permanent. He told the club’s YouTube channel: “It is a great opportunity for me.\n“It is the best league in the world. For me, it is a dream to play in this league and for this club.\n“I promise to work every day and to keep going with the work and help the team.”\nRogers, 21, signed for Boro last summer and scored seven goals this season, including against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final.\nVilla also later announced the signing of England Under-19 international Lino Sousa from Arsenal, who is set to immediately join up with Plymouth on loan for the remainder of the campaign.\nNewcastle also made a move for the future with the signing of 18-year-old Manchester City midfielder Harrison for an undisclosed fee.\n“The size of the club and what it has got going for it is massive for me,” Harrison told Newcastle’s website.\n“It has got a huge, passionate fanbase and I’m looking to really push on with my career now.”\nIn the Sky Bet Championship, midfielder Alex Pritchard completed his move from Sunderland to Birmingham for an undisclosed fee.\nThe 30-year-old has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract to reunite with former Black Cats boss Tony Mowbray.\n“I am happy,” Pritchard told BluesTV.\n“My future has been well speculated for a while now and I am just glad to get everything done and just settled and, hopefully, I can just crack on with football.”\nSunderland reacted quickly to fill the gap in their squad, signing winger Romaine Mundle from Standard Liege for an undisclosed fee.\nThe 20-year-old former Tottenham player has signed a four-and-a-half-year contract at the Stadium of Light.\nHull have been one of the most active Championship clubs on deadline day, with midfielder Abdulkadir Omur joining from Trabzonspor.\nTurkish international Omur has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal after he joined for an undisclosed fee, while Dogukan Sinik has been allowed to make a loan move to Hatayspor.\n“The fans will love watching him (Omur),” Hull boss Liam Rosenior said on the club website.\n“He is someone who can unlock the door, create and score goals, and has a great final pass and shot.\n“He is an outstanding technical footballer who can go past players, has a low centre of gravity and works hard out of possession. I love his football personality.”\nSwansea have brought in young forward Charles Sagoe Jr depart on a six-month loan from Arsenal.",
