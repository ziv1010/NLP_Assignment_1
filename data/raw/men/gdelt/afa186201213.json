Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nThe report claims the ‘goal’ for PSG’s coaching and medical staff is ‘clear’: get Dembele back to full fitness so he can return to the squad or even start against the Gunners.\nOnly four players – Serhou Guirassy (13), Raphinha (12), Harry Kane (11), and Robert Lewandowski (11) – have outscored Dembele (8) in Europe’s premier competition this season.\nThe France international has enjoyed a remarkable run of form having been dropped for PSG’s league phase contest with Arsenal in October after arriving late for a team meeting.\n‘When you listen to Luis Enrique, he says that the best decision he made was to punish him that day because he transformed him and he became a different player since then and scored all these goals,’ ex-Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger told beIN SPORTS ahead of Wednesday’s meeting.\n‘Then, I would say Vitinha became the boss in the middle of the park and gave them the stability in possession.\n‘You know that Luis Enrique wants to have possession and they transformed their midfield with Joao Neves, Vitinha and Fabian Ruiz. It’s a little bit of a Spanish midfield, playing-wise.\n‘They have the better balance now because Nuno Mendes on the one flank and Achraf Hakimi on the other have been exceptional in the Champions League.’\nThere had been some concern over a possible foot injury to Martin Odegaard after the Arsenal captain was seen limping his way off the field in the wake of the side’s loss to Bournemouth.\nBut speaking in the mixed zone after the match, the Norwegian was quick to play down fears over fitness.\n‘Yeah, I think it’s okay,’ Odegaard told NBC Sports.\n‘It was just a hit so it is a bit sore but it is fine.’\nJurrien Timber remains a doubt for the return leg after missing the defeat to the Cherries.\nMore Trending\nHowever, Arsenal will be boosted by Thomas Partey’s presence in midfield after the Ghanian was ruled out of the first PSG game through suspension.\n‘Thomas is a great player and it’s great to have him behind you,’ Odegaard said when quizzed on the possible impact of Partey’s return.\n‘He always gives you that protection. He’s so strong in the duels and good on the ball as well.\n‘It’s going to be a nice boost for us to have him for that game.’\nWho will win this year's Champions League?\n-\nArsenal\n-\nPSG\n-\nBarcelona\n-\nInter Milan\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: William Saliba’s stance on Real Madrid revealed after approach for Arsenal star\nMORE: Arsene Wenger calls for major rule change ahead of likely Man Utd vs Tottenham final\nMORE: Gerwyn Price is dreaming of a Premier League Darts and Greyhound Derby double success",
