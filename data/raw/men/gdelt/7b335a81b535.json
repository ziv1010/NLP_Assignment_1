  "body_text": "Jess Carter, a Chelsea legend and one of the most elite defenders in the world, has moved on to the next stage of her football career.\nOn Monday, the versatile English international became the second West Londoner since April to join the reigning National Women's Soccer League champions, NJ/NY Gotham FC.\nCarter, who signed a three-year contract extension to stay with the Women's Super League powerhouse in 2022, inked a contract with the East Coast outfit through the 2026 campaign following the club sending an undisclosed fee Chelsea's way.\n“I cannot wait to join Gotham FC,” Carter said. “The club is playing at an incredible level right now in one of the toughest leagues in the world. I cannot wait to be a part of it all.”\nCarter came to Chelsea from Birmingham City FC in June 2018, brimming with potential. Though not a consistent starter from the jump, she developed into a defensive cornerstone for one of the world's top women's clubs under the no-nonsense guidance of Emma Hayes. Across six seasons, the 26-year-old won 11 trophies including five Women's Super League titles and three FA Cups.\nIndividually, Carter earned a place in last season's UEFA Women's Champions League Team of the Season and won the Chelsea Women's Player's Player of the Year award this past May.\nIn the six campaigns, the versatile defender made over 150 appearances in blue. She went from just 1,260 WSL minutes across her first three seasons to 4,335 in her final three. Once Carter bought in, and got out of her comfort zone, the defender thrived.\nIt's impossible to replace No. 7. There's no question about it. Carter is simply world-class. She's often regarded by many, including me, as one of the best one-on-one defenders in world football. Just look at that display at FC Barcelona in the Champions League. The gal was a wall that day. Nobody would have thought Carter could have strung together a display like that after the 2021 Champions League final.\nIt just shows how remarkable of a rise it really has been for someone who was once told, \"Jess, you pass but don't speak. Give something extra,\" by Chelsea Women's former head of performance, Bart Caubergh.\nHer proficiency in distribution and execution of last-ditch tackles are going to be sorely missed at Kingsmeadow and Stamford Bridge. Taking the Carter move into consideration, the Blues currently have a center-back group of Millie Bright, Aniek Nouwen, Kadeisha Buchanan, Nathalie Björn, and 19-year-old Brooke Aspin. That doesn't even include versatile players like Sophie Ingle and Sjoeke Nusken, who can slot into that role if need be.\nShe'll reunite with her fiancée Ann-Katrin Berger, who has been a formidable presence in goal for Juan Carlos Amorós' team since joining on April 19. Gotham now has three international-level center backs — Emily Sonnett, Tierna Davidson, and now Carter. The trio is not only here for the title run-in but also contracted through 2026. Even without Chelsea's former No. 7, Gotham has one of the best defenses in the league this season, conceding just 13 goals in 16 matches.\nTruthfully, this move shouldn't surprise anyone. When Berger joined Gotham a few months ago after losing her starting role, it seemed like it was a possibility that Carter would follow suit. It's unfortunate not to see the defender live out the contract she penned in 2022, which had her staying in West London until the summer of 2025.\n\"There's not enough words to describe how these 6 years as a Chelsea player have been. Quite a few downs but many many highs,\" the England defender said via Instagram. \"Arriving here as a teenager and leaving with more trophies than I ever could have imagined.\"\n\"...A thank you to those who have helped me grow during my time at Chelsea because I am definitely leaving here a much better person and player than when I arrived.\"\nBest of luck Jess, thank you for everything.\nChelsea will meet Gotham for its first preseason friendly under this new regime on August 19 at 7:00 p.m. ET in New Jersey.",
