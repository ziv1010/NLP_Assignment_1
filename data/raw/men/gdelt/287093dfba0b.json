Drawing 0-0 until a couple of daft mistakes punished in the final 11 minutes, winning at Chelsea and a brilliant defensive display against the odds until a mistake in added time was ruthlessly punished, by far the better team and should have put Forest to bed by half-time, only for bad luck and fine margins to go against us, as well as poor finishing and decision making and mistakes at the back, all punished.\nIt has been superficial to think that during this recent run, Newcastle United were getting a much stronger matchday squad back, as the likes of Joelinton, Burn and Botman were all rushed back earlier than should have been the case, to help the cause. Whilst as Wilson became available again, Isak was ruled out.\nSo if your loyalty as Newcastle United fans lasts 24 days, or even less in some cases apparently, knowing all the underlying problems that Eddie Howe has been having to deal with.\nMaybe you are simply ‘supporting’ the wrong football club.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
