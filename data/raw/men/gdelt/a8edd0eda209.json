Watch this young man flourish next season.\nTino Livramento\nI think now is the time for him to replace Trippier in our starting eleven.\nEddie Howe has slowly introduced him and we’ve seen flashes of excellence from him. He’s got pace, awareness, heading ability and a bit of trickery with the ball. If he could improve his crossing I think he’s a future England right back.\nLewis Hall\nSee Tino.\nAnother one that Eddie has nurtured, this time even slower, but he’s going to be a star.\nSandro Tonali\nI think we will look back at his suspension as a blessing in disguise, he was struggling a little bit to adapt his game to our style before he got banned, I think his quality was there for all to see against PSG but the Premier League looked a bit quick for him.\nAdding in his lack of English he was finding the transition a bit tough, so having an enforced 10 month absence has allowed him to get over these hurdles and properly integrate into the squad.\nRemember, he was one of the most sought after midfielders in Europe when we bought him and the Italians think he will anchor their national team for the next 10 years.\nHarvey Barnes\nThis is a strange one for me.\nHe looks an excellent player but I can’t see him starting many games ahead of Gordon. A fantastic impact substitute which we saw several times already in a very limited season, also a rotation player if Gordon needs a rest.\nThree words to describe how you currently feel as a Newcastle fan?\nExcited Beyond Belief\nA must win game and the whole current squad fit (and not banned) and available, which 11 would you select?\nPope Tino Schar Botman Hall Tonali Bruno Joelinton Gordon Isak Minteh\nPredict the top five in the Premier League (in order).\nArsenal\nNewcastle\nMan City\nLiverpool\nChelsea\nThe best five NUFC performers last season (in order).\nBruno\nGordon\nIsak\nSchar\nBurn\nThe five most important Newcastle players for this upcoming 2024/25 season (in order)?\nBruno\nIsak\nGordon\nJoelinton\nPope\nThe current NUFC player that you have been proved most wrong about?\nIt’s got to be Gordon, for the reasons given in my previous answer about him.\nI’m chuffed to bits to be proven wrong though!!\nWhat do you think should happen with VAR, what changes or get rid of altogether?\nI think the principle behind VAR was very good but the practical use of it has been appalling, just about everything they could get wrong has been done.\nWith regards to offside, the drawing of lines is far too subjective as to when the ball actually moves, a fraction of a second makes a massive difference, such as the Man U v Coventry semi final, a tenth of a second puts the player onside or offside and that cost us a European place.\nThen you have the arrogance of PGMOL who have now decided that rather than use the EUFA semi automated system, to instead “trial” a totally different one, it beggars belief, they could have adopted the EUFA system (bearing in mind all our clubs in Europe are subject to it), sent all the VAR officials over the summer to be trained by people actually using it and ready to go on August 17th, it’s mind blowing to me.\nThen there is the intervention or non-intervention of VAR with on-field decisions once again far too subjective.\nJust a couple of examples.\nDan Burn against Luton v Anthony Gordon against Man U, that sums it up for me.\nI’m sure most clubs have similar examples so it’s not an anti-Newcastle stance, these are just a couple of times I can remember it happening to us.\nPress a magic button and have a 62,000 capacity enlarged St James’ Park in place, or a brand new 80,000 capacity stadium just up the road at Castle Leazes ?\nThis is a tough one.\nI have been going to St Jmaes’ Park since 1968 and absolutely love everything about it, but if I let my head rule my heart, a brand new state of the art 80,000 seater new stadium is an absolute no-brainer.\nThe oldest part of SJP is 50 years old (East Stand) but even the “newer” parts like the Milburn are already 25 years old, so the whole stadium would need renovating/renewing in the next 20 years anyway, so let’s do it now. Also, this is the minimum disruption as we can take two or three years to build the new ground while saying a long goodbye to SJP.\nNext three seasons, would you rather finish top four all three seasons BUT win nothing, or finish mid-table all three seasons AND win the League Cup in one of the three?\nOnce again, a head v heart moment.\nI’m have just turned 63 and have a hazy memory of the Fairs Cup win from the Leazes Wing Paddock, so it’s been a long time.\nHowever, the next 20 years is governed by Champions League revenue, so four years in a row will build a Black and White giant that will dominate domestic and European football for 20 years to come and long after I’m gone. So it has to be CL qualification for me.\nNow 32 months after the takeover, what are your thoughts on the Newcastle United ownership?\nI say a prayer on a regular basis to thank our owners for rescuing this mighty club.\nI would say they have got 90-95% of things correct, they still need to work out a better way of shoehorning 70,000 people into a ground that holds 52,000, more seriously, they need to come up with a membership/ticketing system which is fairer and more equal.\nPerhaps a hierarchy whereby once you get a ticket you go to the bottom of the list for the next game, if there are 20,000 members applying for 4,000 tickets (I have no idea what the numbers are) then the first 4,000 at game one become the last 4,000 at game two??\nOther than that and finding a magic wand to get past FFP/PSR, they’re doing an amazing job.\nAs things stand, what could this NUFC squad be capable of next season?\nI honestly think we can have a real title challenge next season with four key additions that can impact on the starting 11, not necessarily starting every game but pushing those who do start to greater levels, by breathing down their necks.\nBack up keeper, RCB (if Kelly comes as LCB cover), RW (to rotate with Minteh), CF (to rotate with Isak). If we get these I think we can challenge the top two from last season and blow away the rest.\nScale of 1-10, how interested in England at the Euros?\nI would say 3 out of 10, I might get interested in the knockouts but not overly so.\nI just don’t have the passion for England that I have for Newcastle, never have never will.\nI have a saying that “I follow England because it’s where I’m from, I support Newcastle because it’s WHO I AM.”\nHow much of a difference, if any, does it make having two NUFC players in the squad and/or England playing at SJP for a change in the warm up friendly v Bosnia?\nSee my previous answer.\nI just hope none of our international players gets injured during the summer tournaments, that would be the best result for me.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
