The north London outfit have also won all eight of the Champions League games and have reached the final of the Carabao Cup.\nWhile Martinelli remains an important figure in Arteta’s squad, the Brazil international winger is now used as an impact player.\nBarcelona want Gabriel Martinelli\nThe 24-year-old has made just seven starts in the Premier League and only four starts in the Champions League for the Gunners so far this season.\nAccording to Fichajes, Barcelona have taken a shine to Martinelli and view him as an ideal replacement for Raphinha.\nThe Spanish media outlet, which is often speculative, has claimed that with clubs in the Saudi Pro League interested in Raphinha, Barcelona have placed Martinelli on their list of potential replacements for the former Leeds United star.\nMartinelli could be sold for €45million (£39m, $53m) in the summer of 2026, according to the report, which has outlined why Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick wants the Arsenal star.\nThe report notes: ‘Hansi Flick is looking for players capable of attacking space and creating problems for opposing defences through aggressive runs and late runs into the box.\n‘Within FC Barcelona’s system, the Arsenal winger would provide an essential tactical option to unlock tight matches or enhance lethal counter-attacks.\n‘Martinelli’s versatility allows him to play wide or drift inside, a quality that has impressed the Barcelona coaching staff.\n‘His defensive work rate is also a plus, as he maintains the physical intensity that the German coach demands of his forwards.’\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?
