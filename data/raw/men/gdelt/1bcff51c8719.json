  "body_text": "Manchester United are edging closer to signing transfer target Victor Osimhen this summer following Napoli’s decision to pursue a replacement.\nLast summer, Man United secured the signing of fellow Serie A striker Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta. While the youngster appears to be settling into life at Old Trafford, the club is in desperate need of reinforcements up front.\nAs relayed by The Peoples Person, Anthony Martial appears likely to leave United this summer with his contract set to expire. Tottenham Hotspur and Juventus are two of the clubs that have been linked with the Frenchman.\nShould Martial indeed depart the club, United’s only recognised striker would be Hojlund, a tough reality that would no doubt place a mountain of pressure on the 21 year old’s shoulders.\nStill, should reports be believed, United are indeed looking for another striker, particularly since they would not want to overstrain Hojlund and add to their extensive injury woes.\nOsimhen has long been a name on United’s list, with reports suggesting that the club is upping its pursuit of the Napoli striker. It’s been mentioned that United may face competition from Chelsea to secure his transfer.\nDespite the major role he played in Napoli’s Serie A title triumph last season, the Italian club appears prepared to part ways with the Nigerian, with club president Aurelio De Laurentiis admitting that Napoli have accepted this reality.\nAlthough there has not been much further talk on Osimhen’s potential departure since De Laurentiis’s comments, it appears as if his current club are already preparing for the eventuality of his exit this summer.\nGazzetta Dello Sport reported today that Napoli are preparing to make a move for Lille striker Jonathan David, another player who United have had on their radar.\nWhile Napoli and Lille have yet to agree on a transfer fee, the other terms of his move are reportedly already nailed down, suggesting that his transfer is already in motion.\nYet even if the Italian giants are willing to allow Osimhen to depart, United’s pursuit of the 25 year old could be far from straightforward.\nIn addition to competing with other clubs such as Paris Saint-Germain who have the advantage of offering him Champions League football next season, Osimhen’s price tag also proves to be an issue.\nThe player’s release clause is believed to be €130 million, a cost that could place United under a serious financial burden.\nUltimately, United will need to think long and hard before splashing the cash for Osimhen. While he could provide a major goal threat up front, Osimhen alone could cost as much as several other players who have been linked with a summer move to the club.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
