After all, he is on the wish list of many big clubs throughout Europe.\"\nThe news ended speculation that he could return to Bayern in summer after the departure of his successor Thomas Tuchel.\nNagelsmann said: \"This is a decision of the heart. It is a great honour to be able to coach the national team and work with the best players in the country.\n\"With successful and passionate performances we have the chance to inspire an entire country. The two victories against France and the Netherlands in March gave us a taste of this.\n\"I was very touched by the enthusiasm of the fans. Together we now want to play a successful European Championship at home, that's what we're all on fire for. After that, I'm really looking forward to the challenge of the World Cup together with my coaching team.\"\nNeuendorf added: \"The national team is more than just a job for Julian Nagelsmann, it is a matter close to his heart. Now there is planning security and everyone can concentrate fully on a successful performance at the European Championship.\"\nGermany start the Euros on June 14 against Scotland, with Hungary and Switzerland their other group stage opponents.\nBayern Munich could now turn to Zinedine Zidane, the former France great, to take over from Tuchel, according to reports in Spain. Zidane world the World Cup as a player before coaching Real Madrid to tree Champions League titles.\nAustralian Associated Press",
