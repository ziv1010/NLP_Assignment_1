During the second half, I felt like my legs were not working!”\nThis is how Inigo Martinez jokingly described his past week at Barcelona, which has without question been his best time since joining them on a free transfer in the summer.\nHead coach Xavi subbed him off in the 82nd minute of Wednesday’s 2-1 Champions League home win over Shakhtar Donetsk, but not because his performance had been disappointing — far from it.\nAdvertisement\nIt was the 32-year-old defender’s second start in three days and at “around the 65th minute” he said he “started to realise I was really tired”.\n“I think it’s normal,” Martinez added after the game. “It’s the first time this season I’ve played two games from the start after a long injury. It’s nothing to worry about, but I preferred to tell the manager and rest a bit.”\nGO DEEPER\nHalfway health check - Champions League debrief\nXavi also confirmed there was “nothing to worry about” in his post-match comments. Quite the opposite. Just as he did against former club Athletic Bilbao in La Liga on Sunday night, Martinez managed to prove a point to anyone who was still wondering why Barca moved for him.\nThe Catalans did not have their brightest match against Shakhtar, but they got the three points that leave them comfortably top of their group at the halfway stage, thanks most of all to a brilliant display from 20-year-old Fermin Lopez, who scored one goal and provided the other for Ferran Torres.\nLa Masia graduates such as Lopez have taken all the headlines this past week in Barcelona, but apart from 17-year-old Marc Guiu’s fairytale winner at the weekend, there has been arguably no better revelation than Martinez.\nThis is partly because of how underappreciated he has been since arriving.\nJust before the formal announcement of his transfer, as a free agent after his Bilbao contract expired, Martinez had to have surgery on a foot injury. That left him facing a rough start to the campaign, with no game time in the warm-up matches as we went through a careful recovery process.\nIt was even easy to forget Martinez was part of the squad, and it’s fair to say Barcelona had some responsibility for that.\nAs the Catalans were immersed in their usual salary limit difficulties, his injury served as a reason to put his registration with La Liga on hold. His recuperation meant he could not play at the time, while other new signings, such as Ilkay Gundogan and Oriol Romeu could. Therefore, the backroom staff preferred to prioritise them.\nAs deadline day arrived, though, Martinez found himself in a difficult position.\nAdvertisement\nStill on the comeback trail, he was the fifth-choice centre-back of the squad, with Ronald Araujo, Jules Kounde, Andreas Christensen and Eric Garcia all ahead of him. He was still not even registered.\nOne of the reasons Barcelona finally allowed Garcia to go on loan to Girona, as well as sending Ansu Fati to Brighton for the season and selling Abde Ezzalzouli to Real Betis was to make sure they’d have enough salary space to register Martinez.\n🎙️ IÑIGO MARTÍNEZ: \"This is the path to follow.\"#BarçaShakhtar | @ChampionsLeague pic.twitter.com/mWMggfV2oQ\n— FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) October 26, 2023\nThe player and his camp were always calm about this situation and trusted the club would register him eventually. Senior Barca executives acknowledged it would be seen as a disaster if they could not. This was a big motivation in allowing those deadline-day departures.\nWith all the paperwork sorted and after two substitute appearances, Martinez finally made his first start on September 26 in a 2-2 La Liga draw away to Mallorca, he was lacking rhythm and didn’t offer his best performance.\nWhen Kounde was then ruled out with an injury suffered in the final game before the October internationals, Martinez was presented with a new opportunity in this crowded week of football. “He’s certainly taken his chance,” said a dressing room source, who preferred to speak anonymously as they did not have permission to comment.\nIf there is a department in which Martinez has shone brightest, it is his work with the ball. He played a fundamental role in the build-up process both on Wednesday and at the weekend.\nLet’s start with the Shakhtar one.\nIn the screengrab below, Martinez receives the ball from Araujo, and while the opposition sit back and wait for Barcelona to attack, he makes a pass to Torres that instantly breaks two lines…\n…creating space for him to turn and start the run that ends in Lopez’s goal to double the lead.\nEven more impressive was what Martinez did three days earlier against his former club.\nIt is practically the same context, but arguably a harder pass to a) spot and b) execute. In this case, Joao Felix is the target for Martinez.\nThe distance the ball has to cover is slightly further, but Martinez finds a way through. Joao Felix shows sublime control before launching the hero of the night, 17-year-old Guiu, on towards his winner.\nThat kind of passing has not been seen from a Barcelona centre-back this season. Their most remarkable actions have mostly been desperate tackles, such as the one Kounde made Porto in the previous Champions League group game three weeks ago to deny Evanilson a goal.\nAdvertisement\nMartinez has impressed with his defensive actions too, but also with his passes through opposition lines and his long balls to switch play — an ability Xavi values.\n“He’s really proactive in defence,” the manager said on Wednesday night. “He knows how to filter balls straight to the forwards. His passes are so good, as we could see with Fermin’s goal, but he’s also really good at switching the game with long-range deliveries. I’m so pleased with him — that’s why we signed him.”\nAgainst Shakhtar, Martinez completed five long passes from seven attempts — the most among Barcelona players in the game. But he was even more impressive in this department against previous club Bilbao on Saturday, where he completed 12 from 15 attempts in the same metric — again, the best numbers in the team. In both matches, his passing accuracy was above 90 per cent.\nXavi also praised Martinez’s influence in the dressing room. Among the young core of players now growing at the club, a figure with his great experience is proving to be a fitting addition.\n“Inigo is extremely positive for the group. He has the character of a leader,” Xavi said. “He is very positive and knows what he can offer to the younger ones.”\nMartinez was one of the first players to offer advice to Guiu after his winner on Saturday, as the 17-year-old revealed on TV: “Inigo just told me I won’t be able to sleep, but to enjoy it.”\nDressing room sources say he’s also close to Gavi, Pedri and Alejandro Balde, players he already knew from the Spanish national team, as well as Lopez and 16-year-old Lamine Yamal, plus fellow experienced campaigners such as Romeu, Marcos Alonso and Sergi Roberto.\nNow the first Clasico of the season is looming, and in these two games, Martinez has offered Xavi reasons to consider him as a potential starter in Saturday’s La Liga meeting at Montjuic, Barca’s temporary home while the Camp Nou undergoes extensive and expensive renovations. Picking him would allow the manager to repeat his successful formula of using Araujo as a right-back against Vinicius Junior.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s going to be my first Clasico and I can’t wait to live it, they’re so special,” Martinez said. “Let’s see if I can play from the start, but if it’s not the case I’m going to help as much as I can from the bench, that’s for sure.”\nThis is certainly a nice problem to have for Xavi now. And it is a significant achievement for somebody who not so long ago was an unnoticed signing, fifth-choice at centre-back and a last-minute registration.\nGO DEEPER\nEl Clasico: Real Madrid and Barcelona's week of tension won't change their alliance\n(Top photo: Pedro Salado/Quality Sport Images/Getty Images)",
