I will tell you what’s happening\n“0-0 so far and confirmation again that @thibautcourtois is (and has been for years) the BEST goalkeeper in the world.”\nREAD NEXT 🔴 Real Madrid ‘emergency’ as €35m bid planned for ‘dream’ player to break Liverpool hearts – report\nThibaut Courtois reaches Real Madrid ‘milestone’\nFans of other clubs, especially Liverpool and Manchester City, will disagree with Balague’s claim that Courtois is the best goalkeeper on the planet.\nLiverpool fans will point to Alisson’s consistently top-level performances when he is fit and available.\nMan City supporters will note how Donnarumma played a key role for Paris Saint-Germain in their Champions League success last season, and his impressive performances between the sticks for Pep Guardiola’s side so far this campaign.\nCourtois, though, has to be in the conversation among the best goalkeepers in the world.\nThe Belgian has won LaLiga three times and the Champions League twice with Madrid so far in his career.\nThe match against Juventus was Courtois’s 300th for Madrid, and he was happy to have reached the ‘milestone’\nCourtois told Real Madrid’s official website after the match: “I’m delighted with the win.\n“I’m really happy, it’s nice to mark my 300th Real Madrid appearance with a 1-0 win, a decent performance and some good saves.\n“I think my best stop today was the one-on-one with Vlahovic. It was really good from a technical point of view.”\n“It was a really hard-fought game with chances at both ends. We really had to sweat to win it.\n“It’s a big win, especially against another great side.\n“That’s 9 from 9 now. Next up, we head to Anfield, so we’ll see what happens. We’ve started well and we just have to keep working hard.”\nWhen asked about his save against Vlahovic, the goalkeeper said: “The coach wants me to play high up, but when the ball comes in like that, I’m not the quickest.\n“It looked like Militão was going to get there, but Vlahović is a great forward and I’m there to help out. I’m happy with the stop.”\nHAVE YOU SIGNED UP? 💫 Get the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.\nLatest Real Madrid transfer news: Liverpool raid, Endrick in demand\nElsewhere, Real Madrid are said to be ready to raid Liverpool in the January transfer window for a midfielder.\nSources have told TEAMtalk’s transfer correspondent, Fraser Fletcher, the names of the clubs that are after Real Madrid striker Endrick.\nManchester United have also been linked with Endrick, but TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, has reported the Red Devils’ chances of a loan deal for the Brazil international striker.",
