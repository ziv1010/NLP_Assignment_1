  "body_text": "Manchester United definitely missed a trick by not signing a defensive midfielder this summer, given the form of the players at Ruben Amorim’s disposal.\nCasemiro cannot play every game due to his ageing legs, while the head coach feels Kobbie Mainoo is not adept at playing as the defensive midfielder and prefers him further forward.\nManuel Ugarte’s drop-off in form is a huge concern, which is why the Portuguese tactician demanded INEOS to try and sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton and Hove Albion.\nThe Seagulls demanded a record fee, which INEOS could not afford to pay this window, and hence backed out. A move for Morten Hjulmand did not materialise owing to concerns over his physicality.\nJanuary midfield plans\nThe Red Devils were forced to shelve their plans of signing a midfielder till January, with Baleba not the only name on their list of targets.\nAs relayed by The Peoples Person, Chelsea’s Romeo Lavia has emerged as a surprise option and he would be a low-cost alternative to the Cameroonian.\nNow, Teamtalk have revealed that United also have another name on their January midfield agenda — Adam Wharton of Crystal Palace.\nThe Englishman has been a long-term target for the club, who feel both the Eagles ace and Baleba would form a deadly midfield duo capable of taking the 20-time English league champions back to the top.\nUnited are ready to offer in excess of £50 million for the 21-year-old, but they are not the only side in the race with Chelsea also eyeing the ex-Blackburn Rovers star.\nAdam Wharton also remains open to the idea of joining one of the big clubs, but he will not force through an exit and will listen to what his club has to say. INEOS will likely need a lot more to prise him away from Selhurst Park.\n“Manchester United and Chelsea remain frontrunners in the race to sign rising Crystal Palace and England star Adam Wharton, with sources providing TEAMtalk the latest as January bids are prepared.\nWharton bid being prepared\n“His performances have not gone unnoticed, with United and Chelsea both expressing strong interest during the summer transfer window. However, Palace stood firm, declaring Wharton untouchable amid a turbulent window that saw them fend off bids for other stars.\n“Yet, the door may not be entirely closed. Sources suggest a January approach remains highly feasible, with both United and Chelsea preparing bids potentially exceeding £50million.\n“Wharton himself is said to be eager for a new challenge at the elite level, believing a move to Old Trafford or Stamford Bridge could accelerate his development and expose him to Champions League football.\n“However, like many of his team-mates, Wharton will not act out to get a move and will respect Palace and follow the lead of others who have been professional even though they coveted an exit.”\nHopefully, INEOS can land one of their targets in winter as Amorim’s system warrants the presence of an elite defensive midfielder. The head coach’s future might be at stake.\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
