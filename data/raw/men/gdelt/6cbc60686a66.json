To help balance the books, a veritable player exodus is on the cards this summer.\nHowever, that won’t stop Chelsea from sanctioning a handful of arrivals. A new centre-forward is wanted and central midfield could also be addressed pending the futures of Conor Gallagher, N’Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic.\nMan Utd, meanwhile, are also seeking additions up front and in the engine room. An attacking upgrade at right-back is also being eyed, with Bayer Leverkusen’s Jeremie Frimpong already engaging in extensive talks over a summer switch.\nNow, according to news coming from Germany, Man Utd and Chelsea could soon converge over a player who’ll net his side a new transfer record.\nBorussia Monchengladbach’s Kouadio Kone is the player in question, with German outlet BILD claiming a major sale is coming.\nGladbach have suffered losses of around €56m over the last three seasons and hope to raise around €70m through player sales this summer.\nFour players have been earmarked for exits, with Kouadio Kone – colloquially known as Manu Kone – the biggest prize. The others are Nico Elvedi, Jordan Beyer and Marvin Friedrich.\nKone, 21, has been tipped as the next Aurelien Tchouameni and operates exclusively in central midfield. However, aside from his defensive prowess he also has blistering pace, sound technical ability and defence-splitting vision in his repertoire too.\nTransfer guru Fabrizio Romano recently ran the rule over a potential Kone exit this summer. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano listed Chelsea, Man Utd and PSG as showing interest.\n“It’s my understanding that three clubs at this moment are leading the race for Manu Kone,” said Romano. “One, for sure, is Chelsea.\n“They have many players in their list. We have to include Romeo Lavia, Declan Rice they are always monitoring, but we know Manu Kone is a player they are following. Chelsea will be there.\n“Man Utd are following the player too, so Chelsea, United and PSG.”\nPSG step aside for Monchengladbach record sale\nHowever, French football expert, Jonathan Johnson, subsequently claimed PSG are unlikely to act on their interest. As such, the race may be down to Man Utd and Chelsea.\nOn that front, BILD reported Chelsea have made contact with Gladbach, though a move to Old Trafford could hold greater appeal given their likely participation in next year’s Champions League.\nOn the subject of cost, Kone looks destined to net Gladbach a new club-record transfer fee. That distinction is currently held by Granit Xhaka who was sold to Arsenal for €45m back in 2016.\nRomano reported Kone will cost “at least €50m (approx. £44m) with add-ons [on top].”\nBILD confirm a Kone deal ‘is expected to break Borussia Monchengladbach’s record for a fee received’.",
