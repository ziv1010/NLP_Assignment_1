  "body_text": "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Liverpool remain locked in active negotiations to bring Marc Guehi to Anfield before the transfer window closes.\nThe England international has already given his approval to the move, but the deal hinges on whether Crystal Palace are willing, and able, to sanction his departure.\nLiverpool’s need for defensive reinforcements has been clear for some time. Even this season, they have conceded four goals in just two Premier League matches this season and the performances of French centre-back Ibrahima Konate have come under scrutiny.\nLiverpool are looking to sign Marc Guehi soon\nAt just 24, Guehi has established himself as one of the Premier League’s most consistent defenders, while also impressive for the England national team.\nRomano reports that Liverpool are prepared to go beyond £30 million to secure Guehi’s services immediately, with the club eager to finalise the move rather than risk waiting until future windows.\nThe stumbling block, however, remains Crystal Palace’s willingness to sell. Palace are reluctant to lose their defensive leader without first securing a replacement, particularly given the limited time left in the market.\nFor Guehi, the decision appears straightforward. He has already said “yes” to Liverpool’s proposal, with the opportunity of Champions League football and the chance to play under Slot proving too strong to resist.\nCrystal Palace are waiting to sign Guehi’s replacement\nHis performances for England at Euro 2024 only enhanced his reputation, and a move to one of the Premier League’s traditional giants feels like a natural next step in his career.\nPalace, though, hold the power in this situation. Unless they can bring in cover at centre-back, they may opt to keep Guehi for another season but that would give them a huge dent financially since the centre-back is already in the final year of his contract at Selhurst Park and he will become a free agent next summer.\nFor Liverpool, the wait continues, but their determination to get this deal over the line shows just how highly they rate the former Chelsea defender.\nPremier League rivals “ready to make a move” for technically-gifted Liverpool attacker",
