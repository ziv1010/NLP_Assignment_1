In the latest Cup game, long balls over Bayern's back-chain made Leverkusen take the victory.\nThe winning goal, scored by the England-born and Nigerian-rooted Nathan Tella, gave a convincing example of Alonso's match plan.\nGerman international Jonathan Tah outlined his team tactics confirming: \"We wanted to play these long passes to make deep runs and get right in front of their goal.\"\nThe sports magazine kicker called the actions \"tactical traps.\" One caught Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer in the 17th minute with the former German international crashing in Jereme Frimpong harvesting a red card.\nLeverkusen midfielder Robert Andrich spoke of a \"turning point\" after a bumpy 2024/25 season start. \"We understood things don't work by themselves. We saw it might take dirty wins to keep on track,\" the 30-year-old said.\n\"We might have failed to present a perfect match, but we pushed through our plans,\" Tah added while the media was talking about Leverkusen (and Alonso) as the Bavarian's new \"feared opponent.\"\nThe victory in Munich is delivering additional confidence for the national campaign, players and the successful coach assumed.\nWhile Leverkusen officials such as CEO Fernando Carro deny in advance agreements with Real, speculations remain, that the courted coach might leave at the end of the 2024/25 season.\nAs a fact, Bayer's sporting director Sinon Rolfes is investigating coaching successors such as the Stuttgart coach Sebastian Hoeness.\nAlonso is meanwhile working on the next title as his side turned into the 2024/25 German Cup favorites making it into the last eight rounds.\nCalmly, the Leverkusen coach is explaining football's daily routines as he is speaking about having achieved a \"big goal but not having reached anything yet.\"\nKeeping pressure off his team made him win the 2024 national title aside from the 2024 German Cup. As it seems, Alonso is always finding answers to his team's situation. At the end of this season, he might have to find one regarding his future. Enditem\nNo comments.",
