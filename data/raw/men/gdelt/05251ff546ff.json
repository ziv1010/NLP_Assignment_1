Is he a good enough footballer to play for Manchester United?\n\"The only person that can answer that is Erik ten Hag and we'll know at the end of this season.\"\nWest Ham will go into next week with spring in their step\nWest Ham kickstarted the biggest week of their season with a 1-0 win over Manchester United. Said Benrahma, Declan Rice and Lucas Paqueta caught the eye and the trio will hope to reprise a similar performance in Thursday's Europa Conference League semi-final against AZ Alkmaar.\nDavid Moyes' side are seven points clear of the relegation zone with remaining league games against Brentford, Leeds and Leicester City.\n\"The significance of that win is massive,\" Rice told BT Sport. \"As players you can't help but look around and we knew a win would give us a nice gap between us and teams in the bottom. That was probably our best performance at home this season. The fans were electric and the semi-finals this week is so big. Winning trophies is what it's all about and we're looking to stamp our authority.\"\nManchester United's top-four spot is in jeopardy\nAnother away defeat. Another game where levels dropped after the interval. Manchester United's place in the top four appears in jeopardy. Hundreds of fans left before the final whistle and when the players went over to those fans who stayed, several responded with angry gestures, for the first time this season.\nDavid de Gea's mistake was the pivotal detail, but United were very fortunate with Victor Lindelof's handball in the area and when referee Peter Bankes ruled out Michael Antonio's goal. De Gea was saved another goal-causing error by the award of a soft foul.\nUnited actually started the game confidently but again failed to take their chances. Erik ten Hag rolled the dice by going to a three-at-the-back but the there was little by way of pressure. Anthony Martial should have scored when found two yards out by Bruno Fernandes from a corner, but it would have been a lucky escape.\nFull-time - West Ham 1-0 Manchester United\nWest Ham have deservedly claimed the three points at the London Stadium.\nUnited's top-four hopes have taken a massive hit this week with back-to-back Premier League defeats against Brighton and now West Ham.\nWest Ham now have 37 points next to their name which should keep them in the top flight next season.\nEight minutes added on\nEight minutes have been added on due to the head injuries to Wan-Bissaka and Soucek.\n10 minutes remaining\nTen Hag has thrown on Sabitzer and Sancho but they are still yet to really work Fabianski in this second half.\nUnited's aspirations of qualifying for next season's Champions League will be in great danger if they slip up.\nWan-Bisakka and Soucek are currently being treated for injury after a clash of heads. It looks like both will continue.\nWest Ham go close again\nWest Ham should be 2-0 up at the very least.\nManchester United are pushing for an equaliser but West Ham look more threatening.\nThis time it is Soucek who has an effort at goal but it goes wide.\nTen Hag has thrown on Martial for Weghorst but he hasn't made a difference just yet.\nWest Ham look more likely to score a second\nIt's West Ham who look more likely to score the next goal.\nAntonio puts the ball in the net but it's ruled out as the West Ham striker touched De Gea as he went up for a header. It was minimal contact. De Gea is very, very lucky.\nThe second half gets underway\nWest Ham kick off proceedings for the second half at the London Stadium.\nHalf-time - West Ham 1-0 Manchester United\nDe Gea's error has gifted West Ham a half-time lead.\nBenrahma's tame shot shouldn't have troubled the Spaniard but his loss of concentration saw the east London side take the lead.\nWest Ham could have been awarded a penalty before the break with the ball striking Lindelof's hand.\nOn-field referee Peter Bankes and the VAR official both decide it's not a penalty. I think West Ham can feel hard done by there.\nWill De Gea be given a new deal?\nDe Gea is out of contract in the summer with Manchester United yet to tie him down to a new deal.\nIf he continues to make errors like today then you can see Ten Hag choosing to dispense of his services before bringing in a new first choice goalkeeper this summer.\nDean Henderson is also expected to return to the club this summer following his loan spell at Nottingham Forest.\nWest Ham 1-0 Manchester United\nWest Ham take the lead and it's another mistake by David de Gea in the Manchester United goal.\nBenrahma aims a tame shot at United's goal and De Gea parries the ball into his own net.\nIt's another nightmare moment for the Spanish goalkeeper.\nRashford hits the post\nManchester United are up for this but they haven't been able to find the finishing touch just yet.\nRashford cannons the ball off the post. He shoots at goal towards Fabianski's near post. His shot beats the Pole but hits the woodwork rather than the back of the net.\nIt remains 0-0 after 20 minutes.\nManchester United in control of early proceedings\nThe visitors have looked lively during the first 10 minutes with Antony having the best chance of the game.\nWeghorst, who is being deployed as the No 10, does well to chest the ball down to Antony.\nBut the Brazilian's send his shot wide despite it falling perfectly on to his favoured left foot.\nTen Hag does not look happy.\nThe match at the London Stadium is underway\nThe game has started.\nSit back and relax as we keep you updated throughout.\nWill Man United cement CL spot or let Liverpool back in?\nAre Manchester United fans — or Newcastle United fans for that matter — getting nervous about their top-four places?\nLiverpool have won six in a row, putting them in fifth place, one point behind their Manchester rivals who kick off against West Ham shortly. Liverpool have, however, played two games more than Erik ten Hag's side.\nNewcastle's 2-0 defeat at home to Arsenal this afternoon leaves them three points clear of Liverpool, but having played just one game more.\nShould West Ham win at the London Stadium then Liverpool fans will be sensing an opportunity while their counterparts in Newcastle and the red half of Manchester will be looking nervously over their shoulders.\nRemaining fixtures\n- Newcastle: Leeds (A), Brighton (H), Leicester (H), Chelsea (A)\n- Man United: West Ham (A, tonight), Wolves (H), Bournemouth (A), Chelsea (H), Fulham (H)\n- Liverpool: Leicester (A), Aston Villa (H), Southampton (A)\nNewcastle were undone by a savvier side\nThis was a game Newcastle could have won, but they were undone by a savvier side. Chances were missed — Murphy and Isak hit the post, Schar’s close range header, a penalty overturned by VAR — but after going ahead, Arsenal managed the game with aplomb.\nJorginho, after being swarmed early, evaded the Newcastle press outstandingly — with Eddie Howe’s side guilty of carelessness in possession themselves. The second goal — a fast break ending in Schar turning into his own net — was a direct consequence of Newcastle getting caught upfield.\nNewcastle still likely need six points from their final four games to secure Champions League football.",
