  "body_text": "Liverpool are unbeaten in nine meetings with Southampton, winning eight of them. The Saints have lost each of their last eight visits to Anfield, conceding 25 goals and scoring only two, their most-recent win there though coming in the League Cup semi-finals eight years ago.\nLiverpool vs Southampton preview\nWill Liverpool continue their perfect start to this season? On Saturday, the Reds enjoyed their most serene victory of the campaign so far, defeating Everton 2-1 in the Merseyside derby. Goals from Ryan Gravenberch and then Hugo Ekitiké saw them race into an early 2-0 lead, only for the Toffees to half the deficit in the hour mark, but they ultimately held on for a 2-1 victory.\nThis is the first time Arne Slot's side have not required a winner in the 83rd minute or later this season. Liverpool have already scored stoppage time winners against Newcastle, Burnley and, most-recently, Atlético Madrid, commencing their Champions League campaign with a dramatic 3-2 victory last Wednesday. In EFL Cup terms, the Reds are the record ten-times winners of this competition, recently hoisting the trophy aloft in both 2022 and 2024, before being beaten by Newcastle in March's final, hoping this'll be the start of another run to Wembley.\nAs for Southampton, they were League Cup runners-up in 1979 and 2017, dumping out Liverpool in the semi-finals en route to the latter, featuring in last season's quarter-finals, where Liverpool brought and end to their run. Already this season, the Saints have enjoyed EFL Cup victories at Northampton and Norwich, the latter a 3-0 drubbing, although their league campaign isn't going so well.\nWill Still's side were beaten 3-1 at Hull City on Saturday, meaning they remain winless since dramatically defeating Wrexham 2-1 on the opening day, scoring twice in injury time. Thus, the Saints are therefore down in 19th in the Championship table, ahead of Saturday's meeting with unbeaten league leaders Middlesbrough. Thus, Southampton appear ill-equipped to beat Liverpool at Anfield.\nLiverpool vs Southampton head-to-head record\n- Matches Played: 122.\n- Liverpool Wins: 65. Draws: 26. Southampton Wins: 31.\nLiverpool team news\nGiven their hectic schedule, expect wholesale changes from Arne Slot for this League Cup tie.\nThere will be a debut in goal for Giorgi Mamardashvili, 13 months after his £25 million move from Valencia was announced. Joe Gomez, Wataro Endō, Curtis Jones and Federico Chiesa will also be rotated in, while teenager Rio Ngumoha, the match-winner at Newcastle, is also set to start.\nElsewhere, Giovanni Leoni will make his debut at centre-back but, most excitingly of all, Alexander Isak will also be in the lineup, having started for the first time against Atlético Madrid last mid-week, with the most expensive player in British football still looking to rebuild his fitness.\nLiverpool predicted lineup vs Southampton: (4-3-3): Mamardashvili; Frimpong, Leoni, Gomez, Robertson; Endō, Jones, Wirtz; Chiesa, Isak, Ngumoha.\nLiverpool player to watch vs Southampton\nAlexander Isak scored four Carabao Cup goals for Newcastle, including netting against Liverpool in last season's final, so will this be the night he opens his account for the Reds?\nLiverpool vs Southampton prediction\nWe cannot see beyond a comfortable Liverpool victory, likely to swat a struggling Southampton aside at Anfield, even though Arne Slot will make mass-changes to his side: Liverpool 3-0 Southampton.\nLiverpool vs Southampton FAQs - Carabao Cup\nHow to watch Liverpool vs Southampton in the Carabao Cup on TV channel?\nLiverpool vs Southampton in the Carabao Cup will be available on the following TV channels;\n- UK: ITV1 & Sky Sports Main Event & Ultra HD.\n- USA: Paramount+\n- Canada: DAZN Canada\nHow to watch Liverpool vs Southampton in the Carabao Cup on live streaming?\nLiverpool vs Southampton in the Carabao Cup will be available on the following streaming services;\n- UK: ITVX, SkyGo & NOW TV.\n- USA: Paramount+\n- Canada: DAZN Canada\nWhat is the date and kick-off time for Liverpool vs Southampton in the Carabao Cup?\nLiverpool vs Southampton takes place on Tuesday 23 September 2025, with kick off at 20:00 (BST), 15:00 (EDT) & 12:00 (PDT).",
