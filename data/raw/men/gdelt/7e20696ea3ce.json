  "body_text": "Arsenal’s chances of signing Athletic Bilbao winger Nico Williams have been dealt a major blow.\nThe Spaniard, who was part of Spain’s Euro 2024 winning team last year, has caught the attention of Arsenal and some other big clubs with his consistent performances for his club and country.\nWilliams has emerged as one of La Liga’s top performers, contributing significantly to Athletic Bilbao’s successful campaign which has seen them qualify for the semifinal of the Europa League where they will face Manchester United.\nAthletic Bilbao won the Copa Del Rey last season during which the winger was instrumental for them and even this season, they are fourth in La Liga and performing well.\nHowever, the winger has shared his ambitions for the future ahead of the semi-final clash with Man United, strongly suggesting that he hopes to play Champions League football with Athletic Bilbao next season.\n“Every kid wants to play at Old Trafford. We have the goal of winning the Europa League and, next year, to crush the Champions League. Little by little,” Williams told AS.\n“I think our motto of going ‘on the down low’ is the best. We’re doing very well, and we need to continue like this to reach the final to continue this streak to help the team. The team is extraordinary.\n“We’re going to celebrate this victory. San Mamés deserves it more than anyone. We’re doing very well to reach the semifinal we want. One more step before the final, and hopefully we can get there.”\nNico Williams has no intention of joining Arsenal\nThe winger’s current deal with the Spanish side will expire in 2027 which means that the club’s only chance of selling him for a massive transfer fee will be this summer.\nDespite some concerns regarding his contract, he is not in any mood to leave Bilbao any time soon and wants to experience Champions League football with them.\nArteta will not be impressed with the comments made by Williams and the Premier League manager may have to turn his focus towards other targets this summer.\nIn such a case, the Gunners would have to focus on other targets like Newcastle United’s Anthony Gordon.\nReliable journalist says Arsenal transfer target has made major U-turn on his future",
