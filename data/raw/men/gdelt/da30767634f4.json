He trails only all-time top goal scorer Cristiano Ronaldo and former Barcelona great Lionel Messi.\nRead Also: NSC kicks as EFCC begins probe of NFF finances\nLewandowski is top scorer both in Spain and in the Champions League, where he boasts seven goals from five matches, two more than any other player.\nDespite his lethal form in front of goal, Lewandowski’s presence in Barcelona’s side does have one drawback.\nIn part given his age, the striker has not been able to maintain his team’s objective of pressing opponents as consistently as Flick would like.\nA drop in pressing intensity has recently exposed Barcelona’s high defensive line more than at the start of the season.\n“It’s clear that we made mistakes, but I insist, it’s not the fault of the back four, it starts up front,” said the coach after a shock 2-1 loss to minnows Las Palmas in La Liga at the start of December.\nBarcelona also recently threw away a two-goal lead at Celta Vigo, with Real Madrid gobbling up the distance between the sides at the top of the table that the Catalans had established.\nBarca’s recent issues will be thoroughly analysed by Dortmund ahead of the clash at the Westfalenstadion, with Flick also admitting his team have struggled on the road.\nBarcelona twice let a lead slip in a 2-2 draw at Real Betis on Saturday in which Lewandowski scored. They were overwhelmed at times by the hosts.\n“We have the quality to win every match but we also have to show that,” said Flick.\n”(In) the away matches we have to be much stronger than we played here.”\nGiven Flick’s drive to make Barcelona a more robust team, the questions is how long Lewandowski can continue to shine as the minutes rack up.\nThe coach rested the striker for a recent 5-1 romp over Mallorca which suggested Barcelona might not be dependent on the forward in the same way they are on 17-year-old winger Lamine Yamal.\nHowever, Flick has backed Lewandowski since arriving and even if the Pole’s work-rate has dipped, the coach believes.\n“Robert is an absolute professional player, working hard on his fitness, this body he has, it’s not this age,” said the coach earlier in the season.\nAfter some frustrating displays last season, Lewandowski has rolled back the years under Flick and Dortmund fans will fear the return of the devastating forward who wore their colours a decade ago.",
