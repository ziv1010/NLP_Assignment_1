  "body_text": "It’s weird to say that a heavy loss could positively affect a football club’s confidence, but that’s exactly the case with Tottenham Hotspur. Sure, they lost 5-3 to arguably the best team in world football in PSG at the Parc des Princes in their Champions League tie on Wednesday. But they played PSG pretty even on the day, even winning the xG battle in the match, and showed a great deal of improvement over the course of the match. In fact, it doesn’t feel inappropriate to say that the difference between PSG and Tottenham on Wednesday came down to moments of brilliance from PSG’s extremely talented squad (and the occasional defensive mistake by Spurs) as opposed to anything tactical either side did.\nFrank: no fresh injury concerns ahead of Saturday’s Fulham match\nSpurs have a chance to snap their home winless streak in another home London derby.news\nNow eyes turn to Saturday’s match against Fulham at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Spurs haven’t won a match at home since Burnley on August 16, a weird winless streak at what is supposed to be a fortress. Even so, head coach Thomas Frank has his team ready to play against their crosstown neighbors and is hopeful that the lineup that punched back against the Champions League winners twice this season can take some confidence from that match into what increasingly feels like a must-win Premier League fixture.\n“[It feels like a must-win], but unfortunately, I think the stats is not like there’s 100% sure that we will win the game. That’s the beauty of it. I’m very aware that a top performance and a win will be very, very helpful, but, you know, I go into every game believing we’ll win. I go into every game believing we have prepared well and we will do a top performance.\n“So what I can affect is that I need to make sure that we are well prepared, I need to make sure that we pick the best possible team with the best possible opportunity to win the game, and I need to make sure we are in the perfect condition to come back out. And then we need a little bit of margin. That should be enough to win.\n“For me, we look forward. We can’t dwell too much on the past. Because if we do that, we are too much sucked into everything. So, for me, it’s still 24 hours from last night. For me, it’s about taking the positive out of the game in PSG. And there was a lot of positives in that game. Learn from the mistakes you made and then bring all that to Saturday’s game against Fulham.”\nThe good news is that Frank doesn’t have any fresh injury concerns heading into this weekend’s match. That means players that did well against PSG, including those fresh back from injury like Archie Gray, Lucas Bergvall, and Randal Kolo Muani will potentially be available to play against Fulham. But that doesn’t mean they will, with a short turnaround between the Champions League fixtures on Wednesday and this weekend’s match. Frank did heavily imply, however, that Kolo Muani would feature on Saturday.\n“[Kolo Muani] would be fit enough to start against Fulham again. I think he performed well. Obviously, his best performance, not only because of the two goals and the assist, but the overall performance, pressing game, the energy and the touches. I liked that from him in the game yesterday.\n“And that’s, as you say, the challenge that we are facing, that we are embracing, is that away to Arsenal, three days later away to PSG, three days later home to Fulham, three days later away to Newcastle.\n“So how can we find that perfect balance of energy, intensity, freshness and the right structure and relationship on the pitch? So that’s a nice coaching challenge, let me put it that way. But anyway, Kolo has been good.\n“I think it was exciting. I think you can just see the three, both the link-up play, the pressure, that was everything last night. I think the exciting thing was around the first goal. The way the header, the vision he had to hit it back towards goal to [Richarlison].\n“His goal, how quick he reacted and saw it and his finishing there. And then the third one where he’s got it, got through, showed that little bit of pace. Got the ball with him and just clinical in the finish.\n“So now it’s about doing that consistently every game. So that’s the next step. But it was promising.”\nFrank set Spurs up in a 4-4-2 formation against PSG that attacked in a diamond formation and shifted into a mid-block when defending and it proved to be pretty effective on both sides of the ball despite the five goals conceded. The match also got good performances from young players such as Lucas Bergvall and Archie Gray, who both played in the midfield. So will we see something similar on Saturday? Frank was non-committal.\n“I think that was what I would say, let’s say the general identity of the team. I liked a lot of the intensity and aggressivity in the pressure. I liked the forwardness and the running forward, playing forward. I think we played four midfielders across the midfield. That could be for some games.\n“It could also be different for some games. I think it’s fair to say it’s one game away to Paris and it’s a different game for Fulham.\n“Everything is possible, but I think it depends on the opponent. It depends on the type of game. I think we need different types. I’ve said that before. Being pragmatic is not having the same principles in all the phases. But maybe choose different types for different games.”\nSpurs kick off against Fulham in the late match on Saturday — the match starts at 3 pm ET / 8 pm GMT at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
