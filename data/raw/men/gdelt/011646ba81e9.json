He was back in the Madrid starting lineup against Oviedo and I think the player, he’s happy at Madrid as long as he’s getting minutes.\n“And Madrid, if they were to sell him, they’ll be looking at huge fee for a signature as well. So, so late in the window, I would say it’s highly unlikely that Liverpool would push to get a deal over the line for Rodrygo. It’s not happening this window.”\nDIVE DEEPER 👉 Liverpool XI after dream end to summer transfer window with £190m signing blitz\nRodrygo drops major Real Madrid hint\nSince Xabi Alonso became the new Real Madrid manager at the end of last season, Rodrygo has made only two competitive starts for Los Blancos.\nWhile Alonso clearly does not consider Rodrygo a guaranteed starter in his team, the Brazilian star himself has dropped a major hint on his future.\nWhile there has been speculation in the media that Rodrygo is open to leaving Madrid in search of regular playing time, the 24-year-old’s post on X suggests that he is very much committed to starring for Los Blancos.\nAfter the draw for the League Phase of the Champions League was made this week, Rodrygo expressed his desire to win Europe’s premier club competition with Madrid.\nRodrygo has already won the Champions League twice with Madrid and is keen on helping Los Blancos become the champions of Europe for the 16th time in history.\nA por la 16! 🏆#UCL https://t.co/w3EejDM4VM\n— Rodrygo Goes (@RodrygoGoes) August 28, 2025\nLatest Liverpool news: Alexander Isak ‘done deal’, Aston Villa raid\nLiverpool have a deal in place with Newcastle United for Alexander Isak, according to a journalist, although other sources have not backed this claim.\nA Liverpool defender is on his way out of Anfield, while a second Reds star could join them playing in the same domestic league abroad.\nLiverpool are planning to raid Aston Villa for a star attacking player, although TEAMtalk understands that the defending Premier League champions will have to cough up a lot of cash.",
