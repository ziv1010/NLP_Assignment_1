A quick glance at Paris Saint-Germain’s attackers and it is hard to argue with the marketing.\nAnd away from the glitz and glamour of the capital, Ligue 1 academies continue to thrive. With reliable routes to the first team, some of the biggest stars of the 21st century have emerged from Ligue 1 clubs — from Lyon to Le Havre and Monaco and Marseille.\nAdvertisement\nAs the Premier League’s pulling power only grows stronger, The Athletic takes you through 10 players who are sure to be on the radar of England’s biggest clubs this summer…\nChampions League chasers\nKhephren Thuram (Nice, 22, midfielder)\nThis could be the summer Thuram gets his big move.\nThe son of former France international Lilian and brother of new Inter Milan signing Marcus, the gifted midfielder has regularly been linked with Liverpool and Newcastle.\nFor now, Dominik Szoboszlai’s arrival at Anfield appears to have dampened hopes of a link-up with Jurgen Klopp’s side, but it still seems only a matter of time before Thuram (right in top image) takes the next step in a career that promises so much.\nAlready a full France international — he made his debut for France against the Netherlands aged just 21 back in March — Thuram plays with a swagger befitting his reputation.\nCapable of playing at the base of midfield, he is at his best in a box-to-box role where he can use his imposing 6ft 3in (192cm) frame to drive forwards into the inside left channel and link with the attack. As his smarterscout pizza chart highlights, he is a confident dribbler who retains the ball well, keeping the play ticking over with plenty of link-up passes to team-mates.\nThuram has previously cited Paul Pogba as one of his idols and he chose to wear No 19 at Nice in part because it was Pogba’s number when he made his international debut.\nWith a fair wind, Thuram may end up being his long-term successor at international level.\nAxel Disasi (Monaco, 25, centre-back)\nDisasi is Monaco’s recruitment strategy writ large.\nSigned at 22 from Reims in 2020 for a reported fee of €13million (£12m; $15m), the imposing centre-back has become one of the standout defenders in Ligue 1.\nUnder sporting director Paul Mitchell and ex-head of recruitment Laurence Stewart (now at Chelsea), Monaco shifted to a model focused on buying and developing top young talent for resale purposes. In recent seasons, Aurelien Tchouameni (Real Madrid), Benoit Badiashile (Chelsea) and Sofiane Diop (Nice) have all been sold for sizeable fees.\nAdvertisement\nBlending strong progressive passing with towering physicality, it would be little surprise if Disasi became the next high-profile player to leave Monaco. Recent reports have linked him with both Manchester United and Newcastle United, with a potential fee of around €40million touted.\nDisasi appears to have all the elements needed to succeed in the Premier League.\n“My size is an advantage, I am comfortable in the air and in my sense of anticipation,” he said, after signing for Monaco.\n“I also try to play the ball out from the back cleanly, to have fun on the pitch and above all to follow the coach’s instructions. I’m a player who works for the team and I hope to bring my defensive strength to bear.”\nJonathan David (Lille, 23, striker)\nAfter three seasons of transfer rumours, Canada’s golden boy looks set to move on.\nOff the back of a record 24-goal season, the Lille forward (left in top image) has an asking price of €60million-€65m, which leaves only the biggest clubs in Europe able to afford him.\nTwo-footed, clinical and comfortable with the ball at his feet, David’s shot map shows that he is a high-volume, high-quality shot-taker, pointing to good movement inside the penalty area. He is able to finish across the width of the box from a variety of angles and awkward positions, with 30.8 per cent of his Ligue 1 goals coming from his weaker left foot.\nOn top of this, he ranks in the top 20 per cent of Ligue 1 strikers for both progressive passes received and key passes completed. Combined with a passing accuracy of 81.8 per cent, he is a reliable target for the progressive midfielder — find David with a forward pass, and he will find a team-mate or a route to goal.\nDavid’s 10 penalties last campaign helped to boost his goal-scoring numbers dramatically, but the Canadian is still one of Europe’s premium strikers when it comes to generating danger around the penalty area.\nAdvertisement\nRayan Cherki (Lyon, 19, attacking midfielder)\nEven at 19, Cherki stands out as one of Ligue 1’s great entertainers. His highlights reel is a dazzling array of surging runs and elegant flicks.\nVersatile enough to play any role behind the central striker, the Lyon academy graduate has the innate ability to get bums off seats. Predominantly left-footed, he possesses the close control and squat physique to manoeuvre past opponents in tight situations and maintain possession.\nLast season was his most productive yet, with four goals and six assists in 34 Ligue 1 appearances. As we can see from the tile map below, Cherki accumulated more expected assists than any team-mate last campaign, averaging 3.2 key passes per game. In the end, he was probably unfortunate not to have more goal contributions to his name.\nMore recently, he impressed on France’s run to the quarter-finals of this summer’s Under-21 European Championship.\nOne of the standout moments in Cherki’s fledgling career so far came in the 3-1 victory over Monaco in May, where he pirouetted in the box to set up Maxence Caqueret for Lyon’s second, before sealing three points himself by cutting in from the left and firing home.\nThere is still room for further growth, particularly with his headline numbers in the attacking third.\nBut the potential is substantial. Only Lille’s Edon Zhegrova managed more box entries (combined passes and carries into the box) per 90 minutes than Cherki in 2022-23. Add a more clinical edge, and you have a player destined for the top.\nEven more is expected in the years ahead, while links with Chelsea and others are not going away.\nEuropa League chasers\nJeremy Doku (Rennes, 21, winger)\nIt feels as if Doku has been on the cusp of brilliance for a while, but there were encouraging signs of a genuine career take-off towards the end of the 2022-23 season.\nAdvertisement\nThe young winger (middle in top image) is a dribbling machine, first making waves across Europe as Belgium’s 19-year-old wildcard at Euro 2020. Impressing against Finland, and winning a penalty against eventual champions Italy, Doku’s fearless, driving runs left the world wanting more.\nUnfortunately, Doku was plagued by injuries in the season that followed, limited to just 469 minutes of Ligue 1 action, but glimpses of his breathless style continued to captivate.\nHis rate of 10 take-ons per game might look like a low-sample-size skew, but Doku went even better last campaign, averaging 11.1 take-ons across more than 14 full games, all while maintaining an impressive 60.4 per cent success rate.\nAnd when it comes to running at defenders, no one in Europe comes close.\nThe 21-year-old added end product to his performances as the season drew to a close, scoring five times and assisting twice in the final eight games. Out-scoring his expected goals by 3.3, only seven Ligue 1 players were statistically more clinical in front of goal.\nIn that kind of form, there are few more devastating wingers.\nBradley Barcola (Lyon, 20, winger)\nAnother player who shone at the Under-21 European Championship this summer, Barcola is a similarly electric winger — tall for his position at 6ft 1in, but frighteningly direct with the ball at his feet.\nTearing down either flank, the 20-year-old developed a lethal partnership with Alexandre Lacazette throughout his debut campaign, supplying seven assists for the former Arsenal front-man last season.\nOnly Kevin De Bruyne and Lionel Messi provided more for a single player in Europe’s big five leagues; doing so to Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe respectively.\nBarcola was at the heart of one of 2022-23’s greatest games, providing three assists for Lacazette in a stunning 5-4 comeback win over Montpellier. He is unpredictable with the ball at his feet, possessing a searing burst of pace to make those runs in behind.\nThe king of cutbacks. pic.twitter.com/POHWTyLp0B\n— Alex (@alexfrco) July 9, 2023\nWith barely 19 full games to his name in his professional career, a move for Barcola would not be without risk — although his 16 goal contributions underline his devastating efficiency at such a young age.\nPair him up with an elite close-range finisher, and Barcola will lay the chances on a plate.\nAdvertisement\nFacundo Medina (Lens, 24, centre-back)\nIn the modern game, centre-backs who can move the ball upfield — escaping the opposition press and breaking the lines with punchy forward passes — are a must. Centre-backs who can do all of that on their left foot are at a premium.\nMedina has the technical ability of a midfielder and thrives at the back for Franck Haise’s Lens, operating in a wide centre-back role that encouraged him to progress the ball down the left channel as much as possible to start attacks.\nOf all centre-backs in Ligue 1 last season, Medina carried the ball the furthest and played the most passes into the final third, completing 76.4 passes per game with an accuracy of 90.2 per cent. Across Europe, too, he stands out from the rest.\nAn aggressive defender in those wide areas, the Argentina international will surely be a tempting option for any team looking to build from the back and defend with three centre-backs and two holding midfielders, able to play similarly to Nathan Ake’s role at Manchester City.\nLens are in the Champions League next season — a level Medina will grace given his progress.\nMid-table and bottom half\nBrice Samba (Lens, 29, goalkeeper)\nSamba is never far from the spotlight.\nRegular watchers during his time at Nottingham Forest will recall the straight red he received for lashing out at Stoke City’s Phil Jagielka in 2022.\nYet away from the bluster and noise, the France international’s quality has rarely been in doubt.\nA hero of Forest’s play-off run at the end of the 2021-22 season, he saved three penalties in the semi-final shoot-out against Sheffield United.\nLooking more generally at the data, Samba consistently outperforms the expected numbers. Using post-shot expected goals (psxG) data to measure the quality of shots he faces, we can compare the number of goals that the average goalkeeper would expect to concede with the actual total allowed.\nAdvertisement\nHis over-performance of 6.5 in his final season at Nottingham Forest, for example, suggests that he prevented over six goals throughout the season, keeping out more shots than the data would expect.\nSamba has excelled since leaving the City Ground later that summer, having informed the club of his decision not to extend his contract.\nHelped by his outstanding performances in goal, Lens secured a surprise second-place finish last season. With a league-high 15 clean sheets in 37 matches, the ex-Forest stopper was also named in the Ligue 1 Team of the Season.\nEarlier this year, he earned his first cap for the French national team and, at 29, Samba still has plenty more to give.\nSalis Abdul Samed (Lens, 23, central midfielder)\nReplicating Cheick Doucoure’s influence at the heart of the Lens midfield is no mean feat, but Abdul Samed has done just that.\nSuch was his impact that Lens were able to recover from the loss of his fellow JMG Academy graduate and somehow get stronger.\nSigned from Clermont last summer, the Ghana international quickly forged a formidable partnership in the centre of the pitch with club captain Seko Fofana.\nReliable in possession, the 23-year-old is a tenacious ball-winner with the engine to cover vast swathes of ground. Under the tutelage of Haise and Fofana, his work on the ball is improving too, with Abdul Samed showing an impressive ability to evade opposition tackles and surge forwards to join the attack.\nHis smarterscout pizza chart shows that ball retention and metronomic build-up play are his bread and butter, with time to hone his progressive game as he gains more experience at the top level.\n“I feel as though I’ve improved offensively from my Clermont days, ” he told Get French Football last season. “But also in terms of recovering the ball.\n“Beforehand, I would win the ball back and pass it along — now, when I win the ball back, I can also bring it up the pitch myself. I’m more confident in that regard. I really feel free in the way I play here.”\nIt has been a rapid rise, but next season could be his best yet.\nAdvertisement\nJonathan Bamba (Free agent, 27, winger)\nFree agent Bamba is unlikely to be short of interest this summer, having left Lille at the end of his contract.\nReports in recent months have linked the Ivory Coast international with Fiorentina, Real Betis, Sevilla and, more recently, Marseille. Whoever signs him will be getting a player with a proven track record in one of Europe’s top leagues.\nA mainstay in the Lille side since his arrival in 2018, Bamba scored 13 times in his first season to help Les Dogues to a second-place finish. Part of the team that won the Ligue 1 title in 2020-21, Bamba also managed six goals and seven assists last season prior to his departure.\nAble to play on either flank and active out of possession, Bamba would be a good pick-up for a side looking to strengthen their attack on a budget.\n(Top photos: Getty Images.
