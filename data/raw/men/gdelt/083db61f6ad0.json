They have a very good attack, I can’t deny it. But tomorrow will be tomorrow. I am not scared at all, it’s a football game,” Mahrez added.\n“We have our own quality, we have our strengths, and I think it will be a good game.”\nNigeria have netted 12 goals in four matches to become the tournament’s highest scorers, with Victor Osimhen, Ademola Lookman and Akor Adams leading the charge. Algeria, by contrast, have conceded just once across their four matches, building their campaign on defensive solidity.\nMahrez, 34, also revealed that this would be his last AFCON tournament, adding extra motivation to his quest for a second continental title.\n“I want to do well. I think it will be my last Africa Cup of Nations. I don’t want to look too far ahead. Right now, I just want to focus on the next game and give everything, because it is very important for our country, our supporters and our families,” he said.\nThe Algeria captain made his international debut in 2014 and has since earned over 100 caps, scoring 37 goals. His club career has been equally glittering, with Premier League titles won at Leicester City and Manchester City, as well as a Champions League crown with the latter.\nHowever, his greatest moment in international football came in 2019 when he helped Algeria lift the AFCON in Egypt. That campaign included a memorable late free-kick against Nigeria in the semi-finals, a moment that still haunts Nigerian fans and one he will hope to echo in Marrakech.\n“I think obviously there is pressure to win the game. Obviously, both teams want to go through. We are both great teams, and it will be the best at the game that will go through. And I hope it will be us,” Mahrez said.\n“We have to make everything to perform in our best way.”\nMahrez has been one of the standout performers of the competition so far, scoring three goals as Algeria powered into the last eight with a perfect record. Alongside the Super Eagles, the Desert Warriors are the only team to have won all four of their matches in Morocco.",
