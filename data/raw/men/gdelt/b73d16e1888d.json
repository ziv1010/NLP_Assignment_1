Indeed, their success in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final marked a first trophy in six years for the Red Devils.\nHowever, the best may be yet to come with United looking to make further progress in both the FA Cup and Europa League. Success in the latter would also book United a place back in the Champions League too; something that was always their main ambition this season.\nThat said, they look just as well placed to secure a return to Europe’s premier competition through a top-four finish too. To that end, United are currently third and well placed to be playing in the UCL again next season.\nThat will further increase United’s spending power and their appeal this summer as a result. And with Ten Hag likely to focus on quality rather than quantity this time around, speculation is mounting on who they might bring in.\nTop of Ten Hag’s priorities is a new big-name striker with Victor Osimhen persistently linked.\nHowever, any deal for the Napoli frontman looks tricky with a huge fee being bandied around for the Nigerian.\nIn addition, Ten Hag also wants to strengthen his midfield and his defence.\nTo that end, the United boss is reportedly on the trail of a number of right-backs, while a new centre half could also be brought in.\nREAD MORE: Man Utd must sell to buy? What Ten Hag’s Carabao Cup winners might fetch and where they could go…\nTen Hag opens up on chances of signing Weghorst and Sabitzer\nHowever, there may well be departures too, as Ten Hag looks to move on any players who do not figure in his plans.\nAs a result, the Dutchman could look to streamline his playing in order to free up space for new arrivals.\nTwo men who arrived at Old Trafford on temporary basis in January are Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer.\nWeghorst, in particular, has played regular football since his loan arrival, featuring in 12 games and scoring once.\nSabitzer, meanwhile, has also been called upon following his loan move from Bayern Munich. The Austrian has featured five times and already has a winners’ medal to his name.\nAs a result, both players have already made clear their desires to make their stays permanent.\nSabitzer’s agent, Roger Wittmann, claims the player is enjoying his football again.\n“At Manchester United we see Marcel from Leipzig again. I’m very happy for him,” he told Sport1. Asked what happens in the summer, he replied: “We’ll see when the time comes.”\nWeghorst, speaking shortly after signing, has also made clear his wish to stay.\n“It is fantastic to be here. The atmosphere, the away fans, the game that waves up and down. Wonderful. I’ve been here for over a week now. It’s going well.”\nAsked if he wants to stay, he responded: “Of course. But first I have to make sure I can be of value to the team and this club.”\nTen Hag offers cautious response to double deal\nDespite both players making their feelings clear, Ten Hag is refusing to give anything away at this stage.\nAnd he says all the focus has to be on the club’s matters in hand, with any transfer decisions on hold until the summer.\n“I think it’s much too quick, much too soon to talk about that,” the Dutchman said. “First, we are in this season. That is where the only focus has to be. No distractions for what is coming next season.\n“No, we are in this season and we are in the right positon in this moment. This is the position we want to be because we are competing in three competitions.”\nThe Dutchman is right to hang fire. With the pair both hoping to earn permanent stays, he can use that hunger to get the best out of them both.\nAnd while neither is likely to be especially expensive, Ten Hag will be keen to wait before making any firm decisions.",
