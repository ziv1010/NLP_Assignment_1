  "body_text": "Former FIFA World Cup winner Christian Karembeu believes upgraded facilities and human resources are critical to help move football in the islands forward.\nKarembeu, who was born in New Caledonia and played for France in their 1998 World Cup victory, was guest at the Oceania Football Under-15 Boys Development Tournament held in Auckland over the past week.\nHe praised the regional youth tournaments and development programs as an 'essential pathway' for footballers across the Pacific Islands and Oceania.\nHe spoke to reporters at a press conference and zoom session on Easter Monday and praised the Auckland event and said having facilities and upgraded human resources are critical as well.\n\"What we're missing in the region are facilities and qualified human resources,\" he said.\n\"It's not just about the players, it's also about educating coaches, technical staff and administrators. That's what UEFA Together is helping us do.\"\nKarembeu, who attended the event in Auckland as part of the UEFA partnership with the OFC, said he did not go through youth development programs such as the Under-15 tournament.\n\"I never had this kind of opportunity,\" he said.\n\"This initiative is a great vision for our kids, our youths to develop themselves, improve their skills.\n\"These boys are very lucky. To have a tournament like this at U15 level, supported by UEFA and OFC, is a real privilege. It gives them international experience, exposure, and helps them understand what it takes to improve and pursue their dreams.\"\nHe said tournaments like the OFC U15 Development Tournament is an important first step for players, even before dreaming about professional football or playing in World Cups.\n\"They need competitions like this. It's where development starts and for me, being here to support and inspire them is part of my responsibility,\" reflected Karembeu, who won two UEFA Champions League titles with Real Madrid during his career.\nThe long-term goal, he said, is to see more nations from the Pacific competing regularly at FIFA tournaments.\nHe said Oceania's increasing presence in youth World Cups (three teams from Oceania, New Zealand, Fiji and New Caledonia will compete at this year's FIFA U-17 World Cup in Qatar).\nHe noted that several players from the 2023 U-17 World Cup had previously taken part in the U-15 Boys Development Tournament - evidence of real progress.\nNew Caledonia's chances\nBeyond the pitch, he believes football has a bigger role to play.\n\"In New Caledonia, we are facing social and political challenges,\" he said.\n\"Football can be a solution. It can unite people, give young people something to believe in, and provide them with opportunities.\"\nOn that note, he shared his thoughts about his own fellow countrymen from New Caledonia, who have a chance to qualify for the FIFA World Cup.\nNew Caledonia compete at next year's 2026 FIFA World Cup Inter-Confederation Playoff, to be played in March.\nThey lost to New Zealand at the final of the OFC qualifiers.\nKerembeu said he is keen to help both teams in whatever way he can, to ensue that Oceania has two teams at the world meet, adding New Caledonia will now also need to get some top competitive matches moving forward.\n\"I hope they will accomplish something great, not only for New Caledonia but also for the region,\" he said.\n\"I hope we will be the second team in that competition because it's going to be big impact. If New Caledonia go through we have at least great visibility for our region.\n\"The idea is this, I think that we need the competitors, opponents, to prepare them for a bigger achievement.\"\nSupport for new pro-league\nKarembeu, who works at Greek Super League club Olympiacos, has also shown strong support for the OFC Professional League, which is set to kick off in January, 2026.\n\"For me, it's a revolution. It's going to change football in the Pacific,\" he told the media.\n\"But federations need to be ready. A professional league brings responsibility, structure and higher standards. It's not just about passion anymore: it becomes a job, a daily commitment.\"\nKerembeu said the league can also become a pathway for players to earn contracts in other leagues around the globe, and he has called on players who will be part of the competition to take their chance.\n\"I think that one game can be a change for any players,\" he said.\n\"It doesn't matter the tournament, but one game can give a chance or opportunity to any players from the region, to be able to be seen, watched and maybe to think about the transfer to Europe.\n\"Because the chance is there, the experience is there, the opportunity is there. Now they need to grab it. They need to play. And hopefully we know that the scout is everywhere in the world, now it's digital. We can see how they play and how we can recruit.\"\nKerembeu, who was born and raised in Lifou, New Caledonia, won two UEFA Champions League titles with Real Madrid during his career.",
