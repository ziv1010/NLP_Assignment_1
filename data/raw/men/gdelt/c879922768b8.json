  "body_text": "Thomas Tuchel has cut three players from his matchday squad, including Bukayo Saka, ahead of England’s World Cup qualifier against Andorra.\nAtletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher as well as Ollie Watkins, who has been carrying a minor injury, have also been omitted.\nArsenal star Saka, a mainstay of England’s successful sides under Gareth Southgate, endured a season cut short in its prime by the hamstring tear he sustained back in November.\nThe 23-year-old made his planned return in April and starred in Arsenal’s run to the semi finals of the Champions League but scored only three times in 13 games after making his comeback.\nTuchel revealed at Friday’s pre-match press conference that Saka had managed to complete just one full training session this week and his absence is likely linked to his lack of fitness, according to the BBC.\nSaka is yet to feature for England since Tuchel’s appointment and it remains to be seen whether or not he will remain with the squad ahead of next week’s friendly against Senegal.\nRegardless of Saka’s fitness, the Three Lions are expected to make short work of this evening’s opponents Andorra, who are ranked 173rd in the world, and continue their 100% start to qualification with a third successive win.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

The players come from a short break of holiday, from a long and tiring season and then accepting again the role.\n‘It can be demanding but what I feel from the group is they are to be here.\n‘We are quite new together, it’s our second camp and I have trust and belief that we will do what is necessary to get the result that we want.\nMore Trending\n‘We want a win. We want a clear and solid win that is never in danger. This is what we expect from us tomorrow.\n‘It is important not to over expect from us in terms of already a clear result, biggest chances, goals already after 10-20 minutes, and get impatient and get frustrated with ourselves.\n‘I think it’s a test to our patience. Andorra played against Spain and it was 1-0 at half-time with a set-piece.\n‘It’s a World Cup qualifier. Respect your opponent, you respect the quality, the defensive organisation of your opponent and you understand how difficult it is to break down.’\nMORE: Reece James reacts to Chelsea’s signing of in-demand striker Liam Delap\nMORE: Why are England playing Andorra in Spain?
