There was no immediate comment from Hamas.\nIn a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu had expressed his hope that Abu Obeida had been killed. \"We still don't know the final result. I hope he is no longer with us, but I notice that there is no one to address this question on the Hamas side. So, hours and days will surely say what they will say,\" he said.\nHamas has, meanwhile, confirmed the death of Mohammed Sinwar, its presumed leader in Gaza, more than three months after Israel said it had killed him in an air strike.\nPictures released by the Palestinian armed group showed him alongside other political and military leaders described as \"martyrs of the military council\".\nMohammed Sinwar was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the former Hamas chief, who co-masterminded the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, and whom Israel had killed in combat a year later.\nHe reportedly led the Ezzedine Al Qassam Brigades' military council after the death of commander Mohammed Deif.\nIsrael said it had identified Mohammed Sinwar's body in June in a tunnel in Khan Younis, central Gaza. The military said it had \"eliminated\" him on May 13.\nBorn in Khan Younis in 1975, Mohammed Sinwar joined Hamas as a teenager and was arrested in 1991 for suspected involvement in terrorism. He was also jailed by the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah during the 1990s.\nAfter the killing of Mohammed Deif in July last year, he took charge of the group’s armed wing. After his elder brother's death, he became de facto leader of Hamas in Gaza.\nThe war in Gaza began with a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and 251 taken hostage. Twenty of the remaining 48 hostages are believed to still be alive.\nIsrael's military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 63,000 people, mostly civilians, Gaza health officials say, and it has plunged the enclave into a humanitarian crisis and left much of it in ruins.\nSince the war began, Israel has carried out a series of assassinations targeting senior leaders and commanders of Hamas and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, significantly weakening both groups.\nIsrael has dealt Hezbollah heavy blows in the past two years, killing many of its top brass, including former leader Hassan Nasrallah and 5,000 of its fighters, and destroying much of its arsenal.\nIsrael has also been targeting Yemen's rebels, who have been launching drone and missile attacks on Israel in support of the Palestinians in Gaza.\nAn Israeli air strike killed the prime minister of the Houthi rebel-controlled government in Yemen's capital Sanaa, the Houthis said Saturday. He was the most senior Houthi official killed in the Israeli-US campaign against the Iranian-backed rebels.\nAhmed Ghaleb Al Rahwi was killed in Thursday's strike in Sanaa along with a number of ministers, the rebels said.\nThe prime minister was targeted along with other members of his Houthi-controlled government during a “routine workshop held by the government to evaluate its activities and performance over the past year”, the Houthis said.\nOn Sunday, the leader of the Houthi rebels vowed to intensify attacks on Israel, after Mr Al Rahwi's death.\n\"Our military approach to targeting the Israeli enemy, whether with missiles, drones, or a naval blockade, is continuous, steady and escalating,\" the Iran-backed group's leader Abdul-Malik Al Houthi said in a televised speech. \"Our path to support the Palestinian people continues in all areas with all our capabilities.\"\nHans Grundberg, UN special envoy for Yemen, said he was \"Following with deep concern the recent escalation in Yemen, where areas under Houthi control have come under Israeli attack following the Houthis' own strikes against Israel,\" a UN statement said.\nMr Grundberg reiterated that Yemen cannot afford to become a battleground for a wider geopolitical conflict and stressed that these attacks must stop immediately.\nHe is \"particularly alarmed by reports of civilian deaths and injuries resulting from the Israeli strikes, as well as the reported killing and wounding of several senior Houthi officials and political interlocutors,\" the statement added.\nOn Sunday, the Houthis raided offices of the UN food and children's agencies in Yemen’s capital, detaining at least one UN employee, officials said.\nAbeer Etefa, a spokeswoman for the World Food Programme (WFP), told AP that security forces raided the agencies’ offices in the Houthi-controlled capital on Sunday morning.\nAlso raided were Unicef offices, according to a UN official and a Houthi official.\nAmmar Ammar, a spokesman for Unicef, said there was “an ongoing situation” related to their offices in Sanaa, without providing further details.\nThe UN official said contacts with several other WFP and Unicef staffers were lost and that they had probably also been detained.\nThe raids were the latest in a long-running Houthi crackdown against the UN and other international organisations working in rebel-held areas in Yemen.\nThey have detained dozens of UN staff workers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the now-closed US embassy in Sanaa.\nThe UN suspended its operations in the Houthi stronghold of Saada in northern Yemen after the rebels detained eight UN staffers in January.",
