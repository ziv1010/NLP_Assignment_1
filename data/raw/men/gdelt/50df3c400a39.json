  "body_text": "Renée Slegers and Mariona Caldentey have held a press conference at Sobha Realty Training Centre ahead of our Champions League semi-final clash against Lyon.\nOur head coach and midfielder were asked questions about our history in the competition, our opponents and any early team news.\nHere is everything they had to say:\non Chloe Kelly and Alessia Russo’s availability…\nRS: Alessia and Chloe are both going to be available for the game tomorrow.\non any other team news…\nRS: It’s the ones we’ve spoken about before [Laia Codina, Lina Hurtig] and Daphne van Domselaar won’t be available.\non our journey to the UWCL semi-finals…\nRS: We started this journey early in the season with the mini tournament, and we're here now. Us beating Madrid and doing what we did in the way we did it, we're so happy with that.\nNow we’re going into the semi-final. Of course, we understand the challenge that we're facing across these two games, because we know Lyon are very experienced. They’ve been here many times before, so we have huge respect for the players and their history. But we're happy that we're here, that we put ourselves in this situation, and this is exactly where we want to be.\non our belief levels and our comeback against Real Madrid…\nRS: Yes, that was a good moment. I think we believed so much that we could do it in that game, because of other things that we had been doing in the season before. I think the team keeps on proving, time after time, what we're capable of. There have been some key moments that we come to in the season that make you believe what we can do.\nOf course, the Madrid game at home, I think the composure under pressure, the way we played our game on a very high level, we set ourselves new standards, and we did it in this critical moment. Where we come from 45 minutes 0-0, half time, and then we have to do it in the second half. So I think that was a good moment for us as a team.\non what it takes to win the Champions League…\nMC: I think we are here because we deserve to be here. We were top of the group against Bayern, for example, big team. We beat Real Madrid. So we have to believe that we are here because we deserve it. Now we face Lyon and they’re a top, top team, and we have to respect that. But we have to have no fear. We respect them, but we want to go for it. It's two games, and the first one is at home with our fans, so we are there for that. We are so excited to play. We have our football as well, and we want to show to the world. And hopefully, it’ll be good for everyone.\non whether Mariona has spoken about her previous experience of winning the tournament…\nMC: Well, we do speak a lot about life and about football, because we spend a lot of time together, but I think the team has the mentality to win as well, so that's the most important. I think that’s a bit contagious as well. So, like I said, we want to win because, of course, Champions League is a big one. We are still far away right now. It's three games for that, but we have to start tomorrow.\nI think everyone is hungry for a title, so this mentality, we need to keep it. We need to improve every day, and we are there because we deserve it. We are four of the best teams in Europe, and we are one of them, so we want to go for more.\non the success of the men’s team in the Champions League…\nRS: Yeah, so I really feel like since I've come to the club that it's one club. I've naturally been in contact with the assistant coach on the men's side, because he's Dutch. But after we won against Madrid, I got messages from everyone across the club, including Mikel, and he said it was inspirational, and if you look at what they now did against Madrid, I think it's so strong.\nI think they look like a team, and I think that's why they won against Madrid with so much individual quality, so it's amazing to be part of this. There was just some media here at the club and Jurrien Timber is sitting there and he says, ‘Renée, good luck for tomorrow’. So the guys also know what we are doing, and we know what they are doing, and we support each other, so it's great.\non a special feeling at the training ground right now…\nMC: Well, this game is the game that everyone wants to play. We are ready for it. It is a special competition and a special environment as well. We play at home and that's even more special, so we are happy to be here.\nWe have to enjoy the moment, because we work so hard every day for long months to be where we are today, so I think that's our gift to ourselves, and we just need to do what we have to do, and I'm sure we will be fine.\non Lyon’s current form versus their illustrious history…\nRS: Like I just said, huge respect for their history and what they have been doing and producing in the Champions League, in Europe. I think they're still a very strong side. But like Mariona just mentioned, us playing at the Emirates and the hunger and the belief that we have IN the team at the moment, we're going to go and play our game the best we can. We believe that even though with huge respect to the individual qualities and threats that they will bring to the game, we believe we can do something tomorrow and we're going to go for it.\non making the most of the first leg…\nRS: That's going to be important tomorrow because of course, Madrid, we play them away first and then we play at home. We don't wait for anything tomorrow. We know that tomorrow is our chance. I think 40,000 tickets sold. There will be an enormous crowd. We're going to go and go from the start because we enjoy playing at the Emirates. We're at one of the final stages of the Champions League. It's a huge moment and we're going to do it here in London at the Emirates. We want to go for it and we want to take the opportunity by the throat - do you say so in English?\non whether Russo and Kelly will be fit to play 90 minutes tomorrow…\nRS: They will be fully available, so that’s great. I think both players have been working really, really hard to get to this point, together with the medical team. So, that's great. They are available for a lot of minutes tomorrow.\non whether there’s anything to learn from our quarter-final comeback…\nRS: I think this is just a different scenario where we play home first and then away. Like I just said, we want to take this opportunity to play at the Emirates in front of 40,000 people in the stands. In that sense, it's totally different. We're going to want to start fast and we want to go for it at the Emirates tomorrow. That's going to be key for us. We want to get the best result possible tomorrow. Then we'll see what that is. Then we go to Lyon the week after.\non Renée’s previous experience with Joe Montemurro…\nRS: [Joe] was actually my mentor when I was part of a UEFA mentorship programme, I think five or six years ago. I actively asked for him as my mentor because I heard a lot of good things about his leadership, his football philosophy and how he is as a person.\nIt was great working with him. I learned a lot of things. I was visiting him here at Arsenal when he was working here. I know Joe and he knows me and he knows the club and the players as well. Of course, a lot of things have changed since he left. It's going to be a great encounter and I look forward to seeing him tomorrow.\non whether she’s spoken to Joe recently…\nRS: No, I think the last exchange was one or two months ago, so not in a while.\non whether Renée will rely on Mariona’s previous experience…\nRS: Mariona has been there. She did it last year. Mariona is a winner in everything. In every single drill in training, she wants to win. That's what she's bringing to this team.\nShe's moving the culture forward and we're learning a lot from Mariona.\non Mariona’s first season at Arsenal…\nMC: I'm so happy to be here. I feel like home from the first day. Everyone has helped me a lot. I thought I would maybe need some time to adapt because it's a big change for me. But to be honest, everyone in the club, on the team, has made that process so easy for me.\nSo I feel really comfy and I can play my football. I can enjoy it. I think that's the best thing. That's when you can perform and when you feel yourself and comfy. I think I'm in the right place. I am where I want to be. I just hope we keep working how we are doing and I'm sure the titles and the good moments will arrive for the club because I think that's what we deserve.\non why English clubs haven’t made the final consistently in the past…\nMC: I just think it's so hard to be there because there are a lot of good teams. Everyone is working hard because everyone wants to be there. I think Lyon was so successful for a lot of years in a row. Now lately, Barca as well.\nI think English clubs have been there as well. I remember we played the final against Chelsea three years ago or four years ago. English clubs are there. They are top teams. But it's not that easy because everyone wants to be there. Now it's four teams and two of them are English, so I think that's a sign as well. We'll see what happens and hopefully one English club can be in the final and hopefully it's us.\non whether Daphne will be fit for the second leg of the semi-final…\nRS: So, Daphne is progressing really well, so we'll see when she can be available for us again. I can't share any more, but it just seems her progression is going well.\non whether Renée will take inspiration from how the men tackled the first leg against Real Madrid…\nRS: Very much so. The way the men’s team executed that game as the first of two legs, that’s how we want to go and with this game tomorrow and that was very inspiring to see. Also, similar maybe in the threats in Madrid that they had to nullify, and we have some challenges ahead of us as well. So, it was inspirational to watch, and I think how they’ve managed to go about these two legs, I think is very positive and inspiring and I’m very happy that they achieved what they achieved. I think this is the first time in club history that we're both in the semi-finals.\non Mariona’s versatile role across the pitch…\nMC: All I want is to be on the pitch and play like that's all that matters for us, and I’m ready for whatever the team or the coach asks of me, I just love to be around the ball and with contact on the ball. I’m happy to play anywhere and just be on the pitch and try to bring what I can bring and make everything easier for my teammates and how they do for me. It's easy to play with this team.\non how Barcelona worked to consistently reach the latter stages of the Champions League…\nMC: What I’ve learnt is that talent is not enough, you need to work hard, you need to be fit and be ready for that match, for the physical momentum as well. It’s not that easy and does take time. It needs teamwork and that is what we’re building here now. I can feel it, I can see how much we’ve improved already with that month, so sometimes we are impatient, and we want to see everything already, but sometimes football takes some time. So, I think we need to believe in what we are doing and the Arsenal way, how we want to play, what we are doing and we are there, we are on the way, and we just need to keep going.\non the significance of getting a great result against Lyon…\nRS: That's what we're going for tomorrow, but then we also know that football is unpredictable and it could also go on the post into the goal or on the post outside the goal. The margins are going to be small tomorrow because it's top teams playing against each other. It’s very important for us to get a good result tomorrow but at the same time, we know that this is two games. Tomorrow will only be half time, so there will still be a lot of work to do in Lyon as well, whatever the result tomorrow night. But we want to start well and like I said, we'll play at Emirates tomorrow with 40,000 people in the crowd. So, we look forward to it.\non whether Mariona can see Arsenal reaching that historic level of dominance again…\nMC: That’s what we want to do, we want to dominate our opponents in the games but football has changed in the last few years, its not easy to win every game and we have to evaluate every little thing we achieve because everyone is ready and everyone wants to beat us and everyone wants to win as well, so it’s hard in that sense but as I said we are doing a lot of good things, and in the right way. We have the quality, we have the mentality and that’s what we want and we’ll go for it.\non whether Mariona’s game has changed now she’s at Arsenal…\nMC: My role at Barcelona was quite similar, I started on the wing but I entered into a central position so I think that’s how I am, it didn’t change and it won’t change. We have to adapt to each other, but I think my game is exactly the same as it was in Barcelona, I am a team player in that sense. I love to pass and combine with everyone that’s how I enjoy football. I think even though my starting position is a bit different, my role is still exactly the same, so I feel comfy with that.\non what Mariona is expecting from the game tomorrow…\nMC: Lyon is a really big team, I respect Lyon a lot. They have such talented players and they are so dangerous, so it will be a tight game but we have to believe in ourselves and show to everyone we can be a top team, as well so it will be a tight game and how Renee said, it will be the small margins and small details, so we will have to be focused and take our opportunities and be solid in defence, because they are really dangerous in attack. It’s a semi-final, so it won’t be easy for sure.\non how Renee’s system with the squad has evolved…\nRS: I think framework and structure are important to be creative and I think creativity is important in my vision of football. I think if you want to get the best out of players, that room should be there. It also brings an unpredictability to the opposition because if we are all very structured and in our positions then I think any good team is going to be able to defend that so I think thats important and I’m happy with the steps that we’ve been taking so far. Actually, its some things you see in the game, I think it's the players bringing new things to the game as well, of course, we give them the freedom to express themselves. If you look at the Leicester game for example, against the player for player system, how well we recognise that we need to play players on the pressure and support on the needs and then go from there, that’s when you get out of your position but we’re all comfortable with that because we know that someone else will fill my role or my space. That’s something that’s been evolving, especially the last couple of months and it’s been a process together with the players, so I’m happy with the process and we want to take it even further.\non whether she’s excited about tomorrow…\nRS: I'm excited. Of course, there's a lot of hard work and preparation, and we need to be sharp on the day, both players and staff, so we have a task to do, and that's our job. But of course, we remind ourselves that we need to enjoy the moment, because we've been working so hard to come to these moments, and especially for the players, that's what they want to be, and that's the type of games they want to play. So, even though there are a lot of things we'll have to get right tomorrow and the task needs to be executed on a high level, we also need to enjoy what we're doing. And that all sounds good now, but tomorrow I'm not sure I'll just be in the moment and trying to make the decisions, but afterwards I can enjoy.\non whether Jessie Gale will be involved tomorrow…\nRS: She does train with us structurally, she does train with us and we like to have her with us. She comes and trains with us once or twice a week, so it’s really good to have her with us, and she’s progressing really well, but she won’t be in the squad tomorrow; she was just trying with us today.\non how important it is for our young players to gain that experience and train with the senior squad…\nRS: Like any training session with us, its learnings for these young players because I think we’re training on such a high level and they get to train with players like Mariona, so there’s so much learning but also the life of an Arsenal player, so everything you do from coming in morning until the meetings, the gym in the afternoon, so its also good for these younger players to get used to the routines of an Arsenal player.\non Mariona’s recognition in her first season in England…\nMC: It is amazing, of course, when you feel everyone recognises your work and effort, but I’ve always said the most important thing is the people you work with. Like your staff, your teammates, are the ones who recognise you and value you, so it’s nice and I’m happy with that.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
