Tournament football, given the number of fixtures cramped into a short space of time and the array of characters performing, will always supply moments of light-hearted fun.\nAnd Euro 2024 did certainly make us smile, maybe even chuckle, on occasions. Whether it be players, supporters, or pundits, or the tournament had its fair share of funnies.\nHere are five of the most comical moments from Euro 2024.\n1. Gary Neville's squeals\nA more than sturdy right-back for the best part of two decades, Gary Neville won title after title at Manchester United and is one of the most respected pundits in the sport, but many best remember him for his squeals on co-comms.\nNeville's off-field legacy continues to be defined by his live reaction to Fernando Torres' tie-sealing goal at the last against Barcelona to send Chelsea into the Champions League final. He's a squealer, that's for sure.\nThere's been less scope for uncomfortable high-pitched tones from Neville on the mic in recent years, although the former full-back is always good for a weekly \"OooOooOOOoh\" during the domestic season.\nNeville was on punditry duty for ITV during the tournament, and England's last-gasp magic throughout the knockout stages was always going to bring out the best of Neville, who represented the Three Lions 85 times. His reaction to Jude Bellingham's acrobatics against Slovakia was particularly brilliant. Celebrating alongside the equally jubilant Ian Wright, Neville produced a squealing utopia while Roy Keane watched on with folded arms barely notching an interest.\n2. Vitinha books Michael Oliver\nThere wasn't much to like about Portugal's quarter-final defeat to France, but at least midfield dynamo Vitinha gave viewers a moment of light-hearted humour.\nThe Portuguese international, who was primarily concerned with manipulating a staunch French rearguard and functional midfield, took a couple of seconds out of his outing to pick up the yellow card referee Michael Oliver had left behind.\nVitinha didn't exactly commit fully to booking the English referee, but the midfielder held the card just high enough to say he 'gave' Oliver a yellow card.\nSometimes, it's the little LOLs that matter.\n3. The target man renaissance\nThere was perhaps no bigger winner at Euro 2024 than the target man forward. They're back, or did they ever go away?\nThe evolution of the role has seen 'false nines' grow in prominence, with the aforementioned brute dwindling in significance. In an era when pressing reigns supreme, these 'utter woke', as some denote in jest, coaches opt against the bigger-boned and less mobile striker in favour of a more nimble alternative - one that can lead the press, run around all day, and drop into 'pockets of space' in a bid to confuse the defence.\nNonsense.\nFalse nines remained at Euro 2024, but there was room for a target man renaissance. Niclas Fullkrug lit up opening night off the bench for Germany, Wout Weghorst consistently changed games for the Dutch, while Martin Adam - not your typical-looking footballer in Euro 2024 - emerged as a viral sensation without ever doing much for Hungary.\nHis minimal impact is beside the point. The brutish forward is back in the game!\n4. Oh, Scotland...\nKieran Tierney's celebration for winning his country a... goal-kick in the opening exchanges of their clash with Germany set the tone for what was another miserable Euros for Scotland.\nYou might argue that Scotland's campaign peaked with Tierney's celebration six minutes into their 5-1 battering at the hands of hosts Germany on the opening night of the tournament.\nThe Tartan Army were a good laugh during their short stay, but Steve Clarke's side failed to match the energy brought by their travelling contingent.\nScott McTominay's strike against Switzerland on Matchday 2 offered the Scots a brief glimmer of hope, but they were on the hand of one of football's great traditions: a Xherdan Shaqiri major tournament screamer.\nTheir 1-1 draw with the Swiss meant a win against Hungary would've sent them into the last 16, but following 100 minutes of utterly drab action, Scotland were beaten at the death by Kevin Csoboth's strike.\nBut hey, things were worse at Euro 2020. So, there's that.\n5. Gareth Southgate's doppelganger\nOnce arrogant and aloof, English supporters have generally enjoyed a fine tournament out in Germany, and their best work may well have arrived ahead of the semi-final against the Netherlands.\nI mean, what else are you going to do when you spot a German police officer boasting a vague resemblance to Gareth Southgate?\nIt took a while for the England manager to garner his flowers for his work at Euro 2024, with the chant belted out in perpetuity during the summers of 2018 and 2021. It was hidden away while England struggled through the group stage, but as the Three Lions progressed through the knockouts, adoration for the manager returned and only grew.\nHowever, I must stress that the policeman captured in the video is not Southgate. Surrounded by a bunch of English folk with plastic cups in hand, all he can do is awkwardly stand and smile while his mates in uniform join in on the fun.\nNo arrests were made.",
