That, and the steep £50m asking price, has seen Bayern now look to highly-rated Bella-Kotchap in a bid to bolster Thomas Tuchel's options.\n16:25 - KOSTIC TO WEST HAM UNLIKELY\nWest Ham's chances of signing Filip Kostic from Juventus have diminished in the last few hours after further talks.\nThe Hammers would like to bring in more bodies but negotiations over the Serbian international have not led to an agreement.

We are so happy with him. Circumstances happen in the past that we can say nothing [about], we can only express our feeling from day one that we have started to work and he has shown great commitment to the club. We are happy with him, he was captain two days ago against Wimbledon, he is an important player. What is going to happen in the future, I cannot tell you.\"\n14:50 - MAN UTD NOT EXPECTING MCTOMINAY EXIT\nManchester United are not expecting to lose Scott McTominay before the transfer window closes, but do hope for movement in regards to Donny van de Beek and Eric Bailly.\nMcTominay also drawn interest from Bayern Munich, Fulham and Inter recently, with West Ham also admirers of the Scotland international.

PSG want a permanent sale which could play into the hands of the Bees.\n13:15 - BRIGHTON SNAP UP ANSU FATI ON LOAN\nWhat a move this is for Roberto De Zerbi and Brighton & Hove Albion.\nAnsu Fati, courted by some of the biggest clubs in the world and regarded as one of the best young talents to graduate from Barcelona's famed La Masia academy, has arrived on loan until the end of the season, helping to reduce a bulging Barca wage bill that has needed bringing under control.\nHe has 29 goals and ten assists to his name in 112 appearances for Barcelona.\n\"This is a great deal for all of us.

The Nigerian international is already in the capital to undergo a medical, and will strengthen Marco Silva's options both centrally and out wide.\nThe Cottagers are facing a battle to keep Joao Palhinha though - he's waiting for Bayern Munich to put forward a suitable offer that will allow him to move to Bavaria on a five-year contract.\n10:50 - UNITED CONFIDENT OF AMRABAT DEAL\nManchester United are confident of completing a deal for Fiorentina defensive midfielder Sofyan Amrabat before the deadline.\nThe Moroccan wants to move to Old Trafford but negotiations have been long and drawn out between the two clubs.

He'll now spend the season working under Steve Cooper, with the hope of securing a more long-term switch in the future.\n10:05 - REINIER LEAVES REAL MADRID\nIt's not a permanent exit for former wonderkid Reinier, but his latest loan move away from the Bernabeu would suggest his chances of ever breaking into the team are slim at best.\nNewly-promoted Frosinone is his latest destination, with the Brazilian no doubt hoping this spell in Serie A goes better than past moves to Borussia Dortmund and Girona.\n09:55 - GREENWOOD COULD LEAVE MAN UTD ON LOAN\nMason Greenwood's representatives are working to secure a transfer away from Manchester United.\nGreenwood hasn't played for United since January 2022 after being suspended by the club following charges of rape and assault against him. All charges were subsequently dropped after prosecutors admitted a conviction was unrealistic based on the withdrawal of key witnesses and new evidence.\nHis Old Trafford career is over, with United previously confirming in a statement that the club will move on without Greenwood, and 90min understands a move away is now in the works, potentially to Italy or Turkey - the latter's transfer deadline isn't until September 15.\n09:40 - KLOPP REAFFIRMS LIVERPOOL'S SALAH STANCE\nThere's significant cause for concern on Merseyside as the Saudi Pro League attempts to lure Mohamed Salah over to the Middle East to become the highest-paid player in the football.\nChampions Al Ittihad are keen to do a deal for Salah - backed by the rather deep pockets of PIF - and are willing to pay Liverpool in excess of £120m to get a deal over the line.\nThe Reds don't want to sell, for obvious reasons, but may find the money too good to turn down considering Salah is 31. Nevertheless, Jurgen Klopp told the media on Friday: \"Our position remains the same. No offer as far as I know.\"\n09:30 - IT'S OFFICIAL - CHELSEA GET THE DEAL DONE!\nChelsea have now confirmed Palmer's arrival at Stamford Bridge - he's inked a seven-year contract with the option of a further 12 months.\n\"I’m excited to get started and it feels great to sign.,\" Pamer said. \"I've joined Chelsea because the project here sounds good and because of the platform I will have to try to showcase my talents. It is a young and hungry squad and, hopefully, we can do something special here.\"\n09:20 - PALMER SAYS GOODBYE TO MANCHESTER CITY\nCole Palmer's move from Manchester City to Chelsea is on the verge of completion, and the young winger has taken to Instagram to post a message of thanks to all those who have supported him at the Premier League champions.\nThe Blues have committed to paying up to £45m for Palmer, who scored City's leveller against Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup final - a game they went on to win on penalties.\n09:15 - SOUTHAMPTON SIGN HARWOOD-BELLIS ON LOAN\nManchester City have allowed young central defender Taylor Harwood-Bellis out on loan again, this time to recently-relegated Southampton.\nThe 21-year-old was a key part of the Burnley team promoted to the Premier League last season, and followed up that achievement by playing a starring role in England's Under-21 European Championship success in the summer. But it's a return to the second tier for Harwood-Bellis after Vincent Kompany opted against trying to make the move permanent.\n09:10 - WEST HAM TRYING TO SIGN KOSTIC, BRAZIL DEALS UNLIKELY\nWest Ham are trying to add to the impressive transfer business they've completed in recent weeks, but technical director Tim Steidten may be returning from Brazil empty handed.\nYuri Alberto had been his main focus of attention, but Corinthians' demands, in addition to Zenit co-owning 50 per cent of his rights, have complicated matters to say the least. Flamengo's Pedro and Santos' Marcos Leonardo have also been mentioned in dispatches but moves look unlikely.\nThe Hammers are also trying to sign Filip Kostic from Juventus, a target from last summer, but an opening offer has been rejected by Juventus. They've also asked about young winger Samuel Iling-Junior.\n09:05 - MAN UTD COMPLETE FIRST SIGNING\nManchester United have their first deadline day signing in the bag and it's goalkeeper Altay Bayindir on a four-year contract.\nThe Red Devils allowed Dean Henderson to join Crystal Palace on Thursday and have moved swiftly to bring in an understudy to Andre Onana. Speaking to United's club channels after signing, Bayindir remarked: \"It is a huge honour to join Manchester United and become the first Turkish player to represent this incredible club.\n\"I have a passion for success, and I will give everything to help this special group of players to achieve our ambitions.\n08:40 - PREMIER LEAGUE DONE DEALS\nYou can remind yourself of every Premier League done deal this summer by clicking the link below.\n08:30 - WHO IS MOVING ON DEADLINE DAY?\nThere's expected to be some pretty big movers and shakers on deadline day, with Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United among the heavyweight teams looking to complete some late business.\nTottenham are also looking to get a couple of fresh faces in for Ange Postecoglou, hopefully to build on what's been a promising start to the new season. There could also be big waves made by Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga, following on from Harry Kane's move to Germany.\nPotential deals\n- Ryan Gravenberch - Bayern Munich to Liverpool - permanent\n- Sergio Reguilon - Tottenham to Manchester United - loan\n- Sofyan Amrabat - Fiorentina to Manchester United - loan\n- Cole Palmer - Manchester City to Chelsea - permanent\n- Brennan Johnson - Nottingham Forest to Tottenham - permanent\n- Joao Palhinha - Fulham to Bayern Munich - permanent\n- Ansu Fati - Barcelona to Brighton - loan\n- Matheus Nunes - Wolves to Manchester City - permanent\n- Clement Lenglet - Barcelona to Aston Villa - loan\n- Altay Bayindir - Fenerbahce to Manchester United - permanent\n08:15 - WHEN DOES THE TRANSFER WINDOW CLOSE?\nHaving opened on June 14, the summer transfer window for Premier League teams slams shut at 23:00 BST on September 1.\nThe window will close at the same time in the EFL, but there will be some variation around the major leagues in Europe. Serie A, La Liga, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 all shut on September 1, but the times are not the same for everyone which usually adds to the chaos and panic.\nTurkish and Portuguese clubs will be buying players up until September 15 and 22 respectively - opening up the possibility of sales without the ability to replace - but perhaps more importantly, the Saudi Pro League transfer window is open until September 20.\n08:10 - WELCOME TO DEADLINE DAY\nIt's the most wonderful time of the year again - that's right, it's transfer deadline day!",
