But it was not all plain sailing last season for Vinicius as he endured a disappointing Copa America with the Brazilian national team over the summer.\nHe scored two goals in a group-stage win against Paraguay, but his side ultimately crashed out on penalties to Uruguay in the quarter-finals.\nThe 26-year-old Spaniard Bonmati picked up the Best women's player award for the second year running, adding to the two Ballon d'Or trophies she already boasts.\n“I'm grateful, I'm proud to receive this award,” Bonmati said via video link from Barcelona's Olympic stadium.\nLast term, Bonmati led Barcelona to a historic continental quadruple of titles and claimed the Nations League with her national team.\nShe won every trophy available to her in club football in 2023/24 -- the Spanish league, the Copa de la Reina, the Supercopa de Espana and a second-successive Women's Champions League.\nBonmati scored a goal and put in a player-of-the-match performance as Barcelona beat Lyon 2-0 in the final of the Champions League to claim their third title in four seasons.\nManchester United's Argentine forward Alejandro Garnacho won the Puskas award for the best goal of the year for his spectacular bicycle kick against Everton in the Premier League.\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
