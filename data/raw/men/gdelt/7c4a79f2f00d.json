With the winter window now open for business, Ten Hag has the opportunity to strengthen his squad further in the wake of a promising start. Indeed, with 16 games played, United find themselves nestled nicely in the top four.\nAs such, the signs look promising for the Red Devils to bring Champions League football back to Old Trafford next season. And after a season which saw them labour home in sixth, would come as most welcome.\nHowever, there is clearly improvements for Ten Hag still to make. The derby thrashing at Manchester City illustrates that a gap in quality still exists. That said, United remain the only side to inflict defeat on table-toppers Arsenal this season. And there has also been quality performances in securing wins over Liverpool and Tottenham.\nThose results alone could prove significant come the end of the season.\nIn order to take United to the next level, however, the club will need to add another striker to the mix.\nCristiano Ronaldo’s departure to Al-Nassr is now official, though, incredibly, he could be back in the Premier League with Newcastle amid reports of an astonishing clause.\nFor Ten Hag, though, it is all about replacing Ronaldo in the side and bringing in a new central striker.\nTen Hag confirms plans as Man Utd learn huge fee for Muani\nAnd now the Dutchman has confirmed plans are in place to find a solution for United.\n“There will be many games to follow, so I think there is a need for a new striker,” he said. “We need one who can have an impact, otherwise you are just burning money and you don’t strengthen the squad.”\nMonday’s Euro Paper Talk revealed plans were afoot for the summer to swoop for a Borussia Dortmund striker.\nAnd in the meantime, there is talk too that Manchester United could look to the loan market for a short-term solution. To that end, both Joao Felix and Vincent Aboubakar are possible options.\nHowever, there are are also claims that United are considering a move for Eintracht Frankfurt hitman Muani.\nThe striker has been making a big name for himself in the Bundesliga, scoring eight times in 23 appearances. That form earned him a call-up for the France squad at the World Cup, with the player coming off the bench to net against Morocco in the semi-finals.\nNow there are claims United are preparing a £53m (€60m) offer for the 24-year-old.\nHowever, despite confirming their interest, Romano claims any deal for Muani will cost United a greater price. And he also expects any move from the club to come in the summer as opposed January.\n“Manchester United have been linked with a number of strikers, and the latest is Randal Kolo Muani,” Romano told Caught Offside.\n“Still, in January it is more than difficult for any club. There is no intention from Eintracht Frankfurt to sell the player, and his price tag is around £61.9m (€70m).”\nMan Utd planning their next moves\nRomano also revealed he is not the only striker United are pursuing, adding: “I think Kolo Muani alongside Jonathan David is one to watch for the summer.”\nAs such, it appears more likely than United will look to bring in a striker on a temporary basis this month. To that both end, both Felix and Aboubakar look presentable options.\nOf the two, Felix certainly appears the most intriguing. The Portuguese forward is desperate to leave Atletico Madrid after clashing with Diego Simeone over tactics.\nHe, however, comes with quite the price. And recent reports claim any package for Felix will cost a £18.6m loan fee package. That includes his loan fee of £13.3m (€15m) as well as coverage of his wages worth £5.3m (€6m) gross.\nUnited will have to either wait to see if that price comes down, or, if not, whether Felix is worth investing that sort of money on.",
