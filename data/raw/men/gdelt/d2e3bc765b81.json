We should have been better on a mental level. This elimination is down to me, not Theo or anyone else. I'm the one who's responsible - Theo has given a lot to Milan.\"\nSeven-time European champions Milan had the perfect start with Gimenez's effort.\nChristian Pulisic's cross to the back post was nodded back into the danger zone by Malick Thiaw for the Mexico international to head home from close range for his sixth goal of the competition - five of which came in Feyenoord colours before he left them in the winter transfer window.\nConceicao's side pushed for the aggregate lead as Tijjani Reijnders and Joao Felix went close before Hernandez's fierce strike cannoned off the upright in the 23rd minute.\nRafael Leao was denied by Timon Wellenreuther in the closing stages of the first half and the Feyenoord goalkeeper was also tested again early in the second half by Kyle Walker's low drive from the edge of the box.\nThe Dutch side, under interim manager Pascal Bosschaart, were then handed a boost when Frenchman Hernandez received a second booking for simulation six minutes after the restart.\nFeyenoord capitalised on the numerical advantage as Carranza met Hugo Bueno's cross to plant a thumping header past Milan captain Mike Maignan and send his side through to the last 16 of the premier European competition for the first time since 1974.\nHowever, they will be without Givairo Read for the last-16 tie as the right-back received a red card for violent conduct when tensions flared between the sides after the final whistle.\nMilan struggles continue with upset\nOnce a powerhouse of European football, Milan have now only made it to the last 16 of the Champions League once since the 2013-14 season.\nThat was under Stefano Pioli, who led them to the semi-finals in 2022-23 and also helped them lift their first Serie A title in 11 years in 2022.\nHowever, the Rossoneri have failed to hit those heights since Pioli left after a five-year spell at the end of last season, with former Porto boss Conceicao their second manager in this campaign after replacing Paulo Fonseca, who was sacked in December.\nConceicao took charge of the club with Milan eighth in the Serie A table and, although results have picked up recently, they are still in danger of missing out on European football next season.\nMilan are currently one point behind sixth-placed Fiorentina, who occupy the spot for the Conference League play-off round, and five adrift of fourth-placed Juventus and a place in next season's Champions League.\nDespite having lifted the Italian Super Cup by beating Inter Milan shortly after his appointment, this disappointing early exit from the Champions League will pile further pressure on Conceicao.\nLatest Stories\n-\nBooming Indicators, Dying Rivers: Ghana under Chronic Environmental Poisoning\n21 minutes -\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n49 minutes -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n1 hour -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n1 hour -\nNSA introduces dual authentication system for 2025/26 enrolment exercise\n3 hours -\nFuel prices to increase from Feb. 16, influenced by cedi’s depreciation\n3 hours -\nGNFS to launch automated fire safety compliance system to modernise regulation\n3 hours -\nNALAG president commends Local Gov’t Minister for payment of assembly members’ allowances\n3 hours -\nIs having a physical security operations center in your business worth it?\n3 hours -\nAsiedu Nketia recounts fierce political wars in Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam constituency\n3 hours -\nNRSA sets up committee to probe road crashes involving Toyota Voxy\n4 hours -\nCocoa farmers decry the adverse impact of producer price cut on livelihoods\n4 hours -\nFamilies who lose relatives to ‘no bed syndrome’ must sue health facilities – Dr. Nawaane\n4 hours -\nGhana Sports Fund: Dr. David Kofi Wuaku outlines vision for Youth Empowerment growth through sports\n4 hours -\nNUGS President urges sustainable digital governance\n4 hours",
