Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nMetro at the Match: Liverpool 1-2 Manchester United\nMetro at the Match returns to bring you all the analysis from the biggest games of the season.\nHere are our team’s key takeaways from United’s dramatic win at Anfield:\nPanic stations for Liverpool\nFour losses on the bounce and a first home defeat to United in almost a decade should have alarm bells ringing on Merseyside. The season is still young, but Arne Slot’s chaotic side currently look a shadow of the well-oiled machine that cantered to the title last season. Ben Fleming – Sports Reporter\nA turning point for Amorim’s tenure?\nIf beating newly-promoted Sunderland felt like a job-saver for Ruben Amorim, the dramatic win at Anfield felt like a defining and potentially transformational moment for the Old Trafford boss. A Liverpool winner felt inevitable once they finally broke United’s resistance but the visitors rallied superbly and snatched the three points themselves. Much of the talk will be about Liverpool’s fourth straight defeat but this was huge for Manchester United and perhaps the turning point in Amorim’s tenure. Louis Sealey, Deputy Sports Editor\nIs Van Dijk beginning to slip?\nMuch has been made of Mohamed Salah’s slow start to the season, but is Virgil van Dijk also starting to show signs of his age? The Dutchman allowed Bryan Mbeumo to ghost in behind with ease after only a minute, in what is his second costly mistake in as many club games. Ben Fleming – Sports Reporter\nLammens takes to Anfield like a duck to water\nSenne Lammens’ selection effectively confirmed his status as Ruben Amorim’s No. 1 after his solid debut against Sunderland. Wayne Rooney was among those questioning the £18m deal – especially as Gianluigi Donnarumma and Emiliano Martinez were available – but it’s looking like money well spent. Lammens denied £125m striker Alexander Isak in the first half and generally provides a more assuring presence in the United goal than either of Andre Onana or Altay Bayindir. Louis Sealey, Deputy Sports Editor\n‘It’s a great place for United to win a game of football. It’s a big period coming up, the manager is under pressure and they pulled something out of the bag and they have to make sure this is the start of something.’\nSpeaking before the game, both Keane and Redknapp expressed their ‘worry’ that England centre-back Maguire was picked ahead of the quicker Leny Yoro.\nBut Maguire produced a brilliant performance at Anfield, keeping Liverpool’s array of attacking talent quiet before popping up with a dramatic winner.\n‘We know Harry’s got the experience but the lack of pace might be an issue,’ Keane said. ‘That would be a worry but he’s played hundreds of games, he’s an established international player.\n‘It seems a bit strong but you would see him as a weak link but hopefully he has the experience to get through the game and not be too isolated. We know as well he can be a threat.’\nRedknapp added: ‘I’m surprised Harry Maguire is starting just in terms of Yoro’s pace. [Alexander] Isak would probably prefer to play against Harry than Yoro.’\nAddressing his earlier comments about Maguire after Manchester United’s win, Redknapp said: ‘The manager got every call right.\n‘I questioned whether Maguire was the right man to play but he showed his leadership skills. Cunha over Sesko was the right call as well.\n‘They also got it right tactically. They never played out from the back once. They got it spot on.\n‘Amorim has been battered by everyone but he will feel good after that, but a breakthrough moment? Only time will tell.\n‘Time will tell if Manchester United can kick on but this feels like a huge win for the manager.’\nThe result at Anfield leaves Amorim’s side ninth in the Premier League, two points behind fourth-placed Liverpool.\nMore Trending\n‘I wouldn’t go as far as to say United are back but it’s a huge win for them,’ ex-captain Keane added.\n‘We’ve all been critical of this group of players over the last year but on today’s performance, they showed grit. They stuck at it and you felt they had goals in them.\n‘It’s a big moment for these players and they should enjoy it. But now they have to kick on.’\nManchester United will look for a third successive Premier League weekend when Brighton visit Old Trafford, while Liverpool travel to Eintracht Frankfurt in midweek in the Champions League.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Jamie Carragher slams Mo Salah after another flop in Liverpool loss to Man Utd\nMORE: ‘Nervous wreck’ – Jamie Redknapp slams Liverpool star after Man Utd defeat\nMORE: Cristian Romero injury update after Tottenham captain misses Aston Villa defeat",
