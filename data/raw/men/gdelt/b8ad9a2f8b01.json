I can't wait to start training and to get to know my new teammates and all the staff,\" said Thiaw.\n\"The gaffer showed me his vision and what he wants to do with me as a player and the club itself, which is really exciting.\n\"I think Newcastle speaks for itself. It's a great club, a big club with passionate fans who I can't wait to see at St James' Park.\"\nBringing in a new centre-back was a priority for Newcastle this summer as manager Howe looks to increase competition and lower the average age of an experienced squad.\nBut getting deals over the line has been a tall order, with the Magpies missing out on several targets across all positions, including Benjamin Sesko, Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro and James Trafford.\nThere has also been speculation over the future of striker Alexander Isak, who is determined to leave the club and join Liverpool.\nHowe said: \"We're really pleased to have Malick on board. He's a player I've admired for a long time and somebody who will add real quality to our defensive options.\n\"Malick is still young but brings valuable experience of Champions League football, as well as playing in the Bundesliga and Serie A, which is a major positive for us as we return to Europe this season.\"\nThiaw, who has three caps for Germany, joined AC Milan from Schalke in 2022.\nHe made 31 appearances in all competitions for the Serie A giants last season, scoring his only goal of the campaign against Real Madrid in the Champions League in November.\nNewcastle open their Premier League campaign at Aston Villa on Saturday.\nLatest Stories\n-\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n13 minutes -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n39 minutes -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n41 minutes -\nNSA introduces dual authentication system for 2025/26 enrolment exercise\n2 hours -\nFuel prices to increase from Feb. 16, influenced by cedi’s depreciation\n2 hours -\nGNFS to launch automated fire safety compliance system to modernise regulation\n2 hours -\nNALAG president commends Local Gov’t Minister for payment of assembly members’ allowances\n3 hours -\nIs having a physical security operations center in your business worth it?\n3 hours -\nAsiedu Nketia recounts fierce political wars in Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam constituency\n3 hours -\nNRSA sets up committee to probe road crashes involving Toyota Voxy\n3 hours -\nCocoa farmers decry the adverse impact of producer price cut on livelihoods\n3 hours -\nFamilies who lose relatives to ‘no bed syndrome’ must sue health facilities – Dr. Nawaane\n3 hours -\nGhana Sports Fund: Dr. David Kofi Wuaku outlines vision for Youth Empowerment growth through sports\n3 hours -\nNUGS President urges sustainable digital governance\n3 hours -\nNational Investment Bank kicks off Ghana Sports Fund with landmark seed donation\n3 hours",
