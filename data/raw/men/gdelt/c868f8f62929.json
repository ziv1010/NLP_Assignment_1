to comprise great defenders.\nAnd the finest British defenders account for some of the finest players ever produced by the Home Nations, taking in World Cup and European Cup winners alike.\nHere, we’ve picked out the very best of them…\nAndy Robertson (Scotland)\nScotland’s captain as they returned to major tournament football at Euro 2024, Andy Robertson rose from the lower leagues to establish himself as one of the best left-backs on the planet.\nAn exceptionally athletic operator with devastating crossing ability, Robertson won it all with Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp – including the 2018/19 Champions League and 2019/20 Premier League title.\nBilly McNeill (Scotland)\nA bona fide Celtic icon who dedicated more than 60 years of his life to the club, Billy McNeill captained the legendary Lisbon Lions team to victory over Inter in the 1967 European Cup final.\nCapped 29 times by his country, for whom he also wore the armband, McNeill was a born leader and a fine centre-half.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nNorman Hunter (England)\nAmong the best central defenders around in his prime, Norman Hunter won the 1974 PFA Players’ Player of the Year award after starring in a second top-flight triumph at Leeds.\nA veteran of more than 700 appearances for the Whites – with whom he also lifted the FA Cup and reached the European Cup final – Hunter earned 28 England Caps and was part of the victorious 1966 World Cup squad.\nJack Charlton (England)\nOne of the game’s great characters, Jack Charlton was an immense presence in the heart of defence for Leeds – where he spent his entire career – and England alike.\nA 1966 World Cup winner alongside brother Bobby, the 1967 FWA Footballer of the Year scored over 100 goals for club and country – belying his profile of typical old-school centre-half.\nSol Campbell\nBefore and after his wrath-provoking move across North London from Tottenham to Arsenal, Sol Campbell stood out among the finest centre-backs of his era.\nA two-time Premier League champion with the Gunners, including as an Invincible in 2004, Campbell was an England regular for the best part of a decade and featured at all six major tournaments between Euro 96 and the 2006 World Cup.\nTony Adams (England)\nTony Adams’ outstanding defensive qualities were clear from a young age, and he took over the Arsenal captain’s armband at just 21 in 1988.\nBetween then and his retirement 14 years later, Adams – who captained England at Euro 96 – led his only club to four top-flight titles and three FA Cups, among other honours, impressively adapting his game from traditional centre-half to an adept ball-player following the arrival of Arsene Wenger as manager.\nRay Wilson (England)\nEngland’s left-back en route to 1966 World Cup glory, Ray Wilson represented his country with distinction on 63 occasions.\nAn FA Cup winner with Everton that same year, the former Huddersfield Town youngster boasted exceptional strength, pace and positional awareness. “It was a comfort to play alongside him,” said England skipper Bobby Moore.\nKyle Walker (England)\nStill terrifyingly fast well into his 30s, Kyle Walker combined his physical and technical qualities to become one of the world’s best right-backs of the 2010s and early 2020s.\nIntegral to Manchester City’s sustained success under Pep Guardiola, Walker proved his fantastic versatility by operating at both right-back and right-sided centre-back for Gareth Southgate’s England, who he helped to successive Euros finals.\nGeorge Cohen (England)\nAnother pioneering English full-back who starred in the Three Lions’ 1966 World Cup triumph, George Cohen brought hugely threatening attacking intent to the right of Alf Ramsey’s back four.\nA one-club man at Fulham, Cohen whipped in the cross for Bobby Charlton to score what proved to be England’s semi-final winner against Portugal – and he was described by his namesake, George Best, as “the best full-back I ever played against”.\nJohn Terry (England)\nA standout defender of the 21st century, John Terry’s commanding presence in the middle of Chelsea’s backline spurred the Blues on to a plethora of silverware.\nNo-nonsense but tactically intelligent and a superb reader of the game, Terry captained both Chelsea and England – by whom he was capped 78 times – and regularly proved his goalscoring prowess from set-pieces, netting 41 times in the Premier League alone.\nAlan Hansen (Scotland)\nWhen a distinctly unimpressed Alan Hansen lamented “diabolical” defending on Match of the Day, he knew better than most what he was talking about.\nThe technically assured Liverpool and Scotland legend was right up there among the finest centre-halves of the 80s, helping the Reds to numerous major honours – including multiple European Cups and First Division titles – and featuring at the 1982 World Cup.\nAshley Cole (England)\nThe greatest-ever British left-back – and of the best from anywhere, for that matter – Ashley Cole played an integral part in multiple major triumphs at Arsenal and Chelsea during the 2000s and 2010s.\nOne of England’s most-capped players, with 107 appearances to his name, Cole based his game on that of Roberto Carlos and possessed elite ability in the defensive and offensive aspects of his role.\nRio Ferdinand (England)\nAt a time when most English centre-backs were still relatively old-school, Rio Ferdinand marked himself out as one of the very best around with a cultured, more continental style of play.\nThe most expensive defender in the world on two occasions, Ferdinand won multiple Premier League titles and the Champions League with Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United and represented England at two World Cups.\nJohn Charles (Wales)\nFamously as good a centre-back as he was a centre-forward – and not just good; he was world-class – John Charles might just be the finest Welsh footballer of all time.\nThe Gentle Giant enjoyed legendary spells with Leeds and Juventus – where he starred in three Serie A title-winning seasons – in addition to inspiring Wales to the quarter-finals of the 1958 World Cup.\nBilly Wright (England)\nBilly Wright was the first player in the world to win 100 international caps, racking up 105 in all – and he captained England in 90 of those games, a Three Lions record.\nA centre-half of extraordinary class who also wore the armband for Wolves – his sole club, who he led to three First Division titles and an FA Cup between 1949 and 1959 – Wright finished as runner-up for the 1957 Ballon d’Or, behind only Alfredo Di Stefano.\nBobby Moore (England)\nIconic captain of England’s 1966 World Cup winners, Bobby Moore was such an imperious centre-half that Pele called him the toughest defender he ever faced.\nAn impeccable reader of the game who did everything with the utmost composure, Moore earned 108 Three Lions caps and spent the vast majority of his club career with his boyhood club West Ham – where he ensured immortality as skipper of their 1964 FA Cup- and 1965 Cup Winners’ Cup-winning sides.\nTom Hancock started freelancing for FourFourTwo in April 2019 and has also written for the Premier League and Opta Analyst, among others. He supports Wycombe Wanderers and has a soft spot for Wealdstone. A self-confessed statto, he has been known to watch football with a spreadsheet (or several) open...",
