It said that it was “committed to cooperating with CAF to finalize its investigation ahead of the return leg”.”\nIt continued: “Espérance de Tunis is a respected sports institution in Africa, and we trust that once all the evidence is reviewed, our brothers and sisters at Espérance will also denounce this behaviour and take the necessary steps to ensure that the next encounter is one where all supporters feel safe and welcome.”\nThe club also issued a formal apology to the Northern African club “in accordance with our African culture of compassion and empathy (our African culture of Ubuntu).”\nWILL ESPERANCE APOLOGISE?\nWhile Mamelodi Sundowns has issued a formal apology, Esperance has remained notably silent.\nThat hasn’t stopped South Africans from admonishing them on their X account.\n@Muhali_Rrr: “Learn to put your fans in order or don’t bring them over again…they terrorised our infrastructures.”\n@za_lady1: “We welcomed you to our country with warm hands. There has never been a time when our South African teams mistreated you. But because of your loss, you exposed your hooliganism. You cannot rip off our club’s banners like that. That was utter disrespect.”\n@sgubhu_mgodi: “Your players, along with your fans, are a disgrace in our African football. Very disgusting“.\nMeanwhile, Mamelodi Sundowns and Esperance will face each other again on Tuesday, 8 April, at Tunisia’s Hammadi Agrebi Stadium.\nDO YOU THINK THAT ESPERANCE SHOULD APOLOGISE TO SUNDOWNS?\nLet us know by leaving a comment below, or send a WhatsApp to 060 011 021 1.\nSubscribe to The South African website’s newsletters and follow us on WhatsApp, Facebook, X, and Bluesky for the latest news.",
