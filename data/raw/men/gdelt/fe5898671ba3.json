I just think they were more up for it than us, which is really disappointing to say.\n“It’s probably a bad result against the best-performing team in Europe so it’s no disgrace to come here and lose, but we are disappointed in how we performed.\n“We need to use it in the right way, we’ve got three games left and it’s important we win those.”\nTake a bow, Alexis Mac Allister! 👏\nAnfield erupts with noise as Liverpool take the lead 🔊\n📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/fQSTG1Gl56\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) November 27, 2024\nBBC Sport pundit Chris Sutton, meanwhile, believes that Liverpool have the upper hand over both Arsenal and Manchester City in the Premier League title race at the moment due to one determining factor – having watched them see off Real Madrid.\nHe said: “What Liverpool have that Man City and Arsenal don’t is a greater strength in depth in their squad.\n“You look at the goalkeeping position, Caoimhin Kelleher has always been outstanding, he’s got a brilliant temperament.\n“In many respects it was not a great surprise to see him save a penalty. Kylian Mbappe is normally lethal but had his boots on the wrong feet tonight.\n“You look at the right back position, Conor Bradley looked to have done his hamstring tonight but they have Trent Alexander-Arnold to come back in for Man City at the weekend.”\nLatest Liverpool news: Massive Van Dijk update / twist in Salah saga\nVirgil van Dijk will sign a contract extension with Liverpool, a report has claimed, after the Dutchman’s agent telegraphed an agreement between the player and club.\nLike Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah, Van Dijk is in the final year of his contract. All three Reds superstars would be free to forge a pre-contract agreement with overseas sides come January 1 if new deals aren’t ironed out.\nBut according to a fresh update from Anfield Watch, Van Dijk will be the first of the trio to extend his stay by signing an extension.\nMeanwhile, the agents for Mo Salah have ‘offered the player to Real Madrid’ and have been ‘presented with an opportunity to sign him’ per strong reports in Spain, while a leading pundit has questioned Liverpool over the Egyptian’s contract saga.",
