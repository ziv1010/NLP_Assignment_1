The report states that Sobhi and a second defendant were sentenced to 12 months in prison with hard labour by a judge at the Giza Criminal Court.\nSobhi's lawyer wasn't available for comment in the immediate aftermath of the verdict but could launch an appeal, StokeonTrentLive reports.\nSobhi's debut in the Premier League came in August 2016 when he came off the bench for the final two minutes of Stoke City 4-1 defeat against Manchester City. He replaced Marko Arnautovic on that day.\nHe was a squad player during his time at the bet365 Stadium but started six consecutive league matches between February and April 2017, contributing an assist against Crystal Palace in the opening game of that run.\nThe attacker then found the back of the net in back-to-back league matches against West Brom and Huddersfield in December 2017.\nSobhi has represented Egypt 37 times and played in all three of their group matches at the 2018 World Cup. He also featured for his country at the 2020 Olympic Games.\nThe player's most recent appearance for Egypt came at the Africa Cup of Nations in 2022, when he came on as a substitute during their semi-final victory over Cameroon.\nHe helped Pyramids win the CAF Champions League last season but is currently facing a four-year suspension from football after the Court of Arbitration for Sport confirmed violations of anti-doping rules in November.",
