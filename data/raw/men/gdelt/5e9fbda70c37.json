It's about putting first other things in my life and I'm ready for that.\"\nBefore then, Hayes' focus is on burnishing her legacy in west London.\nA haul of six league titles, five FA Cups and two League Cups will most likely be added to between now and her exit in May.\nBut the hurdle of becoming just the second English side to ever win the women's Champions League, and the first since Arsenal's success in 2007, has so far proved too high for Chelsea to clear.\nTwice in the past three seasons it has been an all-conquering Barcelona that have stood in the way.\nIn the 2021 final the Catalans cruised to a 4-0 win, but last season's semi-final between the pair was a far closer encounter as Barca advanced 2-1 on aggregate before lifting the trophy for a second time.\nChelsea will hope their European season begins and ends in Spain, with Bilbao playing host to the final on May 25.\nA tough group also includes Paris FC, who dumped out two of last season's semi-finalists Arsenal and Wolfsburg in the qualifiers, and Swedish side BK Hacken.\nBut anything less than progress to the latter stages will be a huge disappointment for Chelsea and a damp squib to end Hayes' reign of glory.\n\"I've taken this team to the top and I always said I wanted to leave at the top, and I maintain that,\" she said.\n\"I think I've dedicated as much as I possibly can to this football club. I've loved every minute of it.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
