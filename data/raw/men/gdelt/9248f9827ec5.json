That’s teamwork, all right!\n“Those who say Big Dan Burn adds nothing to our attacking play should watch this game.\n“Eddie knows.\n“But does he know his preferred midfield starters?\n“Anderson and Longstaff have thrown down the gauntlet.”\nMatt Busby Said To Joe Harvey:\n“Where to start?\n“Well, despite scoring eight, for me a third consecutive clean sheet isn’t a bad place.\n“The fact that we had eight different scorers tells it’s own story. A premier league record apparently. Absolutely fantastic.\n“Funny though, MOTM Anthony Gordon didn’t even start and had Harvey Barnes not left the field with an injury after only 12 minutes, who knows how it could have played out?\n“Up to that point, Sheff Utd looked okay but imploded once Anthony had kept the ball in play at the by-line to set up Sean Longstaff. Even at 1-0, it then never looked in doubt.\n“I thought Bruno was back to something that resembled his best, with a goal and an assist and with Longstaff and Anderson on song, the midfield dominated.\n“It was great to see Botman get a goal.\n“I counted three assists from Trip and some of our finishing was sublime.\n“Eddie using the squad to great effect was also welcome, with Tino and Lewis both getting some game time.”\nTony Mallabar:\n“Am absolutely delighted.\n“But apart from Bruno being back on song, is it time we had the debate where clubs from Sheffield, Bristol, Nottingham and even Edinburgh thought about amalgamation.\n“Ok, to put this in context us and the dark side would never consider this.\n“But to keep off a happy clappers European super league. Maybe it’s time for this discussion.\n“Sheffield is the 4th largest city in England.\n“Yet we made a competent Premier league team… Look quite mackemism.”\nJack Lacey-Hatton:\n“Incredible performance.\n“8 different goalscorers in any game against any opposition is a remarkable return.\n“I actually thought at 0-0 they looked good, but their collapse after conceding the opener was pathetic.\n“Enjoyed every one of those goals, even more so after the bottle thrown at Anderson and the awful tackle on Longstaff.\n“A majestic afternoon.”\nBrian Standen:\n“Win together, draw together, lose together and take the pi.. together.\n“This is a squad that is at one with each other.\n“It was only a matter of time before we clicked……. Bring on Man City!\n“Only downer being the injury to Harvey Barnes….. but oh Anthony Gordon.”\nPaul Patterson:\n“Had our cake . . and Eight it..”\nDavid Punton:\n“Perfection as United smash a club record away win at Brammall Lane.\n“That was 8-0 on the road. Wow. Eight!\n“A demolition job on the hapless Blades, who had one of them days where it just got worse and worse for them.\n“I almost felt sorry for them!\n“That was 8 different scorers but Anthony Gordon really stood out today after emerging from the bench.\n“Before the game became a training exercise the hard hard yards also went to unlikely scorers – the air force – Dan Burn and Sven Botman.\n“Both on the end of delicious set piece deliveries from Trippier to power home goals. Botman with his first for the club.\n“This is the perfection Howe strives for. Everyone gets top marks.\n“A huge moment in our season. It has that feel.\n“What an amazing day for the club, capping off a brilliant week.”\nStats from BBC Sport:\nSheffield United 0 Newcastle United 8 – Sunday 24 September 4.30pm\nGoals:\nNewcastle United:\nLongstaff 21, Burn 31, Botman 35, Wilson 56, Gordon 61, Almiron 68, Bruno73, Isak 87\nSheffield United:\n(Half-time stats in brackets)\nPossession was Sheff Utd 42% (46%) Newcastle 58% (54%)\nTotal shots were Sheff Utd 9 (6) Newcastle 22 (12)\nShots on target were Sheff Utd 1 (1) Newcastle 15 (8)\nCorners were Sheff Utd 2 (2) Newcastle 6 (4)\nReferee: Stuart Attwell\nNewcastle United:\nPope, Trippier (Livarmento 70), Schar, Botman, Burn, Longstaff, Bruno (Hall 81), Anderson, Almiron (Tonali 70), Wilson (Isak 70), Barnes (Gordon 12)\nUNUSED SUBS:\nDubravka, Lascelles, Targett, Murphy\n(Sheffield United 0 Newcastle United 8 (EIGHT!) – Record breakers – Read HERE)\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
