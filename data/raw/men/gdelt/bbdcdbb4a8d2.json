Assisted both of Madueke’s goals, with the second coming via a lovely cross.”\nReal Madrid make Xabi Alonso sack decision\nWhile Madrid will be bitterly disappointed with the defeat to Man City and will regret not getting a deal done for Zubimendi, for now, Alonso is still in the job.\nThe Spanish media reported after Madrid’s defeat to Celta de Vigo last weekend that Alonso was going to get the sack should Man City win at the Santiago Bernabeu.\nHowever, Madrid stepped up their game against the Premier League club and produced a very encouraging performance.\nEven though Madrid lost, the players showed that they are still playing for Alonso, with Rodrygo hugging the manager after scoring his goal, although “the crisis is not over yet”.\nThe Athletic journalist Mario Cortegana wrote on X at 8:41am on December 11: “Late on Wednesday night, multiple club sources said that Xabi Alonso’s job was not under immediate threat. As defeats go, it was good news, but the crisis is not over yet.”\nLatest Real Madrid transfer news: Rodrygo verdict, Tottenham roadblock\nMeanwhile, the Real Madrid media, Steven Gerrard and Pep Guardiola have given their verdict on Rodrygo following his performance against Manchester City at the Santiago Bernabeu in the Champions League on Wednesday.\nReal Madrid’s pursuit of a Tottenham Hotspur star could end in disappointment, with sources telling TEAMtalk the problem that Los Blancos are facing.\nAnd finally, the reason why Real Madrid decided to end their interest in Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate has been revealed.",
