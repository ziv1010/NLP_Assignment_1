The decision will never be made before Lionel finished the league with PSG,\" Jorge posted on social media.\nAl-Hilal Transfer Ban Expires in Summer\nAl-Hilal, a Saudi Arabia football club banned from signing new players due to a transfer violation, is set to make a splash in summer, Fan Nation noted.\nThe ban stemmed from the club's decision to renew the contract of Mohamed Kanno last year, despite an existing agreement that called for him to join rival club Al Nassr.\nHad the ban not been in place, it is rumored that Al-Hilal would have been able to lure Cristiano Ronaldo away from Al Nassr earlier this year.\nDespite Ronaldo's impressive 12-goal performance in 13 league games, Al Nassr is currently trailing five points behind league leaders Al-Ittihad with just four games left to play.\nMeanwhile, Al-Hilal languishes in fourth place, looking to make a strong finish in the season's final stretch.\nIn a recent development, Argentine football star Lionel Messi traveled to Saudi Arabia as part of his ambassadorship with the Saudi Arabian tourist board, earning a reported $30 million annually.\nHowever, his absence from pre-trip training without permission led to a two-week suspension without pay from his current club, Paris Saint-Germain.\nAfter issuing a public apology, Messi was reinstated to training on Monday and will be available to play in PSG's remaining four games this season, starting with a match against Ajaccio on Saturday.\nREAD MORE: James Harden Invites John Hao\nThis article is owned by Latin Post.\nWritten by: Bert Hoover\nWATCH: Lionel Messi going to Saudi Arabia would be a pre-retirement - Frank Leboeuf - From ESPN FC\nSubscribe to Latin Post!\nSign up for our free newsletter for the Latest coverage!\n© 2026 Latin Post.
