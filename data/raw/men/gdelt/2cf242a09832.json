  "body_text": "It is so often the way with goalkeepers — 90 minutes of relative inactivity, one big moment, then a whole lot of judgement.\nFor Matt Turner, that’s what came deep into added time at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on Thursday, when Panama took their only shot on target all game — from the right side of the penalty area, drilled to the bottom left corner; Turner, who had taken position to the right of his goal, could not get his gloves to it.\nAdvertisement\n“That ball can’t end up in the back of the net,” lamented former USMNT goalkeeper-turned-pundit Tony Meola.\nThen, not long after the end of the home side’s 1-0 loss in that Concacaf Nations League semi-final, criticism of the goalkeeper appeared on social media, alongside stills of the goal questioning his movement.\nThat the USMNT won’t now win a fourth consecutive Nations League final is not solely down to Turner. Thursday’s defeat was a collective failure.\nAnd although Panama, who also beat the United States 2-1 in a pivotal Copa America group-stage meeting last summer to set up the host nation’s early exit from that tournament, have now become their bogey team, there will be tougher tests on the horizon for Mauricio Pochettino’s side as they build towards the 2026 World Cup, also largely to be played on American soil.\nThat is where Turner’s status as second-choice for his club — he has made only four starts this season for Crystal Palace, all in the domestic cup competitions rather than the Premier League — but the USMNT’s No 1 for their biggest games will come under further scrutiny.\nIt’s something he got asked about by reporters in the build-up to Thursday’s match.\n“Obviously, my club situation isn’t ideal right now,” said the 30-year-old, who is on a season-long loan at Palace from rival Premier League club Nottingham Forest. “But I’m giving every opportunity that I have to play the utmost importance and trying to put good performances together, just control what I can right now and then let the chips fall where they may.”\nNot ideal then, but neither is it unprecedented.\nSergio Romero was Argentina’s first-choice goalkeeper as they got to the final of the 2014 World Cup despite being second-string at Monaco of Ligue 1, the top division of French club football, and continued in his starting role for the national team despite going on to be the backup to David de Gea at Manchester United. Romero later described it as a “difficult situation”.\nAdvertisement\nFormer Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey also had spells as No 1 for Wales, despite hardly playing in the Premier League at the back-end of his time at Selhurst Park. Hennessey was then second-choice for Burnley and Forest while still getting games for his country, including at the 2022 World Cup.\nFor the USMNT it is not a new situation, either.\nOne of Turner’s current understudies, Zack Steffen of MLS side Colorado Rapids, played in the 2021 Nations League finals win against Mexico and in qualifiers for the following year’s World Cup while spending most of his two complete seasons at Manchester City of the Premier League on the bench.\n“It’s come full circle,” says Matt Pyzdrowski, a coach and former goalkeeper who played professionally in the U.S. and Sweden, and is now The Athletic’s goalkeeping analyst. “Matt was playing regularly in MLS (for New England Revolution, before a July 2022 move to Europe with Arsenal) and trying to get ahead of Zack, who wasn’t playing as much as he’d like in England. Now they have kind of switched places.”\nFor large parts of Thursday’s game, Turner was less busy than he had been when playing 45 minutes of Palace’s 1-0 win over Norwegian side Hamarkameratene in a friendly last week.\nIn that practice game, part of Palace’s warm-weather training camp in Marbella, Spain during a break in their domestic schedule, he made two saves in the second half after replacing first-choice Dean Henderson at the interval. He touched the ball 17 times, only seven fewer times than in the 99 minutes, including added time, against Panama (24).\nThe questions come from the one decisive moment that did not go his way, meaning the U.S. will not play in Sunday’s final. But despite that setback, Turner has generally played well enough for the national team to retain his place in it, keeping high-profile errors at a bare minimum.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s obviously a problem but, at the moment, I don’t think it’s a big problem because Matt has always performed for the USMNT,” says Pyzdrowski. “That’s the biggest thing you need to consider. If he was making lots of errors and not performing, then of course it would be a more pressing issue. But he has always done pretty well for his country despite not playing regularly at all for his club.”\nIt remains to be seen whether Turner stays in the team for Sunday’s third-place play-off against Canada.\nPatrick Schulte of Columbus Crew was in goal the last time the countries met, a 2-1 win for the Canadians last September in a friendly while the USMNT had Mikey Varas in interim charge. Had it been an important fixture, it is likely Turner would have been in the team that day in Kansas City and not on the bench. That means his performances for the national team are generally buoyed by the feeling of being trusted as a regular, according to Pyzdrowski.\n“It doesn’t matter who you are as a player, you just want to feel valued,” he says. “Then you feel more comfortable on the field and it’s important not to overlook it. Matt has built up a lot of credit with the national team.\n“In a perfect world, he’d be playing every week, regardless of what that requires — if it’s going back to MLS — because he’d naturally be sharper. But at the moment it hasn’t caused him too many issues.”\nTurner has largely been Palace’s cup goalkeeper this season, starting one of the three Carabao Cup matches they played following his late-August arrival and, more significantly, all three FA Cup ties to date. He will hope to retain his place in the quarter-finals on March 29 against USMNT team-mate Antonee Robinson’s Fulham.\nThe only potential downside to his inactivity in the Premier League, Henderson has been an ever-present for Palace to date and Turner’s last appearance in the competition was for Forest in January last year, is a potential lack of time facing key high-level-game scenarios.\nAdvertisement\n“The biggest issue of not playing regularly is just rustiness,” says Pyzdrowski. “And the relationship with your back line and reading of the play — how deep the balls come, or crosses into the box.\n“I wouldn’t say that saving the ball and the speed of the ball is that much of a problem, because you get a lot of that in training. You get a ton of reps (in training) even when you’re on the bench. It’s more situations that can only arise in games.”\nThose daily sessions between games are also different as a club’s backup ’keeper, though. “In training, the focus is really on the No 1, so the drills you do are suited to them,” says Pyzdrowski. “A lot of the situations Matt will be in during training won’t be with the guys who play every week (other reserves), so he’s not building those relationships.\n“But then that’s the important thing with the national team: that he’s familiar with the setup and the guys there. He built that up over time and really earned his spot.”\nVeteran goalkeeper Andy Lonergan had spells as a backup, and even third-choice, towards the end of his career with top clubs such as Liverpool and Everton. He feels Turner’s extra physical freshness, in contrast to a ’keeper going through the grind of playing every weekend in the Premier League, should actually be a positive.\n“He’s fresh for these games, raring to go and experienced,” says the 41-year-old, now a player/coach at Wigan Athletic in League One, the third tier of English football. “I know Dean Kiely, who works with him at Palace and speaks very highly of him and says how good he is in training.\n“He’s got hundreds of games behind him and has been at big teams now, so I don’t think he’ll be too concerned about the situation. He has no niggles, no injuries, and he comes to these USMNT camps champing at the bit. When you’re second-choice (at a club) but have something to work towards, like the cup games and then the international games, you have a good focus.\nAdvertisement\n“Ideally you want to play all the time and keep that rhythm because it isn’t easy coming in every six weeks in the cup, and his last international camp was in November. But from his point of view, I don’t think it’ll be an issue.”\nPyzdrowski points out that, in theory at least, playing a Panama team ranked 36th in the world by FIFA (20 places below the United States) can be less taxing on a goalkeeper’s reflexes than a game in the English top flight. “International football is a little different from the Premier League,” he says. “A game against Panama will be different and have perhaps less intensity than a Premier League game, so that will also help him feel his way into it.”\nLike Pyzdrowski, Lonergan’s only concern would be whether players in Turner’s situation can stay sharp for in-game situations.\n“Speaking from experience, the only fear when I wasn’t playing (regularly) but was a cup ’keeper with a game in six weeks’ time is that, in training, you’re doing small-side games so your reactions are bang-on,” he says. “But it’s your distances with the back four, balls over the top and through balls where you could be a little bit out of sync.\n“That was always my concern, because training and 11-a-side on full pitches are different. In training, you’re on autopilot, flying around, but in games those decisions are vital.\n“Through balls, distances and balls over the top are the hardest to practice as a ’keeper. You can do it in training but there are no consequences, whereas in a match if you decide to come (for a ball) and don’t get there, you’re in trouble. In training, you can keep doing it until you get it right.”\nWith the World Cup 15 months away, it could be that Turner — who made only seven appearances in his year with Arsenal before joining Forest, where he made 17 league starts last season — looks for a new team where he is more likely to be first choice. His loan at Palace expires in June and he has another two years to go on his contract with Forest, where Belgium international Matz Sels has established himself as a key player in goal as they make a surprise push for Champions League qualification.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s not an unworkable situation as it is,” adds Pyzdrowski, who recently started a new role coaching the goalkeepers at Swedish top-flight side Malmo. “But the challenge it creates is because the goalkeeping position is so delicate, with so many small details. You really can only work on a lot of them in games.\n“Goalkeeper training has evolved a lot in the last 10 years, in terms of the different repetitions and exercises you do compared to just lots of shots and volleys.\n“Now it’s more match relevant, but even if you have one or two goalkeeper coaches and they’re taking shots at you, it’s not the same as a top-class striker coming at you, with the speed and accuracy. Yes, you’ll do some exercises with the team, but training just isn’t built around the number two or number three.\n“You’re important and you have a role, but the coach needs guys on the team (the starters) working together to build those relationships.”\nWith the national team, those bonds seem as strong as ever. But to face the game’s very best at a World Cup just over a year away, Turner may decide he needs to increase his weekly workload.\n(Top photo: Omar Vega/Getty Images)",
