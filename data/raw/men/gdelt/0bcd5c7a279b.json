  "body_text": "Welcome to The Daily Merengue — a place where you can feel free to discuss all things football. Do not be alarmed by the overt RMCF bias. It’s in the name!\nOPEN THREAD — Nothing Positive: 01 Feb. 2026\nAnother Juninho Edition of the Daily Merengue\nShoutout to the Mods who do a fantastic job, Valyrian Steel, Ezek XI, KungFuZizou, NeRObutBlanco, Felipejack, and Juninho.\nA Collection of Memos\nWriter’s Prelude. Today’s memo will shine light on others and be abbreviated due to time constraints\nTo: MM\nNothing Positive. I have nothing positive to say. I have nothing encouraging to say as we cheer our team against Rayo. I have quite frankly far too much to say about Arbeloa’s latest press conference, the board, and many of the players but I have this nagging feeling that today is not the day for that DT. Today isn’t the day for me to berate a manager who quite frankly was put into an untenable position. Today I don’t have the energy to explain who are the true madridstas and who simply root for this badge because they’re employees. Today isn’t that day.\nSo I guess as I try to pick myself up and yet again march towards another match day — one that will likely feature an environment as hostile as most Spanish away games —I’ll offer you a message that may or may not grant you some semblance of solace:\n“90 minutes in the Bernabéu is a long time”\nYea — it feels like today’s match will be a long time for everyone. Let’s hope its the turning point one way or another.\nCheers,\nJ\nSome Extra Tidbits.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n“buy the dip. short VIX. f*ck bitcoin. And Hala Madrid.“",
