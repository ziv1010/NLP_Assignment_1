  "body_text": "Of the two high-profile additions at BMO Stadium last summer, Giorgio Chiellini is the one who remains. Gareth Bale, the scorer of LAFC’s extra-time equalizer in MLS Cup, has traded Los Angeles’ soccer scene for its golf courses while Chiellini prepares for his first full season in the States.\nAfter a career in Italian football spanning three decades, over 500 league appearances, 117 national team caps, nine Scudetti and a European Championship, the 38-year-old might be tempted to take his foot off the gas. However, Chiellini is as determined as ever to ensure last year’s MLS Cup victory, LAFC’s first, will not be his last.\nAdvertisement\n“I have the hunger still because I am enjoying my life every day,” Chiellini told The Athletic. “This opportunity has provided me with a new life and a different experience for my family. For that, and because I am a professional, I will come here and give 100 percent every day. I like to be a big brother to my teammates; it’s important to me. I want to leave them something (from my time here). The first thing I said to my teammates is that I want to be remembered as a good person and a big brother more than a player. Though it’s impossible for me to play 100 percent of the games, I want to be a good player, but my biggest mission is to have good relationships and help my teammates.”\nChiellini was parachuted into an already strong side midway through last season with little expectation on the specifics of his role on the pitch. As it transpired, he was a primary figure, featuring in 11 of LAFC’s final 16 games of the season, as well as the 3-0 Western Conference final win over Austin FC, as Steve Cherundolo’s side won both MLS Cup and the Supporters’ Shield.\nUnlike in Italy, where he served as Juventus’ vice-captain through the Turin side’s domination of the last decade, winning nine consecutive Serie A titles, no team has successfully defended an MLS Cup since LAFC’s crosstown rivals, the LA Galaxy, did so in 2012. But while there is no guarantee reigning champions will carry their dominance into the following year, LAFC are expected to be a force again despite significant roster changes.\nCherundolo’s side had a busy off-season, particularly in midfield and attack. LAFC has retained their starting trio in the engine room, with Ilie Sanchez, Kellyn Acosta and Jose Cifuentes rated among the best triumvirates in MLS. Ecuador international Sebastian Mendez departed for Sao Paulo, and Latif Blessing, a regular starter before 2022, was traded to the New England Revolution. Their replacements, Timothy Tillman — brother of U.S. international Malik — and Daniel Cristosomo, add much-needed squad depth.\nAdvertisement\nIn attack, Gabon international Dennis Bouanga will be relied upon to replace the goals of Bale and Chicho Arango, who left MLS for Liga MX club Pachuca.\n“We’ve changed a lot. The middle of the team has gone, and we’ve only got 10 or 12 players from last year,” Chiellini said. “But, we have the base, and it’s a solid base. The players who’ve arrived are all good guys, and I’m sure they’ll help us a lot. It’s not easy for us because now everyone expects success, and everyone wants to beat us, and that’s normal because we’re the champions.”\nChiellini experienced Juventus rebuild title-winning teams repeatedly in Italy, and for him, the essential ingredient to success is desire.\n“We must maintain the hunger; I know that from my time in Italy. We still have many trophies to win and many goals to achieve. The environment here is beautiful. Everybody is kind and trying to work hard, and we need to continue with this vibe. For sure, we’ll have problems, but if we continue to fight, we will overcome.”\n➡️ @chiellini dropping dimes\n🚀 @Mahala_jnr finishing the job#LAFC pic.twitter.com/3rkyNl0dhs— LAFC (@LAFC) February 19, 2023\nThe hunger for team success and to prove to the world that he is still an elite center back drove him to leave Italy for Los Angeles at the beginning of January, while most of his LA teammates were still on vacation. Given his experience in Europe, where the summer offseason period typically lasts around a month and a half, the extended two-month break between lifting MLS Cup and officially reporting back for preseason training meant he was champing at the bit to return.\n“I stayed in Los Angeles throughout November for my daughter’s school, but I spent December back home in Italy. I was eager to get back (to LA), though, because two months away from the team is too much,” Chiellini said. “It’s difficult to maintain my physical condition at this age, but it’s even harder alone. I need other players around me, and for the first two weeks of January, it was difficult.”\nAdvertisement\nThe period was more challenging as the rest of the world was celebrating the World Cup, a tournament he failed to reach following Italy’s shocking defeat to North Macedonia in a win-or-go-home World Cup qualifier last March. For Chiellini, who led Italy to a European Championship win against England in 2021, the pain of missing what would have been his final major tournament in an Italy shirt was still too fresh.\n“The World Cup was weird, to be honest,” he said. “I didn’t watch very much — it wasn’t nice. I caught up on some of the highlights but almost never the live matches, outside of the final and the USMNT’s first game against Wales, because I was still here for that. It was tough not to be there for it because going to the World Cup is a big goal. It would have been a great experience, but I try to change the bad things and look at them more positively. Failing at World Cup qualification meant I decided to come to Los Angeles for a new challenge, and it has been an unforgettable experience for me.”\nNot only did he arrive in Los Angeles with footballing success on his mind, but for he and his family to undergo a cultural enrichment in a city that people from 140 countries, speaking 224 languages, call home. Like many Europeans, Chiellini found the initial adjustment from walkable communities to the car-centric life in Los Angeles challenging. Still, for someone who makes the conscious decision to look on the bright side of life, there’s enough to do in the Golden State to keep him and his young family entertained.\n“After the Christmas holiday, I feel more settled, I understand the city better now,” he said. “Los Angeles is so big. When I arrived, I didn’t quite understand what it was like to live here. Now I’m learning about schools, life, and football; I am starting to settle in more. In the beginning, it was not so easy. There’s not a walkable city center; you must have a car. When I arrived, my daughters got COVID, and it was not an easy start — but the people in the club helped me a lot, and I am so grateful.\n“I’m enjoying everything. I’m enjoying the football itself and the football environment, and I love to experience the city with my family. It was a huge move and a huge change for me — I had never been out of Turin and Livorno in my life. Leaving Italy and coming here has allowed me to discover many new cultures and a different way of life outside of football. I like it. I’m a curious guy, and I’m very lucky to have found an amazing club that has welcomed my family and me in the best way possible.”\nWhile Chiellini has settled into life in Los Angeles, the draw of home remains. His contract, worth $1.075 million, according to MLS Players’ Association, expires at the end of the season, and he makes no assurances on his future, with retirement on the horizon.\nBack in Turin, where he earned his global reputation with Juventus, dysfunction and scandal have led to the Old Lady being docked 15 points after a case around alleged inflated transfer fees was reopened by an Italian court. Now, this century’s most successful Italian side sits in seventh place, 12 points away from a Champions League spot.\nAdvertisement\nWith several legal battles to come, fans worldwide wait for news on the future of one of Europe’s most historic clubs. For Chiellini, who was raised in Livorno, a four-hour drive from Turin, and grew up an AC Milan fan, being helpless to the struggles of the adopted club of his heart is not entirely unfamiliar after spending the 2006-07 season in Serie B and being stripped of his first Scudetto due to the Calciopoli scandal.\n“For me, it’s painful,” Chiellini said. “I feel sad and hurt by what’s happening to Juventus. It’s hard not to be in Turin, and it’s not easy for everyone who loves the club. Now, the fans need to be patient because the club is fighting for everyone, and I hope everything finishes in the best way possible.\n“On the pitch, they have to think match by match, and we’ll see at the end of the season. As for what’s happening in court, we don’t know — it could be bad, or it could be good. With the responsibility I had at the club, it is tough to be away from the team.”\nWhat he can control, however, is his personal fitness this weekend as he prepares to face LA Galaxy in El Trafico, MLS’ curtain-raiser. The match will be held at the Rose Bowl, where it is expected to set a new MLS record for attendance.\n“I feel in good condition and look forward to starting in an amazing environment at the Rose Bowl. I have good feelings for the next season, knowing it will not be easy.\n“The team and club are good; we want to defend our trophy. We’re going to fight until the end.”\n(Photo: Matthew Ashton – AMA/Getty Images)",
