  "body_text": "It’s a big season for French football.\nFirst, the seemingly never-ending transfer saga of Kylian Mbappe leaving Paris Saint-Germain might finally reach a conclusion. If he joins Real Madrid this summer, Ligue 1 will lose its biggest star.\nSecond, the TV broadcast rights issue — France’s TV revenue already lags behind Europe’s other major leagues and it is without a buyer for its next deal period (2024-29). Trying to sell Ligue 1 sans Mbappe is a much harder task.\nAdvertisement\nThird, and perhaps most important, is the coefficient race, UEFA’s “weighted arithmetic mean” for seeding European leagues — its method for allocating the four extra Champions League spots in next season’s expanded ‘Swiss model’ competition. One of those spots goes to Europe’s fifth-ranked league.\nLigue 1 is currently that league. Next season, the division’s top three will automatically qualify for the Champions League’s new ‘league stage’ and its fourth-placed team will enter the qualifying rounds, with fifth and sixth going into the Europa League and Europa Conference League. Previously, third place had to battle through the qualifying rounds to reach the Champions League group stage, with fourth and fifth taking the Europa League and Conference League spots.\nThere is a distance between Europe’s top four tiers and Ligue 1, shown by the points difference in the Opta visualisation above. UEFA’s coefficient over the last five years has Ligue 1 closer to the Eredivisie (Netherlands) and Primeira Liga (Portugal) than the German Bundesliga. At the start of the season, the Netherlands overtook France in fifth for a period and, as can be seen from the graphic below, Ligue 1 is still lagging behind the biggest divisions in 2023-24.\nCristiano Ronaldo’s comments last month, that teams in the Saudi Pro League “are better than the French league”, were objectively wrong but summarised perceptions of Ligue 1.\nLigue 1’s move to 18 teams this season (following the Bundesliga model) was designed to increase revenue per team, decrease games and fatigue and make space for future extra European matches. It was also the first step in professionalising the Championnat National, France’s third tier.\nThe good news? So far, it is working — all six French teams are still competing in Europe.\nPSG squeezed into second place in their Champions League ‘group of death’, which contained Newcastle United, AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund. Even so, two wins and eight points were their worst Champions League group-stage returns since 2004-05.\nLille cruised through as winners of their Conference League group, while Rennes, Toulouse and Marseille finished runners-up in their Europa League groups. Marseille had their shot in the Champions League but were knocked out in the third qualifying round by Panathinaikos on penalties after conceding a 99th-minute second-leg equaliser.\nAdvertisement\nLens are the odd one out, finishing third in a Champions League group behind Arsenal and PSV Eindhoven, but ahead of Sevilla. They drop into the Europa League but still have the chance to boost Ligue 1’s coefficient, as can be seen from the graphic below.\nThe bad news? The five French teams to play in the next rounds of their competitions (as group winners, Lille went straight through to the Conference League’s last 16) have difficult ties.\nPSG face Real Sociedad, with the first leg taking place tonight. La Real are far from a European heavyweight but tactically, they are not ideal opponents for PSG — they are defensively solid, were unbeaten in the group stage (three wins, three draws) and have only lost five times in 24 league games this season, all by one goal.\nTheir desire to press from the front should cause problems against PSG’s short build-up style. Luis Enrique’s side have made the most errors leading to shots in Ligue 1 and the former Barcelona and Celta Vigo head coach has lost his last three visits to La Real.\nIn the Europa League, Rennes take on Milan, a Champions League semi-finalist last season. Milan showed tactical flexibility in those knockouts, switching from a 4-3-3 formation to a 3-4-3 for defensive stability, and have scored in each of their last 18 games. The first leg is at San Siro, so Rennes need to be at their best defensively to keep the tie alive for the return leg at Roazhon Park.\nToulouse are already punching above their weight. Only founded in 1970, this is their sixth European campaign (the most recent one was in 2009-10), earned via a first Coupe de France win last season. They were promoted from Ligue 2 in 2021-22. They face Benfica, Champions League quarter-finalists last season and leaders in the 2023-24 Primeira League, with 16 wins from 21 games, 46 goals scored and only 14 conceded. Their 4-2-3-1 is set up to control matches.\nMarseille are up against Shakhtar Donetsk, another Champions League dropout but an entirely beatable team. Then again, the same was said last season when Rennes faced Shakhtar in the Europa League knockout round play-offs. Rennes lost on penalties after a last-minute own goal in extra time.\nAdvertisement\nMarseille’s main advantage is that Shakhtar haven’t played a competitive game since their 5-3 group-stage defeat to Porto on December 13. However, since then, Marseille have played nine games and only won twice. Their loss away to Brighton conceded top spot in the group, Rennes knocked them out of the Coupe de France on penalties and they are winless in five Ligue 1 games.\nLens have the pick of the fixtures, up against Freiburg. They are the weakest of the five opponents, though the downside is they are similar teams, both structurally strong (Lens in a 3-4-3, Freiburg usually a 4-3-3) and threatening from wide areas. Lens need to tap into last season’s home form, having won 17 of 19 league games at the Stade Bollaert-Delelis — the first leg is there tomorrow night.\nTwo “performance spot” places are allocated to the leagues with the best collective European performances in the previous season. It is self-fulfilling, has shades of the Super League proposals, and is a problem for France considering their perennial European failures.\nIn the past 10 seasons, France has only seen four teams reach the Champions League semi-finals. Italy had five, Germany six, England 10 and Spain 14. In the Europa League, Marseille (2017-18) and Lyon (2016-17) are the only French semi-finalists in the same time frame. Germany had four, Italy seven, England nine, and Spain 11. Even Ukraine (Shakhtar twice, Dnipro once) better France for Europa League semi-finalists in that period.\nIn addition to PSG in 2019-20 and 2020-21, Monaco (2016-17) and Lyon (2019-20) are the only other French sides to reach the final four of the Champions League since 2014.\nThat was the Monaco generation of Fabinho, Bernardo Silva, Radamel Falcao, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Joao Moutinho, Thomas Lemar, and, of course, Mbappe. By the start of the 2018-19 season, six of those seven had left (only top scorer Falcao remained and he left on a free the next season). Monaco finished 17th that season, two years after reaching the final four of the Champions League and winning Ligue 1.\nThey have slowly recovered, but a similar story is unravelling now at Lyon. Their run to the 2019-20 semi-finals was aided by single-leg knockouts in a pandemic-disrupted season, but they famously knocked out Juventus and then Manchester City. Like Monaco, they had a talented, young core that was dismantled over time: Moussa Dembele, Joachim Andersen, Houssem Aouar, Maxwel Cornet, Bertrand Traore, Martin Terrier, Memphis Depay and Bruno Guimaraes.\nAdvertisement\nLyon won just one of their first 14 games this season, the worst start in the club’s history. They have experienced an upturn under Pierre Sage, winning eight out of their last 10, but are still 13th, just three points above the relegation play-off place. Sage is their third permanent head coach of the season, having replaced Fabio Grosso in November, who only lasted seven games after succeeding Laurent Blanc.\nLigue 1 brands itself as “La Ligue des Talents” — under-21s play more minutes there than Europe’s other major leagues — but suffers because generations rarely stay together long as good talent gets poached, primarily by clubs in other leagues.\nMonaco and Lyon show how success can be quickly built and disappear even faster. Lens and Toulouse are the 12th and 13th different Ligue 1 teams to play in Europe since the start of 2018-19. That is higher than the number of Premier League sides, despite France having fewer European places.\nOnly this summer have PSG started to copy Bayern Munich’s model of buying their domestic league’s best talent. Between buying Mbappe in July 2018 and the summer of 2023, PSG acquired 30 players and only two were from Ligue 1 clubs: Renato Sanches from Lille and Hugo Ekitike from Stade de Reims. Their signing of Bradley Barcola from Lyon this season is an example of a transfer that hurts the selling club but can still benefit the league.\nThere was the irony of PSG’s Champions League final defeat in 2020, losing 1-0 to Bayern. The only goal? A header by PSG ‘enfant du coin’, Kingsley Coman.\nPSG’s 23-man squad contained three senior France internationals: Presnel Kimpembe, Layvin Kurzawa and Mbappe. Bayern’s had four: Coman, Lucas Hernandez, Benjamin Pavard, Corentin Tolisso.\nIt echoed Marseille’s 3-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the 2017-18 Europa League final — a game played in Lyon where the first two goals were scored by Antoine Griezmann, now France’s fourth-most capped player. The caveat: this was an elite Atletico team who had reached the Champions League semi-finals the season before and had played in its final in two of the previous four seasons.\nAdvertisement\nRegardless, it was another European final defeat for a French team. Collectively, they have lost 14 of 16 finals (including one Super Cup defeat), with just one Champions League (Marseille in 1993) and one Cup Winners’ Cup (PSG in 1996) between them. French teams have lost their last six European finals without scoring. They have as many Champions League/European Cup trophies as Romania, Scotland and Yugoslavia, a country that has not existed since 1992, despite having double the number of final appearances as those three combined.\nPSG’s 2017-2023 galacticos era was a European failure: they brought in Lionel Messi, Neymar, Mauro Icardi, Sergio Ramos, Keylor Navas and Achraf Hakimi — the latter is the only one still at the club — to try to win the Champions League but they crashed out in the round of 16 in five of the last seven seasons, cycling through head coaches with little tactical identity.\nThere were famous defeats: by Manchester United on away goals in 2018-19 after PSG had won the first leg 2-0 in Manchester and then conceded a 94th-minute penalty in the return leg. Lyon academy graduate and France international Karim Benzema hit a 17-minute hat-trick in the second half of the second leg between Madrid and PSG at the Bernabeu in 2021-22. PSG were 2-0 up on aggregate at half-time.\nNeither came close to PSG’s infamous La Remontada collapse away to Barcelona in 2017. They won the first leg 4-0, and were leading 5-3 on aggregate in the 88th minute of the second leg. Three unprecedented late goals sent Barcelona through. If the history book is anything to go by, the fact that PSG’s round-of-16 second leg is away to La Real makes it a must-watch.\nMore than ever, Ligue 1 needs all its teams, not just PSG, to go deep in Europe and win silverware, to stay in touch with Europe’s other major leagues. France needs to prove its top tier can be not just a league of talents but a league of trophies too.\n(Photo: NESimages/Perry vd Leuvert/DeFodi Images via Getty Images)",
