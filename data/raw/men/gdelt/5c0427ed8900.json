  "body_text": "PSG head coach Luis Enrique said he ‘didn’t agree at all’ with Mikel Arteta’s assessment that the best team lost after his side denied Arsenal a place in the Champions League final.\nThe Gunners, trailing 1-0 from the first leg, started confidently in Paris, but were once again thwarted by an inspired Gianluigi Donnarumma, who produced a series of world-class saves across the night.\nAfter first denying Gabriel Martinelli, Donnarumma drew audible gasps from the Parc des Princes crowd as he kept out a driven Martin Odegaard strike through a sea of bodies with an astonishing stop.\nSeemingly spurred on by the Italian’s goalkeeping heroics, PSG increased the deficit through Fabian Ruiz, who arrowed a deflected strike beyond David Raya to make it 2-0 on aggregate in the 27th minute.\nAnd while Bukayo Saka cancelled out Achraf Hakimi’s 72nd-minute effort to give Arsenal a glimmer of hope, the hosts held firm to secure their place in this year’s final – where they will do battle with Inter Milan.\n‘I don’t think there’s been a better team in the competition form what I’ve seen,’ Arsenal boss Arteta told TNT Sports shortly after the final whistle.\n‘But we are out. We deserved much more but this competition is about the boxes, the strikers most of the time and the goalkeeper and theirs was the best player in both games.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

We arrived here in the worst state.\n‘You have to get here with everyone fit and available with lots of minutes. They had a week. We came here in a different context.\n‘That gives me a lot of positivity for the future.’\nAsked if he felt the best team had lost at his post-match press conference, the Spaniard told reporters: ‘Yes, and I am saying that because they [PSG] just told me that.\n‘Today, I see how much my players wanted it because they were in tears.\n‘We deserved much more. When you analyse both games, the MVP has been their goalkeeper.\n‘The Champions League is decided in the boxes, and it’s won them the game. The result should have been very different. It gives me so much pride, but at the same time I’m so upset and so annoyed that we didn’t manage to do it.’\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Enrique took a different view to his fellow countryman and ‘great friend’, insisting his team were the deserved victors over the two legs.\nWhen informed of Arteta’s comments, the PSG manager responded: ‘I don’t agree at all.\n‘Arteta is a great friend, but I don’t agree completely. They played well. They played the way they wanted to.\n‘We scored more goals than them. Arsenal played well, we suffered a lot.’\nEnrique did, though, credit Arsenal with making PSG ‘suffer’, admitting Arteta ‘almost killed’ him with his tactics in the French capital.\n‘I think it’s the game in which we suffered the most,’ he added.\n‘We deserve to be in the final. They’re a great team too, but again, we scored more goals. In the second half, it was a different game. We could have scored more goals.\nMore Trending\n‘Mikel Arteta almost killed me. They managed to stretch every ball. The team shows they have a lot of talent. We managed the first half on the counter-attack.’\nThe Ligue 1 giants will now turn their attentions to what promises to be an intriguing contest against three-time European champions Inter Milan on May 31.\nBarcelona had looked to be heading for this year’s final in Munich, with Hansi Flick’s men holding a one-goal lead over their Italian opposition at the San Siro on Tuesday evening.\nBut Francesco Acerbi had other ideas, forcing extra-time with a thunderous strike in the 93rd minute, before Davide Frattesi scored the decisive goal to send the Milan crowd into a frenzy.\nWho will win this year's Champions League?\n-\nInter Milan\n-\nPSG\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Liverpool vs Arsenal: Latest team news, predicted lineup and injuries\nMORE: Xavi sends message to Tottenham over Ange Postecoglou replacement link\nMORE: David Beckham wishes Man Utd signed £100m star ahead of Arsenal",
