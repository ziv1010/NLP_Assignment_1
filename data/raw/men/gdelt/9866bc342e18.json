  "body_text": "Spain vs Scotland LIVE: Euro 2024 qualifier result after Scott McTominay goal controversially ruled out\nScotland suffered their first Euro 2024 qualifying defeat with a 2-0 loss in Spain but qualification hopes remain alive.\nThe Scots had won their first five Group A qualifiers including a 2-0 win over the Spanish at Hampden Park in March and needed to take something from the return game in Seville or Norway fail to beat Cyprus, to qualify on the night.\nIn a stifling warm evening, the Scots survived some heavy first-half pressure to go in at the break goalless before Scott McTominay, who scored both goals against Spain in Glasgow, fired in a wonderful free-kick in the 59th minute only to see it ruled out after a VAR check for a Jack Hendry infringement.\nAlvaro Morata headed in after 73 minutes and substitute Oihan Sancet and Scotland defender Ryan Porteous clashed together for the second in the 86th minute and with Norway beating Cyprus, Steve Clarke’s men move on to the second October fixture.\nFollow all the action as Spain host Scotland in the Euro 2024 qualifiers plus get all the latest odds and tips right here:\nSpain vs Scotland live\nFULL TIME! Spain 2-0 Scotland\nNorway beat Cyprus 4-0, so Scotland have to wait for Euro 2024 qualification\n86 mins: GOAL! Spain double their lead as Porteous slides in (ESP 2-0 SCO)\n74 mins: GOAL!

Now, though, it is Scotland who have reason to fume - and Steve Clarke’s side surely will over the coming days as the waiting begins. Qualification for Euro 2024 could yet be secured on Sunday, should Spain defeat Norway in Oslo. Thanks to Scotland’s perfect start to Group A, they may yet avoid a nervy November. But, if it was not for the finest of margins on a night of major controversy, they may not have needed to rely on favours from elsewhere.\nThere is no shame in losing to Spain but Scotland will not quite believe how this unfolded. As expected, Spain were dominant and Scotland had to survive waves of pressure. The visitors would have had no complaints had Luis de la Fuente’s improved side taken a deserved lead but Scotland went into half-time with the match goalless and their plan very much alive. Scotland only needed a chance to turn their rearguard approach into a perfect one and Scott McTominay looked to have found it with a moment of magic.\nScotland will feel the decision to disallow his opening goal for a foul on the Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon was not the only one that went against them in Seville.\nSpain 2-0 Scotland report\nScotland forced to wait for Euro 2024 — but they will not understand how\nJohn McGinn claims Scotland beating Spain made ‘impossible’ after VAR controversy\nFriday 13 October 2023 00:06 , Jamie Braidwood\nJohn McGinn said the “big moments went against Scotland” and made victory in Spain “near enough impossible” as Steve Clarke’s side missed out on the chance to secure early qualification for Euro 2024 following a controversial 2-0 defeat in Seville.\nScotland needed a point against Spain to book their place at the Euros next summer and, although they had to survive spells of pressure against the hosts, thought they had made the breakthrough when Scott McTominay scored a sublime free-kick on 59 minutes.\nBut McTominay’s goal was disallowed by referee Serdar Gozubuyuk after a VAR check, with the initial explanation being that Scotland defender Jack Hendry had infringed on Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon. However, McGinn said the Dutch official then clarified that Hendry was offside and was interfering with play.\nJohn McGinn claims Scotland beating Spain made ‘impossible’ after VAR controversy\nSteve Clarke insists Scotland must move on from disappointing VAR decision\nThursday 12 October 2023 23:45 , Jamie Braidwood\nSteve Clarke insists Scotland simply have to move on after Scott McTominay had a goal chalked off after a VAR check before losing 2-0 to Spain in Seville.\nThe Scots had won their first five Group A qualifiers including a 2-0 win over the Spanish at Hampden Park in March, and they thought they had taken the lead when McTominay, who scored twice in Glasgow, fired in a wonderful free-kick in the 59th minute only to see it ruled out after a VAR check for a Jack Hendry infringement.\nAlvaro Morata headed in after 73 minutes and substitute Oihan Sancet, making his debut, added a second in the 86th minute to leave Group A leaders Scotland three points ahead of Spain having played a game more.\nClarke’s men face France in a friendly in Lille next Tuesday but Spain face Norway in Oslo two days earlier and if the Norwegians drop points, Scotland’s place in Germany will be secured while the Scots also have Georgia away and Norway at home in November.\nSteve Clarke insists Scotland must move on from disappointing VAR decision\nScotland provide update after Andy Robertson appears to dislocate shoulder\nThursday 12 October 2023 23:38 , Jamie Braidwood\nScotland captain Andy Robertson will return to Liverpool to have a scan after suffering a shoulder injury in the 2-0 defeat to Spain in Seville.\nRobertson was forced off late in the first half of the Euro 2024 qualifier following a challenge from the Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon.\nThe left back appeared to have suffered a dislocation and left the pitch with his arm wrapped in his shirt, which he was using as a makeshift sling.\nScotland went on to lose their first match of their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign, following Scott McTominay’s controversially disallowed goal.\nIt means Scotland could be forced to go to Georgia in November needing a result, unless Norway fail to beat Spain in Oslo on Sunday.\nRobertson could be missing for the fixture but the more immediate concern is upcoming games for Liverpool, with the Merseyside derby against Everton a week on Saturday on October 21.\nScotland provide update after Andy Robertson appears to dislocate shoulder\nWhat do Scotland need to qualify for Euro 2024?\nThursday 12 October 2023 23:15 , Jamie Braidwood\nScotland suffered their first Euro 2024 qualifying defeat with a loss in Spain but qualification hopes remain alive.\nThe Scots had won their first five Group A qualifiers including a 2-0 win over the Spanish at Hampden Park in March and needed to take something from the return game in Seville to qualify on the night, or for Norway to fail to beat Cyprus.\nBut as Spain controversially won 2-0, Scotland were made to wait. Norway cruised past Cyprus with a 4-0 win, thanks to two goals from Erling Haaland.\nIt means Scotland lead the group with 15 points from their six games having endured defeat for the first time in the campaign, while Spain have 12 points from five matches and Norway 10 from six.\nAttention now turns to Sunday: simply, Scotland will qualify for Euro 2024 if Norway fail to win at home to Spain in Oslo.\nWhat do Scotland need to qualify for Euro 2024?\nFULL TIME! Spain 2-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 22:34 , Jamie Braidwood\nJohn McGinn, speaking to ViaPlay: “the big moments went against us. We can still improve, but we put in some shift. We knew at least a point tonight would get us there, so that’s a really tough one to take. It’s a sore blow losing Robbo early, then thinking we’re ahead, we regroup and then they score.\n“We competed for long spells. It’s very difficult to win here and, under the circumstances, it was near enough impossible.\n“You need to be very careful what you say. I think everyone watching that game tonight from a Scotland point of view, wherever you were, it just felt like we weren’t getting any 50/50 decision - it made it very difficult against a world class team.\n“You need a perfect performance here to win, and everything to align and it was just never going to happen.\n“He (the referee) changed it (his reasoning on the VAR check) in the game, which is the annoying thing. It means it’s not clear and obvious.\n“Is he going to save it? No chance. No goalkeeper in the world is going to save that. However, at one point he’s said it’s a foul, realises it isn’t a foul, so changes it to offside.”\nFULL TIME! Spain 2-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 22:12 , Jamie Braidwood\nStrong words from John McGinn:\n“It’s a tough one to take. The decisions went against us.\n“This is a tough place to win but under the circumstances tonight it felt impossible.”\nFULL TIME! Spain 2-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:50 , Jamie Braidwood\nHere’s the moment Spain finally broke through. It was a moment of class from the 37-year-old Jesus Navas, and the slightest touch from Alvaro Morata.\n🇪🇸 After the disallowed goal, captain Álvaro Morata gets the breakthrough for Spain.\nJesús Navas with a great assist 👏#Euro2024 pic.twitter.com/AMTjFJgkTv— Viaplay Sports UK (@ViaplaySportsUK) October 12, 2023\nFULL TIME! Spain 2-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:44 , Jamie Braidwood\nNope, this was not Scotland’s night, but it will go down as a hugely controversial one.\nStill, with Norway also winning, Scotland will now have to hope Spain defeat Norway on Sunday.\nA place at Euro 2024 could still be days away, but it will not be tonight.\nSpain 2-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:40 , Jamie Braidwood\n90+1 mins: There will be five minutes added on. Kenny McLean, on for Scotland along with Billy Gilmour, is not too far from nodding a consolation goal past Simon.\nThere is relief for Spain now.\nGOAL! Spain 2-0 Scotland (Porteous own goal 85’)\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:35 , Jamie Braidwood\nSpain double their lead - and this is cruel on Scotland.\nIt comes from a slip from Aaron Hickey. From it, Torres takes possession and cuts a ball across the face. Porteous, who defended so brilliantly in the previous action, slides in to try and stop the Spain forward from tapping into an empty net but puts it past Gunn.\nThis simply hasn’t been Scotland’s night.\nSpain 1-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:34 , Jamie Braidwood\n85 mins: Morata is replaced by Joselu, who almost makes an immediate impact. The Real Madrid striker latches onto a loose ball and rounds Gunn, but Porteous recovers to make a sliding challenge and keep it out.\nSpain 1-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:32 , Jamie Braidwood\n84 mins: Another chance! As Scotland pile on the pressure, the ball looks to break to Armstrong in the box. But Rodri, somehow, is able to get a leg up and block it. Spain staying alive this time by the barest of margins.\nHere, by the way, is the disallowed goal.\n🏴 Scott McTominay thought he scored an absolute worldie...\nBut it's been disallowed for a foul after a VAR check. 🙅♂️#Euro2024 pic.twitter.com/pdtYhUFwhY— Viaplay Sports UK (@ViaplaySportsUK) October 12, 2023\nSpain 1-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:30 , Jamie Braidwood\n81 mins: CHANCE! What an opportunity this is for Scotland! Hickey, who has been immense, flies forward and dribbles into the Spain box. He hacks an effort towards goal and it breaks to Adams, who only needs to prod the ball past Simon. But the striker is not able to make enough contact, and the goalkeeper can collect.\nScotland, though, are building some late momentum.\nSpain 1-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:27 , Jamie Braidwood\n78 mins: A double change for Scotland: the front two have put in some shift and are now swapped, as Dykes and Christie are replaced by Adams and Armstrong.\nSpain 1-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:26 , Jamie Braidwood\n76 mins: A graphic has now flashed up showing that Hendry was “offside” from McTominay’s free-kick, still only by an inch.\nUefa initially said the goal was disallowed because there had been a foul on the Spain goalkeeper.\nGOAL! Spain 1-0 Scotland (Morata 73’)\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:21 , Jamie Braidwood\nSpain lead.\nAnd you can’t say it had not been coming.\nJesus Navas has only been on for a matter of moments but the veteran winger picks out a stunning cross to find Morata, and the Spain captain heads past Gunn.\nIt still feels incredibly harsh on Scotland after that disallowed goal.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:19 , Jamie Braidwood\n71 mins: Spain have managed to sustain a spell of possession. McTominay hacks away Torres’s cross after the winger got past Hickey. It’s backs to the wall again.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:15 , Jamie Braidwood\n66 mins: Now it’s getting tetchy. Hendry leans over Morata after the striker stays down and says a few words, only for Morata to jump to his feet.\nSpain have barely threatened this half.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:13 , Jamie Braidwood\n63 mins: Michael Stewart on commentary has just called that decision a “joke” and I’m sure few would disagree.\nHendry barely touched Simon and certainly did not stop the goalkeeper form being able to do anything about McTominay’s strike.\nScotland need to keep their heads now - McTominay threw a water bottle down in anger after that goal was ruled out.\nAnd now Norway lead Cyprus 2-0.\nNO GOAL! Spain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:10 , Jamie Braidwood\nI cannot believe this. The goal has been ruled out following a VAR review.\nThe referee has given a foul on the goalkeeper by Hendry, as McTominay’s shot curled in.\nBut it’s a farce: Hendry barely touched Simon.\nGOAL! Spain 0-1 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:09 , Jamie Braidwood\nWhat has Scott McTominay just done?! What has McTominay just done?!\nFrom the tightest of angles, McTominay curls in a beauty of a free kick past Simon!\nThat is a stunner - and Scotland lead in Spain! INCREDIBLE!\nGOAL! Spain 0-1 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:08 , Jamie Braidwood\nOOOOH MY GOODNESS!\nMCTOMINAY FOR SCOTLAND!!!!!! WHAT A GOAL!\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:07 , Jamie Braidwood\n58 mins: There’s a faint cry of ‘We’re going to Germany’ coming out from the Tartan Army after a spell of Scotland possession and, whisper it quitely, the visitors are growing into this.\nChristie is then fouled on the edge of the Spain box after Carvajal gives a cheap ball away...\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:05 , Jamie Braidwood\n55 mins: CLOSE! Almost brilliant from Morata, who brings a ball down in the box, cuts past Porteous, and looks to scoop a shot into the far corner.\nIt just goes over the bar, much to Scotland’s relief.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 21:02 , Jamie Braidwood\n52 mins: CHANCE! A rare opening for Scotland - but it goes begging! Dykes is able to turn and find McGinn, who looks for Christie’s cutting run into the box. But McGinn’s pass is hammered into Christie and the forward can’t control it. Simon is able to collect with ease.\nBest moment yet for Scotland.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:59 , Jamie Braidwood\n50 mins: Breathe... another nervy moment for Scotland as Torres swings in a cross and Le Normand is close to sliding in. Scotland, though, had kept their line well and the defender would have been offside.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:57 , Jamie Braidwood\n48 mins: There is indeed a crackle of excitement as Zaragoza beats Patterson, cuts past McTominay, but then skies his shot well over the bar. The winger looks a livewire.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:53 , Jamie Braidwood\nBack underway! Spain have made a double change: Bryan Zaragoza, wearing the No 10, and Fran García come on for Oyarzabal and Balde.\nThere is a lot of excitement about Zaragoza in Spain.\nHALF TIME! Spain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:51 , Jamie Braidwood\nHere’s how Robertson sustained his injury - is Unai Simon fortunate he didn’t give away a penalty after coming out and crashing into the Scotland captain?\nThe second half is underway, next.\nHALF TIME! Spain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:41 , Jamie Braidwood\nScotland are yet to have a single shot, but that’s not really the end of the pitch that matters tonight.\nSpain remain goalless, which is all Scotland need. But they’ve survived some nervy moments, namely when Torres shot wide after being played through and when Merino’s shot somehow stayed out after clipping the inside of the post.\nSteve Clarke’s side will also have to get through the second half without their captain after Andy Robertson was forced off with a shoulder injury.\nHALF TIME! Spain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:37 , Jamie Braidwood\nScotland are halfway there, following a first 45 minutes that felt a lot longer than that.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:36 , Jamie Braidwood\n45 + 3 mins: Merino goes into the book with a cynical challenge on McTominay from behind. Is that a sign of frustration from Spain? Scotland have done their job so far...\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:35 , Jamie Braidwood\n45+1 mins: We are into four minutes added time: Patterson has come to the right and Hickey has gone to the left, and the Everton defender gets a huge let off as Balde nicks a ball on the byline and looks to break into the box. Porteous makes a brilliant challenge and Scotland clear.\nBut that was a warning: Patterson needs to sharpen up quickly.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:31 , Jamie Braidwood\n43 mins: What a huge blow this is.\nRobertson is forced off, with what looks like a dislocated shoulder - the captain goes off the pitch with his arm in his shirt as a makeshift sling.\nHe is replaced by Nathan Patterson, but Scotland now are without Robertson and Tierney.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:30 , Jamie Braidwood\n41 mins: Oh no... this could be bad news for Scotland. Steve Clarke’s side had a couple of chances to put the ball into the box. From the second cross from the left, Andy Robertson went up for the ball but was clattered into by the Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon.\nThe referee gave a free kick to Spain, but Robertson stays down holding his shoulder....\nThat is a major worry.\nNO GOAL! Spain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:26 , Jamie Braidwood\n38 mins: Spain have the ball in the net but Morata was standing about five yards offside. Still, there’s a wag of the finger towards the linesman.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:24 , Jamie Braidwood\n36 mins: Another nervy moment for Scotland as Dykes appears to catch Laporte when challenging for a high ball. For a moment, it looked like the referee was reaching for the red card.... but instead only pulled out the yellow. Laporte was complaining earlier in the game about Dkyes and the rather physical approach of the Scotland forward.\nHe’s on thin ice now.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:21 , Jamie Braidwood\n32 mins: OFF THE POST! Scotland survive, but HOW?! First Hickey makes an oustanding block on Oyarzabal after a sharp Gavi cutback. From the rebound, Merino’s shot takes a nick of Hendry and cannons off the inside of the post, before flying across the goalline and out! How on earth has that not gone in. Scotland are alive by the barest of margins.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:21 , Jamie Braidwood\n31 mins: Ah, it’s not goalless anymore. Norway have the lead in Cyprus. It’s not Erling Haaland, rather Alexander Sørloth with the breakthrough.\nAs it stands though, Scotland are heading through with this 0-0 draw. Long way to go, though.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:19 , Jamie Braidwood\n28 mins: Another half-chance for Spain and Morata as a through ball beats the Scotland backline. Morata manages to round Gunn, but then puts the finish into the side-netting from the angle. It may have been offside, anyway, but that’s a reminder for Scotland after an encouraging 10-minute spell.\nI should add: it remains goalless between Norway and Cyprus.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:14 , Jamie Braidwood\n26 mins: FOUL! Surely! Scotland get a rare chance to come forward through Christie, who switches play to Robertson. The captain nods on to McGinn, who flicks past Carvajal but is then taken out by the Spain right back. The referee, however, points for a goal kick! Scotland can’t believe it and the home fans are furious with the reaction. This is getting edgy, that’s for sure.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:12 , Jamie Braidwood\n24 mins: Callum McGregor looks to have been fouled in midfield but play is allowed to continue as Spain come forward. A ball towards Oyarzabal is shielded clear by Aaron Hickey, who has started very well in that particular match-up.\nThe Spain fans are starting to get restless. The boos are starting to begin over each Scotland free-kick and restart, which is surely an accusation of time-wasting.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:09 , Jamie Braidwood\n22 mins: Ryan Christie attempts to lead a counter-attack from well inside his own half but is quickly swallowed up by the Spain midfield. It’s almost like Scotland are playing uphill.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:08 , Jamie Braidwood\n20 mins: Scotland concede possession cheaply and the Spain pressure resumes. A smart turn from Gavi leads to Oyarzabal firing a half-chance over the bar. Angus Gunn, in goal, has yet to be threatened.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:05 , Jamie Braidwood\n15 mins: Scotland reach the first quarter of an hour. Carvajal guides a cross towards the back post looking for Torres, but Porteous is there to guide it behind for a corner.\nScotland survive another scare from the set-piece. The corner was flicked on at the near post but scrambled clear with Morata lurking. That’s the second time Scotland have failed to make the first contact.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 20:00 , Jamie Braidwood\n11 mins: The Scotland shirts are already dropping deep to form a tight cluster of white shirts on the edge of the box. The Spain pressure is immense already and Balde’s shot, looking towards the far post, is actually blocked by a teammate.\nThis could be a long night.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 19:57 , Jamie Braidwood\n8 mins: The small pocket of Scotland fans in Seville are booing Rodri on every touch. The Tartan Army are making themselves heard.\nGavi has already made a difference for Luis de la Fuente’s side with a couple of sharp touches in midfield.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 19:54 , Jamie Braidwood\n6 mins: Better from Scotland. It’s good from Aaron Hickey as he wins a key challenge and stops Morata from flying forward. He slips a ball out to Dykes, who crosses into the box. It almost breaks to McTominay, but Spain are able to clear.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 19:52 , Jamie Braidwood\n4 mins: My goodness. Scotland survive again but this has been a dangerous start. A Spain corner is not dealt with by the Scotland defence. Morata is free at the back post but heads wide. This was a harder chance that the first one, but it’s another let off for Clarke’s side.\nSpain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 19:49 , Jamie Braidwood\n2 mins: CHANCE! Spain should be ahead - that is a major let off for Scotland! Ferran Torres is slipped through, with Scotland’s backline all over the place, but the Spain forward puts it wide! What a miss!\nSpain are dominating the opening stages.\nKICK-OFF! Spain 0-0 Scotland\nThursday 12 October 2023 19:47 , Jamie Braidwood\nUnderway in Seville! Can Scotland get the job done tonight? Spain are starting with just three players who began at Hampden in March - they are a different side and a much tougher test for Steve Clarke’s men.\nBut a draw would do - can Scotland secure it?\nSpain vs Scotland: Kick-off is next!\nThursday 12 October 2023 19:43 , Jamie Braidwood\nThe players are out at La Cartuja and it’s time for the anthems!\nScotland have not won in Spain since 1963 - victory tonight would not only be historic, but would secure qualification for Euro 2024.\nIt’s a big one - and that’s a Flower of Scotland to reflect it.\nSpain respond with a rousing rendition of their own - the hosts are desperate to get their own back tonight.\nSpain vs Scotland: More McSauce?\nThursday 12 October 2023 19:41 , Jamie Braidwood\nScott McTominay was Scotland’s hero last time out against Spain with both goals at Hampden. Only Romelu Lukaku has scored more than the Manchester United midfielder during Euro 2024 qualifying. With six, he has more than the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Harry Kane and Robert Lewandowski.\nSpain vs Scotland: Steve Clarke says Scots won’t ‘defend all night’\nThursday 12 October 2023 19:37 , Jamie Braidwood\nSteve Clarke on how Scotland can repeat their upset of Spain tonight: “I think we have been constantly improving over my tenure as head coach.\n“We are improving all the time, we are striving to improve, trying to add little bits to our game that will make us more competitive against the top teams but we understand we still have a bit to go.”\n“But we don’t come here thinking that we have to sit in and defend all night.\n“We have to be as effective with the ball as we were at Hampden. We want to get the job done as quickly as possible.\n“If we are good enough to get it done tomorrow night that would be great. If not we have two more chances in November and we have those chances because we started the group so well.\n“We have 15 points from five games, that is a good start.\n“We know we have to get more points to get over the line. Do I think this team will finish the group on 15 points? No, I think we will get more points. Whether that is tomorrow or in November.”\nSpain vs Scotland: McGinn calls on Rodri to be shown ‘respect’\nThursday 12 October 2023 19:28 , Jamie Braidwood\nJohn McGinn on facing Rodri after the Spain captain called Scotland “rubbish” following the 2-0 defeat in Glasgow:\n“It doesn’t matter anymore. I’ve probably lost count of the amount of trophies he’s won since that game.\n“There’s not much we can say to him. He’ll have said things in the heat of the moment, but it’s gone now.\n“He’s a world-class player who we all respect as a squad, and I think the country should follow.”\nSpain vs Scotland: ‘We need to be better’, insists John McGinn\nThursday 12 October 2023 19:21 , Jamie Braidwood\nJohn McGinn ahead of Scotland’s trip to Spain and why it’s an exciting time for the national team: “There’s plenty more to come. We’re all at a good age. We’re getting more and more experience of these games.\n“The great thing for us is there’s a couple of great young players bubbling away in the background that could come and improve us.\n“It’s a really exciting time to be a Scotland player. The fans are here regardless of the results, but we’re now giving them some success which we’re enjoying. Hopefully we can carry that on.\n“When you come back up the road you hear about the positive impact you’re having on the whole country. Everyone is behind the team again.\n“We need to be better (than the win over Spain). We’re away from home, a team is stronger at home. It wasn’t as hot in Glasgow in March.\n“We need to be aggressive, it’s in our nature as a country. Hard working, determined, we’ll fight for every ball.\n“We need to get the balance right. We need to be physical and aggressive, but we’ve got some great players as well. At the Spain game, we showed good moments of quality.”\nSpain vs Scotland: How the Scots became the one team Rodri could not defeat\nThursday 12 October 2023 19:11 , Jamie Braidwood\nThere was the Champions League in Istanbul. The FA Cup at Wembley. A third Premier League title in a row in Manchester. The treble was followed by the Nations League in the Netherlands and the Super Cup in Greece. Yet if the list of trophies won by Rodri with club and country in 2023 can only be matched by Aymeric Laporte, the Spaniard’s compatriot and former Manchester City teammate can hardly rival his influence: it was Rodri who scored the winning goal against Inter Milan in June’s Champions League final, Rodri who was named player of the finals as Spain defeated Croatia to win the Nations League.\nIt is tempting to brand 2023 as the year of Rodri; individual awards do not tend to favour defensive midfielders, but he may have a case for winning the Ballon d’Or. Yet an outstanding campaign has featured just the one dark night: at Hampden in March, Rodri and Spain were humbled by Scotland, beaten 2-0 in the swirling rain.\nYet Scotland would be wise to look ahead to their trip to La Cartuja with a certain amount of trepidation: Spain are seeking revenge and, in Rodri, Scotland have managed to make a nemesis out of a player whose powers have never felt greater.\nSpain vs Scotland preview\nHow Scotland became the one team Rodri could not defeat\nSpain vs Scotland: Team news!\nThursday 12 October 2023 18:59 , Jamie Braidwood\nThe big question facing Steve Clarke this week was how he was going to replace the injured Kieran Tierney - and the Scotland boss has gone with Scott McKenna in a move that suggests he is sticking with his back three.\nScott McTominay, Callum McGregor and John McGinn form the midfield three, with Lyndon Dykes selected ahead of Che Adams to lead the line. He will need some support from Ryan Christie, who also starts in attack.\nSpain are much stronger than they were at Hampden.

Oh, someone called Rodri is playing too.\nSpain XI: Simon; Carvajal, Le Normand, Laporte, Balde; Merino, Rodri, Gavi; Torres, Morata, Oyarzabal\nScotland XI: Gunn; Porteous, Hendry, McKenna; Hickey, McTominay, McGregor, Robertson; Christie, McGinn; Dykes\nSpain vs Scotland: What do Scotland need to qualify for Euro 2024?\nThursday 12 October 2023 18:48 , Jamie Braidwood\nScotland are currently six points ahead of Spain, who have a game in hand, and still have Georgia and Norway to face in November to complete the Euro qualifiers.\nIf Scotland draw or win against Spain, they will qualify for Euro 2024.
