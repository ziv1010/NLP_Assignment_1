  "body_text": "Manchester United will make a concrete attempt to sign Tyler Dibling if they secure Champions League qualification, as per reports.\nRuben Amorim’s men showed a commendable level of grit to score three goals in less than 10 minutes to seal a 5-4 win over Olympique Lyonnais.\nHowever, the fact United put themselves in such a position despite leading by a two-goal margin at the break underlines there’s a need of a big summer of recruitment at Old Trafford.\nA report suggests that the fightback against Lyon will have a major say in the club’s transfer plans.\nAccording to ESPN, United will “step up their interest” in Southampton midfielder Dibling if the Red Devils win the Europa League and book a place in next season’s Champions League.\nHanded his first professional contract by United technical director Jason Wilcox during his stint as Southampton’s director of football, Dibling has taken to senior football like a duck to water.\nThe Saints are relegated to the Championship but Dibling has made plenty of positive headlines with his performances in the Premier League.\nThe 19-year-old’s aggressive style, electric pace, and versatility have put him on the radar of many top clubs, including Chelsea, Manchester City, and Bayern Munich.\nThe England under-21 international, who thrives as a right-winger, has been directly involved in seven goals in all competitions.\nSouthampton are keen on taking advantage of the hype, having slapped a £100 million price tag on their academy product. ESPN, however, suggest the £100m figure is an unlikely valuation, especially with the club heading to England’s second tier.\nIt is added that United’s interest “depends on the club boosting their financial situation by qualifying for the Champions League via the Europa League.” The qualification to Europe’s biggest competition is worth at least £80m to United.\nUnited face fourth-placed La Liga outfit Athletic Club in the semi-final next month. Led by ex-Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde, Athletic are a far more coherent side than Lyon and are unlikely to hand the Mancunians many opportunities to make up for their defensive howlers.\nTottenham Hotspur, who are also keen on Dibling, play against FK Bodø/Glimt in the other semi-final.\nFeature image Michael Steele via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
