  "body_text": "COLIN FORTUNE DOESN’T fully remember Athlone Town’s last home European night, but he’s told he was at the 1983 defeat to Standard Liège as a kid.\n42 years on, he’s managing the women’s team on their Champions League debut, as Cardiff City come to town for the first qualifying round semi-final this evening [KO 7.30pm, live on LOI TV].\nA nephew of the legendary brothers Turlough, Michael and Padraig O’Connor, Fortune is following in the footsteps of uncle Turlough in leading an Athlone side into Champions League fare.\n“Listen, I lived in St Mel’s Park,” Fortune smiles. “My family, we have a deep history with Athlone Town. My mother’s an O’Connor. Turlough was the manager, I would have been probably on his shoulder.\n“Mel’s Park back then was an unbelievable place. My mother’s home place was in Sarsfield Square, the neighbouring estate. I have massive, massive memories from them times.”\nIt’s time to make new ones, the 0-0 draw with AC Milan in 1975 another standout European fixture in the Athlone Town chronicles. More history awaits.\nThe women’s team have added a fabled chapter of their own since their inception in 2020. The Midlanders’ rise has been remarkable, really. Having risen the Women’s Premier Division ranks, they won their first FAI Cup in 2023. They followed that up with historic league title success last season and, as a result, fly the Irish flag in Europe.\nAfter Tommy Hewitt laid the foundations, silverware arrived under Ciarán Kilduff, and Fortune has carried the mantel in 2025.\nAthlone remain the only team unbeaten in the Women’s Premier Division this season, leading Shelbourne by three points with a game more played. Fortune admits they “took (their) eye off the ball a little bit” in recent 1-1 draws with Galway United and Treaty United, and “had one eye on Cardiff” as Champions League duty subconsciously took precedence.\nFortune has been sweating on the fitness of in-form attacking stars Madie Gibson and Kelly Brady, and captain Izzy Groves, this week, but is “hopeful” they will be available for selection.\nUS-born Ireland underage international Brady is Athlone’s top scorer with 10 league goals this season, while Gibson is one of the division’s most exciting players. In all, they have scored 32 goals, and conceded just four — eight less than anyone else. A defence led by Kayleigh Shine and goalkeeper Megan Plaschko can be proud of that, while Roisin Molloy is another standout amidst a blend of youth, experience, international and domestic stars.\nWhile Athlone are in the thick of it, Cardiff City have been in pre-season. The Welsh double champions are set for their third consecutive Champions League campaign, having lost all seven matches they’ve previously played in the competition without scoring a goal.\nIndeed, Shelbourne beat them 3-0 in 2023, but Fortune warns of the challenge ahead.\n“They’re a very formidable side. Although their results in this competition haven’t been good, it’s a little bit false because they’ve been up against some difficult teams.\n“People are looking at it saying, ‘Ah, the Welsh league . . .’ They are a very, very good side. Women’s football in the Welsh league is developing and improving every year. We’re expecting a very, very difficult game.”\nManaged by Iain Darbyshire since 2020, full-back and set-piece threat Ffion Price is among their key players.\nWhile Cardiff can turn to their European experience, Athlone Town enjoy home comforts after the efforts of new owner Nick Giannotti to host. Over 1,000 tickets had been sold as of Monday, and Fortune is hoping his side can make home advantage count.\n“The players, they will give it their all, I’ve no doubt about that, they will turn up and they will be 100% at it, but there’s going to be times in the game where they’re going to need a bit of a push, a bit of backing.\n“This is massive for our club, it’s massive for the community, it’s massive for the football people of Athlone. Athlone town is a football town. Something like this might just get people back on side, get people back supporting the club.”\nTonight’s winners progress to the first qualifying round final against ŽNK Agram of Croatia on Saturday. Fortune and his staff have some homework done, but are fully focused on the task in hand.\nEileen Gleeson’s Peamount United Class of 2011/12 were the first Irish side to emerge from the Uefa Women’s Champions League qualifying phase. Raheny United followed suit to the knockout stages.\nPeas and Shelbourne are among those to have fallen short in recent years on foreign soil.\nThe Greenogue history-makers of 14 years ago are the only others to have hosted a Women’s Champions League game in Ireland. Could that be a positive omen?\nWhatever happens, history beckons in the Midlands.",
