  "body_text": "Liverpool have endured a terrible run of form and luck over the past couple of months that have seen their results fall off a cliff. The Reds have lost 9 of their last 12 matches across all competitions, and have been outscored 10-1 over the last 3. Liverpool now sit 12th in the Premier League table, behind the likes of Everton, Manchester United, and the mighty Sunderland.\nJamie Carragher Believes Next Week Essential To Save Slot’s Job\nThe former Liverpool captain turned pundit says the upcoming stretch of Premier League matches is make or break for Slot\nPerhaps the most damning indictment of the run, and the season in general, has been the lack of adjustments to address seemingly glaring issues. Arne Slot built up a massive amount of goodwill, leading Liverpool to their 20th top flight title last season. That goodwill has mostly evaporated as the Reds have continually looked static in the attack and frail in defense as Slot has seemed to rely and the same tactics and personnel.\nFormer Liverpool captain turned pundit, Jamie Carragher, believes that Slot has a very short time now to turn things around. Carragher stated in a column for the Telegraph that this next week is critical for the Liverpool head coach.\n”Arne Slot has a week to save his job. No matter how much goodwill the manager has, Liverpool Football Club cannot sustain the drop in standards witnessed over the past three months.”\n“No one knows better than me how much that reality will be hurting everyone connected with my old club. Liverpool do not willingly sack coaches, especially those that bring great success. After Slot won the Premier League in his first season, he seemed destined for a long stay on Merseyside too. Now, just six months later, he is hanging on.”\nLiverpool’s next three fixtures SHOULD be quite winnable. Slot’s side travels to West Ham on Sunday before fixtures against two promoted sides in Sunderland on Wednesday and Leeds the following Saturday. Carragher believes that all three matches being in the Premier League against sides that the Reds would typically be heavily favored in means this is a make or break stretch.\n“With respect to the upcoming opponents, he could not have picked a better sequence of games to win back trust and save himself. But if it gets any worse and the manager cannot find the answers, the club will have no choice but to find someone else who can.”",
