  "body_text": "Jason Cundy has slammed Myles Lewis-Skelly for copying Erling Haaland’s celebration and claims Arsenal ‘haven’t earned the right’ to be mocking Manchester City.\nMikel Arteta’s side delivered a dominant display against the Premier League champions on Sunday as they ran out 5-1 winners at the Emirates Stadium.\nLewis-Skelly was involved in a heated exchange with Haaland when the two sides met at the Etihad Stadium in September and the 18-year-old sent a clear message to the City striker by mimicking his celebration after scoring Arsenal’s third goal in Sunday’s fixture.\nBut Cundy has told Lewis-Skelly to ‘wind your neck in’ and suggests the Arsenal defender could now face strong retaliation from City’s players in future games because of his celebration.\n‘If I had to say to you now what’s the biggest needle in the game right now I’d say it’s Gabriel and Haaland, it’s only recent, it’s only this season,’ Cundy said on talkSPORT.\n‘There’s no real needle is there? There’s a little bit between the two clubs but that goes historically back.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘And I love that… a centre-half versus a centre-forward, all for that, Gabriel shouting in his face, it’s not wise when there’s only two minutes on the clock, pick and choose your battles.\n‘But the Lewis-Skelly stuff… wind your neck in. Arsenal fans will love it and I get why they love it, ‘he’s one of us, he’s one of our own’. Fine. Haaland’s completed football.\n‘And be careful what you do at that age. I’m not so sure it’s wise for him to be doing that. Run off, celebrate your goal, do what you need to do, he’s a brilliant young player, he’s going to have a stellar career by the looks of it, he looks top drawer.\n‘I’m not convinced it’s the wisest thing to do because there’s many years to come, you wait, we saw what Roy Keane did to Haaland’s dad, just be careful what battles you [take].\n‘Also, they’re Arsenal and what have they done in the last 20 years? Seriously, how can they be taking that battle there? Quieten yourselves down, you’re a good side, a really good team, you showed that at the weekend, you’re probably going to be second again.\nMore Trending\n‘When you win something then you can shout from the houses, they you can start doing all this housery. It’s built on nothing. It comes from Arteta, he loves to promote it, it’s fine, Arsenal fans will love it, I totally get it. I watched Chelsea under Jose [Mourinho], Jose won things, Jose won back to back Premier Leagues, he was there.\n‘You earn the right, and right now, Arsenal haven’t earned the right to be doing that sort of housery. It’s fine, do it, see where it ends up, come back at the end of the season. If they win the Premier League or the Champions League then we’ll have this conversation. But right now you’re just pups, you’re pups and you’re messing around with the big boys who have been there. Haaland’s got all the medals, he’s got the [Premier League] badge on the side, it was a bad day at the office.\n‘This is the trouble with Arsenal fans, it’s all about the now. Trouble is, when was the last time they had ‘the now’? Seriously, when was it the last time it was ‘the now’? When was the last time they went, ‘we’re the big dogs’?. I’ll tell you what they do, Arsenal, they’re very good at winning little battles, they don’t win the war. It’s true, that’s exactly what Arsenal are.\n‘Man City… you’re talking about a guy who has scored 250 career league goals and Lewis-Skelly is sitting there doing that? Wind your neck in, come on, let’s have it right.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Peter Schmeichel reveals who deserves blame for ‘fantastic’ Man Utd star’s woeful form\nMORE: ‘He’s a monster!’ – David Luiz heaps praise on two Arsenal players\nMORE: Newcastle v Arsenal as it happened: Magpies cruise past Gunners to book place in Carabao Cup final",
