I saw their game against Chelsea. I was really impressed and I have started to review a little bit what they did to us in the game at Old Trafford,\" Guardiola said.\n\"As in the past, we have to be careful. I would be careful anyway but after Thursday and their games recently, we are going to prepare the best we can.\"\nDespite Guardiola's caution, Abu Dhabi-backed City have become English football's first dynasty since United's Ferguson era and have every reason to believe they will lift the FA Cup for the second time in the Spaniard's reign.\nCity, who thrashed United 6-3 in October, reeled off a blistering streak of 12 successive league victories to land a third consecutive title.\nLast weekend's 1-0 loss at Brentford, in which City fielded a weakened team, was their first defeat in 26 games in all competitions.\nInevitably, Erling Haaland will be City's key man at the end of a brilliant first season in England.\nThe Norway striker has scored 52 goals in all competitions, including a single-season record 36 in the Premier League.\nUnited are among Haaland's victims after he hit a hat-trick against them in October, but Ten Hag came up with a plan to hold him goalless in the rematch.\nThat was another notable achievement in an impressive first season for Ten Hag, who ended United's six-year trophy drought with a League Cup final victory against Newcastle in February.\nTen Hag is only the second manager in United's history to win a major trophy in his first season and adding City's scalp at Wembley would underline the vast improvement under the Dutchman.\nUnited, who finished third in the Premier League, are relishing the opportunity to ruin City's treble hopes, even without injured forward Anthony Martial.\nman united desperate to stop man city's treble march in unique fa cup final\nman city's pep guardiola named premier league manager of the year\n\"Of course, we know it's a big final, a special game. We've been the whole year fighting to be in that position to win titles. We will try absolutely everything to try to win,\" United keeper David De Gea said.",
