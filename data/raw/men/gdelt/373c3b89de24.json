  "body_text": "Chelsea 1-0 Pafos\nMOISES CAICEDO’S LATE goal gave Chelsea a vital 1-0 win against Cypriot minnows Pafos as the Blues moved closer to automatic qualification for the Champions League last 16.\nIn Liam Rosenior’s first Champions League game as Chelsea boss, Caicedo netted in the closing stages at Stamford Bridge to end Pafos’ stubborn resistance.\nChelsea’s fourth victory from seven Champions League group stage matches lifted them into eighth place.\nA win at Napoli in their final group game on 28 January would likely be enough to send Chelsea through to the last 16, depending on other results.\nThe Blues would face the unwanted stress of a play-off round if they finish outside the top eight.\nRosenior has won three times and lost once in his first four games since arriving from Strasbourg to replace Enzo Maresca, who left Stamford Bridge after mounting tensions with the club’s hierarchy.\nIt was far from plain sailing for Rosenior as Chelsea struggled to find a way past inspired Pafos keeper Jay Gorter before Caicedo made the breakthrough.\nOptimistic Chelsea fans have noted their two Champions League triumphs in 2012 and 2021 came after they changed manager in mid-season.\nBut there is a long way to go before Rosenior can hope to emulate those iconic victories masterminded by Roberto Di Matteo and Thomas Tuchel.\nChelsea have been steady rather than eye-catching so far under Rosenior, with far sterner tests lying in wait in the surprise choice to replace Maresca.\nRosenior made six changes from the 2-0 win over Brentford on Saturday, with injured England forward Cole Palmer absent due to a slight strain.\nBrazilian veteran David Luiz, a 2012 Champions League winner with Chelsea, was on the bench for Pafos, who were far from overawed in their first ever match against English opposition.\nChelsea laboured for long periods and even when Enzo Fernandez had the ball in the net in the 18th minute, the midfielder’s close-range header was disallowed for a push.\nChelsea nearly gifted Pafos a shock opener when a wayward back-pass to Filip Jorgensen was almost intercepted by Anderson Silva, but the Blues keeper chested the ball away from danger.\nRosenior’s men had lost their momentum and Pafos went close when Jaja’s shot from just inside the area took a wicked deflection off Reece James and hit the post with Jorgensen rooted to the spot.\nThat near-miss served as a wake-up call and Caicedo’s blast was pushed away by Gorter before Benoit Badiashile glanced a header narrowly wide moments later.\nCaicedo’s long-range drive forced another good stop from Gorter, who also repelled Jorrel Hato’s fierce strike just before half-time.\nFrustration was mounting among Chelsea supporters and Rosenior made a double change at the break, sending on Robert Sanchez for Jorgensen and Estevao Willian for James.\nEstevao nearly made an instant impact with a stinging volley that Gorter saved at full stretch.\nGorter was enjoying the game of his life and he denied Pedro Neto and Caicedo with two more fine saves.\nTo Rosenior’s immense relief, Chelsea finally found a way past Gorter in the 78th minute.\nPafos couldn’t clear a corner and Caicedo arrived to flick his header into the far corner from close range.\nBayern Munich 2-0 Union Saint-Gilloise\nHarry Kane scored twice in three second-half minutes as Bayern Munich saw off Union Saint-Gilloise 2-0 to reach the last 16.\nBayern joined Arsenal in sealing a top-eight finish in the 36-team table with a game to spare, avoiding a potential two-legged knockout play-off round.\nKane headed in from a corner before winning and converting a penalty to put the hosts firmly in control.\nThe England captain had a chance for a hat-trick but missed a late spot-kick, after Bayern centre-back Kim Min-jae had been dismissed for a second yellow card.\nBayern’s Champions League defeat at Arsenal remains their only loss in all competitions this season, in which they have also already opened up an 11-point lead in the Bundesliga.\nKane’s second goal was his 34th of the campaign, bringing Bayern’s total tally to 103 strikes from 29 games.\nSlavia Prague 2-4 Barcelona\nFermin Lopez’s first-half brace and second-half goals by Dani Olmo and Robert Lewandowski earned Barcelona a 4-2 win at Slavia Prague.\nThe result keeps Barca in contention for a top-eight finish in the league phase, which guarantees direct passage to the last 16.\nThe Catalans face FC Copenhagen at home in their final league phase game next week.\nBarca got back to winning ways on a freezing night in Prague after Sunday’s La Liga loss at San Sebastian ended a run of 11 successive victories.\nTonight’s Champions League results\nGalatasaray (TUR) 1 (Llorente 20-og) Atletico Madrid (ESP) 1
