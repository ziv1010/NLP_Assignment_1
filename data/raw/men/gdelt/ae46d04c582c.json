  "body_text": "MADRID, April 11 (Xinhua) -- FC Barcelona coach Hansi Flick on Friday declined to rule out signing a contract extension when he faced the press ahead of Saturday's La Liga match away to Leganes.\nBarca travels to the south of Madrid after virtually securing its place in the semifinals of the Champions League with a 4-0 win at home against Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of Wednesday's quarterfinal. The team also leads La Liga by three points ahead of Real Madrid.\nFlick's side has been playing excellent football despite the financial constraints imposed by La Liga's financial fair-play regulations. This has led to calls for the club to extend the German coach's deal beyond its current expiry date of June 2026.\n\"I truly appreciate and enjoy what I have here, with a magnificent staff and fantastic experts and doctors. The players are very professional, and they have the mentality to improve day by day; it's unique in my professional career,\" said Flick when asked about his future.\n\"I enjoy Barcelona and its people. I have a lot of energy, and I'm thinking about what I can do to improve, but now we're just starting the project. I'm not a coach who thinks about the next three years,\" he continued, adding that he has \"one year left, and if things go well, another. That's my way of thinking. Step by step, year by year.\"\n\"I don't know how much time we'll have left, but I want to finish my work here on a high note,\" Flick concluded.\nThe coach provided little information about the team he is likely to field on Saturday, given the less than 72 hours of recovery time since Wednesday's game. However, he confirmed that Dani Olmo had returned to full training after his recent muscle injury, and that he would make some squad rotations against a Leganes team that won in Barcelona earlier this season.\n\"We have to realize that we have to make changes because there are a lot of matches, and it's important to give the players some rest now and then,\" Flick commented. ■",
