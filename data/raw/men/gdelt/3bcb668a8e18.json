The likes of Ruben Amorim from Sporting CP, Brighton’s Roberto De Zerbi and German national team boss Julian Nagelsmann are all said to have been in the running, but the new favourite is Arne Slot from Feyenoord.\nWhoever assumes the Anfield hot seat from Klopp, though, the list of key tasks they will face as soon as they are appointed will remain the same. Here are five things that will be at the top of the next Liverpool manager’s to-do list.\nBackroom balance\nDutch coach Pep Lijnders has been a key figure in Liverpool’s success under Klopp in recent seasons, with the Dutchman lauded for his tactical and developmental work on the pitches of the club’s training ground in Kirkby.\nLijnders was originally hired by Klopp’s predecessor, Brendan Rodgers, in 2014, but stayed on to work under the German. And, but for a brief departure for a short stint as manager of NEC in his homeland in 2018, he has remained an influential presence ever since.\nBut Lijnders – along with fellow assistant Peter Krawietz and development coach Vitor Matos – will leave the club with Klopp at the end of the season.\nIt will be crucial for the club’s new manager to stock his backroom staff with a core of equally talented and trustworthy confidants.\nSort the superstar contracts\nOne of the biggest uncertainties lingering over Liverpool beside Klopp’s imminent exit is the fact that three of the Reds’ best players – Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold – will be entering the final year of their respective contracts next season.\nIn conjunction with Michael Edwards, who had returned to the Anfield fold as CEO of Fenway Sports Group, and Richard Hughes, the club’s new sporting director appointed from Bournemouth, the incoming manager must work to convince his star players to recommit.\nSalah has been the subject of serious interest from the Saudi Pro League in the recent past and the Egyptian will surely be the subject of such courtship again this summer. He turns 32 in June, so a future without Salah is something the Liverpool hierarchy must begin to consider.\nBut for the right terms, the Reds would be delighted to keep hold of their record-breaking goal-scorer. Either way, a resolution must be found otherwise the issue of his impending free agency will hang over the 2024-25 season.\nIt’s a different story for Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold. The Dutch centre-back is in fact almost a year older than Salah, but the nature of his role means he conceivably has plenty of prime years ahead of him. And Alexander-Arnold is shining symbol of a local, academy-bred lad who has developed into a superstar at Anfield. Both must be retained.\nWho’s in and who’s out?\nAfter figuring out the future of his aforementioned stars, the next Liverpool manager will then be able to turn his attention to the fringe players within the squad he inherits.\nHe must evaluate veterans Thiago Alcantara, Joel Matip and goalkeeper Adrian – all out of contract at the end of the season, and so might already be gone – to decide whether their experience and influence is enough to keep them around despite age and injuries having seen them slide down the pecking order.\nThe new boss must also determine whether young players such as Harvey Elliott, Curtis Jones and Conor Bradley are ready to step up into key roles or whether to be more patient with their development and seek upgrades in the transfer market.\nIdentify areas to strengthen\nIt is only once the previous two tasks are ticked off the new manager’s to-do list that this one can comprehensively be addressed.\nAlongside Hughes and Edwards, the incoming coach will be required to fully evaluate the squad at his disposal and identify key areas of weakness that the transfer gurus can look to remedy.\nIt will be fascinating, too, to see the extent to which the new manager is backed in the transfer market. The size of the transfer budget will dictate how many areas Liverpool are able to strengthen and will give an indication of how much work the club’s hierarchy believes needs to be done to reshape the team as they enter their post-Klopp era.\nEstablish a fresh identity\nWhen Klopp took over at Anfield in 2015, he arrived with an well-established tactical philosophy. Two Bundesliga titles and a Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund were built on his ‘heavy metal football’. The term ‘gegenpressing’ entered the English football lexicon.\nKlopp quickly installed his approach to high-intensity counter-pressing and Liverpool caught the eye for the energy and directness of their play under the German coach.\nThe Reds evolved over time as Klopp tweaked his personnel and reshaped his approach in line with the demands of the Premier League and in an effort to compete with Manchester City at the top end of the table.\nWhoever replaces Klopp faces the conundrum of how quickly to try to implement their own vision on Merseyside.\nTrying to act too fast, to institute too many changes from a regime that has been immensely successful, could backfire if he does not first earn buy-in from his players. But change too little and the new boss will face accusations that he is timid, overawed by the task of replacing legend. It is a question of timing as much as a question of tactics.\nREAD MORE:\nNext Liverpool manager: Left-field options to replace Klopp including divisive former Man Utd boss",
