He’s been ill, and every time he’s been on the pitch so far with me, I think he’s been outstanding.\n‘But I feel if you watch that goal, what makes me so happy is all 11 men are back behind the ball. That’s why he gets the space.\n‘I don’t want to talk too much about individuals. I thought it was a top team performance away from home, from Joao Pedro pressing, Pedro Neto and Estevao from the front, the two midfield players, Andrey Santos tactically, and then the defenders had to defend really, really well.\n‘So yeah, Estevao, so happy with him, but so happy with the whole team.’\nAsked how he intends to protect the highly-promising but young Estevao, Rosenior added: ‘Firstly, off the pitch, I know his family are here with him.\n‘I know the club have worked really, really hard for him to settle. I also know that Andrey Santos and Joao Pedro have helped him especially settle into this country.\nChelsea's next five fixtures\nNapoli vs Chelsea – Wednesday 28th January (Champions League)\nChelsea vs West Ham – Saturday 31st January (Premier League)\nArsenal vs Chelsea – Tuesday 3rd February (Carabao Cup)\nWolves vs Chelsea – Saturday 7th February (Premier League)\nChelsea vs Leeds United – Tuesday 10th February (Premier League)\n‘In terms of on the pitch, with an 18-year-old with a talent like his, you have to manage his minutes.\n‘You have to manage the games that you think are the right moments for him to have an impact and I’ll keep doing that because I want him to have an outstanding season.\n‘I want him to have an outstanding career as well.’\nMore Trending\nRosenior has now won four of his first five games in charge of Chelsea, with the only real blip being a Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg defeat to Arsenal.\n‘It was very pleasing,’ Rosenior said of Chelsea’s win at Selhurst Park. ‘This is always a very difficult place to come.\n‘Crystal Palace are a very good team. I felt in terms of the game plan, the organisation, what the players gave for the last two days was outstanding.\n‘Frustrating not to have a clean sheet in the last 10 minutes and we will work on that but a lot of really pleasing signs.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Arsenal 2-3 Man Utd: Dorgu and Cunha screamers harm Gunners title charge\nMORE: Why Cole Palmer misses Chelsea’s Premier League trip to Crystal Palace\nMORE: Next Liverpool manager odds as pressure mounts on Arne Slot",
