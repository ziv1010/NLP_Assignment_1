  "body_text": "6 Leny Yoro alternatives Real Madrid should sign\n- Leny Yoro set to join Man Utd after traveling to England for medical\n- French defender was previously keen to join Real Madrid\n- Los Blancos could turn to other targets if move fails to materialise\nConvincing the world's brightest talents to move to Real Madrid is not a particularly difficult job.\nThe 15-time European champions need only point to their trophy cabinet and a list of their current squad members to persuade prospective players. At one point it seemed like those factors would prove too difficult for young Lille centre-back Leny Yoro to ignore.\nThe 18-year-old reportedly had his heart set on a move to the Santiago Bernabeu in the near future, but a deal has been surprisingly complicated up until this point. Madrid are somewhat dragging their feet in negotiations, leaving the door ajar for Manchester United to potentially hijack a transfer.\nWith stalwart Nacho Fernandez departing the Spanish capital, the La Liga champions must bolster their defence this summer. Even with the move for Yoro looking unlikely to materialise, there are plenty of exciting young centre-backs around at the moment.\nWilliam Saliba\nThere's probably only one club that could tempt William Saliba away from Arsenal right now and that's Real Madrid. It's not likely, but it's possible.\nIf Madrid are looking for a young, pacy and composed French centre-half, why not go for the finished product? Saliba showed once again why he is almost certainly the best defender in world football during Euro 2024, continuing his impressive Arsenal form at the tournament.\nHe is the centre-back of the next generation and few clubs have the finances or pulling power to sort a deal. Madrid do, even if the 23-year-old would cost significantly more than Yoro and more than any defender in football history.\nJust get Kylian Mbappe to have a word.\nJarrad Branthwaite\nEverton to Madrid is not a common career path. Well, Thomas Gravesen and Carlo Ancelotti aside. However, it could be the logical move for the Toffees' prized asset Jarrad Branthwaite.\n90min has already reported Madrid are one of several clubs interested in the 6'5 colossus, who has only just turned 22 years old. Off the back of an incredible campaign in a struggling Everton side, it's little surprise that the European champions have sat up and taken notice of the England international.\nWith an athletic frame, great defensive instincts and the ability to pick a pass, Branthwaite is among the next generation of elite defenders and Madrid certainly have the bank balance to make a deal happen.\nGoncalo Inacio\nYoro is not the only young centre-back who has been regularly linked with Madrid in recent times, with Sporting CP starlet Goncalo Inacio also interesting the Spanish giants. A left-footer, which is always desirable, the 22-year-old boasts an appetising release clause of just €60m.\nInacio was an essential member of Sporting's title-winning side last season, impressing as part of a back three. The youngster's dazzling displays earned him a spot at Euro 2024 with Portugal, albeit 41-year-old Pepe kept him out of the starting lineup.\nNegotiations would be simple and quality guaranteed. What's not to like?\nAlessandro Bastoni\nWhile slightly older than other names and seven years Yoro's senior, there are few centre-backs who can compare to the elegant Alessandro Bastoni. The under-appreciated Inter ace won the Scudetto last season, helping the Italian giants to the Champions League final the campaign prior.\nThe Euro 2020 winner has shown his versatility playing as part of a back three in Italy and, while not blessed with sensational pace or physicality, his impressive in-game intelligence sets him apart from many other defenders.\nHis price tag may put Madrid off, but he is certainly a player worth investing in.\nMarc Guehi\nEuro 2024 has only solidified Marc Guehi's place as one of Europe's most promising centre-halves. Another gem that Chelsea let slip through their fingers, the England star has quietly been building himself quite the reputation at Crystal Palace.\nThe press resistant and composed defender is already wanted by many of Europe's elite and Madrid know the benefits of splashing the cash on a talented young Englishman. With Antonio Rudiger as a partner, Guehi would be able to blossom even further at the Santiago Bernabeu.\nThe fact he is confident playing on the left-hand side of defence is an added bonus, especially given David Alaba's recent injury layoff.\nAntonio Silva\nBenfica's wonderkid factory has churned out another unbelievable talent in Antonio Silva. The 20-year-old centre-half already boasts almost a century of appearances for the Portuguese side and has represented Portugal's senior squad on 13 occasions - including twice at Euro 2024.\nWhile not the tallest centre-back at 6'1, Silva reads the game remarkably well for someone so young, with excellent anticipation. He's also ferocious in physical duels despite his slender frame, with his ability on the ball also setting him apart from many of his peers.\nIf Madrid want a centre-back for the next decade, Silva could be the perfect alternative.",
