Whilst their midfield was supplemented by the likes of Longstaff and Anton Stach during the summer window, the squad's current profile lacks a box-to-box ball-progressor like Willock.\nNewcastle are likely to be open to a sale given it would allow them to achieve their own transfer objectives, which includes the signing of up-and-coming Dutch youngster Kees Smit. The teenager is expected to leave AZ Alkmaar this month with a whole host of top European clubs chasing his signature.\nSmit is more likely to play at Newcastle than most of the other linked teams given Howe's frequent rotation in the middle of the park and the team's hectic schedule between now and the end of the season.\nThe Newcastle boss has also demonstrated he is more than willing to give opportunities to young players who demonstrate they are ready for regular senior involvement, such as Lewis Miley, who has impressed lately and recently won the club's Player of the Month award.\nWillock is unlikely to extend his Newcastle contract beyond next summer and therefore his market value will continue to dwindle as his deal nears expiry in June 2027.\nLeeds' position above the drop-zone may lead Elland Road chiefs to believe signing Willock this month, for what is likely to be a £20 million sum, is not a necessity, especially given this summer he will only have 12 months remaining on his deal.\nThese types of deals are those which the current Leeds transfer hierarchy have been astute at completing for relatively palatable fees.\nHaving signed in 2021 for a fee reportedly worth £25m, much of Willock's price tag will have by now been amortised over the length of his Newcastle contract. This means from an accounting perspective, any fee agreed above the £10m mark should see Newcastle book an accounting profit.\nWillock's closest confidante in the Newcastle dressing room, Will Osula, looks likeliest to depart St. James' Park this month with credible, longstanding interest from Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt.\nWillock is valued at €16m by Transfermarkt and in FourFourTwo's opinion, would be a smart addition for Leeds to make, whether it be this month or in the summer. The player is in his peak years, homegrown, has contributed to the uplift of a side that has gone from battling relegation to the Champions League over the past four seasons and offers something different to the current make-up of Leeds' midfield options.\nJoe joined FourFourTwo as senior digital writer in July 2025 after five years covering Leeds United in the Championship and Premier League.
