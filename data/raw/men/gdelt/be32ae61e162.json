And while the clubs will welcome the expansion, due to more opportunities to earn more money, some players certainly aren't happy with the decision taken by FIFA.\n“We were not consulted but we try to do our job,” Manchester City star Bernardo Silva said.\n“The reality is that the amount of games we have nowadays, and even more with the new competitions, it’s a bit crazy because of the lack of rest players get, and then the risk of injuries goes up quite a lot.\n“In my opinion, for people who love the game, if we have this many games for so long, in the end the games will lose the energy, will lose the intensity. I think it is a top competition so no complaints, but the amount of games and the [schedule] we have nowadays makes it complicated to be fit all the time and for our energy levels to be proper to play well.\nThe introduction of the Club World Cup will mean European players playing in the tournament won't have a summer off until 2027, due to Euro 2024 and World Cup 2026.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nSilva did recognise that elite-level players wanting to win the biggest honours in football will have no choice but to deal with the schedule, suggesting they're victims of their own success.\n“I am not going to lie, sometimes I feel tired,\" he admitted. \"We play every three days, we don’t rest. We have no Christmas, we have no summer.\n\"But that’s the price you pay for being at a top club and fighting for all competitions, and in the end our dream was to play at this level.”\nMore Manchester City stories\nRodri recently called for action to be taken to stop European football losing more stars to Saudi Arabia.\nPep Guardiola has discussed his future, teasing Juventus as a potential destination in the future.\nMeanwhile, Shaun Wright-Phillips has told FFT that his former club could go on to win 10 Premier League titles in a row.\nRyan is a staff writer for FourFourTwo, joining the team full-time in October 2022.
