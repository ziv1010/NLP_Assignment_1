Its unrivalled when it comes to unblocking streaming services, its security credentials are top of the table, and you can try it risk-free.\nWhere to watch the Premier League in the UK\nIn the UK, Premier League TV rights for the 2025/2026 season are shared between two broadcasters: Sky Sports, and TNT Sports. Amazon Prime has lost the rights it previously held. In a deal worth £6.7bn to the Premier League over the next few years, more games than ever will be broadcast, with at least 267 of the 380 fixtures to be shown live.\n► Sky Sports has broadcast English top flight matches since the Premier League’s inception in 1992, and it continues to air more live action than anyone else. The service will show at least 215 games over the course of the 2025/2026 season.\n► TNT Sports (formerly BT Sport) and its streaming platform Discovery+ have rights to 52 live Premier League matches in 2025/2026, including Saturday lunchtime kick-offs.\nWhy aren't all Premier League games live on TV in the UK?\nAlthough more Premier League games than ever are being shown live in the UK this season, the Saturday 3pm 'blackout' remains in place, which means that no games that kick off at that time can be broadcast live. This is enshrined in law and is designed to protect match-day attendances. For the first time, the 2025/2026 season will see all Premier League games not taking place at 3pm on a Saturday shown live on TV.\nHow to watch the Premier League on Sky Sports\nTo get Sky Sports you either need to arrange a TV package, either direct through Sky or another provider such as EE or Virgin. Or, for a more flexible and shorter-term, NowTV is Sky's streaming partner, with a day pass available for £14.99 or a monthly plan from £27.99.\nHow to watch the Premier League on TNT Sports and Discovery+\nAs with Sky, to get TNT Sports on your TV you're looking at a long-term TV package deal. However, TNT Sports comes with its own dedicated streaming platform, Discovery+, which costs £30.99 a month.\nMore: These are the cheapest ways to watch the Premier League this season\nWatch Premier League live streams in the US\nNBC Universal holds the Premier League broadcast rights in the US, splitting the coverage across various channels and platforms: NBC, USA Network, and Peacock.\n► NBC is the flagship cable TV channel, which hosts only the marquee fixtures.\n► Peacock is NBC's streaming platform which not only hosts a live stream of the NBC games but also exclusively shows a number of other games each week - roughly half of Premier League games.\n► USA Network is another cable TV channel that houses roughly the other half of the fixtures.\nWatch the Premier League on Peacock\nPeacock plans start from $10.99 a month, which nets you roughly half of all Premier League games each week. There are savings for annual plans, which start from $109.99 a year.\nWatch USA Network through Sling\nThere is no dedicated streaming platform for USA Network, but you can watch cable online thanks to the new wave of 'cord-cutting' streaming services. Sling Blue starts from $45.99 and gets you USA, plus NBC and CNBC.\nHow to watch the Premier League in Australia\nAussie soccer fans have it easy, and pretty cheap. Every single Premier League game is available to stream live on Stan Sport.\nThis marks a change from previous years, when Optus Sport held the rights, which have now been acquired by Nine Network amid the closure of Optus. Stan is a streaming service operated by Nine.\nThere is a small price rise but it's still great value – you get every Premier League game, plus the Champions League, FA Cup, and more, all for $32 a month.\nHow to watch the Premier League on Stan Sport\nNew customers need to sign up for a base Stan subscription ($12 a month) and then add the Stan Sport add-on ($20 a month), for a total outlay of $32 a month. If you were an Optus Sport customer, you can carry your previous subscription across and you should have already been contacted with details of your new plan.\nFull list of Premier League broadcasters globally\nEurope\n- Albania - Digitalb\n- Andorra - CANAL+/DAZN\n- Armenia - Saran Media\n- Austria - Sky Deutschland\n- Belarus - Saran Media\n- Belgium - Telenet\n- Croatia - Telekom Srbija\n- Cyprus - Cytavision\n- Czech Republic - CANAL+\n- Denmark - Viaplay\n- Estonia - TV3\n- Finland - Viaplay\n- France - CANAL+\n- Georgia - Saran Media\n- Germany - Sky Deutschland\n- Greece - IMG (sublicensed to Forthnet)\n- Hungary - TV2\n- Iceland - Syn\n- Israel - Charlton\n- Republic of Ireland (Eire) - Sky Sports, TNT Sports, Premier Sports\n- Italy - Sky Italia\n- Kosovo - Telekom Srbija\n- Latvia - TV3\n- Lithuania - TV3\n- Luxembourg - CANAL+\n- Malta - TSN\n- Moldova - Saran Media\n- Montenegro - Telekom Srbija\n- Netherlands - Viaplay\n- North Macedonia - Telekom Srbija\n- Norway - Viaplay\n- Poland - CANAL+\n- Romania - Saran Media\n- Portugal - Eleven\n- Serbia - Telekom Srbija\n- Slovakia - CANAL+\n- Slovenia - Telekom Srbija\n- Spain - DAZN\n- Sweden - Viaplay\n- Switzerland - CANAL+ (French-language), Sky Deutschland (German), Sky Italia\n- (Italian)\n- Turkey - beIN Sports\n- United Kingdom - Sky Sports, TNT Sports\n- Ukraine - Setanta\nAsia-Pacific\n- Afghanistan - Saran Media\n- Australia - Stan Sport\n- Azerbaijan - Saran Media\n- Bangladesh - JioStar\n- Bhutan - JioStar\n- Cambodia - Jasmine International\n- China - Migu\n- Chinese Taipei - ELTA\n- Hong Kong - PCCW\n- India - JioStar\n- Indonesia - EMTEK\n- Japan - U-Next\n- Kazakhstan - Saran Media\n- Kyrgyzstan - Saran Media\n- Laos - Jasmine International\n- Malaysia - Astro\n- Mongolia - Unitel\n- Myanmar - CANAL+\n- Nepal - JioStar\n- New Zealand - Sky NZ\n- Pacific Islands - Digicel\n- Pakistan - JioStar\n- Singapore - StarHub\n- South Korea - Coupang\n- Sri Lanka - JioStar\n- Tajikistan - Saran Media\n- Thailand - Jasmine International\n- Turkmenistan - Saran Media\n- Uzbekistan - Saran Media\n- Vietnam - K+\nMiddle East and North Africa (MENA) and Africa\n- Middle East and North Africa - beIN Sports\nAmericas\n- Brazil - ESPN\n- Canada - Fubo\n- Caribbean - ESPN\n- Costa Rica - Fox Broadcasting Corporation, TNT Sports Mexico\n- El Salvador - Fox Broadcasting Corporation, TNT Sports Mexico\n- Guatemala - Fox Broadcasting Corporation, TNT Sports Mexico\n- Honduras - Fox Broadcasting Corporation, TNT Sports Mexico\n- Mexico - Fox Broadcasting Corporation, TNT Sports Mexico\n- Nicaragua - Fox Broadcasting Corporation, TNT Sports Mexico\n- Panama - Fox Broadcasting Corporation, TNT Sports Mexico\n- South America - ESPN\n- United States - NBC Sports\nFull TV Calendar\nWe recommend VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses.
