  "body_text": "Sport\nUCL: Shearer names favourites to win trophy ahead of Arsenal, PSG\nFormer Newcastle United striker, Alan Shearer, has named Barcelona as favourites to win this year’s UEFA Champions League.\nShearer stated this while giving an analysis on The Rest is Football podcast.\nAccording to him, Hansi Flick’s men have everything to win the competition.\nBarca travel to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday, with a massive 4-0 advantage from the first leg of the quarter-final last week.\nWith the LaLiga side all but through to the last four, Shearer is expecting them to go all the way and win the trophy.\n“I would put Barcelona favourites. I think they’re still the favourites after that victory (over Dortmund), they were so impressive. They’re favourites for me.\n“PSG look strong too. I remember watching them at Arsenal in September in the group stage and they looked average, they really did.\n“Arsenal battered them really and looked so comfortable. For PSG to go from that to the form they’re showing now is outstanding,” Shearer said.",
