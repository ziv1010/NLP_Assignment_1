The winger has a release clause in his contract, understood to be ‘between €60m (£50.6m) and €80m (£67.5m) ‘.\nHowever, Bayern Munich are also ‘interested in a transfer for Williams’ and could therefore compete with Arsenal for his signature this summer.\nThe Gunners are attempting to get ahead of the competition by speaking to Williams’ agents now, which suggests they are willing to match his release clause.\nREAD MORE: Arsenal linked with wantaway Liverpool striker as outrageous report reveals Arteta plan\nArsenal keen to sign new winger this summer\nTEAMtalk contributor Ben Jacobs revealed Arsenal’s interest in Nico Williams back in December, naming him alongside Wolves’ Matheus Cunha as a top target for the summer.\nEven prior to Bukayo Saka’s injury, the Gunners had identified the winger position as an area they wanted to strengthen.\nThe left side is seen as less of a priority than the right, although youngster Ethan Nwaneri has made a bold claim for first team minutes with his performances this term.\nArsenal have the likes of Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli who can play on the left, but sources have reiterated that Arsenal remain very interested in Williams.\nWith a price tag of between £50m and £67.5m, it’s likely that Williams will be available for cheaper than Cunha. However, it also means that multiple clubs will likely bid for him in the summer.\nAlong with Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Chelsea and Tottenham have all been linked with Williams in recent weeks. The fact that Arsenal can offer Champions League football could play a role in negotiations.\nWith Williams’ entourage in early talks with Arsenal, it’ll be interesting to see if any of his other suitors initiate a dialogue ahead of the summer window.\nWilliams had interest from clubs last summer and in January, too, but said he opted to stay in Bilbao because of the ‘heart’ and ‘atmosphere’ of Athletic.\n“This relationship we have at the heart of the club is incredible. This atmosphere, I’ll never have it anywhere else. I decided to stay because of that. I took the decision I thought was the right one,” Williams said earlier this month.\nLatest Arsenal news\n🔴 Huge first Berta signing at Arsenal nearly complete, but second big deal NOT happening\n🔴 Arsenal snubbed as high profile transfer target favours signing different deal\n🔴 Arsenal stick mammoth price tag on ‘exceptional’ full-back as Real Madrid consider shock approach\n🔴 ‘Not world class’ Mikel Arteta slammed over use of Arsenal summer signing\nArsenal quiz: Leavers with most appearances per window",
