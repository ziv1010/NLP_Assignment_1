  "body_text": "Arsenal have won each of their last eight meetings with Wolverhampton Wanderers, despite claiming victory from only one of the previous six beforehand.\nThe Gunners' longest sequence in this fixture is a streak of 12 victories between 1983 and 2011.\nArsenal vs Wolves preview\nOnly four times in Premier League history has the team bottom of the table beaten the team top. Oldham beat Manchester United in 1993 and Spurs defeated Liverpool in 2008, while the other two both involve Wolves, upsetting the odds against Manchester United in 2004 and 2011, albeit the basement boys have never achieved this away from home, so will we witness history on Saturday?\nWell, Arsenal supporters certainly hope not, looking to reestablish momentum after a difficult period. Last weekend, the Gunners' 18-match unbeaten streak across all competitions came to an end, beaten 2-1 at Villa Park. When Leandro Trossard equalised shortly after half time, the visitors appeared more likely to go on and claim victory, but it was Aston Villa who snatched the points with literally the last kick off the game. Having yielded just two points from their last three away matches, held to draws by Sunderland and Chelsea, the Gunners' lead has been slashed to just two points.\nNevertheless, on Wednesday night, Mikel Arteta's team did get back to winning ways, swatting aside Club Brugge 3-0 at Jan Breydelstadion. Noni Madueke scored twice, the first an absolute rocket in off the crossbar, before Gabriel Martinelli's curler made the points secure. This maintains their perfect record in the Champions League, needing just one more win against either Inter or Kairat in January to rubber stamp a top two finish. Back in the Premier League, the Gunners have accumulated 19 points out of a possible 21 at home so far this season, and can ill-afford a slip-up here.\nWell, Wolverhampton Wanderers arrive in North London having hit rock-bottom, well at least they hope so. On Monday night, the Old Gold were smashed 4-1 by Manchester United at a mutinous Molineux, actually equalising in first half stoppage time through Jean-Ricner Bellegarde, but their defending all night was frenetic, disorganised and kamikaze to say the least.\nThis means Rob Edwards has lost all four matches since ditching Middlesbrough for Wolves, with Bellegarde's goal the club's first in over nine hours of play. Overall, Wolves have only two points on the board after 15 matches, the joint-worst start any club has made in the 137 year history of league football in England. The Old Gold have also lost eight on the spin, winless in 19 Premier League matches in total, so to say they appeared doomed for relegation would be an understatement. Now, come Saturday night, can they pull off one of the biggest upsets in Premier League history?\nArsenal vs Wolverhampton Wanderers head-to-head record\n- Matches Played: 126.\n- Arsenal Wins: 66. Draws: 28. Wolverhampton Wanderers Wins: 32.\nArsenal team news\nRiccardo Calafiori's yellow card at Villa Park means he is suspended, while Cristhian Mosquera, Gabriel, Max Dowman and Kai Havertz remain sidelined for certain.\nMeantime, William Saliba remains a doubt, as are Jurriën Timber, Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, after none of the quartet traveled to Belgium in mid-week.\nDue to limited defensive options, Christian Nørgaard filled in at centre-back in Brugge, with 16 year old Marli Salmon introduced off the bench for his debut late on.\nIn better news, Gabriel Jesus also came on at Jan Breydelstadion, his first appearance since rupturing his ACL on 12 January, and the Brazilian looked sharp, so will he feature again?\nArsenal predicted lineup vs Wolverhampton Wanderers: (4-3-3): Raya, White, Timber, Hincapié, Lewis-Skelly; Zubimendi, Rice, Ødegaard; Saka, Madueke, Gyökeres.\nArsenal player to watch vs Wolves\nBukayo Saka has seven goals to his name this season, while his first-ever Premier League goal came at Molineux. More recently, he's bagged three goals in his last four meetings with Wolves, so will he find the net come Saturday night?\nWolves team news\nJoão Gomes can return, having served his one-match suspension against Manchester United, so will rekinle his midfield partnership alongside André, with Ladislav Krejčí likely to drop out.\nRodrigo Gomes, Marshall Munetsi and Matt Doherty are sidelined, as is Monday's scorer Jean-Ricner Bellegarde, sidelined for six weeks after sustaining a calf issue in that one. The aforementioned André and Yerson Mosquera will miss next weekend's clash with Brentford if booked.\nWolverhampton Wanderers predicted lineup vs Arsenal: (5-3-2): Johnstone; Tchatchoua, Mosquera, Agbadou, Toti, Møller Wolfe; André, João Gomes, Munetsi; Arokodare, Strand Larsen.\nWolves player to watch vs Arsenal\nSam Johnstone has saved 37 of the 57 shots on target he has faced in the Premier League this season, and he should be prepared for many more busy nights work throughout the campaign.\nArsenal vs Wolverhampton Wanderers prediction\nThis is not a bold take, but we cannot foresee any scenario in which the division's bottom side trouble the league-leaders, backing Arsenal to cruise to victory: Arsenal 4-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nArsenal vs Wolverhampton Wanderers FAQs - Premier League\nHow to watch Arsenal vs Wolves in the Premier League on TV channel?\nArsenal vs Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League will be available on the following TV channels;\n- UK: TNT Sports 1 & Ultimate.\n- USA: fuboTV, NBC, Telemundo & Deportes En Vivo\n- Canada: Fubo Sports Network Canada\nHow to watch Arsenal vs Wolves in the Premier League on live streaming?\nArsenal vs Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League will be available on the following streaming services;\n- UK: Discovery+\n- USA: fuboTV, nbcsports.com, USA Network & Telemundo\n- Canada: fuboTV Canada\nWhat is the date and kick-off time for Arsenal vs Wolves in the Premier League?\nArsenal vs Wolverhampton Wanderers takes place on Saturday 13 December 2025, with kick off at 20:00 (GMT), 15:00 (ET) & 12:00 (PT).",
