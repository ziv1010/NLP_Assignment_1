His consistent performances have earned him a reputation as a reliable shot-stopper.\nAl Merrikh has been without competitive action since September 2023, when they lost 3-0 on aggregate to the Young Africans in the CAF Champions League.\nThe addition of Olorunleke is seen as a significant reinforcement as they look to rebuild and kickstart their competitive games.\nOlorunleke’s move is expected to bring stability and experience to the Al Merrikh defense, and fans are eager to see him in action as the club aims to return to form.",
