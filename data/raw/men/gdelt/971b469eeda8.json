  "body_text": "Jurgen Klopp has revealed his favourite Liverpool moments and how he would scrap VAR in its current form in a final press conference before his last game as manager.\nAs the club's fans prepare for Klopp last hurrah, the 56-year-old also revealed that there is one player he doesn't like – Tottenham Hotspur's James Maddison.\nKlopp also described his final days in charge as the 'most intense week of my life' and said he had enjoyed two barbecues with players and staff in the past 48 hours.\nHis long goodbye to the red half of the city started at the end of January with the shock news he had chosen to end his time at the club and it will culminate in an emotional farewell at Anfield against Wolves on Sunday from 4pm.\nKlopp is expected to retire to Mallorca where he is demolishing and rebuilding a £3.4million mansion to create an 'ecological family paradise' with his wife Ulla.\nHe spoke at a press conference today before his final match on Sunday, following a barbecue with his players yesterday and another with team staff on Wednesday.\nKlopp described the 'most intense week of my life', adding: 'Great moments already, we don't have to pretend it's a normal week because it isn't. I'm a very pragmatic person I have been saying it's last game and then holidays, business as usual.\nJurgen Klopp spoke about his final days in charge of Liverpool at a press conference today\nEmily Farley shouts at a passer-by as she decorates her house in Liverpool yesterday\nJurgen Klopp and wife Ulla at the James Milner Foundation charity ball in Manchester in 2016\nKlopp is expected to retire to Mallorca where he is demolishing and rebuilding a mansion\nThe departing Liverpool manager purchased the villa in Mallorca for £3.4million back in 2022\n'We had a barbecue here yesterday with the players. The day before with the staff from Chapel Street. It's a lot. Saying goodbye is never nice. But saying goodbye without feeling sad would mean the time we spent together wasn't great.'\nKlopp also spoke about some of his favourite moments during his time in the Liverpool dugout as follows:\n- Most spectacular moment: The 4-0 comeback win against Barcelona in the 2019 Champions League semi-finals.\n- Best goal: Goalkeeper Alisson's header at West Bromwich Albion in May 2021 to keep Liverpool in hunt for Champions League football.\n- Best save: Alisson's last-minute stop against Napoli at Anfield to deny Arkadiusz Krystian Milik in the 2018-19 Champions League group stage. It ensured the Reds qualified for the last 16, and they went on to win the tournament.\n- Best backheel goal: Sadio Mane against Watford in 2019.\nAlso during today's press conference, Klopp also admitted he would vote for scrapping VAR because the officials in charge of it 'are not able to use it properly'.\nA mural of former Liverpool managers including Klopp on a house in Liverpool yesterday\nA billboard outside Anfield yesterday before Jurgen Klopp's final match as Liverpool manager\nA person takes a picture of a Klopp mural yesterday ahead of his last match as Liverpool boss\nWolves submitted a resolution on Wednesday calling for a vote by Premier League clubs to scrap the system at the league's annual general meeting.\nWhile Liverpool's hierarchy are not understood to be supportive of scrapping it, Klopp believes if it is not applied correctly then it is not worth keeping.\n'I don't think they're voting against VAR, I think they'll vote about how it gets used, because that's definitely not right. I understand that,' he said. 'In the way they do it, I would vote against it, because these people are not able to use it properly.\n'I do not think VAR is the problem but the way we use it is the problem. So, you cannot change the people obviously, it's clear. You need them. So yeah, I would vote for scrapping VAR.'\nKlopp also revealed that he 'doesn't like James Maddison' because of one key reason that he believes cost Liverpool the Premier League title in 2019.\nLiverpool and Klopp's long-term managerial rival Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola were going neck-and-neck for the top-flight crown five years ago when Vincent Kompany scored arguably the greatest goal of his career to ruin the Reds' hopes.\nEmily Farley decorates her house in Liverpool yesterday before Klopp's final match\nA drone view shows a mural of Klopp on the side of a house near Anfield yesterday\nPosters in a window in Liverpool yesterday before Klopp's final match as manager\nKompany stunned the Etihad - and Liverpool - when he scored the winning goal against Leicester with a long-range strike into the top corner to essentially hand Guardiola a second Premier League title.\nCity went on to beat Liverpool to the league trophy by a single point and Klopp evidently still holds a grudge over Maddison after he failed to stop Kompany getting a shot on goal.\nKlopp explained his feelings about Maddison, who now plays for Tottenham, by telling Redmen TV: 'The moment when Vincent Kompany touched the ball there, I am really happy I didn't get a stroke in that moment as that's how it must feel.\n'I remember exactly how I was lying on the sofa watching and thinking 'Maddison block him, close him down'. Since then I don't like Maddison. I was angry with Brendan [Rodgers] that day because he should have taken him off, he was tired.\n'Leicester played really good first half, after that they should have scored. It's just a personal thing, I have no problem with him, but when I see him it's... and now I saw him again last weekend.'\nA drone view shows a mural of Klopp on the side of a house near Anfield yesterday\nEmily Farley decorates her house in Liverpool yesterday before Klopp's final match\nKlopp has spent more than eight years as Liverpool manager since being appointed in October 2015 - and his successor is expected to be Feyenoord's Arne Slot.\nThe German has overseen tremendous success over that period, winning a Premier League title, a FA Cup, two Carabao Cups, a Champions League win and a Club World Cup.\nHowever, Klopp said today: 'I know we could have won more. But I'm fine. We could have won less.'\nHe added: 'It's nearly a decade of my life and super influential. I love everything about this place. I take fantastic memories with me, friendships, relationships, forever.\n'The older you get, when time slips through fingers, you go 'my God, that was quick'. I don't feel it was quick. I really think it was the absolute opposite of a waste of time.\n'We tried to use everything and enjoy it as much as possible. A decade is a long time but I will not forget a day in that time, I met the best people I ever met and for the best club I could have imagined.'\nKlopp continued: 'I did this in a special city. The people, how they treat you when they meet you and how they describe me is the people of Liverpool. I got the keys to the city and for me it feels like responsibility. If the city needs me I am there in future.'\nSpeaking about Anfield, he described it as a 'super, super special place because of the people', adding: 'It's a nice stadium but the people make it exceptional.'\nWhile Liverpool's players may have already gone through various stages of the grieving process relating to Klopp's departure, a leading sports psychologist in the city said there is still some way to go for fans.\nThere will undoubtedly be tears at the loss of a beloved manager but Dr Gillian Cook, a senior lecturer in sport and performance psychology at Liverpool John Moores University, believes Klopp's squad will already be a long way through the process.\nHowever he said it will be different for fans, who have embraced the journey Klopp took them on and, in many cases, enjoyed that more than the actual winning of trophies - Klopp's last with the club coming in February's Carabao Cup final, a month after his announcement.\nKlopp instantly struck a chord with supporters and has won their hearts more than any other Liverpool manager since Bill Shankly.\nDr Cook said: 'Emotion is very much linked to memory so we remember the big highs and lows and that is very much what Klopp has brought over the last nine seasons with a huge amount of bonding experiences.\n'Grief is the word I would use to describe the process of what fans are going through; all the outpouring of emotion on social media. He very much connected with the fans and they are losing him so it is grief.\n'There will be disappointment at the way the season has ended up because I think fans would have wanted to send him off in good fashion with (another) trophy.\n'The season has petered out so that won't happen but I anticipate seeing cameras panning in on people in the crowd crying at the end of 90 minutes because there will be that profound sense of loss and then wondering what happens next.'\nDuring today's press conference, Klopp also admitted he would vote for scrapping VAR because the officials in charge of it 'are not able to use it properly'.\nA mural of former Liverpool managers including Klopp on a house in Liverpool yesterday\nPeople drink yesterday inside Jurgen's, a bar in Liverpool city centre, before his final match\nEmily Farley decorates her house in Liverpool yesterday before Klopp's final match\nWolves submitted a resolution on Wednesday calling for a vote by Premier League clubs to scrap the system at the league's annual general meeting.\nWhile Liverpool's hierarchy are not understood to be supportive of scrapping it, Klopp believes if it is not applied correctly then it is not worth keeping.\n'I don't think they're voting against VAR, I think they'll vote about how it gets used, because that's definitely not right.

So, you cannot change the people obviously, it's clear. You need them. So yeah, I would vote for scrapping VAR.'\nAlso today, Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk admitted he would be forever grateful to 'icon' Klopp for helping shape his successful career.\nPeople hold a replica of the European Cup in Jurgen's, a bar in Liverpool city centre, yesterday\nA poster in a window in The Park pub in Liverpool yesterday before Klopp's final match\nEmily Farley decorates her house in Liverpool yesterday before Klopp's final match\nA person stands in the doorway of a bar in Liverpool city centre called Jurgen's yesterday\nThe Netherlands international was singled out by Klopp as the man he wanted to build his defence around in the summer of 2017 but, after a bungled transfer bid which eventually cost the club an additional £10million as he became the world's most expensive defender for £75million, he eventually joined six months later.\nThe fact Klopp did not immediately move on to another target and was prepared to wait has never been forgotten by the Dutchman.\n'Obviously he means a lot to me. He is one of the reasons I wanted to join the club,' Van Dijk said. 'He is a special character definitely. He is an icon.\n'He wanted me and me only, he felt I was a big part of the success that could happen and I could definitely contribute to that. I am glad that it all went well.\n'The club is one of the big reasons but it was the whole package and the manager has been great.'\nVan Dijk added: 'He has been a big part of my success and in my career and I will be forever grateful for that.'\nFormer winger John Barnes believes Klopp's influence can only be compared with the man who began the club's revolution in late 1959.\nPeople drink yesterday inside Jurgen's, a bar in Liverpool city centre, before his final match\nA person sells flags from his car yesterday before before Klopp's final match as Liverpool boss\nA billboard celebrating Klopp at the Albert Dock in Liverpool, pictured yesterday\n'For me Bill Shankly and Jurgen are the two greatest managers Liverpool have had,' he said.\n'Because it is always harder to start something than continue it and Jurgen had to restart in terms of where we were to put us back to where we are.\n'From where we where to what he has done, taking us right back up to the top alongside Manchester City, that for me is the legacy, bringing Liverpool back to where they belong.\n'A manager coming after is coming at a better time than when Jurgen came in, with a better team than when Jurgen came and with a chance of continuing Jurgen's legacy.'\nBarnes' former team-mate Jan Molby believes Klopp's biggest contribution will be remembered not for the trophies which were won but the journey he took fans on.\n'People are very quick trying to compare Klopp to some of the biggest managers in Liverpool's history,' said the former Denmark international.\nGraffiti on boards in Liverpool yesterday before Klopp's final match as the club's manager\nA person walks past a decorated house yesterday before Klopp's final match as Liverpool boss\nPeople walk past a poster of Klopp yesterday before his final match as Liverpool manager\nStickers on a lamp post in Liverpool yesterday before Klopp's final match as the club's boss\n'You can only compare on trophies and in that respect he doesn't come out very well because they won a lot more.\n'In years to come we will remember Klopp for the man he was and the impact he had, not that he won the Premier League and the Champions League, because we had managers who have outdone him on that front.\n'We can all see what he has done as a football manager so I think it will be more of his human traits than just basically winning trophies.\n'His legacy is almost as big behind the scenes for the local community. I think Klopp will come out of this with a lot of people having individual stories about Klopp and the impact he has had on their lives.'\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured",
