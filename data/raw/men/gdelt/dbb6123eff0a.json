  "body_text": "Talented Napoli super star, Victor Osimhen and his Napoli teammates are ready to play against La Liga champions, Barcelona in the Champions League round of 16.\nThis development comes after the draw was made on Monday in Nyon at the House of European Football.\nAt the draw, the 16 teams were finalised last week as group winners were drawn against group runners-up.\nWith eight points behind Real Madrid, who had a 100 percent record in the group stage, Napoli finished second in Group C with 10 points.\nBefore the draws, the Serie A champions were likely to face either Arsenal, Atlético de Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Manchester City or Real Sociedad.\nInterestingly, the Partenopei have an advantage to grab as Barca are without a win in their last three games.\nOn the other end, Napoli has also not recovered from the exit of former manager, Luciano Spaletti who took the team through their Serie A title in 2022/23. At the moment, the team is still missing his charismatic presence and tactical acumen.\nNapoli currently sits on the fifth position in the Serie A. The team which has talents like Osimhen, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Matteo Politano in the attack, is hopeful of beating the Spanish side to secure a place in the next round of the competition.",
