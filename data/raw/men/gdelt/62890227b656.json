I seem to remember us when we were in the bottom six when I first came to the club we set about Nottingham Forest and ran all over them, we did the same to Crystal Palace, we did the same to Leicester.\n“We’re having to live up to a reputation so I think teams are steeling themselves for that and they’re getting something better out of their teams, but our first half performance wasn’t what I would have expected from us.”\nMcCarthy felt some of his players might have been feeling the effects of matches having come thick and fast: “Maybe one or two of them are knackered, Murph’s played every minute of every game just about.\n“Noel Hunt came in and was brilliant last weekend. We start from the front and he’d not played a lot of football.\n“I’m not making excuses for them because I don’t have to. There have been one or two who have been missing through illness and injury.\n“I thought Skusey was outstanding to come back after nine days [out ill]. But you only have to be down a couple of per cent and they’re up a couple of per cent because they’re playing us and it makes it a difficult evening.”\nMcCarthy said Brighton would be no easy touch beforehand despite starting the evening in 20th - they have climbed one place - and that proved to be the case with Albion looking a much better side than their current position.\n“That’s because I know Chris and I know what he’s about and I know how good he is as a coach and a manager,” he added.\n“I think wherever he’s been he’s done a great job. I know there’ll be Norwich fans screaming at me but I seem to remember they were still in the Premier League when he was sacked.\n“He’s been everywhere, he’s experienced. He was at Tottenham for a long time. I’m a bit annoyed with him tonight, but he’s a great guy, he’s a mate of mine.”\nThe Town boss didn’t feel the chance to go top of the table following Bournemouth’s defeat last night had any effect on his players.\n“I don’t think so,” he insisted. “The lads were really focused and I think we have to give them a bit of credit rather than me taking [it away from them and giving my team criticism].\n“When was it easy coming to Brighton? I know they’ve not had the best record lately, but we always put their team up on a sheet of paper and I can’t think for one minute that any of us looked at it and thought it was going to be easy with the team that was playing.\n“I thought they played well in the first half. I’m not happy with the goals we conceded, we didn’t do as well as we should have done, it wasn’t like us.”\nMidfielder Paul Anderson apologised for his performance on Twitter afterwards but McCarthy says the 26-year-old has done well this season even if this evening wasn’t his night.\n“He came in and apologised at half-time,” he continued. “I don’t really want apologies I just want people to perform.\n“But Ando’s been great, maybe it was one of those nights. It happens, I didn’t play well every week. Most weeks, but not every week.”\nWith the Blues not in action until a week on Saturday when Wigan visit Portman Road, McCarthy is giving his players some time off: “They’re all off until Monday. Have a break, chill out with their families, go away if they can, have a beer with their mates, I’m not bothered.\n“They work exceptionally hard. Just recover and we’ll prepare for Wigan next week, starting on Monday.”\nBrighton manager Chris Hughton was pleased with his side's first home league victory since he took charge: “I’m delighted. Of course I’m more delighted with the three points because we needed it.\n“I thought we showed some good signs in Saturday’s performance and I’m also delighted with the performance.\n“We were up against a very, very good side who have shown why they are where they are in this division.\n“They’re a tough team to play against. They had direct spells where they do what they do very well so we had to deal with a fair amount, but I thought we showed a lot of quality on the ball and, of course, you can’t do all of that unless you get the goals that we got.\n“I’m delighted for Sam Baldock because he’s somebody who has been used to putting the ball in the back of the net and I thought Joao Teixeira was excellent.”\nAsked whether he was pleased to get one over on his old Republic of Ireland team-mate, he added: “No, not really. Mick’s somebody I know very well and I have a lot of respect for, and also Terry as well.\n“I’m more delighted with the three points because you are. You look at the result last night and you see Leeds winning.\n“That’s what happens when you’re in the position you’re in, you’re looking at all the results around you, so I’m most delighted with the three points but also I thought the performance was good, particularly here at home, which is always nice.”\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nAnyway, shame about tonight, but a point off top and 4 defeats with less than half a season to go! Unbelieveable. Out position is only important in May.\nWhen I think where we were last season, this one has exceeded all our expectations I'm sure, I still think we are a few years away from being Premiership ready but confident we will finish in the top 6 this season.\nDespite tonights result I am proud of what Mick and the lads have done thus far, lets aim to keep the tractor rolling and keep our heads up because the attitude of the fans rubs off on the players. COYB!!!\nBut thats now gone take it on the chin and sort Wigan out Sat week.\nThe thing we should remember is this isn't the Premier league where you lose a couple of games and you lose all chance to win.\nBetter not peak too soon, it wouldn't be a disaster to win the playoffs!\nNever mind 10 days to think up the next excuse, I think we probably have been sussed ...long ball run about a lot, not rocket science.\nI'm afraid time to add some quality especially in mid field can't live on this £10k strap line. Mid table beckons!\nKnowing how we play is not the same as being able to do anything about it. There is no \"magic bullet\" which deals with any particular style of play - otherwise no team would ever win more than a couple of games. And if mangers really are waiting until we play them the first time before discovering how we work, then they aren't doing their job properly.\nKnowing how a team plays is one thing, having the managerial brains, player quality, team cohesion and morale to be able to come up with a solution and implement it against a lot as good as ours is something altogether different.\nAnd, on a final note, Brighton were the team I picked before the start of the season to be competing right at the top of the Championship. Their managerial situation was evidently holding them back, as they have some top quality players (particularly Teixeira) and our now gaining some spirit in the face of relegation danger.\nThis is our best chance for years and I hope we take it because I am starting to wonder if I will ever see Town back in the top division in my lifetime.\nWhat worries me more is the comment \"they were ready for us\".\nI am a big Mick and Terry fan. but ... why wasn't he able to say \"we were ready for them\" when he had, rightly, identified that they were under-performing...... we HAVE to be ready !\nAlso - I know Jas \"emergency services\" keeps going on about the squad being light - he is more consistent than Mick !!! But it IS a worry, DESPITE OUR MASSIVE ACHIEVEMENTS THAT WE ARE RIGHTLY PROUD OF, that we have no-one who can come off the bench to change the game and run rings .... and n-one to trust to play the odd game to give (eg Murphs) a rest to keep his legs and mind fresh.\nI'd love to go up and come down again - because that would mean we had earned the right to go up in the first place !!! But it would ALSO secure the club financially for years, AND give the funds for Mick to keep building for the next time we go up !\nCOYB - I still think second behind Bournemouth is a possible - but top 4 is realistic (behind Bournemouth Derby and Middlesborough\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
