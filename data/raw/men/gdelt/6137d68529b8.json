Why waste time and energy arguing with the referee regarding the decisions he makes?\n\"There is a player, who is the captain, who has the right to argue with the referee. I don't like the behaviour I saw. It's a weakness when you get a red card.\"\nBellingham received the backing, unsurprisingly, of his own manager, Carlo Ancelotti, with the Italian claiming that his words had been twisted by the referee because he did not fully understand what was being said.\n\"I think the referee did not understand Jude Bellingham's English. He said f**k off, not f**k you… that's way different,\" Ancelotti mused to reporters, before adding of the standard of officiating on offer in Spain's top flight \"strange things have happened in these three games that everyone has seen\n\"Everyone saw that the VAR didn't go in to look at plays in their area but they did in ours. There is a problem. Something has happened that shouldn't happen. We must fight and continue.\"\nMadrid recently wrote a letter of complaint to the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) after their 1-0 defeat at the hands of Espanyol, which claim they demonstrated \"double standards\" from officials when compared to how other teams are treated.\nBarcelona legend Gerard Pique was quick to accuse the 15-time Champions League winners, and current holders, of creating a \"smokescreen\" to deflect from any defeat they may suffer.",
