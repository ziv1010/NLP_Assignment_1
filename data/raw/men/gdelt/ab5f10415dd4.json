  "body_text": "When Kylian Mbappe scored a hat-trick in the Camp Nou three years ago, it was seen as the changing of the guard in the world of football individualism. It was a night that helped PSG move on from the ‘remontada’, their infamous Champions League collapse in 2017, but it would also prove to be Lionel Messi’s final European match for Barcelona. A new global star was stealing the throne.\nAdvertisement\nThe symmetry was all so very neat and, of course, a World Cup final won by Messi’s Argentina in December 2022 illustrated that the switch did not happen as quickly as most anticipated. But now, three years on, PSG are going to return to Barcelona knowing that, this time, it is their star player who is poised to end their shared European story. As it stands, Mbappe faces the prospect of playing his final Champions League match for PSG in Barcelona. That is the club who scarred his team in 2017 — and may well soon become his most vociferous opponent in Spain, should he, as expected, join Real Madrid when his contract expires this summer.\nNot only that, but it would mean his final Champions League appearance at the Parc des Princes would be the one witnessed last night, in which PSG suffered a 3-2 defeat. It was a night that brought a 27-match unbeaten run to a close, but it was also one in which Mbappe was shackled.\nPSG’s all-time leading goalscorer, including in Europe, was reduced to three shots on goal, two of which were blocked and the last of which came 80 minutes after the second. It was the first time he played a home Champions League game since September 2021 (against Manchester City) without having a shot on target. His other highlights were one successful dribble out of three, three offsides and 44 touches. Half-time substitute Bradley Barcola managed 34. “The coach is responsible for the result,” said Luis Enrique. “And I won’t speak on players individually.”\nThat is not the way Mbappe would want to end his European story with PSG, and neither would a goodbye at the Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys — known for the hill it sits on, Montjuic, Barcelona’s temporary home — be deemed fitting.\nTo avert that scenario, PSG will have to find a different formula to the one implemented for their first leg in Paris. This was a game of major swings in momentum and was decided by “finer margins”, as Luis Enrique noted. But it was also one in which they lost control twice, and failed throughout the game to bring their best player to the fore.\nAdvertisement\n“The wingers helped us a lot defensively,” said Barcelona head coach, Xavi. “(Pau) Cubarsi jumped so well against Lee Kang-in, against (Marco) Asensio sometimes, because they changed a lot of players. We defended so well against Mbappe with (Jules) Kounde and Ronald Araujo, and we created many chances. Robert (Lewandowski) made the difference and Raphinha.”\nBarcelona were smart in their approach. They absorbed PSG’s early enthusiasm, no doubt buoyed by the growing expectancy surrounding the team which was furthered again by some pre-match choreography — a full-on Star Wars tribute featuring a Parisian Yoda and a rendition of the imperial death march to accompany Barcelona’s warm-up.\nThe visitors adopted a 4-4-2 out of possession and they were unafraid to go direct. They used goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen’s range of passing up to Lewandowski, who had the nous to get the better of 20-year-old Lucas Beraldo, who had a difficult night. Lewandowski’s hold-up work moved the team up the field and brought the excellent pairing of 16-year-old Lamine Yamal and Raphinha into play.\nOn Mbappe, Xavi cooled the idea of a specific plan pre-match but it was clear that he was keeping matters around the France captain tight. “You have to be aggressive, mark him, be attentive because PSG is one of the best teams in transitions,” he said.\nIn the past, during Classicos with Real Madrid, he has sometimes swapped Araujo out to right back to combat Vinicius Junior but here he trusted right back Kounde, knowing well that Araujo would be close to support him and Sergi Roberto could screen him in attack. Luis Enrique’s decision to play with Asensio as a false nine served to assist Barcelona in doubling up on Mbappe, without fear of a disruptive PSG presence occupying them. Asensio had a limited impact.\nAdvertisement\nMbappe had initially benefited from Nuno Mendes’ bright start at left-back, and it was the Portuguese defender who assisted his first shot on goal in the fifth minute. But increasingly, Mendes became occupied with Yamal going the other way and those overloads on the left, and the subsequent space, dwindled.\nMuch changed at the interval when Luis Enrique brought on Barcola and moved Ousmane Dembele in-field, which allowed Mbappe more space and put Dembele closer to him. But after the initial shock of the changes, Barcelona adjusted and regained control through the introduction of Pedri and Joao Felix. Again, PSG will look to defensive vulnerabilities for the goals they conceded, stemming from poor distribution from Gianluigi Donnarumma and then a poorly defended corner. But control and sustained attacking momentum proved elusive.\nPSG were missing Achraf Hakimi, an integral part of the team’s attacking setup. His vertical runs offer a different dynamic and Barcelona’s back line was not stretched enough before the break. His return will certainly help in an attacking sense. There were questions too about Luis Enrique’s decision not to field Warren Zaire-Emery, the first time he has not started in the Champions League this season. PSG’s midfield was very attack-minded.\n“That’s why I am the coach, that’s why I’ve been doing this job for many years,” he said when asked. “I thought they would be the best players and the ones who are most prepared. Of course, the result doesn’t back up my decision, but I happily accept everything that comes with a defeat. I congratulate the opponents.”\nLuis Enrique has tinkered often during his tenure so far, infamously starting four forwards away at Newcastle United in October, resulting in a 4-1 hammering, but then conversely using Dembele in a central attacking midfield role against Real Sociedad in the round of 16, which ensured a comfortable victory.\nHis in-game rectifications illustrated an awareness of the issues but, in Xavi, he found a strong opposite number guiding a young, impressive team.\nThe key thing to note for PSG is that this is very much half-time in a tie that has already swung greatly in both directions. The removal of the away-goals rule has unshackled this edition of the Champions League. “I have no doubt that we can qualify,” said Luis Enrique. “Everyone speculates, but we, for example, have not lost away in the Championship. We have six days to prepare.”\nAdvertisement\nPSG have never won a Champions League tie having lost the first leg, but now have the coach who inflicted the remontada upon them and they know they can win in Catalonia, too.\nBut to overturn this deficit, they need to find a way to bring Mbappe to the fore once more. Another quiet night like this one, in the setting of Barcelona’s temporary homestead, would not be the way to bow out.\n(Photo: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images)",
