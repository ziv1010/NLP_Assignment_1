The First Division title race had gone down to a final-day shootout between us and the Reds, which we had to win by at least two goals to leapfrog our opponents and claim the glory.\nAfter a goalless first 45 minutes, Alan Smith netted a header but as the 90-minute mark ticked by, the championship chase seemed in vain. However in stoppage-time, Michael Thomas raced through to prod the ball past Bruce Grobbelaar and provide one of the game’s greatest moments.\nDecember 23, 2001\nLiverpool 1-2 Arsenal\nWe provided an ideal early Christmas present to Gooners around the world by sealing a big win against one of our title rivals during the 2001/02 campaign, which proved to be our first win on the red half of Merseyside for eight years.\nDespite seeing Giovanni von Bronkhorst dismissed early on, we opened the scoring when Freddie Ljungberg was brought down in the box by Jerzy Dudek, allowing Thierry Henry to convert the resulting spot-kick, and then in the second half Robert Pires centred for the Swede to fire home. Jari Litmanen would pull one back, but our 10 men held on for a big win.\nJanuary 9, 2007\nLiverpool 3-6 Arsenal\nFor the first time in 77 years, the Reds conceded six goals at home, with Julio Baptista bagging four of them in this League Cup quarter-final. Jeremie Aliadiere and Robbie Fowler had both got on the scoresheet before The Beast came to the fore, netting a free-kick before Alex Song added our third.\nThe Brazilian completed his brace to hand us a 4-1 half-time lead, but after missing a penalty, he rifled in from long range to eventually complete his hat-trick. Steven Gerrard and Sami Hyypia pulled goals back, but Baptista’s fourth of the night rounded off the scoring.\nApril 21, 2009\nLiverpool 4-4 Arsenal\nTwo years later, incredibly we had another player who could say they netted four times at Anfield. Andrey Arshavin fired us into a one-goal advantage at the break, but the second half exploded into life when Fernando Torres and Yossi Benayoun turned the game on its head.\nA topsy-turvy encounter continued when Arshavin unleashed a thunderbolt of a shot to beat Pepe Reina, and was then in the perfect place to complete his hat-trick three minutes later. Torres quickly levelled things up again, but in the last minute the Russian blasted home his fourth, however Benayoun would pop up with an equaliser in the final moments.\nMarch 3, 2012\nLiverpool 1-2 Arsenal\nWe would be on the other end of last-gasp drama in this meeting, which saw Robin van Persie's clinical edge in front of goal prove to be the difference between the teams and take us to victory.\nAfter Dirk Kuyt had squandered a penalty, Laurent Koscielny's own goal gave the hosts the lead, but our Dutch striker responded with a header eight minutes later. Then in the 92nd minute, a fine pass from Song was volleyed past Reina by van Persie to clinch the three points in style.\nTake a look at more memorable moments at Anfield in our playlist of classic games\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
