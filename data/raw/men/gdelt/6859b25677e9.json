Last week in a 38-13 win over Michigan State the transfer from Cal tossed for 332 yards and four touchdowns as he continues to rise up the Heisman list and draft boards. Indiana had four sacks in that win, with Rolijah Hardy and Stephen Daley both getting two quarterback takedowns.\nUCLA is on a three-game winning streak that has the Bruins at 3-1 in the Big Ten but 3-4 overall. After shocking Penn State, UCLA followed that up with its own 38-13 win over Michigan State and then a 20-17 victory over Maryland last week. QB Nico Iamaleava had three TDs against Michigan State, but against Maryland he only had one, but he also had two interceptions. Anthony Frias II had 97 rushing yards on four carries, including a 55-yard score. The Bruins needed only 33 seconds on their final drive to get in range for the game-winning field goal thanks in large part to a 35-yard rush from Frias II.\nWho: UCLA Bruins vs. No. 2 Indiana Hoosiers\nWhen: Saturday, Oct. 25 at noon EDT\nWhere: Memorial Stadium in Bloomington, Ind.\nStream: DirecTV (free trial); FuboTV; SlingTV\nBetting: Check out our MA sports betting guide, where you can learn basic terminology, definitions and how to read odds for those interested in learning how to bet in Massachusetts.\nWhat is DirecTV?\nDirecTV is an internet TV service that offers your favorite entertainment, news and sports channels, as well as local TV stations and regional sports networks.
