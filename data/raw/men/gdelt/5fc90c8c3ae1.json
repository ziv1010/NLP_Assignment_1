  "body_text": "The future of Manchester United’s Casemiro is one of the most discussed issues amongst fans of the club these days.\nThe five time Champions League winner is one of the most decorated players of his generation and played an integral part in Real Madrid’s European dominance over the last decade.\nThe Brazilian midfielder arrived to Old Trafford to much fanfare in August 2022 for a mammoth fee of £70m.\nCasemiro had a wonderful debut year in England, bringing much needed defensive balance and discipline to United’s midfield. He also added goals to his game, scoring seven in all competitions.\nThese included crucial goals against Bournemouth and Chelsea in May 2023, which helped secure Champions League football and the opening goal in the Carabao Cup final against Newcastle United.\nHowever, the Brazilian has had an horrendous second season, where he has often been caught out of position and put in some terrible performances both in midfield and as a makeshift centre back.\nPundits have poured scorn over the player’s form and it has been claimed by many that he is no longer fit for purpose to compete at the highest level.\nIt is said that INEOS are keen to part ways with the 32 year old due to his massive wages and declining form.\nFootball Transfers‘s Jacque Talbot now reports that he has received information that “Casemiro is likely to move to one of the top PIF clubs in Saudi Arabia in the summer.”\nInterestingly, Talbot also adds that the player has already said “his goodbyes to Manchester United teammates following the FA Cup final.”\nThe midfielder cut a glum figure in the post-match celebrations when he is usually seen as a jovial figure on the pitch.\nHe was left out of the starting line up to face Manchester City at Wembley and it is rumoured that he requested to be left out of the squad if he wasn’t going to start. However, Talbot also notes that this has been strenuously denied.\nThe report states that “the midfielder was at the post match party, where he said goodbye to some staff permanently, but was one of the first to leave and got a flight straight to Brazil. His early departure was previously relayed here .\nCasemiro has been linked to numerous clubs, mainly in Saudi Arabia as Football Insider claim, and it was even reported that Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al Nassr could be prepared to part with €90 million to sign the legendary defensive midfielder.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
