  "body_text": "PHILADELPHIA — Gianni Infantino, understanding the assignment of the two Lombardi Trophies 10 paces away Thursday morning, started his press availability at Lincoln Financial Field with a Swiss-inflected, “Go Birds.”\nThat kind of sales pitch was the express purpose of Infantino’s visit to Philadelphia, the first time the FIFA president has been to the city but one of the locations on his travel itinerary the next two summers. It begins in June when Lincoln Financial Field hosts eight matches over three weeks in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, a newly expanded international competition for clubs.\n“We’re here in the United States of America to start this new exciting competition,” Infantino said, “and of course, Philadelphia, with eight games, is one of the key venues.”\nThe Linc will host six matches in the group stages, plus one in the round of 16 and a quarterfinal on July 4. Already set to come to the city are the likes of Manchester City, Chelsea, Juventus and Real Madrid. The Round of 16 will bring two new teams, pitting Group A (Inter Miami, Palmeiras, Porto) and Group B (Paris Saint-Germain, Atletico Madrid) survivors.\nIn the process, a half-million soccer fans could find their way through South Philly turnstiles, a number that meets the Eagles’ goal of being a player on the international stage.\n“We are getting to put our home, the home of the Eagles, on the grandest stage potentially in the world,” Eagles Chief Operating Officer Frank Gumienny said. “It’s a proud papa moment, to be able to take what we’ve done and what we’ve learned and what we’ve built and highlight the biggest names in the sports world.”\nThe Club World Cup is the natural, intercontinental consequence of super-sizing soccer tournaments, from the expanded UEFA Champions League to the first 48-team World Cup. Founded in 2000, it was mostly a quaint competition, uniting the winners of continental competitions like the Champions League, CONCACAF Champions League and South America’s Copa Libertadores, with a couple of extra clubs to round out numbers. It remained at most an eight-team affair until this rapid inflation to 32 teams, bringing together more than just continental champs, a noble idea to scratch the itch that the World Cup addresses but on the club scale.\n“When it comes to the teams, to the clubs, nobody really knows, because everyone thinks that the country winning their own national continental competition is the best in the world,” Infantino said. “That’s actually not the case. So we decided to create a real World Cup for teams.”\nThe tournament will serve a dual purpose as a test run for the 2026 World. (FIFA in 2017 discontinued what had been since 1992 its designated dry-run, the Confederations Cup of national teams.)\nFive of 12 venues for the Club World Cup will host 2026 World Cup games, plus Los Angeles, which will use the Rose Bowl for the Club World Cup and SoFi Stadium in 2026. The Club World Cup incorporates soccer-specific stadiums in cities that missed out on the World Cup, like Nashville, Cincinnati and Washington. It will open June 14 with Inter Miami playing Al Ahly of Egypt, and the winner will be crowned July 13 at MetLife Stadium.\nThe governance of the tournament is slightly different than the World Cup, mainly a partnership between FIFA and the Eagles locally. The 2026 World Cup – in which the Linc will host six games, including a Round of 16 contest on July 4, in a split hosting between the U.S., Canada and Mexico – is under the auspices of the Philadelphia 2026 local organizing committee.\nGumienny said that means the Linc will look a little more like what football fans are used to than when World Cup branding takes over in 2026. But this tournament is a crucial testing ground for the nuanced challenges of the World Cup. While the franchise has hosted plenty of major events, the frequency of World Cup games is novel, on the playing surface in particular. Gumienny said the tournament will allow the field to stretch to FIFA dimensions for the first time, including the removal of seating in the four field corners, which will then be replaced by temporary seating.\nInfantino played to the local crowd by mentioning his visit to Super Bowl LIX, watching the Eagles win their second championship. He’s had a busy visit to the United States, which includes a tour to Club World Cup venues and political maneuvering with the Trump administration. In March, he succeeded in getting President Trump to set up a task force for the 2026 World Cup. Amid growing fear of crackdowns on visas and the general safety from visitors to the U.S., Infantino this week hosted Attorney General Pamela Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel at FIFA offices in Miami.\n“It’s absolutely crucial that we have this collaboration,” Infantino said, before referencing corruption scandals that predated his presidency. “And by the way, something like this never would have been possible some years ago with the image that FIFA had. So we came back quite a long way. And today we work in a clear way, in a transparent way, in an ethical way, and we bring the world to the United States of America. These are the guarantees that the United States government has signed at the time of the bidding and has reconfirmed.”\nInfantino pushed the notion of soccer as a uniting force, even as divisions in the U.S. grow. He brushed off reports of low ticket sales: “We will have full stadiums in America. If in America, you fill soccer stadiums for friendly games, then when you come with a World Cup with the best players who play really to win a competition, for sure, it will be full.”\nFrom a Philadelphia perspective, bringing some of soccer’s biggest brands to town is a chance to reach fans that might not normally engage with the Linc. The World Cup in 2026 promises to be an order of magnitude higher than that. It’s an opportunity that Gumienny and the Eagles are looking forward to.\n“We want to show to everyone that we can put on the grandest show and have everyone leave with an amazing experience,” Gumienny said. “ … We want to show off Lincoln Financial Field and Philadelphia.”",
