  "body_text": "After four straight seasons of Champions League football under Mauricio Pochettino, this will be just the third time in the competition for Tottenham Hotspur since 2019/20, with both of the previous two campaigns featuring lackluster group stages followed by immediate exits in the Round of 16. But after a trophy-winning Europa League effort last year, Spurs are back in the top competition with plenty of optimism behind Thomas Frank and a new batch of signings.\nTottenham Hotspur vs. Villarreal Preview: Glory Glory Nights\nSpurs return to the Champions League after last season’s memorable Europa League title.\nTottenham’s draw is on the lighter side, though dropping points in the opening fixture against Villarreal would instantly ramp up the pressure, as winning at home seems to be the key to navigating the new League Phase system. The Spanish side opened the year with back-to-back clean sheet victories but then drew Celta Vigo and lost to previously winless Atleti on Saturday. This is a tricky fixture but a great way to return to the Champions League.\nUCL League Phase MW1\nDate: Tuesday, September 16\nTime: 3:00 pm ET, 8:00 pm UK\nLocation: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London, England\nTV: Paramount+ (US), Amazon Prime Video (UK)\nTable: Tottenham (t-1st, 0 pts), Villarreal (t-1st, 0 pts)\nThese sides do not have any previous competitive history, which is always one of the best parts of playing in Europe. All things considered, Spurs have seen far fewer Spanish sides than from the other big leagues in recent years, though Group Stage battles against Real Madrid (2017/18) and Barcelona (2018/19) were both extremely memorable. Villareal was out of Europe last year, but did make it to the 2021/22 Champions League semifinals before losing to Liverpool.\nThree Big Questions\nWill Villarreal force its attack? That impressive Champions League campaign featured wins over Juventus and Bayern in the knockout rounds and was preceded by the 2020/21 Europa League title that required taking down both Arsenal and United. Villarreal is a club that is capable with hanging with the biggest names in Europe thanks to a well-organized defensive structure and an efficient attack after winning back the ball.\nThis attack was excellent last season, finishing third in goals and xG behind Barcelona and Madrid. Despite plenty of turnover, Villarreal has started this season near the top of La Liga in scoring as well and is going to hunt for goals in North London. Spurs have been really strong defensively so far, but this will be a real test in terms of threat and aggression. The visitors can be very direct in transition and look for high-quality shots; expect Joao Palhinha to be tasked with breaking up play through the middle.\nHow will Frank approach a busy fixture list? On the other end of the pitch, Tottenham will certainly be looking to force some of its own pressure as well. Who that comes from is a bit of a mystery, with this being Frank’s first stretch of multi-match weeks. Villarreal appears to be the most important fixture during this run, meaning we should see a first-choice attack, though injuries and the onboarding of newer faces will influence his decisions.\nWe do know that Mathys Tel will not be involved, meaning either Richarlison or Randal Kolo Muani should get the nod up top. The most interesting choice to me is where Xavi Simons will play, as his debut came on the left instead of centrally, though his talent could be effective in either position. Spurs will need to be able to strike quickly, knowing Villarreal is sound defensively and able to keep possession. How Frank aims to unlock his attack will be telling for the rest of this competition.\nWhich familiar faces will frustrate? One big narrative for this one is the presence of many former North Londoners. On the good, loanee Manor Solomon has yet to debut for Villarreal, while Juan Foyth has started all four La Liga fixtures, twice as the captain of his side. Meanwhile, Nicolas Pepe has three goal contributions already and Thomas Partey did finally make his first start over the weekend after previously being locked up as a sub.\nIt will be extremely frustrating if Pepe or Partey have a good showing. Pepe, in particular, did very little for Arsenal but has been better since. With Thierno Barry and Yeremy Pino transferring to the Premier League, Villarreal needs Pepe to lead the attack, and he has done so thus far with an assist in the opener, goals in each of the next two, then a shot off the crossbar against Atleti. Minimizing his impact would go a long way towards securing all three points.",
