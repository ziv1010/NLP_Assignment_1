It can be argued they were fortunate to escape Motherwell with a point last weekend, while Rangers had to play the final half hour against Dundee with 10 men before captain James Tavernier came off the bench to rescue another with his late spot kick.\nA \"disappointed\" Martin admitted: \"There was just general lethargy and no speed in the first half.\"\nAfter last week's draw at Fir Park, Martin had questioned the mentality of some of his players, complaining that some \"have to drop their ego\", and was delighted with the reaction against Plzen.\nThis time, he was \"pleased with the response of the team when we went down to 10 men and we could've won the game in the end, but the mentality has to come from the very first kick of the match\".\nMartin accepted some of the blame, admitting: \"In hindsight, I should've made some changes to inject that energy in the team, but I explained my decision before the game and maybe I could've changed that now the game is finished.\n\"We're learning about the group all the time, so that's a lesson learnt today.\"\nBBC pundit and former Rangers striker Steven Thompson described them as \"Jekyll and Hyde\" but pointed out that the same happened under the previous two team bosses - Philippe Clement and Barry Ferguson - last season.\n\"They would have a brilliant European performance and then fall flat,\" he told BBC Scotland's Sportscene. \"It is something Russell Martin needs to get rid of quickly.\"\n'Maybe not so quickly as everyone wants'\nSaturday's draw was particularly galling to Rangers fans considering Dundee arrived with a poor start to their season heaping pressure on their new head coach, former Rangers defender Steven Pressley.\nDundee, who managed just two attempts on goal in their opening Premiership defeat at home to Hibernian, had not beaten Rangers in their previous 17 meetings and had lost their latest 19 visits to Ibrox.\nThe passing style being adopted under Martin meant centre-half John Souttar attempted 131 passes in this game, the highest of any player in the opening two weekends, the team overall attempted 709, again the highest of any team, and their 20 goal attempts were highest too.\nYet they still relied on a penalty to rescue a draw and have now failed to win both of their opening two league matches for the first time since 1989.\nMartin could understand the reaction of the home support.\n\"The fans have lacked the success they want for quite some time, so I understand the frustration,\" he said. \"I didn't get too high on Tuesday, so we're not going to get too low today.\n\"We are at a point now at this club where something needed to change.\n\"The ownership has changed, there's a new coaching staff, there's new players, there's hopefully a new way of behaving in the training ground - properly, every single day, regarding standards and what's expected at this football club. So it's not a quick fix and this is not me coming out and making excuses.\n\"I think we change the manager from year to year and nothing really changes.\n\"So now it's about really changing the culture and the feel of the club day in and day out. That will end up in a good outcome. Good process, good people, will always end up in a good outcome. But maybe not so quickly as everyone wants.\"\nMore egos or fewer?\nFormer Rangers striker and assistant boss Billy Dodds told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound: \"Russell Martin wants the players to put their egos to bed and concentrate on the football.\n\"But I think they need more egos at the club because egos come with top players.\n\"It took a man being sent off to get them going, but they deserved that draw in the end because they kept going at it.\"\nLike last season, Rangers found it difficult to break down a team domestically who sat back to defend their penalty box at Ibrox - and Thompson gave credit to Pressley.\n\"He has had a lot of stick in the early part of the season, but he got his tactics spot on,\" he said.\nRight-back Tavernier and midfielder Nicolas Raskin were two of four players dropped in midweek and were again on the bench against Dundee.\nHowever, Tavernier came on to prove his goalscoring worth once more, while Martin admitted that \"Raskin was great when he game on. He tackled more than the whole team\".\nMeanwhile, centre-half Nasser Djiga is now in line to miss the Old Firm derby through suspension after his last-man red card against Dundee.\nIt leaves Martin with questions over his personnel as matches come thick and fast.\nFormer Rangers forward Gordon Smith pointed out that Rangers were better when down to 10 men and were unfortunate that Cyriel Dessers was denied a late winner for offside.\nHowever, he was left pondering: \"How can they put that kind of performance in Europe and not in the league?\"\nIt is a conundrum that Martin is not the first Rangers team boss to have faced.",
