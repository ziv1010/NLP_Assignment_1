  "body_text": "Manchester City have reportedly set their sights on Newcastle United full-back Tino Livramento as they plan for the summer transfer window.\nThe Telegraph suggest that Pep Guardiola’s head has been turned in his quest to fill in the void left by Kyle Walker, who left for AC Milan in January.\nThe 22-year-old has made a huge impression since joining Newcastle in 2023, quickly becoming a key player at St James’ Park and earning a call-up to the England squad.\nHis rapid progress saw him make his Three Lions debut last November, and now, Guardiola is reportedly keen on bringing him to the Etihad as part of his squad rebuild ahead of the 2025-26 season.\nLivramento, who previously played for Southampton, has already featured 31 times for Newcastle this campaign. His performances haven’t gone unnoticed, and he’s expected to be included in England’s squad for the upcoming March internationals under new manager Thomas Tuchel.\nNewcastle face possible departures should they not achieve Champions League status\nWith Walker no longer in City’s plans, Guardiola sees Livramento as an ideal long-term replacement. His ability to play on both the right and left sides of defence is a major asset with versatility being something that Guardiola values highly in his players.\nWhile Newcastle may be determined to hold onto one of their brightest talents, the reality of modern football means they could face a tough battle to keep him. If they secure Champions League qualification, it could strengthen their hand in negotiations.\nThere are also countless reports suggesting Alexander Isak may be hard to keep if they don’t achieve qualification to the competition.\nHowever, if they fall short or financial pressures related to Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) come into play, they may be forced to consider offers.",
