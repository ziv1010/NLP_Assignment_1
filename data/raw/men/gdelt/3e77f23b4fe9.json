Football London’s Alasdair Gold brought news Nagelsmann will no longer be pursued by Tottenham. Transfer guru Fabrizio Romano subsequently echoed those claims.\nBut despite the managerial uncertainty that still pervades the club, a high profile summer signing is poised to go through.\nTottenham signed Juventus winger Dejan Kulusevski on an 18-month loan back in the winter window of 2022.\nThe initial loan deal cost €10m and contained an obligation to buy worth €35m should Spurs qualify for the Champions League in the 2022/23 campaign.\nTottenham can still finish inside the top four, though are six points adrift and have played one game more than both Newcastle and Man Utd.\nReports out of Italy recently speculated Kulusevski could return to Juventus when the loan concludes. However, per the PA news agency, the Sweden international remains on course to join Spurs outright.\nDaniel Levy blushes spared\nThat’s because Spurs hedged their bets regarding UCL qualification, with Kulusevski’s loan deal containing a second clause – also worth €35m – that was a simple option to buy, not obligation.\nKulusevski has struggled this term with just two goals and six assists provided in the Premier League. However, he’s not alone in underperforming in a Spurs shirt this term and his magnificent first six months at the club showed he’s more than capable.\nAs such, the PA reports Tottenham fully intend to take option two and activate the clause. €35m currently equates to around £30.7m.\nAccording to Football London, the £30.7m fee is ‘payable over five financial years’. As such, Tottenham will not be on the hook for the full fee this summer and will be able to channel the bulk of their summer transfer budget into other deals.\nWhen asked about Kulusevski’s situation during his latest press conference, interim boss, Ryan Mason said: “The general feeling is that Deki is a Tottenham player.\n“Those conversations, like many other conversations about other players, will come at the end of the season.\n“I love Deki as a player. I think he’s got so much room to grow and be a top, top player, even though he already is a top, top player.\n“At the same time when you play for a club like this, I feel it’s important that you feel you have to earn the shirt in every moment.\n“Naturally when you play for a club like this there’s competition. At the moment, last week, you could see he was on the bench but he came on and helped the team get the result. That’s important.”\nREAD MORE: Tottenham insider leaks triple transfer miss as Liverpool, Bayern capitalise on Levy failings",
