Patients wear special glasses that capture infrared light, picked up by the retina implant.\nAround 80% of patients saw vision improve after the operation, allowing them to read and recognise faces – a previous impossibility for those suffering from the illness.\n3: Birds and insects return to France\nA 2018 ban on neonicotinoid insecticides has seen bird populations for some species increase by up to 3% in France, according to recent research.\nSpecies to see increases include blackbirds, chaffinches, and blackcaps, which are all insectivorous (insect-eaters).\nThe previous use of insecticides saw the birds face a loss of available food source, but as the insect population returns so do the birds.\nIt may take decades for populations to return to previous levels (they dropped 57% in 40 years) but the current growth is encouraging.\nWhile not officially studied during the research, scientists believe another positive effect of higher insect levels is an increase in population of many other species that eat insects, including mammals, bats, and fish.\nA 2025 farming law sought to re-authorise the use of a neonicotinoid pesticide called acetamiprid, but France’s Constitutional Council rejected this.\nFrance is currently the only EU country to ban the use of acetamiprid, but EU regulations require the pesticide to be assessed for reauthorisation in 2030, and it is likely to be banned across the bloc then.\n4: Year of sporting success\nFrance saw a bumper 2025 in the world of sport, with several successes.\nThe men’s rugby team triumphed in the 2025 Six Nations tournament, narrowly beating out England and Ireland to clinch the title.\nThe team remains among the favourites for the upcoming 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia.\nFollowing this, football club Paris-Saint Germain (PSG) won the 2025 Champions League with a 5-0 victory against Inter Milan on May 31. They became the second French team to win the title after Marseille beat AC Milan in 1993.\nFinally, cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prévot won the female Tour de France on home soil and became the first French woman to win the event following the event’s relaunch in 2022.\nHer victory sparked a surge of interest in female cycling in the country, and the breakout performance of young Maëva Squiban also contributed to interest among young French women in the sport.\nLarge crowds were present for the first stage in Vannes (Morbihan) and the race finish in Châtel (Haute-Savoie).\nTV viewership for the women’s race averaged 2.7 million per stage, and 7.7 million for the final day.\n5: Low inflation levels help households\nFrance recorded some of the lowest inflation rates out of all EU member states, keeping many costs for households down throughout the year.\nEnd-of-year inflation levels are expected to reach 0.9%, after annual inflation in October stood at 0.8%, the third-lowest in Europe.\nThe rate was among the lowest inflation levels recorded for several years, following a huge spike during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nLow energy (particularly for gas and oil) and services costs helped keep inflation low, although certain foodstuffs such as chocolate, orange juice, and coffee all saw increases.\nEarly estimates from the government and Banque de France suggest inflation in 2026 is set to be around 1.3%.\n6: People power saves French glassware brand\nIconic French glassware maker Duralex, long a fixture of school canteens and café tables, was given a dramatic lifeline after an extraordinary public fundraising effort.\nThe company has faced repeated difficulties in recent years, including changes of ownership, Covid-related disruption and several periods in receivership. In 2024, Duralex was bought by its own employees and relaunched as a worker-owned co-operative, raising hopes of a more stable future.\nThose hopes were tested in 2025 when soaring energy prices put the energy-intensive glassmaker at renewed risk of closure. Producing toughened glass requires furnaces operating at temperatures above 1,400C, making the business particularly vulnerable to rising energy costs.\nIn response, Duralex issued an emergency appeal for €5 million to secure its future. The reaction exceeded all expectations. Within just 48 hours, members of the public pledged around €20 million — four times the amount requested.\nThe surge of support appeared to tap into a deep well of affection for the brand, seen by many as part of France’s everyday heritage. The fundraising success has not only eased immediate financial pressure but also underlined the enduring place Duralex holds in the public imagination.\nManagement believes the business will break even by 2027.\nDid you come across any 'feel-good' news stories from France in 2025?
