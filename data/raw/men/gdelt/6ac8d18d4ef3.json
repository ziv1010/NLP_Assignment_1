The team will continue to wear the poppy shirts for our away match against Leicester City in the WSL on Sunday.\nThe match-worn shirts, from both our men’s and women’s teams will then be auctioned via the ‘Match Worn Shirts’ website, with all proceeds going towards the Royal British Legion, the charity which provides lifelong support to serving and ex-serving personnel and their families.\nCommemorative wreaths were laid just before kick-off ahead of our match against Bristol City at Mangata Pay UK Stadium, Meadow Park on Thursday night.\nAt our men’s first team match on Saturday, which falls on Armistice Day – 11th November, both Arsenal and Burnley football club will pay their respects before kick-off.\nOur Academy teams will pay their respects on their matchdays over the weekend, and also continuing our long tradition, an Arsenal representative will be laying a wreath at the Islington Green War Memorial as part of a ceremony ahead of Sunday’s service of remembrance.\nTo donate to this year’s Poppy Appeal and for more details on the match-worn shirt auctions, visit the Match Worn Shirt website.\nAuthentic worn & signed football shirts - CoA included with every item. We are the home of match worn & signed sporting memorabilia, raising funds for charities worldwide.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
