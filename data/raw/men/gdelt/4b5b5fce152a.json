Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘A couple of seasons ago, if [Bukayo] Saka or Declan [Rice] or [Martin] Odegaard are missing, Arsenal struggled. They’re missing their two starting centre-backs, Timber can pop in there and Ben White can play.\n‘I mean they probably have the four best full-backs in the country, all playing in one team, and probably the best goalkeeper as well.\n‘Then you’ve got Declan, [Martin] Zubimendi has been amazing, Odegaard, [Eberechi] Eze, the list goes on. Obviously when they get Kai Havertz back to go with [Viktor] Gyokeres. They’re the real deal.\n‘That [Rice’s injury] would be a worry because Declan virtually plays every game.\n‘That’s the biggest difference to this Arsenal team, they can compete in every phase, they’ve got size, they’re all 6’2″, except [Leandro] Trossard, set-pieces they’re good, they’ve got size, they can compete, technically they’re very good and they’ve got finishing.\n‘I think Mikel has got all the ingredients for the recipe to go and win the Premier League this year, maybe even the Champions League.’\nMore Trending\nWhen asked if Arsenal could struggle in central defence without Saliba, Gabriel or Mosquera against Aston Villa this Saturday, Hargreaves replied: ‘Timber, I think is the best full-back in the Premier League this season, and I’m sure he can pop in there.\n‘He maybe not be physically the size of Saliba and Gabriel but he’s got proper personality, he’s as strong as anything, and obviously Ben White can play in there.\n‘They’ve got all these options, I think Mikel so far has done a brilliant job of picking what they need in the game. I think Mikel will be quietly confident wherever they go with what they have at the moment.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Ruben Amorim explains Kobbie Mainoo snub after Manchester United draw vs West Ham\nMORE: Roy Keane labels Man Utd star a ‘schoolboy’ with no ‘presence’ after West Ham draw\nMORE: Matthijs de Ligt injury latest as defender misses Manchester United vs West Ham",
