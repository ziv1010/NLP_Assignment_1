Through the generous support of the local community and the efforts of the group’s members, a total of €700 was raised.\nThe group was proud to present the donation to Martina Jennings, CEO of the Mayo Roscommon Hospice Foundation, during a recent gathering. The funds will go towards providing palliative care services and supporting families throughout the region.\nOn behalf of the Mags, Kevin and girls and the Deane family,â¯â¯they express their deepest and most heartfelt thanks to everyone both at home and abroad; local groups, committees, clubs, neighbours and friends who came together to organise and support the many fundraisers for the Help Mags Find Relief fund. Your kindness, generosity, and tireless efforts made it possible for Mags to undergo spinal deformity surgery and the surgeries have now taken place. Due to the expertise and diligence of the wonderful surgeons and team in London, Mags is recovering from an invasive and complicated 5 stage surgery.\nThere is still a long road ahead in terms of healing and rehabilitation but there has been progress thankfully.

Your perseveranceâ¯pays off as you picked him every year.â¯Then you all took a break from scoring as nobody chose an unknown, recentlyâ¯banned, amateur Chinese lad to win at The Crucible.â¯Nobody picked a world famous legend of the game to come runner up either. Toulouse and Leinster disappointâ¯as Bordeaux and Northampton contest the oval ball cup. Of course Liverpool, Arsenal, City and Chelsea close out the top four places. The romantic dreamers among you who had Forest and Newcastle woke up screaming.\nRelegation was fairly predictable with the three coming up going straight down again. Hats off for David Moyes as many of you had Everton to drop which is a sign of how well he has done since taking over. Relegation selections will be trickier next year as Spurs and Man Utd must be contenders to hit The Championship.\nLouth win Leinster resulting in nobody getting all four provincial champions.\nYou will notice that everybody has scored zero in this weekend's Champions League final. Well, everybody except Pierce. He has Inter Milan. If they lose, he gets five points but if he wins, clause seven states that if you are the only winner of an event you score double. Twenty points would make him harder to catch than a slipperyâ¯slithery snake in a soggy spinach soup. Kevin Barrett has his PSG jersey ready.\nIt’s a new beginning for Iorras Aontaithe with the introduction of two girls teams going forward with U12 and U14 making their debut.
