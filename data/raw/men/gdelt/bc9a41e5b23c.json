  "body_text": "Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has picked out Mohamed Salah as his ‘favourite’ player to watch in world football, praising the Liverpool forward’s extraordinary ‘longevity’ in the game.\nSalah has enjoyed a phenomenal start to the 2024/25 campaign with Liverpool under new head coach Arne Slot, in what is his eighth season at Anfield.\nIn the Premier League alone this term, Salah has racked up 22 goals and 14 assists to help the Merseyside giants assert themselves as the overwhelming favourites to win the title.\nThe 32-year-old has also been on song in the Champions League, notching three goals and four assists ahead of the Reds’ participation in this year’s knockout phase.\nWhile there remains uncertainty over Salah’s future at the club, with his current contract due to expire in the summer, the Egyptian has shown no signs that this could impact his performances in a Liverpool shirt.\nThe current bookmakers’ favourite to lift the Ballon d’Or, Salah will hope to continue his exceptional form this weekend when Liverpool men return to Premier League action at home to struggling Wolves.\nWenger has been blown away by Salah’s heroics on Merseyside and named the attacker among his top five players to watch during a quickfire Q&A with Goal before managing Team KSI at today’s Match for Hope.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

It’s normal, we’re still human.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Liam Delap responds to Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal transfer links\nMORE: Ruben Amorim explains why Antony and Scott McTominay are thriving away from Man Utd",
