But still from a fans’ perspective, this is still one of the biggest games in English football.\n“I worry for Manchester United if I’m being honest.\n“I’d be shocked if Arsenal don’t win. Their qualification to the Champions League quarter-final is sealed thanks to the 7-1 first leg win and they can now have a real go here. That makes this a dangerous game for United.\n“Arsenal have to keep winning every single game from now on and hope Liverpool slip up.\n“Historically, Manchester United have always turned up for games against Arsenal. But honestly, I don’t see them doing it this weekend!”\nLatest Man Utd news\n🔴⚫ Stunning claim Alejandro Garnacho ‘will LEAVE’ Man Utd this summer with next club, fee revealed\n🔴⚫ Man Utd struggler doing extra sessions to improve, but new signing already planned\n🔴⚫ Man Utd ‘working’ on signing of ‘explosive’ new target who’s thriving in Portugal",
