  "body_text": "The first deadline for bids to be submitted to buy Manchester United is on Friday, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe the only person to publicly state his interest in buying the club.\nRaine, the merchant bank, which dealt with the bidding process to buy Chelsea in 2022, was instructed by the Glazer family to oversee a potential sale.\nAdvertisement\nWhile stories continue to circulate about who may submit a bid before Friday’s deadline, one interesting dynamic is that United’s board are being kept in the dark and are not receiving updates.\nJoel and Avram Glazer are leading the talks — assisted by Raine — on the club’s side, with the process deemed a matter for the family rather than other executives.\nUnited have attracted interest from Qatar, although there is uncertainty as to whether that would be a minority investment or a full takeover.\nIf Qatar Sports Investment (QSI) — the vehicle used by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund (QIA) — was to buy United, then a sale of Paris Saint-Germain would need to be actioned. QSI, however, remains committed to PSG.\nBut with Friday’s deadline looming, Ratcliffe, who was named Britain’s richest person in 2019, is yet to be joined — at least in public — by rival bidders.\nChelsea board firmly behind Potter\nChelsea’s draw at West Ham United on Saturday means Graham Potter’s side have won just two of their last 13 Premier League matches, leaving them ninth in the table and 10 points off the top four.\nThe run of results, especially with so much money spent in the summer and January transfer windows, has led to some unrest among supporters. The Champions League is the last chance the club have for silverware this season.\nBut though some fans are questioning whether Potter is the right man to lead the club in the post-Roman Abramovich era, the club’s owners have no such concerns, reports David Ornstein, whose column returns next week.\nThe feeling within the Chelsea hierarchy is that the former Brighton coach should be judged in years not months and they are confident they have one of the best managers in the game. They have a lot of changes still to make at the club and decided early on not to judge him on whether they qualify for the Champions League this season.\nAdvertisement\nThe leadership team feel Potter coming in mid-season with a squad that needed such a big overhaul meant success was always very unlikely in the short term and that there is still a lot of change to come to what is now a youthful team. It’s felt he has been very unlucky with injuries too.\nThe success of Mikel Arteta at Arsenal with a young squad after a mixed start is also seen as reassuring and the board feel that it will take some time for all the new faces to gel and understand Potter’s tactics and methods.\nMistaken VAR removed from matches\nThe VAR who wrongly disallowed a Brighton goal against Crystal Palace on Saturday has been removed from the two matches he was due to officiate this week.\nAt Selhurst Park, Brighton’s Pervis Estupinan had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside by Brooks, leading to Howard Webb, the head of the Premier League referees, to apologise.\nProfessional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the body responsible for match officials across English football, said on Monday morning that Brooks has been replaced by Andre Marriner for tonight’s Merseyside derby.\nDavid Coote replaces him for the Arsenal vs Manchester City match on Wednesday.\nWhy Arsenal vs Manchester City is the same week as the Champions League\nThe biggest game of the Premier League season takes place this week, with league leaders Arsenal hosting champions Manchester City.\nThe game was originally supposed to be played in October but will take place in the same week as Champions League matches, which UEFA normally frowns upon.\nBut the reason Europe’s governing body hasn’t kicked up a fuss dates back to a favour the Premier League did it due to disruption to the calendar following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe Arsenal vs City game was one of the matches postponed following the monarch’s death on September 8, as was Arteta’s side’s Europa League group game against PSV Eindhoven. The City fixture was hastily rearranged for October 19 but that left UEFA with no midweek in which to finish the Europa League group before the World Cup. UEFA, therefore, asked the Premier League to postpone Arsenal vs City and the PSV match was allowed to take place.\nAdvertisement\nIt was therefore unsurprising that there was no pushback on the decision to play the potential title decider on the same night as the last-16 ties between Dortmund and Chelsea and Club Bruges and Benfica. However, it does leave the unusual situation of Premier League television rights holders such as Amazon and Peacock up against their Champions League equivalents BT Sport and CNBC vying for an audience.\nWhy Cancelo ended up at Bayern rather than Real or Barca\nJoao Cancelo’s January move from Manchester City to Bayern Munich caught many people by surprise.\nAnd unsurprisingly for a Premier League title winner, there was plenty of interest in the Portugual international despite his recent difficulties with Pep Guardiola.\nReal Madrid were also offered the chance to sign the full-back, as was revealed by Fabrizio Romano, but how interested they were depends on who you speak to and is indicative of the PR smoke and mirrors surrounding so many big transfers.\nMultiple sources involved in the negotiations admit there was a proposal from Real Madrid on the table that included a buy option valued at a fixed €30m (£26.5m, $32m) plus €20m in add-ons, which fell significantly short of the 28-year-old’s valuation. But, crucially, those sources are not on the Madrid end.\nOne of the requirements Manchester City had was to get a higher buy-out clause at the end of the loan, as it could be used as a starting point for negotiations over a potential deal next summer. And Bayern Munich inserted a €70m option to buy at the end of the deal, which got the deal done over the line.\nReal Madrid, however, insist no formal offer was even placed, despite admitting contact from the player’s agent to inform them of Cancelo’s availability. Club sources, who remain anonymous to protect their roles, add they were priced out with the figures involved and felt comfortable staying with the same squad for the remainder of the season, as their transfer strategy focuses on getting younger players to the club.\nAdvertisement\nSome at Madrid even questioned whether rumours about an offer from their side were a manoeuvre to force up Cancelo’s price.\nLa Liga leaders Barcelona were also offered Cancelo on loan but they could not afford to register the player’s wages within the salary limit La Liga has set for them.\nPol Ballus, Guillermo Rai, Mario Cortegana\nBrighton, Newcastle and Leeds expected to join Chelsea on US tour\nPlans are gradually coming together for a pre-season tournament in America involving six Premier League clubs at the end of July.\nThe Athletic has previously identified Chelsea as one of the competing clubs.\nNewcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and Leeds United — pending their survival from the threat of relegation — are expected to be among the teams joining them in a series of round-robin friendlies on the east coast of the US in Philadelphia, Atlanta and New Jersey.\nThe tournament, first revealed in the David Ornstein column in October, is part of the Premier League’s drive for further global expansion.\nThe absence of a major men’s international tournament this summer means the US audience should get to see stars such as Argentinian World Cup winners Enzo Fernandez (Chelsea) and Alexis Mac Allister (Brighton) as preparations gather pace for co-hosting the 2026 World Cup with Canada and Mexico.\nBrighton were already intending to spend part of Roberto De Zerbi’s first pre-season as head coach on the east coast of America, irrespective of a tournament invitation.\nBoehly, Staveley and Arnold’s quick catch-up\nThey’re already used to competing for players, Champions League places and trophies but that doesn’t mean the hierarchies of Manchester United, Chelsea and Newcastle United can’t get along.\nIn fact, before Thursday’s Premier League shareholders meeting of all 20 clubs started, Richard Arnold, the Manchester United chief executive, met with Newcastle United’s Amanda Staveley and Todd Boehly, Chelsea’s co-owner, for refreshments. Arnold picked up the tab.\nAdvertisement\nWhat they talked about, we do not know, but it would have been their only chance that day to discuss Manchester City’s impending legal battle with the Premier League’s independent commission as the topic was perhaps surprisingly not raised.\nCity are alleged to have breached more than 100 rules relating to alleged financial irregularities between 2009-10 and 2017-19 and failing to cooperate with an investigation since 2018.\nThe Premier League hosted chief executives and owners at The Churchill in London, where they spent Thursday and Friday discussing the top flight’s long-term strategy.\nEven though it was new Premier League chairwoman Alison Brittain’s first strategy meeting, she had previously written to all 20 clubs and had met them on an individual basis after starting her role in January.\nUkraine charity in talks with Arsenal and Chelsea\nFootball for Ukraine, the charity that was set up in the United Kingdom to help people affected by the war, is in early talks with Arsenal and Chelsea about staging a match in June.\nFormer Chelsea player Andriy Shevchenko and current Arsenal defender Oleksandr Zinchenko are heavily involved with the charity — helping to set it up — and it is expected June’s charity match will be a star-studded occasion.\nInitial talks have taken place about either Stamford Bridge or the Emirates Stadium hosting the fixture.\nBrighton-Everton switch for family reasons\nThe latest player recruitment staff departure from Brighton was out of the club’s hands, writes Andy Naylor.\nLee Sargeson has joined Everton as manager of scouting operations after five and a half years as Brighton’s senior scouting manager. Sargeson, who is based in the north of England, has made the switch for family reasons.\nHe worked previously for Bolton Wanderers and for three years as first-team scouting manager at Aston Villa. Brighton will appoint a replacement.\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Sam Richardson)",
