  "body_text": "Philadelphia Union head coach Jim Curtin is basically part of the furniture at the Sheraton Sand Key Resort in Clearwater, Florida.\nThe Union have made the hotel its preseason base for years now, but Curtin’s history in the area goes back even further. Curtin played in Major League Soccer during some of its leaner years and endured many a preseason camp at the nearby Shorewalk Villas, a resort that served as home base for an endless series of youthful misadventures.\nAdvertisement\nNowadays, Curtin’s preseasons are decidedly tamer. As a head coach, his schedule is pretty full and he passes the little free time he has playing darts at a local watering hole with a handful of other MLS coaches, including his former assistant Pat Noonan, now head coach of FC Cincinnati. Tonight, Curtin is parked at the bar at the Sheraton, where he’s agreed to an hour-long sitdown over a few drinks.\nThe past couple of years have been very good to Curtin. His 2022 Union were among the league’s greatest-ever teams, setting records for defensive and offensive dominance. They lost a heartbreaking MLS Cup final to LAFC — Curtin says he still hasn’t rewatched the game — but managed to retain the core group that got them there and have added new pieces, as well.\n“I don’t mind talking about it,” Curtin says about the loss to LAFC. “It’s real life. I lived it. But this final, I’ll never watch it again. I know what happened. I was there.”\nAnd Curtin, once perceived as just another former MLS player-turned coach, is now talked about in far more glowing terms, even mentioned as a potential U.S. men’s national team coaching staff hire. He’s also in the last year of his deal with the Union and remains a viable target for any number of clubs, at home and abroad.\nOn this night, though, Curtin is sitting at the bar at the Sheraton Sand Key, Budweiser in hand and very much ready to get home after over two weeks in a hotel.\nQuestions and answers have been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nFirst and foremost, our condolences for your loss.\nIt was tough for us, yeah. But you still want to play in those types of games, you know? You’d rather be those teams than the Detroit Lions or Atlanta Hawks.\nOh, we were actually talking about the Eagles. You’re a big Eagles fan, no?\nAh. The Eagles and us man, our games were both close. That’s the thing about a final. Both teams are freaking good. You’re in the final, tactics, coaching decisions, there’s a million things that go into it but you need a little bit of luck too. We didn’t get lucky in our game and the Eagles didn’t get lucky either. But the city’s fallen in love with us. You might not understand this but the old-school sports talk radio in our city used to be pretty traditional. Eagles only. They have me calling in regularly now. It’s been wild to be a small part of it.\nAdvertisement\nYeah, we were shocked when the Union were mentioned alongside the Eagles and Phillies when it comes to lost championships this year… Is that some perverse form of progress for MLS?\nIt was awesome, man. It was awesome. As hard as it was, it is an amazing step forward that we were brought up in every graphic, from SportsCenter to whatever. I saw during the pregame of the Super Bowl, they listed the Phillies, and they also listed the Union. There’s Daniel Gazdag there, on Fox, in the lead-up to the Super Bowl. You’re kinda going like… ‘what the hell is going on?’ It’s different. I think it’s great for the league. But you’re right, as much as it hurts to be part of all of these heartbreaking losses, soccer being included in that discussion is a step forwards.\nIt’s a little bizarre, honestly — it felt like you guys were a bit of an afterthought for a while in Philadelphia.\nA lot of people put in a ton of work to get that done, from the front office to the playing side, but it did become the cool thing to do in the city. That’s the thing I’d never see in my life. In the summer months, when we were winning games, you’d look around (and Villanova head men’s basketball coach) Jay Wright is there and he’s involved and wants to meet us. 76ers are there, Eagles are there. I never in my wildest dreams would think they’d come out to the stadium.\nWe don’t have a 50,000-seat stadium, either. The atmosphere is created by the fans. They have to be loud to give us a real advantage there. It might not have some of the bells and whistles of some of the new stadiums but it almost has like — not quite a Wrigley Field, but maybe it’s MLS’ Wrigley Field. It’s a ballpark. It’s cool.\nWhat’s the ceiling for a team like the Union? You could go out and win MLS Cup three times in a row and many would still just be like ‘it’s just the Union.’ You’ll never be LAFC, or Atlanta, or even Miami. Can you guys be a glamor team?\nIf you asked every GM and player in MLS right now ‘in the last five seasons, who has the most points?’ I bet nobody would say us. And it’s us. We have the most points, by a pretty wide margin. We’re not sexy, we’re not flashy, there’s not a guy on our roster that’s super marketable. You know, there’s a “s–tty coach.” We kind of do it in a very Philly, blue-collar way.\nLike you said, though, the club has resonated. The conference semifinal (vs FC Cincinnati) and the conference final (vs NYCFC) were nuts. That stadium has become an intimidating place to play.\nI think so. This is the most I’ll brag about my club tonight — we’re authentic. No knock on Atlanta, but if you check the drivers licenses at an Atlanta United game, they’re from all over the place because that’s just the place to party. You’ve got 50,000 people getting together to party. My dad sat next to a few and they were great people but they were just like ‘we’re SEC football guys and we’re just here because we heard this is a great party.’ What they’ve done is amazing, there.\nBut we’re kind of authentic and we did it kind of slowly. The city was with us along the ride, and through the hard times, too — our fans literally got one of our presidents fired. They’re part of the growth. I’m proud of it. Our crowd is a real crowd.\nAdvertisement\nHas your job as a head coach in MLS changed over the years? Is it more difficult? You have to be prepared for a pretty wide range of styles of play.\nHere at the Union I had Earnie Stewart as sporting director, who was all about having the ball, very Dutch. A version of a 4-3-3. Pretty. He wants it to look pretty. Now Earnie moves to U.S. Soccer, (Union Sporting Director) Ernst (Tanner) comes in and is the direct opposite. He says “I don’t want the ball. They can have the ball. It’s a game of mistakes, let’s force a turnover and be ruthless in transition.” Which is another way to play. That’s the beauty of the game. I got to learn both of those things. I like a blend of the two.\nI think you have to be realistic, too. If we’re gonna line up and go toe-to-toe with a team like LAFC and we say “one-on-one matchups all over the field,” we’re probably gonna lose. And our players know that. We can’t be brave and pass out of the back in those games. What we have to do is let them come a bit, leave space for us to counter and then turn them over and hit them quickly. You have to be able to adjust to whatever the opponent is.\nIs that something that’s unique to MLS?\nThis league is crazy. It’s unpredictable. The coaches are from all over the world now. Think of the Argentine league. The coaches are local. Look at Serie A. They’re pretty much all local. Go to Mexico. Most coaches in those areas all have a similar way of thinking. In MLS? One week I’m going against Patrick Vieira, then the next week against Frank de Boer and the next week Jesse Marsch or Jason Kreis. Insert whoever. And then the climate, and the travel — you play Bob Bradley at LAFC and then Adrian Heath (in Minnesota) and you travel all that way and have to play two guys who see the game completely differently. It’s complicated. I’m not saying it’s the best, but it’s so unique.\nCan a dogmatic coach survive here?\nI think if you’re a great enough coach, you can. I happen to think (former Atlanta United head coach) Tata Martino was a great coach, whatever you think of him personally. He was pretty dogmatic. But he had great players and they f–king loved him. Since he left, those players don’t love anyone. The managers who followed him might have been great, but Tata had a way where…they played for him. It was scary. It was f–king terrifying to play Atlanta, when (former Atlanta United midfielder Miguel) Almiron and Josef (Martínez) got going. It was just like “here we go, this is going to be the longest day of my life.”\nYou’ve always commanded a certain level of respect amongst other coaches in the league. You’ve been sort of like… every musician’s favorite band, if you will. But your profile is much higher now.\nI’m in danger of being overrated. I call it the “Scottie Pippen effect.” You go from being like “man, this guy is so underrated” to being like “wait a minute, is he a top-50 basketball player of all time?”\nWell, do you agree with the praise people have thrown your way? Not to turn this into a job interview, but how have you grown as a coach?\nI was given a chance to mess up. Not many pro coaches get a chance to mess up. I made some mistakes. I didn’t know how to handle the media. I was trying to do everything. I didn’t want to delegate anything. It was my first time coaching, it’s my city, my hometown, I didn’t want to let anyone down. I was setting up cones. I was making sure things were organized. Now I’ve realized that if you surround yourself with good people, and you can start to trust them and delegate things, you can say “‘holy s–t, (former Union assistant coach) Pat Noonan runs that better than I do.” At that point you can sit back and start to evaluate. When you’re running everything in a session sometimes you don’t even realize who is playing well, because you’re so focused on it. It was a game changer for me to realize I could delegate that way.\nYou sound pretty level-headed right now but we’ve seen in the past where the “Philly” in Jim Curtin comes out. The Gabriel Heinze row was interesting.\nYou haven’t seen it. Oh God. “Old me” is not good. Jesse Marsch will tell you the real stories. It was bad. I would get in fights constantly. Back then, when I played, I was slow and surrounded by good players. So I had to survive. (Those early 2000s Chicago Fire) teams were crazy, man. I was 21 then. We would go out in Wrigleyville — this was before the era of cell phones. We’d go out after training, go to a Cubs game, go drink afterwards, somebody’s buddy would crack his head open at the Cubby Bear and you’d be like “what the hell is going on.” But I loved that team. I was the young one that they took care of.\nAdvertisement\nWhat do you make of MLS’s new playoff format?\nI’ll start by saying that the last two seasons have been the best playoffs, for the eyeballs. But there are other factors. At the end of the day, my job as a coach is to grow the value of the team. It’s a business. Apple comes in, I think they need “x” amount of games. I think they’re gonna do a great job, but the league had to be a little flexible, creative and crazy, so they had to change it. It’s tough to get to the number (Apple wants.)\nBetween CONCACAF Champions League, regular season, Open Cup, the expanded Leagues Cup and the expanded playoffs, you will play an absolutely insane number of games.\nEven if we don’t make the playoffs, it will still be the most games we’ve probably ever played in a season. I’ll go off-topic and say that I wish the rosters grew a little bit. That would soften the blow a little bit. In terms of a best-of-three series, I think I might get criticized for my opinion…you hate each other’s guts after those three games. They are total battles, it’s almost like a hockey series where it’s just about whoever is still healthy after all of it. That’s probably not the greatest endorsement. Aesthetically it might not be the greatest, but it will create narratives. Apple will want a good guy and a bad guy, a villain and a goat. Something might happen in the first game, like a player gets a red card in the first game and is back in the third game. I’m not endorsing it, but there’s probably a positive in it.\nI mean it sounds interesting?\nWe don’t have enough villains in our league. We have too many nice guys. MLS used to have so many jerks. There were so many a–holes on every team. We may have the closest these days with Jose (Martinez.) Back in the day there were real guys that would kill you. Mike Petke. Joey Franchino? He would just beat you up if he saw you in the tunnel.\nThe Apple deal is obviously a sea change in the way the league gets its content out there. It’s been tough to deal with for some folks who see the old way of doing things getting left behind. What do you make of it?\nThat part of things is hard. A lot of people that grew the league are finding themselves out of work, which is difficult. But I think if you look at the decades of TV data and how hard the league fought for TV ratings, they didn’t really move the needle a ton. You had to take a risk. The league is taking a smart, calculated risk. I have been pro-Apple from the start. Solely for this reason: Apple doesn’t lose. They will adjust and adapt and they believe in MLS. And that’s a powerful thing.\nAnd they can sell their products. I have three children at home and when I look at my app bill, things for Apple that just pop up, I have no idea what they are. They’re good at selling subscriptions. They can shoot out to 800 million or however-many people in one little push notification.\nAnd it’s global. What if you randomly end up with a huge fan group in China?\nDon’t think it hasn’t been discussed on all rosters in MLS right now, finding certain markets and tapping into that. We’re one of them. If you can hit a home run on an up-and-coming Japanese or Chinese player that fits your style and what you believe in, it would be huge.\nWhat teams and coaches do it right, globally and locally? Meaning, you like the way they play, all of that.\nWhen people ask me what teams I like to watch, I don’t say Bayern Munich or Man City. Because I know how good they are and I respect how good they are, but it doesn’t relate to what we’re trying to do here. I’ll look at a team like Brentford. I’ll look at what they’re doing there in their recruitment, their coaching, how they play. I look for smaller teams that are punching above their weight because that’s us. We’re not gonna go buy all the best.\nAdvertisement\nIn our league? I like Steve Cherundolo at LAFC. He navigated a lot of things behind the scenes that people don’t see. It’s not easy when ownership wants eight or nine new players coming in at the end of the season. I thought Wilfred Nancy did an amazing job in Montreal. He’s another one who learned from five or six coaches and gathered a lot of different ideas. I think he’ll do well in Columbus pretty quickly. To have a beer, though? Adrian Heath.\nPat (Noonan) and Dom (Kinnear) will have Cincinnati flying, I think. That team is going to take off like a rocket. Nashville is a pain in the ass to play against. There are just so many damn teams now. I find myself having to look at the league standings to answer this question.\nWe saw your podcast appearance where you said you’d leave the Union to be a USMNT assistant. What about you would translate well to the national team?\nWhoever gets in there now has to preach simplicity. Don’t over-complicate it. We have really talented players. They don’t need a ton of information right now and a super-detailed style of play. For lack of a better way to put this, I’d sort of revert to the Bruce Arena approach — put the best eleven guys out there and get the f— out of the way, they’ll figure it out. That is what the team needs right this minute.\nI don’t know whether it’s what the team will need in four years, but they need a period where they’re allowed to play together. Pick your key guys and stay out of the way. People always ask about Brendan Aaronson, what did I do (to aid his development)? I didn’t do s—. I just said “go out there and have fun and play.” He was a creative player. In this country we treat players like robots too much and end up producing players who are average at everything. We need specialists. That’s what wins at the highest level. We had nothing like that at this past World Cup.\nWhat’s the ideal profile of the next USMNT head coach?\nI’ll get laughed at and made fun of for saying this but I think the sport of soccer is going to move more in the direction of multiple coaches on the sidelines. Look at this college basketball game (on TV, in front of us.) You’ve got 16 coaches out there practically for like 12 players. We have 11 players on the team and I have myself and two assistants. You are always going to need a head coach. No question. You’re gonna need an offensive guy, a defensive coach. A transition coach who just works on transitions. That way, when we get to the World Cup and we say “ok our offense was good, our transitions were excellent, get rid of the defensive coordinator, he’s gone.” That accountability is the way it should go.\nRandom question, I know, but do you think the current iteration of the U.S. national team is better, on paper, than that 2002 squad which made the World Cup quarterfinals?\nEven if you go back to 2002, a lot of those guys were playing at big clubs in Europe. They were captains. John O’Brien was the captain at Ajax. Say what you will about Brian McBride, he was a specialist. He could use his head better than anyone in the world. Eddie Lewis could cross the ball better than anyone. Tony Sanneh was a lockdown defender. The goalkeepers were elite. Cherundolo was an American captaining Hanover in Germany.\nYes, the pool is deeper but the only thing that matters (in a vacuum) is your best XI. That’s it. Does it matter that you have 40 good ones? I’d rather have eleven players that separate themselves so much. I’ll throw out a bench player from 2002. Joe Max-Moore was on the bench at that tournament. Try and play against him in his prime. He scored goals for Everton.\nAdvertisement\nWhat’s a realistic expectation for 2026?\n2026 has to be our furthest ever. Otherwise it’s a failure. It’s really frigging hard. I’m not trying to oversimplify things, but in our country, with the talent that we think we have, it kind of has to be the furthest-ever or it will be deemed a failure.\nHow impactful could 2026 actually be on club soccer in the United States?\nAmericans are a-holes. We only want to support what we’re the best at. We are not the best at soccer. If we go on a deep run in that competition, I do think it would have a real impact on MLS. My meathead football friends will say “well f—, we just upset France, maybe I’ll give these guys a little credit, maybe this sport is a real sport.” We saw it in Philly getting to the final this year. When we walk around the city now, Jakob Glesnes, myself, whoever, the amount of South Philly “Broad Street Bully”-types are like “great run, we’re proud of you.” They love that s—.\nI see all the young kids in my neighborhood wearing soccer stuff. Not just Manchester United stuff, Union stuff. I think that’s really cool. If we succeeded in 2026? That element would explode. Maybe I’m drinking the Kool-Aid of the league, but it’s getting good man. And the people are involved, the men and women that own teams now? They do not lose. They will shove it down people’s throats until it works.\nDoes MLS need Messi?\nMessi moves the needle. Nobody would care if a great center back that we all love got signed. It’d be amazing for us, but Messi is global. He’s a unique one. He’d be way bigger than Beckham, for me.\nHere’s an incredibly dumb question that we’re going to ask you anyways. What do you make of “Ted Lasso?”\nI have to say I like it, because if I say I hate it I’m some elitist coach. I love the humanness of it. I watched the whole first season. I give them credit for being at least close to capturing the feeling in the locker room. They get that there are people from different cultures, assholes, nice guys, there are wives who are annoying who are problems. That’s all real. He comes off as loveable.\nDo I think it’s set back the American coach 20 years? Yes, I do. We worked so hard to get to Europe and then Jesse kind of breaks in and it’s like… what a curse to have that show break out at the same time he’s there. You can feel it with (Jesse.) He seems so angry at it but to go back to my earlier point, if you show that they’ll chew you up and spit you out.\nAlright, how about “Welcome to Wrexham?”\nI’ve actually connected with (“Welcome to Wrexham” co-creator) Rob (McElhenney.) He was actually the manager of the soccer team (at his high school.) We’ve connected a few times and as recently as their most recent FA Cup game, he texted me afterwards.\n(Curtin pulls out his phone and navigates to his text thread with McElhenny)\nAdvertisement\nHe says “I love/hate this shit so much.” Those guys are genuine and kind of passionate which is cool. You can’t argue with what they did with their show, they’ve handled it in a pretty clever way and they’ve gotten a lot of eyeballs on their team. Their team is good. You watch them play, they play the right way, they’re winning games.\nIs there any part of you that’s frustrated by the fact that a show like that can drive interest to a team like Wrexham, but MLS teams are still struggling for relevance? Does MLS need that element? Would an all-access Union thing work?\nI think people would love that. And it comes down to how much access the coaches really give. Do they become comfortable enough with the cameras on to have a real, hard conversation or do they talk differently? You can tell pretty quickly with those shows which seasons are going to work and which ones are guys just faking it. It would have to go back to the authentic thing. We’re going to try a version of it. There’s cameras in all of our meetings now filming the real stuff.\nHow did you become the MLS Fit God? Honestly. It’s baffling. No offense.\nI’m not. I’m not. I swear I’m not that.\nWho gives you your fashion guidance?\nI’m lucky to know some folks in Philly, a couple of local Philly streetwear companies that have helped out. I’ve gotten in trouble with the league, because they want Adidas. I’m clear on the shoes, I can wear Nikes because Nike wound up giving me a contract there.\nI’m just trying to promote the normal local Philly guys who have been grinding and working and making really cool stuff. I’ll wear their stuff on the sidelines to show them a little love.\nThe final last year vs. LAFC, as a neutral, was really cool.\nHmm, yeah it was.\nYou have no interest in revisiting the match, I know. It was messed up from your perspective because in the end, it had to be Gareth Bale.\nSoccer gods do exist because Bale scores that goal. he scores against the USA (at the World Cup), and then I’m sitting here in the first week of preseason in our Clearwater hotel and I have to watch Gareth Bale golf. Like, he’s golfing! This m———– is just rubbing it in and he’s a hell of a golfer. I’d probably love to hang out with him, but I’ll hate his guts for the rest of my life. That’s the beauty of the sport, you know?\nAdvertisement\nWhat happens to the Union when you move on? What happens to the project?\nIt’ll always be a huge part of my life and of my coaching career. Some of the memories that we’ve created with the fans have been some of the best that I’ll ever…it can only get so good, you know? And they were really great memories.\nYou’re part of the club’s identity.\nYeah and it’s cool to feel that way. I still think back to some of the tough years. I was booed by 18,000 people. It’s actually a perfect ego check for anyone. When you think you have all the ideas in this game or that you’re special at all, it has a way of humbling you. You have to explain it to your kids. You have to do a lot of things that make you look at yourself. So I think that makes it this much more enjoyable. I’m not saying it’s why our stadium is the way it is now where we’re all together and really in it together, but I think it’s a piece of why it’s like that and why it’s grown that way.\nAgain, I hope that when people look back 25 years from now, these are considered the golden times of the club. And I think they will be. From that standpoint, I think I’ll be a part of the club in one way shape or form for the rest of my life. I still don’t think my job’s done yet. I think I still have work to do.\nThere’s been interest from other clubs in the league that is flattering and nice. There’s been even interest from some teams in the good leagues in Europe recently but I want to be in Philly. I said this to my owner three days ago when we met, and I think he appreciates that and gets it.\n(Photo: Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images)",
