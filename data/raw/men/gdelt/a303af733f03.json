  "body_text": "It feels cruel for everyone associated with the club that a year which has brought such immense highs for Newcastle United ends in such uncertainty.\nThere had been one constant in a 2023-24 season which has been defined by its unpredictability: Newcastle’s dominant home form. There were eight wins in nine and six clean sheets in seven. But now that Nottingham Forest have exposed cracks in what had seemed an impenetrable Fortress St James’ Park in its final fixture of 2023, where do Newcastle go next?\nAdvertisement\nEddie Howe’s November 2021 appointment was the shrewdest of all post-takeover decisions; the head coach rapidly expedited Newcastle’s progress to take them into the Champions League inside one full season. But, having exited Europe entirely and been knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the space of a week this month, Newcastle have won just two of their past nine fixtures. It is their worst run under Howe since his first two months in charge.\nManchester United’s envious glances towards Dan Ashworth, Newcastle’s director of football, after Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s 25 per cent investment went through over the weekend also inject further doubt at the most unwelcome moment.\nWhile Howe admitted to “an uncomfortable feeling” at overseeing such a difficult patch — and despite the unknown of how Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Newcastle’s majority stakeholders, will react to such a downturn — there has only been internal support from the club’s British-based co-owners.\nStill, it is eight defeats at the halfway point of the Premier League season — they had lost only once at the same point in 2022-23 — and, given Newcastle’s ambitions, pressure is growing as they head into what looks to be a daunting January fixture list.\nA trip to Anfield is followed by the first Wear-Tyne derby since 2016 — FA Cup third-round defeat against Championship neighbours Sunderland appears unthinkable — and then a home clash with Manchester City, before a visit to Aston Villa.\nNo top-flight side has such a disparity between their performances at home and away. There has been little to suggest Newcastle’s fortunes on their travels will improve imminently, so they must keep collecting points at St James’, but they will not do that if their defensive frailties remain so obvious.\nGO DEEPER\nThe Briefing: Newcastle 1-3 Nottingham Forest - Chris Wood returns to haunt his former side\nOn Boxing Day last year, Chris Wood scored to send Newcastle on their way to victory at Leicester City and up to second in the Premier League. Howe was even asked about their chances of winning the title.\nAdvertisement\nFast-forward to Boxing Day 2023 and Wood left Tyneside with the match ball after a hat-trick. But that treble came for Forest and represented three times the number of goals Wood scored at the stadium during his 12 months as a Newcastle player.\nAfter being signed for an eye-watering £25million (now $32.8m) from Burnley, Wood scored five goals across 39 appearances, 18 of which came at home.\nHowe always maintained that Wood was invaluable to Newcastle’s 2021-22 survival as a top-flight side, even if he was never prolific. Wood’s durability was important, given fellow striker Callum Wilson’s fragility.\nWilson remains susceptible to injury, while Alexander Isak, the club’s record signing up front, has also had periods out. That is why another forward is looking increasingly necessary in January.\nWorryingly, as dependable as Wood was when leading the line at Newcastle, outpacing defences is not what he is renowned for. So the way he got in behind a back four who had the joint-best top-flight defensive record in 2022-23 but were playing together for just the sixth occasion this season, and the first time since September 24, was alarming.\nAnthony Elanga’s speed terrorised Dan Burn — who was hooked after 55 minutes, but perhaps should have been stood down at half-time — while Morgan Gibbs-White expertly conducted Forest’s brutally efficient counter-attacking strategy. With Sven Botman also struggling to recover when Forest got in behind, the Dutchman was among the players ushered back from injury out of necessity, and Kieran Trippier continuing to labour, Newcastle appeared vulnerable.\nNick Pope’s absence has exacerbated that. Pope excels as a sweeper-keeper and can cover in behind Newcastle’s high back line, whereas stand-in Martin Dubravka’s indecision when coming off his line means there is significant space for opponents to exploit should they beat the press.\nControl is also an issue. Newcastle failed to manage the defeat against Liverpool here in September, nor this month’s AC Milan reversal. Against Forest, there were 25 “fast breaks” — defined by Opta as an attempt created after the defensive team quickly turns defence into attack after winning the ball in their own half, or a counter-attack. There were 12 for Newcastle and 13 against — which suggests undesirable disorder.\nAdvertisement\nIn attack, Howe rightly lamented Newcastle’s poor “decision-making”, with the final pass often elusive, which is becoming a recurring theme. Isak did not manage a touch until the 15th minute and, while he converted a 23rd-minute penalty, that was Newcastle’s first shot, and the Sweden international was not brought into the game often enough.\nMiguel Almiron was a chief culprit. The Paraguayan was another withdrawn early, but only after his stray pass in the Forest area started the counter-attack which led to the equaliser. Had Almiron scored, Forest would surely not have recovered from two down.\nInstead, Newcastle soon fell behind — and they have not come back to win a match yet this season.\nStrangely, there were none of the club’s summer signings in the starting XI and, while Sandro Tonali’s suspension and Harvey Barnes’ long-term injury have exacerbated that, the business Newcastle conducted during the off-season continues to be questionable. Such scrutiny is pertinent, particularly given the winter window that opens next Monday may be required to save Newcastle’s season.\nA goal-scoring attacker — be it an out-and-out striker or a versatile option who can usurp Almiron and lighten the load on Anthony Gordon, who has had to take on a punishing workload — must be a priority. Another goalkeeper, be it a new No 1 or short-term cover for Pope, is looking increasingly desirable. Ideally, a midfielder and a centre-half would also arrive, yet financial fair play (FFP) constraints mean Newcastle cannot just spend as they please in what is a notoriously tricky month to conclude business.\nNewcastle still have time to rescue their season. If there is a perverse positive from being knocked out of two cup competitions, it is that their fixture list will ease in the new year, offering Howe greater time to address issues on the training pitch.\nNewcastle’s first team have not held full-paced sessions together since September, and they are the environment in which Howe excels most. He has extracted so much from this squad, which is why Newcastle’s landscape has shifted so dramatically under him, and he can do so again.\nAdvertisement\nThese final weeks of 2023 do not diminish Howe’s remarkable achievements on Tyneside so far. But, just as he warned his players that “no amount of credit in the bank is big enough”, Howe recognises that wins are required, and quickly, if Newcastle are going to start 2024 well and salvage their season.\n(Top photo: Owen Humphreys/PA Images via Getty Images)",
