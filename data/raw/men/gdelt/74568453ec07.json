I’m devastated for him because he’s really impressed me in his time, not just the game at Charlton but how he’s trained.\n‘Rob Sanchez came on, made a fantastic punch with one of the few balls they put into our box. And hopefully Filip can get better really, really quick.’\nRosenior simply replied ‘no’ when asked whether he knew what the injury was or when he expected Jorgensen to be back available.\nSanchez’s form for Chelsea has been a talking point for well over a year, with a number of pundits questioning whether he is of the quality required to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world.\nThe Spaniard made two errors in Chelsea’s Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg defeat to Arsenal in what was only Rosenior’s second game in charge of the Blues.\nWhile Sanchez’s inconsistent shot-stopping has been an issue, his ability with his feet may also be a problem under Rosenior, who likes his teams to play out from the back when they can.\nFor a long time it looked as though Champions League minnows Pafos could frustrate Chelsea and potentially even cost them a spot in the top-eight, the places that advance straight to the knockout stages.\nBut Caicedo popped up with the crucial winner and Rosenior was full of praise for the Chelsea midfielder after the game.\n‘I was delighted for Moises Caicedo to get the goal and the win we deserved,’ the former Strasbourg and Hull City manager said.\n‘Moi is an outstanding player, a world class midfield player. We are always a threat on set plays. He is a top player.\n‘When you play against a low block your pivot players play higher up and hopefully he can continue chipping in with goals. Of course you want to score more goals but the reality is we are in the top eight.\nMore Trending\n‘We have to keep focusing on the job and that is to win as many games as possible. I can’t affect how people judge me but I am very excited for the future of this club.\n‘I would the fans to be with us and with me but to do that I need to earn that.’\nChelsea’s Champions League fate will be decided next week when they travel to Italy to face Napoli, managed by their former boss Antonio Conte.\nBefore that the Blues, currently sixth in the Premier League, return to domestic action with a London derby against Crystal Palace.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard praises Mikel Arteta over ‘extremely clever’ Arsenal transfer\nMORE: Chelsea and England star Cole Palmer linked with shock Premier League transfer\nMORE: Steven Gerrard backs Liverpool star to reach ‘another level’ after Champions League win",
