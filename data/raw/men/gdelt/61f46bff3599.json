Those two victories were more than they had achieved in the competition in their previous 22 matches.\nFind out much more about PSV, including their history, stadium and star players\nWhat the managers say\nBosz: \"We are not going to field a completely different team against Arsenal, but you have to allow boys who do well from the bench to play. Tomorrow is the opportunity for that.\"\n“I know that we are better than [the game in September], but what matters to me is whether we have learned from that match. Ultimately, the stadium will be full again and we want to make our supporters proud. That is perhaps the most important point.”\nArteta: \"It's really impressive how [PSV] play, the consistency, the way they are winning football matches. They’ve been extremely dominant, not only this season but last season as well and huge credit to the manager, the coaching staff and players for what they’ve done.\n\"When you look at the record that they have here, it’s incredible so we’re going to have to be really good tomorrow to beat them.\" - read every word from Mikel’s pre-match press conference\nTeam news\nWith qualification assured for both teams, it has been suggested that Arteta and Bosz will opt to rotate their players for this game. What is for certain though is that we will once again be without Takehiro Tomiyasu, Thomas Partey, Emile Smith Rowe, Fabio Vieira and Jurrien Timber through injury.\nMexican winger Lozano is missing through suspension after picking up three bookings during the group stage, while young striker Noa Lang, Armel Bella-Kotchap and Jordan Teze missed their last league encounter at Heerenveen on Thursday, with the latter most likely to be fit enough if his manager deems it worthy enough to play him in this dead rubber.\nTalking tactics\nAdrian Clarke: Bosz does not spend a great deal of time focusing on negating his opponents’ strengths. Instead he wants his team to play a brand of fearless, attacking football. PSV will always start in either a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1, with a heavy emphasis on raiding down the flanks at pace because they boast an array of exciting wide men. Highly rated Belgian Johan Bakayoko is a regular starter on the right wing, with Malik Tillman and Yorbe Vertessen options on the other flank if Lozano and Lang are out.\nOnly two of the 32 group stage clubs have produced more pressed sequences than the Dutch outfit, which shows they like to win the ball back quickly inside the opposition half. They failed to show it in a poor display against us at Emirates Stadium, but Bosz’s side are usually good at disrupting play with their closing down. They prefer his way of defending to keeping a low block.\nJoey Veerman is a quality central midfielder who can deliver terrific set pieces, but it is veteran striker Luuk de Jong [above] who will concern us most. He wins a lot of aerial duels and has scored 12 goals so far this season, as well as supplying six assists.\nWith both sides already through to the last 16, I expect this to be a free-flowing contest that features plenty of skilful attacking football. We should see goals.\nFacts and stats\nWe are winless in our last three major European visits to the Netherlands since a 2-1 win at Ajax in September 2005 in the Champions League.\nPSV are unbeaten on home soil in the Champions League this season, last going a full group stage undefeated at home in 2015/16 under Phillip Cocu, when they won all three games.\nPSV have won their last two Champions League matches, as many as they had in their previous 22 (D9 L11). They last won three in a row in the 2006/07 group stages, in a campaign they would eventually reach the quarter-final after eliminating us.\nWe have scored in each of our last 22 Champions League group stage matches, since a 2-0 loss against Borussia Dortmund in September 2014.\nNo side has netted more Champions League goals than us this season, while only twice have we scored more in a single group stage than their 15 this term (18 in both 2010/11 and 2016/17).\nNoa Lang has been involved in 13 shots following a ball carry in the Champions League this season (9 shots, 4 chances created), second only to Rodrygo (15).\nLuuk de Jong has scored in each of his last six home European matches for PSV (six goals), the longest home scoring run by a PSV player in their major European history.\nWith three goals and four assists, Bukayo Saka has been involved in more Champions League goals than any other player this season. His seven goal involvements is also already the most by an Arsenal player in their debut campaign in the competition.\nGabriel Jesus has scored in all four of his Champions League games for us, and could become the first Gunner ever to score five in a row in the competition.\nMatch officials\nIt is the second time this year that German referee Tobias Stieler will oversee one of our games, after he took charge of his first Gunners game in March when we drew 2-2 in Portugal against Sporting Lisbon.\nThe lawyer, who has been a Bundesliga official since 2012 and was added to the FIFA list two years later, has had two Champions League appointments this season which have seen him dish out an astonishing 20 yellow cards - eight in Sevilla’s 1-1 draw against Lens, and 12 as Feyenoord beat Lazio 3-1.\nReferee: Tobias Stieler (GER)\nAssistant Referee 1: Christian Gittelmann (GER)\nAssistant Referee 2: Mark Borsch (GER)\nFourth Official: Martin Petersen (GER)\nVAR: Christian Dingert (GER)\nAssistant VAR: Tiago Martins (POR)\nPrevious meetings\nWe have faced PSV in competitive action on nine occasions, with seven in the Champions League as well as last season’s two encounters in the Europa League. We have only lost two of those games, but those have come on each of our last two visits to the Philips Stadion.\nThe first was when were drawn against each other in 2006/07 in the round of 16. PSV won the first leg 1-0 at home, before securing a 1-1 draw at Emirates Stadium after Alex scored at both ends to eliminate us from the competition.\nLast season, a Granit Xhaka strike saw us secure a 1-0 win at home, but we fell to a 2-0 loss a week later out in Eindhoven when Joey Veerman and de Jong netted, however we would still go on to win our group.\nBack in September, we ran riot upon our return to the Champions League with Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus and Leandro Trossard all scoring before half-time, and Martin Odegaard added a fourth to make it a night to remember at Emirates Stadium.\nHow to watch\nLog onto Arsenal.com and the official app an hour before kick-off for a comprehensive pre-match build-up on Breakdown Live!\nNick Bright and Jeremie Aliadiere will be in the studio looking back at the weekend's game against Aston Villa and the positives we can take going forward, while they'll also look back at a momentous weekend for our women's and under-18 sides.\nThey'll also take a look at our opponents and assess the game at the Philips Stadion, and then from 5.45pm UK time, live commentary comes from Max Jones and David Hillier as they take you through our final European match of 2023.\nYou can also find out which broadcasters are showing the game wherever you are in the world.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
