  "body_text": "To call Manchester United’s season underwhelming would be a dramatic understatement. It’s been nothing short of disastrous – unquestionably the club’s worst campaign in the modern era.\nUnited’s 2-0 defeat to West Ham last Sunday left the club in 16th place, just two places above the relegation zone. The Red Devils have yet to hit 40 points with two games left to play.\nEven if United were to win their final two matches – an extremely unlikely scenario considering they’re up against Chelsea and Aston Villa respectively – they can finish no higher than 13th position. This is five places worse off than their previous lowest finish in the league – eighth in 2023/24 under Erik ten Hag.\nUnited have suffered 17 league defeats overall, which is the most they’ve tasted in a league campaign since 1973/74 (20), when they were relegated to the second division. Nine of these losses have come at home.\nYet despite these shocking numbers, Ruben Amorim and his players still have a chance to end the campaign on a relatively more positive note by winning the Europa League.\nThe 20-time English champions secured their place in the final with a dominant 7-1 aggregate win over Athletic Club. They’ll now face fellow Premier League strugglers Tottenham Hotspur – arguably just as poor, if not worse – at San Mamés in a week’s time.\nThis is, without question, the biggest game of the season and one of the most significant Amorim will oversee as United boss. A win could help paper over some of the domestic shortcomings and would provide a major financial boost ahead of a crucial transfer window. But a loss would cement this season as a complete and utter failure, with the current squad earning a place in the club’s history books, for all the wrong reasons.\nAmorim will therefore need to carefully select an XI that will rise to the occasion and get over the line. The Peoples Person are running a special series where each member selects their ideal starting XI for the upcoming final. It’s worth pointing out that these are dream lineups. They are what we want to see on the pitch and not predicted selections.\nWe already have the XI’s of Alex Browne and Red Billy. Here’s mine:\nGoalkeeper – Andre Onana\nI think Onana picks himself by default. He’s far from the most convincing option, but the alternative, Altay Bayindir, doesn’t inspire much more confidence. The two shot-stoppers have made high-profile errors that have put United in difficult positions, both domestically and in Europe. But Onana remains the number one and hopefully, he’s up for it on the day and cuts out the howlers. It’s worth noting that the Cameroonian has lost every European final he’s featured in so far. It’s something he will be desperate to change.\nBack Three – Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire and Leny Yoro\nMazraoui has shown himself to be United’s best option on the right side of the three-man defence. He’s not only solid defensively but also has a knack for pushing forward and contributing to possession, adding an extra dimension to the team’s play.\nMaguire has been a crucial piece for United in their Europa campaign. He scored a dramatic extra-time winner against Lyon to send United to the final four and also came up with an inspired moment of attacking genius to set up Casemiro’s goal in the first leg vs. Athletic. The England international has kicked up a few extra levels under Amorim and finally looks the player United forked out £80m to sign in 2019 from Leicester City. He is an asset on both ends of the pitch and I’m backing him to put on another masterclass at San Mames.\nI’m crossing my fingers that Yoro will be fully fit and available for selection. He sustained an injury against the Hammers but rumours coming out of the club sound positive and it appears there is a real chance he’ll be ready to play. The teenager has been United’s standout defender in recent weeks, displaying remarkable calm and poise for someone still adjusting to senior football. United are undeniably a stronger outfit with him on the pitch.\nWing Backs – Amad and Patrick Dorgu\nAside from Bruno Fernandes, Amad is arguably United’s most impactful player. He’s a game-changer, always making things happen. The Ivorian is a constant threat and will undoubtedly cause all sorts of problems for the Tottenham defence. He’s a nightmare to deal with when he’s in his flow state, which is pretty much all the time. Amad will make United’s right flank a much more dangerous and dynamic attacking avenue.\nDorgu is clearly United’s best left-wing-back. While Luke Shaw can play there, Amorim seems to prefer him as a left-sided centre-back. Shaw’s performances since returning haven’t been convincing, and for me, Dorgu offers a more reliable option on that side. United will need to work hard and be aggressive against Tottenham. Dorgu brings exactly that. He’s not afraid to push forward and deliver balls into the box, even when things don’t always click. His energy and attacking intent will be key to breaking down Ange Postecoglou’s team.\nMidfield Pivot – Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro\nThere’s not much that needs to be said about Fernandes. He’s United’s best player by a country mile. If they’re to beat Tottenham, he’ll almost certainly be at the heart of it. Nearly everything flows through him, whether he’s operating in a deeper pivot role or further forward. Personally, I prefer him a bit deeper, where he can influence the game more and help with ball progression.\nCasemiro has been United’s main man in the Europa League, and it’s only fitting that he starts in the final. If “resurgent” had a face, it would be his. The veteran midfielder’s remarkable turnaround at Old Trafford has been nothing short of breathtaking. His fingerprints were all over the dramatic comeback against Lyon and he found the back of the net in both legs vs. Bilbao. He has been in European finals several times in his decorated career and his experience will be vital.\nNumber 10s – Alejandro Garnacho and Mason Mount\nThere’s no denying that Garnacho’s finishing has been below par this season, but his raw pace is unmatched in the current squad. Few players offer the kind of movement he does, making runs in behind and stretching defences. Against Tottenham’s high line, that speed could be a real weapon and a key area United can exploit to their advantage. The Argentine also tracks back and contributes defensively. He scored in last year’s FA Cup final, so let’s hope he fancies making it a habit. Two in two would do nicely, wouldn’t it?\nMount has been United’s main source of goals lately, finding the net against Brentford and, of course, delivering that unforgettable brace which effectively slammed the door shut on Athletic’s Europa League hopes. The former Chelsea ace looks sharper and hungrier. He’s already been on the biggest stage – the Champions League final – so a Europa League final won’t rattle him in the slightest. Mount doesn’t just have an engine. He’s got two lungs and seems to run on rocket fuel. After an underwhelming start to life at United, you could say he owes the club one. This would be the perfect time to repay that debt.\nStriker – Rasmus Hojlund\nPlease bear with me for a minute here. We’re all familiar with Hojlund’s struggles, and my views on him are no secret. Most of the time, having him on the pitch feels like playing with a man down. But what’s the alternative?\nAt the moment, Joshua Zirkzee is sidelined and is in a race against time to be fit for the final. The Dutchman is on the record saying he’s working tirelessly to make it back, but realistically, it’s a long shot. And even if he does pull off a timely return, he’d be lacking match fitness. You don’t want someone shaking off the rust in a final. It’s just too big a gamble.\nChido Obi is ineligible to play in the Europa League because he wasn’t registered.\nAmorim could deploy a false nine but the last time he experimented with this – using Kobbie Mainoo up front – it backfired spectacularly. Trying out relatively unfamiliar tactics in such a high-stakes game probably isn’t the smartest move. Hojlund is the only realistic choice and United will have to live and die by this selection. I don’t like it in the slightest but it’s where we are.\nIf you’re looking for some positivity, Hojlund has notched six goals in the Europa League. That’s two more than he’s registered in the 30 Premier League appearances he’s made this term.\nHaving said all that, here’s my selection for next week’s starting XI:\nFeatured image Michael Steele via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
