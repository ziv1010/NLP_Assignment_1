  "body_text": "The 11 most expensive goalkeeper transfers of all time and how they fared\nWhile attackers and midfielders often steal the spotlight, football clubs are no longer afraid to splash the cash on top goalkeepers.\nThe role of the modern goalkeeper has changed as they are now expected to be experts with their feet as well as their hands.\nWe’ve taken a look at the 10 most expensive goalkeepers of all time (which is currently a top 11 due to a tie for 10th place) and how they fared after making the big-money move.\nNote: we’ve taken into account any potential add-ons when ranking the transfer fees.\n11= Aaron Ramsdale – £30m\n- Year: 2021\n- From: Sheffield United\n- To: Arsenal\nWhile Ramsdale suffered back-to-back Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United, he also won the Player of the Year award at both clubs during those campaigns.\nHis performances attracted interest from Arsenal, who paid an initial £24million and another £6million in add-ons to secure his signature.\nThe England international usurped Bernd Leno to become Mikel Arteta’s No.1 goalkeeper and was named in the PFA Team of the Year in 2022/23.\nBut he was then replaced by David Raya at the start of the following season and joined Southampton in the summer of 2024 in a deal worth up to £25million, going on to suffer another relegation.\n11= Jordan Pickford – £30m\n- Year: 2017\n- From: Sunderland\n- To: Everton\nPickford enjoyed an impressive breakthrough season at Sunderland in 2016/17 and was shortlisted for the PFA Young Player of the Year award.\nAfter the Black Cats were relegated, he made a swift return to the Premier League and joined Everton in a deal worth an initial £25million and another £5million in add-ons.\nThat fee now looks like a bargain and the England international has won the Everton Player of the Season award in four of his eight seasons at the club.\n9. James Trafford – £31m\n- Year: 2025\n- From: Burnley\n- To: Manchester City\nA Manchester City academy graduate, Trafford joined Burnley in 2023 and spent two years at Turf Moor before returning to the Etihad in a £31million deal.\nThe deal sees the 22-year-old replace both Pickford and Ramsdale to become the most expensive British goalkeeper of all time.\n“Rejoining City is such a special and proud moment both for me and my family,” he said. “I always dreamed that one day I would be able to come back to Manchester City.\n“This is the place I call home – it’s a truly special football club with fantastic people who make it such a unique place to work and play.”\nHowever, shortly after the signing of Trafford, City also added to their goalkeeping department with Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n8= Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m\n- Year: 2019\n- From: Barcelona\n- To: Valencia\nEyebrows were raised when Valencia agreed to pay £31.4million for Cillessen, who had made just five La Liga appearances during his three years at Barcelona.\nThe Netherlands international failed to justify that price tag and his time at the Mestalla was also plagued by a number of injury problems.\nAfter losing his place in the team to Giorgi Mammardashvili in the 2021/22 season, he was then sold to Eredivisie club NEC Nijmegen for just €1million.\n8= Thibaut Courtois – £31.4m\n- Year: 2018\n- From: Chelsea\n- To: Real Madrid\nAfter refusing to sign a contract extension at Chelsea, Courtois completed a £31.4million move to Real Madrid.\nThe Belgium international had a difficult debut season at the Santiago Bernabeu but has since cemented his status as one of the best goalkeepers in the world.\nHe has helped Madrid win three La Liga titles, two Champions Leagues, a Copa del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and the FIFA World Club Cup.\nThe 33-year-old was particularly outstanding in the 2021/22 Champions League triumph, making a record number of saves in the final victory over Liverpool.\nCurrent world no. 1 between the sticks, Thibaut Courtois, turns 31 today!! 🎉\nLet’s run it 🔙 to his phenomenal #UCL winning performance against Liverpool last year… 📽️ pic.twitter.com/Dbq7I0lpMh\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) May 11, 2023\n6. Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m\n- Year: 2001\n- From: Parma\n- To: Juventus\nHaving sold Zinedine Zidane to Real Madrid in the summer of 2001, Juventus splashed the cash and made Buffon the world’s most expensive goalkeeper.\nThe former Italy international proved to be a relative bargain, making 656 appearances in all competitions over the following 17 years while winning nine Serie A titles, Serie B and four Coppa Italia trophies.\nHe said: “If we go back to my signing at Juve, the amount of money they spent on me had every critic saying the exact same thing: ‘No, you can’t pay that much money for a goalkeeper.’\n“And, you know, it’s right that those conversations happen as well. But in the end, I was at Juventus for 17 years. I think that with me, Juve made one of the best pieces of business in their history. If you look at it now, I doubt anyone could disagree with that.”\n5. Ederson – £34.7m\n- Year: 2018\n- From: Benfica\n- To: Manchester City\nBuffon’s 16-year reign as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper came to an end in 2017 when Manchester City signed Ederson from Benfica in a £34.7million deal.\nHe immediately replaced Claudio Bravo in Pep Guardiola’s starting XI and established himself as one of the best ball-playing goalkeepers in the world.\nThe Brazil international is now a six-time Premier League champion, a four-time Carabao Cup winner and a two-time FA Cup winner.\nHe also lifted the Champions League trophy in 2022/23 after producing a brilliant performance against Inter Milan in the final.\nEderson was ultimately sold by City to Fenerbahce in 2025.\nWHAT A SAVE FROM EDERSON!! 🤩\nHas that moment just won them the Champions League…? 👀#UCLfinal pic.twitter.com/NW3wYwYoaD\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) June 10, 2023\n4. Andre Onana – £47.2m\n- Year: 2023\n- From: Inter Milan\n- To: Manchester United\nHaving worked with Onana at Ajax, Erik ten Hag identified the goalkeeper as his top target to replace David de Gea at Manchester United.\nHe arrived at Old Trafford after United agreed to pay Inter Milan an initial £43.8million and an additional £3.4million in add-ons.\nBut over the course of two seasons, the Cameroon international made eight errors leading to goals in all competitions, the most of any goalkeeper playing for a Premier League club.\nHe has faced a lot of criticism and was described as “one of the worst keepers” in the club’s history by former United midfielder Nemanja Matic.\nEventually, he was offloaded to Trabzonspor on a season-long loan in September 2025 after United signed Senne Lammens to replenish their goalkeeping department.\nREAD MORE: Onana only fifth on horror £375m list of most expensive Man Utd flops who left on loan\n3. Lucas Chevalier – £47.7m\n- Year: 2025\n- From: Lille\n- To: PSG\nWith Donnarumma in the final year of his contract, PSG made a powerful move to futureproof with the signing of Chevalier from Lille, where he had been named the Ligue 1 Goalkeeper of the Year for 2024-25.\nChevalier cost €40m (£34.7m) up front, with another €15m later due in add-ons to take the total cost up to €55m (approximately £47.7m).\nThe French keeper made his PSG debut in the UEFA Super Cup against Tottenham, who they beat on penalties, before keeping clean sheets on his first two league appearances for his new club.\n2. Alisson Becker – £65m\n- Year: 2018\n- From: Roma\n- To: Liverpool\nAfter Loris Karius’ nightmare in the 2018 Champions League final, Liverpool brought Alisson to Anfield in a deal worth an initial £56million and £9million in add-ons.\nThe Brazil international has proved a transformative signing for the Reds, helping them win the Champions League, two Premier League titles, the FA Cup, the Carabao Cup and the FIFA World Club Cup.\nHe’s also picked up a host of individual accolades, including the Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award, the Yashin Trophy and two Golden Gloves.\n“If I knew Alisson was this good I would have paid double,” former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp admitted.\n🚫 Alisson Becker denies Barcelona, again & again…#UCL | @LFC pic.twitter.com/PkvBvVDuN1\n— UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) May 14, 2019\n1. Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m\n- Year: 2018\n- From: Athletic Bilbao\n- To: Chelsea\nAfter selling Courtois and missing out on Alisson, Chelsea triggered the £71.6million release clause in Kepa’s Athletic Bilbao contract.\nHe made a string of errors during his first two years at Stamford Bridge and notably had a high-profile row with then-manager Maurizio Sarri during the 2019 League Cup final.\nThe Spain international was demoted to being the back-up goalkeeper after Chelsea signed Edouard Mendy in the summer of 2020.\nHe joined Real Madrid on a season-long loan deal in 2023 and spent the following season on loan at Bournemouth before completing a £5million move to Arsenal.\nREAD MORE: The 10 most expensive transfers in history: Wirtz to Liverpool 6th, no catching Neymar",
