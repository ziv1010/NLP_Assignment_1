Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nEven before Salah’s outburst, Bournemouth star Semenyo was heavily linked with a big-money move to Anfield, with the 25-year-old earning rave reviews for his performances in the Premier League over the last two seasons.\nA release clause in Semenyo’s contract with the Cherries means the Ghana international is available for a fee of £65million for the first two weeks of the January transfer window, which has also put the likes of Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs on red alert.\nBut Sherwood is convinced Semenyo will be on his way to Merseyside as he is the ‘obvious choice’ to fill the void left by Salah.\n‘I think Liverpool will go for Semenyo in January and I think it’s bad news for anyone else who wanted Semenyo. Tottenham were in for him,’ Sherwood said on the No Tippy Tappy Podcast.\nWhat did Salah say? Key quotes from explosive interview\n- On being benched again versus Leeds: 'The third time on the bench, I think for the first time in my career. I'm very, very disappointed to be fair. I have done so much for this club down the years and especially last season. Now I'm sitting on the bench and I don't know why. It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.'\n- On his relationship with Arne Slot: 'I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager and all of a sudden, we don't have any relationship. I don't know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn't want me in the club.'\n- On whether Saturday's game against Brighton could be his last Liverpool game: 'In my head, I'm going to enjoy that game because I don't know what is going to happen now. I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go the Africa Cup (of Nations). I don't know what is going to happen when I am there.'\n- On whether he regrets signing a new contract last season: 'Imagine how bad that I have to answer it, honestly. That hurts, even the question hurts. This club, signing for this club, I will never regret it. I thought I'm going to renew here and end my career here, but this is not according to the plan.'\n- On transfer interest from the Saudi Pro League: 'I don’t want to answer this question, because the club is going to take me to a different direction.'\n‘He works his socks off and I think he’s a player.\n‘There’s never a sure thing, is there? But I think that because he’s been in the Premier League, he’s done the rounds, every time he’s stopped up a level he’s ticked the box.\n‘He’s got power, he’s got pace, he’s perfect on that right-hand side, he’s a team man. I just think a natural.’\nSherwood added: ‘When you bring a player in from outside the Premier League like Florian Wirtz then you just never know and you haven’t got time for them to settle.\n‘I think Semenyo would go straight into the team and he obviously rehearsed very well early on the season, the first game of the season, and he’s cheap.\n‘He’s a young man, he’s got a future there and he’s the obvious choice, which is bad news for the other clubs. Tottenham can forget it.’\nAccording to Sherwood, Salah has badly let himself down and is threatening to ‘tarnish’ his legacy at Liverpool.\n‘Arne Slot decided he wants to make a change for the best of Liverpool Football Club, not for the best of Mohamed Salah, and Salah has to realise that,’ he continued.\n‘This club will always be bigger than any individual so it’s disappointing to see.\n‘Will it tarnish his legacy? I think tarnish is the right word. It won’t destroy it because, for me, he’s genius of a player and I still think he’s got a lot left.\n‘When people say his legs are gone… when you’re old and you have a bad game, you have a bad game because you’re old. You’re allowed to have a bad game! Young players have bad games as well.\n‘He’s still got a lot to offer, whoever takes him, but I think he wants to try and move this forward in January otherwise he wouldn’t have spoken.’\nSherwood hopes Slot is given until the end of the season to turn Liverpool’s fortunes around given what he achieved in his first year in charge.\nMore Trending\n‘Arne Slot isn’t having a good time. He’s got a lot of tools to work with and there’s a lot of players that aren’t performing,’ he went on.\n‘Whatever the reasons are, I still believe that Liverpool give him until the end of the season and I think they will let Salah go if they can find the right price for him.\n‘You cannot let the tail wag the dog and I don’t think Liverpool will ever allow that. They never have in the past and I don’t think they will start now.\n‘Slot isn’t there to babysit the players, he’s there to pick a team to win a football match and Salah is asking him to babysit him at the moment.’\nIs Semenyo the best possible replacement for Salah?\n-\nYes\n-\nNo\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Chelsea receive major transfer boost in pursuit of £70m Premier League star\nMORE: Kobbie Mainoo chooses next club after 12 teams show interest in Man Utd star\nMORE: Patrice Evra reveals his issue with Bruno Fernandes as Manchester United captain",
