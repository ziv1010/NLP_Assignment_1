Rs 8.8 lakh) after fans were found to have used “at least one incendiary device, an act of improper conduct,” in the AFC Champions League qualifier against Al Seeb.Goa were found to be in violation of Article 64 and 65 of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Code. While Article 64 deals with clubs or member association failing to fulfill any of its obligations relating to the organisation of matches, Article 65 relates to improper conduct which includes “letting off incendiary devices, throwing missiles and the use of laser pointers or similar electronic devices.”According to the match commissioner’s report, flares were seen on the East stand after the conclusion of the match, which Goa won 2-1 to make it to the group stage of the AFC Champions League, Asian football’s second tier club competition.In its defence, the club said it was an isolated, celebratory act involving a smoke gun, managed swiftly and without consequence.“The incident did not involve a flare or explosive pyrotechnic, but rather a smoke gun, a non-pyrotechnic device designed solely to emit smoke. Such devices are non-explosive, do not generate flames or sparks, and pose minimal fire or detonation risk,” Goa CEO Ravi Puskur said in the reply to the charge notice.\nEnd of Article\nFollow Us On Social Media",
