Pictured: Jude with his brother Jobe (centre)\nJude Bellingham celebrates with his mother Denise, his father Mark and his brother Jobe after the UEFA Champions League final in June\nMark hung up his boots at the age of 41 in 2017 and is now believed to have retired from the police. He declines to discuss his sons' achievements.\nHe is a Southend United supporter and Jude's first football matches as a boy were with his father to see the Essex team.\nJude told The Guardian in 2020 how his mother took him to watch his father play.\nHe said then: 'It's where I started to get that love for football - I think you can see in the way I play that I've watched the game from a young age.\n'That non-league style of toughness and being gritty when you need to be, I do think that comes from watching my dad play – even though he never tackled!'\nSpeaking about his father to the FA in an interview, Jude also said: 'We talk about footballing heroes, and my dad was like my first.\n'When you go and watch him play every week in non-league, you know it's not the Premier League or anything, but seeing the way that he played and the atmosphere, it made me fall in love with football so he was probably my first hero.\n'After the first few times of going, I'd start to pay a bit more attention to the games and stuff, the atmosphere and he's scoring goals so you see him celebrating and stuff like that - you want that to be me.\n'Growing up, he'd always give me tips on what I could do and now it gets to a certain age and it sort of flips and that's brilliant because we have that sort of relationship like father and son and then as I got older, like coach and player.'\nTrent Alexander Arnold's brothers\nTrent Alexander-Arnold is pictured with his two brothers, Tyler (centre) and Marcel (left)\nFlawless genes are once again on display in the Alexander-Arnold family as defender Trent is one of three brothers.\nTyler, who is three years older than him, is actually his agent and the director of PLG talent agency, which includes names such as Jarrod Bowen and Jordan Henderson in its list of clientele.\nTrent, 25, also has a second brother called Marcel, who is three years younger than him.\nGrowing up, Trent admitted that all three brothers had the same dream to become a professional football player - but that the other two were quick to support him when it emerged he was the most naturally talented.\nAlexander-Arnold previously told The Players' Tribune that all three of the brothers 'had the same dream' growing up.\nHe wrote: 'My brothers weren’t just my brothers, they were my best friends.\n'As I got a bit older, and I moved up through the Liverpool academy, Tyler and Marcel willingly sacrificed their own dreams for mine.\nMarcell Alexander-Arnold (right) is three years younger than his famous brother (pictured together)\n'I think maybe we all realized at a young age that being a professional footballer was more realistic for me. And my parents did, too. That’s a hard thing for a young lad to understand.'\nIn 2019, Tyler and Marcus Rashford's brother Dane were victims of a terrifying raid in Manchester and were attacked by violent armed robbers.\nDuring the raid, Tyler was forced to hand over the keys to his £70,000 Range Rover.\nThe gang were later jailed at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court, which heard that both men were struck over the head with a bat and needed stitches.\nBukayo Saka's brother\nBukayo Saka was pictured with his brother Abayomi at an NBA game earlier this year - a rare shot of the brothers together\nAs England's Bukayo Saka is one of the best wingers in the world, it is no surprise that his brother Abayomi is also a footballing talent.\nArsenal player and forward Saka, 22, is two years younger than Yomi, who was once a member of the Watford Academy, before deciding to focus on his education.\nThe handsome brothers were pictured together earlier this year at an NBA game - in a rare shot of the two of them together - and will be certainly putting England's WAGS to shame at this year's Euros.\nSaka and Yomi grew up together in Greenford London, and Saka has previously described how the family's weekends would revolve entirely around sport - with his Dad taking him to Arsenal, and mum taking Yomi to Watford.\nSaka told Arsenal.com of his family: 'We've always been close and we've always been sporty.'\nHe added: 'From the age of three or four I would be playing football at home in the garden with my dad, and my older brother, Yomi.\n'It was always like that. After school we would eat and then it was straight into the garden to play football. We would play for hours.'\nAfter Yomi decided to give up on his football dreams, he attended Reading University.\nLuke Shaw's brother\nLuke Shaw's brother Ben is becoming famous in his own right, and posts many a swoon-worthy snap to his Instagram feed\nThe Shaw family, including Ben and Luke, are pictured together at Christmas\nLuke Shaw's brother Ben seems to be pretty famous in his own right, boasting nearly 100,000 followers on Instagram.\nAnd it's easy to see why, as Ben has posted many a swoon-worthy snap to his account, and is clearly partial to taking a selfie.\nHe seems to mainly document the holidays he goes on, recently vacationing in Marbella and Mykonos - but pictures with his famous brother are rare.\nAside from the odd Christmas family picture, Ben's main mention of his brother came in 2019 when he congratulated him and his girlfriend Anouska Santos on the birth of their first child in a sweet post.\nHe wrote: 'You’ve created something so beautiful and I’m so proud to say I’m now an uncle and I couldn’t be happier for you both and the family that you have created.'\nBen, who reportedly played football for various club youth teams, now lives in Manchester and works in influencer marketing.\nBen works in talent management and recently launched his own business, called Hush\nBen is said to have played footballer when he was younger but now lives a quieter life in Manchester\nHe launched his talent management business Hush Management earlier this week and has worked in the industry since completing his degree at Manchester Metropolitan University.\nBen is fiercely loyal to his brother Luke - but it has almost landed him in trouble a number of times.\nIn 2016 Ben was forced to deny that he had called Jose Mourinho a c*** on his Twitter account after Luke was dropped out of the Manchester United squad for a defeat by Chelsea.\nScreenshots of the tweets showed messages reading: 'As if Marcus (sic) Rojo takes Luke's place on the bench, I'm sorry but he is useless,' before the profanity.\nHowever the tweets were later deleted and Ben posted another response saying his tweets had been 'photoshopped', warning people not to 'believe everything you see online.'\nAaron Ramsdale's brothers\nRamsdale, who was born in Stoke-on-Trent, has two brothers, Oliver and Edward - who is a prison officer\nAaron Ramsdale, who was born in Stoke-on-Trent, has two brothers, Oliver and Edward - who is a prison officer.\nLast year Aaron Ramsdale vowed not to stay silent when hearing homophobic comments in dressing rooms as he spoke movingly about his 'brave, superstar' gay brother Oliver.\nThe Arsenal and England goalkeeper, 25, is the youngest of three boys - with the eldest, Edward, working as a prison guard and Oliver, his middle brother, performing in the West End.\nThe footballer said he had been called 'brave' for defying his critics, but insisted it was his brother, Oliver, who was the 'brave one' in his family.\n'My brother is gay, and he's lived his life in an open and authentic way since he went off to school,' he wrote in the Players' Tribune.\n'I'm so proud to say he's my brother. I haven't talked about it before, but with everything going on in football right now, I thought it was important to mention.\n'Oliver is a lot like me, in many ways. He's a regular bloke. Loves football. Loves knocking about with his mates.\n'Loves the Gunners. He's proud of me, and I'm really proud of him.'\nIn the article, Ramsdale pledged to no longer remain silent when hearing homophobic comments because he wants his brother to be able to attend matches without fear of abuse or discrimination.\nAaron has stood up for his brother Oliver, who is gay, in the past, condemning homophobic comments in dressing rooms\n'Over the years, I've probably bit my tongue a few too many times - both in dressing rooms and on social media - whenever I hear homophobic comments or stupid things being said,' he wrote.\n'And I think maybe my brother has done the same, thinking it would make my life easier. Well, all that ends today.\n'It's not the easiest thing to be open like this, but there's never a ''right time''. I've been working on this story since the start of the summer, and my family has given me their blessing.'\nHe added: 'I want this game I love to be a safe and welcoming place for everyone. I want my brother, Ollie - or anyone of any sexuality, race or religion - to come to games without having to fear abuse.\n'And when we lift a trophy at the Emirates Stadium, I want my brother there with me. What could the trolls tell us then? Not a thing.'\nOliver has been performing in the West End since 2015, with credits including Cats at the London Palladium and White Christmas.\nDeclan Rice's brothers\nDeclan Rice has two brothers, Jordan (left) and Connor (right)\nAnd if Declan Rice was not handsome enough all on his own, fans will be be ecstatic to find out that he has two brothers, Connor and Jordan.\nDeclan grew up playing football with his brothers and even as the youngest child, showed the most promise.\nHe said: 'I’m the youngest of three brothers, Connor and Jordan were both quite a bit older than me, so growing up I was always wanting to play with them and their groups of friends.\n'When I was six or seven, I’d be going to play with them at five-a-side and I remember dribbling around all their mates who couldn’t believe it, for a young kid to be doing that to them.\n'So I think they thought I was destined to do something in football, but obviously it’s a tough road to get to where I am now and you’ve got to work hard.\nBoth Connor and Jordan played football growing up, but Connor lost his enthusiasm for the game, while Jordan suffered from an injury\nThe brothers are often seen attending the games to support Declan - and the same should be expected at the Euros (pictured, his brother Connor)\n'But if I hadn’t had those times with my brothers or my dad in the park, who knows what might've happened and if I’d be where I am today.'\nBoth Connor and Jordan played football growing up, but Connor lost his enthusiasm for the game, while Jordan suffered from an injury.\nIn the Euro 2021 tournament, Rice learned about the birth of his new niece after the final whistle following their victory over Denmark.\nAs Rice was playing on the pitch, his brother's partner was giving birth - meaning he got two lots of good news in one day.\nSpeaking to BBC Sport after the game, a delighted Rice said: 'My brother has literally had a baby, as the second goal went in.\n'He's crying his eyes out, he's had a little girl. It's a special night all round!'",
