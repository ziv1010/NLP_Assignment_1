  "body_text": "Pickford signs new deal at Everton\nUpdated Jordan Pickford has committed his future to Everton by signing a new contract that runs to the summer of 2027 following months of negotiations.\nThe England goalkeeper was named the club's player of the season last year and is regarded as one of the Toffees' most important assets.\nTalks over new terms were initiated at the end of last season and Pickford was said to be ready to put pen to paper on new terms late last year. However, like that of Alex Iwobi and Anthony Gordon, his contract extension remained unsigned heading into 2023.\nGordon's hesitation may have been due to a desire to leave the football club, a wish he was granted late in the January transfer window when he secured a £45m move to Newcastle United, but it was also surmised that Everton had paused talks with all three players due to uncertainty over the club's Premier League status.\nThe Blues had occupied the relegation zone between 3rd January and this past weekend amid fears that the club might go down this season but new manager Sean Dyche has already picked up two wins from his first three games in charge since taking over from Frank Lampard, igniting hope that top-flight survival could yet be achieved for a second successive season.\nPaul Joyce had previously reported that Everton were confident Pickford, who has been mentioned as a potential target for Tottenham this summer, would sign a new 4½-year contract, extending his existing one which was due to expire in June 2024.\nThat has now been confirmed by the club, with the goalkeeper saying: “It’s massive to sign this new contract at such a special club for me. The support I’ve had from everyone at the Club since I joined as a 22-year-old has been so important to my family and me. I’m happy here and so are my family. We love it at Everton.\n“Everton is a massive club. The past few seasons have not been what we wanted but we now have a manager who I believe will point us in the right direction and get us up the table. It’s definitely my aim to be successful at this club. The fans, the staff and my teammates have been great with me from the moment I joined and I want to be great for them.\n“I just want to keep working hard and performing for Everton. We know we are in a tough place at the moment in the league but I’m eager to help the team improve this season and then aim for success in the future, which will include playing in our new stadium.\n“This contract will take me to more than 10 years at Everton and I want to build a legacy here to put myself up there with the likes of Neville Southall to be one of the best keepers to have played for Everton.”\nQuotes sourced from The Times\nReader Comments (174)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

I know that the show for the cameras can not always mean a lot, but he seems committed.\nHe had improved and matured. Let's get him signed up.\n5 Posted 22/02/2023 at 18:52:47\nHopefully the new deal allows us to command a top fee for him that can be used to strengthen the overall team. With Gordon leaving for a very good fee, surely this would allow us to spend in the summer.\nAnd good luck to Jordan, if he leaves, he's been a good keeper for us. Albeit, with some dodgy moments, but every keeper has those. Especially young ones.\n6 Posted 22/02/2023 at 18:57:02\nEh? We need the best keeper we can afford. It doesn't matter who the manager is — it's not him firing shots at our keeper every week.\n7 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:01:43\n8 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:07:50\nIf he has a better contract, then whoever wants to sign him in the future will have to improve on it. This could also add to his transfer fee and that will help Everton.\nThe down side will be the cost in getting someone better.\n9 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:16:26\nJust Tom Davies to tie down nextâ€¦\n10 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:16:38\nGreat news, if it is true.\nUTFTs!\n11 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:20:26\n12 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:22:21\n13 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:31:33\nGood news on Pickford, he needs more slack than he gets; this man is world class.\n14 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:32:42\nI'm not convinced it would be easy to find another reliable keeper if we did sell on to make a profit.\n15 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:33:58\nCan't believe people are asking if we need him. He's essential.\n16 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:36:13\nLet's not begin a cult after 3 games shall we? We've had enough false dawns in my time.\n17 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:41:09\nLee, Pickford can play well in a direct side. He has used long balls and throws to great effect for England. At Everton, I don't know if it is the wind or what that seems to blow the ball into the Main Stand but, if we can get some windbreakers, maybe he could thrive.\n18 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:54:22\n19 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:56:19\nGreat shot-stopper and, as much as I hate giving blues stick, he will always be prone to stupid errors, and causes way too much panic at the back. At one point in time, I even thought he was a kopite.\nBig question is who has the money and would take the risk? Certainly not the Geordies. Would Man Utd go for someone risky, like De Gea? Leaves Chelsea or Man City, both of whom shouldn't be splashing the cash in the Summer. Spurs a maybe.\nChances are he will be with us next season, unless we drop.\n20 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:56:59\n21 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:58:51\nI'd be happy if he stayed as I think he is improving with age â€“ the next 5 years will be his best.\n22 Posted 22/02/2023 at 19:59:36\n23 Posted 22/02/2023 at 20:02:14\nAs he's had the same coach for years (?) now, I guess a change or a new set of eyes would potentially fix these. No harm in continually seeking improvement.\n24 Posted 22/02/2023 at 20:10:08\n25 Posted 22/02/2023 at 20:29:20\n\"Just Tom Davies to tie down nextâ€¦\"\nI have got some really strong ropes and chains that Houdini couldn't escape from, we just need to find the next Rocket into Space, ironically, something that Tom Davies never finds!\nLet's also hope that Kenwright is holding his hand when countdown finishes ! :-)\n26 Posted 22/02/2023 at 20:44:42\n27 Posted 22/02/2023 at 20:49:56\nWe never learn! Pickford, Mina, Gomes, Alli, Iwobi, Davies, Mykolenko and Calvert Lewin should all be shipped out and we'd be much better for it.\n28 Posted 22/02/2023 at 20:55:36\nI doubt anyone would pay close to 㿞 million given he will be a free agent in a little over 12 months. The \"stupid errors\" charge though is something Spurs fans say of Lloris, Man Utd fans of De Gea, more recently Liverpool fans of Allison. Then you have Pope and Ramsdale â€“ neither of whom could usurp him as England Number 1 due to their stupid errors.\nI was surprised to come across articles in the last few weeks with both Brighton and Brentford fans criticizing their erratic goalies. My point being that I think all goalies have a \"mistake\" in them but it tends to get amplified a million times louder than when outfield players make mistakes. If you think of the latter days of Southall or Howard or even Seaman, he is better now than either of them were then.\n29 Posted 22/02/2023 at 21:08:37\nIf we do keep him, we deserve his best years given what we have been through.\n30 Posted 22/02/2023 at 21:14:51\nBut I don't get the hate. He kept us up as much as anyone last season, alongside Richarlison and the fans. He's been largely error-free the past couple of years. He's not great on balls in the air, but I'll take his shot-stopping as much as anyone in the Premier League.\nObviously there's a price for anyone, and I wouldn't be surprised to see Man Utd or Spurs offer 㿨 million or something we can't refuse. If somehow we recruited well, that kind of deal would make sense.\nAnd of course there's a wage that's excessive but, for a world-class keeper in his prime, that number has to be pretty high. It's not like keepers of his quality are just sitting on the bench somewhere or can be plucked for 㾻 million from a lower league. Sure, you might get lucky and find one, but I'll take overpaying wages on a known commodity than taking that chance any day.\n31 Posted 22/02/2023 at 21:20:48\nCarlo Ancelotti helped him by leaving him out of the team for a spell. Once he returned for the final weeks of the 2020-21 season, he became more reliable and has generally played well for the last 2 years.\nHe still makes errors, most notably for the first goal at Bournemouth this season and for Ward-Prowse's free-kick at Goodison, but they are fewer and further between than they were.\nThe news of his contract extension is positive in terms of preventing a discounted sale this summer or the player running down his contract. There are bound to be release clauses and it would be interesting to know how much we are paying him.\n32 Posted 22/02/2023 at 21:26:45\nIt's weird but the world can be very unforgiving to goalies.\nRemember when Jim Leighton was rivalling Southall as best of British then he made mistakes in that cup game, was replaced by Les Sealy and no big club ever gave him a chance again.\nStekelenburg going to Juve as the best thing since sliced bread then ended up at Everton with a reputation as a dodgy Number 2. In spite of which, I recall him having a MotM performance against Man City one time.\n33 Posted 22/02/2023 at 21:41:55\nHe's made some bonehead errors but they all do. As mentioned above, there's nowhere for goalies to hide, most of their mistakes end up as a goal against and get remembered more than all the saves. Karrius starting for the Barcodes in the League Cup Final, I think?\n34 Posted 22/02/2023 at 21:50:02\nWe've done it for decades and never seem to learn.\n35 Posted 22/02/2023 at 22:15:24\nI don't honestly remember Southall, when he became our No 1, ever making an error. Maybe it's just meâ€¦ but â€“ as Carlsberg say â€“ â€˜probably' the best keeper ever.\n36 Posted 22/02/2023 at 22:18:53\n37 Posted 22/02/2023 at 22:18:59\nI guess you're right. It wasn't so much \"errors\" I suppose â€“more that he went downhill fast in his later years due to being overweight.\n38 Posted 22/02/2023 at 22:21:47\nErrors more common these days due to the pace of the game and change to the back-pass rule.\n39 Posted 22/02/2023 at 22:24:31\nPickford and Onana are our two Champions League type players. It would be good if we can commence next season with them both. Branthwaite and an attacker of quality too (not Ryan Fraser).\nHere's hoping.\n40 Posted 22/02/2023 at 22:45:32\nAnd Mike, with all affection, I think you're out of your mind.\n41 Posted 22/02/2023 at 23:14:15\n42 Posted 22/02/2023 at 23:27:29\nWhile you're at it, give Maupay an extension â€“ our one-goal wonder...\nAnd give each board member a big cash bonus for being super great at their jobs.\n43 Posted 22/02/2023 at 23:39:53\nThat's where most of the errors come from today... keepers with the ball at their feet, like Courtois.\n44 Posted 22/02/2023 at 23:48:35\n'Sell him and spend the money' â€“ because that has worked wonders with Stones, Lukaku, Richarlison, Gordon â€“ we've always improved when selling our better players haven't we, I mean thank god we sold Gueye, that money came in really handy to sign Gbmain that we went and signed Gueye to replace himself 3 years later.\nGood goalkeepers are difficult to find. Pickford makes mistakes, as do they all â€“ yesterday saw two of the world's best keepers make massive blunders, Ramsdale makes blunders, Ederson makes blunders, de Gea makes blunders â€“ but Pickford's pros far outweigh his cons and, for a club at our level, we'd massively struggle to replace him with anyone near as good.\nAlso, he's at his peak; if we don't sign him up, we'll lose him for half his true value, or even lose him on a free. So why would we even consider not giving him a new contract?\n45 Posted 22/02/2023 at 00:03:06\nPickford's kicking (the power, distance and, at times, accuracy) has been severely under-utilised, if not buried, by all the managers ever since he joined us. When Dyche was hired, I was quietly giddly because I believe he is the one manager who will unleash this ability of Pickford's.\nSo far so good as we have seen Pickford punting long more frequently: a few of those balls actually were almost placed directly on to Calvert-Lewin's head during the Arsenal game (whether he was winning those headers is another subject).\n46 Posted 23/02/2023 at 00:06:33\nThat's a damn good point I'd forgotten about.\n47 Posted 23/02/2023 at 00:18:53\nAbsolutely spot on.\nUndisputed first choice for England and our only world class player since Rooney, yet some on here would happily see him depart, it's beyond belief.\n48 Posted 23/02/2023 at 00:42:48\n49 Posted 23/02/2023 at 02:17:41\nManagers rated Joe Hart highly until they didn't.\n50 Posted 23/02/2023 at 02:27:09\nAsk fans of other clubs what they think of him and you will get varying responses. The Kopites think they can't get to him. So do the Mancs. The Geordies know they can get to him. Others will say he is the best in the country.\nHe can be world class. We've all seen incredible performances from him, but he can most definitely be rattled and distracted.\nThe good days comfortably outweigh the bad days. He may not be ultra-consistent, but he is the most consistent player we have by a mile.\n51 Posted 23/02/2023 at 04:36:53\nJoe Hart had a couple of weaknesses. One was that he was slow getting down to low shots and had been found out, he was also hopeless at tippy-tappy distributing the ball from his area. He was finished when Pep came.\n52 Posted 23/02/2023 at 05:23:07\nHe is England's Number 1 and as good as we can hope for.\nHe plays too much in our 6-yard box and isn't as commanding enough as we would like. He occasionally loses his head but, as John says, that's becoming less frequent as he matures. He still irritates me with the rugby-like punts aiming for possession and territory. Is that his instinct or what he is told to do?\nHis shot-stopping is almost second to none and he's given me breathless moments before coming around again to realise he did actually save it. Sometimes twice in the space of a few seconds. Only Neville Southall done that to me.\nOn Neville, I'm not sure he would have made a good coach. Watching him and having watched documentaries since, he seemed an insular character who just wanted to play and go home. Just an observation rather than knowledge.\nBest keeper ever? Probably hanging myself out here. Of course 16-year-old Danny thought that at the time. But I would put Manuel Neuer, Peter Schmeichel and Buffon up there as competition.\nSpeaks volumes that we talk about Southall in that company. Everyone rightly talks about that season-defining save at Tottenham. I remember the one against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. How he got to that, I will never know!\n53 Posted 23/02/2023 at 06:05:52\nI also like the way he uses his hands rather than this modern way of keeping which is to do the splits while sticking a leg out as far as possible. I mean, what are they supposed to do when it hits their outstretched leg and how are they to recover a standing position? It was always a part of keeper training that you could quickly recover an upright position.\nAs for lining up the wall, I've seen Everton on two or three occasions have the keeper more to one side of the goal while the man on the end of the wall, I think usually Mykolenko, is supposed to turn and sprint back to take up position on the far post before the opposition can take advantage of being played onside. I don't remember any of the two or three times being successful and most notably the Ward-Prouse goal.\nSimilarly, Pickford could come for more crosses but keepers more often than not rely on their central defenders, particularly if they are good in the air, Labone and West being a good example â€“ albeit I remember Labby giving Bonetti what for in that World Cup game against West Germany for the Seeler goal.\nAnd as for eccentricities, it used to be said that you couldn't be a top-class keeper without them but then you weren't expected to be able to control or trap a ball or have first class distribution â€“ unless of course you could throw it as far as Westy â€“ but probably not with today's balloons that pass for caseys.\n54 Posted 23/02/2023 at 06:30:50\n55 Posted 23/02/2023 at 06:39:22\nHis poor distribution doesn't explain why he was so poor at Burnley. With him as first name on the teamsheet, they were getting relegated. It took a brave decision by the manager to demote him to turn things around.\nAnd Alan @53, we have Begovic who is on balance probably a better option than Jordan.\n56 Posted 23/02/2023 at 06:50:24\nOne I've watched and he was bought at a young age by Bayern as a potential successor to Neuer. Still on Bayern's books but loaned out to Monaco, so might be surplus to requirements, although he is still only 26 and Neuer heading into the twilight of his career at 36, so maybe Bayern have been managing that one.\nBoth came through the Schalke academy too. They have a history of selling, losing or having young players poached by predators!!\nApologies in advance for my Schalke reference. If you think Everton are having a bad season, their return to the Bundesliga is looking like a train crash!! Hoping to get out to see them soon in-between watching Everton.\nHopefully Jordan signs to give us time and some form of insurance in terms of future transfer fees if it happened.\n57 Posted 23/02/2023 at 06:51:04\nIt is of course a matter of personal opinion and it seems not only myself but several former managers disagree with you.\nWhen was the last time that Begovic, who isn't a bad keeper, was more than the reserve keeper at a club â€“ particularly in the Premier League?\n58 Posted 23/02/2023 at 07:05:47\nI don't like the way Pickford stays in his 6-yard box and doesn't come out and claim catches, and also doesn't catch shots that are straight at him. Maybe that's the modern game and \"a safe pair of hands\" is no longer the mantra that it was in my day.\nHe could do worse than watching a few of the great First Division goalies of the '60s and '70s. West, Banks, Clemence, Shilton, Bonetti, Sprake (although not that time he threw the ball into his own net).\nI'd keep him though. When he's having a good day, he's great; when he's having a bad one he's a bit better than average.\n59 Posted 23/02/2023 at 07:17:54\nYou list some top keepers there, Eric. Shilton and Clemence. A period when England were spoilt for choice.\n60 Posted 23/02/2023 at 07:19:43\nMost would need 18 months to settle in.\nFor example, there's an extremely highly rated young Russian, Safonov, who is out of contract in summer. Or the young Bosnian, Kovacevic, playing in Poland. Both could be exceptional but would not hit the ground running.\nCloser to home, there is Kellerher at Liverpool. I expect he'd cost about 㿀M. That's probably the absolute top end of our budget for a keeper. He's been good in cups playing for a very good side. Whether he can replicate that on a regular basis in the league, hard to say.\n61 Posted 23/02/2023 at 07:35:49\nI'm not disagreeing with you as I know nothing of the players you name but would there be problems getting work permits, have they as yet represented their senior national teams, or even allow Russians under the present circumstances?\nAnd as you say, would not at the moment be as good as Pickford or possibly have settling problems, such as Kean, or speak the language. And a young, untried keeper from across the park? They'd have us for an arm and a leg.\n62 Posted 23/02/2023 at 08:25:15\nHe's England's No 1 for good reason, he's been a great keeper for us and for England. He's still young and, if we do sell him, we're no longer forced to do so for a pittance.\nFor all those whining, tell us all: who can we afford that's better?\n63 Posted 23/02/2023 at 08:31:20\nLiverpool's reserve keeper.\n64 Posted 23/02/2023 at 08:31:55\nThe point I was trying to make is that it will be very difficult to replace Pickford with anyone as good as him. There are talented options out there but they are quite speculative and may take time to settle, if indeed they settle at all.\nThe other option is to buy someone like Henderson from Man Utd or Nubel who has been mentioned. These are decent mature goalkeepers but they are not in the same league as Pickford. So it is a bit like Richarlison, where we sell and deteriorate in quality as a result.\n65 Posted 23/02/2023 at 08:35:37\nCaoimhin Kelleher is unproven, and there's no reason that Liverpool would ever sell to us, at a price we can afford.\n66 Posted 23/02/2023 at 08:52:13\nI could see Liverpool trying to use Kellerher as a way to get Branthwaite. They might sell because they have another good young keeper coming through, Trafford, who has been on loan at Bolton. They could also pick up an older backup on the cheap, as we did with Begovic.\nHe wouldn't be cheap though for us.\n67 Posted 23/02/2023 at 08:54:24\nI just hope we don't go for that Russian lad, I Letemin.\n68 Posted 23/02/2023 at 09:03:14\nHe was also weak getting down to low shots and he was found out. Could that explain it? I have only read it as a comment from the time.\n69 Posted 23/02/2023 at 09:03:41\nWhen it comes to Number 1s, he has some record at picking them.\n70 Posted 23/02/2023 at 09:04:24\n71 Posted 23/02/2023 at 09:04:34\nThis news also came out the same day the I paper said the MSP investment is close. So I wonder if this is all linked.\nWe ain't getting better than him in summer, not for a small fortune anyway. So this is good news.\n72 Posted 23/02/2023 at 09:07:34\nWe haven't addressed one end of the field and it would have been foolish to try to fix one of the things that isn't broke at the other.\n73 Posted 23/02/2023 at 09:19:26\nYou might be right. By the way, I will be made up if Pickford signs â€“ a very good player. However, I disagree that there are no other options at a decent price.\nI don't follow much other football, aside from Everton now, probably because Everton are so poor. However, I don't rate Pickford as high as you and some others do. His decision making is poor and he does little to relieve pressure, electing to punch simple crosses and shots. I rate him on a par with Howard: very good keeper but not great.\nIf an opportunity arises to get a better keeper in, we should take it.\nI always rated Pope highly, but Newcastle got in there. There are loads of keepers whether playing Number 1 or Number 2, old or young out there and I don't believe that upgrades are unavailable.\nAn example in past was Nigel Martyn. What a keeper! A more recent example was Lampard picking up Mendhy a few years back. He was pretty cheap, I recall, and I thought a huge upgrade on their keeper at the time although he has recently lost form and his place back to whom he replaced. That example shows perhaps it's not as easy as I think but, personally, I don't think it would be too hard to get an upgrade at a reasonable price.\n74 Posted 23/02/2023 at 09:57:12\nPope is a very good traditional keeper. However, because of his limited ball control and distribution, he would be of no interest to genuine Champions League clubs â€“ and is less suited to international football (hence Pope doesn't get a look in).\nPickford is in a different league because he plays the position differently. The back pass rule has changed the skill set that is most prized amongst goalkeepers. Southall, Schmeichel, Seaman etc have given way to more footballing keepers like Alisson, Ederson, Neuer and, yes, Pickford.\nIn some respects, he has been wasted on us. We could have got by with a more limited keeper. But if you want to go up a level, you need a keeper like Pickford.\n75 Posted 23/02/2023 at 10:15:21\n76 Posted 23/02/2023 at 10:36:19\n77 Posted 23/02/2023 at 10:37:27\nDerisks us from him running down his contract and probably has clauses to protect him.\nAbsolute no brainer.\n78 Posted 23/02/2023 at 13:17:29\nI felt for sure he would be out the door at the end of the season to a ''bigger'' club but those clubs may feel they have the best already. (Ha! ha! after watching the clown mistakes made in the Liverpool - Real Madrid match.)\nPicks has had his critics in this column and unfairly so on many occasions but the cynics always blame the keeper when things go wrong but he is still one of the best in England.\nHe like the rest of us may feel the new gaffer is going to get this club up among the elite again and being a keeper he has time on his side to see that happen (if it does)\nGood luck to him and the team.\n79 Posted 23/02/2023 at 13:18:17\n80 Posted 23/02/2023 at 13:35:54\nHe's in his prime, and we are a million miles from that level.\n81 Posted 23/02/2023 at 13:50:00\n82 Posted 23/02/2023 at 13:53:21\nGenius, or what?\nMore seriously, I'm delighted he's signed.\n83 Posted 23/02/2023 at 18:00:07\nObviously being in a profession one attempts to eradicate potential mistakes or at least lesson their probability and one can possibly assume that as he progresses in his career Pickford would be attempting to do so? There has never been a goalkeeper at any level who has never made mistakes. Obviously if mistakes are constantly being made without any attempts being made to rectify them then that is another ball game as they say. The great goalkeeper names often mentioned also made their fair share of mistakes and as has already been mentioned, the goalkeeper's mistakes are often highlighted and are more obvious than most other players. Many of the great names mentioned are often of previous times if not generations, and one need hardly mention that they were often not subject to the relentless scrutiny endured by todays generation of keepers.\nThose who continue to have recourse to the “there is a mistake in himâ€ cliche when commenting on Pickford should prepare themselves well in their search for the goalkeeper who does not have “a mistake in himâ€ for they are in for a very long, and dare I say, fruitless journey.\n84 Posted 23/02/2023 at 18:02:32\nExtraordinary goal by DiMaria for Juve just now.\n85 Posted 23/02/2023 at 18:15:28\n\" he was entitled to go down \" ( he cheated )\n\" he drew the foul ( he cheated )\nYou can add your own favourites. It's all bollix\n86 Posted 23/02/2023 at 18:18:23\n87 Posted 23/02/2023 at 18:31:14\nGood post. I was thinking the exact same thing this morning. Anyone would have \"a mistake in him\" playing behind the Keane, Holgate combo, behind Yerri when he sits down mid play, or any of our other changing assortment of defenders. But he doesn't have these issues with England as he is playing with better defenders. He is also better able to utilize his long passes, throws etc as he has better players upfield who are more capable of controlling balls and making the best of them. If and when we get better players, I think we will see Pickford as more that just a very good keeper but actually as a top player.\n88 Posted 23/02/2023 at 18:36:15\nSo It's insignificant if there's a clause or not. It's an insight into how he feels though, that he would be willing to stay here anyway so I say it's confirmed that he ls here for the long term now, WHEN we stay up and consolidate next term.\nI always think keepers look better in a struggling team anyway. He faces alot of shots in our side.\n89 Posted 24/02/2023 at 01:48:21\nRight?\n90 Posted 24/02/2023 at 04:14:50\n91 Posted 24/02/2023 at 04:46:19\nAnd Robert #74, Sunderland?\n92 Posted 24/02/2023 at 07:13:26\nUnder normal circumstances ,I would say that hopefully by one of our better players staying, it may encourage a few others to put pen to paper, but hopefully not.\n93 Posted 24/02/2023 at 08:22:51\nHe has always been world class for England, especially in the major tournaments.\nI think he's been with a sports shrink and this has helped enormously.\nMany keepers carry on improving with experience well into their mid thirties and that makes me want to hang onto him even more.\nSome people's digs at Dyche are just plain annoying. I believed a few weeks ago that we were on such a trajectory of shite that nothing could alter our descent into the abyss. Now, at least I see hope and a group with more backbone and a game plan.\n\"Dycheball\" is an unfair fallacy to me. At Burnley he performed brilliantly with what he had and cut his cloth accordingly. Here, he's just starting. Emergency measures are needed.\nLet's at least give the guy a chance - and maybe if we survive and he brings his choices into Goodison in a less doomladen time - we might get to see what he's capable of. So far, a lot of common sense, grit and hope.\n94 Posted 24/02/2023 at 10:48:57\nInteresting final word from Thelwell though: \"Since signing him in 2017, our Chairman has built a strong relationship with Jordan and his representatives, and this played a big and important part in us getting this new contract agreed\".\nPassive aggressive message to the fans? Bill saying \"give us a mention Kev\"? Just the plain truth and no more?\n95 Posted 24/02/2023 at 10:56:47\nIn truth, my heart sank a little hearing of his new four year deal, as I've been wishing that he and a couple of our below par performers, could be sold and the money used to bring in an experienced keeper, similar to the way we signed an aging Martyn perhaps, but more importantly a centre forward who can actually score goals.\n96 Posted 24/02/2023 at 11:17:35\n97 Posted 24/02/2023 at 11:31:38\nYou see it most weeks. I've said it on a few match days, there where times I thought he was going to join us in the crowd at times. Always comes over to us regardless, which personally means a lot. Never far behind Mykolenko. I can't count the amount of pairs of gloves he's given to some young supporter. The kit manager must be going spare!!\nNot everyone's cup of tea and like any player, especially keepers, will make mistakes. But he has matured and improved.\nHe's not the best in commanding his box but he is amongst the best at shot stopping. Quite frankly, we couldn't do much better right now and we have other areas that we need to worry about.\nTo secure England's goalkeeper is positive on two counts.\nIt is a statement. We get to keep him and have him make those saves that give me heart stopping moments. And we secure the club gaining financial benefit should we sell him.\nGood business by the club in my opinion.\n98 Posted 24/02/2023 at 11:48:01\nI stated a personal opinion. I'm not asking anyone to agree with me.\nFacts can only be based on statistics. So in that sense my argument holds regarding Southall.\nHow old are you? Did you actually watch Southall week in week out as I did? If so I fail to see how in your opinion (not fact based by the way), that Pickford comes anywhere near Southall in terms of consistent shot stopping, positional sense, ability at collecting crosses, distribution and general bravery.\nGoalkeepers have always been sweepers. If not distributing with their feet, then verbally marshalling their defence. I could list a variety of them dating back to Gordon Banks or our own Gordon West when I first supported Everton.\nYou state it as a fact that Pickford is the best in the UK. How do you back that opinion up? The best keepers play for the teams placed highest in the league...Fact.\n99 Posted 24/02/2023 at 11:56:18\n100 Posted 24/02/2023 at 12:19:17\nIt does show though that Thelwell knows what side his bread is buttered on. Looks like Kev is another in a long line of yes men.\n101 Posted 24/02/2023 at 12:28:46\nKenwright has always surrounded himself with yes men...and women.\nIt's how he operates, it's how he survives.\n102 Posted 24/02/2023 at 12:44:09\nBig Nev is my all-time footballing hero, given that I'm mostly Welsh (with a bit of English/Danish/Norwegian) an Evertonian since I was about 7, and an amateur level goalkeeper myself for many years. I won't hear a word said against the man, but if he played now would he be any good? You just can't tell because keepers now play a different game with different rules and a different skillset.\nPickford is one of the better modern day keepers out there - he may not be the best, but he's definitely one of the better goalkeepers around. You don't play consistently for Everton and England the way he has done if you're no good.\nPeople have always slagged off goalkeepers - it's a thankless task (I was shouted at weekly for years by my own teammates) in the same way running the line is on a Sunday morning. All players make mistakes, but if you cock something up in midfield, by & large you get away with it - when the keeper arses things up it's the end of the world so you always get grief and nobody appreciates you fully.\nYes, I'm now wearing my goalkeepers union hat!\n103 Posted 24/02/2023 at 12:45:14\n104 Posted 24/02/2023 at 12:58:50\nYes and you're entitled to your opinion but remember it is just that and may have no basis in fact. As you offer nothing to back your opinion up, it actually has no value at all.\nOpinions are not sacrosanct and can be and often are pushing the realms of the ridiculous. I didn't say that Pickford was as good as or better than Southall as I said they are not playing the same game but I saw Southall all of his time at Everton and Pickford too. I class them both as superb and equals given the way that the game has moved forward and changed.\nWhere are those statistics by the way? I don't accept your comment about goalies having always been sweepers, as they have to be today, there isn't a comparison in duties.\nHow do I back up that he's best in the UK? Possibly, just possibly, something to do with him being first choice?\n\"The best keepers are at the top of the league, fact?\" What a load of unsubstantiated cobblers.\nCome on, give our players credit where it's due and stop trying to big yourself up by demeaning them.\nAnyway, I asked you to explain Pickford's weaknesses and explain your bizarre contention that he is anything other than superb. Opinions need to have a basis. Pickford not being superb has none.\nI not only saw Southall but Banks and Gordon West too.\n105 Posted 24/02/2023 at 13:32:08\n106 Posted 24/02/2023 at 13:34:09\nFacts are often quite dull. It get's dark at night here, FACT.\nEverton play in Liverpool FACT\nPickford, in my opinion, has improved immensely. For a while he spread panic in the defence and among some supporters, my opinion that I contest has sound basis in reality but not a FACT like the examples I gave.\nThe condescending tone of this post is quite deliberate.\n107 Posted 24/02/2023 at 14:07:11\n108 Posted 24/02/2023 at 14:15:52\nHere's a fact for you, he went down with Sunderland. There's every chance he'll do the same with us.\nEvery great team has a great goalkeeper, fact. He's had every chance to prove himself and for me falls short, even though I readily admitted, there has been improvement in his game. His England performances are judged mainly on a few penalty saves and have little relevance, it's the Premier League that finds players out. That is merely my opinion.\nYou would do well to understand the difference between fact and opinion.\nIf he was a great keeper, then some great team would have well been in for him by now. That's why he's been only too keen to pen this deal. Don't kid yourself otherwise.\n109 Posted 24/02/2023 at 14:42:41\n110 Posted 24/02/2023 at 14:45:16\nHe rarely steals us a game, has good reactions but is not a particularly good shot stopper from distance, he never commands his box by claiming crosses because he's not big enough. All of this affects the defence because he doesn't relieve pressure and forces them deeper.\nNo one else made a serious move for him despite at least three of the big 6 needing a new keeper. That speaks volumes as well as opposition supporters being underwhelmed by the thought of signing him.\nHe owes a lot to Southgate because if it wasn't for him he probably wouldn't even make the England squad. That's just my opinion by the way.\n111 Posted 24/02/2023 at 14:57:30\n112 Posted 24/02/2023 at 15:01:13\n113 Posted 24/02/2023 at 15:03:33\nSo yeah let's be bummed about him sugning. It's not like that improves our negotiations or sets the basis for a return to European football competitions. Who needs that crap.\n114 Posted 24/02/2023 at 15:07:36\n115 Posted 24/02/2023 at 15:08:41\nSure Ramsdale and Pope joined high flying Arsenal and Newcastle respectively. Do you not think the likes of Spurs would sign Pickford given the chance?\nPickford certainly isn't top top notch but he's pretty good. And replacing him is not our first priority. He's certainly nowhere Southall at his peak but, as others have stated, different times, different criteria.\n116 Posted 24/02/2023 at 15:08:41\nSure Ramsdale and Pope joined high flying Arsenal and Newcastle respectively.

On mine if I go to ToffeeWeb homepage it immediately redirects me to a pop up and closes TW. I have to click comments or some other tab really quickly to prevent it from redirecting.\n118 Posted 24/02/2023 at 15:29:35\n119 Posted 24/02/2023 at 15:32:16\nCheers. I was thinking it was just my phone\n120 Posted 24/02/2023 at 15:37:07\nI was getting flak for not stating facts, so I simply stated one, re his relegation with Sunderland.\nI really don't want to dwell on Pickford's merits or failings. I believe hed be easily replaced. The fact is he's one of our few sellable assets. The money could be spent on our main priority, a striker.\nYes the game has changed since the 80's for keepers mainly with the no back passing rule. But I've no doubt Southall would be every bit as good today as back then.\n121 Posted 24/02/2023 at 15:44:07\nTo me keepers are classed as Poor, Average, Above Average and Outstanding. Pickford is in the Above Average and I don't think he will make an Outstanding keeper and there are not many of them.\nIf Pickford was to leave we would be be left having to spend as much or more to get a better replacement and as our G/A average is better than a number of other clubs around us people are going more on his mistakes, than on his saves that have kept us in games for points.\nI think his signing a new contract will help other players in the team as they all know his strengths and positioning, and like other players he is willing to stay and fight for the club.\n122 Posted 24/02/2023 at 15:51:33\nLyndon and Michael, complaint rescinded. Dont go slogging code for just a handful of us. I don't know about the others but I am a retarded yank so this is what I get for trying to hang out with the cool Scouser kids. Keep it going!\n123 Posted 24/02/2023 at 15:54:04\n124 Posted 24/02/2023 at 15:54:10\nLucky for all us plebs that Kenwright was here to ensure Pickford signed a new contract. Phew!\n125 Posted 24/02/2023 at 16:13:48\nAgreed, we would obviously have to sign a new keeper, but we would have cash to spare with Pickford's sale, plus the Gordon money, plus money from Juventus in the summer for Kean.\nThat total amount would get us a decent striker surely?\n126 Posted 24/02/2023 at 16:17:02\n127 Posted 24/02/2023 at 16:18:14\nAs for the quote press release in Nick's #124 post, that is just hogwash. What do they say about praise â€“ 'self praise is no praise'.\n128 Posted 24/02/2023 at 16:37:58\n129 Posted 24/02/2023 at 16:41:38\n130 Posted 24/02/2023 at 17:05:50\nHe made 2 or 3 worldies in the home game against Liverpool this season. His distribution is at least as good, if not better than anyone else in the Premier League. He is the undisputed England keeper, never made a mistake for them.\nThe other top keepers around the league have all dropped massive bollocks recently: Alisson, Pope, Ramsdale, etc. He is better than any of them.\nSo we have either got the best keeper around to re-sign for us long-term, or we can sell him for top dollar if the worst happens.\n131 Posted 24/02/2023 at 17:06:27\nTake your pick: thanks for leaving, Frankâ€¦ or thanks for slapping some sense into them, Sean.\n132 Posted 24/02/2023 at 17:53:14\n133 Posted 24/02/2023 at 18:12:46\n134 Posted 24/02/2023 at 18:47:33\nYes ,we may have money to buy a decent striker, but they don't save goals, come to think of it, most of them do not score either, depends on who is supplying them.\nYou still will have to buy a decent keeper and they don't come cheap, when clubs know you need them.\n135 Posted 24/02/2023 at 19:46:33\nTake 2 steps back, Bill, and think about your statement.\nUsing that philosophy, the best you could hope for are 0-0 draws.\n136 Posted 24/02/2023 at 20:00:57\n20+ goals per season?\n15+ goals per season?\n10+ goals per season?\nLooking at the top scorers across Europe its dominated by strikers like Kane etc who are well beyond us. Look at the tier below...\nIvan Toney has 14 in 21 games in a side that has patiently developed an attacking style around him and Mbeumo. Probably would cost 㿨m+ so out of our price range by some distance.\nOllie Watkins (Toney's predecessor at Brentford) has 7 in 22 and cost â‚¬34m 3 years ago. Would he leave Villa for us? And at what cost?\nMaybe Jonathan David at Lille. He's got 15 in 23 but he's a short arse. Wouldn't suit Dyche. And cost Lille â‚¬27m 3 years ago.\nOr maybe Folarin Balogun who has 16 in 25 for Reims on loan from Arsenal. He'd be about 㿀m+ but only scored 3 in 21 for Middlesbrough last season. Is he any good?\nThe reality is that it is exceptionally difficult to just buy a player who will get even 10+ goals in the Premier League. These players can be developed with patience, like Toney, but will generally not hit the ground running.\nâ‚¬80m Nunez has only 6 in 17 for the RS. He'll come good though unfortunately because he's a huge talent. But that was â‚¬80m!\nIt's much more likely that we'd sign someone like GyÃ¶keres for about 㿀m and, because he's not amazing, he'd get between 8 and 12 goals. That would be his limit though. He's not going to improve.\nOr we could get someone like young Wahi from Montpellier for the same price but he might get about 6 goals in his first season, but show the ability to get about 15 to 20 goals in time.\nThis is the market we're playing in due to our finances. Selling Pickford (like selling Richarlison) could very easily result in us becoming much worse.\n137 Posted 24/02/2023 at 20:22:15\nI take your point regarding strikers, it's fair comment. But surely you're not suggesting that we don't need a striker? So it's up to our scouting system to scour the world of football and come up with goods. That's what they're paid for.\n138 Posted 24/02/2023 at 20:28:36\nAnd so far, sell to buy has only resulted in a continuous steady decline for us.\nA keeper, realistically, should only be sold if you already have the replacement in the squad. If you sell a keeper and then go into the market, any target will have their fee inflated as you're in a much weaker bargaining position. And it's not like we'd be an attractive move for any player either.\nIn terms of striking options, it's always a gamble â€“ Newcastle spent 㿨M on Isak and he's been injured all season. Edouard at Palace was much talked about on here as someone we should target but he's not prolific in the slightest. Mitrovic has taken years to eventually become an effective Premier League striker. Armstrong was banging them in in the Championship but is out of his depth in the Premier League.\nSo any striker we get is going to be a risk - either a foreign import who may or may not settle or may need a long time to adapt, a punt from a lower division with the same issues, or an 'experienced' player past their best.\nSo we absolutely need to keep our best players like Pickford and hope for steady and intelligent moves for the rest of the squad.\n139 Posted 24/02/2023 at 20:37:53\n140 Posted 24/02/2023 at 20:38:02\nWe can probably get away with making do in other areas.\nBut in my view we should get someone young of genuine talent (like Almeria did when buying Nunez for â‚¬15M after an excellent showing in the World Youth Cup) and accept we may need to make do with Simms, Maupay and a not always fit Calvert-Lewin while that new guy beds in. It doesn't need to be foreign. It could be the likes of young Hugill at Man Utd if they'd be prepared to sell him.\nWith someone like that, we have to accept a meagre return initially. But like Brentford also showed with Toney, the patience can be rewarded.\nStill, whatever, I would like to see happen it's very likely we'll sign GyÃ¶keres.\n141 Posted 24/02/2023 at 20:40:43\nOr if you sacrifice to a poorer keeper for a decent striker we could end up loosing 4--3.\nThe thing I notice about the premier, is the top six are always looking to strengthen their Keeper. I agree with we need a new striker but, I don't see the sense in strengthening 1 position by weakening an essential defensive position. We will not be that short of money for a new striker, finding one who will want to come is different.\n142 Posted 24/02/2023 at 21:15:00\nWhat I notice about the Top 6 is that they have miles more money than everyone else. They strengthen every position, and every reserve position too.\nIf you pieced together our very best XI from the entire Premier League era, it would struggle to get in this season's Top 4.\nIt's probably good news that our very good keeper is (probably) staying but it will have an impact on our transfer kitty.\nPersonally, I think we'll be very short of money to rebuild in summer unless MSP invest heavily. Hopefully they do. But if we don't get that sort of investment, it wouldn't surprise me if we spend no more than about 㿅M in total (increased if we sell Branthwaite).\nThat buys one GyÃ¶keres, a free transfer and maybe someone else for about ٦M.\n143 Posted 24/02/2023 at 22:38:46\nDyche likes to build on solid foundations so getting the keeper sorted was a no-brainer for him, I guess.\n144 Posted 25/02/2023 at 06:18:17\nStop wishing away our best players. It's what has got us in this mess in the first place.\n145 Posted 25/02/2023 at 07:08:28\nFor years, Nev was in a superb Everton team while, for years, Jordan has been behind a tragically poor team that had the ball coming back to him from outfield like greased lightning. Pickford's distribution, which often involves 70-m passes, is for me unequalled in the Premier League. His domination of the area is exceptional and his shot-stopping second to none.\nHe flaps? All good goalies flap and that is because they are on a knife edge having to change direction and tactics like no other players have to.\nHe is a great keeper and I'm really glad he's staying. I'd say that I have seen him make one genuinely bad mistake rather than what his detractors would mark down as a mistake and that was the goal at Anfield. Otherwise, he has effectively kept us out of the Championship.\n146 Posted 25/02/2023 at 08:55:39\nI still don't think he's as good as many on here do and I'm not convinced his contributions would be so hard to replace but it's good he's signed a new contract and some stability in a key position is helpful.\n147 Posted 25/02/2023 at 09:47:28\nIt's perhaps even a little less than might be expected considering the earlier rumour that a figure of 𧶀k pw is what supposedly caused the deal to stall. We can never know the truth when it comes to players' wages but there must be little doubt that, if he were to move to one of the Big 6, he could well command such a level of remuneration.\nCan't say I feel a huge amount of love and affection for him personally but, if this stuff is even half-true, it suggests that there's at least a substantial element of club loyalty in his decision that I respect and appreciate.\nDo it for us, Jordan!\n148 Posted 25/02/2023 at 10:16:52\n149 Posted 25/02/2023 at 10:24:11\nYour last paragraph sums up the way I feel about Pickford, a good goalkeeper and a very good shot stopper but with two or three flaws to go with them.\nIt would be interesting to see which clubs come in for him if he ever went on the transfer market but he seems to have done Everton a favour by agreeing a new contract when it was possible he might have got a lot more financially at the end of next season by not signing a new deal.\n150 Posted 25/02/2023 at 10:27:50\nIt isn't a video game, you're talking about human beings with lives, feelings & families to consider. When you look back at players like Lukaku vs what we have now, you have to wonder whether these people will ever be happy. The criticism is exactly the same whether we're 6th or 16th.\nEvertonians are passionate of course, but they're also extremely critical - you hear it in the ground, and you read it on here. It's part of the negative culture that's unfortunately fostered at the club for the past 30 years (maybe it was always there, but I only started going to Everton games in the late 80's).\nAs Martin points out - there's often a lot of criticism of players, but rarely any justification other than 'opinion'.\n151 Posted 25/02/2023 at 10:38:44\nI think perhaps there's more shades of grey on this opinion-versus-fact spectrum.\nIn-between, there's things like \"conclusions based on inference\" and \"suspicions based on rumours\" – which for me leaves 'opinions' right at the end of the spectrum, often lacking any rational basis but just developed internally as an expression of how we feel.\nThis might be what helps differentiate us from ChatGPTâ€¦\n[Uh-oh, I may have just inadvertently opened the floodgates to AI-generated posts swamping ToffeeWeb and crashing the server!!!]\n152 Posted 25/02/2023 at 10:43:21\nWould you agree that some fans over hype some players, blow them up and are blind to their faults the same as some of us highlight their faults, sometimes going overboard but sometimes with constructive criticism?\nFrom 3-00pm until 5-00pm today I hope we all get behind the team and we are celebrating another win at the end of the game although I know before I go to the game I will be cursing a couple of players for lack of I what see as lack of commitment and effort, I hope they prove me wrong today.\n153 Posted 25/02/2023 at 10:51:49\nHowever, it's worth noting that Pickford's performances have been inconsistent at times, and he has made some high-profile errors in the past. This has led to criticism from some fans and pundits, and there have been calls for Everton to look for a more reliable goalkeeper.\nRegarding the contract extension, some Everton fans might be pleased that the club has secured one of its key players for the long term. A 4Â½-year contract is a significant commitment, and it shows that Everton values Pickford's contributions to the team. However, the reported salary of £100k per week is quite high and might be seen as excessive by some fans, especially given Pickford's occasional lapses in form.\nOverall, the reaction of an Everton fan to Pickford's contract extension would likely depend on their individual opinion of the player and his performances. Some might see it as a positive move that secures the club's future, while others might have concerns about the high salary and Pickford's inconsistency.\nHmmm... ChatGPT may have been reading this thread already!\n154 Posted 25/02/2023 at 10:52:31\nAn apt description of opinions that I once read and please excuse the language but it's Opinions are like kids and farts, OK if they are your own.\n155 Posted 25/02/2023 at 10:56:31\nI think you've just revealed to us in a nutshell exactly why you have no respect for anybody else's opinion except your own.\nThank you.\n156 Posted 25/02/2023 at 10:58:02\nYeah that's a fair point - obviously none of us follow other teams as closely as we do Everton so it could well be the same at all clubs. Maybe that's just the thought process of all football fans.\n157 Posted 25/02/2023 at 11:10:28\nGreat that he's signed. I suspect the club is keeping its options open - new contracts are often about protecting the value of a sellable asset as much as keeping the player.\n158 Posted 25/02/2023 at 12:09:39\nIt's obvious Pickford is better than most goalkeepers with the ball at his feet, but this can sometimes interfere with the way the team play, when our goalkeeper thinks he's the playmaker!\n159 Posted 25/02/2023 at 12:55:22\n160 Posted 25/02/2023 at 13:06:17\nI haven't noticed the excellence of him dominating the penalty area to be honest, when did that start?\n161 Posted 25/02/2023 at 13:48:42\n162 Posted 25/02/2023 at 13:51:46\n163 Posted 25/02/2023 at 14:18:26\n164 Posted 25/02/2023 at 14:18:59\n165 Posted 25/02/2023 at 14:30:35\n166 Posted 25/02/2023 at 14:38:10\nDon't blame one man when it's the whole shit show that needs improving.\n167 Posted 25/02/2023 at 18:29:01\n168 Posted 25/02/2023 at 23:11:56\nThis theory that a keeper has to carry out a wider range of passing than a right back is utter bullshit. All we want him to do is kick it up the pitch and it to stay in the field of play.\nI like Pickford and I'm happy he's signed a new contract, but I don't know how anyone can defend his distribution. It's shite.\n169 Posted 26/02/2023 at 00:51:22\n170 Posted 26/02/2023 at 09:49:15\n171 Posted 28/04/2023 at 13:01:52\n172 Posted 28/04/2023 at 13:01:56\n173 Posted 28/04/2023 at 13:01:56\n174 Posted 28/04/2023 at 13:01:56\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
