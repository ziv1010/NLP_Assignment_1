He scored 10 goals in the 2023-24 season with Chelsea, but any hopes they had of Arsenal wanting to buy him permanently were extinguished when he returned a goal tally of just one during 2024-25.\nNow 30 years old, Sterling is at a crossroads in his career. His CV is an impressive one, only including clubs with the calibre of Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal. But his next step might not be so glamorous.\nA four-way battle is unfolding for Sterling’s signature, according to Caught Offside. Of these four suitors, the most competitive from a footballing standpoint would be Napoli, who are the reigning Serie A champions and the only ones with Champions League football on offer.\nBut the team with the ‘strongest interest’ in Sterling are Besiktas, who finished fourth in last season’s Turkish Super Lig. They were eliminated from the Europa League qualifiers and are all square with Lausanne-Sport ahead of the second leg of their Conference League play-off tie this week.\nAfter signing another English player in the shape of Tammy Abraham earlier this summer, Besiktas have set their sights on Sterling. According to Caught Offside, they will send a delegation to London in the next few days.\nChelsea are asking for around £20m to sell Sterling, but the report claims his admirers could try and do a deal for less. Napoli, for their part, would prefer a loan deal.\n🔵👀 CHELSEA LOAN WATCH: How every player is faring in 2025/26 away from Stamford Bridge\nSterling retains Premier League interest\nIn addition to Besiktas and Napoli, Fulham and West Ham have been listed as potential destinations for Sterling in the latest report.\nEither of those moves would allow him to remain in London, which TEAMtalk’s Dean Jones has revealed is his preference.\nSterling hasn’t yet decided on his next move and remains contracted to Chelsea until 2027, but the Blues now want rid of him.\nThey have replenished their options out wide this summer with the additions of Jamie Gittens and Estevao Willian, while they continue to work on a deal for Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig.\nChelsea transfer news: Attacking midfielder linked\nIn other news, a report has revealed Chelsea are likely to be a Premier League attacking midfielder’s next club – much to the frustration of one of their rivals.\nMeanwhile, two Chelsea players are set to join the same club when leaving Stamford Bridge – but on different terms.\nAnd the Blues’ sister club Strasbourg are completing a signing on Chelsea’s behalf.\nSterling’s Chelsea spell at a glance\n- July 13, 2022: Sterling becomes the first signing of Chelsea’s new regime, completing a £47.5m move from Manchester City.\n- August 6, 2022: Thomas Tuchel gives Sterling his Chelsea debut in a Premier League win over Everton.\n- August 27, 2022: Sterling opens his Chelsea account by scoring a match-winning brace against Leicester City.\n- May 28, 2023: Sterling’s first season as a Chelsea player concludes with nine goals from 38 games.\n- August 25, 2023: Sterling scores a brace to help Chelsea to their first win of the new season against Luton Town.\n- May 19, 2024: Sterling scores on the final day of the season to finish his second campaign with 10 goals from 43 games.\n- August 21, 2024: New Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca reveals he had told Sterling he would ‘struggle’ for gametime.\n- August 30, 2024: Arsenal sign Sterling on a season-long loan.\n- September 25, 2024: Sterling scores his first and last goal as an Arsenal player.",
