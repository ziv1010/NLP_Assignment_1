We have a normal and professional discussion and debate about it.”\nPushed on whether he was concerned there was truth behind reports of player unhappiness, the United manager said: “No.\n“Of course there are always in every team players who are playing less, who are less happy…. you have to wait for their chance and that can come, but, no, there are no issues.”\nThere were no questions in the press conference about Wednesday’s match against Chelsea, who are managed by Mauricio Pochettino — the man considered Ten Hag’s main rival for the Old Trafford post in 2022.\nThe former Ajax boss quickly oversaw improvements on and off the pitch at United, but this season there has been criticism about the manager’s approach.\n“I listen always to my players,” the Dutchman said. “And I give them always the opportunities to tell (me). If the players have a different opinion, of course I will listen.\n“But they haven’t told me, or maybe one or two (have), but it’s about in general, so the majority, they want to play like this — proactive, dynamic, brave. That is what they want.\n“You can see the players are behind it because of the performances against Everton, Galatasaray, and we are really improving.”",
