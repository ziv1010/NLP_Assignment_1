The move sees Ziyech return home for the very first time in his club career.\nThe Moroccan international spent most of his career in Europe, plying his trade for clubs such as Heerenveen, Twente, Ajax, Galatasaray, and more notable Chelsea, whom he helped clinch the UEFA Champions League back in 2021.\nZiyech’s decision ends months of speculation about his future following his exit from Al-Duhail in May. The 32 Year-old is said to have signed a lucrative two-year deal, with an option to extend for a further season.\nHe is expected to be formally unveiled next week as he begins a new chapter, playing in Morocco for the first time. The timing of his move could not be more fitting. With the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations being hosted in Morocco and the 2026 World Cup on the horizon, Ziyech’s return to regular football gives him a chance to reclaim his spot in Walid Regragui’s plans.\nThe national coach has, on numerous occasions said that Ziyech’s absence was purely down to fitness and form, hinting that a revival at Wydad could quickly open the door to a comeback.\nWydad supporters are already gearing up for a hero’s welcome, with thousands expected to attend his introduction ceremony at the Mohammed V Stadium.",
