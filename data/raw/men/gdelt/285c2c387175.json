The fan was photographed at Wembley Stadium showing off a customised Manchester United jersey which mocked the death of 97 Liverpool fans at Hillsborough. The back of the jersey featured the number 97 on it and the words 'Not enough'.\nThe photograph of the vile shirt quickly circulated on social media with Liverpool fan accounts urging action against the unnamed man.\nThe Hillsborough disaster in 1989 saw 97 men, women and child die as a result of a crush at an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest in Sheffield.\nThe Metropolitan Police Events Twitter account responded to anger from Liverpool fans by tweeting:\"#ARREST We are aware of this and have worked proactively with officials at @wembleystadium to identify the individual.\n\"He has been arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and taken into custody.\"\nJUST IN: Police officers rushed to hospital after chaotic stabbing attack\nThe man was later photographed in handcuffs and being put into a police van.\nThe police had responded to a photograph of the shirt shared by @LiverpoolPhotox, which wrote: \"A Man Utd fan at Wembley today.\n\"Get this man’s face spread across social media ASAP, he needs to face repercussions.\"\nAnother Liverpool fan account @LFCVine tweeted: \"A Man Utd fan at Wembley earlier.\n\"Genuinely disgusting, hopefully, he gets identified and prosecuted accordingly.\"\nPep Guardiola previews FA Cup final\nIn a post on Twitter reacting to the man’s arrest, the Hillsborough Survivors Support Alliance said: “Let this be a warning to anyone else thinking of doing anything similar. And that goes for using any tragedy.”\nAn inquest jury ruled in 2016 that the fans attending the Hillsborough match were unlawfully killed amid a number of police errors.\nIn March 2023, both Manchester United and Liverpool jointly called on fans to end \"tragedy chanting\" ahead of a Premier League match at Anfield.\n'Tragedy chanting' has become prominent in recent months with supporters mocking their opponents over past incidents in which fans have lost their lives.\nDon't miss: Police officers rushed to hospital after chaotic stabbing attack\nDon't miss: Britain's 10 best seaside towns have been named - but one is next to power plant\nDon't miss: Mum's heartbreak after girl, 15, dies in lake tragedy\nA Premier League working group was set up this year to tackle the issue, involving clubs, the Football Association, English, and the Football Supporters’ Association.\nMeanwhile, the FA Cup final ended in a Manchester City victory as they beat their rivals 2-1.\nThis means Manchester City, who have now secured the domestic double, could soon win the treble as a Champions League Final awaits.\nDuring the game, Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof was reportedly struck with an object from the crowd when United celebrated their equaliser.\nThe Metropolitan Police have confirmed that they will work with officials to review CCTV footage and identify the culprit.",
