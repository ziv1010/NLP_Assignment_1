He will get a warm welcome from me but let’s see how our fans react, I have no clue. A warm welcome from me, that is for certain.’\nLiverpool midfielder Ryan Gravenberch had a similar message, saying: ‘From the fans, I don’t know what reception he will get. But when I see him he is a friend of mine.’\nAlexander-Arnold has not played since suffering a hamstring injury on September 16, but is back from that problem and is hoping to feature on Merseyside.\nMORE: Arne Slot sends message to Liverpool fans ahead of Trent Alexander-Arnold’s return\nMORE: Pep Guardiola makes Arsenal title claim after Man City and Liverpool wins\nMORE: Virgil van Dijk fires back at Wayne Rooney after criticism from Man Utd legend",
