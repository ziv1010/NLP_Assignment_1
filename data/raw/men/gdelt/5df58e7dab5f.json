Earlier this month, head coach Roger Schmidt said he was confident that Fernandez will stay in Portugal until at least the summer.\nEnzo Fernandez full story\nChelsea's transfer saga with Enzo Fernandez despite appearing to reach a conclusion earlier in the January transfer window could yet take another turn before deadline day.\nThe Blues focused their attention on Moises Caicedo after advances for Fernandez were rejected by Benfica who were demanding Chelsea paid the World Cup winners £106million release clause in full.\nAfter talk of a move died down in recent weeks, Chelsea have been handed two significant updates on Fernandez as Todd Boehly hopes to add a new midfielder to Graham Potter's squad before the end of the window.\nRead the full story here\nMoises Caicedo full story\nBrighton manager Roberto De Zerbi has reiterated that he hopes Moises Caicedo will stay at the club until the end of the season.

For everyone there are many solutions and we will see the best solution for the club and for him and for us.\"\nLukaku exit for Vlahovic\nChelsea could face a huge Romelu Lukaku problem in the summer once his loan from Inter Milan expires. The Blues forked out £100million to sign him in the summer of 2021 but the move has not worked out in the slightest.\nThe Belgian striker was loaned back to the club Chelsea bought him from but that temporary spell back in Italy has not worked out in his favour, with injuries plaguing his campaign.\nHowever, Chelsea could have a great opportunity to get him off their books and sign a natural striker.\nCalcio Mercato claim that Chelsea could offer Lukaku to Juventus and thus sign Dusan Vlahovic as part of a swap deal. It is stressed that this deal would be a difficult one to accept and money would therefore likely be needed in the deal to help convince Juve to accept the proposal.\nCaicedo alternative eyed\nArsenal and Chelsea look set for an interesting final few days of the January transfer window as both clubs push to sign Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo. The Blues sent a £55million bid to the Seagulls for Caicedo but saw that rejected, with the Gunners then making a push to sign the 21-year-old.\nBrighton received a £60million bid for Caicedo from Arsenal on Friday, football.london understands.

The 19-year-old full-back arrives on a six-and-a-half-year contract and will be loaned back to the Ligue 1 side for the rest of the season.\nThe arrival of Gusto takes Todd Boehly's January spending to £213.7million following Joao Felix, Benoit Badiashile, Mykhailo Mudryk, Noni Madueke, Andrey Santos and David Datro Fofana through the door at Stamford Bridge.\nUpon signing for Chelsea, Gusto said: \"I like the city [London]. I am really really happy to come here. I chose Chelsea because it's a very big club and I like the project. I am very happy to be here. Thank you for your messages. See you soon\"\nWhy Malo Gusto deal was completed in January\nChelsea have confirmed their latest January signing, with Malo Gusto set to join the club from Lyon in a deal worth £26.3million. The 19-year-old has signed a six-and-a-half-year contract and been immediately loaned back to the French club until the end of the season.\nAs football.london reported earlier this month, Gusto had agreed personal terms with the Blues ahead of significant negotiations taking place between the two clubs. A fee being agreed by both clubs was never a mass issue, yet it seemed as though a winter deal being agreed was at risk of collapsing.\nThe Blues sent in an official bid for the 19-year-old last week that was rejected, before a £20.2million offer was proposed to Lyon on Tuesday which also was rebuffed, as football.london understands. Todd Boehly was prepared to return with another offer for Gusto, but then proceedings took a dramatic turn.\nRead the full story here\nChelsea fans react to Malo Gusto transfer\nChelsea have confirmed the signing of young full-back Malo Gusto from Lyon on a six-and-a-half-year deal, running until 2030. The youngster is said to have joined for a fee of £26.3million, with the Frenchman returning to his former Ligue 1 club on loan for the remainder of the season.\nThe 19-year-old has made 15 league appearances so far this season, having been capped seven times by the France under-21s national team. Gusto offers plenty of promise for the future as well as a rotation option for Reece James, who has struggled with injuries over the past year and his absence is notable.\nChelsea fans have now provided their reaction to the news of January arrival number seven.\nRead the full story here\nMalo Gusto signs\nJanuary arrival number seven has been confirmed by Chelsea as Malo Gusto signs from Lyon\nRead the full story here\nChelsea still hold Rice advantage\nChelsea and Arsenal are currently battling it out to sign Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo and could face a similar duel in the summer for Declan Rice.\nThe Blues have held a long-term interest in the West Ham captain with Mikel Arteta now identifying the England international as his top target for the summer. Despite the current appeal of joining the Gunners as they sit top of the league, Chelsea could still hold the upper hand according to journalist Ryan Taylor on Give Me Sport.\nTaylor said: “I do personally think those reports [Arsenal] are premature. I think you can’t underestimate the influence that Rice is a boyhood Chelsea fan; his entire family are Chelsea fans and he spent eight or nine years with the club before being released as a 14-year-old.\n“I think in his head, there will be an element of unfinished business there at Chelsea.”\nMoises Caicedo price tag admission\nChelsea and Arsenal look set for a crazy end to the January transfer window with both clubs interested in signing Moises Caicedo.\nHowever, they face a tough task to do so with Brighton remaining firm on their stance that he is not for sale, instead upping their asking price to £90million. If an exit is not secured this month, it's likely that the demand and the high asking price will not be there in the summer.\nMoises Caicedo transfer twist\nArsenal and Chelsea may have been handed a twist in the Moises Caicedo transfer saga by rivals Manchester United heading into the final few days of the January transfer window. Both London clubs have been heavily linked with making a move for the Brighton star this month.\nThe Blues were first, lodging a bid that was reported to be in the £55million range for the 21-year-old as a solution to their midfield concerns. The Seagulls swiftly shot down that proposal but that didn't stop the Gunners making their own offer as football.london understands a £60million bid was tabled and also rejected.\nThe Ecuador international has since taken things into his own hands as a statement was released on his future and desire to leave the south coast club.\nRead the full story here\nChristopher Nkunku signing helps Chelsea fix 14-year problem\nChelsea are set to welcome Christopher Nkunku to Graham Potter's squad in the summer after the Blues made a pre-contract agreement with the RB Leipzig forward, football.london understands. An agreement for Nkunku's transfer is said to have been finalised, with Todd Boehly prepared to activate his £52million release clause.\nChelsea have struggled in attack this season with a number of key players misfiring in front of goals this term. Kai Havertz has scored just six goals in 27 appearances this season, whilst Deadline Day signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has managed just three goals since arriving from Barcelona in the summer.\nArmando Broja is set to miss the remainder of the 2022/23 campaign through injury, whilst Raheem Sterling and Christian Pulisic have also been sidelined since the start of January. The need for a world-class finisher is stark for all to see at Stamford Bridge and Nkunku's arrival could finally fix a key problem for Potter.\nLast season, the France international scored an astonishing 31 goals and also registered 20 assists in 48 appearances for Leipzig in all competitions. Nkunku is currently the top scorer in the Bundesliga this season having notched 12 goals in 15 appearances, ahead of Niklas Fulkrig (11) and Marcus Thuram (10) - with the latter having been linked with a January switch to the Blues.\nThe Leipzig star could add to his tally once he returns from injury as he looks to recapture his stellar form ahead of his move to west London. Chelsea have not had a Premier League golden boot winner since Didier Drogba scored 29 goals in the 2009/2010 season.\nNkunku's statistics during his time in Germany prove his arrival could spell the end of the Blues' problems in front of goal and see them compete at the top of the league again next season.\nBarcelona can hand Chelsea £13m transfer windfall as Todd Boehly agrees Malo Gusto signing\nChelsea could be set to receive a significant transfer windfall with Barcelona prepared to reignite their interest in Cesar Azpilicueta. The Catalan club were keen on signing the Blues' captain in the summer but Azpilicueta rejected their approach in favour of signing a new contract at Stamford Bridge.\nSpanish outlet SPORT has claimed that Barcelona could reignite their interest in Azpilicueta in the summer transfer window. Despite signing an extension keeping him at Chelsea until 2024, a move back to his home country could be of interest if he’s guaranteed more regular minutes.\nThe 33-year-old is valued at €15million (£13.1million) by CIES Football Observatory, but with just a year left on his contract in the summer, the Blues may struggle to get in excess of £10million.\nLeague Two job for Jody Morris\nFormer Chelsea coach and midfielder Jody Morris looks set to be unveiled as the new manager of League Two club Swindon Town. The 44-year-old was in the stands for the Robins crazy 3-3 draw with Gillingham on Saturday.\nMalo Gusto completes medical after Chelsea agree £26.3m transfer\nLyon defender Malo Gusto arrived in London on Saturday morning to complete a medical ahead of a summer transfer to Chelsea. The Blues agreed a £26.3million fee plus add-ons to sign the 19-year-old before loaning him back to Lyon until the end of the season.\nThe Lyon defender has completed his medical tests ahead of becoming a Chelsea player, before returning to France until the summer. The teenager was due to feature for Lyon in their Ligue 1 clash against Ajaccio on Sunday but will now miss that game in order to complete his medical, according to reports in France.\nBrighton set huge Moises Caicedo transfer fee as Arsenal and Chelsea have bids rejected\nArsenal lodged a £60million bid for Moises Caicedo had been rejected on Friday football.london understands. The Gunners submitted a proposal for the Ecuadorian international to Brighton, but it is thought that the Seagulls rejected the approach promptly. That follows a £55million bid from Chelsea which was rejected earlier this week.\nThe two London clubs have been on the hunt for a midfielder during the January transfer window. Chelsea had their eyes set on Enzo Fernandes in the opening weeks, but have seemed to switch their attention to Caicedo more recently with Benfica refusing to negotiate over the World Cup star's £106million release clause.\nAccording to the Independent, Arsenal and Chelsea need to go to £90million to sign Moises Caicedo from Brighton, with the player's rebellious actions leaving the club's stance unchanged.",
