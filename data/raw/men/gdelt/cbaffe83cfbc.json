If we can win both halves and we get the luck which we didn’t get in the first leg, then everything is possible.\n“It’s a difficult task and we shouldn’t make it more difficult by looking only at the top of the mountain\n“We need to bring the crowd with us so they can create the kind of energy which you get in games where special things happen,” said the Bayern coach.\nThe Bayern boss, whose side also slumped to a disappointing 1-1 draw at home to relegation candidates Hoffenheim on Saturday, admitted his players were not in their best form.\n“We’ve looked a bit cramped and lacking confidence recently, but in football, things can change very quickly,” he said.\nMane returns\nTuchel can count on the return of striker Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting, who missed Bayern’s last three games with a knee injury but took part in training on Tuesday.\n“We’ll have to see how his knee reacts to our final session, but if we get the green light he is definitely an option,” said the Bayern coach.\nSenegal international Sadio Mane will also return to the squad after he was suspended for a dressing room altercation with teammate Leroy Sane in Manchester last week.\nTuchel insisted that Bayern had put the episode behind them and rejected City manager Pep Guardiola’s suggestion that the internal conflict could give Bayern a boost in the second leg.\n“I see Pep’s point. We wanted to turn it into positive energy for the next game, but we didn’t really do that against Hoffenheim. I don’t think it will make a difference on Wednesday,” he said.\nAFP",
