He had to settle for a loan deal to Turkish giants, Galatasaray where he has been in excellent scoring form.\nSpeaking on the circumstances that led to the unceremonious exit of Osimhen from Napoli, Garcia said matter-of-factly that the Napoli President lacks the necessary footballing acumen to navigate such complex situations, adding ‘Aurelio De Laurentiis simply doesn’t understand football’ in an interview with Haber Sarı Kırmızı.\nRead Also: NFF holds match commissioners’ seminar in Kaduna\nHe continued: “Had he opted to keep me at the helm, we would have qualified for the Champions League instead of languishing in 10th place. At my age, I won’t let a president dictate how I manage my team.\n“I became a scapegoat because I insisted he remain in his lane,” Garcia lamented.\nOsimhen’s contract saga has been a major talking point in recent months. The Nigerian striker’s contract was set to expire next summer, which led to a series of offers from other clubs. However, De Laurentiis insisted on a €130 million valuation, which ultimately led to Osimhen being loaned out to Galatasaray.\nDespite extending his contract until 2026, Osimhen’s future at Napoli remains uncertain. Garcia’s comments have only added fuel to the fire, and it remains to be seen how the situation will unfold in the coming months.",
