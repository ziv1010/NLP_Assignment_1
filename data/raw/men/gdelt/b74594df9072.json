I think the ball hit his hand… but the referee decided it was a penalty and a red card [for Vivian],’ Athletic head coach Ernesto Valverde told reporters at his post-match press conference.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

The play before the penalty comes from a handball by Garnacho, which the referee doesn’t see.\n‘It’s a struggle between Vivian and him. At the slightest contact, he goes down, and it’s unfortunate that he called it.\nWilliams conceded that Athletic were far from their best across the 90 minutes, but stressed that the tie was from from over ahead of next week’s return leg at Old Trafford.\n‘We weren’t very sharp, there’s no need to make excuses,’ he added.\n‘We’re 3-0 down, but we’re capable of overcoming that.

I know this Athletic Bilbao team very well, I know there have great players.\n‘We have to show a lot of respect and I ask on behalf of Manchester and everyone that we have to have respect them as an opponent because they never give up.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Ruben Amorim names two ‘nervous’ Man Utd stars who needed help against Athletic Bilbao\nMORE: Paul Scholes pinpoints where ‘sloppy’ Man Utd must improve despite huge Europa League win\nMORE: Harry Maguire channels his inner Lamine Yamal with sensational display in Man Utd victory",
