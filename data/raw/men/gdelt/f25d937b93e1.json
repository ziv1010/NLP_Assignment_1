The astonishing life of Silvio Berlusconi\n- Silvio Berlusconi was plagued by scandal and once compared himself to Jesus\n- Despite being diagnosed with leukaemia, he was active in politics until his death\n- READ MORE: Italy's scandal-hit former PM Silvio Berlusconi dead at 86\nSilvio Berlusconi, the boastful billionaire media mogul who was Italy's longest-serving premier despite scandals over his sex-fueled parties and allegations of corruption, has died aged 86.\nThe larger-than-life character, who once compared himself to Jesus, dominated Italian public life for decades, but much of his life was also plagued by scandal.\nLong before Donald Trump parlayed his business success into a White House bid, Berlusconi was charming millions of Italians by presenting himself as a self-made man who enjoyed life and spoke his mind, even to the extent of insulting fellow leaders.\nAlthough he cultivated a reputation as a charismatic statesman, he also became known for his so-called 'Bunga Bunga' sex parties attended by young girls including underage escorts like 'Ruby the Heart Stealer'. The allegations were only wrapped up in February 2023 following his acquittal.\nBerlusconi also wielded huge influence through his television and newspaper interests - he effectively invented commercial TV in Italy - his ownership of AC Milan football club, and his sheer wealth, as Italy's richest person for a decade.\nDespite being diagnosed with leukaemia, he was active in politics to the end as a senator and partner in Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's rightwing government.\nSilvio Berlusconi, pictured aged 50, crosses his arms on his private jet flying from Rome to Milan. The larger-than-life character, who once compared himself to Jesus, has died aged 86\nSilvio Berlusconi at the beach in Hammamet in Tunisia in August 1984. He has died aged 86\nSilvio Berlusconi, then an Italian television manager, and French businessman Jerome Seydoux joke together after a press conference, at Marigny theater in Paris\nA young Silvio Berlusconi singing on a Cruise ship in the 1960s\nBerlusconi was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2013 for paying for sex with Karima El-Mahroug (pictured), known as 'Ruby the Heart Stealer' - but this was later overturned by a judge\nA onetime cruise ship crooner, Berlusconi used his television networks and immense wealth to launch his long political career, inspiring both loyalty and loathing.\nTo admirers, the three-time premier was a capable and charismatic statesman who sought to elevate Italy on the world stage. To critics, the right-winger was a tax-evading playboy who used his vast media empire to further his political career, and then exploited his power to protect his business interests.\nDespite remaining president of his Forza Italia party, a junior partner in Meloni's coalition, he had largely retired from public view in recent months.\nHe suffered increasing health problems - although he maintained his pride in his appearance, always smartly dressed, his slicked-back hair never showing the slightest trace of grey.\nBerlusconi was hospitalised for 11 days in September 2020 after contracting coronavirus, describing it as 'perhaps the most difficult ordeal of my life'.\nIn April 2023, doctors revealed he was in intensive care suffering from leukaemia and a lung infection.\nAs Berlusconi aged, some derided his perpetual tan, hair transplants and live-in girlfriends who were decades younger. For many years, however, Berlusconi seemed untouchable despite the personal scandals.\nCriminal cases were launched but ended in dismissals when statutes of limitations ran out in Italy's slow-moving justice system, or he was victorious on appeal. Investigations targeted the tycoon's steamy so-called 'Bunga Bunga' parties involving young women and minors, or his businesses, which included the soccer team AC Milan, the country's three biggest private TV networks, magazines and a daily newspaper, and advertising and film companies.\nOnly one led to a conviction - a tax fraud case stemming from a sale of movie rights in his business empire. The conviction was upheld in 2013 by Italy's top criminal court, but he was spared prison because of his age, 76, and was ordered to do community service by assisting Alzheimer's patients.\nAC Milan president Silvio Berlusconi is shoulder-carried by Milan players after winning the 1988 Italian championship at Milan's San Siro stadium\nSilvio Berlusconi holds a press conference announcing his debut in politics at the foreign press conference room on November 26, 1993 in Rome, Italy\nSilvio Berlusconi and Francesca Pascale in Ravello, at the wedding of her sister Marianna Pascale in Ravello, Italy, Oct 13, 2017\nFormer Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 85, holds a 'symbolic wedding' to his 32-year-old MP bride Marta Fascina\nSilvio Berlusconi, and his partner Marta Fascina arrive to cast their vote on September 25, 2022 at a polling station in Milan\nSilvio Berlusconi and his then wife Veronica Lario in Rome, Italy, 24 May 2005\nBerlusconi was still was stripped of his Senate seat and banned from running or holding public office for six years, under anti-corruption laws.\nHe stayed at the helm of Forza Italia, the center-right party he created when he entered politics in the 1990s and named for a soccer cheer, 'Let's go, Italy.' With no groomed successor in sight, voters started to desert it.\nHe eventually held office again - elected to the European Parliament at age 82 and then last year to the Italian Senate.\nBerlusconi's party was eclipsed as the dominant force on Italy's political right: first by the League, led by anti-migrant populist Salvini, then by Meloni's Brothers of Italy party, with its roots in neo-fascism. Following elections in 2022, Meloni formed a governing coalition with their help.\nHe suffered personal humiliations as well. Berlusconi lost his standing as Italy's richest man, although his sprawling media holdings and luxury real estate still left him a billionaire several times over.\nIn 2013, guests at one of his parties included an under-age Moroccan dancer whom prosecutors alleged had sex with Berlusconi in exchange for cash and jewelry. After a trial spiced by lurid details, a Milan court initially convicted Berlusconi of paying for sex with a minor and using his office to try to cover it up. Both denied having sex with each other, and he was eventually acquitted.\nThe Catholic Church, at times sympathetic to his conservative politics, was scandalized by his antics, and his wife of nearly 20 years divorced him, but Berlusconi was unapologetic, declaring: 'I'm no saint.'\nBerlusconi insisted that voters were impressed by his brashness.\n'The majority of Italians in their hearts would like to be like me and see themselves in me and in how I behave,' he said in 2009, during his third and final stint as premier.\nHis second term, from 2001-06, was perhaps his golden era, when he became Italy's longest-serving head of government and boosted its global profile through his friendship with U.S. President George W. Bush. Bucking widespread sentiment at home and in Europe, Berlusconi backed the U.S.-led war in Iraq.\nAs a businessman who knew the power of images, Berlusconi introduced U.S.-style political campaigns - with big party conventions and slick advertising - that broke with the gray world of Italian politics, in which voters essentially chose parties and not candidates. His rivals had to adapt.\nBerlusconi saw himself as Italy's savior from what he described as the Communist menace - years after the Berlin Wall fell. From the start of his political career in 1994, he portrayed himself as the target of a judiciary he described as full of leftist sympathizers. He always proclaimed his innocence.\nWhen the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement gained strength, Berlusconi branded it as a menace worse than Communism.\nHis close friendship with longtime Socialist leader and former Premier Bettino Craxi was widely credited for helping him become a media baron. Still, Berlusconi billed himself as a self-made man, saying, 'My formula for success is to be found in four words: work, work and work.'\nHe boasted of his libido and entertained friends and world leaders at his villas. At one party, newspapers reported the women were dressed as 'little Santas.' At another, photos showed topless women and a naked man lounging poolside.\n'I love life! I love women!' an unrepentant Berlusconi said in 2010.\nHe occasionally selected TV starlets for posts in his Forza Italia party. 'If I weren't married, I would marry you immediately,' Berlusconi reportedly said in 2007 to Mara Carfagna, who later became a Cabinet minister. Berlusconi's wife publicly demanded an apology.\nLibyan leader Moamer Kadhafi (L) greets Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi during a meeting in Sirte, 10 February, 2004\nPope Benedict XVI is escorted by Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi, right, as he leaves for his pastoral trip to the Czech Republic from Ciampino Military airport, near Rome\nThen-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, holds on to the arm of U.S. President George W.

Later, self-described escort Patrizia D'Addario said she spent the night with him on the evening that Barack Obama was elected U.S. president in 2008.\nFrom his cruise ship entertainer days, Berlusconi loved to compose and sing Neapolitan songs. Like millions of Italians, he had a passion for soccer, and often was in the stands at AC Milan.\nHe delighted in flouting political etiquette. He sported a bandanna when hosting British Prime Minister Tony Blair at his estate on the Emerald Coast of Sardinia, and it was later revealed he was concealing hair transplants. He posed for photos at international summits making an Italian gesture - which can be offensive or superstitious, depending on circumstances - in which the index and pinkie fingers are extended like horns.\nHe stirred anger after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States by claiming Western civilization was superior to Islam.\nWhen criticised in 2003 at the European Parliament by a German lawmaker, Berlusconi likened his adversary to a concentration camp guard. Years later, he drew outrage when he compared his family's legal woes to what Jews must have encountered in Nazi Germany.\nBerlusconi was born in Milan on Sept. 29, 1936, the son of a middle-class banker. He earned a law degree, writing his thesis on advertising. He started a construction company at 25 and built apartment complexes for middle-class families on Milan's outskirts, part of a postwar boom.\nBut his astronomical wealth came from the media. In the late 1970s and 1980s, he circumvented Italy's state TV monopoly RAI by creating a de facto network in which local stations all showed the same programming. RAI and Mediaset accounted for about 90% of the national market in 2006.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin meets with former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at Fiumicino airport in Rome early on July 5, 2019\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, right, and former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi visit a memorial to the soldiers from Sardinia killed in the Crimean War, near Mount Gasfort outside Sevastopol in Crimea, Friday, Sept. 11, 2015\nItalian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi (C) pictured in a gesture to stop shaking hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin's (L) and US President George W.

But aided by an aggressive campaign that included mass mailings of glossy magazines recounting his success story, Berlusconi swept to victory in 2001.\nShuffling his Cabinet occasionally, he stayed in power for five years, setting a record for government longevity in Italy. It wasn't easy.\nA Group of Eight summit he hosted in Genoa in 2001 was marred by violent anti-globalization demonstrations and the death of a protester shot by a police officer. Berlusconi faced fierce domestic opposition and alienated some allies by sending 3,000 troops to Iraq after the ouster of Saddam Hussein in 2003. For a time, Italy was the third-largest contingent in the U.S. coalition.\nAt home, he constantly faced accusations of sponsoring laws aimed at protecting himself or his businesses, but he insisted he always acted in the interest of all Italians. Legislation passed when he was premier allowing officeholders to own media businesses but not run them was deemed by his critics to be tailor made for Berlusconi.\nAC Milan's president Silvio Berlusconi (right) and Brazilian football star Ronaldo (left) arrive for the Champions League final football match against Liverpool at the Olympic Stadium, in Athens, on May 23, 2007\nAC Milan former coach Arrigo Sacchi (left) AC Milan president Silvio Berlusconi (second from right) and Franco Baresi, right, show the Intercontinental Cup as they arrive at the Milan Linate airport on December 1990\nTha players of AC Milan and Silvio Berlusconi celebrate after winning the Berlusconi Trophy during the match between AC Milan and Juventus FC at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on August 21, 2011\nAC Milan's Silvio Berlusconi raises the trophy aloft as he stands with his team after they beat Liverpool 2-1 to win the Champions League at the Olympic Stadium in Athens, on May 23, 2007\nItalian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi visiting Anitkabir, mausoleum of Turkish Republic's Founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, in Ankara, Turkey\nSilvio Berlusconi leaves the San Raffaele hospital after a 45-day of hospitalization, in Milan, northern Italy, 19 May 2023\nAn admirer of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Berlusconi passed reforms that partially liberalized the labor and pension systems, among Europe's most inflexible. He also was chummy with Putin, who stayed at his Sardinian estate, and he visited the Russian leader, notably going to Crimea after Moscow illegally annexed the peninsula in 2014.\nIn 2006, as Italy was ridiculed as 'the sick man of Europe,' with its economy mired in zero growth and its budget deficit rising, Berlusconi narrowly lost the general election to center-left leader Romano Prodi, who had been president of the European Union Commission.\nIn 2008, he bounced back for what would be his final term as premier. It ended abruptly in 2011, when financial markets lost faith in his ability to keep Italy from succumbing to the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis. To the relief of economic powerhouse Germany, Berlusconi reluctantly stepped down.\nHealth concerns dogged him over the years. He underwent surgery for prostate cancer in 1997. In November 2006, he fainted during a speech, and the next month flew to the U.S., where he received a pacemaker at the Cleveland Clinic. He underwent more heart surgery in 2016.\nDuring a political rally in 2009, a man threw a souvenir statuette of Milan's cathedral at Berlusconi, fracturing his nose, cracking two teeth and cutting his lip.\nBerlusconi was first married in 1965 to Carla Dall'Oglio, and their two children, Marina and Piersilvio, were groomed to hold top positions in his business empire. He married his second wife, Veronica Lario, in 1990, and they had three children, Barbara, Eleonora and Luigi.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured",
