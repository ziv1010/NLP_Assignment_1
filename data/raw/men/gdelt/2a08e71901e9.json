In his first season with the club scored an incredible 52 goals in all competitions and won Premier League Golden Boot, Player of the Season and Young Player of the Season awards.\nSpeaking to PA ahead of the final, Inter manager Inzaghi was asked about how he intends to try and stop the 22-year-old: \"Haaland said City bought him to win the Champions League, but City isn't just Haaland; they have numerous players who can put us in trouble.\n\"Rudiger managed to stop him very well in the semi-final and we'll try to take our cue from that.\"\nRead the latest Champions League news here\nInzaghi was also keen to insist that, while Inter 'respect' City, they do not fear them\n\"We're talking about a football match and with all due respect, I’m not afraid of anything,\" the Inter boss stressed. \"Guardiola is the best coach in the world and he has marked an era. We have respect, but we are proud to play in this final that we wanted with all our strength.\n\"It will be the last of 57 matches in which even the much-talked-about defeats have allowed us to get to where we will be on Saturday.\"",
