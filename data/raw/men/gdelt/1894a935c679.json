However, with the Gunners signing Trossard in January and Reiss Nelson penning a new deal, a Diaby move was put on the backburner.\nThat left the door ajar for Newcastle who are seeking an upgrade on Allan Saint-Maximin this summer. The Magpies will grace the Champions League for the first time since 2003 next year and require widemen with superior end product.\nDiaby certainly fits that bill having notched an incredible 81 goal contributions over the last three seasons with Bayer Leverkusen.\nEven more remarkable is his consistency, with Diaby hitting double figures in both goals and assists in each of the last three campaigns.\nHowever, with Newcastle turning their attention to Leicester’s Harvey Barnes instead, they too have left the path clear for another to strike.\nAccording to French outlet L’Equipe, Aston Villa required no second invitation and have opened the bidding for Diaby.\nAs cited by Get French Football News, it’s revealed Villa’s offer is considered a ‘good starting point’ by Leverkusen. The value of the bid hasn’t yet been revealed, though early indications suggest it’s certainly got Leverkusen’s attention.\nOn that front, the German side are reportedly open to cashing in for the right price this summer.\nThe Daily Mail recently reported Leverkusen quoted Villa an asking price of £51m (€60m) for the 24-year-old. Such a price – or even one that comes close to that sum – would smash Villa’s transfer record.\nThe £38m paid to sign Emiliano Buendia from Norwich remains Villa’s biggest buy to date.\nWould Diaby say yes to Aston Villa?\nOn the subject of whether Diaby would be willing to join Villa, L’Equipe suggest the news is mixed.\nFirstly, the lack of Champions League football could be an issue. However, Leverkusen only finished sixth last season anyway, meaning UCL football wouldn’t be on offer if he stayed. It’d be a different story if joining Newcastle who will return to European football’s top table next season.\nIn any case, UCL football won’t be the only factor swaying Diaby’s thinking. His international ambitions with France at Euro 2024 are also in play.\nTo ensure he makes the cut and features ahead of the likes of Marcus Thuram and Randal Kolo Muani, Diaby knows he must play regularly next season.\nWhile Villa are certainly a club on the up, it stands to reason Diaby would walk into Unai Emery’s strongest eleven without delay.\nAnother club hovering over Diaby is Serie A champions Napoli. However, in another indication of just how financially strong the Premier League is, it’s claimed Napoli won’t be able to match Villa when it comes to hard numbers.",
