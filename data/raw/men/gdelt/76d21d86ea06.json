That was the closest side either came in a dull first half.\nArsenal registered their first effort on target six minutes after the restart. Mikel Merino arrived late from Declan Rice’s delivery but Matz Sels parried the header away.\nThe Gunners were camped in the Forest final third and threatened with more set-pieces as Kieran Tierney was off target from one corner while Sels did well to punch away another.\nForest finally forced David Raya into a meaningful save in the 70th minute when Morgan Gibbs-White slipped in Chris Wood but the striker fired straight at the goalkeeper.\nNeither side had the quality to break the deadlock as another nail was hammered into the coffin of Arsenal’s title challenge.\nIreland defender Jake O’Brien’s first Everton goal stretched their unbeaten run to seven Premier League matches after a 1-1 draw at Brentford.\nYoane Wissa’s 13th goal of the season looked set to condemn boss David Moyes to only a second defeat in his eighth league match back in charge.\nBut O’Brien’s second-half header made it 15 points from a possible 24 since Moyes returned to the hot-seat.\nMan of the Match 🌟🌟\n— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) February 26, 2025\nJake O'Brien happy after scoring Everton's equaliser tonight! pic.twitter.com/7LMg5rZlkq\nThe Toffees could have won it as well, had in-form striker Beto not come out on the wrong side of his personal duel with Bees goalkeeper Mark Flekken. Beto, with five goals in his last four league matches, should have scored at least one more before half-time, first when Bees defender Ethan Pinnock slipped as he tried to deal with a long ball.\nBeto went through one-on-one with Flekken, but his shot was blocked by the Bees keeper. Moments later a Charly Alcaraz header sent Beto through once more, but again Flekken was out quickly to make another fine save.\nAn injury to Alcaraz halted Everton’s momentum, and in the subsequent stoppage time Brentford struck. When Schade’s throw bounced in the Everton penalty area, Bryan Mbeumo’s header came back off the crossbar and Wissa was first to react to nod in the rebound.\nAfter the break Wissa had the ball in the net again only to be flagged offside.\nEverton equalised in the 76th minute a the ball was worked to Vitalii Mykolenko on the corner of the area.\nMykolenko launched a high cross to the far post where O’Brien lost his marker Paris Maghoma and dived forward to plant his header past Flekken.\nBeto had another late chance to win it for the visitors, but he was foiled once again by Flekken as the Bees clung on for a point.\nErling Haaland scored his 20th Premier League goal of the season as Manchester City got their push for Champions League qualification back on track with a 1-0 victory at Tottenham.\nCity dominated the ball in the opening stages and it seemed only a matter of time before they would breach Spurs’ back-line.\nJeremy Doku received the ball out wide and after the Belgium international showed great feet to get a yard of space on Pedro Porro, his guided pass was met by the unmarked Haaland who found the bottom-left corner for 1-0.\nDoku then stood the full-back up once again and used his weaker left foot to find the unmarked Savinho at the back post, with City’s opposite winger scuffing the chance for a second goal over the crossbar.\nLucas Bergvall was Tottenham’s shining light in the second half with the teenager’s immense dribbling ability beating City’s press prior to their best chance of the evening.\nAfter the Swede dragged his side up the pitch, Porro was released down the right and his perfect cross was touched wide by the unmarked Wilson Odobert as a huge chance went begging at Ederson’s far post.\nA series of poor attempts from January loan signing Mathys Tel let the visitors off the hook before Spurs ubstitute Son Heung-min was denied by a quick-thinking Ederson, who got down low to keep City’s clean sheet intact late on.\nCity were denied a second during four added minutes after Haaland was deemed to have handled the ball before scoring before Pape Sarr’s skied header from six yards meant City held on.",
