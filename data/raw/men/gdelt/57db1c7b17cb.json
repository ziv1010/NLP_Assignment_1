It's my biggest dream.\n\"It's very nice to see how Madrid plays and the personality that players like Vinicius [Junior], [Eduardo] Camavinga, [Federico] Valverde have.

I might even cry when I hear it.\"\nLISTEN NOW\nOn this edition of Talking Transfers, part of the 90min podcast network, Scott Saunders, Graeme Bailey & Toby Cudworth discuss a potential midfield merry-go-round this summer, Victor Osimhen's chances of joining Chelsea, Mason Mount and Conor Gallagher's futures, Harry Kane, Ilkay Gundogan, Ousmane Dembele & more!\nIf you can't see this embed, click here to listen to the podcast!",
