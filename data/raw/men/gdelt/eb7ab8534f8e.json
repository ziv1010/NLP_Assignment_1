Hakimi fed Dembele, who cut in from the right and beat the goalkeeper at his near post.\nDembele did then strike again almost midway through the second half, trying to feed Bradley Barcola and then seeing the ball break back to him before shooting past Bizot with the aid of a deflection.\nSamuel Mbangula boosted Juventus’ chances of reaching the last 16 by netting the late winner in Tuesday’s 2-1 success over PSV Eindhoven in Turin.\nWinger Mbangula forced home the decisive goal eight minutes from the end at the Allianz Stadium to give Juve a lead to take to next week’s second leg of their play-off tie with PSV.\nThe 21-year-old saved Juve from being stung by Ivan Perisic, who was a fan favourite at the Turin giants’ fiercest rivals Inter Milan and cancelled out Weston McKennie’s cracking first-half opener, with a thunderous strike of his own 10 minutes after half-time.\nJuve travel to the Philips Stadion a week on Wednesday with a good chance of setting up a last-16 showdown with Inter, who they face in Turin on Sunday night.\nEither Inter or Arsenal await whichever of these two teams makes it through the play-offs.\nSerhou Guirassy inspired Borussia Dortmund to a 3-0 win at Sporting Lisbon to help the German side take control of the Champions League play-off round tie.\nGuinea international Guirassy became the competition’s outright top scorer with his 10th goal after an hour before turning provider with a fine cross for Pascal Gross to net the second for last season’s runners-up.\nKarim Adeyemi struck the third as Dortmund’s rapid counter-attack sliced open the hosts at the Jose Alvalade Stadium.\nIt leaves Sporting facing an uphill challenge in the second leg in Dortmund on 19 February.",
