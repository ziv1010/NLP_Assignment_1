Instead, the new format will see 12 groups of four introduced.\nThe excitement of the final round of opening-phase fixtures in Qatar last year was almost too much to handle for the world game governing body’s president, Gianni Infantino, leading him to consider changing course for the expanded tournament in three and a half years.\nAdvertisement\n“The groups of four have been absolutely incredible until the last minute of the last match,” he said before December’s World Cup final. “We have to revisit, or at least rediscuss, the format, whether it’s 16 groups of three or 12 groups of four.\n“This is something that will be on the agenda in the next few weeks.”\nIt was one of the first items on the agenda at the ongoing annual FIFA Congress in Rwanda, and change will follow.\nGO DEEPER\nWorld Cup 2026 to have four-team groups and 104 matches\nBut what do the changes mean for the 2026 tournament?\nWhy didn’t FIFA just leave things the way we like them?\nWell, we would say that, wouldn’t we?\nUs lot, in Europe, where we get to watch the world’s best players in our domestic leagues and continental cups every week.\nEurope, with our lucrative Champions League, European Championship and Nations League competitions.\nEurope, the confederation that has provided the winning team at four of the five most recent men’s World Cups, 15 of the tournament’s past 20 semi-finalists and the last 10 winners of the Club World Cup.\nYeah, the status quo suits us just fine. Why would anyone want to change the rules of a game we are winning?\nInfantino, of course, used to be secretary general of UEFA, European football’s governing body — its chief executive, if you like — so he knows how well its 55 member associations are doing, relatively speaking.\nBut he is now in charge of FIFA, which has 211 member associations across the globe, and many of them are utterly dependent on the money FIFA gives them via development grants.\nAnd FIFA makes more than 90 per cent of its money from the men’s World Cup. Its business cycle is based around that one financial feast, followed by four years of carefully-managed famine. The bigger the feast, the easier the famine is to handle.\nSo, back in November, when Infantino told his worldwide constituency that the organisation made $7.5billion (£6.14bn) in the four-year Qatar 2022 cycle, $1bn more than it made from the preceding Russia 2018 one, everybody clapped. And remember, FIFA is a one-member-one-vote organisation — 211th-ranked San Marino have as big a say as top-ranked Brazil. The minnows matter.\nAdvertisement\nWhen he told the member associations that FIFA’s four-year haul should hit $10bn by 2026, when Canada, Mexico and the United States host that expanded 48-team tournament, some jumped up like they were celebrating a last-minute winner. Because, as Infantino keeps telling them, this is their money.\nThe fact 48 teams are going to be taking part means more games — 104 in fact, more inventory to sell to broadcasters and sponsors, more tickets, more merchandise. But it also ensures 16 further countries will get to the World Cup, with all the commercial and sporting benefits that entails.\nWhen making his pitch for a bigger World Cup, Infantino was always careful to say the financial case for it was a slam dunk but that money is not the only reason to do it. It was important, he said, to spread World Cup fever, to let more fans and players experience its joys, to take its healing powers to all corners of the globe.\nAnd then he would remind them about the money again.\nWhat was the plan for 2026?\nMurmurs of a bigger World Cup began in 2013 when Infantino’s predecessor, Michel Platini, discussed an eight-team expansion — from the 32 teams it’s been since 1998 to 40.\nWhen the Frenchman left in 2016 under a dark cloud, it quickly became apparent to his successor that eight extra places were not quite enough to quench the thirst, particularly from Africa and Asia.\nThe FIFA council was offered five choices for proposed expansion:\n- 48 teams: 16 groups of three, top two sides going through to the knockout rounds; 80 games over 32 days\n- 48 teams: 16 seeds advance to a group stage where they would be joined by winners of play-off round between the remaining 32 teams, then proceed as current format; 80 games over 39 days\n- 40 teams: 10 groups of four, the winners plus six best runners-up proceed to knockout rounds; 76 games over 32 days\n- 40 teams: eight groups of five, top two advance to knockout rounds; 88 games over 39 days\n- 32 teams: eight groups of four, top two to the knockout rounds; 64 games over 28 to 32 days — in other words, the status quo.\nWithout saying it, Infantino could not have made it much clearer he wanted the first option on the above list and the council did not let him down, unanimously voting for it. Sixteen three-team groups would mean a new round-of-32 stage in the knockouts, yet the four countries that reached the semi-finals would still only play seven times.\nThe usual criticisms applied: diluting the quality of the competition, player burnout and reducing the value of the qualifying competitions. But a lot of people ignored the elephant in the room: the risk of collusion in the final group-stage games.\nAdvertisement\nWith a tournament involving three-team groups, one team is left watching while the other two play one another. That means the two teams in the group’s third and final fixture will both know what they need to do to proceed to the knockout phase, and there is a chance that there could be a mutually beneficial result.\nGiven there is an example of this — the ‘Disgrace of Gijon’ — a game embedded in the history of the World Cup, it probably should have been flagged during the council’s voting process.\nGO DEEPER\nThe Disgrace of Gijon: West Germany and Austria's match of shame at 1982 World Cup\nThankfully, from 1986, FIFA ensured that all final group-stage matches would be played at the same time, something that was set to change in 2026.\nWhat’s the plan now?\nCommon sense has prevailed… to a degree.\nThe excitement of the group stages in Qatar has triggered a welcome change.\nThe 48 teams who’ll be competing in the US, Canada and Mexico in 2026 will be split into 12 groups of four rather than 16 of three. As we have become accustomed to, the top two from each of those 12 will automatically progress to the knockouts. The eight best third-placed teams will join them.\nJeopardy had been restored as the final round of group games will be played simultaneously, significantly reducing the chance of collusion and an unwanted repeat of Gijon ’82.\nThe mid-season winter World Cup in Qatar was truly a one-off, as 2026 will return to the World Cup’s traditional slot in the northern hemisphere’s summer.\nThe five tournaments preceding the 2022 iteration were played across either 31 or 32 days. With extra games and teams, the next one will be a 39-day tournament. That added week will not increase the tournament ‘footprint’, though, as it will still be set at 56 days. The pre-tournament release period, previously at 23 days, will be reduced to 16.\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, there will be a lot more games — 40 more, to be precise.\nAdvertisement\nSixty-four games have become the norm since the first 32-team World Cup in France 25 years ago. The initial expansion plan made that impossible, so an 80-game tournament was proposed.\nHowever, now with more group games, there will be a total of 104 matches — great for the fans, not so much for those fearful of player burnout.\nSo… why has it changed again?\nAlmost exclusively because of the 2022 World Cup, where the final round of group-stage games was sublime.\nOnly two teams from the 32 — Canada and Qatar — were already out going into their last group match, and only Brazil, France and Portugal knew they were definitely through.\nThe Group E shootout between Japan, Spain, Germany and Costa Rica was the showstopper. At one time or another, each of those four countries were occupying a qualification place during their section’s final pair of games.\nMeanwhile, in Group C, a single group-stage goal separated Poland and Mexico in their pursuit of a place in the last 16.\nGO DEEPER\nDear FIFA, please don't change the blockbuster World Cup group-stage format\nActing as though he had never seen such jeopardy and elation previously, Infantino was hooked and his own enjoyment made it a formality that FIFA would revert to four-team groups.\nWhat details are still yet to be arranged?\nWith 24 more games than were first proposed, the allocation per host nation will have to be revisited.\nSixty of the 80 games were going to be played in the US, with Canada and Mexico staging 10 each. Presuming FIFA will maintain the same split, the US would host 78 games (75 per cent) and Canada and Mexico’s tallies would increase to 13 (12.5 per cent apiece).\nAs the number of teams competing at the 2026 World Cup has not changed, the qualification process will remain the same.\nUEFA (Europe) will be the most represented confederation, with 16 guaranteed places. The rest of the planet will be involved in inter-confederation play-offs, which will see six teams compete for the final two places once all the automatic qualifiers are known.\nThose getting in directly will be split as follows:\n- Asian Football Confederation (AFC) — eight guaranteed places\n- Confederation of African Football (CAF) — nine guaranteed places\n- Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) — six guaranteed places (includes all three host nations)\n- South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) — six guaranteed places\n- Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) — one guaranteed place\n- Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) — 16 guaranteed places\nLast June, the 16 cities and stadiums that would host the finals were confirmed. Now more games have been introduced, it is likely those chosen venues will take on more responsibility, but new ones may have to be added.\nGO DEEPER\n2026 World Cup host city info: The venues, infrastructure and more\nIs the change likely to be popular?\nThough the radical overhaul to the World Cup format has been widely criticised, the change from three-team groups to four-team ones will be largely welcomed. Following such an exciting set of final group-stage fixtures in Qatar, it would have been impossible for FIFA to justify that initial idea.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, reverting to four-team groups increases the number of games, which, in a world where player burnout is a real concern, will not have gone down well with those prioritising player welfare.\nFIFPro — the organisation that represents professional players worldwide — has regularly expressed concerns at the unsustainable amount of football being played at the top level. Its post-World Cup survey released last week showed that players are experiencing increased mental and physical fatigue as a result of the increased workload in the last few seasons.\n“The discussions on the match calendar and competition design for the period from 2024 continue to give priority to commercial objectives over the basic health and safety of elite players,” said FIFPro general secretary Jonas Baer-Hoffmann.\n“Expanded competition formats announced by competition organisers for club and national teams underline the growing cannibalisation of the match calendar. Those same competition organisers also carry a responsibility as regulators of the game. Despite contrary assurances, we are extremely worried players will continue to be the last consideration in forthcoming decisions.”\n(Top photo: ANP via Getty Images)",
