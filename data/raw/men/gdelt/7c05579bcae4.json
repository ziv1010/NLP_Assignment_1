Vinicius stepped up and secured his brace from the penalty spot.\nSpeaking to the press post-match, Tuchel revealed his fury at Kim for costing Bayern.\n\"He was too 'greedy' twice,\" he said. \"He made the first move too early against Vinicius in the first goal and got caught by Toni Kroos' pass. He speculated and was too aggressive.\n\"In the second goal, unfortunately it was another mistake. We were five against two, we had the numbers. There was no need to defend that aggressively against Rodrygo.\n\"The moment Eric [Dier] was about to help, he [Kim] brought him [Rodrygo] down. Unfortunately with their quality, these mistakes get punished. But well, it happens. We have to move on.\"\nKim joined Bayern from Napoli last summer for a €58m fee, becoming the most expensive Asian player in football history. During his one season in Italy, Kim played a starring role as Napoli won their first Scudetto in 23 years, while he also picked up the Serie A Best Defender award.\nHowever, Kim has not been able to replicate such performances for Bayern and was only drafted into the starting lineup to face Madrid due to an injury to Matthijs de Ligt.\nBayern and Madrid will reconvene at the Santiago Bernabeu next Wednesday for the second leg.",
