  "body_text": "Gary Lineker‘s departure from Match of the Day has been one of the worst kept secrets in British television, but confirmation of the news today brings the curtain down on a 25-year era for the iconic Premier League highlights show.\nMatch of the Day is a television institution in the UK and, having averaged 2M viewers for BBC1 on Saturday nights this season, it remains an important part of the soccer schedule at time when highlights and goal clips are readily available online.\nLineker has been central to show’s continued relevance. That rare combination of accomplished former pro and world-class broadcaster, he has a loyal fanbase and the ability to generate headlines with an arch flick of his eyebrow or a knowing gag at the expense of his co-hosts.\nWatch on Deadline\nFor the most part, this has been good for the BBC and for Lineker, even if the relationship has been somewhat strained in recent years. The presenter’s outspoken views on the Conservative government and support for the Palestinian cause has clashed with his employer’s hyperfocus on impartiality.\nThe BBC’s annoucement about Lineker’s future included an intriguing line about how Match of Day “continually evolves for changing viewing habits,” with observes suggesting that the show could be reinvented for a younger audience.\nIt will be a tricky balancing act. The BBC won’t wish to alienate Match of the Day’s loyal viewers and will be aware that a similar reinvention of another iconic sports show, A Question of Sport, ended with the series being shelved. A youth version of Match of the Day, titled MOTDX, was also canceled last year.\nRoger Mosey, a former BBC Sport director, pointed out that there is a “high failure rate” in revamping shows like Match of the Day. “The show ain’t broke,” he added.\nDespite the risks, there will a generous field of presenters limbering up on the subs bench to replace Lineker. Here’s a look at his potential Match of the Day successors.\nMark Chapman\nChapman is viewed by many of his contemporaries as the natural successor to Lineker having presented Match of the Day 2 for more than a decade. Chapman is highly regarded the BBC, mixing his TV duties with BBC Radio 5 Live. He also hosts Global podcast The Sports Agents and Sky’s coverage of the Carabao Cup. He has the respect of BBC pundits, including Lineker’s close friend Alan Shearer, but is he the right man for the job if the corporation is considering a more radical revamp?\nAlex Scott\nAlex Scott is adored by BBC bosses and her television career has garnered her awards and critical aclaim after she retired from the women’s soccer game. She currently presents BBC staple Football Focus, but has been blamed for a decline in the show’s ratings as it has chased a more TikTok friendly crowd. Scott was also not deployed by the BBC during the summer Olympics, despite being a key part of the corporation’s lineup for the 2021 games in Tokyo.\nGabby Logan\nLogan has been a fixture on BBC Sport for nearly two decades, including recently anchoring coverage of the athletics at the Paris Olympics. She is a classy and polished presenter, who is highly regarded by her peers, but is sport agnostic rather than being synonymous with football like Lineker. Logan also has interests outside of the BBC, including The Sports Agents — which she co-hosts with Chapman — and Amazon Prime Video, where she presents UEFA Champions League games.\nAlan Shearer\nCould the Premier League’s greatest ever goalscorer follow Lineker in transfering from the pundit’s chair to the hosting hotseat? His record in television would suggest not. Shearer has alway appeared most comfortable providing analysis rather than presiding over coverage. He is also fiercely loyal to Lineker, with whom he co-hosts The Rest is Football podcast, as well as appearing on Match of the Day.\nMicah Richards\nRichards’ presenting career has gone stratospheric in recent years thanks to his winning character and enormous laugh. Like Shearer, the former Manchester City player appears more comfortable as a pundit, but his ambition and desire for TV work are clear. Again, his loyalties to Lineker could be a factor in any decision, given he is regular on Match of the Day and co-host of The Rest Is Football.\nDan Walker\nDan Walker was a sporting fixture on the BBC, as well as the co-host of BBC Breakfast, before leaving the corporation for Paramount’s 5 News in 2022. He has been praised for helping raise the profile of 5 News, but it is unclear whether he would welcome a return to the BBC — or if the broadcaster would be able to match his pay.\nKate Scott\nScott’s profile has grown thanks to viral moments hosting CBS Sports’ coverage of UEFA Champions League since 2020. She has a winning on-screen relationship with Micah Richards, Jamie Carragher, and Thierry Henry, which has endeared her to viewers. An outside bet.\nGary Neville\nGary Neville is considered to be one of the most insightful pundits in the sport. The former Manchester United star is synonymous with Sky Sports, but has admirers at the BBC having presented topical quiz show Have I Got News for You. His well-known political views (he is a Labour supporter) would likely count against him.\nKelly Cates\nAs the daughter of Kenny Dalglish, Sky Sports presenter Kelly Cates has football in her blood and is firmly established among some of the sport’s top presenters. She presents on Radio 5 Live, so has links to the BBC, and is respected by former professionals.",
