  "body_text": "Chelsea supporters began taunting Lamine Yamal with chants of ‘You’re just a s*** Estevao’ as they cruised to a convincing 3-0 victory over ten-man Barcelona in the Champions League.\nTuesday’s heavyweight group-stage contest had been billed by fans and pundits alike as a battle of the two wonderkids, with Estevao and Yamal, both aged 18, widely considered to be among the most exciting young talents on the planet.\nBut there was only one winner as Estevao once again underlined his credentials as a potential world beater in west London. There is no question the Blues have unearthed a true gem.\nEnzo Fernandez had a pair of goals disallowed in the first half before Chelsea managed to take the lead through a Jules Kounde own goal in the 27th minute.\nBut it was a piece of solo brilliance from Estevao ten minutes into the second half – following Ronald Araujo’s sending off for a second bookable offence – which left the visitors scratching their heads in disbelief.\nAfter picking up possession out wide from Reece James, Estevao danced past Pau Cubarsi on the edge of the box before firing the ball into the roof of the net with an unstoppable strike from a tight angle.\nThe Stamford Bridge faithful had already been singing Estevao’s name for much of the first half but the Brazilian’s goal – his fifth of the season in all competitions – took the cacophony of noise up another notch inside the stadium.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nWARNING STRONG LANGUAGE\nMetro at the Match: Chelsea 3-0 Barcelona\nMetro's Ben Fleming breaks down the action with the winners and losers from Stamford Bridge:\nNeto impresses in new role\nGiven the start as the central striker with Joao Pedro and Liam Delap benched, Pedro Neto was a livewire up in attack. A lack of composure let him down at points, but deploying him centrally could be a great option to provide Estevao with more minutes from the start.\nEstevao outshines Yamal\nOnly 18, but Estevao already looks like a man for the big occasion. A winner against Liverpool last month and now a sublime goal to virtually put this game to bed. The Brazilian easily won the battle of the teenage sensations.\nCucurella the cult hero\nA faultless display from Cucurella at left-back. Provided plenty of support to Garnacho in the final third, and kept his fellow countryman Lamine Yamal quiet for virtually the entire 90 minutes. Revered by the fans who sang his name all night long.\nFull Chelsea ratings: Sanchez 7, Gusto 6, Fofana 7, Chalobah 7, Cucurella 8.5, James 6, Caicedo 7, Estevao 9, Fernandez 6, Garnacho 6, Neto 7. Subs: Santos 7, Delap 6, Gittens N/A, Acheampong N/A, George N/A.\nYamal kept quiet\nLost his battle up against Cucurella and struggled to have any real impact on the game. Not helped by his side going down to ten men, but a visit to London to forget for the supremely talented teen, who made way to jeers from all four sides of Stamford Bridge.\nAwful Araujo\nThe rank opposite of a captain's display from Ronald Araujo. Picked up his first yellow for dissent and sent for an early bath before the half-time whistle for a clumsy challenge on Cucurella. Cost his team.\nFull Barcelona ratings: Joan García 5, Kounde 6, Cubarsi 5, Araujo 3, Balde 5; Eric García 5, De Jong 6, Fermin 6, Yamal 5, Lewandowski 5, Ferran Torres 5. Subs: Rashford 5, Raphinha 5, Christensen 5, Martin N/A, Olmo N/A.\nBefore long, loud chants of ‘You’re just a s*** Estevao’ could be heard in the stands, directed at teenage Barca forward Yamal, who was kept quiet for the most part by fellow countryman Marc Cucurella.\nJust seven minutes after Liam Delap came on and made it three for the hosts, Yamal was taken off the field to rapturous cheers from jubilant Chelsea fans.\n‘I don’t really have any words to sum up how I’m feeling right now,’ an elated Estevao told Amazon Prime shortly after the final whistle.\n‘It really was the perfect night and I’m just grateful to God for making everything happen for me. Onwards and upwards from here!’\nReflecting on his stunning 55th-minute effort, Estevao added: ‘It all happened so quickly!\n‘I just found some space, wiggled my way through and then scored that goal.\nMore Trending\n‘It’s such a special moment for me in my career and I hope to score many more.’\nThe Brazil international was delighted to be able to perform like he did in front of his family, who watched on from the stands in the capital.\n‘It was definitely the most special moment of my career and I hope to keep scoring more and more for many years,’ he continued.\n‘I’m so happy my family was here to see it as well.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Robert Sanchez mocks Lamine Yamal after Chelsea beat Barcelona\nMORE: Arsenal vs Bayern: Predicted lineup today and confirmed team news\nMORE: Craig Burley makes Arsenal claim after Chelsea’s Champions League win over Barcelona",
