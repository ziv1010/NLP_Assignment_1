We tried for a lot of guys. I enquired about the lad Connor Wickham, who was here. Dear oh dear, we couldn’t get anyone in.\n“The ones I did go for, to help the guys, incredible, we don’t have the money to go and do it.\n“Ideally would we have got people in to help? Aye, we would have but we couldn’t get anybody in that was in our bracket.”\nQuizzed further on the approach for Wickham, Lambert added: “I enquired about him, [general manager of football operations] Lee [O'Neill] spoke to the agent, but the money was… wow!\n“It wasn’t just him I looked at, there were a few guys a looked at but the level was incredibly high.\n“It’s not realistic, we just felt we need a little bit of help in certain areas to try and get us through it but it just never materialised.”\nHowever, he says he is confident that the strikers he has at the club are capable of scoring the goals required to climb back up the table and be in the running come May.\n“They’ve done it before, that’s why I know it’s in them,\" he said. \"We have to take chances when we’re on top.”\nWickham eventually joined Championship Sheffield Wednesday on loan on deadline day.\nPhoto: TWTD\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nWhy is it they we always seem to have a problem ? - it's either bull, or we expect something for literally NOTHING.\nJust do one Shambert.\nWhile Norwood's finishing has disappointed - I thought he would be the clinical striker we've been missing for years - I don't believe our main issue is up front. It's the lack of creativity & direct attacking from deeper out that is denying us the chances our suposedly superior players should be providing; and that is down to how we are playing, which falls to the manager.\nPossession, passes & other non-goalscoring stats are only impressive when they are accompanied by 3 points; we are seriously underperforming in the goal chance creating department, which then ties in to our strikers snatching at & misfiring the chances when they do come. We still have a squad of players well capable of promotion, if they play a sharper, more positive game.\nKeep shopping as we currently do with basement purchases and we could end up in Division 3\nNo wonder fees seemed high, did we enquire about Danny Rose too? We're we in the mix for Odin until Utd came calling?\nPathetic!\nTHE TROUBLE IS EVANS WILL NOT PAY ANYTHING FOR NEW ADDITIONS & FUND THE SQUAD FOR A PROMOTION PUSH.\nGet ready folks it is going to get much much worse... Lge 1 with gates well below 10000 ... boring mid table for another 5 years then Lge 2\nEVANS IS A CANCER TO THIS CLUB & SHOULD NEVER HAVE BOUGHT IT IF REFUSES TO FUND IT FOR WHAT IT IS. YOU DONT BUY A COFFEE SHOP AND STOP BUYING COFFEE BEANS.\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
