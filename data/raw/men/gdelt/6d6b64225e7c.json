Kroes had been due to leave the club at the end of the season.\n“Ajax is a unique club with a rich history,” he told the club’s official website. “I will do everything I can to add a new successful chapter.”\nThe arrival of Cruyff immediately fuelled speculation about contenders for a new permanent coach. Former goalkeeper Fred Grim agreed last week to stay on until the end of the season after taking over from John Heitinga in November.\nXavi “clear option”\nSpanish journalist Javier Miguel said on social media site X that former World Cup winner and ex-Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez was “clearly an option” following Cruyff’s appointment.\nCruyff was sporting director at Barcelona between 2021 and 2023, when Xavi was the team’s head coach.\nHeitinga was sacked after just five months in charge following a disastrous start to the season, including five straight defeats in the Champions League, the club’s worst run in Europe’s premier club competition.\nHis appointment followed the departure of Italian coach Francesco Farioli, who appeared to have steadied the ship in his first season at Amsterdam, but narrowly missed out on the league title after a late-season slump.\nFarioli moved to Portuguese club Porto, who have won 16 out of 17 league matches under his guidance and are on course to win their first league title since 2022.\nThank you for donating to DutchNews.nl.\nWe could not provide the Dutch News service, and keep it free of charge, without the generous support of our readers.
