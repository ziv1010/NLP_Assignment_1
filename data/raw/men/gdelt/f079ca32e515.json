  "body_text": "Time for my annual look at the Everton squad and what we might need in order to stay safe and hopefully more next season. I’m going to look at the whole squad by position and will assume that we will play primarily in the sort of 4-5-1 or 4-4-1-1 formation that we saw Dyche using for the majority of last season.\nGoalkeeper\nJordan Pickford\nJoao Virginia\nBilly Crellin\nHarry Tyrer\nWe look decently stocked here. Jordan Pickford (who I have been critical of in previous seasons) was excellent last season and carried that form into the Euros. He seems settled and happy here.\nVirginia looks a decent number 2 and was good when needed last season; he may want more minutes but will hopefully stay.\nCrellin and Tyrer are good young players and Tyrer had an excellent loan at Chesterfield last year.\nIncomings\nNo real need. We’ve lost Lonergan and might want to add a senior backup but Virginia is capable if he wants to stay.\nLeft-Back\nVitalii Mykolenko|\nAshley Young\nElijah Campbell\nMykolenko was a good performer last season and will hopefully be back to full fitness, but the depth here is shallow. Campbell played at left-back back I believe against Sligo Rovers but is more of a centre-back usually. Young is a decent backup but we wouldn’t want him playing too many games. Perhaps McNeil or Coleman could fill in at a pinch.\nIncomings\nSome depth here would be useful but probably not a priority. Finding a new defender who is versatile and could fill a few positions (like Godfrey did) would make sense.\nRight-Back\nNathan Patterson\nSeamus Coleman\nAshley Young\nMason Holgate\nThere is better depth here but a lack of quality. It will be interesting to see how much faith Sean Dyche puts int Patterson but he has not offered the defensive solidity that the manager craves so far, in fact, the best thing for him might be a loan to a Championship team where he’ll start every game.\nColeman and Young will always do their best but neither are ideal starters for long periods, so for me this is a priority area to improve in. Roman Dixon could be an option from the Under-21s but, as rapid as the youngster is, it would be a big step up.\nIncomings\nTete from Fulham would have seemed a good choice on a free but has signed an option agreement. Wan-Bissaka at £10-15M would seem a no-brainer.\nOther options I like of varying plausibility include Marvin Seneya, Tiago Santos, Marc Pubill, Commencia, Lorenz Assignon, Valentin Gendrey, Bafode Diakite, Angelo Preciado, Lutshurel Geertruida, Issa Kabore.\nNot sure I’ve seen any truly exciting options here so my pick is going to be Ferdi Kadioglu from Fenerbahce, who is a good all-round right-back who works hard and crucially is comfortable at left- or right-back, so would offer us flexibility.\nCentre-Back\nJames Tarkowski\nJarrad Branthwaite\nMichael Keane\nMason Holgate\nReece Welch\nTarkowski and Branthwaite have proved a very effective pair and the best news of the summer may yet be the likely stay of the latter. But again the depth is poor.\nKeane is a decent deputy but not many want to see Holgate given minutes and I’d imagine Thelwell will be looking for another loan for him if possible. Welch is a decent young talent but not ready for the Premier League; Tyler Onyango could also feature here but is likewise not at Premier League level yet.\nIncomings\nA tricky one here as no incoming centre-back is likely to displace the preferred two. It may be that we get someone like Nathan Chalobah from Chelsea or Becir Omeragic who are mobile and good enough on the ball to play as a defensive right back instead.\nOther options might be: Jorthy Mokio, Martin Vitik, Jayden Oosterwolde, Diego Coppola, Rav van den Berg, Jean Belocian, Ousmane Diomande, Jaka Bijol.\nMy top pick would be Jake O’Brien from Lyon. This guy is a monster at 6ft-6in but surprisingly agile and fast (he was able to keep up with Mbappe at times). He is good on the ball with a good right foot and decent left and crucially wins a lot of his duels, like Branthwaite. He would be a good replacement for Branthwaite when the time comes for him to move on… but could be a good first backup or defensive full-back until then.\nCentre-Midfield\nIdrissa Gana Gueye\nAbdoulaye Doucouré\nJames Garner\nTim Iroegbunam\nDele Alli\nAmadou Onana has gone for decent money without being a first pick for Sean Dyche, which leaves four senior midfielders (five if Dele Alli stays) for two spots, with Doucouré expected to play deeper this season.\nIroegbunam looks a talent and Garner proved dependable if not spectacular last season, so there is decent depth. My biggest issue is that none of these players is an obvious sitting defensive midfielder, they all like to roam around; but then having one of the strongest defences in the Premier League last season suggests this may not be too much of an issue.\nIf Gana can maintain his levels, he will be first pick alongside one of Garner or Doucouré or possibly Iroegbunam.\nIncomings\nA more disciplined defensive centre-midfielder might be useful but this does not look a priority right now despite some of the transfer links. If we did have to get someone, I'm surprised there's not been more buzz around Gabriel Sara, who was excellent for Norwich City last season.\nLeft-Wing and Right-Wing\nDwight McNeil\nJames Harrison\nIliman Ndiaye\nYoussef Chermiti\nMcNeil we know well now and has proved mostly dependable. Harrison is a hard worker who I expect to offer more end product this season after a good pre-season.\nNdiaye I’d prefer to see behind the striker and Chermiti is also better centrally which means we need at least one more option here. Pace is something we lack out wide, which is why I especially wanted us to get Minteh but there are still plenty of good wingers out there.\nIncomings\nSome options may be: Jonathan Rowe, Loum Tchaona, Amad Diallo, Mathis Labourde, Johan Bakayoko, Mathias Soule, Luca Koleosho, Geny Catamo, Dilane Bakwa, Yaser Asprilla.\nI know many are unconvinced but I still have a softspot for Wilfried Gnonto from Leeds. Perhaps it feels like unfinished business but I think he looks a very tricky customer when he’s in the mood and has that capacity to make something happen with a burst of speed and decent shooting off either foot. He managed 10 goals and 3 assists in under 2000 minutes last season, which is pretty decent for a 20-year-old who was in a grump and mostly not starting.\nI also like the idea of loaning Jesper Lindstrøm, who also has a good burst of speed and can play across the front. It would be good to have more options as last year we relied so heavily on McNeill and Harrison (still not sure why Danjuma played so little).\nAttacking-Midfield\nIliman Ndiaye\nAbdoulaye Doucouré\nNeal Maupay\nDele Alli\nYoussef Chermitti\nI’m hoping that this is where Ndiaye will play and I think he will be excellent there. He has sharp feet and good vision plus a strong work ethic, and should be exactly what Dyche needs in this spot.\nDoucoure had his moments there last season but tailed off somewhat and will probably be used in the No 8 position he prefers.\nMany have written off Neal Maupay who will probably be sold but he could be a wildcard here, he managed 8 goals and 4 assists (more than our forwards) in 1400 minutes last season, which is impressive; he can be a real nuisance in this spot rather than as a lone striker.\nAnd talking of wildcards will we see Alli feature?\nIncomings\nWe're pretty well covered here. Not a priority, with Harrison and McNeil also options potentially.\nCentre-Forward\nDominic Calvert-Lewin\nBeto\nYousseff Chermiti\nNeal Maupay\nIliman Ndiaye\nPerhaps the big question that remains is the future of Calvert-Lewin. He’s our best centre-forward but I’m not sure we can allow him to run his contract down and leave for free. If he won’t sign, then I think any offer over £20M will have to be seriously considered.\nMost people on here have very low opinions of Beto but his underlying statistics paint a slightly brighter picture and, if he were first choice, then I think he’d surprise some.\nI’m also excited to see Chermitti progress, who may well end up being the best of all three but would benefit from getting more minutes this season somewhere.\nIncomings\nIf Calvert-Lewin does leave I’d be happy enough with Beto and Chermitti but many would not so here are some options: Kelechi Iheanacho, Max Beier, Tammy Abraham, Tasos Douvikas, Jhon Dhuran, Armando Broja, Elijah Adebayo, Ben Brereton Diaz, Terem Moffi, Haji Wright.\nIf I had to pick one, I’d be curious for David Datro Fofana on loan but I’m not sure that he’s a significant upgrade on Beto or Chermiti. Ideally, I’d like Calvert-Lewin to sign a new contract and stay another year at least.\nTransfer Business\nOut:–\nAmadou Onana – £55M\nBen Godfrey – £12M\nLewis Dobbin – £11M\nNeal Maupay – £10M\nMason Holgate – on loan\nNathan Patterson – on loan\nTotal = £83M\nIn:–\nIliman Ndiaye – £17M\nTim Iroegbunam – £10M\nWilfried Gnonto – £20M\nFerdi Kadioglu – £18M\nJake O’Brien – £18M\nJesper Lindstrøm – on loan\nDominic Calvert-Lewin – new contract\nTotal = £83M\nI think it’s highly unlikely that we will spend as much as we sell but given how unclear the financial situation is why not have fun! This would leave us a first team and bench something like:\nPickford\nKadioglu Tarkowski Branthwaite Mykolenko\nGana Doucouré\nGnonto Ndiaye McNeil\nCalvert-Lewin\nSubs: Virginia, Young, O’Brien, Garner, Iroegbunam, Alli, Harrison, Lindstrøm, Chermiti, Beto.\nI think that looks a pretty balanced team and crucially it’s a really strong bench with lots of options available to influence and change the game. The likes of Ndiaye, Gnonto and Lindstrøm should mean more goals and better, quicker transitions whereas Kadioglu and O’Brien will help keep us solid at the back.\nI'm broadly speaking quite optimistic this season. The competition will be tougher as Leicester City, Southampton and Ipswich Town look stronger than Burnley, Luton Town and Sheffield United but we have a pragmatic manager who should make us hard to beat.\nOur finishing let us down so badly last season and, if we could be just a bit more clinical, then I'm hoping we might finish around 12th or 13th. In reality, given the lack of recent financial investment into the team, anything above the relegation zone would be the basic goal but I'm hopeful for more.\nReader Comments (167)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Might not be pretty but we'll get there. I agree, we are goal shy but hopefully goals will come from a variety of sources.\n2 Posted 23/07/2024 at 14:11:53\nThanks!\n3 Posted 23/07/2024 at 14:17:25\nDesperately thin squad and I still expect Branthwaite and Calvert-Lewin to be flogged for “undisclosed fees”.\nEverton have been circling that drain for years. Dyche will need to perform another miracle to keep us up again.\nNdiaye is a good signing.\n4 Posted 23/07/2024 at 14:19:20\nBut is that really a priority / advantage if the manager is not going to use them?\n5 Posted 23/07/2024 at 14:44:56\nEric, mad as this sounds — if the options from the bench are good players, then it is more likely they will be used.\n6 Posted 23/07/2024 at 15:00:56\nIt's always enjoyable to discuss players and the squad as opposed to takeover failures and your knowledge of the wider football world is much appreciated.\nI note two absentees from the players discussed that the media have consistently said we are pushing for, that is Tchatchou and Kalvin Phillips. Do you know something we don't or have you just discounted them?\nPhillips is an enigma for me. He may well turn out to be the steal of the season or just another short-term flop. Tchatchou I don't know a lot about but he seems highly rated.\nLike you, I feel Beto will have a much better season and, while he doesn't contribute as much as Calvert-Lewin in terms of holding play and leading the line, to me he is a better chance taker; with more support from the flanks and Ndiaye, I would expect him to be in double figures this season.\n7 Posted 23/07/2024 at 15:11:21\nAs you note, right-back is the obvious current weak spot. Dyche doesn't rate Patterson and Coleman shouldn't be playing more than 5-10 games imo. Wan-Bissaka would be a decent shout but I think he's already talking to West Ham. If we had a decent pacy right-back, we may also see a better attacking version of Harrison. I'm not a Harrison fan myself but he's here now.\nI also think Beto is much maligned and we'll see a better striker this season after he's had a year to adjust. He can be a real handful on his day. Calvert-Lewin I can see being sold as we're simply not in a position to let him run his contract down. I'd be happy giving Beto the mantle and reinvesting the cash into a really good right-back or pacy right-winger. Chermiti looks like he'll be good too.\nWe have a decent first XI, right-back aside, but painfully thin bench. We'll get injuries and suspensions so need a few more in. Coleman and Young playing just gives me the shivers. Both great servants but best years long gone. If either plays, it just puts the wing under more pressure defensively. It would be ideal to find a right-back who could also cover left-back or centre-back (neither Keane nor Holgate should be playing).\nAt least there's a few weeks until the window closes and we've already done some early business. I'm confident we'll stay up this season, without the drama of last year. I predict Southampton, Ipswich and Palace struggling and Leicester look like they'll be getting a points deduction.\nWe should have finished mid-table last season and I think we'll have a better squad this season. Whatever people's feelings about Dyche, he has brought some stability on the pitch.\nNow if we could just get the off-pitch shit-show sorted….\n8 Posted 23/07/2024 at 15:13:43\nLots of possibilities can still play out as the window counts down. I hope we give Dom the new contract (or should I say, I hope he accepts it) as I think he won't risk going into his last year with that injury record. I don't see us getting both Gnonto and Lindestrom, it will be one or the other and will rely on Ndiaye to occasionally play out wide.\nI would love O'Brien too but can't see that unless Jarrad is sold. If we loan LindstrÃ¸m, there may be some money left for a centre-mifdfielder, my choice would be O'Reilly from Celtic.\n9 Posted 23/07/2024 at 15:39:53\nAfter that, it's all a bit iffy…\n10 Posted 23/07/2024 at 15:40:35\nThere's an article appeared on the BBC from Beto you can read here 'I will make this guy shut his mouth' — Beto on 'haters' where he talks about being motivated by hate, and claims he will shut people's mouths.\nA bold claim, one you appear to agree with to some degree. Time will tell!\nAs an aside, and getting back to why we're all here — does anyone else think we're going to struggle again this season? I have a feeling we'll be bottom-half all season again and things are not going to be plain sailing.\nI don't rate our squad at all — we look just as goal-shy as ever.\n11 Posted 23/07/2024 at 15:54:16\nWe will be a wash with players who want to play on the left, and fall into the same trap of no one natural on the right. McNeil, Gnonto, Ndiaye, Harrison all play best on the left.\nCentre-midfield looks light in terms of players who can play No 6 or No 8 strongly. Ndiaye, LindstrÃ¸m, DoucourÃ©, Alli all play in the No 10 spot.\nDoucourÃ©, Gana, Garner and Iroegbunam look an uninspiring engine room that is going to give up possession and control. Two long-term injuries to Gana and DoucourÃ©, and we are in Shit Street.\nSending Patterson on loan would be madness when the cover is Coleman and Young. You could easily see Coleman go into a back 2 or 3 as emergency cover, and we'd be left playing a 40-year-old as right-wingback.\nUpfront is an issue. Beto doesn't convince and Calvert-Lewin has to be sold or given a free transfer at the end of the season. Signing quality is going to be a challenge when there aren't good strikers about.\nIn\nLeft-back: Lucas Digne on loan, Marcos Alonso free, Doughty from Luton. (Not sure if Alonso is fit after a back problem.)\nRight back: I'd be all in for Wan-Bissaka. He can play right-back, and I think he could cover centre-back with his pace and man-marking ability. If he's in, I'd sell Patterson.\nCentre-back: Trevor Chalobah on loan to buy would be sensible business. Chelsea didn't take him to the US, and Dyche could push him on to replace Tarkowski.\nRight-wing: I'd be on the phone to Villa for Philogene on loan. I am not convinced on Gnonto, and I think he'd be a better placeholder for now. Asprilla from Watford.\nCenre-midfield: Ugochukwu from Chelsea on loan, he needs game minutes; Tessman, Perrone from Man City. Not Philips, Melo, Rabiot or anyone else incapable of running. McTominay would provide size, goal threat and positional cover. Matt Oriley gets the goal contribution as well. Amir Richardson.\nStriker: Adebayo from Luton. I'd buy him all day long. I think for £15-17M he'd be a no-brainer. Fofana, Broja, a recovering Bilal Toure,\nOut:\nKeane\nHolgate\nMaupay\nBeto\nCalvert Lewin — no choice.\n12 Posted 23/07/2024 at 15:57:10\nThe new acquisitions and those pushing for a place from the bench etc may have a big influence on the shape of the squad at the outset of the season.\nI don't see much in the way of improvement from the existing players although a fully fit Calvert-Lewin would be a boost along with a better Beto and Chermiti.\nEverton don't have the class or the speed that is needed to be a force on offense so I suspect it will be more of the same tactics by Dyche.\nIt's easy to list players who some would like to see acquired but many are just Summer rumors who don't excite me.\n13 Posted 23/07/2024 at 15:58:19\nI'd understood that Bayern were in for him but now Man Utd are being linked. We might have been able to pick him up 3 years ago, or even a year ago, but that ship has sailed, he'll be looking for Champions League football.\nIt would be a real coup if we could sign him but I just don't see it.\n14 Posted 23/07/2024 at 16:06:20\nI get frustrated by the speculation, and remember fondly the days when players chose to come to Everton, even over our neighbours, as we were one of the big 5.\nNot going for Wan-Bissaka amazes me. But what do we know? Thelwell could have approached his agent and been turned down.\nI would also have taken a punt on bringing Ross Barkley back. He was outstanding last season in the No 6/No 8 role. (Tin hat at the ready…)\nWhatever happens, we know we have to bring in cover and maybe some first choices. If it means selling Calvert-Lewin, I would not be happy, but that's football.\nI just hope that we get all the business done by the time the season starts and that deadline day is all about the final few unwanted players getting moved on.\n15 Posted 23/07/2024 at 16:43:30\nI keep saying I believe we need quantity over quality but I would be very happy if we ended up with Sam's list, especially for a net spend of absolute zero, but I won't be holding my breath!\n16 Posted 23/07/2024 at 16:44:35\nI'm just not sure centre-midfield looks a priority currently. But if we were adding I'm not sure Phillips would be high up my list unless the terms were favourable. Tchatchou could be an interesting one but looks more a wing-back or winger than a full-back.\nIan@10,\nI will politely disagree with some of those assessments. DoucourÃ© is not a No 10 and is on record saying he prefers to play No 8.\nAlso, LindstrÃ¸m is not a No 10 and played majority of his best season at Frankfurt from the right. And the ‘madness' with Patterson would be keeping him if Dyche doesn't fancy him, we've spent decent money on him and he will only develop with game time not on the bench.\nDyche clearly trusted Young over him last year, let's see if that's changed. Also McTominay would be an uninspiring signing, a limited player IMO who is somewhat in vogue after his only ever decent goalscoring season last year, lots of better ways to spend £30M.\n17 Posted 23/07/2024 at 16:57:10\n18 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:02:41\n19 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:09:34\nNo to Wan-Bissaca due to the above criteria.\n20 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:14:44\nBeing in this position this early gives me a good feeling. I trust Thelwell has a backup plan for the backup plan that gets disrupted. The future is Blue!\n21 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:17:52\n22 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:31:38\nI have to be honest and say that I hope we get rid of Holgate, given his mega blunders over the years and sending off at Sheffield United; we could recruit a better replacement.\nI'm not a fan of Kalvin Phillips either, and I am interested to see who we buy or loan to replace Onana. A player of similar physique and height would perhaps continue our improvement.\nCalvert-Lewin has yet to play his cards, so maybe a replacement striker is on the way?\n23 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:39:04\nNo reason why we cannot finish top half, 9th or 10th I believe is very realistic. Expect West Ham to be mid-table. Lopetegui won't do as well there as Moyes has done over the years. I would also expect us to finish above the likes of Crystal Palace, Wolves and Bournemouth.\n24 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:43:59\nIn the past 3 or 4 years since Moshiri pulled the plug, our net spend stands at â‚¬128.30M — we are the absolute stand-out outliers in the Premier League in this respect. No-one else comes close. In the same period, Ipswich (with a net spend of —â‚¬78M) have invested â‚¬200M more than us in their playing squad.\nSad to be the voice of doom but I can't see anything to suggest we will even approach a net spend of nil, Tony. With the takeover dragging on and uncertain, I would expect us to spend much less than we bring in through sales this summer.\nThis rules out many of the sorts of deals mentioned in the response to the thread.\nBarry #8, well — yes… but look on the bright side. I think Ndiaye will be a popular player once he settles down.\nAnd Jack #17, I agree. What is it about wanting old players back? And why does anyone think they would be remotely interested in coming back?\n25 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:46:19\n26 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:47:12\nI found this a very enjoyable read and analysis of what we could need and what is out there, I assume the mentioned are within our price range?\nShould Calvert-Lewin move on, I have to say I was very impressed with Ben Brereton Diaz when he played for Sheffield Utd against us at the end of the season. His work ethic that day was constant and he never gave up trying to be a threat. At 25 and with his physical attributes, he could be a real bargain; he has height, quick feet, and is not lacking pace either.\n27 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:52:18\nBig expenditure should only be on players 24 or under except in exceptional circumstances. Wan-Bissaka is only 26 though and I think a cost of £10-15M for him represents decent value.\nKunal @22,\nI think Top 10 is not implausible but would be an impressive achievement given the quality of our squad compared to some of the teams above us. Transfermarkt is a crude tool but has our squad value at around 16th in the Premier League, which seems about right. Any finish above that could feasibly be considered overperformance.\n28 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:55:00\nMe?\n1. This time of the year, for decades, I am insanely hopeful. Never seen the point otherwise.\n2. Players? Now I'm 63| and not as in-tune as I was once, but I have a strange sense that, if the gaffer feels under less relegation pressure, he may get existing and new additions to play more attacking and faster. I do think he can do that.\nPrediction? 10th place and a cup quarter-final.\n29 Posted 23/07/2024 at 17:56:08\nMy reservations on DoucourÃ© is that I don't think his body will last playing an entire season in centre-midfield. He struggled after injuries and missed enough games in that advanced role; putting him in a more demanding role is asking for more weeks on the treatment table to me.\nThe switch to playing behind the striker suited him; I am surprised anyone sees him still capable of playing as a No 8 for more than a couple of games. His better days are done as his pace and stamina get less.\nOn Patterson, I did say I'd sell him if you could get Wan-Bissaka in. I am not sure loaning him out to the Championship is going to help achieve anything. We need the cash now and, if he has another season of injury and poor form, then he's going to be worthless and a year shorter on his contract. For me, it's play or sell only. Once he's gone out on loan, I see little prospect of him making a return success in an Everton XI.\nI don't disagree on McTominay on the fee if that's the asking price. It was his type of physicality and ability to play 2 or 3 positions that attracts. Many will be sniffy on him, but he'd be our best midfielder by a country mile.\nFrom what I've read on LindstrÃ¸m, he plays most of his games centrally. The stats I'd seen was 60% of his games were central attacking midfield. He looks a gangly sort of dribbler who could perhaps play a wide-right role. Doesn't look a world beater, but I think he could do us a good job in getting some goals.\n30 Posted 23/07/2024 at 18:03:07\n31 Posted 23/07/2024 at 18:21:10\nI work in Leeds and one of their fans' big moans about Gnonto is that he never gets to the byline. Always comes inside.\nI've always thought crosses that are pulled back are infinitely more dangerous than those swung in from 18 yards out. But I'm sure there are some xG type figures that show I'm completely wrong…\n32 Posted 23/07/2024 at 18:23:57\nI certainly think, with McNeil's quick feet and shooting ability, that he could score a lot more from that position.\nI have a feeling that Patterson will move on, despite great promise with overtures north of the border, he looked very venerable at right-back. I would love him to thrive because the lad has ability.\nI also think you will see a different Beto after his first difficult start in the Premier League. Chermiti looks as though he could be something really special given time.\n33 Posted 23/07/2024 at 18:34:44\nHe doesn't track back, regularly goes missing, but knocks in a few goals and suddenly he's a star midfielder.\nThere is a reason Man Utd fans want shot of him; it's because he really isn't very good.\n34 Posted 23/07/2024 at 18:37:38\nLike going back to the David Moyes era, when Mr Kenwright worked miracles to make sure his manager had at least £5 million to spend each summer, maybe Martin?\n35 Posted 23/07/2024 at 18:48:27\nI also doubt very much that we can afford Wan-Bissaka.\nIf you want players from Man Utd, the more likely candidates are three players all seeing out the last year of their contracts (albeit options to extend). Possible loans with option to buy:\n- Mejbri (poor loan at Seville, albeit very good prior loan at Birmingham).\n- Pellestri (after a decent loan at Granada)\n- Diallo (although suspect he'll be retained with the first team squad)\n36 Posted 23/07/2024 at 18:51:36\nIt's hard to know what Moshiri will do next, he told Man Utd to do one in regard of Branthwaite and it seems like he's not for reducing what he wants for the club. Hardly the actions of a cash-strapped owner…\nWe definitely need another left-back and we are also a bit thin at right-back.\nUnlike you, I don't fancy Phillips, going off his Man City antics; it seems like the money went to his head and the desire went out the window. I think if we signed him, it could go either way, he might have got his head together or maybe not.\nI like the look of Ndiaye and I fancy Chermiti to excel if he is given a chance. Also, Keane is better than how he is commonly viewed on here.\nObviously, a lot depends on what happens with Branthwaite and Calvert-Lewin but overall I am very happy with the manager and Thelwell seems to know what he's doing.\nI'm optimistic that we will stay up as things stand just now but we will have to wait and see what the squad is when the window is closed.\n37 Posted 23/07/2024 at 18:54:01\nI would like to see us recruit the 2 Italians, Givvus Allegbraker to provide defensive cover and Smakker Bacconetta to add firepower upfront.\n38 Posted 23/07/2024 at 19:06:15\nHe scored 10 goals last season, which is more than any other Everton player including Calvert-Lewin. 8 more than Garner, 7 more than McNeil, 7 more than Harrison etc.\nMan Utd fans might not rate him, but I am sure they're happier having him than our central midfield contingent...\n6f-4in, good in the air, can score, can get box to box, can pass, can tackle,\nknows the league, is out of our price range...\n39 Posted 23/07/2024 at 19:30:20\n40 Posted 23/07/2024 at 19:31:46\n\"Sometimes I like to read my comments when I played badly or missed chances. They will say ‘he is shit with missing chances.' But I like it because I say: ‘OK, I will make this guy shut his mouth.' I take it personal too. When I'm in training the next week or the next day, I remember it and I say ‘no, this guy is not going to say this about me any more' and I keep going.”\nRaymond #35, I agree with you right down the line.\nNeil #36, I believe Allegbraker is Swiss, not Italian. But I could be mistaken.\n41 Posted 23/07/2024 at 19:37:10\nOur most experienced back-up is Tyrer, who spent the last 2 seasons playing non-league football. Had success, but still.\nThat aside, Sam takes an upbeat view, which I think proper as the new season approaches. So, I'll go along with him.\n42 Posted 23/07/2024 at 19:39:03\n43 Posted 23/07/2024 at 19:40:58\nFerdi Kadioglu would be a brilliant signing.\n44 Posted 23/07/2024 at 19:43:49\nLet's take it into the coming season. I too think we'll be comfortable. Possibly more than.\n45 Posted 23/07/2024 at 19:51:39\n46 Posted 23/07/2024 at 19:53:34\nIf true, he will be an interesting addition. He reminds me a touch of Iwobi (sorry, Colin Glassar) in that he will play nominally on the wing (probably the right) but will drift inside frequently.\nHe has great pace and tricky feet though I'm curious to see if he has the work rate to appease Dyche. My worry is he may prove to be another Danjuma, a talented attacker who remains mostly on the bench.\n47 Posted 23/07/2024 at 20:14:07\nI agree with Sam, there is a question as to whether he will be considered somewhat of a luxury by Sean Dyche, with Harrison is preferred.\nMike Gaynes... I saw that post regarding Beto's comments — how many other teams have players so regularly coming out and talking about the negativity of their fan base affecting them? Calvert-Lewin last season, Beto just now. When are this loud minority of negative twats going to sit up and take note?\n48 Posted 23/07/2024 at 20:20:50\nIt's about time some youngsters stepped up and provided more depth in the squad.\n49 Posted 23/07/2024 at 20:27:27\nHopefully more settled in the UK and the Premier League.\nLet's face it, he's no more guilty of missing the target than a lot of our players were!!\nHe gives us a different option as he can be a bit of a brute and bully defenders.\n50 Posted 23/07/2024 at 20:35:37\nDon't get me wrong, I'll make my observations afterwards and that may be critical for a poor performance, but not at the individual.\nFor years, I stuck up for Hibbert and Osman as they seemed to be the whipping boys for some. I get frustration for an individual game, but next thing you know, he'll go and score.\nIf they're playing in blue, they get my support.\n51 Posted 23/07/2024 at 20:41:24\nGoalkeeper, central defence, and maybe even striker looks somewhere between good and acceptable. I'm not sure anywhere else is.\nThe centre of midfield is a huge concern to me. Doucoure isn't a midfielder, Dele Alli isn't even really a player, Tim Iroegbunam is an unknown.\nI like Garner but he's not yet shown he should be a regular in a Premier League midfield. At 23, he's the one developing into the position.\nThere are a lot of eggs in the Gana basket... he's the one proven player in there and he's turning 35 at the start of the season. How much do you expect out of him?\nThat's where I'd spend or loan.\n52 Posted 23/07/2024 at 21:04:42\nI'd personally like to see Kalvin Phillips on loan as I think our centre-midfield is a bit of a weakness. Getting him fit and back to his best would be a real bonus and he could really improve the side.\nFor the full-back role, I'd go Walker-Peters. Covers both right- and left-back and in the last year of his contract so shouldn't be too pricey. He would be first choice right-back and if Mykolenko gets injured, he's still pretty good on the left.\nSell anyone who's in their last year of their contract, including DoucourÃ©, as there's plenty of cover in his position now with Ndiaye and LindstrÃ¸m coming in.\n53 Posted 23/07/2024 at 21:06:34\nGarner managed 34 starts last season so clearly Dyche has lots of faith in him. I expect he will play a lot again this season, mostly alongside Gana who shows no signs currently of slowing down and ended the season strongly. Remains to be seen what Iroegbunam can provide and I think Doucoure can still offer something as a No 8.\nWouldn't be surprised to see another centre-midfielder come in but, if that doesn't happen, I'd hope we could at least match last season's levels there.\n54 Posted 23/07/2024 at 21:22:00\nIf we buy Gnonto, it will be the first time in a few seasons where we have some real choices with attacking options, with the wide players and No 10 role, or false No 9 role.\nIf we also give Dele his contract, I think DoucourÃ© will move back into a deeper regular midfield role, like he was used by Carlo.\n55 Posted 23/07/2024 at 22:25:27\nMind the sender did say he's only seen it on Twitter, so probably all bollox.\n56 Posted 23/07/2024 at 22:38:00\nWith LindstrÃ¸m, Ndiaye and quite possibly Dele, it's hard to see what Doucoure's role will be next season, so maybe there's some legs in the story he's off.\nHe's been a decent signing for us and has been an important player for Dyche, but I'd really like us to be a bit more fluid in the final third this season.\n57 Posted 23/07/2024 at 22:47:30\nGiven the signings made and to come, I think cashing in makes sense for all, if the interest is true.\n58 Posted 23/07/2024 at 22:55:24\n59 Posted 24/07/2024 at 06:09:22\nJust 2 goals in 37 Premier League games for that position is poor.\n60 Posted 24/07/2024 at 06:10:40\nI did see that on Twitter but it's from a source who usually spouts rubbish.\nI think this is a great signing, real pace and an eye for a goal. Still think we need:\nWinger (Gnonto)\nDecent right-back\nDefender\nMidfielder\nThen that will be a decent transfer window.\n61 Posted 24/07/2024 at 06:23:11\nOr in the last four seasons for that matter?\nThe answers are zero -- that's right, zero -- and two.\n\"...bite the Saudis hand off for £8M\" Denis??\nReally?\n62 Posted 24/07/2024 at 06:52:41\nHowever, no harm in critiquing his performances. To be kind, would be to say he was a headless chicken at times.\nThe truth was he was akin to playing Fifa on a PlayStation when you've always played on X-Box — watching him was like somebody kept getting confused with the buttons and pressing “O” instead of “Square”.\n63 Posted 24/07/2024 at 07:07:34\nAbraham I always rated (unsure what happened to him last season - maybe injured) and a cheap option who would simply “do a job” would be Diaz.\n64 Posted 24/07/2024 at 07:13:45\nI was being sarcastic.\n65 Posted 24/07/2024 at 07:16:33\nNot many, I would say…\n66 Posted 24/07/2024 at 07:25:52\nWhile I agree mostly with your 'shopping list' of players still required, I fail to see why you and everyone thinks we need a right-back with Seamus chipping in — I still think Patterson will be good once he gets a run of games. We have Ashley Young as cover too, and I was impressed with Roman Dixon in the Sligo friendly.\nHowever various reports, if true, have possible bids coming in for Mykolenko from Italian sides, and that is assuming his injury woes are behind him. We have very little cover for left-back should either happen. I think left-back is more priority than right-back.\nI also wish we knew what was happening with Calvert-Lewin (not renewing) so a cash in before he becomes free agent next season would be preferable, and Beto has more question marks, than good marks!\n67 Posted 24/07/2024 at 07:34:15\nThat one he scored in front of our eyes at Brighton after about 2 or 3 minutes when we had just taken our places, set us up for an emphatic victory.\nAnd then the sublime strike against Bournemouth that kept us up.\n68 Posted 24/07/2024 at 08:03:37\nHe is exactly what we need and, as others have stated, we are now well stocked with No 10s.\n69 Posted 24/07/2024 at 08:04:06\nI'd like to see Waita Varchek, the Polish No 10 paired with Smakker Bacconetta. He's a great player, very creative and good engine, but he does have a habit of straying offside.\n70 Posted 24/07/2024 at 08:13:20\nI totally agree about Beto:- No one compares to Calvert-Lewin in the air, but quite a few can compare in shot accuracy and shot power, so Beto could make up a deficit there over him.\n71 Posted 24/07/2024 at 08:19:44\nThose DoucourÃ© stats are incredible. He has obviously been a key part of keeping us afloat through a series of relegation battles. And he's one of the few signings from the awful 2016 to 2021 era that you could argue was worth the money.\nHowever, he is not a great player, let's be honest. When we had a more talented player in his position — like Sigurdsson — we didn't seem to be in relegation battles and we scored more goals.\nSo you could also read the stats as meaning we are over-reliant on a very limited player in DoucourÃ© — a player who pulls his weight but also limits the quality of football we play.\n72 Posted 24/07/2024 at 08:24:45\nLindstrÃ¸m, who I have never seen play, is not a Dyche player apparently, because it's said he doesn't work hard enough. Can anyone seriously imagine Klopp or Guardiola, picking a player who doesn't work hard enough?\nI hope we sign him because suddenly we might have a few players who genuinely like having the ball at their feet and this might even move us away from playing Dycheball.\nIs Dycheball a tactic that the great Italian master, Ancelotti, used for most of his time at Everton, with better players, Or am I missing something?\n73 Posted 24/07/2024 at 09:03:46\nDoucourÃ© has been a great servant but every player leaves at some point. He's in his 30s; in the last year of his contract, and is our highest earner. With the players being brought in, I think we'll be fine without him.\nI'm agnostic whether he stays or goes but, given our finances, if someone offered £18M, we'd be mad not to accept.\n74 Posted 24/07/2024 at 10:02:10\nWe need a left-back and a right-back. If we get LindstrÃ¸m and Gnonto, then what is the point of Harrison? Can he play centre-midfield as cover for Gaye or Garner ?\nSadly our midfield has received the bulk of the spending to the detriment of other positions. It is still not right but I would be loathe to fire in more money when we are inadequate up front and as described in defence.\nStrengthening is required in at least 8 positions. Let's see what the Onana funds bring — or are they already spent???\n75 Posted 24/07/2024 at 10:22:42\nSpeaking of which, I see Phillips had another stormer for Man City against Celtic last night, a snip at £20M!! What's wrong with our recruitment team?\nAs for Doucoure, he's coming to the end of his contract and we will miss his contribution when he goes. Not the world's best footballer but can be very effective for us when he is on blob and will need to be replaced.\nOne of my main concerns is our right side from fullback to winger or wingback. We definitely need reinforcements here, as we are looking very unbalanced and vulnerable at the moment.\nIt forces Dyche to play players out of position (usually Harrison) and that means we don't really see the best of the lad.\nWe desperately need a right-back and, although I've been banging on about Wan-Bissaka, I think his wage demands would be too much for Everton, but we definitely need cover in this position.\nThen of course it will be just a matter of a cover centre-back, a creative midfielder, a goal scorer and a right winger with pace who can put balls in the box!! Simple!!\n76 Posted 24/07/2024 at 10:39:24\nAt the moment, Transfermarkt independently rates us as as having the 16th best squad in the division. We would need to spend £100M (+) net to materially change that - and £300M (+) net to have a squad comparable to the lowest reaches of the Rich 8 (usual suspects + Villa and Newcastle).\nSince we'll get absolutely nowhere near that level of spending, realistically nothing of note can be achieved next season (apart from the very slim possibility of a cup win).\nWhat we need to do this summer is build the foundations for a much better squad in future seasons. I expect a few more signings to be made, to help steady the ship (like the links to players like Phillips), and with an eye to the future (eg, like Chermiti last summer).\n77 Posted 24/07/2024 at 10:42:24\nI absolutely agree with you but I am not sure Dyche is convinced of Patterson. Seamus and Young will get found out so that's the only reason I think we have to get a decent right-back.\nI forgot about Dixon, so maybe he will be used more.\n78 Posted 24/07/2024 at 11:00:20\nWhat a club!\n79 Posted 24/07/2024 at 11:18:39\nWith a run of games, I am convinced he will be out right-back for years.\n80 Posted 24/07/2024 at 11:35:07\n81 Posted 24/07/2024 at 12:17:27\nOddly enough, I think that, without a Gestapo Premier League points deduction hit squad on our backs, the squad may — and I reinforce the word \"may\" — get close to the lowest European place available.\nI am under no illusion of the hefty task Dyche is under still. I think a cup is beyond us. The corrupt-u-likes have ensured that they own those rights.\nCOYB\n82 Posted 24/07/2024 at 12:31:17\nIf we have LindstrÃ¸m, Ndiaye and possibly Gnonto, what would our formation be?\nNone of them would be brought in to sit on the bench.\n83 Posted 24/07/2024 at 12:56:25\nMost teams would have 2 specialists for each position so potentially McNeil, LindstrÃ¸m, Harrison and Gnonto might be vying for the 2 wing spots.\nIf that were the case, I'd say it was the best collection of wide players we'd had in a while. But perhaps after LindstrÃ¸m signs, Thelwell might leave Gnonto and decide funds are better spent elsewhere.\n84 Posted 24/07/2024 at 13:12:53\nI think, or believe the reasoning will be, that if all fit, and 5 subs being allowed nowadays, they (management) will see what the situation is at the halfway point, and then, if not working, make significant changes in wide players.\nNdiaye doesn't class himself as a winger, as I don't class Harrison as one, plenty of graft with little end product, Ndiaye sees himself more as an attacking midfielder.\n85 Posted 24/07/2024 at 13:13:25\nIn terms of formation, I expect we will generally stick with the 4-4-1-1 (ish) formation that we settled upon last season. However, versatile players like LindstrÃ¸m and Ndiaye mean that we will be able to switch into 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 more effectively.\n86 Posted 24/07/2024 at 13:14:46\nHowever, I am not sure either of our back-up central defenders will!\n87 Posted 24/07/2024 at 13:26:57\nDyche is likely to start all the usual players in a 4-5-1, and then only start new players in time. We all saw Keane have to have poor games before Branthwaite was given his chance. That's how Dyche does it.\nFrom what we have, you could go 4-3-2-1 with McNeil playing as a 3 with Doucoure, Gana or Garner. Harrison, Ndiaye or LindstrÃ¸m ahead.\nLikely to be Beto ahead, Bologna have signed a replacement to Zirkzee. Calvert-Lewin going. Milik being linked, I think he will want better than us.\n88 Posted 24/07/2024 at 14:09:00\nPickford — if he got injured, then I think Virginia is now a decent replacement.\nPatterson — Watched the Seamus documentary. Making of him was going out on loan and, when he came back, could not decide: winger or right-back? I can see history repeating itself.\nGnonto — Goes missing was one of the quotes. Not a Dyche player. Might get us out of our seats, might get us into the Championship\nGana — seems to be crucial. 31 points in the 24 games he started. Only lost to a non-Top 8 side 3 times when he played.\nGarner — played right-back for England U21s.\nCompetition for Bottom 3:\nLeicester — with points deduction\nIpswich — how many were playing League One in 2022-23?\nSouthampton — Won the playoff and are they materially better than 2022-23?\nForest — finished on 36 before points deduction (we were 48).\nBrentford — dropped 20 points compared to 2022-23 season. Slide to continue and Toney to leave?\nBrighton — Manager gone, and also only had 48 points last season.\nUs — because we are Everton.\nThat makes 3 from 7 in my book.\n89 Posted 24/07/2024 at 14:13:39\nDerek, given we signed Ndiaye early, I think he'll go straight into the first team. He'll be too good to start on the bench imo.\nMy only wish now is to sign a decent right-back and sort out the Calvert-Lewin position asap and not have it linger to the end of August. If he's not signing a contract, then Beto should be given the nod.\nStating the obvious but would be great to start the season with 3 points at home to Brighton and Beto getting off the mark. The first couple of away games are tricky.\n90 Posted 24/07/2024 at 14:36:22\nGnonto is a (semi-proven) pocket-rocket, relatively low-price investment with bags of potential, who can play anywhere across the front line. If Calvert-Lewin goes, I could see LindstrÃ¸m, Gnonto and Ndiaye being a very flexible, interchangeable front three.\nIt would also mean the end of Dycheball.\n91 Posted 24/07/2024 at 16:28:24\nI hope and believe that Dyche is looking to build a quality flexible side where subs with fresh legs are the same quality as those they are replacing.\nAlso good to see us finally looking at players who can score goals. One of my bugbears for years that, since Fellaini, we haven't brought a decent goalscorer in the supporting positions.\nRemember the days when Coleman, Baines, Fellaini, Barkley, Richarlison, Deulofeu etc used to contribute and we replaced them with Harrison, Garner, Gana and Onana to name but a few.\nI really hope we get Gnonto and a quality right-back.\n92 Posted 24/07/2024 at 16:40:46\nRobert/Tony/Denis, in my opinion Doucoure is irreplaceable at this point because he is the steel in our spine, the raw will of the club -- him and Tarks. Neither his phenomenal work rate nor his weak ball skills mean anywhere near as much as the drive and commitment he injects into the players around him. This kind of influence is something you usually see only in top-quality players, which Doucoure is not. He's amazing.\nAnd until we find somebody else who can deliver this undefinable quality, and until we show we can win and stay up without him, I say we need to hold onto DoucourÃ© at all costs.\nJay, I noticed that too. Dwight has been our best attacking player for two seasons now, and suddenly he's The Forgotten Man? I doubt it. Dyche knows his quality.\nPeter, we always have been, and like you I am very glad to see it finally addressed. Pace is our biggest need still.\nIan, thanks for posting that link, very good article. Jibes with what I saw of him a couple of years ago in a game against Dortmund. He didn't score but he had some superb dribbles.\n93 Posted 24/07/2024 at 18:00:09\nI believe he was on loan from Juventus but this guy would be a steal at £25M in my opinion. I just don't see how Everton could be in the mix for him but you never know, Juventus may need the cash. I'd love to see him in Everton blue.\n94 Posted 24/07/2024 at 18:13:58\nLike you I watched a great deal of Serie A and, also like you, I was really impressed by Soule. This article indicates he is off to Roma though.\n95 Posted 24/07/2024 at 18:25:52\nAny team which features DoucourÃ© automatically surrenders the lion's share of possession. The more he is involved, the less possession we have. He is almost guaranteed to surrender the ball.\nPeople bang on about pace and power and ability to make a pass, but the basic requirement for playing good football is the ability to take a pass. if we had a few more players who could instantly bring a ball under their spell, our play would quicken up in an instant and we would win more games.\nI can appreciate the efforts and even heroics of the likes of the likes of Tarkowski and DoucourÃ©, but they have spent nearly all their careers fighting relegation. There's a good reason for that.\nCalvert-Lewin gets murdered on here, McNeil also gets his share of stick, but along with Branthwaite and possibly Garner, they are the only natural footballers in the team. The rest of the team end up in a worse position after they have controlled a pass than they were when it was played to them.\nWe all bemoan the fact that our football has been ugly for years. Yet we make heroes and favourites out of last-ditch stoppers. gallopers, and people who simply can't play.\n96 Posted 24/07/2024 at 18:28:40\nKuhn 2 goals and an assist, O'Riley picking him out with some great passing.\n97 Posted 24/07/2024 at 18:55:57\nThe same DoucourÃ© that saved us with his goal contribution while Calvert-Lewin fluffed chance after chance.\nHe may not be the most technically gifted or a good paaser… but you can't fault his effort and work rate — and every team needs at least one player like that.\nBTW, can anyone explain why we are still being linked with loans for Phillips and Broja? I thought the loan limit was two unless they are under 21?\n98 Posted 24/07/2024 at 18:57:48\nI think you can have a certain amount from abroad and at home.\n99 Posted 24/07/2024 at 19:28:11\nWe've used one domestic and one overseas now.\n100 Posted 24/07/2024 at 19:38:17\nI'm prepared to acknowledge DoucourÃ©'s heroics. In fact, I did… but footballer? He's never been one.\nYou're perfectly at liberty to champion him. That's your prerogative. I believe that, if we continue to play players who have only ever battled relegation playing for ugly teams, then we will remain ugly and we will continue to make beating the drop our prime objective.\nSomewhere down the line, this club has to rid itself of people who cannot control a football. Personally, I would start right now and, if I could get a half-decent fee for DoucourÃ©, I would start with him.\n101 Posted 24/07/2024 at 19:41:32\nI only asked because you have him on the outgoings:-\nNeal Maupay — £10M\nAh well. Hopes dashed.\nWe sure need two players vying for places in each position. I hope we do get the guys as you have stated. I read that Ndiaye was a winger not a centre-forward although he has been labelled as one. We may end up with three.\nMykolenko is a big concern with his injury issues. I want to see right and left defence reinforced.\nI can't see goalscorers coming in. We seem to have a chronic allergy against signing them.\nWe have been weak on loan signings. Harrison again (I'm not a fan but he is a blue so gets my full support). LindstrÃ¸m would be a loan. Mixed reviews about him.\nThing is, Dyche has favourites. He has a set eleven that will always start. If your face doesn't fit, you are a bench warmer or stand-in. It is rare he varies from that premise.\nHopefully we will be in a position this season to fill all loan slots available so we have a more resilient squad. I hate seeing a bench containing 50-75% of youth players who have no chance of getting on under any circumstances. And 2 reserve goalkeepers… argh!!\n102 Posted 24/07/2024 at 19:45:37\n\"BTW can anyone explain why we are still being linked with loans for Phillips and Broja? I thought the loan limit was two unless they are under 21?\"\nForget the loan limit, surely the question is why we are linked with two overpaid players who are both crap?\n103 Posted 24/07/2024 at 19:49:26\n2 from home; 2 from abroad.\n104 Posted 24/07/2024 at 20:39:51\nFitness is not a problem.\n105 Posted 24/07/2024 at 20:54:39\nI've said a few times he looked like he had his boots on the wrong feet.\nThe frustrations with him are similar to Iwobi, you just never know what you're going to get.\n106 Posted 24/07/2024 at 21:09:18\nWith the attacking players we have now, I think he will fill the void left by Onana and will be a clear upgrade on him.\n107 Posted 24/07/2024 at 21:18:48\nDoucourÃ© was one of the better ones.\n108 Posted 24/07/2024 at 21:30:46\nWe'd turn over possession too quickly and get slaughtered if he played there.\n109 Posted 24/07/2024 at 21:45:57\nIf there's any truth in the rumours about Doucoure to Saudi, for £18M, I'd definitely take it, couldn't fault his effort and a few very important goals, but a player with a poor first touch, and in his final year on £130k, he's doesn't deserve to be the highest earner.\nGive it to Calvert-Lewin with a new contract; our No 9 would be a bigger loss.\n110 Posted 24/07/2024 at 21:51:46\nI believe that anyone who plays for a living, in what I still refer to as the Fourth Division, can certainly play, and I wonder who you played for?\nHi Danny,\nI agree that some players can be frustrating but, as I have said to Dave Cashen, they are good enough to earn a living. I'm looking forward to seeing you again at the Harlech Castle or Bramley Moore.\n111 Posted 24/07/2024 at 22:24:35\nDoucourÃ© is a fine footballer and should be a mainstay in our team.\n112 Posted 24/07/2024 at 22:25:02\nI probably should have used the word unpredictable to describe Doucoure.\nYes, it will be good to meet up with you and everyone again. Always a pleasure to be amongst friends and have healthy debate!!\n113 Posted 24/07/2024 at 22:42:32\nBrereton Diaz from Sheffield Utd and a couple of the Luton players caught the eye last season (Mengi & Adebayo).\nAnd apparently Origi is playing with Milan youth team…. Just saying.\nThere are bargains to be had, surely!\n114 Posted 24/07/2024 at 00:31:11\nI couldn't disagree with you more. I have seen hundreds maybe even thousands of what I would consider \"athletes\" earn a living playing football.\nI have seen similar numbers of what I call \"footballers\" who were not athletic enough to earn a living playing the game.\nIn a former Iife, I played with and against many people. Not one of them got even close to DoucourÃ© in terms of pace, power, or athleticism, but I saw quite a few that could do things with a ball that he couldn't. They didn't make it.\nTo answer your question; I played for nobody of note, I had to stop playing at a very young age for reasons I won't go into, but truth be told, I never in my wildest dreams would I have been athletic enough to have earned a decent living playing the game.\nI didn't abuse DoucourÃ©. I hate hearing our players getting abuse. I gave an honest opinion of what I see as his skills and deficiencies.\nIf you have to have been a professional to criticise a Premier League player on this website, I guess we would all be logging on to see Tony Abrahams arguing the toss with himself.\n115 Posted 25/07/2024 at 00:46:26\nSorry my post was meant to be a reply to you too.\nFor me, players like DoucourÃ© are the reason so many games turn out to be stale wars of attrition.\nThey are usually good enough to stop the opposition playing, but rarely good enough to break them down.\n116 Posted 25/07/2024 at 01:14:44\nBut steel like his is something no team can win without. And in this club, right now, only he and Tarkowski have that necessary element.\nWe cannot sell him without finding someone else of similarly contagious drive.\n117 Posted 25/07/2024 at 02:14:05\nHe is not fabulously skilled but he is fabulously committed in attitude and application, in contrast to more than a few of their many other useless and ruinously expensive signings.\nSo, the lad epitomises what some deride as \"Dycheball\", ie, the very survival of the club in stark contrast to the utter ineptitude of those 100% responsible for the mundanity on the pitch that we've through gritted teeth had to endure for decades.\nIf we want to survive next season, and the next, and the one after that minimum, we're going to have to be dependent on Doucoure-like qualities throughout the squad, thereby establishing a reputation as a potentially good enough club to be attractive to better quality young footballers who deliver what Doucoure delivers, but with bells on.\nThe lad has earned our support.\nAs have Dyche and Thelwell as they have to continue trying to shove water uphill, through no fault of their own.\n118 Posted 25/07/2024 at 04:16:21\nLike you, I have deep respect for John, but his constant reply to anyone on here who dares to criticise one of our players — “ I wonder who you played for?” — drives me nuts.\nIt is neither helpful or constructive and gets us nowhere other than the adage that to criticise a lad on the pitch you must have had to play for someone somewhere, presumably at the same level as the player you are expressing an opinion about.\nJohn often seems to conflate criticism with abuse. They are very different. Every fan has the right to constructively and reasonably criticise anyone who plays for the team they love. John is, of course, absolutely entitled not to criticise our players as he constantly reminds us he does not do. But I wish that he would stop asking someone who they played for if they question one of our players.\nJohn's position would close down most footy fan forums. How many ex-players flock to fan sites after they hang up their boots for the last time?\nWe are lucky to have one on here — Tony Abrahams (we do have someone with the same name as an ex-shite fella, but for the life of me I can't remember it) — who is someone I always look forward to reading. Actually, Dave, I quite like the idea that if John got his way ToffeeWeb would become Tony talking to Tony. That would certainly raise the quality of threads!\n119 Posted 25/07/2024 at 05:25:28\n“He is fabulously committed in attitude and application.”\nYes, and that is why I love him. DoucourÃ© has never stopped playing his heart out for our club — especially when we looked done for. As well as that, every time I see that great big smile on his face, it makes me feel happy.\n120 Posted 25/07/2024 at 05:51:23\nHe's our most expensive player in terms of salary and only has 1 year left on his contract so we either have to secure him for longer or try to get what we can for him now.\nThere's been no talk either way coming from the club or even clickbait media speculation. Unless he has an extension option in his contract?\n121 Posted 25/07/2024 at 05:56:40\nI don't think playing is a qualification to opine on football or Everton. Many watch religiously every week, be that at the match or online.\nI did actually play to a decent standard.\n122 Posted 25/07/2024 at 06:11:36\nDoucourÃ© drops into midfield when the opposition attacks, has the energy to support the transition when we counter, he presses defences with intensity, he can get up to support Calvert-Lewin when we aim long balls his way. He can also score goals with foot or head.\nBut, his ability to control the ball and pass the ball is dreadful. So many counter-attacks break down when he misplaces a pass. So it depends how ambitious Sean Dyche plans to be in setting up his team next season.\nNdiaye should play in DoucourÃ©'s role next season to better link play formations, but we will lose the intensity of the press and the energy to drop into the midfield when we need to defend. Unfortunately, I think Ndiaye will be pushed out to a wide position as cover for McNeil or Harrison.\n123 Posted 25/07/2024 at 06:23:10\nI was about to say I played to a decent standard. Semi-professional and had my moment at Bellefield but didn't make it. I played Army standard and, for those who know, that is semi-pro standard.\nI coached at youth level at a club that, at the time, was then Conference or Conference south level. So what? Not the big I am. And it doesn't make me anymore qualified than those on here, at the match or watching on the screen to comment on football and Everton.\nOne thing the coaching did, having my FA Level 2, is that I'm often looking where the ball is going next. It's probably why I often need telling who has scored!!\nKeep debating. We can't always agree all of the time. There is nothing wrong with that.\n124 Posted 25/07/2024 at 06:57:25\nYou pick James Garner as possibly one of our 'most natural footballers'. Yet, in his 53 Premier League matches, James has managed just 1 goal and 3 assists.\nGarner's general passing stats are only on a par with DoucourÃ© but his progressive passing completion is much worse. Also, for me, Garner is a less dynamic footballer than DoucourÃ©, who makes far more game changing interventions.\nAs James Garner turns 24 next season, it is his contribution to our Premier League status l would worry about, not DoucourÃ©'s.\n125 Posted 25/07/2024 at 07:18:06\n126 Posted 25/07/2024 at 07:23:01\nOn one hand, I don't believe he is as unskilled as some people make out; he ranks fairly well across the league in pass completion stats and forward passes and progressive carries. He loses the ball less than the likes of Harrison and McNeil.\nI agree with Denver@83 that he has a different skillset than Onana and will be less secure in possession or able to distribute it long; but I don't think he's nearly as poor on the ball as some are making out.\nOn the other hand, I don't believe what he does for the team should be so hard to replace. He certainly puts in the yards, and that is a fundamental part of a hard-working Dyche team, but there are lots of athletic players out there who should be able to replicate that, whilst perhaps showing a slight upturn in composure and vision.\nI don't think replacing Doucoure is a priority this summer (wingers and right-back are key) but perhaps next year will be the time to focus on upgrades in the middle.\n127 Posted 25/07/2024 at 08:07:02\nDon't get me wrong: he's not a technical genius with the ball but he falls into the Steven Naismith, Tim Cahill category of being able to get into goal-scoring positions, and I like that kind of midfield player.\nJames Garner is predominantly a decent Number 6, he's not shown me any signs that he will be a progressive creative midfielder in his two seasons here so far but a Number 6 that keeps things ticking over, yes.\nI heard some people at times compare him to our present day Mikel Arteta, silly comparison to make, completely different kind of footballer and nowhere near the same skill set as Arteta.\nWhat we need right now is Ndiaye to provide good competition to DoucourÃ© in that position and hopefully replace him, it will mean he's actually performing to a good standard.\nWe also have LindstrÃ¸m coming in who I believe can play in that role too and might even surpass the other two mentioned.\nAt the end of the day, we need goals, we didn't score enough last season.\n128 Posted 25/07/2024 at 09:35:01\nI played quite a few games with Steve Stone, who was my central midfield partner, but I think Stoney ended up making a very good career for himself out wide, and even got a few England caps because of his very honest endeavor.\nI'm not degrading Stone because he was a very good player but sometimes I look at DoucourÃ© and wonder why our first team coach has never suggested to the manager why he hasn't tried him out wide? He has got exactly that same endurance.\nSimilar with Ian Woan, who I unfortunately never had the pleasure to play with, who made a career out wide — without having any real pace, I think? — and was probably a player who would have been more effective inside because of this? Has he ever suggested to Dyche about trying Dwight McNeil inside?\n129 Posted 25/07/2024 at 10:04:29\nIn our generation, we had a wide player who wasn't necessarily blessed with pace, but he became arguably our best player. He was also effective in what we now call the Number 10 role. And he could take the odd free kick!!!\nI agree with Dave. If this lad signs, let's judge himwith our own eyes when he's wearing an Everton shirt.\n130 Posted 25/07/2024 at 10:11:09\nYour third paragraph describes Doucoure very well, he has good and bad points but he definitely exasperates the crowd with his lack of control, poor passing and the many stupid fouls he gives away, getting booked needlessly.\nHe does a job, an honest player, but I don't think I would miss him too much.\n131 Posted 25/07/2024 at 10:32:56\nWe lack a lot of quality and pace in most areas of the pitch which is made up for with effort. Effort that Dyche and the coaches have instilled in the squad.\nWe need a right-back, we need goals from any position as we haven't got enough of them in this squad.\nIf Calvert-Lewin isn't signing a new contract, we need to sell him and replace asap.\nLast season, we created a load of half opportunities and took very few. The addition of a new right-midfielder will give us balance.\nI would like a replacement for Onana as our defensive record was very good due to having a shield in front of the back 4.\nThe more I think about it, the more I am concerned about how we would cope with injuries.\n132 Posted 25/07/2024 at 11:48:14\nWho is now going to stand in the middle of the pitch waving his arms and trying to enthuse the crowd to Make Some Noise?\n133 Posted 25/07/2024 at 13:54:33\nI can't find the post from Dave Cashen, prompting my reaction. I can't quote it word by word, but I can tell the difference between abuse and criticism.\nRegarding the \"I wonder who you played for\", was the first time I have used that phrase, and on reflection, it was wrong to do so. The phrase I have often used is, \"I don't pick on individuals, we win or lose as a team\".\n134 Posted 25/07/2024 at 14:28:48\nFair enough Rob, yes I admire the passion and endeavour of Doucoure — not to mention the priceless goals he has contributed over the last couple of seasons — so pointing out his faults resulted in my final paragraph.@130.\n135 Posted 25/07/2024 at 14:41:27\n136 Posted 25/07/2024 at 14:52:49\nThat's why it's often better when we meet up. At least then we will still argue and debate, but it's face-to-face and often the biggest debate is who is getting the next round in!!\nKeep posting John. Keep posting everyone. For goodness sake, I spout some shite at times!! And I don't mind being called out. You want to hear conversations between me, my brothers and nephew. You would think we supported different clubs. We're all lifelong Evertonians!!!\n137 Posted 25/07/2024 at 15:00:43\nI responded to your first post because you addressed it to me. I tried to do so with respect for your seniority.\nI too know the difference between abuse and criticism and nowhere have I abused a player on this thread — or any other.\nDoucoure was not picked on; he was already part of the conversation. Some posters were suggesting he is irreplaceable right now.\nWhilst I understand that train of thought, I don't agree with it and I said why. I also said the lack of technical ability (at the highest level) ran throughout the squad. I mentioned four players I thought had the required technical skill to make the team more dynamic and easier on the eye, but I think we need more, or we`ll just keep getting the same performances.\nIt's a football website and if you (especially with your vast experience) and anybody else don't agree with my opinion, you are perfectly at liberty to say so.\nFor the record: there is not a single member of our squad that I don't feel grateful to. In the face of desperate uncertainty, they stood firm, gave 100% and, as a result, EFC is still standing.\n138 Posted 25/07/2024 at 15:14:19\nWhen he gets the ball, players are typically out of position making runs. Often, those runs are tracked tightly enough to make vision difficult. Additionally, DoucourÃ© is at his best on the run with enough space to turn. In tight spaces, he needs a give-and-go that isn't available.\nAs an advanced No 8, he could become more effective. With more confidence and a more regular pattern of getting out of our half, he could be a monster of a midfielder for the opposition defence.\nHe has paid his dues as a shoehorned player in an unwanted role. We survived thanks to his heroics. Let's give him another look with some quality possession players around him.\nI believe he will shake off the stray passes and thrill in a more supportive role. And 'contagious drive' was the phrase of this thread, well played, Mike.\n139 Posted 25/07/2024 at 15:52:22\nPutting the ball in the onion bag; I reckon less than a third of elite footballers are comfortable doing this. And it's not easy to get these players; young ones go for crazy amounts, old ones cost a bomb too.\nThe new players are clearly talented, but I think it's worth bearing in mind what a difficult task they are being set. For varying reasons, these players have had underwhelming seasons, and so little old Everton have been able to attract them.\nBut they are players low in confidence, coming into a team that has forgotten how to score many goals. So, let's hope they lift us up, rather than us dragging them down.\nDyche is happier keeping it tight, and it's worth reflecting that if we can get a good right back this summer, we'll have a defence as good as any in the Premier League.\n140 Posted 25/07/2024 at 16:18:08\nDave you'd be spitting feathers if you'd read the player your referring to's latest public offering.\nIn short, he reckons that, because Everton play a \"different kind\" of football, he wasn't able to show his full skillset … but he was able to do so at the Euros.\nSee Dave, we were just unlucky enough not to play the type of football to make him look amazing, whereas in the Euros, Belgium did — and he showed just what he can do.\n[*Author's note*: For those who don't recognize sarcasm (the Yanks, for instance), this post may contain a certain amount.]\n141 Posted 25/07/2024 at 16:40:05\nIn case you're desperate to read the words of the great footballing talent Brian is teasing about who is no longer with us… I posted them for you on the second Onana thread.\n142 Posted 25/07/2024 at 17:18:15\nSome very interesting, informative and respectful posts and debates.\n143 Posted 25/07/2024 at 17:27:18\n144 Posted 25/07/2024 at 17:32:24\n145 Posted 25/07/2024 at 17:38:27\nThe first post on the Doucoure subject was yours @ [95] which was answered by Jay Harris @ [97] followed by yourself @ [100] and I came in [@] [110].\nI'm quite willing to draw a veil over the subject and I apologise for any ill-will that may have resulted.\n146 Posted 25/07/2024 at 18:23:04\nNot so mate.\nThere were sixteen post sandwiched between post 51 and post 75, which all referenced the Doucoure situation and his playing ability / Value to the team.\nMy post (95) was not the 1st. it was the 18th. It was chiefly in response to the 17th - Mike (92). He's clearly a big admirer. While I simply cannot accept Doucoure is irreplaceable.\nI'm happy to draw a veil over this entire thread. I've said just about as much as I have got to say.\nApologies? None asked for, none required. We're passionate Evertonians and I'd be far more worried if we didn't disagree on at least a million things.\n147 Posted 25/07/2024 at 19:17:00\nJohn, thanks for your typical gentlemanly reply and please accept my apologies for misrepresenting you.\nI should not post on here minutes after watching CNN's reporting on the latest Trump rally.\n148 Posted 25/07/2024 at 19:46:31\nYou say, if Dom goes, you'd be happy with Beto first choice, that he'd surprise some? He definitely wouldn't surprise me.\nLooking at him up close in Sligo, his touch was shocking and even the fans around me were shaking their heads with how poor he was, he nearly hit the corner flag with the outside of his right foot from 10 yards.\nNot impressed with Onana saying he wasn't allowed play his normal game at Everton, and highlighting his performance for Belgium at the Euros. I personally couldn't see any difference.\n150 Posted 25/07/2024 at 21:34:03\nWe all know of Tony's achievements but not only was I two-footed and a skilful header of the ball but I was also team captain.\nMy headmaster told my dad he had no idea how I could be replaced when I moved on to secondary school!\n151 Posted 25/07/2024 at 21:40:41\nWe are not worthy, we are not worthy.\n152 Posted 26/07/2024 at 13:37:21\nOutgoing:\nApart from those who were sold or let go — Godfrey, Onana, Dobbin, Danjuma, Andre Gomes — I expect Thelwell to sell Maupay and Holgate (hopefully we get about ~£5M each). I make that as £45-50M in net sales.\nIncoming:\nTom Iroegbunam (£10M) — I haven't seen him play, but he should get some useful minutes this season.\nNdiaye (£15M) — very interesting player, and it feels good to have him in the team. He should play the Doucoure role this season.\nHarrison (on loan) — I don't expect him to be a regular starter, but he will be a useful squad player.\nLindstrÃ¸m (on loan) — hope this happens quickly, he looks an excellent prospect if Dyche can get him to discover his German form.\nI may be going against popular opinion here but, even if Calvert-Lewin does not sign a contract extension, I think we should keep him. Because I believe he would be stretching every sinew to score as many goals as possible to get himself a good deal next season.\nSo, if he gets us 15+ goals, he could get his dream £130k/week contract, and for us it would almost definitely mean a Top 10 finish, which would be a fantastic progression for the club.\nAlso, I don't think signing a full-back is a top priority for us. I would really like to see Nathan Patterson get a good run of games, he is a good footballer but things haven't yet clicked for him at Everton so far.\nI would be ecstatic to have Kalvin Phillips on loan, I think he is a class footballer, who would be an excellent defensive midfielder, and will do a better job than what Onana did for us last season.\nThe position that Thelwell should really target is centre-back, in my opinion. We all know that Branthwaite will likely be sold next season, and we need to plan on his replacement right now.\nSo, I would go with Sam's suggestion for the centre-back position: Jake O'Brien - even if he costs £20-25M.\nAnd I hope that Dele Alli comes good and he can make us play better.\nNet Outflow: £40-45M\nSo, my Everton squad for 2024-25:\nGoalkeeper: Pickford, Virginia, Tyrer\nFull-back: Coleman, Young, Mykolenko, Patterson\nCentre-Back: Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Keane, O'Brien\nCentre-Midfield: Garner, Gana, Phillips, Iroegbunam\nLeft- & Right-Wing: McNeil, Harrison, Lindstrom\nAttacking Midfield: Doucoure, Ndiaye, Dele Alli\nCentre-Forwards: Calvert-Lewin, Beto, Chermiti\nA starting XI (4-2-3-1) of:\nPickford\nMykolenko Branthwaite Tarkowski Patterson\nPhillips Gana\nMcNeil Ndiaye Lindstrom\nCalvert-Lewin\nLooks very competitive on paper.\nOptions from the bench: Virginia, Young, Coleman, O'Brien, Keane, Alli, Garner, Doucoure, Iroegbunam, Harrison, Chermiti, Beto.\nThis squad should see us safe this season. Also, our player sales and reliance on mostly loan incomings and a few low-cost purchases should hopefully ensure that we stay within the PSR rules.\nAs at the beginning of every season, I am optimistic that we will 'do well' and by that I mean a Top 10 finish and maybe a semi-final appearance in one of the 2 cup competitions.\n153 Posted 01/08/2024 at 07:35:26\nSadly Gnonto looks unlikely now (especially with Summerville leaving for West Ham) and there's been no mention of Kadioglu.\nI think a solid right-back and a winger with electric pace may have been my priorities at the start of the summer. It may be that in LindstrÃ¸m we have the latter but I was excited at the prospect of Gnonto. And the full-back berths look very weak, especially with Mykolenko still out.\nIt's been a promising window so far, let's see what Thelwell can manage in the second half of it.\n154 Posted 02/08/2024 at 06:49:48\nWith Everton having now snapped up O'Brien though, even if you discount the aforementioned Welch who has only ever played senior matches for the club in cup competitions, Sean Dyche could in theory name an entire team of players 6ft and above with an average height of 6ft 2Â½in if he picked Branthwaite at left-back like he did against Fulham in the Carabao Cup last season. This could be done by picking the following side:\nâ€¢ Joao Virginia (6ft 3in)\nâ€¢ Nathan Patterson (6ft 2in)\nâ€¢ Jarrad Branthwaite (6ft 5in)\nâ€¢ Michael Keane (6ft 3in)\nâ€¢ Jake O'Brien (6ft 6in)\nâ€¢ Tim Iroegbunam (6ft)\nâ€¢ James Garner (6ft 1in)\nâ€¢ Jesper Lindstrom (6ft)\nâ€¢ Dwight McNeil (6ft)\nâ€¢ Beto (6ft 4in)\nâ€¢ Youssef Chermiti (6ft 4in)\n155 Posted 02/08/2024 at 06:52:58\n156 Posted 02/08/2024 at 07:39:37\n157 Posted 02/08/2024 at 10:45:18\n159 Posted 02/08/2024 at 11:19:53\nI'll only be glad to see him go when we have more players able to score.\n160 Posted 02/08/2024 at 21:17:55\nHopefully the link below works (2nd attempt):\nBasically it shows that Everton were 11th last season in offering minutes to teenage players in the Premier League. As ever you can read all sorts of things (or not) into the stats - but thought it was an interesting article.\n161 Posted 02/08/2024 at 23:09:01\nWest Ham signing Guido Rodriguez, Summerville and Fullkrug these next few days by the sounds of it. That's a very handy trio, they should do well this season. Another team we were above not that long ago but are now playing catch up on.\n162 Posted 28/08/2024 at 16:48:42\nAnd Brighton go and sign Ferdi Kadioglu, one of the best players I saw at Euro 2024, who can play all 3 positions, and we're not in the mix at all.\n163 Posted 06/06/2025 at 12:02:32\n164 Posted 11/11/2025 at 21:26:54\n168 Posted 11/11/2025 at 23:51:03\n169 Posted 11/11/2025 at 00:09:26\n170 Posted 11/11/2025 at 00:17:50\n171 Posted 11/11/2025 at 00:21:46\n173 Posted 11/11/2025 at 00:40:11\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
