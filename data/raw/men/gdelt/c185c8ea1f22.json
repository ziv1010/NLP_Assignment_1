  "body_text": "Chelsea eyeing Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel as doubts grow over Robert Sanchez's performances between the posts. The Premier League club's management has started exploring top-tier alternatives to address their goalkeeping concerns, despite having Sanchez as their current first choice and Filip Jorgensen as backup.\nChelsea's current goalkeeping concerns\nUnder manager Enzo Maresca's guidance, Chelsea has climbed to second place in the Premier League and tops the UEFA Conference League table. However, the team's defensive weaknesses have become more noticeable, with Sanchez struggling to maintain consistency since joining from Brighton in 2023.\nLooking at Sanchez's numbers reveals a troubling trend - only three clean sheets in 15 league games while conceding 18 goals. His recent form has dipped further, with just one clean sheet in his last 10 Premier League outings. His footwork and distribution skills have drawn criticism and need substantial improvement.\nMeanwhile, summer recruit Jorgensen, who arrived from Villarreal, has only featured in Conference League and EFL Cup matches. Though Sanchez's contract runs until 2030, the club's leadership wants to upgrade their goalkeeping options.\nGregor Kobel: A target for the Blues\nChelsea's interest in Kobel comes from his remarkable displays at Borussia Dortmund. The 27-year-old Swiss keeper played a key role in Dortmund's Champions League final run in 2023-24, keeping six clean sheets in 12 matches. His outstanding performances earned him back-to-back selections in the Bundesliga Team of the Year.\nThis campaign, Kobel has maintained his high level with six clean sheets in 19 games, despite Dortmund's disappointing eighth-place position in the Bundesliga and early cup elimination. Their potential failure to qualify for Champions League football might help Chelsea's pursuit of the goalkeeper.\nAlthough Kobel recently signed a contract extension until 2028 with Dortmund, Chelsea's talent scouts believe he has the potential to become world-class. The club plans to wait until the season ends before making any moves, ruling out a January transfer.\nIs Kobel really necessary?\nWhile Kobel would offer an upgrade over Sanchez, Chelsea must evaluate if this investment is essential. The club has Jorgensen showing potential in limited appearances, plus Gabriel Slonina and Djordje Petrovic developing through loan spells.\nChelsea has already reduced their interest in other targets like Karim Adeyemi, feeling confident about their attacking options. The club's decision-makers need to consider if strengthening the goalkeeper position takes priority over other squad needs.\nAny move for Kobel will likely depend on where Dortmund finishes in the league. Chelsea must carefully weigh their immediate requirements against long-term planning as they decide whether to pursue the Swiss keeper or stick with their current options.",
