Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nReijnders, in particular, shone across an eye-catching debut, doubling City’s lead before assisting Erling Haaland at Molineux – and Hasselbaink was mightily impressed with what he saw from his fellow Dutchman.\n‘He’s not going to get as many assists as De Bruyne,’ Hasselbaink told Sky Sports News of Reijnders’ impressive start for City.\n‘He’s going to be more available and I think he’s going to score more goals than De Bruyne. But assists-wise, I don’t think that there are going to be as many.\n‘But the boy can play and they have found a diamond there.’\nThe former Chelsea and Netherlands striker has seen enough to believe that City are ‘the team to beat’ again after their disappointing season last term.\n‘Manchester City is my favourite for the year to win the title,’ Hasselbaink added.\n‘Everyone is talking about Liverpool and I do think it’s going to be very close, but Manchester City, for me, is the team to beat.’\nDuring an interview with HaytersTV, Hasselbaink’s former Chelsea team-mate Joe Cole backed Liverpool to successfully defend their title having won ‘at a canter’ last season.\nCole also revealed his doubts surrounding Arsenal’s marquee summer signing Viktor Gyokeres, who he feels is yet to prove himself despite his extraordinary goalscoring exploits at Sporting.\n‘I make them [Liverpool] favourites [for the title]. They’ve strengthened and they won it at a canter last season,’ Cole told Hayters TV.\nMore Trending\n‘I think this might be [Mikel] Arteta’s best chance that he’s had. He’s got a centre-forward in, but there’s still a question mark there.\n‘It’s not like you’re bringing in a player like… if Arsenal would’ve gone and signed Osimhen, who I’ve seen do it in Italy and in Turkey…\n‘This kid [Gyokeres], there is still a question mark. I think he’s going to be alright, I think he’ll score goals, but I just think Liverpool are the best side at the moment.\n‘The best chance the other teams have is if Liverpool have a slow start because there’s a lot of change, but by the end of the season I expect them to be motoring.’\nAre Man City the favourites for the title?\n-\nYes\n-\nNo\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Chelsea legend hits out at Arsenal over Eberechi Eze transfer hijack\nMORE: ‘Obvious choice’ – Chelsea urged to hijack Liverpool move for £35m transfer target\nMORE: Chelsea line up future move for Brighton star as transfer deal is agreed",
