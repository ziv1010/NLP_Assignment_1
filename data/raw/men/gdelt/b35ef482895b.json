  "body_text": "Gabriel Martinelli enjoyed a fantastic evening on the left wing during our 2-0 victory against Sevilla on Wednesday, consistently tormenting full-back Juanlu from as early as the very first minute.\nThe winger repeatedly beat his man, and was a constant thorn in the Sevilla defence all evening, as we dominated the 90 minutes to put ourselves on the brink of qualifying for the knockout stages.\n\"I think we did well today, and we deserved the win,\" the Brazilian said afterwards.\n\"Every game I want the ball as quickly as possible to have the advantage to go and take the full-back on one-on-one. This is what I like to do, and I think the team knows that. Me and B are good at that, and today it’s what you want.\n\"If you go one, two or three times and you beat your opponent, you get more confidence and that’s what happened today.\"\nGabi's efforts finally paid off in the second half, when he provided the assist for Bukayo Saka's goal.\n\"I told him that he’s going to have to pay me for dinner!\" he said. \"I’m so happy with the win and for his goal as well.\n\"It’s so good to play here at home with our supporters, and we just try to do our best on the pitch to show them our qualities and win for them.\"\nWatch the full interview with Gabi by pressing play on the video above\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
