It is as a result of the increasingly serious escalation in these unacceptable behaviours and non-compliance with applicable regulations that the progressive steps are being taken by the Club.\"\nThe Green Brigade, which occupy the north curve of Celtic Park, traditionally organise a tifo - a choreographed display involving a large banner or image - for major games.\nThe group handed out Palestinian flags and held up banners before last Wednesday's Champions League match against Spanish side Atletico Madrid.\nThe flags were also waved in other parts of the stadium as well as the section occupied by the group.\nAhead of the game, the club told supporters that players and coaching staff from both sides would wear black armbands \"as a show of respect and support for all those affected by the conflict\".\nBut it said banners, flags and symbols relating to the Israel-Hamas conflict \"should not be displayed at Celtic Park at this time\".\nCeltic are widely expected to face a Uefa fine over the flags.\nFans of the club have also displayed Palestinian flags at recent Scottish Premiership games against Kilmarnock - hours after Hamas launched an attack on Israel - and Hearts.\nIn a previous statement, the Green Brigade reiterated their \"unshakeable belief\" that football supporters have the right to express political beliefs.\nIt accused the Celtic board of being disingenuous and hypocritical over their claim that the club was apolitical, citing issues over the club's history and the war in Ukraine.\nThe statement urged fans to \"raise the Palestine flag on the European stage\" at the Atletico match \"to show the world that Celtic Football Club stands with the oppressed, not the oppressor\".\nThe Glasgow club was founded in the late 19th Century to help feed the poor in the east end of the city.\nSections of the fan base have previously used matches to support social justice causes and make political statements.\nMany Celtic fans have long had an affiliation with the Palestinian cause, with Uefa fining the club in 2014 after fans waved Palestinian flags during a match against Iceland's KR Reykjavik.\nThe Green Brigade chose to display the flag once again during their team's 2016 Champions League qualifier against Israeli side, Hapoel Beer-Sheva - a move which landed the club a £8,600 fine.\nThe club have distanced themselves from the flags and banners, and both Uefa and Fifa have said that politics and football should not mix.\nThe latest Celtic statement said: \"The Club should also note that it has been advised of a number of banners and flags used by the Green Brigade which relate to or are connected with terrorist organisations involved in the conflict in the Middle East.\n\"This is completely unacceptable at Celtic Park and any match involving Celtic Football Club.\n\"The Club is continuing to investigate these and other unacceptable instances of the groups actions.\"\nRelated topics\n- Published25 October 2023\n- Published25 October 2023",
