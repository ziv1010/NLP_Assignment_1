  "body_text": "Arsenal have been given renewed hope of signing Sandro Tonali in the summer, with the midfielder’s agent refusing to rule out a big-money move away from Newcastle.\nThe Gunners made a last-ditch approach for Tonali in the closing stages of the January transfer window following an injury to Mikel Merino, who is expected to be sidelined for approximately four months.\nWith the clock ticking on deadline day, Sky Sports reporter Florian Plettenberg claimed the Premier League leaders had entered into ‘direct talks’ in an attempt to prise Tonali away from St James’ Park.\nNewcastle made it clear Tonali was not for sale, though, and wasted little time in knocking back Arsenal’s audacious efforts to land the 25-year-old Italy international.\nMikel Arteta made no secret of the fact Arsenal were ‘trying to find solutions’ to replace the injured Merino, but the Spaniard was ultimately left disappointed as the transfer deadline came and went on Monday.\nSubsequent reports suggested it would likely require an eye-watering offer of at least £100million to lure Tonali away from Newcastle given his importance to Eddie Howe’s plans going forward.\n‘Newcastle is having a hard time letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club into the Champions League,’ Tonali’s agent Giuseppe Riso explained in a new interview with Italian publication Tuttosport.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘These transfer discussions will take place later.’\nThough Tonali is not actively seeking an escape route out of St James’ Park at this stage, Riso could not rule out the possibility that his client may soon be on the move.\n‘We’ll see how the season ends and then decide what to do,’ Riso added.\nArsenal are not the only team to explore a possible bid for Tonali, with Serie A giants Juventus known to be long-term admirers of the former Brescia and AC Milan man.\nAsked if Tonali could be set to return to the Italian top flight next season, Riso replied: ‘There’s no preference right now.\n‘It’s still early. What we’re saying today won’t apply tomorrow.\n‘Newcastle couldn’t part with him now and it wasn’t worth moving, especially since Sandro is very attached to the club.\n‘We’ll evaluate things in the summer and decide what to do.’\nTonali has made 93 appearances in all competitions across his three-year stay in Newcastle and was on the winning side last season as Howe’s men went all the way in the Carabao Cup.\nA ten-month ban – after Tonali was found to have breached Italian betting regulations – meant the midfielder played just eight league games in the debut season with the Magpies.\nTonali’s current contract in the north east runs through to June 2028, with the option of a further 12 months.\nAccording to Alan Shearer, Newcastle may find it incredibly difficult to keep hold of the likes of Tonali should they fail to secure Champions League qualification for next season.\n‘Sandro Tonali hasn’t hit the heights he was at last season, but I guess what’ll happen is, if Newcastle aren’t going to qualify for Europe or be competitive in the Premier League, you’d expect other clubs will look at Newcastle and try to buy their best players,’ Shearer told Betfair.\nMore Trending\n‘Although it was a surprise in the January window, I think it’ll happen more in the summer if Newcastle don’t achieve what they have in the past few years.\nIs Sandro Tonali worth £100m?\n-\nYes\n-\nNo\n‘Top players want to play Champions League football, and we know there’s no real loyalty in football – I’m not saying Tonali will do anything like that, but we know if clubs don’t get into European places, other clubs will try and pick players up.\n‘Newcastle have to start winning games and go far in the FA Cup and hopefully the Champions League to try and rescue what, at the minute, certainly Premier League wise, has been a disappointing return.\n‘I know we got to a semi-final and all those years ago we’d craved for that but then the money that’s been spent and put into the club and where the club wants to go to, at the minute it’s been disappointing.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: ‘They celebrated far too much’ – John Terry slams Arsenal reaction to Chelsea win\nMORE: Wolves vs Chelsea: Predicted lineup today and confirmed team news\nMORE: Arsenal vs Sunderland: Predicted lineup today and confirmed team news",
