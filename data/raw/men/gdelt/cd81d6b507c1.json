Erling Haaland followed up in the 13th minute to make it two goals up for the Cityzens in 13 minutes. The Norwegian history maker, however took the game beyond the reach of Iheanacho and his Super Eagles teammate in the 25th minute.\nNow Haaland looks like breaking the landmarks set by former England strikers Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, who both netted 34 goals in a single season. He now have 47 goals from 40 games in all competition.\nThe Nigerian forward however scored his consolation goal deep in the 75th. Leicester are sitting 19th in the relegation zone.\nCity are to now face a pivotal three games which could make or break their season as they aim to complete a Treble of trophies.\nThey will travel to Bayern Munich with a healthy 3-0 advantage after the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final, before playing Championship side Sheffield United in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday.\nPep Guardiola’s side should progress from both of those ties, but their next league game is a potential title decider against Mikel Arteta’s men, at home on Wednesday, 26 April at Etihad Stadium.\n“Like I said in the previous press conference, it is to win win win,” said Guardiola.\n“They (Arsenal) have had an incredible run so far this season, I don’t think they will drop many points and we have to be in there.\n“It is important for us to arrive at the match by winning today and (it is) a final against them in the next Premier League game.”\nArsenal can re-establish their six-point advantage when they face West Ham on Sunday and the gap could be nine points by the time they meet City as they play an extra league game against bottom club Southampton next Friday.\n“It is a final to play more finals,” Guardiola said about facing Arsenal. “If we lose this game it will be almost over.\n“We have to arrive in this position having the chance to be close to Arsenal. We want this opportunity knowing how difficult it will be but before that we have a Champions League semi-final chance and the FA Cup.”",
