  "body_text": "Another Champions League game, another win to celebrate at Emirates Stadium.\nAfter our 3-1 victory over Bayern Munich, Mikel Arteta met the media and he was asked about the win, our form, the scale of the win, Leandro Trossard's injury, Noni Madueke's goal and more.\nRead every word below:\nOn keeping the players grounded:\nWell, first of all, I have to praise our players because I think they had an incredible match against, in my opinion, the best team in Europe. Individually, we were immense to resolve all the challenges that these teams bring to the table. After, yes, they know how hard we worked to prepare for every single game. We know that the margins are super small. We started the week really well against Spurs, winning here at home. Today is another massive victory, but that's it. Now we go home, have a nice dinner and tomorrow morning we start to prepare for Stamford Bridge.\nOn closing the gap on the best in Europe:\nWell, we've certainly been very, very consistent in the competition so far, but it's just the beginning. We are so pleased with what we've seen today. Again, the energy that we created in the stadium, what the team transmits, the energy that we bring, the quality that we play with. It's incredible and we have to maintain that because it's still very early. Unfortunately, every three days you have to do it and that's the beauty of it as well.\nOn how big tonight was for the club:\nWell, they are a top side. I think they haven't lost in 20 or 21 games and you see the record. So you know the difficulty of that. We managed to do that in one game. That's great and that shows as well the capacity that we have. I'm very pleased as well with some of the players that they've been given the opportunity today with all the injuries that we have. The ones that they started, the ones that they came as well to finish the game. The impact was immense and that's what we need. Everybody connected at that level.\nOn the strength in depth in our squad:\nYeah, well I think I'm very happy. When I was looking at the bench of Bayern, the same. You know, I look at the players that are coming in and they can change the game. So that's why you're required at this level. We certainly have improved that, not only with the quality but as well with the mindset of the players coming in and that's something that is making a huge difference for us.\nOn the latest with Trossard:\nWith Leo we don't know. He said he felt something. We didn't want to take any risks.\nOn selecting the team for Sunday:\nWe know. You just have to watch the game that they played against Barcelona yesterday to understand how difficult and tough and what a good team Chelsea are. So we know tomorrow, we start to prepare and we go from there.\nOn Madueke’s first goal for the club:\nVery happy. He's worked incredibly hard to come back. I think he was in a great moment before he got the injuries. He's one of the players who was performing at the highest level and now we've got him back. He played on the left, he played on the right. He gave us something as a different edge in that front line. I'm very pleased to see him and hopefully many more to come.\nOn what our aim is for the Champions League:\nYeah, obviously. In any competition, the quicker you can wrap it up, the better. But we know the difficulty of that. We still have very, very difficult games ahead of us, but we are in a really positive position at the moment.\nOn starting Mosquera tonight:\nI think he was really good. With Piero [Hincapié], we need to understand where he's coming from. He came from Ecuador after playing two 90s in big trouble – played the derby, the first start that he had in the Premier League, and he finished the game very, very tired. [But] that's the good thing that we have Mosquera who he can play in different positions. He was superb I think, both together with William [Saliba].\nOn whether the team are ahead of where they planned to be:\nI don't know. Obviously we didn't predict to have this many important players out, but the good thing is the way the team reacts constantly and players have to adapt to different positions. I think, for example, what Mikel [Merino] has done today, I think it's incredible. It's a big compliment to all of them because they are so willing to play, so willing to bring joy to this club and to win football matches. That's what we have to carry on.\nOn the difference between Arsenal now and two years ago:\nWe are different, and they are different as well. It was a different stage in the competition. There were very thin margins there in that tie as well, and the way we went out – but that's part of the past hopefully. We learn, we are better and we're going to have to show that.\nOn Calafiori’s impact and his instructions from the bench:\nThat's exactly what I told him! Get the ball, go to the flank, cross the ball between the side of the keeper and score a goal. I like it because he has such an attitude and aura. He comes in to make things happen and he's always so positive the way he plays. It's great that players come with that mindset.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
