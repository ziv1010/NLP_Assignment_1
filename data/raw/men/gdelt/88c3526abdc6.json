But you can also be playing well in the right place at the right time.\nJust ask Mauricio Pochettino — or don’t — after the USMNT boss was infuriated by any suggestion he has ‘regulars’ whose future is cemented in his team.\nAdvertisement\nBut ask Auston Trusty, who got his chance in that statement 5-1 win over Uruguay last week, assisting a goal in an assured display on only his fifth international appearance.\nAfter an injury-plagued and challenging start to the season with his domestic team Celtic, the 27-year-old’s fortunes are looking up when it comes to club and country.\nHe has been restricted to just five league appearances, and only three starts, for the Scottish side during a tumultuous campaign so far. Last month the defending Premiership champions parted ways with manager Brendan Rodgers, and their poor start means they trail surprise leaders Hearts by four points.\nHaving been a frustrated bystander for most of the season, Trusty has returned to fitness and form under interim coach Martin O’Neill, and earned a call-up to Pochettino’s roster for the last national team games of the calendar year. On Monday, The Athletic reported Celtic are working to finalize the appointment of Columbus Crew head coach Wilfried Nancy as their new permanent manager.\n“My mindset going into the second game was to take advantage of the opportunity and really show my ability,” he says after arriving back in Glasgow from Tampa, Fla., where he played the full game after being an unused substitute in the 2-1 win over Paraguay in his home state of Pennsylvania.\n“I back myself. I’ve played and still do play at the highest level against the highest caliber players.\n“I have a lot of experience in this game and it’s allowed me to have a lot of confidence in how I read the game.\n“So having the opportunity again to represent my country and positively impact a statement win meant everything to me.\n“I’m trying to fight for a spot. It’s just about winning.”\nTrusty says the emphasis on winning has been reinforced by life at Parkhead, where success is expected and he won the title along with the League Cup in his first season.\nAdvertisement\nBut it is also hammered home by Pochettino, who has little time for a ‘friendly’ mentality, even without points or qualification at stake.\nJust witness the body language of his players when Rodrigo Bentancur slid into a reckless challenge on Sebastian Berhalter on Tuesday. The home side surrounded referee Julio Luna Guzmán and six different U.S. players remonstrated with him, before he showed the Tottenham Hotspur man a red card.\nAlready 4-1 up, it was nevertheless clear that nobody was minded to drop the intensity.\n“When you see that, it shows that people actually care,” says Trusty. “A lot of times you could just walk off and kind of let it go, but it shows that people care about the player, but also about the game.\n“People will say, ‘Oh, it’s a friendly, blah blah blah, maybe you could take it a little bit easier’ — but that’s not the mindset whatsoever.\n“Take the refs — historically they are maybe going to be a little bit more lenient and guys can take advantage of that. Maybe they don’t give a foul, so you have to make it known and show you’re seeing it’s not OK.\n“One, you can actually hurt somebody, but also if you’re gonna tackle my player, we’re gonna make sure it’s called out.\n“That’s what the mindset is, especially being a teammate.”\nThat is why Trusty was not surprised that his coach took umbrage at any suggestion the line-up that won the game was second string, even if it was without regulars such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Chris Richards and Malik Tillman. Second-string would suggest less importance and that implication is anathema to the USMNT boss.\n“I think what he (Pochettino) meant by that is that it’s a team environment, and there is no person bigger than the team,” he says. “There’s not necessarily regular players. Everybody has an equal opportunity and as soon as you put that national team shirt on, we’re all equals.\nAdvertisement\n“He’s building a culture and things like being complacent or having expectations, yeah, he’s not trying to have that around.”\nTrusty says Pochettino has a groundswell of loyalty from the players thanks to how he has approached building his squad, including giving more opportunities to Major League Soccer players, and those on the fringes.\n“It’s winning for a gaffer that believes in you,” he says. “His message afterwards was that this was a step in the right direction. I think this is what he wanted, and we were able to give him what he deserved. He’s backed us and he’s a great coach.\n“When someone believes in you, you want to fight for them. So to give him a win where he can be celebrated himself was good.”\nTrusty still has plenty to do to force his way into the next year’s World Cup squad, but he feels he may benefit from momentum.\n“It seems like things on my end are aligning,” he says. “At Celtic, but also just overall career-wise. The highs, lows, everything in between, it all comes to moments you can take advantage of, and I feel like everything right now is aligning.\n“Tuesday proved that whoever you are, whatever has happened in the past, the opportunity is there. I think that the manager wanted to make that clear: that no one is cemented and there’s opportunity.”\nRewind to August and Trusty felt less buoyant. An injury to a foot muscle meant he could barely walk, let alone run, without pain.\n“After preseason I tore my plantar fascia at the bottom of my foot,” he explains. “It happened in a Champions League qualifier. I took a step and just felt the bottom of my foot just like rip.\n“It’s just one of those things that takes forever to heal, and doesn’t get much blood flow down there.\n“It was unfortunate timing. From last year, being one of the main guys on the team, winning two trophies and being one of the best players on the team in the Champions League, to being on the sidelines.”\nAdvertisement\nDuring his time out of the team, Celtic’s form fluctuated and Rodgers became increasingly disgruntled at what he perceived as a lack of ambition from above.\nLast month Rodgers resigned abruptly and afterwards, in an extraordinary turn, the club’s largest individual shareholder Dermot Desmond accused Rodgers of creating a “toxic” atmosphere in a terse statement.\nTrusty and his teammates were bemused.\n“We were definitely shocked,” he says. “We all found out by Instagram, and then in the team group chat. It was a crazy time.”\nHe says none of the players had a chance to exchange parting words with the manager.\n“We basically found out by social media and then Martin was in the next day. It was weird how everything played out, but yeah, we didn’t hear anything.\n“Everything happens fast, you know, obviously for Celtic, it’s a business for them as well, so they have to move fast.\n“Unfortunately that’s how the sport works. The show goes on, then you’ve got a game the next day.”\nHe says he has not spoken to Rodgers since. “The football world’s very small,” he adds. “I’m sure we’ll cross paths again.”\nO’Neill has proved a stabilizing figure with results and morale improving. Celtic have won their last three league games and beat rivals Rangers in the semi-finals of the League Cup.\nDoes he believe Celtic can catch Hearts and reassert their dominance?\n“I think we have really good fans, and it’s a long season. The fans here have been supporters for many generations, so they’ve seen a lot of football over the years,” he says, talking before the news of Nancy’s potential move to Celtic. “They know it’s a very, very long season.\n“Especially going into the winter, that’s when it really tests you and that’s where Celtic can shine.\n“We’re an experienced group of players too, and in this league, experience is big. I fully believe in us.”\nAdvertisement\nOn an individual level, he provided an assist in the 3-1 win over Rangers and another, via that deft pass to Alex Freeman, in Tampa.\n“It’s one of the big benefits of how I play,” he explains of his attacking mindset. “When I play with two center-backs, or even if I’m playing with three center-backs, I’m very mobile. I just play the game and respond to what it gives.\n“In any situation I’m more than happy, more than capable of taking in space and being aggressive and being in a more offensive role. Some center-backs want to kind of stay back in their zone.\n“Look at the same time, I love to defend. But yeah I enjoy getting forward and making numerical advantages that are difficult for the other team.”\nTrusty puts his ball-playing ability — he was the most accurate passer on the team in the Uruguay win — down to his youth soccer experiences.\n“Back in the day I used to be a forward until I was 16,” says the former Philadelphia Union, Colorado Rapids and Arsenal player. “Maybe that’s why I like to always creep up there.\n“I was basically a winger for a long time, even if I always knew I was a center-back deep down.\n“When I got to the academy stages, I just felt: put me in the back because if I’m going to do anything in this profession, I’m just going to be the defender because. It’s what I have most joy doing.”\nCurrently he is finding joy off the field from becoming a new dad, to a baby girl.\n“It’s amazing,” he says with a broad smile. “It’s just completely life-changing and in the best ways.\n“Thankfully my wife is amazing and she’s been taking it for the team when it comes to sleep and night feeds.”\nWith six months to go, Trusty’s focus on the field is helping Celtic’s revival and, ultimately, gathering the momentum to surge into Pochettino’s World Cup squad.\n“I can only control what I can control,” he says. “And that is just performances and being a good teammate. That’s the only thing that really really matters at the end of the day.”",
