That doesn't mean you have to miss out on watching Nottingham Forest vs Wolverhampton Wanderers. All you need is a VPN, a handy a piece of software that makes your devices appear to be in a different location.\nFourFourTwo’s colleagues TechRadar have tested hundreds of VPNs, and they say NordVPN is the best VPN you can get.\n🥇 World's best VPN service\n🙌 Fast, secure, easy to use\n✅ Unblocks Peacock\nSee also ► Premier League TV guide\nNottingham Forest vs Wolverhampton Wanderers: Premier League preview\nIt increasingly seems as if every match has the potential to tip Forest's season one way or the other, but it's closer to the truth to say that their back-to-back fixtures against Leeds and all-but-down Wolves could set the course.\nLosing the first of those matches last Friday was a distinct possibility but the notion of following that with dropped points at home against Wolves doesn't bear thinking about.\nThat's what's facing Forest today. Wolves can't buy a point at the moment but how's this for an uncomfortable truth: all three of Wolves' defeats since the end of a four-match unbeaten run, undeniably the high point of their abysmal season, have been against teams playing a lot better than Forest.\nForest did beat Wolves when they met at Molineux in early December. Igor Jesus scored the only goal of the game.\nTickets\nGet VIP Nottingham Forest tickets HERE with Seat Unique!\nNottingham Forest's Seat Unique Club provides an elevated VIP experience with an exclusive entrance and premium padded balcony seating.

Guests also enjoy a match programme, half-time tea/coffee, and a full-time cheeseboard (yes, really!) in a welcoming, family-friendly environment.\nAfter 25 matches, Wolves are on track to be relegated with 24 or 25 goals scored. Only five teams in the history of the Premier League have gone down with a worse goal average than Wolves' this season.\nWhether they'll even score the eight goals they need to keep that up is by no means assured but their dismal current tally of 16 is one of the component parts of their calamitous campaign.\nWolves already need a pile of miracles to climb to 19th, never mind 20th, but a loss at Forest would likely put paid to any hopes of respectability this season.\nThe Black Country side will play Crystal Palace next and then it's three of the current top seven, followed by three of the current bottom six. Right now, it's hard to see how they even make double figures.\nSee also ► These are the cheapest ways to watch the Premier League this season\nFourFourTwo's prediction\nNottingham Forest 1-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers\nDyche should be concerned that there's not much to choose these teams but we can't wrap our heads around the idea of Wolves getting a result away from home at the moment.\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses.
