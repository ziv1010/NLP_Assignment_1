  "body_text": "Mikel Arteta wants us to continue to write our own history when it comes to the Champions League, starting by advancing to the semi-finals by knocking out the current holders, Real Madrid.\nAfter landing in his homeland with his team 3-0 up on aggregate against Real, the boss spoke about the excitement in the camp at being in this position and playing at one of the finest stadiums in the world, against one of the greatest teams in the world in Europe’s premier club competition.\nHaving exited the competition at this stage against Bayern Munich last season, Mikel hopes lessons have been learnt this time around and from our ups and downs throughout the current campaign, and if they have, then he is thrilled at the prospect of clinching just our third Champions League semi-final in 23 attempts.\n“When you have to create a story, first of all, you have to be excited about it,” he said in his pre-match press conference. “You have to be really prepared about it, and then you have to be really convinced about what you want to achieve. Then it's about insisting, and going step by step.\n“A lot of clubs have built their history by doing it many times, trying many times, sometimes failing, sometimes being successful. Last year, we had an experience and with that one, we want to be better this season, and apply that to reach the semi-finals, which will be only our third time in the history of our football club.\n“There are three main aspects in the game, the physical aspect, the technical and tactical aspect, and the emotional aspect. And that emotional aspect is very significant, because I have a lot of reassurance from what the team has done all season, in positive contexts, and in very difficult contexts. So to prepare for a scenario like this, and to be convinced that we can handle any situation, we're going to enjoy playing any kind of game that we are thrown tomorrow.”\nThere has been much talk in the holder’s camp about a comeback, with Carlo Ancelotti and Jude Bellingham beating that drum in their own pre-match press conferences. However, the stats show that we’ve not lost by three goals in over 100 games, or conceded three times in a match since December 2023.\nMikel feels that proves that we have the ability to be resolute, and when asked if we fear Madrid coming back, Mikel suggested: “I wouldn't use that word - I think it’s respect and admiration for what they've done in the competition, as a club over the years, the history they have, the values that they defend. It's unbelievable, amazing, an inspiration for any coach, any manager, any team.\n“It's part of [Madrid's] history, and they have earned the right to be talking about these kinds of scenarios. Ours is very different in our mindset, preparation and our thoughts, and how we're going to have the best chance to be better than them in the aspects that are crucial in the game.\n“It’s been 497 days [that we’ve not conceded three times in a game] but it doesn't matter. We have to prove it now in this context, and that's the beauty of it; that's the challenge and that's the great thing about sport. We've shown that we're capable of doing it, and that has to give us reassurance and confidence that we can do it. Now, let's talk on the pitch - it's the only thing that matters.”\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
