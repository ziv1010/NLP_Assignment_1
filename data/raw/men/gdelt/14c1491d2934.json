However, a new opportunity to work on football's biggest programme could now be a potential avenue.\nOften seen on TNT Sports and the BBC for major sporting events like this summer's European Championships, Chowdhury has a plethora of experience in TV and could now look to land the biggest job of her career to date.\nHuge gigs have been the co-hosting of the Champions League draw since 2017 and the draw for the 2022 World Cup alongside TV star and DJ extraordinare Idris Elba.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nThe BBC are not expected to make a decision for a few months whilst Lineker himself recently admitted he does not know who will replacement him in time for the start of the 2025/26 season.\n\"Obviously, I don't know who it'll be, and I would never tell publicly my preference, I don’t think that’d be the right thing to do – but whoever it is, I would say be yourself,\" said Lineker recently.\n\"I had to fill the ginormous shoes of certain Des Lynam. I would say just be yourself and enjoy it, it's a wonderful programme to be a part of. It was brilliant before I took over, and it will be brilliant after I leave.\"\nIn FourFourTwo's opinion, Chowdhury isn't the name we were imagining when predicting the next host of Match of the Day, in all honesty. The role needs someone to make it their own and have that sparkle that Lineker often provides, we just don't know if it is the right step.\nMatthew Holt writes freelance for FourFourTwo, amongst others, and boasts previous experience at GOAL and SPORTBible.
