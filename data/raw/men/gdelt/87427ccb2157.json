  "body_text": "It’s not just the Premier League where results are spicing things up early in the title races. Serie A is a four-horse race. Ten games into the French season and just two points separate leaders PSG from sixth-placed Lens and, most unusually of all, in Scotland, Hearts are running away from the Old Firm.\nAdvertisement\nTwo of the clubs chasing the scudetto clash this week in Italy while Rangers and Celtic do battle in the Glasgow derby. There’s plenty to watch and enjoy across Europe and here’s your quick guide to the best action this weekend:\nMilan v Roma, San Siro\nSunday 2 November, 7:45pm GMT (TNT Sports 1 / DAZN)\nAs one-horse races have claimed Germany, France, England and Spain in recent years, Italy has a good old-fashioned title scrap.\nWith four different champions across the last six Serie A seasons — three of whom won on the final day — Gian Piero Gasperini has Roma dreaming of a first Scudetto in 25 years.\nRunners-up an agonizing nine times since Fabio Capello – with free-scoring talents Gabriel Batistuta, Francesco Totti and Vincenzo Montella – guided them to the summit in 2001, Roma sit level on points with reigning victors Napoli atop the table.\nWith just 10 goals in nine matches – no team in the top half has scored fewer – a bulwark back five has conceded only four times. It would have been three had Parma not made it a nervy final few minutes in a 2-1 Roma victory Wednesday.\nBrighton loanee Evan Ferguson’s difficult spell in the capital continued as he limped off just seven minutes into the game. The Irish striker is yet to open his account in 10 appearances (five starts) and was criticized by Gasperini after a stinging home defeat to Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League last week.\n“He [Ferguson] has to deliver on the pitch and his performances haven’t been positive,” said Gasperini.\n“To be honest, yesterday was the first time I saw him train properly. He’s coming from the Premier League, and he hasn’t played much last season. We need to be patient with him.”\nPaulo Dybala’s return from injury and Artem Dovbyk’s goal against Parma bodes well for Roma conquering their woes in front of goal. Milan have not struggled at that end but have seen their title bid hurt by a series of squandered advantages in recent weeks.\nAdvertisement\nChristian Pulisic started the season in sublime form but blazed a penalty over in a 0-0 draw at Juventus earlier this month, with Massimiliano Allegri’s side drawing twice from leading positions against Pisa and Atalanta since then.\nA win against Roma would see the Rossoneri draw level on points with the visitors as the season’s first Derby della Madonnina against Inter, currently ahead on goal difference, in late November creeps ever closer.\nParis Saint-Germain vs Nice, Parc des Princes\nSaturday 1 November, 4pm GMT (Ligue 1+)\nPerhaps the least shocking statement in modern football is, currently, a little bit of a surprise: Paris Saint-Germain are somehow top of Ligue 1.\nQuite how, only their eye-wateringly inconsistent rivals will know. The four-time reigning French champions and treble winners dropped points for the fourth time already this season in a 1-1 draw at lowly Lorient on Wednesday, only for Marseille to throw away a lead for the third game running.\nMarseille, Monaco, Strasbourg, Lyon and Lens have each dropped points in four matches across the opening 10 fixtures, all missed opportunities in what could be a rare chance to draw blood from the depleted Parisian giants.\nHaving only returned from injury this month, a distraught Desire Doue left the Stade du Moustoir on crutches in midweek in another setback for manager Luis Enrique, who has already had to make do without Marquinhos, Ousmane Dembele and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and a host of other stars at various points already this campaign.\nIt has added to a strange season so far for PSG, whose patchy domestic form is a stark contrast to the irrepressible opening of their Champions League defence, with Atalanta, Barcelona and Bayer Leverkusen all put to the sword. Seemingly unstoppable Bayern Munich arrive Tuesday.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s been a similarly odd start for Nice. Without a single point in the Europa League, Franck Haise’s side started horribly in Ligue 1 yet head to the Parc des Princes chasing a fourth consecutive big scalp after beating Lyon, Rennes and Lille in October.\nA 2-2 draw at Monaco before that reaffirms Nice are more than capable of raising their game against the biggest sides in the country, and a result in the capital would be a dream confidence-booster ahead of a crucial home European tie against Freiburg on Thursday.\nReal Madrid v Valencia, Estadio Santiago Bernabeu\nSaturday 1 November, 8pm GMT (Disney+)\nAt a glance, all is bright at the Bernabeu.\nFive points clear atop La Liga after a first El Clasico win in 18 months and a perfect three from three in the Champions League, Xabi Alonso should be thrilled with an excellent start.\nBut as the former Los Blancos midfielder knows all too well, there is no other club like Real Madrid.\nThe manager has already faced scrutiny from above for his sole loss since taking charge at the Club World Cup, a 5-2 defeat at rivals Atletico Madrid last month, and from within his own dressing room by players reportedly unhappy with his management.\nDressing room disgruntlement goes beyond Vinicius Junior’s public objections to being substituted against Barcelona, as The Athletic’s Mario Cortegana explains, with players purportedly taking issue with Alonso’s “distant and unapproachable” demeanour. The coach’s name was conspicuous by its absence in Vinicius’ subsequent apology.\nHelpfully, Alonso has been on both sides. The Spaniard was part of squads bulging with ego and reputation at both Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, with Carlo Ancelotti – his Bernabeu predecessor who was, by contrast, overwhelmingly admired among the group – managing him at both clubs.\nAdvertisement\nUltimately, results – not player popularity – will determine Alonso’s fate, and should Kylian Mbappe keep firing at the same prolific rate, wins will continue to stack up.\nThe Frenchman is already up to 11 goals in La Liga and will fancy his chances of stretching his huge lead atop the scoring charts against a Valencia side who have shipped 16 across their first 10 games (including six at Barcelona) to slide into the bottom three.\nVictory would be the perfect preparation ahead of Alonso’s return to Liverpool on Tuesday night, where he can reasonably expect a warmer Anfield reception than a certain English right back at his disposal.\nBayern Munich v Bayer Leverkusen, Allianz Arena\nSaturday 1 November, 5:30pm GMT (Sky Sports Football)\nFittingly, there’s something all very ‘10 years into a Football Manager save’ about Bayern Munich at the moment.\nDominant domestically and in Europe, you’re now throwing 17-year-olds into the fray and not missing a beat. Lennart Karl, just a few days after becoming the club’s youngest Champions League goalscorer against Club Brugge, jinked in from the right to whip a sumptuous effort past rooted Borussia Monchengladbach goalkeeper Mortiz Nicolas last Saturday.\nIt put the gloss on a 13th consecutive win in all competitions to start the campaign for the Bavarian giants, matching Milan’s 1992/3 record (across Europe’s ‘top five’ leagues), but the 3-0 scoreline belied what was, for more than an hour, a frustrating afternoon at Borussia-Park.\nEven after falling down to 10 men inside 20 minutes following Jens Castrop’s straight red card, it took until Joshua Kimmich’s 64th minute strike for Vincent Kompany’s side to make the breakthrough, and the home side would have pulled one back had Kevin Stoger not crashed his penalty against the post.\nThat, and the fact that Harry Kane proved himself human by not finding the net for only the second time this season (normal service resumed with a midweek brace against Koln in the DFB Pokal), may bring some hope to Bayer Leverkusen, who have not won at the Allianz Arena in the Bundesliga since 2019.\nAdvertisement\nLed by Kasper Hjulmand after Erik Ten Hag’s fleeting stay in the dugout, the former Denmark manager has won four and drawn once in the league since taking charge.\nA humiliating 7-2 home defeat against Paris Saint-Germain threatened to puncture the mood, but Leverkusen returned to the BayArena to see off a Freiburg side who hadn’t lost in eight games.\nIt’s reason for optimism in the face of a monster task, and with Leipzig hosting Stuttgart, Leverkusen head to Bayern knowing at least one of their Champions League chasing rivals will drop points this weekend.\nCeltic v Rangers, Hampden Park\nSunday 2 November, 2pm GMT (Premier Sports 1)\nAfter resembling a dumpster fire for much of the season, it was a rare good day for Glaswegian football on Wednesday. Perfect time then, for another Old Firm to fan the flames with the two sides meeting in the semi-final of the Scottish League Cup.\nNeither manager who led each rival out for the first derby of the season just eight weeks ago, a dreary goalless league draw at Ibrox, has survived the blaze.\nRussell Martin was the first to go earlier this month, suffering the ignominy of becoming the shortest-serving manager in Rangers history after being sacked just 123 days into his tenure with his team languishing eighth in the league.\nBrendan Rodgers clung on a little longer, only to make a far more explosive exit. The Northern Irishman’s second stint at Celtic ended on Monday with the club’s major shareholder Dermot Desmond scything down the resigned coach in a statement to supporters.\n“Divisive, misleading, and self-serving”: Desmond did not mince his words to ramp up the stakes in an already dramatic saga, one that took another turn when former boss Martin O’Neill was swiftly parachuted in as interim boss – mere hours after backing Hearts to win the Scottish Premiership on the radio.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps it was the kiss of death. Taking charge of his first Celtic match for 20 years on Wednesday, O’Neill’s side rolled over Falkirk 4-0 as Hearts – seeking to end a 40-year Old Firm grip on the title – dropped points for just the second time this season, drawing 2-2 at struggling St. Mirren.\nThe 73-year-old powered to a 6-2 victory in his first Old Firm as manager back in 2000, but Rangers look to be far sterner opposition under new boss Danny Rohl. The German made it two league wins in a row with a hard-fought 1-0 midweek win at Hibernian, securing the club’s first away clean sheet since December.",
