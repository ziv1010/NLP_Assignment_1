  "body_text": "The deal would surpass Chelsea’s £106 million signing of Enzo Fernandez in 2023, setting a new Premier League transfer benchmark. Isak, 25, was one of the standout performers last season, netting 23 goals in the league - second only to Mohamed Salah - as Newcastle secured Champions League qualification. His form, combined with his desire to move to Merseyside, turned him into Liverpool’s top attacking target.\nIt has been a long running deal with Newcastle initially rejecting a £110 million offer earlier in the summer. However, the Magpies’ record signing of German striker Nick Woltemade for £69 million over the weekend paved the way for negotiations to progress.\nIsak’s immediate arrival adds to Liverpool’s ambitious summer rebuild underlined by big signings such as Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Jeremie Frimpong, and Milos Kerkez. His addition would provide the Liverpool side with another lethal attacking option alongside Salah and Darwin Núñez.\nWith the transfer almost done, Isak is poised to become Liverpool’s most expensive signing ever - and the biggest in English football history.\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily International News Updates.\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily International News Updates.",
