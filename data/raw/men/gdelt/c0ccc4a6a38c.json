  "body_text": "Matheus Nunes: Champions League spot is City’s ‘Premier League trophy’ this term\nBy Simon Peach, PA Chief Football Writer\nMatheus Nunes says Champions League qualification is Manchester City’s “Premier League trophy” right now, but Tuesday’s matchwinner knows a top-five finish and FA Cup glory would not make this season a success.\nPep Guardiola’s previously all-conquering side ended 2024 in a tailspin, leaving them scrambling for a return to European football’s top table rather than competing for an unprecedented fifth straight league title.\nBut City have the chance to the season on a high, with Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest at Wembley coming hot on the heels of Tuesday’s last-gasp win against fellow Champions League contenders Aston Villa.\nNunes proved the difference deep in stoppage time, meeting a classy Jeremy Doku cross with a fine finish to secure a 2-1 victory that takes the reigning champions up to third with four matches to play.\n“I mean, this is our Premier League trophy now to qualify for the Champions League,” the Portugal international said.\n“I think it’s massively important for us, in terms of everything, the club, in terms of the players, the mentality, the way…\n“I think we cannot describe how incredible it’s going to be to be in the Champions League, because now we cannot fight for the Premier League trophy. So that’s our main aim.”\nNunes acknowledged City end the campaign with a “different aim” to what they started with, but their exacting standards remain the same.\nA post shared by Manchester City (@mancity)\nAsked if Champions League qualification and FA Cup glory would represent a successful end to the season, he responded: “I mean, of course not. We know this.\n“The club’s standards are much higher than this. We know that there is not the standards we want this club to be at.\n“But this is our reality now and we have to accept it. And we just have to go for it like it’s the Champions League, the Premier League trophy.\n“Every game now is very important for us. There’s no easy games now until the end of the season.\n“This game was a pure example of how difficult the games can be and Nottingham this season has been specifically like doing an amazing season and we have to be ready for it.”\nThere is a lot riding on the trip to Wembley and City’s end to the campaign, but there appears little chance of Nunes getting caught up in the background noise.\nThe versatile 26-year-old has made 35 appearances in all competitions for Guardiola’s men this season but, unlike his manager, is not obsessed with the game.\nQuizzed on whether he had watched the Champions League quarter-finals thinking he wishes he was there, he responded: “No, I don’t really watch football. I just don’t watch football.”\nNunes says he was more of a Netflix man and finds it better to switch off than constantly think about the game.\n“It’s just because our daily routine is just full of football,” he added. “You know, it’s the same as if you work in a computer and you’re going home, you want to go for the computer.”",
