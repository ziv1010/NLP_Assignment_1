But neither of those will be taking part in the Club World Cup.\nSo, what about the 32 clubs going to the 2025 Club World Cup in the US? Here, TEAMtalk takes a look at the 10 most expensive transfers they’ve agreed in time for the tournament, which kicks off in Miami on June 14 and runs until the final in East Rutherford on July 13.\nNote, we’ve not included any transfers that were pre-agreed before the last transfer window in January, such as Chelsea’s capture of Estevao Willian, nor any players that were already on loan at a club, such as Lloyd Kelly at Juventus.\n10. Arthur Cabral\nFrom: Benfica\nTo: Botafogo\nPosition: Striker\nAge: 27\nFee: £12.6m\nBotafogo have taken Cabral back to his native Brazil after a two-year stint with Benfica for the former Basel and Fiorentina forward.\nSeattle Sounders will be Botafogo’s first opponents in the Club World Cup.\n9. Gabri Veiga\nFrom: Al-Ahli\nTo: Porto\nPosition: Midfielder\nAge: 23\nFee: £12.6m\nVeiga has returned to European football with Porto two years on from leaving Celta Vigo for Al-Ahli.\nCuriously, the midfielder made 50 appearances and scored 11 goals in LaLiga and returned an identical record in the Saudi Pro League.\nPorto kickstart their Club World Cup campaign on June 15 in East Rutherford against Palmeiras.\n8. Dario Essugo\nFrom: Sporting CP\nTo: Chelsea\nPosition: Midfielder\nAge: 20\nFee: £18.5m\nEssugo was partway through a loan spell at Las Palmas from Sporting when Chelsea arranged to sign him in March.\nThe Premier League club have since confirmed the 20-year-old midfielder’s arrival in time for the Club World Cup.\nHe previously gained appearances in the Champions League and Europa League for Sporting.\n7. Luis Henrique\nFrom: Marseille\nTo: Inter Milan\nPosition: Winger\nAge: 23\nFee: £19.4m\nHenrique, 23, completed his move from Marseille to Inter at a cost of €23m.\nThe winger will be playing in Serie A for the first time next season after any duties at the Club World Cup, with Inter commencing their campaign in Pasadena against Monterrey on June 17.\n6. Jobe Bellingham\nFrom: Sunderland\nTo: Borussia Dortmund\nPosition: Midfielder\nAge: 19\nFee: £27m\n💰 Borussia Dortmund have signed Jobe Bellingham for a higher initial fee than they signed his brother Jude for five years ago. pic.twitter.com/kqpQnpwOQq\n— TEAMtalk (@TEAMtalk) June 10, 2025\nBellingham completed his move to Germany on the final day of the pre-Club World Cup transfer window, on the back of a promotion-winning campaign with Sunderland.\n“I’m delighted to now be a Borussia Dortmund player and to be fighting for titles with this great club,” he said. “I want to do my part to celebrate success with these amazing fans here, and I’ll be working on myself and the team every day to achieve this. I’m delighted that I’ll be wearing the black and yellow jersey at the FIFA Club World Cup.”\nDortmund’s first group game is against Fluminense in East Rutherford, a week after Bellingham’s confirmation.\n5. Liam Delap\nFrom: Ipswich Town\nTo: Chelsea\nPosition: Striker\nAge: 22\nFee: £30m\nDelap earned a step up for his career thanks to Chelsea utilising the release clause that became active in his Ipswich Town contract after relegation from the Premier League.\nThe striker was already out on loan from Manchester City when his former club won the 2023 Club World Cup but will be on the international stage with his new club this summer.\nHis debut could theoretically come on June 16 against Los Angeles FC in Atlanta.\n4. Rayan Cherki\nFrom: Lyon\nTo: Manchester City\nPosition: Attacking midfielder\nAge: 21\nFee: £30.5m\nOn the last day of the pre-Club World Cup window, Man City confirmed the capture of Cherki from Lyon, where he had spent his entire career to date. The playmaker has signed a five-year contract at the Etihad Stadium, describing it as a ‘dream’ move.\n“There’s no doubt that he’s now in the best place possible to develop further under Pep’s guidance and I really believe he can become a world-class player with our support and direction,” said director of football, Hugo Viana.\nCity’s Club World Cup opener against Wydad AC is due to take place in Philadelphia on June 18.\n3. Rayan Ait-Nouri\nFrom: Wolves\nTo: Manchester City\nPosition: Left-back\nAge: 24\nFee: £31m\nMan City secured themselves a proven Premier League left-back by signing Ait-Nouri from Wolves for an initial £31m, which could rise above £36m.\nThe Algeria international spent five seasons at Molineux and his move to Man City was announced on June 9.\nAit-Nouri, whose only former side before Wolves was Angers, has never played in the Champions League, Europa League or Conference League before, but will now get the opportunity to showcase his talent on an international stage.\n2. Tijjani Reijnders\nFrom: AC Milan\nTo: Manchester City\nPosition: Midfielder\nAge: 26\nFee: £46.5m\nIt may have taken City until June 11 to announce the arrival of Reijnders, but they confirmed the deal had gone through in time for him to be eligible for the Club World Cup.\nThe Netherlands midfielder cost an initial £46.5m for them to sign from AC Milan. In stark contrast to Ait-Nouri, he has played in all three European competitions before, either for his first club AZ or Milan.\nDescribing it as a ‘dream come true’ to arrive in the Premier League, Reijnders took City above the £100m mark for their total pre-Club World Cup spending.\n1. Dean Huijsen\nFrom: Bournemouth\nTo: Real Madrid\nPosition: Centre-back\nAge: 20\nFee: £50m\nAfter struggling for personnel at centre-back due to injuries in recent seasons, Real Madrid were eager to get Huijsen in time for the Club World Cup.\nBournemouth obliged and allowed the defender to make an early move to Madrid after Real met his £50m release clause.\nThe move marks a return to Spanish football for the former Malaga youngster, who was part of Spain’s starting lineup in the UEFA Nations League final on June 8, just 10 days before Madrid’s opening Club World Cup match against Al Hilal in Miami.\nREAD NEXT: The 25 biggest transfers in the 2025 summer transfer window, ft.
