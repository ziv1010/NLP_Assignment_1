That will be a guarantee,” Bellingham told a press conference previewing the game.\n“But he’s a Liverpool player and it would be disrespectful to come to his home today with a big game [on Wednesday] and talk about something that could be misconstrued so it’s important to take that pressure off him. I want him to do really well normally. Just not [on Wednesday].”\nOn his own move to Los Blancos and of strong speculation linking him with Liverpool, Bellingham commented: “It probably wasn’t as close as a lot of the media made out. I had conversations with a few clubs when leaving Borussia Dortmund and making that decision. They gave me permission to speak to a few clubs.\n“One thing I have to say is all the clubs I spoke to were very respectful of me and my family which was something I really respected.\n“But when Real Madrid come knocking on the door it shakes the whole house. It’s hard not to open and accept. It’s not a matter the other teams weren’t good or were bad when I spoke to them, it’s just that Real Madrid are on a different level.”\nREAD MORE\nBellingham discusses Liverpool season so far; makes England scapegoat claims\nOn his own future at Real, Bellingham added: “A future move to Liverpool? I think the next 10 to 15 years will be in white for me. I’m very happy at Real Madrid.”\nLiverpool have made a whirlwind start to life under new boss Arne Slot, with the Reds winning 16 of their 18 matches so far under the Dutchman.\nThat leaves the Reds top of the Premier League and with a chance to reclaim top spot in the Champions League if they avoid defeat to Real on Wednesday evening.\nBellingham admits to being impressed by the Reds, but insists he is confident that his side can still pick up a positive result, despite their obvious injury issues.\n“It’s clear to see how good a team they are. They have got players who have gone to a new level and some of the more experienced lads have been together a long time. It’ll be a great test and a good game. But I’m still confident.”\nReturning to England for his first game of club football since Borussia Dortmund visited Manchester City two years ago, Bellingham feels he was made a scapegoat by the media following England’s failure to beat Spain in the Euro 2024 final.\n“I’ve got to be honest, I think I lost my smile a lot after the Euros when it came to playing for England because I felt like I was a little bit mistreated in comparison to what I contributed,” he said. “I felt like some of it was a bit harsh on me.\n“I felt I was a bit like the scapegoat. Maybe I was feeling a little bit sorry for myself.\n“Criticism is part of the game and I know how to accept it but when it feels personal it does give you a bit of a new challenge to continue to shut people up.\n“That’s something I’ve dealt with since I was very young, coming into the first team at Birmingham when people aren’t sure you’re ready. You take those little things and you try to use it as motivation.\n“Like I say, it’s not something I’m really worried about. I understand it is part of the game.”\nLatest Liverpool transfer news: Slot discusses Salah contract; Reds links to Vini Jnr\nSlot, meanwhile, has opened up on the form of Mo Salah for the Reds this season in the wake of the Egyptian’s ongoing contract saga at Anfield.\nSome observers feel Salah is in the form of his life so far this season and with 12 goals and 10 assists to his name already, the numbers do certainly back up those claims.\nAs far as Salah replacements go, former Liverpool man Danny Murphy has urged the Reds to break the bank to sign Vinicius Junior, explaining why the Brazilian’s unhappiness at Real Madrid could open the door for a shock move to Anfield for the global superstar.\nAnd finally, Liverpool are said to be roaring towards the signing of Slot’s prime summer target, Martin Zubimendi.\nAmid suggestions the Real Sociedad midfielder has had a change of heart on leaving his hometown club, Liverpool are now said to be confident of beating Arsenal to his signing in the January window in a €60m (£50.1m, $63.1m) deal.",
