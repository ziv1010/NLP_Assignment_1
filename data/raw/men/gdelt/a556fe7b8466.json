I feel embarrassed and ashamed when I see it. I apologised to the cameraman after one second.\n“I am who I am – even (after) 1,000 games I’m not perfect a person. I made a huge mistake. What is for sure I defend my team and my club, that’s for sure.”\nCity return to action as they host Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League on Tuesday.\nMidfielder Rodri remains on the sidelines with a hamstring injury.\nGuardiola said: “Not for tomorrow. Not long – we’re in the process that he will be back, (but) we will wait a little bit more to make sure he’s fine.”",
