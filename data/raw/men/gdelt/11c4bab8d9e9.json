The Gunners are a point clear of defending Premier League champions Liverpool at the top of the Premier League table and have also won their opening two Champions League games, all without having Jesus in their squad.\nThe Brazil international striker has been on the sidelines ever since he suffered an ACL injury against Manchester United back in January.\nDuring his absence, Kai Havertz established himself as the number one striker for Arsenal before the north London club signed Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP in the summer of 2025.\nSigned from Manchester City in the summer of 2022 to lead Arsenal to their first Premier League title since 2004, Gabriel Jesus has flattered to deceive, scoring only 26 goals and providing 20 assists in 96 appearances for the north London outfit.\nThe 28-year-old Brazil international striker’s days at the Emirates Stadium are numbered, with sources telling TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, that Arsenal are willing to sell Jesus and want £30million (€34.4m, $40.4m) for him.\nEverton have been mooted as a possible destination for Jesus, but the Toffees will have to take into consideration the huge salary that the striker is on at Arsenal at the moment.\nREAD NEXT 🔴⚪Arsenal wages: Top 10 highest-paid players after Gyokeres and Eze signings\nBrazilian giants Palmeiras and Flamengo are also monitoring Jesus, with Somo Fanaticos reporting that ‘it’s no secret’ that they are ‘closely monitoring’ the striker’s future.\nHowever, neither Flamengo nor Palmeiras are likely to be ‘willing to invest’ £30m (€34.4m, $40.4m) in Jesus, with Gazeta do Urubu adding that the board of the former ‘believes the amount requested is above Brazilian football’s financial standards’.\nAC Milan stance on signing Gabriel Jesus from Arsenal\nJesus has options in Europe, with AC Milan keen on the Arsenal striker, according to Fichajes.\nThe Spanish news outlet, which is not among the most reliable sources, has claimed that Milan are ‘among the clubs most interested in signing Gabriel Jesus’.\nThe Serie A giants reportedly view the former Man City striker as someone who will ‘add experience and goals to their attack’.\nHowever, paying (€34.4m, $40.4m) for Jesus ‘could strain Milan’s finances’.\nJesus is under contract at Arsenal until the summer of 2027.\nEven if the striker stays at the Emirates Stadium beyond the end of the January transfer window, it is increasingly looking likely that Jesus and Arsenal will part ways for good in the summer of 2026.\nLatest Arsenal news: Martin Odegaard injury update, Real Madrid raid\nWhile Jesus is on his way to recovery, Martin Odegaard faces a spell on the sidelines for Arsenal.\nOdegaard suffered a medial collateral ligament injury to his left knee during Arsenal’s Premier League match against West Ham United.\nA medical expert has given his take on how long Odegaard will be out for Arsenal.\nMeanwhile, Arsenal have been tipped to bid €80million for a Paris Saint-Germain star.\nAnd finally, trusted journalist Fabrizio Romano has named the Real Madrid star that Arsenal are keen on signing.",
