Phil Neal (Liverpool) and Gareth Bale (Real Madrid) are the others.\nBobby Charlton (Manchester United vs Benfica, 1968)\nManchester United beat Benfica 4-1 after extra time in the 1968 European Cup final at Wembley and Bobby Charlton scored two of the goals for Matt Busby's side.\nThe midfielder opened the scoring with a header after 53 minutes and netted the fourth in extra time, converting a pass from Brian Kidd as United became the first English club to win the European Cup.\nGeorge Best (Manchester United vs Benfica, 1968)\nGeorge Best scored the pick of the goals as Manchester United beat Benfica 4-1 after extra time in the 1968 European Cup final at Wembley.\nThe Belfast-born forward intercepted a loose ball in midfield, drove past two Benfica players into the area and fired a low shot into the corner past the advancing goalkeeper to give United the lead early in extra time. With Bobby Charlton (two) and Brian Kidd also on target, all four of United's goals were scored by homegrown players.\nArie Haan (Ajax vs Panathinaikos)\nAjax won the first of three consecutive European Cups in 1971, beating Greek champions Panathinaikos 2-0 in the final at Wembley.\nThe Amsterdam side took the lead through defender Dick van Dijk after five minutes and wrapped up a 2-0 win late in the game thanks to a deflected effort from Arie Haan. The midfielder had joined Ajax for an internship in 1967 from amateur club WVV 1896 and made his debut the following year after impressing for the reserve team.\nJohan Cruyff (Ajax vs Inter, 1972)\nInstrumental in Ajax's run of three successive European Cup victories in the early 1970s, Johan Cruyff scored both goals as the Amsterdam side beat Inter in the 1972 final in Rotterdam.\nCruyff opened the scoring early in the second half by slotting into the empty net after Inter goalkeeper Ivano Bordon had misjudged a cross and the legendary forward made it 2-0 with 12 minutes remaining as he headed home from a corner.\nPatrick Kluivert (Ajax vs AC Milan, 1995)\nPatrick Kluivert came off the bench to score the winner for Ajax against AC Milan in the 1995 Champions League final.\nThe striker received a ball from Frank Rijkaard just outside the area, turned and slotted a low shot inside the post after 85 minutes. Aged 18 years and 327 days at the time, he remains the youngest scorer in a Champions League final.\nLars Ricken (Borussia Dortmund vs Juventus, 1997)\nLars Ricken came off the bench in the second half of the 1997 Champions League final and wrapped up a 3-1 win for Borussia Dortmund over Juventus in Berlin.\nThe 20-year-old midfielder and academy graduate ran onto an Andreas Möller pass and chipped a shot over Angelo Peruzzi from outside the box with his first touch. He had only been on the pitch for 16 seconds and his goal remains the fastest ever scored by a substitute in a European Cup final.\nRaúl (Real Madrid vs Valencia & Bayer Leverkusen, 2000 & 2002)\nRaúl González came through the youth ranks at Atlético Madrid but moved to rivals Real after the Rojiblancos closed their academy to cut costs.\nA couple of years later, the striker made his first-team debut at the age of 17 and he went on to win three Champions League titles with Madrid, scoring in two finals. After running over half the pitch to net a breakaway third goal against Valencia in 2000, Raúl opened the scoring as Madrid beat Bayer Leverkusen two years later as he latched onto a long throw from Roberto Carlos and hit a first-time shot past Hans-Jörg Butt.\nPaolo Maldini (AC Milan vs Liverpool, 2005)\nAC Milan made a dream start in the 2005 Champions League final against Liverpool in Istanbul as captain Paolo Maldini volleyed home from an Andrea Pirlo free-kick in the first minute of the game.\nDespite leading 3-0 at half-time, Milan went on to lose the match on penalties. It was Maldini's third loss in a European Cup final, but he did win the competition five times with the Rossoneri, and lifted the trophy as Milan beat Liverpool in the final two years later.\nSteven Gerrard (Liverpool vs AC Milan, 2005)\nSteven Gerrard was the driving force behind Liverpool's incredible comeback from three goals down to win the 2005 Champions League final against AC Milan in Istanbul.\nWith the Reds trailing 3-0 at the break, Gerrard pulled one back after 54 minutes and won the penalty which was converted by Xabi Alonso following Dida's initial save on the hour. Liverpool went on to win on penalties, with the skipper named Man of the Match.\nLionel Messi (Barcelona vs Manchester United, 2009 & 2011)\nBarcelona beat Manchester United 2-0 to win the Champions League final in May 2009 and complete a treble in Pep Guardiola's first season in charge at the Catalan club.\nSamuel Eto'o opened the scoring early on and Lionel Messi sealed the win with 20 minutes remaining as he rose unchallenged to loop a header over Edwin van der Sar and into the corner from a Xavi cross. The Argentine has often described it as his favourite goal. And two years later, Messi scored a memorable long-range effort as Barça beat United 3-1 in the 2011 final at Wembley.\nPedro (Barcelona vs Manchester United, 2011)\nBarcelona's three forwards bagged a goal apiece in the 2011 Champions League final win over Manchester United at Wembley.\nPedro opened the scoring after 27 minutes as he latched onto a Xavi pass in the area and beat Edwin van der Sar with a low finish inside the post. Lionel Messi and David Villa were also on target as Barça won 3-1.\nThomas Müller (Bayern Munich vs Chelsea, 2012)\nBayern Munich were beaten at home by Chelsea in the 2012 Champions League final, but the Bavarians looked set to win the match after Thomas Müller broke the deadlock in the 83rd minute.\nMúller headed in from a Toni Kroos cross to spark wild celebrations, but Didier Drogba later levelled for Chelsea and the Blues went on to win on penalties at the Allianz Arena.\nDani Carvajal (Real Madrid vs Borussia Dortmund, 2024)\nOne of a handful of Real Madrid players to have won the Champions League six times, Dani Carvajal scored the opening goal for Los Blancos in the 2024 final win against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley.\nThe right-back, who came through the youth ranks at Madrid and returned to the Spanish side after a season with Bayer Leverkusen early in his career, headed home from a Toni Kroos corner to set Real on their way to a 2-0 win at Wembley and a 15th European Cup.\nSenny Mayulu (Paris Saint-Germain vs Inter, 2025)\nSenny Mayulu came off the bench with six minutes remaining in last Saturday's Champions League final, with Paris Saint-Germain already 4-0 up against Inter in Munich.\nMayulu played a one-two with Bradley Barcola and slotted home from a tight angle to spark wild celebrations just a couple of minutes later and became the second-youngest scorer in Champions League final history at 19 years and 14 days of age.\nBen Hayward is a European football writer and Tottenham Hotspur fan with over 15 years’ experience, he has covered games all over the world - including three World Cups, several Champions League finals, Euros, Copa America - and has spent much of that time in Spain.
