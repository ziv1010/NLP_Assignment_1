  "body_text": "Club versus country tensions have surfaced ahead of this summer’s Women’s World Cup after national teams were urged not to summon players for training camps until a FIFA-mandated release date.\nThe European Club Association (ECA) said in a statement that it was concerned about the “current widespread practice” by national federations to call up players early, in breach of mandatory rest periods.\nAdvertisement\nFIFA rules require players in the 32 Women’s World Cup squads to report to national teams on July 10 — 10 days before the start of the month-long tournament in Australia and New Zealand.\nThat deadline for clubs to release their players is more than five weeks after the UEFA Women’s Champions League final on June 3 that caps the European season.\nBut the ECA warning comes after some national teams started camps in May for a July 6 start in European Championship last summer, including by eventual winners England.\nSarina Wiegman’s squad are already planning a final warm-up game in early July, before arriving in Australia on July 7.\nECA head of women’s football, Claire Bloomfield, said the issue was “a serious concern for player welfare.”\n“The issue of early call-ups is a hangover from the game in its amateur form and is detrimental to the future success and growth of women’s football,” she said.\nThe ECA said it would seek to collaborate with FIFA in working with the national associations on not requiring players to report for duty before the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup mandatory release period starts.\nChelsea manager Emma Hayes said she thought there was a “valid argument to sticking to (rest) windows”.\nSpeaking ahead of her side’s Champions League semi-final decider against Barcelona, she said: “We have to reflect on the number of injuries that have taken place in the women’s game and say ultimately the duty of care we have to players.\n“I think there’s a valid argument to sticking to windows. There’s a reason and rationale to those windows because especially in the last three years, players have had so little rest, maybe a couple of weeks at the end of the season. It’s not enough.\n“I can’t speak for this upcoming tournament, I’m not involved in those decisions being made, but I do think that as the women’s game has progressed from the amateur game into the professional game that there have to be more stringent restrictions on player welfare. I respect they want to win their tournaments but we seriously have to look at players having more rest.”\nAdvertisement\nThe Professional Footballers’ Association has previously voiced concerns about the fixture calendar in the women’s game.\nPFA chief executive, Maheta Molango, said: “The continued growth of the women’s game inevitably means more demand for domestic and international competition. Yet the women’s game seems to be repeating the same mistakes as the men’s when it comes to treating the players like robots.\n“A bespoke approach to the women’s calendar is needed with much better co-ordination between the various bodies.”\nThe Athletic has contacted FIFA and the Football Association for comment.\n(Photo: Getty Images)",
