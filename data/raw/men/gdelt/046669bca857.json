Ten Hag's successes were overshadowed by inconsistent performances and tactical struggles. Ruud van Nistelrooy steps in as interim manager, with names like Rúben Amorim, Simone Inzaghi, Gareth Southgate, and Xavi considered for the permanent role.\nRuud van Nistelrooy and Erik ten Hag (Reuters Photo)\nTen Hag, who arrived in 2022 with high expectations following his success at Ajax, won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup during his tenure at the red side of Manchester.\nHowever, inconsistent performances, tactical struggles, and player management issues plagued his time at Old Trafford, resulting in growing discontent among fans and the club hierarchy.\nUnited’s latest 2-1 defeat to West Ham was the final straw, forcing the board to act.\nWith the Premier League giants desperate to return to the top, several high-profile names are being linked with the role.\nHere, we look at the top five candidates most likely to replace Ten Hag and the challenges they could face in taking on one of the most demanding jobs in world\nfootball.\n1) Ruud van Nistelrooy\nHaving been appointed as interim manager, Van Nistelrooy now has the opportunity to make a lasting impression, reminding the fans of the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer days in 2018.\nA legendary striker at Old Trafford, Van Nistelrooy recently coached PSV Eindhoven, where he won the Dutch Cup. However, questions remain about his lack of top-tier managerial experience.\nShould he succeed in lifting team morale and securing results in the short term, United’s board may consider keeping him beyond the interim period.\n2) Rúben Amorim\nRúben Amorim is considered one of the brightest young managers in Europe. He led Sporting Lisbon to their first league title in 19 years and is renowned for his tactical flexibility and ability to nurture young players.\nAlthough relatively inexperienced, Amorim’s success in Portugal and his attacking philosophy align with United's vision.\nSporting’s reluctance to let him go may be a stumbling block, but United’s ambition—and financial resources—could persuade Amorim to make the move.\n3) Simone Inzaghi\nInzaghi has established himself as a reliable coach at Inter Milan, winning multiple trophies, including the Serie A and Coppa Italia titles and bringing them closest to Champions League glory.\nHe guided Inter to the 2023 Champions League final, where they narrowly lost to Manchester City. Known for his tactical discipline, Inzaghi’s teams are defensively solid yet capable of quick transitions.\nIf United seek structure and tactical clarity, the Italian could be the right fit, though adapting his methods to the fast-paced nature of the Premier League might be a challenge.\n4) Gareth Southgate\nThe former England manager has publicly ruled out an immediate return to club football, but United could still offer a tempting proposition.\nSouthgate is celebrated for uniting the England squad and achieving back-to-back major tournament finals, although his lack of success in club management raises doubts.\nSouthgate’s experience with high-pressure situations might appeal to United, but convincing him to abandon his year-long break will be difficult.\nJim Ratcliffe, a long-time admirer of Southgate, could offer a lucrative deal to persuade him to take charge sooner than planned. Alternatively, United might rely on interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy for the rest of the season before bringing Southgate to Old Trafford.\nIf they opt for the latter, the club would likely seek a pre-contract agreement to secure his services, given the Englishman’s popularity and strong interest from other potential suitors.\n5) Xavi\nThe former Barcelona legend is reportedly on United’s radar, with talks said to have taken place already. Xavi's possession-heavy approach and tactical intelligence brought success at the Nou Camp, and he has previously expressed a desire to coach in the Premier League.\n\"I could see myself in England, definitely, it’s one of the things I’d like to experience in my career,\" he once admitted.\nRecently, Xavi's wife, Nuria Cunillera, shared a photo of their son wearing an old Manchester United kit, sparking speculation about the family's connection to the club amid Xavi's links to the Old Trafford job.\nIf United secure Xavi, it could signal a shift toward a long-term rebuild based on youth and possession-based football.\nUnited’s search for Ten Hag’s replacement is already drawing speculation, with other names such as Thomas Frank, Julian Nagelsmann, Graham Potter, Michael Carrick, Zinedine Zidane, Edin Terzic, and even Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also being mentioned.\nWhoever takes over will face the colossal task of steadying the ship at Old Trafford, restoring discipline, and bringing back the attacking identity the fans crave.\nEnd of Article\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\nExplore Every Corner\nUS Election Results",
