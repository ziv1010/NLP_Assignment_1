It’s a crucial period that always tends to shape the title race; it’s too early for teams to win anything, of course, but they can lose touch with the leaders with a run of poor form and drop out of contention.\nAnd that goes for the jostling for the European places, too, and the relegation battle.\nAs players, you always look forward to this part of the season, because you’re playing all the time. You’re not celebrating Christmas like you’re accustomed to, but quickly grow to love it.\nBest of all, the timezone is very friendly to Australia. You can wake up a little early (but not too early) and smash some Christmas leftovers for breakfast, watch cricket all day, then squeeze in some A-League, and stay up to watch more Premier League at night. If you need to, you can always take a nap, which you’ll probably end up doing anyway, depending on how much you’ve eaten.\nWhat more could you want?\nTo save you the trouble, I’ve had a look through the schedule and picked out the best games to watch.\nNewcastle v Chelsea (Saturday, December 20 – 11.30pm AEDT)\nThis is a massive one, straight away.\nBoth of these sides are in the Champions League, but they’ve having very different seasons. Chelsea are flying in the league, while Newcastle haven’t quite hit the same heights domestically, though they’ve arguably looked better in Europe.\nGoing to St James’ Park is never easy, and during this Christmas period it becomes trickier. Newcastle at home, with that crowd, is one of the most hostile environments in English football.\nChelsea come into it with confidence, fresh off their League Cup semi-final qualification, but this is a real test of how solid they are away from home, against a team that knows how to raise its level on the big occasions.\nTottenham v Liverpool (Sunday, December 21 – 4.30am AEDT)\nTottenham are going through a tough spell. Thomas Frank needs to be careful it doesn’t turn into something bigger. The pressure comes quickly at a club like Spurs. Frank has never managed a club this big before, he’s inherited a team that plays differently to the way he coaches, and there seems to be some unhappiness behind the scenes, not to mention in the stands. Tottenham’s home record is really poor, they don’t seem to play well in front of their own fans, who have high expectations.\nLiverpool, on the other hand, look like they’ve come out the other side of their poor run. There’s been plenty of noise around Mohamed Salah recently, and now he’s gone away with Egypt for a month (to the Africa Cup of Nations), which makes this even more fascinating.\nThe big question for me is how Arne Slot sets Liverpool up without him. So far, they’ve reacted very well, but this is a proper examination against a team that, if they turn up the right way, can be a real challenge. It’s a danger game for Spurs, but it’s also a statement opportunity for Liverpool.\nAston Villa v Manchester United (Monday, December 22 – 3.30am AEDT)\nAston Villa are right in the title conversation at the moment, but whether they truly belong there is going to be answered over Christmas.\nManchester United, regardless of form, are always a massive fixture for Villa. But for Unai Emery’s side, this is about backing up what they’ve done so far. After this, they’ve got Chelsea and Arsenal, both away. That run will tell us everything.\nIf Villa are serious, they need to come through this period still standing.\nChelsea v Aston Villa (Sunday, December 28 – 4.30am AEDT)\nAs I just mentioned, this game looms large because of everything that comes before it.\nBy the time this kicks off, we’ll have a much clearer picture of where both teams are really at.\nChristmas football is all about momentum, and this fixture could be defined entirely by what happens in the days leading up to it. Win the earlier games, and this becomes a chance to land a serious blow for either side. Lose, and the pressure ramps up fast.\nArsenal v Aston Villa (New Year’s Eve – 7.15am AEDT)\nSorry to be so lopsided with one of my former clubs, but this one also has huge implications at the top end of the table.\nArsenal have had a few little flutters recently - nothing dramatic, but enough to make you wonder if a bit of doubt is starting to creep in. They lost to Villa last week and needed a last-minute winner against Wolves, relying on own goals to get past a side that hasn’t won this year.\nEvery team has a rough patch during a season. The key is stopping it quickly. Arsenal need to get back on a winning track, and they need to do it soon.\nFor Villa, if they want to be taken seriously as title contenders, these are the games where you prove it.\nManchester City v Chelsea (Monday, January 5 – 4.30am AEDT)\nThis one fascinates me.\nManchester City are travelling along very nicely, and quietly. That’s what makes them dangerous. While the headlines have focused on Liverpool’s struggles, Arsenal’s rise and Villa’s resurgence, the spotlight has drifted away from City a little. That suits them perfectly.\nThey’ve made a lot of changes this season, and you could argue they’re in something of a rebuild. But they’re still right there in the mix, and still very capable of pouncing if others slip.\nBy the time this is played, the table could look very different. Chelsea also have a decent record at the Etihad, and there’s an added subplot too: the master versus the apprentice, with Enzo Maresca coming up against his former mentor.\nPremier League Festive Fixtures. 40 matches in 17 days. Live & exclusive with 4K on Stan Sport. Kicks off Saturday 20 December.",
