  "body_text": "Mikel Arteta has shed light on Arsenal’s progress, transfer strategy and player development in a wide-ranging interview with MARCA ahead of their Champions League clash with Atletico Madrid.\nThe Spaniard discussed the mounting expectations around his side’s form and the importance of maintaining perspective through a long campaign. “We take that pressure naturally,” Arteta said. “We’ve created high expectations through our work, and that’s part of elite football. What matters is being ready when April or May comes.”\nArteta, who has overseen consecutive 2-0 wins over Athletic Bilbao and Olympiacos in the Champions League, expressed confidence that Arsenal are building the right foundation to compete consistently at the highest level.\nHe credited the club’s summer recruitment with strengthening areas that had previously been lacking. “We learned from the past,” he explained. “We added profiles we didn’t have and needed.”\nOn Viktor Gyokeres, whose scoring form has slowed in recent weeks, Arteta struck a composed tone. “This is football,” he said.”I told Viktor the number nine I wanted was someone who could sustain himself mentally when he went six or eight games without scoring. If not, you’re not good enough for this level.”\nThe Arsenal boss also spoke about his admiration for Atletico manager Diego Simeone, calling his longevity and consistency remarkable. “What he’s done at the club and the way he’s done it is impressive,” Arteta said.\n“He’s sustained it over time, which speaks to someone who demands enormously of himself. Atletico is what he is, and that’s very difficult to achieve.”\nWhile their tactical approaches differ, Arteta dismissed suggestions of a philosophical divide between the two. “In many of the things we both experience as coaches, not so closely tied to the game, we’re very close — closer than it seems.”\nHe also touched on the adaptation of summer signing Martin Zubimendi, who has quickly established himself in Arsenal’s midfield. “He has adapted exceptionally well,” Arteta said. “It’s down to his intelligence and the environment around him.”\nArteta concluded by emphasising the need for balance and maturity within the squad, particularly as they continue to compete on multiple fronts this season.\nWith the team evolving both mentally and tactically, he believes Arsenal are well placed to handle the challenges ahead — beginning with tonight’s test against Atletico Madrid.",
