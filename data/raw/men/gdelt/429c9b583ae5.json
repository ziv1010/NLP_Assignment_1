However, Porto have stood firm on their valuation, pointing all interested clubs to his €100m (£86m) release clause.\nHowever, reports from Spain suggest that Tottenham are now willing to pay that amount to bring the prolific frontman to north London in 2026, with an offer having already been tabled.\nBut here comes the warning shot Spurs fans. The report comes from dubious Spanish outlet Fichajes.net, who are renowned for taking a bit of a punt with their transfer news.\nThat’s not to say that it can’t happen, although it’s also unclear as to whether any offer will be accepted in January or will have to wait until the summer.\nYou could, however, argue that Frank needs a new No.9 on board as quickly as possible, with his job now potentially on the line after initially making a bright start to life in north London.\nWant more breaking transfer lines from original sources?

However, we understand that a move to England could well be on the cards for the French talent.\nIndeed, we can reveal that in recent weeks a number of sides, including Tottenham, have been paying close attention to his displays.\nThomas Frank is keen to add more competition for starting pair Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero, especially given continued Roma links with Radu Dragusin, who has only just returned to action following his ACL injury.",
