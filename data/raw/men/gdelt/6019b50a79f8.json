  "body_text": "Top 10 most expensive transfers between Premier League clubs: Mbeumo, Eze both break in\nWith two new entries from the summer 2025 transfer window, TEAMtalk takes a look at the 10 most expensive signings made between Premier League clubs.\nRules over financial fair play continue to have an impact on the transfer market, but there’s still plenty of money splashed out for some top talent as Premier League rivals go head-to-head in the market.\nTo that end, TT has decided to have a run through the current top 10 list of signings made between top-flight English clubs, with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United signings all featuring.\nSo here’s the top 10 countdown in reverse order…\n10. Kai Havertz\n- From: Chelsea\n- To: Arsenal\n- Year: 2023\n- Fee: £65m\nArsenal’s shock swoop for Havertz certainly raised some eyebrows when he moved across London to The Emirates in the summer of 2023.\nThe Germany international mostly struggled at Stamford Bridge, scoring 32 goals in 139 games for Chelsea before Mikel Arteta clearly saw something in the player that intrigued him.\nThat intuition has largely worked out for the Gunners boss, with Havertz notching 14 times in 51 outings in his first term as he made big improvements as the season moved on.\nHe followed it up with 15 goals from 36 appearances in 2024-25, but Arsenal went on to sign a new central striker in the shape of Viktor Gyokeres.\n9. Eberechi Eze\n- From: Crystal Palace\n- To: Arsenal\n- Year: 2025\n- Fee: £67.5m\nEze stepped up from the Championship to the Premier League in 2020 to join Crystal Palace from QPR and went on to earn five years of experience there.\nFor his next step, Eze has moved to Arsenal in a deal worth £60m rising to £67.5m – the initial fee being more than three times what Palace signed him for half a decade before.\nWith 11 England caps to his name by the time of his transfer, Eze would be hoping to make an impact in his upgraded surroundings, especially in a World Cup year.\n8. Wesley Fofana\n- From: Leicester\n- To: Chelsea\n- Year: 2022\n- Fee: £70m\nA forgotten man at Stamford Bridge due to his misfortune with injuries, Fofana has only featured 34 times since signing from the Foxes back in the summer of 2022.\nThe 24-year-old has had two serious knee injuries since the move and did not play at all in 2023-24, despite being cleared to resume training in late 2023.\nFofana remains a player with tremendous potential though and made 14 appearances under new boss Enzo Maresca in 2024-25.\n7. Bryan Mbeumo\n- From: Brentford\n- To: Manchester United\n- Year: 2025\n- Fee: £71m\nA second addition to this top 10 from the summer 2025 transfer window by Man Utd, Mbeumo moved from Brentford, a club he initially helped win promotion from the Championship.\nMbeumo stood the test of time as a key player in helping consolidate Brentford in the Premier League, scoring 20 goals in the season directly before his move to Man Utd.\nThe attacker signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford with the option of an extra year.\n6. Virgil van Dijk\n- From: Southampton\n- To: Liverpool\n- Year: 2018\n- Fee: £75m\nOne of the best signings in Premier League history and a player who helped transform Liverpool from contenders under Jurgen Klopp to Premier League and Champions League winners.\nVan Dijk’s price tag looks an absolute snip when you consider the sheer impact he has had on the club since arriving on Merseyside in 2018.\nThe 33-year-old is perhaps not quite the same force he was before he suffered an ACL injury back in 2020, but he remains one of the top central defenders and leaders in the English game and captained Liverpool to a second Premier League title in 2024-25.\n5. Romelu Lukaku\n- From: Everton\n- To: Manchester United\n- Year: 2017\n- Fee: £75m\nLukaku’s cumulative transfer fees total more than £300m, with United forking out £75m of that figure to take him from Goodison Park back in 2017.\nThe Belgium international ended up scoring 42 goals in 96 games for the Red Devils – the sort of stats many top-level strikers would be happy with. However, United got back not far off what they paid out when the sold the frontman to Inter Milan just two years later.\nSince then Lukaku has returned to Chelsea and had loan spells back at Inter and Roma, before being sold to Napoli in 2024 to reunite with Antonio Conte and become a Serie A champion again.\n4. Harry Maguire\n- From: Leicester\n- To: Manchester United\n- Year: 2019\n- Fee: £80m\nA player who was once a solid foundation piece for United to build from after a huge £80m spend, Maguire has had a rollercoaster of a career at Old Trafford.\nMaguire was stripped of the captaincy before the start of the 2023-24 season and only featured 31 times in all competitions, although injury issues also played a part in those numbers.\nThe 32-year-old also failed to recover from injury to make England’s Euro 2024 squad, but has managed to claw back some importance for his club, making 40 appearances in 2024-25.\n3. Declan Rice\n- From: West Ham\n- To: Arsenal\n- Year: 2023\n- Fee: £105m\nWhat a signing the England man has turned out to be for the Gunners after his big-money move across London.\nRice transitioned from a defensive midfielder into a box-to-box No.8 at The Emirates and was one of the players of the season in the 2023-24 Premier League, taking his game to another level.\nHe continued his strong form in 2024-25, even though Arsenal fell short in the title race again.\nAt 26 years of age and entering his prime, Rice has the ability and drive to become one of the best midfielders in world football, particularly if he continues his current rate of progress under Arteta.\n2. Jack Grealish\n- From: Aston Villa\n- To: Manchester City\n- Year: 2021\n- Fee: £105.75m\nThe City attacker clings on to that record of being the most expensive British player in Premier League history and the biggest transfer between top-flight sides.\nHowever, it’s been a real mixed bag for the former Villa man at The Etihad, where he has contributed to a hat-trick of Premier League titles as well as a Champions League since 2021.\nThe season after the treble win saw a real drop off in his performance levels though, as he scored just three goals and adding three assists in 36 games in all competitions. He then only managed one Premier League goal in 2024-25 to put his City future at real risk.\nGrealish’s struggles led to him being dropped from the England squad for Euro 2024 and he has since signed on loan for Everton.\n1. Moises Caicedo\n- From: Brighton\n- To: Chelsea\n- Year: 2023\n- Fee: £115m\nWhile Chelsea may have expected more from Caicedo in his first season at the club, although he got better as it wore on, he stood out head and shoulders above his colleagues in his second.\nHis partnership with Enzo Fernandez began to look like a dynamite combination late in the 2023-24 season when the Blues finished the campaign in style.\nCaicedo, still only 23, went from strength to strength in 2024-25 under Enzo Maresca, elected as Chelsea’s best player of the season as they secured Champions League qualification.",
