And for good measure, he went on to add a late fourth, too.\nRoger Hunt v West Ham United, September 1965\nTime taken: Nine minutes\nLiverpool would end 1965-66 as First Division champions for the second time in three seasons under Bill Shankly, with the great Roger Hunt weighing in with 29 league goals.\nThree of Hunt’s impressive tally arrived in the space of just nine minutes as Shankly’s side ran out comprehensive 5-1 victors over West Ham United at Upton Park in their fifth game of the campaign.\nThe Reds led 2-0 when Hunt added goals three and four in the late stages of the first half, before completing his hat-trick soon after the restart.\nJack Balmer v Derby County, November 1946\nTime taken: Seven minutes\nScouser Jack Balmer scored 110 goals in 309 appearances for Liverpool – and, incredibly, three of them arrived in a seven-minute burst in a 4-1 win at Derby County in November 1946.\nThe Reds were en route to being crowned champions but this match remained goalless with 43 minutes on the clock at the Baseball Ground.\nBy the 50th minute, though, Balmer had netted three times – and, by the hour, he had his fourth goal of the afternoon, too.\nMohamed Salah v Rangers, October 2022\nTime taken: Six minutes and 12 seconds\nSince joining Liverpool in the summer of 2017, Mohamed Salah has normalised the abnormal when it comes to goalscoring.\nAnd among the Egyptian’s vast collection of records and landmarks is the quickest hat-trick in Champions League history.\nIt took Salah just six minutes and 12 seconds to notch on three occasions after he’d been brought off the bench in a 7-1 Champions League win over Rangers at Ibrox in October 2022.\nFirst, he shrugged off a defender and squeezed the ball home from a tight angle, then he produced an improvised toe-poke from the edge of the area, and then he dispatched a trademark curler into the corner.\nYou have to accept cookies in order to view this content on our site.\nWatch on YouTubeJohnny Wheeler v Port Vale, November 1956\nTime taken: Five minutes\nAfter the legendary Billy Liddell had put Liverpool ahead in this Second Division clash with Port Vale, Johnny Wheeler took centre stage.\nThe Crosby-born midfielder scored 23 goals for the Reds and, remarkably, that tally includes a five-minute hat-trick, which was completed in the closing stages of a 4-1 victory at Anfield.\nRobbie Fowler v Arsenal, August 1994\nTime taken: Four minutes and 33 seconds\nThirty years on, it still defies logic and reason – but yes, Fowler really did score a hat-trick in just four minutes and 33 seconds.\nThat he did so at the age of 19 and against an Arsenal team containing the likes of David Seaman and Tony Adams only adds to the mystique of a scarcely believable achievement.\nStarting in 1994-95, Fowler topped 30 goals in three consecutive seasons and here, in the late-summer sunshine at Anfield, he opened the scoring in the 26th minute via a close-range finish.\nThe second came when he beat Seaman with a precise left-footed hit and history was made when he converted a third moments later.\nFowler’s stood as the fastest Premier League hat-trick for nearly 21 years until Sadio Mane, then of Southampton, bettered it in 2015.",
