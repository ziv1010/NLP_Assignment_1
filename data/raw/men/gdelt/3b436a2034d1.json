I thought it was going to go to penalties but we won.\n\"Credit to Arsenal, they've been through a lot as a team but they made it super hard. At the end they could have won - we could have won. We were the lucky ones.\"\nMissed opportunities as Arsenal create plenty of chances\nThere were several moments in the game which proved decisive.\nVAR played its part - not awarding Wolfsburg a penalty in the opening few minutes, ruling out Blackstenius' goal after the restart and taking a long time to confirm Beattie's header late on.\nArsenal missed some big chances in extra time to put the game to bed as Lina Hurtig was denied by goalkeeper Merle Frohms with a first-time strike from close range and Frida Maanum struck over the bar after being played in.\nWolfsburg's Bremer should have scored but lashed the ball wide after it fell kindly for her in the six-yard area - but she later made up for it.\nArsenal winger Katie McCabe also clipped the crossbar when her pull-back floated over the head of goalkeeper Frohms.\nManager Jonas Eidevall will be disappointed Arsenal lacked a clinical touch, but having lost captain Kim Little, key defender Leah Williamson and in-form striker Caitlin Foord in recent weeks, it was always a tall order for the Gunners to reach the final.\nThey were dealt another injury blow during the game as substitute Laura Wienroither lasted 18 minutes before going down in pain off the ball and being stretchered off.\n\"We have a lot more to give. This will give us a lot of confidence,\" said Arsenal striker Blackstenius. \"Now we know what we really can achieve with this team.\n\"Considering how much we have gone through this season, to be able to play a game like this and go this close to a Champions League final - I know we can do this next season.\"",
