Manchester City, Arsenal, Tottenham as well as Liverpool have shown interest in signing the attacker.\nWith new Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso favouring other players over Rodrygo, the Brazilian might soon make a decision on his future.\nThere are encouraging signs about Rodrygo’s potential move to Anfield but as per the report, it all depends on what happens with Liverpool’s pursuit of Isak.\nAlexander Isak is still their number one target\nThey want to sign the Newcastle man before the transfer deadline and only if they fail to sign him, will they pursue a move for Rodrygo.\nNaturally, Alisson would have good things to say about his time in the Merseyside. The experienced Brazilian goalkeeper has been part of two Premier League title winning teams at Anfield as well as a Champions League winning team.\nHe remains a popular figure in the dressing room at Anfield and if needed, he could play a crucial role in bringing Rodrygo to the club.\nReport: Club chairman now wants to sell key player to Liverpool before window closes",
