Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘With young players, most of the time you can be a little bit worried because if they play one or two games well and they score, they think that they are already top players,’ said the Italian.\n‘The good thing about Estevao is that we don’t need to be worried about that. He’s very humble, he’s very polite, he wants to work hard. He also has a fantastic family; they are very close to him.\n‘For me, personally, he’s fantastic because he’s a special player, but you don’t have to be worried.’\nChelsea hero Joe Cole is also a big fan of the talented youngster, comparing him to Brazil’s all-time record goal-scorer.\n‘He’s such a good watch,’ Cole told TNT Sports. ‘Every time I watch him, he gives me Neymar vibes.\n‘He goes both ways. He’s got brilliant balance. He gets the crowd on their feet and he’s a player you love watching.’\nMore Trending\nMaresca also compared him to another player, saying Estevao reminds him of the Brazilian’s Chelsea teammate Cole Palmer.\n‘For me he is very similar to Cole Palmer, who I had at a very similar age at Man City,’ Maresca said.\n‘Cole started to play wide because he needed to build his physicality and now he is playing inside.\n‘With Estevao, they are quite similar. Now he is playing wide but in the future I think he is more of an inside player.’\nMORE: Former Premier League star George Baldock left huge fortune for baby son after tragic death\nMORE: ‘He’s been villainised’ – Peter Crouch condemns ‘unacceptable’ abuse of Man Utd star\nMORE: David Seaman makes Viktor Gyokeres prediction after double for Arsenal against Atletico Madrid",
