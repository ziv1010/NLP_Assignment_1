(Photo by LLUIS GENE / AFP)\nBarcelona: Barcelona and Inter Milan shared a compelling 3-3 draw in a high-octane Champions League semi-final first leg clash on Wednesday.\nThe Italian side raced into a two-goal lead with superb strikes from Marcus Thuram and Denzel Dumfries, before the unstoppable Lamine Yamal pulled Barca back into it with a sublime solo effort.\nBarcelona's Spanish forward #19 Lamine Yamal fights for the ball with Inter Milan's Italian defender #95 Alessandro Bastoni during the UEFA Champions League semi final first leg football match between FC Barcelona and Inter Milan at the Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys in Barcelona on April 30, 2025.

(Photo by LLUIS GENE / AFP)\nQuadruple-chasing Barcelona seized control and pushed forward, roared on by a nervous 50,000 strong Olympic stadium crowd.\nYamal, on his 100th Barcelona appearance, appealed for a penalty after he was shoved by Alessandro Bastoni and then set up Torres, who fired wide.\nThe Spaniard, standing in for Barca's injured top goalscorer Robert Lewandowski, lashed a volley narrowly off target.\nAgainst the run of play Inter, whose treble hopes crumbled after three consecutive domestic defeats prior, scored their second, with another fine finish.\nFrancesco Acerbi nodded on a corner and Dumfries reached the dropping ball first to score with a stunning acrobatic effort.\nBarcelona teams over the past few years may have crumbled but Hansi Flick's youthful side are not burdened by the series of European failures since they last won the competition in 2015.\nLeast of all teenage wizard Yamal, who pulled Barcelona back into the game just three minutes later with a wonderful individual goal that made him the youngest player ever to score in the semis.\nOn the eve of the game the Spaniard rejected comparisons to all-time Barca great Lionel Messi, but his goal was straight from the Argentine's playbook.\nYamal shook off Thuram, floated inside from the right flank and past Henrikh Mkhitaryan into the box, drawing defenders towards him but before they could stop him, stroked an inch-perfect shot in off the left post.\nMinutes later Yamal nearly repeated the trick. This time he darted outside, pausing to let Federico Dimarco lunge past him and off the pitch.\nFrom a tight angle the youngster flashed a shot that Sommer tipped onto the crossbar.\nBreathless battle\nHigh on confidence Yamal set up further chances for Torres and Dani Olmo that went begging, before Barca pulled level.\nPedri hooked a ball into the area for Raphinha to head across goal and Torres to convert from close range after 38 breathless minutes.\nKounde limped off before half-time in a blow for Barca, who also replaced the inexperienced Gerard Martin with Ronald Araujo at the break.\nDimarco hammered over early in the second half before Simone Inzaghi hooked him, after a torrid night up against the relentless Yamal.\nInter took the sting out of the game early in the second half and then sucker-punched Barca, scoring from another corner, with Dumfries' header bouncing in off Olmo.\nBarcelona equalised within two minutes, with Yamal stepping over a corner on the edge of the box, allowing it to run to Raphinha.\nThe Brazilian's rasping effort smashed against the crossbar and then in, off the back of the unfortunate diving Sommer's head.\nPau Cubarsi made a vital recovery tackle to stop Thuram after he got in behind Barcelona's high line, and Mkhitaryan had a goal ruled out for an extremely tight offside.\nYamal looped a second strike onto the crossbar late on but the sides could not be separated.\nThe second leg takes place in Milan next Tuesday, with the winner to face Paris Saint-Germain or Arsenal on May 31 in the Munich final.\n-\nStrong winds, blowing dust forecast from Sunday: Qatar Meteorology\n-\nMandarin Oriental, Doha celebrates dual five-star recognition at Forbes Travel Guide 2026 Star Awards\n-\nMinistry of Municipality launches 34 e-services for livestock sector\n-\nAl Attiyah, McInnes top times on Jordan Baja Prologue\n-\n‘Stability offers investment confidence as Qatar poised for further growth’",
