  "body_text": "Injury concerns weigh on 2024 UEFA Champions League finalist Borussia Dortmund ahead of its 2025-26 league season opener against St. Pauli this Saturday evening.\nBack and Yellow coach Niko Kovac is trying to figure out the suitable starting lineup, while dealing with several sidelined defenders.\nGerrit Holtmann (R) of VfL Bochum vies with Julien Duranville of Borussia Dortmund during the German first division Bundesliga football match between VfL Bochum and Borussia Dortmund in Bochum, Germany, Feb. 15, 2025. (Photo by Joachim Bywaletz/Xinhua)\nDue to the increasing list of losses, the club is reportedly changing its transfer plans, with sporting director Sebastian Kehl closely reviewing new arrivals for the back line.\nWith Waldemar Anton and Ramy Bensebaini as the only two regulars available, players like Nico Schlotterbeck, Niklas Sule, Yan Couto, Julian Ryerson, and Emre Can are all battling injuries.\nWhile former Bayern coach and media pundit Felix Magath named BVB as the \"only rival that can challenge Bayern on their way to the 2025-26 title,\" 53-year-old Kovac is hesitant to make predictions.\nMedia reports suggest that only 14 players are likely to make the first flight to meet both domestic and international ambitions. However, behind the scenes, Kovac is demanding additional arrivals to fill the gaps. Although reports mention a total of 18 players on his list, the club's budget appears to allow for only one or two new signings, as they must stay within a 30 million euro spending limit.\nAchieving consistency appears to be the coach's biggest challenge, especially given Dortmund's struggle for stability since the departure of legendary coach Jurgen Klopp to Liverpool.\nOnly a few players, such as Swiss international goalkeeper Gregor Kobel and French striker Serhou Guirassy, seem to reach the highest performance levels this season.\nMuch of Dortmund's hopes depend on Guirassy and Jobe Bellingham, the brother of Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham.\n\"I expect the BVB to challenge Bayern if Kovac can work without internal pressure,\" Magath said. That might include new arrivals, the 1983 Champions League winner said.\nBeyond the league, Dortmund aims to advance beyond last season's last-minute Champions League qualification, targeting a top-eight finish in Europe.\nThe budget constraints make it hard for the sporting director Kehl, who said, \"we will do something within the borders of our budget.\"\nAfter the tough 1-0 win in the first round of the German Cup against third-division side Essen, Kehl acknowledged a long and challenging season ahead.\nSuccess in the Champions League seems inevitable if they are to rebuild the squad that still resembles last season's team, including familiar but critical performance fluctuations.\nGerman international Karim Adeyemi was benched during the Cup match, and Kovac indicated they will stick with the same lineup for the upcoming games to establish rhythm. Additionally, midfielder Julian Brandt risks losing his starting spot as the season progresses.",
