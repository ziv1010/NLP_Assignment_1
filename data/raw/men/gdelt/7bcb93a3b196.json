  "body_text": "NEW DELHI, Dec. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has banned a premier Indian football club Mohun Bagan Super Giant for two-seasons (up to the 2027-28) for refusing to travel to Iran for an Asian Champions League (ACL) Two clash with Sepahan SC in September.\nThe decision was taken at the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Committee meeting held on Wednesday.\nThe committee of the Asian soccer body, found Mohun Bagan Super Giant guilty of breaching Article 5 (Withdrawal from the Competition) of the ACL Two Competition Regulations after failing to fulfill a fixture once the group stage had already commenced.\nAs part of the disciplinary action, Mohun Bagan Super Giant has been disqualified from participating in the next AFC club football competition for which they would otherwise qualify, with the ban remaining in force up to and including the 2027-28 season.\nThe club has also been fined 50,000 U.S. dollars for withdrawing from the group stage and ordered to pay another 50,729 U.S. dollars as compensation to Sepahan SC and the AFC for damages and losses. In addition, the club must return the 300,000 U.S. dollars participation fee if it has already been disbursed.\nThis was the second consecutive season in which Mohun Bagan Super Giant declined to travel to Iran for an ACL Two fixture, having previously refused an away match against Tractor SC, which resulted in a disqualification but not any sanctions at the time.\nMohun Bagan Super Giant, which has some foreign players in its team, has withdrawn from the competition after they refused to travel to Iran for the group stage match, citing a lack of security assurances and medical insurance coverage there.\nReports said Mohun Bagan Super Giant is considering appealing against the suspension. ■",
