But given Gundogan is 34, any fee received is likely to be a nominal one anyway.\nBiggest deadline day developments\n📌 Man Utd made shock late move for £34m midfielder in final throw of the dice\n📌 Arsenal complete FIVE deals in deadline day splurge as Piero Hincapie signs\n📌 What Tottenham can expect from Randal Kolo Muani and permanent signing chances rated\n📌 Real reason Marc Guehi transfer to Liverpool collapsed and what happens next",
