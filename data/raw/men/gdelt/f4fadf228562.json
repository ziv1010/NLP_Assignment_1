Three uninspired performances in the group stage did see England qualify with relative ease, but just showing up won't be enough in the cut-throat arena of knockout football. Gareth Southgate's side must improve swiftly.\nEngland's journey to the last 16 has been largely drama-free, especially when it comes to controversies surrounding the officials. As a whole, Euro 2024 has been well managed by referees, and the Three Lions won't want that to change at Veltins-Arena on Sunday.\nHere is everything you need to know about the man with the whistle during England's battle with Slovakia.\nWho will referee England vs Slovakia at Euro 2024?\nThe man in charge of England's first knockout match at Euro 2024 is Umut Meler from Turkey. The 37-year-old has already taken charge of two matches at the tournament, including Slovakia's surprising 1-0 win over Belgium.\nThere was some controversy in that meeting between Belgium and England's upcoming opponents, with Romelu Lukaku's late equaliser being ruled out after Meler's intervention. While technically the correct decision - Lois Openda handling the ball in the build-up - it was a harsh call.\nMeler's assistants for England vs Slovakia, Emre Eyisoy and Kerem Ersoy, are also from Turkey. However, chief VAR Marco Fritz is from Germany, while fourth official Rade Obrenovic is from Slovenia.\nHow experienced is Umut Meler?\nMeler is not the most experienced referee to have taken charge of an England game this tournament, with officials for previous matches having taken charge of Champions League finals in the case of Clement Turpin and Daniele Orsato. Comparatively, the biggest game officiated by Meler is the Turkish Cup final during the 2021/22 season.\nMeler is a newer face within the cohort of top UEFA officials, meaning he hasn't quite had the same exposure to big events. He has just ten Champions League matches under his belt and this is his first trip to a major international tournament.\nMeler may be a familiar name to some. The Turkish official was punched by Ankaragucu president Faruk Koca after a Super Lig match in December 2023 and subsequently kicked in the head while laying prone on the floor.\nHas Umut Meler ever refereed of England before?\nThe short answer is no, Meler has never taken charge of an England game. Well, not for the senior team at least. He did referee an England under-17 match against Argentina at the European Championship in 2018.\nMeler has also taken charge of matches involving English clubs before, with Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, West Ham United and Leicester City having all been involved in games overseen by the Turkish referee.",
