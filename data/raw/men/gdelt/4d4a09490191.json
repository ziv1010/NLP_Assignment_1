  "body_text": "“We depend on him and will not achieve any of our objectives without him. If Aubameyang is in top form, we are confident of scoring goals at any given moment” — Thomas Tuchel, September 2022\nWhen the Champions League round-of-16 draw was made in November, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hoped for a more satisfying reunion with former club Borussia Dortmund than the one he had come to Chelsea to enjoy with Thomas Tuchel, who had been his head coach at the German side.\nAdvertisement\nThat partnership, renewed by a £12million ($14.6m) move from Barcelona on the final day of last summer’s transfer window, lasted just 59 frustrating minutes in a 1-0 away defeat against Dinamo Zagreb before Tuchel was ruthlessly sacked by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, Chelsea’s new co-owners.\nRemarkably, now that it’s here, the Dortmund tie will be even worse for Aubameyang.\nNo longer registered in Tuchel replacement Graham Potter’s 25-man Champions League squad list, he could be forgiven for avoiding both legs of an encounter that could prove Chelsea’s final meaningful football of a miserable season, against a club for whom he scored 98 goals in 144 Bundesliga appearances at a rate of one every 116 minutes.\nAubameyang did just that shortly after being informed of his fate by Potter at Cobham earlier this month. He was granted permission to fly to Milan with friends rather than make himself available for the Premier League visit of neighbours Fulham to Stamford Bridge where, not for the first time this season, Chelsea missed his clinical touch in a goalless draw.\nAfter the Fulham game, Potter insisted that he was ultimately the one who decided Aubameyang must be the player to make way for January signings Joao Felix, Mykhailo Mudryk and Enzo Fernandez.\nThe 33-year-old was shocked to be cut from the Champions League squad rather than a currently-injured Christian Pulisic or Hakim Ziyech, who would be a Paris Saint-Germain player today if technical and administrative errors had not scuppered a deadline-day loan move a couple of weeks ago.\nChelsea’s owners were less than universally enthusiastic about signing Aubameyang in the first place.\nHe did not fit the desired transfer profile in terms of age or salary expectations and there was a feeling that bringing him in would represent one gift too many for Tuchel. Now it is very difficult to ignore the impression that the club are actively trying to force Aubameyang out, preferably sooner rather than later.\nAdvertisement\nThis is the context for recent talks with MLS champions Los Angeles FC, who would like to take Aubameyang on loan for the remainder of the European season to temporarily fill the superstar void created by Gareth Bale’s recent retirement. It would also be a convenient workaround for Chelsea, removing a large salary from the wage bill until a more permanent solution can be found in the summer.\nBarcelona have expressed interest in taking Aubameyang back, and Atletico Madrid and AC Milan, another of the striker’s former clubs, are also monitoring his situation. There has been an enquiry from Aston Villa, now led by his former Arsenal head coach Unai Emery.\nNone of those options were on the table for January, however. FIFA rules prohibit him from representing more than two clubs in a single season, and the Spanish football federation (RFEF), which runs La Liga, would not allow Barcelona to re-register their former striker before the summer.\nThe February-to-November format of an MLS season makes LAFC the most viable immediate escape route. There is only one problem: he is against it.\nA mooted move to California holds little appeal for Aubameyang, for several reasons. Being a short-term loan with no guarantee of a contract beyond the summer raises the prospect of having to move himself and his family to a fourth different country within the space of a year if he does not stay in LA but leaves Chelsea.\nBarcelona, London and Los Angeles might be three of the most desirable lifestyle destinations around for any modern multi-millionaire footballer, but such a nomadic existence is not ideal. Leaving behind his family is not a palatable option for Aubameyang either, given the enduring emotional trauma they all feel resulting from the violent burglary in Spain last year that left him with a broken jaw.\nBut the primary reason for his opposition is rooted in football.\nAdvertisement\nAubameyang still regards himself as an elite goalscorer capable of being decisive on the sport’s biggest stages. He felt he provided a reminder of that in the second half of last season at Barcelona, scoring 11 goals in 17 La Liga appearances. Xavi, their head coach, at one point called him “a gift from heaven”, and expressed regret in September over the France-born Gabon international’s exit to join Chelsea.\n“I feel bad, because he helped us a lot,” the Barcelona coach said of Aubameyang. ”He was an example, on and off the pitch. He made a big difference — look at his numbers. As a person, he’s a jewel and always training with a smile on his face.”\nAubameyang also believed he had done enough in his brief stint at the Camp Nou to rehabilitate what he regards as an unfair image of him as an indisciplined troublemaker — an image forged in his final months at Dortmund that also dominated the narrative around his acrimonious departure from Arsenal four years later.\nDespite all the goals he scored for Dortmund, his reception at Signal Iduna Park for the first leg tonight (Wednesday) would not have been universal adulation.\nAubameyang achieved the impressive feat of being suspended by three different Dortmund coaches (Tuchel, Peter Bosz and Peter Stoger) for being late to either training or team meetings, with the final occasion during the January 2018 transfer window playing out against the backdrop of transfer interest from Arsenal.\n“I don’t know what is going through his mind,” Dortmund’s sporting director Michael Zorc said once the suspension was confirmed. “I do not recognise him anymore. He was always an extroverted guy but also always served as a prime example of professionalism. He has always worked with discipline and professionalism but I cannot detect that at the moment.”\nDortmund banked £56million for Aubameyang’s move to north London later that month, but the bad feeling persisted.\nAdvertisement\nThe Bundesliga club’s chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke said he had joined Arsenal for money and teased him about missing out on Champions League football with his new employers. Around 18 months later, Aubameyang issued a mocking response, referencing his former club’s £135million sale of Ousmane Dembele to Barcelona in 2017.\nBetter for you I never talk about why I really left Dortmund Mr Watzke you such a clown 🤡 I remember that time you said we never gonna sell Ousmane then you saw more than 100M you were the first to take that money 🤣🤣🤙🏽don’t talk about money please!!! Leave me alone pls 🙏🏽\n— AUBA⚡️ (@Auba) October 3, 2019\nNot everyone at Dortmund had such a negative view of Aubameyang. Long-time chief scout Sven Mislintat always felt those lapses of discipline at the club were overblown, and had no hesitation in bringing him to Arsenal during his stint as their head of recruitment.\nAubameyang quickly put the Dortmund controversy behind him in England, scoring 54 goals in his first 85 Premier League appearances and being awarded the captain’s armband by Emery after he succeeded Arsene Wenger before producing talismanic performances for current manager Mikel Arteta to beat Manchester City and Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals and final respectively in 2020.\nBut the perception persisted, and Aubameyang feels Arteta used his late return from an authorised trip abroad in December 2021 as a convenient pretext to force him out. He was one of Arsenal’s top earners and the club was looking to rebuild around younger talent. He gave up money to terminate his contract and join Barcelona, eager to prove his scoring talent again in a new team and league.\nPotter has not taken the same approach. When they talked at the club’s Cobham training ground, he simply told Aubameyang that he wanted more youth in attack with Kai Havertz and newcomer Joao Felix. In public, too, Potter has struck a conciliatory tone, emphasising that the door to more first-team minutes in the remainder of this season is not closed.\n“Every player should understand their situation and be treated with respect. Then it’s their decision how to act, and he has acted fantastically,” Potter said this week. “He really has.\n“We have got Joao, we have Kai, we have got David (Datro Fofana, another January arrival). We thought we wanted to get more of a look at them in the short term.\nAdvertisement\n“But that’s not to say it’s a terminal situation for Pierre. We had to be honest with him and give him time. That was why he was out of the previous match. But while he is here, it’s not to say that will always be the case.”\nPotter’s careful words are no consolation to Aubameyang, who would have backed himself to make a positive impact against Dortmund here and in the second leg on Tuesday, March 7. He had scored in victories home and away against another former club, Milan, in the group stage.\nOthers might point out that he has offered little evidence since those matches in October that he deserves such an opportunity, failing to find the net in 12 appearances across all competitions.\nDuring that stretch, his body language has often given the impression he would rather be somewhere else.\nHe came to Chelsea to play for Tuchel again, so it would be understandable if he felt misled by Boehly and Clearlake. Aubameyang is also far from the first Chelsea attacker to feel their movements in the final third are not being maximised by a midfield unit too often lacking imagination and precision.\nBeyond the question of who is to blame lies a stark, surreal reality: a Chelsea team chronically lacking a reliable goalscorer have chosen to embark on the Champions League knockout stage without the services of a player who has been one of Europe’s most reliable goalscorers over the last 10 years.\nAubameyang cannot understand it and would like to be important to Chelsea.\nInstead, he has a watching brief for now, and possibly for much of the time that remains until the exit door opens in May.\n(Top photo: Glyn Kirk/AFP via Getty Images)",
