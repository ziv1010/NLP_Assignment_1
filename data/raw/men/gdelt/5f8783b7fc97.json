The social media is bursting at its seams with all manner of vulgar words poured on Osimhen, with a few others insisting on jabbing Finidi as if they didn’t know that the NFF chiefs served Finidi the World Cup wine inside a poisoned chalice. If Nigeria had 10 points from the possible 12 points from the four matches so far played, it would have been celebrations everywhere. Pray, the loser is an orphan.\nI feel the pains hidden underneath Finidi’s heart because this would be the second time his loyalty towards the growth of the beautiful game in Nigeria is being questioned. As I reflected in my mind’s eye, I discovered Finidi literally walking naked in front of a mammoth crowd, my heart skipped. It went back to the horrific manner in which Finidi’s younger brother Igeniwari George was brutally killed by what today still remains a stray bullet shot by an unknown person around the premises of the Lekan Salami Stadium with Igeniwari sitting inside Enugu Rangers FC’s bus. It was a dastardly fallout of a Challenge Cup quarter-final game between the Rangers FC (Flying Antelopes) and the vociferous Stationary Stores FC (Adebajo Babes) of Lagos.\nGeorge died of gunshot wounds after a Challenge Cup game between Enugu Rangers and Stationary Stores at the Lekan Salami Stadium, Ibadan on September 9, 1995. That was the year his elder brother Finidi won the UEFA Champions League with Ajax.\nRead Also: Tinubu laying foundation for prosperous, sustainable Nigeria, says NPC DG\nThe late Igeniwari George could not be saved after he was rushed to the University Teaching Hospital, Ibadan where it was alleged that the hospital had a water shortage to carry out a surgery operation. He was part of the Golden Eaglets squad to the 1995 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Ecuador. He featured in four games for the Eaglets. His killer remains unknown to date.\nExcept for Coca-Cola’s management in one of their Challenge Cup series which they bankrolled, and remembered the late Igeniwari, all other Challenge Cup finals have been played oblivious of the heart-wrenching incident.\nThe puzzle around who killed Igeniwari Gorge years ago still finds consonance with the many questions around the Finidi versus Osimhen saga leaving me with a painful question: “Why always Finidi George?” When Igeniwari was killed, many had thought that Finidi would never play for Nigeria. But he didn’t shun Nigeria as he continued to give his very best in all the matches thereafter, preferring to sulk and bear the pains of the irreparable loss. Perhaps, believing firmly that God knows best.\nFinidi must be pondering over another question akin to the unanswered question (who killed Igeniwari George) with his brother’s death. This time the question would be who leaked the fake news that brought out the bestial tendencies in Osimhen? Sadly, the root cause of Osimhen’s vulgar rants has remained mute and unapologetic while Nigerians take their turns in making Osimhen look like a villain.\nMy plea to the elders of the game in Nigeria is that Finidi shouldn’t be left in the cold again like they did to him when his younger brother was killed. I marvel at the way many ex-internationals have joined the crowd in pillorying Osimhen, with many of them suggesting an outright ban for the SSC Napoli striker. Not one of them has suggested the need for their parent body which addresses the problems of players – the Nigeria Players Union – to speak with both the coach and Osimhen, who is livid. In fact, Osimhen in his rage revealed that he offered to come to the camp to motivate his teammates which the coach politely rejected. Is there any truth in this revelation, dear Finidi? What harm would Osimhen’s presence in the camp have brought to the camp, we may need to ask Finidi, if indeed, he rejected that request.\nEven the union’s leaders have offered suggestions of how to take the matter out of social media and find a way of getting Osimhen to shake off his angst as captured in his many videos before walking up to Finidi to apologise. Pictures of that gesture with the players’ union members seated would soothe the pains suffered by Finidi. The Players Union’s hierarchy is only interested in being members of the NFF and other affiliate football bodies. Members have failed in this Finidi/Osimhen saga. It is not too late to redeem themselves by calling a truce and letting all the parties shake their hands for the good of the game.\nOsimhen doesn’t look like someone who thinks that he is indispensable. Not with the way he plays for his club and country as if his life depends on it. Osimhen has erred no doubt. Yet, he needs to be given a second chance. Hounding him before giving him a chance to recant isn’t the best. Osimhen must be ashamed of himself now that it is clear that Finidi didn’t belittle him before his employers. Come on Osimhen, apologise to Finidi who is the quintessential gentleman.\nThe elders of the game who have been getting traction on the internet with their posts calling for Osimhen’s ban instead of preaching for peace must be ashamed of themselves with NFF’s statement to the contrary of their devious campaigns. Osimhen needs Nigeria badly for his career growth just as Nigeria needs him and all talented players to boost her ranking with FIFA and CAF, especially now that Nigeria dropped eight places to 38 position in FIFA ranking for June 2024. Osimhen is the current Africa Footballer of the Year. It gladdens Nigerians that Ademola Lookman is poised to replace Osimhen as the next winner if he sustains his current form for both his European club and Nigeria. That is what is called growth. Time was when Nigerians dominated the Africa Footballer of the Year awards. It is good to be back.\nNFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi expressed amazement at the reports, saying the Federation has neither instructed a process nor has a process been concluded to ban the player from the National Team.\n“The NFF hereby implores the media to join hands with the body to positively resolve issues and then focus on the big picture all the time, rather than needlessly escalate certain matters. There was no official communication from the NFF, yet some persons have gone to town to talk about a ban on Osimhen from the National Team. This is not good at all.\n“Our focus presently is to resolve all matters around the Super Eagles and be able to look ahead with confidence to the 2025 AFCON qualifiers and the remaining six matches of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification series.\n“This is not the time to spread falsehood and foul the public space the most,” Well said, Sanusi. Kudos NFF.\nWho leaked the story to journalists? Pray, there were six people with the minister, Senator John Enoh. The six people include Ibrahim Gusau (NFF President), Felix Anyansi-Agwu (Vice President), Mohammed Sanusi (Secretary General), Dayo Enebi Achor (Director of Competitions), Austin Eguavoen (Technical Director) and Finidi George. It’s not Finidi or the Sports Minister. Then who was the culprit? What was the motive? Why did he feel the need to feed Osimhen with a piece of false information that would make him pour vituperations on Finidi?",
