Tunisia, despite its football pedigree, has only one approved venue, while several countries—including Sierra Leone, Sudan, and Zimbabwe—currently have none.\nCAF officials are expected to continue inspections across the continent, with more venues to be added once they meet the confederation’s strict compliance standards.\nThe inclusion of the Godswill Akpabio Stadium highlights Akwa Ibom State’s consistent investment in world-class sports infrastructure and stands as a boost to Nigerian football’s continental image.",
