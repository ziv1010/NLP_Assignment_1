Manchester United travel up to Anfield on Sunday January 5, and if Liverpool want to build on their place at the top of the table, they need to be ready for United to try and spoil our party.\nAlexis Mac Allister: “We Are Working Really Hard To Play A Good Game”\nThe midfielder looks forward to playing against Manchester United at home for the first time.\nAlexis Mac Allister, despite joining in the summer of 2023, has yet to play our rivals at home, and is very much looking forward to the opportunity on Sunday. The Argentinian midfielder missed out on this fixture last season after a knee injury, but is well aware of the rivalry.\n“Since I arrived at the club, I understood the rivalry between both clubs. I love playing these kind of games,” Mac Allister told the club website on Friday.\n“Hopefully it’s going to be a nice one for us. We are working really hard to play a good game.\n“It’s the first time I will play Man United at Anfield, so it’s going to be a nice game and hopefully we can get the win.”\nThe players enjoyed a rare but well-earned break after their dismantling of West Ham last weekend, taking a couple days off to enjoy the last days of 2024 before returning to work. The midfielder is quick to point out that their focus is back on the Premier League and the busy periods ahead, and his own performances.\n“I think it’s really important for us to have some days off, as you say, be with the family and enjoy life. But now our focus is back on the Premier League and we know that it’s going to be a long and hopefully nice month for us,” the Argentinian said.\n“I always put the team ahead of me. I think the team played a really good game but I really enjoyed it. I’ve had quite a few nice games in the last couple of weeks, maybe the most important were Real Madrid and Man City; really good games. But definitely against West Ham I felt that it was a good performance.”\nMac Allister himself has struggled with his own breaks, nursing a knock earlier in the season after getting injured during international breaks and missing a game through suspension, but is confident that those days are behind him - and thankful that the team persevered without him.\n“We come back to the days off I had, I want to say thank you to Arne [Slot], the coaching staff and my teammates as well because while they were running a lot, I had a week off in between because I was suspended for the Premier League and Champions League at the same time,” Mac Allister explained.\n“I had a week off, which was really important for me to be with the family and to enjoy and recharge the batteries. I’m really glad about my performances so far. Hopefully we can keep on going.”\nHe may set high targets for himself throughout the season, like increasing his goals and assists naturally, but insists that playing with this group of men on the squad is the easiest and most important thing.\n“Numbers are not the most important thing but at the same time I want to improve them. I love scoring and assisting and I want to do it more often,” the midfielder said.\n“But at the same time I understand that football is not just numbers – there are a lot of things. I feel really important for the team and that’s the only thing I want.\n“I always say it’s quite easy to play with these guys. They are too good. And we are supported by our defence and our attacking players as well. I think it’s about finding the balance in the team and I think everyone in the team is doing really, really well. Hopefully we can keep this togetherness and we can move forward and keep winning games.”\nIt’s also no secret that the squad are embroiled in another title challenge, that will hopefully stick. They’re 7 points clear at the top with a game in hand, and all focus is turned towards maintaining that gap and holding onto their spot. Winning the league in only his second season with the Reds would be quite the achievement for Mac Allister.\n“We know that we are in a really good place and, of course, we look at the table every single day and we dream to win this Premier League,” Mac Allister said.\n“But there is still a long way [to go]. We know that this month is going to be really important for us. Our dream is to win it, so hopefully we can do it.”",
