During the summer of 2023 he spent time with the Gunners' youth teams, working alongside Under-18s manager and former teammate Jack Wilshere.\nSpeaking to the Evening Standard, Fabregas said: “You never know how the future will go, but I want to be a main coach.\n\"I am doing my own way at the moment. 100% my ambition one day is to coach a top club in the Premier League, the Champions League.\n\"But you need to respect the right steps. I feel I am ready to be a first-team coach already so I don't really want to go into these types of little coaching on the side or being an assistant.\n\"I have very clear things in my mind that I just want to be a main coach, a first-team coach, and that's why I will do my own way until I am ready to jump onto a big train.\n\"But for now, there is a long way to go. I am just getting started. I feel privileged for the opportunity Como has given me and I am very happy here.\"\nFabregas is set to complete his UEFA Pro coaching license, which would then allow him to manage a Premier League side.\nComo - who are managed by ex-Crystal Palace and Wales assistant coach Osian Roberts - currently sit in second place in Serie B and are on course for promotion to Serie A. They return to action on Saturday when they travel to Feralpisalo.",
