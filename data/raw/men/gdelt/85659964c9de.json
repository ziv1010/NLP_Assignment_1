It was a brilliant time.\n“It’s just him, a football and playing the game he loves. It could be on a sandy pitch in The Gambia, it could be in Odense, it could be in the Premier League.\n“When he gets the chance to play in the Premier League, he will grab it.”\nTom Saintfiet, head coach of The Gambia’s national team:\n“He is very young and has a lot of qualities.\n“He is very fast but he can use that speed in a dribble.\n“He can create on the inside and outside, look for a combination or go for goal and is unpredictable for defenders.\n“The expectations were very high and the desire for a transfer puts a lot of pressure on a young player.\n“He’s still a kid.\n“He listens to the coach and advisers but also puts himself under pressure because he tasted what it was like to be a star.\n“He is a very passionate guy, a very nice guy to work with – very respectful and disciplined.\n“He has the level to play higher than the Danish league – the only question is, what are his limits?\n“You have to give a player of his age three or four years to know. Is it Holland? Is it England? We don’t know right now.\n“It’s a different level physically and mentally but it’s a very, very smart move by Newcastle and the player that he goes to Feyenoord. The Dutch league is very good for young attacking players.\n“This transfer gives him a little bit of time to enjoy himself. We don’t need to put on too much pressure from the start. Let him grow.”\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
