One European club are hoping for a happier 2026.\nComing up:\n- FC Haka’s shocking inferno\n- Man Utd rescue 41-year streak\n- Tyler Adams injury concern\n- Re-enacting ‘The Tardelli’\nFire in Finland\n(Video: Mikko Aaltonen)\nA child was involved in the blaze that destroyed Haka’s stadium\nFC Haka are one of Finland’s most successful football clubs and as such, they’ve had better years. In October, they were relegated from the country’s top division — 27 games yielded four wins, 17 points and a sad journey down the Finnish league ladder.\nAdvertisement\nBut the club’s 2025 got considerably worse nine days ago when a stand at their Tehtaan kentta stadium burned to the ground. It is the second time in the venue’s 91-year history that it has been ravaged by fire, following an inferno that destroyed the main stand in 1994. Fortunately, no human casualties were reported.\nPolice in Valkeakoski — the small industrial town in southern Finland where Haka are based — soon announced that they suspected foul play. Three minors under the age of 15 were questioned and, according to the authorities, one of them admitted to lighting an object that sparked the blaze inside Tehtaan kentta.\nAn investigation is ongoing but in Finland, children under 15 are not criminally liable.\nThere is no clarity about why the vandalism occurred. It is unclear, for example, if it was motivated by Haka’s relegation or something else entirely. What is certain is that Haka cannot use their stadium for the time being. One look at the extent of the blaze (above) and the smouldering aftermath helps explain why.\nModest though their surroundings might be (Tehtaan kentta has a capacity of just 3,500, and Valkeakoski a population of 21,000), Haka are a famous footballing brand in Finland. They have nine league titles to their name, along with 12 Finnish Cups — only one club, Helsinki’s HJK, have won more in either competition. And the reassuring part of an unhappy story is that the sport is coming together to help them rebuild.\nHow are they rebuilding the club?\nHaka, whose artificial pitch was also damaged by the fire, launched an immediate fundraising appeal with quick results. Finnish players based domestically and elsewhere in Europe have donated match shirts for an auction. One came from a UEFA Conference League tie involving Kuopion Palloseura, who beat Haka twice last season, results that played a big part in their relegation from the Veikkausliiga.\nAdvertisement\nJessica Hopkins spoke to Haka chairman Marko Laaksonen for The Athletic. “Our worst rivals and those we are competing with, they are supporting us and sending us jerseys to be sold, or running any other way to be used in our fundraising to get the club back on track,” Laaksonen said. “Maybe this horrible situation gives something good for the Haka and for the Finnish football community too.”\nHaka’s 2026 season is due to start at the end of January. It leaves precious little time to address the damage and bring Tehtaan kentta up to speed again. But while their stand was left to burn, they as a club haven’t been, and in that, at least they can find some comfort.\nGame of the season?\nEight-goal thriller keeps Manchester United pushing for Champions League\nOnce in a while, a statistic hits you for six. Here’s a case in point: the last time Manchester United led at half-time at Old Trafford (in any competition) and went on to lose was 1984, a run of 543 games. To provide historical context, the last sitting United States president who could have witnessed it happen would be Ronald Reagan.\nI’m wondering how that ridiculous record bypassed me for so long but anyhow, it was in real danger of being broken on Monday night. Despite leading Bournemouth three times in a chaotic and immensely entertaining 4-4 draw, United were 3-2 down with 13 minutes to go. A world-class free kick from Bruno Fernandes (above) did its bit in keeping their 41-year streak intact.\nTheir dearth of control was typical of Ruben Amorim’s reign as head coach. Neither he nor the crowd around him can ever say what’s coming next. It’s hard to categorise United as a good team (because sometimes they look quite the opposite) but had they converted their winning positions yesterday, they’d be joint fourth with Chelsea in the Premier League — and fast becoming one of this season’s little mysteries.\nAdvertisement\nNews round-up 🗞️\n-\nA worrying development for Bournemouth and the U.S. national team at Old Trafford: Tyler Adams limped off in the first half (above) with suspected damage to the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his left knee. The severity of the injury is still being assessed\n- Tottenham Hotspur head coach Thomas Frank has received the backing of the club’s hierarchy after a patchy start to his tenure. Spurs continue to think he’ll come good.\n- Three bidders are still in the ring to buy stricken Championship side Sheffield Wednesday. One of them is former Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley.\n- The manager of Bury, an English non-League team, has left his role after just two days following a backlash against his appointment from fans. Michael Jolley pleaded guilty in 2009 to having sex with a 15-year-old girl. He has consistently claimed that the girl had told him she was 19.\nOpening Madrid’s books 💵\nWhy the world’s highest-earning club are seeking new investment\nMost of the chatter around Real Madrid concerns their head coach, Xabi Alonso, but there’s another hot topic of conversation inside the Bernabeu: Madrid’s intention to allow private investors to purchase a stake in the club.\nThe proposal will be put to a vote among the club’s members, known as socios, who own the 15-time European champions, and a question that needed to be asked was this: why, when Madrid are apparently so powerful on and off the pitch, are they actively seeking external funding?\nOur own Chris Weatherspoon tackled that paradox in the most granular analysis of Madrid’s finances you’ll find anywhere. His report is an exceptional study of an entity that has, at face value, been profitable for 23 years straight, including through the Covid-19 pandemic. Madrid are the world’s highest-earning team, with a squad that cost £940m ($1.25bn) to build and an overall club wage bill of £451m. They’re not exactly living through a fallow harvest.\nBut Chris went looking for the devil in the detail, and found plenty of it. Madrid have taken on loans and debts, much of it stemming from the redevelopment of the Bernabeu (above). They’re also worried that as the years pass, competing with state-backed rivals, such as Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City, will become trickier.\nThe swerve towards outside investment isn’t driven by an underlying lack of cash but by the realisation that elite football is booming and a complacent club could get left behind.\nAround TAFC 🔄\n- FIFA’s Best Awards take place in Qatar today. Think of them as the Ballon d’Or ceremony by another name. The highlights tend to be the Puskas and Marta awards for the best men’s and women’s goals of the year. Dan Sheldon has an overview of the runners and riders — and who decides them.\n- Bayern Munich are actually starting to drop a few points in Germany’s Bundesliga. Mainz’s 2-2 draw at the Allianz Arena was a top result over the weekend — and a great start for their new head coach Urs Fischer.\n- Tom Bogert’s MLS dispatches are always worth keeping up with. Goalkeeper Carlos Coronel looks like he’s off to Orlando City, and St. Louis City are about to turn the keys to their first team over to a 35-year-old rookie head coach.\n- Genoa versus Inter in Serie A on Sunday sounded wild. James Horncastle observed the mayhem.\n- Most clicked in Monday’s TAFC: Lionel Messi’s GOAT tour chaos.\nCatch a match 📺\n(Both kick-offs 3pm ET/8pm UK time)\nCarabao Cup quarter-final: Cardiff City vs Chelsea — Paramount+/Sky Sports.\nCopa del Rey, last 32: Deportivo Guadalajara vs Barcelona — ESPN/Premier Sports.\nAnd finally…\nTHE WASHINGTON HUSKIES WIN THE MEN'S COLLEGE CUP ON A GOLDEN GOAL 😱\nWHAT A MOMENT TO WIN THE NATTY 🔥 pic.twitter.com/h6pQxUu0T2\n— ESPN (@espn) December 16, 2025\nAmerica’s NCAA Division I title, or the College Cup as it’s often known, went the way of the University of Washington last night. The Huskies beat the North Carolina State Wolfpack 3-2 with a golden goal in extra time of the final, claiming their first national championship.\nAdvertisement\nHarrison Bertos — drafted by new MLS franchise San Diego FC in 2024 but enlisted by his school for one last dance this year — scrambled in the close-range winner, and I can’t have been alone in seeing shades of Marco Tardelli in Bertos’ reaction.\nTardelli’s euphoria after putting Italy 2-0 up against West Germany in the final was the moment of the 1982 World Cup (you can relive it here) and what are killer goals for if not a bit of overblown celebration?",
