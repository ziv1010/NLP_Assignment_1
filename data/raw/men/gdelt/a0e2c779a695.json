  "body_text": "This summer we are running a series profiling 50 exciting players under the age of 25 — who they are, how they play, and why they could be attracting interest in the coming transfer windows.So far we have run the rule over a striker on Manchester United’s radar, Gen-Z’s answer to Sergio Busquets and the France forward who has gone from zero to €100million in the space of a year. You can find all our profiles so far here.Next up is a Dutch defender who is very much in demand…\nLast summer, Manchester United were desperate to sign a new centre-back and at one stage it seemed they were destined to land Jurrien Timber. This time round, Arsenal are keen to take the Netherlands international to the Emirates, as revealed by The Athletic on Monday.\nAdvertisement\nErik ten Hag promoted Timber into Ajax’s first-team in 2020 and they won the Eredivisie title together in successive seasons.\nTimber is extremely comfortable on the ball and is capable of operating at right-back. After Ten Hag left Ajax to usher in a new era at Old Trafford, with the aim of implementing a more progressive style of play, a reunion with Timber made perfect sense. However, a figure from United’s past expressed his doubts over the move.\n“I think a player of his quality can play in the Premier League,” Louis van Gaal, who was in charge of the Netherlands at the time, said in June 2022. “That is not a problem. If he has to make this big step now, that’s the question. It is not so wise I think (to move to United). He has to play.”\nTimber signed a new three-year contract at Ajax and insisted Van Gaal’s advice was not a factor in the decision. United pivoted to a new target — Timber’s defensive partner Lisandro Martinez.\nHowever, 12 months on it feels like Ajax will struggle to keep Timber for any longer. He starred for the Netherlands, under Van Gaal, at the 2022 World Cup and his stock keeps rising. He has been linked with Liverpool and he made a special appearance at Wembley for this year’s FA Cup final between United and Manchester City.\nJürrien Timber er på Wembley i dag. pic.twitter.com/hoG43uQCJI\n— Fredrik A. Filtvedt (@FAFiltvedt) June 3, 2023\nIn an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf in April, he admitted a transfer is “getting closer and closer”.\n“There is a lot of concrete interest and I have made agreements with Ajax,” Timber said. “Last year Ajax asked me to stay for at least one more season and to extend my contract. As a club boy, I did that with love and after the season we will review the situation. At the Dutch national team, I often talk to boys who play football abroad. I want to take that step someday.”\nAdvertisement\nLots of Europe’s top clubs are in the market for a centre-back this summer and The Athletic has analysed why Timber, who turned 22 on Saturday, is on their radar.\nIt is impossible to talk about Timber without mentioning his twin brother, Quinten. They were born in Utrecht and joined Feyenoord’s academy together at the age of seven. The pair moved to Ajax when they were teenagers and Jurrien began to overtake his brother’s progress. They both represented the Netherlands at the Under-17 European Championship in 2018. Jurrien scored in the final against Italy and converted a penalty during the shootout to help his country win the tournament.\nWithin two years he made his senior debut for Ajax and he broke into Ten Hag’s squad for the 2020-21 campaign. He regularly played alongside Martinez in defence and they helped Ajax win a domestic double. Quinten left the club to join Utrecht in May 2021 without ever making a first-team appearance.\nTimber was even more impressive during the following season. Ajax won all six of their matches in the Champions League group stages, including a 4-0 thrashing of Borussia Dortmund, but got knocked out in the round of 16 by Benfica.\nTen Hag’s side won the title again and conceded only 19 goals in the process. There were lots of candidates for the Eredivisie Player of the Year award, including Sebastien Haller and Lois Openda, but Timber won and was named the Johan Cruyff Talent of the Year (for young players) too. Previous winners of that accolade include Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Matthijs de Ligt.\nOne of Timber’s best qualities is his composure on the ball. At the World Cup, he played on the right-hand side of a back three with Virgil van Dijk and Nathan Ake. Timber used his impressive passing range and dribbling ability to help the team progress up the pitch.\nAdvertisement\nThere is an example of Timber’s skill in possession in Ajax’s 4-2 victory over Volendam in October. Steven Berghuis has the ball out wide and he fizzes it into space.\nTimber charges out from defence to collect the ball and effortlessly glides past Carel Eiting.\nAs he approaches the box, he slips a pass for Brian Brobbey to chase.\nThe ball was slightly overhit, but Brobbey catches up to it and fires a shot past Filip Stankovic. Timber has advanced so far up the pitch that he is in the box when Brobbey scores.\nIf you thought that was special, check out Timber’s role in Steven Bergwijn’s goal for Ajax in a 3-1 victory against Emmen in April. Edson Alvarez pings the ball to Timber, who is camped in Emmen’s half.\nThe centre-back takes a touch and attempts to split Emmen’s defence open with a pass towards overlapping full-back Jorge Sanchez.\nIt works perfectly and Sanchez squares the ball across goal to give Bergwijn an easy finish. It should come as no surprise that Timber made on average 9.8 passes into the final third per game in the Eredivisie last season.\nThere are not many defenders in the world who possess such an intricate passing range and are so confident carrying the ball. According to data from FBref, Timber averaged 90.5 touches per game last season in the Dutch top flight — more than any other player. Even more impressively, 59 per cent of his touches were in the middle third which is very high for a centre-back and underlines how much he gets involved in attacks.\nThe 22-year-old completed 2,517 passes in total, 379 more than the next highest player in the division, with an overall accuracy of 91.6 per cent. He could slot into most possession-dominant sides with ease.\nWhen Ajax faced Rangers in the Champions League last September, Timber was superb. This touchmap shows you how often he was able to get on the ball in Rangers’ half. The Scottish side were completely blown away and lost 4-0.\nWe could rave about Timber’s ball progression all day long, but is he actually any good at defending?\nAdvertisement\nThis sequence from the Netherlands’ 4-0 defeat to France in the Nations League in March actually starts with Timber’s pass towards Wout Weghorst getting intercepted by Antoine Griezmann.\nThe Netherlands’ defensive shape is all over the place and Ake pushes up on Kingsley Coman while Timber tracks back. Aurelien Tchouameni takes over the ball from Griezmann and plays a pass into space for Ibrahima Konate.\nKonate strides past Memphis Depay…\nBefore beating Georginio Wijnaldum and playing a pass in behind for Randal Kolo Muani to chase. Timber has spotted the danger and tracks the Eintracht Frankfurt forward — who is also the subject of serious interest from Manchester United. If we are being harsh, Ake, Van Dijk and Timber should have organised themselves properly and caught Kolo Muani offside fairly easily.\nKolo Muani is in a great position and Timber is the last line of defence. Timber smartly moves his body sideways on so he can adjust his positioning better depending on which direction Kolo Muani darts off in.\nKolo Muani gets closer towards the box and teases cutting inside.\nHe then suddenly shifts the ball back onto his right foot and tries to find space for a shot.\nTimber sticks with him, makes a tackle and the ball bounces off Kolo Muani for a goal kick. Timber showed remarkable composure not to dive in at any stage and trust himself to deal with the danger. He can sometimes be guilty of trying to win the ball back too quickly in these situations, though, and making rash challenges.\nIn possession dominant sides who like to play with high lines, Timber’s recovery speed and one-v-one defending ability will be crucial to mitigate counter-attacks. Timber is not the tallest centre-back, but he makes up for that by being aggressive. He likes to step in front of the striker and pinch the ball off their toes.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Ajax faced Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League in October 2021, Timber went into battle with Erling Haaland. In the closing stages of the game, Gregor Kobel launches the ball towards the Norwegian forward.\nHaaland uses his body and large limbs to bring the ball down and spin behind Timber.\nHaaland is about to burst through for a one-v-one with Ajax’s goalkeeper Remko Pasveer.\nHowever, Timber uses every ounce of his strength to muscle Haaland off the ball, pivot away from danger and play a pass to Davy Klaassen, relieving the pressure. Ajax might have been leading 4-0, but it was still an important contribution from Timber.\nAjax suffered a dramatic drop-off in form this season. They finished 13 points behind champions Feyenoord, who had Quinten at the heart of their midfield. The twins still live together and even share a bedroom, but after another year of progression Jurrien’s time for a new challenge has surely arrived.\n(Top photo: Getty Images; design: Sam Richardson)",
