  "body_text": "Liverpool v Newcastle preview ahead of Anfield clash\nWelcome to the Liverpool V Newcastle preview.\nSaturday 31st January and an 8pm kick-off.\nThe Toon visit one of their least favourite venues this Saturday night, hoping to achieve a victory that has eluded them at Anfield since a League Cup match in 1995.\nWednesday night proved that NUFC are capable of mixing it with the very best teams in Europe and we’ll need to be taking a similar attitude into this one if we’re to give the travelling Toon Army anything to be happy about.\nThe reds have proved themselves far from infallible so far this season and this could well be an intriguing match.\nThe two sides played out an absolute cracker earlier in the season when ten-man United came from two goals down to equalise and even looked the more likely winner until being hit by a late sucker punch, revenge this time around would be celebrated long and hard throughout the weekend.\nForm\nThe last six Premier league matches have seen Newcastle win three, draw one and lose two. Wins have come against Burnley, Crystal Palace and Leeds, whereas we played out a bore draw away at Wolves. Disappointing defeats have come away to Man United and at home to Villa. We’ve scored nine goals in this sequence and conceded seven. The ten points gained has us ninth in the league with an opportunity to sneak into the top six with a win.\nLiverpool have won one, drawn four and lost one of their past six matches and haven’t won any of the last five. They beat Wolves in December but 2026 has seen them draw with Leeds, Fulham, Arsenal and Burnley before losing away to Bournemouth last weekend. They’ve scored seven and conceded seven. The seven points gained has them sixth in the league with the chance to make the top four with a win.\nLast time out\nNewcastle travelled to PSG on Wednesday night and achieved a very creditable 1-1 draw against the current European champions. It looked like it was going to be a disastrous evening when PSG were awarded a ludicrous penalty in the first minute of the match. Thankfully, Nick Pope was equal to it and pulled off a magnificent save diving to his left to defy Dembele. The joy was soon cut short when PSG did find the net just a few minutes later. Thankfully the Toon stood up and were counted, taking the game back to their illustrious opponents and being denied a penalty for an offence that was remarkably similar to the one given at the other end of the pitch. Despite this, Newcastle continued to attack and a long-range Tonali freekick was flicked on by Dan Burn for Joe Willock to bury a header and level the tie. The second half saw the Toon come desperately close to winning when Willock had an effort disallowed and both Gordon and Barnes missed good chances to seal a famous victory.\nLiverpool were also in Champions League action on Wednesday night and strolled to a 6-0 win over our next Champions League opponents Qarabag. This allowed them a third place finish in the league and a place in the last-sixteen.\nStat attack! (look away now!)\n-Newcastle have won one Premier League match at Anfield in thirty attempts.\n-NUFC’s lost twenty league matches at Anfield has seen five draws and fifteen defeats.\n-The Toon last celebrated a win at Anfield in a 1995 League Cup tie, our last league win there came at the end of the 93/94 season.\nMemorable match\nOn the last day of the 03/04 season, Sir Bobby Robson’s Newcastle went to Anfield having endured a difficult end of the season as disappointing score draws against Wolves and Southampton meant there would be no Champions League football on Tyneside the following season. There was still the incentive of a place in the UEFA Cup should final-day results favour NUFC. Things got off to a cracking start when Shola Ameobi smacked home an effort at the Kop to send Toon fans delirious. Things almost got even better early in the second half when Darren Ambrose had a header cleared off the line despite looking a certain scorer. Unfortunately, reality intervened with a well-taken effort from nemesis Micheal Owen but the Toon were able to hang on for a vital point that saw us scrape into the UEFA cup ahead of Aston Villa on goal difference. Liverpool 1-1 Newcastle.\nPlayed for both\nJohn Barnes was a goal scoring legend with both Liverpool and England throughout the eighties and nineties, he netted eighty-four goals in three hundred and fourteen appearances for the reds before signing for Kenny Dalglish’s new look NUFC in 1997. Often ridiculed as being part of a ‘Dad’s army’ group alongside Ian Rush and Stuart Pearce, people often forget that Barnes’ six league goals in 97/98 were directly responsible for avoiding a catastrophic relegation to the second tier. He may be much more fondly remembered on Anfield than Tyneside but well-taken strikes against West Ham and Bolton along with a brace against Southampton and an equaliser away to Coventry, ensured survival for the Toon. He left in Feb 1999 for Charton Athletic after spending eighteen months at NUFC.\nDanny Guthrie played three league matches for Liverpool without finding the net before enjoying loan spells at Southampton and Bolton. He was signed by Kevin Keegan in 2008 and made a promising debut at Old Trafford before Keegan walked a few weeks later and all hell broke loose. He stayed on after our relegation to the championship in 2009 and became an integral part of the team that gained promotion, scoring five goals and assisting thirteen. He stayed at Newcastle for four years before signing for Reading in 2012.\nFreddie Woodman played four league games in goal for NUFC at the start of the 21/22 season but didn’t have the best of times as the Toon struggled both on and off the pitch. Having been at the club since 2014, he had enjoyed six separate loan moves to various clubs before signing for Preston in 2022. He signed for Liverpool over the summer and made his debut in a 3-0 League Cup defeat against Crystal Palace.\nManagers\nEddie Howe after a 1-1 away draw with PSG:\n“We set out to try to qualify outright but I think you take every eventuality that falls your way. Now, we knew this would be our last game and it was going to be really tough if we were needing to win, and that was the position we found ourselves in. We went all out to try to do that, to try to win the game and we chased it as much as we could without leaving ourselves with the possibility of losing, because I don’t think that would have helped us either. We gave everything we could to try to finish in the top eight; we didn’t quite get there, so we have to go another route. You can debate the first decision, but if you think it’s a penalty – which obviously the officials did – then for me, the next one has to be a penalty as well. I don’t think the first one is, personally, I don’t think the one against Lewie should have been given. It hits their player’s arm first and it’s unintentional.”\nArne Slot after a 6-0 win at home to Quarabg:\n“We didn’t have a bad five, six or seven minutes. That’s usually how we have it in the other games but we didn’t have that. We were 6-0 up and they had one counter attack but I saw my players back. I think I’ve said many times that players are developing and that’s also because of them. They work really hard to be able to play every three days.I took them off to give them rest ahead of Newcastle. It is development and that’s what the club knew when we made many changes in the summer.”\nCharity\nAs it is an away match, Newcastle United fans will not be collecting opposite the Gallowgate end, for the food bank. However, you can still help out and all online cash donations are very much appreciated. For further info and/or to donate to the food bank online.\nPrediction\nI’ve not been feeling good about this one, the tough set of fixtures coupled with annual Anfield misery led to me having a bad feeling that this will be another occasion to forget. Liverpool however are yet to win in the league in 2026 and have a number of injuries. Arne Slot could well be feeling the pressure. Newcastle looked immense on Wednesday night despite an unfamiliar line-up and a more of the same could see a very creditable return. Liverpool 1-1 Newcastle.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
