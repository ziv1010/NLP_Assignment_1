Des Moines and the surrounding metro area become a destination in the steamy months with art, food, music and cultural festivals to satisfy most every craving.\nSeveral communities have their neighborhood celebrations and Fourth of July fireworks displays. Looking to stay inside? Community theatre performances deliver the entertainment — with air conditioning. If your way of beating the heat is working up a sweat, there are also plenty of fun runs, walks and triathlons for you and your kids.\nDes Moines is home to several sports teams that have games going all summer long, too. Catch a game at Principal Park and watch the iconic Iowa Cubs. Head to Valley Stadium and see one of the best USL2 teams in the Iowa Menace. And the Iowa Barnstormers keep the pigskin flying in the summer, too.\nAll these activities and more give us plenty to throw at you in this 2025 Summer Arts & Entertainment Guide. Keep this issue handy from May through September and see how many of these area events you can hit.\nEDITOR’S NOTE: We strive for accuracy in these listings, but event details are subject to change.
