Images showed that Martin was escorted out of another part of the stadium by security guards before reportedly leaving in a car.\nThe Ibrox side are in eighth place with one win in seven William Hill Premiership fixtures, 11 points behind leaders Hearts and nine behind Celtic and Martin, who described the chants as “character building”, was asked if he was getting enough from the players.\nHe said: “They’re giving us everything they’ve got. I think they’re really trying. So I have to take responsibility for it, not them.\n“There’s been some really honest discussions with them in the dressing room, some frustration with them and each other, but ultimately I’m the one in charge of the team, so I have to accept responsibility. We haven’t had enough wins on days like today, so it’s been a frustrating period.”\nMartin post-match conceded the backing of the Ibrox board is not infinite, but remains confident that he can get it right.\nHe said: “I think it’s the same everywhere. Just this club is intensified, and the scrutiny is much higher, the noise is much louder.\n“So every draw we’ve had has felt like a defeat because of the stature of this club and what it means and what we have to try and fight for.\n“So I can’t answer your question really, you’d have to ask the people above me.\n“I feel that the players and the staff are really behind me. I felt really supported by everyone else above me as well, and I can’t dictate whether that changes or not.\n“I have to just try and focus on winning football matches (and we can do that) because of what I see every day with the players, how invested they are in it, how hard they run.\n“If I felt any differently, I would feel differently here. It probably wouldn’t hurt as much, but I know they’re really trying.”\nMcGlynn expressed sympathy for his counterpart but admitted he scented blood after Rangers’ 2-1 defeat by Sturm Graz in Austria on Thursday night\nThe Falkirk boss said: “Absolutely, you’ve got to have sympathy for Russell. It’s not nice.\n“As a manager, you’re trying to do your best. But we smelled blood today.\n“There would be something wrong if I didn’t mention that to the players this week.\n“European football is difficult, and they were in Austria last week. We had to take advantage of that.\n“There have been ongoing issues with Rangers and the fans. Russell doesn’t necessarily get a break, and I’m extremely sympathetic.\n“That’s never happened before (chant against the manager after the team scores). I’ve never heard that. It’s very strange, but we knew it would happen.\n“It happened last week, so it was going to happen this week.”",
