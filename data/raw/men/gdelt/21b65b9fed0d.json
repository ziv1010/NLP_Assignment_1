We just went out and he said ‘try to score one goal and we’ll see from that and that’s what we did”.\nNobody will ever forget what happened that night in Turkey and Manchester City may go on to associate one of their greatest nights in their history with the city too but it’s unlikely we’ll witness another game of football anything like the night we went and won it five times.\nThe role of the now 50-year-old midfielder is often underplayed but we have a lot to thank him for too and it’s great to see the wide smile on his face as he recalls the best night of his professional career.\nYou can watch Smicer’s comments on Benitez (from 0:52) via Sky Sports News on YouTube:",
