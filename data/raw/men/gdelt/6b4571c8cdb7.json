The original article can be found in Babak Baru Perjalanan Newcastle di Eropa\nNEWCASTLE, THURSDAY — After 20 years of waiting, St James' Park Stadium, home of Newcastle United, echoed the iconic Champions League anthem again. Not only welcoming the return of the best club competition in Europe, the football arena which has been used since 1892 is witness to a new chapter in the journey of \"The Magpies\" in the continental arena.\nAfter last presenting a Champions League match in the second group phase of the 2002-2003 season when Newcastle was defeated by Barcelona, 0-2, St James' Park welcomed guests from one of the best teams in Europe at the moment, Paris Saint-Germain. Despite facing PSG, finalists in the 2019-2020 Champions League, the support of around 50,000“Toon Army”, as Newcastle's loyal fans are called, made Eddi Howe's boys put in one of their best performances in Europe in club history.\nThey crushed PSG 4-1 on Thursday (5/10/2023) early morning WIB, which was welcomed by the supporters. This is Newcastle's biggest victory at home in the Champions League. Newcastle temporarily leads the competition in Group F with four points. They are ahead of three teams that have a better tradition in the Champions League, namely PSG, AC Milan, and Borussia Dortmund.\n\"We hope this victory gives us the confidence we need to succeed in this competition. There are still many matches left, but this result is a step forward,\" said Newcastle Manager Eddie Howe as quoted by the BBC.\nThe victory over PSG also signals that Newcastle is confident with the playing approach that they want to exhibit in the Champions League. Instead of following in the footsteps of three other English teams, namely Manchester City, Arsenal, and Manchester United, who glorify dominant football, Newcastle played more pragmatically.\nThis shows that Howe is being realistic with the lack of experience from the majority of his players on the biggest stage in Europe. Practically, only Sandro Tonali has experience playing in the semifinals of the Champions League last season with AC Milan.\nOn the other hand, he is also confident in his players' ability to defend. Newcastle is the team with the best defense in the 2022-2023 English Premier League, having only conceded 33 goals in 38 matches. This record puts them on par with the English champions, City.\nAlso read: Middle East Prestige Contest at St James' Park\nWe hope that this victory will give us the confidence needed to succeed in this competition.\nDuring last September, Newcastle also recorded five matches without conceding a goal. The solidity of the back line helped The Magpies earn a point from AC Milan's home ground in the Champions League as well as eliminate City in the English League Cup.\nIn the match against PSG, The Magpies only recorded 27 percent ball possession. Meanwhile, the visiting team was allowed to execute a more superior playing style by holding the ball through a collection of 73 percent ball possession. Howe realized the favorite attacking tactics of PSG Coach Luis Enrique, who equipped his players with excellent individual qualities, including Kylian Mbappe, which was extremely difficult to match by his squad.\nEven though they were reluctant to compete with \"Les Parisiens\" for possession of the ball, Newcastle displayed high pressing with a high defensive block. They used man-to-man protection when PSG built an attack through goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.\nThe first goal scored by Miguel Almiron (17') and the closing goal by Fabian Schar (90+1') for Newcastle were a result of that tactic. They managed to snatch possession of the ball from PSG in the opponent's third of the field, which culminated in a goal.\nAlso read: Newcastle United's Difficult Situation\n\"We know that PSG will not change their attacking style of play showcased in every match. There may be moments where they can penetrate our defense, but when our supporters push us, we can create opportunities,\" said Newcastle's center-back, Dan Burn, as reported by UEFA's website.\nBurn also contributed a goal through a header in the 39th minute. The opportunity was created through a free kick. Later, midfielder Sean Longstaff scored the third goal against PSG with a powerful shot that could not be blocked by Donnarumma in the 50th minute. The only consolation goal for PSG was scored by left wing back Lucas Hernandez in the 56th minute.\nApart from the matter of goals, The Magpies also played much more effectively in utilizing opportunities compared to PSG. They produced eight shots on target out of 12 attempts. Meanwhile, Les Parisiens only created two shots on goal out of 11 attempts.\nNewcastle's defense forced the majority of PSG players' shots to come from outside the penalty box. PSG's best chance, aside from Hernandez's goal, was Dembele's shot from inside the penalty box when the game was only four minutes old. The shot narrowly missed the right post of Newcastle's goal.\nFrom the game side, Newcastle mostly ran, pressed and played disciplinedly to close down space. They only recorded 394 touches compared to PSG's 846 touches.\nAlso read: Rico Lewis' brilliant future in Guardiola's hands\nNo Newcastle player was able to record a minimum of 50 touches in the match. Kieran Trippier, the right-wing back, had the most ball possession with 49 touches among Newcastle players.\nOn the other hand, there are nine PSG players who recorded more than 50 touches of the ball. In fact, Achraf Hakimi collected 136 touches that depict the Moroccan player's role as the axis for Les Parisiens' gameplay.\nThe passing accuracy of Bruno Guimaraes and his friends was also poor, with only 68 percent of their passes being successful. Meanwhile, PSG produced 88 percent accurate passes.\nWith dominance in his team's game, Enrique considers the end result too harsh for his team. Nevertheless, he regards that Newcastle played very well.\n\"This match was very difficult for the coach. I think we started the game with a very good attitude. Honestly, I think the final score was not fair,\" said Enrique.\nWriter:\nMUHAMMAD IKHSAN MAHAR |\nEditor:\nEMILIUS CAESAR ALEXEY",
