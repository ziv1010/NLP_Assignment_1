  "body_text": "Barcelona vs Bayern Munich offer: Get 40/1 on both teams to score with Parimatch\nParimatch is offering new customers the chance to back both teams to score between Barcelona and Bayern Munich in the Champions League\nTonight, the football world turns its gaze to the Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys, where Barcelona will face off against Bayern Munich in a highly anticipated Champions League encounter. This clash brings together two of Europe's most formidable clubs, boasting a combined 11 Champions League titles.\nParimatch is offering new customers an enticing 40/1 odds on both teams finding the net tonight.\nBarcelona, with the slight edge of playing at home, are considered favourites despite their temporary relocation from Camp Nou due to renovations. Hansi Flick, who took over managerial duties from Xavi this summer, has seamlessly transitioned into his role at Barcelona. Flick's credentials are impressive, having previously led Bayern Munich to a stunning six-trophy haul in one season, including a memorable 8-2 demolition of Barcelona in the quarter-finals.\nHaving settled into life in Spain with aplomb, Flick's Barcelona have been dominant in La Liga, securing nine victories out of their first ten matches. Their latest triumph, a commanding 5-1 victory over Sevilla, sees them topping the league table by three points with an enviable goal difference. The Catalans have been imperious at home this season, maintaining a perfect record and scoring 20 goals across five matches at their temporary home ground.\nBayern Munich, under the stewardship of Vincent Kompany following his tenure at Burnley, are also enjoying success domestically. They currently lead the Bundesliga on goal difference after a decisive 4-0 win against Stuttgart ended their brief three-match winless spell. The German giants find themselves embroiled in a fiercely competitive title race with just four points separating the top seven teams.\nBoth clubs have garnered three points from their opening two Champions League fixtures. Barcelona rebounded from an initial defeat at Monaco with a resounding 5-0 victory over Young Boys. Meanwhile, Bayern showcased their attacking prowess with a staggering 9-2 win against Dinamo Zagreb before suffering a narrow 1-0 loss to Aston Villa.\nHistorically, Bayern Munich have had the upper hand in recent encounters between these titans, winning the last six meetings. However, tonight presents an opportunity for Barcelona to reverse this trend and assert their dominance on home soil.\nAs anticipation builds for this evening's match-up, fans and pundits alike are eager to see if Barcelona can break their losing streak against Bayern and further cement Flick's successful start in charge. With both teams eager to secure vital points in the group stage, spectators can expect an enthralling contest filled with high stakes and drama.\nClick here to back the offer from Parimatch.\nHow to claim the Parimatch sign up offer for England vs Greece\nIt could not be simpler claiming the Parimatch's sign up offer ahead of this weekend's huge Premier League clash:\n- Click this link which will take you to the Parimatch sign up page.\n- Opt-in to this promotion\n- Deposit £5 through card payment or Apple Pay\n- Place a £1 bet at the normal price on Barcelona v Bayern Munich - Both teams to score - Yes, which starts at 20:00 PM UK time on Wednesday 23/10/2024\n- If the bet comes in, your bet will be paid at the normal price in cash and the extra amount will be credit in Free Bets shortly after settlement to bring your odds up to the respective offer you chose\n- Free Bets expire in 7 days\nTerms and conditions\nHere are the key terms and conditions from Parimatch:\n- 18+\n- New customers only.\n- Offer valid from 17:30 UK time on 20/10/2024 until 20:00 UK time on 23/10/2024\n- Free Bets expire 7 days after accreditation if not used\n- No cash-out.\nThe following do not qualify for this promotion:\n- void bets, BetBoosts, Special Markets, Enhanced Accas and bets placed with Bonus Funds; and\n- qualifying bets which are Cashed Out, or Partially Cashed Out.\nYou free bets:\n- can be used on any sports market unless stated in the restrictions;\n- bets must be placed at combined odds 2.00+ or greater;\n- cannot be used on virtual sports;\n- can be used as one whole bet or as a number of smaller bets;\n- will only return profit exceeding your total stake;\n- must be placed separately from real cash bets; and\n- will expire 7 days after accreditation if not used.\nOther terms\n- The promoter is BV Gaming Limited, (The “Promoter”) trading as “Parimatch”, a company registered in Gibraltar (company number 42734) with its registered office at Suite 23, Portland House, Glacis Road, Gibraltar, GX11 1AA and trading from Suite 2:01, World Trade Center, Bayside Road, Gibraltar, GX11 1AA.\n- For customers betting in Euros the currency equivalent of £10 is €10.
