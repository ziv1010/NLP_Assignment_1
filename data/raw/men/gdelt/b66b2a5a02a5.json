The road to recovery was deemed too long for Varane, who has opted to hang up his boots and take up a coaching role at Como instead of going through yet another gruelling recovery.\nWith his playing career now in the rear-view mirror, here's 90min's five best moments of Varane's storied career.\n5. FA Cup triumph\nIn what proved to be the final game of his Manchester United career - and final full 90 minutes of his entire career - Raphael Varane put in the best performance of his time in England.\nVarane rolled back the years to put in a stoic performance alongside Lisandro Martinez at Wembley, pocketing Erling Haaland as United surprisingly beat rivals Manchester City to win the FA Cup.\nAnd although his United career didn't go to plan - thanks to injuries - Varane at least left the club on the highest of highs.\n4. El Clasico star\nFrom the very end of his career, to the very start.\nWay back in 2013 a fresh-faced Varane went toe-to-toe with Lionel Messi, David Villa, Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta, in a two-legged Copa del Rey semi-final tie and came up trumps.\nVarane was utterly exceptional in both games, becoming the second youngest foreign player to ever score in El Clasico to earn a draw at the Santiago Bernabeu. He then added another in the second leg at the Camp Nou to earn Madrid a spot in the final.\nTop class.\n3. Champions League wins\nWe're going to say something really glaringly obvious right now:\nIt's very hard to win the Champions League.\nGianluigi Buffon couldn't do it, nor could Diego Maradona, nor could R9 Ronaldo.\nVarane has won the Champions League on four occasions. That is pretty damn remarkable if you ask us.\nHe was a key reason why Madrid managed to win so many European Cups during his tenure at the club too, starting three of the four finals his team won.\n2. A banner 2018\nIn 2018, Varane was the undisputed best defender in the world.\nIn fact, he was one of the best footballers in the world overall.\nThe trophy cabinet proves it:\n- FIFA World Cup winner\n- UEFA Champions League winner\n- FIFA Club World Cup winner\n- FIFPro World 11\n- UEFA Team of the Year\n- UEFA Champions League squad of the season\n- FIFA World Cup Fantasy Team\n- FIFA World Cup Dream Team\n- IFFHS Men's World Team\nSay no more.\n1. World Cup winner\nWhat stands above all the accolades Varane won in 2018 is the World Cup triumph with France.\nIn many ways, Varane's performances en route to Les Bleus' second ever World Cup triumph will go down as the defining moment of his entire footballing career.\nThe centre-back showed the best form of his career during the tournament in Russia, helping his side keep four clean sheets - including one in a mammoth defensive effort against Belgium in the semi-finals.\nVarane even popped up with a rare, and crucial, goal in the quarter-final win over Uruguay.\nHe was the MVP of the tournament for France.",
