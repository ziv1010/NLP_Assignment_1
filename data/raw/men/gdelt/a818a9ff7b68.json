We are Newcastle United.\n“The player has a responsibility here to be part of a team and part of a squad – you have to act in the right way. So that is also at play here.\n“We will make sure that any player earns the right to train with the group. No player can expect to act poorly and train with the group as normal.”\nIsak is understood to have undergone treatment and light training at a deserted training ground on Monday and it remains to be seen whether he will have any involvement in the club’s pre-season fixtures against Espanyol and Atletico Madrid this weekend.\nThe striker faces clear-the-air talks with Howe, with his situation becoming seemingly more complicated by the day as a difficult transfer window threatens to spiral further out of control.\nNewcastle tabled an improved club record bid for RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko on Monday in an effort to beat Manchester United to the punch, but developments since suggest the 22-year-old is more likely to head for Old Trafford than St James’ Park.\nThat would represent the latest blow in a transfer window which has already seen the Magpies miss out on major targets Dean Huijsen, Bryan Mbeumo, Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro, James Trafford and Liam Delap.\nMeanwhile, Everton have completed the signing of midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall from Chelsea for an undisclosed fee, reported to be around £28million.\nThe 26-year-old, who joined Chelsea in a £30m deal from Leicester just over a year ago, has agreed a five-year contract with Everton.\nDewsbury-Hall becomes the fifth summer signing for the Toffees, who will play home games at their new Hill Dickinson Stadium this season, having turned Charly Alcaraz’s loan into a permanent deal and signed Thierno Barry, Mark Travers and Adam Aznou.\n“I’m so, so excited to get started,” Dewsbury-Hall said. “Just sitting here in the stadium, it’s unbelievable.\n“I’m honestly very excited, my family’s excited. There’s a real buzz about this. It feels right for me. So just that alone gives me the motivation and the extra determination to show everybody, to prove a point and have a really successful time here.”\nDewsbury-Hall progressed through Leicester’s academy and had loan spells at Blackpool and Luton before establishing himself in the Foxes’ first team.\nFollowing his switch to Chelsea in 2024, he made 36 appearances for the London club in all competitions and featured in all 15 of their Conference League matches as Enzo Maresca’s side lifted the trophy.",
