  "body_text": "Alan Shearer was left bemused by Erik ten Hag’s recent description of Manchester United as ‘one of the most dynamic and entertaining teams’ in the Premier League, while Micah Richards was also stunned by the comment.\nSpeaking after United’s 1-1 draw with relegation-battlers Burnley, Ten Hag insisted his side were ‘playing good football’ and said criticism of the team was ‘weird’.\nManchester United have claimed just one win inside 90 minutes since mid-March and taken seven points from their past six league games.\n‘We are one of the most dynamic and entertaining teams in the league at this moment,’ Ten Hag told BBC’s Match of the Day.\n‘We are creating loads of chances by playing good football. Every team gives up opportunities. But when it is up to us, it is weird.’\nShearer could not have disagreed with Ten Hag more while ex-Manchester City defender Richards barely believed he had said the quote, with United currently sixth in the Premier League, 13 points outside the Champions League spots and 26 adrift of leaders Arsenal.\nThe Red Devils have reached back-to-back FA Cup finals but made incredibly hard work of their semi-final against Coventry City, blowing a three-goal lead before beating the Championship outfit on penalties.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

Repeat that quote please,’ Richards said on The Rest Is Football podcast.\nAfter host and former England striker Gary Lineker re-read the quote, Richards responded: ‘[They’re the most dynamic and entertaining team] off the field, maybe, with all the controversy. He can’t be talking about on the pitch, deary me!’\nPremier League legend Shearer was also confused by Ten Hag’s assessment and said United could have conceded ‘five or six goals’ against Burnley.\n‘No, they’re not [one of the most dynamic and entertaining teams in the league],’ Shearer said.\nMore Trending\n‘You just don’t know what team is going to turn up. They get a decent result one week and they’re hopeless the next, you don’t know what you’re going to get. But that’s not true.\n‘Burnley played really well at Old Trafford and sliced through United with ease, although that’s not difficult these days. If they had taken their chances they could have scored five or six goals.’\nDespite flattering to deceive yet again at home to Burnley, it appeared Manchester United would clinch the three points after Antony broke the deadlock on 79 minutes.\nBut Andre Onana conceded a late penalty and Zeki Amdouni scored from the spot to earn Burnley, sitting second from bottom, a valuable point in their fight against relegation.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Arsenal star Declan Rice calls out Man Utd legend over unfair goalscoring criticism\nMORE: Jorginho expected to sign new contract at Arsenal\nMORE: Owen Hargreaves makes prediction for Arsenal’s must-win clash with Manchester United",
