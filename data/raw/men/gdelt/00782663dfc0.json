  "body_text": "Manchester United return to Premier League football on Sunday afternoon as they welcome West Ham United to the Theatre of Dreams. United sit in 15th place in the Premier League with 39 points with the Hammers sitting in 17th place with 37 points, meaning they could go ahead of United if they beat them at Old Trafford.\nUnited earned their place in the final of the UEFA Europa League on Thursday evening at Old Trafford with a 4-1 victory over Athletic Club – a 7-1 aggregate victory after United came back from 1-0 down, scoring four goals in the 18 minutes of the clash, still 3-1 ahead on aggregate after Bilbao scored, which is not too shabby.\nUnited will need to prioritise the Europa League final where they will face Tottenham Hotspur, who sit between United and the Hammers at the time of writing with the winner of the clash earning a UEFA Champions League place next season with six English teams playing in the competition, which should be interesting.\nPredicted Manchester United Starting XI – 3-4-2-1\nBayindir;\nLindelof, Maguire, Shaw;\nAmass, Eriksen, Mainoo, Dorgu;\nAmad, Fernandes;\nMount\nGoalkeeper: Bayindir\nAltay Bayindir should be starting more this season with three remaining Premier League matches, which should either show that he has the ability to be a United goalkeeper, or it will put him in the shop window ahead of a possible transfer from the Old Trafford club in the summer, which is expected to be busy for United.\nAndre Onana can be rested for the next few matches to keep him fit for the Europa League final against Spurs as I am sure he will be chosen to feature for United in that match. I am more confident with him in goal than Bayindir, who has conceded eight goals in his last two appearances in the Premier League.\nUnited will need to sort out whether Onana or Bayindir will be at the Old Trafford club next season as it has not been great with either on goal. Onana has conceded a massive number of goals in two seasons and there is something to solve there – whether it was the defensive injuries and issues or his confidence – who knows?\nDefenders: Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw\nUnited’s defence should be changed for Sunday’s match with players seeking ti remain fit for the Europa League final in little under a fortnight. Victor Lindelof should start on the right of the back three as he has done well for the club recently. It would allow rotation and other players to find full fitness ahead of the final.\nHarry Maguire might be needed to start in the centre of the back three against West Ham due to his experience in the game and his performances this season. The former captain of the club has impressed Amorim this season and the fact he can add some attacking threat is also something that will be positive for the club going forward.\nLuke Shaw should start on the left side of the back three, a position that he has played in before and done quite well in with United suffering injuries to central defensive players – as is the case at this stage of the season. Playing at left back may not be an option anymore, but he can still offer the club something.\nMidfield: Amass, Eriksen, Mainoo, Dorgu\nThe midfield four has some talented players who could fill in for the ones who have been starting recently. On the right side of the midfield, Harry Amass could start after his meteoric rise into the first team this season. Predominantly a left back, Amass has shown strength on the right, offering another option should it be needed.\nPatrick Dorgu should start on the left side of the midfield, despite him playing a number of matches recently. There is no strength in depth in these positions at the moment with Noussair Mazraoui suffering from tiredness after the matches he has played this season and Diogo Dalot being on the sidelines injured.\nIn the centre of the midfield, Christian Eriksen and Kobbie Mainoo should both start. Eriksen still has something to give this club this season, which could end on a high for him should United win the Europa League. Mainoo has been tested following his injury and this could be the match to start him and test him some more.\nAttack: Amad, Mount, Fernandes\nThe attacking line could change ahead of the West Ham clash. Rasmus Hojlund has featured for United a lot this season and he should get some rest, if it is an option. Mason Mount could start as the striker, considering the goals he has scored in his last two appearances, scoring twice against Bilbao and once against Brentford.\nAmad should be ready to start on Sunday after returning from injury a few weeks back. He has performed consistently in the last few matches and has done something good in all his performances. It is great to see him back in action as he could have been out for the rest of the season.\nBruno Fernandes should also start as United will need players of his caliber against the Hammers. Fernandes can find something for United on any day of the week. The experience the captain puts in for the club is second to none and you can see why a Saudi Arabian club is interested in his services, not that he is for sale.\nSubstitutes: Heaton; Yoro, Fredricson, Kamason; Casemiro, Ugarte, Mantato; Hojlund, Obi\nUnited can have a bench of nine players in the Premier League. Andre Onana could be rested for this match giving Tom Heaton another appearance on the bench for the club. It is possible that he could feature for the club one last time before the expiry of his contract this summer, unless it is renewed?\nIn defence, Leny Yoro, Tyler Fredricson and Jaydan Kamason could all feature on the bench with one or two of them featuring for the club should defence changes be required – and they will. In the midfield, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Bendito Mantato could all have some involvement from the bench.\nIn attack, United could just have the experience of Rasmus Hojlund and the raw talent of Chido Obi on the bench against the Hammers, which would be good to see. Amorim will need to blood in a number of academy players into the squad this season, especially ahead of the friendlies in Asia at the end of the season.\nWritten by Paul\nDiscover more from Daily Man Utd News\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.",
