Company revenues, reflecting the long-term volume decline in the newspaper and magazines market, were £1,064.0m (FY2024: £1,103.7m / £1,082.9m on a 52-week basis), in line with internal forecasts. Revenues from new verticals increased 16%.\nAdjusted profit after tax was £27.0m (FY2024: £24.7m), an increase of £2.3m, with net finance costs £2.6m lower than FY2024. The Company's cost out programme continues to perform in line with expectations, delivering £4.9m of annualised savings in FY2025 (FY2024: £5.6m). The Company ended the year in a Bank net cash position of £3.3m of (FY2024: Bank net debt of £11.0m). Adjusted EPS increased 0.8 pence to 11.1 pence (FY2024: 10.3p).\nThe Company's free cash flow improved to £36.1m (FY2024: £7.3m / £23.0m 52-week basis*), in part due to the receipt of £6.9m of one-off items, which included the final instalments from the administrators of McColl's, taking the total payments received from the administrators to £5.4m, 98% of the total stated debt balance.\nSmiths News continues to implement its ongoing programme of internal investment, increasing investment by £2.0m per annum through to FY2027, to support delivery of the Company's core capabilities.\nOver the course of FY2025, the Company has continued to focus on maintaining shareholder returns whilst simultaneously developing additional revenue streams for the business that leverage the Company's existing network and expertise to drive long-term value creation and mitigate the long-established and gradual decline of newspaper and magazine volumes.\nSmiths News is an established expert in early morning supply chain management, and the Company's strategy remains to build on these foundations to expand its services across additional verticals including end-to-end services and final mile logistics.\nThe Company continues to apply the capital allocation policy which was updated following refinancing in May 2024. With higher profit after tax, the proposed total ordinary dividend increased 8% to 5.55p (FY2024: 5.15p) being 2x cover. A special dividend of 3.0p (FY2024: 2.0p) is also proposed, taking total distributions to 8.55p (FY2024: 7.15p).\n* The impact of the 53rd week in FY2024 was additional revenue of £20.8m, additional adjusted operating profit of £0.9m and a net cash outflow of £15.7m.\nNews and magazines business\nThe news and magazines business delivered a pleasing performance in FY2025 and continues to generate the majority of Smiths News' revenue and profits. Against a backdrop of long-term market decline - which continues to be in line with internal expectations - the Company is working closely with retailers to maximise commercial opportunities across the category, alongside a focus on continual improvement to our customer proposition.\nThe collectables market, which has a separate demand cycle to newspapers and magazines, delivered an excellent performance in FY2025. Recognising this growth, the Company made a deliberate decision to focus efforts on these margin accretive products during the year in order to capitalise on momentum. Whilst some sales are non-repeatable, the Company believes the strength of the collectables market will continue into FY2026, supported by the 30th anniversary of Pokémon and the 2026 Men's Football World Cup.\nNew verticals\nWe continue to develop a number of initiatives as part of the Company's strategic vision to diversify the business and broaden revenue and profit streams through opportunities that complement our established news and magazines operations, and these initiatives continue to evolve.\nOur growth verticals continue to build, producing a 16% increase in revenues. Profit was £1.4m (FY2024: £2.0m), reflecting planned investments, including trials, capability and capacity.\nWithin recycling, we see good demand from our existing newspaper and magazines customers, with volumes having increased by 49% to over 2,500 tonnes in the last 12 months, a key performance metric.\nWe welcomed Adam Wylie as Managing Director of Recycling at the end of FY2025. Adam brings a wealth of highly applicable industry experience and is already delivering valuable market intelligence to inform new market opportunities, including the use of partnerships and waste brokers.\nIn FY2025, we undertook a trial seeking to extend our recycling services to new customers along selected existing delivery routes in the Northwest. The trial has now concluded and provided the Company with valuable insights into the market dynamics, alongside the most efficient routes to market. Adam is now leading the development of our strategy, targeting scaled retailers where adoption is supported by both the recently introduced workplace recycling regulations[1], and the expected introduction of future regulation[2]. With an extended footprint, Smiths News is in a strong position moving into FY2026 to leverage its network to deliver its recycling services.\nOur second key vertical focuses on the delivery of additional categories to existing customers, such as books and home entertainment. Smiths News already delivers to a number of customers in this vertical, including leading supermarkets and high street retailers. In February 2025, the Company commenced a trial with leading greetings cards brand Hallmark, and the offering is now live across circa 175 stores with over 63,000 cards sold in FY2025.\nIn the final mile services vertical, where we are specifically focused on delivering new products to new customers and locations, the small-scale trial for the delivery of specialist engineering and manufacturing parts was well received. Further to the trial, the Company was invited to tender for, and has now been awarded, a multi-year contract to undertake \"in-night\" deliveries.\nInternal investment programme\nAs previously announced, Smiths News commenced a three-year internal investment programme in FY2025, increasing investment by £2.0m per annum through to FY2027. Thereafter, investment is expected to revert to a normalised level of £4.0m per annum.\nThe programme seeks to optimise warehouse operations and enhance existing capabilities and efficiencies, without disrupting service to the Company's existing customers.\nWe successfully implemented a new warehouse management system at one of our key regional hubs in the Period and put the foundations in place for a new transport management system, with initial implementation expected in FY2026.\nSmiths News has simultaneously invested in its team, ensuring the Company has the skillset and talent to support the news and magazines business and to drive our new verticals. As noted above, at the end of FY2025, we welcomed a new Managing Director of Recycling and have continued to add skills in the wider management team. This investment ensures the business is well-positioned to capitalise on the opportunities available across all four verticals.\nOperational efficiencies\nSmiths News continues to identify operational efficiencies to optimise our network and services. The Company maintained the year-on-year delivery of cost savings despite the challenge of rising wages, delivering £4.9m in the Period (FY2024: £5.6m), focused on driving efficiencies in the business, streamlining operations, and reducing variable costs associated with volume declines.\nCash position\nCash generation - a core foundation of the Smiths News business model - remained positive in FY2025, with free cash flow at £36.1m (FY2024: £7.3m, £23.0m on a 52-week basis*), including the benefit of £6.9m one-off receipts in the year, being £5.4m from the McColls administrator and a £1.5m tax refund in respect of the return of surplus from the Smiths News pension scheme.\nThe £5.4m receipts from the administrators of McColl's, comprised £1.6m in H1 2025, a second payment of £1.7m, and a final payment of £2.0m, both received in H2 2025. This took the total payments received from the administrators to 98% of the original debt balance.\nAverage Bank net cash of £3.3m was achieved in the Period (FY2024: average Bank net debt of £11.7m), and closing Bank net cash improved to £3.3m (FY2024: £11.0m Bank net debt).\nPeople\nIn January 2025, we welcomed Manju Malhotra as an independent non-executive director, replacing Denise Collis who retired from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM in January 2025. In March 2025, Paul Baker announced his intention to step down from his role as Chief Financial Officer, with Richard Clay joining the business in February 2026 to assume the role. George Cooper, currently Group Financial Controller at the Company, will assume the role of Interim Chief Financial Officer (a non-board appointment) to cover the period between Paul's departure and Richard's arrival.\nWe wish to take this opportunity to thank both Denise and Paul for their outstanding contribution to Smiths News. We are extremely grateful for the dedication and insights they have provided the business, and we wish them every success going forward.\nWe would also like to thank all our colleagues at Smiths News for their ongoing commitment to delivering first class customer service in an intense and time critical market. We remain committed to investing in our staff, and in creating a positive and inclusive culture that supports employees and enables our team to thrive.\nDividend\nFurther to a strong financial and cash generative performance, and in line with our capital allocation policy, the Company proposes to pay a final ordinary dividend of 3.80 pence per share on 5 February 2026 (FY2024: 3.40 pence per share) to shareholders on the register at close of business on 9 January 2026, which will bring the total proposed dividend for the year to 5.55 pence per share. The ex-dividend date will be 8 January 2026.\nAdditionally, the Company proposes to pay a special dividend of 3.0 pence per share, to be paid alongside the final ordinary dividend on 5 February 2026, to shareholders on the register at close of business on 9 January 2026.\nOutlook\nWe have seen the positive momentum from FY2025 continue into FY2026, with the news and magazines business remaining resilient alongside ongoing strength in our collectables activities. In addition, we continue to refine our strategic focus to better utilise our early morning market expertise.\nWe remain committed to further extending our operational footprint into new verticals by leveraging our early morning, end-to-end supply chain solutions and utilising our high-density network and unrivalled experience and skillset. The Company has delivered a good start to trading in the current financial year and expects to deliver results in line with current market expectations*.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nOverview\nIn FY2025 the Company traded ahead of expectation, maintaining adjusted operating profit at £39.1m and increasing adjusted profit after tax to £27.0m despite one week less trading in the reporting period. This has led to an 8% increase in the ordinary dividend, paid at 2x cover in line with the Company's capital allocation policy. The Company continues to demonstrate good cash generation, augmented this year by additional one-off receipts of £6.9m, including £5.4m from the McColls administrator, which support the proposal of a 3.0p (£7.3m) special dividend, compared to 2.0p (£4.8m) in FY2024.\nThe Company's financial results in FY2025 represented 52 weeks of trading, compared to 53 weeks in FY2024. The additional week benefitted revenue in FY2024 by £20.8m (1.9%) and adjusted operating profit by £0.9m and did not include any significant one-off items.\nRevenues of £1,064.0m (FY2024: £1,103.7m), were down 3.6% on the prior year, of which 1.9% related to the 53rd week. The remaining movement excluding the 53rd week of -1.7% was below the historic trend of -3% to -5%. Additional sales of collectables in FY2025 more than offset revenues made in FY2024 from the Men's UEFA Football Championships, while the decline in revenue from newspapers and magazines was within with our long-term guidance of -3% to -5%.\nAdjusted operating profit of £39.1m was an increase of £0.9m excluding the impact of the 53rd week with beneficial margin mix and continuing operation cost focus driving improved performance.\nAdjusted profit after tax increased by £2.3m to £27.0m with lower debt levels and banking fees reducing net interest cost (£2.6m lower) and a lower effective tax rate owing to the successful resolution of overpayments made in previous tax years. Consequently, Adjusted EPS increased by 0.8p to 11.1p and this has resulted in a total ordinary dividend of 5.55p for the year in line with the Company's capital allocation policy.\nAdjusting items after tax were a credit of £1.3m (FY2024 credit of £0.8m) and included a release of the provision for McColls receivables (FY2025: £3.7m; FY2024: £0.6m), as well as legal expenses of £0.7m and technology programme improvement costs of £0.7m.\nFree cash flow of £36.1m (FY2025: £7.3m) included a working capital inflow (£4.1m) compared to an outflow in FY2024 (£17.0m), both the result of timing differences in the Company's normal working capital cycle. Excluding these movements, the FY2025 cash flow of £32.0m was higher than FY2024 £24.3m due to lower interest costs and higher income from adjusting items (FY2025: £5.1m inflow, FY2024: £0.4m outflow) which included £5.4m of cash recovered from the McColls administrator and £1.5m tax refund in respect of the return of surplus of the Smiths News pension scheme which occurred in FY2022.\nBank net debt improved by £14.3m from £11.0m (debt) in FY2024 to £3.3m (cash) in FY2025, the first time the Company has reported a net cash position but noting the working capital timing benefit of £4.1m during the year.\nA final ordinary dividend of 3.8p per share (£9.2m) is proposed by the Board, which makes a total full year ordinary dividend of 5.55p (£13.5m) an 8% increase compared to 5.15p in FY2024 (£12.5m). A special dividend of 3.0p (£7.3m) compared to 2.0p in FY2024 (£4.8m), is also proposed to be paid alongside the final ordinary dividend in February 2026 reflecting the distribution of one-off items received during the year.\nAdjusted results\nGroup\nRevenue\nRevenue was £1,064.0m (FY2024: £1,103.7m), down 3.6%, but 1.7% excluding the impact of the 53rd week in FY2024. Lower newspaper and magazines volumes were offset by the benefits of News UK and Midlands News Association contract wins (Q2 FY2024), cover price increases, increased sales of trading card and sticker collectables and increased revenue from new verticals.\nNewspaper revenue decreased by 3.1% excluding the impact of the 53rd week and the annualisation of FY2024 contract wins. Magazine revenue was down 4% excluding the 53rd week. Both newspapers and magazine revenue decline rates are within our long-term expectation of -3% to -5%.\nRevenue from collectables increased by 17% excluding the 53rd week, with good Premier League and Champions League football collections and the popularity of the current Pokémon series. The success of these ranges more than offset the year-on-year impact of the men's UEFA European Championships which benefitted FY2024.\nOperating profit\nAdjusted operating profit £39.1m was the same as FY2024 (£39.1m) and included the following items:\nProfit after tax\nNet finance charges of £3.3m (FY2024: £5.9m) were driven by a lower net debt, lower interest rates and the write-off of unamortised fees in FY2024 relating to the previous financing facility. Taxation of £8.8m (FY2024: £8.5m) was higher than the prior period due to higher profit before tax. Profit after tax of £27.0m (FY2024: £24.7m) was £2.3m higher than last year and has driven an increase in the ordinary dividend, in line with the Company's capital allocation policy.\nStatutory Results\nGroup\nStatutory profit after tax of £28.3m was a £2.8m increase on the prior year (FY2024: £25.5m), resulting from the £2.3m increase in Adjusted profit after tax described above and a £0.5m higher benefit from adjusting items (FY2025 £1.3m credit; FY2024: £0.8m credit).\nEarnings per share\nAdjusted basic earnings per share of 11.1p, was an increase of 0.8p on the prior year driven by the increase in earnings of the business, offset by an increase in the average number of shares as a result of the employee benefit trust holding fewer shares.\nStatutory basic earnings per share increased by 1.1p to 11.7p (FY2024: 10.6p) due to the benefit of adjusting items.\nDividends\nThe Board is proposing a final ordinary dividend of 3.80p per share (FY2024: 3.40p per share). The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 29 January 2026 and has not been included as a liability in these accounts. The Board is also proposing a special dividend of 3.0p per share. These dividend recommendations follow the capital allocation policy which was revised following the Company's refinancing in May 2024.\nThe proposed dividends will each be paid on 5 February 2026 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 9 January 2026. The ex-dividend date will be 8 January 2026.\nAdjusting items\nAdjusting items after tax was a net credit of £1.3m, compared to a net credit of £0.8m in the prior year period, both periods including a release of the provision for McColls receivables originally made in FY2022.\nTuffnells costs of £0.8m arose from professional fees incurred in responding to information requests from the Pensions Regulator in respect of its investigation into the Tuffnells defined benefit pension scheme (£0.7m), and an increase in provisions to settle insurance claims (£0.1m). Technology transformation costs of £0.7m related to enhancements made to technology infrastructure, and £0.1m of costs arose from simplifying the Group structure. The Company also recognised a £3.7m impairment reversal of the provision for McColl's receivables following final recoveries from the administrator. In total, the Company received £5.4m from the administrator, being 98% of the £5.5m receivable which was owing at the point of McColls administration. Of the initial provision of £4.4m, £4.3m has therefore been released (£0.6m in FY2024 and £3.7m in FY2025).\nIn the prior period, the Company also reversed the remaining impairment held on the Rascal joint venture of £0.3m and released insurance provisions made following Tuffnells entering into administration of £0.2m. These credits were partially offset by £0.1m of reorganisation costs in relation to simplifying the Group structure and £0.1m in respect of technology transformation costs.\nFurther information on these items can be found in Note 3 to the Group Financial Statements. Adjusting items are defined in the Glossary to the Group Financial Statements and present a further measure of the Company's performance. Excluding these items from profit metrics provides readers with helpful additional information on the performance of the business across periods because it is consistent with how the business performance is planned by, and reported to, the Board and the Executive Team. Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) should be considered in addition to, and are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements.\nFree cash flow\nFree cash flow of £36.1m (FY2024: £7.3m) was £28.8m higher than last year in part due to the impact of the 53rd week in FY2024, which was a net outflow of £15.7m and the benefit of £5.1m of adjusting items in FY2025 which included £5.4m of cash received from the McColls administrator.\nThere was a working capital inflow of £4.1m in FY2025 and an outflow of £17.0m in FY2024. The FY2025 inflow arose from increased collectables trading in the second half of the year, while the FY2024 outflow related to payments made to publishers in the 53rd week and part of the Company's normal working capital cycle at the end of the calendar month.\nCapital expenditure in the period was £4.5m (FY2024: £4.4m), an increase of £0.1m and including £1.2m of spend relating to the Company's three-year investment programme.\nLease payments of £6.5m (FY2024: £5.9m) increased by £0.6m, driven by rent renewals.\nNet interest and fees of £3.2m (FY2024: £5.0m) decreased by £1.8m, due to lower net debt.\nCash tax outflow of £8.8m (FY2024: £8.5m) was an increase on the prior period of £0.3m, owing to higher levels of profit.\nOther items include non-cash share-based payment expense.\nThe total cash impact of other Adjusting items was a net inflow of £5.1m (FY2024: outflow of £0.4m).\nIn the current period, there were two significant inflows; £5.4m was received from the McColls administrators, and a £1.5m tax refund in respect of the return of surplus of the Smiths News pension scheme which occurred in FY2022. Offsetting these items were £0.8m of professional fees in respect of the Pensions Regulator's investigation into the Tuffnells pension scheme, £0.7m relating to technology investments, £0.2m settlement of Tuffnells insurance claims and reorganisation costs of £0.1m.\nIn the prior period, the outflow of £0.4m resulted from the £0.2m settlement of Tuffnells insurance claims, technology investment of £0.1m, and reorganisation costs of £0.1m.\nA reconciliation of free cash flow to the net movement in cash and cash equivalents is given in the Glossary.\nNet cash/debt\nBank net cash closed the year at £3.3m compared to Bank net debt of £11.0m at 31 August 2024, an improvement of £14.3m.\nAverage daily bank net debt moved from £11.7m (net debt) in the prior period to average Bank net cash of £3.3m in the current period, reflecting good ongoing cash generation and benefitting from increased collectables trading within the working capital cycle.\nTotal dividends paid during the year amounted to £17.4m (FY2024: £10.8m), an increase of £6.6m. The FY2024 final ordinary dividend of £8.3m was paid in February 2025 (FY2024: £6.7m), alongside a special dividend of £4.9m, bringing the total dividend paid in respect of FY2024 to £17.4m. The Company also paid an interim ordinary dividend in July 2025 of £4.2m (FY2024: £4.2m).\nReported net debt is impacted by the timing of the Company's working capital cycle. The intra-month working capital cash flow cycle generates a routine and predictable cash swing within the overall bank facility of £40.0m (FY2024: £40.0m) at the period end. This results in a predictable fluctuation of net debt during the month compared to the closing net debt position.\nThe Company's Bank net cash: Bank EBITDA ratio improved to -0.1x (FY2024: Debt ratio of +0.3x) which is within our main leverage covenant ratio of +2.5x. We remain within all our other bank covenant tests at period end.\nA reconciliation of Bank net debt (which excludes IFRS 16 lease liabilities and unamortised arrangement fees) to the balance sheet and Bank EBITDA (which uses pre-IFRS16 lease accounting) to the profit and loss account is provided in the Glossary.\nPRINCIPAL AND EMERGING RISKS\nPrincipal Risks\nDuring FY2025 the Board and Audit Committee each continued to undertake an ongoing assessment of the principal and emerging risks, the Board having considered the performance of the business, its markets, the changing regulatory and macroeconomic landscape, the Company's future strategic direction and ambition as well as the heightened climate-related risk environment. In addition, in evaluating the Company's risk management and internal control processes, the Audit Committee has considered both internal and external audit reports and received confirmation from management that the Company's control frameworks have operated satisfactorily. The sustainable development risks considered throughout our business have been reviewed by the Sustainability Committee. The directors are therefore of the view that they have carried out a robust assessment of the Company's emerging and principal risks, including those that could threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.\nEmerging Risks\nEmerging risks are identified as either a new or previously unforeseen risk that we are now adding to our risk registers or a risk that was already on our radar and which has the potential to become a principal risk. Most risks identified as emerging are already reflected on our functional risk registers with a current risk rating of 'serious likelihood' or above. The Board has noted that in the execution of its growth and diversification strategy, new emerging risks have been identified. These emerging risks are managed through mitigating activities, such that the residual risk exposure is not considered significant. All new initiatives are planned in detail, with contingency and BCP plans in place and ongoing reviews conducted to evaluate the project execution against the original plan and to identify lessons learnt. We will continue to monitor potential risks relating to our growth and diversification strategy in the year ahead.\nKey Changes in the Year\nIn line with our usual procedures, a refresh of the Company's principal and emerging risks was conducted at the half and full year, taking into account changes in our business practices, our industry sector, the development of our three growth verticals and any other market changes across our business and industry sector, together with the increasing relevance of climate-related risks and cyber security incidents across all sectors and industries (in relation to the former, considering both transitional and physical-related risks to both our business and through our supply chain). This broad review was conducted through discussion with a cross-section of the Executive Leadership Team, senior management and the Audit Committee, who were each asked to consider the key risks (both in place and emerging) and the challenges facing the business (by reference to the existing principal risks), our current activities and controls that help address these risks, and future actions that may be taken to further mitigate these risks (where appropriate). The opportunity to review and refresh the Company's principal and emerging risks has resulted in all but one of our identified principal risks remaining stable, with a reduction in the acquisition and retention of labour risk in light of vacancies (internally and amongst the outsourced final mile delivery contractors) having stabilised at a consistently lower level each month and our colleague turnover comparing favourably versus our sector. Following this review, there remains a general alignment around the nature of risks, the risk ownership, the direction of travel, any mitigation actions to reduce the gross risk, and acceptance of remaining net risk.\nIn light of the above, we have therefore been able to maintain a stable number of principal risks but with a reduction in the number of emerging risks identified by the Board given that those events previously identified as emerging were, in fact, already broadly under review either as part of another principal or emerging risk.\nThe table below details each principal business risk, those aspects that would be impacted were the risk to materialise, our assessment of the current status of the risk and how each is mitigated.\nThe Audit Committee believes that it has been able to respond quickly and efficiently to the ever-evolving risk environment that the business regularly faces head on and have deployed effective risk management processes across the Company. Accordingly, the Audit Committee is satisfied (on behalf of the Board) that it has carried out a robust assessment of the principal and emerging risks that the Company faces (within the scope of the Board's risk appetite) as required by the 2018 edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code.\nGROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGroup Income Statement\nfor the 52-week period ended 30 August 2025\n*This measure is described in Note 1(4) of the accounting policies and the Glossary to the Accounts.

Accounting policies\n(1) Basis of consolidation\nSmiths News plc ('the Company') is a company incorporated in England, UK under the Companies Act 2006. The Group accounts for the 52-week period ended 30 August 2025 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 'Group') and the Group's interests in joint ventures. Subsidiary undertakings are included in the Group Accounts from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases. All significant subsidiary accounts are made up to 30 August 2025 and are included in the Group Accounts.\nUnless otherwise noted references to 2024 and 2025 relate to a 53-week period ended 31 August 2024 and the 52-week period ended 30 August 2025 as opposed to calendar year.\nThe Accounts were authorised for issue by the directors on 3 November 2024.\n(2) Accounting basis of preparation\nThe financial information contained within this preliminary announcement for the 52 weeks to 30 August 2025 and the 53 weeks to 31 August 2024 does not comprise statutory financial statements for the purpose of the Companies Act 2006 but is derived from those statements. The statutory accounts for Smiths News PLC for the 53 weeks to 31 August 2024 have been filed with the Registrar of Companies and those for the 52 weeks to 30 August 2025 will be filed following the Company's annual general meeting. The auditor's reports on the accounts for both the 52 weeks to 30 August 2025 and the 53 weeks to 31 August 2024 were unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis, and did not include a statement under Section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. The Annual Report and Accounts will be available for shareholders in December 2025.\nThe Accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis and are presented in Pound Sterling and rounded to £0.1m, except where otherwise indicated.\nThe Group Accounts have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (IFRS) in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nIntra-group balances and unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the Group Accounts. Unrealised gains and losses arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in these entities.\n(3) Going concern\nThe Group accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.\nWhen assessing the going concern of the Group, the directors have reviewed the period-to-date financial actuals, as well as detailed financial forecasts for the period up to 27 February 2027, the Company's interim reporting date for FY2027, the going concern period.\nThe Group currently has a net asset position of £9.5m as at 30 August 2025. All bank covenant tests were met at the balance sheet date. The key Bank Net (Cash)/Debt: Bank EBITDA ratio of (0.1)x was below the covenant test threshold of 2.5x.\nThe intra-month working capital cash flow cycle at Smiths News generates a routine and predictable cash swing and therefore a predictable fluctuation in Bank Net Debt during the course of the month compared to the closing Bank Net Debt position. The Group's average daily Bank Net Cash during the period was £3.3m (2024: £11.7m Bank Net Debt). The Company utilises a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) to manage the cash swing. At the balance sheet date, £36.4m of the RCF was available and the Company had £5.4m of cash on hand giving headroom of £41.8m. Additionally the Group held £2.8m in the EBT for the purpose of purchasing own shares.\n3i) Bank facility\nThe Group's banking facility comprises an RCF of £40.0m and an uncommitted accordion facility of £10.0m. The RCF is available less committed letters of credit amounting to £1.5m (see Note 15). The agreement is with HSBC and Santander.\nThe facility's current margin is 2.45% per annum over SONIA and has a final maturity date of 2 May 2028, following the extension exercised on the facility's first anniversary, and with the option of a one-year extension with lender consent on the second anniversary.\n3ii) Reverse stress testing\nThe Directors have prepared their base case forecast which represents their best estimate of cash flows over the going concern period, and in accordance with FRC guidance have prepared a reverse stress test that identifies either insufficient liquidity or breach of the Bank Net Debt: Bank EBITDA ratio that at peak debt would create a scenario which could lead to the facility being exhausted or becoming repayable on demand, respectively.\nA point of insufficient liquidity would occur in February 2027 if EBITDA was 56% below the Board approved three-year plan. The directors consider the likelihood of this level of downturn to be remote based on:\n· current trading which is in line with expectations;\n· period-on-period declines in revenues would have to be significantly greater than historical trends;\n· 93% of contracts secured with publishers to 2029; and\n· the Company continues to trade with adequate profit to service its debt covenants.\n3iii) Mitigating actions\nIn the event the break environment scenario went from being remote to possible then management would seek to take mitigating actions to maintain liquidity and compliance with the bank facility covenants. The options within the control of management would be to:\n· Optimise liquidity by working capital management of the peak-to-trough intra-month movement. Utilising existing vendor management finance arrangements;\n· Utilise arrangements with retailers and optimise contractual payment cycles to suppliers which would improve liquidity headroom;\n· Not pay planned dividend payments;\n· Delay non-essential capex projects;\n· Cancel discretionary annual bonus payments;\n· Increase the principal facility amount by exercising the £10m accordion option in the RCF Facility; and\n· Identify other overhead and depot savings.\nMore extreme mitigating actions would also be available if the scenario arose.\nThe Company has vendor finance arrangements in place where it has the ability to request early payment of invoices at a small discount, the payments are non-recourse and the invoices are considered settled from both sides once payment is received. The Company has not made use of this facility in the current or prior periods, nor since the balance sheet date.\n3iv) Assessment\nHaving considered the above and the funding requirements of the Group and Company, the directors are confident that headroom under the bank facility remains adequate, future covenant tests can be met and there is a reasonable expectation that the business can meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of greater than 12 months (being an assessment period of 16 months) from the date of approval of the Group Financial Statements. For this reason, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements and no material uncertainty has been identified.\n(4) Alternate performance measures\nIn reporting financial information, the Group presents alternative performance measures (APMs), which are not defined or specified under the requirements of IFRS.\nThe Group believes that these APMs (listed in the Glossary), are not considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures but provide stakeholders with additional helpful information on the performance of the business. These APMs are consistent with how the business performance is planned and reported to the Board and Executive Leadership Team.\nThe APMs do not have standardised meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n(5) Estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of these accounts requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nKey accounting judgements\nThe significant judgements made in the accounts are:\nRevenue recognition\nThe Group recognises the wholesale sales price for its sales of newspapers and magazines. The Group is considered to be the principal based on the following indicators of control over its inventory: discretion to establish prices; it holds some of the risk of obsolescence once in control of the inventory on returns; and has the responsibility of fulfilling the performance obligation on delivery of inventory to its customers. If the Group were considered to be the agent, revenue and cost of sales would reduce by £898.2m (2024: £937.3m).\nAdjusting items\nAdjusting items of income or expense are excluded in arriving at adjusted operating profit to present a further measure of the Group's performance. Each adjusting item is considered to be significant in nature and/or quantum, non-recurring in nature and/or considered to be unrelated to the Group's ordinary activities or consistent with items treated as adjusting in prior periods. Excluding these items from profit metrics provides readers with helpful additional information on the performance of the business across periods because it is consistent with how the business performance is planned by, and reported to, the Board and the Executive Leadership Team.\nThe classification of adjusting items requires significant management judgement in considering the nature and intentions of a transaction. Adjusted measures are defined with other APMs in the Glossary.\nBased on the nature of the transactions, adjusting items after tax was a credit of £1.3m (2024: credit of £0.8m) and a breakdown is included within Note 3.\nContingent liabilities\nDuring the period the Group has responded to information requests from the Pensions Regulator in respect of its investigation relating to the Tuffnells defined benefit pension scheme and the Company's former period of ownership of Tuffnells. Management has, supported by external legal advice, applied judgement in concluding the matter to be disclosed as a contingent liability, with further details included in Note 20.\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nThe key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next period are as follows.\nProperty provision\nThe Group holds a provision which estimates the future liabilities to restore leased premises to an agreed standard at the date the lease is terminated. The provision is calculated using assumptions which include the length of time properties will be occupied, the discount rate applied, inflation and the future costs of restoration and the condition of the property at the end of occupation.\nA change in any of these assumptions could materially impact the provision balance. Refer to Note 19 for further details on the sensitivity of the assumptions used to calculate the property provision. The property provision's carrying value at the balance sheet date was £4.6m (2024: £5.2m).\n(6) Revenue\nRevenue from wholesale distribution\nRevenue from wholesale distribution is recognised when products and services have been delivered to and receipted by customers and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer's acceptance of the products or services.\nRevenue is earned from the wholesale of products, from charges for services, being the sortation, delivery, merchandising and return of products, and from the sale of recyclable returns waste. Products sold and handled are principally newspapers, magazines and collectables, but also include other items such as books and greeting cards. Certain products are sold to retailers on a sale or return basis and estimation is made of the expected returns as outlined further below.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue includes income from services to collect recyclate waste from customers, the short-term use of storage and space in depots and management fees for support provided to third parties.\nReturns reserve\nSale of wholesale products are typically made on a sale or return basis, the Group estimates a value of expected returns from retailers. Likewise, as the publishers are required to provide the Group with credit for any purchase returns, so a purchase returns reserve is also required. The key estimates used in calculating the period end reserve are rates of returns (based on historical tends), average shelf life of the product types and average margin of each product type. These estimates are similarly applied to calculate the credit for purchase returns.\nRevenue for goods supplied with a right of return is stated net of the value of any returns. Newspapers and magazines are often sold with retrospective volume discounts based on aggregate net sales. Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated volume discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discount and returns, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A returns reserve accrual and discount accrual (included in trade and other payables) is recognised for expected volume discounts and refunds payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. A right to the returned goods (included in other debtors) is recognised for the products expected to be returned.\nNo element of financing is deemed present because the sales are made with short credit terms, which is consistent with market practice.\nA receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered, since this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.\n(7) Cost of sales and gross profit\nThe Group considers cost of sales to equate to cost of inventories recognised as an expense and distribution costs as these are considered to represent for the Group direct costs of making a sale.\nGross profit is equal revenue less cost of sales.\n(8) Taxation\nTax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable based on the taxable profit for the period, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.\nDeferred tax is provided on the balance sheet using the liability method with temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes recorded as a deferred tax asset of liability.\nThe amount of deferred tax provided is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these temporary differences can be realised.\n(9) Segmental reporting\nThe Board is responsible for allocating resources and assessing the performance of the business and is therefore identified as the chief operating decision maker.\nThe Group has determined that it has one reportable segment identified as Smiths News, a UK market-leading distributor of newspapers, magazines and ancillary products and services to retailers across the UK. The performance of Smiths News is reviewed, on a monthly basis, by the Board, making decisions based on the Group as whole.\nIncluded in revenues arising from Smiths News are revenues of £100.3m (2024: £100.5m) which arose from sales to the Group's largest customer. Three other customers contributed 13.1% (2024: 13.9%) of the Group's revenue in the period.\nNo segmental analysis is required on geographical lines as substantially all of the Group's activities are in the United Kingdom. As a result, no segmental disclosure is provided.\n(10) Dividends\nInterim and final dividends are recognised in the financial statements in the period in which they are declared.\n(11) Capitalisation of internally generated development costs\nExpenditure on developed software is capitalised when the Group is able to demonstrate all of the following:\n· the technical feasibility of the resulting asset;\n· the ability (and intention) to complete the development and use it;\n· how the asset will generate probable future economic benefits;\n· adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use the software are available; and\n· the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development.\nSoftware costs are also capitalised if they can be hosted on another server, are portable and the Group has sole rights to the software. Subsequent to initial recognition, internally generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately. Software costs provided on a licence agreement (software-as-a-service) are expensed as incurred.\n(12) Interests in joint ventures\nThe Group Financial Statements include the Group's share of the total recognised gains and losses in its joint ventures on an equity accounted basis.\nInvestments in equity accounted joint ventures are carried in the balance sheet at cost adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of the net assets of the joint ventures, less any impairment losses. The carrying values of investments in joint ventures include acquired goodwill. Losses in joint ventures that are in excess of the Group's interest are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.\n(13) Business combinations - goodwill and intangibles\nThe Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued, liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Any deferred or contingent purchase consideration is recognised at fair value over the period of entitlement.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured, initially, at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.\nGoodwill arising on all acquisitions is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost and accumulated impairment losses.\nThe carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets arising under a business combination (acquired intangibles) are capitalised at fair value as determined at the date of exchange and are stated at fair value less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation of acquired intangibles is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nCustomer relationships - 2.5 to 7.5 years\nTrade name - 5 to 10 years\nSoftware and development costs - 3 to 7 years\nComputer software and internally generated development costs which are not integral to the related hardware are capitalised separately as an intangible asset and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.\nAll intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may be higher than its recoverable value. The recoverable value used is the value in use. The value in use is determined by estimating the future cash inflows and outflows to be derived from continuous use of the asset and applying the appropriate discount rate to those future cash flows. Where the carrying value is higher than the calculated value in use, an impairment loss will be recognised.\n(14) Property, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. No depreciation has been charged on freehold land. Other assets are depreciated, to a residual value, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows:\nFreehold and long-term leasehold properties - over 20 years\nShort-term leasehold properties - shorter of the lease period and the estimated remaining economic life\nFixtures and fittings - 3 to 15 years\nEquipment and vehicles - 2 to 12 years\nAll property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n(15) Leasing\nLeases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n· fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable;\n· variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n· amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;\n· the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n· payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.\nLease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability.\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.\nTo determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:\n· where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted to reflect changes in financing conditions since third-party financing was received;\n· makes adjustments specific to the lease where applicable, for example with regards to the term and security.\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.\nLease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n· the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n· any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; and\n· any initial direct costs.\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee, to which depreciation is over the useful life of the underlying asset. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the underlying asset's useful life.\nPayments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.\nExtension and termination options\nExtension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group's operations. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.\nModifications\nWhen the Group revises its estimate of the term of any lease (because, for example, it re-assesses the probability of a lessee extension or termination option being exercised), it adjusts the carrying amount of the lease liability to reflect the payments to make over the revised term, which are discounted using a revised discount rate. The carrying value of lease liabilities is similarly revised when the variable element of future lease payments dependent on a rate or index is revised, except the discount rate remains unchanged. In both cases an equivalent adjustment is made to the carrying value of the right-of-use asset, with the revised carrying amount being amortised over the remaining (revised) lease term. If the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is adjusted to zero, any further reduction is recognised in profit or loss.\n(16) Inventories\nInventories comprise goods held for resale and are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Inventories are recorded at purchase cost.\n(17) Financial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group's balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group derecognises financial assets and liabilities only when the contractual rights and obligations are transferred, discharged or expire.\nFinancial assets comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Financial liabilities comprise trade payables, financing liabilities and bank borrowings.\n(18) Financial assets\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n· those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through profit or loss (FVTPL) or through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); and\n· those to be measured at amortised cost.\nThe classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\nTrade receivables\nTrade receivables are initially measured at fair value, which for trade receivables is equal to the consideration expected to be received from the satisfaction of performance obligations, plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition these assets are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment losses including expected credit losses. The Group applies the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics such as the ageing of the debt and the credit risk of the customers. An historical credit loss rate is then calculated for each group and then adjusted to reflect expectations about future credit losses. The Group does not have any contract assets.\nClassification as trade receivables\nTrade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. They are generally due for settlement within 30 days and are therefore all classified as current. The Group holds trade receivables with the objective of collecting the contractual cash flows, and so it measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Details about the Group's impairment policies and the calculation of the loss allowance are provided in Note 13.\nDue to the short-term nature of current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same as their fair value.\nOther receivables\nOther receivables are recognised on trade date, being the date on which the Group has the right to the asset. Other receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the other receivables have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures other receivables at their fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not held at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of FVTPL financial assets are expensed in profit or loss.\nSubsequent measurement of other receivables depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. The Group classifies its other receivables at amortised cost.\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised within other gains/(losses). Impairment losses are presented separately in Note 2.\nThe Group classifies its financial assets at amortised cost when it is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.\nThe Group applies the general approach to impairment under IFRS 9 based on significant increases in credit risk rather than the simplified approach for trade receivables using lifetime ECL.\n(19) Trade and other payables\nThese amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the period which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting period. They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n(20) Treasury\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet and cash flow statement comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits and funds with an original maturity of three months or less, held with the intention to meet short-term cash commitments, and it is subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. BACS and next-day payments are recognised at the settlement date, rather than when they are initiated, to reflect the nature of these transactions.\nCash and cash equivalents includes amounts held by the EBT for the purpose of purchasing own shares.\nFinancial liabilities and equity\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\nBank borrowings\nInterest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (being proceeds received, net of direct issue costs), and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemptions and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis and taken to the income statement using the straight-line method and are added to the carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.\nModification/derecognition of financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when there is extinguishment of the original financial liability and recognition of a new financial liability. Equally, significant modification of the terms of the existing financial liability is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and recognition of a new financial liability.\nForeign currencies\nFinancial statements of foreign operations\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition of a foreign entity, are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.\nForeign currency transactions\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.\n(21) Provisions\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the present value of the directors' best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date and if this amount is capable of being reliably estimated. If such an obligation is not capable of being reliably estimated, no provision is recognised and the item is disclosed as a contingent liability where material. Where the effect is material, the provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.\n(22) Retirement benefit costs\nDefined contribution schemes\nThe Group operates two defined contribution schemes for the benefit of its employees. Payments to the Group's schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.\n(23) Employee Benefit Trust\nThe Smiths News Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) purchases and holds shares in the Company from the market to satisfy the demand from the Group's share schemes. The EBT is a separately administered trust that is funded by contributions from Group companies. The assets of the trust comprise shares held in Smiths News plc and cash balances.\nThe Group consolidates the assets and liabilities of the EBT into the Group Financial Statements as a subsidiary on the basis of control. Where the EBT holds any shares in the Company, these are deducted from equity as 'own shares reserve' until those shares are either cancelled or transferred out of the EBT.\nThe shares held by the EBT are valued at the historical cost of the shares acquired. This value is deducted in arriving at shareholders' funds and presented as the own share reserve.\n(24) Share schemes\nShare-based payments\nThe Group operates several share-based payment schemes, being the Sharesave Scheme, the Executive Share Option Scheme, the LTIP and the Deferred Bonus Plan. Details of these are provided in the Directors' Remuneration report and in Note 24.\nEquity-settled share-based schemes are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed with a corresponding increase in equity on a straight-line basis over the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair values are calculated using an appropriate option pricing model and are adjusted where a scheme includes market-based performance criteria. The income statement charge is then adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting based on non-market performance-related criteria.\nAdministrative expenses and distribution and marketing expenses include the cost of the share-based payment schemes.\n(25) Changes in accounting policies\nDuring the period the Group has adopted the following accounting standards and interpretations:\n· Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases);\n· Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements);\n· Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements); and\n· Supplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures).\nThe standards and amendments adopted had no impact on the financial statements to prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods.\nNew standards and interpretations not yet applied\nThere are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB that are effective in future accounting periods that the Group has decided not to adopt early.\nIFRS 18 - Presentation and Disclosure of Financial Statements was issued in April 2024 and replaces IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements. The standard sets out new requirements for presentation in the income statement, including specified totals and subtotals, additional guidance on aggregation and disaggregation, and additional required disclosures in respect of management performance measures (which replace alternative performance measures).\nThe impact of this standard on the Group is currently being assessed. The standard is effective from 1 January 2027 with early adoption permitted.\nThe Group does not expect any other standards issued by the IASB, but not yet effective, to have a material impact on the Group.\n(26) Restatement of comparative information\nThe prior period balance sheet has been restated to reclassify £4.1m of returned newspapers from inventories to trade and other receivables to correctly reflect the nature of the balance. This has no impact on the net assets, cash flow statement, or income statement. The same reclassification of £4.1m was also required in the 2023 period end balance sheet.\n2. Operating profit\nRevenue and cost of sales are analysed as follows:\nOperating profit is stated after charging/(crediting):\nIncluded in administrative expenses are amounts payable by the Company and its subsidiary undertakings in respect of audit and non-audit services which are as follows:\nDetails of the Company's policy on the use of auditors for non-audit services and how the auditor's independence and objectivity were safeguarded are set out in the Audit Committee Report in the Annual Report 2025.\n3. Adjusting items\nThe Group recognised a net total adjusting items credit before tax of £2.1m (2024: £0.9m) and net credit of £1.3m (2024: £0.8m) after tax respectively.\nAdjusting items are defined in the accounting policies in Note 1 and in the Glossary. In the directors' opinion, removing these items from the adjusted profit provides a relevant analysis of the trading results of the Group because it is consistent with how the business performance is planned by, and reported to, the Board and Executive Team. However, these additional measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures. They comprise:\nAdministrative expenses: £1.6m costs (2024: net £nil)\n(a) Tuffnells costs: £0.8m (2024: £0.2m credit)\nAs part of the sale of Tuffnells Parcels Express Limited (Tuffnells) in May 2020, a contractual agreement was put in place in respect of the future treatment and responsibility of certain insurance claims brought or notified to insurers. This agreement extinguished the Group's exposure to new accident and insurance claims brought after the sale of Tuffnells but which related to the Group's period of ownership of Tuffnells up to May 2020.\nDuring the period, a review of provisions was held in respect of all remaining claims held following utilisations in the period and as a result, the provision was increased by £0.1m (2024: reduced by £0.2m), reflecting management's best estimate of remaining claims brought at the period end.\nIn the period professional fees of £0.7m were incurred in respect of the Group responding to information requests from the Pensions Regulator in respect of its investigation relating to the Tuffnells defined benefit pension scheme and the Company's former period of ownership of Tuffnells. Further details are included in Note 20.\nThese provisions have been reported as adjusting items on the basis that it relates to a former discontinued operation and is therefore outside the normal course of activity. The cash impact during the period was an outflow of £1.0m (2024: £0.1m) being £0.8m of professional fees and £0.2m (2024: £0.1m) of insurance settlements.\n(b) Technology transformation costs: £0.7m (2024: £0.1m)\nIn the prior period a transformation programme to enhance its technology infrastructure and enable alignment to the Group's updated vision and strategy commenced.\nImplementation costs of £0.7m (2024: £0.1m) have been recognised as adjusting items on the basis that the three-year programme is driving a significant change to the Company and largely comprise software-as-a-service arrangements. The cash impact was an outflow of £0.7m (2024: £0.1m).\n(c) Network and reorganisation costs: £0.1m (2024: £0.1m)\nDuring the period, an additional £0.1m (2024: £0.1m) of costs were provided for with regards to simplifying the DMD group structure. It is expected that this work will be concluded in the next 12 months.\nThe cash impact of network and reorganisation was a £0.1m outflow (2024: £0.2m outflow).\n(d) Impairment provision on trade receivables: £3.7m credit (2024: £0.6m)\nIn respect of the administration of McColl's Retail Group during FY2022, at FY2024 a provision of £3.8m was held, in respect of management's best estimate of recovery of 30% of the total claim filed representing a total of £1.7m, as per the issued notification from the administrators.\nDuring the period, £5.4m was recovered from the administrators in final settlement of the claim, which was £3.7m higher than expected, and therefore released and reported as an adjusting item on the same basis as previous impairment losses and reversals recognised during the prior periods. Further details are included in Note 13.\n(e) Impairment reversal of investment in joint ventures: £nil (2024: £0.3m reversal)\nDuring the prior period, the Company reviewed the business plan for the Rascal joint venture. As a result of this review, the remaining cumulative impairment of £0.3m was reversed, which has been presented within adjusting items to align to the previous impairment charge, which was significant in both quantum and nature to the results of the Group.\nTaxation on adjusting items increased by £0.7m to £0.8m (2024: £0.1m), driven by the release of McColls provision noted above.\n4. Staff costs and employees\nThe aggregate remuneration of employees (including Executive Directors) was:\nThe total average number of employees (including Executive Directors) was:\n*During the period, the average number of employees reported has been updated to better align to the requirements of the Companies Act. Comparatives have been restated as a result.\nDefined contribution pension schemes\nThe Group operates two defined contribution pension schemes. For the 52 weeks ended 30 August 2025, contributions from the respective employing company totalled £1.2m (2024: £1.1m) which is included in the income statement.\nA defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays contributions to an independently administered fund - such contributions are based on a fixed percentage of employees' pay. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions to the fund once the contributions have been paid. Members' benefits are determined by the amount of contributions paid by the Company and the member, together with investment returns earned on the contributions arising from the performance of each individual's chosen investments and the type of pension the member chooses to buy at retirement. As a result, actuarial risk (that benefits will be lower than expected) and investment risk (that assets invested in will not perform in line with expectations) fall on the employee.\n5. Finance costs and finance income\n*During the prior period £0.8m of unamortised arrangement fees were immediately recognised on derecognition of the previous loan facility.\nFinance income comprises interest received on bank deposits.\n6. Income tax expense\nThe effective adjusted income tax rate in the period was 24.6% (2024: 25.6%). After the impact of tax recognised on adjusting items of £0.8m (2024: £0.1m), the effective statutory income tax rate was 25.3% (2024: 25.2%).\nCorporation tax is calculated at the main rate of UK corporation tax of 25% (2024: 25%). The Group has assessed its deferred tax positions using a rate of 25%. Taxation for other jurisdictions was applied using prevailing rates.\nThe tax charge for the period can be reconciled to the profit in the income statement as follows:\nAmounts recognised directly in equity\nA current tax credit of £0.5m (2024: £0.1m) and deferred tax charge of £0.1m (2024: charge of £0.1m) was recognised directly in equity during the period.\nImpact of future tax changes\nThe UK Government enacted legislation on 11 July 2023 to implement the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Pillar Two model rules, including a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax. This legislation ensures that multinational enterprises (MNEs) pay a minimum tax rate of 15% on UK and overseas profits arising after 31 December 2023.\nThe period ended 30 August 2025 is the first to which these rules apply for the Group, which falls within scope of the legislation due to its UK and international presence and revenue exceeding €750 million. However, as the Group's business is substantially UK-based, and with its international revenues and profits at a de minimis level, there has been no impact on the Group's financial statements for the period.\n7. Dividends\nAmounts paid and proposed as distributions to equity shareholders in each period is set out below:\nAfter the balance sheet date, a final ordinary dividend of 3.80p per share is proposed for the 52 weeks ended 30 August 2025 (53 weeks ended 31 August 2024: 3.40p), alongside a special dividend of 3.00p per share (2024: 2.00p), each of which is expected to be paid on 5 February 2026 to all shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 9 January 2026. The ex-dividend date will be 8 January 2026.\n8. Earnings per share\nDilutive shares increase the basic number of shares at 30 August 2025 by 7.8m to 250.2m (31 August 2024: by 10.8m to 251.1m). The calculation of diluted EPS reflects the potential dilutive effect of employee incentive schemes.\n9. Intangible assets\n10. Property, plant and equipment\n11. Interests in equity accounted joint ventures\n*During the period working capital loans of £0.3m (2024: £0.3m) were made to joint ventures that were fully impaired and presented with losses from joint ventures.\nThe joint ventures listed below have share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares, which are held directly by the Group.\nNature of investments in joint ventures\nThe Group owns 50% of the ordinary shares of Rascal Solutions Limited, a company incorporated in England, which in turn owns 100% of the ordinary shares of Open-Projects Limited. The latest statutory accounts of Rascal Solutions Limited were drawn up to 31 August 2024. Rascal Solutions Limited provides retail support services and is a strategic partnership for the Group to provide additional services to its existing customers.\nBluebox Systems Group Limited is the holding company of Bluebox Aviation Systems Ltd, the principal activity of which is the sale of innovative in-flight entertainment systems. This business is a strategic partnership with DMD which also provides inflight media to the aviation industry.\nFresh On The Go Limited provides retail outlets with coffee vending and other related products. After the balance sheet date, the Group disposed of its holding in Fresh On The Go Limited for consideration of £25,000.\nDuring the period, the Group disposed of its holding in Lucid Digital Magazines Limited t/a LoveMedia for the nominal value of the shares, representing consideration of £100.\nThere are no other commitments relating to its joint ventures. All joint ventures are private companies and there is no quoted market price available for their shares.\nDividends of £0.2m (2024: £0.2m) were received in the period from joint ventures.\nRascal Solutions Limited investment\nDuring the period Rascal Solutions Limited (Rascal) recorded a profit of £0.3m (2024: £0.3m). The Group holds £4.6m (2024: £4.6m) on the balance sheet comprising a £2.2m (2024: £2.2m) share of net assets and £2.4m (2024: £2.4m) of goodwill. Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the share of the net assets acquired and the amount paid, and forms part of the investment in the joint venture.\nDuring the prior period, the Company reviewed the business plan for the Rascal Joint Venture, considering the cumulative previous impairment recognised of £0.3m, and as a result of this review, the remaining impairment was reversed. There have been no new indicators of impairment identified during the current period and therefore an impairment review has not been performed.\n12. Inventories\n*Comparatives have been restated as detailed in Note 1(26).\n13. Trade and other receivables\n*Comparatives have been restated as detailed in Note 1(26).\n(1) Net impairment loss on trade receivables - McColls Retail Group\nDuring the period ended 27 August 2022, the Company received notice that McColl's Retail Group had gone into administration. A statement of claim was filed with the administrators for an amount of £5.5m.\nAt the prior period end, a provision of £3.8m was held, in respect of management's best estimate of recovery of 30% of the total claim filed representing a total of £1.7m, as per the issued notification from the administrators. During the period, £5.4m was recovered from the administrators in final settlement of the claim, which was £3.7m higher than expected, and therefore released to the income statement. The remaining £0.1m was written off to the provision.\nIn the prior period the expected credit loss provision of £3.8m was allocated to 'over 90 days overdue' matching the ageing profile of the £5.5m total receivable due.\nTrade receivables\nThe average credit period taken on sale is 32 days (2024: 32 days). Trade receivables are generally non-interest bearing. The following table provides information about the Group's exposure to credit risk and expected credit losses held against customer balances:\nThe following table provides information about the Group's loss rates applied against customer balances:\nOf the trade receivables balance at the end of the period:\nThe movement in provision for expected credit losses for the period is detailed below:\nThe directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value which is considered to be a level 2 methodology of valuation. The inputs used to measure fair value are categorised into different levels of the fair value hierarchy (levels 1 to 3). The fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the level of the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.\nDefault occurs when the debt becomes overdue by 90 days.\nThe Group performed sensitivity analysis on the expected credit loss and should the default rate change from expected:\n· An increase in default rate by 2% would increase the expected credit loss by £1.4m.\n· A decrease in default rate by 2% would result in no credit losses.\n· An increase in default rate by 5% would increase the expected credit loss by £3.4m.\n· A decrease in default rate by 5% would result in no credit losses.\nOther debtors and prepayments\nThe largest items included within this balance are returns reserve asset of £17.0m (2024: £16.9m) (refer to Note 1, section 6) and £7.1m (2024: £8.0m) of publisher debtors.\n14. Trade and other payables\nIncluded within other creditors is a balance of £19.8m (2024: £19.8m) relating to the returns reserve accrual. (Refer to Note 1, section 6.)\nTrade and other payables principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 30 days (2024: 33 days). No interest is charged on trade payables. The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates to their fair value using a level 2 valuation.\n15. Cash and borrowings\nCash and borrowings by currency (sterling equivalent) were as follows:\nThe carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates to their fair value.\nThe Group has a financing facility in place comprising a £40.0m Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) with a £10.0m accordion option. The agreement is with HSBC and Santander. This initial arrangement had a final maturity date of 2 May 2027 with the option of two one-year extensions on the first and second anniversaries. During the period, the first one-year extension was exercised which extended the maturity date to 2 May 2028.\nAt 30 August 2025, £2.1m (2024: £18.0m) of the RCF was drawn. The total available amount is £40.0m for the life of the facility. As part of the terms of the financing, the Company and its principal trading subsidiaries provide security over their assets to the lenders. The current rate on the facility is 2.45% per annum over SONIA.\nAt 30 August 2025, the Company had £37.9m (2024: £22.0m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met. This is partially reduced by letters of credit of £1.5m (2024: £1.5m); further details are included in Note 20.\nDuring the period, the net decrease of £15.9m in total borrowings comprised £101.8m of cash inflows from drawing down the RCF and £117.7m of cash outflows from repayment of the RCF.\nReconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities\nThe table below details changes in the Group's liabilities arising from financing activities, including both cash and non-cash changes. Liabilities arising from financing activities are those for which cash flows were, or future cash flows will be, classified in the Group's consolidated statement of cash flows as cash flows from financing activities.\nOther changes include rent increases, interest accruals and the amortisation of loan fees.\nAnalysis of net debt\n*Included within cash and cash equivalents is £2.8m (2024: £nil) of cash held by the EBT for the purpose of purchasing own shares.\n16. Financial instruments\nTreasury policy\nThe Group operates a centralised treasury function to manage the Group's funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board-approved treasury policies and procedures and their delegated authorities. The role of Treasury is to ensure that cash financing is available for running the businesses of the Group on a day-to-day basis, whilst minimising net interest cost. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken. Dealings are restricted to those banks with suitable credit ratings and counterparty risk and credit exposure is monitored frequently.\nCapital risk management\nThe Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings, cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in Note 15 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group statement of changes in equity.\nThe only externally imposed capital requirements for the Group are Bank Net Debt to Bank EBITDA and interest cover under the terms of the banking facilities. The Group has fully complied during both the current and prior periods. To maintain or adjust its capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders and/or issue new shares. In the prior period there was a cap on dividends of £10.0m under the banking facility; subject to all the covenants. As part of the refinancing in May 2024, this restriction was removed.\nThe Board regularly reviews the capital structure. As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital, and the risks associated with each class of capital. We expect free cash from operations to be sufficient to manage net debt while also maintaining an attractive total shareholder return. The Group is targeting a Bank Net Debt: Bank EBITDA ratio below 1.0x, achieved through managing free cash from operations. The Group's facilities include a clause to account for lease charges under accounting standards applicable in 2019; Bank Net Debt: Bank EBITDA is stated on this basis.\nLiquidity risk\nThe Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. The facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk are described below.\nAs at 30 August 2025, the Group had £40.0m (2024: £40.0m) of committed bank facilities in place, comprising a £40.0m revolving credit facility (RCF), which expires on 2 May 2028.\nThe facility described above is subject to the following covenants:\nAt 30 August 2025, the Group had available £36.4m (2024: £20.5m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities comprising the £37.9m (2024: £22.0m) RCF above less letters of credit of £1.5m (2024: £1.5m). In addition, the facility includes a £10m accordion facility option. There were no breaches of loan agreements during either the current or prior periods.\nAs the Group is cash generative its liquidity risk is considered low. The Group's cash generation allows it to meet all loan commitments as they fall due as well as sustain a negative working capital position.\nThe Group invests significant resources in the forecasting and management of its cash flows. This is critical given a routine cash cycle at Smiths News that results in significant predictable swings within each month; the Group's average gross borrowing for the period was £6.6m (2024: £26.7m). The Group has available funding via the undrawn RCF and a £10m accordion facility option.\nThe following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under non-derivative financial liabilities. The undiscounted cash flows will differ from both the carrying value and fair value. Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing rate at the balance sheet date.\nCounterparty risk\nDealings are restricted to those banks with suitable credit ratings and counterparty risk and credit exposure is monitored.\nForeign currency risk\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group monitors its exposure to interest rate in light of the Group's debt exposure, consideration of the macroeconomic environment and sensitivity to potential interest rate rises. The Group avoids the use of derivatives or other financial instruments in circumstances when the outcome would effectively be largely dependent upon speculation on future rate movements. The Group does not consider interest rate risk to be sensitive.\nCredit risk\nThe Group considers its exposure to credit risk to be as follows:\n*Comparatives have been restated as detailed in Note 1(26).\nFurther detail on the Group's policy relating to trade receivables and other receivables can be found in Note 13.\n17. Leases\nThe balance sheet shows the following right-of-use assets in relation to leases:\nAmounts recognised in respect of leases\nMaturity analysis of lease liabilities\nAmounts recognised as lessor:\nAt the balance sheet date, the Group had contracted with tenants for the following future minimum lease payments:\n18. Deferred tax\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following:\nThe deferred tax assets have been deemed recoverable as the Group forecasts that it will continue to make profits against which the assets can be utilised for tax purposes.\nThe Group has capital losses carried forward of £20.2m (2024: £20.2m). Deferred tax assets of £5.1m (2024: £5.1m) have not been recognised in respect of the capital losses carried forward due to the uncertainty of their utilisation. These capital losses do not have an expiry period.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities at the period end have been calculated based on the rate of 25% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date on the basis that the temporary differences are expected to unwind when that rate applies.\n19. Provisions\nReorganisation provisions of £0.1m (2024: £0.2m) relate to the restructure of the DMD business, the Smiths News network and the Group's support functions.\nInsurance and legal provisions represent the expected future costs of employer's liability, public liability, motor accident claims and legal claims; included within the total balance is £0.4m (2024: £0.5m) relating to claims from the Tuffnells business prior to disposal.\nThe property provision represents the estimated future cost of dilapidation costs across the Group. These provisions have been discounted to present value and this discount will be unwound over the life of the leases. The provisions cover the period to 2035 with all of the liability falling within ten years and greater than one year.\nThe Group has performed sensitivity analysis on the property provision using the possible scenarios below:\nIf the discount rate changes by +/- 0.5%, the property provision would change by +/- £0.2m (2024: +/- £0.1m).\nIf the repair cost per square foot changes by +/-£1.00p, the property provision would change by +/- £0.5m (2024: +/- £0.3m).\n20. Contingent assets, liabilities and capital commitments\nBank and other guarantees\nAs at 30 August 2025, the Group had approved letters of credit of £1.5m (2024: £1.5m) to the insurers of the Group for the motor insurance and employer liability insurance policies. The letters of credit cover the employer deductible element of the insurance policy for insurance claims.\nAdministration of Tuffnells Parcels Express Limited (Tuffnells)\nAs reported in Note 3, during the year the Company incurred £0.7m of legal costs in considering and responding to two extensive enquiry requests (October 2024 and June 2025) from the Pensions Regulator (tPR) in relation to tPR's ongoing investigation into the Tuffnells defined benefit pension scheme and the Company's period of ownership of Tuffnells, which had concluded with its sale in May 2020.\nThe Company has continued to engage with tPR after period end and understands that the Company remains part of tPR's investigations as one of a number of potential targets relevant to its regulatory powers under the Pensions Act 2004.\ntPR are yet to issue a Warning Notice as at the date of these financial statements, and it is not known when, or if it will be issued (up to tPR's stated statutory deadline of 20 February 2026). The Board has nevertheless considered the nature and circumstances of tPR's investigation to date and concluded, at the date of authorisation of the financial statements, that no provision is required, particularly given that no Warning Notice has been issued, it remains uncertain at this time as to how tPR may proceed with the information before it or whether any future obligation (including the nature thereof) will arise at all, and the Company therefore does not currently have a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources. Accordingly, the Board has concluded that the matter represents a possible obligation only and has disclosed a contingent liability.\ntPR has communicated that the Tuffnells defined benefit scheme had an estimated s75 liability of £3.355m (however the final certified liability is yet to be confirmed) and that any Warning Notice, if issued, will be made under its wide-ranging Financial Support Direction powers available to it (which are based on a \"no-fault\" liability-regime).\nWith support of legal advice, the Board maintains the view that the Company has acted reasonably throughout its time as parent of Tuffnells and notes that it was an overall net contributor of funding to Tuffnells during its period of ownership. The Company continues to make itself available to provide further assistance to tPR as required.\nIndemnity coverage\nOn winding up of the News Section of the WH Smith Pension Trust defined benefit pension scheme in December 2021, the Company has agreed run-off indemnity coverage for any member claims that were uninsured liabilities capped at £6.5m over the following 60 years. The Group is not aware of any claims brought during either the current or prior reporting period.\nReversionary lease\nOther potential liabilities that could crystallise are in respect of the previous assignment of a lease where the liability could revert to the Group if the lessee defaulted. Pursuant to the terms of the Demerger Agreement from WH Smith PLC in 2006, any such contingent liability in respect of assignment prior to demerger, which becomes an actual liability, will be apportioned between Smiths News plc and WH Smith PLC in the ratio 35:65 (provided that the actual liability of Smiths News plc in any 12-month period does not exceed £5m). The Company's share of the rental commitment at 30 August 2025 was £0.9m (2024: £0.4m), which increased during the period following a review of market rent. This lease is expected to end in 2033.\nCapital commitments\nContracts placed for future capital expenditure approved by the Directors but not provided for amount to £0.1m (2024: £2.2m).\n21. Net cash inflow from operating activities\n*During the period, the Company received a £1.5m refund of an overpayment of tax made in respect of the wind up of the News Section of the WH Smith Pension Trust defined benefit pension scheme during FY2022. This amount has been presented in other comprehensive income consistent with the original £5.1m charge recognised during FY2022.\n22. Share capital\n(a) Share capital\n(b) Movement in share capital\nThe holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at the general meetings of the Company. The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed income.\nNo shares were issued during the current or prior periods.\n(c) Share premium\n23. Reserves\n(a) Demerger reserve\nThe demerger reserve was created on demerger of the Group from WH Smith PLC in 2006. The balance represented the difference between the share capital and reserves of the Group restated on a pro-forma basis as at 31 August 2004 and the previously reported share capital.\n(b) Own shares reserve\nThe reserve represents the cost of shares in Smiths News plc purchased in the market and held by the Smiths News Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) to satisfy awards and options granted under the Group's Executive Share Schemes (see Note 24). The number of ordinary shares held by the EBT as at 30 August 2025 was 5,665,315 (2024: 8,031,253). In accordance with IAS 32, these shares are deducted from shareholders' funds. Under the terms of the EBT, the Trustee has waived all dividends on the shares it holds.\n(c) Translation reserve\n24. Share-based payments\nThe Group recognised a total charge of £1.3m (2024: £0.9m) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the period. The average share price throughout the period was 58.2p (2024: 51.5p).\nThe Group operates the following share incentive schemes:\nDetails of the options/awards are as follows:\nThe weighted average remaining contractual life in years of options/awards is as follows:\nDetails of the options/awards granted or commencing during the period were as follows:\nThe options outstanding at 30 August 2025 had exercise prices ranging from nil to 49.3p (2024: nil to 48.9p). The weighted average share price on the date of exercise was 60.3p (2024: 45.4p).\nSharesave options granted during each period have been valued using the Black-Scholes model. LTIP performance measures include a 60% (2024: 60%) total shareholder return (TSR) metric which is valued by reference to the share price at date of grant less an adjustment for the TSR portion of the award. The DBP schemes are valued by reference to the share price at the date of grant.\nThe inputs to the Black-Scholes model are as follows:\n25.

Accounting policies\n(a) Accounting convention\nThe separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 (Financial Reporting Standard 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 (Financial Reporting Standard 101) 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.\nThe Company has taken advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present a profit and loss account and related notes.\nThe Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:\nIn addition, and in accordance with FRS 101, further disclosure exemptions have been applied because equivalent disclosures are included in the Group Financial Statements, including:\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in Note 1 to the Group Financial Statements except as noted below.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions to them are recognised in the period in which they are revised.\nEstimated impairment of investments\nInvestments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or where a previous impairment has been recognised. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount (determined as the higher of value in use or fair value less cost to sell) is determined using value in use calculations as the fair value is not readily determinable.\nThe value in use method requires the Company to determine appropriate assumptions in relation to the cash flow projections over the three-year plan period (which is a key source of estimation uncertainty), the growth rate to be applied beyond this three-year period and as part of the terminal value calculation the post-tax discount rate used to discount the assumed cash flows to present value. The assumption that cash flows continue into perpetuity is a source of significant estimation uncertainty.\n(b) Investments in subsidiary undertakings\nInvestments in subsidiary undertakings are held at historical cost less provision for impairment.\n(c) Financial instruments\nTrade payables are measured at amortised cost.\nEquity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company's balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n(d) Taxation\nCurrent tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n(e) Employee Benefit Trust\nThe Smiths News Employee Benefit Trust holds shares of the Company for the purpose of settling share-based payment plans for the Group's employees and is deemed a subsidiary of the Company on the basis of control. Smiths News Trading Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, provides funding to the trust for this purpose and the amounts are recognised as a capital contribution by the Company within investments. Any reduction from the purchase of shares is treated as a repayment of capital contribution.\n2. Result for the period\nThe Company has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The result for the period attributable to shareholders, which is stated on an historical cost basis, was a profit of £8.6m (2024: profit of £18.9m). There were no other recognised gains or losses. Dividends paid in the period totalled £17.4m (2024: £10.8m) (refer to Note 7 of the Group financial statements).\n3. Investments in subsidiary undertakings\nAt 30 August 2025, the carrying value of the Company's investment in subsidiary was £225.7m (2024: £402.5m) with a cumulative impairment provision of £460.2m (2024: £282.2m*).\n*Note: The comparative information for 2024 has been restated for to correct the cumulative impairment from £260.4m to £282.2m which was previously misstated in error. This disclosure error has no impact on net assets or profit for the prior period. Additions relate to £1.3m invested by way of capital contribution in respect of equity settled share-based payments relating to employees of its subsidiaries.\nDuring the period, a dividend of £186.7m was received from Smiths News Holdings Limited (the Company's immediate subsidiary) which had the impact of increasing retained earnings in the Company but lowering the net value in the subsidiary. This reduction in net value, alongside the net book value of investment versus the derived market capitalisation of the Group triggered an impairment review.\nThe impairment review was based on the Group's value in use adjusted for net debt and included a sensitivity analysis on the key inputs including the discount rate and on scenarios which might affect the Group's future cash flows.\nAs a result of the impairment review, the Directors concluded that it was appropriate to increase the previously recognised cumulative impairment of £282.2m by £178.1m representing the modelled estimate of the Group's value in use being lower than the carrying amount of the Company's investment in subsidiary largely driven by the £186.7m dividend which transferred value from the Company's subsidiary during the period.\nThe Company reviewed the component cash flows within the Group during the period in the light of management changes made, most notably the recruitment of a Managing Director of Recycle within the growth verticals. These components have therefore been updated to comprise Smiths News, Growth verticals (Growth), and its joint venture investment in Rascal Solutions Limited (Rascal). Dawson Media Direct group (DMD) was consolidated into Smiths News.\nThe Company prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent three-year plan budget. Cash flows beyond this three-year period are extrapolated using a terminal growth rate based on management's future expectations.\nThe key assumptions in the value in use calculations were as follows:\nThe post-tax discount rates are derived from a risk-adjusted weighted cost of capital using an average market participant capital structure, the inputs of which include a UK risk free rate, risk premium, small company risk premium and a risk adjustment (beta).\nThe market which Smiths News operates is in long-term structural decline and it is assumed that revenue is expected to fall each year over the longer term. This, in conjunction with updating the component cash flows, resulting in moving to a terminal value decline of 3% (2024: 0%).\nAs disclosed in the accounting policies (see Note 1), the cash flows used within the impairment model are based on assumptions which are sources of estimation uncertainty and small movements in these assumptions could lead to a change in the impairment loss. Management has performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions in the impairment model using reasonably possible changes in these key assumptions and in reference to the Company's principal risks.\nScenario 1 - Assumes gross profit from newspapers and magazines is reduced by 3%\nScenario 2 - Assumes profit from growth initiatives is reduced by 50%.\n4. Debtors\nAmounts owed by subsidiary undertakings are repayable on demand, unsecured, non-interest bearing and settled in cash.\n5. Net current liabilities\nAmounts owed to subsidiary undertakings are repayable on demand, unsecured, non-interest bearing and typically settled in cash. During the period a restructure of intercompany positions was performed. This included the receipt of an intercompany dividend of £186.7m from Smiths News Holdings Limited, a subsidiary of the Company.\n6. Share capital\n(a) Share capital\nThe holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at the meetings of the Company. The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed income.\n(b) Movement in share capital\n(c) Share premium\n7. Directors' emoluments and employees\nThe Company engaged five (2024: five) Non-Executive Directors. Smiths News Trading Limited, an indirect subsidiary, pays all remuneration without recharge for all Directors and the amounts are disclosed within the Directors' Remuneration Report.\nGlossary - Alternative performance measures\nIntroduction\nIn the reporting of financial information, the Directors have adopted various alternative performance measures (APMs).\nThese measures are not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies' APMs, including those in the Group's industry.\nAPMs should be considered in addition to, and are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements.\nPurpose\nThe Directors believe that these APMs assist in providing additional useful measures of the Group's performance. They provide readers with additional information on the performance of the business across periods which is consistent with how the business performance is planned by, and reported to, the Board and the Executive Leadership Team.\nConsequently, APMs are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive-setting purposes.\n*Operating profit is presented on the Group income statement. It is not defined per IFRS, however, is a generally accepted profit measure.\nReconciliation of free cash flow to net movement in cash and cash equivalents\nReconciliation of bank net cash/debt to reporting net debt\nReconciliation of adjusted operating profit to Bank EBITDA\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
