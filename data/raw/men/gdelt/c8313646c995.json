  "body_text": "Enzo Maresca claimed there is only one defensive midfielder ‘in the world’ who can be considered as good as Moises Caicedo after his latest display in a Chelsea shirt.\nJoao Pedro’s first-half goal was enough to separate the sides in north London as Chelsea moved back into the top four of the Premier League with their fifth-straight win over Tottenham.\nThe Blues produced a dominant display against their local rivals, and, in truth, should have run away with the game had it not been for a number of smart saves and squanderd chances.\nOnce again, though, it was the performance of Caicedo that typified a superb derby display from Maresca’s side, with the midfielder showing great tenacity to win the ball back twice before setting up Pedro for the game’s winning goal.\nAnd the Ecuadorian international continued in that vein throughout the game, delivering an all-action display with and without the ball to dirve his side on to a deserved victory.\nAfter a slow start to his life at Stamford Bridge, Caicedo is now more than justifying the £115million fee that Chelsea forked out to sign him from Brighton in August 2023.\nAnd speaking after his latest man-of-the-match display, Maresca belives that only Manchester City’s Rodri can hold a candle to Caicedo when it comes to his current levels of performance.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

In this moment, I think him with Rodri, they are the two best defensive midfielders probably in the world,’ Maresca told Sky Sports when asked about Caicedo at full-time.\nSpeaking in his post-match press conference later, the Chelsea boss added: ‘Moi is showing how good he is. He’s top.\n‘I said many times, the best thing for him, for sure we judge him on the pitch, but he’s so humble, such a good guy and is always there to help everyone.\n‘Him and Rodri, in this moment they are the best defensive midfielders in the world.’\nFormer Tottenham and Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp was equally effusive with his praise for the Chelsea star, telling Sky Sports: ‘I’d go as far to say that right now that he is the best of his type in world football.\n‘Just absolutely phenomenal the way that he covers ground, his desire, his quality on the ball, putting out fires for his team and chasing lost causes, strength on the ball, always making the right pass.\nMore Trending\n‘I just thought he was magnificent today and he’s a dream. When you are playing as a defender and you have someone like that just hoovering up in front of you and then having quality like that [in the final third], it’s just a dream.\n‘He took a little while to settle but now I’m thinking he’s one of the best. They’ve had Kante, Makelele, some of the best defensive midfielders at that club over the years.\n‘At 23, he’s absolutely magnificent and if you’re going to go anywhere, if you are going to win competitions, you need these types of players.’\nChelsea return to action in midweek as they travel to face Qarabag in the Champions League.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: ‘They look unbeatable’ – Paul Merson blown away by ‘phenomenal’ Arsenal star in Burnley win\nMORE: Man Utd fan ‘heartbroken’ as haircut hopes fade following Nottingham Forest draw\nMORE: Ruben Amorim demands ‘much more’ from Manchester United star after Nottingham Forest draw",
