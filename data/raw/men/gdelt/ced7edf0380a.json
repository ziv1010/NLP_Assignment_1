  "body_text": "Legia Warsaw: Everything Chelsea fans need to know ahead of Conference League quarter-final\n- Chelsea face Legia Warsaw in quarter-finals of Conference League\n- Blues are overwhelming favourites to win this year's trophy\n- Their Polish opponents are not enjoying the greatest season\nFor Chelsea, anything but the Conference League title will be considered an unequivocal failure.\nThe riches of the west London giants have swept aside all before them in this year's competition, seldom needing to step out of second gear to conquer significantly inferior opposition. The Conference League crown appears destined for Stamford Bridge.\nLegia Warsaw are Chelsea's unlucky adversaries in the quarter-finals, aiming to supply the mightiest of shocks. Should they upset the odds during the first leg on home soil, they can dare to dream upon their visit to the English capital.\nHere's the lowdown on Legia ahead of their duels with the Blues.\nWho are Legia Warsaw?\nLegia were formed during the First World War and have since gone on to become Poland's most successful club. Based in the capital, Warsaw, they have won 15 Ekstraklasa (Poland's top division) titles, one more than esteemed counterparts Gornik Zabrze and Wisla Krakow. They are also the only team in the country that has appeared in the top flight but not been relegated since World War II.\nTheir immense success is even more apparent in the Polish Cup, where they have triumphed on 20 occasions - 14 more than any other club. On the continent, they have previously reached the European Cup (now Champions League) semi-finals in 1969/70, as well as the last four of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1990/91.\nLegia have close ties with the Polish armed forces having been the main football club of the Polish Legions at its formation, even playing their home matches at the Polish Army Stadium.\nWho is Legia Warsaw's manager?\nLegia's manager, Goncalo Feio, is one of the modern game's young coaches. The 35-year-old Portuguese spent five years with the club's youth teams after moving to Poland initially through a student exchange between the universities of Lisbon and Warsaw.\nOther than a short spell in Greece, Feio has spent the entirety of his coaching career in Poland and was offered his first senior head coach role by Motor Lublin in 2022. He guided the club to promotion during his debut season at the helm and was crucial in them earning a second successive promotion the following campaign, although he departed before the conclusion of 2023/24.\nFeio joined Legia at the end of last season and has failed to entirely convince during his first full campaign. Having finished second and third during the last two seasons, Legia currently find themselves fifth in Ekstraklasa and look unlikely to trouble the European places this time.\nFeio has shown little commitment to one singular formation at Legia and has largely switched between 3-5-2, 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1. The latter is what has been employed most recently, but their form has been hugely inconsistent this term no matter the tactical setup.\nWho are Legia Warsaw's best players?\nFans with a very keen memory may recall Legia's midfield general Bartosz Kapustka, who turned out just three times for Leicester City in 2016/17. After unsuccessful loan spells in Germany and Belgium, he departed the East Midlands permanently and teamed up with Legia, where has since thrived.\nThis year has been particularly eye-catching for the 25-year-old, who is capable of playing in an array of roles within the engine room. He has managed 12 goals in all competitions and is donning the captain's armband effectively.\nRuben Vinagre is another Premier League alum, the left-back making 57 appearances for Wolverhampton Wanderers and six for Everton. The ex-Portugal youth international has impressed with his attack-minded approach in Poland, managing eight assists in all competitions this season.\nMidfielder-cum-defender Rafal Augustyniak has impressed in the heart of the backline this season and the 31-year-old also has an eye for goal with four to his name this season. Fellow centre-back Radovan Pankov has proven similarly difficult to bypass.\nSpaniard Marc Gual is the man Chelsea's defence need to watch out for, with 16 goals and four assists in all competitions this season. Seven of those efforts have come in the Conference League.\nHave Chelsea ever played Legia Warsaw before?\nThe Conference League quarter-final tie will be the first time Legia and Chelsea lock horns in a competitive fixture but the Polish giants have turned out against English opposition on eight occasions previously.\nThey most recently faced Aston Villa during the Conference League group stage last season, beating Unai Emery's side on home soil but losing in England. They achieved the same during their Europa League battles with Leicester in 2021/22.\nLegia were unbeaten across two matches with Blackburn Rovers in the 1995/96 Champions League group stage, but they were unable to conquer Manchester United in a Cup Winners' Cup semi-final in 1990/91 - losing at home and drawing at Old Trafford.",
