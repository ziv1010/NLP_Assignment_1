  "body_text": "Kevin Thelwell could be reunited with Conor Coady at Rangers after turning down the chance to sign him permanently at Everton.\nCoady still has a year left on his Leicester City contract but faces an uncertain future with the Foxes following their relegation from the Premier League and no concrete decision yet made on whether Ruud van Nistelrooy will still be in charge for their return to the Championship.\nThelwell, who will be heavily involved in any deal to bring Coady to Ibrox, knows the player well after he spent a year on loan at Everton from Wolves, playing the 2022-23 season at Goodison.\nThe defender was a popular figure on his native Merseyside and fans were keen to see the option to make the deal permanent taken up by the Toffees.\nHowever, they opted against doing a deal and Coady returned to Wolves, who sold him to Leicester that summer for a fee of £7.5M.\nAnd Thelwell, now sporting director at Ibrox after joining from Everton last week, told the Training Ground Guru podcast why he made the call not to sign Coady 2 years ago.\n“If we go back in time, Yerry Mina hadn’t played a lot, but he finished the season strongly and played a big part in helping us stay up. We could have easily added another year on his contract,” Thelwell said.\n“Coady came in the building and was a fantastic professional. It would have been very easy for us to sign Conor permanently for a low price, but we decided against that on the back of holding the door open for Jarrad [Branthwaite].”\nFrom an original report at the Daily Record\nReader Comments (41)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Of course you knew that already, no doubt. But others, perhaps less so.\nWell, I thought it was interesting... I thought it might make a brief change from the clickbait crap about who we are not signing.\nBut, if you say so… they're dead to me.\n4 Posted 07/06/2025 at 14:12:13\nGo on, have a go, it's dead easy.\n5 Posted 07/06/2025 at 14:17:15\nA good player to have in and around the squad.\n6 Posted 07/06/2025 at 14:21:55\n7 Posted 07/06/2025 at 14:24:52\nWe'd have to stop talking about all former players and managers on that principle, Peter.\nI think this is a good move for Coady at his stage of his career. I wonder if Thelwell will look to try and bring in one or two of our U21s on loan?\nHe didn't do too bad by us taking Branthwaite to PSV.\n8 Posted 07/06/2025 at 14:26:18\nImprove it, Peter, submit an article mate.\n9 Posted 07/06/2025 at 14:34:05\n11 Posted 07/06/2025 at 14:42:10\nYes it is. There was an article in the Chronical yesterday saying that due to PSR rules we can only afford a loss of £39M for the 2024-25 season which ends on 30 June. So until that date is reached, we won't be signing anyone unless it's for a small fee. It's more likely we'll be selling this June rather than buying.\nPersonally it doesn't bother me. The season has been over less than a month and already the \"assumed\" FSG money is burning a hole in the fans' pockets. Our chances of beating the likes of Liverpool, Man City, Arsenal etc to some young Champions League prospect are minimal to non-existent.\nBest just leave it to Moyes and the DoF. He knows talent when he sees it and hopefully he can get some of it in without breaking the bank.\n12 Posted 07/06/2025 at 14:48:24\n13 Posted 07/06/2025 at 15:13:54\nWe would not take an entire year of amortisation of the transfer fee for 3 weeks of June.\nThat said, the psr legal case did highlight a £65m odd loss in our third year. Here's hoping that year 2 and last season keeps us the right side of the £105m. That 3rd year is a fair loss if I remember it right.\n14 Posted 07/06/2025 at 15:21:10\nI've said some critical stuff about the site recently, a lot of it unjustified. However, there's lots of decent information, good articles and debate. For a twenty four hour vibrant site it is the best and still a credit ti those who do it.\nImagine being without it, it would isolate Evertonians, myself included, across the world. For ToffeeWeb patrons it costs a pittance, for everyone else it is free. It is where I go for the truth about Everton.\n15 Posted 07/06/2025 at 15:45:58\n16 Posted 07/06/2025 at 15:52:05\nSo can we now say that on TW, anything is up for articles,\nincluding AI and articles not even written by TW posters or moderators. Can we or should we ask for this to be stopped?\n17 Posted 07/06/2025 at 15:55:02\nI just thought we should have kept him at the time.\n18 Posted 07/06/2025 at 15:57:49\n\"Rob, you can always submit a thread about anything to do with Everton, and then we can all comment on it.\nGo on, have a go, it's dead easy.\" 😀\n19 Posted 07/06/2025 at 16:02:13\n20 Posted 07/06/2025 at 16:06:10\nJust scroll and click on something else.\n21 Posted 07/06/2025 at 16:15:16\nAs Mike said, if you don't like the article move on.\n22 Posted 07/06/2025 at 16:27:04\nThere there.\n23 Posted 07/06/2025 at 16:27:57\n24 Posted 07/06/2025 at 16:34:48\nNice bit of sarcasm, MK – naughty!\n25 Posted 07/06/2025 at 16:44:07\nBut... we shouldn't plunge to the depths of AI-generated articles on anything that is barely relevant to Everton, especially articles taken directly off newspapers.\nMichael could probably fill this site with his knowledge of our club without breaking into a sweat, and all would be relevant. Just saying.\n26 Posted 07/06/2025 at 16:44:37\nRangers usually irrelevant, always racist. Dislike them more than Liverpool.\n27 Posted 07/06/2025 at 18:02:58\nI always try to respect those who do, as it takes time and thought. You are rightfully a tough audience, with a lot of different opinions about the one thing we mutually love.\nI'm not quite in Michael's territory of writing as it happens, which I have respect for. I normally give myself a day to reflect, sometimes making notes on the train home after the match. As Rob said, it's not difficult to do on a variety of topics. That's what makes this site what it is.\nMike G says it, if you don't like it, don't read it.\nWe all talk about former players and staff. It is relevant to Everton.\nShould Rob Sawyer's and Becky Tallentire's pieces on historical Everton figures of the past, who no longer have connections be deemed not relevant? Okay, these two are not in the company of some of the past greats, but they will always have an association with Everton. A lot of Becky's have been fascinating insights into former wives and one of my favourites of her writings, an interview with Everton's first Ball Boy, John Murray.\nBrian @28, where does the racist slur come from? Thelwell was born and grew up in Wolverhampton, a very multi-cultural environment. He coached at grass roots level in the area and has arranged the signings of players from all around Europe and the world.\nCoady was an ambassador for ab avoiding racism through education initiative when at Wolves, often briefing at schools and local football clubs.\nDwight McNeil (of Jamaican descent). Bringing back Gana and arranging the signing of fans favourite Ndiaye. Onana (not everyone's favourite, but we sold him on for profit). Beto.\nI'm not sure how that makes him racist unless you have a different perspective.\nYou'd have to explain to me.\n28 Posted 07/06/2025 at 20:29:44\nHistorically, Rangers was closely associated with Protestantism and Unionism, and there was an unwritten rule against signing Catholic players. This policy was not officially acknowledged until the 1960s, but it was in place from around the 1920s. However, this has changed, and there are now a number of Catholic players and staff members at the club.\nIn 1989, Graeme Souness, the manager at the time, famously signed Mo Johnston, a Catholic player, to try and break down the \"hoodoo\". Despite this and other changes, the club's reputation for being anti-Catholic lingered for some time. However, today Rangers actively promotes diversity and inclusion, and it is no longer a club with a Protestant-only policy.\nDanny the last 12 words is a self indictment of what was. Don't like the union flag waving Scottish entity, don't get it.\nLove your stories, appreciate your mileage. 👍\n29 Posted 07/06/2025 at 20:30:59\nOverall I think the majority of our permanent signings have worked out very well under Thelwell. Making full use of the loan system (I hope we continue to do so) helped us avoid some very average players on long term contracts and further points deductions (I hope but time will tell).\nMany on this site talked up Lindstrom as if he was an incredibly skillful and speedy talented forward. I was never convinced and he proved to be another limited and over hyped player.\nHe was worth a loan punt, in effect a seasons trial, but he's just not proved good enough for anything more. Not helped by having Dyche for manager but he played a part in challenging Harrison who appeared to get worse the longer he was with us.\nAll ex-Evertonians deserve and have my respect, although some are less fondly remembered!\n30 Posted 07/06/2025 at 20:37:53\nHowever, quite what this story is doing on TW is beyond me? Who cares what he's doing now? Are we going to have an article about how Jack Harrison is re-settling at Leeds?\n31 Posted 08/06/2025 at 00:30:26\nThat's the sort of article we should also have on ToffeeWeb. I always thought it was Michael who scoured the internet and put up such relevent articles but maybe it was Lyndon after all?\nIf ex-players are no longer relevant why were there so many of them at the Farewell to Goodison?\n32 Posted 08/06/2025 at 05:30:15\nYes, there is a very close line between racism and religious bigotry. It's all discrimination.\nI don't so much mind the Union Flag or Irish Tricolour waving. It got a bit odd, in my head, when the Protestant areas start putting Israel flags on the lampposts alongside the Union Flag, and the Catholic areas Palestinian ones alongside the Tricolour. I didn't see the relevance.\nThere were plenty of Irish flags draped around Goodison at the last match, as there always are and are sold on the stalls. There was also a Union Flag in the Gwladys Street. I don't think the owner hardly stopped waving it.\nYes Eric, including the current squad, there were about 100 Everton players on the pitch, over 70 of them former ones.\nThere is nothing wrong with reporting on former players in my opinion.\nHealth warning, I've started drafting one about the 84-85 team in recognition of it being 40 years since we won our 8th League Title and European Cup Winners Cup, for consideration.\nI don't think any of them have official connections at the club. Peter Reid is often seen in the Director's Box looking like Al Capone, but I'm not sure if he has an official role. Pat Van den Hauwe was involved with EitC, but I'm unsure if that is still the case.\n34 Posted 08/06/2025 at 09:18:07\nOn the main thread, I also thought originally that it wasn't a relevant thread for TW but I'm glad I read it now. I was a fan of Conor Coady and thought he had a good bond in partnership with Tarkowski and was disappointed when he left.\nRemember Southampton away when they were battering us in search of an equaliser and him and Tarkowski just threw themselves in the way of everything? We celebrated every block like a goal and they were well on the way to becoming cult figures.\nGood luck to the yicker – wish I could affect a scouse accent as well as he does, by eck!\n35 Posted 08/06/2025 at 11:48:34\nI think we're on the same page about all this stuff. Happy with that.\nPeter Reid = Norman Wisdom 🤣🤣\n36 Posted 08/06/2025 at 12:02:35\nObviously, no Coady, but that second-half backs-to-the-wall performance at Brighton away was the same.\nI always like centre-back captains. They can see the whole game in front of them. I'm not a huge fan of centre-forwards being captains.\nYicker. Is that complimentary?\n37 Posted 08/06/2025 at 12:13:36\nI've never heard a yicker complain about it but it's not meant as derisory. It's not like “wool”.\n38 Posted 08/06/2025 at 13:27:56\nIt's true that Rangers never signed Protestants before Souness joined them; however, they did unwittingly sign a Catholic from South Africa in the mid-1950s — Don Kitchenbrand, a striker who later played at Goodison Park for Sunderland.\nHe said after leaving Rangers that nobody at Rangers asked him about his religion when he signed so he just kept his mouth shut and signed for them!\n39 Posted 08/06/2025 at 13:51:05\nOld mate… \"It's true that Rangers never signed Protestants before Souness joined them\" — are quite sure that is really what you wanted to say?\n40 Posted 08/06/2025 at 13:54:11\n41 Posted 08/06/2025 at 16:18:52\nGood luck to him and Rangers\n42 Posted 09/06/2025 at 05:34:43\nI liked Coady but there's no denying we probably had the last of his best seasons at the age of 30. He's an old school defender which basically means he was built to just defend, a lesser version of Tarkowski. The only surprise was he was a Dyche man.\nI'd like it even better though when I see us making our first signing this summer, lol.\n43 Posted 09/06/2025 at 14:21:35\nYes I apologise to all the Protestants that Rangers signed before Souness joined them and to all the Catholics who wanted to sign for them but got KB'd because they were not Protestants.\nIf the way Rangers ran their club today the same way as before the 1960s, I think quite a few players would change their faith because of the money paid these days!\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
