I’m very happy with all my players, Kylian included, he’s always behaved admirably,” said Luis Enrique at Tuesday’s press conference.\nAhead of PSG’s fixture with arch-rivals Marseille, the Spaniard said Saturday in an interview with Prime Video that Mbappe “can still change his mind” about leaving.\nAlthough heavily linked to Spanish giants Real Madrid, Mbappe has still not announced where he will play football next season after his current contract expires with PSG.\nStill in contention for three titles – the French league, French cup and Champions League – PSG now enter a crucial phase of their season.\nOn Wednesday, they will welcome Rennes to the Parc des Princes where they are favourites to book a place in the French Cup final on May 25 in Lille.\nThe following Wednesday, Luis Enrique’s former side Barcelona visit PSG for the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal tie.\n“We’re all in the same boat, sailing and seeking success,” said Luis Enrique of his side’s treble quest.\n“I’d love this to end well for PSG, for Kylian, for everyone.”\nOn Tuesday, Lyon host second-division Valenciennes in the first semifinal tie of the French Cup with the winners facing either PSG or Rennes in May’s showpiece final.",
