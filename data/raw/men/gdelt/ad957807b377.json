How could the answer not be yes.”\nDecember 2018: Ringing in the New Year at Burj Al Arab\nJust one month after the proposal, the couple returned to celebrate New Year's Eve at Burj Al Arab,sharing photos celebrating with friends at the famous Jumeirah hotel.\nAugust 2025: ‘Fresh start’ in Dubai\nKate revealed that the family have made the move to Dubai, sharing glimpses of their new life with photos in front of Burj Al Arab and inside their lavish villa, which comes with a lush backyard and private pool.\n“A new chapter, a fresh start – because if we don’t try, we’ll never know,” Kate captioned the post. “Ahhh! We’ve talked about this for so long, and now it’s finally real… we’re here, we are making a new home in the place we met!\n“Missing some of our specials already & a bit scared, excited & nervous – but more than anything, ready for fresh starts and new beginnings.”",
