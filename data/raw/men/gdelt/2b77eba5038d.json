  "body_text": "Real Madrid left-back Alvaro Carreras spoke to the media ahead of the club’s match against his former team, Benfica, on Wednesday. He was asked about high pressure and criticism, to which he said: “I’ve played for the best club in Portugal, and now for the best club in the world. And I understand that’s how things are. I... I like pressure, I’m comfortable with it. I don’t know if it’s too much... but you have to have pressure, because otherwise, this wouldn’t be the club it is.”\nAlvaro Carreras: “I like pressure, I’m comfortable with it”\nHe spoke before Benfica.\nCarreras on the game against Benfica\n“We know it will be very important for both of us, because we both need the win. The atmosphere will be incredible. But we need to play our own game, like we have in recent matches. And we’ll definitely get the three points.\n“I’ve experienced some wonderful Champions League nights at Da Luz. And I know they’ll come out all guns blazing, going for broke; because they need the win. I hope it’s a fantastic night, but I hope we come away with the victory.”\nCarreras on Alvaro Arbeloa\n“He comes with a clear idea: to be ourselves. To enjoy the ball, to stick together in tough times, and to run together. And then, the spaces and depth will appear.”\nCarreras on players’ attitude\n“Well... we knew it would be tough against Villarreal and we had to push hard from the start. After halftime, we came out focused and determined, and the goal came. We’re all in, we want the best for the club, and we’re going for all the remaining titles.”\nCarreras on Benfica\n“I wish them all the best. I haven’t been gone for long, but I still have a very close relationship with the players and management. Keep fighting. It’s a very demanding club, the best in Portugal. And I’m sure they’ll do well.”\nCarreras on his Benfica teammates\n“Quite a few. I have a very good relationship with many of them, I could even say friends, at Benfica. Like Manu... Prestianni... but we’ll talk more after the match, rather than on the pitch.”\nCarreras on whether he imagined having such a big role at Real Madrid\n“In the end, you arrive at a new place with the happiness and excitement of a young man fulfilling his dream of playing for the best club in the world. What I can say is that with confidence and these players by my side, it’s very easy to play. And living with them is a dream. You learn, they teach you so much. But yes, I was confident that everything would go well and that I had the level to play for Real Madrid. Yes, I was confident.”\nCarreras on Real Madrid’s form\n“Football is one game at a time. We might be in great form, but if something bad happens tomorrow, it would be Real Madrid’s worst period again. We have to go out there, win, and focus on La Liga, because we have a very tough match this weekend.”\nCarreras on whether he would’ve liked to be coached by Jose Mourinho\n“These are situations... ( Silence ) I’d like to, because he’s a legendary coach and knows a lot about football. But right now I’m very happy with Arbeloa, just like I was with the two coaches I had at Da Luz. I’m extremely happy. And to Mourinho... I wish him all the best.“",
