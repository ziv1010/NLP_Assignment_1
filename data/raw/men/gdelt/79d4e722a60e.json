Every season, our chances of ending our trophy drought, or just of competing, become slimmer. While much of that is down to mismanagement at our club, the hopelessness of ever being successful could apply to more than half of the Premier League.\nAnd yet they still play to near full houses every week. So why do we do it?\nThe American Model\nAmerican contributors have pointed out on this site in the past that the way the Premier League is now simply wouldn’t fly there, that the majority of the paying public wouldn’t waste their time and money watching their team in a competition that they know they don’t have a cat in hell’s chance of winning.\nOf the major sports over there, I can only speak for the NFL, and the set-up is so different. That the worst performing teams will have first picks in the next draft is well known. Not as well known is that they have a much truer “Swiss system” of fixtures than the Champions League claims to have – my understanding, and American readers can feel free to correct me, is that outside of the six divisional games, you’ll generally play teams with a similar record to yourselves the previous season. You can be cynical and view such a system as rewarding failure – in reality, it keeps things more competitive.\nAlso, 14 teams out of 32 qualify for the playoffs (to decide the Champions in the Superbowl), and even then, you don’t need to have one of the 14 best records to qualify. The way it works, it’s possible to lose more matches than you win and still qualify if the other three teams in your division have a worse record. And then it’s the lottery of knockout playoffs, so everyone has a chance.\nSo, even if your team did terribly the season before, you know that you’ll be able to improve the squad with higher draft picks, have a potentially easier fixture list than most, especially if your recruitment is more astute than your fellow strugglers, and if you get lucky and the other teams in your division have a poor season, you can at least make the post-season and go from there.\nAnd even if you feel that your team is beyond that, and that it will take more than one recruitment window to fix them, and you’re in a division with one of the best teams in the NFL, and so are unlikely to finish top or make a wildcard spot, and therefore you’re not hopeful for the next season, there’s always the hope that, say, 5 years down the line, with good recruitment and coaching, your team will be ready to challenge. Like football used to be here. And if and when that happens, knowing that you were in on the ground floor and supporting them when they were the worst team in the league only makes it all the more satisfying. Again, like it used to be here.\nHere now\nContrast that with the current state of the Premier League. Going into this season, everyone except Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City and maybe Chelsea commenced their Premier League campaign knowing that they couldn’t possibly win it. And in most cases, you can also forget about any 5-year plan that used to be the staple of new managers at struggling teams – nowadays, everyone outside of the old Sky 4 and Manchester City knows that they’ll never win the Premier League again, barring another 5,000-to-1 miracle like Leicester City.\nIn saying that, Leicester’s title happened almost a decade ago, and the landscape has since changed – FFP has shown its teeth, and the top clubs (except Manchester United!) have gotten a lot more savvy with their scouting and recruitment and retention of talented youngsters – the chances of just one of another Mahrez or Kante playing at their peak for an unfancied or newly promoted side again are practically non-existent, never mind both of them.\nEven if the league had been like this in the past, there was always the cup. 40 years ago, the FA Cup had all the glamour and prestige that the Champions League has now, and realistically, anyone in the top tier could win it and anyone in the top two tiers could reach the final.\nNow, the gulf between the top few clubs and the rest has become such that the FA Cup (and the League Cup too) is won by one of the old Sky Four or Manchester City every season. The best anyone else can hope for is to reach the final, or maybe just reach the semi-final and enjoy a day out at Wembley.\nCombined with the fact that the FA Cup has lost so much of its lustre and status that it barely registers if you do. It’s gone the way of the League Cup. It’s distinctly third-rate. Even if you were to defy the odds and win it, it wouldn’t mean the same as winning it 40 years ago.\nIt's the nonsensical combination of being harder to win and somehow less prestigious if you win it. It’s the worst of both worlds.\nTo come back to the phenomenal popularity of the Premier League, let’s say Wolves were playing Crystal Palace in the 5th Round or even the 6th Round of the FA Cup – what do you think the attendance would be?\nAround 70% of capacity would be my guess, and that’s possibly a kind one. Yet, if the same two teams were playing each other in the Premier League, in any circumstances – a mid-table nothing game, taking place mid-week in January – the attendance would be close to the 100% mark.\nIt makes no sense.\nNothing New\nSadly, what I’m writing is nothing new or original. Much of the above could easily have been written about 18 years ago. The poor turnout and lack of interest or excitement in the 3rd Round of the FA Cup raised eyebrows in 2007, while the old Sky 4 had already started to hold a monopoly – the identity of the four Champions League qualifiers from the Premier League had become depressingly predictable.\nTony Mowbray, who was at the time trying to get West Bromich Albion back into the Premier League, expressed dismay that the best his side could ever hope for now would be to reach the (very much diminished) UEFA Cup (as it was still known), and that such limitations on achievement outside of the Sky 4 could be causing supporters to become disillusioned.\nI was going to say nothing has changed, but it’s actually become even worse since then. As I discussed at length recently (and boy, was it at length), so-called Financial Fair Play has only strengthened the system for the rich to get richer and increase the gulf between the elite few and the rest.\nWhile the media had always shown bias towards the Red Cartel, back in 2007 we at least had the relatively neutral Andy Gray, Trevor Francis et al providing their take on the big games. The last dozen or so years, they’ve been replaced by a new generation of ex-Liverpool and Manchester United personnel who don’t even try to hide their allegiance. Their matches have basically become Fanzone with ex-players.\nAs the worldwide reach of the Premier League has increased and the game becomes ever more commercial, match-going fans had already gone from being “supporters” to “customers” in 2007. I’d say they’re now “extras”, there to provide atmosphere for the global TV audience, but at least extras get paid. It's more like they've become part of the live studio audience.\nIn the first couple of years of the Premier League, attendances at most grounds were way below capacity – Goodison itself would often see gates of less than 20,000. Yet back then, in addition to more reasonable ticket prices and more convenient kick-off times, the glass ceiling hadn’t materialized yet, and a couple of years of good coaching and shrewd transfer dealings could see you challenging for honours again.\nNow, any hope of that has gone… and yet attendances – not just at Goodison but everywhere – are at close to capacity.\nSo to go back to my original question:\nWhy?\nWell, one thing American sports don’t have is a league pyramid like we do. If we don’t like our lot, there are 72 other teams in the Football League who would happily swap places with us. Take into account the number of non-league clubs who feel they realistically have the infrastructure to make the Premier League, and there’s probably 100 clubs who would gleefully take being in the top League even with no chance of doing anything beyond surviving every season.\nThe marketing and hype around the Premier League (how often is it given the very subjective and dubious moniker of “the best league in the world”?!) has been such that it’s considered the only place to be. Just being part of the show – and it has become a TV show – is all that matters for many.\nThere’s millions of fans who support clubs outside the top flight who would jump at the chance to see their team as part of Sky’s flagship coverage, even if they’re just fodder for the Red Cartel and have to listen to Neville, Carragher and Keane cheer and celebrate and gloat when the inevitable thrashing happens. Or better still, be part of that live studio audience.\nScores of clubs outside the top flight would be happy to be making up the numbers in the Premier League, and who cares if the best you can hope for is to emulate what Brighton are doing at the moment?\nBrighton themselves spent a few seasons barely staying in the Football League at the turn of the millennium, having to ground share with Gillingham before playing at an athletics track. Now, being in their fancy new AmEx Stadium, competing well with the big boys and challenging for a place in Europe every season, they must be rubbing their eyes – and they won't care a jot that this will be as good as it will ever get.\nBournemouth came close to going the way of Bury, and spent many years outside the top two tiers, never mind the top one. To be mid-table and holding their own in the Premier League would have been beyond their wildest dreams back when they nearly went out of existence. A season outside of the top flight has probably only served to make them more grateful and, even if they end up becoming a yo-yo club, after what they’ve been through in recent decades, they’ll be delighted if it stays that way.\nSo many other clubs can only hope for such a change in fortunes. And we’re not just talking about all the small clubs here – there are some historically big clubs on the outside looking in enviously.\nPreston North End – the original invincibles but out of the top flight for so long now that they’d love to just get back there.\nBlackburn Rovers – they’ve actually won the Premier League and yet now they would quite gladly, I’d imagine, take finishing 17th in the Premier League for 10 straight seasons if it means they get to be there again.\nSheffield Wednesday have been out of the top flight for well over two decades. So many other clubs who’ve won the League more than once – Bolton Wanderers, Derby County, Huddersfield Town, Portsmouth, Sunderland – the list goes on of big clubs with previous high expectations who know they can never get back to what they once were.\nEven two-time European Cup Winners Nottingham Forest have only recently returned to the top flight after an absence of over 20 years. To their credit, they’re doing really well in the Premier League at the moment, but I’m sure that, however well or badly their team fare, they’re happy just to be back.\nIn a way, that’s where we’ve been spoiled, if that’s the right word. There have only been six ever-presents in the Premier League since the breakaway in 1992. The old Sky 4, Tottenham Hotspur and ourselves. The latter two being the only ones who haven’t won it.\nSpurred On\nThat puts Tottenham in a similar predicament to ourselves. And indeed we did seem to run parallel with Tottenham for a while – often in the bottom half in the first decade of the Premier League, improved in the second decade and often competing with each other to be the “best of the rest”, while trophies tended to prove elusive.\nTottenham have just two League Cups in their trophy cabinet for the entire Premier League era, the last of which came in 2008. Even so, despite us almost being on a par with Tottenham for some time, and even finishing above them just 10 years ago, they’ve now raced light-years ahead of us.\nDespite the ongoing lack of trophies, Tottenham have at least enjoyed a few adventures in the Champions League, even reaching the Final in 2019. They boast a squad of exciting talent and can match anyone with their fast counter-attacking style, which is exciting to watch for neutrals, never mind their own supporters.\nThey’ve even been on the fringes of the title race a couple of times, and, unlike everyone else outside the old Sky 4 and Manchester City, Tottenham supporters can begin each season knowing that, while the title itself is a long shot, Champions League qualification remains a realistic possibility – although they don’t reach this promised land every season, they know that, if one of the usual teams up there has a lacklustre season, Tottenham will usually be there to capitalise.\nTheir match-going supporters also get to enjoy a superb new stadium that’s the envy of some of their more successful rivals.\nIn Closing\nThat just leaves Everton.\nAfter only spending just 4 of 137 years outside the top fligh, it’s hard to say we should be grateful for the fact that we’ve been ever presents in the Premier League. All it’s done is made us want more. Made us question what seems to be the new order of things.\nOur recent struggles have certainly made for more excitement, and the focus on avoiding disaster has taken our minds off our lack of success.\nAnd there is still hope. Aston Villa have shown that. It will need the team to either still be in the top flight or quickly return there when this new stadium is finished. It will mean this takeover going smoothly and the new owners having more business and football acumen than their predecessors. It will take a complete overhaul of the current squad and years of rebuilding financially to fall in line with PSR without having to sell players. It’s going to take a long time.\nBut hey, if we don’t like it while we wait, there are scores of clubs outside the top flight ready to take our place.\nReader Comments (22)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Lower league fans dream of being in the Premier League, even for just 1 season. Teams like Villa and Leicester offer me hope that one day things will turn around and our day will come.\nAnd it will, we just have to persevere.\n2 Posted 27/11/2024 at 10:15:52\nOur US friends would have to comment more knowledgeably.\nOut of interest, does the MLS operate in a similar way with a draft system?\n3 Posted 27/11/2024 at 10:41:37\nLet's hope The Friedkin Group examine how The Lions have gone from perennial underachievers to serious Superbowl contenders in about 3 years.\n4 Posted 27/11/2024 at 10:45:02\nThe risk for the club is that, once the novelty wears off, unless there is evidence of progress on the pitch, people will start to opt out – especially if prices are high.\nThe hope for the club is that the extra revenue, while it will come nowhere near to bridging the gap between ourselves and the rich clubs, will enable us to compete once again in the top half of the table. It will only be an enabler. We will also need great recruitment and coaching just to get in the Top 10.\n5 Posted 27/11/2024 at 10:57:21\nPerhaps, with the demise of many pubs in areas outside of city centres and greater demands from work and family, the only occasion you can have a few pints and catch-up with mates is on a matchday. The match itself has, for a lot of people, become a secondary attraction rather than the main event of their day.\nThere will be a time when the paying customers say that enough is enough, but that doesn't appear to be on the horizon just yet, although Manchester United and Everton fans are beginning to show opposition to price increases.\nAnd ahead of Sunday's match, the United faithful are preparing to once again protest. United fan group The 1958 have announced that they will be meeting on Sunday at the Trinity Statue for 12:30 pm. This comes after United decided to raise match tickets for Members to £66 per game for the remainder of the season, without consulting any fan groups. It's a further sign that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS don't care about loyal fans and only want our money. Now we need answers and change to these policies. Anyone wanting to take their kid to a game for the remainder of the season will be expected to do so at the same price because there are no differences. £66 a pop either way. United and Everton fans are planning to display a banner before the game.\n6 Posted 27/11/2024 at 11:04:16\nIt's important that we use the new stadium to generate additional income that has long been lacking, hence we fell behind despite Moshiri writing cheques.\nHopefully Friedkin will change things and, slowly but surely, we can catch up. It won't happen overnight, but we can get closer.\n7 Posted 27/11/2024 at 11:36:52\nThe days of vociferous ne'er do wells and brainless chumps with little in their life and even less money has gone. They provided the irrational tribal hatred and seeded the atmosphere and they've been priced out.\nIn a million years, I never thought Man Utd, Arsenal, Villa, Man City and the like, including Liverpool, would have such anodyne atmospheres but they do. The game is working from memories of excitement past but the fact is, if you have a bit of spare cash and don't like wood turning or glass blowing, it's still quite a different communal experience.\nI occasionally watch Tardelli's goal and celebration in the '82 World Cup and realise how much we have lost since those days.\nNot that it matters… it's a good day out.\n8 Posted 27/11/2024 at 12:45:39\nI've been a Blue for around 73 years and I'm still hopeful we'll turn the corner before I pop my clogs. You never know but one thing is for sure...\nSky money has ruined the game we all used to revere and the sad thing on which to reflect is that it's our cash – the fans' – who have supplied it with our subscriptions – though not me any more!\nKeep the faith, gents. It's our only hope.\n9 Posted 27/11/2024 at 14:40:48\nEverton have been unique in having the long dark shadow of a certain William Kenwright hanging over us for almost 30 years. Who knows what would have happened had the move to Kings Dock gone through in 2002 - amazing it's been that long. Or if Kenwright had never gotten control in the first place.\nThe '90s were an odd period for us. We till had fresh(-ish) memories of the '80s glory years. Not just winning trophies but getting to 4 FA Cup finals in 6 seasons. Granted we only won one but we basically made it to the semis almost every year then.\nJoe Royle's Dogs of War aside, we were crap in the ‘90s. Mike Walker and Howard Kendall Mk III seasons were disastrous with last-day miracles needed to stay up. Walter Smith's years only marginally better.\nOther than the odd season since, we've really started every one hoping not to be involved near the bottom. Moyes did a great job at the start but we were never more than ‘best of the rest'. Had no cash and were buying from Poundland most of the time. This mentality was naturally a clash for the older of us fans who can remember the ‘80s. Moshiri's dollars gave us hope but with Kenwright in control, we never had a chance.\nOn a positive, the marketing guys at Sky have done a phenomenal job to get the brand where it is. Hence sold out stadiums at most Premier League games, despite the high ticket prices. This has helped any club managing to stay in the league – including us. Albeit, the higher the TV money, the higher the player wages, so only the players (and managers and agents) are really winning.\nSo what now? Who knows. However, I think the current Sky 4 or 6 isn't permanent. Every now and then, someone new will crash the party, like Man City did. They will however need cash, a clear strategy and luck. Man Utd are a case in point that dynasties don't last forever, regardless the amount of money spent. They've been a car crash ever since putting Moyes in charge, 11 years ago now. Imagine how their fans feel after the dominance of the Fergie years.\nWho that newcomer will be, time will tell. Aston Villa seem on a good run, wheels coming off at Man City and, like you said, likes of Brighton and Forest doing well. Unfortunately for us, like death and taxes, them across the park always seem there or thereabouts!\nThings looking up for us with TFG - it's the hope that kills though. We'd all take mid-table for a couple of years if offered now!\n10 Posted 27/11/2024 at 16:28:58\nI still think we may be faced with the said 6 having more and more European games, and then fielding their second string in the Premier League – we are moving that way rapidly.\nAs for ambition from other clubs, I speak with a Preston mate who is desperate to get into the Premier League, because his team hasn't been there; to Sheffield Utd fans who want to win their league but don't want to be promoted as they prefer what they see in the Championship; and Man City fans who secretly confide it was more fun when they were in the 3rd tier.\nHeaven knows where that leaves us.\n11 Posted 27/11/2024 at 16:55:30\nIt's big a shame how the money is taking over the game. If in doubt have a watch of Saudi Pro League, Kick Off on Netflix – entertaining, but a difficult watch.\n12 Posted 27/11/2024 at 19:50:36\nI also watch Marine at 6th tier level. Everyone (including me) was very excited last season as they reached a play-off position, then won a fantastic match to gain promotion. This season there has been grumbling as the team has struggled to score goals and match the pace in their new surroundings.\nOn Saturday and Sunday mornings it's watching the grandsons' Under 9 and Under 11 games. There, the teams play a few games at the start of the season, then the league is split so that teams of equal level play against each other to minimise the risk of high-scoring victories or defeats. Even then, there are mutterings about skullduggery, suggestions that one or two managers contrive to get their team into a lesser league so they can win it!\n13 Posted 27/11/2024 at 20:02:41\n14 Posted 27/11/2024 at 20:04:52\n15 Posted 27/11/2024 at 20:15:18\nSavage still goes on about pulling us out of the bag for the Spurs game.\nAnd Nunez dives as if he was hit by prime Tyson.\n16 Posted 27/11/2024 at 21:14:09\nI'd hate to see a closed, non-relagation league system like many US sports. However, they do have some good systems to keep things competitive.\nThe draft system couldn't work in football here. We don't have the college system and clubs run academies themselves.\nBut a system of spending cap could work. Whereby the league winners are capped at a level and then that cap rises sliding down the table.\nSomething has to be done. No-one will want to continue watching the same 3-4 teams win the league. Yes, you may get a sellout at The Emirates, Old Trafford, or The Etihad but when they have to play half their matches in half-empty stadiums due to fans being dismayed that they can't compete, then the magic will wear off!\nA levelling of the playing field is needed. Sport is meant to be played on a level playing field. How can one team spend £500M in a season and another spend £10M and it be considered level??\nIf we let football be run in a 'survival of the fittest' capitalist way, then like all the old brands of the past, clubs will disappear.\nLike the supermarkets, they will just be left to crush their weaker competitors, which is fine in business, but this is sport, these are in some cases historic, integral community institutions that can't just be left to be crushed.\nLevel the Football Field!!!\n17 Posted 28/11/2024 at 17:37:46\nI'm confused – I thought we were away? Why are Man Utd fans meeting at the Trinity Statue??\n18 Posted 28/11/2024 at 17:48:14\nTheir Trinity Statue isn't the Holy Trinity!!\nBest, Law and Charlton.\n19 Posted 28/11/2024 at 19:17:58\nWhen I first started watching football, eons ago, it seemed that everyone had a chance of winning the title at the beginning of each season.\nIt was almost the case that, each season, a different team did win it and it was fun to watch and exciting to follow your team.\nNowadays, like you said, you can virtually guarantee the top six teams every season and just hope that we survive to fight (survive) another day.\nIt's soul-destroying… but it is what it is for the foreseeable future. After all, what is the alternative?\n20 Posted 28/11/2024 at 20:15:19\nIf you add in the fact that you can't even spend money that you might have to buy the very best players to try and compete with them, it does seem pretty hopeless.\n21 Posted 01/12/2024 at 08:15:54\nThe question that I ask is what business is a Premier League Club in.Ray Kroc owner not founder of McDonald's use to ask what business is McDonald 's in ?Everyone would answer fast food, Ray would say no, McDonald 's is in the Real Estate Business.McDonald 's make their money out of the Property, which is open 24 hour and provide the franchise to run a business to pay the rent.They also get paid for doing that.\nPremier League Clubs make their money out of Property and selling Media rights and that is the business they are in.The Football end is a franchise and in the States are called franchises.\nWhilst the McDonalds Customers eat shit, we watch shit and talk about it.The affinity with the brand may be stronger since Everton are still Community based, but if Everton were more successful it would probably be similar.You would be sitting beside alot more on a resale ticket.Resale tickets are a regular feature of local Sauna life.\nDavid you ask alot of pertinent questions about competition, which the Premier League has managed to turn into a lucrative proposition without having to do anything about.They basically have strengthen the watch and talk shit model.\nIn my case I don't watch any games other than Everton games and don't have any interest in other teams only in relationship to Everton.I only stay up to watch Match of the day if Everton win, since it is inevitably the last game.There must be other Evertonians in the same boat, since Gary Linekar welcomed our return. I did get to attend the odd game and use the attend quite a few Premier League games, but to plan in advance attendance would not fit my busy schedule, which often changes. If I did go I would hope to meet other Toffeewebbers.I don't listen to any commenters and watch matches with no commentary..I am totally happy with the Live Forum and half time reading the main article comments.Listening to Keane who was a Management Clown is something I am not going to do. The names of the other I do not bother to remember, except Jimmy White with the yellow tie, Moshiri's mate.\nYou comment regarding the Premier League being' the best League in the world' I totally agree with.The Friedkin Group take over if it happens, is not going to be a quick fix.I now conclude that Takeover is the wrong word. It is a Complex Financial reconstruction which will take years.\nKenwright got it right in that the Competition had gone and it was about survival in the Premier League.The problem was that they filled their pockets and had a self preservation Management structure that only did that whilst other Clubs developed their franchise.The Football is not as good as it use to be and alot of the players are more hype than ability, even at Everton.\nI expect Everton to improve over the years to come.A problem normally takes as long to get out of as it took to get into it.The competition question you raised asks a fundamental question, which might bite the ass of the Premier League in the future, but I suspect that enhanced European and World League will be the way it goes.Grass roots football seems to be undergoing a revival to fill the vacuum, with alot of involvement and support.\n22 Posted 01/12/2024 at 08:30:00\nOver the last 4-5 seasons particularly I have become disillusioned and at times numb to the grotesque sums of money and the absolute farce of a league that stands before us.\nVAR was only implemented to appease the \"Sly 6\" when they felt aggrieved and of course, so much money was at stake if a decision went against them. Alas, VAR only ended up heightening the disparity and inequality of the decision making, shining a light on the \"extra man behind the extra man\" for the big teams. Exacerbating our anger and frustration in the process.\nI am hoping BMD and a new manager will re-energise me but in all honesty, I don't think it will. Don't get me wrong, I am desperate for us to do well, when we lose it still ruins my weekend. However, in the last years I have just felt almost accepting of our powerlessness towards the corruption and ineptitude of the so called greatest league in the world.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
