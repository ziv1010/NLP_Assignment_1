That happened before too, but now it is a league where everyone plays against everyone and it is not easy for anyone.”\nRead Also: NFF treatment: Kalu slams Libya Football Federation, urges CAF to sanction\nAtletico seem to be still adjusting to the change, with two wins and two losses as they sit 23rd in the 36-team standings – just inside the playoff positions.\nThey came from a goal down to win 2-1 at Paris St Germain last time out through a last-gasp goal from Angel Correa.\n“The Champions League demands the most from you. It forces you to win,” said Simeone, who celebrated his 700th game as Atletico coach last weekend.\nRivals Sparta, fourth in the Czech First League, have won once in their four Champions League games. They have failed to win in six of their last seven matches in all competitions.\n“They’re tough opponents … and at home they have a fast pace,” Simeone added. “I can’t imagine any other situation than taking this game to where we think we can do some damage.\n“It often happens that all teams, at home and at the start of games, show intensity and strength. It’s logical as they are with their fans. You have to adapt to the pace of that start. We’re away from home and the opponent will push very hard.",
