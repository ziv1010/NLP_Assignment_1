But then, out of nowhere, Nikola Karczewska scored for Spurs to, in theory, make things interesting for the final few minutes.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, things never really got uncomfortable for Chelsea. And that is because this Chelsea team don’t do uncomfortable.\nEmma Hayes’ side are built differently. Even when this team have their backs against the wall, they tend to find a way to win. Their 3-2 victory over Tottenham was just the latest example within the past year of the west London club digging in to claim vital points.\nIt has happened time and time again.\nTake March 13 last year — entering the business end of the season. Chelsea looked to be dropping points at home to Aston Villa after being frustrated for 90 goalless minutes but Sam Kerr managed to run onto the end of a long ball and flick it home in the 92nd minute to keep them firmly in the title race.\nThen, away to Spurs on April 24, Chelsea were a player down following goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger’s first-half dismissal and drawing 1-1 with 20 minutes to go. Up popped Kerr again to put Hayes’ side in front before Jessie Fleming made it 3-1 in added time. The win kept Chelsea top of the table.\nOn May 8, the final day of the season, Chelsea came from a goal down twice against Manchester United to secure a third straight WSL title with a 4-2 victory. Kerr scored a second-half double to get her team over the line.\nFast forward to January 15. Arsenal are leading Chelsea 1-0 at the Emirates Stadium in the 89th minute but Kerr pops up and… OK, you get the picture.\nThe trend here isn’t just the Australia striker’s habit of delivering match-saving moments when Chelsea need her most, it’s also that Hayes’ team never know when they are beaten.\nIt goes a long way to explaining why they have lost just once in 25 WSL matches and only one of their past 24 London derbies.\nThe ruthlessness and winning mentality in Chelsea’s DNA has not only led them to those three consecutive titles, but back-to-back FA Cup final triumphs and a Champions League final. They are currently two points clear at the top of the table again.\nAdvertisement\nIt has become part of the mentality of every single member of the squad — including midfielder Erin Cuthbert (top image), who embodies their intense, never-say-die spirit on the pitch.\n“I think there’s just such a big desire in the dressing room to get what we want,” Cuthbert tells The Athletic on a shoot for a new Adidas boot range the Scottish player is promoting.\n“I think it’s kind of been no secret that Europe’s been one of our ambitions, but you can’t lose sight of that too quickly because teams in the league are getting stronger — Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City. At the minute, it’s a four-horse race and we’re going toe-to-toe with them.”\nCuthbert, a 54-cap Scotland international who has been at the club since a 2016 move from Glasgow City, believes this season has seen Chelsea’s long-held winning mentality combine with an added focus on marginal gains, and that this has helped propel the team forward again.\n“I think the training intensity went up,” Cuthbert says. “The resources off the pitch and the attention to detail in the data they are using really went up another level. I think more than ever it’s now (about) the one per cent and two per cent marginal gains.”\nCuthbert says Chelsea’s well-documented focus on their players’ menstrual cycles has been a big factor, but also the fact there has been a shift in how the club look at physical data.\nThe 24-year-old says the club are not just looking at typical data such as the distance run in a game, but also looking at the finer details — training load, age, injury history and playing time with a national team.\nThis more “holistic” approach is important to Cuthbert.\nShe explains: “There is constant communication as to where we need to be and it’s not a case of six months later they say, ‘No, you are not where you need to be’, it’s continuous monitoring. That’s what I like — knowing I’m on track. We have now got enough resources and coaches to pull them for individual meetings and speak with them about what we need to improve.”\nAdvertisement\nThat has been put into practice on the training pitch, too, where Chelsea have been focusing on scenario-based drills.\nCuthbert says: “We are playing 11-a-side in training and Emma’s like, ‘Well, this team’s 3-0 down — how do you get yourself back in it?’, and, ‘What about if the other team goes 1-0 up? How do you defend the lead?’.\n“So I think having those experiences every day is going to help us and translate into the game — like against Arsenal when we were down and we had to work out how to fight our way back into the game. I’ll take multiple punches. Keep hitting me, but I’m going to stand back up and I’m going to show myself.\n“We have a lot of people who can stand up and be counted in big moments and I think that’s really important as well. It’s not just about the team, we need individuals to be able to flourish under pressure because Chelsea is a high-pressure environment. If you can’t take it, you will never survive at the club.”\nCuthbert says there has been work on the psychological side of things, too, including getting players to understand each other’s personality styles and types.\nAs Chelsea’s mentality has shifted, so has that of their manager. Cuthbert has spoken before about how Hayes, 46, has been like a mother figure to her since she moved to London at just 18, and she believes her leadership style has evolved.\n“She has changed a lot since she had her son; she became a little bit more empathetic. She can be a bit ruthless at times, but that’s how I like it. I’m Scottish. I like directness. So that’s why me and Emma got on so well. I understand that not everyone might take to that, which is completely fine.\n“She is more driven than she has ever been. It’s always what she wants next, or where she’s going to get to. That fire is still there.”\nChelsea go to West Ham for a Continental Cup semi-final on Thursday as they attempt to reach what could be the first of three cup finals this season.\nBeating Spurs means they will also go into this month’s international break top of the table and possessing an aura that nothing can phase them this season — something which, according to Cuthbert, is no coincidence.\n(Top photo: Harriet Lander – Chelsea FC/Getty Images)",
