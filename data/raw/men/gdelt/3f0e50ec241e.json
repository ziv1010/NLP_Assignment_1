They are used to playing in this environment and I hope they can do their best.\n“At the same time, we have to be very smart and play a smart game because they will pressure us. But our players are experienced. “We are very excited, and I feel very good about the match. The team has very positive vibes and I hope we can qualify from Tabriz, inshaallah.”\nAshoor praised and thanked the hosts for the warm welcome they have received since arriving in Iran on Sunday.\n“We are very happy to reach here,” he said. “The hospitality was very nice, from the airport, to the hotel, and to our training pitch.”\nAs part of the pre-match formalities, Ashoor and Khaldiya’s Bahrain international defender Sayed Mahdi Baqer spoke with media yesterday in a Press conference held in Tabriz. The official technical meeting also took place between match officials and representatives from both Khaldiya and Tractor, where it was confirmed that the Bahrainis will wear their black kits and the Iranians will be in their red uniforms.\nIn Khaldiya’s opening-leg defeat at the National Stadium in Riffa last week, Mohammed Al Rumaihi scored the game’s opening goal for the home side but then Tractor’s Amirhossein Hosseinzadeh and Croatian Domagoj Drozdek were on target to give the Iranians the win and the all-important two away goals.\nThe winners of this round-of-16 affair will move on to the quarter-finals to face the victors of the other head-to-head between Al Wakrah of Qatar and Al Taawoun of Saudi Arabia. Wakrah and Taawoun played to a 2-2 draw in their first leg contest in Doha, and will next lock horns tomorrow in the Saudi city of Buraidah.\nFollowing this phase, games in the quarters are scheduled to be held next month while the semi-finals will take place in April. Both rounds will be held over two legs. The ACL Two then culminates in a single-game final on May 17.\nThe ACL Two is the second-tier club competition of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). Rebranded from the AFC Cup, it is one level below the AFC Champions League Elite and one above the AFC Challenge League.\npatrick@gdnmedia.bh\nTop stories for today:\nEuropeans talk up more defence spending as Ukraine plan divides\n212 traders pledge to keep Ramadan prices stable\nMedical team congratulated on landmark success",
