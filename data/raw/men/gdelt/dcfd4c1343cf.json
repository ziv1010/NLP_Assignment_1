Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nWould Ben White be a good signing for Liverpool?\nWhether Arne Slot is overseeing Liverpool’s transfer business in the summer or not, a raft of defensive signings is to be anticipated. The quintet of Alisson, Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold underpinned much of the club’s recent success, but only one of that famous five is likely to command a starting role next season.\nJoe Gomez, too, is almost certain to depart, while youngster Giovanni Leoni will take time to get back up to speed having suffered a cruel season-ending injury on what had been a promising debut back in September.\nWhite, therefore, ticks a number of boxes for Liverpool were they to register formal interest. The 28-year-old boasts a wealth of Premier League experience and despite representing one of the blocks Mikel Arteta built his resurgent Arsenal upon, there remains a sense that there is still more to come from a player who has endured a difficult 18 months.\nInitially signed as a centre-half, White’s opportunities have been severely limited in that role over the last few seasons on account of the partnership William Saliba and Gabriel have built.\nEven when the opportunity arose to deputise earlier this term, Arteta opted to restore Jurrien Timber to the heart of his defence and keep White in the right-back role he had thrived in prior to knee surgery.\nWith competition for places intense, it remains to be seen how content White would be with a bit-part role moving forwards but with his contract not due to expire until 2028 there is no need for player or club to rush a decision.\nHe would be unlikely to command an automatic starting spot at Anfield and although his versatility would be seen as a key asset, his levels of durability are not what they once were.\nAfter he was required to play three games in the space of a week earlier this season in the absence of Timber, a hamstring injury felt almost inevitable and when it duly arrived he, himself, was rule out for three weeks.\nWith Liverpool’s current right-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley having struggled to maintain their fitness and avoid injuries this term, a more dependable option would arguably serve the Reds better.\nJames Goldman | Metro Head of Sport\nWhite has been linked with a move to Everton in the last 24 hours and although Arsenal are unwilling to sell, Murphy believes the player might force his club’s hand were Liverpool to register interest.\nHe told BoyleSports: ‘Ben White to Liverpool would make sense but Arsenal might not want to sell to a rival.\n‘It would depend on how adamant the player is that he wants to go. If Ben White was an option, I think that would be a good option for Liverpool.\n‘I think he’s a really good footballer, he’s a big lad. Yes, he’s had a couple of injury problems recently, but he’s an experienced guy, he’s played a lot of games and he can play centre-back and right-back.\n‘The obvious good thing for Liverpool would be in that negotiation, if that was something that was to materialise, would be that any player would rather go to Liverpool than Everton, I’m not saying that because I’m a Red, I’m saying that because Liverpool are competing for the Champions League, you know, still in the top four, still in the FA Cup.\n‘Whereas Everton are obviously out of the FA Cup, they’re not competing for European competitions.\n‘I wouldn’t see why if Liverpool were keen, then why he wouldn’t try and force that move, having said that I’d find it strange to think that Arsenal would let him go. Or they might just think they’re too far ahead of Liverpool anyway, so we’ll have to see how that plays out.’\nArteta, meanwhile, said it is his ‘mission’ to knock Chelsea out of the Carabao Cup and deliver Arsenal’s first major trophy in almost six years after last season’s “painful” semi-final exit.\nArteta could be missing four defenders for the opening-leg clash at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. Riccardo Calafiori, Piero Hincapie and Cristhian Mosquera are all certainly out, while there are significant doubts over William Saliba’s fitness.\nArsenal failed to progress to the final of the Carabao Cup last year following an emphatic 4-0 aggregate defeat by Newcastle.\nPrefer us to the others?

Arteta’s sole silverware as Arsenal manager so far remains the 2020 FA Cup.\nHowever, they head into Wednesday’s first leg still fighting on all four fronts. The Gunners are top of both the Premier League and Champions League, and through to the fourth round of the FA Cup following their 4-1 win at Portsmouth on Sunday.\nAnd Arteta said: ‘Football gives you another chance. We have been really consistent again in this competition and now we have to knock another big team out to be in the final. That is the mission.\n‘Hopefully we have learned from last year because it was painful, especially in the manner that the games went, and the amount of chances we missed to go through. So this year we want to be better and more efficient.\nMore Trending\n‘When you get to this stage in the competition, you get to the final, and you get it over the line and win it, it brings a different kind of energy.\n‘It brings belief and the sense that the objective is very, very close and that is a massive motivation for everybody.’\nThe absences of Calafiori, Hincapie, Mosquera and potentially Saliba on Wednesday could force Arteta to play a makeshift back four at Stamford Bridge with Christian Norgaard on call to play alongside Gabriel at centre-half.\nLeandro Trossard, who has scored seven times this season, is another who may not be fit enough to play.\nMORE: Per Mertesacker named as ‘hot candidate’ for new job after Arsenal exit announcement\nMORE: Arne Slot makes Arsenal and Mikel Arteta claim after Liverpool win in FA Cup\nMORE: Chelsea vs Arsenal: Predicted lineups today and Carabao Cup team news",
