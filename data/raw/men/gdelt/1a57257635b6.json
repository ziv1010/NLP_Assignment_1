Whether it’s waking up at odd hours or passionately debating tactics, their commitment is extraordinary. Through this campaign, Heineken is creating inclusive spaces to celebrate that passion in a premium and engaging way,” she said.\nDuring the quarter-final round, venues such as Mania House in Victoria Island, Lagos, and Papiees Maestro in Abuja were transformed into football viewing arenas.\nFans enjoyed high-quality broadcasts, Heineken hospitality, and an atmosphere that mirrored Europe’s biggest stadiums.\nJulius Obinna, a fan who attended the Abuja event, praised the initiative.\n“The experience was electric. It brought people together and made us feel like we were part of something global,” he said.\nIn addition to live events, Heineken has produced a campaign film directed by award-winning filmmaker Mark Molloy.\nThe film, which is central to the campaign, humorously and emotionally explores what it means to be a true football fan.\nIt features real-life fan stories and aims to challenge the perception of what a “hardcore” fan looks like.\nWith the Champions League final fast approaching, Heineken’s campaign continues to build excitement.\nMore viewing events are planned nationwide, ensuring fans remain at the heart of the action.\n“This campaign is not just about the game,” Shadeko added. “It’s about the shared experiences, the community, and the joy that football brings. That is what Cheers to the Real Hardcore Fans stands for.”",
