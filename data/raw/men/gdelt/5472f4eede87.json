  "body_text": "Ancelotti joins Brazil with Xabi Alonso set to replace former Madrid boss\nFive-time UEFA Champions League winner Carlo Ancelotti has been newly appointed as the head coach of the record five-time World Cup winning Brazil national team. This comes after speculation that the Italian would be leaving his current club, Real Madrid, at the end of the season. The CBF, Brazil’s football federation, has declared this move a “statement to the world” that they are ready to reclaim the throne at the top of world football. Reports have since emerged that Xabi Alonso will take his place, with Alonso announcing his departure from Bayer Leverkusen after two and a half years at the club.\nIt is no surprise that the most successful nation in world football has decided to hire one of football’s most successful managers. Ancelotti has enjoyed success at every corner of his career, winning domestic league titles with Real Madrid, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, and A.C. Milan. Most notably, it is his prolificacy in European football that has garnered praise.\nAncelotti’s reputation for success undoubtedly has been the driving force behind this move\nAncelotti has won two Champions League titles with Milan and three with Madrid, including the famous 2013/14 title, won after a 93rd minute equaliser from captain Sergio Ramos. However, his second stint in Madrid is coming to a not so rosy end. Fierce rivals Barcelona have just secured the La Liga title, and Madrid’s earlier elimination from the Champions League, at the hands of Mikel Arteta and Arsenal, perhaps suggested a need for the club to change direction.\nBut it has been clear for a number of years that Brazil also needs to rebuild. The Selecao’s last World Cup triumph came in 2002, and the team seems to have lost its star power, failing to reach the semi-finals in four of the last five tournaments since. Brazil have now hired their fifth coach in the last two and a half years and national criticism has only grown worse, especially as arch-rivals Argentina now hold the World Cup and Copa America title simultaneously. Ancelotti’s reputation for success undoubtedly has been the driving force behind this move, and he will be expected to deliver it.\nAlonso has reportedly played a role in the recent acquisition of Dean Huijsen\nXabi Alonso on the other hand, is looking to build on an impressive start to his managerial career. His first role was for three years at Real Sociedad B, the reserve side of the La Liga club. In 2022, the Spaniard joined German side Bayer Leverkusen on an initial two year deal. Alonso surely made his mark – he guided Leverkusen to an impressive league and cup double, in which his team were unbeaten. They fell short of a Europa League title after defeat to Atalanta in the final.\nNow, the former Madridista is set to take the reins at the club he holds close to his heart. The 2024/25 season was not one to remember for Los Blancos, and their hopes of comeback are pinned on the fresh outlook Alonso will bring to the club. And it seems that he wants to hit the ground running. Alonso has reportedly played a role in the recent acquisition of promising 20 year-old centre back Dean Huijsen from Bournemouth, who he will see as key to his project.\nAll eyes will now be on both managers, who have certainly been given a formidable task. It will be a landmark on their career journeys for either the right or wrong reasons. Interestingly, this point in time marks a new era for both the club and country, but it will remain to be seen if expectation becomes celebration.",
