Both consist of two-legged ties.\nThe 15 teams progressing from round 1 have joined the clubs beginning at this stage, which include two-time champions and 2022/23 runners-up Wolfsburg, Paris Saint-Germain, another of last season's quarter-finalists in Roma and sole remaining newcomers Man United.\nRound 2 ties (10/11 & 18/19 October)\nChampions path\nApollon Ladies FC (CYP) vs SL Benfica (POR)\nFC Zürich (SUI) vs AFC Ajax (NED)\nAS Roma (ITA) vs FC Vorskla (UKR)\nValur (ISL) vs SKN St. Pölten Frauen (AUT)\nSK Slavia Praha (CZE) vs AS FC Universitatea Olimpia Cluj (ROU)\nGlasgow City FC (SCO) vs SK Brann (NOR)\nŽFK Spartak Subotica (SRB) vs FC Rosengård (SWE)\nLeague path\nBK Häcken FF (SWE) vs FC Twente (NED)\nReal Madrid CF (ESP) vs Vålerenga Fotball (NOR)\nEintracht Frankfurt (GER) vs AC Sparta Praha (CZE)\nParis FC (FRA) vs VfL Wolfsburg (GER)\nManchester United Women (ENG) vs Paris Saint-Germain (FRA)\nMeet the teams\n• Eintracht Frankfurt (who knocked out Juventus in round 1) won four titles under their previous guise of 1. FFC Frankfurt. In 2005/06 they drew 1-1 with Sparta in the second qualifying round, both teams getting through the group.\n• The 2022/23 runners-up Wolfsburg are two-time champions. Paris Saint-Germain are twice runners-up.\n• Paris Saint-Germain and Roma (on debut) reached last season's quarter-finals. Glasgow City, Häcken, Real Madrid, Slavia Praha, Sparta Praha and Valur have previously made the quarter-finals, while Paris FC (who knocked out Arsenal) got to the 2012/13 semis under the name Juvisy.\n• Benfica and Madrid, like Paris Saint-Germain and Wolfsburg, aim to keep up their record of reaching the group stage every season since its 2021/22 introduction (the four automatic entrants already know they will do so). Hoping to return after featuring in last season's group stage, along with Roma, are Rosengård, Slavia Praha, St. Pölten and Zürich. Häcken appeared in the 2021/22 group stage.\n• Manchester United are making their debut. Their defender Hannah Blundell scored against Paris Saint-Germain for Chelsea in the 2018/19 quarter-finals.\n• Cyprus, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Scotland and Serbia are yet to be represented in the group stage.\nSeason calendar\nRound 2\nFirst leg: 10/11 October\nSecond leg: 18/19 October\nGroup stage draw\n20 October, Nyon\nGroup stage\nMatchday 1: 14/15 November\nMatchday 2: 22/23 November\nMatchday 3: 13/14 December\nMatchday 4: 20/21 December\nMatchday 5: 24/25 January\nMatchday 6: 30/31 January\nQuarter-final & semi-final draw\n6 February, Nyon\nQuarter-finals\nFirst leg: 19/20 March\nSecond leg: 27/28 March\nSemi-finals\nFirst leg: 20/21 April\nSecond leg: 27/28 April\nFinal (San Mamés, Bilbao)\n25 May\nHow the draw worked\n- The teams in each path were seeded into two pots, in accordance with the club coefficient rankings.\n- Clubs from the same association could be drawn against each other.\n- The club drawn first in each tie plays the first leg at home.\nChampions path\nIn accordance with paragraphs 13.03 and 13.05 of the Regulations of the UEFA Women’s Champions League 2023/24, the UEFA administration seeded clubs for the round 2 draw based on the club coefficient rankings established at the start of the season.\nThe 14 teams were divided equally into seven seeded teams and seven unseeded teams.\nDraw procedure\nTwo pots were prepared, one for the seeded teams and the other for the unseeded teams.\nThe balls containing the seeded teams were placed in a bowl marked ‘Seeded’ and the balls containing the unseeded teams were placed in a bowl marked ‘Unseeded’.\nOne ball was taken from each bowl and placed in a large empty bowl, where they were shuffled. The first team drawn will play its first match at home against the second team drawn.\nThe same procedure was carried out with the remaining balls to complete all the round 2 pairings.\nRound 2 champions path contenders and coefficients\nSeeded\nSK Slavia Praha (CZE) 39.233*\nFC Rosengård (SWE) 33.399*\nSKN St. Pölten Frauen (AUT) 30.050\nGlasgow City FC (SCO) 29.100\nSL Benfica (POR) 22.800\nFC Zürich (SUI) 22.250\nAS Roma (ITA) 21.000*\nUnseeded\nAFC Ajax (NED) 18.400\nŽFK Spartak Subotica (SRB) 16.800\nFC Vorskla (UKR) 12.000\nApollon Ladies FC (CYP) 11.800\nValur (ISL) 10.200\nAS FC Universitatea Olimpia Cluj (ROU) 9.600\nSK Brann (NOR) 7.100\n*Entering in round 2\nLeague path\nIn accordance with paragraphs 13.03 and 13.05 of the Regulations of the UEFA Women’s Champions League 2023/24, the UEFA administration seeded clubs for the round 2 draw based on the club coefficient rankings established at the start of the season.\nThe ten teams were divided equally into five seeded teams and five unseeded teams.\nClubs from the same association could not be drawn against each other.

Similarly, when completing the next tie, the home team would be drawn from the relevant bowl in order to respect the seeding principles.
