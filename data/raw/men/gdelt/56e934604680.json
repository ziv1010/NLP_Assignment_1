  "body_text": "It was a season to remember for two of our brightest Hale End products in Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri.\nAfter making his debut at just 15 years and 181 days old in 2022, Ethan went on to have a big impact in 2024/25, scoring nine goals across all competitions.\nMyles, meanwhile, made his first team debut against Bolton in September 2024 and became a mainstay in Mikel Arteta's side, starting 26 matches.\nTo celebrate their seasons, we've crunched the numbers to reveal some incredible stats about our teenage sensations!\nEthan NWaneri\nStarting off with the youngest player in Premier League history, Ethan's rise has been well documented since stepping onto the pitch at Brentford in September 2022.\nIn 2024/25, our attacker opened his account with a brace against Bolton Wanderers in the Carabao Cup, which saw him become our youngest goal scorer since Jack Wilshere vs Sheffield United in September 2008 and the youngest player to net 2+ goals in a game for us since Arturo Lupoli vs Everton in November 2004.\nHe followed that up with another goal against Preston in the fourth round to become the youngest player in our history to score in each of his first two starts.\nIn the Premier League, Ethan would announce himself against Nottingham Forest in November 2024, where he became our second youngest Premier League scorer, behind Cesc Fabregas, as well as being our youngest English goalscorer in the league since Stewart Robson vs Southampton in May 1982.\nEthan continued to find the net throughout the season, including a superb strike in our 5-1 victory over Manchester City in February 2025. The goal concluded the longest passing sequence leading to a goal in the Premier League in 24/25, finishing off a move of 36 uninterrupted passes, lasting one minute and 58 seconds and involved every outfield player.\nDuring our run to the Champions League semi-finals, the Englishman netted in our final league phase contest against Girona, becoming the second youngest Englishman to score a UEFA Champions League goal after Jude Bellingham.\nHe bagged his eighth goal of the season in our incredible 7-1 victory over PSV Eindhoven in the round of 16, where he became the fourth youngest player to score a goal in the knockout rounds of the competition, behind Bojan, Lamine Yamal and Bellingham.\nOverall, Ethan appeared in 37 matches this season, the fourth highest of any teenager across Europe's top five leagues. A total of 29 of Nwaneri’s 37 games in 2024/25 came before his 18th birthday, the most appearances by a player for the club while aged 17 or younger since Theo Walcott in 2006-07 (31).\nmyles Lewis-skelly\nHaving become an integral part of the first team, Myles' 39 appearances last season were the most by a player for the club while aged 18 or younger since Fabregas in 2005-06 (47), and the most by an Englishman since Stewart Robson in 1982-83 (49).\nWhile his season started with a yellow card as a substitute against Manchester City, it would end as the player with the second-best duel success rate among Premier League players to contest 100+ duels.\nHaving played 85% of his minutes in Premier League 2 as a midfielder, Myles quickly shone at left-back in the first team. Our versatile teenager played 98% of his Premier League minutes at left-back and just 2% in central midfield.\nMyles scored his first goal for the club in the 5-1 win over Manchester City. With both Myles and Ethan getting on the scoresheet that day, it was the first time we had two teenagers score in the same match since September 1986 against Sheffield Wednesday (Tony Adams and Niall Quinn).\nOur academy product was rewarded for his sparkling form with a call-up to the England national team in March 2025. Against Albania, he became the youngest player in history to score on his senior England debut and third youngest goal scorer for the Three Lions overall, behind Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen.\nHe is now one of four players to score on his England debut while playing his club football for us after Ted Drake (November 1934), Alfred Kirchen (May 1937) and Francis Jeffers (February 2003).\nMyles started both matches against PSG in our Champions League semi-final, making him the youngest ever Englishman to start a Champions League semi-final and the youngest player to do so for a Premier League club overall.\nAll stats provided by Opta\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
