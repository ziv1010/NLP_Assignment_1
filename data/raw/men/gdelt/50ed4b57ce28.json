  "body_text": "Vivianne Miedema's superb display of skill against Everton is third in our 2022/23 women's Goal of the Season poll, as voted for by supporters.\nIn a classic moment of Miedema magic in the penalty area, our Dutch forward shrugged off two Everton defenders to ping the ball into the top corner of Emily Ramsey's net. The 1-0 win back in December 2022 was one of Viv's last games before sustaining a season-ending ACL injury against Lyon in the Champions League.\nRelive Viv's strike by hitting play on the video above.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
