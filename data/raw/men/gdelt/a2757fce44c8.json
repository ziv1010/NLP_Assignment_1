Users can upload a video and see their top swing fault for free. Premium features are available at two pricing options: $24.99/month or $149.99/year. An entire year of instruction from Mustard Golfs elite coaches costs less than the average price of just one in-person golf lesson.\nThe platform allows a player to video their swing without the need for added sensors or equipment and analyzes the swing using AI developed through motion capture and 3D models of thousands of professional and amateur swings. The app provides an understandable report card of any golf swings strengths and areas for improvement, as well as a customized plan for improvement from some of the most successful coaches and players in the game.\nGolf Digest, the recognized leader in golf instruction for more than seven decades, has collaborated closely with Mustard over the last 18 months, helping to guide the development of the AI-powered platform to infuse the two most important features of great coaching:\n- Accurate Measurement: Mustards patented computer vision and AI system, developed through analysis of thousands of swings and 3D movement scans, can recognize and adjust measurements, allowing for more consistency of measurement regardless of how the video was captured.\n- Customized Instruction: There have long been tools on the market that can help a player recognize certain issues in their swing, but Mustard is the first application that interprets those issues holistically. The platform harnesses the expertise of the best coaches in the sport and delivers an AI-generated plan for improvement that is customized to the needs of the individual golfer, presented in priority order, just like how top teachers structure private lessons.\nOur mission at Mustard is to democratize the worlds best coaching. We do that by partnering with the leading instructors in a sport and using our proprietary technology to deliver personalized analysis and instruction to athletes of all abilities, said Mustard CEO and co-founder Rocky Collis. We are thrilled to launch in golf with the most trusted voice in the game, Golf Digest. Throughout beta testing, weve seen one constant: Golfers who use Mustard get dramatically better at golf in a short period of time.\nGolf Digest has always strived to make golf more approachable and enjoyable for everyone, and we are thrilled to be working alongside Mustard and our top instructors to further that endeavor, said Chris Reynolds, General Manager of Golf Digest. We are operating in a world where golfers have nearly unlimited access to digital instruction, but more often than not the instruction they find is not actually relevant to them personally. Mustard Golf solves this challenge by providing new and experienced golfers alike with a simple-to-use but powerful platform that gives real-time, personalized expert analysis that will put them on the best path to playing better.\nI partnered with Mustard at the outset because I truly believe in their mission to give the everyday athlete, especially youth who are developing their skills, access to the best teaching available, said Rose. I am so excited to launch this golf product with Mark and Jason, who have helped me grow and advance as a player. For the first time, golfers all over the globe will have access to the same type of analysis and instruction as we do on the PGA TOUR.\nOne of the biggest challenges for golfers wanting to improve is that they dont know where to start. They feel overwhelmed and, in many cases, repeatedly instill bad habits, said Blackburn. With Mustard, we start by identifying a golfers strengths and weaknesses, then map out an actionable plan targeted at those areas of improvement. Its not hard to find what a good swing looks like. What makes Mustard unique is that it can tell you what your swing should look like and give you a plan to get you there.\nAbout Mustard\nMustard is revolutionizing the power of play by making the worlds best coaching accessible to all.
