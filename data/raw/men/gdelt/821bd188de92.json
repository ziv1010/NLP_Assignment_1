  "body_text": "A version of this article was originally published in September 2023\nErling Haaland is no longer the brightest young thing in Norwegian football.\nThat honour now belongs to 18-year-old Antonio Nusa and, week by week, more people are starting to know his name.\nNaturally so. Nusa is a two-footed wide forward with gliding pace and beguiling skill, who can drive with the ball or caress it around the tightest corners. You already pity the full-backs who have to face him.\nAdvertisement\nHe scored his first goal for Norway on his debut in a friendly against Jordan in September 2023 and, on his second appearance, in European Championship qualifying against Georgia five days later, created goals for Haaland and Martin Odegaard.\nThe second of those assists sent a shimmer of appreciation through the crowd in Oslo: Nusa squared up a pair of Georgian defenders, disappeared away from them with a blur of skill before cutting back for Odegaard to score. Rarely do stadiums make noises like that.\nBut Nusa is in that moment, at that stage of his career. His promise is overwhelming and yet unrefined and unrealised, meaning nobody can be sure what he might do next. The only certainty is that he’s appointment viewing.\nHe was signed by Belgium’s Club Bruges for €3million (£2.6m; $3.2m) in 2021 but was raised by Stabaek, the Eliteserien side from Baerum, just outside Oslo. He joined Stabaek when he was 13 and was initially limited in the number of training sessions he could attend. Nusa’s family lived in Langhus, to Oslo’s south, and the journey – an hour there and back by train and bus – was too much to undertake daily. Instead, he trained with Stabaek twice a week, spending the rest of his time at home, playing locally.\nGaute Larsen has worked in football for over 30 years. He coached Haaland at Bryne, the Manchester City striker’s first club, and he has been managing Stabaek’s second team since 2017. He remembers Nusa as a self-starter – a teenager “who was always studying YouTube, watching Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Neymar, and training by himself”.\nThat influence shows.\nNusa has unhelpfully been christened the Norwegian Neymar by the media, but – in terms of talent at least – the idea is not so outlandish. He has confidence on the ball and a habit of scoring stylish, spectacular goals. Within those moments, it is easy to spot the influence of that trio of players Larsen mentions above: the way he teases defenders, how he flows into the space, and the craft with which he constructs shooting angles.\nGO DEEPER\nBrobbey, Nusa, Moukoko and more: Picking 21 rising stars for the U21 Euros\nLarsen tells a story from a youth game when Stabaek Under-14s had travelled to face their Inter Milan counterparts in a youth tournament. Stabaek managed a 2-2 draw and were celebrating a fine result in the dressing room when they heard a knock on their door. It was Christian Chivu, the former Champions League winner who is now the head coach of Inter’s Primavera – their youth academy. He wanted to know who Stabaek’s No 10 was. When Nusa raised his hand, Chivu told him what a good player he was destined to become.\nAdvertisement\nAs Nusa got older and his balance, technique and acceleration were fortified by height and a developing upper body that allowed him to protect the ball, his progress through Stabaek’s system hastened. He was playing for their under-19s side when he was 15, in autumn 2020, and by the beginning of the following year, he was training with the first team full-time.\nThe Nusa family were still living in Langhus, so Larsen would drive the kid to and from training each day, 30km (nearly 20 miles) there and 30km back, six days a week.\nIt was more than worth it.\nHe made his debut for the first team as a 16-year-old substitute against Bodo/Glimt, punctuating the game with a goal of ludicrous quality. In his first senior start, away to Viking Stavanger, he scored twice more.\nThe original plan had been for him to stay in Norway for a further year.\nHe was still just 16 when Club Bruges made a €3million offer in the summer of 2021 and Nusa, his mother, father, and the coaching staff at Stabaek were all initially apprehensive about him moving to another country at such a young age.\nClub Bruges helped assuage those concerns. Their standing in European football and reputation for developing young players was a reassurance in itself.\nIn recent years, they have either raised or otherwise helped to develop AC Milan’s Charles De Ketelaere, Lois Openda of RB Leipzig and Bayer Leverkusen’s Odilon Kossounou, among others. Noa Lang was sold to PSV Eindhoven in the summer of 2023, too, and Tajon Buchanan, a Canada international, has recently earned a move to Inter. Club Bruges have proven that their environment is nurturing; they could also offer regular first-team football.\nGO DEEPER\nTottenham in talks with Club Bruges over Nusa deal\nThey actually have two professional teams. The senior side play in the Belgian top flight, but Club NXT – their under-23s – compete in the second division, meaning players not ready for the first team can still be exposed to competitive football against adults. Highly-rated Augsburg midfielder Arne Engels played for NXT before moving to the German club. Maxim De Cuyper, a Belgium Under-21 full-back, is another alumnus who has just broken into the Club Bruges first team.\nAdvertisement\nImportantly, both squads train together at Belfius Basecamp, the new €13million training base opened in 2019 which offers a quality and range of facilities many clubs outside Europe’s elite do not. Ensuring Nusa had the benefit of those surroundings as early as possible was important to Club Bruges and a reason why his departure from Stabaek was accelerated.\nSo far, the move has been a success.\nNusa made an initial breakthrough last season, playing over 700 minutes across the Pro League. He also had his first experience of Champions League football, scoring against Porto in the group stage, all before he had turned 18. This year, he has continued to be gradually eased into the first team, starting 12 games, making 14 further substitute appearances, scoring three goals and providing three assists.\nInevitably, the interest from higher on the game’s food chain is coming.\nIn fact, it has already arrived.\nOver the summer, Chelsea made an approach that was worth 10 times what Club Bruges had paid for Nusa just two years before. Arsenal and Liverpool have also been credited with having him on the radar, as well as Borussia Dortmund. And now Tottenham are in negotiations with Club Bruges, who are seeking €30million for Nusa and a guarantee he remains with them on loan for the remainder of this season as part of the deal. Nusa signed a new contract in April last year that runs until the summer of 2027.\nHe has yet to appear in too much of a rush to move on.\nThat level-headedness does not surprise Larsen. He speaks fondly of many of the players he has worked with, and remains in regular contact with Nusa. His early success and those first thrilling steps on the international stage have evidently meant a great deal to his old coach – and not just because of how brightly Nusa’s talent has flashed.\nAdvertisement\n“I’m very proud because I know how hard he has worked by himself,” Larsen tells The Athletic. “My philosophy has always been to develop players as humans and for them to play with respect, kindness and everything else.\n“When you see that kind of person succeed, it warms your heart.”\n(Top photo: Maja Hitij/UEFA via Getty Images)",
