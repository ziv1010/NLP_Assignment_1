It has been previously reported that the Dane is keen on staying at United and fighting for his place.\nEarlier today, The Peoples Person relayed a report claiming Milan are “stepping back from the race” to sign the Denmark international.\nIn recent days, Atalanta and Napoli have also been linked with the pacey striker.\nNapoli in the driving seat for Hojlund’s signature\nAccording to Gianluca Di Marzio, Napoli are now pushing to get a deal over the line for Hojlund.\nThe Serie A champions are in the market for a new emergency striker following an injury to Romelu Lukaku.\nNapoli have already held initial discussions with United, who are open to listening to offers for their £72m signing. He was absent from Amorim’s matchday squad for the clash against Arsenal in the Premier League opener as well.\nThe Naples outfit are “pushing hard” for a loan with an option to buy deal. Further, they are “confident” Hojlund will give his approval to their proposal, as they can offer him Champions League football.\nEarlier, Napoli explored the possibility of signing Joshua Zirkzee. However, United have no intention to sell the Dutchman, who is highly rated at Carrington.\nFeatured image Patrick McDermott via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
