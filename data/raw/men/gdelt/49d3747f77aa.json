Any club that posts losses in excess of that figure could face penalties, including large fines or even a points deduction.\nIf Chelsea qualify for Europe this season, then they will also have to meet Uefa's sustainability rules, which limit clubs' spending on wages, transfers and agents' fees to 70% of their revenue over a three-year period, with permitted losses of 60m euros (£51.6m).\nThe new rules replaced Uefa's Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations in June 2022 and clubs will have three years to implement them.\nUefa has a wide-ranging list of potential punishments for clubs which break these rules, including warnings, fines, removal from competitions or even the loss of European titles.\nJuventus were kicked out of this season's Europa Conference League for breaching FFP rules between 2012 and 2019, while Chelsea were fined £8.57m for breaches that took place during previous owner Roman Abramovich's time at the club. Manchester United were also fined 300,000 euros (£257,000) by Uefa for a \"minor\" breach of its rules in July.\nHow are Chelsea trying to avoid breaking the rules?\nHeard of the term 'amortisation'? The transfer of Mykhailo Mudryk is often used as the example to explain that.\nChelsea have signed many of their players under the Boehly era on long contracts, with Mudryk's £89m fee spread across an eight-and-a-half-year contract, meaning he only costs about £10m a year on the club's annual accounts.\nWhile Uefa tightened its rules this summer to limit spreading a transfer fee across a maximum five years, Chelsea are not in Europe this season, so don't have to worry about it yet. The Premier League does not yet have the same limits.\nWhen a team sell a player, all of the profits go on to the accounts straight away.\nTo use another example, Kai Havertz cost Chelsea £71m in 2020, which equates to £14m a year over his five-year contract. But when he was sold to Arsenal this summer for about £65m he had about £28.4m of value left on the books for the final two years of his contract, meaning the Blues could bank about 36.6m of 'profit'.\nWhen you sell an academy graduate, the entire amount can go on the books as they did not cost a fee. So when Chelsea sold Mason Mount to Manchester United for £55m this summer, that entire amount goes down as pure profit in the accounts.\nWill it work?\nClubs' accounts are published almost a year after the relevant deals take place, meaning up to date figures are an estimation. But we do know that last year's accounts saw Chelsea post a £121m loss for season 2021-22, before Boehly took over. The season before that was a £156m loss.\nChelsea will need to keep raising funds, either through player sales, increased commercial deals or prize money, to keep balancing the books over the length of their new signings' long contracts.\n\"I can see how they are doing it in terms of accountancy, I don't see how they are doing it in terms of cash flow,\" journalist Rory Smith told BBC Radio 5's Monday Night Club.\n\"They have found this ingenious loophole by offering players long-term contracts. That's a brilliant accounting trick. But that is not how they pay the clubs.\n\"They are not paying Brighton in nine instalments for Moises Caicedo, they will probably pay them in three, maybe two.\n\"That's real money and my guess is there is some sort of loan facility that they have access to. That is not a great way to run things long term.\"\nThere is also the risk of tying players down to long-term deals who may sustain serious injury or loss of form, but will prove hard to sell because they still have several years left on their contracts.\nThe return of European football, particularly the more lucrative Champions League, is also likely to be important to Chelsea's strategy - as is lowering their wage structure.\n\"Chelsea as of this moment think they are compliant with the financial regulations that are placed on them,\" said BBC Sport football reporter Alex Howell.\n\"When the new owners took over it is believed that there was a 'Chelsea wage' where players' salaries were inflated and that was something the new owners were looking to tackle.\n\"A lot of the new signings are younger players and it can be assumed that their wages are lower than the experienced players who have left the club.\n\"They have sold academy players such as Mason Mount and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, and that is a significant way to balance the books. There's also been interest in Conor Gallagher, another academy graduate, so if he was to be sold that would also greatly help Chelsea stay within the stipulated rules.\"\nOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment",
