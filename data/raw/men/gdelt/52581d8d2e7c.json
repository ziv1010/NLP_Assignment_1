  "body_text": "Legendary Chelsea goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger has left the club today, officially completing her transfer to NY/NJ Gotham FC in the USA’s National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL).\nOfficial: NY/NJ Gotham FC sign Ann-Katrin Berger from Chelsea FCW\nFarewell, legend!\nGotham FC are the current defending champions, triumphing in the playoffs are finishing 6th during the regular season. (The 2024 NWSL season started last month.) Berger, who has signed a one-year deal with an option for a second, is the second ex-Chelsea player to join at the club this season, after our one-time forward/wing-back Crystal Dunn.\nThe 33-year-old Berger will be expected to compete for the starting position with fellow new signing Cassie Miller and former first-choice Abby Smith who is coming back from nearly a year out injured.\nDuring her time at Chelsea, Berger won just about everything humanly possible, except for the Champions League title, which continues to elude us. She joined Chelsea in 2019, and we’ve won the league every year since, adding three FA Cups, two League Cups, and that one solitary UWCL final in 2021 — routinely winning the PFA’s best goalkeeper award during that time.\nIn recent years, injuries and a major health scare had reduced her playing time, and the next generation had taken over in the meantime.\n“An amazing servant, I’ll always say, I’ve never seen a goalkeeper save penalties like Ann, the best in the world. Some of the difficulties she’s had to endure and go through, her own personal health ... She has legendary status at Chelsea.\n“But this is football. She wants to play, she wants to go to the Olympics and I admire that about players, and I know she’ll go with our blessing and we wish her the best of luck.”\n-Emma Hayes; source: ESPN\nWe wish AKB nothing but the best of luck in New York New Jersey.",
