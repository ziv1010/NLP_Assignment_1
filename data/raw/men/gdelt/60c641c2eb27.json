I hardly saw him have a good game with Chelsea. He never went past players, very hot and cold.\n‘But since he’s been at Arsenal, he’s been a revelation, he’s been absolutely unbelievable. Arsenal play a lot quicker, they get the ball out to the wingers and they can go and have a go.\n‘1v1, I think he’s one of the best about, he’s one of the best wingers. If you give him the ball 1v1, he doesn’t mess about. He’s not fussed about doing tricks. He’s very direct, runs at real pace and when you’re a defender you do not want people running with you at pace.\n‘He very rarely stops the ball, he gets the ball and he goes bang that way, like Mo Salah did, and people can’t tackle you when you’re doing that. He’s been absolutely outstanding. I got it horribly wrong!’\nWhile he is yet to register a goal contribution in the Premier League, Madueke has found the back of the net three times in the Champions League, firing Arsenal to the top of the league phase table.\nWhen everyone is fit, Madueke is behind Saka in the pecking order, but Merson believes the threat of both wingers in the squad significantly aids Arsenal’s chances of winning silverware.\nAsked how a defender would react if he saw Madueke coming off the bench for Saka, Merson replied: ‘There’s nothing worse!\nMore Trending\n‘When you see someone’s number come up you think, “I’ve got rid of him”. And then all of a sudden someone else comes on who’s just very similar and fresh.\n‘That’s what they needed. The next part of the season with the Champions League and the Premier League gets harder.\n‘To swap players like-for-like, it’s very rare you can get that. Usually you bring a top quality player off, you’re really weakening the team. But you’re not at the moment. The way he’s playing is perfect on that side.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Jack Grealish and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall injury update ahead of Everton vs Arsenal\nMORE: Alan Shearer’s Premier League predictions including Arsenal, Man Utd and Tottenham vs Liverpool\nMORE: Sol Campbell backs struggling Arsenal star to become ‘great’ ahead of Everton clash",
