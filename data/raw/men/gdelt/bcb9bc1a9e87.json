It was nice. I tried to contribute for the team by doing my job and we won again.”\nDespite a first defeat in 10 games away to Aston Villa last weekend, Pep Guardiola remained confident his side can pose a threat to Arsenal come May.\nThere were more encouraging signs for Guardiola as Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden shone in creative roles, while Nico O’Riley became the first City player other than Haaland to score in the Premier League for over a month.\n“Bournemouth are one of the most demanding teams that we have faced,” said Guardiola. “We found our rhythm and today we were better in many aspects.”\nBuoyed by their unbeaten streak since losing at Liverpool on the opening night of the season, Bournemouth started brightly.\nHowever, their brave high line was exposed on 17 minutes when Cherki’s header allowed Haaland to gallop clear from inside his own half to slam past Djordje Petrovic.\nThe visitors levelled eight minutes later when Gianluigi Donnarumma claimed he was impeded as the Italian tried to collect a corner and Tyler Adams thrashed home the loose ball.\nBut Haaland restored City’s advantage before half-time by racing onto another Cherki pass in behind the Bournemouth defence to round Petrovic and slot home his 26th goal for club and country this season.\nThe 25-year-old also became only the third player to ever score multiple goals in four consecutive Premier League home games after Luis Suarez and Robbie Fowler.\nGuardiola has called for greater contributions from his other attacking players to lessen the goalscoring burden on his prolific number nine.\nStill no City player other than Haaland has scored more than once in the league this season, but O’Riley chipped in from full-back to seal the three points.\nFoden was the creator this time as O’Riley strode forward before arrowing a low shot into the far corner.\nHaaland was denied the chance of a hat-trick as he was replaced by Omar Marmoush eight minutes from time with one eye on facing his former club Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Wednesday.\n“You need to ask Pep for this,” added Haaland. “I think there are probably a few fantasy (football) managers that were not so happy when I got subbed off!”\nA double was enough to keep City still within range despite Arsenal’s rampant run of nine consecutive wins and seven straight clean sheets in all competitions.\nNuno celebrates first win as West Ham boss\nNuno Espirito Santo celebrated his first win as West Ham manager on Sunday as his spirited team battled from behind to beat Newcastle 3-1 at the London Stadium.\nThe Hammers remain in the relegation zone after just their second Premier League win of the season but are now just three points behind 17th-placed Burnley, whom they play next week.\nEddie Howe’s Newcastle took the lead courtesy of a fine early strike from Jacob Murphy but Lucas Paqueta levelled and an own goal from the unfortunate Sven Botman gave the home team the advantage at half-time.\nThe visitors made wholesale changes in the second half but were blunt in attack and Tomas Soucek made sure of all three points for West Ham in the closing moments.\nNuno was appointed West Ham boss in late September, just over two weeks after he was sacked by Nottingham Forest, who are also in the drop zone.\nThe Portuguese, who has had to be patient in waiting for his first win, said it was “terrific to hear the noise at the London Stadium”.\n“The players are realising that winning in the Premier League, we have to work very hard,” he told the BBC. “We will do it again. The win makes it easier, there are smiles and the legs feel easier.\n“We see slight improvements on the pitch. We have to create a platform on the pitch.”\nTurnaround\nMurphy put Newcastle ahead in the fourth minute, fizzing a shot from the edge of the area just 26 seconds after Jarrod Bowen’s effort clattered off the post at the other end.\nReferee Robert Jones awarded West Ham a penalty six minutes later, ruling that Bowen had been brought down by Malick Thiaw, but the decision was overturned after a VAR review as Thiaw had touched the ball.\nThe Hammers were deservedly level in the 35th minute when Paqueta hammered a sweet strike from outside the box past the sprawling Nick Pope.\nAnd moments before half-time they were in front when a low cross from defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka was sliced into his own net by Botman, whose attempted interception left Pope stranded.\nHowe brought on Fabian Schar, William Osula and Jacob Ramsey for Emil Krafth, Nick Woltemade and Anthony Gordon at half-time, later making further changes.\nThe visitors dominated possession but Pope was called into action twice in quick succession at the other end as West Ham threatened a third goal.\nHammers midfielder Freddie Potts had the ball in the net with just over 20 minutes remaining but the goal was ruled out for off-side.\nNewcastle continued to probe but could not find an equaliser and Soucek had the last laugh, poking home deep into stoppage time.\nIt is West Ham’s first win at home in the Premier League since February while defeat leaves Newcastle 13th the table and still searching for their first league win of the season away from home.\n“It wasn’t a great day for us,” said Howe. “The away form is something that will be talked about and discussed and is of course something that concerns us.”\nIn an age of information overload, Sunrise is The Namibian’s morning briefing, delivered at 6h00 from Monday to Friday.
