An injury-time free kick from Lionel Messi to seal a 4-3 victory for Paris Saint-Germain against Lille? Victor Osimhen still on track to become the first-ever African player to win Serie A’s Paolo Rossi Award for scoring the most goals?\nIt was a crazy weekend and that requires a deeper dive into the data…\nOsimhen scores again\nNapoli are cantering to the Serie A title and Osimhen is leading them there. The 24-year-old netted his 18th goal of the season at Sassuolo on Friday, where Napoli won 2-0 to record a seventh consecutive victory in the league.\nAdvertisement\nThis also extends Osimhen’s scoring streak to seven consecutive games, the longest by a Napoli player in Serie A since it changed to three points per win in 1994-95.\nLast month, head coach Luciano Spalletti said he was “stunned by the potential” Osimhen has. The Nigerian international is five goals clear of Inter’s Lautaro Martinez (13) in the race for the Golden Boot.\nHe does not take Napoli’s penalties but still leads Serie A for expected goals (12.5) and is second to only Martinez (83) for shots (80).\nWatch Osimhen and he offers considerably more than goals, though. The No 9 played one-versus-two against Sassuolo’s centre-backs but won the battle on the floor and in the air.\nHe ran in behind the back four to receive passes against a compact Sassuolo mid-block — including for his goal, which he finished from an incredibly-narrow angle — and was a key outlet for Napoli’s defence to play long into and access the wingers through. He received eight progressive passes, the second-most of any Napoli player during the match.\nIt’s no wonder a lot of clubs across the continent have Osimhen on their radar.\nTurns out Sommer wasn’t the jinx after all…\nIf you can’t beat them, buy them. That’s what Bayern Munich tried to do with Yann Sommer this weekend.\nBarely six months after the Swiss shot-stopper made a scarcely believable 19 saves for Borussia Monchengladbach in a 1-1 draw against the German champions, Sommer was lining up in the opposing goal. His eighth appearance for Bayern on Saturday, coming against the club for which he made 331 appearances across a nine-year spell.\nThe 34-year-old’s return to Borussia-Park did not go to plan however, as Julian Nagelsmann’s side lost for the first time since September, surrendering their one-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga table in a 3-2 defeat, as both Borussia Dortmund and Union Berlin joined the 32-time champions on 43 points.\nAdvertisement\nThis was the latest incredible chapter of Bayern’s rotten run against Gladbach. They have now taken 100 shots against the Foals in five winless games against them. In that time, they have lost 5-0, been denied by an unbeatable Sommer and generated more than 10.0 on the expected goals (xG) scale, only managing to score half that suggested amount.\n6 – Since 2017-18 Borussia Mönchengladbach have won six #Bundesliga matches against Bayern München – more than they have won against any other side in that period. In the same period, Bayern have not lost more than three times to any other side in the league. Nemesis. #BMGFCB pic.twitter.com/JuUoqIZMeY\n— OptaFranz (@OptaFranz) February 18, 2023\nNot just a bogey team, but bogey players too: Jonas Hofmann and Lars Stindl found themselves on the scoresheet once more against Bayern, the former now with four goals and eight assists in 18 appearances against Germany’s juggernaut.\nFor now, Gladbach continue to be one of the Bundesliga’s most mystifying sides. Having beaten Bayern, Dortmund and RB Leipzig this campaign, they have also lost 4-1 to strugglers Hertha Berlin and 5-1 to Werder Bremen, picking up five points from five games against the bottom three.\nIt really is no use trying to predict Daniel Farke’s side or the Bundesliga title race this season. Oh, and there’s just the small matter of Bayern vs Union on Sunday.\nAlisson’s saves are crucial to Liverpool’s season\nFour minutes into Liverpool’s away game against Newcastle United, Jurgen Klopp’s side needed their Brazilian goalkeeper yet again. Alisson’s positioning and quick reaction in his penalty area allowed him to stop Miguel Almiron from opening the scoring. Further saves to keep out Allan Saint-Maximin and Callum Wilson earned Alisson a well-deserved clean sheet and praise from his manager.\nAdvertisement\nEven against 10 men, Alisson was one of Liverpool’s best players and has been their top performer this season. Added to that, he has been the Premier League’s best shot-stopper in 2022-23 with 9.8 goals prevented, which is the difference between the number of goals a goalkeeper lets in against the number they were expected to concede.\nDuring a turbulent season in which injuries and poor form have severely hampered Klopp’s squad, the Brazilian has been one of the club’s few consistent players. His saves on Saturday halted Newcastle from getting back into the game, as was the case against Tottenham Hotspur on November 6. Alisson also showed his worth in narrow wins at home to Manchester City and West Ham United.\nEurope’s dead-ball specialists deliver key goals\nEurope’s very best were at it this week — no, not the Champions League, but Messi and James Ward-Prowse scoring match-winning goals from free kicks.\nSince the Southampton midfielder took his first Premier League free-kick in November 2013, he (17) and Messi (31) have scored more free-kick goals than anyone else in Europe’s top-five leagues. Though the Argentinian has netted considerably more, it is the Englishman who boasts a better conversion rate (15.2 per cent vs 9.3 per cent).\nJames Ward-Prowse had his first ever shot from a direct free kick in the Premier League on 2nd November 2013.\nSince then, here's the most prolific players from free-kicks across the top five European leagues & their conversion rate. pic.twitter.com/NU9G5vqHLB\n— Opta Analyst (@OptaAnalyst) February 19, 2023\nMessi’s injury-time curler added two crucial points for Paris Saint-Germain at home to Lille, his fifth match-winning goal in Ligue 1 this season. Only teammate Kylian Mbappe has more (six).\nMeanwhile, Ward-Prowse’s trademark free-kick — within 24 yards of goal, slightly off to the left and dipping over the wall to the goalkeeper’s right (left on the graphic below) — gave Southampton a huge win at Chelsea.\n“There is no better (free-kick) taker,” said Pep Guardiola when asked about Ward-Prowse last January. The record books are close to reflecting this sentiment, with the 28-year-old now just one goal away from David Beckham’s Premier League record (18).\nAdvertisement\nChelsea lose (and don’t score) again\nHead coach Graham Potter may think he is “not the problem” but he and his staff need to find solutions to Chelsea’s goalscoring issues — and fast.\nTheir 23 Premier League goals are bettered by 12 teams and Saturday’s loss at home to Southampton was their fifth defeat across all competitions in 2023. They have won once in 10 fixtures this calendar year and scored just four times from shots worth 13.1 expected goals. Potter’s side has failed to find the net in five games, the most of any Premier League side.\nGO DEEPER\nThe arguments for and against Graham Potter's 38% Chelsea win rate\nThose four goals have all been scored by different players: Kai Havertz, Kalidou Koulibaly, Joao Felix and Raheem Sterling. Havertz and Joao Felix look to be forming a promising partnership, making runs and combining particularly effectively to create chances and space for each other in the draw at West Ham and the Champions League defeat away to Borussia Dortmund.\nYet on Saturday, Potter gave a Premier League debut to 20-year-old David Datro Fofana, signed in January from Norwegian side Molde, only to replace him with Raheem Sterling at half-time. The search for a productive blend continues.\nWho plays in goal for Newcastle at Wembley?\nAside from the tactical game plan, Eddie Howe’s pre-match team talk against Liverpool would likely have stressed the necessity of avoiding injuries and suspensions ahead of this weekend’s Carabao Cup final.\nNick Pope didn’t take that on board and is now suspended for the final. The goalkeeper was sent off after 22 minutes for a handball well outside of his penalty area, attempting to sweep up an Allison drop-kick.\nThese situations have been a staple for Pope. In fact, his 52 sweeper-keeping actions — defined by FBref as defensive actions outside the penalty area — are the most of any Premier League goalkeeper and second-most in Europe’s top five leagues (after Bochum’s Manuel Riemann, 84) this season.\nAdvertisement\nThe England international has been an ever-present in the Premier League’s best defence, with Newcastle conceding just 15 times (including one penalty) in 23 games and keeping 12 clean sheets. En route to the final, Pope kept four clean sheets and conceded just once in five appearances.\nPope’s absence is further complicated by backup goalkeeper Martin Dubravka being cup-tied having played for Manchester United in the same competition.\nThis leaves Loris Karius, who has not played competitively since February 2021 and made errors in Liverpool’s 2018 Champions League loss to Real Madrid, and Mark Gillespie, who played for Newcastle in this competition in 2020, in contention to start.\nManchester United go Brrrrrr\nAfter a first half where United were “rubbish” in Erik ten Hag’s words, they switched on the ignition in the second half and stormed past Leicester City, scoring twice through Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho. United’s threat on offensive transitions was on show at the Camp Nou last Thursday, when the speed of their attacks got the better of Barcelona’s defence, and the goals against Leicester cemented their place as the Premier League’s transition kings.\nUnited’s speed and directness once they win the ball back slice through the opponents’ lines. In terms of direct attacks — which is defined as a possession that starts in a team’s defensive half and results in a shot or touch inside the opposition penalty area within 15 seconds — Ten Hag’s side top the Premier League with 89 direct attacks this season.\nThe main beneficiary of this has been Rashford. He has scored 24 goals in all competitions for United, his most in a single campaign. Sixteen of the 24 have come after the World Cup — in only 17 games.\nWhen United win the ball back and there’s space to attack, there’s no better side in world football right now.",
