We didn’t understand it.”\nLiverpool’s deal to bring in Mohamed Salah from Roma for an initial fee of £37million ($48m at current rates) in the summer of 2017 was pivotal in the club’s pursuit of glory and it came with a ringing endorsement from the ground-breaking data department Graham had assembled as Liverpool’s first director of research.\nAdvertisement\nThe Welshman, who has a PhD in biological physics from the University of Cambridge, lived his dream as he spent 11 years working for the club he grew up supporting before leaving in 2023 to launch a sports advisory business, Ludonautics.\nLiverpool’s data-led approach to recruitment helped sporting director Michael Edwards and manager Jurgen Klopp build a team that went on to be crowned Champions League, Premier League and Club World Cup winners.\nTo mark the release of his new book How to Win the Premier League, Graham sat down for a wide-ranging interview with The Athletic. He revealed:\n- What went wrong with transfers under Brendan Rodgers and the power struggle behind the scenes\n- Why Liverpool’s success in the market rocketed under Klopp\n- Why he is most proud of the deals for Joel Matip and Andy Robertson\n- The data warning that came with signing Darwin Nunez in 2022\n- “Passionate arguments” and his reasons for quitting Liverpool.\nGraham was working for data company Decision Technology, which had a contract with Tottenham Hotspur, when Liverpool headhunted him in April 2012.\n“I’d always been a Liverpool fan, but the real reason I joined the club was Fenway Sports Group and John W Henry,” he says. “They had proved at the Boston Red Sox that they took data analysis seriously. They promised to do the same at Liverpool.\n“The owner I directly reported to completely bought into the idea. I also had Michael Edwards, who I had worked with for two years at Spurs, and I knew he also bought into it.”\nThe summer of 2012 was turbulent at Liverpool, with Rodgers taking over from Kenny Dalglish after a disappointing eighth-placed finish.\nRodgers’ refusal to work with a sporting director meant that a transfer committee was formed compromising of the manager, CEO Ian Ayre, Edwards (then technical director), head of recruitment Dave Fallows and chief scout Barry Hunter.\nGraham was an “unofficial member”, with data fed into the decision-making process, but there was friction when he opposed Rodgers’ plans to sign Joe Allen and Gylfi Sigurdsson, two players the Northern Irishman had managed at Swansea City. Rodgers got his way with Allen and striker Fabio Borini when other members of the committee felt that Chelsea’s Daniel Sturridge was a better option. Sturridge was signed six months later.\n“The typical experience of a data person going into a club back in the early 2010s was you come in with some bright ideas straight out of university and some old football guys think, ‘This is all rubbish; we’re not going to listen to this stuff’,” says Graham.\nAdvertisement\n“There was resistance — and there was certainly resistance from Brendan. Tough as that was, I knew it was a much better position to be in than at most clubs because I had buy-in from the owners and from Michael who was my direct manager.”\nGraham’s “biggest regret” when it comes to not landing a player was Diego Costa. After prolonged discussions internally, Liverpool did belatedly try to trigger his €25million (£21m; $28m at current rates) release clause in August 2013, but he opted to sign a new contract at Atletico Madrid.\n“Can you imagine a Liverpool front line of Luis Suarez and Diego Costa?” laughs Graham. “It would have been filthy! As it was, Costa ended up joining Chelsea the following year.”\nLiverpool made a hash of replacing Suarez when he left for Barcelona in 2014. Graham says differences of opinion meant the club didn’t move quickly enough to land their first-choice target of Alexis Sanchez, who joined Arsenal instead. The data suggested Red Bull Salzburg’s Sadio Mane as a cheaper alternative to Rodgers’ pick of Southampton’s Adam Lallana.\nSurprisingly, Graham’s department were supportive of the decision to buy AC Milan’s Mario Balotelli, who played just 28 times and scored four goals.\nIt was a dysfunctional period. Rodgers had wanted Ashley Williams and Ryan Bertrand but ended up with Mamadou Sakho and Alberto Moreno.\n“In the first few years of the transfer committee, those failed signings, most of them were because the players we wanted to bring in Brendan vetoed,” Graham says. “And the ones Brendan wanted to bring in we vetoed. So at times we ended up with fifth- or sixth-choice players. We just weren’t getting our top targets.”\nGraham claims he “begged” the owners not to sign Aston Villa’s Christian Benteke in the summer of 2015 as he felt he was a poor fit for Liverpool’s style, but signing the Belgian striker was an “obsession” for Rodgers and FSG paid the £32.5million release clause.\nAdvertisement\nThe compromise was that Rodgers would also accept the signing of Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim for £29million. Edwards was adamant that the Brazilian was undervalued and the data showcased his all-round contribution — despite a modest goal return in Germany. Firmino went on to score 111 goals in 362 games for Liverpool, while Benteke was off-loaded after just one season having netted 10 times in 42 appearances.\nSo what changed when Klopp replaced Rodgers in October 2015?\n“The difference was Jurgen’s open-mindedness,” Graham says. “The data gradually became more sophisticated and the models improved, but there wasn’t a step-change in the quality of our analysis when Brendan left and Jurgen arrived. It was the same processes and the same people.\n“Jurgen saw players in the same way as Michael Edwards, whereas Brendan didn’t.\n“Jurgen didn’t have any experience of data analysis in football before he came to Liverpool. We were asked questions occasionally by Jurgen and the coaching staff, but it wasn’t part of our weekly work to sit down and go through next week’s tactics or last week’s performance with Jurgen. All our work was pushed through the video analysis department or the psychologist or the recruitment department.\n“The difference was it was accepted that this is one of the ways Liverpool works. Jurgen believed in experts and that they can make a difference. He knew that data informed our recruitment process and the feedback he got after games from our video analysis department and he was receptive to that.”\nThe recruitment process was much smoother in the summer of 2016 when Joel Matip, Mane and Georginio Wijnaldum were brought on board.\n“When Jurgen said, ‘We should think about signing Matip on a free transfer’, I had to pinch myself to check I was awake,” Graham adds. “For years we had viewed him as the best young centre-back in the Bundesliga. Michael went to see him after doing the deal and Bayern Munich’s scouts were there too. Matip slipped over on the halfway line and Schalke conceded a goal. Bayern’s scouts were like, ‘Ah, we knew he was rubbish’. But what a free signing he proved to be.\nAdvertisement\n“Jurgen also really liked Mane, who we had suggested previously. In those first two seasons in particular, Jurgen was suggesting players I would have been suggesting to him. What he saw in a player was the same as what we saw in a player. We didn’t have to fight.”\nLuck also played a part. Klopp turned his attention to Mane after initially targeting Mario Gotze, who was reluctant to move to Anfield. The following summer he wanted Julian Brandt before coming around to the idea that Salah was the best wide forward available on the market.\nThe Egyptian had been branded a Premier League flop after his unsuccessful stint at Chelsea, but Liverpool’s scouting reports and data analysis of his performances in Italy, first for Fiorentina and then Roma, were glowing.\nGraham says: “All our analysis is focused on, ‘How are you increasing our chances of scoring a goal or decreasing our chances of conceding a goal?’. Some forwards are quite one-dimensional and only add value through shooting. You can measure that through xG (expected goals).\n“But Mo is a multi-functional forward. He can run with the ball, he can pass and create, as well as shoot. Our ‘Possession Value’ model attempted to put a value on each of those passes, runs and shots. It showed he added real value in those three ways and was very difficult to defend against.\n“From a complicated data point of view, he ticked all the boxes. He came out as the best wide forward in Europe aged 24 or under. Mo came with the baggage of having failed in the Premier League, but our data analysis helped us to understand that we could ignore that.\n“Michael, Dave and Barry convinced Jurgen to go for Mo and he was gracious enough to speak publicly about the part they played in that. Jurgen would say, ‘OK, I like this guy, but I haven’t watched hundreds of games like the scouts have and I haven’t done the analysis like the data department have, so I’m going to have an open mind and take a serious look’.\nAdvertisement\n“Signing Mo because he had failed at Chelsea was doing something different, but we didn’t care about looking stupid. That was the difference between us and a lot of clubs at that time. We just cared about making the right decision and we believed in the process. It was similar with Firmino and Mane, who came from mid-table clubs. They were the three stars. Everyone at the club was really excited we could get them. We didn’t care that the rest of the world didn’t feel that way.”\nGraham regards Salah as the “boring answer” when the conversation turns to which transfer he’s most proud of. The same summer as the Egyptian arrived at Anfield, Liverpool signed left-back Robertson from relegated Hull City for an initial fee of £8million.\n“With Mo, we all believed he was world class,” he explains. “But the ones that mean a lot to me are Matip and Robertson. They weren’t sure-fire successes like we thought Mo would be. The promise with data analysis is we can find a player who has been overlooked for different reasons elsewhere. I like those two because there were some disagreements internally and some doubts about them.\n“Robertson had been part of the worst defensive team in the league. We recommended him as a really good attacking full-back, but we weren’t certain about his qualities as a defender. Jurgen solved that by saying he wanted his full-backs to attack and if there were defensive weaknesses we could solve that elsewhere with cover from midfield positions.”\nThere was a clear strategy, but also some good fortune. Liverpool would have targeted Roma’s Emerson Palmieri rather than Robertson in 2017 if the Brazilian left-back hadn’t torn his anterior cruciate ligament.\nGraham also cites the collapse of a deal for Blackpool’s Tom Ince in January 2013, which led to Liverpool signing Philippe Coutinho from Inter Milan for £8.5million.\nIf Paris Saint-Germain hadn’t bought Neymar, then Barcelona wouldn’t have been so desperate when they agreed to pay Liverpool £142m for Coutinho in January 2018. That money effectively paid for the transformative signings of Virgil van Dijk and Alisson.\nAdvertisement\nAs Liverpool ended their 30-year wait for the top-flight crown in 2020, Graham viewed it as vindication for the club’s approach to recruitment.\n“Mike Gordon, Michael Edwards, myself and the rest of the transfer committee always had the belief the process would pay off if we could get all the parts working properly,” Graham says. “Our personalities were similar in not caring about the outside noise and sticking to a long-term view. The first guy I ever hired to my team, I told him ‘I’m not going to say this is a job for life; if we’re still here after two years we’re doing well’. I think at most clubs with those failures in the first few years, they would have gone in another direction.\n“But Fenway knew the process was working. They could see that a department was being created which would give us an edge over other clubs in the future. It was just that the rest of the world couldn’t see it at that time.”\nGO DEEPER\nHow Liverpool are using artificial intelligence to become better at corners\nThe signing of Darwin Nunez from Benfica for an initial fee of £64million in June 2022 was largely driven by Klopp after the Uruguayan’s impressive performances against Liverpool in the Champions League.\nAs Klopp’s power and influence increased, did the club move away from their data-led model?\n“Nunez played brilliantly against Liverpool and that has an effect on people,” Graham says. “It didn’t do him any harm in becoming a Liverpool player.\n“The difficulty with Nunez was that he was a very different type of player to Firmino. My questions were: ‘Are we going to change our style or formation for him?’ Is he a good enough player that it might be worth making those changes?’. It was something we had resisted for many years.\n“We went through the same data process for Nunez as with other players. I wanted to make sure that everyone knew what a big change it would be with Nunez. It was more, ‘Are we sure we’re going to make the best use of him?’.\nAdvertisement\n“I talk in the book about classifying players to understand what their role is. It’s different to whether they are any good or not. We always had a list of ‘great players but not for Liverpool’. Defensive full-backs, target men, crossing wingers — we just didn’t play in that style. It was clear that Nunez was a No 9.\n“I wouldn’t say that the data said no to Nunez. It’s more ‘if we sign this player we have to understand this is the role we’ve seen him be effective in and is there currently a slot for him in our squad?’. And if you’re spending a large amount of money on a player then he has to start. The worst thing you can do is buy a squad player and spend money that could be out there on the pitch.”\nGO DEEPER\nMichael Edwards - the football visionary FSG simply cannot live without\nEdwards left Liverpool in the summer of 2022 and his successor, Julian Ward, stepped down the following year — when Graham also decided to pursue a new challenge, with Will Spearman taking over as the club’s new director of research.\nHad Klopp become more difficult to work with?\n“I can’t speak for Michael or Julian, but I was overdue a change,” he says. “I’m not going to pretend that everything was always harmony and light at Liverpool. We had arguments, of course there were big egos and I include myself in that.\n“It’s difficult to keep the momentum going for 11 years when you’re having passionate arguments. Sooner or later you get burnt out. We all want the club to succeed but we have got different ideas.\n“I thought I could continue longer than Michael, but after nine months or so I thought, ‘I can see now what Michael was saying when he said it was time for a rest’. It was always great fun working with Michael — demanding but entertaining.\n“After 11 years in my dream job, I’d achieved what I wanted to achieve, having a tangible impact on the success of one of the biggest clubs in the world. We were the first in-house data department in the Premier League and I built it up from just me to a department of eight really good people. It was the right thing to pass the baton on and give others some career progression.”\nAdvertisement\nLast year Graham launched his own analytics business, Ludonautics. He currently works with six clubs across Europe and Latin America, advising them on recruitment and data.\nHe had Edwards on board as a consultant before the club’s former sporting director stepped down earlier this year after being appointed as FSG’s new CEO of football.\n“It was great fun working together in a start-up environment,” Graham says. “I kept saying to him ‘You’re going to go back aren’t you? Surely Chelsea have called you’. He was like, ‘Yeah, I might have spoken to Chelsea’. I was like, ‘Surely Manchester United have spoken to you too?’. But he was adamant he wouldn’t be a director of football again.\n“Running recruitment, as well as all the other departments at the training ground, is really stressful. He went back to Liverpool because they offered him something new and exciting. Overseeing day-to-day control of the club gives him opportunities he didn’t have as sporting director, so I can see the attraction.”\nThe club’s owners trusted Edwards to build a new structure at Liverpool this summer with Richard Hughes as sporting director and Arne Slot as head coach rather than manager. Data is as important as ever in the decision-making process.\n“It comes back to John Henry, Mike Gordon and Tom Werner seeing football in the same way Michael does,” Graham adds. “They demand high standards and Michael has proved over an extended period previously that he lives up to them.\n“It’s about diligence. They want no stone left unturned. Do we have everything we need to know about a player or an upcoming opponent? There’s a plan and a systematic way of doing things. That’s the way Fenway work so there’s a very natural fit between them and Michael.”\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
