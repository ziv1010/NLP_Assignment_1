They play Manchester City in the Champions League semi-final first leg in two weeks.\nCastellanos is the first player in over 75 years to score four goals in a La Liga game against Real Madrid. In December 1947, Esteban Echaverria netted five for Real Oviedo against Madrid.\nUncapped Argentine Castellanos had played club football in Chile, Uruguay and the United States before joining Girona on a season-long loan last summer - netting seven La Liga goals before this.\nCastellanos only touched the ball 15 times, with as many goals as passes attempted, before being replaced in the 71st minute.\nReal were without first-choice goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois through gastroenteritis and striker Karim Benzema with a leg injury.\nLatest Stories\n-\nThe Accra Mandate: Securing Africa’s AI Future through Local Data and Ethical Governance\n28 minutes -\nAquafresh donates to National Chief Imam ahead of Ramadan\n53 minutes -\nAdopt a mix of bond and short-term finance to address financing challenges in cocoa industry – Professor Peprah to government\n55 minutes -\nNSA introduces dual authentication system for 2025/26 enrolment exercise\n2 hours -\nFuel prices to increase from Feb. 16, influenced by cedi’s depreciation\n2 hours -\nGNFS to launch automated fire safety compliance system to modernise regulation\n3 hours -\nNALAG president commends Local Gov’t Minister for payment of assembly members’ allowances\n3 hours -\nIs having a physical security operations center in your business worth it?\n3 hours -\nAsiedu Nketia recounts fierce political wars in Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam constituency\n3 hours -\nNRSA sets up committee to probe road crashes involving Toyota Voxy\n3 hours -\nCocoa farmers decry the adverse impact of producer price cut on livelihoods\n3 hours -\nFamilies who lose relatives to ‘no bed syndrome’ must sue health facilities – Dr. Nawaane\n3 hours -\nGhana Sports Fund: Dr. David Kofi Wuaku outlines vision for Youth Empowerment growth through sports\n3 hours -\nNUGS President urges sustainable digital governance\n4 hours -\nNational Investment Bank kicks off Ghana Sports Fund with landmark seed donation\n4 hours",
