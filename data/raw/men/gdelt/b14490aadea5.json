  "body_text": "Overview:\nAfrican Stars' head coach Bob Mafoso hinted of maintaining their identity of possessive display as they hold onto the ball to make the breakthrough.\nWhen the reigning Namibian football champions African Stars hosted Vipers at the Athlone stadium in Cape Town city – South Africa, surely the former were disadvantaged in a way or another.\nAfrican Stars could not manage to host their first leg in Namibia due to shortage of standard facilities that meet the required CAF specifications.\nThat stated; the opening leg for their preliminary round in the CAF Champions League was played in South Africa, to which Vipers won 1-0 courtesy of defender Hilary Mukundane’s goal.\nHead coach of African Stars Bob Mafoso envisages the first leg in South Africa as a precursor for the Ugandan leg.\n“On paper, we were at home, but in reality away from home. This was a blessing of sorts that it prepared us for this away match in Uganda” Mafoso told the media on Thursday during the official pre-match press conference at Kitende.\nThe coach oozed with confidence coming to the Saturday flood-lit duel at the St Mary’s Stadium.\n“Our team (African Stars) is prepared. There are no injuries to worry about. I am happy with the squad we have. Only now the tactical side is left as we get closer to the game. We need to take the game to them (Vipers)” Mafoso added.\nLimited chances:\nMafoso pointed to the limited scoring opportunities for the two sides in the first leg.\n“The result from the first leg is not the true reflection of what transpired from the first leg. There were no chances created. Infact, Vipers got that half chance and utilized it. They played for only 17 or 20 minutes in the game” he highlighted.\nMafoso hinted of maintaining their identity of possessive display as they hold onto the ball to make the breakthrough.\n“Every-one of us knows the significance of this game. 1-0 score is not the most secure. Football needs discipline. Vipers is a strong team with the quality to compete but we are ready to push them” Mafoso added.\nAfrican Stars arrived in the country earlier in the week and were checked in at Hotel Horizon in the heart of Entebbe Municipality.",
