  "body_text": "With the summer transfer window being open for two weeks now, Tottenham Hotspur have continued to do their due diligence in the market.\nGold: More in-depth look as Tottenham looks to bolster its midfield\nfootball.London’s Alasdair Gold’s latest piece shines light on Spurs transfer prospects\nSo far, no official moves have been completed outside of Timo Werner rejoining Spurs on another loan spell, but the north London club has been linked with several players as football.London’s Alasdair Gold wrote in his latest piece about an in-depth look at the players Spurs are gauging interest in.\nKnowing the club has wanted to bolster up the midfield as potential outgoings of Denmark’s Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Argentina’s Giovani Lo Celso are quite likely, Spurs want to add depth with the latest coming in Aston Villa’s Jacob Ramsey.\nPlaying in 107 games (74 starts) since making the first-team in the 2020-21 season, Ramsey has 22 goal contributions for his hometown club. However, the 23-year-old midfielder played in just 16 Premier League games for Villa in the 23/24 campaign as he battled an injury-riddled season.\nDespite that, Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou and technical director Johan Lange really like the English talent as Lange spent a few years at Aston Villa and knows how Ramsey can play.\nEarning a Champions League place, Villa still moved on from its talented midfielder Douglas Luis as a swap deal with Juventus is close to being finalized. With that knowledge, Villa could be prepared to let one of its own in Ramsey leave the club but for a hefty price tag of £40million to £50million.\nSpurs remain interested in Chelsea captain Connor Gallagher — who holds a similar price tag — even if the west London side has announced its desire to keep Gallagher and work on a new contract extension as new manager Enzo Maresca bolsters up his midfield with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall joining him from Leicester City.\nThere are further options on Lange’s midfield shortlist as Tottenham look to lean heavily on data-driven transfers, something Postecoglou was also keen to push this summer, to ensure that those chosen fit his system perfectly to avoid the expensive errors of the past.\nAs for interest in Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze, things may seem a little more complicated as the south London side doesn’t want to lose Eze and Michael Olise in the same window.\nGold also added Spurs continue to hold interest in Rennes midfielder Desire Doue, an upcoming 19-year-old who has played all around the field for the Ligue 1 side.\nAnother bright talented teenager who Spurs are keeping an eye on is Leeds right-back Archie Gray. Playing 50 matches for his boyhood club as he became an academy graduate, Gray helped guide Leeds United to a Championship play-off final before losing to Southampton. Despite playing another season in the Championship, Leeds hold a value of £50million.",
