The intensity was not the same, the devastating high pressing was a step slower, the defense was way too vulnerable, and their unstoppable attack was stopped time and time again — mostly by themselves.\nHansi Flick sent out a couple of strong warnings after the Rayo match and on Saturday’s press conference before the Valencia game about the dangers of complacency and not playing as a unit, and how a general lack of intensity has cost them points already and could lead to even more trouble.\nThe next 21 days before the next international break bring seven matches in all competitions and two monster Champions League games away to Newcastle and at home to PSG, and every La Liga game from now on is already a must-win with Xabi Alonso’s Real Madrid yet to drop points and looking pretty solid so far.\nBarça must rediscover their best version as soon as possible, and Sunday is a great opportunity to do that: Barça utterly dominated Valencia last season, winning all three matchups by a combined score of 14-2, including a sensational 7-1 win at home in the league and a 5-0 destruction in the Copa del Rey in the last two games. Valencia have been solid under Carlos Corberán, but the coach simply hasn’t figured out how to stop the Flick machine yet.\nBut Valencia will be encouraged by the Blaugrana’s less than stellar start, and will be confident they can pull off an upset if their defense gives them a chance by keeping the game close for as long as possible before they try to steal a result later on.\nThe unexpected absence of Lamine Yamal due to injury presents a big challenge for Flick, but it’s also a chance for the likes of Marcus Rashford and Robert Lewandowski to return to the team and prove the attack can still be very dangerous even without the teenage superstar.\nBarça must start strong, convert their chances, and use the outside noise after a subpar first month as motivation to show they are still one of the best teams in the continent. The crowd will be small but passionate, and it’s up to the team to give them a reason to smile.\nLet’s dance.\nPOSSIBLE LINEUPS\nBarcelona (4-2-3-1): Garcia; Kounde, Cubarsí, Christensen, Martín; Casadó, Pedri; Raphinha, Fermín, Rashford; Lewandowski\nValencia (5-4-1): Agirrezabala; Rioja, Foulquier, Diakhaby, Tárrega, Gayà; Ramazani, Guerra, Santamaria, López; Danjuma\nPREDICTION\nValencia’s main priority will be to avoid another embarrassment, but they also know Barça are vulnerable and will look to exploit their weaknesses. But I believe Flick and his team will be motivated to quiet the noise after the first month, and will make a strong statement in this one: 4-1 Barça.",
