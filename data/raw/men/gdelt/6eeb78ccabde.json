What a game he had played. It happens.\nGuardiola also had no complaints about Real’s tactics, with the Spanish side forced to sit back and defend deep for much of the game.\n‘I don’t judge,’ he said. ‘I’m not here to do this. It’s football. In this competition, that’s the way football happens.’\nMORE: Micah Richards’ Champions League quarter-final predictions go viral for all the wrong reasons\nMORE: Joe Cole praises ‘absolute genius’ Cole Palmer after Chelsea penalty row against Everton",
