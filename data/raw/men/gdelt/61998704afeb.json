But you can never say never in football, and Barça still need to finish the job against a Dortmund team that will fight for their lives with one of the greatest atmospheres in the world in the Yellow Wall behind them.\nHere’s how we think Hansi Flick will line up his troops for Tuesday’s battle.\nDefense\nHansi Flick didn’t rotate his squad in the hard-fought win over Leganés at the weekend, but that shouldn’t change his plans of going with his strongest possible side in this one to make sure of qualification in Germany.\nBut the coach won’t be able to go with his favorite back four combination due to the unfortunate hamstring injury sustained by Alejandro Balde in Madrid, so Gerard Martín will step up at left-back for at least the next couple of weeks to prove he can be a quality backup for years to come. Jules Kounde will be the other full-back in the lineup, with Pau Cubarsí and Iñigo Martínez at center-back in front of Wojciech Szczesny.\nMidfield\nThe midfield trio of Frenkie de Jong, Pedri and Fermín López was sensational in the first leg, with Fermín deeply involved in two of the four goals while creating several other chances and doing a brilliant job pressing the Dortmund backline. It’s hard not to see that exact same midfield trio starting again in Germany, with Gavi having to wait for a chance off the bench in the second half.\nThere’s some excellent news as Dani Olmo has been medically cleared and will make the trip to Germany, but there’s no chance he’s ready for big minutes yet and will likely get only a small cameo in the second half depending on how the game goes.\nAttack\nEven though the midfield was dominant and crucial to the victory, the story of last Wednesday’s match was the front three getting back to their best as Raphinha and Lamine Yamal looked awesome both as creators and finishers and Robert Lewandowski showed his striker instincts to score two big goals against his favorite victim.\nThose three need to be clinical in the second leg as well, and they might have quite a few opportunities on the counter if Dortmund decide to play like they have nothing to lose and leave spaces at the back. The chances could be there to add even more goals and assists to their incredible combined tally this season, and the output from last week suggests they are ready to do so.\nPossible XI: Szczesny; Kounde, Cubarsí, Iñigo, Martín; De Jong, Pedri; Yamal, Fermín, Raphinha; Lewandowski (4-2-3-1)\nHow do you think Barcelona should line up against Dortmund?
