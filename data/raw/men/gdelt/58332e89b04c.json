  "body_text": "His name. His number. Again. Kevin De Bruyne. Eleven. Not an early bath. But more hot water for Napoli.\nThe competitor within De Bruyne didn’t seem to get it. Another substitution. Really? There was more than 25 minutes still to play at San Siro. His penalty, the second of his Napoli career, gave the team a chance in the first big league game of the season. Milan were down to 10 men, their backs against the wall, defending a 2-1 lead. They couldn’t hold out, could they? Not against a team with De Bruyne’s eye, his imagination.\nAdvertisement\nSurely he’d find the space between, the ball over the top, the way through, the moment leading to an equaliser?\nNo. Not from the bench, he wouldn’t.\nOn 72 minutes, Antonio Conte made a triple substitution. The entire Manchester contingent was withdrawn. An ineffective Rasmus Hojlund left the stage. A wincing Scott McTominay hobbled off, his ankle in pain.\nDe Bruyne did not seem so accepting of the decision. His face was flush and not from exertion. Unlike McTominay, he wasn’t carrying a knock. Fatigue wasn’t a factor. And besides, Milan would have to do the running. Not him. So the Belgian bristled. He barked and let it all out.\nThis premature exit felt different from his return to the Etihad. Giovanni Di Lorenzo’s early red card against Manchester City on September 18 left Conte feeling he had no option but to replace De Bruyne after 26 minutes. Napoli’s coach cursed the fates. He never dreamed of doing it and De Bruyne let that one slide.\nHe understood the thought process on that occasion. In Milan, it looked like De Bruyne didn’t.\n“I hope he was upset about the result,” Conte said. “Because if he was upset for some other reason, he’s picked on the wrong person.”\nDe Bruyne had not played badly. He had been trying to make things happen, particularly for Hojlund, hitting diagonals that were like threading a needle against Milan’s watertight back three. Although his preparedness to take risks meant he perhaps gave the ball away a little too often, his pass completion rate (78 per cent) was not as bad as Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa (71 per cent), whose size and aerial prowess meant he stayed on instead.\nAt 34, De Bruyne’s body probably does need protecting regardless of how he feels in the moment. Conte, for what it’s worth, has already suffered too many casualties this season. Hojlund’s acquisition was sanctioned only after Romelu Lukaku picked up a bad injury. To make matters worse, Napoli then lost Alessandro Buongiorno earlier in the week, the best centre-back at the club along with Amir Rrahmani, who got hurt playing for Kosovo during the international break.\nAdvertisement\nRecall Napoli have the Champions League this week, Milan don’t, and so Conte has to manage his players differently to Max Allegri. Nevertheless, it was quite something to behold Luka Modric — a player six years older than De Bruyne — intercept, steal and run and run and run for nearly 100 minutes in Sunday’s top-of-the-table clash. “He knows how to manage games,” Adrien Rabiot said. “To play like that for 90 minutes at his age…” How does he do it? Rabiot initially had no answer to the follow-up question. He stared down the camera, apparently speechless prompting the studio to move the conversation on, only for Rabiot to come to a sudden realisation: “He loves football.”\nModric closes Milan fashion week\n“It’s a pity that there are so few players like Luka in the world today,” Allegri said on the eve of the game. “You can’t even count them on one hand.”\nPerhaps it was because of how Milan finished the game, having played 40 minutes barricaded in and under siege after Pervis Estupinan’s red card, but the Croatian was more of a talking point than Milan’s goalscorers. The sight of Modric and Rabiot dug-in and then dashing out of the trenches was symbolic of a new spirit at the club.\nMilan’s owners wanted a cultural reset in the summer. The captain Davide Calabria went last January. Then vice-captain Theo Hernandez in the summer and so in addition to his apparent timelessness on the pitch, Modric fills the leadership gap left by Simon Kjaer, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Olivier Giroud.\nAs does Rabiot.\nMuch was made of the circumstances around his exit from Marseille. But Rabiot was one of Allegri’s second captains at Juventus and, having already distinguished himself in Turin, the rangy Frenchmen seems to have added more to his game in a year spent with Roberto De Zerbi.\nMilan, refreshingly, look like a family again. Even the return of a more mature Alexis Saelemaekers, who was a member of Milan’s last title-winning team in 2022, appears to have contributed to a more wholesome, less toxic environment.\nAdvertisement\nIt was Saelemaekers who opened the scoring against Napoli after Christian Pulisic taught centre-back Luca Marianucci a lesson on his debut. The American turned and burned, dashing down the sideline, keeping the ball in play, and beat Marianucci again before setting up Saelemaekers.\nMilan’s well-worked second also owed much to the aggressiveness of centre-back Strahinja Pavlovic, the presence of mind of Youssouf Fofana and Pulisic’s deadliness.\nLast week Allegri’s assistant Marco Landucci said he is a death knell for goalkeepers this season. The bell tolled again on Sunday.\nIt is early days, but Pulisic is, for now, Serie A’s Capocannoniere, averaging a goal or an assist every 42 minutes. The win, Milan’s fifth in a row between league and cup, sent the team level with Napoli and Roma at the summit of Serie A in a three-way tie. The pretenders to Napoli’s crown have one thing in common: resolute defences. Milan’s backline ranked 11th and seventh in the last two seasons. It has unsurprisingly improved under Allegri. Only Roma have leaked fewer goals so far this season.\nOn the one hand, Roma have picked up where they left off last season, albeit with a different coach. They also stand as proof of what Gian Piero Gasperini can do with more talent and a higher wage bill than at Atalanta. The Lupi have conceded once all season, won the derby and been able to manage injuries like the one sustained by Paulo Dybala.\nWhile the results have matched or exceeded expectations, the performances have not. Roma are out there grinding. They have kept more clean sheets than anyone and four of their five wins between Serie A and the Europa League have been by a single goal.\nSix of their seven goals have come from different scorers and Artem Dovbyk’s opener against Verona at the weekend was the first from one of Roma’s strikers.\nAdvertisement\nNeither the Ukrainian — whom Roma even considered swapping for Milan’s Santi Gimenez late in the transfer window — nor Evan Ferguson has yet to thrive as so many forwards have under Gasp, from Marco Borriello and Diego Milito to Duvan Zapata, Hojlund and Mateo Retegui.\nThere is still time. For now, goalkeeper Mile Svilar has been Roma’s major difference-maker.\nSerie A’s best shot stopper by Miles\nMake no mistake, the best business Roma did in the summer was persuading Svilar to sign an extension.\nHe was second in Serie A last season for Goals Saved Above Average — which some might know as “Goals Prevented” — measuring how many goals a goalkeeper concedes versus the number they are expected to concede based on the quality of the shots faced.\nRight now, he is top. An average keeper would have let in 2.8 (let’s round it up to 3) more goals when confronted with the chances he has faced so far this season and his stops at the weekend were crucial.\n“If our defensive stats are what they are, a lot of it is down to Svilar,” Gasperini acknowledged to DAZN.\nThe 26-year-old was a surprise omission from the shortlist for the Yashin Trophy last week, which deservedly found itself in the large hands of Gigi Donnarumma for a second time.\nDonnarumma, for now, is still the most famous alumnus from ASD Club Napoli in Castellammare di Stabia. But for how long?\nThe family business\nA boys’ club, down the coast from Naples, ASD Club Napoli is also where the Esposito brothers started playing football. Salvatore, Sebastiano and Francesco Pio are all in their early 20s. All of them have played in Serie A.\nSalvatore, the eldest, and Seba, the middle child, were reunited at SPAL in the second tier for one season. Then, last year, Salvatore and Francesco Pio teamed up for Spezia, making a play-off final which they lost to Cremonese.\nAdvertisement\nOver the years, one has passed the hype baton to the other. Lukaku memorably let Seba take a penalty for Inter back in 2019. He made no mistake and, at 17, became the youngest player to score for them at San Siro in almost 60 years.\nNow at Cagliari, he is in his eighth separate loan spell. Each one has been more prolific than the next although the spotlight has definitively shifted to Pio who, along with Liverpool’s Giovanni Leoni, is considered the outstanding Italian talent of his age group, regardless of position.\nPio scored 17 times for Spezia last season. He showed enough promise to discourage Inter from replacing Marko Arnautovic and Mehdi Taremi with another experienced forward. Instead Pio has competed with Ange-Yoan Bonny as an alternative for Lautaro Martinez and Marcus Thuram.\nCapped by Italy in the last international break, a couple of scoreless starts against Ajax and Sassuolo raised the question: is the hype justified?\nAfter Erling Haaland scored his 50th Champions League goal a fortnight ago, a wry tweet went viral. “It’s a shame for (Haaland) he was born in the Pio Esposito era otherwise he would have been spoken about a lot more.”\nThen there was a side-by-side comparison with Kenan Yildiz, his contemporary at Juventus.“Yildiz: 20 years old. 18 goals and 15 assists in all competitions. Good player. Esposito: 20 years old. You can count his first-team appearances on one hand. Zero goals and assists. Fenomeno.”\nOne Saturday in Sardinia won’t change some of these opinions. There was an Esposito derby at the Unipol Domus.\nSeba started for Cagliari. Pio came on for Inter and won the game. His 82nd-minute tap-in from an exquisite Federico Dimarco cross caused Inter’s coach Cristian Chivu to celebrate as if he’d won the treble again.\nPio’s first goal for Inter turned a tense 1-0 lead into a welcome 2-0 win.\n“You can all see his quality,” Alessandro Bastoni said. “He’s finally opened his account and he’s going to give us a big hand at Inter and with the national team because he’s got unique ability. He’s 20 and he’s already ready but he has to keep his feet on the ground and keep working.”\nChivu tried his hardest to manage expectation too amid the inevitable calls for Pio to start for Italy in the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Estonia and Israel.\nOne reason for them is the run of bad luck Moise Kean finds himself on at Fiorentina.\nAdvertisement\nMagnificent in the last international break, Kean has scored three times in two games for his country but remains goalless for his club this season.\nThe Athletic’s Player of the Year in Italy last term, Kean has been unlucky up until now, under-performing his xG (2.8) and experiencing the frustration of having a couple of goals ruled out for offside in Sunday lunchtime’s Tuscan derby.\nA derby decades in the making\nTo look at the 0-0 scoreline you’d be forgiven for thinking you didn’t miss much. On the contrary, it was arguably the game of the weekend.\nPisans love to hate Florentines and have done since the Middle Ages when the House of the Medici fell, Guelphs fought Ghibellines and one of their own, Count Ugolino della Gherardesca, betrayed them.\nFiorentina’s ultras refused to go to the game in protest at ticket prices but showed up on the outskirts of Pisa, smarting for a fight anyway.\n“Where are our enemies?” they cried.\nDove sono i nostri nemici?\nUltras viola a passeggio per Pisa ⚜️#PisaFiorentina #UltrasItalia pic.twitter.com/VCFyJSL358— Fiorentina Uno (@FiorentinaUno) September 28, 2025\nSome of their former heroes, Alberto Gilardino and Dario Dainelli, were in the Pisa dugout.\nM’Bala Nzola, their old striker, was up front for Pisa and hit the bar, Juan Cuadrado struck the post and Henrik Meister curled in arguably the goal of the weekend only for it to be disallowed for handball.\nIn the end, a goal was all that was missing. There was blood and thunder, and the encounter was saltier than a pitch seasoned by Pisa’s former owner Romeo Anconetani who used to superstitiously spread the stuff around the ground before games.\nPisa have leaned into their first Serie A season in 34 years and deserve more than a couple of points from five games.\nAs for Fiorentina, Stefano Pioli is still winless in Serie A since his return to the club. As he waved his arms in the air on the sideline at the Garibaldi, the tattoo of the Scudetto he won with Milan in 2022 was visible on his wrist.\nIt doesn’t look like it is going to be his year.\nBut maybe, at least, it’ll still be Milan’s.\n(Top photo: Mairo Cinquetti/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
