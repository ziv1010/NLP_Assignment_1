Apple is also now live-streaming every single MLS game for the next 10 years in an exclusive deal that brings the league to Apple TV for a subscription fee of $12.99-$14.99 a month. The new deal brings all of the games live to Apple TV with no regional blackouts, studio content, and more, with the first games kicking off this past weekend.\nRumor has it that MLB and Friday Night Baseball are coming back to Apple TV Plus in 2023, albeit with an overhauled crew.
