Appearing on The Sports Agents podcast he said: “Yep, they didn't win [the tie vs PSG]. But there is a progression at this club. It's quite clear. There's a progression.\n\"They were out of the Champions League for six years. Mikel Arteta comes in; he changes a culture of the club. So hard to do.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\n\"Mikel Arteta has done his job. He's stabilised the team. The team is stable. You know what you’re going to get; you know they're going to compete physically.\n\"To the ‘Mikel out’ brigade, sorry, but you've got a manager there for a while!\"\nSome of the criticism levelled at Arteta revolves around his squad building. Arsenal seem light in some departments, notably striking and attacking options with natural centre-midfielder Mikel Merino having to deputise following injury to Kai Havertz in February.\nAndrea Berta was hired as the new Sporting Director in March and many believe this is a move that will propel Arsenal to the next level.\n\"The way that the role of Andres Berta has been explained to me by the club, he’s not coming in to be the assistant to Mikel,\" Balague said on The Sports Agents podcast.\n\"He comes in at the same level as Mikel Arteta to say, ‘Okay, tell me the profile you need. I'm going to get you the player…’ This is the guy that everybody expects to take arsenal to the next level. Now that they’re stable, they need better quality.”\nThe rumour mill has been going into overdrive surrounding Arsenal already, with names such as Alexander Isak, Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres all mentioned in the past few weeks as they look to prepare a more solid title challenge next season.\nIt is yet to been seen where Arsenal prioritise ahead of the new season, but it does seem a striker will be top of the shopping list.\nEwan is a freelance writer and social media manager who has worked for The Athletic, GOAL, 90min and OneFootball.
