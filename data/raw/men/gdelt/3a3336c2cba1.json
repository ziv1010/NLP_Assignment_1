Then with only a minute to go, Kolo Muani put away his second goal and the winner for Juventus when they were awarded a penalty.\nThere was still time for Como to hit the bar, but on debut Lloyd Kelly helped Juventus pick up an undeserved three points that leaves them fourth in Serie A.\nNow the whoscored have published their automated player ratings for this Como 1 Juventus 2 match:\nAs you can see, Lloyd Kelly with a rating of 6.3, the second highest of the five subs (the Whoscored display can only show four subs at any one time, Luiz got a rating of 6.2).\nA solid enough first appearance for Juventus and most important of all, a big three points that puts them, as things stand, in a Champions League qualifying position.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
