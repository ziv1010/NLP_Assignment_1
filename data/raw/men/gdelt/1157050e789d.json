  "body_text": "The will-he, won’t-he saga of Kylian Mbappe’s move to Real Madrid continues to lead the football headlines around the world.\nThe French World Cup winner has dillied, dallied and toyed with Los Blancos for what seems like an age now, but at the time of writing he still remains a Paris Saint-Germain employee.\nSmart money appears to be on the striker swapping the Parc des Princes for the Santiago Bernabeu, but all the while he hasn’t put pen to paper on a ground-breaking deal with the Spanish giants, PSG president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, will believe that he’s in with a chance of keeping his talisman.\nDuring an exclusive interview with transfer expert and CaughtOffside columnist, Fabrizio Romano, on Thursday, La Liga president, Javier Tebas, who would need to oversee any incoming transfers to the clubs in his league, offered some up-to-date insight on the Mbappe saga.\n??? EXCL — La Liga president Javier Tebas on Kylian Mbappé: “I said it was around 50% some weeks ago, now is even more”.\n55/60% chances? “Yes, I think so”. ??\n“Every day that passes and Mbappé does not sign the new contract with PSG, the percentage increases”. pic.twitter.com/fdpdAQQzFi\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) February 8, 2024\n“I said it (a move to Madrid) was around 50% some weeks ago, now it’s even more,” he was quoted as saying by Romano in a post on X (formerly Twitter).\n“55/60% chances? Yes, I think so. Every day that passes and Mbappe does not sign the new contract with PSG, the percentage increases.”\nWith the Champions League due to begin again next week for some clubs – including PSG – it’s about time that Mbappe put everyone out of their misery and announced his intentions.\nWhilst it clearly isn’t as simple as just choosing one club or another, the player will have known for some while now where his heart desires, so keeping everyone on tenterhooks is unprofessional to say the least.",
