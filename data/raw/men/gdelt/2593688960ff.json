And I really value that.\n“What I can promise is that I will do my very best (to win a trophy) and I will give my life, and get every drop of everybody here to squeeze it and get the best (out of them).”\nForest in the hunt\nNewcastle remain in third place heading into the final day of the campaign, but they are separated from Nottingham Forest in seventh by just a single point.\nNuno Espirito Santo’s men are level on 65 points with Manchester City, who have a game in hand, and firmly in the race for a Champions League spot ahead of their crucial showdown with Chelsea after a 2-1 win at West Ham courtesy of goals from Morgan Gibbs-White and Nikola Milenkovic.\nDedicating the victory to striker Taiwo Awoniyi as he continues his recovery from emergency abdominal surgery, head coach Nuno Espirito Santo said: “Since the beginning of our preparations, ‘T’ was on our minds due to the seriousness of the situation, and the boys really wanted to do it for him.\n“That was our final words, ‘let’s give it a push’. He is someone we admire, his smile is contagious and the boys did it for him. We are so proud.”\nTrebles all round\nChelsea boss Sonia Bompastor is celebrating a remarkable first season in English football after adding the Women’s FA Cup to her WSL title and League Cup successes.\nTwo goals from Sandy Baltimore either side of a Catarina Macario’s header handed the Frenchwoman a 3-0 victory over holders Manchester United in front of a crowd of 74,412 at Wembley on a day when Sir Jim Ratcliffe, minority owner at Old Trafford, was conspicuous by his absence.\nBompastor said: “We just showed our mentality, our values, in this game, and I think to be able to end the season in almost a perfect scenario.\n“We won, we were playing at Wembley, it was sold out, and we had a strong performance, strong results, I think against a strong opponent. That’s almost the ideal way to end the season.”\nWhat’s on today?\n'It's not going to be an easy game – but we're ready' 👊\nHarvey Elliott's #BHALIV preview 🗣️\n— Liverpool FC (@LFC) May 18, 2025\nLiverpool complete the penultimate round of Premier League fixtures when they head for Brighton on Monday evening.\nArne Slot’s men sit 12 points clear of second-placed Arsenal with a game in hand, but have won neither of their last two outings, a 3-1 defeat at Chelsea and a 2-2 home draw with the Gunners.\nThe Seagulls can finish no higher than eighth, although that could yet be good enough for a Conference League berth.",
