The teams include the past two champions of Saudi Arabia, Al Ittihad and Al Hilal. Al Ittihad has signed Karim Benzema and Al Hilal is closing in on a deal for Neymar.\nA second-tier competition for 32 teams will be called the AFC Champions League 2 instead of the AFC Cup. A 20-team, third-tier AFC Challenge League also will be launched, the AFC said.\nInvitations to enter clubs in the inaugural AFC Women’s Champions League next season will also be sent to the 47 member federations, the governing body said.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer",
