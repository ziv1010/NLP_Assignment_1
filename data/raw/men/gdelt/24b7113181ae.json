So it doesn’t matter the result, how proud the people who love Barcelona are.”\nGuardiola also had some praise for Inter and Simone Inzaghi and is looking forward to next week’s return game.\n“And I think Inter prove again when we won the Champions League against the opponent we played, it’s incredible Inter how good they defend in transitions, physicality, well organised. Inzaghi is an unbelievable manager,” he added.\n“Next Tuesday and Wednesday will be incredible, the two games. I think they’re four fantastic teams and they deserve to be there.”\nThe winners of the tie will play either PSG or Arsenal in the final in Munich.
