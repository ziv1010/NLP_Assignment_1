And generally on the whole (apart from a few exceptions i:e Boy George) most of them have been courteous and friendly.\nAnd I can honestly say that I have never really been “star struck.” That is until last week.\nAs a young boy growing up in England my favorite sport was football and my club Liverpool FC. My boyhood room was adorned with posters of Liverpool greats. And I vividly remember watching my first live Liverpool game when they played in London. On that day I was mesmerized by one player.\nWhilst other players were running he was gliding, the ball at his feet like stuck to a magnet and the twisting and turning abilities of an eel. His name, John Barnes. Sorry, John Barnes MBE, as he was decorated by the Queen for his services to football.\nHe played over 300 times for Liverpool and almost 80 times for England, he won everything there is to win for Liverpool. And I would mimic his moves and celebrations playing with my friends in the park.\nAlmost 40 years later and there he was sipping a cappuccino opposite me in a Dubrovnik hotel.\n\"If you had told my 16-year-old self that one day I'd be having a chat with you, he'd have thought I was completely nuts,\" I started. Yep, I was totally star struck. “I used to have a poster of you on my wall and now we are drinking coffee,” I continued. He laughed.\n“But, I also had a poster of Cindy Crawford, so you know, fingers crossed,” I smiled. He laughed louder.\nNow a couple of days before I was to meet the Liverpool legend I told an English friend. “Lucky you, ask him about the goal against Brazil,” he said. English football fans of a certain generation remember that goal.\nBarnes was playing his first match for England at the age of 19 against Brazil in the iconic Maracanã stadium. And he dribbled past half the Brazilian team and scored a wonder goal. Commentators at the time joked that “he looked like he should be playing in yellow not white.”\nOf course, I asked him. And he modestly answered “I got lucky, nobody seemed to want to tackle me.”\nEven after my jokey start he was kind enough to give me a 20-minutes interview and of course I asked him about Dubrovnik. “It looks just the same as it does in the Game of Thrones,” was his answer. And he was quick to add “My wife’s new favorite restaurant in the whole world right now is located in Zaton.”\nWe mostly talked football, past and present. And when I touched on Croatian football he smiled. “You don’t have to ask me, it is Luka Modrić, always Luka Modrić, the greatest Croatian ever to play the game,” he said. “And you have had some awesome players, Boban, Asanović, Prosinečki and Šuker, all in one team, amazing,” he remembered commentating on Croatia in the 1998 World Cup.\n“But Modrić is the one, a perfect example that you don’t have to be big and strong to be successful, you need desire and hard work, which I guess is the same in many walks of life,” clearly he had seen Modrić many times live and went onto recall famous matches for Real Madrid and Croatia.\nIn fact, I was quite surprised at his knowledge of the HNL and former Croatian players. We talked Hajduk and Dinamo and even back to him scoring against Yugoslavia in 1987 in Belgrade.\n“Money rules the game now, will a team from Croatian ever win the Champions League, no, never. But neither will a team from Denmark, Sweden or Scotland. Money has warped the game,” he concluded. To be honest I could have talked to him all day. And not just about football. He is a huge advocate for the problem of racism in football and has been involved in a large number of anti-racism projects.\nLife is strange. You never really know what is coming down the road. But I have a feeling my boyhood self still wouldn’t believe me.\nMy mum summed it up perfectly “Well I never, who’d have thought that would happen.” Not me mum, not me.\nRead more Englishman in Dubrovnik…well, if you really want to.
