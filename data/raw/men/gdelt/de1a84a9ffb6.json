That probably adds another layer of difficulty to it, but we’ll endeavour because I think there’s definitely a need for us to reinforce. We’ll just see how successful we are in that.”\nPostecoglou revealed on Tuesday he would be home alone on Christmas Day due to his wife and young children going back to Australia, but he retained his festive spirit by pushing back the time of training on the day before a trip to Forest.\nA post shared by Tottenham Hotspur (@spursofficial)\nIt allowed his players to spend the majority of the day with their own families on Christmas Day before they travel to Nottingham, where Spurs will aim to climb the table from 11th spot.\nSpurs’ list of unavailable players has hit double figures since a 4-0 victory at Manchester City on November 23, but light is at the end of the tunnel with Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero, Mikey Moore and Richarlison primed to return in January.\n“I always felt after the City game this is the toughest period we would come up against in terms of the number of games and the squad we had. We’ve still got at least a couple of games to go in that period and we’ve just got to hang on,” Postecoglou reflected.\n“It’s an unusual year and I think it will stay an unusual year. Liverpool are in a great moment but everyone else is having challenges. Maybe Chelsea is still OK squad wise, with injuries.\n“In a very competitive league, it doesn’t take much for a team to be disrupted in terms of their form because you look from second or third to 16th and in any given week anyone can win.\n“The spread of points is not what you would expect at this time of year, so it’s going to be a tight league all year and any team who gets some consistency and keeps their players healthy can make a real impact.”",
