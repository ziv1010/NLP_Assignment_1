The former England keeper was in Turkey earlier this week to finalise a three-year deal and pass a medical, the clubs having agreed a £2 million fee.\nBursa’s move for Carson appeared to have broken down last week, leading them to look towards Fülöp, the Hungarian’s father and agent Ferenc confirming that a tentative approach had been made.\nFülöp has only a year left on his Blues contract, having signed from Sunderland for £750,000 last August and seems likely to move on during the close season with manager Paul Jewell appearing unconvinced by the 28-year-old, Arran Lee-Barrett having been given the nod ahead of him for a number of games late in the season.\nDespite backing his current keepers towards the end of the season, Jewell is understood to want to bring in a new first choice this summer.\nLee-Barrett has signed a new two-year but looks likely to be seen as back-up rather than a regular starter, while Brian Murphy opted against extending his stay and is currently looking for a new club.\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nPRACTICE CATCHING THE BALL AT CORNERS MATE.\nhow good was he against arsenal!!!!!!!!! eh! eh\nScott Carson. Your career continues to slide into obscurity.\nAnd get him practicing set pieces.\nBlame Keno on the forum, his idea!\nI would like to see us sign a new keeper this summer regardless of where he ends up, Lee-Barrett just isn't good enough for a first or second choice keeper at Championship level, and it doesn't appear we have some wonder keeper progressing through the youth levels.\nFulop continues to flap at Town after Turkey deals falls through.\nits a good job it wasnt his fault for the other 6or7 clear chances they had otherwise it could of been 7 or 8 nil!!\nhe does need a brush up but thought the comment was a bit harsh on him for that game!\ncome to think about it, it was a bad error\nhe may flap about a lot but he is probably the best keeper we have had since wright left us for arsenal.\nRe Wrighty, I seem to recall him flapping at quite a few crosses. Sereni started well before falling away.\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
