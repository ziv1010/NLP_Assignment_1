Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nMan City have struggled for consistency this season – losing almost a third of their league games – but moved back above Chelsea into second with a nervy 3-2 win over Leeds United on Saturday.\nA City win looked inevitable when they raced into a two-goal lead Phil Foden and Josko Gvardiol, but Leeds equalised through second-half goals from Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Lukas Nmecha.\nManchester City were minutes away from another deflating result when Foden scored his second of the afternoon in injury time to earn the hosts a narrow win.\nSpeaking before Saturday’s Premier League fixtures, Sherwood said on Sky Sports: ‘I thought the north London derby was a huge game of football because if Arsenal lost that they would be going to Chelsea on the back of a defeat and that would have been difficult.\n‘But I think they beat Chelsea now. I don’t see anyone challenging them this season.\n‘I think the nearest challengers will come from the team with the experience of being able to win the league and that’s Man City. They will be the nearest challengers.\n‘We asked if Arsenal could cope with the injuries and they have, players have come in and performed.\n‘They’ve got players like Declan Rice who is an AI player. If you wanted to make a player to be a manager’s dream it would be Rice, he’s got everything.\n‘The only thing missing is trophies but once they get over the line – which I think they will – everyone else has got a problem.’\nSpeaking ahead of Sunday’s huge London derby, Chelsea boss Maresca said it was ‘too early’ to declare his side title contenders.\nMaresca repeatedly downplayed Chelsea’s title credentials last season and was proved right as the west Londoners finished 15 points behind Liverpool.\n‘For me, it’s very early,’ the Italian told reporters on Friday. ‘It’s too early in any case if we win or don’t win [against Arsenal].\n‘It’s November, there’s five or six months to go. It’s important where we are [in the table] in February and March and we’ll see if we can achieve something important.’\nArsenal manager Arteta disagrees with Maresca, however, and says Chelsea ‘deserve’ to be in the Premier League title race.\nMore Trending\nAsked whether he viewed Chelsea as title challengers, Arteta said: ‘I think we are all there, and they are there because they fully deserve what they have done in the last few years.\n‘I think the squad that they assembled, the numbers that they have, the quality that they have, the number of coaches they have it makes sense that what is happening there is very, very positive and they deserve to be there.\n‘It is one of the teams that I enjoy the most watching and they have a lot of fluidity, they have a lot of threat, they have a lot of individual talent.\n‘They are very clear what they want to do and that’s why they are very tough.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Moises Caicedo reveals why he rejected Arsenal to join Chelsea\nMORE: Enzo Maresca told he has ‘problem’ with two Chelsea signings\nMORE: Pep Guardiola issues warning to Man City squad ahead of Chelsea vs Arsenal",
