What the settlers, the colonisers did when they came to Victoria. I did not know of the massacres, I'm ashamed to say. I have learned about the size and scale of the murders and the massacres through my preparation for my appearance today.\"\nThe Commission has urged her to act on her words.\n**\nThe federal government has announced a $14.2 million package to policing and other community safety support programs in Alice Springs, following a surge of violent incidents in the region.\nThe package will be added to the $250 million funding that was announced last May to safeguard the Northern Territory and Central Australia.\nIt comes shortly after a three-week curfew in the area which was imposed after the death of an 18 year-old in a car crash that led to a violent feud.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese, who is visiting Alice Springs to announce the funding, says all young people deserve an education.\n\"We're determined to make sure that we make these right investments. That's why we've contributed $250 million through the Central Australia package - a billion dollars combined between the Commonwealth and Territory - to double, literally, the funding that the national government is putting into public schools so that every young Territorean can get the opportunity of a good education.\"\n**\nThe US State Department has found five units of the Israeli military responsible for gross violations of human rights in incidents that took place outside of Gaza before the conflict broke out in October.\nState Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters at a press conference that four of the units have remediated the violation, while Israel has submitted additional information regarding the fifth.\nMr Patel said weapons sales to the units will not be affected, while he also declined to offer specifics on what human rights violations were committed or what remediation steps were taken.\nIsrael's military conduct has come under increasing scrutiny as its forces have killed some 34,500 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's health authorities.\nThe International Criminal Court, which can charge individuals with war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, is investigating Hamas' 7th of October cross-border attack and Israel's devastating military assault on Gaza.\n**\nIn football, Australian coach Ange Postecoglou says new technologies have taken away the decision-making capabilities from referees.\nPostecoglou saw Tottenham lose at home 2-3 to Arsenal and fall seven points behind Aston Villa in the battle for a place in next season's Champions League.\nThe Spurs had a goal overruled by the VAR and their appeals for a penalty were denied right before the \"gunners\" scored their second goal.\nThe Australian says referees have become overly reliant on the VAR in current football matches.\n\"What matters is that, as I've said all along, games are not refereed at the stadium anymore. They're refereed somewhere else. And no one will convince me otherwise. It's not even re-refereed, it's refereed somewhere else. That's why I don't celebrate goals anymore. I got to wait for somebody down the road, so... I just don't think referees in the stadium anymore have that authority they used to to make decisions. They just go \"you know what? I'll just wait till (I) see what the bloke down the road thinks.\" It's a shame, I don't like it, but it's here to stay.\"",
