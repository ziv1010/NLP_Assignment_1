It's daft having Provincial Finalist seedings based on reaching a final but there are different levels and number of teams per province. Seed the All Ireland solely on league position and Tailteann Cup winners from previous year. Or go back to 4 provincial winners getting a bye to quarter final. Have knockout rounds from remaining 12 to get to quarter final, provincial losers bye to quarter final playoff. In 2025 any provincial finalists taking their eye off winning their province, by looking at potential group opponents, aren't confident and focussed on going far in the All Ireland Series. I think very few teams think that way but plenty of supporters on forums can look for negatives when there's loads of positives when confidence is high.\nGreenandRed (Mayo) - Posts: 8436 - 29/04/2025 15:45:26\n2605427\nLink\n0\n|\n|\nReplying To sligo joe: \"Only counties due to meet each other in a provincial final will be precluded from being in the same group, so Meath as seeds 1 or 2, could be in the same group as Dublin seeded 3.\" Think it is between Galway and Kerry for Sam tbh.\nDonegal should make the semi, and after that, it depends on the draw.\nArmagh and Tyrone will be there or thereabouts.\nAnd Mayo - well you never know...\nFionn (Dublin) - Posts: 4793 - 29/04/2025 16:43:10\n2605453\nLink\n0\n|\n|\nReplying To ForeverBlue2: \"Having the draw before all the provincial finals are over is a complete joke… what's their hurry..?

I think they should have the draw after the provincial finals, but it's not the biggest issue in the world. As sporting organisations go, the GAA is incredibly well run. The amount of moving parts from grassroots all the way up to national level is incredible. Have they made mistakes? Plenty. Anyone trying to run an organisation of that scale and deal with challenges which are often external, is going to make mistakes. It has been a massive success story, and as an amateur sporting organisation, it has achieved an incredible amount. We have sports which are so intertwined with their communities. I'm sure you would have done a better job though.\nWanPintWin (Galway) - Posts: 2719 - 29/04/2025 17:58:47\n2605492\nLink\n4\n|",
