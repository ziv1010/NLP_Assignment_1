I think he did really well.’\nBefore Arsenal take on PSG, they host Crystal Palace on Wednesday night knowing that defeat could hand the Premier League title to Liverpool.\n‘We have to somehow put 11 players out there and have four or five changes, so let’s see how they recover in the next few days,’ Arteta said when asked how he would rotate his side.\n‘The good thing is they are willing to play because they like the rhythm as well. We are so used to that rhythm every three days that the boys are demanding and then we don’t have a game at the weekend, so we have a gap there, so let’s see how we get on on Wednesday.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Ruben Amorim names two Man Utd stars who ‘deserve better’ after Wolves disaster\nMORE: Fans convinced Chelsea star is leaving after brutal Enzo Maresca decision\nMORE: Enzo Maresca gives worrying Malo Gusto injury update after Chelsea beat Fulham",
