  "body_text": "Martin Zubimendi has explained why he rejected interest from Real Madrid and Liverpool to join Arsenal.\nThe Spanish midfielder completed a £60m move to Arsenal over the summer and has enjoyed an impressive start to his Premier League career.\nZubimendi has featured in all eight of Arsenal’s league games so far this season, helping Mikel Arteta’s side climb to the top of the table.\nThe 26-year-old was close to joining reigning Premier League champions Liverpool in the summer of 2024 but decided to snub the Anfield club in favour of spending one more season at boyhood club Real Sociedad.\nReal Madrid then expressed interest in signing Zubimendi last summer but the Euro 2024 winner says he had already decided to join Arsenal following talks with Arteta.\nAsked why he favoured a move to Arsenal despite interest from Real Madrid, Zubimendi told AS: ‘I don’t know, you get a feeling.\n‘Once I decided to leave Sociedad, Arsenal was a team that, from what I’d seen, suited me well, especially in terms of play.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘I also wanted a very detail-oriented manager, and in Mikel, as soon as I spoke to him, I found him.\n‘At Arsenal there was a very young team, with a lot of passion, very close-knit, eager to win, and even though they haven’t been able to do so, that makes them even more eager.’\nAsked if it was difficult to reject Real Madrid, who had just appointed legendary footballer Xabi Alonso as their new manager, Zubimendi added: ‘I can’t talk about other teams.\n‘Arsenal was the one I had decided on, and I went all in.’\nIt has been suggested in Spain that Real Madrid are missing a player like Zubimendi despite the fact they are currently top of La Liga.\n‘I don’t know, I don’t know. We’re talking about very big clubs,’ Zubimendi said when it was put to him that Real Madrid could do with a player of his profile.\n‘To say that Real Madrid was missing a piece like me is saying something because all the players they have are spectacular.’\nArsenal boss Arteta heaped praise on Zubimendi ahead of the club’s Champions League clash against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday night.\nAsked about Zubimendi’s form and pundits likening the Arsenal star to Manchester City’s Ballon d’Or winner Rodri, Arteta told Marca: ‘I don’t like comparisons.\n‘I think ‘Zubi’ has to make his own way, and he’s doing so. Since he’s arrived, his impact on the team has been exceptional, and that’s very difficult.\n‘I’ve seen many midfielders reach the Premier League, coming from top positions in other leagues, and they’ve struggled; it’s taken them a year or two to become who they are.\n‘The speed and naturalness with which he’s adapting is surprising.\nMore Trending\n‘We’ve given him confidence and a clear role, at all levels, including decisions we’ve made here with players who were there but are no longer here.\n‘We gave him space. And then, he feels comfortable with our style; it suits his way of playing.’\nArsenal are joint-top of the Champions League table with two wins from two, while Atletico Madrid are currently 10th on three points.\nWhile the Gunners beat Olympiakos and Athletic Bilbao, Diego Simeone’s Atletico returned to winning ways against Eintracht Frankfurt following an opening defeat to Liverpool.\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Arsenal and Chelsea eyeing transfer move for midfielder loved by Cesc Fabregas\nMORE: Arsenal vs Crystal Palace: Latest team news, predicted lineups and injuries\nMORE: Rio Ferdinand claims key Liverpool star will already be ‘doubting’ summer move",
