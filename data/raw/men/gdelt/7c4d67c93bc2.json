While Klopp has already won the UEFA Champions League, Carabao Cup, FA Cup, FIFA Club World Cup and Premier League during his time at the club and cemented his legacy as one of the greatest managers in English football history, he could be set to enjoy the most trophy-laden few months of his Liverpool career.\nHaving won the Carabao Cup on Sunday, Klopp and Liverpool find themselves on the brink of a remarkable quadruple this campaign, with the Reds currently sitting top of the Premier League and being seen as one of the favourites to win both the UEFA Europa League and FA Cup.\nSpeaking about whether or not the prospect of winning a quadruple could change Klopp's mind about leaving Anfield, defender Gomez replied: \"Nah, definitely not.\n\"Understanding how long he's been here, I think he knows he has done everything he can. He has won it all. Everyone respects his decision and we understand it.\n\"He is one of the wisest men we know and when he says he's ready, he's ready. It is what it is, we can't dwell on that, we just have to do him justice.\n\"We know it's that last hurrah and we just want to give our all for him. We always did but now when the finishing line is in sight it adds that extra emphasis.\"\nLiverpool will continue their hunt for a famous quadruple when they welcome Championship club Southampton to Anfield for their FA Cup fifth round clash on Wednesday.",
