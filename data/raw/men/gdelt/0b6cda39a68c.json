He knows how the fans want to feel.\n‘He tried to show us every single moment, he tried to talk us to understand in moments and say ‘everyone is against us’, so I think we feel more together.’\nManchester United beat rivals Manchester City in their first game under Carrick and followed that impressive win up with another three points against title favourites Arsenal.\nCarrick, who was put in charge shortly after Ruben Amorim’s sacking, said: ‘It was a good day. I think we had to put a lot into that game, an awful lot.\n‘Credit to the boys, so proud of them. We had to sustain some attacks, especially earlier on and we grew into the game.\nMore Trending\n‘We had a setback, come back strong, had a setback towards the end, come back strong. So many elements to the game that were good.\n‘We’re so fresh whether it’s 10 days in, two games, it’s never going to be perfect at this stage, especially coming against a team like Arsenal, but there were so many positives to take and we’ll keep adding to it in days and weeks to come.\n‘The boys have been fantastic in terms of taking things on, wanting to do it and investing into it. You can see what it means to them at the end.\n‘I’m really proud of them today, it’s obvious to say but it’s a tough place to come. Especially with the way the game flowed we stick at it and fantastic feeling at the end.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Roy Keane ‘can’t believe’ Arsenal suffered with one problem in Man Utd loss\nMORE: Rio Ferdinand criticises Mikel Arteta and Arsenal forward after Man Utd defeat\nMORE: Patrick Vieira names two Arsenal stars who ‘didn’t produce enough’ against Manchester United",
