  "body_text": "This is the biggest issue holding Newcastle United back\nWe wanted to get a snapshot of how Newcastle United fans are thinking.\nThree months into the season and 17 matches played so far across three competitions.\nNow in the November international break and Newcastle United fans seeing their team win eight games, draw three, lose six.\nThose results summing up a start to the season with plenty of ups and downs.\nPlenty to talk about as we ask a number of Newcastle United fans, who are regular/irregular contributors to The Mag, to give us their views on the season so far, plus what will happen as we move forward.\nNext up is GToon answering the questions.\nThree words to describe how you currently feel as a Newcastle fan?\nHopeful, resigned, angry\nThree words to describe Newcastle United now?\nUnderperforming, tired, aimless\nAlexander Isak – Time to forgive and forget…?\nI was genuinely amazed at his attitude towards us and his longing for a move to that club.\nI really don’t think he understands he played with 10 other players and the team was set up to create chances for him. He’s a very good player but he isn’t particularly strong or injury free and I don’t think he’ll fulfil his particular dreams at that club.\nEkitike is by far the better player and every time I watch him I just wish we’d sold Isak sooner and bought him instead.\nIf you had to choose. A win against Sunderland but lose to Fulham in Carabao Cup quarter-final, or lose to Sunderland and go through to Carabao Cup semi-finals?\nBeat them. We’ll beat Fulham too. Playing that lot are our biggest games this season. We must win.\nWould winning the Carabao Cup again this season BUT finishing outside the Premier League top six, be success or failure?\nAll things considered I think that would be fine.\nThe top six is just about money.\nThe most important thing for us is a bigger ground.\nEverything else will fall into place once that happens. Once the revenue starts flowing we will be able to compete regardless of league position- just like manyoo.\nHand on heart, what is your best estimate (not hope!) of where Newcastle United will end up this season in the Premier League, the Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup, how well they will realistically do in each of them?\nEPL – I expect a decent run once that Wissa sorts himself out. I’d say 6th.\nChampions league- last 8 and then knocked out controversially.\nFA Cup – knocked out in 3rd round.\nLeague Cup – winners !!! Yeah, I reckon we’ll win it again.\nIn order, which six NUFC players have been the most impressive so far this 2025/26 season?\nWoltemade – absolute class from big Nick. He’s proved to be a real top class player. He’s gonna be a star for us.\nThiaw – a real football playing defender, just like Schar\nBruno, Bruno, Bruno! Leader, captain, loony!\nBurn – gives everything no matter what is asked of him. What a header !!\nTonali – even when he’s poorly he’s still amazing. The best player we have.\nMurphy- the supply line\nIn order, by the end of the 2025/26 season, which six NUFC players do you think will have proved the top performers?\nWoltemade, Tonali, Hall, Thiaw, Ramsdale, Bruno\nEight months ago, Eddie Howe banked the first trophy for Newcastle in 56 years, then two months later secured a second Champions League qualification in three years. Some Newcastle fans appear to be questioning his position now. What are your thoughts on Eddie Howe and how much more time has he earned to get the league position sorted and beyond that, or not?\nOver the past few seasons I have been critical of Eddie and have posed questions about if he can adapt, if he can learn and improve. The tactical change that brought us the League Cup was a masterpiece. It answered every question. He totally outthought the league champions elect.\nOnce again Eddie has been given a difficult start to the season due to things out of his control. I back him to do well this season but I’d just like him to be a bit more ruthless with underperforming players now and again.\nWhat do you think about how the summer transfer window was conducted by Newcastle United?\nIt went from awful to desperate to ok. TBH the jury is still out as we haven’t seen Wissa play yet and that needs to happen ASAP!\nThiaw and Big Nick have really impressed. Ramsey and Ramsdale need a chance and Elanga needs to relax a bit. I’d love to see Elanga get paired up with Nick a bit like Shearer and Bellamy. Be nice to see us ditch the 433 now and again tbh.\nHow much do you think Newcastle United having no CEO or Sporting Director contributed to the fact NUFC signed only one player (Elanga) who had a proper pre-season?\nIt was a huge impact. Eddie can’t do everything. We needed these positions to be filled to function properly in the modern game. Cloughie wanted to do it all but I don’t think Eddie does. He’s a coach and manger, not a board member.\nIn the future after they have all finished their Newcastle United careers, what is your guesstimate on how the six summer signings will each be assessed. In each case – Thiaw, Ramsdale, Ramsey, Woltemade, Elanga and Wissa to be seen as one of these three choices – A success, Done OK, Failure.\nI think each one will be a success. They are all very good players and will get their chance at some point. I hope Ramsdale gets a run of games and hopefully Wissa doesn’t go to the AFCON. Is that why Eddie says he needs a pre-season? Maybe it’s to suggest he won’t be ready to go.\nWhat do you see as three positive things for Newcastle United so far this season?\nWoltemade is a huge positive and so is Thiaw. The cup games have been very positive, with some dominating performances. The support from Wor Flags has been great too.\nWhat do you see as three negative things for Newcastle United so far this season?\nPlaying BDB at left back and leaving him on when he’s struggling. Pope insisting on punching the ball when he could catch it. Playing players who aren’t 100% fit.\nWhat would represent success in the 2025/26 season for Newcastle United?\nA cup final win and a performance in the league that equals the sum of the parts. And beating the SMBs twice and liVARpool away.\nWhat do you see as the minimum to achieve this coming season?\nA top six finish but mainly for performances to match the squad we now have. I don’t expect us to win every game but I certainly expect better results and performances against the “other 14”.\nPredict the top six in the Premier League (in order) and which three clubs will be relegated.\nMan Citeh 115\nArsenal interest free shareholder loan\nChelsea corruption\nLiVARpool added time\nManyoo sack the tea lady\nNewcastle\nWith NUFC now having won a trophy…has that changed your priorities at all with the club now balancing getting Champions League football on a regular basis, compared to try and win cups?\nWinning something was simply amazing.\nThe league and champions league are just about money but seeing us win one, standing with my son as the bus went past with the trophy, was simply incredible.\nNext three seasons, would you rather finish top four all three seasons BUT win nothing, or finish mid-table all three seasons AND win the FA Cup in one of the three?\nFinish top four as that would imply we’d played well in the league and been good to watch, which we aren’t this season. We’ve been mid-table or worse for years. Let’s see a change.\nWhat are your thoughts on the fact that we are now more than four years after the takeover and still no plans announced on a new training ground, nor a far bigger capacity stadium (either brand new one, or an increased capacity St James’ Park)?\nThis is the biggest issue holding Newcastle United back.\nThe new ground of 75/80k would be a life changing moment for the club and for all of us. I might be able to go again! I can’t understand the lack of progress off the pitch.\nIf Newcastle United were to look to the transfer market to strengthen the team/squad in January, what do you see as the priority (or priorities…)?\nStart from the back. Buy a top class keeper or invest in Ramsdale, as he could be that player. Make a decision on mad man Osula. Either sell him and buy a new emerging talent, or give him a proper chance. A goal scoring midfielder would be decent too, a creative number 10 or give Barnes a chance there.\nWould you say winning the Carabao Cup last season has made you more content, or now more desperate to get the next one?\nI think it filled a bucket list number but I’d love to see us become serial winners like other clubs.\nThere’s no reason why not. I know it’s what Eddie wants too. If he stays for another 10 years we could do that.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
