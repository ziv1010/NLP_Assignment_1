Those achievements will remain an important part of the Club’s recent history, and we thank him for his contributions to the Club.\n‘With key objectives still to play for across four competitions including qualification for Champions League football, Enzo and the Club believe a change gives the team the best chance of getting the season back on track.\n‘We wish Enzo well for the future.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nImmediately becoming favourite to replace Maresca is Rosenior, who is in charge of Strasbourg, a club also owned by Chelsea chiefs BlueCo.\nIt would, therefore, be a very easy process to appoint the Englishman at Stamford Bridge, despite being under contract at Strasbourg until 2028.\nThe 41-year-old spoke earlier this year of his desire to manage in the Premier League at some point in his career, while he also was happy to say he would love to take charge of England one day.\nSpeaking to The Athletic in October 2025, Rosenior said: ‘My end goal, my destination, I have no idea. Obviously, I would love to one day work back in the Premier League, but when that comes, I have no idea.\n‘I would love to manage my country, I’d love to manage England one day. I’m not saying I’m going to, but these are all things I’d love to do and experience. But I know I won’t get there if I don’t do the job now and my focus is on this group of players and this club.’\n‘My hero in life…’\nRosenior has also revealed that he has always been a fan of Manchester United, with Alex Ferguson is hero.\nWhen he took his Strasbourg team to Ferguson’s former club Aberdeen in the Europa Conference League this season, he said: ‘This is a big thing for me. My hero in life, Sir Alex Ferguson, if you understand the history of what he achieved here.\n‘I was a Manchester United fan from birth so I walk up the stairs and I see all of the pictures at this stadium, it gives me goosebumps to be a manager here myself.\n‘Aberdeen is a huge club historically and it is an absolute privilege to be able to manage here tomorrow night.’\nRosenior’s coaching career\nHis playing career ended at Brighton in 2018 but he stayed on with the Seagulls, coaching the under-23 side.\nHe moved to Derby County as first team coach in 2019 and when Wayne Rooney became the boss in 2021, Rosenior stepped up to assistant manager.\nAfter Rooney’s departure in 2022, Rosenior was briefly interim manager.\nHis first top job was at Hull City, taking over in November 2022 and surprisingly being sacked at the end of the 2023/24 season despite finishing seventh in the Championship. The season before he took over, the Tigers finished 19th.\nMore Trending\nRosenior moved to France to take over at Strasbourg in July 2024, replacing Patrick Vieira, and finishing seventh in his first season. An improvement from 13th the year before.\nWho did Liam Rosenior play for?\nThe London-born full-back started professionally at Bristol City in 2002, before playing for Fulham and Reading, with loan spells at Torquay and Ipswich.\nHe made the most appearances of his career for Hull, before ending his playing days at Brighton.\nThe defender was capped for England at Under-21 level.\nMORE: I snubbed Manchester United transfer – and then became a legend at Liverpool\nMORE: Premier League club shortlist two Chelsea stars for January transfers\nMORE: Man Utd handed transfer boost ahead of January window as £38m sale a ‘formality’",
