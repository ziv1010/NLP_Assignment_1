You were knackered. Bankrupt.\nEach time you went around the board, you were just one roll of the dice away from potential disaster. If you landed on a Mayfair or Park Lane with a hotel on, you were out of the game.\nWhich bring me to Newcastle United Monopoly in the present day.\nEddie Howe and NUFC are the equivalent of those of us playing Monopoly and having far less money than the opponents.\nOne false move in the transfer market and Newcastle United could be knackered, at least for some time to come.\nA few false moves and it could be damage done for years, maybe forever.\nThis is the inequality we are up against, when playing Newcastle United Monopoly against the Premier League ‘elite’.\nCompare us to say Man U and Chelsea.\nDue to the way the Premier League works(?) and is structured, Newcastle United at a massive disadvantage as things stand.\nWith the finances that they have and their ability to keep spending massive amounts of money season after season, they can make countless mistakes in the transfer market and yet, the following season just come back and do the same again.\nSo many players bought at those two clubs for £40m, £50m, £60m, for even higher figures, yet hardly contribute, or indeed, even play.\nWith Newcastle United, you have a young raw inexperienced one for the future striker such as Will Osula bought in for an initial £10m, yet amongst parts of the NUFC fanbase there is outrage as to why he isn’t then playing, talk of money wasted and so on. Whilst say at Man U you have Antony and Mount recruited for around a combined £150m and they struggle to ever get a place in the team. Never mind live up to those transfer fees.\nWhilst as an excellent article on The Mag on Friday pointed out, Maresca played a full Chelsea reserve team in Europe on Thursday, changing all eleven players who started in the Premier League against Liverpool. All eleven players in this Chelsea reserve side having been bought by the current Chelsea owners these past 28 months, at a total cost of £487m! These are just eleven of the countless signings made by Chelsea these past 28 months (plus many others bought before then) who can’t get into the Chelsea side.\nMeanwhile, just those eleven Chelsea reserves cost far more than the entire Newcastle United squad!\nAs I say, in this Newcastle United Monopoly scenario, we are the ones who every time we go around the board, are just one false move away from disaster.\nSummer 2023 the big star signing to help NUFC cope with the demands of Champions League football and trying to repeat a top four Premier League place was Sandro Tonali recruited for £50m+. Only Alexander Isak has ever cost Newcastle United more in their entire history. That kind of transfer fee is just the norm, or even low, for so many of the Chelsea and Man U signings.\nTonali getting that 10 months suspension was an absolute disaster for last season.\nImagine if Sandro Tonali ended up a total flop and wasn’t even good enough to play, ended up leaving for peanuts, or even having to be paid to go. That would be a huge disaster for Newcastle United, the money we are allowed to spend as a club means NUFC can’t just go out and buy another Sandro Tonali. The likes of Man U, Chelsea and certain others can.\nI think as well that Newcastle United fans have been spoilt by how brilliant Eddie Howe has been proved to be when spending the club’s relatively limited money, not a single major expensive mistake.\nThe quality of Isak, Gordon, Bruno, Trippier, Pope, Burn, Livramento, Tonali, Hall, Botman, Barnes…\nJust think of where Man U would be now, if over the last three years they’d had somebody like Eddie Howe choosing who to spend their vast fortunes on. Same with Chelsea.\nNone of us know for sure what really happened with Marc Guehi and him not signing for Newcastle United this past summer.\nWhat I do know though is plenty of Newcastle United fans were just demanding that NUFC had to buy more players in that summer window, whoever they were.\nThis is just toddler tantrum time in my opinion, like a toddler demanding that they MUST have this particular toy and no, certainly no waiting until the right one comes along. Toddler gets this substandard toy for instant gratification but then swiftly realises it is rubbish. Then mam and/or dad don’t have any money to replace it with something better that is now available.\nThis is Newcastle United.\nIf Eddie Howe and the club hierarchy decided this summer that the right player(s) at the right price(s) weren’t available, then I am more than happy that the finite amount of money available to spend, has been kept for this coming January window, or even next summer.\nAs things stand, the ability of Newcastle United to spend money on signings is massively constrained by PSR, so we can’t afford very expensive transfer mistakes that could potentially set the team/club back years.\nWe have to make every bullet count, whilst faced with the relative machine guns that many of our competitors have available.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
