  "body_text": "“Griezmann is as bad as toothache,” said one of the mystery messages that appeared in prime locations in Spain’s two biggest cities last week, including on a huge building on Madrid’s Gran Via thoroughfare and on trams and press kiosks in Barcelona.\nIt was no coincidence the banners materialised just as Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann was about to make his first return to former club Barcelona in Sunday afternoon’s La Liga meeting.\nAdvertisement\nThe France international, 32, has hit excellent form recently after a difficult struggle in his first season back at Atletico and a weird lack of playing time during the first months of the present term.\nThe Athletic soon learnt that the cryptic messages were not an attack towards the player, but part of an advertising campaign for one of his many commercial partners.\nSo it was not a retort from fans and pundits who never really accepted Griezmann’s €120million (£105.9m; $131.7m) arrival at Camp Nou in summer 2019, seeing him as another of former president Josep Maria Bartomeu’s big-money flop signings.\nThough the sentiment might have caused some awkwardness for those around Atletico, who made his return ‘home’ so difficult at first.\nGriezmann had been a hero for all Atletico fans and very popular in the dressing room before he blew all that up by moving to Barca in 2019.\nThe tension when he returned on loan two years later is clear in ‘Another Way of Living: Atletico de Madrid’, a club-produced documentary telling the story of their 2021-22 season. “Some people are still not happy with my presence here,” Griezmann said. “I’m in the process of making people fall in love with me again.”\nThat process did not go smoothly amid injury setbacks and problems finding his form. He scored just three La Liga goals all year and was not happy with his contribution. Any chance of hitting the ground running in 2022-23 was hampered by the club hierarchy encouraging coach Diego Simeone to only use him for 30 minutes in any game as leverage to reduce the €40m fee that had been agreed with Barca to make his loan move permanent.\nThat worked for Atletico from a financial point of view, as the two clubs came to a compromise of a €20m fee in October, but not being able to call on one of their best players damaged the team’s results. They were out of the title race by the autumn and finished fourth in their Champions League group.\nAdvertisement\nIn mid-January, Atletico were eliminated from the Copa del Rey by city rivals Real Madrid and sat fifth in La Liga. The debate was now over whether Simeone’s time as coach might be coming to an end. Griezmann was also on a run of just one goal in 11 La Liga games.\nA very fortunate win at Celta Vigo in mid-February proved a turning point and Griezmann and his team began to hit form. Over the next five La Liga games, he scored in wins over Athletic Bilbao, Sevilla and Valencia and assisted an equaliser in a draw at Real Madrid.\nAfter two close-range strikes in last weekend’s 2-0 win over Almeria, he was asked whether he was now enjoying his club football again for the first time in years.\n“It’s true,” Griezmann replied. “When I came back here I knew I had to keep my head down and work hard. This year there was the contract issue, only playing 30 minutes, but I just wanted to be here. If you work hard, football pays you back. All the effort I put in is helping me now. I’m scoring goals, giving assists and enjoying myself a lot on the pitch and with the fans in the stadium.”\nA big factor is Griezmann being in better physical condition than at any point since he left Atletico in 2019. Two seasons under a less strenuous training regime at Barca did not suit him. On his return to fitness coach Oscar ‘el Profe’ Ortega’s famously demanding sessions last year, he kept picking up niggling injuries and never got to 100 per cent fitness over the season.\nNot completing a full 90 minutes for Atletico from April to October 2022 did not help either, then there was the World Cup in November and December. But now Griezmann is finally physically able again to do all he wants on the pitch and it is showing.\nThrough the last two months, Atletico have been the in-form team in La Liga, even ahead of champions-elect Barcelona. Simeone’s side went to Camp Nou on Sunday on a run of eight wins in nine games, scoring 18 times and conceding just four goals, with the only points dropped being the 1-1 draw at the Bernabeu in February (with 10 men). There were no doubts now that they would qualify for the Champions League or that Simeone would continue next season. The question was whether they might catch Real and finish second.\nAdvertisement\n“A lot of the change from two months ago (for Atletico) is down to Griezmann’s moment of form,” a source close to the rojiblanco dressing room told The Athletic, speaking anonymously to protect relationships, like all those cited in this story. “Griezmann is the most in-form player in La Liga at the moment — he moves the team and is its soul.”\nOthers close to Griezmann deny the idea that his upturn in form is down to any external motivations, such as Joao Felix leaving Atletico on loan for Chelsea in January or Kylian Mbappe being named France captain earlier this year when he thought he might get the armband.\n“The great mystery of Antoine, if there is one, is his tenacity,” said a source who knows him well. “It is very difficult to break or even bend him.”\nDuring Griezmann’s first five years at Atletico, he was voted onto the Ballon d’Or podium in 2016 and 2018. Still, the Frenchman believes he is now a better all-round performer.\n“I am now a more complete player, on the level of assists, general play, goals,” Griezmann said last week. “Before, Atletico’s style was more direct, getting the ball forward quickly, attacking the spaces. Now we have more players who like to link up and I’ve adapted to this. I’m very happy with my performances this year, but I’ve still not reached my limit.”\nThis is shown when we look at where Griezmann touched the ball during the final two years of his first Atletico stint compared to the past 18 months. During his final campaign before the 2019 move, more than half of his contributions came in the final third of the pitch. Since returning, he has spent more time in the middle.\nHis 2022-23 touch map shows he now covers almost every blade of grass. His contributions are spread pretty evenly all through the middle and top thirds of the pitch and also right across from one wing to the other. His favourite place to get on the ball is central and very deep for a player who is nominally a forward.\nGriezmann’s role as an extension of his boss on the pitch was demonstrated during a moment in last week’s Almeria game. Soon after he had opened the scoring, player and coach could be seen in deep conversation, even with the play continuing in another area of the pitch. After that game, The Athletic asked Griezmann what they had spoken about.\nAdvertisement\n“There are things that I see on the pitch,” he replied. “How to press. I could see they (Almeria) were bringing the ball out too easily. I spoke with (Simeone) about how we could fix it quickly. He knows that I owe him everything, him, el Profe Ortega, my team-mates, too. Without them, it is impossible to play at this level.”\nBeing Atletico’s main playmaker and leading the pressing of opposition defenders has not stopped Griezmann contributing in the final third. He has 11 goals and eight assists in La Liga so far in 2022-23.\nOnly Barca’s Robert Lewandowski has more (17 goals and six assists) over the season to date, although most of the Poland striker’s contributions came when Griezmann’s playing time was strictly limited. Madrid’s Karim Benzema is the only other player who comes close (14 goals and three assists).\nWhen at Barca, the presence of Lionel Messi arguably made it much more difficult for Griezmann to have such a huge impact on his team’s all-round play. During the 2020-21 season, his second and final year at Barcelona, he was taking 2.44 shots per 90 minutes but was finishing chances efficiently (13 goals from xG of 12.1).\nThis season, Griezmann’s roaming means he is generally positioned further from goal, but he is still taking a lot more shots (3.56 per game) and converting significantly more of them (11 goals from xG of 9.2).\nAtletico’s last defeat in La Liga before Sunday came in January’s 1-0 loss to Barcelona at the Metropolitano, when Griezmann was more muted than usual (48 touches, the second-fewest in a league game he’d started up to that point).\nHowever, he still managed seven shots, with two on target, but was unable to beat his former team-mate Marc-Andre ter Stegen. That was another frustration, and while he publicly denied having any extra motivation ahead of Sunday’s return, the determined and stubborn character was definitely keen to show what he could do.\nAdvertisement\nThere was no special reaction at Camp Nou when Griezmann’s name was read out pre-game; he just received the same jeers as his Atletico team-mates.\nThere was more noise in the stadium after only 43 seconds though, when Barca defender Marcos Alonso got in a muddle and the ball fell to Griezmann, who chipped Ter Stegen. The shot bounced down off the crossbar and away, bringing loud whistles that betrayed nervousness among the home crowd.\nAs the first half progressed, Atletico’s No 8 was the most influential player on the pitch, setting up breaks, intercepting attacks, taking set pieces at one end, heading them away at the other.\nHis moment appeared to have come just past the half-hour mark when he smashed a low, 10-yard shot goalwards, but Ter Stegen got down superbly to push the ball away. Moments later, Griezmann was back in his own box, nicking the ball from Gavi before the young Barca midfielder could line up a shot.\nAfter Ferran Torres put Barca ahead just before half-time, the game changed and Griezmann was less involved, but he still had a chance to equalise, flicking Alvaro Morata’s cross goalwards only for Ter Stegen to save again.\nGriezmann had three shots, two on target, but also made two interceptions, one tackle and one clearance. There was a foul on Barca defender Eric Garcia that brought a late yellow card — a sign of his frustration at how things had gone. He finished the game with 48 touches (again!).\nHad the shot in the first minute been inches lower, Griezmann would have had his first-ever goal as an opposition player at Camp Nou. Or, if Ter Stegen had not made two spectacular saves, Atletico might have got something.\nBut even though it was not enough to get a result at Barca, Griezmann’s upswing in form has clearly made him Atletico’s best and most important outfield player once again. That message hit home.\n(Top image: designed by Samuel Richardson; photos: Pierre-Philippe Marcou/AFP via Getty Images)",
