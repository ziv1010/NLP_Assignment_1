There’ll be a few new surprises and a few frights for good measure.”\nThe event, she said, is mainly aimed at children of primary school age, though older children and teenagers often join in too.\n“It’s really for the national school ages - up to fifth or sixth class,” Ann said. “But you’ll always have a few secondary school kids in it as well.”\nOrganisers are hoping for suitably spooky conditions on the evening.\n“It’ll be getting dark around seven, which adds to the atmosphere,” Ann said. “We’re even hoping to have some of the streetlights turned off along part of the route so that it’ll be properly dark in places.”\nAs in previous years, the walk will be followed by a spectacular fireworks display.\n“We’ll have the usual fireworks afterwards, which is scheduled for nine,” Ann said. “That’s always a big highlight for families.”\nThe event draws huge crowds every year, with visitors coming from across Mayo and beyond.\n“We got a huge turnout last year - we were actually surprised ourselves by the numbers,” Ann said. “People really love it, and hopefully they’ll come again this year.”\nParents are encouraged to accompany their children, and the walk operates on a voluntary contribution basis.\n“We just ask for a small contribution again this year,” Ann said, adding that details would be finalised at an upcoming committee meeting.\nThe Tourism Festival group have reminded everyone to follow the directions of stewards and observe safety guidelines on the night.\n“It’s all about having fun safely,” Ann said. “And of course, we’d love to see plenty of witches, zombies and ghosts out there - maybe the kids can even scare a few of them away themselves!”\nWith a mix of community spirit, spooky fun, and fireworks to finish, Kiltimagh’s Spooky Walk promises another memorable night for all the family.\nAs part of Climate Action Week, which takes place from October 10 to 19, a special event will take place in Kiltimagh on Saturday next, October 18, to launch Phase 2 of the ‘Community Climate Action Programme’.
