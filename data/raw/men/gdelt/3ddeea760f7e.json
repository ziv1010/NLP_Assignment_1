It must be fought and punished.”\nFofana, a 24-year-old Marseille native, used his Instagram stories to highlight the messages he was sent on the platform after Sunday’s 1-0 loss at Emirates Stadium. They included racist words and monkey emojis.\nChelsea said it was “appalled and disgusted” by the rise in online abuse toward its players.\nFofana started the match and was substituted after 86 minutes.\nFrance captain Kylian Mbappé said he is worried things are not changing in soccer when it comes to such abuse.\n“Unfortunately, we are turning around in circles because nothing is moving forward. Nothing is changing,” Mbappé said Wednesday at a pre-match news conference ahead of France’s Nations League quarterfinal against Croatia. “It’s hard to tell yourself that in 2025 we are going back to square one each time.”\nMbappé said the whole France team was behind Fofana.\n“I haven’t had Wesley on the phone yet, but what I can tell him is that I support him and so does all the team,” he said. “We are all with him during this difficult period. They are not just words. If he needs anything we are here for him.”\n___\nOpenly gay soccer player still faces online death threats\nADELAIDE, Australia (AP) — The first openly gay man to play in Australia’s domestic soccer league says he’s still subject to death threats four years after going public about his sexuality.\nJosh Cavallo, who plays for Adelaide United in the A-League, told the FIFPro Footballers Unfiltered podcast that “in a world of football, being a gay ... player is a very toxic place.”\n“I still think we’re a very, very long way from being accepted in this space, unfortunately,” he said.\nCavallo was 21 in 2021 when he decided to come out, acknowledging his video message “took the world of football for a shock.” He still regards it as “the best move and decision” he’s made, but warns that there’s “mountains of downside.”\nIn the podcast, he asked rhetorically: “Why has no one ever come out to be themselves and be successful and play?”\n“And I understand that now looking back — all the negativity, all the things that come your way, there’s multiple, multiple, multiple death threats that come my way daily, still, and it’s quite sad to see.”\nCavallo didn’t detail the online threats. He continues to train and play as a professional footballer every week.\n“I have a very strong support network, I have my good days, I have my bad days, but I’m free,” he said. “I go to bed, I put my head on the pillow and I’m happy. I’m Josh Cavallo, I’m the footballer ... the gay footballer, and I’m super proud to say that.”\nCavallo told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. on Wednesday that he still has positive experiences of meeting people who tell him they’ve been encouraged and inspired by his advocacy.\nIn his “everyday life,” he said, people had approached him and “know who I am and speak to me and say how I guided them and how I give them the courage to come out at school.”\n“On the other side,” he added, “opening my social media this morning, it was quite disturbing reading the comments that got sent my way.”\nHe said when his club published a video of his announcement in 2021 it changed perspectives around the world, but there’s still a long way to go for the sport to help remove the fear of public backlash for other players coming out.\n“It’s obviously . . . influenced a lot of people and made so much progression within the game,” he said of his life story, “and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.”\nIn 2022, he reported homophobic abuse during a game and he said it continues on social media.\n“I don’t really like to show this side of things because I feel like it’s going to put fear into people who are thinking about coming out,” he told the ABC. “What I did in 2021 was fantastic and great for myself and for the wider LGBTQ+ community, but ... we’re four years on now and we’re still getting (homophobic abuse) on a daily” basis.\nPeter Malinauskas, premier of South Australia state where the Adelaide United club is based, said the vitriol Cavallo has faced is “beyond awful — it’s unacceptable.”\n“It speaks to a degree of cowardice that we know that exists in the community,” he said, adding that Cavallo deserved “a lot of credit for his courage.”\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.",
