He has a different personality but I think he is really smart to understand what is needed to go further.\n“He looks at what type of specific profile he needs to progress – technical, physical. You don’t always find the same profile with every player – he has own characteristics but I think they fit well with the demands of the Premier League.\n“At the same time, though, you have to have the mentality to learn and be aware of what the characteristics of your environment are and what you need to do to improve. What can I do to get better? What advice do I need to take from other members of the team?\n“He has this combination of talent on one side, then on the other side, the ability to learn.”\nMan Utd interest\nOur transfer insider Graeme Bailey recently confirmed that Manchester United are paying close attention to Sadiki, as Old Trafford sources confirm he has been under their watch since well before his move to England last summer.\nAs we have continually stated, United manager Ruben Amorim views strengthening in midfield as his top priority in the coming transfer windows.\nCasemiro is out of contract at the end of the 2025/26 season and would have to agree to a sizeable cut in salary if he’s going to stay at Old Trafford, with his current deal worth a base salary of £350,000-per-week.\nKobbie Mainoo is looking to leave in search of regular first-team football, while Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte have also been linked with moves away.\nBut United will face major obstacles in their pursuit of all three midfielders.\nBaleba is valued at over £100million, Anderson is attracting interest from Manchester City and a move for Wharton may depend on whether Champions League football is achieved.\n“When he was at Blackburn we sat down and spoke about shooting for the stars and playing for England,” Wharton’s agent told talkSPORT.\n“So how do you get there? Personally I think to play for England you have to play Champions League, to play in the Champions League you have got to play for one of the top teams in one of the top leagues.”\nUnited will have to look at potential alternatives and Sadiki would be a shrewd signing for Amorim’s side.\nSadiki vs Newcastle\nSadiki started alongside Granit Xhaka in the middle of the park and played a key role in the 1-0 win over Newcastle, which came via an own goal from Nick Woltemade.\nHis relentless work ethic and tireless pressing brought an infectious energy to Le Bris’ side, making it a difficult afternoon for Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimaraes and Lewis Miley.\n“Sunderland fans say 70 per cent of the earth’s surface is covered by water and the other 30 per cent by Noah Sadiki,” commentator Peter Drury said on Sky Sports.\nThe 20-year-old had 49 touches, completed 32 of his 39 passes at a success rate of 82 per cent and made five passes into the final third. He also completed two successful dribbles, more than any other player on the pitch.\nIn terms of defensive work, Sadiki made one tackle, two interceptions and four recoveries against Newcastle while winning three of his four ground duels.\nFollowing the game, The Chronicle Live did their player ratings and said: “[Sadiki] went about his usual job and gave Newcastle no time to breathe in the middle of the pitch.”\nSunderland site Roker Report gave him a 9/10 and added: “[Sadiki] was absolutely everywhere hassling the opposition, made himself a real nuisance all over the pitch.”\nHis performance against Newcastle also led to a lot of praise from fans on social media.\nOn Reddit, one Manchester United fan said: “They got [N’Golo] Kante lite in Sadiki.”\nOn X, another said: “FAO Man Utd. Sign Noah Sadiki at all costs. Absolute gem of a player.”\nOne suggested: “Sadiki would be a really good Baleba alternative.”\nThe DR Congo international is now set to represent his country at the Africa Cup of Nations and it wouldn’t be surprising if United scouts followed his progress at the tournament.\nREAD MORE: The 10 Erik ten Hag signings still at Man Utd and when they could leave",
