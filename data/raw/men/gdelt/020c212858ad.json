But that is all about to change.\nEnglish clubs were informed in May that the official transfer deadline for this summer’s window would be brought forward four hours, from 11pm UK (6pm ET, 3pm PT) to 7pm UK (2pm ET, 11am PT), on Monday, September 1. Teams were told they would need to adjust accordingly to ensure they do not miss out on completing any late deals.\nAdvertisement\nBar getting club staff home at a more civilised hour and, hopefully, eliminating a great deal of late-night stress, what exactly does this mean, and why has the change been made?\nFollow live coverage of transfer deadline day today\nWhat usually happens?\nThe 2025 summer transfer window has seen some unprecedented change from previous years, not least because there have been two of them.\nThe inaugural edition of the expanded Club World Cup meant an additional trading period was scheduled. This spanned the first 10 days of June, and allowed the tournament’s 32 competing teams to add to their squads ahead of the games beginning on June 14. But clubs not involved in the event in the United States also concluded deals in that period, as Manchester United did when they moved for Wolverhampton Wanderers forward Matheus Cunha.\nThe window then reopened on June 16, and will shut later today. This is due to world football governing body FIFA ruling that a transfer window is not allowed to exceed a total of 89 days. In contrast, last year’s summer transfer window ran from June 14 to August 30, with a deadline of 11pm UK.\nSome moves do get concluded beyond that point: for example, the season-long loans that took Chelsea’s Raheem Sterling to Arsenal and Jadon Sancho of Manchester United to Chelsea. These are completed via a document called a ‘deal sheet’, which has to be submitted two hours before the deadline and allows clubs a two-hour cushion to finalise terms beyond the window closing.\nWhy is the window shutting earlier this year?\nThe change to bring forward the transfer deadline was one agreed by the Football Association (FA), the Premier League and the English Football League (EFL).\nTheir main reasoning for doing so was to provide staff working across the country’s football clubs on deadline day with a more normal working pattern. The aforementioned deal sheets would often see people still toiling away well beyond midnight in order to get late business over the line.\nAdvertisement\nClosing the window at 7pm means that, should a deal sheet be submitted by a club this evening, they will have until 9pm to file the necessary paperwork for that transfer to go through.\nIs it the same across the major European leagues?\nYes. The ‘Big Five’ top divisions across Europe will all see their transfer windows close today. The Premier League (and the three EFL divisions below it), Germany’s Bundesliga, Serie A in Italy and France’s Ligue 1 have until 7pm UK time (8pm CET). Spain’s La Liga is a slight exception, with deals allowed up to 11.59pm local time (10.59pm BST).\nOf course, players could still leave their clubs beyond these deadlines should they receive an offer from a team in a country where the window remains open after this evening…\nWill this benefit or be difficult for clubs?\nIn theory, a 7pm deadline across much of Europe should allow all clubs to facilitate their late transfer dealings with a mutual understanding of when they need to conclude negotiations. Should there be an instance of more than one suitor for a player, it would mean neither would have an advantage over the other from a timeframe standpoint alone.\nIt may not be that straightforward, however. With La Liga’s window remaining open for a further four hours, harmonisation is not quite there between all the top European leagues. In the event of any late outgoings to Spain, or indeed other leagues whose windows stretch beyond September 1, those with a 7pm deadline today will not be granted the time to react with any last-minute reinforcements.\nIt remains to be seen whether that will mean some clubs keep hold of players they would otherwise have allowed to leave in the final hours of the window, just to ensure they have the numbers in the squad and are not left with any gaps they cannot plug. As such, it is hard to imagine La Liga clubs will be bringing in too many signings from the Premier League, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 in the final four hours of their transfer window, unless their targets are surplus to requirements.\nAdvertisement\nWhich leagues’ windows will still be open after today?\nDutch clubs have an extra couple of days over many European leagues with a deadline of 11.59pm on Tuesday, September 2. Turkey has become an increasingly common destination for players across Europe, and Super Lig sides can continue to operate in the market until Friday, September 12, which is also deadline day in Mexican football. Portuguese teams have that weekend to get signings done before the window there closes on Monday, September 15. Saudi Arabian sides will no doubt continue to target some of the biggest names in Europe, and will be permitted to continue doing so until Tuesday, September 23.\nIn the women’s game, teams in the England-based Women’s Super League (WSL) can continue to work in the transfer market until Thursday, September 4, with the opening game of its 2025-26 season not coming until a day later. This deadline remains set at 11pm.\nWhich deals could still happen?\nAlexander Isak’s desired move away from Newcastle United has been the biggest transfer story of the summer, but now looks to be happening after Liverpool agreed a deal for the striker late on Sunday. Striker Isak attempted to force an exit with a social media statement claiming “promises” had been “broken” by Newcastle and “the relationship can’t continue”. Liverpool previously failed with a £110million ($147m at current rates) offer for the Sweden international on August 1.\nArsenal are close to completing the signing of Bayer Leverkusen defender Piero Hincapie. The Athletic reported on Sunday that the Ecuador international was travelling to London from Germany but still awaiting permission to undergo a medical as the clubs worked to finalise the proposed transfer. Marc Guehi is another who has had an uncertain future in the final days of this transfer window. The Athletic reported on Saturday that Liverpool made a £35m offer to Crystal Palace for Guehi, while Palace manager Oliver Glasner says there is no deal in place for the England international to be sold.\nManchester United have agreed a deal to loan striker Rasmus Hojlund to Napoli for the rest of the season, which includes a conditional obligation to make the move permanent for €44million (£38.2m; $51.1m) that would be activated by the Italian club qualifying for the 2026-27 Champions League. A fee has also been agreed in principle for Real Betis of Spain to buy United winger Antony, standing at €25m, with a further €3m in potential add-ons, but the transfer is in the balance amid tension over how to settle the proposed multi-million pound salary reduction the Brazilian, who was on loan at Betis for the second half of last season, will face when leaving Old Trafford.\nChelsea striker Nicolas Jackson had looked set for a season-long loan to Bayern Munich until team-mate Liam Delap’s weekend hamstring injury derailed that move. The Stamford Bridge side are looking at possible additions at their position in case Jackson ends up leaving permanently instead.\nBrentford forward Yoane Wissa has also been seeking a conclusion to his own transfer saga. The 28-year-old posted a message on social media on Sunday morning outlining his desire to leave the west London club and belief they have “significantly changed” their stance after he said they previously agreed to let him leave if a reasonable offer was received. The Athletic reported on August 20 that Brentford had turned down a Newcastle bid worth £35million plus a potential £5m more in difficult-to-achieve add-ons, after rejecting their £25m offer in July.\n(Top photo of Nicolas Jackson: Stuart Franklin/Getty Images)",
