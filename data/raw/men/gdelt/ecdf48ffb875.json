  "body_text": "Manchester United supporters are brimming with pre-season optimism, so how long will that last, as they seek to improve on their lowest finish since being relegated in 1974.\nWhat are Manchester United's confirmed transfers?\nManchester United's arrivals\n- Bryan Mbeumo: Brentford - £71 million.\n- Matheus Cunha: Wolverhampton Wanderers - £62.5 million.\n- Benjamin Šeško: RB Leipzig - £74 million\n- Diego León: Cerro Porteño - £6 million.\nManchester United's departures\n- Marcus Rashford: Barcelona - loan + €35 million option to buy.\n- Christian Eriksen: free agent.\n- Victor Lindelöf: Bayer Leverkusen - free transfer.\n- Jonny Evans: retired\nPleased note: all information is correct as of the date of publication.\nWhat happened at Manchester United last season?\nFair to say, last season was a total disaster for Manchester United. When Erik ten Hag was sacked in last-October, they'd collected 11 points from nine fixtures. Well, from 27 Premier League matches in charge, his successor Rúben Amorim collected exactly 27 points, suffering 14 league defeats as the Red Devils finished 15th, a whopping 24 points adrift the Champions League positions.\nMan United were given a second change to save their season via the Europa League, getting all the way to the final, memorably pulling of an astonishing comeback against Olympique Lyonnais in the quarter-finals, scoring three times in seven extra time minutes. However, in the final itself in Bilbao, they rarely threatened all night as they were beaten 1-0 by Spurs, thanks to a Luke Shaw own goal.\nSo, Amorim and his team will have no European football to contend with, hoping the only way is up.\nHow will Manchester United do this season?\nAs already alluded to, there's plenty of pre-season optimism at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have certainly added goals to their squad. The three new recruits, Benjamin Šeško, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, costing a combined £210m, scored 21, 17 and 20 goals last season, which is more than Manchester United as a club managed last time round.\nThis is certainly an exciting new front three, although there are other areas of the team that need addressing, including goalkeeper; an injury to André Onana means Altay Bayındır will begin as the number one. Without European competition, Manchester United's league position will surely improve, but it remains to be seen if they'll be able to compete with the division's very best.\nWhat is our predicted Premier League finish for Manchester United?\n- Our predicted finish for Manchester United in the Premier League this season: 7th.\nWhat are Manchester United's first 6 Premier League fixtures?\n- Arsenal (H). Sunday 17 August. Kick off 16:30 (BST).\n- Fulham (A). Sunday 24 August. Kick off 16:30 (BST).\n- Burnley (H). Saturday 30 August. Kick off 15:00 (BST).\n- Manchester City (A). Sunday 14 September. Kick off 16:30 (BST).\n- Chelsea (H). Saturday 20 September. Kick off 17:30 (BST).\n- Brentford (A). Saturday 27 September. Kick off 12:30 (BST).\nWhat are some other key dates for Manchester United supporters?\n- 13 August: Carabao Cup second round draw - taking place around 22:30 (BST).\n- 1 September: The transfer window closes at 19:00 (BST).",
