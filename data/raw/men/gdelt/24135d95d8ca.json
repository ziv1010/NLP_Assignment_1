The game is being played on Saturday at 3pm, a time when football matches cannot legally be broadcast in the UK. This is known as the '3pm 'blackout''.\nThe irony is you can watch the game in pretty much every country other than the one in which it's being played.

Peacock plans start from $10.99 a month or you can go ad-free for $16.99 a month, and you'll make a decent saving if you sign up for a year.\nIs there a Wolves vs Crystal Palace free live stream?\nThere are no dedicated free-to-air broadcasters showing the game but you may be able to watch Wolves vs Crystal Palace by signing up for a free trial.\nAmazon Prime Video is currently offering a seven-day free trial of Peacock Premium Plus for users in the US. You can sign up, watch the game, and cancel if you don't think you'll get any lasting value from the offering.\nHow to watch Wolves vs Crystal Palace in Australia\nPremier League fans in Australia can watch Wolves vs Crystal Palace through Stan Sport.\nWatch the Premier League on Stan Sport\nStan Sport is the new Optus Sport – home to every single Premier League and Champions League live stream.

A Virtual Private Network helps you get around this problem by changing your IP address, making your laptop, tablet or smartphone appear to be in a different country. That means you can watch your usual streams, even when you’re a long way from home.\nThe tech experts at Tom's Guide review a lot of VPNs and right now they reckon NordVPN is the best VPN you can buy.

Vitor Pereira was shown the door barely a year on from winning supporters over with the personal touch, the inevitable consequence of a dreadful start in 2025-26.\nThe problems run deeper in the Black Country but staying in the division is imperative.

They always seem clinical against your team though, don't they?\nReports this week indicate that the Eagles have begun contract talks with striker Jean-Philippe Mateta.
