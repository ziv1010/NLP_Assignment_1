The things that this kid can do on a football pitch at his age are simply mind-blowing and, frankly, unbelievable.\nHe scored a brilliant goal against Elche which means he now has 23 goals in 91 LaLiga appearances. Those numbers mean he’s equalling the most by a player under the age of 19 in Europe’s top five leagues in the 21st century, previously set by Kylian Mbappé.\nYamal wasn’t finished there either as he went on to create a whole host of chances for his team-mates.\nThe teenager’s performance meant he walked off with another MVP award and praise from Alejandro Balde ringing in his ears: “Expectations for Lamine are very high. People forget he’s only 18. He’s having an incredible season.”",
