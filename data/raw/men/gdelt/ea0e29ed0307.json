  "body_text": "In true German fashion, Borussia Dortmund are opening a European (football) campaign with a trip across Belgium. Nuri Sahin and his men take on Club Brugge in Matchday 1 of this year’s newly formatted Champions League ‘league phase’. The match against Brugge is the first of eight league phase matches and Club Brugge represents one of two Pot Two teams that Dortmund will face this season. If the club wants to secure a guaranteed spot in the round of sixteen, three points are a must.\nMatch Preview: Dortmund Begin UCL Campaign Against Club Brugge\nThe campaign begins in Belgium!\nDespite the international break, Borussia Dortmund look to be in midseason form and will be heavily favored against the Belgian outfit. All players apart from Gio Reyna are fit and ready to play while Sahin’s new 4-2-3-1 formation looked lethal against Heidenheim on Friday. After last season’s disappointment in the final, Dortmund will be looking to shake off any remaining nerves and any trepidations regarding the new format. The club has started the Bundesliga campaign with a string of decent, but not great, results and will have to improve in the Champions League if they want another deep run towards the trophy.\nClub Brugge also finds themselves in good form and eager to kickstart the Champions League. The club was missing from Champions League football last season and was sliding down the domestic table when their current Coach, Nicky Haden, took the reigns after a stint with their youth team. Hayden turned the side around and lost only two matches with him in-charge last season, including a Conference League semi-final against Fiorentina. Club Bruge are now atop the Belgian league despite an uneasy start. Borussia Dortmund should be heavily favored but should be wary of an attacking contingent comprised of four players who notched twenty or more goal involvements last season.\nPlayer to Watch: Andreas Skov Olsen\nAs mentioned, Club Brugge has a variety of players in attack who can cause damage but Andreas Skov Olsen should be the one Dortmund are most fearful of. The left-footed winger has featured mainly on Club Brugge’s right wing and has an eye for goal. Olsen has notched three goals and one assist in seven domestic matches this season but contributed two assists in only seven minutes of play as Denmark beat Switzerland over the international break. The Dane likes to carry the ball down the line, run at defenders, and cut inside on his left foot. The left side of Dortmund’s defense has already looked to be the weak point in Sahin’s setup this season and the left-back will have to follow Olsen closely if Dortmund want to avoid a surprise result.\nPredicted Starting XI\nI am predicting few changes in Dortmund’s starting XI considering the three day rest between matches. Kobel will start in goal unless he has one of his famous injuries in warmup. There could be a shake up at the back with Ryerson, Schlotterbeck, Anton, and Couto featuring as the starting four considering Nico is available for this match and Couto might offer more going forward as Dortmund look to overwhelm the Belgians. I do not anticipate any changes with Gross, Nmecha, and Brandt forming the midfield trio but Sahin indicated that Sabitzer will start, likely in Malen’s place. Eyes will be on Adeyemi considering his string of form.\nPrediction: 3-1 Borussia Dortmund\nBorussia Dortmund should win this one and I expect them to score goals against a side that has already conceded six goals in the Belgian league. Brugge’s strength is in their attacking elements so I anticipate them scoring at least once.\nYour Thoughts\nLet us know what you predict!",
