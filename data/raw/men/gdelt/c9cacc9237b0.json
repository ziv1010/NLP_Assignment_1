We've got you covered. Chelsea vs Liverpool is on Sky Sports in the UK. Brit abroad? Use a VPN to watch the Premier League with your subscription from anywhere.\nChelsea welcome Liverpool to Stamford Bridge for the first heavyweight clash of the new Premier League season, and it's only opening day.\nThe Blues are desperate to get over the woes of last season, and a huge summer clear-out - and influx of new signings - could certainly help Mauricio Pochettino get the club back to winning ways and, perhaps, even a trophy.\nLiverpool also need to get over a disappointing campaign, with Jurgen Klopp making large strides to rebuild his midfield. Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, James Milner, Naby Keita, Roberto Firmino and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have all left, with Alexis Mac Allister and Dominic Szoboszlai joining.\nThey might still be a little light in that position, though, with the Reds attempting to add more stars to their squad before the transfer deadline.\nKick-off is at 4.30pm BST. Make sure you know how to watch the Premier League wherever you are.\nTeam news\nMauricio Pochettino has named the following Chelsea starting 11: (3-5-2) Robert Sanchez; Axel Disasi, Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill; Reece James (captain), Conor Gallagher, Enzo Fernandez, Carney Chukwuemeka, Ben Chilwell; Raheem Sterling, Nicolas Jackson\nJurgen Klopp has selected the following Liverpool starting 11: (4-3-3) Alisson; Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ibrahima Konate, Virgil van Dijk (captain), Andy Robertson; Dominik Szoboszlai, Alexis Mac Allister, Cody Gakpo; Mo Salah, Diogo Jota, Luis Diaz\nForm\nChelsea are looking to make a huge recovery this season under Mauricio Pochettino, after finishing 12th in the Premier League last time out. Pre-season has been promising, but that needs to be translated into the league.\nLiverpool are in a similar boat, though it's not quite as drastic. Jurgen Klopp's men finished fifth, meaning they'll be playing Europa League football this term. Liverpool are tipped to be in the mix for at least second place, too, if not the title.\nReferee\nAnthony Taylor will be the referee for Chelsea vs Liverpool. His assistants will be Gary Beswick and Adam Nunn, with David Coote the fourth official. Darren England is the VAR, with Simon Bennett the assistant VAR.\nStadium\nChelsea vs Liverpool will be played at the 40,343-capacity Stamford Bridge stadium in Fulham, London.\nKick-off and channel\nChelsea vs Liverpool kick-off is at 4.30pm BST on Sunday 13 August in the UK. The game is on Sky Sports Premier League and Sky Sports Main Event in the UK.\nIn the US, kick-off time is 11.30am ET / 8.30am PT. The match will be shown on NBC in the US. See below for international broadcast options.\nVPN guide\nUse a VPN to watch Premier League football from outside your country\nIf you’re out of the country for a Premier League fixture, then you won't be able to watch on your domestic streaming service as usual. The broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!) and blocks you from watching it. You can use a VPN to get around that, though, without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and will let you watch. And all the info going between is entirely encrypted, anonymous and safe – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there. For the Premier League, FourFourTwo currently recommends:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS5 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price. Go get it!\nInternational Premier League TV rights\n• UK: Sky Sports and TNT Sports are the two main players, but Amazon also have a slice of the pie in 2023/24.\n• USA: NBC Sports Group are the Premier League rights holders, with the Peacock Premium streaming platform showing all 380 games in the season. A fuboTV subscription also lets you watch every game.\n• Canada: The way to watch Premier League football in 2023/24 is fuboTV, which has exclusive rights to all the action.\n• Australia: Optus Sport will screen every game of the Premier League season.\n• New Zealand: Sky Sport are serving up all 380 games – plus various highlights and magazine shows throughout the week, as well as the Champions League.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nRyan is a staff writer for FourFourTwo, joining the team full-time in October 2022.
