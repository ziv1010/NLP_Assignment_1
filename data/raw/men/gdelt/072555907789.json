  "body_text": "Arsenal’s squad is strong and deep in almost every area, with only one concern for manager Mikel Arteta, believes Gary Neville.\nThe Gunners are now six points clear at the top of the Premier League table after a rousing 4-1 win over Tottenham on Sunday.\nA Leandro Trossard opener followed by an Ebere Eze hat-trick conjured up a memorable afternoon for the home side at the Emirates.\nArteta’s side were very impressive and that was with the likes of Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard, Viktor Gyokeres, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus all out injured.\nSuch is the strength of Arsenal’s squad, that even with those players out, Arteta still had impressive options including Myles Lewis-Skelly, Noni Madueke, Gabriel Martinelli and Ben White on the bench.\nNeville thinks the Gunners have two options in pretty much every area of the pitch, although says there is one irreplaceable player and an injury could derail their excellent season.\nThat man is Declan Rice, who Neville thinks brings a unique skillset to the team and Arteta will be desperate to keep fit.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘The interesting thing is they’ve got [Riccardo] Calafiori and [Jurrien] Timber at full-back. Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ben White are probably better going forward, although there’s not much between White and Timber,’ he said on the Gary Neville Podcast. ‘They’ve got real options at full-back, real options at centre-back.\n‘The only player you’d be worried about losing for a period of time would be Declan Rice because you can’t replace that.\n‘That’s your Roy Keane, that’s your Rodri, the player that holds you together. There’s only one of them.\n‘They have got options if he wasn’t there, but you’d never be able to replace the ability of him to be powerful on set-pieces, his running, his tackling, his impact on the game going forward.\n‘I’m really happy with Arsenal watching them this season, I like watching good teams play football.’\nMore Trending\nNeville now expects Arsenal to win the Premier League title this season and, although this campaign will come too early, add the Champions League to their collection in the near future.\n‘It’s not only a squad that should go on and win the Premier League, it’s a squad that I can see winning the Champions League in the next two or three years,’ said the Manchester United hero.\n‘It might not be this season because sometimes when you go on to win your first Premier League you can get so consumed by that, you get done in a European game in midweek in a two-legged tie. But they’re getting to that level of performance and resilience and stability and consistency.’\nMetro at the Match: Arsenal 4-1 Tottenham\nIt just had to be Eze\nA first north London derby and what a way to announce yourself against the club that almost signed him in the summer. Eberechi Eze was given license to roam and find space, and he repaid that faith with two well-taken finishes.\nTrossard continues to go under the radar\nThe Belgian was kept quiet in the first 30 minutes, but a superbly timed run and finish gave Arsenal the lead and Leandro Trossard his fifth goal contribution in ten games. Arteta will find him hard to drop even as Madueke and Martinelli return to full fitness.\nHincapie impresses in Gabriel’s absence\nGiven his first league start since joining in the summer, Piero Hincapie proved exactly why Arteta previously described him as a ‘warrior’. The Ecuadorian didn’t have loads to do but threw himself at every ball and challenge when it came hs way.\nFull Arsenal player ratings: Raya 7, Timber 7, Saliba 6, Hincapie 7, Calafiori 6, Zubimendi 6, Rice 7, Eze 9, Saka 7, Merino 7, Trossard 6. Subs: Madueke N/A,Nwaneri N/A, Mosquera N/A, Lewis-Skelly N/A.\nDanso fails to deliver\nKevin Danso lined up alongside Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero as Frank opted for a back-five against Arsenal, but a nervy display from the Austrian only got worse when he allowed Trossard to ghost in behind him for the opener. No surprise he didn’t re-emerge after the break.\nOdobert anonymous\nThe young Frenchman was given the opportunity in Tottenham’s front three, but struggled to have any impact on the game before making way in the second half. The left side of Spurs’ attack remains one area where Frank is yet to find his preferred man.\nVicario the only positive\nPerhaps the only saving grace for Tottenham was that it was only the four goals shipped to their arch rivals. For that, they have Vicario to thank, who, while still unconvincing on the ball, remains a superb shot-stopper, denying Eze and Rice superbly either side of the half.\nFull Tottenham player ratings: Vicario 6, Spence 5, Romero 5, Van de Ven 5, Danso 3, Udoig 4, Palhinha 6, Bentancur 5, Kudus 5, Odobert 3, Richarlison 6. Subs: Simons 5, Sarr 5, Kolo Muani 5, Porro N/A, Johnson N/A.\nMetro’s Ben Fleming with the ratings live from the Emirates\nArsenal have two more big games coming up in a huge week as they host Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday, followed by a trip to Chelsea in the Premier League on Sunday.\nMORE: Ruben Amorim demands improvement from ‘struggling’ Man Utd player\nMORE: Arsenal’s Gabriel keeps up Richarlison war with dig after north London derby",
