Disclaimer ()\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n15:48:32\nI see where Tuchel has said “It would be ideal if one of his goalkeepers was playing European football next season.”\nIs he putting pressure on Pickford?\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n16:38:58\nChristy\nThat's the sort of thing coaches like Tuchel always say however he's come to England's rescue enough times while playing for us that Jordan's experience shot stopping for a poorer side than a European qualified one is beneficial.\nI don't think there should be the same caché playing for a European qualified side these days given the recent Europa league final especially how many non- Champions are in the club tournaments.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n16:52:10\nAndrew,\nI find it unbelievable that Tuchel picked Jones in the squad and plays him at fullback today and 3 fullbacks in the squad?\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n16:57:14\nOne word sums up this England manager, Henderson!\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n17:43:24\nThis England game is not even football.\nIt's just shite.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n17:49:23\nLiam, spot on, it’s bloody garbage.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n17:53:13\nThe smell in my lounge what is it?\nOh, I know, it's England on telly... 😀\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n17:59:50\nBraking into a sweat??? Wtf! Breaking breaking not fig braking! Fkng AI!!!!\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n18:02:14\nTuchel just as bad as every other England manager.\nBurn is shite.\nJames playing out of position.\nHenderson is shite.\nPalmer and Bellingham - brilliant players but prima donnas etc….\nTuchel out!!!\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n18:05:31\nHaving been thoroughly entertained watching the RL Challenge Cup final, this England game is a load of pony.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n18:07:58\nDarts is on ITV4 and boxing on Sky if you are fed up of watching this tripe\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n18:22:46\nIs there any need for this Andorra goalkeeper to keep on falling to the ground every time he catches the ball, or saves a piss-weak shot?\nHe's doing my head in with it.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n18:26:29\nPaul (8),\nI watched the rugby final, a game played by men, real men, and I would have enjoyed it a bit more ‘til Hull equalised with 2 minutes to go and won the game with the conversion.\nI had a tenner on Warrington but felt sorry for the Warrington defender who made the mistake for Hull's try — he'll take a long time to forget that!\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n18:26:35\nAbsolute garbage\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n18:44:19\nAll them caps Pickford has had for England and he's never even scored, absolutely disgraceful.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n18:46:01\nDave,\nIf you want to watch a game played by men, watch the Munster hurling final now between Limerick and Cork — unbelievable.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n18:46:05\nRat Boy with an Alice band. Nob.\nManager, coaches and players should be embarrassed by this debacle.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n18:46:13\nGreat game of rugby today, never disappoints.\nThen football comes on. 😴\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n18:53:25\nHow on earth did they miss that?\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n18:56:20\nSo these are what Tuchel calls champions league playing players? Walking around like a bunch of strutting peacocks? Bellingham and Palmer are generational talents but they need to show a bit more respect to team mates and opponents alike ie a bit more effort like\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n19:02:14\nAwww... Harry says it was too hot.\nUSA vs Turkey later on... can't see it showing anywhere on UK TV.\nIs it on Peacock, Mr Gaynes?\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n19:08:20\nI watched some of the Rugby League and it was entertaining, even though I didn't know what was going on. Mark will have to bring a white board before England v Australia.\nI switched over for the football. I can only think of one word. Turgid.\nSurely there could be a filter system for there to avoid matches like this? A bit like the FA Cup qualifying rounds.\nThey (England) play Senegal next week. At least we get to see Gana and Ndiaye.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n19:16:27\nTuchel's ears are problem for me.\nHis left ear sticks out at a weird angle, much more acute — or is it obtuse? I always get those mixed up.\nAnyway, I don't trust him.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n19:26:01\nHarry Redknapp was right, Tuchel is a German spy sent over to fuck up the English team.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n19:28:34\nI never trust men with really skinny legs. Like Slenderman and Bill Cosby\nSkinny legs, an obtuse ear and a comb over. Tuchel is probably an alien.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n19:32:47\nTuchel's comment that “it would ideal if one of his goalkeepers played in Europe next season” is patently ludicrous.\nDoes he believe that Dean Henderson (2 caps) will be good enough to dislodge Jordan (75 caps) by playing in the Europa League?\nCan't imagine previous world class England goalkeepers such as Banks and Shilton being treated in such an ignorant manner.\nThankfully I only endured the last 35 minutesof today's match. Evidently another dismal managerial appointment.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n19:59:57\nTuchel's grandfather first saw England through a periscope.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n20:05:10\nChristy (16),\nI was never fussy on the hurling games — those sticks get in the way! Give me a Gaelic football game and I'll watch it all day long, although I'm glad Seamus turned his back on that and joined us instead.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n20:20:07\nAnyone who picks Burns and Konsa as their centre-back pairing needs to have their managerial credentials questioned.\nGollum lookalike even said his goalkeepers need to play in Europe – not thinking that none of his selected keepers are in Europe.\nComplete dope and awful performance.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n20:41:15\nUSA vs Turkey on Fubo TV – in Español!\nVenue: Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field, Hartford, Connecticut.\nNo Cenk Tosun for Turkey (Shame!) but this kid Alladin is playing No 20 — Oguz Aydin, winger at Fenerbahçe — linked with Everton!\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n20:46:41\nGo USA! 1-0 up inside the 1st minute.\nA brilliant finish by Jack McGlynn.\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n21:01:50\nTurkey just missed a sitter\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n21:05:48\nCan't believe Poch has lowered his standards to manage the USA. He could still do a job in one of the big European leagues\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n21:07:30\n1-1\nPosted\n07/06/2025 at\n21:10:18\nHilarious goal for Turkey as Johnny fires his clearance into the Turkish player's knee and in past the US keeper.\nUh-oh, now 1-2, Turkey score again! Aydin likes to get forward, his shot deflected, I think, kneading to the goal.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n20:18:18\nWales taking a bit of a battering by Belgium in their World Cup qualifier. Currently 3-0 after 31 minutes.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n20:29:51\nI'm not sure if that penalty was harsh, but Belgium are teaching Wales a football lesson.\nWhen De Bruyne had to high-jump over the advertising hoardings, chasing to keep the ball in play, the replay shows a sly push in the back from the Wales defender.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n20:39:10\nWales penalty right on half time, again looked a bit harsh, but converted by Harry Wilson. 3-1.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n20:45:46\nAlways wanted Wales to do well down the years due to them having Everton players.\nBut having ex-kopite Bellamy as manager really puts me off. Someone who attacked a teammate with a golf club, left a youth coaching job due to bullying allegations, was cautioned by police for common assault on a female, and has been charged or convicted for numerous other offences.\nA horrible person.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n20:48:46\nLifeline or the Taffs? If they can get another, the flat-track bullies will start to panic.\nLove to see Wales make a fist of this.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n20:57:16\nLukebakio clean through for Belgium, on a one v one, and skies it over the bar.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n20:59:34\nYou might be correct, Liam.\nMy abiding memory of Craig Bellamy was when he refused to shake hands with John Terry in support of his teammate Wayne Bridge.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:00:37\nGame on…..3-2.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:02:08\nGame on after Belgium should have had it wrapped up with that sitter.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:18:41\nWow…..3-3.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:21:09\nCracking game\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:21:32\nHaHaHa.\nFlat track bullies reeling.\nWho'd have thought that?\nCome on the Taffs!\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:24:29\nLukebakio, a sub at half time for Belgium, has been subbed off………mind he has been bloody awful.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:30:09\nThat looked a throw-in for Wales in the lead-up to the Belgian fourth goal.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:30:23\nRom does what he does.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:32:20\nBig deflection though took it past the keeper.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:34:33\nDisallowed, and rightly so. The ball was well out for a throw in.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:34:38\nWow! VAR strikes again.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:37:13\nNothing wrong with that!\nDe Bruyne makes it 4-3.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:52:58\nCracking game.\nI wasn't expecting that after 35 minutes.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n21:53:21\nAnother great game of football to watch.\nDe Bruyne still has it. And that Duko is someone who terrifies defenders.\nI always wonder, what language do the Belgium players speak to each other? Dutch or French? Sorry, random thought.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n22:33:20\nThought the Welsh were robbed. The corner leading up to the winner was clearly a goal-kick.\nDesperately poor officiating all night, I thought.\nPosted\n09/06/2025 at\n22:39:54\nYes Colin, that was a goal kick.\nIt makes you wonder why VAR isn't used for other decisions rather than just offsides, goals and penalties.\nI still think Belgium overall deserved the win.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW\n© ToffeeWeb",
