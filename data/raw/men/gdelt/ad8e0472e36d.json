  "body_text": "Goal-den oldie: Modric sets Euro record\nCroatian captain becomes the oldest player to score in the tournament's history as his side falls to late Italy equalizer\nA standing ovation, a man-of-the-match award and a record.\nBut, Croatia star Luka Modric was in no mood to celebrate, regardless of the accolades, after what could have been his last appearance at a major tournament.\nModric scored against Italy on Monday in Leipzig, Germany, to become the oldest goal scorer ever at a European Championship.\nUltimately, it wasn't enough to keep his team in the competition. Mattia Zaccagni scored in the eighth minute of stoppage time to snatch a 1-1 draw for Italy that ensured it advances to the knockout stage.\nAn improbable series of other results need to go Croatia's way for it to remain at Euro 2024.\nModric was 38 years and 289 days old when he claimed the opening goal on a rebound in the 55th minute, within a minute of having a penalty saved by Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.\nThe previous record was held by Ivica Vastic, who was 38 years, 257 days old when he scored for Austria against Poland at Euro 2008.\nModric received a standing ovation from both sets of fans when he went off in the 80th minute, and he was applauded again when he showed up for the post-match news conference.\nOne Italian journalist started by telling Modric he was one of the most magnificent players he had ever reported on. He said he had no question to ask, just a request for him never to retire from playing.\nModric seemed genuinely moved by the kind words.\n\"I'd also like to keep playing forever, but there probably will come a time when I'll have to hang up my boots,\" he replied. \"I'll keep playing on, though I don't know for how much longer, but thank you.\"\nModric earlier this month extended his contract by another year at Real Madrid, where he has amassed an impressive haul of trophies since joining from Tottenham in 2012, including another Champions League and Spanish league title this season.\nModric has played 178 games for Croatia since making his debut at age 20 under Zlatko Kranjcar in 2006.\nThe 2018 Ballon d'Or winner is playing in his fifth European Championship. His goal against Italy took his tally to four goals in 16 games at the tournament.\nBut, Modric has enjoyed greater success with the national team at the World Cup, leading Croatia to the final in 2018, and third place in 2022.\nThe draw against Italy on Monday, and the manner in which it came with the last kick of the match, means Croatia is almost certain to be eliminated in the next few days.\n\"It was very stressful. We kept fighting like lions right to the end, but football is cruel,\" Modric said. \"That's part and parcel of the game. Sometimes it brings a lot of happiness, but sometimes it makes you very sad as well.\n\"Losing like this is very difficult. It's hard to find words to describe how my teammates and probably the fans feel as well. Of course, we need to bounce back.\"\nModric, who is the team captain, took comfort from the performance.\n\"We gave everything for Croatia, and this is how Croatia presents itself, regardless of the cruelty of this result.\n\"We deserved more, but it's football,\" he said. \"We can be proud of how we represented Croatia.\"\nHis first European Championship ended with an agonizing quarterfinal exit at the hands of Turkiye in 2008, when Croatia took the lead in the 119th minute in extra time, before conceding an equalizer and then losing on penalties.\nModric admitted Monday's heartbreak ranked alongside that loss 16 years ago. \"It's hard to actually to outdo the Turkiye game from 2008, but this game probably runs it pretty close. It's certainly a sad day for us and the Croatian national team.\"\nAdded time 'a nonsense'\nCroatia coach Zlatko Dalic said the length of added time in his team's heartbreaking 1-1 draw with Italy at Euro 2024 on Monday was a \"nonsense\".\nThe 2022 World Cup semifinalist was on the brink of reaching the last 16 when Italy substitute Zaccagni's strike in the eighth and final minute of injury time left it facing elimination.\nDalic claimed bigger nations would not have had to get through so much stoppage time in a similar situation.\n\"I don't know whether it was the eight minutes of added time at the end, but you know, with FIFA and UEFA... We're a small country and no one gives us any thought, so we have to stand up for ourselves,\" Dalic told reporters.\n\"Eight minutes was a nonsense. You can't have eight minutes after that game.\n\"We had a penalty our way and I don't want to cause a fuss about what's going on, but I think Croatia needs to be respected.\"\nCroatia finished third in Group B behind runner-up Italy and Spain.\n\"It really hurts, and it will continue to hurt over the coming days and months,\" added Dalic, who also led Croatia to the 2018 World Cup final and last year's Nations League final.\n\"It's not easy, but when we look at the situation in general, there are some days it's your day and some days it's not. That's football.\n\"We've been able to celebrate wins together down the years, and now we need to stick together in defeat, with humility, albeit while keeping our heads high.\"\nItaly will face Switzerland in the round of 16 on Saturday in Berlin's Olympiastadion, where the final is due to be played on July 14.\n\"We were a bit soft at times in the game, we didn't produce our best football,\" Italy coach Luciano Spalletti said. \"We did what we needed to do.\"\nMost Popular\n- Guangdong beats Macao 2-0 in first leg of soccer cup\n- Para teams set to leave mark on ice\n- US skier Johnson wins women's downhill as Vonn crashes at Milan-Cortina Games\n- Su Yiming clinches first medal at Milano-Cortina\n- Over 300 athletes from 35 countries and regions kick off Asian championships in Tianjin\n- Legacy of Beijing 2022 lives on as Milan welcomes Games",
