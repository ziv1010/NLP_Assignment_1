  "body_text": "“I don’t know where this boat will take us, but we have a captain,” said Osasuna’s sporting director Braulio Vazquez, defiantly, in January 2021.\nFollowing a 12th successive game without a win, and after a crushing defeat to Granada, his beloved club were in freefall.\n“If we sink,” Vazquez continued, “we all sink together.”\n“Jagoba Arrasate will be at the helm.”\nAdvertisement\nJust over two years on from an extraordinary emergency press conference, not only do Osasuna have a realistic shot at Europe, but a final to savour — and a Spanish Super Cup to plan. Best of all, Arrasate is still the man steering this remarkable ship, with more conviction and commitment than ever before.\nFrom the depths of despair, a display of unwavering faith from board to manager has supported the steady rise of one of Spain’s model clubs.\nStrong, stable, and with an unmistakable local core running through a modestly-assembled squad, they’re the side that no one really wants to play. Their semi-final win on Tuesday, over Basque rivals Athletic Bilbao, showed them at their gritty, unfaltering best.\nPamplona at 3am on a Wednesday morning because Osasuna just reached the Copa del Rey final. This is what football's all about!pic.twitter.com/RBGAZ5vWxy\n— Euan McTear (@emctear) April 5, 2023\nNo side in the top half of La Liga has seen fewer goals scored throughout their 27 games so far, so an extra-time smash-and-grab, with a goal from a player who cost the club nothing, couldn’t have been a more fitting way for the club to progress on aggregate\nIt was the fourth successive tie in which Arrasate’s men have ground out an extra-time win in this season’s competition, scoring crucial goals in the 91st, 99th, 106th, 112th and 116th minutes on their way to a second-ever cup final.\nBy the final whistle, as white shirts dropped to the floor in disbelief, Athletic had launched 23 shots at Sergio Herrera’s goal, falling agonisingly short of an elusive winner.\nAt the other end, Pablo Ibanez, a man who hadn’t ever previously scored a senior goal at the age of 24, had just side-footed a volley into the far corner from the edge of the box, to score Osasuna’s first goal in any competition since their winner in the first leg on March 1 — 519 minutes of football ago.\nIT'S IBANEZ! 💥\nOsasuna find a brilliant late goal ✨\nFantastic strike 👏 pic.twitter.com/5Y04MiBoEw\n— Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 4, 2023\nA story of perseverance and belief, few can begrudge this humble club their moment in the sun.\nWith slightly more experience in the Copa del Rey, Real Madrid booked their 40th appearance in the final of the competition in similarly incredible fashion, recording a historic 4-0 victory over Barcelona at Camp Nou.\nAdvertisement\nAs Karim Benzema hit his second hat-trick in the space of three days, Real Madrid scored four goals in an away Clasico for the first time in 60 years, when Ferenc Puskas also scored three to seal a 5-1 win in January 1963.\nTaking his tally up to 24 for the season, he is now the only Real Madrid player to score 20 or more in 11 successive seasons. Only Cristiano Ronaldo stands ahead in the club’s all-time scoring charts.\nJust 103 to go, Karim…\nOn the flip side, Barcelona’s baffling defensive season took another turn, as their five-game winning run came to a shocking end.\nXavi’s side have been rock-solid in La Liga, conceding just nine goals 27 games, including just two at Camp Nou — an own goal and a penalty. In other competitions, however, they have allowed 25 goals in just 15 contests, a rate five times higher than their impenetrable league form.\nSome will point to poor fortune. With Real Madrid’s opener coming just 19 seconds after Thibaut Courtois made a stunning save, the aggregate swung from 2-0 to 1-1 in the blink of an eye. Nine shots, seven on target, and four goals: just ask Liverpool what it feels like to be on the receiving end of a finishing clinic.\nEven so, with no more Camp Nou Clasicos until construction work is completed in 2025, this is a heavy defeat that will linger around Barcelona’s famous old ground for quite some time.\nMeanwhile, in Germany, Bayern Munich’s hopes of a treble came crashing down on Tuesday, in Thomas Tuchel’s second game in charge of the club.\nDespite utter domination of the domestic league, the German giants just don’t seem to have an answer for the cup, having now failed to progress past the quarter-finals for the third season in a row.\nWhile not quite as humiliating as their penalty shootout exit to second-tier Holstein Kiel in 2020-21, or last season’s 5-0 thumping at the hands of Borussia Monchengladbach, defeat to high-flying Freiburg is certainly an unwelcome head-scratcher ahead of their trip to Manchester City in the Champions League.\nAdvertisement\nThe 95th-minute winner is already the third, game-altering goal that Bayern have conceded in added time this season — as many as they suffered in the previous four seasons combined.\nHISTORIC WIN!\nFreiburg are awarded a late penalty which Lucas Höler scores to knock Bayern out of the DFB-Pokal 🎯😱\nIt's the first time the away side have EVER won at Bayern's home 👏#DFBPokal pic.twitter.com/Bmm8EVrdoS\n— Viaplay Sports UK (@ViaplaySportsUK) April 4, 2023\nFor Freiburg, reaching the semi-finals for just the third time in 47 cup campaigns, this was their first win at Bayern in their history.\nA squad packed with club legends, with a starting XI featuring just shy of 1,600 collective appearances, it was Nicolas Hofler, on his 294th, who struck an incredible bouncing ball from 25 yards to get Freiburg back on level terms.\nIt’s also their manager Christian Streich’s 12th season in charge — in which he’s overseen relegation, instant promotion, and record fifth, sixth and seventh-placed finishes within the last 10 years.\nFascinatingly, Freiburg, perched in fourth, welcome Bayern to the Black Forest in the Bundesliga tomorrow.\nRepeat their incredible midweek feat and German football folklore could be unfolding in front of our eyes.\nIn France, cup fever has gripped the city of Nantes once again.\nUnprecedented champions of last season’s edition, the man who scored the winner back in May, Ludovic Blas, produced a spectacular volley to guide Les Canaris through to their second final in a row, before which they’d spent more than 20 years without a trip to the Stade de France.\nFunnily enough, that final, back in 2000, was also their second in succession, beating Calais RUFC to secure back-to-back cups to end a 20-year wait.\nIt all feels curiously written in the stars…\nOn se 𝗥𝗘́𝗚𝗔𝗟𝗘 à revoir le 𝗯𝗶𝗷𝗼𝘂 de Ludovic Blas, sous 𝘁𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲𝘀 🤤\nUn enchaînement de grande classe, qui envoie une nouvelle fois le @FCNantes en finale de #CoupeDeFrance 🤩#FCNOL pic.twitter.com/J8qohxd4ZS\n— Coupe de France (@coupedefrance) April 6, 2023\nCup nights at the Stade de la Beaujoire are quickly becoming frantically magical occasions — this is now the sixth time in succession that Nantes have progressed from a home tie in the Coupe de France.\nAdvertisement\nAnd few encapsulate the enchantment quite like herculean centre-back Nicolas Pallois, who made eight clearances, six interceptions and blocked four shots on goal to keep Lyon at bay — the side who had beaten Paris Saint-Germain away from home just three days prior.\nQuickly mobbed by thousands of fans as their destiny was confirmed, the 35-year-old’s heroic performance cemented his stature as a legend of the club.\nBonne nuit Nantes 💛 pic.twitter.com/W3M1cPJ8KY\n— FC Nantes (@FCNantes) April 5, 2023\nRemarkably, in the next round, Nantes will meet Toulouse, who are appearing in their first-ever cup final after defeating relegation-fighting Ligue 2 side, FC Annecy yesterday.\nDespite beating Marseille on penalties at the Stade Velodrome last month, Annecy are currently fighting for their lives during their first season in the second division for 29 years.\nAhead of their Toulouse clash, they lost 4-0 to third-bottom Nimes. However, Annecy took the top-tier side all the way, only falling to an 85th-minute winner in a 2-1 defeat.\nInspired by the brilliant Branco van den Boomen and his 12th assist of the season from an all-action, deep-lying midfield role, Toulouse now take a step closer to the first major honour in their 86 years of existence.\nOsasuna. Freiburg. Nantes and Toulouse. We’re impressed if anyone tipped those four to be in cup finals come the end of this season…\n(Photo: LOIC VENANCE/AFP via Getty Images)",
