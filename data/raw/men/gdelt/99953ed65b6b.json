But when the choice is made between the goalkeepers, it could shape what the future looks like for Amorim and his ailing team.\nLeaving Onana out of the Premier League defeat at Newcastle was the easy bit.\nIn terms of the domestic situation, barring an unlikely late season surge into a Uefa Conference League spot, United's campaign is done. Telling Onana to have the weekend off and clear his head was a decision with few negatives attached.\nThe same cannot be applied to the decision Amorim has to make on Thursday. No matter which keeper misses out, they have to be on the bench.\nThe goalkeeper overlooked will surely be looking for a new club this summer.\nAnd it could yet turn out both will leave - meaning more money being paid out on replacements that the club can ill afford.\nIt is not an ideal situation and not one United chiefs were thinking about when Amorim arrived at the club from Sporting in November.\nHow on earth did we get here?\nInjured Zirkzee could miss rest of Man Utd's season\n- Published15 April 2025\nOnana on back foot from first moment\nThe motivation for Matic's attack has not been explained.\nHe was responding to relatively innocuous comments Onana made about Lyon in the build-up to the game, when he said he respected the French club but believed United were \"way better\".\nHowever, it is notable how strongly the former Serbia midfielder defended the man Onana replaced, David de Gea, when the Spaniard made his own series of mistakes in May 2019, saying, \"He is one of the best goalkeepers in the world and will be for years to come.\"\nWas Matic using Onana as collateral damage to reinforce a point shared by many that United made a mistake and treated one of their best players of recent times badly when they opted not to renew De Gea's contract in 2023 and sign the Cameroon international instead, for £47.2m from Inter Milan?\nThe situation was heightened when Onana, rather than remaining silent or at least waiting until after the game to respond, ignored cautionary advice and hit back, adding: \"At least I've lifted trophies with the greatest club in the world. Some can't say the same.\"\nMatic never won a trophy as a United player.\nIt was against that backdrop Onana made a catastrophic mistake for Lyon's opening goal in the 2-2 draw, then erred for the injury-time equaliser, the negativity for that heightened massively by the first inexplicable blunder.\nIf that performance was an isolated one, it would have been bad enough.\nBut it is acknowledged even by those closest to the former Ajax and Inter Milan goalkeeper that Onana's United career has been scarred by a series of big mistakes.\nHe has eight errors leading to goals in all competitions since he joined United - the most by any Premier League goalkeeper in that time.\nA feeling Onana was being scrutinised in a way he hadn't been previously in his career became evident in his first few weeks at United, when he was chipped from 50 yards in a pre-season friendly against Lens.\nOnana had been following instructions to take up a starting position higher up the pitch when his team had the ball, only for Diogo Dalot to give it away under no pressure.\nThe reaction was intense and the keeper was lampooned in some parts of social media. Even though he wasn't to blame, his performances became the subject of debate.\nIt put Onana on the back foot from the first moment.\nBayindir's failed Man Utd audition offers Onana dilemma\n- Published13 April 2025\nHow does Onana compare to other Man Utd keepers after Matic criticism?\n- Published9 April 2025\nOnana dropped from Man Utd squad to face Newcastle\n- Published13 April 2025\nThe long wait for Bayindir\nBayindir meanwhile, waited patiently for his chance. And waited. And waited.\nA £4.3m arrival from Fenerbahce in September 2023, Bayindir was a regular member of the Turkey squad.\nYet Erik ten Hag would not play him. The former United boss even persuaded Onana to delay his departure to the Cameroon squad for the Africa Cup of Nations in January 2024 long enough to allow him to play in an FA Cup tie at League One Wigan and Premier League draw with Tottenham.\nBayindir did eventually make his debut during Onana's absence in the FA Cup fourth round at Newport, which United won 4-2 after throwing away a two-goal lead. It turned out to be Bayindir's only appearance of the season. It was not much of a show of faith from Ten Hag.\nBefore the Newcastle game, Bayindir had played six times this season, all in cup competitions. He featured in the last two games of United's Europa League first-phase campaign but was injured for the last-16 tie with Real Sociedad and back on the bench in Lyon.\nLittle wonder that the feeling had been growing from those close to him he would move on in the summer.\nNewcastle offered a chance to change the narrative. But Bayindir's kicking was shaky and he made a mistake for the home side's fourth goal.\nWhat was to be expected, countered Bayindir's supporters, with the 27-year-old pitched into a much-changed team, with some players badly lacking in confidence.\nDoes 'leader' Onana still have Amorim's faith?\nYet Onana, outwardly so boisterous and confident, could be forgiven for sharing the same uncertainties.\nHis leadership around the dressing room is viewed as a major strength in a squad that lacks them. Yet, reunited with his old boss Ten Hag partly because of his ability with the ball at his feet, Onana is now frequently asked to go long and hit strikers who struggle to hold the ball up.\nIt is felt Amorim is hugely supportive of him but the change in defensive structure, with players largely not used to the system, has been hard to adapt to.\nHe is more comfortable with life off the field than he was in Italy, mainly because he and his family speak English. But Onana knows United's performances have not been good enough. He knows he bears some responsibility for that but is starting to feel he is shouldering most of the blame when there are multiple factors at play.\nThose closest to him also suspect if United's Europa League campaign does not end with them lifting the trophy in Bilbao next month and taking with it that prized Champions League berth, the events in Lyon will be cited as a significant reason, which could hasten Onana's departure from Old Trafford.\nThat is a situation United had not bargained for six months ago.\nThey have known for some considerable time multiple areas of Amorim's squad needed work - everyone can see a goalscorer is desperately required - but felt first-choice goalkeeper was reasonably secure.\nUnited will still be paying off Onana's fee in instalments spread across his five-year contract, meaning they would surely lose money if they were to consider selling him this summer.\nRelated topics\n- Published26 July 2022",
