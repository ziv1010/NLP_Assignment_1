  "body_text": "Martin O’Neill admits his shock after taking Celtic reins on interim basis\nBy Gavin McCafferty, PA\nMartin O’Neill stressed he was stepping into the Celtic hotseat on a short-term basis after admitting shock over his return to Glasgow.\nThe 73-year-old will take charge on an interim basis alongside former player Shaun Maloney following Brendan Rodgers’ sudden departure.\nCeltic announced on Monday night that Rodgers had “tendered his resignation”, while principal shareholder Dermot Desmond delivered a scathing statement, accusing the 52-year-old of stoking division.\nRodgers won 11 trophies over two spells but leaves with Celtic eight points adrift of William Hill Premiership leaders Hearts ahead of Wednesday’s fixtures, which see Falkirk visit Parkhead.\nO’Neill revealed on TalkSPORT that he had been “shocked” to receive a call from Desmond on Monday offering him a job.\nThe former Republic of Ireland manager, who won seven trophies in five years at Celtic Park, added: “I took a gasp of breath and thought, is this real or surreal?\n“So it’s difficult really to turn down somebody who gave you the job in the first place when he had really some great options a way back 25 years ago.\n“So from that viewpoint, maybe by the time that I pulled myself off the floor, I probably thought then maybe I should do it.\n“Interim does mean that to me. Absolutely. It’s really as simple as that. Celtic are looking for – I would have assumed – a young coach who has a proven ability and would be wanting to pull the club forward now.\n“That’s how I would view it and I suppose if I was a Celtic fan, I would absolutely see it.\n“I had a super time there. It was an absolute privilege to have managed them before. My time had gone. I mean, I can’t emphasise this enough. This is short term until a permanent manager is appointed.”\nCeltic take on Rangers at Hampden on Sunday in the Premier Sports Cup semi-finals and then play Midtjylland in Denmark in the Europa League before hosting Kilmarnock ahead of the international break.\nWhen asked about the timescale, O’Neill said: “I have to win football matches and that’s no different and at Celtic, it’s always been the case.\n“If we can win some football matches and give us a bit of buying time as it were, until a new man is appointed.”\nMaloney returned to Celtic in June as player pathways manager and his appointment appears to have spelled the end of assistant manager John Kennedy’s time at the club.\nThe former Celtic defender had a three-month spell in interim charge in 2021 and has worked with the first team since 2014 but was not mentioned in the club’s statement on Monday night.\nO’Neill said: “Shaun and I go back years and years, when he was a young player with me.\n“But he is experienced in management now and he’s worked as well too with lots of really good coaches I will obviously need help and Shaun is there to give it to me.”\nThe acrimonious nature of Desmond’s statement lifted the lid on the extent of the internal strife that had lingered at Celtic throughout a summer when they did not meet their objectives in the transfer market and failed to qualify for the Champions League.\nRodgers had publicly called for more attacking reinforcements and Desmond expressed “deep disappointment” with the former Liverpool boss.\nThe Irishman claimed Rodgers had misrepresented the situation over his own contract talks and that the manager had “full knowledge, approval, and endorsement” over all transfers,\nDesmond claimed that Rodgers’ words and actions had been “divisive, misleading, and self-serving”, contributed to a “toxic atmosphere” around the club and “fuelled hostility” towards the board.",
