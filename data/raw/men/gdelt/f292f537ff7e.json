I do not want to be a replacement any longer.\n\"My family like England as much as me,\" he added. \"I think that I know the style of play and I have made my name here. But I have serious options in Germany to consider as well. My agent is working on a possible move to the Bundesliga.\"\nKuszczak also revealed that he had chances to moved to Aston Villa or rejoin the Baggies last summer.\nBirmingham’s Colin Doyle has also been linked with the Blues but was not the keeper Jewell met for talks last Thursday.\nMeanwhile, Doncaster midfielder James Coppinger has conceded that he may move on from the relegated Rovers this summer and wouldn’t be averse to relocating to Suffolk if Town renewed last year’s interest: “I think Ipswich is a great club. I have some friends who have played at Ipswich in the past and they speak highly of the club and the place.\n“With them being in the Championship and an ambitious club, it is always somewhere you would look to go.”\nHowever, speaking after Saturday’s game, Blues boss Paul Jewell played down the likelihood of Town doing a deal for the 31-year-old, having previously said he’d speak to Rovers manager Dean Saunders about the former Exeter man: “I don’t think so. We’d like good players, he’s a good player, Coppinger, but I don’t think so.”\nElsewhere, former Blues coach and assistant manager John Gorman has decided to retire at the end of the season. Gorman, 62, worked under George Burley and then had a second spell at the club during Jim Magilton’s time in charge. The Scot is currently assisting Karl Robinson at MK Dons.\nPhoto: Action Images\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\nHe'll obviously choose us though\nDon't waste any more time.\nWho's next then?\nRather Doyle anyway. Seen him play and looks like a flapper to me.\nVery good.\nIpswich can become Gipsansk\n----------------------------------------------\nMight as well forget it then.\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
