former Everton flop currently starring in Italy, with a view to making a surprise bid for the attacker in the summer transfer window.\nIt’s expected to be a busy summer of ins and outs in north London, whether Ange Postecoglou keeps his job or not and, according to reports that surfaced on Friday, Spurs could add an attacker to their squad who struggled during four years at Goodison Park.\nItaly international striker Moise Kean is the player in question, with the 25-year-old currently excelling at Fiorentina and finally showcasing the talents that Everton forked out an initial £25million for back in 2019.\nAfter scoring just four goals in 39 games in competitions for the Toffees, sandwiched in between loan stints at PSG and his old club Juventus, the forward rejoined Juve on a permanent deal in 2023.\nHaving struggled to make a mark back in Turin, Kean moved to Florence last summer and has not looked back – notching an impressive 19 goals in 31 games in competitions this season.\nThat eye-catching form has led to significant interest in his services again, with GiveMeSport claiming that Tottenham have asked to be ‘kept in a loop’ regarding the player’s future.\nSpurs are certainly in the market for more attacking depth, with the addition of a new No.9 one of their man focuses due to the injury struggles of both Richarlison and Dominic Solanke.\nLoan signing Mathys Tel has also struggled to adapt to English football so far, which could lead to Spurs deciding against taking up their option to sign the young French forward.\nTo that end, a move for a player who has previous Premier League experience – albeit with not great success – could be a wise decision, especially given how Kean’s game has clearly moved to another level since quitting Merseyside.\nThe report adds that Kean currently has a £44m (€52m / $57m) release clause in his contract, which appears to be more than reasonable for a 25-year-old international player excelling in one of Europe’s top five leagues.\nHowever, GiveMeSport goes on to add that Tottenham are not the only English club keeping tabs on Kean, with Newcastle United and West Ham United also keen – while Arsenal have also been credited with an interest.\nDON’T MISS ➡️ FOUR players Tottenham need to sign to end renewed talk of Ange Postecoglou sack\nMoise Kean profile since leaving Everton\nAugust 31,
