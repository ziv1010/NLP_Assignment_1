  "body_text": "Q&AArne Slot press conference: Mo Salah's Ballon d'Or chances, title race and Newcastle\nRead the best bits from Arne Slot's press conference ahead of Liverpool's Premier League clash with Newcastle United.\nThe Reds head coach spoke to reporters at the AXA Training Centre on the eve of that Anfield encounter between the Carabao Cup finalists.\nSlot discussed the threat of Eddie Howe's side, Liverpool's standing in the league table and the incredible form of Mohamed Salah this season.\nSee a summary from the briefing below…\nOn how 'worthy a candidate' Salah is to win the Ballon d'Or...\nIt's a good thing that Mo is in the discussion because it means he does well and it means we are doing well. But for him to stay in that discussion, he should bring in the same performances as he's done for seven or eight months now. I think in general, someone that wins the Ballon d'Or needs to win something as well, so it is a great challenge in front of us but also in front of him.\nWhat I liked a lot is that he takes this challenge – not only by scoring a big goal and a great assist against [Manchester] City but he also wanted the team to win because his defensive work-rate, especially in the second half, was outstanding. I think that is what it takes for us to have a chance of winning something and if we as a team can win something, he will have a far more better chance to win an individual prize like the Ballon d'Or.\nOn whether multiple trophies can help Salah's chances with the Ballon d'Or...\nIt would make his chance only bigger but the last one who won it, I think he only won the league and not the Champions League. It is not only about the amount of prizes you win but I think all of the ones that won it in the past probably – I am not 100 per cent sure – won either the league or the Champions League. But in football it's always like this: you need the team to win an individual prize, and that's what Mo understands at the moment really well because his work-rate, especially in the second half but almost during the whole game, was very good and very helpful for us to have a chance to win the game against City.\nOn 'reinforcing the message that the title race isn't over'...\nI don't think I need to even enforce that message because these are the players that played – and I know the [Nottingham] Forest fans are going to like me saying this again – but these players played the Forest home game, these players played the Fulham home game, these same players played the Manchester United home game and the same players played Newcastle away, which was a very difficult game for us – two times being a goal down and then being one goal up and eventually drawing it to 3-3. I don't think it's necessary. These players are so long in this competition – even much longer than me – so they know how difficult every single game is and if you have to play 11 that it's still a long way to go.\nOn Alexander Isak and Newcastle...\nIt's an understatement to say that he's in fine form. I think he's in excellent form. Also over there it's the team performance that will help us [in] controlling him. So the more ball possession we have, the easier it is to control him, although he is definitely a threat on the counter-attack as well. We've got two very, very, very good centre-backs, and that's definitely what you need if you face a striker with the quality of Alexander Isak.\nBut it's not only about him, I like the style of play that Eddie Howe introduced there. They are always a team that has a very good game plan, they are really intense with and without the ball, [a] high-intense tempo in the game, so that helps a No.9 as well because the better your teammates are, the more chances you get. He's not the only offensive threat they have – I think [Anthony] Gordon and the right-winger as well, so they are a big threat. It's not only about him but he's definitely having a great season.\nThey have so much offensive threat. I think normally they are not a team that concedes so many goals because they are very aggressive in defending as well. I saw – not for this game but just out of interest – the semi-final they played against Arsenal and we all know how well Arsenal are when it comes to attacking, also in defending, but in this situation in attacking and they just kept them away from their goal by defending really strong, maybe similar to what we did at City – defending with 10 or 11 players. They can score goals but they are also able to defend really strong, and that is what makes them such a difficult team to play against.\nOn Salah's competitiveness...\nWhat I see is a top professional – not only what you guys see on the pitch but he comes in early, works so hard on his body. Sometimes I get to see a few Instagrams and I think he works even at home as well. So, if I see how much work he puts in over here and then to do something extra at home, I think he's found the balance for himself to get the best out of himself – that's what also comes with experience, with playing so many games at the highest level. He knows now what to do to treat his body in the best possible way and for him to get the performances in that he does.\nBut he is not the only one. I see everyone works so hard – and I'm talking about the players now first – to get the best out of themselves. But all the staff members work incredibly hard as well. It's February now and we, again, have three pitches over here that are perfectly ready for us to train in the best possible circumstances. So, it's not only about the players that put a lot of effort in to get the best out of themselves, it's the whole building and all the people that work here to get the best of the players as well.\nYou have to accept cookies in order to view this content on our site.\nWatch on YouTube",
