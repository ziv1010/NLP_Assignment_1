  "body_text": "Arsenal are one of the clubs interested in signing Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Hugo Larsson at the end of the season, according to SportBild (page 36).\nThe Gunners are likely to strengthen their midfield department with the possibility of exits.\nJorginho and Thomas Partey have their contracts expiring on June 30. As things stand, the duo could leave on free transfers when the campaign ends.\nReal Sociedad’s Martin Zubimendi has been tipped to join the Gunners, and reports have claimed that the club have ‘practically finalised‘ a transfer for him.\nHowever, the club continue to be linked with other midfielders. SportBild report that the club are keen on recruiting Larsson from Eintracht this summer.\nEintracht are almost guaranteed Champions League football next season, and they have set a huge price tag of £51 million to part ways with the 20-year-old.\nLarsson is anticipated to pursue a bigger challenge away from the Bundesliga outfit, but Eintracht have recommended him to stay for another 12 months.\nArsenal could face competition from Manchester City and Liverpool for his services.\nArsenal may not make a big outlay to purchase Larsson\nThe Gunners will likely part ways with Jorginho when his contract expires this summer. The midfielder has been heavily linked with a free transfer to Flamengo.\nThe club have opened contract talks with Partey amid his consistent performances this term, and there is a possibility that the Ghanaian could stay for another year or two.\nIn our view, it is essential for the club to keep Partey even if they purchase Zubimendi. The latter may need some time to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League.\nArsenal have also been credited with an interest in Larsson, but we don’t see the club spending big on an emerging talent, considering they have high title ambitions.\nThe club must focus on signing players in the prime of their careers if they want to end their two-decade wait for the league title.\nAside from a defensive midfielder, the club could recruit a marquee striker, a versatile winger and a backup goalkeeper this summer.\nA new central defender could be targeted if Jakub Kiwior pushes to leave for regular playing time.\nKiwior has played as a backup when centre-back duo William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes have been fit.\nWith this in mind, it is unlikely that Arsenal will spend £51m on Larsson, considering they need a similar package to sign Zubimendi.\nStats from Transfermarkt.com",
